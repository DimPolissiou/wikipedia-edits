New Zealand is the southwestern corner of the [[Polynesian Triangle]], a region of the Pacific Ocean with three island groups at its corners: [[Hawaiian Islands]], Rapa Nui ([[Easter Island]]), and New Zealand ([[Aotearoa]] in M\u0101ori).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.maori.com/aotearoa|title=Aotearoa \u2013 The Maori Name for New Zealand|publisher=Maori Tourism Limited|work=www.maori.com|language=en-NZ|access-date=2017-07-27}}</ref> The many island cultures within the Polynesian Triangle share similar languages derived from a [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|proto-Malayo-Polynesian language]] used in southeastern Asia 5,000 years ago. Polynesians also share cultural traditions such as religion, social organisation, myths, and material culture.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Polynesia|title=Polynesian culture {{!}} cultural region, Pacific Ocean|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-07-27|language=en}}</ref> Anthropologists believe that all Polynesians have descended from a south Pacific proto-culture created by an [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] (Malayo-Polynesian) people that had migrated from southeastern Asia. Other main Polynesian cultures include: [[Easter Island|Rapa Nui]] (now known as Easter Island), [[Hawaii]], [[Marquesas]], [[Samoa]], [[Tahiti]], [[Tonga]], and [[Cook Islands]]. Over the last five millennia, a sequence of complicated and remarkable transoceanic treks were performed in an unprecedented accomplishment of navigation and curiosity. The final segments of these feats were across extreme and unmatched distances: to Hawaii, Rapa Nui, and Aotearoa.<ref>{{cite book|last=Somerville|first=Alice Te Punga|title=Once Were Pacific: Maori Connections to Oceania|year=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|page=17}}</ref>\n\nPolynesian seafarers were ocean navigators and [[astronomy|astronomers]]. Polynesians would travel long distances by sea. The strong female presence among early settlers in New Zealand suggests Polynesian migration voyages were not accidental but deliberate.

Many edible plants were brought from the home islands and of these [[Sweet potato|''k\u016bmara'' (sweet potato)]] was to become the most important. In the far South, however, it was too cold to grow any of these crops. Large quantities of [[Cordyline australis|t\u012b]] tubers were eaten that were slow-cooked in large {{lang|mi|umu}} or {{lang|mi|[[h\u0101ngi]]}} (earth ovens) to get rid of the poison and to produce a slightly sweet pulp. Shellfish, fish, sharks and seals were also common foods. Native dogs ({{lang|mi|kur\u012b}}) and rats were brought from the Pacific Islands. The introduction of rats undoubtedly had more impact on New Zealand wildlife than any other organism apart from humans.<ref name=\"campbell&hutchings\" /> The dogs were used for hunting but also as food.<ref>Irwin pp 10\u201314.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe new environment offered challenges to the settlers. Its cold climate meant that tropical staple crops needed careful cultivation to survive, and some failed to grow locally. [[Sweet potato|K\u016bmara]] was an important crop that arrived with the Polynesian settlers. Much of the activity to produce k\u016bmara became ritualised \u2013 it was even associated with Rongom\u0101t\u0101ne (Rongo), a high-ranking {{lang|mi|atua}} (god).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/kumara/page-4|title=K\u016bmara \u2013 Religious aspects|last=Adds|first=Peter|encyclopedia=Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=1 November 2013}}</ref> K\u016bmara featured in some {{lang|mi|whakatauk\u012b}} (proverbs): \"{{lang|mi|Kaore te k\u016bmara e k\u014drero mo t\u014dna m\u0101ngaro}}\" (the k\u016bmara does not speak of its own sweetness) encouraged people to be modest.\n\nSeasonal activities included gardening, fishing and the hunting of birds. Main tasks were segregated for men and women, but there were also a lot of group activities involving food gathering and food cultivation.\n\nThese early colonists explored New Zealand to find suitable stones for tool-making. The main stone source areas included [[Mayor Island]], Taupo and Kerikeri for [[obsidian]] (volcanic glass); prospectors soon found {{lang|mi|[[pounamu]]}} (greenstone or [[jade]]) and {{lang|mi|pakohe}} ([[argillite]]) resources in the South Island in the Reefton and Nelson areas.<ref name=\"DNZB Duff\" /> Basalt was later also found which is prospected to have a use in construction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/publications/factsheets/rare-ecosystems/subterranean-or-semi-subterranean/subterranean-basalt-fields|title=Subterranean basalt fields|website=Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> Stone served in all aspects of Polynesian life: from chopping wood to cutting and slicing food, as anchors for {{lang|mi|waka}} (canoes) and fishing nets, for retaining the heat in a {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}}, as drills using chert, and for stone clubs.

It was this adaptation to the opportunities and challenges of the new environment that lead to the development of the Classic M\u0101ori culture.\n\n=== Classic period c.1500 AD ===\n[[File:Hinepare.jpg|alt=|thumb|Traditional formal dress of the Classic/contact period.

At the same time, M\u0101ori groups became less [[nomadic]], more settled in defined territories, and more dependent on gardening as a food source. Reliance on stored food such as k\u016bmara tubers meant that stores needed to be protected from marauding neighbours. The widespread construction of large fortifications called {{lang|mi|[[p\u0101]]}} on prominent hills and spurs dates from this time, as evidence of the development of a more martial, tribal culture.{{sfn|King|2003|page=72}} All aspects of this culture were not universally adopted, particularly in the South Island where k\u016bmara could not be easily grown.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last1=Bunce|first1=Michael|last2=Beavan|first2=Nancy R.|last3=Oskam|first3=Charlotte L.|last4=Jacomb|first4=Christopher|last5=Allentoft|first5=Morten E.|last6=Holdaway|first6=Richard N.|date=2014-11-07|title=An extremely low-density human population exterminated New Zealand moa|journal= Nature Communications|language=en|volume=5|pages=5436|bibcode=2014NatCo...5.5436H|doi=10.1038/ncomms6436|issn=2041-1723|pmid=25378020|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n=== Cultural change by contact with Europeans c.1800 AD===\nBecause of the very small number of Europeans who visited New Zealand in the 18th and early 19th century, the core values of M\u0101ori culture were little altered. [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]] estimated there were only 1100 Europeans in the North Island in 1839, with 200 being missionaries, and a total of about 500\u2013600 Europeans in the Bay of Islands.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=101}} The northern M\u0101ori population at the time has been estimated at about 30,000 to 40,000, down from about 100,000, fifty years before.<ref name=\":1\" /> This drop in population was mostly due to [[Measles|disease]] and the [[Musket Wars]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/171949|title=2. \u2013 Taupori M\u0101ori \u2013 M\u0101ori population change \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref>\n\nFor decades, European missionaries, mostly living in the north of the North Island, had very little influence over M\u0101ori behaviour. Missionaries report being appalled at the violent, seemingly arbitrary nature of M\u0101ori behaviour. This included warfare, slavery, cannibalism, sexual abuse of women, killing of female children and revenge killings. However, by 1840, many of these customs were all but abolished or not publicly practised.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=220}}\n\nIn the coastal South Island, the M\u0101ori population was very small. Whalers set up shore stations along the southern and eastern coasts and formed M\u0101ori\u2013European working communities. In the early 1800s, it was common for chiefs to provide whalers with M\u0101ori wives, often their daughters. By the 1820s, European men had married about 200 M\u0101ori women in the coastal area between modern Christchurch and Invercargill, about half of all the marriageable aged women in the South Island \u2013 in fact, M\u0101ori men were finding it hard to compete for wives.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=320}}\n\nContact with Europeans enabled M\u0101ori to access the material culture of England, then the most advanced industrial nation in the world. By 1800, the desire for iron objects such as large ships' nails overcame apprehension about boarding an anchored ship and this drove M\u0101ori trading behaviour, lasting until 1840.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=32}} Desirable steel objects and blankets were at first traded for fish. M\u0101ori were generally very curious about European culture after initial misunderstandings and apprehension, with M\u0101ori showing great ability to accept changes and integrating these into their normal way of life{{sfn|O'Malley|2012}}<ref>''Climates of War''. E. Bohan. p 29</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Marion Du Fresne gave northern M\u0101ori potatoes, wheat, onions, goats, pigs, chickens and other food to raise. Potatoes and pigs rapidly became a key part of M\u0101ori agriculture in the north, but the new food was almost exclusively reserved for trading purposes, with M\u0101ori still eating fish and fern roots, supplemented by [[k\u016bmara]]. Later, as M\u0101ori grew large areas of potatoes (Hongi Hika had a 40-acre potato field), whalers would call into the Bay of Islands, in particular, to trade for fresh supplies.\n\nOne significant change was the immediacy of reciprocation in trade. In tradition M\u0101ori tikanga, when an item was given there was no expectation of immediate response as gifted items were mainly food, which was governed by seasonal supply. When dealing with Europeans, M\u0101ori learnt that immediate payment was expected. Gift giving was a different matter in M\u0101ori culture. Gifts were given to recognise {{lang|mi|mana}} (power or authority).{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=112}}\n\nBurial practices also changed to incorporate aspects of Christianity. Bodies were usually buried in the ground by the mid 1840s although sometimes coffins, decorated with M\u0101ori motifs were used, suspended in trees or on poles as drawn by J. Polack.

In 1900 few M\u0101ori lived in European urban settlements. This changed very slowly. There were only 1,766 M\u0101ori in Auckland in 1935. In 1936 only 11.2% of M\u0101ori lived in urban areas. By 1945 this had risen to 19% and by 1971 to 68%. These changes reflect a significant alteration in the basis for income and employment \u2013 from working on rural land to working mainly in construction, freezing works or labouring. The dominant factors influencing this shift were the burgeoning M\u0101ori population and the inability of the land to support the increasing population.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, MP Ngata had passed land legislation to help M\u0101ori make better use of their remaining tribal land. M\u0101ori were handicapped in using and developing the land for modern agriculture as much M\u0101ori land was steep, remote, erosion-prone with high rainfall.{{sfn|King|2001|pages=101\u2013107}} European farmers who owned their land freehold mechanised to gain higher productivity, using bank loans for the new equipment. M\u0101ori were unable to gain loans as their land was generally tribal land and could not be used for securing individual loans. Leasing land to European farmers gave M\u0101ori a steady income but this was spread among many people. M\u0101ori farming was often based on a different system of values and not driven by European goals of efficiency and high productivity.{{sfn|King|2001|page=103}}\n\nApart from jobs, another attraction to urban migration were the monetary, recreational and lifestyle attractions of the city. Many M\u0101ori felt that success lay in the city rather than the country. King describes this as a \"fantasy contagion-the realty did not live up to the myth but this did not stop the fantasy or the migration\".{{sfn|King|2001|page=104}}\nOther changes were a rising birth rate. In 1955, the M\u0101ori birth rate was nearly double the European rate at 43.6 compared to 26 per 1000. At the same time, M\u0101ori had fewer qualifications. In 1956 6.5% of M\u0101ori held professional, managerial or clerical jobs compared to 26.7% non-M\u0101ori. As a result, only 3.36% of M\u0101ori earned 700 pounds or more per annum compared to 18.6% for non-M\u0101ori.{{sfn|King|2001|page=105}} M\u0101ori were significantly impacted by changing economic circumstances such as the drop in wool prices. This made M\u0101ori more vulnerable to economic and social deprivation. King says that the lower M\u0101ori educational attainment lead to lower income jobs, which led to lower income, poor housing, and poor health, which in turn led to higher rates of crime.{{sfn|King|2001|page=105}}\n\nThese ingredients were potential causes of racial tension. They were seen by the wider community as \"M\u0101ori problems\". By the 1970s and 1980s, enough urbanised M\u0101ori had reached positions of influence to bring about a gradual but radical change to the thinking of governments. Their advocacy was underscored by an increasing willingness to use [[M\u0101ori protest movement|vigorous protest to push Mana M\u0101ori]].

The expression, an abstraction of the word for aristocracy, had been coined by Henry Williams in the Treaty of Waitangi to convey the idea of \"chieftainship\".

From the early 1990s a series of favourable outcomes from the treaty tribunal resulted in a large flow of capital in the form of land, primary resources and cash from the government to various M\u0101ori [[iwi]] (tribe or nation) and [[hap\u016b]] (subtribe or clan).{{sfn|King|2001|pages=115\u2013118}} A key concept was the continued occupation of an area of land (Ahi kaa).<ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/reports/viewchapter.asp?reportID=D5D84302-EB22-4A52-BE78-16AF39F71D91&chapter=188 |title=Ngai Tahu Land Report|publisher=[[Waitangi Tribunal]]|year=1991|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109084520/http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/reports/viewchapter.asp?reportID=D5D84302-EB22-4A52-BE78-16AF39F71D91&chapter=188 |archive-date=9 November 2013}}, 1991, waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz</ref> The largest tribal deals approached $1 billion although many were far smaller.

Mana is sacred power bestowed by the gods on the ancestral lineage of chiefs, or {{lang|mi|tohunga}}. While the {{lang|mi|mana}} itself is a supernatural gift, the chief is free to waste or magnify it.{{sfn|Mol|1981|page=15}} Historian Judith Binney says that maintaining and increasing the {{lang|mi|mana}} of {{lang|mi|whanau}} and {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} and loyalty within the group is unquestionably at the heart of M\u0101ori cultural concepts. She says that M\u0101ori cultural history is confusing to the uninformed as it consists of narrative-myths that stretch far back in time. Also confusing is that chronological time is irrelevant or distorted<ref>Stories Without End. J. Binney, p 182</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} to the M\u0101ori cultural story, so a person living in the present may narrate a story about their family or hap\u016b that happened centuries ago; nonetheless, the narrator appears as a contemporary figure in the myth.\n\nA key element of cultural leadership is to link the narrator to a well known historical figure with mana (prestige/authority power).<ref>Stories Without End, J Binney, pp. 78\u201385</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} This is why being able to recite the family history is so important. In M\u0101ori culture names of people and places are fluid. Individuals may change their name several times or have several different names that they use depending on the cultural situation. In the past, hap\u016b changed names if they moved to another area where an alternative name was more positive. One of the main reasons for name fluidity was access to resources. As a hap\u016b moved seasonally to utilise different resources its name changed to reflect an ancestor who had historical-cultural rights to that resource. Binney says that being connected to a powerful hap\u016b with many well-known ancestors was important for protection and survival. As M\u0101ori communication was almost totally oral until well into the contact period, oral myth-narratives became more varied to match the needs of each hap\u016b or whanau.\n\n=== {{lang|mi|Whakapapa}} (genealogy) ===\n{{lang|mi|[[Whakapapa]]}} is the origin and path of descent of a person, object or geographic area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/whakapapa-genealogy|title=Whakapapa \u2013 genealogy \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-12}}</ref> A person's {{lang|mi|whakapapa}} establishes their mana and tribal connections.

However, in a broader sense, {{lang|mi|utu}} is meant as the preservation of balance and harmony within a civilisation. In the concept of {{lang|mi|utu}}, a fault must always be corrected and a kindness repaid.{{sfn|King|2003|page=81}} However, the means by which this is accomplished may vary greatly by case. In the context of a gift exchange, {{lang|mi|utu}} creates and preserves social connections and commitments. {{lang|mi|Utu}} recovers balance in the event that social relations are interrupted. A version of {{lang|mi|utu}}, {{lang|mi|muru}}, is defined as the confiscation of a person's possessions as reparation for a misdeed against an individual, community, or society.<ref>\"The Boyd Incident,\" Ministry for Culture and Heritage, 20 December 2012, retrieved on 10 April 2018.</ref>{{cnf|January 2020}}\n\nGift exchange was governed by three basic principles. Firstly giving had to have the appearance of being free and spontaneous, without stipulation of a return present. Secondly, a strict system of obligation was in force whereby the receiver was bound to not only reciprocate but to increase the value of the reciprocated gift. Thirdly the system demanded that further social obligation had now been established to continue the exchanges. Failure to respond meant loss of mana or influence. Where parties had travelled a long way to give a present it was expected that the return gift be immediate but often due to seasonal food supplies it was accepted that a return gift would be given at some later date when supplies allowed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Firth|first=R.|title=Primitive Economics of the New Zealand Maori|year=1929}}</ref> While a gift conveyed an obligation to return the favour, so did an insult.

On the {{lang|mi|marae}} official functions take place including formal welcomes, celebrations, weddings, christenings, reunions, and {{lang|mi|[[tangihanga]]}} (funerals).

Acceptance of the token in the face of such aggression is a demonstration of the courage and {{lang|mi|[[mana]]}} of the visitor. The {{lang|mi|p\u014dwhiri}} is highly structured, with speeches from both hosts and guests following a traditional format, their sequence dictated by the {{lang|mi|kawa}} (protocol) of that place, and followed by {{lang|mi|[[M\u0101ori music|waiata]]}}, songs. {{lang|mi|Hui}} are held for business, for festivities or for rites of passage such as baptism, marriage and death.

When the stones are hot, prepared food is placed on top of them, meat first and then vegetables such as k\u016bmara, potatoes and pumpkin. The {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}} is then covered with leaves or mats woven out of {{lang|mi|[[Phormium tenax|harakeke]]}}, or wet sacks, and soil is then heaped over the {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}} to seal in the heat to cook the food.\n\n=== {{lang|mi|Marae}} events ===\nLike in pre-European times, {{lang|mi|marae}} continue to be the location of many ceremonial events, including birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries.

Guests will speak formally about the deceased on the {{lang|mi|marae atea}} often referring to tribal history and using humour. Pathos is commonly used to create a feeling of comfort and unity. Speeches are supported by {{lang|mi|waiata}} (songs). The {{lang|mi|whanau}} of the deceased sit by the coffin on the {{lang|mi|wharenui}} porch but do not speak or reply. The family may often hold or display photos of the deceased or important ancestors. A {{lang|mi|tangi}} may go on for several days, especially for a person of great {{lang|mi|mana}}.

Bishop Selwyn took adult M\u0101ori to Sydney where they experienced limited schooling to learn English. When missionaries back in arrived in the Bay of Islands they realised that if they were going to introduce Christianity and change what they considered to be barbaric practices like cannibalism, slavery, lewd dancing and having multiple wives, they would need to establish schools. Both the missionaries and their wives constructed schools and provided slates and bibles as reading material. The first school was established by T. Kendal in 1816. Recently original slates and written material from that period in the Bay of Islands has been located, photographed and published. Some adults attended school but most pupils were the sons or daughter of chiefs or other persons of status.\n\nBy 1853 Mr and Mrs Ashwell had been running a mission school at Taupiri in the Waikato for 50 M\u0101ori girls for 3 years. The girls learnt arithmetic and reading.<ref>Voyagers.p63. P. Moon. Penguin. 2014.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} In the early 1860s Governor Grey had provided money to support a trade school near Te Awamutu in the Waikato. The aim was to produce M\u0101ori workers who were literate but could also work with, and repair, agricultural machinery as used on farms and in the new flour mills. In 1863 the renegade Rewi Maniapoto attacked and burnt down the school, stealing the printing press. He aimed to kill leading Europeans in the area but they had been warned by friendly M\u0101ori and left before the attack. Because of the negative influence of Maniapoto and other anti-government factions, the school had previously had poor attendance, with as few as 10 boys attending regularly. All teaching by missionaries was in M\u0101ori and this continued in the native schools until 1900 when at the insistence of the Young M\u0101ori Party M\u0101ori MPs, schools started teaching in English. Influential M\u0101ori MPs [[\u0100pirana Ngata|Ngata]] and [[M\u0101ui P\u014dmare|P\u014dmare]] insisted that M\u0101ori be taught modern ways and sponsored the Suppression of Tohungaism Act in parliament.

During summer sea fish such as kahawai were caught using bone or {{lang|mi|[[Lygodium articulatum|mangemange]]}} hooks, 2-piece lures or large flax nets. In creeks and lakes, eels were caught in large numbers when migrating along known waterways using {{lang|mi|hinaki}}, a long cone-shaped net. Birds such as ducks were targeted during the moulting season and young birds such as Petrels and Gannets were taken from nests and cooked in their own fat to preserve them. Such preserved birds were favourite gifts to fulfil social gift obligations. M\u0101ori closely observed the natural world to take advantage of seasonal opportunities. Native pigeons ate [[Miro (tree)|miro]] berries which made them thirsty. M\u0101ori carved wooden bowls equipped with multiple neck snares and placed these in miro trees to catch these large birds.\n\nEvidence from many recent Eastern Golden Bay excavations, especially at Tata Beach, shows that in middens local shellfish and fish bones were most prominent, followed by dog ({{lang|mi|kur\u012b}}) bones and rat bones. Less common were bones from small birds and sea mammals. The Tata Beach site and other nearby sites such as Takapou were in use from 1450 up to 1660 AD, well into the Classic period. The coastal sites showed that M\u0101ori had created man-made soils in the sand dunes ranging from small to very large (over 100m<sup>2</sup>). The natural soil A horizons had been modified by placing dark, humus-rich soil near the surface.<ref name=\"gardensofrongo\">{{cite journal|last=Barber|first=Ian|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=53|date=Dec 2012|title=Gardens of Rongo|doi=10.1086/667834}}</ref> This practice was widespread in M\u0101ori communities where k\u016bmara was grown, although in many cases free-draining sand, gravels and pumice were mixed with humus-rich loam. K\u016bmara are slow-growing in the temperate NZ climate and need free-draining subsoils. In the Eastern Golden Bay north-facing slopes were favoured.<ref name=\"gardensofrongo\" />\n\nThe warmer climate of the north and northern and central coastal regions allowed better growth of subtropical plants such as k\u016bmara, yam and gourds. In Auckland, and on Mayor Island, volcanic land was cleared of rocks which were used for low shelter walls. In some areas piles of volcanic rock which kept warm at night, were used to train the vines of gourds.\n\nMany special techniques had been devised to grow and especially to store k\u016bmara so it did not rot. Careful storage and use of {{lang|mi|tapu}} was essential to prevent unauthorised use. Seed k\u016bmara in particular were highly {{lang|mi|tapu}}. The main problem for k\u016bmara growers were native caterpillars. Early European explorers reported that M\u0101ori often ringed a garden with burning vegetation in an attempt to control caterpillars. M\u0101ori continued to use traditional fern roots \u2014 {{lang|mi|aruhe}} \u2014 as a normal part of their diet into the mid-19th century.\n\n=== Introduced foods ===\nThe introduction of European foods changed many aspects of M\u0101ori agriculture. Under tradition, M\u0101ori agriculture land was abandoned after a few crops because of reduced production. This was the common pattern apart from a few very fertile alluvial river valleys. Fertiliser was not used{{sfn|Belgrave|2013|page=110}} although M\u0101ori had devised various techniques to enhance production such as the addition of pumice or similar materials to improve drainage on heavy soils. M\u0101ori allowed gardens to revert to shrubs and plantations were shifted to another area. The introduction of foreign weeds which thrived was a significant issue from the 1820s but offset by the widespread growth of the introduced potato, the traditional varieties of which are still grown and known as {{lang|mi|taewa}} or [[M\u0101ori potatoes]].\n\nEuropean farms and the methods they used became a cultural and economic magnet for M\u0101ori{{sfn|Belgrave|2013|page=110}} in the North, in Auckland and later in the Te Awamutu area of the Waikato. Under the tuition of missionaries, M\u0101ori learnt to mass-produce food, especially potatoes, far in excess of their own needs for trading into the late 1850s. In 1858 European numbers equalled M\u0101ori numbers and increasingly European farmers were able to supply towns such as Auckland. At the same time the strong market demand for supplying food to the gold rush markets in Australia and California ended.\n\n== Trade and travel ==\n\n===Transport===\n{{main|Waka (canoe)}}\n[[File:Abaconda New Zealand maori waka.jpg|thumb|{{lang|mi|[[Waka (canoe)|Waka]]}} (canoes) are built in a variety of sizes depending on their purpose, including deep-sea fishing, river crossings or historically war and migration.]]\nThe normal M\u0101ori method of travel was on foot. The North Island had an extensive network of single lane one metre wide tracks that traversed beaches, plains, valleys and mountain passes. Some of these tracks were used by many {{lang|mi|iwi}} and were considered neutral territory. Missionaries who travelled with M\u0101ori guides found that at river crossings canoes were left for the use of any traveller.<ref>Tainui. L. Kelly.2002.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Between 1840 and 1850 numbers of explorers, artists, government officials including Governor Grey travelled inland with the aid of M\u0101ori guides. The guides carried heavy loads and would carry Europeans across creeks. Crossing swamps was common. Although they carried some food they relied on purchasing basic foodstuffs such as potatoes or native pigeons from M\u0101ori settlements. The most popular payment was in tobacco which was in great demand. In more remote areas travellers sometimes found M\u0101ori living by themselves and growing a few potatoes.<ref>Voyages. P. Moon.

Te Rauparah\u0101 later hired a European ship to attack Akaroa Harbour.{{sfn|King|2003}} This showed that Te Rauparaha was prepared to use Western technology to further his own  goals. [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]], who followed several war parties, reported as many as 50 waka taua travelling together at one time, although he reported they only went out to sea in relatively calm weather. From 1835 large numbers of European ships entered the Bay of Islands every year with Henry Williams reporting an average of 70\u201380 ships per year. Many M\u0101ori men worked on the ships, with a reported average of eight M\u0101ori seamen per whaling ship. Ten metre long whaleboats began to be used by M\u0101ori. They could be both rowed and sailed.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012}} In the 1850s as M\u0101ori with the active encouragement of Grey embraced trade were gradually able to develop a large fleet of small trading schooners and similar craft. All the initial European centres had been supported by Maori.\n\n[[File:Maori war canoe, drawing by Alexander Sporing.jpg|thumb|Maori war canoe, drawing by Alexander Sporing, [[First voyage of James Cook|Cook's first voyage]], 1769]]\nDuring the mid 19th century Auckland and Northland M\u0101ori dominated shipping trade. In 1851 51 vessels were registered and 30 smaller vessels licensed. By 1857 there were 37 schooners. The fleet increased steadily during the Tasman trade boom of 1853\u201356. M\u0101ori paid customs duties to the government and invested heavily in vessels, so suffered considerably when a dramatic market slump hit New Zealand especially effecting the Auckland\u2013Waikato\u2013Hauraki area.<ref>Climates of War.

The period 1835 to 1840 completed the revolution in the north M\u0101ori economy with M\u0101ori abandoning many of their former trading habits and adopting those of the Europeans to the point where M\u0101ori became dependent on the flow of European goods to maintain their new way of life.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|pages=130\u2013135}}\n \nThe effect of trading increased the influence of chiefs over their {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}}. Northern traders assumed that the chief was the organisational head of the {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} and all trade went through him including payments for goods purchased. This gave chiefs much more influence, especially after 1835, because trade was so regular. In pre-contact times the power of chiefs was never very great, largely being restricted to directing warfare.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=203}} Early European observers noted that at {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} and {{lang|mi|whanuau hui}} (meetings) every person, including women, had their say and the chief had no more influence than any other person on the final decision. Where a chief had great {{lang|mi|mana}}, especially powers of persuasion, chiefs had more influence because of their personality rather than any recognised authority.\n \nNot all {{lang|mi|iwi}} had regular contact with Europeans. The French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville visited Tasman Bay in 1827 and using knowledge he had picked up at the Bay of Islands was able to communicate with local M\u0101ori. He found that although they had some passing awareness of Europeans\u2014they seemed to know about firearms\u2014the extent of their understanding was far less than that of the Northern M\u0101ori.{{sfn|Moon|2012|page=128}}\n\nIn the Waikato regular contact did not start until five decades after contact in the north of New Zealand. It was not until Ng\u0101ti Toa was forced out of Kawhia in 1821 that the bulk of the Tainui people had contact with Europeans. In 1823 a man called Te Puaha visited the Bay of Islands, bringing back with him Captain Kent who arrived by ship at Kawhia.\n\nBy 1859 trade was the main area in which M\u0101ori interacted with Europeans. Trade was an area that M\u0101ori expected to control. From first contact, they had sold or exchanged fresh foodstuffs initially for high-value goods such as axes and later for money. George Grey was keen to encourage M\u0101ori trade and commerce and established new laws to empower them in 1846. M\u0101ori brought numerous cases under this legislation and won. This was their first and most successful legal experience.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burke|first=E.|title=Climates of War|year=2005|publisher=Hazard Press|page=36}}</ref> M\u0101ori had begun to include European concepts into their own cultural behaviour. In 1886 banknotes were printed (but not issued) by Te Peeke o Aotearoa, a bank established by [[T\u0101whiao]] the [[M\u0101ori King Movement|M\u0101ori King]]. The text on these notes was M\u0101ori and there was also a picture of a flax bush. The bank's cheques had M\u0101ori figures and native birds and plants drawn on them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/213266|title=1. \u2013 Coins and banknotes \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Land negotiations ===\n{{main|M\u0101ori Land Court|Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements}}\nThe M\u0101ori relationship with the land is complex. Traditionally the resources the land held were controlled based on systems of {{lang|mi|mana}} (power) and {{lang|mi|whakapapa}} (ancestral right). The land itself was both sacred and abstract. In many cases multiple groups would express a connection with the same important river or mountain. Oral tradition would record the migrations of groups from one area to another and their connection with an ancestral location.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn the early 19th century many Europeans entered into dealings with M\u0101ori to obtain land for their use. In some cases settlers thought they were buying land to obtain equivalent to freehold title under British law; M\u0101ori claimed that the various deeds signed by M\u0101ori were more limited and conditional, stopping short of outright alienation. It has been argued that the use of the word {{lang|mi|tuku}} in deeds, meaning to let or allow or give freely, was not the same as selling. This and other interpretations of early 19th century New Zealand land deals have been the source of much disagreement both within the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] process and outside it.<ref>Waitangi Tribunal, [https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/WT/wt_DOC_68635760/Muriwhenua%20Land.pdf Muriwhenua Land Report], p. 394</ref>{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=147}}\n\nM\u0101ori, especially after 1830, were eager to have Europeans living on their land under their protection so they could benefit from European knowledge and trade. Missionaries on the other hand were keen to buy land so they could grow their own food to make them less dependent on tribal \"protectors\", who sometimes used food supplies to coerce them. Settlers allowed M\u0101ori to stay on the land they had \"bought\" and often continued to give presents to tribal chiefs, often prompted by the chiefs themselves, in order to maintain friendly relationships. These compromises stopped with the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=147}}\n\nAnother reason for M\u0101ori to \"sell\" land to missionaries was to protect the title of the land from other tribal competitors. M\u0101ori who had converted to Christianity wanted to protect their land without resorting to warfare. Some degree of control passed to the missionaries who M\u0101ori trusted to allow them continued access and use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treatyofwaitangi.net.nz/WhyaTreaty.html|title=The Treaty of Waitangi|website=www.treatyofwaitangi.net.nz|access-date=2017-07-27}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1840 generally, older chiefs were reluctant to sell while younger chiefs were in favour. The situation was complicated as M\u0101ori often had overlapping rights on poorly defined land. The settlers and the government also had very limited access to trained surveyors and even freehold land boundaries were ill-defined. Surveying was a relatively new skill and involved much hard physical work especially in hill country. New farmers were able to purchase a small freehold farm from M\u0101ori on which they established their homestead and farm buildings. They then entered into leases with M\u0101ori owners for much larger areas of land. Short-term leases gave M\u0101ori a powerful position as there was a large demand for grazing land.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe Native Lands Act was a policy enforced by the government in 1865, which allowed the M\u0101ori people to obtain individual titles for their land to sell. This act abolished the traditional shared landholdings and made it easier for European settlers to directly purchase land for themselves.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sorrenson|first=M. P.

These claims against the government were to become a major feature of {{lang|mi|iwi}} politics. Each generation of leaders were judged based on their ability to progress a land claim.{{sfn|Belgrave|2013}}\n\n== Leadership and politics ==\n{{see also|M\u0101ori politics}}\n\n=== M\u0101ori kingship ===\n{{Main|M\u0101ori King Movement}}\nFrom the time of their arrival in New Zealand, M\u0101ori lived in tribes that functioned independently under the leadership of their own chiefs. However, by the 1850s M\u0101ori were faced with increasing numbers of British settlers, political marginalisation and growing demand from the Crown to purchase their lands. From about 1853 M\u0101ori began reviving the ancient tribal {{lang|mi|runanga}} or chiefly war councils where land issues were raised and in May 1854 a large meeting \u2014 attracting as many as 2000 M\u0101ori leaders \u2014 was held at Manawapou in south Taranaki where speakers urged concerted opposition to selling land.{{sfn|Dalton|1967|pages=62\u201363}} Inspired by a trip to England during which he had met [[Queen Victoria]], Te Rauparaha's son, [[Tamihana Te Rauparaha]], used the {{lang|mi|runanga}} to promote the idea of forming a M\u0101ori kingdom, with one king ruling over all tribes.<ref name=\"sinclair\">{{cite book|last=Sinclair|first=Keith|title=A History of New Zealand|publisher=Penguin|year=2000|isbn=978-0-14-029875-8|edition=2000|location=Auckland|pages=115\u2013117}}</ref> The {{lang|mi|kotahitanga}} or unity movement was aimed at bringing to M\u0101ori the unity that was an obvious strength among the Europeans.{{sfn|Dalton|1967|pages=62\u201363}}<ref name=\"sinclair\" /> It was believed that by having a monarch who could claim status similar to that of Queen Victoria, M\u0101ori would be able to deal with [[P\u0101keh\u0101]] (Europeans) on equal footing.

New Zealand is the southwestern corner of the [[Polynesian Triangle]], a region of the Pacific Ocean with three island groups at its corners: [[Hawaiian Islands]], Rapa Nui ([[Easter Island]]), and New Zealand ([[Aotearoa]] in M\u0101ori).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.maori.com/aotearoa|title=Aotearoa \u2013 The Maori Name for New Zealand|publisher=Maori Tourism Limited|work=www.maori.com|language=en-NZ|access-date=2017-07-27}}</ref> The many island cultures within the Polynesian Triangle share similar languages derived from a [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|proto-Malayo-Polynesian language]] used in southeastern Asia 5,000 years ago.

Other main Polynesian cultures include: [[Easter Island|Rapa Nui]] (now known as Easter Island), [[Hawaii]], [[Marquesas]], [[Samoa]], [[Tahiti]], [[Tonga]], and [[Cook Islands]]. Over the last five millennia, a sequence of complicated and remarkable transoceanic treks were performed in an unprecedented accomplishment of navigation and curiosity. The final segments of these feats were across extreme and unmatched distances: to Hawaii, Rapa Nui, and Aotearoa.<ref>{{cite book|last=Somerville|first=Alice Te Punga|title=Once Were Pacific: Maori Connections to Oceania|year=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|page=17}}</ref>\n\nPolynesian seafarers were ocean navigators and [[astronomy|astronomers]]. Polynesians would travel long distances by sea. The strong female presence among early settlers in New Zealand suggests Polynesian migration voyages were not accidental but deliberate.

Many edible plants were brought from the home islands and of these [[Sweet potato|''k\u016bmara'' (sweet potato)]] was to become the most important. In the far South, however, it was too cold to grow any of these crops. Large quantities of [[Cordyline australis|t\u012b]] tubers were eaten that were slow-cooked in large {{lang|mi|umu}} or {{lang|mi|[[h\u0101ngi]]}} (earth ovens) to get rid of the poison and to produce a slightly sweet pulp. Shellfish, fish, sharks and seals were also common foods. Native dogs ({{lang|mi|kur\u012b}}) and rats were brought from the Pacific Islands. The introduction of rats undoubtedly had more impact on New Zealand wildlife than any other organism apart from humans.<ref name=\"campbell&hutchings\" /> The dogs were used for hunting but also as food.<ref>Irwin pp 10\u201314.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe new environment offered challenges to the settlers. Its cold climate meant that tropical staple crops needed careful cultivation to survive, and some failed to grow locally. [[Sweet potato|K\u016bmara]] was an important crop that arrived with the Polynesian settlers. Much of the activity to produce k\u016bmara became ritualised \u2013 it was even associated with Rongom\u0101t\u0101ne (Rongo), a high-ranking {{lang|mi|atua}} (god).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/kumara/page-4|title=K\u016bmara \u2013 Religious aspects|last=Adds|first=Peter|encyclopedia=Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=1 November 2013}}</ref> K\u016bmara featured in some {{lang|mi|whakatauk\u012b}} (proverbs): \"{{lang|mi|Kaore te k\u016bmara e k\u014drero mo t\u014dna m\u0101ngaro}}\" (the k\u016bmara does not speak of its own sweetness) encouraged people to be modest.\n\nSeasonal activities included gardening, fishing and the hunting of birds. Main tasks were segregated for men and women, but there were also a lot of group activities involving food gathering and food cultivation.\n\nThese early colonists explored New Zealand to find suitable stones for tool-making. The main stone source areas included [[Mayor Island]], Taupo and Kerikeri for [[obsidian]] (volcanic glass); prospectors soon found {{lang|mi|[[pounamu]]}} (greenstone or [[jade]]) and {{lang|mi|pakohe}} ([[argillite]]) resources in the South Island in the Reefton and Nelson areas.<ref name=\"DNZB Duff\" /> Basalt was later also found which is prospected to have a use in construction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/publications/factsheets/rare-ecosystems/subterranean-or-semi-subterranean/subterranean-basalt-fields|title=Subterranean basalt fields|website=Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> Stone served in all aspects of Polynesian life: from chopping wood to cutting and slicing food, as anchors for {{lang|mi|waka}} (canoes) and fishing nets, for retaining the heat in a {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}}, as drills using chert, and for stone clubs.

It was this adaptation to the opportunities and challenges of the new environment that lead to the development of the Classic M\u0101ori culture.\n\n=== Classic period c.1500 AD ===\n[[File:Hinepare.jpg|alt=|thumb|Traditional formal dress of the Classic/contact period.

[[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]] estimated there were only 1100 Europeans in the North Island in 1839, with 200 being missionaries, and a total of about 500\u2013600 Europeans in the Bay of Islands.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=101}} The northern M\u0101ori population at the time has been estimated at about 30,000 to 40,000, down from about 100,000, fifty years before.<ref name=\":1\" /> This drop in population was mostly due to [[Measles|disease]] and the [[Musket Wars]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/171949|title=2. \u2013 Taupori M\u0101ori \u2013 M\u0101ori population change \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref>\n\nFor decades, European missionaries, mostly living in the north of the North Island, had very little influence over M\u0101ori behaviour. Missionaries report being appalled at the violent, seemingly arbitrary nature of M\u0101ori behaviour. This included warfare, slavery, cannibalism, sexual abuse of women, killing of female children and revenge killings. However, by 1840, many of these customs were all but abolished or not publicly practised.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=220}}\n\nIn the coastal South Island, the M\u0101ori population was very small. Whalers set up shore stations along the southern and eastern coasts and formed M\u0101ori\u2013European working communities. In the early 1800s, it was common for chiefs to provide whalers with M\u0101ori wives, often their daughters. By the 1820s, European men had married about 200 M\u0101ori women in the coastal area between modern Christchurch and Invercargill, about half of all the marriageable aged women in the South Island \u2013 in fact, M\u0101ori men were finding it hard to compete for wives.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=320}}\n\nContact with Europeans enabled M\u0101ori to access the material culture of England, then the most advanced industrial nation in the world. By 1800, the desire for iron objects such as large ships' nails overcame apprehension about boarding an anchored ship and this drove M\u0101ori trading behaviour, lasting until 1840.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=32}} Desirable steel objects and blankets were at first traded for fish. M\u0101ori were generally very curious about European culture after initial misunderstandings and apprehension, with M\u0101ori showing great ability to accept changes and integrating these into their normal way of life{{sfn|O'Malley|2012}}<ref>''Climates of War''. E. Bohan. p 29</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Marion Du Fresne gave northern M\u0101ori potatoes, wheat, onions, goats, pigs, chickens and other food to raise. Potatoes and pigs rapidly became a key part of M\u0101ori agriculture in the north, but the new food was almost exclusively reserved for trading purposes, with M\u0101ori still eating fish and fern roots, supplemented by [[k\u016bmara]]. Later, as M\u0101ori grew large areas of potatoes (Hongi Hika had a 40-acre potato field), whalers would call into the Bay of Islands, in particular, to trade for fresh supplies.\n\nOne significant change was the immediacy of reciprocation in trade. In tradition M\u0101ori tikanga, when an item was given there was no expectation of immediate response as gifted items were mainly food, which was governed by seasonal supply. When dealing with Europeans, M\u0101ori learnt that immediate payment was expected. Gift giving was a different matter in M\u0101ori culture. Gifts were given to recognise {{lang|mi|mana}} (power or authority).{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=112}}\n\nBurial practices also changed to incorporate aspects of Christianity. Bodies were usually buried in the ground by the mid 1840s although sometimes coffins, decorated with M\u0101ori motifs were used, suspended in trees or on poles as drawn by J. Polack.

In 1900 few M\u0101ori lived in European urban settlements. This changed very slowly. There were only 1,766 M\u0101ori in Auckland in 1935. In 1936 only 11.2% of M\u0101ori lived in urban areas. By 1945 this had risen to 19% and by 1971 to 68%. These changes reflect a significant alteration in the basis for income and employment \u2013 from working on rural land to working mainly in construction, freezing works or labouring. The dominant factors influencing this shift were the burgeoning M\u0101ori population and the inability of the land to support the increasing population.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, MP Ngata had passed land legislation to help M\u0101ori make better use of their remaining tribal land. M\u0101ori were handicapped in using and developing the land for modern agriculture as much M\u0101ori land was steep, remote, erosion-prone with high rainfall.{{sfn|King|2001|pages=101\u2013107}} European farmers who owned their land freehold mechanised to gain higher productivity, using bank loans for the new equipment. M\u0101ori were unable to gain loans as their land was generally tribal land and could not be used for securing individual loans. Leasing land to European farmers gave M\u0101ori a steady income but this was spread among many people. M\u0101ori farming was often based on a different system of values and not driven by European goals of efficiency and high productivity.{{sfn|King|2001|page=103}}\n\nApart from jobs, another attraction to urban migration were the monetary, recreational and lifestyle attractions of the city. Many M\u0101ori felt that success lay in the city rather than the country. King describes this as a \"fantasy contagion-the realty did not live up to the myth but this did not stop the fantasy or the migration\".{{sfn|King|2001|page=104}}\nOther changes were a rising birth rate. In 1955, the M\u0101ori birth rate was nearly double the European rate at 43.6 compared to 26 per 1000. At the same time, M\u0101ori had fewer qualifications. In 1956 6.5% of M\u0101ori held professional, managerial or clerical jobs compared to 26.7% non-M\u0101ori. As a result, only 3.36% of M\u0101ori earned 700 pounds or more per annum compared to 18.6% for non-M\u0101ori.{{sfn|King|2001|page=105}} M\u0101ori were significantly impacted by changing economic circumstances such as the drop in wool prices. This made M\u0101ori more vulnerable to economic and social deprivation. King says that the lower M\u0101ori educational attainment lead to lower income jobs, which led to lower income, poor housing, and poor health, which in turn led to higher rates of crime.{{sfn|King|2001|page=105}}\n\nThese ingredients were potential causes of racial tension. They were seen by the wider community as \"M\u0101ori problems\". By the 1970s and 1980s, enough urbanised M\u0101ori had reached positions of influence to bring about a gradual but radical change to the thinking of governments. Their advocacy was underscored by an increasing willingness to use [[M\u0101ori protest movement|vigorous protest to push Mana M\u0101ori]].

The expression, an abstraction of the word for aristocracy, had been coined by Henry Williams in the Treaty of Waitangi to convey the idea of \"chieftainship\".

Mana is sacred power bestowed by the gods on the ancestral lineage of chiefs, or {{lang|mi|tohunga}}. While the {{lang|mi|mana}} itself is a supernatural gift, the chief is free to waste or magnify it.{{sfn|Mol|1981|page=15}} Historian Judith Binney says that maintaining and increasing the {{lang|mi|mana}} of {{lang|mi|whanau}} and {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} and loyalty within the group is unquestionably at the heart of M\u0101ori cultural concepts. She says that M\u0101ori cultural history is confusing to the uninformed as it consists of narrative-myths that stretch far back in time. Also confusing is that chronological time is irrelevant or distorted<ref>Stories Without End. J. Binney, p 182</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} to the M\u0101ori cultural story, so a person living in the present may narrate a story about their family or hap\u016b that happened centuries ago; nonetheless, the narrator appears as a contemporary figure in the myth.\n\nA key element of cultural leadership is to link the narrator to a well known historical figure with mana (prestige/authority power).<ref>Stories Without End, J Binney, pp. 78\u201385</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} This is why being able to recite the family history is so important. In M\u0101ori culture names of people and places are fluid. Individuals may change their name several times or have several different names that they use depending on the cultural situation. In the past, hap\u016b changed names if they moved to another area where an alternative name was more positive. One of the main reasons for name fluidity was access to resources. As a hap\u016b moved seasonally to utilise different resources its name changed to reflect an ancestor who had historical-cultural rights to that resource. Binney says that being connected to a powerful hap\u016b with many well-known ancestors was important for protection and survival. As M\u0101ori communication was almost totally oral until well into the contact period, oral myth-narratives became more varied to match the needs of each hap\u016b or whanau.\n\n=== {{lang|mi|Whakapapa}} (genealogy) ===\n{{lang|mi|[[Whakapapa]]}} is the origin and path of descent of a person, object or geographic area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/whakapapa-genealogy|title=Whakapapa \u2013 genealogy \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-12}}</ref> A person's {{lang|mi|whakapapa}} establishes their mana and tribal connections.

In the concept of {{lang|mi|utu}}, a fault must always be corrected and a kindness repaid.{{sfn|King|2003|page=81}} However, the means by which this is accomplished may vary greatly by case. In the context of a gift exchange, {{lang|mi|utu}} creates and preserves social connections and commitments. {{lang|mi|Utu}} recovers balance in the event that social relations are interrupted. A version of {{lang|mi|utu}}, {{lang|mi|muru}}, is defined as the confiscation of a person's possessions as reparation for a misdeed against an individual, community, or society.<ref>\"The Boyd Incident,\" Ministry for Culture and Heritage, 20 December 2012, retrieved on 10 April 2018.</ref>{{cnf|January 2020}}\n\nGift exchange was governed by three basic principles. Firstly giving had to have the appearance of being free and spontaneous, without stipulation of a return present. Secondly, a strict system of obligation was in force whereby the receiver was bound to not only reciprocate but to increase the value of the reciprocated gift. Thirdly the system demanded that further social obligation had now been established to continue the exchanges. Failure to respond meant loss of mana or influence. Where parties had travelled a long way to give a present it was expected that the return gift be immediate but often due to seasonal food supplies it was accepted that a return gift would be given at some later date when supplies allowed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Firth|first=R.|title=Primitive Economics of the New Zealand Maori|year=1929}}</ref> While a gift conveyed an obligation to return the favour, so did an insult.

The {{lang|mi|marae}} symbolises group unity and generally consists of an open cleared area in front of a large carved meeting house, along with a dining hall and other facilities necessary to provide a comfortable stay for visiting groups. On the {{lang|mi|marae}} official functions take place including formal welcomes, celebrations, weddings, christenings, reunions, and {{lang|mi|[[tangihanga]]}} (funerals). The older people have the authority on the {{lang|mi|marae}}, and they impart, primarily through [[oral tradition]], traditions and cultural practices to the young people. These include [[genealogy]], [[spirituality]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], and politics, and arts such as [[music composition]], performance, [[weaving]], or carving.\n\nThe {{lang|mi|hui}} or meeting, usually on a marae.

Acceptance of the token in the face of such aggression is a demonstration of the courage and {{lang|mi|[[mana]]}} of the visitor. The {{lang|mi|p\u014dwhiri}} is highly structured, with speeches from both hosts and guests following a traditional format, their sequence dictated by the {{lang|mi|kawa}} (protocol) of that place, and followed by {{lang|mi|[[M\u0101ori music|waiata]]}}, songs. {{lang|mi|Hui}} are held for business, for festivities or for rites of passage such as baptism, marriage and death.

The {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}} consists of a shallow hole dug in the ground, in which a fire is prepared and stones are placed on the top. When the stones are hot, prepared food is placed on top of them, meat first and then vegetables such as k\u016bmara, potatoes and pumpkin. The {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}} is then covered with leaves or mats woven out of {{lang|mi|[[Phormium tenax|harakeke]]}}, or wet sacks, and soil is then heaped over the {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}} to seal in the heat to cook the food.\n\n=== {{lang|mi|Marae}} events ===\nLike in pre-European times, {{lang|mi|marae}} continue to be the location of many ceremonial events, including birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries.

It is normal for M\u0101ori to travel very long distances to attend the {{lang|mi|tangi}} of a loved one. Often black clothes are worn, following Victorian practices. Guests will speak formally about the deceased on the {{lang|mi|marae atea}} often referring to tribal history and using humour. Pathos is commonly used to create a feeling of comfort and unity. Speeches are supported by {{lang|mi|waiata}} (songs). The {{lang|mi|whanau}} of the deceased sit by the coffin on the {{lang|mi|wharenui}} porch but do not speak or reply. The family may often hold or display photos of the deceased or important ancestors. A {{lang|mi|tangi}} may go on for several days, especially for a person of great {{lang|mi|mana}}.

Heating was provided by a small open fire in winter. There was no chimney.\n\nMaterial used in construction varied between areas, but raupo reeds, flax and totara bark shingles for the roof were common.<ref>Te Papa Museum of NZ. Wharepuni.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Similar small {{lang|mi|whare}}, but with interior drains, were used to store k\u016bmara on sloping racks.\n\nIn the classic period a higher proportion of {{lang|mi|whare}} were located inside {{lang|mi|p\u0101}} than was the case after contact with Europeans. A chief's {{lang|mi|whare}} was similar but larger \u2014 often with full headroom in the centre, a small window and a partly enclosed front porch. In times of conflict the chief lived in a {{lang|mi|whare}} on the {{lang|mi|tihi}} or summit of a hill {{lang|mi|p\u0101}}. In colder areas, such as in the North Island central plateau, it was common for {{lang|mi|whare}} to be partly sunk into the ground for better insulation.\n\nFood was not cooked in the sleeping {{lang|mi|whare}} but in the open or under a {{lang|mi|kauta}} (lean-to). Saplings with branches and foliage removed were used to store and dry items such as fishing nets or cloaks. Valuable items were stored in pole-mounted storage shelters called {{lang|mi|pataka}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=John|author-link=John White (ethnographer)|title=The Ancient History of the Maori, His Mythology and Traditions|volume=V1|year=1888|publisher=Pataka.

This practice was done in order to express the buildings' significance and to secure the gods' protection. For smaller buildings, small animals were sacrificed to distinguish it from other buildings and to exhibit its uniqueness.{{sfn|Mol|1981|page=13}}\n\nThe traditional M\u0101ori {{lang|mi|whare}} continued to be used in rural areas in particular well into the post-contact period.

In the 19th century settlements were {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}}-based, and 5 buildings became standardised: the sleeping {{lang|mi|whare}}, {{lang|mi|kauta}} or communal cookhouse/shelter, {{lang|mi|whata}} or wood store, {{lang|mi|pataka}} or storehouse, and increasingly from the 1870s {{lang|mi|wharepuni}} or community meeting house. Significant finance and {{lang|mi|mana}} was invested in increasingly elaborate meeting houses which became a source of {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} or {{lang|mi|iwi}} pride and prestige.\n\nA meeting house was likely to have outside carvings and increasingly as European tools were used, intricate interior carving and woven panels depicting tribal history. Rotorua became a centre of carving excellence under the encouragement of the M\u0101ori MPs in the Young M\u0101ori party. Itinerant specialist carvers travelled widely, employing their skills in many locations. Meetinghouses became places for tribal celebrations or political meetings, especially after the 1860s Land Wars. They were a place to display largesse and enhance {{lang|mi|mana}} with elaborate feasts and entertainment. By the 20th century {{lang|mi|wharepuni}} were common and averaged 18\u201324m long by 8m wide. There were no M\u0101ori buildings of this size in pre-European days. As M\u0101ori became familiar with European building construction and design they incorporated features such as chimneys and fireplaces and made use of bigger doorways and windows as well as sawn timber but even by the turn of the 19th century toilet facilities were often primitive, despite the urgings of the M\u0101ori MPs Pomare and Ngata who worked hard to improve the standard of M\u0101ori dwellings over their many years in office.{{sfn|King|2001|page=47}}<ref>Maori MPs.NZ History online.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Mythology and religion ==\n{{main|M\u0101ori mythology|M\u0101ori religion|Taniwha}}\n{{Tall image|KupeWheke.jpg|150|300|alt=Tall wooden carving showing Kupe above two tentacled sea creatures|Late 20th-century [[whakairo|carving]] depicting the mythological navigator [[Kupe]] fighting two sea creatures|right}}\nTraditional M\u0101ori religion, has deviated little from its tropical Eastern [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] roots on the island of [[Hawaiki|Hawaiki Nui]].

Classic M\u0101ori did not recognise the symptoms as being from one disease. {{lang|mi|Kohi}} was considered the work of demons and caused by {{lang|mi|[[makutu]]}} (witchcraft).<ref>{{cite book|last=H\u012broa|first=Te Rangi (Sir Peter Buck)|author-link=Te Rangi H\u012broa|title=Medicine Amongst the Maoris, in Ancient and Modern Times|year=1910|section=Tuberculosis|section-url= http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-BucMedi-t1-body-d1-d13-d4.html|pages=72\u201373|accessdate=3 September 2019}}</ref> {{lang|mi|Toketoke}} was the name of the devil that caused tubercular bone disease. Tuberculosis of the neck glands was called {{lang|mi|hura}} or {{lang|mi|hone}}. This was very common. Tubercular ulcers were called {{lang|mi|pokapoka}}. The early European explorer and painter Earle noted in 1827 that these diseases were common even in isolated inland districts such as Taupo. His M\u0101ori advisers said the diseases were very old.\n\nEarle recognised that {{lang|mi|tohunga}} used a range of plants to treat minor skin ailments. Much later European doctors advocated investigation of the medicinal properties of plants commonly used in M\u0101ori medicine.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Missionaries===\n[[File:Whare Karakia o Onuku.jpg|thumb|Church near Onuku marae, Banks Peninsula. Opened in 1878 as the first non-denominational church in New Zealand.]]\nCMS missionaries insisted M\u0101ori abandon cannibalism and child infanticide before they could be baptised. They tried to discourage polygamy. Some early missionaries had sympathy for abandoned wives but Henry Williams was adamant that polygamy disqualified M\u0101ori from baptism. CMS missionaries also outlawed the use of further {{lang|mi|moko}}, taking part in lewd dances and practising customary funeral rites.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=175}} Catholic missionaries who arrived 20 years after the Church of England CMS missionaries were less concerned with stopping these customary practices before Christian conversion. They reasoned that they could influence M\u0101ori more effectively after baptism and were subsequently successful in attracting many converts in the western Hokianga district, away from the dominant CMS influence.\n\nMissionaries did not arrive in the Waikato until about 1834\u20135. CMS Mission Stations were established at Manakau, Maraetai, Waikato Heads, Kaitotehe opposite Tuapiri, Te Awamutu, Kopua and Kawhia. Missionaries helped explain the Treaty of Waitangi to Tainui in 1840.\n\n=== First M\u0101ori interpretation of Christianity===\nIn the 1830s Te Atua Wera started the Papahurihia Faith in opposition to the missionaries. It mixed Christian, Judaic and M\u0101ori customary influences. They held services on Saturday and called themselves {{lang|mi|Hurai}} or Jews. Te Atua Wera reverted to the more customary role of a {{lang|mi|tohunga}} figure by the late 1830s. Te Atua Wera taught that heaven was a place where there was happiness, no cold or hunger with an abundance of flour, sugar, muskets, ships, murder and voluptuousness.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=175}}\n\n== Children and education ==\n[[File:SwingAngas1847.JPG|thumb|A group of M\u0101ori children on a morere swing (1847)]]\n\n=== Childhood ===\nEarly European reports suggest that M\u0101ori children were indulged and led a carefree and playful life. A French explorer in 1772 commented that \"[the women] seemed to be good mothers and showed affection for their offspring. I have often seen them play with the children, caress them, chew the fern-root, pick at the stringy parts, and then take it out of their mouth to put it into that of their nurslings. The men were also very fond of and kind to their children.\"{{sfn|Salmond|1991|page=422}} French missionary Jean-Simon Bernard wrote, disapprovingly, in 1844: \"The children here are completely free; the parents never do anything to them. They never beat them and do not allow anyone else to beat them.\"{{sfn|Salmond|1991|page=422}} The killing of children could be the ''take'' (cause) of war.

Bishop Selwyn took adult M\u0101ori to Sydney where they experienced limited schooling to learn English. When missionaries back in arrived in the Bay of Islands they realised that if they were going to introduce Christianity and change what they considered to be barbaric practices like cannibalism, slavery, lewd dancing and having multiple wives, they would need to establish schools. Both the missionaries and their wives constructed schools and provided slates and bibles as reading material. The first school was established by T. Kendal in 1816. Recently original slates and written material from that period in the Bay of Islands has been located, photographed and published. Some adults attended school but most pupils were the sons or daughter of chiefs or other persons of status.\n\nBy 1853 Mr and Mrs Ashwell had been running a mission school at Taupiri in the Waikato for 50 M\u0101ori girls for 3 years. The girls learnt arithmetic and reading.<ref>Voyagers.p63. P. Moon. Penguin. 2014.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} In the early 1860s Governor Grey had provided money to support a trade school near Te Awamutu in the Waikato. The aim was to produce M\u0101ori workers who were literate but could also work with, and repair, agricultural machinery as used on farms and in the new flour mills. In 1863 the renegade Rewi Maniapoto attacked and burnt down the school, stealing the printing press. He aimed to kill leading Europeans in the area but they had been warned by friendly M\u0101ori and left before the attack. Because of the negative influence of Maniapoto and other anti-government factions, the school had previously had poor attendance, with as few as 10 boys attending regularly. All teaching by missionaries was in M\u0101ori and this continued in the native schools until 1900 when at the insistence of the Young M\u0101ori Party M\u0101ori MPs, schools started teaching in English. Influential M\u0101ori MPs [[\u0100pirana Ngata|Ngata]] and [[M\u0101ui P\u014dmare|P\u014dmare]] insisted that M\u0101ori be taught modern ways and sponsored the Suppression of Tohungaism Act in parliament. P\u014dmare, in particular, worked hard to banish ancient M\u0101ori concepts and practices that caused harm in the M\u0101ori community.<ref>The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, Maui Pomare.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Food ==\n[[File:Mount hobson Auckland kumara pits.jpg|thumb|Pits where kumara were stored to protect them over the winter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/218774|title=K\u016bmara storage pits, 1930|last=Godber|first=Albert Percy|publisher= New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|work=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref>|alt=|260x260px]]\n[[File:Maori earth oven.svg|thumb|{{lang|mi|H\u0101ngi}} or earth ovens are still used today to cook food|alt=|260x260px]]\n{{See also|M\u0101ori cuisine|H\u0101ngi}}\n\n=== Traditional M\u0101ori foods ===\nEating shellfish such as mussels and oysters was very common. During summer sea fish such as kahawai were caught using bone or {{lang|mi|[[Lygodium articulatum|mangemange]]}} hooks, 2-piece lures or large flax nets. In creeks and lakes, eels were caught in large numbers when migrating along known waterways using {{lang|mi|hinaki}}, a long cone-shaped net. Birds such as ducks were targeted during the moulting season and young birds such as Petrels and Gannets were taken from nests and cooked in their own fat to preserve them. Such preserved birds were favourite gifts to fulfil social gift obligations. M\u0101ori closely observed the natural world to take advantage of seasonal opportunities. Native pigeons ate [[Miro (tree)|miro]] berries which made them thirsty. M\u0101ori carved wooden bowls equipped with multiple neck snares and placed these in miro trees to catch these large birds.\n\nEvidence from many recent Eastern Golden Bay excavations, especially at Tata Beach, shows that in middens local shellfish and fish bones were most prominent, followed by dog ({{lang|mi|kur\u012b}}) bones and rat bones. Less common were bones from small birds and sea mammals. The Tata Beach site and other nearby sites such as Takapou were in use from 1450 up to 1660 AD, well into the Classic period. The coastal sites showed that M\u0101ori had created man-made soils in the sand dunes ranging from small to very large (over 100m<sup>2</sup>). The natural soil A horizons had been modified by placing dark, humus-rich soil near the surface.<ref name=\"gardensofrongo\">{{cite journal|last=Barber|first=Ian|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=53|date=Dec 2012|title=Gardens of Rongo|doi=10.1086/667834}}</ref> This practice was widespread in M\u0101ori communities where k\u016bmara was grown, although in many cases free-draining sand, gravels and pumice were mixed with humus-rich loam. K\u016bmara are slow-growing in the temperate NZ climate and need free-draining subsoils. In the Eastern Golden Bay north-facing slopes were favoured.<ref name=\"gardensofrongo\" />\n\nThe warmer climate of the north and northern and central coastal regions allowed better growth of subtropical plants such as k\u016bmara, yam and gourds. In Auckland, and on Mayor Island, volcanic land was cleared of rocks which were used for low shelter walls. In some areas piles of volcanic rock which kept warm at night, were used to train the vines of gourds.\n\nMany special techniques had been devised to grow and especially to store k\u016bmara so it did not rot. Careful storage and use of {{lang|mi|tapu}} was essential to prevent unauthorised use. Seed k\u016bmara in particular were highly {{lang|mi|tapu}}. The main problem for k\u016bmara growers were native caterpillars. Early European explorers reported that M\u0101ori often ringed a garden with burning vegetation in an attempt to control caterpillars. M\u0101ori continued to use traditional fern roots \u2014 {{lang|mi|aruhe}} \u2014 as a normal part of their diet into the mid-19th century.\n\n=== Introduced foods ===\nThe introduction of European foods changed many aspects of M\u0101ori agriculture. Under tradition, M\u0101ori agriculture land was abandoned after a few crops because of reduced production. This was the common pattern apart from a few very fertile alluvial river valleys. Fertiliser was not used{{sfn|Belgrave|2013|page=110}} although M\u0101ori had devised various techniques to enhance production such as the addition of pumice or similar materials to improve drainage on heavy soils. M\u0101ori allowed gardens to revert to shrubs and plantations were shifted to another area. The introduction of foreign weeds which thrived was a significant issue from the 1820s but offset by the widespread growth of the introduced potato, the traditional varieties of which are still grown and known as {{lang|mi|taewa}} or [[M\u0101ori potatoes]].\n\nEuropean farms and the methods they used became a cultural and economic magnet for M\u0101ori{{sfn|Belgrave|2013|page=110}} in the North, in Auckland and later in the Te Awamutu area of the Waikato. Under the tuition of missionaries, M\u0101ori learnt to mass-produce food, especially potatoes, far in excess of their own needs for trading into the late 1850s. In 1858 European numbers equalled M\u0101ori numbers and increasingly European farmers were able to supply towns such as Auckland. At the same time the strong market demand for supplying food to the gold rush markets in Australia and California ended.\n\n== Trade and travel ==\n\n===Transport===\n{{main|Waka (canoe)}}\n[[File:Abaconda New Zealand maori waka.jpg|thumb|{{lang|mi|[[Waka (canoe)|Waka]]}} (canoes) are built in a variety of sizes depending on their purpose, including deep-sea fishing, river crossings or historically war and migration.]]\nThe normal M\u0101ori method of travel was on foot. The North Island had an extensive network of single lane one metre wide tracks that traversed beaches, plains, valleys and mountain passes. Some of these tracks were used by many {{lang|mi|iwi}} and were considered neutral territory. Missionaries who travelled with M\u0101ori guides found that at river crossings canoes were left for the use of any traveller.<ref>Tainui. L. Kelly.2002.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Between 1840 and 1850 numbers of explorers, artists, government officials including Governor Grey travelled inland with the aid of M\u0101ori guides. The guides carried heavy loads and would carry Europeans across creeks. Crossing swamps was common. Although they carried some food they relied on purchasing basic foodstuffs such as potatoes or native pigeons from M\u0101ori settlements. The most popular payment was in tobacco which was in great demand. In more remote areas travellers sometimes found M\u0101ori living by themselves and growing a few potatoes.<ref>Voyages. P. Moon. Penguin. 2014.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\nCanoes ({{lang|mi|[[waka (canoe)|waka]]}}) were used extensively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waka-canoes/page-1|title=Waka \u2013 canoes |work=Te Ara}}</ref> These ranged from small river-going boats, to the large {{lang|mi|waka taua}} sea-going war vessels carrying up to 80 paddlers, and up to {{convert|40|m|ft}} long.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waka-canoes/3|title=Waka taua|work=Te Ara}}</ref> Waka were used extensively for long-range travel down the east coast and to cross Cook Strait.

Te Rauparah\u0101 later hired a European ship to attack Akaroa Harbour.{{sfn|King|2003}} This showed that Te Rauparaha was prepared to use Western technology to further his own  goals. [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]], who followed several war parties, reported as many as 50 waka taua travelling together at one time, although he reported they only went out to sea in relatively calm weather. From 1835 large numbers of European ships entered the Bay of Islands every year with Henry Williams reporting an average of 70\u201380 ships per year. Many M\u0101ori men worked on the ships, with a reported average of eight M\u0101ori seamen per whaling ship. Ten metre long whaleboats began to be used by M\u0101ori. They could be both rowed and sailed.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012}} In the 1850s as M\u0101ori with the active encouragement of Grey embraced trade were gradually able to develop a large fleet of small trading schooners and similar craft. All the initial European centres had been supported by Maori.\n\n[[File:Maori war canoe, drawing by Alexander Sporing.jpg|thumb|Maori war canoe, drawing by Alexander Sporing, [[First voyage of James Cook|Cook's first voyage]], 1769]]\nDuring the mid 19th century Auckland and Northland M\u0101ori dominated shipping trade. In 1851 51 vessels were registered and 30 smaller vessels licensed. By 1857 there were 37 schooners. The fleet increased steadily during the Tasman trade boom of 1853\u201356. M\u0101ori paid customs duties to the government and invested heavily in vessels, so suffered considerably when a dramatic market slump hit New Zealand especially effecting the Auckland\u2013Waikato\u2013Hauraki area.<ref>Climates of War. E. Bohan. pp 36\u201337.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} During the musket war period and for a time afterwards, Maori, isolated from their tribal support by these devastating conflicts, hid in isolated places, living off patches of vegetables they grew in tiny gardens. This practice was very common in Taranaki which had been devastated by Waikato attacks in particular. European explorers, such as Dieffenbach, often stumbled upon these survivors while exploring. He described these {{lang|mi|whare}} as hotbeds for rats and vermin.<ref>P. Moon. p. 111. 2014.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Trade===\nWith the arrival of Europeans M\u0101ori gradually started to trust the value of British money and use it as a medium of exchange instead of goods. This was rare before 1834 but became increasingly common as more M\u0101ori worked as sailors on European ships, where they gained a good reputation as being strong capable workers.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=West|first=Jonathan|title=The Face of Nature: An Environmental History of the Otago Peninsula|date=March 2018|publisher=[[University of Otago|Otago University]] Press|isbn=978-1-92732238-3|location=Dunedin|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Az_ltwEACAAJ&dq=face+of+nature}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/economic-history/page-2|title=2. \u2013 Economic history \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref>\n\nBy 1839 a large proportion of the M\u0101ori trade in goods was paid for in cash, with M\u0101ori showing a strong preference for coins rather than paper banknotes. Northern M\u0101ori learnt that they could more easily hide cash from their relatives avoiding the traditional obligatory sharing of goods with their {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}}. The period 1835 to 1840 completed the revolution in the north M\u0101ori economy with M\u0101ori abandoning many of their former trading habits and adopting those of the Europeans to the point where M\u0101ori became dependent on the flow of European goods to maintain their new way of life.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|pages=130\u2013135}}\n \nThe effect of trading increased the influence of chiefs over their {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}}. Northern traders assumed that the chief was the organisational head of the {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} and all trade went through him including payments for goods purchased. This gave chiefs much more influence, especially after 1835, because trade was so regular. In pre-contact times the power of chiefs was never very great, largely being restricted to directing warfare.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=203}} Early European observers noted that at {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} and {{lang|mi|whanuau hui}} (meetings) every person, including women, had their say and the chief had no more influence than any other person on the final decision. Where a chief had great {{lang|mi|mana}}, especially powers of persuasion, chiefs had more influence because of their personality rather than any recognised authority.\n \nNot all {{lang|mi|iwi}} had regular contact with Europeans. The French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville visited Tasman Bay in 1827 and using knowledge he had picked up at the Bay of Islands was able to communicate with local M\u0101ori. He found that although they had some passing awareness of Europeans\u2014they seemed to know about firearms\u2014the extent of their understanding was far less than that of the Northern M\u0101ori.{{sfn|Moon|2012|page=128}}\n\nIn the Waikato regular contact did not start until five decades after contact in the north of New Zealand. It was not until Ng\u0101ti Toa was forced out of Kawhia in 1821 that the bulk of the Tainui people had contact with Europeans. In 1823 a man called Te Puaha visited the Bay of Islands, bringing back with him Captain Kent who arrived by ship at Kawhia.\n\nBy 1859 trade was the main area in which M\u0101ori interacted with Europeans. Trade was an area that M\u0101ori expected to control. From first contact, they had sold or exchanged fresh foodstuffs initially for high-value goods such as axes and later for money. George Grey was keen to encourage M\u0101ori trade and commerce and established new laws to empower them in 1846. M\u0101ori brought numerous cases under this legislation and won. This was their first and most successful legal experience.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burke|first=E.|title=Climates of War|year=2005|publisher=Hazard Press|page=36}}</ref> M\u0101ori had begun to include European concepts into their own cultural behaviour. In 1886 banknotes were printed (but not issued) by Te Peeke o Aotearoa, a bank established by [[T\u0101whiao]] the [[M\u0101ori King Movement|M\u0101ori King]].

Traditionally the resources the land held were controlled based on systems of {{lang|mi|mana}} (power) and {{lang|mi|whakapapa}} (ancestral right). The land itself was both sacred and abstract. In many cases multiple groups would express a connection with the same important river or mountain. Oral tradition would record the migrations of groups from one area to another and their connection with an ancestral location.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn the early 19th century many Europeans entered into dealings with M\u0101ori to obtain land for their use. In some cases settlers thought they were buying land to obtain equivalent to freehold title under British law; M\u0101ori claimed that the various deeds signed by M\u0101ori were more limited and conditional, stopping short of outright alienation. It has been argued that the use of the word {{lang|mi|tuku}} in deeds, meaning to let or allow or give freely, was not the same as selling. This and other interpretations of early 19th century New Zealand land deals have been the source of much disagreement both within the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] process and outside it.<ref>Waitangi Tribunal, [https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/WT/wt_DOC_68635760/Muriwhenua%20Land.pdf Muriwhenua Land Report], p. 394</ref>{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=147}}\n\nM\u0101ori, especially after 1830, were eager to have Europeans living on their land under their protection so they could benefit from European knowledge and trade. Missionaries on the other hand were keen to buy land so they could grow their own food to make them less dependent on tribal \"protectors\", who sometimes used food supplies to coerce them. Settlers allowed M\u0101ori to stay on the land they had \"bought\" and often continued to give presents to tribal chiefs, often prompted by the chiefs themselves, in order to maintain friendly relationships. These compromises stopped with the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=147}}\n\nAnother reason for M\u0101ori to \"sell\" land to missionaries was to protect the title of the land from other tribal competitors. M\u0101ori who had converted to Christianity wanted to protect their land without resorting to warfare. Some degree of control passed to the missionaries who M\u0101ori trusted to allow them continued access and use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treatyofwaitangi.net.nz/WhyaTreaty.html|title=The Treaty of Waitangi|website=www.treatyofwaitangi.net.nz|access-date=2017-07-27}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1840 generally, older chiefs were reluctant to sell while younger chiefs were in favour. The situation was complicated as M\u0101ori often had overlapping rights on poorly defined land. The settlers and the government also had very limited access to trained surveyors and even freehold land boundaries were ill-defined. Surveying was a relatively new skill and involved much hard physical work especially in hill country. New farmers were able to purchase a small freehold farm from M\u0101ori on which they established their homestead and farm buildings. They then entered into leases with M\u0101ori owners for much larger areas of land. Short-term leases gave M\u0101ori a powerful position as there was a large demand for grazing land.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe Native Lands Act was a policy enforced by the government in 1865, which allowed the M\u0101ori people to obtain individual titles for their land to sell. This act abolished the traditional shared landholdings and made it easier for European settlers to directly purchase land for themselves.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sorrenson|first=M. P.

He constantly stressed the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of emphasizing the product's availability through saturation campaigns. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that \"tastes change, fashions change, and the advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat, stale, and unprofitable if presented to the public today. Not that the idea of today is always better than the older idea, but it is different \u2013 it hits the present taste.\"<ref name=\"mat\" />\n\nAs the economy expanded across the world during the 19th century, advertising grew alongside. In the United States, the success of this advertising format eventually led to the growth of mail-order advertising.\n\nIn June 1836, French newspaper ''[[La Presse (France)|La Presse]]'' was the first to include paid advertising in its pages, allowing it to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] and the formula was soon copied by all titles. Around 1840, [[Volney B. Palmer]] established the roots of the modern day advertising agency in Philadelphia. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad \u2013 the copy, layout, and artwork \u2013 was still prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a space broker. The situation changed when the first full-service advertising agency of N.W. Ayer & Son was founded in 1869 in Philadelphia. Ayer & Son offered to plan, create, and execute complete advertising campaigns for its customers. By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession.\n<ref name=\"eskilson-pg58\">{{Cite book |title=Graphic Design: A New History |last=Eskilson |first=Stephen J. |year=2007 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Connecticut |isbn=978-0-300-12011-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/graphicdesignnew00eski/page/58 58] |url=https://archive.org/details/graphicdesignnew00eski/page/58 }}</ref> Around the same time, in France, [[Charles-Louis Havas]] extended the services of his news agency, [[Havas]] to include advertisement brokerage, making it the first French group to organize.

The word \"infomercial\" is a [[portmanteau]] of the words \"information\" and \"commercial\". The main objective in an infomercial is to create an [[impulse purchase]], so that the target sees the presentation and then immediately buys the product through the advertised [[toll-free telephone number]] or website. Infomercials describe, display, and often demonstrate products and their features, and commonly have testimonials from customers and [[advertising professional|industry professionals]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:Television commercial 1948.JPG|thumb|A television commercial being filmed in 1948]]\n\n;Radio: [[Radio]] advertisements are broadcast as radio waves to the air from a transmitter to an antenna and a thus to a receiving device. Airtime is purchased from a station or network in exchange for airing the commercials. While radio has the limitation of being restricted to sound, proponents of radio advertising often cite this as an advantage. Radio is an expanding medium that can be found on air, and also online. According to [[Arbitron]], radio has approximately 241.6 million weekly listeners, or more than 93 percent of the U.S. population.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n;Online: Online advertising is a form of [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]] that uses the Internet and [[World Wide Web]] for the expressed purpose of delivering marketing messages to attract customers. Online ads are delivered by an ad server. Examples of online advertising include contextual ads that appear on [[search engine results page]]s, [[banner ad]]s, in [[pay per click]] text ads, [[rich media]] ads, [[Social network advertising]], [[online classified advertising]], [[advertising network]]s and [[e-mail marketing]], including [[e-mail spam]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A newer form of online advertising is [[Native advertising|Native Ads]]; they go in a website's news feed and are supposed to improve user experience by being less intrusive. However, some people argue this practice is deceptive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalmarketer.com/what-is-native-advertising/|title=What is Native Advertising?|work=Digital Marketer|accessdate=September 8, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104032/http://www.digitalmarketer.com/what-is-native-advertising/|archivedate=September 6, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n;Domain names: Domain name advertising is most commonly done through pay per click [[web search engine]]s, however, advertisers often lease space directly on domain names that generically describe their products. When an Internet user visits a website by typing a domain name directly into their web browser, this is known as \"direct navigation\", or \"type in\" web traffic. Although many Internet users search for ideas and products using search engines and mobile phones, a large number of users around the world still use the address bar. They will type a keyword into the address bar such as \"geraniums\" and add \".com\" to the end of it. Sometimes they will do the same with \".org\" or a country-code Top Level Domain (TLD such as \".co.uk\" for the United Kingdom or \".ca\" for Canada). When Internet users type in a generic keyword and add .com or another [[top-level domain]] (TLD) ending, it produces a targeted sales lead.<ref name=targetedtraffic>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=J1nyTNnVSGAC&lpg=PT61&dq=what%20is%20targeted%20domain%20name%20traffic&pg=PT61#v=onepage&q=targeted%20domain%20name%20traffic&f=false |title=Get Rich Click!: The Ultimate Guide to Making Money on the Internet |publisher=Free Press, Simon and Schuster |last=Ostrofsky |first=Marc |date=2011 |accessdate=December 15, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415132523/https://books.google.com/books?id=J1nyTNnVSGAC&lpg=PT61&ots=4B2XJDofFT&dq=what%20is%20targeted%20domain%20name%20traffic&pg=PT61#v=onepage&q=targeted%20domain%20name%20traffic&f=false |archivedate=April 15, 2015 |df=mdy-all |isbn=9781451668391 }}</ref> Domain name advertising was originally developed by Oingo (later known as Applied Semantics), one of [[Google]]'s early acquisitions.<ref name=oingo>{{cite web |url=http://allthingsd.com/20130422/ten-years-later-lessons-from-the-applied-semantics-google-acquisition/ |title=Ten Years Later \u2013 Lessons from the Applied Semantics Google Acquisition |publisher=Allthingsd.com |last=Elbaz |first=Eytan |date=April 22, 2013 |accessdate=December 15, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214035929/http://allthingsd.com/20130422/ten-years-later-lessons-from-the-applied-semantics-google-acquisition/ |archivedate=December 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n;Product placements: '''{{vanchor|Covert advertising}}''' is when a product or brand is embedded in entertainment and media. For example, in a film, the main character can use an item or other of a definite brand, as in the movie ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', where [[Tom Cruise]]'s character John Anderton owns a phone with the ''[[Nokia]]'' logo clearly written in the top corner, or his watch engraved with the ''[[Bulgari]]'' logo. Another example of advertising in film is in ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', where main character played by [[Will Smith]] mentions his ''[[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]]'' shoes several times, calling them \"classics\", because the film is set far in the future. ''I, Robot'' and ''[[Spaceballs]]'' also showcase futuristic cars with the ''[[Audi]]'' and ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]'' logos clearly displayed on the front of the vehicles. [[Cadillac]] chose to advertise in the movie ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'', which as a result contained many scenes in which Cadillac cars were used. Similarly, product placement for [[Omega SA|Omega Watches]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[VAIO]], [[BMW]] and [[Aston Martin]] cars are featured in recent [[James Bond]] films, most notably ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. In \"[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]\", the main transport vehicle shows a large [[Dodge]] logo on the front. ''[[Blade Runner]]'' includes some of the most obvious product placement; the whole film stops to show a [[Coca-Cola]] billboard.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n;Print: Print advertising describes advertising in a printed medium such as a newspaper, magazine, or trade journal. This encompasses everything from media with a very broad readership base, such as a major national newspaper or magazine, to more narrowly targeted media such as local newspapers and trade journals on very specialized topics. One form of print advertising is [[classified advertising]], which allows private individuals or companies to purchase a small, narrowly targeted ad paid by the word or line. Another form of print advertising is the display ad, which is generally a larger ad with design elements that typically run in an article section of a newspaper.<ref name=\"Bovee\" />{{rp|14}}\n\n;Outdoor: [[Billboard]]s, also known as hoardings in some parts of the world, are large structures located in public places which display advertisements to passing pedestrians and motorists. Most often, they are located on main roads with a large amount of passing motor and pedestrian traffic; however, they can be placed in any location with large numbers of viewers, such as on mass transit vehicles and in stations, in shopping malls or office buildings, and in stadiums. The form known as street advertising first came to prominence in the UK by Street Advertising Services to create outdoor advertising on street furniture and pavements. Working with products such as [[Reverse Graffiti]], [[air dancer]]s and 3D pavement advertising, for getting brand messages out into public spaces.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Sheltered outdoor advertising combines outdoor with indoor advertisement by placing large mobile, structures ([[tents]]) in public places on temporary bases. The large outer advertising space aims to exert a strong pull on the observer, the product is promoted indoors, where the creative decor can intensify the impression.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[Mobile billboard]]s are generally vehicle mounted billboards or digital screens. These can be on dedicated vehicles built solely for carrying advertisements along routes preselected by clients, they can also be specially equipped cargo trucks or, in some cases, large banners strewn from planes. The billboards are often lighted; some being [[Backlight|backlit]], and others employing spotlights. Some billboard displays are static, while others change; for example, continuously or periodically rotating among a set of advertisements. Mobile displays are used for various situations in metropolitan areas throughout the world, including: target advertising, one-day and long-term campaigns, conventions, sporting events, store openings and similar promotional events, and big advertisements from smaller companies.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:Redeye Sailboat.jpg|thumb|The ''[[RedEye]]'' newspaper advertised to its target market at [[North Avenue Beach]] with a sailboat billboard on [[Lake Michigan]].]]\n\n;Point-of-sale: In-store advertising is any advertisement placed in a retail store. It includes placement of a product in visible locations in a store, such as at eye level, at the ends of aisles and near checkout counters (a.k.a. POP \u2013 point of purchase display), eye-catching displays promoting a specific product, and advertisements in such places as shopping carts and in-store video displays.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n;Novelties: Advertising printed on small tangible items such as coffee mugs, T-shirts, pens, bags, and such is known as [[Novelty item|novelty advertising]]. Some printers specialize in printing novelty items, which can then be distributed directly by the advertiser, or items may be distributed as part of a cross-promotion, such as ads on fast food containers. {{citation needed| date= January 2017}}\n\n;Celebrity endorsements: Advertising in which a celebrity endorses a product or brand leverages celebrity power, fame, money, popularity to gain recognition for their products or to promote specific stores' or products. Advertisers often advertise their products, for example, when celebrities share their favorite products or wear clothes by specific brands or designers. Celebrities are often involved in advertising campaigns such as television or print adverts to advertise specific or general products. The use of celebrities to endorse a brand can have its downsides, however; one mistake by a celebrity can be detrimental to the [[public relations]] of a brand. For example, following his performance of eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, swimmer [[Michael Phelps]]' contract with [[Kellogg's]] was terminated, as Kellogg's did not want to associate with him after he was photographed smoking marijuana.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Celebrities such as [[Britney Spears]] have advertised for multiple products including Pepsi, Candies from Kohl's, Twister, NASCAR, and Toyota.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n;[[Aerial advertising|Aerial]]: Using aircraft, [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloons]] or [[airship]]s to create or display advertising media.

Pop-up, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], banner, pop-under, [[advergaming]], and email advertisements (all of which are often unwanted or spam in the case of email) are now commonplace. Particularly since the rise of \"entertaining\" advertising, some people may like an advertisement enough to wish to watch it later or show a friend.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} In general, the advertising community has not yet made this easy, although some have used the Internet to widely distribute their ads to anyone willing to see or hear them. In the last three quarters of 2009, mobile and Internet advertising grew by 18% and 9% respectively, while older media advertising saw declines: \u221210.1% (TV), \u221211.7% (radio), \u221214.8% (magazines) and \u221218.7% (newspapers).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Between 2008 and 2014, U.S. newspapers lost more than half their print advertising revenue.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Schwartz|first1=Jason|title=Will John Henry Save the Globe?|url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/|magazine=Boston Magazine|date=March 2014|page=133}}</ref>\n\n=== Niche marketing ===\n\nAnother significant trend regarding future of advertising is the growing importance of the [[niche market]] using niche or targeted ads. Also brought about by the Internet and the theory of the [[long tail]], advertisers will have an increasing ability to reach specific audiences. In the past, the most efficient way to deliver a message was to blanket the largest [[mass market]] audience possible.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} However, usage tracking, customer profiles and the growing popularity of niche content brought about by everything from blogs to social networking sites, provide advertisers with audiences that are smaller but much better defined,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} leading to ads that are more relevant to viewers and more effective for companies' marketing products. Among others, [[Comcast Spotlight]] is one such advertiser employing this method in their [[video on demand]] menus. These advertisements are targeted to a specific group and can be viewed by anyone wishing to find out more about a particular business or practice, from their home. This causes the viewer to become proactive and actually choose what advertisements they want to view.<ref>[http://www.comcastspotlight.com/sites/Default.aspx?pageid=7608&siteid=62&subnav=3 \"Interactive \u2013 VOD\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326200208/http://www.comcastspotlight.com/sites/Default.aspx?pageid=7608&siteid=62&subnav=3 |date=March 26, 2009 }} \"Comcast Spotlight website\". Retrieved October 5, 2006.</ref>\nNiche marketing could also be helped by bringing the issue of colour into advertisements. Different colours play major roles when it comes to marketing strategies, for example, seeing the blue can promote a sense of calmness and gives a sense of security which is why many social networks such as Facebook use blue in their logos.   \n[[Google AdSense]] is an example of niche marketing. Google calculates the primary purpose of a website and adjusts ads accordingly; it uses keywords on the page (or even in emails) to find the general ideas of topics disused and places ads that will most likely be clicked on by viewers of the email account or website visitors.\n\n=== Crowdsourcing ===\n{{Main|Crowdsourcing}}\n\nThe concept of crowdsourcing has given way to the trend of [[user-generated]] advertisements. User-generated ads are created by people, as opposed to an advertising agency or the company themselves, often resulting from brand sponsored advertising competitions. For the 2007 Super Bowl, the Frito-Lays division of [[PepsiCo]] held the \"Crash the Super Bowl\" contest, allowing people to create their own [[Doritos]] commercials.<ref name=\"Advertising Age\">{{cite news |url=http://adage.com/SuperBowlBuyers/ |title=Who's Buying What at Super Bowl 2007 |publisher=Advertising Age |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218070122/http://adage.com/SuperBowlBuyers/ |archivedate=February 18, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Chevrolet]] held a similar competition for their Tahoe line of SUVs.<ref name=\"Advertising Age\" /> Due to the success of the Doritos user-generated ads in the 2007 Super Bowl, Frito-Lays relaunched the competition for the 2009 and 2010 Super Bowl. The resulting ads were among the most-watched and most-liked Super Bowl ads. In fact, the winning ad that aired in the 2009 Super Bowl was ranked by the [[USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter]] as the top ad for the year while the winning ads that aired in the 2010 Super Bowl were found by Nielsen's BuzzMetrics to be the \"most buzzed-about\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/business/media/09adco.html |title=Do-It-Yourself Super Ads |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 8, 2010 |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |first=Stuart |last=Elliott |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217050431/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/business/media/09adco.html |archivedate=February 17, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/admeter/2009admeter.htm |title='Two nobodies from nowhere' craft winning Super Bowl ad |newspaper=USA Today |date=December 31, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |first=Bruce |last=Horovitz |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227030845/http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/admeter/2009admeter.htm |archivedate=December 27, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Another example of companies using crowdsourcing successfully is the beverage company [[Jones Soda]] that encourages consumers to participate in the label design themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://adage.com/article/digitalnext/crowdsourcing/132873/ |title=Crowdsourcing: Everything Old Is New Again, and Again |website=adage.com |date=2008-11-26 |accessdate=2019-03-04}}</ref>\n\nThis trend has given rise to several online platforms that host user-generated advertising competitions on behalf of a company.

For [[Global marketing|global advertisers]], there are four, potentially competing, business objectives that must be balanced when developing worldwide advertising: building a brand while speaking with one voice, developing [[economies of scale]] in the creative process, maximising local effectiveness of ads, and increasing the company's speed of implementation. Born from the evolutionary stages of global marketing are the three primary and fundamentally different approaches to the development of global advertising executions: exporting executions, producing local executions, and importing ideas that travel.<ref>Global marketing Management, 2004, pp. 13\u20138</ref>\n\nAdvertising research is key to determining the success of an ad in any country or region. The ability to identify which elements and/or moments of an ad contribute to its success is how [[economies of scale]] are maximized. Once one knows what works in an ad, that idea or ideas can be imported by any other market. [[Market research]] measures, such as [[Wikt:flow of attention|Flow of Attention]], [[Wikt:flow of emotion|Flow of Emotion]] and [[Wikt:branding moment|branding moments]] provide insight into what is working in an ad in any country or region because the measures are based on the visual, not verbal, elements of the ad.<ref>Young, p.131</ref>\n\n=== Foreign public messaging ===\n{{See also|Soft power|International tourism advertising}}\n\nForeign governments,{{which|date=December 2014}} particularly those that own marketable commercial products or services, often promote their interests and positions through the advertising of those goods because the target audience is not only largely unaware of the forum as a vehicle for foreign messaging but also willing to receive the message while in a mental state of absorbing information from advertisements during television commercial breaks, while reading a periodical, or while passing by billboards in public spaces. A prime example of this messaging technique is advertising campaigns to promote international travel. While advertising foreign destinations and services may stem from the typical goal of increasing revenue by drawing more tourism, some travel campaigns carry the additional or alternative intended purpose of promoting good sentiments or improving existing ones among the target audience towards a given nation or region. It is common for advertising promoting foreign countries to be produced and distributed by the tourism ministries of those countries, so these ads often carry political statements and/or depictions of the foreign government's [[Perception management|desired international public perception]]. Additionally, a wide range of foreign airlines and travel-related services which advertise separately from the destinations, themselves, are owned by their respective governments; examples include, though are not limited to, the [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates airline]] ([[Dubai]]), [[Singapore Airlines]] (Singapore), [[Qatar Airways]] ([[Qatar]]), [[China Airlines]] ([[Taiwan]]/[[Republic of China]]), and [[Air China]] (People's Republic of China). By depicting their destinations, airlines, and other services in a favorable and pleasant light, countries market themselves to populations abroad in a manner that could mitigate prior public impressions.\n\n=== Diversification ===\n\nIn the realm of [[advertising agencies]], continued industry diversification has seen observers note that \"big global clients don't need big global agencies any more\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Howard |first=Theresa |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-10-09-goodson-profile_x.htm |title=USA Today, October 9, 2005 |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=October 10, 2005 |accessdate=April 20, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327010633/http://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-10-09-goodson-profile_x.htm |archivedate=March 27, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> This is reflected by the growth of non-traditional agencies in various global markets, such as Canadian business [[TAXI (advertising agency)|TAXI]] and [[SMART (advertising agency)|SMART]] in Australia and has been referred to as \"a revolution in the ad world\".<ref>{{cite magazine\n |url         = http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/12/12/8363132/index.htm\n |title       = Madison Ave. Lights Up\n |first       = Devin\n |last        = Leonard\n |magazine   = [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]\n |date        = December 12, 2005\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090606210859/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/12/12/8363132/index.htm\n |archivedate = June 6, 2009\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n=== New technology ===\n[[File:Facebook advertising.jpg|thumb|Human billboard at the [[National Multicultural Festival]] being used to advertise Facebook news feed]]\nThe ability to record shows on [[digital video recorder]]s (such as TiVo) allow watchers to record the programs for later viewing, enabling them to fast forward through commercials. Additionally, as more seasons of pre-recorded [[box set]]s are offered for sale of television programs; fewer people watch the shows on TV. However, the fact that these sets are '''sold''', means the company will receive additional profits from these sets.\n\nTo counter this effect, a variety of strategies have been employed. Many advertisers have opted for product placement on TV shows like [[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]. Other strategies include integrating advertising with internet-connected [[EPG|program guides]]s (EPGs), advertising on companion devices (like smartphones and tablets) during the show, and creating [[mobile apps]] for TV programs. Additionally, some like brands have opted for [[social television]] sponsorship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com/2011/05/09/survivor-jeff-probst-says-product-placement-is-here-to-stay/|title=Reality TV|website=realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419064602/http://realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com/2011/05/09/survivor-jeff-probst-says-product-placement-is-here-to-stay/|archivedate=April 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe emerging technology of [[drone display]]s has recently been used for advertising purposes.<ref>[https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2016/11/intel-launches-500-drones-into-sky-and-breaks-world-record-in-spectacular-style-449886 Intel launches 500 drones into sky and breaks world record in spectacular style]</ref>\n\n=== Advertising education ===\n\nIn recent years there have been several media literacy initiatives, and more specifically concerning advertising, that seek to empower citizens in the face of media advertising campaigns.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Britt|last2=Schellens|first2=Tammy|last3=Valcke|first3=Martin|date=2017|title=Promoting Adolescents' Moral Advertising Literacy in Secondary Education|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=93\u2013103|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-09|issn=1134-3478|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n[[Advertising education]] has become popular with bachelor, master and doctorate degrees becoming available in the emphasis.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A surge in advertising interest is typically attributed to the strong relationship advertising plays in cultural and technological changes, such as the advance of online social networking.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A unique model for teaching advertising is the [[student-run advertising agency]], where advertising students create campaigns for real companies.<ref>{{Cite book\n |url         = http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED351711&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=ED351711\n |title       = Student-Run Advertising Agency: A Showcase for Student Work.\n |first       = James\n |last        = Avery\n |date        = 1992-08-01\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090724163231/http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true\n |archivedate = July 24, 2009\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref> Organizations such as the [[American Advertising Federation]] establish companies with students to create these campaigns.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n== Purposes ==\nAdvertising is at the front of delivering the proper message to customers and prospective customers.

Sales promotions include things like contests and games, sweepstakes, product giveaways, samples coupons, loyalty programs, and discounts. The ultimate goal of sales promotions is to stimulate potential customers to action.<ref>Altstiel, Tom, and Jean Grow. Advertising Strategy: Creative Tactics From the Outside/In.

It entails numerous forms of research which employ different methodologies. Advertising research includes pre-testing (also known as [[copy testing]]) and post-testing of ads and/or campaigns.\n\nPre-testing includes a wide range of qualitative and quantitative techniques, including: focus groups, in-depth target audience interviews (one-on-one interviews), small-scale quantitative studies and physiological measurement. The goal of these investigations is to better understand how different groups respond to various messages and visual prompts, thereby providing an assessment of how well the advertisement meets its communications goals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.copytesting.org|title=CopyTesting.org|website=www.copytesting.org|access-date=2017-02-13|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425021551/http://copytesting.org/|archivedate=April 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nPost-testing employs many of the same techniques as pre-testing, usually with a focus on understanding the change in awareness or attitude attributable to the advertisement. With the emergence of digital advertising technologies, many firms have begun to continuously post-test ads using real-time data. This may take the form of A/B split-testing or multivariate testing.\n\nContinuous [[ad tracking]] and the [[Communicus]] System are competing examples of post-testing advertising research types.<ref>Peeter Verlegh, Hilde Voorveld, and Martin Eisend, eds.

Advertising has many hidden signs and meanings within [[brand names]], [[logos]], package designs, print advertisements, and [[television advertisements]]. Semiotics aims to study and interpret the message being conveyed in (for example) advertisements. Logos and advertisements can be interpreted at two levels \u2013 known as the surface level and the underlying level. The surface level uses signs creatively to create an image or personality for a product.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} These signs can be images, words, fonts, [[color]]s, or slogans. The underlying level is made up of hidden meanings. The combination of images, words, [[color]]s, and slogans must be interpreted by the audience or consumer.<ref>{{cite book|last= Beasley|first= Ron|title= Persuasive Signs: The Semiotics of Advertising|year= 2002|publisher= Walter deGruyter GmbH & KG|location= Berlin, Germany|isbn= 978-3-11-017341-3}}</ref> The \"key to advertising analysis\" is the signifier and the signified.

The signifier is the color, brand name, logo design, and technology. The signified has two meanings known as denotative and connotative. The denotative meaning is the meaning of the product. A television's denotative meaning might be that it is high definition. The connotative meaning is the product's deep and hidden meaning. A connotative meaning of a television would be that it is top-of-the-line.<ref>{{cite book|last= Umiker-Sebeok|first= Donna Jean|title= Marketing and Semiotics|year= 1987|publisher= Walter de Gruyter & Co.|location= Berlin}}</ref>\n\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] commercials{{when|date=April 2015}} used a black [[silhouette]] of a person that was the age of Apple's target market. They placed the silhouette in front of a blue screen so that the picture behind the silhouette could be constantly changing. However, the one thing that stays the same in these ads is that there is music in the background and the silhouette is listening to that music on a white iPod through white headphones. Through advertising, the white color on a set of earphones now signifies that the music device is an iPod. The white color signifies almost all of Apple's products.<ref>{{cite web|last= Salsburey|first= Justin|title= Semiotic analysis of iPod Advertisements|url= http://sites.google.com/site/jsalsburey/macintoshsemiotics|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130521105135/https://sites.google.com/site/jsalsburey/macintoshsemiotics|archivedate= May 21, 2013|df= mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe semiotics of [[gender]] plays a key influence on the way in which signs are interpreted. When considering [[Gender advertisement|gender roles in advertising]], individuals are influenced by three categories. Certain characteristics of stimuli may enhance or decrease the elaboration of the message (if the product is perceived as [[feminine]] or [[masculine]]). Second, the characteristics of individuals can affect [[attention]] and elaboration of the message ([[tradition]]al or non-traditional [[gender role]] orientation). Lastly, situational factors may be important to influence the elaboration of the message.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ademola|first=Owolabi|title=Effects of Gender-Role Orientation, Sex of Advert Presenter and Product Type on Advertising Effectiveness|journal=European Journal of Scientific Research|year=2005|volume=35|issue=4|pages=537\u2013543}}</ref>\n\nThere are two types of [[marketing communication]] claims-objective and subjective.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Koc|first= Erdogan|title= Impact of gender in marketing communications: the role of cognitive and affective cues|journal= Journal of Marketing Communications|year= 2002|volume= 8|issue= 4|page= 257|doi= 10.1080/13527260210145993}}</ref> Objective claims stem from the extent to which the claim associates the brand with a tangible product or service feature.

Later research by a Danish team<ref>Vestergaard and Schr\u00f8der, ''The Language of Advertising'', 75</ref> found that advertising attempts to persuade men to improve their appearance or performance, whereas its approach to women aims at [[transformation (disambiguation)|transformation]] toward an impossible ideal of female presentation. In Paul Suggett's article \"The Objectification of Women in Advertising\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/advertising-women-and-objectification-38754|title=Advertising Sets Impossible Standards for Women|work=The Balance|access-date=2017-05-07|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326082225/https://www.thebalance.com/advertising-women-and-objectification-38754|archivedate=March 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> he discusses the negative impact that these women in advertisements, who are too perfect to be real, have on women, as well as men, in real life. Advertising's manipulation of women's aspiration to these ideal types as portrayed in film, in erotic art, in advertising, on stage, within music videos, and through other media exposures requires at least a conditioned rejection of female reality, and thereby takes on a highly ideological cast. Studies show that these expectations of women and young girls negatively impact their views about their bodies and appearances. These advertisements are directed towards men. Not everyone agrees: one critic viewed this monologic, gender-specific interpretation of advertising as excessively skewed and politicized.<ref>Splendora, \"Discourse\", Review of Vestergaard and Schr\u00f8der, ''The Language of Advertising'' in ''Language in Society,'' 449</ref>{{qn|date=February 2017}} There are some companies, however, like [[Dove Beauties|Dove]] and [[Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters)|Aerie]] that are creating commercials to portray more natural women, with less [[image manipulation|post production manipulation]], so more women and young girls are able to relate to them.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nMore recent research by Martin (2003) reveals that males and females differ in how they react to advertising depending on their mood at the time of exposure to the ads, and on the affective tone of the advertising. When feeling sad, males prefer happy ads to boost their mood. In contrast, females prefer happy ads when they are feeling happy. The television programs in which ads are embedded influence a viewer's mood state.<ref>\nMartin, Brett A. S.

On the other hand, ads that intend to elicit an immediate sale are known as [[direct response advertising|direct-response advertising]]. [[Non-commercial]] entities that advertise more than consumer products or services include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations and governmental agencies.

Fruits and vegetables were sold in the city square from the backs of carts and wagons and their proprietors used street callers ([[town crier]]s) to announce their whereabouts.

He constantly stressed the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of emphasizing the product's availability through saturation campaigns. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that \"tastes change, fashions change, and the advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat, stale, and unprofitable if presented to the public today. Not that the idea of today is always better than the older idea, but it is different \u2013 it hits the present taste.\"<ref name=\"mat\" />\n\nAs the economy expanded across the world during the 19th century, advertising grew alongside. In the United States, the success of this advertising format eventually led to the growth of mail-order advertising.\n\nIn June 1836, French newspaper ''[[La Presse (France)|La Presse]]'' was the first to include paid advertising in its pages, allowing it to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] and the formula was soon copied by all titles. Around 1840, [[Volney B. Palmer]] established the roots of the modern day advertising agency in Philadelphia. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad \u2013 the copy, layout, and artwork \u2013 was still prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a space broker. The situation changed when the first full-service advertising agency of N.W. Ayer & Son was founded in 1869 in Philadelphia. Ayer & Son offered to plan, create, and execute complete advertising campaigns for its customers. By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession.\n<ref name=\"eskilson-pg58\">{{Cite book |title=Graphic Design: A New History |last=Eskilson |first=Stephen J. |year=2007 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Connecticut |isbn=978-0-300-12011-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/graphicdesignnew00eski/page/58 58] |url=https://archive.org/details/graphicdesignnew00eski/page/58 }}</ref> Around the same time, in France, [[Charles-Louis Havas]] extended the services of his news agency, [[Havas]] to include advertisement brokerage, making it the first French group to organize.

The word \"infomercial\" is a [[portmanteau]] of the words \"information\" and \"commercial\". The main objective in an infomercial is to create an [[impulse purchase]], so that the target sees the presentation and then immediately buys the product through the advertised [[toll-free telephone number]] or website. Infomercials describe, display, and often demonstrate products and their features, and commonly have testimonials from customers and [[advertising professional|industry professionals]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:Television commercial 1948.JPG|thumb|A television commercial being filmed in 1948]]\n\n;Radio: [[Radio]] advertisements are broadcast as radio waves to the air from a transmitter to an antenna and a thus to a receiving device. Airtime is purchased from a station or network in exchange for airing the commercials. While radio has the limitation of being restricted to sound, proponents of radio advertising often cite this as an advantage. Radio is an expanding medium that can be found on air, and also online. According to [[Arbitron]], radio has approximately 241.6 million weekly listeners, or more than 93 percent of the U.S. population.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n;Online: Online advertising is a form of [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]] that uses the Internet and [[World Wide Web]] for the expressed purpose of delivering marketing messages to attract customers. Online ads are delivered by an ad server. Examples of online advertising include contextual ads that appear on [[search engine results page]]s, [[banner ad]]s, in [[pay per click]] text ads, [[rich media]] ads, [[Social network advertising]], [[online classified advertising]], [[advertising network]]s and [[e-mail marketing]], including [[e-mail spam]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A newer form of online advertising is [[Native advertising|Native Ads]]; they go in a website's news feed and are supposed to improve user experience by being less intrusive. However, some people argue this practice is deceptive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalmarketer.com/what-is-native-advertising/|title=What is Native Advertising?|work=Digital Marketer|accessdate=September 8, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104032/http://www.digitalmarketer.com/what-is-native-advertising/|archivedate=September 6, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n;Domain names: Domain name advertising is most commonly done through pay per click [[web search engine]]s, however, advertisers often lease space directly on domain names that generically describe their products. When an Internet user visits a website by typing a domain name directly into their web browser, this is known as \"direct navigation\", or \"type in\" web traffic. Although many Internet users search for ideas and products using search engines and mobile phones, a large number of users around the world still use the address bar. They will type a keyword into the address bar such as \"geraniums\" and add \".com\" to the end of it. Sometimes they will do the same with \".org\" or a country-code Top Level Domain (TLD such as \".co.uk\" for the United Kingdom or \".ca\" for Canada). When Internet users type in a generic keyword and add .com or another [[top-level domain]] (TLD) ending, it produces a targeted sales lead.<ref name=targetedtraffic>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=J1nyTNnVSGAC&lpg=PT61&dq=what%20is%20targeted%20domain%20name%20traffic&pg=PT61#v=onepage&q=targeted%20domain%20name%20traffic&f=false |title=Get Rich Click!: The Ultimate Guide to Making Money on the Internet |publisher=Free Press, Simon and Schuster |last=Ostrofsky |first=Marc |date=2011 |accessdate=December 15, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415132523/https://books.google.com/books?id=J1nyTNnVSGAC&lpg=PT61&ots=4B2XJDofFT&dq=what%20is%20targeted%20domain%20name%20traffic&pg=PT61#v=onepage&q=targeted%20domain%20name%20traffic&f=false |archivedate=April 15, 2015 |df=mdy-all |isbn=9781451668391 }}</ref> Domain name advertising was originally developed by Oingo (later known as Applied Semantics), one of [[Google]]'s early acquisitions.<ref name=oingo>{{cite web |url=http://allthingsd.com/20130422/ten-years-later-lessons-from-the-applied-semantics-google-acquisition/ |title=Ten Years Later \u2013 Lessons from the Applied Semantics Google Acquisition |publisher=Allthingsd.com |last=Elbaz |first=Eytan |date=April 22, 2013 |accessdate=December 15, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214035929/http://allthingsd.com/20130422/ten-years-later-lessons-from-the-applied-semantics-google-acquisition/ |archivedate=December 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n;Product placements: '''{{vanchor|Covert advertising}}''' is when a product or brand is embedded in entertainment and media. For example, in a film, the main character can use an item or other of a definite brand, as in the movie ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', where [[Tom Cruise]]'s character John Anderton owns a phone with the ''[[Nokia]]'' logo clearly written in the top corner, or his watch engraved with the ''[[Bulgari]]'' logo. Another example of advertising in film is in ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', where main character played by [[Will Smith]] mentions his ''[[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]]'' shoes several times, calling them \"classics\", because the film is set far in the future. ''I, Robot'' and ''[[Spaceballs]]'' also showcase futuristic cars with the ''[[Audi]]'' and ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]'' logos clearly displayed on the front of the vehicles. [[Cadillac]] chose to advertise in the movie ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'', which as a result contained many scenes in which Cadillac cars were used. Similarly, product placement for [[Omega SA|Omega Watches]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[VAIO]], [[BMW]] and [[Aston Martin]] cars are featured in recent [[James Bond]] films, most notably ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. In \"[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]\", the main transport vehicle shows a large [[Dodge]] logo on the front. ''[[Blade Runner]]'' includes some of the most obvious product placement; the whole film stops to show a [[Coca-Cola]] billboard.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n;Print: Print advertising describes advertising in a printed medium such as a newspaper, magazine, or trade journal. This encompasses everything from media with a very broad readership base, such as a major national newspaper or magazine, to more narrowly targeted media such as local newspapers and trade journals on very specialized topics. One form of print advertising is [[classified advertising]], which allows private individuals or companies to purchase a small, narrowly targeted ad paid by the word or line. Another form of print advertising is the display ad, which is generally a larger ad with design elements that typically run in an article section of a newspaper.<ref name=\"Bovee\" />{{rp|14}}\n\n;Outdoor: [[Billboard]]s, also known as hoardings in some parts of the world, are large structures located in public places which display advertisements to passing pedestrians and motorists. Most often, they are located on main roads with a large amount of passing motor and pedestrian traffic; however, they can be placed in any location with large numbers of viewers, such as on mass transit vehicles and in stations, in shopping malls or office buildings, and in stadiums. The form known as street advertising first came to prominence in the UK by Street Advertising Services to create outdoor advertising on street furniture and pavements. Working with products such as [[Reverse Graffiti]], [[air dancer]]s and 3D pavement advertising, for getting brand messages out into public spaces.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Sheltered outdoor advertising combines outdoor with indoor advertisement by placing large mobile, structures ([[tents]]) in public places on temporary bases. The large outer advertising space aims to exert a strong pull on the observer, the product is promoted indoors, where the creative decor can intensify the impression.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[Mobile billboard]]s are generally vehicle mounted billboards or digital screens. These can be on dedicated vehicles built solely for carrying advertisements along routes preselected by clients, they can also be specially equipped cargo trucks or, in some cases, large banners strewn from planes. The billboards are often lighted; some being [[Backlight|backlit]], and others employing spotlights. Some billboard displays are static, while others change; for example, continuously or periodically rotating among a set of advertisements. Mobile displays are used for various situations in metropolitan areas throughout the world, including: target advertising, one-day and long-term campaigns, conventions, sporting events, store openings and similar promotional events, and big advertisements from smaller companies.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:Redeye Sailboat.jpg|thumb|The ''[[RedEye]]'' newspaper advertised to its target market at [[North Avenue Beach]] with a sailboat billboard on [[Lake Michigan]].]]\n\n;Point-of-sale: In-store advertising is any advertisement placed in a retail store. It includes placement of a product in visible locations in a store, such as at eye level, at the ends of aisles and near checkout counters (a.k.a. POP \u2013 point of purchase display), eye-catching displays promoting a specific product, and advertisements in such places as shopping carts and in-store video displays.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n;Novelties: Advertising printed on small tangible items such as coffee mugs, T-shirts, pens, bags, and such is known as [[Novelty item|novelty advertising]]. Some printers specialize in printing novelty items, which can then be distributed directly by the advertiser, or items may be distributed as part of a cross-promotion, such as ads on fast food containers. {{citation needed| date= January 2017}}\n\n;Celebrity endorsements: Advertising in which a celebrity endorses a product or brand leverages celebrity power, fame, money, popularity to gain recognition for their products or to promote specific stores' or products. Advertisers often advertise their products, for example, when celebrities share their favorite products or wear clothes by specific brands or designers. Celebrities are often involved in advertising campaigns such as television or print adverts to advertise specific or general products. The use of celebrities to endorse a brand can have its downsides, however; one mistake by a celebrity can be detrimental to the [[public relations]] of a brand. For example, following his performance of eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, swimmer [[Michael Phelps]]' contract with [[Kellogg's]] was terminated, as Kellogg's did not want to associate with him after he was photographed smoking marijuana.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Celebrities such as [[Britney Spears]] have advertised for multiple products including Pepsi, Candies from Kohl's, Twister, NASCAR, and Toyota.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n;[[Aerial advertising|Aerial]]: Using aircraft, [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloons]] or [[airship]]s to create or display advertising media.

Pop-up, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], banner, pop-under, [[advergaming]], and email advertisements (all of which are often unwanted or spam in the case of email) are now commonplace. Particularly since the rise of \"entertaining\" advertising, some people may like an advertisement enough to wish to watch it later or show a friend.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} In general, the advertising community has not yet made this easy, although some have used the Internet to widely distribute their ads to anyone willing to see or hear them. In the last three quarters of 2009, mobile and Internet advertising grew by 18% and 9% respectively, while older media advertising saw declines: \u221210.1% (TV), \u221211.7% (radio), \u221214.8% (magazines) and \u221218.7% (newspapers).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Between 2008 and 2014, U.S. newspapers lost more than half their print advertising revenue.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Schwartz|first1=Jason|title=Will John Henry Save the Globe?|url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/|magazine=Boston Magazine|date=March 2014|page=133}}</ref>\n\n=== Niche marketing ===\n\nAnother significant trend regarding future of advertising is the growing importance of the [[niche market]] using niche or targeted ads. Also brought about by the Internet and the theory of the [[long tail]], advertisers will have an increasing ability to reach specific audiences. In the past, the most efficient way to deliver a message was to blanket the largest [[mass market]] audience possible.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} However, usage tracking, customer profiles and the growing popularity of niche content brought about by everything from blogs to social networking sites, provide advertisers with audiences that are smaller but much better defined,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} leading to ads that are more relevant to viewers and more effective for companies' marketing products. Among others, [[Comcast Spotlight]] is one such advertiser employing this method in their [[video on demand]] menus. These advertisements are targeted to a specific group and can be viewed by anyone wishing to find out more about a particular business or practice, from their home. This causes the viewer to become proactive and actually choose what advertisements they want to view.<ref>[http://www.comcastspotlight.com/sites/Default.aspx?pageid=7608&siteid=62&subnav=3 \"Interactive \u2013 VOD\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326200208/http://www.comcastspotlight.com/sites/Default.aspx?pageid=7608&siteid=62&subnav=3 |date=March 26, 2009 }} \"Comcast Spotlight website\". Retrieved October 5, 2006.</ref>\nNiche marketing could also be helped by bringing the issue of colour into advertisements. Different colours play major roles when it comes to marketing strategies, for example, seeing the blue can promote a sense of calmness and gives a sense of security which is why many social networks such as Facebook use blue in their logos.   \n[[Google AdSense]] is an example of niche marketing. Google calculates the primary purpose of a website and adjusts ads accordingly; it uses keywords on the page (or even in emails) to find the general ideas of topics disused and places ads that will most likely be clicked on by viewers of the email account or website visitors.\n\n=== Crowdsourcing ===\n{{Main|Crowdsourcing}}\n\nThe concept of crowdsourcing has given way to the trend of [[user-generated]] advertisements. User-generated ads are created by people, as opposed to an advertising agency or the company themselves, often resulting from brand sponsored advertising competitions. For the 2007 Super Bowl, the Frito-Lays division of [[PepsiCo]] held the \"Crash the Super Bowl\" contest, allowing people to create their own [[Doritos]] commercials.<ref name=\"Advertising Age\">{{cite news |url=http://adage.com/SuperBowlBuyers/ |title=Who's Buying What at Super Bowl 2007 |publisher=Advertising Age |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218070122/http://adage.com/SuperBowlBuyers/ |archivedate=February 18, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Chevrolet]] held a similar competition for their Tahoe line of SUVs.<ref name=\"Advertising Age\" /> Due to the success of the Doritos user-generated ads in the 2007 Super Bowl, Frito-Lays relaunched the competition for the 2009 and 2010 Super Bowl. The resulting ads were among the most-watched and most-liked Super Bowl ads. In fact, the winning ad that aired in the 2009 Super Bowl was ranked by the [[USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter]] as the top ad for the year while the winning ads that aired in the 2010 Super Bowl were found by Nielsen's BuzzMetrics to be the \"most buzzed-about\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/business/media/09adco.html |title=Do-It-Yourself Super Ads |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 8, 2010 |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |first=Stuart |last=Elliott |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217050431/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/business/media/09adco.html |archivedate=February 17, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/admeter/2009admeter.htm |title='Two nobodies from nowhere' craft winning Super Bowl ad |newspaper=USA Today |date=December 31, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |first=Bruce |last=Horovitz |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227030845/http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/admeter/2009admeter.htm |archivedate=December 27, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Another example of companies using crowdsourcing successfully is the beverage company [[Jones Soda]] that encourages consumers to participate in the label design themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://adage.com/article/digitalnext/crowdsourcing/132873/ |title=Crowdsourcing: Everything Old Is New Again, and Again |website=adage.com |date=2008-11-26 |accessdate=2019-03-04}}</ref>\n\nThis trend has given rise to several online platforms that host user-generated advertising competitions on behalf of a company.

For [[Global marketing|global advertisers]], there are four, potentially competing, business objectives that must be balanced when developing worldwide advertising: building a brand while speaking with one voice, developing [[economies of scale]] in the creative process, maximising local effectiveness of ads, and increasing the company's speed of implementation. Born from the evolutionary stages of global marketing are the three primary and fundamentally different approaches to the development of global advertising executions: exporting executions, producing local executions, and importing ideas that travel.<ref>Global marketing Management, 2004, pp. 13\u20138</ref>\n\nAdvertising research is key to determining the success of an ad in any country or region. The ability to identify which elements and/or moments of an ad contribute to its success is how [[economies of scale]] are maximized. Once one knows what works in an ad, that idea or ideas can be imported by any other market. [[Market research]] measures, such as [[Wikt:flow of attention|Flow of Attention]], [[Wikt:flow of emotion|Flow of Emotion]] and [[Wikt:branding moment|branding moments]] provide insight into what is working in an ad in any country or region because the measures are based on the visual, not verbal, elements of the ad.<ref>Young, p.131</ref>\n\n=== Foreign public messaging ===\n{{See also|Soft power|International tourism advertising}}\n\nForeign governments,{{which|date=December 2014}} particularly those that own marketable commercial products or services, often promote their interests and positions through the advertising of those goods because the target audience is not only largely unaware of the forum as a vehicle for foreign messaging but also willing to receive the message while in a mental state of absorbing information from advertisements during television commercial breaks, while reading a periodical, or while passing by billboards in public spaces. A prime example of this messaging technique is advertising campaigns to promote international travel. While advertising foreign destinations and services may stem from the typical goal of increasing revenue by drawing more tourism, some travel campaigns carry the additional or alternative intended purpose of promoting good sentiments or improving existing ones among the target audience towards a given nation or region. It is common for advertising promoting foreign countries to be produced and distributed by the tourism ministries of those countries, so these ads often carry political statements and/or depictions of the foreign government's [[Perception management|desired international public perception]]. Additionally, a wide range of foreign airlines and travel-related services which advertise separately from the destinations, themselves, are owned by their respective governments; examples include, though are not limited to, the [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates airline]] ([[Dubai]]), [[Singapore Airlines]] (Singapore), [[Qatar Airways]] ([[Qatar]]), [[China Airlines]] ([[Taiwan]]/[[Republic of China]]), and [[Air China]] (People's Republic of China). By depicting their destinations, airlines, and other services in a favorable and pleasant light, countries market themselves to populations abroad in a manner that could mitigate prior public impressions.\n\n=== Diversification ===\n\nIn the realm of [[advertising agencies]], continued industry diversification has seen observers note that \"big global clients don't need big global agencies any more\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Howard |first=Theresa |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-10-09-goodson-profile_x.htm |title=USA Today, October 9, 2005 |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=October 10, 2005 |accessdate=April 20, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327010633/http://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-10-09-goodson-profile_x.htm |archivedate=March 27, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> This is reflected by the growth of non-traditional agencies in various global markets, such as Canadian business [[TAXI (advertising agency)|TAXI]] and [[SMART (advertising agency)|SMART]] in Australia and has been referred to as \"a revolution in the ad world\".<ref>{{cite magazine\n |url         = http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/12/12/8363132/index.htm\n |title       = Madison Ave. Lights Up\n |first       = Devin\n |last        = Leonard\n |magazine   = [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]\n |date        = December 12, 2005\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090606210859/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/12/12/8363132/index.htm\n |archivedate = June 6, 2009\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n=== New technology ===\n[[File:Facebook advertising.jpg|thumb|Human billboard at the [[National Multicultural Festival]] being used to advertise Facebook news feed]]\nThe ability to record shows on [[digital video recorder]]s (such as TiVo) allow watchers to record the programs for later viewing, enabling them to fast forward through commercials. Additionally, as more seasons of pre-recorded [[box set]]s are offered for sale of television programs; fewer people watch the shows on TV. However, the fact that these sets are '''sold''', means the company will receive additional profits from these sets.\n\nTo counter this effect, a variety of strategies have been employed. Many advertisers have opted for product placement on TV shows like [[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]. Other strategies include integrating advertising with internet-connected [[EPG|program guides]]s (EPGs), advertising on companion devices (like smartphones and tablets) during the show, and creating [[mobile apps]] for TV programs. Additionally, some like brands have opted for [[social television]] sponsorship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com/2011/05/09/survivor-jeff-probst-says-product-placement-is-here-to-stay/|title=Reality TV|website=realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419064602/http://realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com/2011/05/09/survivor-jeff-probst-says-product-placement-is-here-to-stay/|archivedate=April 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe emerging technology of [[drone display]]s has recently been used for advertising purposes.<ref>[https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2016/11/intel-launches-500-drones-into-sky-and-breaks-world-record-in-spectacular-style-449886 Intel launches 500 drones into sky and breaks world record in spectacular style]</ref>\n\n=== Advertising education ===\n\nIn recent years there have been several media literacy initiatives, and more specifically concerning advertising, that seek to empower citizens in the face of media advertising campaigns.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Britt|last2=Schellens|first2=Tammy|last3=Valcke|first3=Martin|date=2017|title=Promoting Adolescents' Moral Advertising Literacy in Secondary Education|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=93\u2013103|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-09|issn=1134-3478|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n[[Advertising education]] has become popular with bachelor, master and doctorate degrees becoming available in the emphasis.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A surge in advertising interest is typically attributed to the strong relationship advertising plays in cultural and technological changes, such as the advance of online social networking.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A unique model for teaching advertising is the [[student-run advertising agency]], where advertising students create campaigns for real companies.<ref>{{Cite book\n |url         = http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED351711&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=ED351711\n |title       = Student-Run Advertising Agency: A Showcase for Student Work.\n |first       = James\n |last        = Avery\n |date        = 1992-08-01\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090724163231/http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true\n |archivedate = July 24, 2009\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref> Organizations such as the [[American Advertising Federation]] establish companies with students to create these campaigns.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n== Purposes ==\nAdvertising is at the front of delivering the proper message to customers and prospective customers. The purpose of advertising is to inform the consumers about their product and convince customers that a company's services or products are the best, enhance the image of the company, point out and create a need for products or services, demonstrate new uses for established products, announce new products and programs, reinforce the salespeople's individual messages, draw customers to the business, and to hold existing customers.<ref>{{cite book|title = How to start and succeed in a business of your own |first=John| last=Taylor| year = 1978| page=293}}</ref>\n\n=== Sales promotions and brand loyalty ===\nSales promotions are another way to advertise. Sales promotions are double purposed because they are used to gather information about what type of customers one draws in and where they are, and to jump start sales. Sales promotions include things like contests and games, sweepstakes, product giveaways, samples coupons, loyalty programs, and discounts. The ultimate goal of sales promotions is to stimulate potential customers to action.<ref>Altstiel, Tom, and Jean Grow. Advertising Strategy: Creative Tactics From the Outside/In.

It entails numerous forms of research which employ different methodologies. Advertising research includes pre-testing (also known as [[copy testing]]) and post-testing of ads and/or campaigns.\n\nPre-testing includes a wide range of qualitative and quantitative techniques, including: focus groups, in-depth target audience interviews (one-on-one interviews), small-scale quantitative studies and physiological measurement. The goal of these investigations is to better understand how different groups respond to various messages and visual prompts, thereby providing an assessment of how well the advertisement meets its communications goals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.copytesting.org|title=CopyTesting.org|website=www.copytesting.org|access-date=2017-02-13|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425021551/http://copytesting.org/|archivedate=April 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nPost-testing employs many of the same techniques as pre-testing, usually with a focus on understanding the change in awareness or attitude attributable to the advertisement. With the emergence of digital advertising technologies, many firms have begun to continuously post-test ads using real-time data. This may take the form of A/B split-testing or multivariate testing.\n\nContinuous [[ad tracking]] and the [[Communicus]] System are competing examples of post-testing advertising research types.<ref>Peeter Verlegh, Hilde Voorveld, and Martin Eisend, eds.

Advertising has many hidden signs and meanings within [[brand names]], [[logos]], package designs, print advertisements, and [[television advertisements]]. Semiotics aims to study and interpret the message being conveyed in (for example) advertisements. Logos and advertisements can be interpreted at two levels \u2013 known as the surface level and the underlying level. The surface level uses signs creatively to create an image or personality for a product.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} These signs can be images, words, fonts, [[color]]s, or slogans. The underlying level is made up of hidden meanings. The combination of images, words, [[color]]s, and slogans must be interpreted by the audience or consumer.<ref>{{cite book|last= Beasley|first= Ron|title= Persuasive Signs: The Semiotics of Advertising|year= 2002|publisher= Walter deGruyter GmbH & KG|location= Berlin, Germany|isbn= 978-3-11-017341-3}}</ref> The \"key to advertising analysis\" is the signifier and the signified.

The signifier is the color, brand name, logo design, and technology. The signified has two meanings known as denotative and connotative. The denotative meaning is the meaning of the product. A television's denotative meaning might be that it is high definition. The connotative meaning is the product's deep and hidden meaning. A connotative meaning of a television would be that it is top-of-the-line.<ref>{{cite book|last= Umiker-Sebeok|first= Donna Jean|title= Marketing and Semiotics|year= 1987|publisher= Walter de Gruyter & Co.|location= Berlin}}</ref>\n\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] commercials{{when|date=April 2015}} used a black [[silhouette]] of a person that was the age of Apple's target market. They placed the silhouette in front of a blue screen so that the picture behind the silhouette could be constantly changing. However, the one thing that stays the same in these ads is that there is music in the background and the silhouette is listening to that music on a white iPod through white headphones. Through advertising, the white color on a set of earphones now signifies that the music device is an iPod. The white color signifies almost all of Apple's products.<ref>{{cite web|last= Salsburey|first= Justin|title= Semiotic analysis of iPod Advertisements|url= http://sites.google.com/site/jsalsburey/macintoshsemiotics|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130521105135/https://sites.google.com/site/jsalsburey/macintoshsemiotics|archivedate= May 21, 2013|df= mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe semiotics of [[gender]] plays a key influence on the way in which signs are interpreted. When considering [[Gender advertisement|gender roles in advertising]], individuals are influenced by three categories. Certain characteristics of stimuli may enhance or decrease the elaboration of the message (if the product is perceived as [[feminine]] or [[masculine]]). Second, the characteristics of individuals can affect [[attention]] and elaboration of the message ([[tradition]]al or non-traditional [[gender role]] orientation). Lastly, situational factors may be important to influence the elaboration of the message.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ademola|first=Owolabi|title=Effects of Gender-Role Orientation, Sex of Advert Presenter and Product Type on Advertising Effectiveness|journal=European Journal of Scientific Research|year=2005|volume=35|issue=4|pages=537\u2013543}}</ref>\n\nThere are two types of [[marketing communication]] claims-objective and subjective.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Koc|first= Erdogan|title= Impact of gender in marketing communications: the role of cognitive and affective cues|journal= Journal of Marketing Communications|year= 2002|volume= 8|issue= 4|page= 257|doi= 10.1080/13527260210145993}}</ref> Objective claims stem from the extent to which the claim associates the brand with a tangible product or service feature.

Later research by a Danish team<ref>Vestergaard and Schr\u00f8der, ''The Language of Advertising'', 75</ref> found that advertising attempts to persuade men to improve their appearance or performance, whereas its approach to women aims at [[transformation (disambiguation)|transformation]] toward an impossible ideal of female presentation. In Paul Suggett's article \"The Objectification of Women in Advertising\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/advertising-women-and-objectification-38754|title=Advertising Sets Impossible Standards for Women|work=The Balance|access-date=2017-05-07|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326082225/https://www.thebalance.com/advertising-women-and-objectification-38754|archivedate=March 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> he discusses the negative impact that these women in advertisements, who are too perfect to be real, have on women, as well as men, in real life. Advertising's manipulation of women's aspiration to these ideal types as portrayed in film, in erotic art, in advertising, on stage, within music videos, and through other media exposures requires at least a conditioned rejection of female reality, and thereby takes on a highly ideological cast. Studies show that these expectations of women and young girls negatively impact their views about their bodies and appearances. These advertisements are directed towards men. Not everyone agrees: one critic viewed this monologic, gender-specific interpretation of advertising as excessively skewed and politicized.<ref>Splendora, \"Discourse\", Review of Vestergaard and Schr\u00f8der, ''The Language of Advertising'' in ''Language in Society,'' 449</ref>{{qn|date=February 2017}} There are some companies, however, like [[Dove Beauties|Dove]] and [[Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters)|Aerie]] that are creating commercials to portray more natural women, with less [[image manipulation|post production manipulation]], so more women and young girls are able to relate to them.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nMore recent research by Martin (2003) reveals that males and females differ in how they react to advertising depending on their mood at the time of exposure to the ads, and on the affective tone of the advertising. When feeling sad, males prefer happy ads to boost their mood. In contrast, females prefer happy ads when they are feeling happy. The television programs in which ads are embedded influence a viewer's mood state.<ref>\nMartin, Brett A. S.

While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes like the [[Franks]] and the [[Saxons]], the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-derived names ([[Germania Slavica]]). Typical [[Germanisation|Germanised]] place name [[suffix]]es of Slavic origin are ''-ow'', ''-itz'', ''-vitz'', ''-witz'', ''-itzsch'' and ''-in'', [[prefix]]es are ''Windisch'' and ''Wendisch''. The name ''Berlin'' has its roots in the language of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' (\"swamp\").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=978-3-411-06252-2}}</ref> Since the ''Ber-'' at the beginning sounds like the German word ''B\u00e4r'' (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city.

The ''Berliner Urstromtal'' (an ice age [[glacial valley]]), between the low [[Barnim Plateau]] to the north and the [[Teltow plateau]] to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last [[Weichselian glaciation]]. The [[Spree]] follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the [[Gro\u00dfer Wannsee]].

The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin{{snd}} the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany{{snd}} initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.\n\nBerlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing raids]], fires and street battles during World War II, and many of the buildings that remained after the war were demolished in the post-war period in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. Many [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] of pre-war buildings were destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]], while in both systems and in reunified Berlin, various important heritage monuments were also (partly) [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' with e.g., the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the main monuments of the [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and the project to reconstruct the baroque fa\u00e7ades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings are inspired by historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].\n\nClusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|high-rise buildings]] emerge at disperse locations, e.g. [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[City West]], and [[Alexanderplatz]], the latter two representing the previous centers of West and East Berlin, respectively, and the former representing the new Berlin of the 21st century built upon the previous no-man's land of the Berlin Wall.

Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[personification]]s of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.\n\nThe [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The [[Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodelled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.\n\nThe [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.\n\nThe [[Gendarmenmarkt]] is a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. It is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Franz\u00f6sischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.\n\nThe [[Museum Island]] in the [[River Spree]] houses [[Berlin#Museums|five museums]] built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

This includes the [[Hackesche H\u00f6fe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.\n\nThe [[Stra\u00dfe des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east\u2013west axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Gro\u00dfer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Berlin Victory Column|Siegess\u00e4ule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938\u201339 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.\n\nThe [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstra\u00dfe is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous \"[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!\" speech, is in [[Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg]].\n\nWest of the center, [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]] is the residence of the German President. [[Charlottenburg Palace]], which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.\n\nThe [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an observation deck {{convert|126|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.\n\nThe [[Oberbaumbr\u00fccke]] over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of [[Friedrichshain]] and [[Kreuzberg]]. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 [[Berlin U-Bahn]] line. The bridge was completed in a [[brick gothic]] style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge, with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the [[Red Army]] from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a [[Berlin border crossings|checkpoint and border crossing]] between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Main|Demographics of Berlin}}\n[[File:Berlin population2.svg|thumb|left|Berlin's population, 1880\u20132012]]\nAt the end of 2018, the city-state of Berlin had 3.75&nbsp;million registered inhabitants<ref name=\"pop-detail\"/> in an area of {{convert|891.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"statoffice\"/> The city's population density was 4,206 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>.

While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes like the [[Franks]] and the [[Saxons]], the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-derived names ([[Germania Slavica]]). Typical [[Germanisation|Germanised]] place name [[suffix]]es of Slavic origin are ''-ow'', ''-itz'', ''-vitz'', ''-witz'', ''-itzsch'' and ''-in'', [[prefix]]es are ''Windisch'' and ''Wendisch''. The name ''Berlin'' has its roots in the language of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' (\"swamp\").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=978-3-411-06252-2}}</ref> Since the ''Ber-'' at the beginning sounds like the German word ''B\u00e4r'' (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city.

The ''Berliner Urstromtal'' (an ice age [[glacial valley]]), between the low [[Barnim Plateau]] to the north and the [[Teltow plateau]] to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last [[Weichselian glaciation]]. The [[Spree]] follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the [[Gro\u00dfer Wannsee]].

The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin{{snd}} the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany{{snd}} initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.\n\nBerlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing raids]], fires and street battles during World War II, and many of the buildings that remained after the war were demolished in the post-war period in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. Many [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] of pre-war buildings were destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]], while in both systems and in reunified Berlin, various important heritage monuments were also (partly) [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' with e.g., the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the main monuments of the [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and the project to reconstruct the baroque fa\u00e7ades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings are inspired by historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].\n\nClusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|high-rise buildings]] emerge at disperse locations, e.g. [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[City West]], and [[Alexanderplatz]], the latter two representing the previous centers of West and East Berlin, respectively, and the former representing the new Berlin of the 21st century built upon the previous no-man's land of the Berlin Wall.

Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[personification]]s of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.\n\nThe [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The [[Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodelled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.\n\nThe [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.\n\nThe [[Gendarmenmarkt]] is a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. It is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Franz\u00f6sischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.\n\nThe [[Museum Island]] in the [[River Spree]] houses [[Berlin#Museums|five museums]] built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

This includes the [[Hackesche H\u00f6fe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.\n\nThe [[Stra\u00dfe des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east\u2013west axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Gro\u00dfer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Berlin Victory Column|Siegess\u00e4ule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938\u201339 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.\n\nThe [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstra\u00dfe is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous \"[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!\" speech, is in [[Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg]].\n\nWest of the center, [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]] is the residence of the German President. [[Charlottenburg Palace]], which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.\n\nThe [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an observation deck {{convert|126|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.\n\nThe [[Oberbaumbr\u00fccke]] over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of [[Friedrichshain]] and [[Kreuzberg]]. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 [[Berlin U-Bahn]] line. The bridge was completed in a [[brick gothic]] style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge, with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the [[Red Army]] from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a [[Berlin border crossings|checkpoint and border crossing]] between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Main|Demographics of Berlin}}\n[[File:Berlin population2.svg|thumb|left|Berlin's population, 1880\u20132012]]\nAt the end of 2018, the city-state of Berlin had 3.75&nbsp;million registered inhabitants<ref name=\"pop-detail\"/> in an area of {{convert|891.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"statoffice\"/> The city's population density was 4,206 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>.

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the [[Ducktown Basin Museum]] chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}{{sfn|Emmons & Laney|1926|p=13}}\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

As early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce, and in 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the [[Ducktown Basin Museum]] chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

As early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce, and in 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life.
