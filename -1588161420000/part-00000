It was Presbyterian, [[Church_of_Scotland]]. Located in Ross-Shire, [[Scottish Highlands]]. Originally known as 'An Eaglais Mhor' which means 'Big Church' but often also known locally as: East [[Kirk]]. It was built on virgin land of a shingle bank, very close to the edge of the salt water [[Loch Carron|loch_carron]].\n\n'''Location:''' The building is situated a mile from the village of Lochcarron on the A896, on the [[North_Coast_500]] tourist route. The building and graveyard are situated within the Lochcarron Golf Course at the foot of the Glas Bhelnn mountain 728m, which is connected to the Sgurr a' Gharaldh mountain 732m. The grey topped [[An Ruadh-stac]] 892m, is visible from the graveyard, but not it's taller neighbour red topped [[Maol Cheann-dearg|Maol Chean-dearg]] 933m.

It is also not to be confused with Lochcarron Parish Church, which is the current Parish Church and located in the village. <ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://scotlandschurchestrust.org.uk/church/lochcarron-parish-church/|title=Parish Church|website=scotlandschurchestrust.org.uk/church/lochcarron-parish-church/|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> \n\n'''The building:''' The grade B listed building is sited in the new [[Lochcarron]] Burial Ground, an active graveyard (owned and maintained by the council), which contains the remains of [[Lauchlan Watt]] at the east end of the building (visible in the picture). There are no graves older than the church, those are sited in the graveyard of the 1751 Old Parish Church. The building has been remodelled inside three times since being built <ref name=\":0\" />. The original layout was a central high pulpit with galleries either side. Later it was remodelled into two rooms, the galleries were removed and the pulpit remodelled. A large maintenance was undertaken by [[Alexander_Ross_(architect)]] which included adding skews. In the final remodelling a gallery was placed at the opposite end to the pulpit. Under the gallery are two vestry rooms, steps up to the gallery and a passageway to the porch. The entrance porch was an addition during the remodelling. This is a newer front door as the original access was through two doors either side of the pulpit, these were blocked up when two doors in the rear wall were added, one of these was blocked up when the new porch entrance was added. In fact, the blocked entrance door in the west rear wall was turned into a window. At some point the raised wooden floors were added, as before that it was a soil floor with boards over. <ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lochcarronchurch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lochcarronchurchhistory.pdf|title=History of Church PDF|website=lochcarronchurch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lochcarronchurchhistory.pdf|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\nMajor alterations summary:<br>\n1. Initial design: one large room, galleries either side, high central pulpit with external doors either side of it. The 700 to 800 person capacity.<br>\n2. Two rooms, galleries removed, pulpit remodelled, doors near pulpit closed up, doors opened in rear wall at extreme ends.<br>\n3. Returned to a large room with a gallery installed, with vestry rooms under, at the opposite end to the pulpit. External door opened under gallery. Rear west door sealed.\n\nThe building still contains a '''rare long central communion table''' (similar to the ones in Ardchattan Kirk near Oban and [[Howmore#Church]] in the Outer Hebrides, although the East Kirk table is a continuous table, without a break) and the remodelled pulpit and altar. The wooden floors are intact. It is 26 feet from the floor to the rafters. Though the building looks small from the outside, it is actually very large. In its heyday it was reported to be able to contain 700 to 800 people. <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB7258|title=historicenvironment.scot|website=portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB7258|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref> In the 1930's it was quoted as, \"One of the biggest enclosed spaces in the Highlands.\"\n\nThe four wooden Gothic Y-tracery windows to the front are three and a half meters tall and still original. The windows above the pulpit are also original. There is a very similar, though smaller, church in [[Applecross]]. This now has Y-tracery windows, though smaller windows than the East Kirk, which are uPVC; the original windows were not Y-tracery. <ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://her.highland.gov.uk/Monument/MHG7683|title=Applecross Church|website=her.highland.gov.uk/Monument/MHG7683|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\nWhile a lot of Highland churches follow a similar oblong box design pattern to the East Kirk, the unusual things about it are: the very large ornate Y-tracery windows and the exceptional size of the building. Other than that, in line with the Presbyterian faith, the interior is now modest. The glass is clear, and not stained glass, in order to 'let in the light of the lord'.\n\n'''History: '''The building is private hands since the council sold it in 2005. Previous to 2005 the building had been used for a long time for only funerals. Its size counted against it, as the church divided several times after its being built, starting with the [[Free_Church_of_Scotland_(1843\u20131900)|division]] between the Church of Scotland and the Free Church. The large kirk was no longer needed as other churches were built in the village. In addition to East Kirk and the old East Kirk, there are four more churches in Lochcarron, three currently active. The East Kirk was always notoriously hard to heat with 30 inch thick stone walls, and most remember it as a very cold building to be in. Hence, over its later life the building was rather neglected.

It was Presbyterian, [[Church_of_Scotland]]. Located in Ross-Shire, [[Scottish Highlands]]. Originally known as 'An Eaglais Mhor' which means 'Big Church' but often also known locally as: East [[Kirk]]. It was built on virgin land of a shingle bank, very close to the edge of the salt water [[Loch Carron|loch_carron]].\n\nNot to be confused with the other Old Parish Church of 1751 that is several meters down the road towards the village, and is a ruin.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://her.highland.gov.uk/Monument/MHG7943|title=KirktonKirk|website=her.highland.gov.uk/Monument/MHG7943|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref>. It is also not to be confused with Lochcarron Parish Church, which is the current Parish Church and located in the village. <ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://scotlandschurchestrust.org.uk/church/lochcarron-parish-church/|title=Parish Church|website=scotlandschurchestrust.org.uk/church/lochcarron-parish-church/|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> \n\nThe grade B listed building is sited in the new [[Lochcarron]] Burial Ground, an active graveyard (owned and maintained by the council), which contains the remains of [[Lauchlan Watt]] at the east end of the building (visible in the picture). There are no graves older than the church, those are sited in the graveyard of the 1751 Old Parish Church.\n\nThe building has been remodelled inside three times since being built <ref name=\":0\" />. The original layout was a central high pulpit with galleries either side. Later it was remodelled into two rooms, the galleries were removed and the pulpit remodelled. A large maintenance was undertaken by [[Alexander_Ross_(architect)]] which included adding skews. In the final remodelling a gallery was placed at the opposite end to the pulpit. Under the gallery are two vestry rooms, steps up to the gallery and a passageway to the porch. The entrance porch was an addition during the remodelling. This is a newer front door as the original access was through two doors either side of the pulpit, these were blocked up when two doors in the rear wall were added, one of these was blocked up when the new porch entrance was added. In fact, the blocked entrance door in the west rear wall was turned into a window. At some point the raised wooden floors were added, as before that it was a soil floor with boards over. <ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lochcarronchurch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lochcarronchurchhistory.pdf|title=History of Church PDF|website=lochcarronchurch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lochcarronchurchhistory.pdf|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\nMajor alterations summary:<br>\n1. Initial design: one large room, galleries either side, high central pulpit with external doors either side of it. The 700 to 800 person capacity.<br>\n2. Two rooms, galleries removed, pulpit remodelled, doors near pulpit closed up, doors opened in rear wall at extreme ends.<br>\n3. Returned to a large room with a gallery installed, with vestry rooms under, at the opposite end to the pulpit. External door opened under gallery. Rear west door sealed.\n\nThe building is private hands since the council sold it in 2005. Previous to 2005 the building had been used for a long time for only funerals. Its size counted against it, as the church divided several times after its being built, starting with the [[Free_Church_of_Scotland_(1843\u20131900)|division]] between the Church of Scotland and the Free Church. The large kirk was no longer needed as other churches were built in the village. In addition to East Kirk and the old East Kirk, there are four more churches in Lochcarron, three currently active. The East Kirk was always notoriously hard to heat with 30 inch thick stone walls, and most remember it as a very cold building to be in. Hence, over its later life the building was rather neglected. From 2005 to 2018 it was left mostly untouched after that owner removed the pews, organ and plaster walls. All this was burnt. In 2018 it changed hands again and it now in a process of renovation. The current owners intend to restore it to original condition, although the roof has \"nail sickness\" and needs attention first. <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lochcarronchurch.com/about/|title=Lochcarronchurh.com|website=lochcarronchurch.com/about/|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\nThe building still contains a '''rare long central communion table''' (similar to the ones in Ardchattan Kirk near Oban and [[Howmore#Church]] in the Outer Hebrides, although the East Kirk table is a continuous table, without a break) and the remodelled pulpit and altar. The wooden floors are intact. It is 26 feet from the floor to the rafters. Though the building looks small from the outside, it is actually very large. In its heyday it was reported to be able to contain 700 to 800 people. <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB7258|title=historicenvironment.scot|website=portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB7258|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref> In the 1930's it was quoted as, \"One of the biggest enclosed spaces in the Highlands.\"\n\nThe four wooden Gothic Y-tracery windows to the front are three and a half meters tall and still original. The windows above the pulpit are also original. There is a very similar, though smaller, church in [[Applecross]]. This now has Y-tracery windows, though smaller windows than the East Kirk, which are uPVC; the original windows were not Y-tracery. <ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://her.highland.gov.uk/Monument/MHG7683|title=Applecross Church|website=her.highland.gov.uk/Monument/MHG7683|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\nWhile a lot of Highland churches follow a similar oblong box design pattern to the East Kirk, the unusual things about it are: the very large ornate Y-tracery windows and the exceptional size of the building. Other than that, in line with the Presbyterian faith, the interior is now modest. The glass is clear, and not stained glass, in order to 'let in the light of the lord'.\n\nThe [[North_Coast_500]] tourist route passes on the road to the front of the church.\n\nThe building and graveyard are situated within the Lochcarron Golf Course.\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.
