The new [[national flag]], designed by the then [[Bureau of Heraldry|State Herald]] of South Africa [[Frederick Brownell]], was chosen to represent the country's new democracy after the end of [[apartheid]].\n\nThe flag has horizontal bands of [[red]] (on the top) and [[blue]] (on the bottom), of equal width, separated by a central [[green]] band which splits into a horizontal \"Y\" shape, the arms of which end at the corners of the hoist side (and follow the flag's diagonals). The \"Y\" embraces a [[black]] [[isosceles triangle]] from which the arms are separated by narrow [[yellow]] bands; the red and blue bands are separated from the green band and its arms by narrow [[white]] stripes. The stripes at the fly end are in the 5:1:3:1:5 ratio.

The Union Flag is shown with [[Union Jack#Flying|the hoist on the right]].]]\nDue to the lack of popularity of these flags, there were intermittent discussions about the desirability of a more distinctive national flag for South Africa after 1910,<ref name=\"Brownell2015\" />{{rp|70}} it was only after a coalition government took office in 1925 that a bill was introduced in [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] to introduce a national flag for the Union.  This provoked an often violent controversy that lasted for three years based on whether the British Union Flag should be included in the new flag design or not. The [[Natal Province]] even threatened to [[Natal covenant|secede from the Union]] should it be decided to remove it.\n\nFinally, a compromise was reached that resulted in the adoption of a separate flag for the Union in late 1927 and the design was first hoisted on 31 May 1928. The design was based on the so-called Van Riebeeck flag or \"[[Prince's Flag]]\"  (''Prinsenvlag'' in [[Afrikaans]]) that was originally the [[Flag of the Netherlands|Dutch flag]]; it consisted of orange, white, and blue horizontal stripes. A version of this flag had been used as the flag of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (known as the VOC) at the Cape (with the VOC logo in the centre) from 1652 until 1795. The South African addition to the design was the inclusion of three smaller flags centred in the white stripe. The miniature flags were the British [[Union Flag]] (mirrored) towards the hoist, the [[flag of the Orange Free State]] hanging vertically in the middle and the [[Flag of the South African Republic|Transvaal Vierkleur]] towards the fly. The position of each of the miniature flags is such that each has equal status. However, to ensure that the Dutch flag in the canton of the Orange Free State flag is placed nearest to the upper hoist of the main flag, the Free State flag must be reversed.  The British Union Flag, which is nearest to the hoist and is thus in a more favoured position, is spread horizontally from the Free State flag towards the hoist and is thus also reversed.  Although placed horizontally furthest from the hoist, to balance the British Union Flag, the Vierkleur is the only one of the miniature flags which is spread in the same direction as the main flag. This compensates for its otherwise less favourable position.  In this arrangement, each of the miniature flags enjoy equal precedence.<ref name=\"Brownell1993\" /> Note that the miniature flag of the Orange Free State contains a miniature of the Dutch flag, making the old South African flag the only former national flag in the world containing a flag in a flag in a flag.\n\nThe choice of the ''Prinsenvlag'' (which was believed to be the first flag hoisted on South African soil  by Jan van Riebeeck of the VOC) as the basis upon which to design the South African flag had more to do with compromise than Afrikaner political desires, since the ''Prinsenvlag'' was politically neutral, as it was no longer the national flag of any nation. A further element of this compromise was that the British Union Flag would continue to fly alongside the new South African national flag over official buildings. This dual flag arrangement continued until 1957 when the British Union Flag lost its official status per an [[Act of Parliament]].\n\nFollowing a [[South African republic referendum, 1960|referendum]] the country became a [[republic]] on 31 May 1961, but the design of the flag remained unchanged. However, there was intense pressure to change the flag, particularly from Afrikaners who still resented the fact that the British Union Flag was a part of the flag. In 1968, the then [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]], [[John Vorster]], proposed the adoption of a new flag from 1971, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the declaration of a republic but this never materialised.<ref name=\"Glasgow Herald\">{{Cite news | newspaper= The [[Glasgow Herald]] | title= New flag | date = 12 September 1968 |page= 18 col C | accessdate = 2016-04-18 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4eg9AAAAIBAJ&sjid=oUgMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2838,2158422&dq=south+africa+change+flag+1971&hl=en | language =   | quote =  }}</ref>\n\n===Current flag since 1994 ===\n[[File:New South African flag unveiling.jpg|thumb|South African Ambassador to the U.S. [[Harry Schwarz]] presenting the new flag to the U.S. president [[Bill Clinton]] and vice president [[Al Gore]] in May 1994.]]\n\nThe present South African national flag was first flown on 27 April 1994,<ref name=firstraising>{{youtube|id=Sed-dqbZgkc|title=Raising of the New South African Flag}}</ref> the day of the [[South African general election, 1994|1994 election]].

A final design was adopted on 15 March 1994, derived from a design developed by the State Herald [[Fred Brownell]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27155475|title=Fred Brownell: The man who made South Africa's flag|date=27 April 2014|accessdate=27 April 2014|work=BBC News}}</ref> who had also previously designed the [[Flag of Namibia|Namibian flag]]. This interim flag was hoisted officially for the first time on the 27 April 1994, the day when the nation's first fully inclusive elections commenced which resulted in [[Nelson Mandela]] being inaugurated as South Africa's first democratically elected president on 10 May 1994.<ref name=\"Bornman2006\" /> The flag was well-received by most South Africans, though a small minority objected to it; hundreds of [[Afrikaner Volksfront]] members in [[Bloemfontein]] burned the flag in protest a few weeks before the April 1994 elections.<ref name=firstraising/>\n\n[[File:Pm cricket shots09 6058.jpg|thumb|left|The flag flying at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].]]\n\nThe proclamation of the new national flag by [[South African President]] [[F.

As stated in South Africa's post-apartheid interim constitution, the flag was to be introduced on an interim probationary period of five years, after which there would be discussion about whether or not to change the national flag in the [[Constitution of South Africa|final draft of the constitution]]. The Constitutional Assembly was charged with the responsibility of drafting the country's new constitution and had called for submissions, inter alia, on the issues of its various national symbols.  It received 118 submissions recommending the retention of the new flag and 35 suggesting changes to it.  Thus on 28 September 1995 it decided that the flag should be retained unchanged and accordingly it was included as Section One of the Constitution of South Africa which came into force in February 1997.<ref name=\"Berry2015\" />\n\n== Proper display of the flag ==\n{{See also|List of South African flags}}The South African government published guidelines for proper display of the flag at designated flag stations, in Government Notice 510 of 8 June 2001 (Gazette number 22356).

Once again, as a British dominion the British Union Flag was to continue as the national flag and the standard British ensign pattern was used as a basis for distinctive South African flags.\n\nAs was the case throughout the [[British Empire]], the [[Red Ensign|Red]] and [[Blue Ensign]]s were the official flags for merchant and government vessels at sea, and the British Admiralty authorised them to be [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] in the fly with the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] from the South African [[coat of arms]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fotw.fivestarflags.com/za_1910.html |title=South African Vessels Ensign |accessdate=2005-03-20 |author=Flags of the World }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flaggenlexikon.de/fsuedafr.htm |title=S\u00fcdafrika \u2013 Gro\u00dfbritannien Flaggensystem eingef\u00fchrt |accessdate=2008-05-26 |author=Volker Preu\u00df|language=de}}</ref> These [[ensigns]] were not intended to be used as the Union's national flag, although they were used by some people as such.

The Union Flag is shown with [[Union Jack#Flying|the hoist on the right]].]]\nDue to the lack of popularity of these flags, there were intermittent discussions about the desirability of a more distinctive national flag for South Africa after 1910,<ref name=\"Brownell2015\" />{{rp|70}} it was only after a coalition government took office in 1925 that a bill was introduced in [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] to introduce a national flag for the Union.  This provoked an often violent controversy that lasted for three years based on whether the British Union Flag should be included in the new flag design or not. The [[Natal Province]] even threatened to [[Natal covenant|secede from the Union]] should it be decided to remove it.\n\nFinally, a compromise was reached that resulted in the adoption of a separate flag for the Union in late 1927 and the design was first hoisted on 31 May 1928. The design was based on the so-called Van Riebeeck flag or \"[[Prince's Flag]]\"  (''Prinsenvlag'' in [[Afrikaans]]) that was originally the [[Flag of the Netherlands|Dutch flag]]; it consisted of orange, white, and blue horizontal stripes. A version of this flag had been used as the flag of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (known as the VOC) at the Cape (with the VOC logo in the centre) from 1652 until 1795. The South African addition to the design was the inclusion of three smaller flags centred in the white stripe. The miniature flags were the British [[Union Flag]] (mirrored) towards the hoist, the [[flag of the Orange Free State]] hanging vertically in the middle and the [[Flag of the South African Republic|Transvaal Vierkleur]] towards the fly. The position of each of the miniature flags is such that each has equal status. However, to ensure that the Dutch flag in the canton of the Orange Free State flag is placed nearest to the upper hoist of the main flag, the Free State flag must be reversed.  The British Union Flag, which is nearest to the hoist and is thus in a more favoured position, is spread horizontally from the Free State flag towards the hoist and is thus also reversed.  Although placed horizontally furthest from the hoist, to balance the British Union Flag, the Vierkleur is the only one of the miniature flags which is spread in the same direction as the main flag. This compensates for its otherwise less favourable position.  In this arrangement, each of the miniature flags enjoy equal precedence.<ref name=\"Brownell1993\" /> Note that the miniature flag of the Orange Free State contains a miniature of the Dutch flag, making the old South African flag the only former national flag in the world containing a flag in a flag in a flag.\n\nThe choice of the ''Prinsenvlag'' (which was believed to be the first flag hoisted on South African soil  by Jan van Riebeeck of the VOC) as the basis upon which to design the South African flag had more to do with compromise than Afrikaner political desires, since the ''Prinsenvlag'' was politically neutral, as it was no longer the national flag of any nation. A further element of this compromise was that the British Union Flag would continue to fly alongside the new South African national flag over official buildings. This dual flag arrangement continued until 1957 when the British Union Flag lost its official status per an [[Act of Parliament]].\n\nFollowing a [[South African republic referendum, 1960|referendum]] the country became a [[republic]] on 31 May 1961, but the design of the flag remained unchanged. However, there was intense pressure to change the flag, particularly from Afrikaners who still resented the fact that the British Union Flag was a part of the flag. In 1968, the then [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]], [[John Vorster]], proposed the adoption of a new flag from 1971, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the declaration of a republic but this never materialised.<ref name=\"Glasgow Herald\">{{Cite news | newspaper= The [[Glasgow Herald]] | title= New flag | date = 12 September 1968 |page= 18 col C | accessdate = 2016-04-18 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4eg9AAAAIBAJ&sjid=oUgMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2838,2158422&dq=south+africa+change+flag+1971&hl=en | language =   | quote =  }}</ref>\n\n===Current flag since 1994 ===\n[[File:New South African flag unveiling.jpg|thumb|South African Ambassador to the U.S. [[Harry Schwarz]] presenting the new flag to the U.S. president [[Bill Clinton]] and vice president [[Al Gore]] in May 1994.]]\n\nThe present South African national flag was first flown on 27 April 1994,<ref name=firstraising>{{youtube|id=Sed-dqbZgkc|title=Raising of the New South African Flag}}</ref> the day of the [[South African general election, 1994|1994 election]].

A number of design studios were then contacted to submit further proposals, but these also did not find favour. [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] went into [[recess (motion)|recess]] at the end of 1993 without a suitable candidate for the new national flag.\n\nIn February 1994, [[Cyril Ramaphosa]] and [[Roelf Meyer]], the chief negotiators of the [[African National Congress]] and the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government of the day respectively, were given the task of resolving the flag issue. A final design was adopted on 15 March 1994, derived from a design developed by the State Herald [[Fred Brownell]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27155475|title=Fred Brownell: The man who made South Africa's flag|date=27 April 2014|accessdate=27 April 2014|work=BBC News}}</ref> who had also previously designed the [[Flag of Namibia|Namibian flag]]. This interim flag was hoisted officially for the first time on the 27 April 1994, the day when the nation's first fully inclusive elections commenced which resulted in [[Nelson Mandela]] being inaugurated as South Africa's first democratically elected president on 10 May 1994.<ref name=\"Bornman2006\" /> The flag was well-received by most South Africans, though a small minority objected to it; hundreds of [[Afrikaner Volksfront]] members in [[Bloemfontein]] burned the flag in protest a few weeks before the April 1994 elections.<ref name=firstraising/>\n\n[[File:Pm cricket shots09 6058.jpg|thumb|left|The flag flying at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].]]\n\nThe proclamation of the new national flag by [[South African President]] [[F. W. de Klerk]] was only published on 20 April 1994,<ref name=\"proc\"/> a mere seven days before the flag was to be inaugurated, sparking a frantic last-minute flurry for flag manufacturers. As stated in South Africa's post-apartheid interim constitution, the flag was to be introduced on an interim probationary period of five years, after which there would be discussion about whether or not to change the national flag in the [[Constitution of South Africa|final draft of the constitution]]. The Constitutional Assembly was charged with the responsibility of drafting the country's new constitution and had called for submissions, inter alia, on the issues of its various national symbols.  It received 118 submissions recommending the retention of the new flag and 35 suggesting changes to it.  Thus on 28 September 1995 it decided that the flag should be retained unchanged and accordingly it was included as Section One of the Constitution of South Africa which came into force in February 1997.<ref name=\"Berry2015\" />\n\n== Proper display of the flag ==\n{{See also|List of South African flags}}The South African government published guidelines for proper display of the flag at designated flag stations, in Government Notice 510 of 8 June 2001 (Gazette number 22356).
