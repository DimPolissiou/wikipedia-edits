Later in 1218, a German army led by Oliver of Cologne, and a mixed army of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Frisians|Frisian]] soldiers led by [[William I, Count of Holland]] joined the crusade. In order to attack [[Damietta]] in Egypt, they allied in [[Anatolia]] with the [[Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] which attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts.\n\nAfter occupying the port of [[Damietta]], the Crusaders marched south towards [[Cairo]] in July 1221, but were turned back after their dwindling supplies led to a forced retreat.  A nighttime attack by Sultan [[Al-Kamil]] resulted in a great number of crusader losses, and eventually in the surrender of the army.  Al-Kamil agreed to an eight-year peace agreement with Europe.\n\n==Preparations==\n[[Pope Innocent III]] had already planned since 1208 a crusade to recapture Jerusalem. In April 1213 he issued the [[papal bull]] ''[[Quia maior]]'', calling all of [[Christendom]] to join a new [[crusade]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Thomas W.|date=2019|title=How to craft a crusade call: Pope Innocent III and Quia maior (1213)|journal=Historical Research|language=en|volume=92|issue=255|pages=2\u201323|doi=10.1111/1468-2281.12258|issn=1468-2281}}</ref> This was followed by another papal bull, the ''Ad Liberandam'' in 1215.<ref name=\"cf\">{{Citation |author=Christopher Tyerman| authorlink = Christopher Tyerman |title=God's war: a new history of the Crusades |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-02387-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/godswarnewhistor00tyer }}</ref>\n\n===France===\nThe message of the crusade was preached in France by [[Robert of Cour\u00e7on]]; unlike other Crusades, few French knights joined, as they were already fighting the [[Albigensian Crusade]] against the [[Heresy|heretical]] [[Cathar]] sect in southern France.\n\nIn 1215 Pope Innocent III summoned the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], where, along with the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Raoul of Merencourt]], he discussed the recovery of the Holy Land, among other church business. Pope Innocent wanted it to be led by the [[papacy]], as the [[First Crusade]] should have been, to avoid the mistakes of the [[Fourth Crusade]], which had been taken over by the [[Venice|Venetians]]. Pope Innocent planned for the crusaders to meet at [[Brindisi]] in 1216, and prohibited trade with the Muslims, to ensure that the crusaders would have ships and weapons. Every crusader would receive an [[indulgence]], including those who simply helped pay the expenses of a crusader, but did not go on crusade themselves.\n\n===Hungary and Germany===\n[[Oliver of Paderborn]] had preached the crusade in [[Holy Roman Empire]], and [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] attempted to join in 1215. Frederick was the last monarch Innocent wanted to join, as he had challenged the [[Papacy]] (and would do so in the years to come). Innocent died in 1216 and was succeeded by [[Pope Honorius III]], who barred Frederick from participating, but organized crusading armies led by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]]. Andrew had the largest royal army in the history of the crusades (20,000 knights and 12,000 castle-garrisons).{{citation needed|date = January 2013}}\n\n===Portugal===\nAccording to [[Oliver of Paderborn]], the ''[[Gesta crucignorum rhenanorum]] '' and ''[[De itinere frisonum]]'', many of the Crusaders from the [[Rhineland]], [[Flanders]], and [[Friesland]] decided to go to the [[Holy Land]] by their traditional sea journey. The fleet made their first stop at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] on the southern coast of England. There they elected their leaders and the laws by which they would organize their venture. From there led by Counts [[William I of Holland]] and [[George of Weid]] they continued on their way south to Lisbon. As in previous crusading seaborne journeys, the fleet was dispersed by storms and only gradually managed to reach the Portuguese city of Lisbon after making a stopover at the famous shrine of [[Santiago de Compostela]].<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"A Frisian Perspective on Crusading in Iberia as Part of the Sea Journey to the Holy Land 1217-1218\", ''Studies in Medieval and Renaissance History'' 15 (2019)</ref>\nAt their arrival in Portugal as during the second Crusade, the Bishop of Lisbon and other members of the Portuguese clergy attempted to persuade the crusaders to help them capture the [[Almohad]] controlled city of [[Alc\u00e1cer do Sal]].

According to William of Holland in his letter to [[Pope Honorius III]] the Almohad leader of the garrison with 2000 of his followers converted to Christianity after they had surrendered the town to the crusading forces.

Georgia's largely isolationist policies had allowed it to accumulate a powerful army and a very large concentration of knights. However, the reconnaissance force under the Mongols [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]] destroyed the entire Georgian army in two successive battles, most notably at the [[Battle of Khunan]]. After the death of Georgian King [[George IV of Georgia|George IV Lasha]], his sister [[Rusudan of Georgia|Queen Rusudan]] wrote to the Pope informing him that Georgia was unable to fulfill its promise to assist in the Crusade because its army had been destroyed by unknown savages. It has been speculated that the oddly passive behavior of the Crusaders in the later years was due to them waiting for the Georgian army to join the fray.<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan. DaCapo Press (2015), 322-327.</ref>\n\nDecades after this Crusade, Mongol ruler Hulegu Khan would take a census of the Kingdom of Georgia to ascertain how many troops it could muster. According to contemporary sources, the kingdom was judged to be able to field nine tumens.<ref>M.F. Brosset, \"Historie de la Georgie,\" I (St. Petersburg, 1849), pp. 548-549.</ref> A tumen was nominally 10,000 men, but usually averaged 5,000 in reality.<ref>David Morgan, \"The Mongols,\" 1986, p. 72. Morgan expresses skepticism that a tumen actually consisted of 10,000 men and notes that most were 3,000 to 7,000 men.</ref> If Hulegu's census was accurate, then the kingdom of Georgia in the 13th century was capable of mustering 45,000 soldiers. Had a force this size joined the Fifth Crusade, it would have more than doubled the Crusaders' strength.\n\n==Campaign==\n[[File:Ondrej.jpg|thumb|left|180px|King [[Andrew II of Hungary]]]]\n\n===Holy Land===\nThe first to take up the cross in the Fifth Crusade was King [[Andrew II of Hungary]].<ref>[[Alexander Mikaberidze]]: ''Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia'', Volume 1 (page 311)</ref> In July 1217, Andrew departed from [[Zagreb]], accompanied by [[Leopold VI of Austria]] and [[Otto I, Duke of Merania]].{{sfn|Van Cleve|1969|pp=387\u2013388}}{{sfn|\u00c9rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=133}} King Andrew's army was so large{{mdash}}at least 10,000 mounted soldiers and even much more \"uncountable\" infantrymen{{mdash}}that most of it stayed behind when Andrew and his men embarked in Split two months later.{{sfn|Van Cleve|1969|pp=387\u2013388}}{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|pp=147\u2013148}} They were transported by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] fleet, which was the largest European fleet in the era. {{sfn|Richard|1999|p=297}} Andrew and his troops embarked on 23 August 1217, in [[Split, Croatia|Split]].

Muslims fled the city, afraid that there would be a repeat of the bloodbath of the [[First Crusade]] in 1099. The crusaders' catapults and [[trebuchet]]s did not arrive in time, so they had fruitless assaults on the fortresses of the [[Lebanon]] and on [[Mount Tabor]].

They could not gain Damietta itself, and in the ensuing months diseases killed many of the crusaders, including [[Robert of Cour\u00e7on]]. Al-Adil also died and was succeeded by [[Al-Kamil]]. Meanwhile, Honorius III sent [[Pelagius of Albano]] to lead the crusade in 1219 . Al-Kamil tried to negotiate peace with the crusaders. He offered to trade [[Damietta]] for [[Jerusalem]], but Pelagius would not accept these offers. After hearing this [[William I, Count of Holland]] left the crusade and sailed home.  In August or September, [[Francis of Assisi]] arrived in the crusader camp and crossed over to preach to Al-Kamil. By November, the crusaders had worn out the sultan's forces, and were finally able to occupy the port.\n\nImmediately the papal and secular powers fought for control of the town, with [[John of Brienne]] claiming it for himself in 1220. Pelagius would not accept this, and John returned to Acre later that year. Pelagius hoped Frederick II would arrive with a fresh army, but he never did; instead, after a year of inactivity in both Syria and Egypt, [[John of Brienne]] returned. \n\nThen in July 1221, excited by rumors that the army of one King David, a descendant of the legendary [[Prester John]], was on its way from the east to the Holy Land to join the crusade, the crusaders at Damietta marched south towards [[Cairo]].<ref>Christopher Eric Taylor, ''Waiting for Prester John: The Legend, the Fifth Crusade, and Medieval Christian Holy War'', 2011, University of Texas at Austin.</ref> This move was observed by the forces of Al-Kamil, and frequent raids along the flanks of the army led to the withdrawal of some 2000 German troops who refused to continue the advance and returned to Damietta.\n\nBy now Al-Kamil was able to ally with the other [[Ayyubid]]s in Syria, who had defeated [[Keykavus I]]. The crusader march to [[Cairo]] was disastrous; the river [[Nile]] flooded ahead of them, stopping the crusader advance. A dry canal that they had previously crossed by flooded, thus blocking the crusader army's retreat. With supplies dwindling, a forced retreat began, culminating in a nighttime attack by Al-Kamil which resulted in a great number of crusader losses and eventually in the surrender of the army under Pelagius.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe terms of this surrender meant the relinquishing of [[Damietta]] to Al-Kamil in exchange for the release of the crusaders. Al-Kamil agreed to an eight-year peace agreement with Europe and to return a piece of the [[True Cross]]. However, the relic was never returned as Al-Kamil did not, in fact, have it.\n\nThe failure of the Crusade caused an outpouring of anti-papal sentiment from the [[Occitan]] poet [[Guilhem Figueira]]. The more orthodox [[Gormonda de Monpeslier]] responded to Figueira's ''D'un sirventes far'' with a song of her own, ''Greu m'es a durar''. Instead of blaming Pelagius or the Papacy, she laid the blame on the \"foolishness\" of the wicked.\n\n==Impact on literature==\nThe ''[[Pal\u00e4stinalied]]'' is a famous lyric poem by [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] written in [[Middle High German]] describing a [[pilgrim]] travelling to the [[Holy Land]] during the height of the Fifth Crusade.<ref>Kaye, Haley Caroline, \"The Troubadours and the Song of the Crusades\" (2016).Senior Projects Spring 2016.Paper 280. http://digitalcommons.bard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&context=senproj_s2016.

Later in 1218, a German army led by Oliver of Cologne, and a mixed army of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Frisians|Frisian]] soldiers led by [[William I, Count of Holland]] joined the crusade. In order to attack [[Damietta]] in Egypt, they allied in [[Anatolia]] with the [[Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] which attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts.\n\nAfter occupying the port of [[Damietta]], the Crusaders marched south towards [[Cairo]] in July 1221, but were turned back after their dwindling supplies led to a forced retreat.  A nighttime attack by Sultan [[Al-Kamil]] resulted in a great number of crusader losses, and eventually in the surrender of the army.  Al-Kamil agreed to an eight-year peace agreement with Europe.\n\n==Preparations==\n[[Pope Innocent III]] had already planned since 1208 a crusade to recapture Jerusalem. In April 1213 he issued the [[papal bull]] ''[[Quia maior]]'', calling all of [[Christendom]] to join a new [[crusade]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Thomas W.|date=2019|title=How to craft a crusade call: Pope Innocent III and Quia maior (1213)|journal=Historical Research|language=en|volume=92|issue=255|pages=2\u201323|doi=10.1111/1468-2281.12258|issn=1468-2281}}</ref> This was followed by another papal bull, the ''Ad Liberandam'' in 1215.<ref name=\"cf\">{{Citation |author=Christopher Tyerman| authorlink = Christopher Tyerman |title=God's war: a new history of the Crusades |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-02387-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/godswarnewhistor00tyer }}</ref>\n\n===France===\nThe message of the crusade was preached in France by [[Robert of Cour\u00e7on]]; unlike other Crusades, few French knights joined, as they were already fighting the [[Albigensian Crusade]] against the [[Heresy|heretical]] [[Cathar]] sect in southern France.\n\nIn 1215 Pope Innocent III summoned the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], where, along with the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Raoul of Merencourt]], he discussed the recovery of the Holy Land, among other church business. Pope Innocent wanted it to be led by the [[papacy]], as the [[First Crusade]] should have been, to avoid the mistakes of the [[Fourth Crusade]], which had been taken over by the [[Venice|Venetians]]. Pope Innocent planned for the crusaders to meet at [[Brindisi]] in 1216, and prohibited trade with the Muslims, to ensure that the crusaders would have ships and weapons. Every crusader would receive an [[indulgence]], including those who simply helped pay the expenses of a crusader, but did not go on crusade themselves.\n\n===Hungary and Germany===\n[[Oliver of Paderborn]] had preached the crusade in [[Holy Roman Empire]], and [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] attempted to join in 1215. Frederick was the last monarch Innocent wanted to join, as he had challenged the [[Papacy]] (and would do so in the years to come). Innocent died in 1216 and was succeeded by [[Pope Honorius III]], who barred Frederick from participating, but organized crusading armies led by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]]. Andrew had the largest royal army in the history of the crusades (20,000 knights and 12,000 castle-garrisons).{{citation needed|date = January 2013}}\n\n===Portugal===\nAccording to [[Oliver of Paderborn]], the ''[[Gesta crucignorum rhenanorum]] '' and ''[[De itinere frisonum]]'', many of the Crusaders from the [[Rhineland]], [[Flanders]], and [[Friesland]] decided to go to the [[Holy Land]] by their traditional sea journey. The fleet made their first stop at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] on the southern coast of England. There they elected their leaders and the laws by which they would organize their venture.

According to William of Holland in his letter to [[Pope Honorius III]] the Almohad leader of the garrison with 2000 of his followers converted to Christianity after they had surrendered the town to the crusading forces. From there on the Crusading fleet continued on its journey to the Levant.<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alc\u00e1cer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\", ''Al-Masaq'' 30:1 (2019), 64. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573</ref>\n\n===Georgia===\nPope Innocent had managed to secure Georgia's participation in the crusade.

In Jerusalem, the walls and fortifications were demolished to prevent the Christians from being able to defend the city, if they did manage to reach it and take it. Muslims fled the city, afraid that there would be a repeat of the bloodbath of the [[First Crusade]] in 1099. The crusaders' catapults and [[trebuchet]]s did not arrive in time, so they had fruitless assaults on the fortresses of the [[Lebanon]] and on [[Mount Tabor]]. Afterwards, Andrew spent his time collecting alleged relics.

They could not gain Damietta itself, and in the ensuing months diseases killed many of the crusaders, including [[Robert of Cour\u00e7on]]. Al-Adil also died and was succeeded by [[Al-Kamil]]. Meanwhile, Honorius III sent [[Pelagius of Albano]] to lead the crusade in 1219 . Al-Kamil tried to negotiate peace with the crusaders. He offered to trade [[Damietta]] for [[Jerusalem]], but Pelagius would not accept these offers. After hearing this [[William I, Count of Holland]] left the crusade and sailed home.  In August or September, [[Francis of Assisi]] arrived in the crusader camp and crossed over to preach to Al-Kamil. By November, the crusaders had worn out the sultan's forces, and were finally able to occupy the port.\n\nImmediately the papal and secular powers fought for control of the town, with [[John of Brienne]] claiming it for himself in 1220. Pelagius would not accept this, and John returned to Acre later that year. Pelagius hoped Frederick II would arrive with a fresh army, but he never did; instead, after a year of inactivity in both Syria and Egypt, [[John of Brienne]] returned. \n\nThen in July 1221, excited by rumors that the army of one King David, a descendant of the legendary [[Prester John]], was on its way from the east to the Holy Land to join the crusade, the crusaders at Damietta marched south towards [[Cairo]].<ref>Christopher Eric Taylor, ''Waiting for Prester John: The Legend, the Fifth Crusade, and Medieval Christian Holy War'', 2011, University of Texas at Austin.</ref> This move was observed by the forces of Al-Kamil, and frequent raids along the flanks of the army led to the withdrawal of some 2000 German troops who refused to continue the advance and returned to Damietta.\n\nBy now Al-Kamil was able to ally with the other [[Ayyubid]]s in Syria, who had defeated [[Keykavus I]]. The crusader march to [[Cairo]] was disastrous; the river [[Nile]] flooded ahead of them, stopping the crusader advance. A dry canal that they had previously crossed by flooded, thus blocking the crusader army's retreat. With supplies dwindling, a forced retreat began, culminating in a nighttime attack by Al-Kamil which resulted in a great number of crusader losses and eventually in the surrender of the army under Pelagius.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe terms of this surrender meant the relinquishing of [[Damietta]] to Al-Kamil in exchange for the release of the crusaders. Al-Kamil agreed to an eight-year peace agreement with Europe and to return a piece of the [[True Cross]]. However, the relic was never returned as Al-Kamil did not, in fact, have it.\n\nThe failure of the Crusade caused an outpouring of anti-papal sentiment from the [[Occitan]] poet [[Guilhem Figueira]]. The more orthodox [[Gormonda de Monpeslier]] responded to Figueira's ''D'un sirventes far'' with a song of her own, ''Greu m'es a durar''. Instead of blaming Pelagius or the Papacy, she laid the blame on the \"foolishness\" of the wicked.\n\n==Impact on literature==\nThe ''[[Pal\u00e4stinalied]]'' is a famous lyric poem by [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] written in [[Middle High German]] describing a [[pilgrim]] travelling to the [[Holy Land]] during the height of the Fifth Crusade.<ref>Kaye, Haley Caroline, \"The Troubadours and the Song of the Crusades\" (2016).Senior Projects Spring 2016.Paper 280. http://digitalcommons.bard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&context=senproj_s2016.

The protagonist is Julia Martin, Rhys's fictional counterpart.

Locked in her room, she reads most of the time.\n\nThough attractive at thirty-six, she feels past her prime, fatigued and fatalistic. After a failed early marriage roaming Europe and the death of a baby, she had drifted to Paris during the ''[[Ann\u00e9es folles]]''. She has survived for six months on 300 [[French franc|francs]] a week from ex-lover Mr Mackenzie, posted each Tuesday by high-handed solicitor Henri Legros. One Tuesday Ma\u00eetre Legros writes informing Julia he is instructed to terminate the allowance, enclosing final payment of 1,500 francs. That evening she follows Mr Mackenzie down the [[Boulevard du Montparnasse]] to Restaurant Albert. She sits at his table, pours herself wine from his carafe and confronts him. She ends saying she doesn't want his severance cheque, slaps him lightly around the face [[Duel|with her glove]] and walks out.\n\nFrom a nearby table Englishman George Horsfield has watched the incident. When Julia exits, Mr Horsfield follows and befriends her, buys her a drink in another caf\u00e9 and takes her to a cinema. Afterwards, seeing her cry, the awkward Mr Horsfield invites her to his hotel to talk. He pours whiskey and she describes fragments of her life since leaving London the February after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|1918 armistice]] a decade or so earlier. When Mr Horsfield asks if she is stuck for money, she takes from her purse two ten franc notes and some coins, saying that is all she has. She recounts to him her rejection of Mr Mackenzie's severance cheque (which Mr Horsfield had witnessed in Restaurant Albert). Mr Horsfield gives her another 1,500 francs, suggests she visit London and jots down his address there.\n\n'''Part Two''' \n\nIn London Julia books into at a drab [[Bloomsbury]] hotel. The first morning she walks aimlessly, reminiscing. In [[Woburn Square]] a familiar old flower seller man ignores her when she buys his violets. On [[Tottenham Court Road]] she envisages a ghost of her younger self emerge from the fog. She crosses [[Tottenham Court Road|Oxford Street]] into [[Charing Cross Road]], gets lost in [[Soho]] and stops at a [[J. Lyons and Co.|Lyons tea shop]], overhearing patrons chatter while a band plays military music.\n\nReunions with her dour Uncle Griffiths and disapproving sister Norah are tense. At his [[Bayswater]] [[boarding house]] Uncle Griffiths says she should have secured a settlement from her ex-husband, prior to Mr Mackenzie. He gives her a pound note but wants little more contact. Living in [[Acton, London|Acton]], Norah has devoted her life to their sick mother, now dying, so is unsympathetic to Julia's plight. Their mother dies during Julia's London visit. Julia attends the funeral at [[Golders Green Crematorium]], causes a scene at the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] and is asked to leave.\n\nShe looks up W. Neil James Esq, her rich and generous first love from when she was nineteen. Ushered into his study, Julia sees Mr James is different. He says he has forty-five minutes. She hints at hardship, but to him this is an old story. He asks to change the subject, looks at the clock, shows her his art collection and sees her out. He posts her twenty pounds, stressing there can be no more. Some of it she spends on new clothes, some on second hand ones. She moves to a boarding house in cheaper [[Notting Hill]].\n\nMr Horsfield, also back in London, takes her for outings, meals and drinks, but withdraws his support as his interest in the troubled Julia wanes. Retreating to his [[Holland Park]] house, he promises to visit her in Paris in a week or ten days.\n\n'''Part Three''' \n\nJulia is back in her cheap Paris hotel on the Quay des Grands Augustins, overlooking the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]]. On the eleventh day she receives a letter from Mr Horsfield explaining he is unable to visit as soon as he had hoped. Enclosing ten pounds, he writes he cannot send more as times are hard. He closes by wishing her the best of luck.\n\nIn the late afternoon, from inside a caf\u00e9 on the [[rue Dauphine]], Mr Mackenzie notices Julia approach on the street. He shields his face so as not to be seen, but she sees him anyway, looks away and passes aimlessly with her head down. Having second thoughts, he leaves and catches up with her at a kerb where she waits to cross. He invites her for a drink, takes her to a caf\u00e9 and buys her a Pernod. She drinks it quickly and asks him to lend her 100 francs. Flustered, he pushes some cash across the table, which she puts in to her bag uncounted. She looks untidy, set to continue in the downward spiral of other Rhys heroines, but accepts Mr Mackenzie's offer of a second drink. He buys her another Pernod and leaves.\n\n== Background ==\nJean Rhys's material for this novel was drawn partly from her late 1927 visit to London for her mother's last days and funeral at Golders Green Crematorium. There, aged thirty-seven, she encountered estranged relatives including her aunt and sisters. This humiliating funeral scene is depicted in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''.<ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's disapproval extended back to Rhys's [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] chorus girl career, which she embarked on against parental wishes after exiting Cambridge's [[Perse School for Girls]] to enrol at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], where she lasted just two terms.<ref>Carr, Helen (2004). \"Williams, Ella Gwendoline Rees (1890\u20131979),\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press.</ref> Showbusiness led to her [[Demimonde|demimondaine]] phase, financed by wealthy first lover Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, until he ended the affair. A backstreet abortion followed, with Smith subsidising her London boarding house life. She became a nude art model in the prelude to [[World War I]]. Her post-war Europe jaunts with first husband Jean Lenglet ended when he served prison time in France and was deported to Holland. Rhys's failure to keep their daughter Maryvonne,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Jean-Rhys/6000000056987680063|title=Jean Rhys|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> who spent much of her infancy in care, seemed another stain on her character. Her extramarital affair in Paris with [[Ford Madox Ford]] compounded this. The Ford affair's aftermath is what ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' explores, with Julia Martin lightly slapping her ex-lover's face with an empty glove in a Paris bar, as Rhys had to Ford.<ref name=pizz2020 /><ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's indifference to the publication of ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]'', and to her grief at the death of first baby William Owen Lenglet, felt unjust to Rhys, who hints at bourgeois prejudice and hypocrisy in this and most of her novels.\n\nOn the same late 1927 London visit, she met for the last time with Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, who for the last time lent her money (as with old flame Mr James in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''). Smith, like others, was tired of her suffering.\n\nBesides visiting London for these purposes, getting ''Quartet'' published necessitated her presence there. A literary agent, divorcee Leslie Tilden Smith, had offered help. In May 1928 she moved into Tilden Smith's Holland Park house (located as per Mr Horsfield's in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'') and began a relationship with him, formalising her separation from Lenglet on 19 June. Tilden Smith would become Rhys's second husband in 1934, the year after her divorce from Lenglet. By the time of ''Quartet''<nowiki/>'s release in September 1928, Rhys was writing ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' with Tilden Smith's full-time support. She wrote in bed while he did the housework and proofread her pages.\n\nIn 1928 she persuaded Tilden Smith to finance a writing trip for her, alone in ''Rive Gauche'' Paris.

Locked in her room, she reads most of the time.\n\nThough attractive at thirty-six, she feels past her prime, fatigued and fatalistic. After a failed early marriage roaming Europe and the death of a baby, she had drifted to Paris during the ''[[Ann\u00e9es folles]]''. She has survived for six months on 300 [[French franc|francs]] a week from ex-lover Mr Mackenzie, posted each Tuesday by high-handed solicitor Henri Legros. One Tuesday Ma\u00eetre Legros writes informing Julia he is instructed to terminate the allowance, enclosing final payment of 1,500 francs. That evening she follows Mr Mackenzie down the [[Boulevard du Montparnasse]] to Restaurant Albert. She sits at his table, pours herself wine from his carafe and confronts him. She ends saying she doesn't want his severance cheque, slaps him lightly around the face [[Duel|with her glove]] and walks out.\n\nFrom a nearby table Englishman George Horsfield has watched the incident. When Julia exits, Mr Horsfield follows and befriends her, buys her a drink in another caf\u00e9 and takes her to a cinema. Afterwards, seeing her cry, the awkward Mr Horsfield invites her to his hotel to talk. He pours whiskey and she describes fragments of her life since leaving London the February after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|1918 armistice]] a decade or so earlier. When Mr Horsfield asks if she is stuck for money, she takes from her purse two ten franc notes and some coins, saying that is all she has. She recounts to him her rejection of Mr Mackenzie's severance cheque (which Mr Horsfield had witnessed in Restaurant Albert). Mr Horsfield gives her another 1,500 francs, suggests she visit London and jots down his address there.\n\n'''Part Two''' \n\nIn London Julia books into at a drab [[Bloomsbury]] hotel. The first morning she walks aimlessly, reminiscing. In [[Woburn Square]] a familiar old flower seller man ignores her when she buys his violets. On [[Tottenham Court Road]] she envisages a ghost of her younger self emerge from the fog. She crosses [[Tottenham Court Road|Oxford Street]] into [[Charing Cross Road]], gets lost in [[Soho]] and stops at a [[J. Lyons and Co.|Lyons tea shop]], overhearing patrons chatter while a band plays military music.\n\nReunions with her dour Uncle Griffiths and disapproving sister Norah are tense. At his [[Bayswater]] [[boarding house]] Uncle Griffiths says she should have secured a settlement from her ex-husband, prior to Mr Mackenzie. He gives her a pound note but wants little more contact. Living in [[Acton, London|Acton]], Norah has devoted her life to their sick mother, now dying, so is unsympathetic to Julia's plight. Their mother dies during Julia's London visit. Julia attends the funeral at [[Golders Green Crematorium]], causes a scene at the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] and is asked to leave.\n\nShe looks up W. Neil James Esq, her rich and generous first love from when she was nineteen. Ushered into his study, Julia sees Mr James is different. He says he has forty-five minutes. She hints at hardship, but to him this is an old story. He asks to change the subject, looks at the clock, shows her his art collection and sees her out. He posts her twenty pounds, stressing there can be no more. Some of it she spends on new clothes, some on second hand ones. She moves to a boarding house in cheaper [[Notting Hill]].\n\nMr Horsfield, also back in London, takes her for outings, meals and drinks, but withdraws his support as his interest in the troubled Julia wanes. Retreating to his [[Holland Park]] house, he promises to visit her in Paris in a week or ten days.\n\n'''Part Three''' \n\nJulia is back in her cheap Paris hotel on the Quay des Grands Augustins, overlooking the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]]. On the eleventh day she receives a letter from Mr Horsfield explaining he is unable to visit as soon as he had hoped. Enclosing ten pounds, he writes he cannot send more as times are hard. He closes by wishing her the best of luck.\n\nIn the late afternoon, from inside a caf\u00e9 on the [[rue Dauphine]], Mr Mackenzie notices Julia approach on the street. He shields his face so as not to be seen, but she sees him anyway, looks away and passes aimlessly with her head down. Having second thoughts, he leaves and catches up with her at a kerb where she waits to cross. He invites her for a drink, takes her to a caf\u00e9 and buys her a Pernod. She drinks it quickly and asks him to lend her 100 francs. Flustered, he pushes some cash across the table, which she puts in to her bag uncounted. She looks untidy, set to continue in the downward spiral of other Rhys heroines, but accepts Mr Mackenzie's offer of a second drink. He buys her another Pernod and leaves.\n\n== Background ==\nJean Rhys's material for this novel was drawn partly from her late 1927 visit to London for her mother's last days and funeral at Golders Green Crematorium. There, aged thirty-seven, she encountered estranged relatives including her aunt and sisters. This humiliating funeral scene is depicted in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''.<ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's disapproval extended back to Rhys's [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] chorus girl career, which she embarked on against parental wishes after exiting Cambridge's [[Perse School for Girls]] to enrol at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], where she lasted just two terms.<ref>Carr, Helen (2004). \"Williams, Ella Gwendoline Rees (1890\u20131979),\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press.</ref> Showbusiness led to her [[Demimonde|demimondaine]] phase, financed by wealthy first lover Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, until he ended the affair. A backstreet abortion followed, with Smith subsidising her London boarding house life. She became a nude art model in the prelude to [[World War I]]. Her post-war Europe jaunts with first husband Jean Lenglet ended when he served prison time in France and was deported to Holland. Rhys's failure to keep their daughter Maryvonne,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Jean-Rhys/6000000056987680063|title=Jean Rhys|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> who spent much of her infancy in care, seemed another stain on her character. Her extramarital affair in Paris with [[Ford Madox Ford]] compounded this. The Ford affair's aftermath is what ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' explores, with Julia Martin lightly slapping her ex-lover's face with an empty glove in a Paris bar, as Rhys had to Ford.<ref name=pizz2020 /><ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's indifference to the publication of ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]'', and to her grief at the death of first baby William Owen Lenglet, felt unjust to Rhys, who hints at bourgeois prejudice and hypocrisy in this and most of her novels.\n\nOn the same late 1927 London visit, she met for the last time with Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, who for the last time lent her money (as with old flame Mr James in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''). Smith, like others, was tired of her suffering.\n\nBesides visiting London for these purposes, getting ''Quartet'' published necessitated her presence there. A literary agent, divorcee Leslie Tilden Smith, had offered help. In May 1928 she moved into Tilden Smith's Holland Park house (located as per Mr Horsfield's in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'') and began a relationship with him, formalising her separation from Lenglet on 19 June. Tilden Smith would become Rhys's second husband in 1934, the year after her divorce from Lenglet. By the time of ''Quartet''<nowiki/>'s release in September 1928, Rhys was writing ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' with Tilden Smith's full-time support. She wrote in bed while he did the housework and proofread her pages.\n\nIn 1928 she persuaded Tilden Smith to finance a writing trip for her, alone in ''Rive Gauche'' Paris. She stayed in the Hotel Henri IV behind the Quay des Grands Augustins, inhabiting the world of ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''<nowiki/>'s Julia Martin who lives in the same hotel.
