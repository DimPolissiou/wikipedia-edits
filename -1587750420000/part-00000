In a racing career which lasted from October 2000 until October 2001 he ran eight times and won six races. He is best known for winning [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]], [[Irish Derby Stakes]], and [[King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes]] in 2001 and for his rivalry with the [[Godolphin Racing|Godolphin]] [[European Horse of the Year|champion]] [[Fantastic Light]]. He was named the [[Cartier Champion Three-year-old Colt|European Champion Three-Year-Old Colt]] of 2001.\n\nSince his retirement, Galileo has become one of the most sought after sires in the world. He first became the [[leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland]] in 2008, then consecutively earned the title from 2010 through 2019. In 2019, he tied the record for the number of Epsom Derby winners sired at four: [[New Approach]], [[Ruler of the World|Ruler Of The World]], [[Australia (horse)|Australia]] and [[Anthony Van Dyck (horse)|Anthony Van Dyck]]. In 2019, he also tied Danehill for the all-time record of Group/Grade I winners sired with 84. In addition to his Derby winners, his notable offspring including [[Frankel (horse)|Frankel]], [[Nathaniel (horse)|Nathaniel]], [[Found (horse)|Found]], [[Churchill (horse)|Churchill]] and [[Minding (horse)|Minding]].

In a racing career which lasted from October 2000 until October 2001 he ran eight times and won six races. He is best known for winning [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]], [[Irish Derby Stakes]], and [[King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes]] in 2001 and for his rivalry with the [[Godolphin Racing|Godolphin]] [[European Horse of the Year|champion]] [[Fantastic Light]]. He was named the [[Cartier Champion Three-year-old Colt|European Champion Three-Year-Old Colt]] of 2001.\n\nSince his retirement, Galileo has become one of the most sought after sires in the world. He first became the [[leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland]] in 2008, then consecutively earned the title from 2010 through 2019. In 2019, he tied the record for the number of Epsom Derby winners sired at four: [[New Approach]], [[Ruler of the World|Ruler Of The World]], [[Australia (horse)|Australia]] and [[Anthony Van Dyck (horse)|Anthony Van Dyck]]. In 2019, he also tied Danehill for the all-time record of Group/Grade I winners sired with 84. In addition to his Derby winners, his notable offspring including [[Frankel (horse)|Frankel]], [[Nathaniel (horse)|Nathaniel]], [[Found (horse)|Found]], [[Churchill (horse)|Churchill]] and [[Minding (horse)|Minding]].

The betting suggested that the race would be a match between Galileo (1/2 favourite) and the [[Godolphin Racing|Godolphin]] five-year-old Fantastic Light (7-2), who had won Group One races in four different countries. Such were the reputations of these two horses that the third choice in the betting, the [[Prix du Jockey Club]] winner Anabaa Blue, started at 18/1.

O'Brien entered Ice Dancer in the race to act as pacemaker and ensure a stamina test. The plan failed as the rest of the riders ignored Ice Dancer, who went ten lengths clear before stopping abruptly in the straight. Fantastic Light took the lead two furlongs out, and Kinane immediately moved Galileo up to join him.

About {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} north of the village is a junction with the [[A14 road (Great Britain)|A14 road]] that runs between the [[M1 motorway|M1]] and [[M6 motorway]] interchange at [[Catthorpe]] east to [[Cambridge]] and the east coast port of [[Felixstowe]].\n\nThe village is popular with commuters to [[Leicester]], [[Peterborough]], [[Birmingham]] and [[London]]. The nearest railway stations for London are at Northampton, for [[Euston railway station|EUS (Euston)]], and Kettering for [[St Pancras railway station|STP (St Pancras)]] and for Leicester [[Leicester Railway Station|LEI (London Rd)]] at [[Market Harborough station|Market Harborough]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz FO110J engine.jpg|thumb|F1 engine made by [[Ilmor]] in Brixworth]]\nA lengthy article about the history of the parish appears in the Victoria County History for Northamptonshire, volume 4, which was published in 1937. Its text can be consulted at British History Online.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brixworth|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66338|accessdate=2013-02-07}}</ref>\n\nThe main road from Northampton to Market Harborough passed through the village, where a number of inns served the needs of travellers for refreshment, lodging and a change of horses. The buildings of two present-day pubs in the village date back to the era of horse-drawn transport:\n* \"The George Inn\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The George Inn Brixworth|url=http://www.thegeorgeatbrixworth.co.uk/|accessdate=2013-02-07}}</ref>\n* \"The Coach and Horses\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Coach and Horses Brixworth|url=http://www.coachandhorsesbrixworth.co.uk/|accessdate=2013-02-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 1819 Sir Charles Knightley purchased land between Spratton Road and Kennel Terrace, where the [[Pytchley Hunt]] then erected kennels, providing a fresh source of local employment at a time of agricultural depression. The Hunt remained in the village until 1966, after which the site was developed for housing.\n\n===The church===\n[[All Saints' Church, Brixworth|All Saints' church]] is one of the oldest, largest and most complete Anglo-Saxon churches in the country. It was founded circa 680 AD and has been called as ''\"The finest Romanesque church north of the [[Alps]]\"''.<ref>Clapham, 1930, page 33, cited in Blair, 1977, page 152</ref>\n\n===Chartism===\nIn June 1839, Brixworth was the scene of notable public meeting addressed by the [[Chartism|Chartist]] [[Robert George Gammage]] of Northampton. Before the meeting took place, Gammage and his two companions attended a service in the parish church where the vicar [[Charles Frederic Watkins]] rebuked them and threatened the three with arrest if the meeting proceeded. Despite this, Gammage recalled that attendance at the roadside assembly later that day amounted to several hundreds and Watkins' efforts to persuade the constable to arrest those who addressed it were unsuccessful.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Becoming a Chartist speaker, and first leaving Northampton in 1840|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/travellers/Gammage/7|author=Robert George Gammage|website=A Vision of Britain Through Time|accessdate=2015-09-16}}</ref>\n\n===Poor Law Union===\nBrixworth Poor Law Union was established in 1835 and a workhouse erected on the south side of Spratton Road soon afterwards. Only the entrance block, including some later side extensions to it, remains; these premises are now used for business purposes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brixworth Poor Law Union|url=http://www.workhouses.org.uk/Brixworth/|accessdate=2015-02-13}}</ref> The activities of the Brixworth Poor Law Union attracted controversy, particularly in the latter part of the 19th century, because of its reluctance to provide relief to poor people unless they agreed to enter the Workhouse. Brixworth is the focus of a substantial work on the political, social and personal implications of welfare policies during the period.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hurren |first=Elizabeth T |authorlink= |title=Protesting About Pauperism: Poverty, Politics and Poor Relief in Late-Victorian England, 1870-1900 |year=2007 |publisher=The Boydell Press |location=Woodbridge |isbn=978-0-86193-292-4|pages=}}</ref> The Workhouse was closed in 1935.\n\n===The railway===\nThe [[Northampton to Market Harborough line|Northampton and Market Harborough railway]] through the parish was opened in 1859, passing {{convert|0.5|mi|m}} west of the village. [[British Rail]]ways closed [[Brixworth railway station]] to passenger traffic in 1960 and closed the line to freight traffic in 1981. The trackbed of the former railway was reopened in 1993 as the [[Brampton Valley Way]].\n\n=== Iron ore quarrying ===\nAt various times iron ore quarrying has been carried out on the north, east and south sides of the village. The ore was taken in various ways to the railway for transport to ironworks. The first quarry can still be seen west of the church at a place called Stonepit Close. It is now allotments. Quarrying began in 1863 and finished about 1874. It is not clear if the ore was taken away by tramway or by horse and road wagon to the station. In about 1873 another quarry was opened nearby, to the north of the church. This was connected by {{RailGauge|4ft}} gauge tramway to sidings at the station. When this was worked out the same tramway served later quarries further east to the north and south of Scaldwell Road, finishing in 1936 south of Scaldwell Road  and in 1947 further north. The later quarries in this system were to the east of the A508.\n\nAnother quarry began in 1873 to the south of the village connected with the railway by {{RailGauge|4ft}} gauge tramway. This was firstly to the west of the main road in the area to the south of Foxhill Crescent and later to the east of the main road in the vicinity of what is now Ashway. Quarrying finished here in about 1912.\n\nA new pit was begun in 1939, operating until 1949. This was operated by the [[Staveley Coal and Iron Company]] and was connected to their quarrying operation at [[Scaldwell]] by an extension of their {{RailGauge|3ft}} gauge tramway. The ore was transported from Scaldwell to sidings near Hanging Houghton via an [[aerial ropeway]]. The aerial ropeway was replaced in 1954 by a [[standard gauge]] branch line.<ref name=\":0\">{{Tonks ironstone |part=3 |page=167-183}}</ref>\n\nAnother quarry began operation in 1880 west of Station Road, opposite Stonepit Close. It had its own tramway to the sidings at Brixworth Station and ceased operation in 1896.\n\nThe {{RailGauge|4ft}} gauge tramways were worked by horse at first but the first steam locomotive was in use by 1879. Quarrying was done by hand at first. The first steam quarrying machine was in use by 1917, and the first diesel machine in 1935<ref name=\":0\" />. Close to the south and east of the village most of the quarried area has had housing and an industrial estate built on it. In the industrial estate the street names Ironstone Way, Quarry Road, Ferro Fields and Staveley Way commemorate the quarries. Apart from Stonepit Close the visible remains of the quarrying are in the form of ground levels  being below the roads and surrounding fields. The industrial estate and part of the churchyard are lower than the original landscape, due to the quarrying activity.\n\n===Village development===\nFrom the 1960s onwards, a large amount of new housing has been built at Brixworth, mainly on fields to the south of the original village. A by-pass on the east side has diverted traffic travelling between Northampton and Market Harborough away from the built-up area. Another major change has been the creation of [[Pitsford Water]] (a reservoir) and [[Brixworth Country Park]], which are a short distance from the village.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brixworth Country Park|url=http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/leisure/countryside/pages/brixworth.aspx|accessdate=2013-02-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216083618/http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/leisure/countryside/pages/brixworth.aspx|archivedate=16 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Notable buildings==\nThe Historic England website contains details of a total of 17 listed buildings in the parish of Brixworth, all of which are Grade II apart from All Saints' Church, which is Grade I.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Historic England \u2013 The List|url= https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/|accessdate=2015-10-05}}</ref> They include:\n*[[All Saints' Church, Brixworth|All Saints' Church]], Church Street<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic England \u2013 Church of St All Saints, Brixworth|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1054866|accessdate=2015-10-06}}</ref>\n*Brixworth War Memorial, All Saints' Churchyard<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic England \u2013 Brixworth War Memorial|url=http://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1426179\n|accessdate=2015-10-06}}</ref>\n*Coach and Horses Inn, Harborough Road<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic England \u2013 Coach & Horses|url=http://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1054853|accessdate=2015-10-06}}</ref>\n*Cross, Church Street<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic England \u2013 The Cross, Brixworth|url=http://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1054847\n|accessdate=2015-10-06}}</ref>\n*Home Farmhouse, Church Street<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic England \u2013 Home Farmhouse|url=http://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1067634|accessdate=2015-10-06}}</ref>\n*Mint Cottage, Church Street<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic England \u2013 Mint Cottage|url=http://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1054839|accessdate=2015-10-06}}</ref>\n*Steps Cottage, Silver Street<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic England \u2013 Steps Cottage|url=http://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1367068|accessdate=2015-10-06}}</ref>\n*The Firs, Saneco Lane<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic England \u2013 The Firs|url=http://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1356624|accessdate=2015-10-06}}</ref>\n*George Inn, Northampton Road<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic England \u2013 The George Inn|url=http://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1367100|accessdate=2015-10-06}}</ref>\n*The Granary, Church Street<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic England \u2013 The Granary|url=http://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1356622|accessdate=2015-10-06}}</ref>\n*The Grange, Kennel Terrace<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic England \u2013 The Grange|url=http://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1356623|accessdate=2015-10-06}}</ref>\n*The Lodge, Northampton Road<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic England \u2013 The Lodge\n|url=http://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1367075\n|accessdate=2015-10-06}}</ref>\n*Manor House, Harborough Road<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic England \u2013 The Manor House|url=http://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1067635|accessdate=2015-10-06}}</ref>\n*Old Vicarage, Church Street<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic England \u2013 The Old Vicarage|url=http://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1067633|accessdate=2015-10-06}}</ref>\n*Pound House, Northampton Road<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic England \u2013 The Pound House|url=http://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1067636|accessdate=2015-10-06}}</ref>\n\n==Brixworth Hall==\n[[File:Neale(1818) p3.124 - Brixworth Hall, Northamptonshire.jpg|thumb|right|Brixworth Hall from page 124 of volume 3 of \"Views of the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland.]]Brixworth Hall was near the church, surrounded by a park and close to the centre of the historic settlement of Brixworth.

About {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} north of the village is a junction with the [[A14 road (Great Britain)|A14 road]] that runs between the [[M1 motorway|M1]] and [[M6 motorway]] interchange at [[Catthorpe]] east to [[Cambridge]] and the east coast port of [[Felixstowe]].\n\nThe village is popular with commuters to [[Leicester]], [[Peterborough]], [[Birmingham]] and [[London]]. The nearest railway stations for London are at Northampton, for [[Euston railway station|EUS (Euston)]], and Kettering for [[St Pancras railway station|STP (St Pancras)]] and for Leicester [[Leicester Railway Station|LEI (London Rd)]] at [[Market Harborough station|Market Harborough]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz FO110J engine.jpg|thumb|F1 engine made by [[Ilmor]] in Brixworth]]\nA lengthy article about the history of the parish appears in the Victoria County History for Northamptonshire, volume 4, which was published in 1937.

The buildings of two present-day pubs in the village date back to the era of horse-drawn transport:\n* \"The George Inn\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The George Inn Brixworth|url=http://www.thegeorgeatbrixworth.co.uk/|accessdate=2013-02-07}}</ref>\n* \"The Coach and Horses\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Coach and Horses Brixworth|url=http://www.coachandhorsesbrixworth.co.uk/|accessdate=2013-02-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 1819 Sir Charles Knightley purchased land between Spratton Road and Kennel Terrace, where the [[Pytchley Hunt]] then erected kennels, providing a fresh source of local employment at a time of agricultural depression. The Hunt remained in the village until 1966, after which the site was developed for housing.\n\n===The church===\n[[All Saints' Church, Brixworth|All Saints' church]] is one of the oldest, largest and most complete Anglo-Saxon churches in the country. It was founded circa 680 AD and has been called as ''\"The finest Romanesque church north of the [[Alps]]\"''.<ref>Clapham, 1930, page 33, cited in Blair, 1977, page 152</ref>\n\n===Chartism===\nIn June 1839, Brixworth was the scene of notable public meeting addressed by the [[Chartism|Chartist]] [[Robert George Gammage]] of Northampton. Before the meeting took place, Gammage and his two companions attended a service in the parish church where the vicar [[Charles Frederic Watkins]] rebuked them and threatened the three with arrest if the meeting proceeded. Despite this, Gammage recalled that attendance at the roadside assembly later that day amounted to several hundreds and Watkins' efforts to persuade the constable to arrest those who addressed it were unsuccessful.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Becoming a Chartist speaker, and first leaving Northampton in 1840|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/travellers/Gammage/7|author=Robert George Gammage|website=A Vision of Britain Through Time|accessdate=2015-09-16}}</ref>\n\n===Poor Law Union===\nBrixworth Poor Law Union was established in 1835 and a workhouse erected on the south side of Spratton Road soon afterwards. Only the entrance block, including some later side extensions to it, remains; these premises are now used for business purposes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brixworth Poor Law Union|url=http://www.workhouses.org.uk/Brixworth/|accessdate=2015-02-13}}</ref> The activities of the Brixworth Poor Law Union attracted controversy, particularly in the latter part of the 19th century, because of its reluctance to provide relief to poor people unless they agreed to enter the Workhouse. Brixworth is the focus of a substantial work on the political, social and personal implications of welfare policies during the period.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hurren |first=Elizabeth T |authorlink= |title=Protesting About Pauperism: Poverty, Politics and Poor Relief in Late-Victorian England, 1870-1900 |year=2007 |publisher=The Boydell Press |location=Woodbridge |isbn=978-0-86193-292-4|pages=}}</ref> The Workhouse was closed in 1935.\n\n===The railway===\nThe [[Northampton to Market Harborough line|Northampton and Market Harborough railway]] through the parish was opened in 1859, passing {{convert|0.5|mi|m}} west of the village. [[British Rail]]ways closed [[Brixworth railway station]] to passenger traffic in 1960 and closed the line to freight traffic in 1981. The trackbed of the former railway was reopened in 1993 as the [[Brampton Valley Way]].\n\n=== Iron ore quarrying ===\nAt various times iron ore quarrying has been carried out on the north, east and south sides of the village. The ore was taken in various ways to the railway for transport to ironworks. The first quarry can still be seen west of the church at a place called Stonepit Close. It is now allotments. Quarrying began in 1863 and finished about 1874. It is not clear if the ore was taken away by tramway or by horse and road wagon to the station. In about 1873 another quarry was opened nearby, to the north of the church. This was connected by {{RailGauge|4ft}} gauge tramway to sidings at the station. When this was worked out the same tramway served later quarries further east to the north and south of Scaldwell Road, finishing in 1936 south of Scaldwell Road  and in 1947 further north. The later quarries in this system were to the east of the A508.\n\nAnother quarry began in 1873 to the south of the village connected with the railway by {{RailGauge|4ft}} gauge tramway. This was firstly to the west of the main road in the area to the south of Foxhill Crescent and later to the east of the main road in the vicinity of what is now Ashway. Quarrying finished here in about 1912.\n\nA new pit was begun in 1939, operating until 1949. This was operated by the [[Staveley Coal and Iron Company]] and was connected to their quarrying operation at [[Scaldwell]] by an extension of their {{RailGauge|3ft}} gauge tramway. The ore was transported from Scaldwell to sidings near Hanging Houghton via an [[aerial ropeway]]. The aerial ropeway was replaced in 1954 by a [[standard gauge]] branch line.<ref name=\":0\">{{Tonks ironstone |part=3 |page=167-183}}</ref>\n\nAnother quarry began operation in 1880 west of Station Road, opposite Stonepit Close. It had its own tramway to the sidings at Brixworth Station and ceased operation in 1896.\n\nThe {{RailGauge|4ft}} gauge tramways were worked by horse at first but the first steam locomotive was in use by 1879. Quarrying was done by hand at first. The first steam quarrying machine was in use by 1917, and the first diesel machine in 1935<ref name=\":0\" />. Close to the south and east of the village most of the quarried area has had housing and an industrial estate built on it. In the industrial estate the street names Ironstone Way, Quarry Road, Ferro Fields and Staveley Way commemorate the quarries. Apart from Stonepit Close the visible remains of the quarrying are in the form of ground levels  being below the roads and surrounding fields. The industrial estate and part of the churchyard are lower than the original landscape, due to the quarrying activity.\n\n===Village development===\nFrom the 1960s onwards, a large amount of new housing has been built at Brixworth, mainly on fields to the south of the original village. A by-pass on the east side has diverted traffic travelling between Northampton and Market Harborough away from the built-up area.

Nicolas Boulerice and [[Olivier Demers]] began the band with S\u00e9bastien Dufour and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Samson.  This configuration lasted only a short time, changing once they met Benoit Bourque (vocals, [[diatonic button accordion]], [[mandolin]], [[bones (instrument)|bones]], and [[step dancing]]) in Vancouver later the same year. With the same interest and passion in folk music, and in spite of the fact that all were engaged in other musical groups at that time, they decided to continue together. Bernard Simard also joined the group on guitar and vocals in the same period. The band officially started in September 2002, and their first album, ''Maudite Moisson'', was released through Borealis Recordings in 2003.<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/le-vent-du-nord-mn0000123436/biography \"Le Vent du Nord\"].

Nicolas Boulerice and [[Olivier Demers]] began the band with S\u00e9bastien Dufour and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Samson.  This configuration lasted only a short time, changing once they met Benoit Bourque (vocals, [[diatonic button accordion]], [[mandolin]], [[bones (instrument)|bones]], and [[step dancing]]) in Vancouver later the same year. With the same interest and passion in folk music, and in spite of the fact that all were engaged in other musical groups at that time, they decided to continue together. Bernard Simard also joined the group on guitar and vocals in the same period. The band officially started in September 2002, and their first album, ''Maudite Moisson'', was released through Borealis Recordings in 2003.<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/le-vent-du-nord-mn0000123436/biography \"Le Vent du Nord\"].

God is a grumpy sadist who created humankind specifically to have something to torment. He manipulates reality via a personal computer which he forbids his family from accessing. One day, Ea sneaks into his office and discovers how He has been mistreating humans. This enrages God who then whips Ea with his belt. Ea decides to rebel against her father. She steals the key to His office and accesses the scheduled dates of death of every human in the world and releases the information to them via their portable telephones. Everyone with a cell phone receives a text message informing them exactly when they will die. Ea then locks God's computer and escapes from the apartment through a washing machine which provides a tunnel to the outside world. Wandering the streets of Brussels, Ea decides to follow in the footsteps of her brother Jesus and write a Brand New Testament as her contribution to the human race. She selects six apostles to narrate their life stories. She first enlists a homeless man, Victor, to be her scribe, since she cannot write well. \n\nThe first apostle is a reclusive woman who lost her left arm in an accident and feels nobody will love her. The second is a man who hates his work and his life, who has decided to never move from a bench in the park now that he knows the date of his death. Ea translates to allow him to converse with a bird. This induces him to follow a flock of birds to the North Pole. The third apostle is a sexually frustrated man who is awkward with women and remains lovesick for a German girl he met once as a boy. With Ea's encouragement, he becomes a voice actor for porn movies, where he encounters and establishes a relationship with his lifelong fixation. The fourth apostle is a man who is fascinated with death and killing. He purchases a rifle and shoots people knowing that, since all death dates are already predetermined, they can not be his responsibility. Ea prods him to shoot a woman, the first apostle. He hits her in her prosthetic arm. Believing this to be a divine signal, he courts the woman and they establish a relationship, and he learns to embrace life instead of death. The fifth apostle is an elderly woman trapped in a loveless marriage, especially now that her husband knows he will outlive her by many years. Ea persuades her to cheat on her husband. She has sex with a young male prostitute, and then forms a love relationship with a gorilla. The gorilla scares her husband away, to her delight. The sixth apostle is a sickly boy who, when he discovered he had only days left to live, decided to live them as a girl. Ea encourages him to live each day as the equivalent of one month. \n\nGod is horrified when he discovers what Ea has done and that he can no longer torment humans. Locked out of his computer, He is powerless. He leaves the apartment using the chute in the laundry room, and in the real world He suffers all the mistreatment and frustrations He created for mankind. He is assaulted by everyone He meets. He discovers to his horror that the tunnel to his apartment has disappeared and He is trapped on Earth powerless and alone. He takes shelter in a church, where his outrageous criticism of his son Jesus Christ provokes a charitable priest into beating him senseless and eventually deporting him to Uzbekistan with a group of illegal immigrants.\n\nEa and her apostles go to the seaside where hundreds of people have gathered to spend the last hours of their lives. An airplane, which happens to be carrying God under police escort, falls out of the sky and threatens to crash onto the beach and kill everyone. At the last moment, however, God's wife realizes that the number of apostles has grown to 18, her favorite number, explores her husband's work space, unwittingly restarts his computer, and begins to configure a new life for mankind. She deletes the messages that notified people of their death date. The airplane regains altitude and a new creation is born under a flower-filled sky. Victor publishes the Brand New Testament which becomes a bestseller and catapults him out of hopeless poverty into a whole new life of fame and fortune. God reaches Uzbekistan where he works on an assembly line manufacturing washing machines. He keeps on searching without success for the washing machine with the escape hatch that will take him back to his apartment.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Beno\u00eet Poelvoorde]] as God\n* [[Catherine Deneuve]] as Martine\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Damiens]] as Fran\u00e7ois\n* [[Yolande Moreau]] as God's wife\n* Pili Groyne as God's daughter, [[Enki|Ea]]\n* [[Laura Verlinden]] as Aur\u00e9lie\n* Serge Larivi\u00e8re as Marc\n* [[David Murgia]] as [[Jesus Christ]]\n* [[Johan Leysen]] as Martine's husband\n* [[Pascal Duquenne]] as Georges\n* [[Johan Heldenbergh]] as The priest\n{{Div end}}\n\n==Reception==\n''The Brand New Testament'' received generally favorable reviews from film critics.

God is a grumpy sadist who created humankind specifically to have something to torment. He manipulates reality via a personal computer which he forbids his family from accessing. One day, Ea sneaks into his office and discovers how He has been mistreating humans. This enrages God who then whips Ea with his belt. Ea decides to rebel against her father. She steals the key to His office and accesses the scheduled dates of death of every human in the world and releases the information to them via their portable telephones. Everyone with a cell phone receives a text message informing them exactly when they will die. Ea then locks God's computer and escapes from the apartment through a washing machine which provides a tunnel to the outside world. Wandering the streets of Brussels, Ea decides to follow in the footsteps of her brother Jesus and write a Brand New Testament as her contribution to the human race. She selects six apostles to narrate their life stories. She first enlists a homeless man, Victor, to be her scribe, since she cannot write well. \n\nThe first apostle is a reclusive woman who lost her left arm in an accident and feels nobody will love her. The second is a man who hates his work and his life, who has decided to never move from a bench in the park now that he knows the date of his death. Ea translates to allow him to converse with a bird. This induces him to follow a flock of birds to the North Pole. The third apostle is a sexually frustrated man who is awkward with women and remains lovesick for a German girl he met once as a boy. With Ea's encouragement, he becomes a voice actor for porn movies, where he encounters and establishes a relationship with his lifelong fixation. The fourth apostle is a man who is fascinated with death and killing. He purchases a rifle and shoots people knowing that, since all death dates are already predetermined, they can not be his responsibility. Ea prods him to shoot a woman, the first apostle. He hits her in her prosthetic arm. Believing this to be a divine signal, he courts the woman and they establish a relationship, and he learns to embrace life instead of death. The fifth apostle is an elderly woman trapped in a loveless marriage, especially now that her husband knows he will outlive her by many years. Ea persuades her to cheat on her husband. She has sex with a young male prostitute, and then forms a love relationship with a gorilla. The gorilla scares her husband away, to her delight. The sixth apostle is a sickly boy who, when he discovered he had only days left to live, decided to live them as a girl. Ea encourages him to live each day as the equivalent of one month. \n\nGod is horrified when he discovers what Ea has done and that he can no longer torment humans. Locked out of his computer, He is powerless. He leaves the apartment using the chute in the laundry room, and in the real world He suffers all the mistreatment and frustrations He created for mankind. He is assaulted by everyone He meets. He discovers to his horror that the tunnel to his apartment has disappeared and He is trapped on Earth powerless and alone. He takes shelter in a church, where his outrageous criticism of his son Jesus Christ provokes a charitable priest into beating him senseless and eventually deporting him to Uzbekistan with a group of illegal immigrants.\n\nEa and her apostles go to the seaside where hundreds of people have gathered to spend the last hours of their lives. An airplane, which happens to be carrying God under police escort, falls out of the sky and threatens to crash onto the beach and kill everyone. At the last moment, however, God's wife realizes that the number of apostles has grown to 18, her favorite number, explores her husband's work space, unwittingly restarts his computer, and begins to configure a new life for mankind. She deletes the messages that notified people of their death date. The airplane regains altitude and a new creation is born under a flower-filled sky. Victor publishes the Brand New Testament which becomes a bestseller and catapults him out of hopeless poverty into a whole new life of fame and fortune. God reaches Uzbekistan where he works on an assembly line manufacturing washing machines. He keeps on searching without success for the washing machine with the escape hatch that will take him back to his apartment.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Beno\u00eet Poelvoorde]] as God\n* [[Catherine Deneuve]] as Martine\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Damiens]] as Fran\u00e7ois\n* [[Yolande Moreau]] as God's wife\n* Pili Groyne as God's daughter, [[Enki|Ea]]\n* [[Laura Verlinden]] as Aur\u00e9lie\n* Serge Larivi\u00e8re as Marc\n* [[David Murgia]] as [[Jesus Christ]]\n* [[Johan Leysen]] as Martine's husband\n* [[Pascal Duquenne]] as Georges\n* [[Johan Heldenbergh]] as The priest\n{{Div end}}\n\n==Reception==\n''The Brand New Testament'' received generally favorable reviews from film critics.

Because his US [[work visa]] did not cover voiceover work, Peters had to record his line in the UK over a live broadcast to the Pixar studio.<ref>{{cite news |title=Turns out everyone's fave 90s TV presenter Andi Peters starred in a Disney film |url=https://metro.co.uk/2016/07/17/turns-out-everyones-fave-90s-tv-presenter-andi-peters-starred-in-a-disney-film-6012415/ |accessdate=4 March 2020 |work=Metro |date=17 July 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206191044/https://metro.co.uk/2016/07/17/turns-out-everyones-fave-90s-tv-presenter-andi-peters-starred-in-a-disney-film-6012415/ |archivedate=6 December 2017 |language=en|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"donnell\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{cc}}\n*{{Twitter|andipeters}}\n*{{IMDb name|0676318}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Peters, Andi}}\n[[Category:1970 births]]\n[[Category:Black English television personalities]]\n[[Category:English people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines descent]]\n[[Category:English television presenters]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Children's television presenters]]\n", "name_user": "95.145.209.125", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(DNA investigation)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andi_Peters"}
