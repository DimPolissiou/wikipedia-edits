But parts of it were given as jagirs to Rahim Ullah Khan (a half-brother of Agar Ullah Khan) and other parts to Gulab Singh.{{sfn|Panikkar, Gulab Singh|1930|p=40}}\n\nFollowing the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] and the [[Treaty of Amritsar (1846)]], all the territories between the [[Ravi River]] and the [[Indus River|Indus]] were transferred to Gulab Singh, and he was recognised as an independent Maharaja of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]]. Thus Rajouri became a part of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir.<ref name=SATP>Sudhir S.

In 1904, this tehsil was separated from Bhimber and affiliated with the [[Reasi]] district.<ref name=SATP/>\n\n=== Partition ===\nAfter the [[Partition of India]] and the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India in October 1947, there followed the [[First Kashmir War]] between India and Pakistan. The Pakistani raiders, along with the rebels and deserters from the western districts of the state, captured Rajouri on 7 November 1947. The 30,000 Hindus and Sikhs living in Rajouri were reportedly killed, wounded or abducted.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBwNAAAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y|title=Operations in Jammu & Kashmir, 1947-48|last=Prasad|first=Sri Nandan|last2=Pal|first2=Dharm|date=1987-01-01|publisher=History Division, Ministry of Defence, Government of India|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=49\u201350|language=en}}</ref>{{sfn|V.

Rane, despite being wounded, launched a bold tank assault by conveying the tanks over the [[Tawi River|Tawi]] river bed in order to avoid the road blocks along the main road.{{refn|Rama Raghoba Rane received a [[Param Vir Chakra]] for his gallantry.}} When the Indian Army entered the town, the captors had fled, having destroyed most of the town and killing all its inhabitants. After the arrival of the Army, some 1,500 refugees that had fled to the hills, including women and children, returned to the town.{{sfn|Sarkar, Outstanding Victories of the Indian Army|2016|pp=37\u201340}}\n\nThe ceasefire line at the end of the War ran to the west of the Rajouri-Reasi district.\n\n=== Inside India ===\nSoon after the war, the Rajouri and Reasi tehsils were separated. The Rajouri tehsil was merged with the Indian-administered [[Poonch district, India|Poonch district]] to form the Poonch-Rajouri district.<ref name=SATP/>  The Reasi tehsil was merged with the [[Udhampur district]].\n\nOn 1 January 1968, the two tehsils were reunited and the resulting district was named the Rajouri district.<ref name=SATP/>\n\nThe Reasi tehsil was also separated out in 2006 into a separate [[Reasi district]]. The present Rajouri district comprises the 1947 Rajouri tehsil.\n\nRajouri witnessed some of the toughest fighting during the [[Second Kashmir War]] in 1965. Pakistani infiltration in Kashmir during [[Operation Gibraltar]] caused Rajouri to be initially captured from the [[Indian Army]] by undercover Pakistani commandos with the aid of local [[Mujahideen]]. But the wider operation failed and, with all-out war with India looming, Pakistan withdrew its troops. Major [[Malik Munawar Khan Awan]], a Pakistani commando officer who led the attack on Rajouri on the night of 15 September 1965, was later awarded the title \"King of Rajouri\" by the [[Government of Pakistan]].<ref name=\"dawn\">{{cite news |work=Dawn |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1024793/the-20-watt-fountain-of-energy |title=The 20-watt fountain of energy |first=Anjum |last=Niaz |date=21 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nRajouri is located at {{Coord|33.38|N|74.3|E|}}.<ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/12/Rajouri.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Rajouri]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It has an average elevation of 915&nbsp;[[metre]]s (3001&nbsp;[[foot (length)|feet]]).\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate of Rajouri is somewhat cooler than the other surrounding plains.

An inscription of the period 339 AD found in Mulbagal Taluk describes all in Sanskrit and begins with the praise of Shiva whose throne is said to be on the lofty peak of the mountain called Nandi, obviously the present Nandidurga, a hill considered to be the personification of Nandi, the bull of Shiva. The inscription records the grant of the village Mudiyanur (also callled Chudagrama, a Sanskritised forw of Mudiyanur) to 25 Brahmins by Vadhuvallabha-Malladeva- Nandivarma, son of Vijayaditya Deva and grandson of Nandi- varma,, a promoter of Mahabali's dynasty. The king, who was in the town of Avanya (Avani), is said to have made the Bana dynasty prosperous and has been compared with Bodhisatva.\n\nThe Banas seem to have been a strong power almost upto the Decline of end of the 9th century. In the battle of Soremati about 874, Banas they, together with the Vaidumbas, are said to have defeated the Gangas and the Nolambas. Further, their inscriptions of 898, 905 and 909 A.D. mention no overlord. But all the same, the Banas had adversaries on all sides, and their power was continually being undermined since the close of the 9th century. They ultimately appear to have lost their independence by the first half of the lOth century at the latest.. If the Nolamba king Mahendra (c. 870-897) is described as the destroyer of the Mahabali family, the Chola king Viranarayana or Parantaka claims in 921 to have uprooted by force two Bana kings and con- ferred the title of Banadhiraja on the Ganga prince Prithvipathi II, who helped him in this task. In 961, which is the date of the latest Bana inscription in this district, we find one King Sambayya ruling a small district under the Pallava king Iriva Nolamba or Dilipa. But the Banas did not disappear altogether from the political history, as is evident from the references to them in some later literary works and inscriptions. Stray Bana records have been found outside this district, particularly in the south, upto as late as the first quarter of the 16th century A.D. The history of the Banas, who, during a period of more than a thousand years, moved from district to district, from the Andhra-desha in the north to the Pandya country in the far south where they were governors of Madurai under the Vijayanagara kings, is particularly interesting in that it illustrates the long survival of a dynasty by migrations.\n\n==Hindu mythologies==\nMahabali is described in early Hindu mythologies as a benevolent and generous king, but violent and surrounded by ''asura'' associates who abused power.

King Brihadbana was the grandson of Mahabali. Last known ruling king of this generation was King Sambayya under Nolamba Lordship.They were in constant conflicts with Nolambas and Western Gangas of the Kolar region. They had Vaidumbas as their allies. They had the present day Avani region (a small village in Kolar District) as their capital.\n\nThey had a black flag and a bull crest as their emblem. An inscription of the period 339 AD found in Mulbagal Taluk describes all in Sanskrit and begins with the praise of Shiva whose throne is said to be on the lofty peak of the mountain called Nandi, obviously the present Nandidurga, a hill considered to be the personification of Nandi, the bull of Shiva. The inscription records the grant of the village Mudiyanur (also callled Chudagrama, a Sanskritised forw of Mudiyanur) to 25 Brahmins by Vadhuvallabha-Malladeva- Nandivarma, son of Vijayaditya Deva and grandson of Nandi- varma,, a promoter of Mahabali's dynasty. The king, who was in the town of Avanya (Avani), is said to have made the Bana dynasty prosperous and has been compared with Bodhisatva.\n\nThe Banas seem to have been a strong power almost upto the Decline of end of the 9th century. In the battle of Soremati about 874, Banas they, together with the Vaidumbas, are said to have defeated the Gangas and the Nolambas. Further, their inscriptions of 898, 905 and 909 A.D. mention no overlord. But all the same, the Banas had adversaries on all sides, and their power was continually being undermined since the close of the 9th century. They ultimately appear to have lost their independence by the first half of the lOth century at the latest.. If the Nolamba king Mahendra (c. 870-897) is described as the destroyer of the Mahabali family, the Chola king Viranarayana or Parantaka claims in 921 to have uprooted by force two Bana kings and con- ferred the title of Banadhiraja on the Ganga prince Prithvipathi II, who helped him in this task. In 961, which is the date of the latest Bana inscription in this district, we find one King Sambayya ruling a small district under the Pallava king Iriva Nolamba or Dilipa. But the Banas did not disappear altogether from the political history, as is evident from the references to them in some later literary works and inscriptions. Stray Bana records have been found outside this district, particularly in the south, upto as late as the first quarter of the 16th century A.D. The history of the Banas, who, during a period of more than a thousand years, moved from district to district, from the Andhra-desha in the north to the Pandya country in the far south where they were governors of Madurai under the Vijayanagara kings, is particularly interesting in that it illustrates the long survival of a dynasty by migrations.\n\n==Hindu mythologies==\nMahabali is described in early Hindu mythologies as a benevolent and generous king, but violent and surrounded by ''asura'' associates who abused power.

Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct.

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the [[Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day]] in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a [[shotgun shell]] that couldn't detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{cite news |last1=Trukhina |first1=Lyudmila |title=Satisfied with the results of the year |url=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm |work=[[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]] |date=December 20, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei P.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel.

The riot began when a [[Lynching|lynch mob]] stormed the county jail in search of Maurice Mays, a biracial man who had been accused of murdering a white woman. Unable to find Mays, the rioters looted the jail and fought a pitched gun battle with the residents of a predominantly black neighborhood. The [[Tennessee National Guard]], which at one point fired two machine guns indiscriminately into this neighborhood, eventually dispersed the rioters. <ref name=lakin> {{harvnb|Lakin|2000|pp=1\u201329}}</ref> <ref name= \"Booker p. \">{{harvnb|Booker|2001|p=}}</ref> <ref name= \"Williams p. \">{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=}}</ref> At the end of August 1919 the ''Great Falls Daily Tribune'' reported four killed in a \"race war riot\"<ref name= \"Great Falls Daily Tribune p. 1\">{{harvnb|Great Falls Daily Tribune|1919|p=1}}</ref> while the ''Washington Times'' reported \"Scores dead.\"<ref name= \"Washington Times p. 1\">{{harvnb|Washington Times|1919|p=1}}</ref> Other newspapers placed the death toll at just two, though eyewitness accounts suggest it was much higher.<ref name=lakin />\n\nThe Riot of 1919 was one of several violent racial incidents that occurred during the so-called [[Red Summer (1919)|Red Summer]] when race riots plagued cities across the United States.  The riot was one of the worst racial episodes in Knoxville's history and shattered the city's vision of itself as a racially tolerant Southern town.<ref>Mark Banker, ''Appalachians All: East Tennesseans and the Elusive History of an American Region'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2010), pp. 105\u2013106.</ref> After the riot, many black residents left Knoxville, and racial violence continued to flare up sporadically in subsequent years.<ref name=lakin />\n\n==Background==\n\n===Post-World War I racial tensions===\nIn the decades following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Knoxville was considered by both black and white residents to be one of the few racially tolerant cities in the [[Southern United States|South]]. It was one of the few where black citizens could vote, hold public office, and serve as police officers.<ref name=lakin /> In 1918, [[Charles W. Cansler]] (1871\u20131953), one of the city's leading African-American citizens, wrote to the governor of Tennessee, \"In no place in the world can there be found better relations existing between the races than here in our own county of Knox. No race riots have ever disgraced our city and no mob has ever vented its fury here upon any Negro victim.\"<ref name=lakin />\n\nDuring the [[recession]] that followed [[World War I]], however, migrants poured into Knoxville, overcrowding the city's slums. This increased competition for an already diminished number of jobs, and heightened tensions between black residents and [[working class]] whites. Both the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)]] set up chapters in Knoxville in 1918.<ref name=lakin /> Furthermore, in the summer of 1919, a prowler known as \"Pants,\" described by victims as a light-skinned Negro, had been burglarizing homes and attacking white women, though he had attracted little attention from Knoxville police.<ref name=lakin /><ref name=neely>Jack Neely, ''Knoxville's Secret History'' (Scruffy Books, 1995), pp. 106\u2013108.</ref>\n\n===Murder of Bertie Lindsey===\n\nAround 2:30 AM on August 30, 1919, an intruder broke into the home of Mrs. Bertie Lindsey on Eighth Street, where she had been staying with her cousin, Ora Smyth.  The intruder shot and killed Lindsey, but Smyth managed to escape to the home of a neighbor who summoned police.  Two patrolmen, Jim Smith and Andy White, arrived on the scene.<ref name=paine>Donald F. Paine, [https://archive.org/details/MAYS01 \"Race and Murder in Knoxville, 1919: The Trials of Maurice Mays,\"] ''Tennessee Bar Journal'' Vol. 43, No. 3 (March 2007), pp. 28-33.</ref> Smyth described the intruder as a light-skinned Negro.<ref name=lakin />\n\nPatrolman White suggested they question Maurice Mays, a prominent [[mulatto]] who operated the Stroller's Cafe on East Jackson. While raised by foster parents, Mays is believed to have been the illegitimate son of Knoxville's mayor, John E. McMillan, and had actually been canvassing for McMillan on the day of the murder.<ref name=lakin /><ref name=tehc>Bruce Wheeler, [http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=753 Knoxville Riot of 1919], ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture'', 2009. Retrieved: 31 March 2011.</ref> Mays had a reputation for associating with both black and white women, making him unpopular with many of the city's white residents. Patrolman Smith later testified that Officer White specifically singled out Mays because of a personal grudge.<ref name=lakin /><ref name=paine />\n\nAt around 3:30 AM, Knoxville police arrived at the Mays home on Humes Street. The only evidence they found was a .38 revolver, which the officers decided must have been fired recently (though Smith later testified the gun was cold and unlikely to have been fired recently).<ref name=lakin /><ref name=paine /> They arrested Mays and took him back to Eighth Street, where the distraught Ora Smyth identified him as the intruder.<ref name=lakin />\n\n==Riot==\n\n===Storming of the jail===\nSensing trouble, Knoxville police transferred Mays from the small city jail on [[Market Square, Knoxville|Market Square]] to the larger [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]] Jail on Hill Avenue. Knox County's [[sheriff]], W.T. Cate, then had Mays transferred to [[Chattanooga]].<ref name=lakin /> By noon, news of the murder had spread, and a crowd of curious onlookers had gathered at the county jail, thinking Mays was being held there.<ref name=lakin /> A larger, angrier crowd had gathered on Market Square. By late afternoon, the crowd at Market Square had grown to about 5,000.<ref name=lakin />\n\nAt 5:00 PM, the crowd at the jail became hostile, demanding Mays be brought out. Deputy sheriff Carroll Cate (the sheriff's nephew) and jailer Earl Hall assured them Mays was not there and allowed several members of the crowd to inspect the jail.<ref name=lakin />  Jim Claiborne, an intoxicated member of this crowd, walked to Market Square and told the crowd there that Mays was at the county jail, and that Cate and Hall were hiding him.<ref name=lakin /> Jim Dalton, a 72-year-old ironworker, called for Mays to be [[lynching|lynched]], and the 5,000-strong mob roared towards the jail.<ref name=lakin />\n\nUnable to convince the mob that Mays was not in their custody, Cate and Hall locked the jail's riot doors. At about 8:30, the rioters [[dynamite]]d their way into the jail, ransacking it floor by floor in search of Mays.<ref name=lakin /> They discovered and consumed a large portion of the jail's confiscated whiskey, and also stole as many firearms as they could find.<ref name=lakin /> They freed 16 white prisoners.<ref name=neely />\n\nTwo platoons of the [[Tennessee National Guard]]'s 4th Infantry, led by Adjutant General Edward Sweeney, arrived, but they were unable to halt the chaos.<ref name=lakin />\n\n===Gun battle at Central and Vine===\nAfter [[looting]] the jail and Sheriff Cate's house, the mob returned to Market Square, where they dispatched five truckloads of rioters to Chattanooga to find Mays.<ref name=lakin /> General Sweeney, awaiting the arrival of reinforcements, pleaded with the rioters to disperse. Meanwhile, many of the city's black residents, aware of the race riots that had occurred across the country that summer, had armed themselves, and had barricaded the intersection of Vine and Central to defend their businesses.<ref name=lakin />\n\nAs the trucks began to depart, shots rang out on Central, and it was falsely reported that two soldiers had been killed.<ref name=lakin /> Sweeney immediately ordered his guardsmen toward Vine, and the mob followed. Along the way, rioters broke into stores on [[Gay Street (Knoxville)|Gay Street]] to steal firearms and other weapons.<ref name=tehc /> As the guardsmen turned onto Vine, the street erupted in gunfire as black snipers exchanged fire with both the rioters and the soldiers.<ref name=lakin /> The National Guard set up two [[Browning machine gun]]s on Vine, and opened fire toward Central. One guardsman, 24-year-old Lieutenant James William Payne, was shot and wounded by a [[sniper]], and as he staggered into the street, he was cut to pieces by friendly fire from the machine guns.<ref name=lakin />\n\nShooting continued sporadically for several hours. The black defenders charged the machine guns several times but failed to capture them. Among those killed was a black shopkeeper and [[Spanish\u2013American War]] veteran named Joe Etter, who was shot when he attempted single-handedly to capture one of the machine guns.<ref name=lakin /> Outgunned, the black defenders gradually fled Central and dispersed, allowing the guardsmen to gain control of Vine and Central in the early morning hours of August 31.<ref name=lakin />\n\n===The riot's end===\nThe National Guard immediately barricaded Central, and aggressively searched all-black residences inside the barricaded zone. A citywide curfew was imposed, and 200 white citizens were temporarily deputized.<ref name=lakin /> Scattered reports of violence persisted throughout the day. Two African American residents, Carter Watkins and Claude Chambers, were shot and killed at a train depot as they tried to flee.<ref name=lakin /> A deaf black woman was shot when she failed to heed a guardsman's orders to halt.<ref name=lakin />\n\nKnoxville's newspapers placed the death toll at just two (Etter and Payne), though eyewitness accounts say it was much higher.<ref name=lakin /> Deputy Carroll Cate estimated that between 25 and 30 had been killed, while National Guard Major Maurice Martin placed it between 30 and 40. Others placed the death toll in the hundreds.<ref name=lakin /><ref name=neely /> By some accounts, the dead were so many that the bodies were dumped into the [[Tennessee River]], while others were buried in mass graves outside the city.<ref name=lakin />\n\n==Aftermath==\n===The rioters and race relations===\n\nIn the weeks following the riot, many of the city's African-American leaders argued that the rioters did not represent the typical attitude of Knoxville's white citizens,<ref name=lakin /> though hundreds of black residents nevertheless left the city for good. Another riot nearly occurred in 1921,<ref>\"Ask Doc Knox,\" [https://web.archive.org/web/20120207081658/http://blogs.metropulse.com/ask_dr_knox/2010/02/knoxvilles-odd-race-riots.html Knoxville's Odd Race Riots], ''Metro Pulse'', 9 February 2010.  Accessed at the Internet Archive, 2 October 2015.</ref> and flare-ups would take place sporadically for years afterward.<ref name=lakin />\n\nKnoxville's leaders refused to believe the Riot of 1919 was the result of racial tensions. The ''Knoxville Journal'' denied a race riot had occurred, insisting the entire incident was nothing more than the city's \"rabble\" running amok.<ref name=lakin /> Congressman [[John Chiles Houk]] argued that the lynch mob would have gone after a white murderer just as eagerly as they had gone after Mays.<ref name=lakin /> Fifty-five white rioters were charged with various minor offences in October 1919, but all were acquitted.<ref name=lakin />\n\n===The Mays case===\n\nAccused killer Maurice Mays was treated more severely. Shortly after his arrest, Mays released a statement denying involvement, declaring that the case against him was one of \"oppression and injustice\":\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Had the officers been honest in their duties, they would have arrested several suspects filling the description and kept the arrest secret, then they would have allowed the lady to come in a composed condition and pick out the guilty party. As it is, it looks like bad management based on oppression and prejudice. I believe the court will believe me...\"<ref>Associated Press, [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3441360/negro_denies_murder_criticizes_police/ Negro Denies Murder; Criticizes Police Work,\"] ''The Tennessean'' [Nashville], Sept. 1, 1919, pg. 2.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn October 1919, Mays's trial began.

The riot began when a [[Lynching|lynch mob]] stormed the county jail in search of Maurice Mays, a biracial man who had been accused of murdering a white woman. Unable to find Mays, the rioters looted the jail and fought a pitched gun battle with the residents of a predominantly black neighborhood. The [[Tennessee National Guard]], which at one point fired two machine guns indiscriminately into this neighborhood, eventually dispersed the rioters. <ref name=lakin> {{harvnb|Lakin|2000|pp=1\u201329}}</ref> <ref name= \"Booker p. \">{{harvnb|Booker|2001|p=}}</ref> <ref name= \"Williams p. \">{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=}}</ref> At the end of August 1919 the ''Great Falls Daily Tribune'' reported four killed in a \"race war riot\"<ref name= \"Great Falls Daily Tribune p. 1\">{{harvnb|Great Falls Daily Tribune|1919|p=1}}</ref> while the ''Washington Times'' reported \"Scores dead.\"<ref name= \"Washington Times p. 1\">{{harvnb|Washington Times|1919|p=1}}</ref> Other newspapers placed the death toll at just two, though eyewitness accounts suggest it was much higher.<ref name=lakin />\n\nThe Riot of 1919 was one of several violent racial incidents that occurred during the so-called [[Red Summer (1919)|Red Summer]] when race riots plagued cities across the United States.  The riot was one of the worst racial episodes in Knoxville's history and shattered the city's vision of itself as a racially tolerant Southern town.<ref>Mark Banker, ''Appalachians All: East Tennesseans and the Elusive History of an American Region'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2010), pp. 105\u2013106.</ref> After the riot, many black residents left Knoxville, and racial violence continued to flare up sporadically in subsequent years.<ref name=lakin />\n\n==Background==\n\n===Post-World War I racial tensions===\nIn the decades following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Knoxville was considered by both black and white residents to be one of the few racially tolerant cities in the [[Southern United States|South]]. It was one of the few where black citizens could vote, hold public office, and serve as police officers.<ref name=lakin /> In 1918, [[Charles W. Cansler]] (1871\u20131953), one of the city's leading African-American citizens, wrote to the governor of Tennessee, \"In no place in the world can there be found better relations existing between the races than here in our own county of Knox. No race riots have ever disgraced our city and no mob has ever vented its fury here upon any Negro victim.\"<ref name=lakin />\n\nDuring the [[recession]] that followed [[World War I]], however, migrants poured into Knoxville, overcrowding the city's slums. This increased competition for an already diminished number of jobs, and heightened tensions between black residents and [[working class]] whites. Both the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)]] set up chapters in Knoxville in 1918.<ref name=lakin /> Furthermore, in the summer of 1919, a prowler known as \"Pants,\" described by victims as a light-skinned Negro, had been burglarizing homes and attacking white women, though he had attracted little attention from Knoxville police.<ref name=lakin /><ref name=neely>Jack Neely, ''Knoxville's Secret History'' (Scruffy Books, 1995), pp. 106\u2013108.</ref>\n\n===Murder of Bertie Lindsey===\n\nAround 2:30 AM on August 30, 1919, an intruder broke into the home of Mrs. Bertie Lindsey on Eighth Street, where she had been staying with her cousin, Ora Smyth.  The intruder shot and killed Lindsey, but Smyth managed to escape to the home of a neighbor who summoned police.  Two patrolmen, Jim Smith and Andy White, arrived on the scene.<ref name=paine>Donald F.

While raised by foster parents, Mays is believed to have been the illegitimate son of Knoxville's mayor, John E. McMillan, and had actually been canvassing for McMillan on the day of the murder.<ref name=lakin /><ref name=tehc>Bruce Wheeler, [http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=753 Knoxville Riot of 1919], ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture'', 2009. Retrieved: 31 March 2011.</ref> Mays had a reputation for associating with both black and white women, making him unpopular with many of the city's white residents. Patrolman Smith later testified that Officer White specifically singled out Mays because of a personal grudge.<ref name=lakin /><ref name=paine />\n\nAt around 3:30 AM, Knoxville police arrived at the Mays home on Humes Street. The only evidence they found was a .38 revolver, which the officers decided must have been fired recently (though Smith later testified the gun was cold and unlikely to have been fired recently).<ref name=lakin /><ref name=paine /> They arrested Mays and took him back to Eighth Street, where the distraught Ora Smyth identified him as the intruder.<ref name=lakin />\n\n==Riot==\n\n===Storming of the jail===\nSensing trouble, Knoxville police transferred Mays from the small city jail on [[Market Square, Knoxville|Market Square]] to the larger [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]] Jail on Hill Avenue. Knox County's [[sheriff]], W.T. Cate, then had Mays transferred to [[Chattanooga]].<ref name=lakin /> By noon, news of the murder had spread, and a crowd of curious onlookers had gathered at the county jail, thinking Mays was being held there.<ref name=lakin /> A larger, angrier crowd had gathered on Market Square. By late afternoon, the crowd at Market Square had grown to about 5,000.<ref name=lakin />\n\nAt 5:00 PM, the crowd at the jail became hostile, demanding Mays be brought out. Deputy sheriff Carroll Cate (the sheriff's nephew) and jailer Earl Hall assured them Mays was not there and allowed several members of the crowd to inspect the jail.<ref name=lakin />  Jim Claiborne, an intoxicated member of this crowd, walked to Market Square and told the crowd there that Mays was at the county jail, and that Cate and Hall were hiding him.<ref name=lakin /> Jim Dalton, a 72-year-old ironworker, called for Mays to be [[lynching|lynched]], and the 5,000-strong mob roared towards the jail.<ref name=lakin />\n\nUnable to convince the mob that Mays was not in their custody, Cate and Hall locked the jail's riot doors. At about 8:30, the rioters [[dynamite]]d their way into the jail, ransacking it floor by floor in search of Mays.<ref name=lakin /> They discovered and consumed a large portion of the jail's confiscated whiskey, and also stole as many firearms as they could find.<ref name=lakin /> They freed 16 white prisoners.<ref name=neely />\n\nTwo platoons of the [[Tennessee National Guard]]'s 4th Infantry, led by Adjutant General Edward Sweeney, arrived, but they were unable to halt the chaos.<ref name=lakin />\n\n===Gun battle at Central and Vine===\nAfter [[looting]] the jail and Sheriff Cate's house, the mob returned to Market Square, where they dispatched five truckloads of rioters to Chattanooga to find Mays.<ref name=lakin /> General Sweeney, awaiting the arrival of reinforcements, pleaded with the rioters to disperse. Meanwhile, many of the city's black residents, aware of the race riots that had occurred across the country that summer, had armed themselves, and had barricaded the intersection of Vine and Central to defend their businesses.<ref name=lakin />\n\nAs the trucks began to depart, shots rang out on Central, and it was falsely reported that two soldiers had been killed.<ref name=lakin /> Sweeney immediately ordered his guardsmen toward Vine, and the mob followed. Along the way, rioters broke into stores on [[Gay Street (Knoxville)|Gay Street]] to steal firearms and other weapons.<ref name=tehc /> As the guardsmen turned onto Vine, the street erupted in gunfire as black snipers exchanged fire with both the rioters and the soldiers.<ref name=lakin /> The National Guard set up two [[Browning machine gun]]s on Vine, and opened fire toward Central. One guardsman, 24-year-old Lieutenant James William Payne, was shot and wounded by a [[sniper]], and as he staggered into the street, he was cut to pieces by friendly fire from the machine guns.<ref name=lakin />\n\nShooting continued sporadically for several hours. The black defenders charged the machine guns several times but failed to capture them. Among those killed was a black shopkeeper and [[Spanish\u2013American War]] veteran named Joe Etter, who was shot when he attempted single-handedly to capture one of the machine guns.<ref name=lakin /> Outgunned, the black defenders gradually fled Central and dispersed, allowing the guardsmen to gain control of Vine and Central in the early morning hours of August 31.<ref name=lakin />\n\n===The riot's end===\nThe National Guard immediately barricaded Central, and aggressively searched all-black residences inside the barricaded zone. A citywide curfew was imposed, and 200 white citizens were temporarily deputized.<ref name=lakin /> Scattered reports of violence persisted throughout the day. Two African American residents, Carter Watkins and Claude Chambers, were shot and killed at a train depot as they tried to flee.<ref name=lakin /> A deaf black woman was shot when she failed to heed a guardsman's orders to halt.<ref name=lakin />\n\nKnoxville's newspapers placed the death toll at just two (Etter and Payne), though eyewitness accounts say it was much higher.<ref name=lakin /> Deputy Carroll Cate estimated that between 25 and 30 had been killed, while National Guard Major Maurice Martin placed it between 30 and 40. Others placed the death toll in the hundreds.<ref name=lakin /><ref name=neely /> By some accounts, the dead were so many that the bodies were dumped into the [[Tennessee River]], while others were buried in mass graves outside the city.<ref name=lakin />\n\n==Aftermath==\n===The rioters and race relations===\n\nIn the weeks following the riot, many of the city's African-American leaders argued that the rioters did not represent the typical attitude of Knoxville's white citizens,<ref name=lakin /> though hundreds of black residents nevertheless left the city for good. Another riot nearly occurred in 1921,<ref>\"Ask Doc Knox,\" [https://web.archive.org/web/20120207081658/http://blogs.metropulse.com/ask_dr_knox/2010/02/knoxvilles-odd-race-riots.html Knoxville's Odd Race Riots], ''Metro Pulse'', 9 February 2010.

The ''Knoxville Journal'' denied a race riot had occurred, insisting the entire incident was nothing more than the city's \"rabble\" running amok.<ref name=lakin /> Congressman [[John Chiles Houk]] argued that the lynch mob would have gone after a white murderer just as eagerly as they had gone after Mays.<ref name=lakin /> Fifty-five white rioters were charged with various minor offences in October 1919, but all were acquitted.<ref name=lakin />\n\n===The Mays case===\n\nAccused killer Maurice Mays was treated more severely. Shortly after his arrest, Mays released a statement denying involvement, declaring that the case against him was one of \"oppression and injustice\":\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Had the officers been honest in their duties, they would have arrested several suspects filling the description and kept the arrest secret, then they would have allowed the lady to come in a composed condition and pick out the guilty party. As it is, it looks like bad management based on oppression and prejudice.

The members of the group met as mostly [[freshmen]] at Tuskegee Institute (now [[Tuskegee University]]) in 1968, and signed with [[Motown]] in November 1972, having first caught the public eye opening for [[the Jackson 5]] while on [[concert tour|tour]].\n\nThe group's most successful period was in the late 1970s and early 1980s when [[Lionel Richie]] was the co-lead singer. The band's biggest [[hit record|hit singles]] are [[Sentimental ballad|ballads]] such as \"[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]\", \"[[Three Times a Lady]]\", and \"[[Nightshift (song)|Nightshift]]\"; and [[funk]]y dance hits which include \"[[Brick House (song)|Brick House]]\", \"Fancy Dancer\", \"[[Lady (You Bring Me Up)]]\", and \"[[Too Hot ta Trot]]\". \n\nThe band has won one [[Grammy Award]] out of nine nominations.

After winning the university's annual freshman talent contest, they played at fraternity parties as well as a weekend gig at the Black Forest Inn, one of a few clubs in Tuskegee that catered to college students. They performed cover tunes and some original songs with their first singer, James Ingram (not the [[James Ingram|famous solo artist]]). Ingram, older than the rest of the band, left to serve in [[Vietnam]], and was later replaced by Walter \"Clyde\" Orange, who wrote or co-wrote many of their hits. [[Lionel Richie]] and Orange alternated as lead singers.

Initially the band thought it was a hoax. However, back in their dressing rooms they received confirmation and broke down in tears. The next night at [[Birmingham]]'s [[Barclaycard Arena|NIA Arena]], J.D. Nicholas added Jackson's name to the lyrics of the song, and henceforth The Commodores have mentioned Jackson and other deceased R&B singers.  Thus came the inspiration upon the one-year anniversary of Jackson's death to re-record, with new lyrics, the hit song \"Nightshift\" as a tribute.\n\nIn 1990 the Commodores formed Commodores Records and re-recorded their 20 greatest hits as ''Commodores Hits Vol. I & II''. They have [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] a live album, ''[[Commodores Live]]'', along with a DVD of the same name, and a Christmas album titled ''Commodores Christmas''. In 2012, the band was working on new material, with some contributions written by current and former members.\n\nThe Commodores, as of 2020, consist of Walter \"Clyde\" Orange, James Dean \"J.D.\" Nicholas, and William \"WAK\" King, along with their five-piece band The Mean Machine.

That lineup was hitless until 1985 when their final [[Motown]] album ''Nightshift'', produced by Dennis Lambert (prior albums were produced by James Anthony Carmichael), delivered the title track \"[[Nightshift (song)|Nightshift]],\" a loving tribute to [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Jackie Wilson]], both of whom had died the previous year. \"Nightshift\" hit no. 3 in the US and won The Commodores their first [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals]] in 1985.\n\nIn 2010 a new version was recorded, dedicated to [[Michael Jackson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mjfanclub.net/home/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3859:commodores-re-record-qnightshiftq-as-mj-tribute&catid=85:latest-news&Itemid=82 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723211525/http://mjfanclub.net/home/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3859:commodores-re-record-qnightshiftq-as-mj-tribute&catid=85:latest-news&Itemid=82 |archivedate=July 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }} </ref> The Commodores were on a European tour performing at [[Wembley Arena]], [[London]], on June 25, 2009, when they walked off the stage after they were told that Michael Jackson had died. Initially the band thought it was a hoax. However, back in their dressing rooms they received confirmation and broke down in tears. The next night at [[Birmingham]]'s [[Barclaycard Arena|NIA Arena]], J.D. Nicholas added Jackson's name to the lyrics of the song, and henceforth The Commodores have mentioned Jackson and other deceased R&B singers.  Thus came the inspiration upon the one-year anniversary of Jackson's death to re-record, with new lyrics, the hit song \"Nightshift\" as a tribute.\n\nIn 1990 the Commodores formed Commodores Records and re-recorded their 20 greatest hits as ''Commodores Hits Vol. I & II''. They have [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] a live album, ''[[Commodores Live]]'', along with a DVD of the same name, and a Christmas album titled ''Commodores Christmas''. In 2012, the band was working on new material, with some contributions written by current and former members.\n\nThe Commodores, as of 2020, consist of Walter \"Clyde\" Orange, James Dean \"J.D.\" Nicholas, and William \"WAK\" King, along with their five-piece band The Mean Machine.  They continue to perform, playing at arenas, theaters, and festivals around the world.\n\n==Personnel==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}\n;Current members\n* [[William King (singer)|William \"WAK\" King]] \u2013 trumpet, rhythm guitar, keyboards, vocals (1968\u2013present)\n* Walter Orange \u2013 drums, vocals (1972\u2013present)\n* James Dean \"J.D.\" Nicholas \u2013 vocals, keyboards (1984\u2013present)\n\n;Former members\n* [[Lionel Richie]] \u2013 vocals, keyboards, saxophone (1968\u201382)\n* [[Milan Williams]] \u2013 keyboards, rhythm guitar (1968\u201389)\n* [[Thomas McClary (musician)|Thomas McClary]] \u2013 lead guitar (1968\u201383)\n* Andre Callahan \u2013 vocals, drums, keyboards (1968\u201370)\n* Michael Gilbert \u2013 bass guitar, trumpet (1968\u201370) \n* Eugene Ward \u2013 keyboards (1968\u201370)\n* Ronald LaPread \u2013 bass guitar (1970\u201386)\n* James Ingram \u2013 vocals, drums (1970\u201372)\n* Skyler Jett \u2013 vocals, keyboards (1982\u201384)\n* [[Sheldon Reynolds (guitarist)|Sheldon Reynolds]] \u2013 lead guitar (1983\u201387)\n* David Battelene - lead guitar (1987-1989)\n* Mikael Manley \u2013 lead guitar (1995\u20132005)\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize  = width:800 height:auto barincrement:21\nPlotArea   = left:120 bottom:100 top:10 right:10\nAlignbars  = justify\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/1968 till:{{#time:d/m/Y}}\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend     = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:1\nScaleMajor = increment:5 start:1970\n\nColors =  \n id:vocals   value:red       legend:Vocals\n id:trump    value:gray(0.5) legend:Trumpet\n id:sax      value:gray(0.75) legend:Saxophone\n id:guitar   value:green     legend:Guitar\n id:keys     value:purple    legend:Keyboards\n id:bass     value:blue      legend:Bass\n id:drums    value:orange    legend:Drums\n id:studio   value:black     legend:Studio_album\n\nLineData =\n layer:back color:studio\n at:22/07/1974\n at:15/02/1975\n at:15/10/1975\n at:15/06/1976\n at:30/03/1977\n at:15/05/1978\n at:15/07/1979\n at:15/06/1980\n at:22/06/1981\n at:15/09/1983\n at:15/01/1985\n at:15/10/1986\n at:15/07/1988\n at:15/11/1992\n at:29/03/1993\n\nBarData =\n bar:WK text:\"William King\"\n bar:LR text:\"Lionel Richie\"\n bar:SJ text:\"Skyler Jett\"\n bar:JN text:\"J.D.

Originally scheduled for 1 August of the previous year, the ceremony had been postponed because of parliamentary proceedings of George's estranged wife, Queen [[Caroline of Brunswick]]; because these failed to deprive her of her titles and obtain a divorce from the king, she was excluded from the ceremony. In accordance with George's lavish personal tastes, the coronation was the most extravagant ever staged and a number of the traditional elements of the ceremonial were conducted for the last time. \n\n==Background==\nGeorge had acceded to the throne on 29 January 1820, on the death of his father, King [[George III]], at [[Windsor Castle]]. The late king had been debilitated by illness for most of the previous decade and George had been appointed [[Prince Regent]] in his father's place in 1811.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.royal.uk/george-iii |title=George III (r. 1760-1820) |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=www.royal.uk |publisher=The Royal Household |access-date=9 April 2020 }}</ref> From the start of the [[Regency era|Regency]], Prince George, already notorious for his numerous mistresses and being an extravagant follower of fashion, declared that he would \"quite eclipse [[Napoleon]]\". Following Britain's victory in the Napoleonic Wars, George purported that he had played a leading role in the downfall of the French emperor.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/george_fourth_01.shtml |title=George IV: The Royal Joke? |last=Parissien |first=Steven |date=17 February 2011 |website=www.bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC |access-date=9 April 2020 }}</ref> Therefore, the intention was that George would outshine the sumptuous [[coronation of Napoleon I|coronation of Napoleon]] and a tailor was dispatched to Paris to study the emperor's coronation robe.<ref>Strong 2005, p. 394</ref>\n\nThe ceremony was originally planned for 1 August 1820; however, on 5 June, George's estranged wife, [[Caroline of Brunswick]], unexpectedly returned to England from the continent to claim her right to be crowned as [[queen consort]]. Despite long-standing rumours of Caroline's immoral lifestyle, she garnered considerable public sympathy, probably due to the unpopularity of King George. She also gained the backing of [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] politicians, who formed the [[Loyal opposition|opposition]] to the [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] government, led by [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]]. At the urging of George, the government introduced a [[bill of pains and penalties]] into the [[House of Lords]], \"to deprive Her Majesty Caroline Amelia Elizabeth of the title, prerogatives, rights, Privileges, and Exemptions of Queen Consort of this Realm, and to [[Dissolution (law)|dissolve]] the Marriage between his Majesty and the said Caroline Amelia Elizabeth\" based on Caroline's alleged adultery.<ref name =\"Jenkins\">{{cite web |url=https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/periods/hanoverians/queen-caroline-affair-1820 |title=Hanoverians - The Queen Caroline Affair, 1820 |last=Jenkins |first=Terry |date= |website=www.historyofparliamentonline.org |publisher=The History of Parliament Trust |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> These proceedings, which took on something of the nature of a trial, would obviously take some time and so there was a postponement of the coronation until 19 July 1821.<ref>Range 2012, p. 181</ref> In the event, there was insufficient support for the bill which was abandoned in November,<ref name =\"Jenkins\"/> so Caroline was simply written-out of the coronation ceremony.<ref>Strong 2005, p. 378</ref>\n\n==Preparations==\nTo fund the coronation, the king was able to secure \u00a3100,000 from government funds and the rest came from the huge [[war reparations]] of 100 million [[French franc]]s which had been forced on France by the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris in 1815]]. Preparation and furnishing Westminster Abbey and Westminster Hall cost \u00a316,819, \u00a3111,810 was spent on jewels and plate, \u00a344,939 on uniforms, robes and costumes, and \u00a325,184 on the banquet. The total cost of the coronation was \u00a3238,000, the most expensive ever and more than twenty times the cost of the previous event in 1761.<ref>Strong 2005, pp. 372-374</ref>\n\nThe organisation of the ceremonial was the responsibility of two of the [[Great Officer of State|Great Officers of State]]; the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]], or in 1821, the Deputy, [[Peter Drummond-Burrell, 22nd Baron Willoughby de Eresby|Lord Gwydyr]], was responsible for events in Westminster Hall, while the [[Earl Marshal]] was in charge of the non-ecclesiastical proceedings in the abbey. However, since the holder of that hereditary post, the [[Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] was a [[Catholic]] and therefore excluded, he was obliged to appoint a Deputy, his [[Anglican]] brother, [[Lord Henry Howard-Molyneux-Howard]], to fulfil his role.<ref>Strong 2005, pp. 376-377</ref>\n\nScaffolding was erected in the abbey to seat 4,656 guests, more than three times the number at the previous coronation.<ref>Strong 2005, p. 384</ref> Because of the limited space in the [[Palace of Westminster#Old Palace|old Palace of Westminster]], the interior of Westminster Hall had been subdivided by wooden partitions to serve as courtrooms and these all had to be demolished to create the large space required for the coronation banquet,<ref>Strong 2005, p. 366</ref> which required galleries for 2,934 spectators<ref>Strong 2005, p. 387</ref> and 1,268 diners seated at 47 tables, some of which had to be sited in other parts of the palace.<ref>Strong 2005, p. 411</ref> A temporary [[triumphal arch]] was erected at the north end of the hall in the style of a medieval castle.<ref>Strong 2005, p. 366</ref>\n[[File:George IV coronation.jpg|thumb|right|George IV with the train of his immense robe being carried by eight sons of peers and the Master of the Robes.]]\nIn accordance with the vogue for [[Romanticism]] and with his own taste for flamboyant clothes, George insisted that the participants should dress in [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and [[Stuart period]] costumes. [[Hereditary peer|Peer]]s were expected to provide their own clothing and a display of the required styles was staged at the [[College of Arms]] in June 1820 for the benefit of their lordships' tailors. The resulting outfits on the day, according to one report, \"produced much amusement among the ladies\"; but Sir [[Walter Scott]] enthused over the \"gay and gorgeous and antique dress which floated before the eye\".<ref>Strong 2005, p. 392</ref> George's personal coronation outfit cost more than \u00a324,000; his {{convert|27|feet}} red [[velvet]] robe was afterwards sold to [[Madam Tussaud]] for display in her [[wax museum]], but was eventually rediscovered and has been used at every coronation since [[Coronation of George V and Mary|that of George V]] in 1911.<ref name =\"brightonmuseums\">{{cite web |url=https://brightonmuseums.org.uk/discover/2015/02/26/george-ivs-coronation/ |title=George IV\u2019s Coronation |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=26 February 2015 |website=brightonmuseums.org.uk |publisher= Brighton Museum & Art Gallery |access-date=11 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough many of the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]] had been inherited from George's ancestors, he spared no expense in enhancing their magnificence. [[St Edward's Crown]], dating from 1661, was actually only a frame, and most of the jewels had to be hired to be set in it; this cost \u00a3375,000 in 1821. The new [[Coronation Crown of George IV]] was commissioned at an estimated cost of over \u00a350,000. A crown-like hatband for George's plumed hat cost \u00a38,000, while crowns for the [[Royal dukedoms in the United Kingdom|royal dukes]] cost \u00a34,000 and for the princesses, \u00a32,000 each. In contrast, crowns for the extended royal family were produced for \u00a340 each at the next coronation.<ref>Strong 2005, pp. 382-383</ref>\n\n==Exclusion of Caroline==\n[[File:Queen-caroline-repulsed-from-westminster-abbey.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's impression of Queen Caroline and Lord Hood being refused entry to the abbey by a doorman.]]\nOn 16 July, the queen's [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]], [[Henry Hood, 2nd Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]], had written to inform the Duke of Norfolk that the queen would be attending the forthcoming coronation and requesting that she would be conducted to her seat. He received a prompt reply from Lord Howard, the Deputy Earl Marshal stating \"that it was not his majesty's pleasure to comply with the application\".<ref>Huish \"Caroline\" 1821, pp. 683-684</ref> Despite this and the urging of her legal advisors, Queen Caroline was determined to attend the coronation. At 6 am, her carriage arrived at Westminster Hall and was received with applause from a sympathetic section of the crowd and \"anxious agitation\" by the soldiers and officials supervising the door, which after some confusion was closed. The queen approached on the arm of Lord Hood, but was asked for her ticket by the commander of the guard. Replying that she was the queen and didn't need a ticket, she was firmly turned away. When Caroline and Lord Hood tried to enter by a side door, it was slammed in their faces. Their attempt to find another entrance was blocked by a line of armed soldiers, so they then made for the House of Lords, which was connected to the hall, but when she was denied entry there too, the queen returned to her carriage. After about 20 minutes the party arrived at the abbey,<ref>Huish \"Caroline\" 1821, pp. 687-690</ref> and approached the door which leads into [[Poet's Corner]]. Lord Hood addressed the doorkeeper, who was probably one of the [[boxing|professional boxer]]s who had been hired for the event, announcing; \"I present to you your queen, do you refuse her admission?\" The doorkeeper replied that he could admit no one without a ticket. Lord Hood had his own ticket, but the doorkeeper was insistent that this would only allow one person entry and the queen refused to enter alone. After further fruitless argument, the queen's party retreated, the crowds shouting \"Shame! Shame!\" as she left in her carriage. Queen Caroline died two weeks later.<ref>Strong 2005, p. 353</ref>\n\n==Procession==\nThe king arrived at Westminster by carriage at 8:30 pm on the previous evening and spent the night in the house of the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. The carriages of the various participants started to arrive at 1 am and by 6 am the nearby streets had been brought to a standstill, so that many peers had to abandon their coaches and walk to the abbey through the crowds. At 10 am,<ref>The Gentleman's Magazine 1821, pp. 3-4</ref> following tradition, the ceremony started in Westminster Hall. The king, seated on a throne, was presented with the items of regalia by the clergy, which he then bestowed on various aristocrats who often had the hereditary right to carry them to the abbey. The procession on foot to the abbey was the only part of the proceedings which could be seen by the general public and large stands for spectators had been erected along the route, which passed out of the north door of the hall, across [[New Palace Yard]], into Parliament Street, Bridge Street and King Street to the west door of the abbey. It was a raised and carpeted walkway {{convert|15|feet}} wide and {{convert|3|feet}} high with a handrail and was lined by soldiers. There were some 700 people in the procession, headed by the King's Herb Woman and six maids, scattering petals on the carpet.<ref>Strong 2005, pp. 394-400</ref> Included in this number was a military band and the choir who repeatedly sang the [[anthem]] ''O Lord, grant the King a long life'' by [[William Child]], interspersed with drumming and trumpet fanfares.<ref>Range 2012, p. 182</ref>\n\n==Service==\n[[File:Coronation of George IV.jpg|thumb|right|The moment of King George's crowning at Westminster Abbey.]]\nThe content of the coronation service was the responsibility of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Charles Manners-Sutton]], who had only made minor modifications to the text used at the previous coronation, especially excluding any reference to the queen. As at the previous event, printed cards showing the order of service were issued to the participants; this was particularly helpful when the manuscript text of the coronation oath was mislaid and George simply signed the card instead.<ref>Range 2012, p. 181</ref> The wording of the oath itself had been amended from \"the people of this [[kingdom of Great Britain]]\" to \"this United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\" to reflect the [[Acts of Union 1800]].<ref>Strong 2005, p. 359</ref> The [[sermon]] was preached by the [[Archbishop of York]], [[Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt]], on a text taken from the [[Book of Samuel]]; \"he that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God\".<ref>Huish \"Coronation\" 1821, p. 221</ref>\n\nIt was a warm day and the king, encumbered by the weight of his lavish costume, was seen to be perspiring heavily throughout the service and later remarked; \"I would not endure again the sufferings of that day for another kingdom!\"<ref>Gosling 2013, p. 54</ref> At the end of the ceremony, the [[recessional hymn|recessional]] was marred by the premature departure of the choir, so that the king had to empty pass benches covered in litter, described in the press as \"a most unpicturesque arrangement\".<ref>Range 2012, p. 181</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe music used in the coronation service seems to have been influenced by George's wishes; some of it was changed by the king when he attended the final rehearsal only three days before the event. By tradition, the monarch's entry into the abbey is greeted by the anthem ''[[I was glad]]''; however, this was deferred until the king had reached the [[Choir (architecture)|quire]] and was sung to a new [[musical setting|setting]] by [[Thomas Attwood (composer)|Thomas Attwood]]. Instead, at the initial entry of the king, the ''[[Hallelujah Chorus]]'' from the [[oratorio]] ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' by [[George Frideric Handel]] was sung. At that point, the [[Queen's Scholar (Westminster School)|King's Scholar]]s of [[Westminster School]] shouted the traditional acclamation, \"[[Vivat]] Georgius Rex!\". This was followed by music from another Handel oratorio, ''[[Saul (Handel)|Saul]]'', in which the [[libretto]] of the [[aria]] ''Already see the daughters of the land advance'' was amended, apparently at George's suggestion, to say ''Already see the monarch of the Lord advance''; the piece finished with the chorus ''Welcome, welcome, mighty king!''<ref>Range 2012, pp. 183-184</ref> Other choral music included another anthem by Attwood, ''Let thy hand be strengthened'', ''[[Zadok the Priest]]'' by Handel (uniquely, in an [[arrangement]] by [[Johann Baptist Cramer]]), ''The King shall rejoice'' by [[William Knyvett]] and a setting of the ''[[Te Deum]]'' by [[William Boyce (composer)|William Boyce]].<ref>Range 2012, pp. 282-283</ref> ''[[God Save the King]]'' seems to have been performed at least twice during the service; once by trumpets at the king's entrance and once shortly before the end by the choir with \"all the nobles of the land, male and female\".<ref>Range 2012, p. 193</ref>\n\nThe choirs and orchestra were placed in a large temporary gallery which spanned the east end of the abbey over St Edward's Chapel. One newspaper report stated that there were \"a hundred instruments and twice a hundred voices\". The only choirs officially mentioned are those of the abbey and the [[Chapel Royal]] but it is likely that the choir of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] was also present and that professional singers were hired-in. Large choirs of this size were fashionable at that time, especially for popular concerts of Handel's works. The conductor was [[William Shield]] and the organist was [[Charles Knyvett]] of the Chapel Royal.<ref>Range 2012, p. 197</ref>\n\n==Banquet==\n[[File:The Third and Last Challenge by the Champion during King George IV's Coronation Banquet in Westminster Hall.jpg|thumb|right|The King's Champion makes the third and last challenge before the royal table at the banquet.]]\nThe coronation feast or banquet was first recorded at the coronation of [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] in 1194,<ref>Strong 2005, p. 62</ref> but that of 1821 was to be the last. The king returned to the hall in procession at about 3:30 pm.<ref>The Gentleman's Magazine 1821, p. 13</ref> The spectacle was somewhat marred by the [[Barons of the Cinque Ports]], who exercised their traditional right to carry a canopy over the king, supported on four staves. The king, perhaps wanting to be seen by the crowds looking down from windows and roof tops, decided to walk in front of the canopy; however, this caused the elderly barons to try to walk faster, but the swaying of the canopy alarmed the king who quickened his pace in turn, eventually resulting in \"a somewhat unseemly jog trot\" according to a press report.<ref name =\"brightonmuseums\"/> The king retired to a [[withdrawing room]] to rest until 6 pm when the feast commenced.<ref>The Gentleman's Magazine 1821, pp. 13-14</ref> The hall was lit by 2,000 candles in 26 vast chandeliers, but due to the heat of the day, the peers and peeresses below were continually being hit by large globules of melted wax.<ref>Strong 2005, pp. 388-390</ref>\n\nThe 23 temporary kitchens which had been built adjacent to the hall produced 160 [[tureen]]s of soup and a similar number of hot fish and roast dishes, along with 3,271 cold dishes. The Deputy Earl Marshal, together with the [[Lord High Steward]] and [[Lord High Constable of England|Lord High Constable]], supervised the proceedings on horseback, riding along the centre of the hall. An unfortunate incident occurred when the Lord High Steward, [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey]], was required to dismount and uncover the first dish on the royal table; he had lost his leg at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and because he was wearing a [[prosthetic leg]] designed for riding, was unable to dismount without considerable difficulty and the assistance of several pages, which caused much amusement amongst the unsympathetic guests.<ref>Strong 2005, p. 413</ref>\n\nThe highlight of the banquet was the arrival of the [[King's Champion]], which had been a hereditary title held by the [[Dymoke]] family since the 14th century. Unfortunately, the holder of the post, the Reverend John Dymoke, was a clergyman and so the honour passed to his son, [[Henry Dymoke]] who was only 20 years old and did not possess a suitable horse, so one had to be hired from Astley's Circus. Amid much ceremony, the champion in a full [[suit of armour]] rode in through the archway, flanked by the Lord High Steward and the Lord High Constable and riding the length of the hall,<ref>Strong 2005, p. 413</ref> [[Gauntlet (glove)#\"Throw down the gauntlet\"|throwing down his gauntlet]] three times in the traditional challenge, the last time that this was enacted.<ref>Strong 2005, p. 104</ref> During the toasts, the choir sang ''God Save the King'' again, joined enthusiastically by the diners and spectators who had risen to their feet. The choir then sang ''[[Non nobis Domine]]'', perhaps because it appears in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' after the [[Battle of Agincourt]] as an echo of George's perceived victory over Napoleon.<ref>Range 2012, p. 194</ref>\n\nThe king finally rose from his table at 8:20 pm and left for [[Carlton House]] by carriage.<ref>The Gentleman's Magazine 1821, p. 16</ref> The spectators from the galleries were allowed down to the hall floor and proceeded to clear the tables, not only of leftover food, but they helped themselves to the cutlery, glasses, silver platters and table ornaments as well. Lord Gwydyr managed to prevent the priceless gold coronation plates from being carried off and armed soldiers arrived in time to prevent the kitchens being ransacked. The hall was not cleared until 3 am the next morning, when some who had fallen asleep on the floor had to be carried to their coaches.<ref>Strong 2005, p. 414</ref>\n\n==Public celebrations==\nAs in previous coronations, there were some attempts to involve the wider public in the event. In London, a mob supporting Queen Caroline had rampaged through the [[West End of London|West End]] breaking windows and had to be dispersed by the [[Household Cavalry]].<ref>Huish \"Coronation\" 1821, pp. 283-284</ref> Elsewhere a better natured crowd watched the ascent of a [[gas balloon]] from [[Green Park]] piloted by [[Charles Green (balloonist)|Charles Green]], and then proceeded to [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] where there was a boat race and in the evening, the trees and [[The Serpentine]] were illuminated with lanterns<ref>Huish \"Coronation\" 1821, pp. 279-280</ref> and a [[firework]] display was organised by [[Sir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet|Sir William Congreve]],<ref>Huish \"Coronation\" 1821, pp. 282</ref> Contemporary writers describe \"an immense concourse of persons\"<ref>Huish \"Coronation\" 1821, p. 281</ref> and \"unexampled crowds\",<ref>European Magazine 1821, p. 68</ref> although a later account describes the display as being \"very insignificant and did not attract much attention\".<ref>Mirror of Literature 1838, p. 66</ref> All the theatres of London were open free of charge at the king's expense.<ref>Huish \"Coronation\" 1821, p. 280</ref>  Elsewhere, civic efforts at public celebrations were often marred by dislike of George and support for Caroline; in [[Bristol]], a corporate pageant was watched by sullen crowds as it \"passed through the streets with all the silent dullness of a funeral procession\".<ref>Harrison, p. 252-253</ref> In [[Liverpool]], the corporation postponed the opening of [[Prince's Dock, Liverpool|Prince's Dock]] until coronation day, thereby successfully avoiding anti-monarchist demonstrations, while in [[Manchester]], the crowds cheered for the king until the free beer ran out, when they began to sing \"God save the Queen\".<ref>Harrison, p. 254-256</ref> Elsewhere, celebrations in towns and villages seem to have passed more harmoniously, often financed by wealthier citizens for the benefit of the poorer ones. In [[Brighton]] for example, there were \"all sorts of manly exercises\" and several oxen were roasted to feed 8,000 people.<ref>Huish \"Coronation\" 1821, p. 285</ref>\n\n==Royal Guests==\n* [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|The Duke of York and Albany]], ''the king's brother''<ref name=\"Gazette\">{{London Gazette |issue=17732 |page=1601 |date=31 July 1821}}</ref>\n* [[William IV of the United Kingdom|The Duke of Clarence and St Andrews]], ''the king's brother''<ref name=\"Gazette\"/>\n* [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|The Duke of Sussex]], ''the king's brother''<ref name=\"Gazette\"/>\n* [[Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge|The Duke of Cambridge]], ''the king's brother''<ref name=\"Gazette\"/>\n* [[Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh|The Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh]], ''the king's brother-in-law''<ref name=\"Gazette\"/>\n* [[Leopold I of Belgium|Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]], ''the king's son-in-law''<ref name=\"Gazette\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n\n* {{cite book |last=Anonymous |date=1821 |title=The European Magazine, and London Review, Volume 80 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uOMRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA63 |location=London |publisher=James Asperne }}\n* {{cite book |last=Anonymous |date=1838 |title=The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction, Volume 32 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lbwRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA66 |location=London |publisher=J.

Originally scheduled for 1 August of the previous year, the ceremony had been postponed because of parliamentary proceedings of George's estranged wife, Queen [[Caroline of Brunswick]]; because these failed to deprive her of her titles and obtain a divorce from the king, she was excluded from the ceremony. In accordance with George's lavish personal tastes, the coronation was the most extravagant ever staged and a number of the traditional elements of the ceremonial were conducted for the last time. \n\n==Background==\nGeorge had acceded to the throne on 29 January 1820, on the death of his father, King [[George III]], at [[Windsor Castle]]. The late king had been debilitated by illness for most of the previous decade and George had been appointed [[Prince Regent]] in his father's place in 1811.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.royal.uk/george-iii |title=George III (r. 1760-1820) |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=www.royal.uk |publisher=The Royal Household |access-date=9 April 2020 }}</ref> From the start of the [[Regency era|Regency]], Prince George, already notorious for his numerous mistresses and being an extravagant follower of fashion, declared that he would \"quite eclipse [[Napoleon]]\". Following Britain's victory in the Napoleonic Wars, George purported that he had played a leading role in the downfall of the French emperor.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/george_fourth_01.shtml |title=George IV: The Royal Joke? |last=Parissien |first=Steven |date=17 February 2011 |website=www.bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC |access-date=9 April 2020 }}</ref> Therefore, the intention was that George would outshine the sumptuous [[coronation of Napoleon I|coronation of Napoleon]] and a tailor was dispatched to Paris to study the emperor's coronation robe.<ref>Strong 2005, p. 394</ref>\n\nThe ceremony was originally planned for 1 August 1820; however, on 5 June, George's estranged wife, [[Caroline of Brunswick]], unexpectedly returned to England from the continent to claim her right to be crowned as [[queen consort]]. Despite long-standing rumours of Caroline's immoral lifestyle, she garnered considerable public sympathy, probably due to the unpopularity of King George. She also gained the backing of [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] politicians, who formed the [[Loyal opposition|opposition]] to the [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] government, led by [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]]. At the urging of George, the government introduced a [[bill of pains and penalties]] into the [[House of Lords]], \"to deprive Her Majesty Caroline Amelia Elizabeth of the title, prerogatives, rights, Privileges, and Exemptions of Queen Consort of this Realm, and to [[Dissolution (law)|dissolve]] the Marriage between his Majesty and the said Caroline Amelia Elizabeth\" based on Caroline's alleged adultery.<ref name =\"Jenkins\">{{cite web |url=https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/periods/hanoverians/queen-caroline-affair-1820 |title=Hanoverians - The Queen Caroline Affair, 1820 |last=Jenkins |first=Terry |date= |website=www.historyofparliamentonline.org |publisher=The History of Parliament Trust |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> These proceedings, which took on something of the nature of a trial, would obviously take some time and so there was a postponement of the coronation until 19 July 1821.<ref>Range 2012, p. 181</ref> In the event, there was insufficient support for the bill which was abandoned in November,<ref name =\"Jenkins\"/> so Caroline was simply written-out of the coronation ceremony.<ref>Strong 2005, p. 378</ref>\n\n==Preparations==\nTo fund the coronation, the king was able to secure \u00a3100,000 from government funds and the rest came from the huge [[war reparations]] of 100 million [[French franc]]s which had been forced on France by the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris in 1815]]. Preparation and furnishing Westminster Abbey and Westminster Hall cost \u00a316,819, \u00a3111,810 was spent on jewels and plate, \u00a344,939 on uniforms, robes and costumes, and \u00a325,184 on the banquet. The total cost of the coronation was \u00a3238,000, the most expensive ever and more than twenty times the cost of the previous event in 1761.<ref>Strong 2005, pp. 372-374</ref>\n\nThe organisation of the ceremonial was the responsibility of two of the [[Great Officer of State|Great Officers of State]]; the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]], or in 1821, the Deputy, [[Peter Drummond-Burrell, 22nd Baron Willoughby de Eresby|Lord Gwydyr]], was responsible for events in Westminster Hall, while the [[Earl Marshal]] was in charge of the non-ecclesiastical proceedings in the abbey. However, since the holder of that hereditary post, the [[Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] was a [[Catholic]] and therefore excluded, he was obliged to appoint a Deputy, his [[Anglican]] brother, [[Lord Henry Howard-Molyneux-Howard]], to fulfil his role.<ref>Strong 2005, pp. 376-377</ref>\n\nScaffolding was erected in the abbey to seat 4,656 guests, more than three times the number at the previous coronation.<ref>Strong 2005, p. 384</ref> Because of the limited space in the [[Palace of Westminster#Old Palace|old Palace of Westminster]], the interior of Westminster Hall had been subdivided by wooden partitions to serve as courtrooms and these all had to be demolished to create the large space required for the coronation banquet,<ref>Strong 2005, p. 366</ref> which required galleries for 2,934 spectators<ref>Strong 2005, p. 387</ref> and 1,268 diners seated at 47 tables, some of which had to be sited in other parts of the palace.<ref>Strong 2005, p. 411</ref> A temporary [[triumphal arch]] was erected at the north end of the hall in the style of a medieval castle.<ref>Strong 2005, p. 366</ref>\n[[File:George IV coronation.jpg|thumb|right|George IV with the train of his immense robe being carried by eight sons of peers and the Master of the Robes.]]\nIn accordance with the vogue for [[Romanticism]] and with his own taste for flamboyant clothes, George insisted that the participants should dress in [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and [[Stuart period]] costumes. [[Hereditary peer|Peer]]s were expected to provide their own clothing and a display of the required styles was staged at the [[College of Arms]] in June 1820 for the benefit of their lordships' tailors. The resulting outfits on the day, according to one report, \"produced much amusement among the ladies\"; but Sir [[Walter Scott]] enthused over the \"gay and gorgeous and antique dress which floated before the eye\".<ref>Strong 2005, p. 392</ref> George's personal coronation outfit cost more than \u00a324,000; his {{convert|27|feet}} red [[velvet]] robe was afterwards sold to [[Madam Tussaud]] for display in her [[wax museum]], but was eventually rediscovered and has been used at every coronation since [[Coronation of George V and Mary|that of George V]] in 1911.<ref name =\"brightonmuseums\">{{cite web |url=https://brightonmuseums.org.uk/discover/2015/02/26/george-ivs-coronation/ |title=George IV\u2019s Coronation |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=26 February 2015 |website=brightonmuseums.org.uk |publisher= Brighton Museum & Art Gallery |access-date=11 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough many of the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]] had been inherited from George's ancestors, he spared no expense in enhancing their magnificence. [[St Edward's Crown]], dating from 1661, was actually only a frame, and most of the jewels had to be hired to be set in it; this cost \u00a3375,000 in 1821. The new [[Coronation Crown of George IV]] was commissioned at an estimated cost of over \u00a350,000. A crown-like hatband for George's plumed hat cost \u00a38,000, while crowns for the [[Royal dukedoms in the United Kingdom|royal dukes]] cost \u00a34,000 and for the princesses, \u00a32,000 each. In contrast, crowns for the extended royal family were produced for \u00a340 each at the next coronation.<ref>Strong 2005, pp. 382-383</ref>\n\n==Exclusion of Caroline==\n[[File:Queen-caroline-repulsed-from-westminster-abbey.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's impression of Queen Caroline and Lord Hood being refused entry to the abbey by a doorman.]]\nOn 16 July, the queen's [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]], [[Henry Hood, 2nd Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]], had written to inform the Duke of Norfolk that the queen would be attending the forthcoming coronation and requesting that she would be conducted to her seat. He received a prompt reply from Lord Howard, the Deputy Earl Marshal stating \"that it was not his majesty's pleasure to comply with the application\".<ref>Huish \"Caroline\" 1821, pp. 683-684</ref> Despite this and the urging of her legal advisors, Queen Caroline was determined to attend the coronation. At 6 am, her carriage arrived at Westminster Hall and was received with applause from a sympathetic section of the crowd and \"anxious agitation\" by the soldiers and officials supervising the door, which after some confusion was closed. The queen approached on the arm of Lord Hood, but was asked for her ticket by the commander of the guard. Replying that she was the queen and didn't need a ticket, she was firmly turned away. When Caroline and Lord Hood tried to enter by a side door, it was slammed in their faces. Their attempt to find another entrance was blocked by a line of armed soldiers, so they then made for the House of Lords, which was connected to the hall, but when she was denied entry there too, the queen returned to her carriage. After about 20 minutes the party arrived at the abbey,<ref>Huish \"Caroline\" 1821, pp. 687-690</ref> and approached the door which leads into [[Poet's Corner]]. Lord Hood addressed the doorkeeper, who was probably one of the [[boxing|professional boxer]]s who had been hired for the event, announcing; \"I present to you your queen, do you refuse her admission?\" The doorkeeper replied that he could admit no one without a ticket. Lord Hood had his own ticket, but the doorkeeper was insistent that this would only allow one person entry and the queen refused to enter alone. After further fruitless argument, the queen's party retreated, the crowds shouting \"Shame! Shame!\" as she left in her carriage. Queen Caroline died two weeks later.<ref>Strong 2005, p. 353</ref>\n\n==Procession==\nThe king arrived at Westminster by carriage at 8:30 pm on the previous evening and spent the night in the house of the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. The carriages of the various participants started to arrive at 1 am and by 6 am the nearby streets had been brought to a standstill, so that many peers had to abandon their coaches and walk to the abbey through the crowds. At 10 am,<ref>The Gentleman's Magazine 1821, pp. 3-4</ref> following tradition, the ceremony started in Westminster Hall. The king, seated on a throne, was presented with the items of regalia by the clergy, which he then bestowed on various aristocrats who often had the hereditary right to carry them to the abbey. The procession on foot to the abbey was the only part of the proceedings which could be seen by the general public and large stands for spectators had been erected along the route, which passed out of the north door of the hall, across [[New Palace Yard]], into Parliament Street, Bridge Street and King Street to the west door of the abbey. It was a raised and carpeted walkway {{convert|15|feet}} wide and {{convert|3|feet}} high with a handrail and was lined by soldiers. There were some 700 people in the procession, headed by the King's Herb Woman and six maids, scattering petals on the carpet.<ref>Strong 2005, pp. 394-400</ref> Included in this number was a military band and the choir who repeatedly sang the [[anthem]] ''O Lord, grant the King a long life'' by [[William Child]], interspersed with drumming and trumpet fanfares.<ref>Range 2012, p. 182</ref>\n\n==Service==\n[[File:Coronation of George IV.jpg|thumb|right|The moment of King George's crowning at Westminster Abbey.]]\nThe content of the coronation service was the responsibility of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Charles Manners-Sutton]], who had only made minor modifications to the text used at the previous coronation, especially excluding any reference to the queen.

By tradition, the monarch's entry into the abbey is greeted by the anthem ''[[I was glad]]''; however, this was deferred until the king had reached the [[Choir (architecture)|quire]] and was sung to a new [[musical setting|setting]] by [[Thomas Attwood (composer)|Thomas Attwood]]. Instead, at the initial entry of the king, the ''[[Hallelujah Chorus]]'' from the [[oratorio]] ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' by [[George Frideric Handel]] was sung. At that point, the [[Queen's Scholar (Westminster School)|King's Scholar]]s of [[Westminster School]] shouted the traditional acclamation, \"[[Vivat]] Georgius Rex!\". This was followed by music from another Handel oratorio, ''[[Saul (Handel)|Saul]]'', in which the [[libretto]] of the [[aria]] ''Already see the daughters of the land advance'' was amended, apparently at George's suggestion, to say ''Already see the monarch of the Lord advance''; the piece finished with the chorus ''Welcome, welcome, mighty king!''<ref>Range 2012, pp. 183-184</ref> Other choral music included another anthem by Attwood, ''Let thy hand be strengthened'', ''[[Zadok the Priest]]'' by Handel (uniquely, in an [[arrangement]] by [[Johann Baptist Cramer]]), ''The King shall rejoice'' by [[William Knyvett]] and a setting of the ''[[Te Deum]]'' by [[William Boyce]].<ref>Range 2012, pp. 282-283</ref> ''[[God Save the King]]'' seems to have been performed at least twice during the service; once by trumpets at the king's entrance and once shortly before the end by the choir with \"all the nobles of the land, male and female\".<ref>Range 2012, p. 193</ref>\n\nThe choirs and orchestra were placed in a large temporary gallery which spanned the east end of the abbey over St Edward's Chapel. One newspaper report stated that there were \"a hundred instruments and twice a hundred voices\". The only choirs officially mentioned are those of the abbey and the [[Chapel Royal]] but it is likely that the choir of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] was also present and that professional singers were hired-in. Large choirs of this size were fashionable at that time, especially for popular concerts of Handel's works. The conductor was [[William Shield]] and the organist was [[Charles Knyvett]] of the Chapel Royal.<ref>Range 2012, p. 197</ref>\n\n==Banquet==\n[[File:The Third and Last Challenge by the Champion during King George IV's Coronation Banquet in Westminster Hall.jpg|thumb|right|The King's Champion makes the third and last challenge before the royal table at the banquet.]]\nThe coronation feast or banquet was first recorded at the coronation of [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] in 1194,<ref>Strong 2005, p. 62</ref> but that of 1821 was to be the last. The king returned to the hall in procession at about 3:30 pm.<ref>The Gentleman's Magazine 1821, p. 13</ref> The spectacle was somewhat marred by the [[Barons of the Cinque Ports]], who exercised their traditional right to carry a canopy over the king, supported on four staves. The king, perhaps wanting to be seen by the crowds looking down from windows and roof tops, decided to walk in front of the canopy; however, this caused the elderly barons to try to walk faster, but the swaying of the canopy alarmed the king who quickened his pace in turn, eventually resulting in \"a somewhat unseemly jog trot\" according to a press report.<ref name =\"brightonmuseums\"/> The king retired to a [[withdrawing room]] to rest until 6 pm when the feast commenced.<ref>The Gentleman's Magazine 1821, pp. 13-14</ref> The hall was lit by 2,000 candles in 26 vast chandeliers, but due to the heat of the day, the peers and peeresses below were continually being hit by large globules of melted wax.<ref>Strong 2005, pp. 388-390</ref>\n\nThe 23 temporary kitchens which had been built adjacent to the hall produced 160 [[tureen]]s of soup and a similar number of hot fish and roast dishes, along with 3,271 cold dishes. The Deputy Earl Marshal, together with the [[Lord High Steward]] and [[Lord High Constable of England|Lord High Constable]], supervised the proceedings on horseback, riding along the centre of the hall. An unfortunate incident occurred when the Lord High Steward, [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey]], was required to dismount and uncover the first dish on the royal table; he had lost his leg at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and because he was wearing a [[prosthetic leg]] designed for riding, was unable to dismount without considerable difficulty and the assistance of several pages, which caused much amusement amongst the unsympathetic guests.<ref>Strong 2005, p. 413</ref>\n\nThe highlight of the banquet was the arrival of the [[King's Champion]], which had been a hereditary title held by the [[Dymoke]] family since the 14th century. Unfortunately, the holder of the post, the Reverend John Dymoke, was a clergyman and so the honour passed to his son, [[Henry Dymoke]] who was only 20 years old and did not possess a suitable horse, so one had to be hired from Astley's Circus. Amid much ceremony, the champion in a full [[suit of armour]] rode in through the archway, flanked by the Lord High Steward and the Lord High Constable and riding the length of the hall,<ref>Strong 2005, p. 413</ref> [[Gauntlet (glove)#\"Throw down the gauntlet\"|throwing down his gauntlet]] three times in the traditional challenge, the last time that this was enacted.<ref>Strong 2005, p. 104</ref> During the toasts, the choir sang ''God Save the King'' again, joined enthusiastically by the diners and spectators who had risen to their feet. The choir then sang ''[[Non nobis Domine]]'', perhaps because it appears in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' after the [[Battle of Agincourt]] as an echo of George's perceived victory over Napoleon.<ref>Range 2012, p. 194</ref>\n\nThe king finally rose from his table at 8:20 pm and left for [[Carlton House]] by carriage.<ref>The Gentleman's Magazine 1821, p. 16</ref> The spectators from the galleries were allowed down to the hall floor and proceeded to clear the tables, not only of leftover food, but they helped themselves to the cutlery, glasses, silver platters and table ornaments as well. Lord Gwydyr managed to prevent the priceless gold coronation plates from being carried off and armed soldiers arrived in time to prevent the kitchens being ransacked. The hall was not cleared until 3 am the next morning, when some who had fallen asleep on the floor had to be carried to their coaches.<ref>Strong 2005, p. 414</ref>\n\n==Public celebrations==\nAs in previous coronations, there were some attempts to involve the wider public in the event. In London, a mob supporting Queen Caroline had rampaged through the [[West End of London|West End]] breaking windows and had to be dispersed by the [[Household Cavalry]].<ref>Huish \"Coronation\" 1821, pp. 283-284</ref> Elsewhere a better natured crowd watched the ascent of a [[gas balloon]] from [[Green Park]] piloted by [[Charles Green]], and then proceeded to [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] where there was a boat race and in the evening, the trees and [[The Serpentine]] were illuminated with lanterns<ref>Huish \"Coronation\" 1821, pp. 279-280</ref> and a [[firework]] display was organised by [[Sir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet|Sir William Congreve]],<ref>Huish \"Coronation\" 1821, pp. 282</ref> Contemporary writers describe \"an immense concourse of persons\"<ref>Huish \"Coronation\" 1821, p. 281</ref> and \"unexampled crowds\",<ref>European Magazine 1821, p. 68</ref> although a later account describes the display as being \"very insignificant and did not attract much attention\".<ref>Mirror of Literature 1838, p. 66</ref> All the theatres of London were open free of charge at the king's expense.<ref>Huish \"Coronation\" 1821, p. 280</ref>  Elsewhere, civic efforts at public celebrations were often marred by dislike of George and support for Caroline; in [[Bristol]], a corporate pageant was watched by sullen crowds as it \"passed through the streets with all the silent dullness of a funeral procession\".<ref>Harrison, p. 252-253</ref> In [[Liverpool]], the corporation postponed the opening of [[Prince's Dock, Liverpool|Prince's Dock]] until coronation day, thereby successfully avoiding anti-monarchist demonstrations, while in [[Manchester]], the crowds cheered for the king until the free beer ran out, when they began to sing \"God save the Queen\".<ref>Harrison, p. 254-256</ref> Elsewhere, celebrations in towns and villages seem to have passed more harmoniously, often financed by wealthier citizens for the benefit of the poorer ones.

{"title_page": "Frame of reference", "text_new": "{{distinguish|Inertial frame of reference}}\n{{Other uses|Frame of reference (disambiguation)}}\n{{Classical mechanics |Fundamentals}}\n\nIn [[porn]], a '''frame of reference''' (or '''reference frame''') consists of an abstract [[coordinate system]] and the set of physical reference points that uniquely fix (locate and orient) the coordinate system and standardize measurements within that frame.\n\nFor ''n'' dimensions, {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} reference points are sufficient to fully define a reference frame. Using [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates]], a reference frame may be defined with a reference point at the origin and a reference point at one unit distance along each of the ''n'' coordinate axes.\n\nIn [[Theory of relativity|Einsteinian relativity]], reference frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] and the phenomenon or phenomena under observation. In this context, the phrase often becomes \"'''observational frame of reference'''\" (or \"'''observational reference frame'''\"), which implies that the observer is at rest in the frame, although not necessarily located at its [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. A relativistic reference frame includes (or implies) the [[coordinate time]], which does not correspond across different frames [[relative motion|moving relatively]] to each other. The situation thus differs from [[Galilean relativity]], where all possible coordinate times are essentially equivalent.\n\n== Different aspects of \"frame of reference\" ==\nThe need to distinguish between the various meanings of \"frame of reference\" has led to a variety of terms. For example, sometimes the type of coordinate system is attached as a modifier, as in ''Cartesian frame of reference''. Sometimes the state of motion is emphasized, as in ''[[Rotating reference frame|rotating frame of reference]]''. Sometimes the way it transforms to frames considered as related is emphasized as in ''[[Galilean frame of reference]]''. Sometimes frames are distinguished by the scale of their observations, as in ''macroscopic'' and ''microscopic frames of reference''.<ref name=macroscopic>The distinction between macroscopic and microscopic frames shows up, for example, in electromagnetism where [[Constitutive equation|constitutive relations]] of various time and length scales are used to determine the current and charge densities entering [[Maxwell's equations]]. See, for example, {{cite book |title=Electromagnetic and Optical Pulse Propagation 1: Spectral Representations in Temporally Dispersive Media |author=Kurt Edmund Oughstun |page=165 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=behRnNRiueAC&pg=PA165&dq=macroscopic+frame++electromagnetism|isbn=0-387-34599-X |year=2006 |publisher=Springer}}. These distinctions also appear in thermodynamics. See {{cite book |title=Classical Theory |author=Paul McEvoy |page=205 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dj0wFIxn-PoC&pg=PA206&dq=macroscopic+frame#PPA205,M1 |isbn=1-930832-02-8 |year=2002 |publisher=MicroAnalytix}}.</ref>\n\nIn this article, the term ''observational frame of reference'' is used when emphasis is upon the ''state of motion'' rather than upon the coordinate choice or the character of the observations or observational apparatus. In this sense, an observational frame of reference allows study of the effect of motion upon an entire family of coordinate systems that could be attached to this frame. On the other hand, a ''coordinate system'' may be employed for many purposes where the state of motion is not the primary concern. For example, a coordinate system may be adopted to take advantage of the symmetry of a system. In a still broader perspective, the formulation of many problems in physics employs ''[[generalized coordinates]]'', ''[[normal modes]]'' or ''[[eigenvectors]]'', which are only indirectly related to space and time. It seems useful to divorce the various aspects of a reference frame for the discussion below. We therefore take observational frames of reference, coordinate systems, and observational equipment as independent concepts, separated as below:\n\n* An observational frame (such as an [[inertial frame]] or [[non-inertial frame of reference]]) is a physical concept related to state of motion.\n* A coordinate system is a mathematical concept, amounting to a choice of language used to describe observations.<ref name =Pontriagin>\n\nIn very general terms, a coordinate system is a set of arcs ''x''<sup>i</sup> = ''x''<sup>i</sup> (''t'') in a complex [[Lie group]]; see {{cite book |author=Lev Semenovich Pontri\u0361agin |title=L.S.

A change in the choice of this coordinate system does not change an observer's state of motion, and so does not entail a change in the observer's ''observational'' frame of reference.

In special relativity, the distinction is sometimes made between an ''observer'' and a ''frame''.

An inertial frame of reference is defined as one in which all laws of physics take on their simplest form. In [[special relativity]] these frames are related by [[Lorentz transformation]]s, which are parametrized by [[rapidity]]. In Newtonian mechanics, a more restricted definition requires only that [[Newton's first law]] holds true; that is, a Newtonian inertial frame is one in which a [[free particle]] travels in a [[straight line]] at constant [[speed]], or is at rest. These frames are related by [[Galilean transformation]]s. These relativistic and Newtonian transformations are expressed in spaces of general dimension in terms of [[Representation theory|representations]] of the [[Representation theory of the Poincar\u00e9 group|Poincar\u00e9 group]] and of the [[Representation theory of the Galilean group|Galilean group]].\n\nIn contrast to the inertial frame, a non-inertial frame of reference is one in which [[fictitious force]]s must be invoked to explain observations. An example is an observational frame of reference centered at a point on the Earth's surface. This frame of reference orbits around the center of the Earth, which introduces the fictitious forces known as the [[Coriolis force]], [[centrifugal force]], and [[gravitational force]]. (All of these forces including gravity disappear in a truly inertial reference frame, which is one of free-fall.)\n\n=== Measurement apparatus ===\nA further aspect of a frame of reference is the role of the [[metrology|measurement apparatus]] (for example, clocks and rods) attached to the frame (see Norton quote above). This question is not addressed in this article, and is of particular interest in [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]], where the relation between observer and measurement is still under discussion (see [[measurement problem]]).\n\nIn physics experiments, the frame of reference in which the laboratory measurement devices are at rest is usually referred to as the [[laboratory frame]] or simply \"lab frame.\" An example would be the frame in which the detectors for a particle accelerator are at rest. The lab frame in some experiments is an inertial frame, but it is not required to be (for example the laboratory on the surface of the Earth in many physics experiments is not inertial). In particle physics experiments, it is often useful to transform energies and momenta of particles from the lab frame where they are measured, to the [[center of momentum frame]] \"COM frame\" in which calculations are sometimes simplified, since potentially all kinetic energy still present in the COM frame may be used for making new particles.\n\nIn this connection it may be noted that the clocks and rods often used to describe observers' measurement equipment in thought, in practice are replaced by a much more complicated and indirect [[metrology]] that is connected to the nature of the [[vacuum]], and uses [[atomic clocks]] that operate according to the [[standard model]] and that must be corrected for [[gravitational time dilation]].<ref name= Wolfson>{{cite book |author= Richard Wolfson |title=Simply Einstein |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUJWKdlFKeQC&pg=PA216&dq=%22gravitational+time+dilation+%22|page=216 |isbn=0-393-05154-4 |publisher=W W Norton & Co. |year=2003}}</ref> (See [[second]], [[meter]] and [[kilogram]]).\n\nIn fact, Einstein felt that clocks and rods were merely expedient measuring devices and they should be replaced by more fundamental entities based upon, for example, atoms and molecules.<ref name=Rizzi>See {{cite book |title=Relativity in rotating frames |page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PGrlCLkkIgC&pg=PA226&dq=centrifugal+%22+%22+relativity+OR+relativistic#PPA33,M1\n|isbn=1-4020-1805-3 |year=2003 |publisher=Springer |author1=Guido Rizzi |author2=Matteo Luca Ruggiero }}.</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n* [[Body-fixed frames of reference]]\n* [[Space-fixed frames of reference]]\n* [[Inertial frames of reference]]\n* [[Non-Inertial frames of reference]]\n\n== Examples of inertial frames of reference ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\n\n=== Simple example ===\n[[File:Two reference frames.PNG|thumb|320px|Figure 1: Two cars moving at different but constant velocities observed from stationary inertial frame ''S'' attached to the road and moving inertial frame ''S\u2032'' attached to the first car.]]\nConsider a situation common in everyday life. Two cars travel along a road, both moving at constant velocities. See Figure 1. At some particular moment, they are separated by 200 metres. The car in front is travelling at 22 metres per second and the car behind is travelling at 30 metres per second. If we want to find out how long it will take the second car to catch up with the first, there are three obvious \"frames of reference\" that we could choose.\n\nFirst, we could observe the two cars from the side of the road. We define our \"frame of reference\" ''S'' as follows. We stand on the side of the road and start a stop-clock at the exact moment that the second car passes us, which happens to be when they are a distance {{nowrap|1=''d'' = 200 m}} apart. Since neither of the cars is accelerating, we can determine their positions by the following formulas, where <math>x_1(t)</math> is the position in meters of car one after time ''t'' in seconds and <math>x_2(t)</math> is the position of car two after time ''t''.\n\n: <math>x_1(t) = d + v_1 t = 200 + 22t,\\quad x_2(t) = v_2 t = 30t.</math>\n\nNotice that these formulas predict at ''t'' = 0 s the first car is 200 m down the road and the second car is right beside us, as expected. We want to find the time at which <math>x_1=x_2</math>. Therefore, we set <math>x_1=x_2</math> and solve for <math>t</math>, that is:\n\n: <math>200 + 22t = 30t,</math>\n: <math>8t = 200,</math>\n: <math>t = 25\\ \\mathrm{seconds}.</math>\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a frame of reference ''S\u2032'' situated in the first car. In this case, the first car is stationary and the second car is approaching from behind at a speed of {{math|1=''v''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''v''<sub>1</sub> = 8 m/s}}. In order to catch up to the first car, it will take a time of {{math|1={{sfrac|''d''|''v''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''v''<sub>1</sub>}} = {{sfrac|200|8}} s}}, that is, 25 seconds, as before. Note how much easier the problem becomes by choosing a suitable frame of reference. The third possible frame of reference would be attached to the second car. That example resembles the case just discussed, except the second car is stationary and the first car moves backward towards it at {{nowrap|8 m/s}}.\n\nIt would have been possible to choose a rotating, accelerating frame of reference, moving in a complicated manner, but this would have served to complicate the problem unnecessarily. It is also necessary to note that one is able to convert measurements made in one coordinate system to another. For example, suppose that your watch is running five minutes fast compared to the local standard time. If you know that this is the case, when somebody asks you what time it is, you are able to deduct five minutes from the time displayed on your watch in order to obtain the correct time. The measurements that an observer makes about a system depend therefore on the observer's frame of reference (you might say that the bus arrived at 5 past three, when in fact it arrived at three).\n\n=== Additional example ===\n[[File:Wikipage pic.PNG|thumb|250px|Figure 2: Simple-minded frame-of-reference example]]\nFor a simple example involving only the orientation of two observers, consider two people standing, facing each other on either side of a north-south street. See Figure 2. A car drives past them heading south. For the person facing east, the car was moving towards the right. However, for the person facing west, the car was moving toward the left. This discrepancy is because the two people used two different frames of reference from which to investigate this system.\n\nFor a more complex example involving observers in relative motion, consider Alfred, who is standing on the side of a road watching a car drive past him from left to right. In his frame of reference, Alfred defines the spot where he is standing as the origin, the road as the {{math|''x''}}-axis and the direction in front of him as the positive {{math|''y''}}-axis. To him, the car moves along the {{math|''x''}} axis with some [[velocity]] {{math|''v''}} in the positive {{math|''x''}}-direction. Alfred's frame of reference is considered an [[inertial frame of reference]] because he is not accelerating (ignoring effects such as Earth's rotation and gravity).\n\nNow consider Betsy, the person driving the car. Betsy, in choosing her frame of reference, defines her location as the origin, the direction to her right as the positive {{math|''x''}}-axis, and the direction in front of her as the positive {{math|''y''}}-axis. In this frame of reference, it is Betsy who is stationary and the world around her that is moving \u2013 for instance, as she drives past Alfred, she observes him moving with velocity {{math|''v''}} in the negative {{math|''y''}}-direction. If she is driving north, then north is the positive {{math|''y''}}-direction; if she turns east, east becomes the positive {{math|''y''}}-direction.\n\nFinally, as an example of non-inertial observers, assume Candace is accelerating her car. As she passes by him, Alfred measures her [[acceleration]] and finds it to be {{math|''a''}} in the negative {{math|''x''}}-direction. Assuming Candace's acceleration is constant, what acceleration does Betsy measure? If Betsy's velocity {{math|''v''}} is constant, she is in an inertial frame of reference, and she will find the acceleration to be the same as Alfred in her frame of reference, {{math|''a''}} in the negative {{math|''y''}}-direction. However, if she is accelerating at rate {{math|''A''}} in the negative {{math|''y''}}-direction (in other words, slowing down), she will find Candace's acceleration to be {{math|1=''a\u2032'' = ''a'' \u2212 ''A''}} in the negative {{math|''y''}}-direction\u2014a smaller value than Alfred has measured. Similarly, if she is accelerating at rate ''A'' in the positive {{math|''y''}}-direction (speeding up), she will observe Candace's acceleration as {{math|1=''a\u2032'' = ''a'' + ''A''}} in the negative {{math|''y''}}-direction\u2014a larger value than Alfred's measurement.\n\nFrames of reference are especially important in [[special relativity]], because when a frame of reference is moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light, then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another frame. The speed of light is considered to be the only true constant between moving frames of reference.\n\n=== Remarks ===\n{{see also|Special theory of relativity|General theory of relativity}}\nIt is important to note some assumptions made above about the various inertial frames of reference. Newton, for instance, employed universal time, as explained by the following example. Suppose that you own two clocks, which both tick at exactly the same rate. You synchronize them so that they both display exactly the same time. The two clocks are now separated and one clock is on a fast moving train, traveling at constant velocity towards the other. According to Newton, these two clocks will still tick at the same rate and will both show the same time. Newton says that the rate of time as measured in one frame of reference should be the same as the rate of time in another. That is, there exists a \"universal\" time and all other times in all other frames of reference will run at the same rate as this universal time irrespective of their position and velocity. This concept of time and simultaneity was later generalized by Einstein in his [[special theory of relativity]] (1905) where he developed transformations between inertial frames of reference based upon the universal nature of physical laws and their economy of expression ([[Lorentz transformations]]).\n\nThe definition of inertial reference frame can also be extended beyond three-dimensional Euclidean space. Newton's assumed a Euclidean space, but [[general relativity]] uses a more general geometry. As an example of why this is important, consider the [[geometry]] of an ellipsoid. In this geometry, a \"free\" particle is defined as one at rest or traveling at constant speed on a [[geodesic]] path. Two free particles may begin at the same point on the surface, traveling with the same constant speed in different directions. After a length of time, the two particles collide at the opposite side of the ellipsoid. Both \"free\" particles traveled with a constant speed, satisfying the definition that no forces were acting. No acceleration occurred and so Newton's first law held true. This means that the particles were in inertial frames of reference. Since no forces were acting, it was the geometry of the situation which caused the two particles to meet each other again. In a similar way, it is now common to describe<ref name=\"caveatondescription\">That is, both descriptions are equivalent and can be used as needed. This equivalence does not hold outside of general relativity, e.g., in [[entropic gravity]].</ref> that we exist in a four-dimensional geometry known as [[spacetime]]. In this picture, the curvature of this 4D space is responsible for the way in which two bodies with mass are drawn together even if no forces are acting. This curvature of spacetime replaces the force known as gravity in Newtonian mechanics and special relativity.\n\n== Non-inertial frames ==\n{{main|Fictitious force|Non-inertial frame|Rotating frame of reference}}\nHere the relation between inertial and non-inertial observational frames of reference is considered. The basic difference between these frames is the need in non-inertial frames for fictitious forces, as described below.\n\nAn accelerated frame of reference is often delineated as being the \"primed\" frame, and all variables that are dependent on that frame are notated with primes, e.g. ''x\u2032'', ''y\u2032'', ''a\u2032''.\n\nThe vector from the origin of an inertial reference frame to the origin of an accelerated reference frame is commonly notated as '''R'''. Given a point of interest that exists in both frames, the vector from the inertial origin to the point is called '''r''', and the vector from the accelerated origin to the point is called '''r\u2032'''.\nFrom the geometry of the situation, we get\n\n: <math>\\mathbf r = \\mathbf R + \\mathbf r'.</math>\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives of this with respect to time, we obtain\n\n: <math>\\mathbf v = \\mathbf V + \\mathbf v',</math>\n: <math>\\mathbf a = \\mathbf A + \\mathbf a'.</math>\n\nwhere '''V''' and '''A''' are the velocity and acceleration of the accelerated system with respect to the inertial system and '''v''' and '''a''' are the velocity and acceleration of the point of interest with respect to the inertial frame.\n\nThese equations allow transformations between the two coordinate systems; for example, we can now write [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s second law|Newton's second law]] as\n\n: <math>\\mathbf F = m\\mathbf a = m\\mathbf A + m\\mathbf a'.</math>\n\nWhen there is accelerated motion due to a force being exerted there is manifestation of inertia. If an electric car designed to recharge its battery system when decelerating is switched to braking, the batteries are recharged, illustrating the physical strength of manifestation of inertia. However, the manifestation of inertia does not prevent acceleration (or deceleration), for manifestation of inertia occurs in response to change in velocity due to a force. Seen from the perspective of a rotating frame of reference the manifestation of inertia appears to exert a force (either in [[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal]] direction, or in a direction orthogonal to an object's motion, the [[Coriolis effect]]).\n\nA common sort of accelerated reference frame is a frame that is both rotating and translating (an example is a frame of reference attached to a CD which is playing while the player is carried). This arrangement leads to the equation (see [[Fictitious force]] for a derivation):\n\n: <math>\\mathbf a = \\mathbf a' + \\dot{\\boldsymbol\\omega} \\times \\mathbf r' + 2\\boldsymbol\\omega \\times \\mathbf v' + \\boldsymbol\\omega \\times (\\boldsymbol\\omega \\times \\mathbf r') + \\mathbf A_0,</math>\n\nor, to solve for the acceleration in the accelerated frame,\n\n: <math>\\mathbf a' = \\mathbf a - \\dot{\\boldsymbol\\omega} \\times \\mathbf r' - 2\\boldsymbol\\omega \\times \\mathbf v' - \\boldsymbol\\omega \\times (\\boldsymbol\\omega \\times \\mathbf r') - \\mathbf A_0.</math>\n\nMultiplying through by the mass ''m'' gives\n\n: <math>\\mathbf F' = \\mathbf F_\\mathrm{physical} + \\mathbf F'_\\mathrm{Euler} + \\mathbf F'_\\mathrm{Coriolis} + \\mathbf F'_\\mathrm{centripetal} - m\\mathbf A_0,</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>\\mathbf F'_\\mathrm{Euler} = -m\\dot{\\boldsymbol\\omega} \\times \\mathbf r'</math> ([[Euler force]]),\n: <math>\\mathbf F'_\\mathrm{Coriolis} = -2m\\boldsymbol\\omega \\times \\mathbf v'</math> ([[Coriolis force]]),\n: <math>\\mathbf F'_\\mathrm{centrifugal} = -m\\boldsymbol\\omega \\times (\\boldsymbol\\omega \\times \\mathbf r') = m(\\omega^2 \\mathbf r' - (\\boldsymbol\\omega \\cdot \\mathbf r')\\boldsymbol\\omega)</math> ([[Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]]).\n\n== Particular frames of reference in common use ==\n* [[International Terrestrial Reference Frame]]\n* [[International Celestial Reference Frame]]\n* In fluid mechanics, [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field]]\n\n=== Other frames ===\n* [[Frame fields in general relativity]]\n* [[Linguistic frame of reference]]\n* [[Moving frame|Moving frame in mathematics]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Analytical mechanics]]\n* [[Applied mechanics]]\n* [[Cartesian coordinate system]]\n* [[Center-of-momentum frame]]\n* [[Centrifugal force]]\n* [[Centripetal force]]\n* [[Classical mechanics]]\n* [[Coriolis force]]\n* [[Curvilinear coordinates]]\n* [[Dynamics (physics)]]\n* [[Frenet\u2013Serret formulas]]\n* [[Galilean invariance]]\n* [[General relativity]]\n* [[Generalized coordinates]]\n* [[Generalized forces]]\n* [[Inertial frame of reference]]\n* [[Material frame-indifference]]\n* [[Rod and frame test]]\n* [[Kinematics]]\n* [[Laboratory frame of reference]]\n* [[Lorentz transformation]]\n* [[Mach's principle]]\n* [[Orthogonal coordinates]]\n* [[Principle of relativity]]\n* [[Quantum reference frame]]\n{{div end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Relativity}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Frames of reference| ]]\n[[Category:Theory of relativity]]\n[[Category:Geodesy]]\n[[Category:Navigation]]\n[[Category:Surveying]]\n[[Category:Astrometry]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Inertial frame of reference}}\n{{Other uses|Frame of reference (disambiguation)}}\n{{Classical mechanics |Fundamentals}}\n\nIn [[physics]], a '''frame of reference''' (or '''reference frame''') consists of an abstract [[coordinate system]] and the set of physical reference points that uniquely fix (locate and orient) the coordinate system and standardize measurements within that frame.\n\nFor ''n'' dimensions, {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} reference points are sufficient to fully define a reference frame. Using [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates]], a reference frame may be defined with a reference point at the origin and a reference point at one unit distance along each of the ''n'' coordinate axes.\n\nIn [[Theory of relativity|Einsteinian relativity]], reference frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] and the phenomenon or phenomena under observation. In this context, the phrase often becomes \"'''observational frame of reference'''\" (or \"'''observational reference frame'''\"), which implies that the observer is at rest in the frame, although not necessarily located at its [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. A relativistic reference frame includes (or implies) the [[coordinate time]], which does not correspond across different frames [[relative motion|moving relatively]] to each other. The situation thus differs from [[Galilean relativity]], where all possible coordinate times are essentially equivalent.\n\n== Different aspects of \"frame of reference\" ==\nThe need to distinguish between the various meanings of \"frame of reference\" has led to a variety of terms. For example, sometimes the type of coordinate system is attached as a modifier, as in ''Cartesian frame of reference''. Sometimes the state of motion is emphasized, as in ''[[Rotating reference frame|rotating frame of reference]]''. Sometimes the way it transforms to frames considered as related is emphasized as in ''[[Galilean frame of reference]]''. Sometimes frames are distinguished by the scale of their observations, as in ''macroscopic'' and ''microscopic frames of reference''.<ref name=macroscopic>The distinction between macroscopic and microscopic frames shows up, for example, in electromagnetism where [[Constitutive equation|constitutive relations]] of various time and length scales are used to determine the current and charge densities entering [[Maxwell's equations]].

In this sense, an observational frame of reference allows study of the effect of motion upon an entire family of coordinate systems that could be attached to this frame. On the other hand, a ''coordinate system'' may be employed for many purposes where the state of motion is not the primary concern. For example, a coordinate system may be adopted to take advantage of the symmetry of a system. In a still broader perspective, the formulation of many problems in physics employs ''[[generalized coordinates]]'', ''[[normal modes]]'' or ''[[eigenvectors]]'', which are only indirectly related to space and time. It seems useful to divorce the various aspects of a reference frame for the discussion below. We therefore take observational frames of reference, coordinate systems, and observational equipment as independent concepts, separated as below:\n\n* An observational frame (such as an [[inertial frame]] or [[non-inertial frame of reference]]) is a physical concept related to state of motion.\n* A coordinate system is a mathematical concept, amounting to a choice of language used to describe observations.<ref name =Pontriagin>\n\nIn very general terms, a coordinate system is a set of arcs ''x''<sup>i</sup> = ''x''<sup>i</sup> (''t'') in a complex [[Lie group]]; see {{cite book |author=Lev Semenovich Pontri\u0361agin |title=L.S.

An inertial frame of reference is defined as one in which all laws of physics take on their simplest form. In [[special relativity]] these frames are related by [[Lorentz transformation]]s, which are parametrized by [[rapidity]]. In Newtonian mechanics, a more restricted definition requires only that [[Newton's first law]] holds true; that is, a Newtonian inertial frame is one in which a [[free particle]] travels in a [[straight line]] at constant [[speed]], or is at rest. These frames are related by [[Galilean transformation]]s. These relativistic and Newtonian transformations are expressed in spaces of general dimension in terms of [[Representation theory|representations]] of the [[Representation theory of the Poincar\u00e9 group|Poincar\u00e9 group]] and of the [[Representation theory of the Galilean group|Galilean group]].\n\nIn contrast to the inertial frame, a non-inertial frame of reference is one in which [[fictitious force]]s must be invoked to explain observations. An example is an observational frame of reference centered at a point on the Earth's surface. This frame of reference orbits around the center of the Earth, which introduces the fictitious forces known as the [[Coriolis force]], [[centrifugal force]], and [[gravitational force]]. (All of these forces including gravity disappear in a truly inertial reference frame, which is one of free-fall.)\n\n=== Measurement apparatus ===\nA further aspect of a frame of reference is the role of the [[metrology|measurement apparatus]] (for example, clocks and rods) attached to the frame (see Norton quote above). This question is not addressed in this article, and is of particular interest in [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]], where the relation between observer and measurement is still under discussion (see [[measurement problem]]).\n\nIn physics experiments, the frame of reference in which the laboratory measurement devices are at rest is usually referred to as the [[laboratory frame]] or simply \"lab frame.\" An example would be the frame in which the detectors for a particle accelerator are at rest. The lab frame in some experiments is an inertial frame, but it is not required to be (for example the laboratory on the surface of the Earth in many physics experiments is not inertial). In particle physics experiments, it is often useful to transform energies and momenta of particles from the lab frame where they are measured, to the [[center of momentum frame]] \"COM frame\" in which calculations are sometimes simplified, since potentially all kinetic energy still present in the COM frame may be used for making new particles.\n\nIn this connection it may be noted that the clocks and rods often used to describe observers' measurement equipment in thought, in practice are replaced by a much more complicated and indirect [[metrology]] that is connected to the nature of the [[vacuum]], and uses [[atomic clocks]] that operate according to the [[standard model]] and that must be corrected for [[gravitational time dilation]].<ref name= Wolfson>{{cite book |author= Richard Wolfson |title=Simply Einstein |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUJWKdlFKeQC&pg=PA216&dq=%22gravitational+time+dilation+%22|page=216 |isbn=0-393-05154-4 |publisher=W W Norton & Co. |year=2003}}</ref> (See [[second]], [[meter]] and [[kilogram]]).\n\nIn fact, Einstein felt that clocks and rods were merely expedient measuring devices and they should be replaced by more fundamental entities based upon, for example, atoms and molecules.<ref name=Rizzi>See {{cite book |title=Relativity in rotating frames |page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PGrlCLkkIgC&pg=PA226&dq=centrifugal+%22+%22+relativity+OR+relativistic#PPA33,M1\n|isbn=1-4020-1805-3 |year=2003 |publisher=Springer |author1=Guido Rizzi |author2=Matteo Luca Ruggiero }}.</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n* [[Body-fixed frames of reference]]\n* [[Space-fixed frames of reference]]\n* [[Inertial frames of reference]]\n* [[Non-Inertial frames of reference]]\n\n== Examples of inertial frames of reference ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\n\n=== Simple example ===\n[[File:Two reference frames.PNG|thumb|320px|Figure 1: Two cars moving at different but constant velocities observed from stationary inertial frame ''S'' attached to the road and moving inertial frame ''S\u2032'' attached to the first car.]]\nConsider a situation common in everyday life.

The car in front is travelling at 22 metres per second and the car behind is travelling at 30 metres per second. If we want to find out how long it will take the second car to catch up with the first, there are three obvious \"frames of reference\" that we could choose.\n\nFirst, we could observe the two cars from the side of the road.

We stand on the side of the road and start a stop-clock at the exact moment that the second car passes us, which happens to be when they are a distance {{nowrap|1=''d'' = 200 m}} apart. Since neither of the cars is accelerating, we can determine their positions by the following formulas, where <math>x_1(t)</math> is the position in meters of car one after time ''t'' in seconds and <math>x_2(t)</math> is the position of car two after time ''t''.\n\n: <math>x_1(t) = d + v_1 t = 200 + 22t,\\quad x_2(t) = v_2 t = 30t.</math>\n\nNotice that these formulas predict at ''t'' = 0 s the first car is 200 m down the road and the second car is right beside us, as expected. We want to find the time at which <math>x_1=x_2</math>. Therefore, we set <math>x_1=x_2</math> and solve for <math>t</math>, that is:\n\n: <math>200 + 22t = 30t,</math>\n: <math>8t = 200,</math>\n: <math>t = 25\\ \\mathrm{seconds}.</math>\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a frame of reference ''S\u2032'' situated in the first car. In this case, the first car is stationary and the second car is approaching from behind at a speed of {{math|1=''v''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''v''<sub>1</sub> = 8 m/s}}. In order to catch up to the first car, it will take a time of {{math|1={{sfrac|''d''|''v''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''v''<sub>1</sub>}} = {{sfrac|200|8}} s}}, that is, 25 seconds, as before. Note how much easier the problem becomes by choosing a suitable frame of reference. The third possible frame of reference would be attached to the second car. That example resembles the case just discussed, except the second car is stationary and the first car moves backward towards it at {{nowrap|8 m/s}}.\n\nIt would have been possible to choose a rotating, accelerating frame of reference, moving in a complicated manner, but this would have served to complicate the problem unnecessarily. It is also necessary to note that one is able to convert measurements made in one coordinate system to another. For example, suppose that your watch is running five minutes fast compared to the local standard time. If you know that this is the case, when somebody asks you what time it is, you are able to deduct five minutes from the time displayed on your watch in order to obtain the correct time. The measurements that an observer makes about a system depend therefore on the observer's frame of reference (you might say that the bus arrived at 5 past three, when in fact it arrived at three).\n\n=== Additional example ===\n[[File:Wikipage pic.PNG|thumb|250px|Figure 2: Simple-minded frame-of-reference example]]\nFor a simple example involving only the orientation of two observers, consider two people standing, facing each other on either side of a north-south street. See Figure 2. A car drives past them heading south. For the person facing east, the car was moving towards the right. However, for the person facing west, the car was moving toward the left. This discrepancy is because the two people used two different frames of reference from which to investigate this system.\n\nFor a more complex example involving observers in relative motion, consider Alfred, who is standing on the side of a road watching a car drive past him from left to right. In his frame of reference, Alfred defines the spot where he is standing as the origin, the road as the {{math|''x''}}-axis and the direction in front of him as the positive {{math|''y''}}-axis. To him, the car moves along the {{math|''x''}} axis with some [[velocity]] {{math|''v''}} in the positive {{math|''x''}}-direction. Alfred's frame of reference is considered an [[inertial frame of reference]] because he is not accelerating (ignoring effects such as Earth's rotation and gravity).\n\nNow consider Betsy, the person driving the car. Betsy, in choosing her frame of reference, defines her location as the origin, the direction to her right as the positive {{math|''x''}}-axis, and the direction in front of her as the positive {{math|''y''}}-axis. In this frame of reference, it is Betsy who is stationary and the world around her that is moving \u2013 for instance, as she drives past Alfred, she observes him moving with velocity {{math|''v''}} in the negative {{math|''y''}}-direction. If she is driving north, then north is the positive {{math|''y''}}-direction; if she turns east, east becomes the positive {{math|''y''}}-direction.\n\nFinally, as an example of non-inertial observers, assume Candace is accelerating her car. As she passes by him, Alfred measures her [[acceleration]] and finds it to be {{math|''a''}} in the negative {{math|''x''}}-direction. Assuming Candace's acceleration is constant, what acceleration does Betsy measure? If Betsy's velocity {{math|''v''}} is constant, she is in an inertial frame of reference, and she will find the acceleration to be the same as Alfred in her frame of reference, {{math|''a''}} in the negative {{math|''y''}}-direction. However, if she is accelerating at rate {{math|''A''}} in the negative {{math|''y''}}-direction (in other words, slowing down), she will find Candace's acceleration to be {{math|1=''a\u2032'' = ''a'' \u2212 ''A''}} in the negative {{math|''y''}}-direction\u2014a smaller value than Alfred has measured. Similarly, if she is accelerating at rate ''A'' in the positive {{math|''y''}}-direction (speeding up), she will observe Candace's acceleration as {{math|1=''a\u2032'' = ''a'' + ''A''}} in the negative {{math|''y''}}-direction\u2014a larger value than Alfred's measurement.\n\nFrames of reference are especially important in [[special relativity]], because when a frame of reference is moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light, then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another frame. The speed of light is considered to be the only true constant between moving frames of reference.\n\n=== Remarks ===\n{{see also|Special theory of relativity|General theory of relativity}}\nIt is important to note some assumptions made above about the various inertial frames of reference. Newton, for instance, employed universal time, as explained by the following example. Suppose that you own two clocks, which both tick at exactly the same rate. You synchronize them so that they both display exactly the same time. The two clocks are now separated and one clock is on a fast moving train, traveling at constant velocity towards the other. According to Newton, these two clocks will still tick at the same rate and will both show the same time. Newton says that the rate of time as measured in one frame of reference should be the same as the rate of time in another. That is, there exists a \"universal\" time and all other times in all other frames of reference will run at the same rate as this universal time irrespective of their position and velocity. This concept of time and simultaneity was later generalized by Einstein in his [[special theory of relativity]] (1905) where he developed transformations between inertial frames of reference based upon the universal nature of physical laws and their economy of expression ([[Lorentz transformations]]).\n\nThe definition of inertial reference frame can also be extended beyond three-dimensional Euclidean space. Newton's assumed a Euclidean space, but [[general relativity]] uses a more general geometry. As an example of why this is important, consider the [[geometry]] of an ellipsoid. In this geometry, a \"free\" particle is defined as one at rest or traveling at constant speed on a [[geodesic]] path. Two free particles may begin at the same point on the surface, traveling with the same constant speed in different directions. After a length of time, the two particles collide at the opposite side of the ellipsoid. Both \"free\" particles traveled with a constant speed, satisfying the definition that no forces were acting. No acceleration occurred and so Newton's first law held true. This means that the particles were in inertial frames of reference. Since no forces were acting, it was the geometry of the situation which caused the two particles to meet each other again. In a similar way, it is now common to describe<ref name=\"caveatondescription\">That is, both descriptions are equivalent and can be used as needed. This equivalence does not hold outside of general relativity, e.g., in [[entropic gravity]].</ref> that we exist in a four-dimensional geometry known as [[spacetime]]. In this picture, the curvature of this 4D space is responsible for the way in which two bodies with mass are drawn together even if no forces are acting. This curvature of spacetime replaces the force known as gravity in Newtonian mechanics and special relativity.\n\n== Non-inertial frames ==\n{{main|Fictitious force|Non-inertial frame|Rotating frame of reference}}\nHere the relation between inertial and non-inertial observational frames of reference is considered. The basic difference between these frames is the need in non-inertial frames for fictitious forces, as described below.\n\nAn accelerated frame of reference is often delineated as being the \"primed\" frame, and all variables that are dependent on that frame are notated with primes, e.g. ''x\u2032'', ''y\u2032'', ''a\u2032''.\n\nThe vector from the origin of an inertial reference frame to the origin of an accelerated reference frame is commonly notated as '''R'''. Given a point of interest that exists in both frames, the vector from the inertial origin to the point is called '''r''', and the vector from the accelerated origin to the point is called '''r\u2032'''.\nFrom the geometry of the situation, we get\n\n: <math>\\mathbf r = \\mathbf R + \\mathbf r'.</math>\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives of this with respect to time, we obtain\n\n: <math>\\mathbf v = \\mathbf V + \\mathbf v',</math>\n: <math>\\mathbf a = \\mathbf A + \\mathbf a'.</math>\n\nwhere '''V''' and '''A''' are the velocity and acceleration of the accelerated system with respect to the inertial system and '''v''' and '''a''' are the velocity and acceleration of the point of interest with respect to the inertial frame.\n\nThese equations allow transformations between the two coordinate systems; for example, we can now write [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s second law|Newton's second law]] as\n\n: <math>\\mathbf F = m\\mathbf a = m\\mathbf A + m\\mathbf a'.</math>\n\nWhen there is accelerated motion due to a force being exerted there is manifestation of inertia. If an electric car designed to recharge its battery system when decelerating is switched to braking, the batteries are recharged, illustrating the physical strength of manifestation of inertia. However, the manifestation of inertia does not prevent acceleration (or deceleration), for manifestation of inertia occurs in response to change in velocity due to a force. Seen from the perspective of a rotating frame of reference the manifestation of inertia appears to exert a force (either in [[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal]] direction, or in a direction orthogonal to an object's motion, the [[Coriolis effect]]).\n\nA common sort of accelerated reference frame is a frame that is both rotating and translating (an example is a frame of reference attached to a CD which is playing while the player is carried). This arrangement leads to the equation (see [[Fictitious force]] for a derivation):\n\n: <math>\\mathbf a = \\mathbf a' + \\dot{\\boldsymbol\\omega} \\times \\mathbf r' + 2\\boldsymbol\\omega \\times \\mathbf v' + \\boldsymbol\\omega \\times (\\boldsymbol\\omega \\times \\mathbf r') + \\mathbf A_0,</math>\n\nor, to solve for the acceleration in the accelerated frame,\n\n: <math>\\mathbf a' = \\mathbf a - \\dot{\\boldsymbol\\omega} \\times \\mathbf r' - 2\\boldsymbol\\omega \\times \\mathbf v' - \\boldsymbol\\omega \\times (\\boldsymbol\\omega \\times \\mathbf r') - \\mathbf A_0.</math>\n\nMultiplying through by the mass ''m'' gives\n\n: <math>\\mathbf F' = \\mathbf F_\\mathrm{physical} + \\mathbf F'_\\mathrm{Euler} + \\mathbf F'_\\mathrm{Coriolis} + \\mathbf F'_\\mathrm{centripetal} - m\\mathbf A_0,</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>\\mathbf F'_\\mathrm{Euler} = -m\\dot{\\boldsymbol\\omega} \\times \\mathbf r'</math> ([[Euler force]]),\n: <math>\\mathbf F'_\\mathrm{Coriolis} = -2m\\boldsymbol\\omega \\times \\mathbf v'</math> ([[Coriolis force]]),\n: <math>\\mathbf F'_\\mathrm{centrifugal} = -m\\boldsymbol\\omega \\times (\\boldsymbol\\omega \\times \\mathbf r') = m(\\omega^2 \\mathbf r' - (\\boldsymbol\\omega \\cdot \\mathbf r')\\boldsymbol\\omega)</math> ([[Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]]).\n\n== Particular frames of reference in common use ==\n* [[International Terrestrial Reference Frame]]\n* [[International Celestial Reference Frame]]\n* In fluid mechanics, [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field]]\n\n=== Other frames ===\n* [[Frame fields in general relativity]]\n* [[Linguistic frame of reference]]\n* [[Moving frame|Moving frame in mathematics]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Analytical mechanics]]\n* [[Applied mechanics]]\n* [[Cartesian coordinate system]]\n* [[Center-of-momentum frame]]\n* [[Centrifugal force]]\n* [[Centripetal force]]\n* [[Classical mechanics]]\n* [[Coriolis force]]\n* [[Curvilinear coordinates]]\n* [[Dynamics (physics)]]\n* [[Frenet\u2013Serret formulas]]\n* [[Galilean invariance]]\n* [[General relativity]]\n* [[Generalized coordinates]]\n* [[Generalized forces]]\n* [[Inertial frame of reference]]\n* [[Material frame-indifference]]\n* [[Rod and frame test]]\n* [[Kinematics]]\n* [[Laboratory frame of reference]]\n* [[Lorentz transformation]]\n* [[Mach's principle]]\n* [[Orthogonal coordinates]]\n* [[Principle of relativity]]\n* [[Quantum reference frame]]\n{{div end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Relativity}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Frames of reference| ]]\n[[Category:Theory of relativity]]\n[[Category:Geodesy]]\n[[Category:Navigation]]\n[[Category:Surveying]]\n[[Category:Astrometry]]\n", "name_user": "89.108.186.15", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference"}
