As on all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips ([[embouchure]]) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Unlike most other brass instruments, which have valves that, when pressed, alter the pitch of the instrument, trombones instead have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch. However, many modern trombone models ''also'' use a valve attachment to lower the pitch of the instrument. Variants such as the [[Types of trombones#Valve trombone|valve trombone]] and [[superbone]] have three valves similar to those on the trumpet.\n\nThe word \"trombone\" derives from Italian ''tromba'' (trumpet) and ''-one'' (a suffix meaning \"large\"), so the name means \"large trumpet\". The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like its valved counterpart, the [[Baritone horn|baritone]], in contrast to its conical valved counterparts: the [[cornet]], the [[euphonium]], and the [[French horn]]. The most frequently encountered trombones are the [[Types of trombones#Tenor trombone|tenor trombone]] and [[Types of trombones#Bass trombone|bass trombone]]. The most common variant, the tenor, is a non-transposing instrument pitched in B{{music|flat}}, an octave below the B{{music|flat}} trumpet and an octave above the pedal B{{music|flat}} tuba. The once common E{{music|flat}} [[Types of trombones#Alto trombone|alto trombone]] became less widely used as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor, but it is now resurging due to its lighter sonority which is appreciated in many classical and early romantic works. Trombone music is usually written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef, although exceptions do occur, notably in British brass-band music where the tenor trombone is presented as a B{{music|flat}} [[transposing instrument]], written in treble clef.\n\nA person who plays the trombone is called a trombonist or trombone player. <!--If you are here to change \"trombonist\" to something else, know that it is not at all original, and not all that funny. Don't be that guy.-->\n\n== Construction ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; caption: stuff; margin-right: 0; float: right\"\n|+ <big>Basic trombone anatomy</big>\n| [[File:Trombone-2.svg|120 px]]\n||\n# tuning slide\n# counterweight\n# mouthpiece\n# slide lock ring\n# bell\n# knob/bumper\n# water key/spit valve\n# main slide\n# second slide brace/stay\n# first slide brace/stay\n# bell lock nut\n|}\n\nThe trombone is a predominantly cylindrical tube bent into an elongated \"S\" shape. Rather than being completely cylindrical from end to end, the tube is a complex series of tapers with the smallest at the mouthpiece receiver and the largest just before the bell flare. The design of these tapers affects the intonation of the instrument. As with other [[brass instrument]]s, sound is produced by blowing air through pursed lips producing a vibration that creates a [[standing wave]] in the instrument.\n\nThe detachable cup-shaped [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]] is similar to that of the [[baritone horn]] and closely related to that of the [[trumpet]]. It has the [[Venturi effect|venturi]]:<ref name=\"Friedman\">{{cite web |last1=Friedman |first1=Jay |title=The German Trombone, by Jay Friedman |url=https://www.jayfriedman.net/articles/the_german_trombone |website=www.jayfriedman.net |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref> a small constriction of the air column that adds resistance greatly affecting the tone of the instrument and is inserted into the mouthpiece receiver in the slide section.  The slide section consists of a [[leadpipe]], the inner and outer slide tubes, and the bracing, or \"stays\". Modern stays are soldered, while [[sackbut]]s (medieval precursors to trombones) were made with loose, unsoldered stays.<ref name=\"Campbell2004\">{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Murray |last2=Greated|first2=Clive A. |last3=Myers|first3=Arnold|title=Musical Instruments: History, Technology, and Performance of Instruments of Western Music|url=https://archive.org/details/musicalinstrumen00dona|url-access=registration|accessdate=4 December 2018|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-816504-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/musicalinstrumen00dona/page/201 201]\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Fischer1984\">{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Henry George |title=The Renaissance Sackbut and Its Use Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IMVxu1y9O0C&pg=PA15|accessdate=4 December 2018|year=1984|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-87099-412-8|pages=15\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe 'slide', the most distinctive feature of the trombone (cf. [[Types of trombones#Valve trombone|valve trombone]]), allows the player to extend the length of the air column, lowering the pitch. To prevent friction from slowing the action of the slide, additional sleeves known as stockings were developed during the [[Renaissance]]. These \"stockings\" were soldered onto the ends of the inner slide tubes. Nowadays, the stockings are incorporated into the manufacturing process of the inner slide tubes and represent a fractional widening of the tube to accommodate the necessary method of alleviating friction. This part of the slide must be lubricated frequently. Additional tubing connects the slide to the bell of the instrument through a neckpipe, and bell or back bow (U-bend). The joint connecting the slide and bell sections is furnished with a threaded collar to secure the connection of the two parts of the instrument, though older models from the early 20th century and before were usually equipped with friction joints and no ancillary mechanism to tighten the joint.\n\nThe adjustment of intonation is most often accomplished with a short tuning slide between the neckpipe and the bell incorporating the bell bow (U-bend); this device was designed by the French maker Fran\u00e7ois Riedlocker during the early 19th century and applied to French and British designs and later in the century to German and American models, though German trombones were built without tuning slides well into the 20th century. However, trombonists, unlike other instrumentalists, are not subject to the intonation issues resulting from valved or keyed instruments, since they can adjust intonation \"on the fly\" by subtly altering slide [[Position (music)|positions]] when necessary. For example, second position \"A\" is not in exactly the same place on the slide as second position \"E\". Many [[types of trombones|types of trombone]] also include one or more [[rotary valves]] used to increase the length of the instrument (and therefore lower its pitch) by directing the air flow through additional tubing. This allows the instrument to reach notes that are otherwise not possible without the valve as well as play other notes in alternate positions.\n\nLike the trumpet, the trombone is considered a cylindrical bore instrument since it has extensive sections of tubing, principally in the slide section, that are of unchanging diameter. Tenor trombones typically have a bore of {{convert|0.450|in|mm}} (small bore) to {{convert|0.547|in|mm}} (large or ''orchestral'' bore) after the leadpipe and through the slide. The bore expands through the gooseneck to the bell, which is typically between {{convert|7|and|8+1/2|in|cm}}. A number of common variations on trombone construction are noted below.\n\n== History ==\n=== Etymology ===\n\"Trombone\" comes from the philadelphian word ''pizza'' (trumpet) plus the suffix ''-one'' (big), meaning \"big trumpet\".\n\nDuring the Renaissance, the equivalent English term was \"[[sackbut]]\". The word first appears in court records in 0511 as \"''shakbusshe''\" at about the time King Henry VII married a Portuguese princess who brought musicians with her. \"''Shakbusshe''\" is similar to \"''sacabuche''\", attested in Spain as early as 1478. The French equivalent \"''saqueboute''\" appears in 1466.<ref name=\"Michault\">{{cite web |last1=Michault |first1=Pierre |title=Le doctrinal du temps pr\u00e9sent , compil\u00e9 par maistre Pierre Michault, secr\u00e9taire du tr\u00e8s puissant duc de Bourgoingne |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k70431s/f17.item |website=gallica.bnf.fr |accessdate=4 December 2018 |page=16 |language=FR}}</ref>\n\nThe German \"''Posaune''\" long predates the invention of the slide and could refer to a natural trumpet as late as the early fifteenth century.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A History of the Trombone |last=Guion |first=David M. |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2010 |isbn=9780810874459 |location=Lanham, Maryland|page=22}}</ref>\n\n=== Origin ===\nBoth towns and courts sponsored bands of [[shawm]]s and trombone. The most famous and influential served the Duke of Burgundy. The trombone's principal role was the [[Countertenor|contratenor]] part in a dance band.<ref>Herbert (2006), p.&nbsp;59.</ref> The sackbut was used extensively across Europe, from its appearance in the 15th century to a decline in most places by the mid-late 17th century. It was used in outdoor events, in concert, and in liturgical settings. With trumpeters, trombonists in German city-states were employed as civil officials. As officials, these trombonists were often relegated to standing watch [[tower music|in the city towers]] but would also herald the arrival of important people to the city. This is similar to the role of a military bugler and was used as a sign of wealth and strength in 16th century German cities.\n\nHowever, these trombonists were often viewed separately from the more skilled trombonists who played in groups such as the [[alta capella]] wind ensembles and the first orchestral ensembles. These performed in religious settings, such as [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice in the early 17th century.<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=Helen |title=Defining the City 'Trumpeter': German Civic Identity and the Employment of Brass Instruments, c. 1500 |journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association |date=2011}}</ref>\n\nComposers who wrote for trombone during this period include [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]], [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] and his uncle [[Andrea Gabrieli]]. The trombone doubled voice parts in sacred works, but there are also solo pieces written for trombone in the early 17th century.\n\nWhen the sackbut returned to common use in England in the 18th century, Italian music was so influential that the instrument became known as the \"trombone\",<ref name=\"Guion\">{{cite book |last1=Guion |first1=David |title=The Trombone: Its History and Music, 1697\u20131811 |date=1988 |publisher=Gordon and Breach |isbn=2-88124-211-1 |page=3 |quote=Many modern musicians prefer to use the word 'sackbut' when referring to the Baroque trombone.

Italian [[:it:trombone|''trombone'']] and German [[:de:Posaune|''Posaune'']]. The 17th-century trombone was built in slightly smaller dimensions than modern trombones and had a bell that was more conical and less flared.\n\nDuring the later Baroque period, [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]] used trombones on a few occasions. Bach used it in some of his [[cantata]]s, having written for four trombones (with the rare [[soprano trombone]] playing the [[cantus firmus]], which would normally be played on cornett).{{Citation needed|date=August 2016|reason=Who says the c.f. was normally played by a cornet?}} Handel used it in the ''Death March'' from ''[[Saul (Handel)|Saul]]'', ''[[Samson (oratorio)|Samson]]'', and ''[[Israel in Egypt (oratorio)|Israel in Egypt]]''. All were examples of an [[oratorio]] style popular during the early 18th century. Score notations are rare because only a few professional \"Stadtpfeiffer\" or [[alta cappella]] musicians were available. Handel, for instance, had to import trombones to England from a Royal court in Hanover, Germany, to perform one of his larger compositions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Therefore, trombone parts were rather seldom given \"solo\" roles that were not interchangeable with other instruments.\n\n=== Classical period ===\n[[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] was the first major composer to use the trombone in an opera overture, ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]] ''(1767), but he also used it in operas such as ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'', ''[[Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride]] ''(1779) and ''[[Echo et Narcisse]]''.\n\nThe construction of the trombone changed relatively little between the Baroque and Classical period. The most obvious change was in the bell, slightly more flared.\n\nThe first use of the trombone as an independent instrument in a symphony was in the Symphony in E{{music|flat}} (1807) by Swedish composer [[Joachim Nicolas Eggert]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kallai |first1=Avishai |title=Biography of Joachim Nikolas Eggert |url=http://musicalics.com/fr/compositeur/Joachim-Nikolas-Eggert |website=Musicalics |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108151031/http://musicalics.com/fr/compositeur/Joachim-Nikolas-Eggert |archivedate=8 November 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> But the composer usually credited with the trombone's introduction into the symphony orchestra was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5 in C minor]] (1808). Beethoven also used trombones in his [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 6 in F major (\"Pastoral\")]] and [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9 (\"Choral\")]].\n\n=== Romantic period ===\n\n==== 19th-century orchestras ====\nTrombones were often included in compositions, operas, and symphonies by composers such as [[Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy|Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Berwald]], [[Charles Gounod]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Gioacchino Rossini]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], and [[Richard Wagner]] among others.\n\nAlthough the trombone trio had been paired with one or two cornets during the Renaissance and early Baroque periods, the disappearance of the cornet as a partner and replacement by oboe and clarinet left unchanged the trombone's purpose: to support the alto, tenor, and bass voices of the chorus (usually in ecclesiastical settings) where harmonic moving lines were more difficult to pick out than the melodic soprano line. But the introduction of trombones into the orchestra allied them more closely with trumpets, and soon an additional tenor trombone replaced alto. The Germans and Austrians kept alto trombone somewhat longer than the French, who preferred a section of three tenor trombones until after the [[Second World War]]. In other countries, the trio of two tenor trombones and one bass became standard by about the mid 19th century.\n\nTrombonists were employed less by cathedrals and court orchestras and so were expected to provide their own instrument. Military musicians were provided with instruments, and instruments like the long F or E{{music|flat}} bass trombone remained in military use until around the [[First World War]]. But orchestral musicians adopted the tenor trombone, the most versatile trombone that could play in the ranges of any of the three trombone parts that typically appeared in orchestral scores.{{vague|date=December 2018}}\n\nValve trombones in the mid-19th century did little to alter the make-up of the orchestral trombone section; although it was ousted from orchestras in Germany and France, the valve trombone remained popular almost to the exclusion of the slide instrument in countries such as Italy and [[Bohemia]]. Composers such as Giuseppe Verdi, [[Giacomo Puccini]], [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana]], and [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] scored for a valve trombone section.\n\n{{listen|type=music|title=Trombone solo|description=from [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Mahler's 3rd Symphony]], 1st movement (composed 1893\u20131896)\n|filename=Gustav Mahler - Trombone Solo from 3rd Symphony, 1st movement.ogg}}\n\nWith the [[ophicleide]] or later, the tuba subjoined to the trombone trio during the 19th century, parts scored for the bass trombone rarely descended as low as parts scored before the addition of either of these new low brass instruments.{{vague|date=December 2018}} Only in the early 20th century did it regain a degree of independence. Experiments with the trombone section included Richard Wagner's addition of a contrabass trombone in ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and Gustav Mahler's and Richard Strauss' augmentation by adding a second bass trombone to the usual trio of two tenor trombones and one bass trombone. The majority of orchestral works are still scored for the usual mid- to late-19th-century low brass section of two tenor trombones, one bass trombone, and one tuba.\n\n==== 19th-century wind bands ====\nTrombones have been a part of the large wind band since its inception as an ensemble during the French Revolution of 1791. During the 19th century wind band traditions were established, including  circus bands, military bands, brass bands (primarily in the UK), and town bands (primarily in the US). Some of these, especially military bands in Europe, used rear-facing trombones where the bell section pointed behind the player's left shoulder. These bands played a limited repertoire, with few original compositions, that consisted mainly of orchestral transcriptions, arrangements of popular and patriotic tunes, and feature pieces for soloists (usually cornetists, singers, and violinists). A notable work for wind band is Berlioz's 1840 [[Grande symphonie fun\u00e8bre et triomphale]], which uses a trombone solo for the entire second movement.\n\nToward the end of the 19th century, trombone virtuosi began appearing as soloists in American wind bands. The most notable was [[Arthur Pryor]], who played with the [[John Philip Sousa]] band and formed his own.\n\n==== 19th-century pedagogy ====\nIn the Romantic era, [[Leipzig]] became a center of trombone pedagogy. The trombone began to be taught at the [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig|Musikhochschule]] founded by [[Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy]]. The [[Paris Conservatory]] and its yearly exhibition also contributed to trombone education. At the Leipzig academy, Mendelssohn's bass trombonist, [[Karl Traugott Queisser]], was the first in a long line of distinguished professors of trombone. Several composers wrote works for Quiesser, including [[Ferdinand David (musician)|Ferdinand David]] (Mendelssohn's concertmaster) who wrote in 1837 the ''[[Trombone Concertino (David)|Concertino for Trombone and Orchestra]]'', Ernst Sachse and [[Friedrich August Belcke]], whose solo works remain popular in Germany. Queisser helped reestablish the reputation of the trombone in Germany. He championed and popularized Christian Friedrich Sattler's tenorbass trombone during the 1840s, leading to its widespread use in orchestras throughout Germany and Austria.\n\n==== 19th-century construction ====\nSattler had a great influence on trombone design. He introduced a significant widening of the bore (the most important since the Renaissance), the innovations of ''Schlangenverzierungen'' (snake decorations), the bell garland, and the wide bell flare\u2014features still found on German-made trombones that were widely copied during the 19th century.\n\nThe trombone was further improved in the 19th century with the addition of \"stockings\" at the end of the inner slide to reduce friction, the development of the water key to expel condensation from the horn, and the occasional addition of [[F attachment tenor trombone|a valve]] that, intentionally, only was to be set on or off but later was to become the regular F-valve. Additionally, the valve trombone came around the 1850s shortly after the invention of valves, and was in common use in Italy and Austria in the second half of the century.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\n{{listen|type=music|title=\"Miss Trombone\"\n|description=1908 ragtime by [[Henry Fillmore]]; played by The Indestructible Military Band\n|filename=Fillmore, Henry - Miss Trombone (1911).ogg}}\n\n==== 20th-century orchestras ====\nIn the [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] the trombone maintained its important place in the orchestra in works by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Edward Elgar]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Gustav Holst]], [[Leos Janacek]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Darius Milhaud]], [[Carl Nielsen]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Ottorino Respighi]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Jean Sibelius]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], and [[William Walton]].\n\nWith the rise of recorded music and music schools, orchestral trombone sections around the world began to have a more consistent idea of a standard trombone sound. British orchestras abandoned the use of small bore tenors and G basses in favor of an American/German approach of large bore tenors and B{{music|flat}} basses in the 1940s. French orchestras did the same in the 1960s.\n\n==== 20th-century wind bands ====\nDuring the first half of the century, touring and community concert bands lost their popularity in the United States and were greatly reduced in number. However, with the development of music education in the public school system, high school, and university concert bands and marching bands and became ubiquitous in the US. A typical concert band trombone section consists of two tenor trombones and one bass trombone, but using multiple players per part is common practice, especially in public-school settings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==== Use in jazz ====\n{{further|List of jazz trombonists}}\nIn the 1900s the trombone assisted the bass or tuba player's job of outlining chords for the other instruments by playing a bass line for the higher-pitched instruments to improvise over. It was not until the swing era of the mid-1920s that the trombone began to be used as a solo instrument. Examples of early trombone soloists are [[Jack Teagarden]] and [[J.J. Johnson]].<ref name=\"Bernotas\">{{cite web |last1=Bernotas |first1=Bob |title=Trombone |url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/trombone-by-bob-bernotas.php#.VERSjPBX-uY |website=All About Jazz |accessdate=4 December 2018 |date=7 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Wilken\">{{cite web |last1=Wilken |first1=David |title=The Historical Evolution of the Jazz Trombone: Part One |url=http://trombone.org/articles/library/evojazz1.asp |website=trombone.org |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== 20th-century construction ====\nChanges in construction have occurred during the 20th century, such as the use of different materials; increases in mouthpiece, bore, and bell dimensions; and in types of mutes and valves. Despite the universal switch to a larger horn, many European trombone makers prefer a slightly smaller bore than their American counterparts.\n\nOne of the most significant changes is the popularity of the F-Attachment trigger. Through the mid-20th century, orchestral trombonists used instruments that lacked a trigger because there was no need for one. But as 20th century composers such as Mahler became popular, tenor trombone parts began to extend down into lower ranges that required a trigger. Although some trombonists prefer \"straight\" trombone models without triggers, most have added them for convenience and versatility.\n\n=== Contemporary use ===\nThe trombone can be found in symphony orchestras, concert bands, marching bands, military bands, brass bands, and brass choirs. In chamber music, it is used in brass quintets, quartets, or trios, or trombone trios, quartets, or choirs. The size of a trombone choir can vary from five or six to twenty or more members. Trombones are also common in swing, jazz, merengue, salsa, R&B, [[ska]], and New Orleans brass bands.\n\n== Types ==\n{{Main|Types of trombone}}\n[[File:Detall de bucc\u00e9n.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The bell of a [[buccin]] (MDMB 369, 1800\u20131860) in the musical instrument collection of the [[Museu de la M\u00fasica de Barcelona]]]]\n\n[[File:Superbone.svg|thumb|250px|Superbone]]\n\nThe most frequently encountered type of trombone today is the tenor, followed by the bass, though as with many other Renaissance instruments the trombone has been built in sizes from piccolo to contrabass. Trombones are usually constructed with a slide that is used to change the pitch. [[Valve trombone]]s use three valves (singly or in combination) instead of the slide. The valves follow the same schema as other valved instruments-the first valve lowers the pitch by one step, the second valve by a half-step, and the third valve by one and a half steps.\n\nA [[superbone]] uses a full set of valves ''and'' a slide. These differ from trombones with triggers. Some slide trombones have one or (less frequently) two rotary valves operated by a left-hand thumb trigger. The single rotary valve is part of the ''F attachment'', which adds a length of tubing to lower the instrument's fundamental pitch from B{{music|flat}} to F. Some bass trombones have a second trigger with a different length of tubing. The second trigger facilitates playing the otherwise problematic low B. A [[buccin]] is a trombone with a round, zoomorphic bell section. They were common in 19th-century military bands.\n\n== Technique ==\n\n=== Basic slide positions ===\n[[File:Wirth trombone slide position chart.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Slide position chart (new system); most trombones are tenor trombones, like the valveless one in the middle.]]\n\nThe modern system has seven chromatic [[Position (music)#Trombone position|slide positions]] on a tenor trombone in B{{music|b}}. It was first described by Andre Braun circa 1795.<ref name=\"Weiner\">{{cite journal |last1=Weiner |first1=H. |title=Andr\u00e9 Braun's Gamme et M\u00e9thode pour les Trombonnes: The Earliest Modern Trombone Method Rediscovered |journal=Historic Brass Society Journal |date=1993 |pages=288\u2013308}}</ref>\n\nIn 1811 Joseph Fr\u00f6hlich wrote on the differences between the modern system and an old system where four diatonic slide positions were used and the trombone was usually keyed to A.<ref name=\"Guion 93\">Guion (1988), p. 93.</ref> To compare between the two styles the chart below may be helpful (take note for example, in the old system contemporary 1st-position was considered \"drawn past\" then current 1st).<ref name=\"Guion 93\" /> In the modern system, each successive position outward (approximately {{convert|3+1/4|in|cm|0|disp=sqbr}}) will produce a note which is one [[semitone]] lower when played in the same [[harmonic series (music)#partial|partial]]. Tightening and loosening the lips will allow the player to \"bend\" the note up or down by a semitone without changing position, so a slightly out-of-position slide may be compensated for by ear.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | New system\n| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Old system\n| \u2013 || 1 || \u2013 || 2 || \u2013 || 3 || 4\n|}\n\n=== Partials and intonation ===\n[[File:Trombone first position harmonic series.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone first position harmonic series, \"where additional overtones may be used to stretch the upper range a bit higher.\"<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />]]\n[[File:Trombone seventh position harmonic series.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone seventh position harmonic series.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />]]\n\nAs with all brass instruments, progressive tightening of the lips and increased air pressure allow the player to move to different [[harmonic series (music)#partial|partial]] in the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. In the first position (also called closed position) on a B{{music|flat}} trombone, the notes in the harmonic series begin with B{{music|flat}}<sub>2</sub> (one octave higher than the pedal B{{music|flat}}<sub>1</sub>), F<sub>3</sub> (a [[perfect fifth]] higher than the previous partial), B{{music|flat}}<sub>3</sub> (a [[perfect fourth]] higher), D<sub>4</sub> (a [[major third]] higher), and F<sub>4</sub> (a [[minor third]] higher).\n\nF<sub>4</sub> marks the sixth partial, or the fifth overtone. Notes on the next partial, for example A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> (a minor third higher) in first position, tend to be out of tune in regards to the twelve-tone [[equal temperament]] scale. A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> in particular, which is at the seventh partial (sixth overtone) is nearly always 31 cents, or about one third of a semitone, flat of the minor seventh.  On the slide trombone, such deviations from [[intonation (music)|intonation]] are corrected for by slightly adjusting the slide or by using an alternate position.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" /> Although much of Western music has adopted the even-tempered scale, it has been the practice in Germany and Austria to play these notes in position, where they will have [[just intonation]] (see [[harmonic seventh]] as well for A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub>).\n\nThe next higher partials\u2014B{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> (a [[major second]] higher), C<sub>5</sub> (a major second higher), D<sub>5</sub> (a major second higher)\u2014do not require much adjustment for even-tempered intonation, but E{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> (a [[minor second]] higher) is almost exactly a [[quarter tone]] higher than it would be in twelve-tone equal temperament. E{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> and F<sub>5</sub> (a major second higher) at the next partial are very high notes; a very skilled player with a highly developed [[Embouchure|facial musculature]] and [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] can go even higher to G<sub>5</sub>, A{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub>, B{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> and beyond.\n\n[[File:Trombone F slide position pedal tones.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone with F attachment slide position second harmonics.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />]]\n\nThe higher in the harmonic series any two successive notes are, the closer they tend to be (as evidenced by the progressively smaller intervals noted above).  A byproduct of this is the relatively few motions needed to move between notes in the higher ranges of the trombone. In the lower range, significant movement of the slide is required between positions, which becomes more exaggerated on lower pitched trombones, but for higher notes the player need only use the first four positions of the slide since the partials are closer together, allowing higher notes in alternate positions. As an example, F<sub>4</sub> (at the bottom of the treble clef) may be played in first, fourth or sixth position on a B{{music|flat}} trombone. The note E<sub>1</sub> (or the lowest E on a standard 88-key piano keyboard) is the lowest attainable note on a {{convert|9|ft|adj=on}} B{{music|flat}} tenor trombone, requiring a full {{convert|2.24|m|order=flip}} of tubing. On trombones without an F attachment, there is a gap between B{{music|flat}}<sub>1</sub> (the fundamental in first position) and E<sub>2</sub> (the first harmonic in seventh position). Skilled players can produce \"[[Falset (music)|falset]]\" notes between these, but the sound is relatively weak and not usually used in performance. The addition of an F attachment allows for intermediate notes to be played with more clarity.\n\n=== Pedal tones ===\n[[File:Trombone slide position pedal tones.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone slide position \"pedal tones\".<ref name=\"Orchestration\">{{cite book |last1=Kennan |first1=Kent |last2=Grantham |first2=Donald |title=The Technique of Orchestration |date=2002 |isbn=0-13-040771-2 |pages=148\u2013149}}</ref>]]\n\nThe [[pedal tone]] on B{{music|flat}} is frequently seen in commercial scoring but much less often in symphonic music while notes below that are called for only rarely as they \"become increasingly difficult to produce and insecure in quality\" with A{{music|flat}} or G being the bottom limit for most tenor trombonists.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" /> Some contemporary orchestral writing, movie or video game scoring, trombone ensemble and solo works will call for notes as low as a pedal C, B, or even double pedal B{{music|flat}} on the bass trombone.\n\n=== Glissando === <!--[[False glissando]], etc., redirect directly here.-->\nThe trombone is one of the few wind instruments that can produce a true [[glissando]], by moving the slide without interrupting the airflow or sound production. Every pitch in a glissando must have the same harmonic number, and a tritone is the largest interval that can be performed as a glissando.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />{{rp|151}}\n\n'Harmonic', 'inverted', 'broken' or 'false' glissandos are those that cross one or more harmonic series, requiring a simulated or faked glissando effect.<ref name=\"Herbert 40\">{{cite book |last1=Herbert |first1=Trevor |title=The Trombone |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-10095-7 |page=40}}</ref>\n\n=== Trills ===\n[[Trill (music)|Trills]], though generally simple with valves, are difficult on the slide trombone. Trills tend to be easiest and most effective higher in the harmonic series because the distance between notes is much smaller and slide movement is minimal. For example, a trill on B{{music|b}}<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>4</sub> is virtually impossible as the slide must move two positions (either 1st-to-3rd or 5th-to-3rd), however at an octave higher (B{{music|b}}<sub>4</sub>/C<sub>5</sub>) the notes can both be achieved in 1st position as a lip trill. Thus, the most convincing trills tend to be above the first octave and a half of the tenor's [[range (music)|range]].<ref>Herbert (2006), p. 43.</ref> Trills are most commonly found in early Baroque and Classical music for the trombone as a means of ornamentation, however, some more modern pieces will call for trills as well.\n\n=== Notation ===\nUnlike most other brass instruments in an orchestral setting, the trombone is not usually considered a [[transposing instrument]]. Prior to the invention of valve systems, most brass instruments were limited to playing one overtone series at a time; altering the pitch of the instrument required manually replacing a section of tubing (called a \"[[Crook (music)|crook]]\") or picking up an instrument of different length. Their parts were transposed according to which crook or length-of-instrument they used at any given time, so that a particular note on the staff always corresponded to a particular partial on the instrument. Trombones, on the other hand, have used slides since their inception. As such, they have always been fully chromatic, so no such tradition took hold, and trombone parts have always been notated at concert pitch (with one exception, discussed below). Also, it was quite common for trombones to double choir parts; reading in concert pitch meant there was no need for dedicated trombone parts. Note that while the fundamental sounding pitch (slide fully retracted) has remained quite consistent, the conceptual pitch of trombones has changed since their origin (''e.g.'' Baroque A tenor = modern B-flat tenor).<ref name=\"Palm\">{{cite web |last1=Palm |first1=Paul W. |title=Baroque Solo and Homogeneous Ensemble Trombone Repertoire: A Lecture Recital Supporting and Demonstrating Performance at a Pitch Standard Derived from Primary Sources and Extant Instruments |url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/listing.aspx?id=4343 |accessdate=1 October 2019 |language=EN}}</ref>\n\nTrombone parts are typically notated in [[bass clef]], though sometimes also written in [[tenor clef]] or [[alto clef]]. The use of alto clef is usually confined to orchestral first trombone parts, with the second trombone part written in tenor clef and the third (bass) part in bass clef. As the alto trombone declined in popularity during the 19th century, this practice was gradually abandoned and first trombone parts came to be notated in the tenor or bass clef. Some Russian and Eastern European composers wrote first and second tenor trombone parts on one alto clef staff (the German [[Robert Schumann]] was the first to do this). Examples of this practice are evident in scores by Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich. Trombone parts in band music are nearly exclusively notated in bass clef. The rare exceptions are in contemporary works intended for high-level wind bands.\n\nAn accomplished performer today is expected to be proficient in reading parts notated in bass clef, tenor clef, alto clef, and (more rarely) treble clef in C, with the British brass-band performer expected to handle treble clef in B{{music|flat}} as well.\n\n=== Mutes ===\n[[File:Trombone Plunger.jpg|thumb|175px|A plunger in use]]\nA variety of [[Whispa mute|mutes]] can be used with the trombone to alter its [[timbre]]. Many are held in place with the use of cork grips, including the straight, cup, harmon and pixie mutes. Some fit over the bell, like the bucket mute. In addition to this, mutes can be held in front of the bell and moved to cover more or less area for a [[Wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]] effect. Mutes used in this way include the \"hat\" (a metal mute shaped like a bowler hat) and plunger (which looks like, and often is, the rubber suction cup from a sink or [[plunger|toilet plunger]]), a sound featured as the voices of adults in the ''[[Peanuts]]'' cartoons.\n\n== Variations in construction ==\n\n=== Bells ===\nTrombone bells (and sometimes slides) may be constructed of different brass mixtures. The most common material is yellow brass (70% copper, 30% zinc), but other materials include rose brass (85% copper, 15% zinc) and red brass (90% copper, 10% zinc). Some manufacturers offer interchangeable bells. Tenor trombone bells are usually between {{convert|7|and(-)|9|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, the most common being sizes from {{convert|7+1/2|to(-)|8+1/2|in|cm|abbr=on}}. The smallest sizes are found in small jazz trombones and older narrow-bore instruments, while the larger sizes are common in orchestral models. Bass trombone bells can be as large as {{convert|10+1/2|in|cm|abbr=on}} or more, though usually either {{convert|9+1/2|or|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter. The bell may be constructed out of two separate brass sheets or out of one single piece of metal and hammered on a mandrel until the part is shaped correctly. The edge of the bell may be finished with or without a piece of bell wire to secure it, which also affects the tone quality; most bells are built with bell wire. Occasionally, trombone bells are made from solid sterling silver.\n\n=== Valve attachments ===\nMany trombones have valve attachments to aid in increasing the range of the instrument while also allowing alternate slide positions for difficult music passages. In addition, valve attachments make [[Trill (music)|trills]] much easier. Valve attachments appear on alto, tenor, bass, and contrabass trombones. It is rare on the alto, but when the instrument does have it, the valve attachment changes the key of the instrument from E{{Music|flat}} to B{{Music|flat}}, allowing the alto trombone to play in the tenor trombone range. Tenor trombones commonly have valve attachments, the most common being the [[F attachment|F-attachment]], which changes the pitch of the instrument from B{{Music|flat}} to F, increasing the range of the instrument downward and allowing alternate slide positions for notes in 6th or 7th position.\n\nBass trombones also very commonly have F-attachments, which serve exactly the same function as on the tenor trombone. Some single valve bass trombones have E-attachments instead of F-attachments, or sometimes there is extra tubing on the F-attachment to allow it to be used as an E-attachment if desired. However, many bass trombones have a second valve attachment instead, which increases their range downward even more. The most common second valve attachment is the G{{Music|flat}}-attachment, which changes the instrument's key to D when used in combination with the F-attachment (or D{{Music|flat}} if used with the less common E-attachment). There are other configurations other than the G{{Music|flat}}-attachment however.\n\nThe two valves on a bass trombone can either be independent or dependent. Double rotor dependent valve bass trombones were created in the late 1950s, and double rotor independent valve bass trombones were created in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Dependent means that the second valve only works when used in combination with the first, as it is located directly on the F- or E-attachment tubing. Newer bass trombones have independent (in-line) valves instead, meaning that the second valve is located on the neckpipe of the instrument and can therefore operate independently of the other.<ref>[http://www.yeodoug.com/resources/faq/faq_text/valves.html Douglas Yeo FAQ: Bass Trombone Valve Systems<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Contrabass trombones also can have valve attachments. Contrabass trombones in the key of F typically have two valves tuned to C and D{{Music|flat}} respectively. Contrabass trombones in B{{Music|flat}} on the other hand typically only have one valve, which is tuned to F, though some have a second valve tuned to G{{Music|flat}}.\n\nThe most common type of valve seen for valve attachments is the [[rotary valve]]. Some trombones have [[piston valves]] used instead of rotary valves for valve attachments, but it is very rare and is today considered unconventional. Many variations of the rotary valve have been invented in the past half-century such as the [[Thayer valve]] or axial-flow valve, the [[Hagmann valve]], the Greenhoe rotor, and several others, all of which were designed to give the trombone a more open, free sound than a conventional rotary valve would allow due to the 90\u00b0 bend in most conventional rotary valve designs. Many of these new trombone valve designs have enjoyed great success on the market, but the standard rotary valve remains the most common for trombone valve attachments.\n{{Gallery\n|title=Valve attachments\n|File:Thayer valve.jpg|The Thayer valve is an advanced, conically shaped rotary valve that has become very popular in recent trombone design due to the open air flow it allows. The Thayer valve bends the air flowing through the trombone as little as 25 degrees.\n|File:HagmannValve.jpg|The Hagmann valve is a rotary valve variation that has become popular in recent years. It was invented following the Thayer valve as a response to maintenance issues of the Thayer valve.\n|File:TriggerTrombone.jpg|The standard rotary valve, like the one seen on this tenor trombone, is the most common valve type seen on slide trombones today.\n}}\n\n==== Valves ====\nSome trombones have valves instead of a slide (see [[Types of trombones#Valve trombone|valve trombone]]). These are usually [[rotary valve]]s, or [[piston valve]]s.\n{{Gallery\n|title=Valves\n|File:Valvetrombonephoto.jpg|A valve trombone\n|File:Trombone a six pistons-IMG 0853-black.jpg|A military 6-valve trombone, by Adolphe Sax. Paris, 1866\n}}\n\n==== Tubing ====\nMore often than not, tenor trombones with an [[Types of trombones#F attachment|F attachment]], or trigger, have a larger bore through the attachment than through the 'straight' section (the portion of the trombone through which the air flows when the attachment is not engaged). Typically, for orchestral instruments, the slide bore is {{convert|0.547|in|mm|abbr=on}} and the attachment tubing bore is {{convert|0.562|in|mm|abbr=on}}. A wide variety of valve attachments and combinations are available. Valve attachment tubing usually incorporates a small tuning slide so that the attachment tubing can be tuned separately from the rest of the instrument. Most B{{music|flat}}/F tenor and bass trombones include a tuning slide long enough to lower the pitch to E with the valve tubing engaged, enabling the production of B<sub>2</sub>.\n[[File:Yamaha Trombone comparison of open and traditional wrap.jpg|thumb|Open wrap (left) and traditional wrap (right) F attachments]]\nWhereas older instruments fitted with valve attachments usually had the tubing coiled rather tightly in the bell section (''closed wrap '' or ''traditional wrap''), modern instruments usually have the tubing kept as free as possible of tight bends in the tubing (''open wrap''), resulting in a freer response with the valve attachment tubing engaged. While open-wrap tubing does offer a more open sound, the tubing sticks out from behind the bell and is more vulnerable to damage. For that reason, closed-wrap tubing remains more popular in trombones used in marching bands or other ensembles where the trombone may be more prone to damage.\n\n=== Tuning ===\nSome trombones are tuned through a mechanism in the slide section rather than via a separate tuning slide in the bell section. This method preserves a smoother expansion from the start of the bell section to the bell flare. The tuning slide in the bell section requires two portions of cylindrical tubing in an otherwise conical part of the instrument, which affects the tone quality. Tuning the trombone enables it to play with other instruments which is essential for the trombone.\n\n=== Slides ===\nCommon and popular bore sizes for trombone slides are {{convert|0.500|,|0.508|,|0.525|and|0.547|in|mm|abbr=on}} for tenor trombones, and {{convert|0.562|in|mm|abbr=on}} for bass trombones. The slide may also be built with a ''dual-bore'' configuration, in which the bore of the second leg of the slide is slightly larger than the bore of the first leg, producing a stepwise conical effect. The most common dual-bore combinations are {{convert|0.481|\u2013|0.491|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.500|\u2013|0.508|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.508|\u2013|0.525|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.525|\u2013|0.547|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.547|\u2013|0.562|in|mm|abbr=on}} for tenor trombones, and {{convert|0.562|\u2013|0.578|in|mm|abbr=on}} for bass trombones.\n\n=== Mouthpiece ===\n[[File:Schilke 51C4 Trombone Mouthpiece.jpg|thumb|right|A tenor trombone mouthpiece]]\nThe mouthpiece is a separate part of the trombone and can be interchanged between similarly sized trombones from different manufacturers. Available mouthpieces for trombone (as with all brass instruments) vary in material composition, length, diameter, rim shape, cup depth, throat entrance, venturi aperture, venturi profile, outside design and other factors. Variations in mouthpiece construction affect the individual player's ability to make a lip seal and produce a reliable tone, the [[timbre]] of that tone, its [[Loudness|volume]], the instrument's [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] tendencies, the player's subjective level of comfort, and the instrument's playability in a given pitch range.\n\nMouthpiece selection is a highly personal decision. Thus, a symphonic trombonist might prefer a mouthpiece with a deeper cup and sharper inner rim shape in order to produce a rich symphonic tone quality, while a [[jazz]] trombonist might choose a shallower cup for brighter tone and easier production of higher notes. Further, for certain compositions, these choices between two such performers could easily be reversed. Some mouthpiece makers now offer mouthpieces that feature removable rims, cups, and shanks allowing players to further customize and adjust their mouthpieces to their preference.\n\n=== Plastic ===\n[[File:The Trombone Show (color).JPG|thumb|upright|Quartet with plastic trombones]]\nInstruments made mostly from plastic, including the pBone and the Tromba plastic trombone, emerged in the 2010s as a cheaper and more robust alternative to brass.<ref name=\"pBone\">{{cite web|last1=Flynn|first1=Mike|title=pBone plastic trombone|url=http://www.jazzwisemagazine.com/pages/jazz-instrument-reviews/71-brass/12744-pbone-plastic-trombone|website=Jazzwise Magazine|accessdate=16 October 2016|date=20 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/read/korg-uk-takes-on-distribution-of-tromba/017677|date = 2 May 2013|title = Korg UK takes on distribution of Tromba|accessdate = 12 July 2013|website = Musical Instrument Professional|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130505114137/http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/read/korg-uk-takes-on-distribution-of-tromba/017677|archive-date = 5 May 2013|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Plastic instruments could come in almost any colour but the sound plastic instruments produce is different from that of brass. While originally seen as a gimmick, these plastic models have found increasing popularity of the last decade and are now viewed as practice tools that make for more convenient travel as well as a cheaper option for beginning players not wishing to invest so much money in a trombone right away. Manufacturers now produce large-bore models with triggers as well as smaller alto models.\n\n=== Regional variations ===\n\n==== Germany and Austria ====\nGerman trombones have been built in a wide variety of bore and bell sizes. The traditional German ''Konzertposaune'' can differ substantially from American designs in many aspects. The mouthpiece is typically rather small and is placed into a slide section with a very long leadpipe of at least {{convert|12|to(-)|24|in|cm|-1}}. The whole instrument is often made of gold brass, and its sound is usually darker compared with British, French or American designs. While their bore sizes were considered large in the 19th century, German trombones have altered very little over the last 150 years and are now typically somewhat smaller than their American counterparts. Bell sizes remain very large in all sizes of German trombone and a bass trombone bell may exceed {{convert|10|in|cm}} in diameter.\n\nValve attachments in tenor and bass trombones were first seen in the mid 19th century, originally on the tenor B{{Music|flat}} trombone. Before 1850, bass trombone parts were mostly played on a slightly longer F-bass trombone (a fourth lower). The first valve was simply a fourth-valve, or in German \"Quart-ventil\", built onto a B{{Music|flat}} tenor trombone, to allow playing in low F. This valve was first built without a return spring, and was only intended to set the instrument in B{{Music|flat}} or F for extended passages.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Since the mid-20th century, modern instruments use a trigger to engage the valve while playing.\n\nAs with other German and Austrian brass instruments, rotary valves are used to the exclusion of almost all other types of valve, even in valve trombones. Other features often found on German trombones include long [[water key]]s and snake decorations on the slide and bell U-bows.\n\nSince around 1925, when jazz music became popular, Germany has been selling \"American trombones\" as well. Most trombones played in Germany today, especially by amateurs, are built in the American fashion, as those are much more widely available, and thus far cheaper.\n\n==== France ====\nFrench trombones were built in the very smallest bore sizes up to the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and whilst other sizes were made there, the French usually preferred the tenor trombone to any other size. French music, therefore, usually employed a section of three tenor trombones up to the mid\u201320th century. Tenor trombones produced in France during the 19th and early 20th centuries featured bore sizes of around {{convert|0.450|in|mm|abbr=on}}, small bells of not more than {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, as well as a funnel-shaped mouthpiece slightly larger than that of the [[cornet]] or [[French horn|horn]]. French tenor trombones were built in both C and B{{music|flat}}, altos in D{{music|flat}}, sopranos in F, piccolos in high B{{music|flat}}, basses in G and E{{music|flat}}, contrabasses in B{{music|flat}}.\n\n== Didactics ==\nSeveral makers have begun to market compact B{{music|flat}}/C trombones that are especially well suited for young children learning to play the trombone who cannot reach the outer slide positions of full-length instruments. The fundamental note of the unenhanced length is C, but the short valved attachment that puts the instrument in B{{music|flat}} is ''open'' when the trigger is ''not'' depressed. While such instruments have no seventh slide position, C and B natural may be comfortably accessed on the first and second positions by using the trigger. A similar design (\"Preacher model\") was marketed by [[C.G. Conn]] in the 1920s, also under the [[Wurlitzer]] label. Currently, B{{music|flat}}/C trombones are available from many manufacturers, including German makers G\u00fcnter Frost, Thein and Helmut Voigt, as well as the [[Yamaha Corporation]].<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090428193549/https://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/ContentDetail/ModelSeriesDetail.html?CNTID=2265&CTID=242600 Yamaha Catalog YSL-350C] with ascending Bb/C rotor</ref>\n\n== Manufacturers ==\nTrombones in slide and valve configuration have been made by a vast array of musical instrument manufacturers. For the brass bands of the late 19th and early 20th century, prominent American manufacturers included Graves and Sons, E. G. Wright and Company, [[Boston Musical Instrument Company]], [[E. A. Couturier]], [[King Musical Instruments|H. N. White Company/King Musical Instruments]], [[James Warren York|J. W. York]], and [[C.G. Conn]]. In the 21st century, leading mainstream manufacturers of trombones include [[Vincent Bach Corporation|Vincent Bach]], [[C.G.

As on all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips ([[embouchure]]) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Unlike most other brass instruments, which have valves that, when pressed, alter the pitch of the instrument, trombones instead have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch. However, many modern trombone models ''also'' use a valve attachment to lower the pitch of the instrument. Variants such as the [[Types of trombones#Valve trombone|valve trombone]] and [[superbone]] have three valves similar to those on the trumpet.\n\nThe word \"trombone\" derives from Italian ''tromba'' (trumpet) and ''-one'' (a suffix meaning \"large\"), so the name means \"large trumpet\". The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like its valved counterpart, the [[Baritone horn|baritone]], in contrast to its conical valved counterparts: the [[cornet]], the [[euphonium]], and the [[French horn]]. The most frequently encountered trombones are the [[Types of trombones#Tenor trombone|tenor trombone]] and [[Types of trombones#Bass trombone|bass trombone]]. The most common variant, the tenor, is a non-transposing instrument pitched in B{{music|flat}}, an octave below the B{{music|flat}} trumpet and an octave above the pedal B{{music|flat}} tuba. The once common E{{music|flat}} [[Types of trombones#Alto trombone|alto trombone]] became less widely used as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor, but it is now resurging due to its lighter sonority which is appreciated in many classical and early romantic works. Trombone music is usually written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef, although exceptions do occur, notably in British brass-band music where the tenor trombone is presented as a B{{music|flat}} [[transposing instrument]], written in treble clef.\n\nA person who plays the trombone is called a trombonist or trombone player. <!--If you are here to change \"trombonist\" to something else, know that it is not at all original, and not all that funny. Don't be that guy.-->\n\n== Construction ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; caption: stuff; margin-right: 0; float: right\"\n|+ <big>Basic trombone anatomy</big>\n| [[File:Trombone-2.svg|120 px]]\n||\n# tuning slide\n# counterweight\n# mouthpiece\n# slide lock ring\n# bell\n# knob/bumper\n# water key/spit valve\n# main slide\n# second slide brace/stay\n# first slide brace/stay\n# bell lock nut\n|}\n\nThe trombone is a predominantly cylindrical tube bent into an elongated \"S\" shape. Rather than being completely cylindrical from end to end, the tube is a complex series of tapers with the smallest at the mouthpiece receiver and the largest just before the bell flare. The design of these tapers affects the intonation of the instrument. As with other [[brass instrument]]s, sound is produced by blowing air through pursed lips producing a vibration that creates a [[standing wave]] in the instrument.\n\nThe detachable cup-shaped [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]] is similar to that of the [[baritone horn]] and closely related to that of the [[trumpet]]. It has the [[Venturi effect|venturi]]:<ref name=\"Friedman\">{{cite web |last1=Friedman |first1=Jay |title=The German Trombone, by Jay Friedman |url=https://www.jayfriedman.net/articles/the_german_trombone |website=www.jayfriedman.net |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref> a small constriction of the air column that adds resistance greatly affecting the tone of the instrument and is inserted into the mouthpiece receiver in the slide section.  The slide section consists of a [[leadpipe]], the inner and outer slide tubes, and the bracing, or \"stays\". Modern stays are soldered, while [[sackbut]]s (medieval precursors to trombones) were made with loose, unsoldered stays.<ref name=\"Campbell2004\">{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Murray |last2=Greated|first2=Clive A. |last3=Myers|first3=Arnold|title=Musical Instruments: History, Technology, and Performance of Instruments of Western Music|url=https://archive.org/details/musicalinstrumen00dona|url-access=registration|accessdate=4 December 2018|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-816504-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/musicalinstrumen00dona/page/201 201]\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Fischer1984\">{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Henry George |title=The Renaissance Sackbut and Its Use Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IMVxu1y9O0C&pg=PA15|accessdate=4 December 2018|year=1984|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-87099-412-8|pages=15\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe 'slide', the most distinctive feature of the trombone (cf. [[Types of trombones#Valve trombone|valve trombone]]), allows the player to extend the length of the air column, lowering the pitch. To prevent friction from slowing the action of the slide, additional sleeves known as stockings were developed during the [[Renaissance]]. These \"stockings\" were soldered onto the ends of the inner slide tubes. Nowadays, the stockings are incorporated into the manufacturing process of the inner slide tubes and represent a fractional widening of the tube to accommodate the necessary method of alleviating friction. This part of the slide must be lubricated frequently. Additional tubing connects the slide to the bell of the instrument through a neckpipe, and bell or back bow (U-bend). The joint connecting the slide and bell sections is furnished with a threaded collar to secure the connection of the two parts of the instrument, though older models from the early 20th century and before were usually equipped with friction joints and no ancillary mechanism to tighten the joint.\n\nThe adjustment of intonation is most often accomplished with a short tuning slide between the neckpipe and the bell incorporating the bell bow (U-bend); this device was designed by the French maker Fran\u00e7ois Riedlocker during the early 19th century and applied to French and British designs and later in the century to German and American models, though German trombones were built without tuning slides well into the 20th century. However, trombonists, unlike other instrumentalists, are not subject to the intonation issues resulting from valved or keyed instruments, since they can adjust intonation \"on the fly\" by subtly altering slide [[Position (music)|positions]] when necessary. For example, second position \"A\" is not in exactly the same place on the slide as second position \"E\". Many [[types of trombones|types of trombone]] also include one or more [[rotary valves]] used to increase the length of the instrument (and therefore lower its pitch) by directing the air flow through additional tubing. This allows the instrument to reach notes that are otherwise not possible without the valve as well as play other notes in alternate positions.\n\nLike the trumpet, the trombone is considered a cylindrical bore instrument since it has extensive sections of tubing, principally in the slide section, that are of unchanging diameter. Tenor trombones typically have a bore of {{convert|0.450|in|mm}} (small bore) to {{convert|0.547|in|mm}} (large or ''orchestral'' bore) after the leadpipe and through the slide. The bore expands through the gooseneck to the bell, which is typically between {{convert|7|and|8+1/2|in|cm}}. A number of common variations on trombone construction are noted below.\n\n== History ==\n=== Etymology ===\n\"Trombone\" comes from the Italian word ''tromba'' (trumpet) plus the suffix ''-one'' (big), meaning \"big trumpet\".\n\nDuring the Renaissance, the equivalent English term was \"[[sackbut]]\". The word first appears in court records in 1495 as \"''shakbusshe''\" at about the time King Henry VII married a Portuguese princess who brought musicians with her. \"''Shakbusshe''\" is similar to \"''sacabuche''\", attested in Spain as early as 1478. The French equivalent \"''saqueboute''\" appears in 1466.<ref name=\"Michault\">{{cite web |last1=Michault |first1=Pierre |title=Le doctrinal du temps pr\u00e9sent , compil\u00e9 par maistre Pierre Michault, secr\u00e9taire du tr\u00e8s puissant duc de Bourgoingne |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k70431s/f17.item |website=gallica.bnf.fr |accessdate=4 December 2018 |page=16 |language=FR}}</ref>\n\nThe German \"''Posaune''\" long predates the invention of the slide and could refer to a natural trumpet as late as the early fifteenth century.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A History of the Trombone |last=Guion |first=David M. |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2010 |isbn=9780810874459 |location=Lanham, Maryland|page=22}}</ref>\n\n=== Origin ===\nBoth towns and courts sponsored bands of [[shawm]]s and trombone.

The trombone's principal role was the [[Countertenor|contratenor]] part in a dance band.<ref>Herbert (2006), p.&nbsp;59.</ref> The sackbut was used extensively across Europe, from its appearance in the 15th century to a decline in most places by the mid-late 17th century. It was used in outdoor events, in concert, and in liturgical settings. With trumpeters, trombonists in German city-states were employed as civil officials. As officials, these trombonists were often relegated to standing watch [[tower music|in the city towers]] but would also herald the arrival of important people to the city. This is similar to the role of a military bugler and was used as a sign of wealth and strength in 16th century German cities.\n\nHowever, these trombonists were often viewed separately from the more skilled trombonists who played in groups such as the [[alta capella]] wind ensembles and the first orchestral ensembles. These performed in religious settings, such as [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice in the early 17th century.<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=Helen |title=Defining the City 'Trumpeter': German Civic Identity and the Employment of Brass Instruments, c. 1500 |journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association |date=2011}}</ref>\n\nComposers who wrote for trombone during this period include [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]], [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] and his uncle [[Andrea Gabrieli]]. The trombone doubled voice parts in sacred works, but there are also solo pieces written for trombone in the early 17th century.\n\nWhen the sackbut returned to common use in England in the 18th century, Italian music was so influential that the instrument became known as the \"trombone\",<ref name=\"Guion\">{{cite book |last1=Guion |first1=David |title=The Trombone: Its History and Music, 1697\u20131811 |date=1988 |publisher=Gordon and Breach |isbn=2-88124-211-1 |page=3 |quote=Many modern musicians prefer to use the word 'sackbut' when referring to the Baroque trombone.

Italian [[:it:trombone|''trombone'']] and German [[:de:Posaune|''Posaune'']]. The 17th-century trombone was built in slightly smaller dimensions than modern trombones and had a bell that was more conical and less flared.\n\nDuring the later Baroque period, [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]] used trombones on a few occasions. Bach used it in some of his [[cantata]]s, having written for four trombones (with the rare [[soprano trombone]] playing the [[cantus firmus]], which would normally be played on cornett).{{Citation needed|date=August 2016|reason=Who says the c.f. was normally played by a cornet?}} Handel used it in the ''Death March'' from ''[[Saul (Handel)|Saul]]'', ''[[Samson (oratorio)|Samson]]'', and ''[[Israel in Egypt (oratorio)|Israel in Egypt]]''. All were examples of an [[oratorio]] style popular during the early 18th century. Score notations are rare because only a few professional \"Stadtpfeiffer\" or [[alta cappella]] musicians were available. Handel, for instance, had to import trombones to England from a Royal court in Hanover, Germany, to perform one of his larger compositions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Therefore, trombone parts were rather seldom given \"solo\" roles that were not interchangeable with other instruments.\n\n=== Classical period ===\n[[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] was the first major composer to use the trombone in an opera overture, ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]] ''(1767), but he also used it in operas such as ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'', ''[[Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride]] ''(1779) and ''[[Echo et Narcisse]]''.\n\nThe construction of the trombone changed relatively little between the Baroque and Classical period. The most obvious change was in the bell, slightly more flared.\n\nThe first use of the trombone as an independent instrument in a symphony was in the Symphony in E{{music|flat}} (1807) by Swedish composer [[Joachim Nicolas Eggert]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kallai |first1=Avishai |title=Biography of Joachim Nikolas Eggert |url=http://musicalics.com/fr/compositeur/Joachim-Nikolas-Eggert |website=Musicalics |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108151031/http://musicalics.com/fr/compositeur/Joachim-Nikolas-Eggert |archivedate=8 November 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> But the composer usually credited with the trombone's introduction into the symphony orchestra was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5 in C minor]] (1808). Beethoven also used trombones in his [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 6 in F major (\"Pastoral\")]] and [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9 (\"Choral\")]].\n\n=== Romantic period ===\n\n==== 19th-century orchestras ====\nTrombones were often included in compositions, operas, and symphonies by composers such as [[Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy|Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Berwald]], [[Charles Gounod]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Gioacchino Rossini]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], and [[Richard Wagner]] among others.\n\nAlthough the trombone trio had been paired with one or two cornets during the Renaissance and early Baroque periods, the disappearance of the cornet as a partner and replacement by oboe and clarinet left unchanged the trombone's purpose: to support the alto, tenor, and bass voices of the chorus (usually in ecclesiastical settings) where harmonic moving lines were more difficult to pick out than the melodic soprano line. But the introduction of trombones into the orchestra allied them more closely with trumpets, and soon an additional tenor trombone replaced alto. The Germans and Austrians kept alto trombone somewhat longer than the French, who preferred a section of three tenor trombones until after the [[Second World War]]. In other countries, the trio of two tenor trombones and one bass became standard by about the mid 19th century.\n\nTrombonists were employed less by cathedrals and court orchestras and so were expected to provide their own instrument. Military musicians were provided with instruments, and instruments like the long F or E{{music|flat}} bass trombone remained in military use until around the [[First World War]]. But orchestral musicians adopted the tenor trombone, the most versatile trombone that could play in the ranges of any of the three trombone parts that typically appeared in orchestral scores.{{vague|date=December 2018}}\n\nValve trombones in the mid-19th century did little to alter the make-up of the orchestral trombone section; although it was ousted from orchestras in Germany and France, the valve trombone remained popular almost to the exclusion of the slide instrument in countries such as Italy and [[Bohemia]]. Composers such as Giuseppe Verdi, [[Giacomo Puccini]], [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana]], and [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] scored for a valve trombone section.\n\n{{listen|type=music|title=Trombone solo|description=from [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Mahler's 3rd Symphony]], 1st movement (composed 1893\u20131896)\n|filename=Gustav Mahler - Trombone Solo from 3rd Symphony, 1st movement.ogg}}\n\nWith the [[ophicleide]] or later, the tuba subjoined to the trombone trio during the 19th century, parts scored for the bass trombone rarely descended as low as parts scored before the addition of either of these new low brass instruments.{{vague|date=December 2018}} Only in the early 20th century did it regain a degree of independence. Experiments with the trombone section included Richard Wagner's addition of a contrabass trombone in ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and Gustav Mahler's and Richard Strauss' augmentation by adding a second bass trombone to the usual trio of two tenor trombones and one bass trombone. The majority of orchestral works are still scored for the usual mid- to late-19th-century low brass section of two tenor trombones, one bass trombone, and one tuba.\n\n==== 19th-century wind bands ====\nTrombones have been a part of the large wind band since its inception as an ensemble during the French Revolution of 1791. During the 19th century wind band traditions were established, including  circus bands, military bands, brass bands (primarily in the UK), and town bands (primarily in the US). Some of these, especially military bands in Europe, used rear-facing trombones where the bell section pointed behind the player's left shoulder. These bands played a limited repertoire, with few original compositions, that consisted mainly of orchestral transcriptions, arrangements of popular and patriotic tunes, and feature pieces for soloists (usually cornetists, singers, and violinists). A notable work for wind band is Berlioz's 1840 [[Grande symphonie fun\u00e8bre et triomphale]], which uses a trombone solo for the entire second movement.\n\nToward the end of the 19th century, trombone virtuosi began appearing as soloists in American wind bands. The most notable was [[Arthur Pryor]], who played with the [[John Philip Sousa]] band and formed his own.\n\n==== 19th-century pedagogy ====\nIn the Romantic era, [[Leipzig]] became a center of trombone pedagogy. The trombone began to be taught at the [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig|Musikhochschule]] founded by [[Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy]]. The [[Paris Conservatory]] and its yearly exhibition also contributed to trombone education. At the Leipzig academy, Mendelssohn's bass trombonist, [[Karl Traugott Queisser]], was the first in a long line of distinguished professors of trombone. Several composers wrote works for Quiesser, including [[Ferdinand David (musician)|Ferdinand David]] (Mendelssohn's concertmaster) who wrote in 1837 the ''[[Trombone Concertino (David)|Concertino for Trombone and Orchestra]]'', Ernst Sachse and [[Friedrich August Belcke]], whose solo works remain popular in Germany. Queisser helped reestablish the reputation of the trombone in Germany. He championed and popularized Christian Friedrich Sattler's tenorbass trombone during the 1840s, leading to its widespread use in orchestras throughout Germany and Austria.\n\n==== 19th-century construction ====\nSattler had a great influence on trombone design. He introduced a significant widening of the bore (the most important since the Renaissance), the innovations of ''Schlangenverzierungen'' (snake decorations), the bell garland, and the wide bell flare\u2014features still found on German-made trombones that were widely copied during the 19th century.\n\nThe trombone was further improved in the 19th century with the addition of \"stockings\" at the end of the inner slide to reduce friction, the development of the water key to expel condensation from the horn, and the occasional addition of [[F attachment tenor trombone|a valve]] that, intentionally, only was to be set on or off but later was to become the regular F-valve. Additionally, the valve trombone came around the 1850s shortly after the invention of valves, and was in common use in Italy and Austria in the second half of the century.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\n{{listen|type=music|title=\"Miss Trombone\"\n|description=1908 ragtime by [[Henry Fillmore]]; played by The Indestructible Military Band\n|filename=Fillmore, Henry - Miss Trombone (1911).ogg}}\n\n==== 20th-century orchestras ====\nIn the [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] the trombone maintained its important place in the orchestra in works by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Edward Elgar]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Gustav Holst]], [[Leos Janacek]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Darius Milhaud]], [[Carl Nielsen]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Ottorino Respighi]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Jean Sibelius]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], and [[William Walton]].\n\nWith the rise of recorded music and music schools, orchestral trombone sections around the world began to have a more consistent idea of a standard trombone sound. British orchestras abandoned the use of small bore tenors and G basses in favor of an American/German approach of large bore tenors and B{{music|flat}} basses in the 1940s. French orchestras did the same in the 1960s.\n\n==== 20th-century wind bands ====\nDuring the first half of the century, touring and community concert bands lost their popularity in the United States and were greatly reduced in number. However, with the development of music education in the public school system, high school, and university concert bands and marching bands and became ubiquitous in the US. A typical concert band trombone section consists of two tenor trombones and one bass trombone, but using multiple players per part is common practice, especially in public-school settings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==== Use in jazz ====\n{{further|List of jazz trombonists}}\nIn the 1900s the trombone assisted the bass or tuba player's job of outlining chords for the other instruments by playing a bass line for the higher-pitched instruments to improvise over. It was not until the swing era of the mid-1920s that the trombone began to be used as a solo instrument. Examples of early trombone soloists are [[Jack Teagarden]] and [[J.J. Johnson]].<ref name=\"Bernotas\">{{cite web |last1=Bernotas |first1=Bob |title=Trombone |url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/trombone-by-bob-bernotas.php#.VERSjPBX-uY |website=All About Jazz |accessdate=4 December 2018 |date=7 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Wilken\">{{cite web |last1=Wilken |first1=David |title=The Historical Evolution of the Jazz Trombone: Part One |url=http://trombone.org/articles/library/evojazz1.asp |website=trombone.org |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== 20th-century construction ====\nChanges in construction have occurred during the 20th century, such as the use of different materials; increases in mouthpiece, bore, and bell dimensions; and in types of mutes and valves. Despite the universal switch to a larger horn, many European trombone makers prefer a slightly smaller bore than their American counterparts.\n\nOne of the most significant changes is the popularity of the F-Attachment trigger. Through the mid-20th century, orchestral trombonists used instruments that lacked a trigger because there was no need for one. But as 20th century composers such as Mahler became popular, tenor trombone parts began to extend down into lower ranges that required a trigger. Although some trombonists prefer \"straight\" trombone models without triggers, most have added them for convenience and versatility.\n\n=== Contemporary use ===\nThe trombone can be found in symphony orchestras, concert bands, marching bands, military bands, brass bands, and brass choirs. In chamber music, it is used in brass quintets, quartets, or trios, or trombone trios, quartets, or choirs. The size of a trombone choir can vary from five or six to twenty or more members. Trombones are also common in swing, jazz, merengue, salsa, R&B, [[ska]], and New Orleans brass bands.\n\n== Types ==\n{{Main|Types of trombone}}\n[[File:Detall de bucc\u00e9n.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The bell of a [[buccin]] (MDMB 369, 1800\u20131860) in the musical instrument collection of the [[Museu de la M\u00fasica de Barcelona]]]]\n\n[[File:Superbone.svg|thumb|250px|Superbone]]\n\nThe most frequently encountered type of trombone today is the tenor, followed by the bass, though as with many other Renaissance instruments the trombone has been built in sizes from piccolo to contrabass. Trombones are usually constructed with a slide that is used to change the pitch. [[Valve trombone]]s use three valves (singly or in combination) instead of the slide. The valves follow the same schema as other valved instruments-the first valve lowers the pitch by one step, the second valve by a half-step, and the third valve by one and a half steps.\n\nA [[superbone]] uses a full set of valves ''and'' a slide. These differ from trombones with triggers. Some slide trombones have one or (less frequently) two rotary valves operated by a left-hand thumb trigger. The single rotary valve is part of the ''F attachment'', which adds a length of tubing to lower the instrument's fundamental pitch from B{{music|flat}} to F. Some bass trombones have a second trigger with a different length of tubing. The second trigger facilitates playing the otherwise problematic low B. A [[buccin]] is a trombone with a round, zoomorphic bell section. They were common in 19th-century military bands.\n\n== Technique ==\n\n=== Basic slide positions ===\n[[File:Wirth trombone slide position chart.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Slide position chart (new system); most trombones are tenor trombones, like the valveless one in the middle.]]\n\nThe modern system has seven chromatic [[Position (music)#Trombone position|slide positions]] on a tenor trombone in B{{music|b}}. It was first described by Andre Braun circa 1795.<ref name=\"Weiner\">{{cite journal |last1=Weiner |first1=H. |title=Andr\u00e9 Braun's Gamme et M\u00e9thode pour les Trombonnes: The Earliest Modern Trombone Method Rediscovered |journal=Historic Brass Society Journal |date=1993 |pages=288\u2013308}}</ref>\n\nIn 1811 Joseph Fr\u00f6hlich wrote on the differences between the modern system and an old system where four diatonic slide positions were used and the trombone was usually keyed to A.<ref name=\"Guion 93\">Guion (1988), p. 93.</ref> To compare between the two styles the chart below may be helpful (take note for example, in the old system contemporary 1st-position was considered \"drawn past\" then current 1st).<ref name=\"Guion 93\" /> In the modern system, each successive position outward (approximately {{convert|3+1/4|in|cm|0|disp=sqbr}}) will produce a note which is one [[semitone]] lower when played in the same [[harmonic series (music)#partial|partial]]. Tightening and loosening the lips will allow the player to \"bend\" the note up or down by a semitone without changing position, so a slightly out-of-position slide may be compensated for by ear.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | New system\n| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Old system\n| \u2013 || 1 || \u2013 || 2 || \u2013 || 3 || 4\n|}\n\n=== Partials and intonation ===\n[[File:Trombone first position harmonic series.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone first position harmonic series, \"where additional overtones may be used to stretch the upper range a bit higher.\"<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />]]\n[[File:Trombone seventh position harmonic series.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone seventh position harmonic series.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />]]\n\nAs with all brass instruments, progressive tightening of the lips and increased air pressure allow the player to move to different [[harmonic series (music)#partial|partial]] in the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. In the first position (also called closed position) on a B{{music|flat}} trombone, the notes in the harmonic series begin with B{{music|flat}}<sub>2</sub> (one octave higher than the pedal B{{music|flat}}<sub>1</sub>), F<sub>3</sub> (a [[perfect fifth]] higher than the previous partial), B{{music|flat}}<sub>3</sub> (a [[perfect fourth]] higher), D<sub>4</sub> (a [[major third]] higher), and F<sub>4</sub> (a [[minor third]] higher).\n\nF<sub>4</sub> marks the sixth partial, or the fifth overtone. Notes on the next partial, for example A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> (a minor third higher) in first position, tend to be out of tune in regards to the twelve-tone [[equal temperament]] scale. A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> in particular, which is at the seventh partial (sixth overtone) is nearly always 31 cents, or about one third of a semitone, flat of the minor seventh.  On the slide trombone, such deviations from [[intonation (music)|intonation]] are corrected for by slightly adjusting the slide or by using an alternate position.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" /> Although much of Western music has adopted the even-tempered scale, it has been the practice in Germany and Austria to play these notes in position, where they will have [[just intonation]] (see [[harmonic seventh]] as well for A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub>).\n\nThe next higher partials\u2014B{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> (a [[major second]] higher), C<sub>5</sub> (a major second higher), D<sub>5</sub> (a major second higher)\u2014do not require much adjustment for even-tempered intonation, but E{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> (a [[minor second]] higher) is almost exactly a [[quarter tone]] higher than it would be in twelve-tone equal temperament. E{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> and F<sub>5</sub> (a major second higher) at the next partial are very high notes; a very skilled player with a highly developed [[Embouchure|facial musculature]] and [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] can go even higher to G<sub>5</sub>, A{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub>, B{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> and beyond.\n\n[[File:Trombone F slide position pedal tones.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone with F attachment slide position second harmonics.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />]]\n\nThe higher in the harmonic series any two successive notes are, the closer they tend to be (as evidenced by the progressively smaller intervals noted above).  A byproduct of this is the relatively few motions needed to move between notes in the higher ranges of the trombone. In the lower range, significant movement of the slide is required between positions, which becomes more exaggerated on lower pitched trombones, but for higher notes the player need only use the first four positions of the slide since the partials are closer together, allowing higher notes in alternate positions. As an example, F<sub>4</sub> (at the bottom of the treble clef) may be played in first, fourth or sixth position on a B{{music|flat}} trombone. The note E<sub>1</sub> (or the lowest E on a standard 88-key piano keyboard) is the lowest attainable note on a {{convert|9|ft|adj=on}} B{{music|flat}} tenor trombone, requiring a full {{convert|2.24|m|order=flip}} of tubing. On trombones without an F attachment, there is a gap between B{{music|flat}}<sub>1</sub> (the fundamental in first position) and E<sub>2</sub> (the first harmonic in seventh position). Skilled players can produce \"[[Falset (music)|falset]]\" notes between these, but the sound is relatively weak and not usually used in performance. The addition of an F attachment allows for intermediate notes to be played with more clarity.\n\n=== Pedal tones ===\n[[File:Trombone slide position pedal tones.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone slide position \"pedal tones\".<ref name=\"Orchestration\">{{cite book |last1=Kennan |first1=Kent |last2=Grantham |first2=Donald |title=The Technique of Orchestration |date=2002 |isbn=0-13-040771-2 |pages=148\u2013149}}</ref>]]\n\nThe [[pedal tone]] on B{{music|flat}} is frequently seen in commercial scoring but much less often in symphonic music while notes below that are called for only rarely as they \"become increasingly difficult to produce and insecure in quality\" with A{{music|flat}} or G being the bottom limit for most tenor trombonists.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" /> Some contemporary orchestral writing, movie or video game scoring, trombone ensemble and solo works will call for notes as low as a pedal C, B, or even double pedal B{{music|flat}} on the bass trombone.\n\n=== Glissando === <!--[[False glissando]], etc., redirect directly here.-->\nThe trombone is one of the few wind instruments that can produce a true [[glissando]], by moving the slide without interrupting the airflow or sound production. Every pitch in a glissando must have the same harmonic number, and a tritone is the largest interval that can be performed as a glissando.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />{{rp|151}}\n\n'Harmonic', 'inverted', 'broken' or 'false' glissandos are those that cross one or more harmonic series, requiring a simulated or faked glissando effect.<ref name=\"Herbert 40\">{{cite book |last1=Herbert |first1=Trevor |title=The Trombone |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-10095-7 |page=40}}</ref>\n\n=== Trills ===\n[[Trill (music)|Trills]], though generally simple with valves, are difficult on the slide trombone. Trills tend to be easiest and most effective higher in the harmonic series because the distance between notes is much smaller and slide movement is minimal. For example, a trill on B{{music|b}}<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>4</sub> is virtually impossible as the slide must move two positions (either 1st-to-3rd or 5th-to-3rd), however at an octave higher (B{{music|b}}<sub>4</sub>/C<sub>5</sub>) the notes can both be achieved in 1st position as a lip trill. Thus, the most convincing trills tend to be above the first octave and a half of the tenor's [[range (music)|range]].<ref>Herbert (2006), p. 43.</ref> Trills are most commonly found in early Baroque and Classical music for the trombone as a means of ornamentation, however, some more modern pieces will call for trills as well.\n\n=== Notation ===\nUnlike most other brass instruments in an orchestral setting, the trombone is not usually considered a [[transposing instrument]]. Prior to the invention of valve systems, most brass instruments were limited to playing one overtone series at a time; altering the pitch of the instrument required manually replacing a section of tubing (called a \"[[Crook (music)|crook]]\") or picking up an instrument of different length. Their parts were transposed according to which crook or length-of-instrument they used at any given time, so that a particular note on the staff always corresponded to a particular partial on the instrument. Trombones, on the other hand, have used slides since their inception. As such, they have always been fully chromatic, so no such tradition took hold, and trombone parts have always been notated at concert pitch (with one exception, discussed below). Also, it was quite common for trombones to double choir parts; reading in concert pitch meant there was no need for dedicated trombone parts. Note that while the fundamental sounding pitch (slide fully retracted) has remained quite consistent, the conceptual pitch of trombones has changed since their origin (''e.g.'' Baroque A tenor = modern B-flat tenor).<ref name=\"Palm\">{{cite web |last1=Palm |first1=Paul W. |title=Baroque Solo and Homogeneous Ensemble Trombone Repertoire: A Lecture Recital Supporting and Demonstrating Performance at a Pitch Standard Derived from Primary Sources and Extant Instruments |url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/listing.aspx?id=4343 |accessdate=1 October 2019 |language=EN}}</ref>\n\nTrombone parts are typically notated in [[bass clef]], though sometimes also written in [[tenor clef]] or [[alto clef]]. The use of alto clef is usually confined to orchestral first trombone parts, with the second trombone part written in tenor clef and the third (bass) part in bass clef. As the alto trombone declined in popularity during the 19th century, this practice was gradually abandoned and first trombone parts came to be notated in the tenor or bass clef. Some Russian and Eastern European composers wrote first and second tenor trombone parts on one alto clef staff (the German [[Robert Schumann]] was the first to do this). Examples of this practice are evident in scores by Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich. Trombone parts in band music are nearly exclusively notated in bass clef. The rare exceptions are in contemporary works intended for high-level wind bands.\n\nAn accomplished performer today is expected to be proficient in reading parts notated in bass clef, tenor clef, alto clef, and (more rarely) treble clef in C, with the British brass-band performer expected to handle treble clef in B{{music|flat}} as well.\n\n=== Mutes ===\n[[File:Trombone Plunger.jpg|thumb|175px|A plunger in use]]\nA variety of [[Whispa mute|mutes]] can be used with the trombone to alter its [[timbre]]. Many are held in place with the use of cork grips, including the straight, cup, harmon and pixie mutes. Some fit over the bell, like the bucket mute. In addition to this, mutes can be held in front of the bell and moved to cover more or less area for a [[Wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]] effect. Mutes used in this way include the \"hat\" (a metal mute shaped like a bowler hat) and plunger (which looks like, and often is, the rubber suction cup from a sink or [[plunger|toilet plunger]]), a sound featured as the voices of adults in the ''[[Peanuts]]'' cartoons.\n\n== Variations in construction ==\n\n=== Bells ===\nTrombone bells (and sometimes slides) may be constructed of different brass mixtures. The most common material is yellow brass (70% copper, 30% zinc), but other materials include rose brass (85% copper, 15% zinc) and red brass (90% copper, 10% zinc). Some manufacturers offer interchangeable bells. Tenor trombone bells are usually between {{convert|7|and(-)|9|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, the most common being sizes from {{convert|7+1/2|to(-)|8+1/2|in|cm|abbr=on}}. The smallest sizes are found in small jazz trombones and older narrow-bore instruments, while the larger sizes are common in orchestral models. Bass trombone bells can be as large as {{convert|10+1/2|in|cm|abbr=on}} or more, though usually either {{convert|9+1/2|or|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter. The bell may be constructed out of two separate brass sheets or out of one single piece of metal and hammered on a mandrel until the part is shaped correctly. The edge of the bell may be finished with or without a piece of bell wire to secure it, which also affects the tone quality; most bells are built with bell wire. Occasionally, trombone bells are made from solid sterling silver.\n\n=== Valve attachments ===\nMany trombones have valve attachments to aid in increasing the range of the instrument while also allowing alternate slide positions for difficult music passages. In addition, valve attachments make [[Trill (music)|trills]] much easier. Valve attachments appear on alto, tenor, bass, and contrabass trombones. It is rare on the alto, but when the instrument does have it, the valve attachment changes the key of the instrument from E{{Music|flat}} to B{{Music|flat}}, allowing the alto trombone to play in the tenor trombone range. Tenor trombones commonly have valve attachments, the most common being the [[F attachment|F-attachment]], which changes the pitch of the instrument from B{{Music|flat}} to F, increasing the range of the instrument downward and allowing alternate slide positions for notes in 6th or 7th position.\n\nBass trombones also very commonly have F-attachments, which serve exactly the same function as on the tenor trombone. Some single valve bass trombones have E-attachments instead of F-attachments, or sometimes there is extra tubing on the F-attachment to allow it to be used as an E-attachment if desired. However, many bass trombones have a second valve attachment instead, which increases their range downward even more. The most common second valve attachment is the G{{Music|flat}}-attachment, which changes the instrument's key to D when used in combination with the F-attachment (or D{{Music|flat}} if used with the less common E-attachment). There are other configurations other than the G{{Music|flat}}-attachment however.\n\nThe two valves on a bass trombone can either be independent or dependent. Double rotor dependent valve bass trombones were created in the late 1950s, and double rotor independent valve bass trombones were created in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Dependent means that the second valve only works when used in combination with the first, as it is located directly on the F- or E-attachment tubing. Newer bass trombones have independent (in-line) valves instead, meaning that the second valve is located on the neckpipe of the instrument and can therefore operate independently of the other.<ref>[http://www.yeodoug.com/resources/faq/faq_text/valves.html Douglas Yeo FAQ: Bass Trombone Valve Systems<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Contrabass trombones also can have valve attachments. Contrabass trombones in the key of F typically have two valves tuned to C and D{{Music|flat}} respectively. Contrabass trombones in B{{Music|flat}} on the other hand typically only have one valve, which is tuned to F, though some have a second valve tuned to G{{Music|flat}}.\n\nThe most common type of valve seen for valve attachments is the [[rotary valve]]. Some trombones have [[piston valves]] used instead of rotary valves for valve attachments, but it is very rare and is today considered unconventional. Many variations of the rotary valve have been invented in the past half-century such as the [[Thayer valve]] or axial-flow valve, the [[Hagmann valve]], the Greenhoe rotor, and several others, all of which were designed to give the trombone a more open, free sound than a conventional rotary valve would allow due to the 90\u00b0 bend in most conventional rotary valve designs. Many of these new trombone valve designs have enjoyed great success on the market, but the standard rotary valve remains the most common for trombone valve attachments.\n{{Gallery\n|title=Valve attachments\n|File:Thayer valve.jpg|The Thayer valve is an advanced, conically shaped rotary valve that has become very popular in recent trombone design due to the open air flow it allows. The Thayer valve bends the air flowing through the trombone as little as 25 degrees.\n|File:HagmannValve.jpg|The Hagmann valve is a rotary valve variation that has become popular in recent years. It was invented following the Thayer valve as a response to maintenance issues of the Thayer valve.\n|File:TriggerTrombone.jpg|The standard rotary valve, like the one seen on this tenor trombone, is the most common valve type seen on slide trombones today.\n}}\n\n==== Valves ====\nSome trombones have valves instead of a slide (see [[Types of trombones#Valve trombone|valve trombone]]). These are usually [[rotary valve]]s, or [[piston valve]]s.\n{{Gallery\n|title=Valves\n|File:Valvetrombonephoto.jpg|A valve trombone\n|File:Trombone a six pistons-IMG 0853-black.jpg|A military 6-valve trombone, by Adolphe Sax. Paris, 1866\n}}\n\n==== Tubing ====\nMore often than not, tenor trombones with an [[Types of trombones#F attachment|F attachment]], or trigger, have a larger bore through the attachment than through the 'straight' section (the portion of the trombone through which the air flows when the attachment is not engaged). Typically, for orchestral instruments, the slide bore is {{convert|0.547|in|mm|abbr=on}} and the attachment tubing bore is {{convert|0.562|in|mm|abbr=on}}. A wide variety of valve attachments and combinations are available. Valve attachment tubing usually incorporates a small tuning slide so that the attachment tubing can be tuned separately from the rest of the instrument. Most B{{music|flat}}/F tenor and bass trombones include a tuning slide long enough to lower the pitch to E with the valve tubing engaged, enabling the production of B<sub>2</sub>.\n[[File:Yamaha Trombone comparison of open and traditional wrap.jpg|thumb|Open wrap (left) and traditional wrap (right) F attachments]]\nWhereas older instruments fitted with valve attachments usually had the tubing coiled rather tightly in the bell section (''closed wrap '' or ''traditional wrap''), modern instruments usually have the tubing kept as free as possible of tight bends in the tubing (''open wrap''), resulting in a freer response with the valve attachment tubing engaged. While open-wrap tubing does offer a more open sound, the tubing sticks out from behind the bell and is more vulnerable to damage. For that reason, closed-wrap tubing remains more popular in trombones used in marching bands or other ensembles where the trombone may be more prone to damage.\n\n=== Tuning ===\nSome trombones are tuned through a mechanism in the slide section rather than via a separate tuning slide in the bell section. This method preserves a smoother expansion from the start of the bell section to the bell flare. The tuning slide in the bell section requires two portions of cylindrical tubing in an otherwise conical part of the instrument, which affects the tone quality. Tuning the trombone enables it to play with other instruments which is essential for the trombone.\n\n=== Slides ===\nCommon and popular bore sizes for trombone slides are {{convert|0.500|,|0.508|,|0.525|and|0.547|in|mm|abbr=on}} for tenor trombones, and {{convert|0.562|in|mm|abbr=on}} for bass trombones. The slide may also be built with a ''dual-bore'' configuration, in which the bore of the second leg of the slide is slightly larger than the bore of the first leg, producing a stepwise conical effect. The most common dual-bore combinations are {{convert|0.481|\u2013|0.491|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.500|\u2013|0.508|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.508|\u2013|0.525|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.525|\u2013|0.547|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.547|\u2013|0.562|in|mm|abbr=on}} for tenor trombones, and {{convert|0.562|\u2013|0.578|in|mm|abbr=on}} for bass trombones.\n\n=== Mouthpiece ===\n[[File:Schilke 51C4 Trombone Mouthpiece.jpg|thumb|right|A tenor trombone mouthpiece]]\nThe mouthpiece is a separate part of the trombone and can be interchanged between similarly sized trombones from different manufacturers. Available mouthpieces for trombone (as with all brass instruments) vary in material composition, length, diameter, rim shape, cup depth, throat entrance, venturi aperture, venturi profile, outside design and other factors. Variations in mouthpiece construction affect the individual player's ability to make a lip seal and produce a reliable tone, the [[timbre]] of that tone, its [[Loudness|volume]], the instrument's [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] tendencies, the player's subjective level of comfort, and the instrument's playability in a given pitch range.\n\nMouthpiece selection is a highly personal decision. Thus, a symphonic trombonist might prefer a mouthpiece with a deeper cup and sharper inner rim shape in order to produce a rich symphonic tone quality, while a [[jazz]] trombonist might choose a shallower cup for brighter tone and easier production of higher notes. Further, for certain compositions, these choices between two such performers could easily be reversed. Some mouthpiece makers now offer mouthpieces that feature removable rims, cups, and shanks allowing players to further customize and adjust their mouthpieces to their preference.\n\n=== Plastic ===\n[[File:The Trombone Show (color).JPG|thumb|upright|Quartet with plastic trombones]]\nInstruments made mostly from plastic, including the pBone and the Tromba plastic trombone, emerged in the 2010s as a cheaper and more robust alternative to brass.<ref name=\"pBone\">{{cite web|last1=Flynn|first1=Mike|title=pBone plastic trombone|url=http://www.jazzwisemagazine.com/pages/jazz-instrument-reviews/71-brass/12744-pbone-plastic-trombone|website=Jazzwise Magazine|accessdate=16 October 2016|date=20 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/read/korg-uk-takes-on-distribution-of-tromba/017677|date = 2 May 2013|title = Korg UK takes on distribution of Tromba|accessdate = 12 July 2013|website = Musical Instrument Professional|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130505114137/http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/read/korg-uk-takes-on-distribution-of-tromba/017677|archive-date = 5 May 2013|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Plastic instruments could come in almost any colour but the sound plastic instruments produce is different from that of brass. While originally seen as a gimmick, these plastic models have found increasing popularity of the last decade and are now viewed as practice tools that make for more convenient travel as well as a cheaper option for beginning players not wishing to invest so much money in a trombone right away. Manufacturers now produce large-bore models with triggers as well as smaller alto models.\n\n=== Regional variations ===\n\n==== Germany and Austria ====\nGerman trombones have been built in a wide variety of bore and bell sizes. The traditional German ''Konzertposaune'' can differ substantially from American designs in many aspects. The mouthpiece is typically rather small and is placed into a slide section with a very long leadpipe of at least {{convert|12|to(-)|24|in|cm|-1}}. The whole instrument is often made of gold brass, and its sound is usually darker compared with British, French or American designs. While their bore sizes were considered large in the 19th century, German trombones have altered very little over the last 150 years and are now typically somewhat smaller than their American counterparts. Bell sizes remain very large in all sizes of German trombone and a bass trombone bell may exceed {{convert|10|in|cm}} in diameter.\n\nValve attachments in tenor and bass trombones were first seen in the mid 19th century, originally on the tenor B{{Music|flat}} trombone. Before 1850, bass trombone parts were mostly played on a slightly longer F-bass trombone (a fourth lower). The first valve was simply a fourth-valve, or in German \"Quart-ventil\", built onto a B{{Music|flat}} tenor trombone, to allow playing in low F. This valve was first built without a return spring, and was only intended to set the instrument in B{{Music|flat}} or F for extended passages.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Since the mid-20th century, modern instruments use a trigger to engage the valve while playing.\n\nAs with other German and Austrian brass instruments, rotary valves are used to the exclusion of almost all other types of valve, even in valve trombones. Other features often found on German trombones include long [[water key]]s and snake decorations on the slide and bell U-bows.\n\nSince around 1925, when jazz music became popular, Germany has been selling \"American trombones\" as well. Most trombones played in Germany today, especially by amateurs, are built in the American fashion, as those are much more widely available, and thus far cheaper.\n\n==== France ====\nFrench trombones were built in the very smallest bore sizes up to the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and whilst other sizes were made there, the French usually preferred the tenor trombone to any other size. French music, therefore, usually employed a section of three tenor trombones up to the mid\u201320th century. Tenor trombones produced in France during the 19th and early 20th centuries featured bore sizes of around {{convert|0.450|in|mm|abbr=on}}, small bells of not more than {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, as well as a funnel-shaped mouthpiece slightly larger than that of the [[cornet]] or [[French horn|horn]]. French tenor trombones were built in both C and B{{music|flat}}, altos in D{{music|flat}}, sopranos in F, piccolos in high B{{music|flat}}, basses in G and E{{music|flat}}, contrabasses in B{{music|flat}}.\n\n== Didactics ==\nSeveral makers have begun to market compact B{{music|flat}}/C trombones that are especially well suited for young children learning to play the trombone who cannot reach the outer slide positions of full-length instruments. The fundamental note of the unenhanced length is C, but the short valved attachment that puts the instrument in B{{music|flat}} is ''open'' when the trigger is ''not'' depressed. While such instruments have no seventh slide position, C and B natural may be comfortably accessed on the first and second positions by using the trigger. A similar design (\"Preacher model\") was marketed by [[C.G. Conn]] in the 1920s, also under the [[Wurlitzer]] label. Currently, B{{music|flat}}/C trombones are available from many manufacturers, including German makers G\u00fcnter Frost, Thein and Helmut Voigt, as well as the [[Yamaha Corporation]].<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090428193549/https://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/ContentDetail/ModelSeriesDetail.html?CNTID=2265&CTID=242600 Yamaha Catalog YSL-350C] with ascending Bb/C rotor</ref>\n\n== Manufacturers ==\nTrombones in slide and valve configuration have been made by a vast array of musical instrument manufacturers. For the brass bands of the late 19th and early 20th century, prominent American manufacturers included Graves and Sons, E. G. Wright and Company, [[Boston Musical Instrument Company]], [[E. A. Couturier]], [[King Musical Instruments|H. N. White Company/King Musical Instruments]], [[James Warren York|J. W. York]], and [[C.G. Conn]]. In the 21st century, leading mainstream manufacturers of trombones include [[Vincent Bach Corporation|Vincent Bach]], [[C.G. Conn|Conn]], Courtois, Edwards, [[Getzen]], Greenhoe, [[Jupiter Band Instruments|Jupiter]], Kanstul, King, Michael Rath, Schilke, S.E.

Nemo appears in two of Verne's science-fiction classics, ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1870) and ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (1875). He also makes a cameo appearance in a play on which Verne may have collaborated, ''[[Journey Through the Impossible]]'' (1882).\n\nNemo is a mysterious figure. Though originally of unknown nationality, he's later described as the son of an East Indian [[Maharaja|raja]]. A scientific visionary, he roams the depths of the seas in his [[submarine]], the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was assembled from parts manufactured in several different countries, then shipped to Nemo's cover address. The captain is consumed by a hunger for vengeance and hatred of [[imperialism]]; the [[British Empire]] is ultimately revealed as his main antagonist. \n\nNemo has appeared in various film adaptations of Verne's novels, where he has been portrayed by such celebrated actors as [[James Mason]], [[Herbert Lom]], and [[Michael Caine]]. He has also been appropriated by other authors for their own novels, including [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]'s ''[[The Other Log of Phileas Fogg]]'',  [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s ''[[Captain Nemo: The Fantastic History of a Dark Genius]]'', and [[Thomas F. Monteleone]]'s ''The Secret Sea''.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n''Nemo'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for \"no one\" or \"nobody\".\n\nMoreover ''Nemo'' is itself the Latin translation of [[Ancient Greek]] ''[[Outis]]'' (\"Nobody\"), the pseudonym adopted by [[Odysseus]], in [[Greek mythology]]\u2014a ruse employed to outwit the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]]. This appears to be the intended meaning, since in ''The Mysterious Island'', when Cyrus Smith addresses him as Captain Nemo, the latter replies, \"I have no name!\"\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n[[File:OrchhaPalace.jpg|thumb|[[Jahangir Mahal, Orchha|Jahangir Mahal]], home to the real-life rajas of [[Orchha State|Orchha]], Bundelkhand]]\n[[File:Nemo s death.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo's death in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'']]\nChief among the few details of Nemo's history given in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' are his hatred of imperialism and his grief over the loss of his loved ones in years past.\n\nIn ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', Captain Nemo identifies himself as Prince Dakkar, son of the Hindu [[Maharaja|raja]] of [[Bundelkhand]], and a descendant of the Muslim [[Sultan]] [[Tipu Sultan|Fateh Ali Khan Tipu]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], famous for the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] (1767\u20131799) and [[Mysorean rockets|Mysorean rocket]] technology. After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], in which Dakkar lost both his family and his kingdom, the prince devoted himself to scientific research, ultimately building the [[Nautilus (Verne)|''Nautilus'']] and crusing the seven seas with a crew of devoted followers. They gather [[bullion]] from various shipwrecks in the ocean, most notably from the hulks of the Spanish treasure fleet sunk during the [[Battle of Vigo Bay]]. Nemo claims to have no interest in terrestrial affairs but occasionally intervenes to aid people in distress, e.g.,  by giving salvaged treasure to participants in the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)]] against the island's [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] rulers ... by saving (both physically and financially) a [[Sinhalese people|Ceylonese]] or [[Tamil people|Tamil]] pearl hunter from a shark attack ... by rescuing the castaways in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' ... and by covertly protecting another set of castaways in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''.\n\nLike many actual [[Princely state|Indian princes]] of the era, Nemo had a Western education, during which, as he states, he spent his youth touring and studying throughout Europe. In his first meeting with Professor Aronnax and his companions, the three castaways speak to him in French, English, [[Latin]], and German; Nemo later reveals that he is fluent in all of these tongues. Aronnax praises the captain's French, noting that he \"expressed himself with perfect ease and without any accent.\" Relying on his intuition and knowledge of [[ethnology]], the professor concludes that \"there's southern blood\" in him but can't determine the captain's exact origin. The ''Nautilus''{{'s}} library, lounge, and art collections reveal that Nemo is intimately acquainted with European culture, also that he's an accomplished performer on the [[pipe organ|organ]].\n\nNemo dies of unspecified natural causes on board the ''Nautilus'', docked permanently inside Dakkar Grotto on [[The Mysterious Island|Lincoln Island]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. Cyrus Smith, leader of the castaways whom Nemo protected, administered the last rites, then submerged the ''Nautilus'' in the grotto's waters.\n\n== Character ==\n[[File:20000 Nemo organ.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo playing the [[organ (music)|organ]], at which he was a master.]]\n\nNemo's characteristics are largely presented through the observations of Professor Pierre Aronnax, narrator of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas''. At their first meeting, the professor remarks: \"Whether this individual was thirty-five or fifty years of age, I couldn't tell.\" He goes on to describe Nemo as a tall, self-contained man with a straight nose, broad brow, and wide-set eyes\u2014\"certainly the most wonderful physical specimen I'd ever met up with.\" In ''The Mysterious Island'', the captain is in his late sixties and sports a long white beard.\n\nHe avoids dry land, except when it's uninhabited, as with [[Antarctica]] and [[desert islands]]. In keeping with his contempt for the nations of the surface, he uses no products that are not marine in nature, be it food, clothing, furnishing, or even [[tobacco]]. Little is revealed about his political opinions except an almost maniacal hatred of oppression, with which he identifies all the [[imperialistic]] nations of the world. He therefore identifies himself with those oppressed, be they [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretans]] rising against the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]], [[Ceylonese]] [[pearl hunting|pearl divers]], or even [[Right whale|black whales]] attacked by [[sperm whales|cachalots (sperm whales)]]. When Professor Aronnax alleges that Nemo violates maritime and international law by sinking warships, Nemo responds that he is merely defending himself from his attackers, and that the laws of the world on the surface no longer apply to him.

Nemo appears in two of Verne's science-fiction classics, ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1870) and ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (1875). He also makes a cameo appearance in a play on which Verne may have collaborated, ''[[Journey Through the Impossible]]'' (1882).\n\nNemo is a mysterious figure. Though originally of unknown nationality, he's later described as the son of an East Indian [[Maharaja|raja]]. A scientific visionary, he roams the depths of the seas in his [[submarine]], the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was assembled from parts manufactured in several different countries, then shipped to Nemo's cover address. The captain is consumed by a hunger for vengeance and hatred of [[imperialism]]; the [[British Empire]] is ultimately revealed as his main antagonist. \n\nNemo has appeared in various film adaptations of Verne's novels, where he has been portrayed by such celebrated actors as [[James Mason]], [[Herbert Lom]], and [[Michael Caine]]. He has also been appropriated by other authors for their own novels, including [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]'s ''[[The Other Log of Phileas Fogg]]'',  [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s ''[[Captain Nemo: The Fantastic History of a Dark Genius]]'', and [[Thomas F. Monteleone]]'s ''The Secret Sea''.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n''Nemo'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for \"no one\" or \"nobody\".\n\nMoreover ''Nemo'' is itself the Latin translation of [[Ancient Greek]] ''[[Outis]]'' (\"Nobody\"), the pseudonym adopted by [[Odysseus]], in [[Greek mythology]]\u2014a ruse employed to outwit the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]]. This appears to be the intended meaning, since in ''The Mysterious Island'', when Cyrus Smith addresses him as Captain Nemo, the latter replies, \"I have no name!\"\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n[[File:OrchhaPalace.jpg|thumb|[[Jahangir Mahal, Orchha|Jahangir Mahal]], home to the real-life rajas of [[Orchha State|Orchha]], Bundelkhand]]\n[[File:Nemo s death.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo's death in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'']]\nChief among the few details of Nemo's history given in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' are his hatred of imperialism and his grief over the loss of his loved ones in years past.\n\nIn ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', Captain Nemo identifies himself as Prince Dakkar, son of the Hindu [[Maharaja|raja]] of [[Bundelkhand]], and a descendant of the Muslim [[Sultan]] [[Tipu Sultan|Fateh Ali Khan Tipu]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], famous for the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] (1767\u20131799) and [[Mysorean rockets|Mysorean rocket]] technology. After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], in which Dakkar lost both his family and his kingdom, the prince devoted himself to scientific research, ultimately building the [[Nautilus (Verne)|''Nautilus'']] and crusing the seven seas with a crew of devoted followers. They gather [[bullion]] from various shipwrecks in the ocean, most notably from the hulks of the Spanish treasure fleet sunk during the [[Battle of Vigo Bay]]. Nemo claims to have no interest in terrestrial affairs but occasionally intervenes to aid people in distress, e.g.,  by giving salvaged treasure to participants in the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)]] against the island's [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] rulers ... by saving (both physically and financially) a [[Sinhalese people|Ceylonese]] or [[Tamil people|Tamil]] pearl hunter from a shark attack ... by rescuing the castaways in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' ... and by covertly protecting another set of castaways in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''.\n\nLike many actual [[Princely state|Indian princes]] of the era, Nemo had a Western education, during which, as he states, he spent his youth touring and studying throughout Europe. In his first meeting with Professor Aronnax and his companions, the three castaways speak to him in French, English, [[Latin]], and German; Nemo later reveals that he is fluent in all of these tongues. Aronnax praises the captain's French, noting that he \"expressed himself with perfect ease and without any accent.\" Relying on his intuition and knowledge of [[ethnology]], the professor concludes that \"there's southern blood\" in him but can't determine the captain's exact origin. The ''Nautilus''{{'s}} library, lounge, and art collections reveal that Nemo is intimately acquainted with European culture, plus that he's an accomplished performer on the [[pipe organ|organ]].\n\nNemo dies of unspecified natural causes on board the ''Nautilus'', docked permanently inside Dakkar Grotto on [[The Mysterious Island|Lincoln Island]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. Cyrus Smith, leader of the castaways whom Nemo protected, administered the last rites, then submerged the ''Nautilus'' in the grotto's waters.\n\n== Character ==\n[[File:20000 Nemo organ.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo playing the [[organ (music)|organ]], at which he was a master.]]\n\nNemo's characteristics are largely presented through the observations of Professor Pierre Aronnax, narrator of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas''. At their first meeting, the professor remarks: \"Whether this individual was thirty-five or fifty years of age, I couldn't tell.\" He goes on to describe Nemo as a tall, self-contained man with a straight nose, broad brow, and wide-set eyes\u2014\"certainly the most wonderful physical specimen I'd ever met up with.\" In ''The Mysterious Island'', the captain is in his late sixties and sports a long white beard.\n\nHe avoids dry land, except when it's uninhabited, as with [[Antarctica]] and [[desert islands]]. In keeping with his contempt for the nations of the surface, he uses no products that are not marine in nature, be it food, clothing, furnishing, or even [[tobacco]]. Little is revealed about his political opinions except an almost maniacal hatred of oppression, with which he identifies all the [[imperialistic]] nations of the world. He therefore identifies himself with those oppressed, be they [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretans]] rising against the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]], [[Ceylonese]] [[pearl hunting|pearl divers]], or even [[Right whale|black whales]] attacked by [[sperm whales|cachalots (sperm whales)]]. When Professor Aronnax alleges that Nemo violates maritime and international law by sinking warships, Nemo responds that he is merely defending himself from his attackers, and that the laws of the world on the surface no longer apply to him. In one scene, Nemo exclaims:\n\n{{quotation|On its surface they can still exercise their iniquitous claims, battle each other, devour each other, haul every earthly horror.

His tenure with the Bulls included their overwhelming dominance of the NBA during the 1990s, led by superstar player and daddy [[Michael Jordan]]. The Bulls won six NBA championships between 1991 and 1998, and Krause was a two-time recipient of the [[NBA Executive of the Year Award]]. His career in sports included positions as a [[Scout (sport)|scout]] or general manager for the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963\u201373)|Baltimore Bullets]], [[Chicago White Sox]], and the Chicago Bulls.\n\n==Early career==\nKrause was born in 1939 and grew up in [[Chicago]]. He played high school [[baseball]] as a [[catcher]] at [[William Howard Taft High School (Chicago, Illinois)|Taft High School]] in Chicago and attended [[Bradley University]].\n\nAfter college he went to work as a scout with the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963\u201373)|Baltimore Bullets]]. Early on Krause gained a reputation of being able to eye talent. He is credited by some for discovering future Hall of Famer [[Earl Monroe]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Halberstam |first=David |authorlink=David Halberstam |title=Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made |year=1999 |publisher=Random House |location=New York City |isbn=0-679-41562-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/playingforkeepsm00halb/page/196 196] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/playingforkeepsm00halb/page/196 }}</ref>\n\nWhile with the Bullets, he urged the team to pick [[North Dakota Fighting Sioux|North Dakota]] forward [[Phil Jackson]] in the [[1967 NBA draft]]. The Bullets did not draft him, but Krause continued to keep in touch during Jackson's playing career and into his first years as a coach. Their relationship flourished during the 1970s and 1980s; notably, when Jackson was coaching the [[Albany Patroons]] in the [[Continental Basketball Association]], Krause once called him requesting an analysis of the league's players, which Jackson provided in great detail.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 198.</ref>\n\nAfter a few years with Baltimore, Krause worked as a scout with the [[Phoenix Suns]], [[Philadelphia 76ers]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[Chicago Bulls]] in the 1970s before he left pro basketball to scout pro baseball instead. He was scouting for the [[Chicago White Sox]] when he received a call from new [[Chicago Bulls]] owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] to join the Bulls as their new General Manager and once again work in pro basketball.\n\n==Chicago Bulls==\nKrause succeeded [[Rod Thorn]] as [[Chicago Bulls]] GM in 1985, and managed the franchise as [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Phil Jackson]] ascended to elite status in their respective positions.\n\n===Drafting===\nJerry made a number of moves on being named GM that immediately began building the foundation for the team that would dominate the 1990s. He traded away undesirable players, turned over the Bulls roster and built up a collection of draft picks that would result in 2 significant additions to the team in 1987. Krause found two gems in the 1987 draft: [[Scottie Pippen]], a small forward from the [[University of Central Arkansas]]; and [[Horace Grant]], a power forward from [[Clemson University|Clemson]]. The two were, along with Jordan, cornerstones of the Bulls' 1991\u20131993 championship teams.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 200\">Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 200.</ref>  They were also culled from relative hoops obscurity; this went back to Krause's strength for finding players who were not well-received or even known by mainstream scouts.\n\nHowever, Krause also made many picks that did not help the team. In 1986, Krause planned on selecting a tall forward named [[Brad Sellers]] in the NBA Draft. Sellers, Krause reasoned, was too good a pick to pass up, as he handled the ball very well for a big man, and also had a solid outside jumper. Jordan, on the other hand, pushed management to take a two-way guard from [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] named [[Johnny Dawkins]]. It looked as though Krause would take Dawkins even as late as the morning of the draft; the coaches and players had made it clear that they wanted him and not Sellers, and Krause did not particularly have a problem with Dawkins' game. The Bulls' head coach at the time, [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]], even told Duke coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]] the night before the draft that the team would pick Dawkins. However, Krause ignored everyone and picked Sellers anyway, and spent the summer trying to sell him to Jordan. Jordan went after Sellers mercilessly in practice, and Sellers was traded after three seasons. He played six total seasons in the NBA, averaging 6.3 points per game. Dawkins played for nine seasons in the NBA and averaged 11.1 points per game, though he did suffer from various injuries throughout his career.\n\nSellers was one of many Krause draft picks to underperform; others included [[Stacey King]], [[Mark Randall (basketball)|Mark Randall]], [[Will Perdue]] and [[Marcus Fizer]]. King and Perdue would serve as backup players on the Bulls' 1991\u20131993 Championship teams, but both players would later be traded away. During the 1993\u201394 NBA season, King was traded to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in exchange for 7'2\" Australian-born center [[Luc Longley]].<ref name=\"longley\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/history/alltime_transactions.html|title=Chicago Bulls All-Time Transactions|work=www.nba.com|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}</ref> Longley's emergence for the Bulls during the 1994\u201395 season made Perdue expendable. Just before the start of the 1995\u201396 season, Perdue was traded to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for [[Dennis Rodman]].\n\n===The Oakley trade===\nKrause made another transaction in 1988 to which Jordan strongly objected. It was clear that the Bulls needed a center if they were to contend for a title, so Krause dealt [[Charles Oakley]] to New York for [[Bill Cartwright]]. Oakley, who happened to be Jordan's best friend on the team,<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 246\">Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 246.</ref> was extremely tough, particularly on the boards and on defense. When the Pistons came after Jordan with their physical players, Oakley was his bodyguard. Cartwright was a true center, unlike the power forward Oakley, but was much older. Although Cartwright did not have Oakley's reputation as a lockdown defender, he was very effective at preventing opposing centers from dominating games,<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 279-80.</ref> and was a more capable inside scorer. Jordan despised the trade, not only because of the players involved but also because of how they learned of it: via television, while he and Oakley were on their way to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to see a [[Mike Tyson]] fight.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 200\"/> Cartwright turned out to be everything the Bulls needed, however, providing a presence in the middle for all three Bulls championships from 1991\u20131993. Perhaps most importantly, Cartwright proved to be the league's best center at defending [[Patrick Ewing]], the [[New York Knicks]]' star who was the key player on the Bulls' most important early-1990s conference rival.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 246\"/>\n\nOne of the most notable ways was demonstrated in the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]], when the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]], including Jordan and Pippen, took on [[Croatia national basketball team|Croatia]] for the gold medal. The Croatia team featured [[Toni Kuko\u010d]], a young star whom Krause had discovered through European contacts and was courting to a degree that some of the Bulls found annoying.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 288-89.</ref> Jordan biographer [[David Halberstam]] said that Jordan and Pippen \"seemed to play against Kukoc as if they had a vendetta\", and that \"in the end, it was as if they had been playing not against Kukoc but against Krause.\"<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 289\">Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 289.</ref> Jordan would later be quoted as saying: \"The trade of Oakley was good, and the best thing he did was to get Pippen and Grant. That's it. His claim to fame is that he drafted [[Earl Monroe]] for the Bullets. And I say to him, 'What pick was that?' He says, 'Two.' And I say, 'Hell! Earl Monroe was a real secret, huh? A real secret? If you hadn't taken him, he'd have gone third!'\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0605/gallery.toxic/content.13.html | work=CNN | title=SI.com}}</ref>\n\nJordan later admitted that he may have been wrong and Krause may have been right about the trade for Cartwright,<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 247.</ref> but it changed nothing about Jordan's overall distrust and loathing for Krause. These feelings came to the surface in many different ways, including Jordan nicknaming Krause \"Crumbs\" in reference to his morbid obesity and slovenly appearance, as well as having doughnut residue on his clothes.<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/rosenblog/ct-jerry-krause-deserved-better-rosenbloom-20170321-column.html]</ref>\n\n===Rebuilding after the first retirement of Jordan===\nThe first retirement of Jordan, following the 1993 NBA season, brought massive change to the Chicago Bulls roster. Krause attempted to replace Jordan with defensive specialist [[Pete Myers]] and free agent [[Ron Harper]], but neither proved capable of leading Chicago to a championship, although Harper would play an invaluable role in the second \"three-peat\". Just before Jordan announced his retirement, Krause was finally able to persuade Kuko\u010d to buy himself out of his European contract and join the Bulls.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 289\"/> The 1993\u201394 Bulls made it to the conference semi-finals, where they lost to the New York Knicks in seven games. The Bulls had beaten the Knicks in the playoffs the three previous years.\n\nWhen Jordan returned to the NBA at the end of the 1995 season, Krause once again went to work in assembling what has been labeled the best team in NBA history after offseason acquisition of [[Dennis Rodman]] from the Spurs. The Bulls won a then-NBA record 72 games and Krause was named [[NBA Executive of the Year Award|Executive of the Year]] for the second time. The next year, they achieved a then second best-ever NBA season with 69 wins and repeated as champions.\n\n===\"The Last Dance\"===\nKrause and head coach [[Phil Jackson]] had been friends for years, but their relationship was, in Jackson's opinion, shattered early in the 1990s after ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reporter Sam Smith (whom Krause despised) published a book on the 1991 title team, ''[[The Jordan Rules (book)|The Jordan Rules]]''. The book detailed the tension that already existed between Krause and the players, and ultimately drove a wedge between Krause and Jackson.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 311-15.</ref> Regardless of the success Jackson had as head coach of the Bulls, the tension between Jackson and Krause grew in the succeeding years, and by the 1997\u201398 season, was especially illustrated by the following incidents:\n\n*During the summer of 1997, Krause's stepdaughter got married. All of the Bulls assistant coaches and their wives were invited to the wedding, as was [[Tim Floyd]], then the head coach at [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State]], whom Krause was openly courting as Jackson's successor (and who would eventually succeed Jackson). Jackson and his then wife, June, were not even told of the wedding, much less invited, only finding out about the event when the wife of Cartwright, who by that time had become a Bulls assistant, asked June what she would be wearing to the reception.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 249.</ref>\n*After contentious negotiations between Jackson and the Bulls in that same period, Jackson was signed for the 1997\u201398 season only. Krause announced the signing in what Chicago media widely considered to be a mean-spirited manner, emphasizing that Jackson would not be rehired even if the Bulls won the 1997\u201398 title. That triggered an argument between Jackson and Krause in which Jackson essentially told Krause that he seemed to be rooting for the other side and not the Bulls. At that point, Krause told Jackson, \"I don't care if it's 82-and-0 this year, you're fucking gone.\"<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 41. The \"82\" refers to the number of regular-season games each NBA team plays.</ref>\n*Krause was widely quoted as saying, \"Players and coaches don't win championships; organizations win championships.\" The statement particularly offended Michael Jordan. However, Krause said that his original phrasing was \"Players and coaches ''alone'' don\u2019t win championships; organizations win championships.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nba.com/article/2017/03/27/morning-tip-remembering-jerry-krause-legacy-chicago-bulls|author=Aldridge, David|work=nba.com|title=Chicago Bulls' golden era a reflection of Jerry Krause's words, deeds|date=March 27, 2017|accessdate=April 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Bulls' final title of the [[Michael Jordan|Jordan]] era in 1998, Jackson left the team vowing never to coach again, but after he took a year off he decided to give it another chance with the Lakers. Longtime friend of Krause and Bulls assistant coach [[Tex Winter]], who was the architect of the triangle offense,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.hoopshype.com/blogs/lazenby/category/jerry-krause/ |title=Jerry Krause dies &#124; HoopsHype |publisher=Blogs.hoopshype.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-22}}</ref> stayed with the Bulls for another full season, leaving the organization in the summer of 1999, when Phil Jackson was hired to coach the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Krause said that he had not spoken to Jackson since. When Jordan was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2009, Krause was not in attendance. Krause said he would not attend the ceremony because of his personal boycott of the Hall of Fame over their refusal to induct Winter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=4464526|title=Krause passes on MJ's induction on principle|date=September 12, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2017}}</ref> Krause and Jackson briefly put their differences aside when Winter was finally inducted two years later.

He took the job for the money\".<ref>[http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/19759358/nba-phil-jackson-biggest-failure-was-letting-game-pass-by]</ref>\n\n==Rebuilding==\nDeciding that the Bulls were aging and facing an uncertain future, Krause chose to unload the veterans and rebuild. Few major players were added though (other than from drafts).<ref name=\"blogabull.com\">[https://www.blogabull.com/2017/3/24/15044772/the-true-story-of-jerry-krause-breakup-of-the-bulls-michael-jordan-phil-jackson-scottie-pippen]</ref>\n\n===Younger talent===\nThe draft brought prolific collegiate players such as [[Elton Brand]], [[Ron Artest]], [[Marcus Fizer]], [[Jamal Crawford]], and [[Jay Williams (basketball)|Jay Williams]] to the Bulls but it would be the 2001 draft that stood out. After finishing 15\u201367 during the 2000\u20132001 season, Krause decided to gamble and trade away his best player in Brand for high schooler [[Tyson Chandler]] who was hyped as \"the next Kevin Garnett\", and draft another high schooler in [[Eddy Curry]] who, similarly, was hyped as a slightly smaller version of [[Shaquille O'Neal]], with the fourth overall pick in the draft.\n\nKrause believed that the tandem of Chandler and Curry would develop into elite players and provide the foundation for another dynasty. A mid-season trade the following year brought scorer [[Jalen Rose]] to the Bulls in exchange for [[Brad Miller (basketball player)|Brad Miller]] and Artest which cleared playing time for the two rookies. After drafting Jay Williams during the offseason, the Bulls had a roster with Rose, Crawford, Curry, Chandler, Williams, and Fizer that fulfilled Krause's dream of a talented young athletic team. The Bulls showed some improvement the following year.\n\n==Retirement and death==\nIn 2003, Krause retired as GM. The official explanation involved obesity-related health problems.<ref>{{Cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/08/sports/basketball-bulls-builder-krause-resigns-after-18-years.html |title=Bulls Builder Krause Resigns After 18 Years|author=Liz Robbins|work=[[The New York Times]] |date = April 8, 2003}}</ref> The Bulls fell to 23\u201359 in the next season, and Krause's dream of a talented young athletic team imploded with all of his acquisitions traded or out of the league within three years.

Meanwhile, former players [[Elton Brand|Brand]], [[Brad Miller (basketball)|Miller]], [[Ron Artest|Artest]], and [[Tyson Chandler|Chandler]] became All-Stars for their new teams.\n\nKrause went back to his roots and worked briefly for the [[New York Yankees]] [[baseball]] team as a scout, before joining the [[New York Mets]] in 2005.<ref>Fred Mitchell. \"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/831850991.html?dids=831850991:831850991&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+04%2C+2005&author=Fred+Mitchell%2C+Tribune+staff+reporter&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=Krause+prefers+silent+approach+to+scouting&pqatl=google Krause prefers silent approach to scouting]\".

His tenure with the Bulls included their overwhelming dominance of the NBA during the 1990s, led by superstar player [[Michael Jordan]]. The Bulls won six NBA championships between 1991 and 1998, and Krause was a two-time recipient of the [[NBA Executive of the Year Award]]. His career in sports included positions as a [[Scout (sport)|scout]] or general manager for the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963\u201373)|Baltimore Bullets]], [[Chicago White Sox]], and the Chicago Bulls.\n\n==Early career==\nKrause was born in 1939 and grew up in [[Chicago]]. He played high school [[baseball]] as a [[catcher]] at [[William Howard Taft High School (Chicago, Illinois)|Taft High School]] in Chicago and attended [[Bradley University]].\n\nAfter college he went to work as a scout with the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963\u201373)|Baltimore Bullets]]. Early on Krause gained a reputation of being able to eye talent. He is credited by some for discovering future Hall of Famer [[Earl Monroe]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Halberstam |first=David |authorlink=David Halberstam |title=Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made |year=1999 |publisher=Random House |location=New York City |isbn=0-679-41562-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/playingforkeepsm00halb/page/196 196] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/playingforkeepsm00halb/page/196 }}</ref>\n\nWhile with the Bullets, he urged the team to pick [[North Dakota Fighting Sioux|North Dakota]] forward [[Phil Jackson]] in the [[1967 NBA draft]]. The Bullets did not draft him, but Krause continued to keep in touch during Jackson's playing career and into his first years as a coach. Their relationship flourished during the 1970s and 1980s; notably, when Jackson was coaching the [[Albany Patroons]] in the [[Continental Basketball Association]], Krause once called him requesting an analysis of the league's players, which Jackson provided in great detail.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 198.</ref>\n\nAfter a few years with Baltimore, Krause worked as a scout with the [[Phoenix Suns]], [[Philadelphia 76ers]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[Chicago Bulls]] in the 1970s before he left pro basketball to scout pro baseball instead. He was scouting for the [[Chicago White Sox]] when he received a call from new [[Chicago Bulls]] owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] to join the Bulls as their new General Manager and once again work in pro basketball.\n\n==Chicago Bulls==\nKrause succeeded [[Rod Thorn]] as [[Chicago Bulls]] GM in 1985, and managed the franchise as [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Phil Jackson]] ascended to elite status in their respective positions.\n\n===Drafting===\nJerry made a number of moves on being named GM that immediately began building the foundation for the team that would dominate the 1990s. He traded away undesirable players, turned over the Bulls roster and built up a collection of draft picks that would result in 2 significant additions to the team in 1987. Krause found two gems in the 1987 draft: [[Scottie Pippen]], a small forward from the [[University of Central Arkansas]]; and [[Horace Grant]], a power forward from [[Clemson University|Clemson]]. The two were, along with Jordan, cornerstones of the Bulls' 1991\u20131993 championship teams.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 200\">Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 200.</ref>  They were also culled from relative hoops obscurity; this went back to Krause's strength for finding players who were not well-received or even known by mainstream scouts.\n\nHowever, Krause also made many picks that did not help the team. In 1986, Krause planned on selecting a tall forward named [[Brad Sellers]] in the NBA Draft. Sellers, Krause reasoned, was too good a pick to pass up, as he handled the ball very well for a big man, and also had a solid outside jumper. Jordan, on the other hand, pushed management to take a two-way guard from [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] named [[Johnny Dawkins]]. It looked as though Krause would take Dawkins even as late as the morning of the draft; the coaches and players had made it clear that they wanted him and not Sellers, and Krause did not particularly have a problem with Dawkins' game. The Bulls' head coach at the time, [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]], even told Duke coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]] the night before the draft that the team would pick Dawkins. However, Krause ignored everyone and picked Sellers anyway, and spent the summer trying to sell him to Jordan. Jordan went after Sellers mercilessly in practice, and Sellers was traded after three seasons. He played six total seasons in the NBA, averaging 6.3 points per game. Dawkins played for nine seasons in the NBA and averaged 11.1 points per game, though he did suffer from various injuries throughout his career.\n\nSellers was one of many Krause draft picks to underperform; others included [[Stacey King]], [[Mark Randall (basketball)|Mark Randall]], [[Will Perdue]] and [[Marcus Fizer]]. King and Perdue would serve as backup players on the Bulls' 1991\u20131993 Championship teams, but both players would later be traded away. During the 1993\u201394 NBA season, King was traded to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in exchange for 7'2\" Australian-born center [[Luc Longley]].<ref name=\"longley\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/history/alltime_transactions.html|title=Chicago Bulls All-Time Transactions|work=www.nba.com|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}</ref> Longley's emergence for the Bulls during the 1994\u201395 season made Perdue expendable. Just before the start of the 1995\u201396 season, Perdue was traded to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for [[Dennis Rodman]].\n\n===The Oakley trade===\nKrause made another transaction in 1988 to which Jordan strongly objected. It was clear that the Bulls needed a center if they were to contend for a title, so Krause dealt [[Charles Oakley]] to New York for [[Bill Cartwright]]. Oakley, who happened to be Jordan's best friend on the team,<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 246\">Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 246.</ref> was extremely tough, particularly on the boards and on defense. When the Pistons came after Jordan with their physical players, Oakley was his bodyguard. Cartwright was a true center, unlike the power forward Oakley, but was much older. Although Cartwright did not have Oakley's reputation as a lockdown defender, he was very effective at preventing opposing centers from dominating games,<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 279-80.</ref> and was a more capable inside scorer. Jordan despised the trade, not only because of the players involved but also because of how they learned of it: via television, while he and Oakley were on their way to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to see a [[Mike Tyson]] fight.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 200\"/> Cartwright turned out to be everything the Bulls needed, however, providing a presence in the middle for all three Bulls championships from 1991\u20131993. Perhaps most importantly, Cartwright proved to be the league's best center at defending [[Patrick Ewing]], the [[New York Knicks]]' star who was the key player on the Bulls' most important early-1990s conference rival.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 246\"/>\n\nOne of the most notable ways was demonstrated in the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]], when the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]], including Jordan and Pippen, took on [[Croatia national basketball team|Croatia]] for the gold medal. The Croatia team featured [[Toni Kuko\u010d]], a young star whom Krause had discovered through European contacts and was courting to a degree that some of the Bulls found annoying.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 288-89.</ref> Jordan biographer [[David Halberstam]] said that Jordan and Pippen \"seemed to play against Kukoc as if they had a vendetta\", and that \"in the end, it was as if they had been playing not against Kukoc but against Krause.\"<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 289\">Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 289.</ref> Jordan would later be quoted as saying: \"The trade of Oakley was good, and the best thing he did was to get Pippen and Grant. That's it. His claim to fame is that he drafted [[Earl Monroe]] for the Bullets. And I say to him, 'What pick was that?' He says, 'Two.' And I say, 'Hell! Earl Monroe was a real secret, huh? A real secret? If you hadn't taken him, he'd have gone third!'\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0605/gallery.toxic/content.13.html | work=CNN | title=SI.com}}</ref>\n\nJordan later admitted that he may have been wrong and Krause may have been right about the trade for Cartwright,<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 247.</ref> but it changed nothing about Jordan's overall distrust and loathing for Krause. These feelings came to the surface in many different ways, including Jordan nicknaming Krause \"Crumbs\" in reference to his morbid obesity and slovenly appearance, as well as having doughnut residue on his clothes.<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/rosenblog/ct-jerry-krause-deserved-better-rosenbloom-20170321-column.html]</ref>\n\n===Rebuilding after the first retirement of Jordan===\nThe first retirement of Jordan, following the 1993 NBA season, brought massive change to the Chicago Bulls roster. Krause attempted to replace Jordan with defensive specialist [[Pete Myers]] and free agent [[Ron Harper]], but neither proved capable of leading Chicago to a championship, although Harper would play an invaluable role in the second \"three-peat\". Just before Jordan announced his retirement, Krause was finally able to persuade Kuko\u010d to buy himself out of his European contract and join the Bulls.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 289\"/> The 1993\u201394 Bulls made it to the conference semi-finals, where they lost to the New York Knicks in seven games. The Bulls had beaten the Knicks in the playoffs the three previous years.\n\nWhen Jordan returned to the NBA at the end of the 1995 season, Krause once again went to work in assembling what has been labeled the best team in NBA history after offseason acquisition of [[Dennis Rodman]] from the Spurs. The Bulls won a then-NBA record 72 games and Krause was named [[NBA Executive of the Year Award|Executive of the Year]] for the second time. The next year, they achieved a then second best-ever NBA season with 69 wins and repeated as champions.\n\n===\"The Last Dance\"===\nKrause and head coach [[Phil Jackson]] had been friends for years, but their relationship was, in Jackson's opinion, shattered early in the 1990s after ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reporter Sam Smith (whom Krause despised) published a book on the 1991 title team, ''[[The Jordan Rules (book)|The Jordan Rules]]''. The book detailed the tension that already existed between Krause and the players, and ultimately drove a wedge between Krause and Jackson.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 311-15.</ref> Regardless of the success Jackson had as head coach of the Bulls, the tension between Jackson and Krause grew in the succeeding years, and by the 1997\u201398 season, was especially illustrated by the following incidents:\n\n*During the summer of 1997, Krause's stepdaughter got married. All of the Bulls assistant coaches and their wives were invited to the wedding, as was [[Tim Floyd]], then the head coach at [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State]], whom Krause was openly courting as Jackson's successor (and who would eventually succeed Jackson). Jackson and his then wife, June, were not even told of the wedding, much less invited, only finding out about the event when the wife of Cartwright, who by that time had become a Bulls assistant, asked June what she would be wearing to the reception.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 249.</ref>\n*After contentious negotiations between Jackson and the Bulls in that same period, Jackson was signed for the 1997\u201398 season only. Krause announced the signing in what Chicago media widely considered to be a mean-spirited manner, emphasizing that Jackson would not be rehired even if the Bulls won the 1997\u201398 title. That triggered an argument between Jackson and Krause in which Jackson essentially told Krause that he seemed to be rooting for the other side and not the Bulls. At that point, Krause told Jackson, \"I don't care if it's 82-and-0 this year, you're fucking gone.\"<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 41. The \"82\" refers to the number of regular-season games each NBA team plays.</ref>\n*Krause was widely quoted as saying, \"Players and coaches don't win championships; organizations win championships.\" The statement particularly offended Michael Jordan. However, Krause said that his original phrasing was \"Players and coaches ''alone'' don\u2019t win championships; organizations win championships.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nba.com/article/2017/03/27/morning-tip-remembering-jerry-krause-legacy-chicago-bulls|author=Aldridge, David|work=nba.com|title=Chicago Bulls' golden era a reflection of Jerry Krause's words, deeds|date=March 27, 2017|accessdate=April 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Bulls' final title of the [[Michael Jordan|Jordan]] era in 1998, Jackson left the team vowing never to coach again, but after he took a year off he decided to give it another chance with the Lakers. Longtime friend of Krause and Bulls assistant coach [[Tex Winter]], who was the architect of the triangle offense,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.hoopshype.com/blogs/lazenby/category/jerry-krause/ |title=Jerry Krause dies &#124; HoopsHype |publisher=Blogs.hoopshype.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-22}}</ref> stayed with the Bulls for another full season, leaving the organization in the summer of 1999, when Phil Jackson was hired to coach the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Krause said that he had not spoken to Jackson since. When Jordan was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2009, Krause was not in attendance. Krause said he would not attend the ceremony because of his personal boycott of the Hall of Fame over their refusal to induct Winter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=4464526|title=Krause passes on MJ's induction on principle|date=September 12, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2017}}</ref> Krause and Jackson briefly put their differences aside when Winter was finally inducted two years later. The two shook hands before the ceremony and conducted themselves in a cordial manner during Winter's segment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nba.nbcsports.com/2011/08/12/for-tex-winter-can-kraus-and-jackson-put-aside-feud/|title=For Tex Winter, Krause and Jackson put aside feud|first=Kurt|last=Helin|date=August 13, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nKrause remarked when Jackson become President of the New York Knicks that \"Phil didn't take the job because he thought he had a playoff club. He took the job for the money\".<ref>[http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/19759358/nba-phil-jackson-biggest-failure-was-letting-game-pass-by]</ref>\n\n==Rebuilding==\nDeciding that the Bulls were aging and facing an uncertain future, Krause chose to unload the veterans and rebuild. Few major players were added though (other than from drafts).<ref name=\"blogabull.com\">[https://www.blogabull.com/2017/3/24/15044772/the-true-story-of-jerry-krause-breakup-of-the-bulls-michael-jordan-phil-jackson-scottie-pippen]</ref>\n\n===Younger talent===\nThe draft brought prolific collegiate players such as [[Elton Brand]], [[Ron Artest]], [[Marcus Fizer]], [[Jamal Crawford]], and [[Jay Williams (basketball)|Jay Williams]] to the Bulls but it would be the 2001 draft that stood out. After finishing 15\u201367 during the 2000\u20132001 season, Krause decided to gamble and trade away his best player in Brand for high schooler [[Tyson Chandler]] who was hyped as \"the next Kevin Garnett\", and draft another high schooler in [[Eddy Curry]] who, similarly, was hyped as a slightly smaller version of [[Shaquille O'Neal]], with the fourth overall pick in the draft.\n\nKrause believed that the tandem of Chandler and Curry would develop into elite players and provide the foundation for another dynasty. A mid-season trade the following year brought scorer [[Jalen Rose]] to the Bulls in exchange for [[Brad Miller (basketball player)|Brad Miller]] and Artest which cleared playing time for the two rookies. After drafting Jay Williams during the offseason, the Bulls had a roster with Rose, Crawford, Curry, Chandler, Williams, and Fizer that fulfilled Krause's dream of a talented young athletic team. The Bulls showed some improvement the following year.\n\n==Retirement and death==\nIn 2003, Krause retired as GM. The official explanation involved obesity-related health problems.<ref>{{Cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/08/sports/basketball-bulls-builder-krause-resigns-after-18-years.html |title=Bulls Builder Krause Resigns After 18 Years|author=Liz Robbins|work=[[The New York Times]] |date = April 8, 2003}}</ref> The Bulls fell to 23\u201359 in the next season, and Krause's dream of a talented young athletic team imploded with all of his acquisitions traded or out of the league within three years. Eddy Curry had success in the league, but perhaps did not live up to the lofty expectations that Krause had. Meanwhile, former players [[Elton Brand|Brand]], [[Brad Miller (basketball)|Miller]], [[Ron Artest|Artest]], and [[Tyson Chandler|Chandler]] became All-Stars for their new teams.\n\nKrause went back to his roots and worked briefly for the [[New York Yankees]] [[baseball]] team as a scout, before joining the [[New York Mets]] in 2005.<ref>Fred Mitchell. \"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/831850991.html?dids=831850991:831850991&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+04%2C+2005&author=Fred+Mitchell%2C+Tribune+staff+reporter&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=Krause+prefers+silent+approach+to+scouting&pqatl=google Krause prefers silent approach to scouting]\".

Under the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] it supervises [[election]]s for [[trade union|labor union]] representation and can investigate and remedy [[unfair labor practice]]s. Unfair labor practices may involve union-related situations or instances of [[protected concerted activity]]. The NLRB is governed by a five-person board and a [[General Counsel]], all of whom are appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] with the [[Advice and consent|consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Board members are appointed to five-year terms and the General Counsel is appointed to a four-year term. The General Counsel acts as a prosecutor and the Board acts as an [[appellate]] [[quasi-judicial body]] from decisions of [[administrative law judge]]s.\n\nThe NLRB is headquartered at 1015 Half St. SE, Washington, D.C., with over 30 regional, sub-regional and residential offices throughout the United States.\n\n==History==\n\n===1933\u20131935: First collective bargaining organization 'National Labor Board'===\nThe history of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) can be traced to enactment of the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] in 1933. Section 7(a) of the act protected collective bargaining rights for unions,{{sfn|Morris|2005|p=8}} but was difficult to enforce. A massive wave of union organizing was punctuated by employer and [[union violence]], [[general strike]]s, and [[recognition strike]]s.{{sfn|Dubofsky|Dulles|2004|pp=252\u201354}}{{sfn|Bernstein|Piven|1969|pp=217\u201318}}{{sfn|Rayback|pp=328\u201329}} The National Industrial Recovery Act was administered by the [[National Recovery Administration]] (NRA). At the outset, NRA Administrator [[Hugh S. Johnson]] believed that Section 7(a) would be self-enforcing, but the tremendous labor unrest proved him wrong. On August 5, 1933, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] announced the establishment of the [[National Labor Board]], under the auspices of the NRA, to implement the collective bargaining provisions of Section 7(a).{{sfn|Morris|2005|p=25}}\n\nThe National Labor Board (NLB) established a system of 20 regional boards to handle the immense caseload. Each regional board had a representative designated by local labor unions, local employers, and a \"public\" representative. All were unpaid. The public representative acted as the chair. The regional boards could hold hearings and propose settlements to disputes. Initially, they lacked authority to order representation elections, but this changed after Roosevelt issued additional executive orders on February 1 and February 23, 1934.\n\nThe NLB, too, proved ineffective. Congress passed Public Resolution No. 44 on June 19, 1934, which empowered the president to appoint a new labor board with authority to issue subpoenas, hold elections, and mediate labor disputes.{{sfn|Morris|2005|p=47}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|2003|p=151}} On June 29, President Roosevelt abolished the NLB and in [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 6763 established a new, three-member National Labor Relations Board.{{sfn|Vittoz|1987|p= 144}}{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=71\u201372}}\n\n[[Lloyd K. Garrison]] was the first Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board (often referred to by scholars the \"First NLRB\" or \"Old NLRB\").{{sfn|Vittoz|1987|p=145}} The \"First NLRB\" established organizational structures which continue at the NLRB in the 21st century. This includes the regional structure of the board; the use of [[administrative law judge]]s and regional hearing officers to initially rule on cases; an appeal process to the national board; and the use of expert staff, organized into various divisions, at the national level.{{sfn|Gross|1974|p=156}} Formally, Garrison established the:{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=79\u201380}}\n* Executive Office, which handled administrative activities of the national and regionalsit boards, field staff, and Legal Division. It was overseen by an Executive Secretary.\n* Examining Division, national staff which conducted field investigations and assisted the regional boards with adjudications, hearings, and representative elections.\n* Information Division, which provided the press and public with news.\n* Legal Division, which assisted the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in seeking compliance with board decisions in the courts, or in responding to suits brought about by board decisions.<ref>The \"first NLRB\" was barred from initiating or responding to lawsuits itself. It could only ask the Department of Justice to act on its behalf.</ref>\n* Research Division, which studied decisions of the regional boards so that a comprehensive labor law might be developed, and studied the economics of each case.\n\nWithin a year, however, most of the jurisdiction of the \"First NLRB\" was stripped away. Its decisions in the automobile, newspaper, textile, and steel industries proved so volatile that Roosevelt himself often removed these cases from the board's jurisdiction. Several federal court decisions further limited the board's power. [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Robert F. Wagner]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]] \u2013 [[New York (state)|NY]]) subsequently pushed legislation through Congress to give a statutory basis to federal labor policy that survived court scrutiny. On July 5, 1935, a new law\u2014the [[National Labor Relations Act]] (NLRA, also known as the Wagner Act)\u2014superseded the NIRA and established a new, long-lasting federal labor policy.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2003|pp=400\u201306}} The NLRA designated the National Labor Relations Board as the implementing agency.\n\n===1935\u20131939: Constitutionality, communism, and organizational changes===\n[[File:Madden witt fahy.jpg|thumb|[[J. Warren Madden]] (left), [[Nathan Witt]], and [[Charles Fahy]] (right) reviewing documents before a congressional hearing on December 13, 1937.]]\nThe first Chairman of the \"new\" NLRB was [[J. Warren Madden]], professor of the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Law]].<ref>\"President Names New Labor Board.\" ''New York Times.'' August 24, 1935.</ref> Madden largely confirmed the previous structure of the \"first NLRB\" by formally establishing five divisions within the agency:\n* '''Administrative Division:'''  Oversaw all administrative activities of national and regional boards and their finances; led by Secretary\n* '''Economic Division:'''  Analyzed economic evidence in cases; made studies of economics of labor relations for use by board and  courts; supervised by Chief Industrial Economist; also known as the Technical Service Division{{sfn|Gross|1974|p=219}}\n* '''Legal Division:'''  Handled NLRB either decisions appealed to courts or cases in which NLRB sought enforcement of its decisions; overseen by General Counsel (hired by NLRB board); comprised two subdivisions: \n** Litigation Section:  Advised national and regional boards, prepared briefs, worked with Justice Department\n** Review Section:  Analyzed regional hearings and decisions; issued interpretations of law; prepared forms; drafted regulations\n* '''Publications Division:'''  Handled all press and public inquiries; published decisions of national and regional boards and their rules and regulations; overseen by Director of Publications\n* '''Trial Examining Division:'''  Held hearings before the national board; overseen by Chief Trial Examiner\nBenedict Wolf served as first Secretary of the NLRB, [[Charles H. Fahy]] the first General Counsel, and [[David J. Saposs]] the first Chief Industrial Economist.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=79, 170, 174\u201375}} Wolf resigned in mid-1937, and [[Nathan Witt]], an attorney in the Legal Division, was named Secretary in October.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=111, 143}}\n\nThe Economic Division was a critical one for the NLRB. Cause-and-effect was one of the fundamental assumptions of the National Labor Relations Act, and for the causes of labor unrest to be understood economic analysis was needed.{{sfn|Stryker|1989|p=344}} From the start, the Economic Division undertook three important tasks: 1) Gather economic data in support of cases before the courts; 2) Conduct general studies of labor relations to guide the board in formulating decisions and policies; and 3) Research the history of labor relations (the history of written agreements, whether certain issues were historically part of collective bargaining, how unions functioned internally, trends in employer activities, trends in collective bargaining, whether certain employer actions led to labor disputes, etc.) so that the board could educate itself, the courts, Congress, and the public about labor relations.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=176\u201379}} The first function proved critical to the survival of the NLRB. It was the Economic Division's data and analysis, more than then NLRB's legal reasoning, which proved critical in persuading the Supreme Court to sustain the Wagner Act in ''NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel''.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=176\u201379, 191}}{{sfn|Stryker|1989|p=347}} The Court even cited several Economic Division studies in its decision.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=228\u201329}} In the wake of ''Jones & Laughlin Steel'', many labor relations experts outside the agency concluded that economic analysis was \"an accepted fact\" essential to the proper functioning of the agency.{{sfn|Gross|1974|p=233}} The Economic Division did, too.  It asked Madden to pair an economist with an attorney in every important case,{{sfn|Eisner|2000|p=101}} and prepared outline of the economic data needed to support each case in case it went before the courts.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=182\u201383}}\n\nDuring his time on the NLRB, Madden was often opposed by the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), which believed that Madden was using the NLRA and the procedures and staff of the NLRB to favor the AFL's primary competitor, the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO).<ref>Stark, Louis. \"Both A.F.L. and C.I.O. Hit at National Labor Board.\" ''New York Times.'' October 14, 1937.</ref>{{sfn|Gall|1999|pp=83\u201384, 97\u201398}} The NLRB and NLRA were also under intense pressure from employers, the press, congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and conservative [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=171\u201373}}{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=2}}\n\nThe NLRB's Economic Division proved critical in pushing for a congressional investigation into employer anti-union activities, and ensuring that investigation was a success. The Economic Division was deeply aware of employer use of [[Labor spy|labor spies]], violence, and [[company union]]s to thwart union organizing, and quietly pressed for a congressional investigation into these and other tactics. Senator [[Robert M. La Follette, Jr.]] took up the suggestion, on June 6, 1936, the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Senate Committee on Education and Labor]] established a Subcommittee Investigating Violations of Free Speech and the Rights of Labor chaired by La Follette.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=214\u201323}} Better known as the \"[[La Follette Committee]]\", the subcommittee held extensive hearings for five years and published numerous reports.  The committee uncovered extensive evidence of millions of company dollars used to pay for spies and [[fifth column]]ists within unions, exposed the culpability of local law enforcement in acts of violence and murder against union supporters (particularly in the [[Harlan County War]]),{{sfn|Baker|Stack|2006|pp=56\u201357}} revealed the wide extent of illegal [[blacklisting]] of union members, and exposed the use of armed [[strikebreaker]]s and widespread stockpiling of tear gas, vomit gas, machine guns, mortars, and armor by corporations to use against [[Strike action|strikers]].{{sfn|Luff|2007|p=774}} Some of the evidence the committee used was provided by the Economic Division,{{sfn|Lambert|2005|p=90}} and the investigation proved critical for a time in defending the agency from business and congressional attack.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=214\u201323}}\n\nThe biggest issue the NLRB faced was constitutional. The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] and NLRB legal staff wanted the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] to rule as quickly as possible on the constitutionality of the NLRA. But the Board and Justice Department also realized that the Court's [[Lochner era|''Lochner'' era]] legal philosophy made it unlikely for the Court to uphold the Act. Subsequently, Madden strove to resolve minor cases before they could become court challenges, and worked to delay appeals as long as possible until the best possible case could be brought to the Court.{{sfn|Chasse|2011|p=57}} This legal strategy paid off. The Supreme Court upheld the NLRA in ''[[National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation]]'', 301 U.S. 1 (1937).{{sfn|Bernstein|Piven|1969|pp=643\u201346}} Afterward, Madden continued to strategically guide the NLRB's legal efforts to strengthen the federal courts' view of the NLRA and the board's actions.{{sfn|Chasse|2011|p=57}} Because of the efforts of Madden and NLRB General Counsel Charles H. Fahy, the Supreme Court reviewed only 27 cases between August 1935 and March 1941, even though the board had processed nearly 5,000 cases since its inception. The Supreme Court enforced the NLRB's rulings in 19 cases without modifying them, enforced them with modification in six more, and denied enforcement in two cases. Additionally, the Board won all 30 [[injunction]] and all 16 representation cases before the lower courts, a rate of success unequalled by any other federal agency.{{sfn|Bernstein|Piven|1969|pp=662\u201363}}\n\nAFL opposition to the \"Madden Board\" grew after decisions in ''Shipowners' Ass'n of the Pacific Coast'', 7 NLRB 1002 (1938), ''enf'd'' ''[[American Federation of Labor v. National Labor Relations Board]]'', 308 U.S. 401 (1940) (awarding a longshoremen's unit to the CIO rather than the AFL), and ''American Can Co.'', 13 NLRB 1252 (1939) (unit's history of collective bargaining outweighs desire of workers to form craft-only unit).<ref>{{harvnb|Bernstein|Piven|1969|pp=654\u201355}} The AFL held to a philosophy of [[craft unionism]], while the CIO believed in [[industrial unionism]]. According to the AFL, ''American Can'' decisively tipped NLRB policy in favor of the CIO.</ref>\n\nThe AFL began pushing for an investigation into the NLRB, and this investigation led to allegations of communist influence within the agency. In June 1938, the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (led by Chairman [[Martin Dies, Jr.]] [D-[[Texas|TX]]]) heard testimony from AFL leader [[John P. Frey]], who accused Madden of staffing the NLRB with [[Communism|communists]].<ref>\"Reds Start Count of Allies in Federal Jobs and Push Participation in C.I.O., Frey Says.\" ''New York Times.''

On July 20, 1939, Republicans and conservative Democrats formed a coalition to push through the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] a resolution establishing a Special Committee to Investigate the National Labor Relations Board (the \"[[J.

Smith]] (D-[[Virginia|VA]]).{{sfn|Gross|1981|pp=151\u201354}}{{sfn|Bernstein|Piven|1969|p=668}} On March 7, 1940, the Smith Committee proposed legislation to abolish the NLRB, reconstitute it, and radically amend the NLRA.{{sfn|Gross|1981|pp=194\u201399}}<ref>Among the changes proposed:  Removing of many of the guarantees of collective bargaining from the Wagner Act's preamble, denying legal protection to [[sitdown strike]]rs and agricultural workers, removing the requirement that employers must bargain with unions, making the General Counsel independent from the Board, abolishing the board's economic research unit, enhancing employer free speech rights, introducing the right of employers to seek an election among their workers, and removing the board's authority to engage in bargaining unit determination.

On November 15, 1940, President Roosevelt nominated [[Harry A. Millis]] to the NLRB and named him Chairman, and nominated Madden to a seat on the U.S. Court of Claims.<ref>\"Dr. Millis Slated to Head the NLRB.\" ''New York Times.'' November 7, 1940; Hurd, Charles. \"Roosevelt Names Dr. Millis to NLRB, Replacing Madden.\" ''New York Times.'' November 16, 1940.</ref>\n\n===1940\u20131945: The Economics Division and World War II===\nAnother major structural change occurred at the same time that Madden left the NLRB. The Smith committee's anti-communist drive also targeted David J. Saposs, the NLRB Chief Industrial Economist. Saposs had been surreptitiously assessed by members of the Communist Party USA for membership, and rejected as a prospect.{{sfn|Gross|1974|p=220}} But Smith and others attacked Saposs as a communist, and Congress defunded his division and his job on October 11, 1940.{{sfn|Gross|1981|pp=199, 202}}{{sfn|Jacobs|2007|pp=171\u201372}}{{sfn|Chasse|2011|p=58}} Although the Smith committee's investigation proved critical, the disestablishment of the Economic Division was due to many reasons\u2014both internal and external to the NLRB, and only some of which involved allegations of communist infiltration. As historian James A. Gross observed:.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=264}}\n<blockquote>The Division was eliminated for all kinds of reasons which had nothing to do with the merits and importance of its work:  political pressures and maneuverings, jealousy and empire building between and among lawyers and economists inside the Board, opposition to leftist ideologies, a personal attack on the Chief Economist, David Saposs, and a mighty hostility to the administrative process.</blockquote>\n\nThe loss of the Economic Division was a major blow to the NLRB.  It had a major tactical impact: Economic data helped the NLRB fulfill its adjudicatorial and prosecutorial work in areas such as [[unfair labor practice]]s (ULPs), representation elections, and in determining remedial actions (such as reinstatement, back pay awards, and fines).{{sfn|Stryker|1989|pp=346\u201347}} Economic data also undermined employer resistance to the agency by linking that opposition to employer ULPs.{{sfn|Stryker|1989|p=349}} The loss also left the board dependent on the biased information offered by the parties in dispute before it, leading to poor decision-making and far less success in the courts.{{sfn|Gross|1981|pp=266\u201367}} It also had a major strategic impact: It left the board unable to determine whether its administration of the law was effective or not.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=265}} Nor could the board determine whether labor unrest was a serious threat to the economy or not. As [[Labor history (discipline)|labor historian]] Josiah Bartlett Lambert put it: \"Without the Economic Research Division, the NLRB could not undertake empirical studies to determine the actual impact of [[Secondary action|secondary boycotts]], [[jurisdictional strike]]s, national emergency strikes, and the like.\"{{sfn|Lambert|2005|p=104}} The Economic Division was critical to a long-range NLRB process to lead to the long-term evolution of industrial labor relations in the U.S., but that goal had to be abandoned.{{sfn|Eisner|2000|p=101}}{{sfn|Eisner|2010|pp=336\u201337}} Most importantly, however, the evisceration of the Economic Division struck at the fundamental purpose of federal labor law, which was to allow experts to adjudicate labor disputes rather than use a legal process. With this data and analysis, widespread skepticism about the board's expertise quickly spread through Congress and the courts.  It also left the board largely unable to engage in rule-making, forcing it to make labor law on an inefficient, time-consuming case-by-case basis.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=266}} As of 1981, NLRB was still the only federal agency forbidden to seek economic information about the impact of its activities.{{sfn|Gross|1981|pp=264\u201365}}\n\nThe second Chairman of the NLRB, [[Harry A. Millis]], led the board in a much more moderate direction.{{sfn|Lambert|2005|p=104}} Lacking an economic division to give it ammunition to fight with Millis deliberately made the NLRB dependent on Congress and the executive branch for its survival.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=261}} Millis made a large number of organizational changes. He stripped the office of Secretary of its power, set up an Administrative Division to supervise the 22 regional offices, initiated a study of the Board's administrative procedures, and genuinely delegated power to the regional offices.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=229}} He removed casehandling and regional office communication from the jurisdiction of the Office of the Secretary and created a Field Division.{{sfn|Tomlins|1985|p=225}}<ref>Stark, Louis. \"Methods of NLRB Indicated in Study Made By Own Men.\" New York Times. March 22, 1940.</ref> He also adopted procedures requiring the board made its decisions based solely on the trial examiner's report, authorized NLRB review attorneys to review trial examiner report, required decisions to be drafted ahead of time and distributed for review, authorized review attorneys to revise drafts before a final decision was issued, required trial examiners to emphasize findings of fact and to address points of law, and began holding board meetings when there were differences of opinion over decisions.{{sfn|Tomlins|1985|p=225}}\n\nMillis eliminated the Review Division's decisive role in cases, which had been established under Madden and Witt.{{sfn|Tomlins|1985|p=226}} Madden and Witt had adopted a highly centralized Board structure so that (generally speaking) only the cases most favorable to the board made it to the courts. The centralized structure meant that only the strongest cases made it to national board, so that the board could apply all its economic and legal powers to crafting the best decision possible. This strategy enabled the NLRB to defend itself very well before the Supreme Court. But Madden and Witt had held on to the centralized strategy too long, and made political enemies in the process. Millis substituted a decentralized process in which the board was less a decision-maker and more a provider of services to the regions.{{sfn|Tomlins|1985|p=226}} Many of the changes Millis instituted were designed to mimic requirements placed on other agencies by the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]].{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=264}}\n\nAmerican entry into World War II on December 8, 1941, significantly changed the NLRB. On January 12, 1942, President Roosevelt created the [[National War Labor Board (1942\u20131945)|National War Labor Board]] (NWLB), which displaced the NLRB as the main focus of federal labor relations for the duration of the war. The NWLB was given the authority to \"finally determine\" any labor dispute which threatened to interrupt war production, and to stabilize union wages and benefits during the war. Although Roosevelt instructed the NWLB not to intrude on jurisdiction exercised by the NLRB, the War Labor Board refused to honor this request. From 1942 to 1945, Millis tried to secure a jurisdictional agreement with NWLB Chairman George W. Taylor. But these discussions proved fruitless, and Millis broke them off in June 1945. The NWLB also heavily raided the NLRB for staff, significantly hindering NLRB operations.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=243}}\n\nAdditional changes came with the passage of the [[War Labor Disputes Act]] (WLDA) on June 25, 1943. Enacted over Roosevelt's veto after 400,000 coal miners, their wages significantly lower due to high wartime inflation, struck for a $2-a-day wage increase,{{sfn|Malsberger|2000|p=104}}{{sfn|Karatnycky|2000|p=115}} the legislation (in part) required the NLRB to issue a ballot outlining all the collective bargaining proposals and counter-proposals, wait 30 days, and then hold a strike vote.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=244}} The War Labor Disputes Act proved very burdensome.  The NLRB processed 2,000 WLDA cases from 1943 to the end of 1945, of which 500 were strike votes. The act's strike vote procedures did little to stop strikes, however, and Millis feared unions were using the referendums to whip up pro-strike feelings among their members. Millis also believed the law's strike vote process permitted more strikes to occur than the NLRB would have allowed under its old procedures. There were so many strike vote filings in the six months after the war ended that NLRB actually shut down its long distance telephone lines, cancelled all out of town travel, suspended all public hearings, and suspended all other business to accommodate the workload.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=245}} By early 1945, Millis was in ill health.<ref>\"Dr. H.A. Millis Dies.\" ''New York Times.'' June 26, 1948.</ref>  He resigned from the NLRB on June 7, 1945,<ref>\"In Administration Shake-Up\", ''Associated Press,'' June 8, 1945.</ref> and [[Paul M. Herzog]] was named his successor.\n\n===1947\u20131965: Taft-Hartley===\nA major turning point in the history of the NLRB came in 1947 with passage of the [[Taft-Hartley Act]]. Disruptions caused by strikes during World War II as well as the huge wave of strikes that followed the end of the war fueled a growing movement in 1946 and 1947 to amend the NLRA to correct what critics saw as a pro-labor tilt in federal law.<ref>Stark, Louis. \"Save Bargaining, Keep Peace In Industry, Says NLRB Head.\" ''New York Times.'' March 7, 1947.</ref>{{sfn|Gross|1981|pp=251\u201352}} Drafted by the powerful Republican Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] and the strongly anti-union Representative [[Fred A. Hartley, Jr.]], the Taft-Hartley Act banned jurisdictional strikes, [[Wildcat strike action|wildcat strikes]], political strikes, [[Secondary action|secondary boycotts]], secondary picketing, mass picketing, union campaign donations made from dues money, the [[closed shop]], and unions of supervisors. The act also enumerated new employer rights, defined union-committed ULPs, gave states the right to opt out of federal labor law through [[right-to-work law]]s, required unions to give an 80-days' strike notice in all cases, established procedures for the President to end a strike in a national emergency, and required all union officials to sign an anti-Communist oath. Organizationally, the act made the General Counsel a presidential appointee, independent of the board itself, and gave the General Counsel limited powers to seek injunctions without referring to the Justice Department. It also banned the NLRB from engaging in any mediation or conciliation, and formally enshrined in law the ban on hiring personnel to do economic data collection or analysis.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=264}}\n\nIn August 1947, [[Robert N.

He felt the communist oath provisions were unconstitutional, that the amendments would turn the NLRA into a management weapon, that creation of an independent General Counsel would weaken the NLRB, and that the law's dismantling of the agency's economic analysis unit deprived the NLRB of essential expertise.{{sfn|Gross|2010|pp=11\u201313}} Nonetheless, Congress overrode Truman's veto of the Taft-Hartley Act on June 23, 1947, and the bill became law.{{sfn|Lee|1980|pp=101\u201303}}\n\nThe Taft-Hartley Act fundamentally changed the nature of federal labor law, but it also seriously hindered the NLRB's ability to enforce the law. The loss of the mediation function left the NLRB unable to become involved in labor disputes, a function it had engaged in since its inception as the National Labor Board in 1933. This hindered the agency's efforts to study, analyze, and create bulwarks against [[Good faith|bad-faith]] [[collective bargaining]]; reduced its ability to formulate national labor policy in this area; and left the agency making labor law on an ineffective, time-consuming case-by-case basis.{{sfn|Lambert|2005|p=104}} The separation of the General Counsel from supervision by the national board also had significant impact on the agency. This separation was enacted against the advice of the Justice Department, contradicted the policy Congress had enacted in the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946, and ignored Millis' extensive internal reforms. The change left the NLRB as the only federal agency unable to coordinate its decision-making and legal activities, and the only agency exempted in this manner under the Administrative Procedure Act. The separation of the General Counsel was not discussed by the committee or by any witnesses during the legislation's mark-up. Indeed, there was no basis for it at all in the public record.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=264}} It was, in the words of sociologist Robin Stryker, \"little-noted\" and \"unprecedented\".{{sfn|Stryker|1989|p=344}}\n\nThe anti-communist oath provisions generated extensive public debate, and generated disputes before the Supreme Court several times. The Taft-Hartley oath first reached the court in [[American Communications Ass'n v. Douds]], {{Ussc|339|382|1950|el=no}}, in which the court held 5-to-1 that the oath did not violate the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], was not an ''[[ex post facto]]'' law or [[bill of attainder]] in violation of [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|Article One, Section 10]], and was not a \"test oath\" in violation of [[Article Six of the United States Constitution#Oaths|Article Six]]. The issue again came before the court in [[Garner v. Board of Public Works]], {{Ussc|341|716|1951|el=no}}, in which the court unanimously held that a municipal [[loyalty oath]] was not an ''ex post facto law'' or bill of attainder. It came before the court yet a third time in ''Wieman v. Updegraff'', {{Ussc|344|183|1952|el=no}}. This time, the outcome was radically different. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that state loyalty oath legislation violated the [[due process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. In 1965, the Supreme Court held 5-to-4 that the anti-communist oath was a bill of attainder in ''[[United States v. Brown (1965)|United States v.

In broad terms, the General Counsel is responsible for investigating and prosecuting [[unfair labor practice]] claims and for the general supervision of the NLRB field offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlrb.gov/who-we-are/general-counsel|title=The General Counsel - NLRB|website=www.nlrb.gov}}</ref> The General Counsel is appointed by the President to a four-year term and independent from the Board; it has limited independence to argue for a change in the law in presenting cases to the Board. The General Counsel oversees four divisions: the Division of Operations Management, the Division of Administration, the Division of Advice, and the Division of Enforcement Litigation.\n\nThe Board, on the other hand, is the adjudicative body that decides the unfair labor practice cases brought to it. Once the Board has decided the issue, it is the General Counsel's responsibility to uphold the Board's decision, even if it is contrary to the position it advocated when presenting the case to the Board. The Board is also responsible for the administration of the Act's provisions governing the holding of elections and resolution of jurisdictional disputes.\n\nThe Board has more than thirty regional offices. The regional offices conduct elections, investigate unfair labor practice charges, and make the initial determination on those charges (whether to dismiss, settle, or issue complaints). The Board has jurisdiction to hold elections and prosecute violations of the Act in [[Puerto Rico]] and [[American Samoa]].\n\n===Jurisdiction===\nThe Board's [[jurisdiction]] is limited to [[private sector]] employees and the [[United States Postal Service]]; other than Postal Service employees, it has no authority over labor relations disputes involving governmental, [[railroad]] and [[airline]] employees covered by the [[Adamson Railway Labor Act]], or agricultural employees. On the other hand, in those parts of the private sector its jurisdictional standards are low enough to reach almost all employers whose business has any appreciable impact on [[interstate commerce]].\n\n===Processing of charges===\nCharges are filed by parties against unions or employers with the appropriate regional office. The regional office will investigate the complaint. If a violation is believed to exist, the region will take the case before an [[Administrative Law Judge]] who will conduct a hearing. The decision of the Administrative Law Judge may be reviewed by the five member Board. Board decisions are reviewable by [[United States Courts of Appeals]]. The Board's decisions are not self-executing: it must seek court enforcement in order to force a recalcitrant party to comply with its orders. (For greater detail on this process see the entry for [[unfair labor practice]]).\n\n==General Counsel==\n[[Lafe Solomon]] was named Acting General Counsel on June 21, 2010. His nomination was sent to the U.S. Senate on January 5, 2011. Solomon's authority came into question on August 13, 2013 when Judge [[Benjamin Settle]] for the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington]] denied a petition for [[Temporary restraining order#Injunctions in US labor law context|injunctive]] relief, ruling that Solomon had not been properly appointed under the [[Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998]] (FVRA).<ref>{{citation |last=Trottman |first=Melanie |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/08/22/ruling-on-top-lawyer-adds-to-nlrb-questions |title=Ruling on Top Lawyer Adds to NLRB Questions |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=August 22, 2013 |accessdate= August 22, 2013}}</ref> Although other [[United States district court|district courts]] had enforced Solomon's requests, Judge Settle's decision called into question all of Solomon's activity since June 21, 2010, focusing on subsections (a)(1) and (2) of the FVRA; some pundits claimed that Solomon's appointment was allowed under subsection (a)(3).<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.laborrelationstoday.com/2013/08/articles/presidential-appointments/another-setback-for-the-nlrb-federal-district-court-invalidates-the-acting-general-counsels-appointment |title=Another Setback for the NLRB: Federal District Court Invalidates the Acting General Counsel's Appointment |work=Labor Relations Today |date=August 22, 2013 |accessdate= August 22, 2013}}</ref> President Obama withdrew Solomon's nomination.\n\nOn July 31, 2013, President Obama nominated former NLRB nominee Richard Griffin as General Counsel\u2014\"a kind of prosecutor at the board\" and \"one of the most critical roles at the agency.\"<ref name=\"huffingtonpost_2013\">{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/17/richard-griffin-nlrb_n_3611585.html | title=Richard Griffin, Former NLRB Nominee, To Be Offered General Counsel Slot After Filibuster Deal | publisher=Huffington Post | date=July 18, 2013 | accessdate=April 4, 2016 |first1=Dave |last1=Jamieson |first2=Ryan |last2=Grim}}</ref> Solomon's nomination was withdrawn.<ref name=vail>{{citation |url=http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/15380/senate_approves_new_members_for_national_labor_board |last=Vail |first=Bruce |title=National Labor Board Shutdown Averted as Senate Approves New Members |work=In These Times |date=July 31, 2013 |accessdate= July 31, 2013}}</ref> The Senate approved Griffin's nomination on October 29, 2013, by a vote of 55 to 44.<ref>{{cite news|last=Devaney|first=Tim|title=Rejected NLRB pick wins vote to serve as board counsel|work=The Washington Times|date=October 29, 2013|accessdate=April 26, 2016|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/29/obama-nlrb-counsel-pick-wins-key-vote/?page=all}}</ref>\n\n==Board members==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Under the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] it supervises [[election]]s for [[trade union|labor union]] representation and can investigate and remedy [[unfair labor practice]]s. Unfair labor practices may involve union-related situations or instances of [[protected concerted activity]]. The NLRB is governed by a five-person board and a [[General Counsel]], all of whom are appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] with the [[Advice and consent|consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Board members are appointed to five-year terms and the General Counsel is appointed to a four-year term. The General Counsel acts as a prosecutor and the Board acts as an [[appellate]] [[quasi-judicial body]] from decisions of [[administrative law judge]]s.\n\nThe NLRB is headquartered at 1015 Half St. SE, Washington, D.C., with over 30 regional, sub-regional and residential offices throughout the United States.\n\n==History==\n\n===1933\u20131935: First collective bargaining organization 'National Labor Board'===\nThe history of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) can be traced to enactment of the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] in 1933. Section 7(a) of the act protected collective bargaining rights for unions,{{sfn|Morris|2005|p=8}} but was difficult to enforce. A massive wave of union organizing was punctuated by employer and [[union violence]], [[general strike]]s, and [[recognition strike]]s.{{sfn|Dubofsky|Dulles|2004|pp=252\u201354}}{{sfn|Bernstein|Piven|1969|pp=217\u201318}}{{sfn|Rayback|pp=328\u201329}} The National Industrial Recovery Act was administered by the [[National Recovery Administration]] (NRA). At the outset, NRA Administrator [[Hugh S. Johnson]] believed that Section 7(a) would be self-enforcing, but the tremendous labor unrest proved him wrong. On August 5, 1933, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] announced the establishment of the [[National Labor Board]], under the auspices of the NRA, to implement the collective bargaining provisions of Section 7(a).{{sfn|Morris|2005|p=25}}\n\nThe National Labor Board (NLB) established a system of 20 regional boards to handle the immense caseload. Each regional board had a representative designated by local labor unions, local employers, and a \"public\" representative. All were unpaid. The public representative acted as the chair. The regional boards could hold hearings and propose settlements to disputes. Initially, they lacked authority to order representation elections, but this changed after Roosevelt issued additional executive orders on February 1 and February 23, 1934.\n\nThe NLB, too, proved ineffective. Congress passed Public Resolution No. 44 on June 19, 1934, which empowered the president to appoint a new labor board with authority to issue subpoenas, hold elections, and mediate labor disputes.{{sfn|Morris|2005|p=47}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|2003|p=151}} On June 29, President Roosevelt abolished the NLB and in [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 6763 established a new, three-member National Labor Relations Board.{{sfn|Vittoz|1987|p= 144}}{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=71\u201372}}\n\n[[Lloyd K. Garrison]] was the first Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board (often referred to by scholars the \"First NLRB\" or \"Old NLRB\").{{sfn|Vittoz|1987|p=145}} The \"First NLRB\" established organizational structures which continue at the NLRB in the 21st century. This includes the regional structure of the board; the use of [[administrative law judge]]s and regional hearing officers to initially rule on cases; an appeal process to the national board; and the use of expert staff, organized into various divisions, at the national level.{{sfn|Gross|1974|p=156}} Formally, Garrison established the:{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=79\u201380}}\n* Executive Office, which handled administrative activities of the national and regionalsit boards, field staff, and Legal Division. It was overseen by an Executive Secretary.\n* Examining Division, national staff which conducted field investigations and assisted the regional boards with adjudications, hearings, and representative elections.\n* Information Division, which provided the press and public with news.\n* Legal Division, which assisted the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in seeking compliance with board decisions in the courts, or in responding to suits brought about by board decisions.<ref>The \"first NLRB\" was barred from initiating or responding to lawsuits itself. It could only ask the Department of Justice to act on its behalf.</ref>\n* Research Division, which studied decisions of the regional boards so that a comprehensive labor law might be developed, and studied the economics of each case.\n\nWithin a year, however, most of the jurisdiction of the \"First NLRB\" was stripped away. Its decisions in the automobile, newspaper, textile, and steel industries proved so volatile that Roosevelt himself often removed these cases from the board's jurisdiction. Several federal court decisions further limited the board's power. [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Robert F. Wagner]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]] \u2013 [[New York (state)|NY]]) subsequently pushed legislation through Congress to give a statutory basis to federal labor policy that survived court scrutiny. On July 5, 1935, a new law\u2014the [[National Labor Relations Act]] (NLRA, also known as the Wagner Act)\u2014superseded the NIRA and established a new, long-lasting federal labor policy.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2003|pp=400\u201306}} The NLRA designated the National Labor Relations Board as the implementing agency.\n\n===1935\u20131939: Constitutionality, communism, and organizational changes===\n[[File:Madden witt fahy.jpg|thumb|[[J. Warren Madden]] (left), [[Nathan Witt]], and [[Charles Fahy]] (right) reviewing documents before a congressional hearing on December 13, 1937.]]\nThe first Chairman of the \"new\" NLRB was [[J. Warren Madden]], professor of the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Law]].<ref>\"President Names New Labor Board.\" ''New York Times.'' August 24, 1935.</ref> Madden largely confirmed the previous structure of the \"first NLRB\" by formally establishing five divisions within the agency:\n* '''Administrative Division:'''  Oversaw all administrative activities of national and regional boards and their finances; led by Secretary\n* '''Economic Division:'''  Analyzed economic evidence in cases; made studies of economics of labor relations for use by board and  courts; supervised by Chief Industrial Economist; also known as the Technical Service Division{{sfn|Gross|1974|p=219}}\n* '''Legal Division:'''  Handled NLRB either decisions appealed to courts or cases in which NLRB sought enforcement of its decisions; overseen by General Counsel (hired by NLRB board); comprised two subdivisions: \n** Litigation Section:  Advised national and regional boards, prepared briefs, worked with Justice Department\n** Review Section:  Analyzed regional hearings and decisions; issued interpretations of law; prepared forms; drafted regulations\n* '''Publications Division:'''  Handled all press and public inquiries; published decisions of national and regional boards and their rules and regulations; overseen by Director of Publications\n* '''Trial Examining Division:'''  Held hearings before the national board; overseen by Chief Trial Examiner\nBenedict Wolf served as first Secretary of the NLRB, [[Charles H. Fahy]] the first General Counsel, and [[David J. Saposs]] the first Chief Industrial Economist.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=79, 170, 174\u201375}} Wolf resigned in mid-1937, and [[Nathan Witt]], an attorney in the Legal Division, was named Secretary in October.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=111, 143}}\n\nThe Economic Division was a critical one for the NLRB. Cause-and-effect was one of the fundamental assumptions of the National Labor Relations Act, and for the causes of labor unrest to be understood economic analysis was needed.{{sfn|Stryker|1989|p=344}} From the start, the Economic Division undertook three important tasks: 1) Gather economic data in support of cases before the courts; 2) Conduct general studies of labor relations to guide the board in formulating decisions and policies; and 3) Research the history of labor relations (the history of written agreements, whether certain issues were historically part of collective bargaining, how unions functioned internally, trends in employer activities, trends in collective bargaining, whether certain employer actions led to labor disputes, etc.) so that the board could educate itself, the courts, Congress, and the public about labor relations.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=176\u201379}} The first function proved critical to the survival of the NLRB. It was the Economic Division's data and analysis, more than then NLRB's legal reasoning, which proved critical in persuading the Supreme Court to sustain the Wagner Act in ''NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel''.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=176\u201379, 191}}{{sfn|Stryker|1989|p=347}} The Court even cited several Economic Division studies in its decision.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=228\u201329}} In the wake of ''Jones & Laughlin Steel'', many labor relations experts outside the agency concluded that economic analysis was \"an accepted fact\" essential to the proper functioning of the agency.{{sfn|Gross|1974|p=233}} The Economic Division did, too.  It asked Madden to pair an economist with an attorney in every important case,{{sfn|Eisner|2000|p=101}} and prepared outline of the economic data needed to support each case in case it went before the courts.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=182\u201383}}\n\nDuring his time on the NLRB, Madden was often opposed by the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), which believed that Madden was using the NLRA and the procedures and staff of the NLRB to favor the AFL's primary competitor, the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO).<ref>Stark, Louis. \"Both A.F.L. and C.I.O. Hit at National Labor Board.\" ''New York Times.'' October 14, 1937.</ref>{{sfn|Gall|1999|pp=83\u201384, 97\u201398}} The NLRB and NLRA were also under intense pressure from employers, the press, congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and conservative [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=171\u201373}}{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=2}}\n\nThe NLRB's Economic Division proved critical in pushing for a congressional investigation into employer anti-union activities, and ensuring that investigation was a success. The Economic Division was deeply aware of employer use of [[Labor spy|labor spies]], violence, and [[company union]]s to thwart union organizing, and quietly pressed for a congressional investigation into these and other tactics. Senator [[Robert M. La Follette, Jr.]] took up the suggestion, on June 6, 1936, the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Senate Committee on Education and Labor]] established a Subcommittee Investigating Violations of Free Speech and the Rights of Labor chaired by La Follette.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=214\u201323}} Better known as the \"[[La Follette Committee]]\", the subcommittee held extensive hearings for five years and published numerous reports.  The committee uncovered extensive evidence of millions of company dollars used to pay for spies and [[fifth column]]ists within unions, exposed the culpability of local law enforcement in acts of violence and murder against union supporters (particularly in the [[Harlan County War]]),{{sfn|Baker|Stack|2006|pp=56\u201357}} revealed the wide extent of illegal [[blacklisting]] of union members, and exposed the use of armed [[strikebreaker]]s and widespread stockpiling of tear gas, vomit gas, machine guns, mortars, and armor by corporations to use against [[Strike action|strikers]].{{sfn|Luff|2007|p=774}} Some of the evidence the committee used was provided by the Economic Division,{{sfn|Lambert|2005|p=90}} and the investigation proved critical for a time in defending the agency from business and congressional attack.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=214\u201323}}\n\nThe biggest issue the NLRB faced was constitutional. The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] and NLRB legal staff wanted the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] to rule as quickly as possible on the constitutionality of the NLRA. But the Board and Justice Department also realized that the Court's [[Lochner era|''Lochner'' era]] legal philosophy made it unlikely for the Court to uphold the Act. Subsequently, Madden strove to resolve minor cases before they could become court challenges, and worked to delay appeals as long as possible until the best possible case could be brought to the Court.{{sfn|Chasse|2011|p=57}} This legal strategy paid off. The Supreme Court upheld the NLRA in ''[[National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation]]'', 301 U.S. 1 (1937).{{sfn|Bernstein|Piven|1969|pp=643\u201346}} Afterward, Madden continued to strategically guide the NLRB's legal efforts to strengthen the federal courts' view of the NLRA and the board's actions.{{sfn|Chasse|2011|p=57}} Because of the efforts of Madden and NLRB General Counsel Charles H. Fahy, the Supreme Court reviewed only 27 cases between August 1935 and March 1941, even though the board had processed nearly 5,000 cases since its inception. The Supreme Court enforced the NLRB's rulings in 19 cases without modifying them, enforced them with modification in six more, and denied enforcement in two cases. Additionally, the Board won all 30 [[injunction]] and all 16 representation cases before the lower courts, a rate of success unequalled by any other federal agency.{{sfn|Bernstein|Piven|1969|pp=662\u201363}}\n\nAFL opposition to the \"Madden Board\" grew after decisions in ''Shipowners' Ass'n of the Pacific Coast'', 7 NLRB 1002 (1938), ''enf'd'' ''[[American Federation of Labor v. National Labor Relations Board]]'', 308 U.S. 401 (1940) (awarding a longshoremen's unit to the CIO rather than the AFL), and ''American Can Co.'', 13 NLRB 1252 (1939) (unit's history of collective bargaining outweighs desire of workers to form craft-only unit).<ref>{{harvnb|Bernstein|Piven|1969|pp=654\u201355}} The AFL held to a philosophy of [[craft unionism]], while the CIO believed in [[industrial unionism]]. According to the AFL, ''American Can'' decisively tipped NLRB policy in favor of the CIO.</ref>\n\nThe AFL began pushing for an investigation into the NLRB, and this investigation led to allegations of communist influence within the agency. In June 1938, the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (led by Chairman [[Martin Dies, Jr.]] [D-[[Texas|TX]]]) heard testimony from AFL leader [[John P. Frey]], who accused Madden of staffing the NLRB with [[Communism|communists]].<ref>\"Reds Start Count of Allies in Federal Jobs and Push Participation in C.I.O., Frey Says.\" ''New York Times.''

Report Asks NLRB Power Be Cut.\" ''New York Times.'' October 10, 1938.</ref> The allegations were true, in at least one case: [[Nathan Witt]], the NLRB's executive secretary and the man to whom Madden had delegated most administrative functions, was a member of the [[Communist Party of the United States]].{{sfn|Bernstein|Piven|1969|p=667}}{{sfn|Storrs|2013|p=65}} These allegations and discoveries significantly damaged the agency's support in Congress and with the public.\n\nA second investigation into the [[NLRB]] led to organizational changes at the board. On July 20, 1939, Republicans and conservative Democrats formed a coalition to push through the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] a resolution establishing a Special Committee to Investigate the National Labor Relations Board (the \"[[J. Warren Madden#The Smith Committee|Smith Committee]]\"), chaired by conservative, anti-labor Rep. [[Howard W. Smith]] (D-[[Virginia|VA]]).{{sfn|Gross|1981|pp=151\u201354}}{{sfn|Bernstein|Piven|1969|p=668}} On March 7, 1940, the Smith Committee proposed legislation to abolish the NLRB, reconstitute it, and radically amend the NLRA.{{sfn|Gross|1981|pp=194\u201399}}<ref>Among the changes proposed:  Removing of many of the guarantees of collective bargaining from the Wagner Act's preamble, denying legal protection to [[sitdown strike]]rs and agricultural workers, removing the requirement that employers must bargain with unions, making the General Counsel independent from the Board, abolishing the board's economic research unit, enhancing employer free speech rights, introducing the right of employers to seek an election among their workers, and removing the board's authority to engage in bargaining unit determination.

On November 15, 1940, President Roosevelt nominated [[Harry A. Millis]] to the NLRB and named him Chairman, and nominated Madden to a seat on the U.S. Court of Claims.<ref>\"Dr. Millis Slated to Head the NLRB.\" ''New York Times.''

November 16, 1940.</ref>\n\n===1940\u20131945: The Economics Division and World War II===\nAnother major structural change occurred at the same time that Madden left the NLRB. The Smith committee's anti-communist drive also targeted David J. Saposs, the NLRB Chief Industrial Economist. Saposs had been surreptitiously assessed by members of the Communist Party USA for membership, and rejected as a prospect.{{sfn|Gross|1974|p=220}} But Smith and others attacked Saposs as a communist, and Congress defunded his division and his job on October 11, 1940.{{sfn|Gross|1981|pp=199, 202}}{{sfn|Jacobs|2007|pp=171\u201372}}{{sfn|Chasse|2011|p=58}} Although the Smith committee's investigation proved critical, the disestablishment of the Economic Division was due to many reasons\u2014both internal and external to the NLRB, and only some of which involved allegations of communist infiltration. As historian James A. Gross observed:.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=264}}\n<blockquote>The Division was eliminated for all kinds of reasons which had nothing to do with the merits and importance of its work:  political pressures and maneuverings, jealousy and empire building between and among lawyers and economists inside the Board, opposition to leftist ideologies, a personal attack on the Chief Economist, David Saposs, and a mighty hostility to the administrative process.</blockquote>\n\nThe loss of the Economic Division was a major blow to the NLRB.  It had a major tactical impact: Economic data helped the NLRB fulfill its adjudicatorial and prosecutorial work in areas such as [[unfair labor practice]]s (ULPs), representation elections, and in determining remedial actions (such as reinstatement, back pay awards, and fines).{{sfn|Stryker|1989|pp=346\u201347}} Economic data also undermined employer resistance to the agency by linking that opposition to employer ULPs.{{sfn|Stryker|1989|p=349}} The loss also left the board dependent on the biased information offered by the parties in dispute before it, leading to poor decision-making and far less success in the courts.{{sfn|Gross|1981|pp=266\u201367}} It also had a major strategic impact: It left the board unable to determine whether its administration of the law was effective or not.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=265}} Nor could the board determine whether labor unrest was a serious threat to the economy or not. As [[Labor history (discipline)|labor historian]] Josiah Bartlett Lambert put it: \"Without the Economic Research Division, the NLRB could not undertake empirical studies to determine the actual impact of [[Secondary action|secondary boycotts]], [[jurisdictional strike]]s, national emergency strikes, and the like.\"{{sfn|Lambert|2005|p=104}} The Economic Division was critical to a long-range NLRB process to lead to the long-term evolution of industrial labor relations in the U.S., but that goal had to be abandoned.{{sfn|Eisner|2000|p=101}}{{sfn|Eisner|2010|pp=336\u201337}} Most importantly, however, the evisceration of the Economic Division struck at the fundamental purpose of federal labor law, which was to allow experts to adjudicate labor disputes rather than use a legal process. With this data and analysis, widespread skepticism about the board's expertise quickly spread through Congress and the courts.  It also left the board largely unable to engage in rule-making, forcing it to make labor law on an inefficient, time-consuming case-by-case basis.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=266}} As of 1981, NLRB was still the only federal agency forbidden to seek economic information about the impact of its activities.{{sfn|Gross|1981|pp=264\u201365}}\n\nThe second Chairman of the NLRB, [[Harry A. Millis]], led the board in a much more moderate direction.{{sfn|Lambert|2005|p=104}} Lacking an economic division to give it ammunition to fight with Millis deliberately made the NLRB dependent on Congress and the executive branch for its survival.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=261}} Millis made a large number of organizational changes. He stripped the office of Secretary of its power, set up an Administrative Division to supervise the 22 regional offices, initiated a study of the Board's administrative procedures, and genuinely delegated power to the regional offices.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=229}} He removed casehandling and regional office communication from the jurisdiction of the Office of the Secretary and created a Field Division.{{sfn|Tomlins|1985|p=225}}<ref>Stark, Louis. \"Methods of NLRB Indicated in Study Made By Own Men.\" New York Times. March 22, 1940.</ref> He also adopted procedures requiring the board made its decisions based solely on the trial examiner's report, authorized NLRB review attorneys to review trial examiner report, required decisions to be drafted ahead of time and distributed for review, authorized review attorneys to revise drafts before a final decision was issued, required trial examiners to emphasize findings of fact and to address points of law, and began holding board meetings when there were differences of opinion over decisions.{{sfn|Tomlins|1985|p=225}}\n\nMillis eliminated the Review Division's decisive role in cases, which had been established under Madden and Witt.{{sfn|Tomlins|1985|p=226}} Madden and Witt had adopted a highly centralized Board structure so that (generally speaking) only the cases most favorable to the board made it to the courts. The centralized structure meant that only the strongest cases made it to national board, so that the board could apply all its economic and legal powers to crafting the best decision possible. This strategy enabled the NLRB to defend itself very well before the Supreme Court. But Madden and Witt had held on to the centralized strategy too long, and made political enemies in the process. Millis substituted a decentralized process in which the board was less a decision-maker and more a provider of services to the regions.{{sfn|Tomlins|1985|p=226}} Many of the changes Millis instituted were designed to mimic requirements placed on other agencies by the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]].{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=264}}\n\nAmerican entry into World War II on December 8, 1941, significantly changed the NLRB. On January 12, 1942, President Roosevelt created the [[National War Labor Board (1942\u20131945)|National War Labor Board]] (NWLB), which displaced the NLRB as the main focus of federal labor relations for the duration of the war. The NWLB was given the authority to \"finally determine\" any labor dispute which threatened to interrupt war production, and to stabilize union wages and benefits during the war. Although Roosevelt instructed the NWLB not to intrude on jurisdiction exercised by the NLRB, the War Labor Board refused to honor this request. From 1942 to 1945, Millis tried to secure a jurisdictional agreement with NWLB Chairman George W. Taylor. But these discussions proved fruitless, and Millis broke them off in June 1945. The NWLB also heavily raided the NLRB for staff, significantly hindering NLRB operations.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=243}}\n\nAdditional changes came with the passage of the [[War Labor Disputes Act]] (WLDA) on June 25, 1943. Enacted over Roosevelt's veto after 400,000 coal miners, their wages significantly lower due to high wartime inflation, struck for a $2-a-day wage increase,{{sfn|Malsberger|2000|p=104}}{{sfn|Karatnycky|2000|p=115}} the legislation (in part) required the NLRB to issue a ballot outlining all the collective bargaining proposals and counter-proposals, wait 30 days, and then hold a strike vote.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=244}} The War Labor Disputes Act proved very burdensome.  The NLRB processed 2,000 WLDA cases from 1943 to the end of 1945, of which 500 were strike votes. The act's strike vote procedures did little to stop strikes, however, and Millis feared unions were using the referendums to whip up pro-strike feelings among their members. Millis also believed the law's strike vote process permitted more strikes to occur than the NLRB would have allowed under its old procedures. There were so many strike vote filings in the six months after the war ended that NLRB actually shut down its long distance telephone lines, cancelled all out of town travel, suspended all public hearings, and suspended all other business to accommodate the workload.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=245}} By early 1945, Millis was in ill health.<ref>\"Dr. H.A. Millis Dies.\" ''New York Times.'' June 26, 1948.</ref>  He resigned from the NLRB on June 7, 1945,<ref>\"In Administration Shake-Up\", ''Associated Press,'' June 8, 1945.</ref> and [[Paul M. Herzog]] was named his successor.\n\n===1947\u20131965: Taft-Hartley===\nA major turning point in the history of the NLRB came in 1947 with passage of the [[Taft-Hartley Act]]. Disruptions caused by strikes during World War II as well as the huge wave of strikes that followed the end of the war fueled a growing movement in 1946 and 1947 to amend the NLRA to correct what critics saw as a pro-labor tilt in federal law.<ref>Stark, Louis. \"Save Bargaining, Keep Peace In Industry, Says NLRB Head.\" ''New York Times.'' March 7, 1947.</ref>{{sfn|Gross|1981|pp=251\u201352}} Drafted by the powerful Republican Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] and the strongly anti-union Representative [[Fred A. Hartley, Jr.]], the Taft-Hartley Act banned jurisdictional strikes, [[Wildcat strike action|wildcat strikes]], political strikes, [[Secondary action|secondary boycotts]], secondary picketing, mass picketing, union campaign donations made from dues money, the [[closed shop]], and unions of supervisors. The act also enumerated new employer rights, defined union-committed ULPs, gave states the right to opt out of federal labor law through [[right-to-work law]]s, required unions to give an 80-days' strike notice in all cases, established procedures for the President to end a strike in a national emergency, and required all union officials to sign an anti-Communist oath. Organizationally, the act made the General Counsel a presidential appointee, independent of the board itself, and gave the General Counsel limited powers to seek injunctions without referring to the Justice Department. It also banned the NLRB from engaging in any mediation or conciliation, and formally enshrined in law the ban on hiring personnel to do economic data collection or analysis.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=264}}\n\nIn August 1947, [[Robert N. Denham]] became the NRLB's [[general counsel]]. He held \"conservative views\" and wielded \"considerable influence\" on labor-management relations and interpretations of the newly passed [[Taft-Hartley Act]]. In 1950, US President [[Harry S.

He felt the communist oath provisions were unconstitutional, that the amendments would turn the NLRA into a management weapon, that creation of an independent General Counsel would weaken the NLRB, and that the law's dismantling of the agency's economic analysis unit deprived the NLRB of essential expertise.{{sfn|Gross|2010|pp=11\u201313}} Nonetheless, Congress overrode Truman's veto of the Taft-Hartley Act on June 23, 1947, and the bill became law.{{sfn|Lee|1980|pp=101\u201303}}\n\nThe Taft-Hartley Act fundamentally changed the nature of federal labor law, but it also seriously hindered the NLRB's ability to enforce the law. The loss of the mediation function left the NLRB unable to become involved in labor disputes, a function it had engaged in since its inception as the National Labor Board in 1933. This hindered the agency's efforts to study, analyze, and create bulwarks against [[Good faith|bad-faith]] [[collective bargaining]]; reduced its ability to formulate national labor policy in this area; and left the agency making labor law on an ineffective, time-consuming case-by-case basis.{{sfn|Lambert|2005|p=104}} The separation of the General Counsel from supervision by the national board also had significant impact on the agency. This separation was enacted against the advice of the Justice Department, contradicted the policy Congress had enacted in the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946, and ignored Millis' extensive internal reforms. The change left the NLRB as the only federal agency unable to coordinate its decision-making and legal activities, and the only agency exempted in this manner under the Administrative Procedure Act. The separation of the General Counsel was not discussed by the committee or by any witnesses during the legislation's mark-up. Indeed, there was no basis for it at all in the public record.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=264}} It was, in the words of sociologist Robin Stryker, \"little-noted\" and \"unprecedented\".{{sfn|Stryker|1989|p=344}}\n\nThe anti-communist oath provisions generated extensive public debate, and generated disputes before the Supreme Court several times. The Taft-Hartley oath first reached the court in [[American Communications Ass'n v. Douds]], {{Ussc|339|382|1950|el=no}}, in which the court held 5-to-1 that the oath did not violate the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], was not an ''[[ex post facto]]'' law or [[bill of attainder]] in violation of [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|Article One, Section 10]], and was not a \"test oath\" in violation of [[Article Six of the United States Constitution#Oaths|Article Six]]. The issue again came before the court in [[Garner v. Board of Public Works]], {{Ussc|341|716|1951|el=no}}, in which the court unanimously held that a municipal [[loyalty oath]] was not an ''ex post facto law'' or bill of attainder. It came before the court yet a third time in ''Wieman v. Updegraff'', {{Ussc|344|183|1952|el=no}}. This time, the outcome was radically different. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that state loyalty oath legislation violated the [[due process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. In 1965, the Supreme Court held 5-to-4 that the anti-communist oath was a bill of attainder in ''[[United States v. Brown (1965)|United States v. Brown]]'', {{Ussc|381|437|1965|el=no}}.<ref>\"Beyond Process: A Substantive Rationale for the Bill of Attainder Clause.\" ''Virginia Law Review.''

In broad terms, the General Counsel is responsible for investigating and prosecuting [[unfair labor practice]] claims and for the general supervision of the NLRB field offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlrb.gov/who-we-are/general-counsel|title=The General Counsel - NLRB|website=www.nlrb.gov}}</ref> The General Counsel is appointed by the President to a four-year term and independent from the Board; it has limited independence to argue for a change in the law in presenting cases to the Board. The General Counsel oversees four divisions: the Division of Operations Management, the Division of Administration, the Division of Advice, and the Division of Enforcement Litigation.\n\nThe Board, on the other hand, is the adjudicative body that decides the unfair labor practice cases brought to it. Once the Board has decided the issue, it is the General Counsel's responsibility to uphold the Board's decision, even if it is contrary to the position it advocated when presenting the case to the Board. The Board is also responsible for the administration of the Act's provisions governing the holding of elections and resolution of jurisdictional disputes.\n\nThe Board has more than thirty regional offices. The regional offices conduct elections, investigate unfair labor practice charges, and make the initial determination on those charges (whether to dismiss, settle, or issue complaints). The Board has jurisdiction to hold elections and prosecute violations of the Act in [[Puerto Rico]] and [[American Samoa]].\n\n===Jurisdiction===\nThe Board's [[jurisdiction]] is limited to [[private sector]] employees and the [[United States Postal Service]]; other than Postal Service employees, it has no authority over labor relations disputes involving governmental, [[railroad]] and [[airline]] employees covered by the [[Adamson Railway Labor Act]], or agricultural employees. On the other hand, in those parts of the private sector its jurisdictional standards are low enough to reach almost all employers whose business has any appreciable impact on [[interstate commerce]].\n\n===Processing of charges===\nCharges are filed by parties against unions or employers with the appropriate regional office. The regional office will investigate the complaint. If a violation is believed to exist, the region will take the case before an [[Administrative Law Judge]] who will conduct a hearing. The decision of the Administrative Law Judge may be reviewed by the five member Board. Board decisions are reviewable by [[United States Courts of Appeals]]. The Board's decisions are not self-executing: it must seek court enforcement in order to force a recalcitrant party to comply with its orders.

The follow-up to his breakthrough ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', it was the first album he wrote and released from a position of stardom.<ref name=carrmurr1>{{cite book |title=David Bowie: An Illustrated Record |last=Carr |first=Roy |authorlink=Roy Carr |author2=[[Charles Shaar Murray|Murray, Charles Shaar]] |year=1981 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=0-380-77966-8 |pages=52\u201356}}</ref> It was produced by Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] and features contributions from Bowie's backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. It was recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London and RCA Studios in New York City between legs of the [[Ziggy Stardust Tour]]. The album features a tougher and raunchier [[glam rock]] sound than its predecessor. The album cover, featuring a lightning bolt across Bowie's face, is regarded as one of his most iconic images.\n\nPreceded by the singles \"[[The Jean Genie]]\" and \"[[Drive-In Saturday]]\", ''Aladdin Sane'' was Bowie's most commercially successful record up to that point, peaking at No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and No. 17 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album also received positive reviews from music critics, although many found it to be inferior to its predecessor. It has since been regarded by Bowie biographers as one of his essential albums. In 2003, the album was ranked among six Bowie entries on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 greatest albums of all time]] (at No. 277), and No. 279 in a 2012 revised list. It was later ranked No. 77 on [[Pitchfork Media]]'s list of the top 100 albums of the 1970s. Songs from the album were performed frequently by Bowie on the Ziggy Stardust and [[Diamond Dogs Tour]]. The album has since been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2013 for its 40th anniversary, which was included on the box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' in 2015.\n\n== \"Ziggy goes to America\" ==\nThe name of the album is a pun on \"A Lad Insane\". An early variation was \"Love Aladdin Vein\", which David Bowie dropped partly because of its drug connotations.<ref name=pegg2>{{cite book |title=The Complete David Bowie |last=Pegg |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Pegg |year=2004 |origyear=2000 |publisher=Reynolds & Hearn Ltd |location=London |isbn=1-903111-73-0 |pages=20\u201321}}</ref> Although technically a new Bowie 'character', Aladdin Sane was essentially a development of [[David Bowie#Ziggy Stardust|Ziggy Stardust]] in his appearance and persona, as evidenced on the cover by [[Brian Duffy (photographer)|Brian Duffy]] and in Bowie's live performances throughout 1973 that culminated in Ziggy's 'retirement' at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in July that year. Lacking the thematic flow found on its predecessor,<ref>[[Kris Needs]] (1983) ''Bowie: A Celebration'': p.29</ref> ''Aladdin Sane'' was described by Bowie himself as simply \"Ziggy goes to America\"; most of the tracks were observations he composed on the road during his [[Ziggy Stardust Tour]], which accounted for the place names following each song title on the original record labels.<ref name=carrmurr1 /> Biographer Christopher Sandford believed the album showed that Bowie \"was simultaneously appalled and fixated by America\".<ref name=\"Loving the Alien\">Christopher Sandford (1996, 1997). ''Loving the Alien'': p.109</ref>\n\nHis mixed feelings about the journey stemmed, in Bowie's words, from \"wanting to be up on the stage performing my songs, but on the other hand not really wanting to be on those buses with all those strange people&nbsp;... So ''Aladdin Sane'' was split down the middle.\"<ref name=\"pegg2806\">Pegg, Nicholas (2006). The Complete David Bowie (4th ed.).

The follow-up to his breakthrough ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', it was the first album he wrote and released from a position of stardom.<ref name=carrmurr1>{{cite book |title=David Bowie: An Illustrated Record |last=Carr |first=Roy |authorlink=Roy Carr |author2=[[Charles Shaar Murray|Murray, Charles Shaar]] |year=1981 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=0-380-77966-8 |pages=52\u201356}}</ref> It was produced by Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] and features contributions from Bowie's backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. It was recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London and RCA Studios in New York City between legs of the [[Ziggy Stardust Tour]]. The album features a tougher and raunchier [[glam rock]] sound than its predecessor. The album cover featuring a lightning bolt across Bowie's face is regarded as one of his most iconic images.\n\nPreceded by the lead single \"[[The Jean Genie]]\", ''Aladdin Sane'' was Bowie's most commercially successful record up to that point, peaking at No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and No. 17 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album also received positive reviews from music critics, although many found it to be inferior to its predecessor. It has since been regarded by Bowie biographers as one of his essential albums. In 2003, the album was ranked among six Bowie entries on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 greatest albums of all time]] (at No. 277), and No. 279 in a 2012 revised list. It was later ranked No. 77 on [[Pitchfork Media]]'s list of the top 100 albums of the 1970s. Songs from the album were performed frequently by Bowie on the Ziggy Stardust and [[Diamond Dogs Tour]]. The album has since been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2013 for its 40th anniversary, which was included on the box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' in 2015.\n\n== \"Ziggy goes to America\" ==\nThe name of the album is a pun on \"A Lad Insane\". An early variation was \"Love Aladdin Vein\", which David Bowie dropped partly because of its drug connotations.<ref name=pegg2>{{cite book |title=The Complete David Bowie |last=Pegg |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Pegg |year=2004 |origyear=2000 |publisher=Reynolds & Hearn Ltd |location=London |isbn=1-903111-73-0 |pages=20\u201321}}</ref> Although technically a new Bowie 'character', Aladdin Sane was essentially a development of [[David Bowie#Ziggy Stardust|Ziggy Stardust]] in his appearance and persona, as evidenced on the cover by [[Brian Duffy (photographer)|Brian Duffy]] and in Bowie's live performances throughout 1973 that culminated in Ziggy's 'retirement' at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in July that year. Lacking the thematic flow found on its predecessor,<ref>[[Kris Needs]] (1983) ''Bowie: A Celebration'': p.29</ref> ''Aladdin Sane'' was described by Bowie himself as simply \"Ziggy goes to America\"; most of the tracks were observations he composed on the road during his [[Ziggy Stardust Tour]], which accounted for the place names following each song title on the original record labels.<ref name=carrmurr1 /> Biographer Christopher Sandford believed the album showed that Bowie \"was simultaneously appalled and fixated by America\".<ref name=\"Loving the Alien\">Christopher Sandford (1996, 1997). ''Loving the Alien'': p.109</ref>\n\nHis mixed feelings about the journey stemmed, in Bowie's words, from \"wanting to be up on the stage performing my songs, but on the other hand not really wanting to be on those buses with all those strange people&nbsp;... So ''Aladdin Sane'' was split down the middle.\"<ref name=\"pegg2806\">Pegg, Nicholas (2006). The Complete David Bowie (4th ed.).

Both numbers were dominated by [[Mike Garson]]'s acclaimed piano work,<ref name=buckstrange1 /> which also featured heavily in the faux [[James Bond]] flamenco ballad \"[[Lady Grinning Soul]]\", inspired by singer [[Claudia Lennear]].<ref name=carrmurr1 />\n\n== Singles ==\nTwo hit singles that would be included on the album preceded its release, \"[[The Jean Genie]]\" and \"[[Drive-In Saturday]]\".

The act was passed in 1830, although dialogue had been ongoing since 1802 between Georgia and the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] concerning such an event. Ethan Davis states that \"the federal government had promised Georgia that it would extinguish Indian title within the state's borders by purchase 'as soon as such purchase could be made upon reasonable terms'\".<ref>{{cite journal | title=An Administrative Trail of Tears: Indian Removal | authorlink= | last= Davis | first= Ethan | journal= The American Journal of Legal History|volume=50|issue=1 | pages= 50\u201355}}</ref> As time passed, southern states began to speed up the process by posing the argument that the deal between Georgia and the federal government had no contract and that southern states could pass the law themselves. This scheme forced the national government to pass the Indian Removal Act on May 28, 1830, in which President Jackson agreed to divide the United States territory west of the Mississippi into districts for tribes to replace the land from which they were removed.\n\nIn the 1823 case of ''[[Johnson v. M'Intosh]]'', the [[United States Supreme Court]] handed down a decision stating that Indians could occupy and control lands within the United States but could not hold title to those lands.<ref name=\"pbsremoval\">{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2959.html| title=Indial Removal 1814\u20131858| publisher=Public Broadcasting System| accessdate=2009-08-11}}</ref> Jackson viewed the union as a [[Federalism|federation of highly esteemed states]], as was common before the [[American Civil War]]. He opposed Washington's policy of establishing treaties with Indian tribes as if they were foreign nations. Thus, the creation of Indian jurisdictions was a violation of state sovereignty under [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#New states|Article IV, Section 3]] of the Constitution. As Jackson saw it, either Indians comprised sovereign states (which violated the Constitution) or they were subject to the laws of existing states of the Union. Jackson urged Indians to assimilate and obey state laws. Further, he believed that he could only accommodate the desire for Indian self-rule in federal territories, which required resettlement west of the Mississippi River on federal lands.<ref>{{cite book | title=Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times| authorlink=H.W.

Many Americans during this time favored its passage, but there was also significant opposition. Many Christian [[missionary|missionaries]] protested against it, most notably missionary organizer [[Jeremiah Evarts]]. In Congress, [[New Jersey]] Senator [[Theodore Frelinghuysen]] and [[Tennessee]] Congressman [[Davy Crockett]] spoke out against the legislation. The Removal Act passed only after bitter debate in Congress.<ref>Howe pp. 348\u201352.</ref>\n\nJackson viewed the demise of Indian tribal nations as inevitable, pointing to the advancement of settled life and demise of tribal nations in the American northeast. He called his northern critics hypocrites, given the [[Northern United States|North]]'s history. There were almost no Native American tribes, Indian hunting grounds had been replaced with family farms, and state law had replaced tribal law. If the Indians of the south were to survive and their culture be maintained, they faced powerful historical forces that could only be postponed. He dismissed romantic portrayals of lost Indian culture as a sentimental longing for a simpler time in the past, stating that \"progress requires moving forward.\"<ref name=b489>Brands; (2006); pp. 489\u201393</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Humanity has often wept over the fate of the aborigines of this country and philanthropy has long been busily employed in devising means to avert it, but its progress has never for a moment been arrested, and one by one have many powerful tribes disappeared from the earth...But true philanthropy reconciles the mind to these vicissitudes as it does to the extinction of one generation to make room for another...In the monuments and fortresses of an unknown people, spread over the extensive regions of the West, we behold the memorials of a once powerful race, which was exterminated or has disappeared to make room for the existing savage tribes...Philanthropy could not wish to see this continent restored to the condition in which it was found by our forefathers. What good man would prefer a country covered with forests and ranged by a few thousand savages to our extensive Republic, studded with cities, towns, and prosperous farms, embellished with all the improvements which art can devise or industry execute, occupied by more than 12,000,000 happy people, and filled with all the blessings of liberty, civilization, and religion?<ref>Brands; (2006); p. 490</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/~lmg21/BC3180/removal.html| title=Statements from the Debate on Indian Removal| publisher=Columbia University| accessdate=March 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Native American Voices: A History and Anthology|editor=Steven Mintz|volume=2|publisher=Brandywine Press|year=1995|pages=115\u201316}}</ref></blockquote>One particularly avid supporter was Louis Sarwal.\n\nAccording to historian [[H. W. Brands]], Jackson sincerely believed that his [[population transfer]] was a \"wise and humane policy\" that would save the Indians from \"utter annihilation\".

The act was passed in 1830, although dialogue had been ongoing since 1802 between Georgia and the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] concerning such an event. Ethan Davis states that \"the federal government had promised Georgia that it would extinguish Indian title within the state's borders by purchase 'as soon as such purchase could be made upon reasonable terms'\".<ref>{{cite journal | title=An Administrative Trail of Tears: Indian Removal | authorlink= | last= Davis | first= Ethan | journal= The American Journal of Legal History|volume=50|issue=1 | pages= 50\u201355}}</ref> As time passed, southern states began to speed up the process by posing the argument that the deal between Georgia and the federal government had no contract and that southern states could pass the law themselves. This scheme forced the national government to pass the Indian Removal Act on May 28, 1830, in which President Jackson agreed to divide the United States territory west of the Mississippi into districts for tribes to replace the land from which they were removed.\n\nIn the 1823 case of ''[[Johnson v.

He opposed Washington's policy of establishing treaties with Indian tribes as if they were foreign nations. Thus, the creation of Indian jurisdictions was a violation of state sovereignty under [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#New states|Article IV, Section 3]] of the Constitution. As Jackson saw it, either Indians comprised sovereign states (which violated the Constitution) or they were subject to the laws of existing states of the Union. Jackson urged Indians to assimilate and obey state laws. Further, he believed that he could only accommodate the desire for Indian self-rule in federal territories, which required resettlement west of the Mississippi River on federal lands.<ref>{{cite book | title=Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times| authorlink=H.W.

He called his northern critics hypocrites, given the [[Northern United States|North]]'s history. There were almost no Native American tribes, Indian hunting grounds had been replaced with family farms, and state law had replaced tribal law. If the Indians of the south were to survive and their culture be maintained, they faced powerful historical forces that could only be postponed. He dismissed romantic portrayals of lost Indian culture as a sentimental longing for a simpler time in the past, stating that \"progress requires moving forward.\"<ref name=b489>Brands; (2006); pp. 489\u201393</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Humanity has often wept over the fate of the aborigines of this country and philanthropy has long been busily employed in devising means to avert it, but its progress has never for a moment been arrested, and one by one have many powerful tribes disappeared from the earth...But true philanthropy reconciles the mind to these vicissitudes as it does to the extinction of one generation to make room for another...In the monuments and fortresses of an unknown people, spread over the extensive regions of the West, we behold the memorials of a once powerful race, which was exterminated or has disappeared to make room for the existing savage tribes...Philanthropy could not wish to see this continent restored to the condition in which it was found by our forefathers.

[[Glucose]] or [[glycerol]] are often used as carbon sources, and [[ammonium]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s or [[nitrate]]s as [[inorganic]] nitrogen sources. An undefined medium has some complex ingredients, such as [[yeast extract]] or casein hydrolysate, which consist of a mixture of many chemical species in unknown proportions.  Undefined media are sometimes chosen based on price and sometimes by necessity \u2013 some microorganisms have never been cultured on defined media.\n\nA good example of a growth medium is the [[wort (brewing)|wort]] used to make [[beer]]. The wort contains all the nutrients required for yeast growth, and under [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] conditions, alcohol is produced. When the [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] process is complete, the combination of medium and dormant microbes, now beer, is ready for consumption.\nThe main types are \n*Cultural media\n*Minimal media\n*Selective media\n*Differential media \n*Transport media \n*Indicator media\n\n=== Culture media ===\n\nCulture media contain all the elements that most bacteria need for growth and are not selective, so they are used for the general cultivation and maintenance of bacteria kept in laboratory culture collections.\n\n[[File:Physcomitrella growing on agar plates.jpg|thumb|''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'' plants growing [[axenic]]ally on agar plates ([[Petri dish]], 9&nbsp;cm diameter)]]\n\nAn undefined medium (also known as a basal or complex medium) contains:\n* a carbon source such as Glucose \n* water\n* various salts \n* a source of amino acids and nitrogen (e.g., beef, yeast extract)\n** This is an undefined medium because the amino-acid source contains a variety of compounds with the exact composition being unknown.\n\nA defined medium (also known as [[chemically defined medium]] or synthetic medium) is a medium in which\n* all the chemicals used are known\n* no yeast, animal, or plant tissue is present\n\nSome examples of nutrient media include:\n* [[Plate count agar]]\n* [[Nutrient agar]]\n* [[Trypticase soy agar]]\n\n=== Minimal media ===\nA defined medium that has just enough  ingredients to support growth is called a '''Minimal Medium.''' The number of ingredients that must be added to a minimal medium varies enormously depending on which microorganism is being grown.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Microbiology|last=Catherine A. Ingraham|first=John L. Ingraham|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>Minimal media are those that contain the minimum nutrients possible for colony growth, generally without the presence of amino acids, and are often used by microbiologists and geneticists to grow \"wild-type\" microorganisms.  Minimal media can also be used to select for or against [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]]s or [[exconjugant]]s.\n\nMinimal medium typically contains:\n* a carbon source, which may be a sugar such as glucose, or a less energy-rich source such as [[succinate]]\n* various salts, which may vary among bacteria species and growing conditions; these generally provide essential elements such as [[magnesium]], [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[sulfur]] to allow the bacteria to synthesize [[protein]] and [[nucleic acid]]s\n* water\n\nSupplementary minimal media are  minimal media that also contains a single selected agent, usually an amino acid or a sugar.

For example, if a microorganism is resistant to a certain [[antibiotic]], such as [[ampicillin]] or [[tetracycline]], then that antibiotic can be added to the medium to prevent other cells, which do not possess the resistance, from growing. Media lacking an amino acid such as [[proline]] in conjunction with [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']] unable to synthesize it were commonly used by geneticists before the emergence of [[genomics]] to [[Chromosome map|map]] bacterial chromosomes.\n\nSelective growth media are also used in [[cell culture]] to ensure the survival or proliferation of cells with certain properties, such as [[antibiotic resistance]] or the ability to synthesize a certain [[metabolite]]. Normally, the presence of a specific [[gene]] or an [[allele]] of a gene confers upon the cell the ability to grow in the selective medium. In such cases, the gene is termed a [[Genetic marker|marker]].\n\nSelective growth media for [[eukaryotic]] cells commonly contain [[neomycin]] to select cells that have been successfully [[Transfection|transfected]] with a plasmid carrying the neomycin resistance gene as a marker. [[Gancyclovir]] is an exception to the rule, as it is used to specifically kill cells that carry its respective marker, the [[Herpes simplex virus]] thymidine kinase (HSV TK).\n\n[[File:Agarplates.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Four types of agar plate demonstrating differential growth depending on bacterial metabolism]]\n\nExamples of selective media include:\n* [[Eosin methylene blue]]  contains dyes that are toxic for Gram-positive bacteria.
