It is also known as the \"Persian Longhair\" in the [[English-speaking countries]]. In the [[Middle East]] region, they are widely known as \"Shirazi cats\" and in Iran they are known as \"[[Shiraz]] cat\".

Some cat fancier organizations' [[breed standards]] subsume the [[Himalayan cat|Himalayan]] and [[Exotic Shorthair]] as variants of this breed, while others treat them as separate breeds.\n\nThe [[selective breeding]] carried out by breeders has allowed the development of a wide variety of coat colors, but has also led to the creation of increasingly [[Cephalic index in cats and dogs|flat-faced]] Persians. Favored by fanciers, this head structure can bring with it a number of health problems. As is the case with the [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese]] breed, there have been efforts by some breeders to preserve the older type of cat, the ''traditional breed'', HELLO! having a more pronounced muzzle, which is more popular with the general public. Hereditary [[polycystic kidney disease]] is prevalent in the breed, affecting almost half the population in some countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://icatcare.org/advice/polycystic-kidney-disease|title=Polycystic kidney disease {{!}} International Cat Care|website=icatcare.org|access-date=2016-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/Health_Information/PolycysticKidneyDisease.cfm|title=Polycystic Kidney Disease|website=www.vet.cornell.edu|access-date=2016-07-08}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 it was ranked as the second most popular breed in the United States according to the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cfa.org/AboutCFA/News/PressReleases/PressRelease20160201Top10Breeds.aspx|title=Press Release February 1, 2016 - Top 10 Breeds for 2015|website=cfa.org|access-date=2016-07-08}}</ref> The first is the [[Exotic Shorthair|Exotic]] breed.\n\n==Origin==\nIt is not clear when long-haired cats first appeared, as there are no known long-haired specimens of the [[African wildcat]], the ancestor of the domestic subspecies.\n\n[[File:Persian aka Angora from 1894.JPG|thumb|left|An Angora/Persian from ''The Royal Natural History'' (1894)]]\n\nThe first documented ancestors of the Persian were imported from [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]], Iran, into Italy in 1620 by [[Pietro della Valle]], and from Angora (now [[Ankara]]), [[Ottoman Empire]] ([[Turkey]]), into France by [[Nicholas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc]] at around the same time.

Persian coats consist of a woolly under coat and a long, hairy outer coat. The coat loses all the thick underwool in the summer, and only the long hair remains. Hair on the shoulders and upper part of the hind legs is somewhat shorter. Conversely, the Angora has a very different coat which consists of long, soft hair, hanging in locks, \"inclining to a slight curl or wave on the under parts of the body.\" The Angora's hair is much longer on the shoulders and hind legs than the Persian, which Bell considered a great improvement. However, Bell says the Angora \"fails to the Persian in head,\" Angoras having a more wedge-shaped head and Persians having a rounder head.\n\nBell notes that Angoras and Persians have been crossbred, resulting in a decided improvement to each breed, but claimed the long-haired cat of 1909 had significantly more Persian influence than Angora.\n\nChampion lamented the lack of distinction among various long-haired types by English fanciers, who in 1887, decided to group them under the umbrella term \"Long-haired Cats\".<ref name=\"champion\"/><ref name=\"Helgren2\">{{cite web |last=Helgren|first=J.

Some organizations, including the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] (CFA), consider the peke-face type as their modern standard for the Persian breed.

The over-accentuation of the breed's characteristics by selective breeding (called ''extreme-'' or ''ultra-typing'') produced results similar to the peke-faced Persians. The term peke-face has been used to refer to the ultra-typed Persian but it is properly used only to refer to red and red tabby Persians bearing the mutation.

This is a type of face which is definitely recognized in the United States, and helps to form a special group within the show classification for the [Persian] breed. There are certainly disadvantages when the face has become too short, for this exaggeration of type is inclined to produce a deformity of the tear ducts, and running eyes may be the result. A cat with running eyes will never look at its best because in time the fur on each side of the nose becomes stained, and thus detracts from the general appearance [...] The nose should be short, but perhaps a plea may be made here that the nose is better if it is not too short and at the same time uptilted.

Persians with Himalayan ancestry has registration numbers starting with 3 and are commonly referred to by breeders as colorpoint carriers (CPC) or 3000-series cats, although not all will actually carry the recessive gene.

The [[crossbreed]] look gained recognition in the show ring, but other breeders unhappy with the changes successfully pushed for new breed standards that would disqualify ASH that showed signs of crossbreeding.\n\nOne ASH breeder who saw the potential of the Persian/ASH cross proposed, and eventually managed, to get the CFA to recognize them as a new breed in 1966, under the name [[Exotic Shorthair]]. Regular outcrossing to the Persian has made present-day Exotic Shorthair similar to the Persian in every way, including temperament and conformation, with the exception of the short dense coat. It has even inherited much of the Persian's health problems. The easier to manage coat has made some label the Exotic Shorthair \"the lazy person's Persian\".\n\nBecause of the regular use of Persians as outcrosses, some Exotics may carry a copy of the recessive longhair gene. When two such cats mate, there is a one in four chance of each offspring being longhaired. Longhaired Exotics are not considered Persians by CFA, although [[The International Cat Association]] accepts them as Persians.

Persian cats can have virtually any color or markings.\n\nThe Persian is generally described as a quiet cat. Typically placid in nature, it adapts quite well to apartment life. Himalayans tend to be more active due to the influence of Siamese traits. In a study comparing cat owner perceptions of their cats, Persians rated higher than non-pedigree cats on closeness and affection to owners, friendliness towards strangers, cleanliness, predictability, vocalization, and fussiness over food.<ref>{{cite book |last=Turner |first=D.

If classified as the Himalayan sub-breed, full [[point coloration]] is required, the fourth TICA color division, with a \"pale and creamy colored\" body even lighter than mink, with intense coloration on the face an extremities. The four TICA categories are essentially a graduated scale of color distribution from evenly colored to mostly colored only at the points.  Within each, the coloration may be further classified as solid, [[Tortoiseshell cat|tortoiseshell]] (or \"tortie\"), [[Tabby cat|tabby]], silver or smoke, solid-and-white, tortoiseshell-and-white, tabby-and-white, or silver/smoke-and-white, with various specific colors and modifiers (e.g. chocolate tortoiseshell point, or fawn shaded mink marbled tabby-torbie). TICA-recognized tabby patterns include classic, mackerel, marbled, spotted, and ticked (in two genetic forms), while other patterns include shaded, chinchilla, and two tabbie-tortie variations, golden, and grizzled.  Basic colors include white, black, brown, ruddy, bronze, \"blue\" (grey), chocolate, cinnamon, lilac, fawn, red, cream, with a silver or shaded variant of most. Not counting bi-color (piebald) or parti-color coats, nor combinations that are genetically impossible, there are nearly 1,000 named coat pattern variations in the TICA system for which the Persian/Himalayan qualifies.

As is the case with the [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese]] breed, there have been efforts by some breeders to preserve the older type of cat, the ''traditional breed'', having a more pronounced muzzle, which is more popular with the general public.

Persian coats consist of a woolly under coat and a long, hairy outer coat. The coat loses all the thick underwool in the summer, and only the long hair remains. Hair on the shoulders and upper part of the hind legs is somewhat shorter. Conversely, the Angora has a very different coat which consists of long, soft hair, hanging in locks, \"inclining to a slight curl or wave on the under parts of the body.\" The Angora's hair is much longer on the shoulders and hind legs than the Persian, which Bell considered a great improvement. However, Bell says the Angora \"fails to the Persian in head,\" Angoras having a more wedge-shaped head and Persians having a rounder head.\n\nBell notes that Angoras and Persians have been crossbred, resulting in a decided improvement to each breed, but claimed the long-haired cat of 1909 had significantly more Persian influence than Angora.\n\nChampion lamented the lack of distinction among various long-haired types by English fanciers, who in 1887, decided to group them under the umbrella term \"Long-haired Cats\".<ref name=\"champion\"/><ref name=\"Helgren2\">{{cite web |last=Helgren|first=J.

Some organizations, including the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] (CFA), consider the peke-face type as their modern standard for the Persian breed. Thus the [[retronym]] Traditional Persian was created to refer to the original type, which is still bred, mirroring the renaming of the original-style [[Siamese cat]] as the Traditional Siamese or [[Thai cat|Thai]], to distinguish it from the long-faced modern development which has taken over as simply \"the Siamese\".\n\nNot all cat fancier groups recognize the Traditional Persian (at all, or as distinct), or give it that specific name.

Despite this, breeders took a liking to the look and started breeding towards the peke-face look. The over-accentuation of the breed's characteristics by selective breeding (called ''extreme-'' or ''ultra-typing'') produced results similar to the peke-faced Persians. The term peke-face has been used to refer to the ultra-typed Persian but it is properly used only to refer to red and red tabby Persians bearing the mutation.

This is a type of face which is definitely recognized in the United States, and helps to form a special group within the show classification for the [Persian] breed. There are certainly disadvantages when the face has become too short, for this exaggeration of type is inclined to produce a deformity of the tear ducts, and running eyes may be the result. A cat with running eyes will never look at its best because in time the fur on each side of the nose becomes stained, and thus detracts from the general appearance [...] The nose should be short, but perhaps a plea may be made here that the nose is better if it is not too short and at the same time uptilted. A nose of this type creates an impression of grotesqueness which is not really attractive, and there is always a danger of running eyes.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Stephanie 2.jpg|thumb|right|A smoke Persian with moderate features]]\n\nWhile the looks of the Persian changed, the Persian Breed Council's standard for the Persian had remained basically the same.

This was to make it easy for breeders who do not want Himalayan blood in their breeding lines to avoid individuals who, while not necessarily exhibiting the colorpoint pattern, may be carrying the point coloration gene recessively. Persians with Himalayan ancestry has registration numbers starting with 3 and are commonly referred to by breeders as colorpoint carriers (CPC) or 3000-series cats, although not all will actually carry the recessive gene. The Siamese is also the source for the chocolate and lilac color in solid Persians.<ref>[http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/persian-solid.html Breed Profile: Persian \u2013 Solid Color Division] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917091248/http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/persian-solid.html |date=September 17, 2009 }} Cat Fanciers' Association</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfainc.org/org/minutes/Jun04.pdf|title=CFA ANNUAL AND EXECUTIVE BOARD MEETINGS JUNE 23\u201327, 2004|website=cfainc.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613043435/http://cfainc.org/org/minutes/Jun04.pdf|archivedate=June 13, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref><!-- first ref for info on chocolate and lilac color, second for the 3000 series stuff. -->\n\n===Exotic Shorthair===\n{{Main|Exotic Shorthair}}\n[[File:Brown Exotic Shorthair Kitten.jpg|thumb|right|The Exotic Shorthair is similar to the Persian in temperament and type, with the exception of its short, dense coat.]]\nThe Persian was used as an outcross secretly by some [[American Shorthair]] (ASH) breeders in the late 1950s to \"improve\" their breed. The [[crossbreed]] look gained recognition in the show ring, but other breeders unhappy with the changes successfully pushed for new breed standards that would disqualify ASH that showed signs of crossbreeding.\n\nOne ASH breeder who saw the potential of the Persian/ASH cross proposed, and eventually managed, to get the CFA to recognize them as a new breed in 1966, under the name [[Exotic Shorthair]]. Regular outcrossing to the Persian has made present-day Exotic Shorthair similar to the Persian in every way, including temperament and conformation, with the exception of the short dense coat. It has even inherited much of the Persian's health problems. The easier to manage coat has made some label the Exotic Shorthair \"the lazy person's Persian\".\n\nBecause of the regular use of Persians as outcrosses, some Exotics may carry a copy of the recessive longhair gene. When two such cats mate, there is a one in four chance of each offspring being longhaired. Longhaired Exotics are not considered Persians by CFA, although [[The International Cat Association]] accepts them as Persians. Other associations register them as a separate Exotic Longhair breed.<ref name=\"Helgren4\">{{cite web |last=Helgren|first=J.

Silver and golden Persians are recognized, as such, by CFA. In [[South Africa]], the attempt to separate the breed was more successful; the [[Southern Africa Cat Council]] (SACC) registers cats with five generations of purebred Chinchilla as a Chinchilla Longhair. The Chinchilla Longhair has a slightly longer nose than the Persian, resulting in healthy breathing and less eye tearing. Its hair is translucent with only the tips carrying black pigment, a feature that gets lost when out-crossed to other colored Persians. Out-crossing also may result in losing nose and lip liner, which is a fault in the Chinchilla Longhair breed standard. One of the distinctions of this breed is the blue-green or green eye color only with kittens having blue or blue-purple eye color.<ref>[http://www.chinchillafactssite.com/chinchillas-as-pets/persian-longhair-cat/#appearance Difference Between Chinchilla Rodent and Chinchilla Cat] Chinchillafactssite.com</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Popularity==\n[[File:GCCF breed registration data - Top 5 breeds of 2008.jpg|thumb|right|The popularity of the Persian (blue line) in the UK has declined for the past two decades]]\n\nIn 2008, the Persian was the most popular breed of pedigree cats in the United States.<ref name=\"CFAdata2008\">[http://www.cfainc.org/press/2008-breed-popularity.pdf 2008 Top Pedigreed Breeds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401080256/http://www.cfainc.org/press/2008-breed-popularity.pdf |date=April 1, 2010 }} CFA.

If classified as the Himalayan sub-breed, full [[point coloration]] is required, the fourth TICA color division, with a \"pale and creamy colored\" body even lighter than mink, with intense coloration on the face an extremities. The four TICA categories are essentially a graduated scale of color distribution from evenly colored to mostly colored only at the points.  Within each, the coloration may be further classified as solid, [[Tortoiseshell cat|tortoiseshell]] (or \"tortie\"), [[Tabby cat|tabby]], silver or smoke, solid-and-white, tortoiseshell-and-white, tabby-and-white, or silver/smoke-and-white, with various specific colors and modifiers (e.g. chocolate tortoiseshell point, or fawn shaded mink marbled tabby-torbie).

The film is based on the 1938 novel ''[[Father Malachy's Miracle]]'' by [[Bruce Marshall]] and tells the story of a supposed miracle in a West German town that is soon exploited and sensationalized by the media and profiteers. The film won several awards and was the official West German [[List of German submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|submission]] to the [[34th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nNext to a church in a prosperous German industrial town is the Eden bar, a night club and brothel. The Eden bar is a thorn in the side of the worldly innocent monk Father Malachia ([[Horst Bollmann]]), who is praying to God that he will close the bar. The prayer is heard and the building and the bar and all people inside vanish and reappear on an island in the [[North Sea]]. This apparent miracle draws the attention of the media, politicians and scientists, all trying to find rational explanations. The Catholic Church is reluctant to officially recognize this occurrence as a miracle, both fearing a loss of control in matters of faith, or a loss of face if the disappearance of the Eden bar would turn out to be a fabrication.\n\nMeanwhile, believers from all over the world pilgrimage to the former location of the bar. Soon the site becomes a fairground, with the towns people, profiteers and journalists trying to make a profit from the sudden influx of pilgrims and the miracle. This includes the sale of holy water, Malachia [[Stollen]] and miniature models of the Eden bar. A young woman, who was in the bar during the night the bar vanished, becomes a media star. Financial investors are buying the island where the Eden bar reappeared, and construct a casino that soon attracts crowds of people.\n\nFather Malachia is confronted with interview requests by journalists and by pilgrims beleaguering the church and hoping to meet him. As he has spent most of his life in the monastery, he feels helpless in the face of the excesses of modern society. He soon regrets that he asked God for a miracle. He travels to the island and prays for a second miracle that will end the frenzy, and is heard by God who returns the Eden bar to its original location.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Horst Bollmann]] as Father Malachias\n* [[Richard M\u00fcnch (actor)|Richard M\u00fcnch]] as Dr Erwin Glass\n* [[Christiane Nielsen]] as Helga Glass\n* [[G\u00fcnter Pfitzmann]] as Rudolf Reuschel\n* [[Brigitte Grothum]] as Gussy\n* [[Karin H\u00fcbner]] as Nelly Moorbach\n* [[Pinkas Braun]] as Christian Kr\u00fcger\n* Kurt Ehrhardt as [[Bishop]] Reuschel\n* Curt Lauermann as [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] Kleinrath\n* [[G\u00fcnter Strack]] as [[Chaplain]] Merz\n* Ludwig Thiesen as Chaplain Heidenreich\n* Romuald Pekny as [[Papal legate]]\n* [[Paul Edwin Roth]] as Secretary of the bishop\n* [[Senta Berger]] as Yvonne Kr\u00fcger\n* [[Charlotte Kerr]] as Dr Renate Kellinghus\n* [[G\u00fcnter Meisner]] as Preacher\n* [[Vicco von B\u00fclow]] as Dr. Sch\u00f6ninger\n\n==Production==\nWicki based his film on the 1938 novel ''[[Father Malachy's Miracle]]'' by the Scottish accountant and writer [[Bruce Marshall]]. He wrote the script together with the screenwriter Heinz Pauck, planning to not only adapt the original novel, but also to expose the \"social structure of our saturated [society]\" ({{lang-de|\"soziale Struktur unserer Sattheit\"}}). Writing the script took more than six months, whereas the actual filming took five months.<ref name=\"spiegel\" />\n\nFor the main role of Father Malachias Wicki cast the stage actor [[Horst Bollmann]], who had never played in a film. Other important roles were played by experienced film actors such as [[Richard M\u00fcnch (actor)|Richard M\u00fcnch]] or [[G\u00fcnter Pfitzmann]]. Supporting actors were often lay actors who played a role corresponding to their real profession, as for example journalists, press photographers or businessmen. Several known people had cameo appearances in the film, including the German translator of ''[[Justine (Sade)|Justine]]'', Maria Carlsson as a socialite, the humorist and graphic artist [[Vicco von B\u00fclow|Loriot]] as a playboy and the film journalist Kurt Habernoll as a sausage vendor.<ref name=\"spiegel\" />\n\nThe film was shot completely on location and not a single scene was shot on a studio set. Most scenes were shot in [[Gelsenkirchen]] in the [[Ruhr Area]]. In total 95 different locations were used, including several industrial sites and the [[Musiktheater im Revier]]. A small part of the footage showing monks and priests was shot in advance at the Eucharistical World Congress in [[Munich]]. To increase the authenticity of the film Wicki used real brand names such [[Miele]], [[K\u00f6nig Brauerei|K\u00f6nig-Pilsener]], [[Coca-Cola]] or [[Telefunken]]. Some brand names featured in fictional slogans that were used by those trying to make a profit from the miracle, for example \"The girl that witnessed the miracle flies around the world with [[Pan American World Airways|PAA]]\". ({{lang-de|\"Das M\u00e4dchen, das das Wunder sah, fliegt um die Welt mit PAA\"}}) or \"Stay on earth &mdash; drive [[Borgward]]\" ({{lang-de|\"Bleib auf der Erde &mdash; fahr Borgward\"}}).<ref name=\"spiegel\" />\n\nThe film was planned to have its premiere at the [[11th Berlin International Film Festival|International Film Festival]] in [[Berlin]]. As it was not yet completed the selection committee of the film festival saw only a raw cut of the film. This led to speculation in the tabloid press of a race against the time and that Wicki had collapsed at the cutting table due to the time pressure. Ultimately the film was finished only seven hours before it premiered at the festival.<ref name=\"spiegel\" />\n\n==Distribution and responses==\nUpon release the film received positive, albeit not enthusiastic, reviews by the German press. The [[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]] wrote, against the background of the artistic and economic stagnation of the German film industry that Wicki is \"a kind of Messiah ... who did not only have to prove himself and others his talent, but also had to show that the [German] film industry has a right to exist.\" ({{lang-de|\"eine Art Messias ... dem es nicht mehr nur oblag, sich und anderen sein Talent, sondern gleichzeitig einer ganzen Branche ihre Existenzberechtigung zu beweisen\"}}). [[Die Welt]] wrote that \"the cinema of this country [Germany] is not yet finished\" ({{lang-de|\"der Film dieses Landes nicht am Ende [sei]\"}}).<ref name=\"spiegel\" />\n\nThe film won several awards.

The film is based on the 1938 novel ''[[Father Malachy's Miracle]]'' by [[Bruce Marshall]] and tells the story of a supposed miracle in a West German town that is soon exploited and sensationalized by the media and profiteers. The film won several awards and was the official West German [[List of German submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|submission]] to the [[34th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nNext to a church in a prosperous German industrial town is the Eden bar, a night club and brothel. The Eden bar is a thorn in the side of the worldly innocent monk Father Malachia ([[Horst Bollmann]]), who is praying to God that he will close the bar. The prayer is heard and the building and the bar and all people inside vanish and reappear on an island in the [[North Sea]]. This apparent miracle draws the attention of the media, politicians and scientists, all trying to find rational explanations. The Catholic Church is reluctant to officially recognize this occurrence as a miracle, both fearing a loss of control in matters of faith, or a loss of face if the disappearance of the Eden bar would turn out to be a fabrication.\n\nMeanwhile, believers from all over the world pilgrimage to the former location of the bar. Soon the site becomes a fairground, with the towns people, profiteers and journalists trying to make a profit from the sudden influx of pilgrims and the miracle. This includes the sale of holy water, Malachia [[Stollen]] and miniature models of the Eden bar. A young woman, who was in the bar during the night the bar vanished, becomes a media star. Financial investors are buying the island where the Eden bar reappeared, and construct a casino that soon attracts crowds of people.\n\nFather Malachia is confronted with interview requests by journalists and by pilgrims beleaguering the church and hoping to meet him. As he has spent most of his life in the monastery, he feels helpless in the face of the excesses of modern society. He soon regrets that he asked God for a miracle. He travels to the island and prays for a second miracle that will end the frenzy, and is heard by God who returns the Eden bar to its original location.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Horst Bollmann]] as Father Malachias\n* [[Richard M\u00fcnch (actor)|Richard M\u00fcnch]] as Dr Erwin Glass\n* [[Christiane Nielsen]] as Helga Glass\n* [[G\u00fcnter Pfitzmann]] as Rudolf Reuschel\n* [[Brigitte Grothum]] as Gussy\n* [[Karin H\u00fcbner]] as Nelly Moorbach\n* [[Pinkas Braun]] as Christian Kr\u00fcger\n* Kurt Ehrhardt as [[Bishop]] Reuschel\n* Curt Lauermann as [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] Kleinrath\n* [[G\u00fcnter Strack]] as [[Chaplain]] Merz\n* Ludwig Thiesen as Chaplain Heidenreich\n* Romuald Pekny as [[Papal legate]]\n* [[Paul Edwin Roth]] as Secretary of the bishop\n* [[Senta Berger]] as Yvonne Kr\u00fcger\n* [[Charlotte Kerr]] as Dr Renate Kellinghus\n* [[G\u00fcnter Meisner]] as Preacher\n* [[Vicco von B\u00fclow]] as Dr. Sch\u00f6ninger\n\n==Production==\nWicki based his film on the 1938 novel ''[[Father Malachy's Miracle]]'' by the Scottish accountant and writer [[Bruce Marshall]]. He wrote the script together with the screenwriter Heinz Pauck, planning to not only adapt the original novel, but also to expose the \"social structure of our saturated [society]\" ({{lang-de|\"soziale Struktur unserer Sattheit\"}}). Writing the script took more than six months, whereas the actual filming took five months.<ref name=\"spiegel\" />\n\nFor the main role of Father Malachias Wicki cast the stage actor [[Horst Bollmann]], who had never played in a film. Other important roles were played by experienced film actors such as [[Richard M\u00fcnch (actor)|Richard M\u00fcnch]] or [[G\u00fcnter Pfitzmann]]. Supporting actors were often lay actors who played a role corresponding to their real profession, as for example journalists, press photographers or businessmen. Several known people had cameo appearances in the film, including the German translator of ''[[Justine (Sade)|Justine]]'', Maria Carlsson as a socialite, the humorist and graphic artist [[Vicco von B\u00fclow|Loriot]] as a playboy and the film journalist Kurt Habernoll as a sausage vendor.<ref name=\"spiegel\" />\n\nThe film was shot completely on location and not a single scene was shot on a studio set. Most scenes were shot in [[Gelsenkirchen]] in the [[Ruhr Area]]. In total 95 different locations were used, including several industrial sites and the [[Musiktheater im Revier]]. A small part of the footage showing monks and priests was shot in advance at the Eucharistical World Congress in [[Munich]]. To increase the authenticity of the film Wicki used real brand names such [[Miele]], [[K\u00f6nig Brauerei|K\u00f6nig-Pilsener]], [[Coca-Cola]] or [[Telefunken]]. Some brand names featured in fictional slogans that were used by those trying to make a profit from the miracle, for example \"The girl that witnessed the miracle flies around the world with [[Pan American World Airways|PAA]]\". ({{lang-de|\"Das M\u00e4dchen, das das Wunder sah, fliegt um die Welt mit PAA\"}}) or \"Stay on earth &mdash; drive [[Borgward]]\" ({{lang-de|\"Bleib auf der Erde &mdash; fahr Borgward\"}}).<ref name=\"spiegel\" />\n\nThe film was planned to have its premiere at the [[11th Berlin International Film Festival|International Film Festival]] in [[Berlin]]. As it was not yet completed the selection committee of the film festival saw only a raw cut of the film. This led to speculation in the tabloid press of a race against the time and that Wicki had collapsed at the cutting table due to the time pressure. Ultimately the film was finished only seven hours before it premiered at the festival.<ref name=\"spiegel\" />\n\n==Distribution and responses==\nUpon release the film received positive, albeit not enthusiastic, reviews by the German press. The [[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]] wrote, against the background of the artistic and economic stagnation of the German film industry that Wicki is \"a kind of Messiah ... who did not only have to prove himself and others his talent, but also had to show that the [German] film industry has a right to exist.\" ({{lang-de|\"eine Art Messias ... dem es nicht mehr nur oblag, sich und anderen sein Talent, sondern gleichzeitig einer ganzen Branche ihre Existenzberechtigung zu beweisen\"}}). [[Die Welt]] wrote that \"the cinema of this country [Germany] is not yet finished\" ({{lang-de|\"der Film dieses Landes nicht am Ende [sei]\"}}).<ref name=\"spiegel\" />\n\nThe film won several awards. Nationally, ''The Miracle of Father Malachia'' won the [[Silver Bear for Best Director]] at the [[11th Berlin International Film Festival]] in 1961,<ref name=\"berlinale 1961\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1961/03_preistr_ger_1961/03_Preistraeger_1961.html |title=Berlinale 1961: Prize Winners |accessdate=2010-01-22 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> and three [[Deutscher Filmpreis|German film awards]] in the categories Best Actor, Best Set Design and a ''Filmband in Silber'' for Best Feature Film in 1962.

It was split into two disciplines, [[Freestyle wrestling|Freestyle]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] which were further divided into different weight categories. Men competed in both disciplines whereas women only took part in the freestyle events, with 18 [[gold medal]]s awarded. [[Amateur wrestling|Wrestling]] has been contested at every modern [[Summer Olympic Games]], except [[1900 Summer Olympics|Paris 1900]].\n\n==Competition format==\n19 men or 18 women competed in each division, plus 6 others allocated either to the host country or by the tripartite commission into divisions yet to be determined prior to the Olympics. Wrestlers determined by lot competed in qualification rounds to reduce the number to 16, thereafter proceeding by simple knockout to determine the finalists who competed for gold and silver. The two groups of wrestlers respectively defeated in the 3 or 4 bouts of the two finalists competed in two serial elimination repechages, with the victor in each repechage being awarded bronze.\n\n==Competition schedule==\n<small>All times are [[British Summer Time]] ([[UTC+01:00|UTC+1]])</small>\n\n===Men's Greco-Roman===\n{|class=wikitable\n!

Exhibition Centre]]\n\n'''Wrestling at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]''' were held between 5 and 12 August, the final day of the Games, at [[ExCeL London]]. It was split into two disciplines, [[Freestyle wrestling|Freestyle]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] which were further divided into different weight categories. Men competed in both disciplines whereas women only took part in the freestyle events, with 18 [[gold medal]]s awarded. [[Amateur wrestling|Wrestling]] has been contested at every modern [[Summer Olympic Games]], except [[1900 Summer Olympics|Paris 1900]].\n\n==Competition format==\n19 men or 18 women competed in each division, plus 6 others allocated either to the host country or by the tripartite commission into divisions yet to be determined prior to the Olympics. Wrestlers determined by lot competed in qualification rounds to reduce the number to 16, thereafter proceeding by simple knockout to determine the finalists who competed for gold and silver. The two groups of wrestlers respectively defeated in the 3 or 4 bouts of the two finalists competed in two serial elimination repechages, with the victor in each repechage being awarded bronze.\n\n==Competition schedule==\n<small>All times are [[British Summer Time]] ([[UTC+01:00|UTC+1]])</small>\n\n===Men's Greco-Roman===\n{|class=wikitable\n!

Consequently, a counter cultural movement developed and a political cabaret was formed in Passau. The main cabaret performers in this movement were [[Bruno Jonas]] and [[Siegfried Zimmerschied]].{{Cn|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn opposition to this counter culture movement, the chief editor of the PNP established a news embargo on the cabaret organization.

This is a festival for art, theatre, music and cabaret. Since 1983 the Scharfrichterhaus, in collaboration with the Bavarian TV channel and a Munich newspaper, awarded the \"[[Executioner\u2019s Hatchet]]\".

Events in the Scharfrichterhaus include regular performances of jazz, readings, cabaret, chanson or theatre. Due to space restrictions, some of the events take place in the nearby \"Redoute Passau\".\n\n== Modern features ==\nToday the Scharfrichterhaus has two main features for visitors. The first is a cafe that is part of the house and is modeled after a Viennese coffeehouse of the 19th and 20th century. The second feature is a restaurant with selected food and wine, and an additional wine-cellar.\n\n[[File:Passau Scharfrichterhaus Innenhof.jpg|thumb|left|The patio of the Scharfrichterhaus]]\nThe Scharfrichterhaus also contains the independent \"Scharfrichter-Cinema\".

Those rooms had been already used for some years to present a weekly ambitious cinema, but these events had not been widely accepted by the audience.\n\nA distinct feature of the new institution is the repertory cinema. With its detailed program the visitor knows already weeks in advance what is available. A program guide called \"Trailer\", the cinema's main advertising, is spread out in a circulation of 6000 copies and laid out in various shops, sent by post or email. The selection of movies, which fit into the other Scharfrichterhaus program, aims to reach viewers interested in non-mainstream movies and is primarily chosen by Vesper.\n\nIn addition, there is also a program advisory board. It consists of Landshuter and Vesper, two professors of the university of Passau, and two employees who work out together the different film rows at their regular meetings and submit them to the annual competition of the Federal Minister of the Interior for support of the cinema (German: ''Filmf\u00f6rderanstalt'').

Initially there were two services devoted to diplomatic and consular activity. The Diplomatic Service provided [[ambassador]]s and ministers to staff embassies overseas, while the Consular Service provided [[Consul (representative)|consuls]] to assist United States sailors and promote [[international trade]] and [[commerce]].\n\nThroughout the 19th century, ambassadors, or ministers, as they were known prior to the 1890s, and consuls were appointed by the president, and until 1856, earned no salary. Many had commercial ties to the countries in which they would serve, and were expected to earn a living through private business or by collecting fees. In 1856, Congress provided a salary for consuls serving at certain posts; those who received a salary could not engage in private business, but could continue to collect fees for services performed.\n\n==Lucile Atcherson Curtis==\n[[Lucile Atcherson Curtis]] was the first woman in what became the U.S. Foreign Service.<ref name=\"harvard.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch01223|title=Curtis, Lucile Atcherson, 1894-1986.

An extremely difficult Foreign Service examination was also implemented to recruit the most outstanding Americans, along with a merit-based system of promotions. The Rogers Act also created the Board of the Foreign Service and the Board of Examiners of the Foreign Service, the former to advise the Secretary of State on managing the Foreign Service, and the latter to manage the examination process.\n\nIn 1927 Congress passed legislation affording diplomatic status to representatives abroad of the Department of Commerce (until then known as \"[[Trade Commissioner|trade commissioners]]\"), creating the [[United States Commercial Service|Foreign Commerce Service]]. In 1930 Congress passed [https://archive.org/details/ForeignAgriculturalServiceActOf1930 similar legislation for the Department of Agriculture], creating the [[Foreign Agricultural Service]]. Though formally accorded [[Diplomatic rank|diplomatic status]], however, commercial and [[agricultural attach\u00e9]]s were [[Civil service|civil servants]] (not officers of the Foreign Service). In addition, the agricultural legislation stipulated that agricultural attach\u00e9s would not be construed as public ministers. On July 1, 1939, however, both the commercial and agricultural attach\u00e9s were transferred to the Department of State under Reorganization Plan No. II. The agricultural attach\u00e9s remained in the Department of State until 1954, when they were returned by Act of Congress to the Department of Agriculture. Commercial attach\u00e9s remained with State until 1980, when Reorganization Plan Number 3 of 1979 was implemented under terms of the Foreign Service Act of 1980.\n\n==Foreign Service Act of 1946==\nIn 1946 Congress at the request of the Department of State passed a new Foreign Service Act creating six classes of employees: [[Head of Mission|chiefs of mission]], [[Foreign Service Officer]]s, Foreign Service Reservists, Foreign Service Staff, \"alien personnel\" (subsequently renamed Foreign Service Nationals and later Locally Employed Staff), and consular agents.  Officers were expected to spend the bulk of their careers abroad and were commissioned officers of the United States, available for worldwide service.  Reserve officers often spent the bulk of their careers in Washington but were available for overseas service.  Foreign Service Staff personnel included clerical and support positions.  The intent of this system was to remove the distinction between Foreign Service and civil service staff, which had been a source of friction.  The Foreign Service Act of 1946 also repealed as redundant the 1927 and 1930 laws granting USDA and Commerce representatives abroad diplomatic status, since at that point agricultural and commercial attach\u00e9s were appointed by the Department of State.\n\nThe 1946 Act replaced the Board of Foreign Service Personnel, a body concerned solely with administering the system of promotions, with the Board of the Foreign Service, which was responsible more broadly for the personnel system as a whole, and created the position of [[Director General of the Foreign Service]].  It also introduced the \"up-or-out\" system under which failure to gain promotion to higher rank within a specified time in class would lead to mandatory retirement, essentially borrowing the concept from the U.S. Navy.  The 1946 Act also created the rank of Career Minister, accorded to the most senior officers of the service, and established mandatory retirement ages.<ref name=\"evans\">{{cite news|title=The Reorganization of the American Foreign Service|work=International Affairs, vol. 24/2, pp. 206-217|first=Alona E.|last=Evans|date=April 1948}}</ref>\n\n==Foreign Service Act of 1980==\nThe new personnel management approach was not wholly successful, which led to an effort in the late 1970s to overhaul the 1946 Act. During drafting of this Act, Congress chose to move the commercial attach\u00e9s back to Commerce while preserving their status as [[Foreign Service Officer]]s, and to include [[agricultural attach\u00e9]]s of the Department of Agriculture in addition to the existing FSOs of the Department of State, U.S. Information Agency, and U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nThe Foreign Service Act of 1980 is the most recent major legislative reform to the Foreign Service. It abolished the Foreign Service Reserve category of officers, and reformed the personnel system for non-diplomatic locally employed staff of overseas missions (Foreign Service Nationals). It created a [[Senior Foreign Service]] with a rank structure equivalent to [[General officer|general]] and [[flag officer]]s of the [[United States armed forces|armed forces]] and to the [[Senior Executive Service]]. It enacted danger pay for those diplomats who serve in dangerous and hostile surroundings along with other administrative changes. The 1980 Act also reauthorized the Board of the Foreign Service, which \"shall include one or more representatives of the Department of State, the [[United States Information Agency]], the [[United States Agency for International Development]], the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Labor, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Management and Budget, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and such other agencies as the President may designate.\"\n\nThis board is charged with advising \"the Secretary of State on matters relating to the Service, including furtherance of the objectives of maximum compatibility among agencies authorized by law to utilize the Foreign Service personnel system and compatibility between the Foreign Service personnel system and the other personnel systems of the Government.\"<ref>Foreign Service Act of 1980, Section 210.</ref>\n\n==Members of the Foreign Service==\n[[File:Secretary Pompeo delivers remarks and administers the Oath of Office to the 195th Foreign Service Generalist Class (44553342524) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] swears in the 195th Foreign Service Generalist Class in October 2018]]\nThe Foreign Service Act, {{UnitedStatesCode|22|3903}} ''[[et seq]].'', defines the following members of the Foreign Service:<ref>[http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/400/fsa.pdf Foreign Service Act]</ref>\n*[[Chief of Mission|Chiefs of mission]] are appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n*[[Ambassador-at-Large|Ambassadors at large]] are appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n*[[Senior Foreign Service]] (SFS) members are the senior leaders and experts for the management of the Foreign Service and the performance of its functions.  They are appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate.  SFS may come from the FSO or Specialist ranks and are the equivalent to flag or general officers in the military.\n*[[Foreign Service Officer]]s (known informally as \"generalists\") are appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate.  These are mostly diplomat \"generalists\" who, along with some subject area experts, have primary responsibility for carrying out the functions of the Foreign Service.\n*[[Foreign Service Specialists]] provide special skills and services required for effective performance by the Service (including, but not limited to Facilities Managers, IT Specialists, Nurse Practitioners and Special Agents of the Diplomatic Security Service). They are appointed by the Secretary of State.\n*[[Foreign Service Nationals]] (FSNs) are personnel who provide clerical, administrative, technical, fiscal, and other support at posts abroad. They may be native citizens of the host country or third-country citizens (the latter referred to in the past as Third Country Nationals or TCNs).  They are \"members of the Service\" as defined in the Foreign Service Act unlike other Locally Employed Staff,  (also known as LE Staff) who in some cases are U.S. citizens living abroad.\n*[[Consular agents]] provide consular and related services as authorized by the Secretary of State at specified locations abroad where no Foreign Service posts are situated.\n\nAdditionally, [[Diplomats in Residence]] are senior [[Foreign Service Officer]]s who act as recruiters for the United States Foreign Service. They operate in designated regions and hold honorary positions in local universities.\n\n==Foreign affairs agencies==\nWhile employees of the [[Department of State]] make up the largest portion of the Foreign Service, the Foreign Service Act of 1980 authorizes other U.S. government agencies to use the personnel system for positions that require service abroad. These include the Department of Commerce<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afsa.org/fcs/RevisedTourofDutyPolicy-0506.doc|title=Foreign Service Personnel Management Manual|publisher=}}</ref> ([[United States Commercial Service|Foreign Commercial Service]]), the Department of Agriculture (specifically the [[Foreign Agricultural Service]], though the Secretary of Agriculture has also authorized the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to use it as well), and the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID).<ref>See for example [https://fam.state.gov/FAM/15FAM/15FAM0230.html#M235_2 15 FAM 235.2], which specifically refers to the foreign affairs agencies as \"each Foreign Affairs Agency (U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Foreign Agriculture <nowiki>[</nowiki>''sic''<nowiki>]</nowiki> Service of the Department of Agriculture (FAS), and U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service of the Department of Commerce (US&FCS)) and the U.S. Defense representative.\"</ref>  USAID, Commerce, and Agriculture senior career FSOs can be appointed to ambassadorships, although the ranks of career ambassadors are in the vast majority of cases drawn from the Department of State, with a far smaller sub-set drawn from the ranks of USAID Mission Directors.\n\n==Foreign Service size==\nThe total number of Foreign Service members, excluding Foreign Service Nationals, from all Foreign Service agencies (State, USAID, etc.) is about 15,150.{{cn|date=October 2017}} This includes:\n*8,000 Foreign Service Officers, called \"generalist\" diplomats\n*5,800 Foreign Service Specialists<ref name=numbers> {{cite web |url= http://www.afsa.org/sites/default/files/0917_state_dept_hr_factsheet.pdf |title=HR Fact Sheet |publisher=US State Department}}</ref>\n* 1,700 at USAID{{cn|date=October 2017}}\n*250 Foreign Commercial Service\n*175 Foreign Agricultural Service\n*25 International Broadcasting Bureau<ref>{{cite web|title=Diplomacy Post-9/11: Life in the U.S. Foreign Service|url=http://thekojonnamdishow.org/shows/2011-09-22/diplomacy-post-911-life-us-foreign-service|accessdate=September 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIncreasingly, the State Department is assigning diplomats abroad under alternate personnel systems that afford more flexibility to the United States Government, such as reduced benefits, longer terms, etc.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Employment==\nThe process of being employed in the Foreign Service is different for each of the five categories as defined in the Foreign Service Act.\n\nThe evaluation process for all Foreign Service generalists and specialists can be broadly summarized as: Initial application, Qualifications Evaluation Panel (QEP), Oral Assessment, clearances and final suitability review, and the register.\n\nAll evaluation steps for Generalist and Specialist candidates are anchored using certain personality characteristics.<ref>{{cite web |title=13 Dimensions - Careers |url=https://careers.state.gov/work/foreign-service/officer/13-dimensions/ |website=careers.state.gov |accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref> For Generalists there are 13, for Specialists there are 12. Familiarity with these characteristics dramatically improves a candidate's probability of success.\n\n=== Initial application ===\n\nStep 1 for a Generalist is the Foreign Service Officer Test (FSOT). For a Specialist, it is an application on [[USAJobs]] or application in response to an advertised local hire position at a Foreign Service post.\n\n==== FSOT ====\n\nGeneralist candidates take the Foreign Service Officer Test (FSOT), a written exam consisting of three sections job knowledge, hypothetical scenarios (changed from biographical information), English grammar and usage, and an essay. Those who pass the FSOT are invited to submit short essays called Personal Narrative Questions (PNQs) for review by the Qualifications Evaluation Panel (QEP). Approximately 25 to 30 percent of candidates pass both the FSOT and the Personal Narrative Questions/Qualifications Evaluation Panel phase of the process.<ref name=\"act\">{{cite news|url=http://www.act.org/activity/spring2009/become.html|title=Becoming a Foreign Service Officer|date=Spring 2009|publisher=ACT's Activity Publication|accessdate=June 16, 2009}} \"Only about 25 to 30 percent of candidates pass the initial examination and screening and move onto the oral assessment phase\"</ref><ref name=\"act\"/><ref name=\"state\">{{cite web|url=http://www.careers.state.gov/officer/faqs.html  |title=U.S. Department of State Careers|publisher=United States State Department |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050106051359/http://www.careers.state.gov/officer/faqs.html |archivedate = January 6, 2005}} \"There is no set percentage that pass.

Given how varied the specialties are, applications vary. Candidates are asked to rate their own levels of experience, citing examples and references who can verify these claims.\n\n=== QEP ===\n\nIf a Generalist candidate's score on the FSOT meets or exceeds cutoff, they are invited to submit answers to Personal Narrative Questions, which will be reviewed by a Qualifications Evaluation Panel. Recently these have been six essays that ask for examples of how the candidate met certain challenges, anchored by the 13 personality characteristics. The Qualifications Evaluation Panel (QEP) (which is composed of three current Foreign Service Officers), was one of the most significant changes to the Foreign Service hiring process in decades. {{Citation needed|date=July 2018|reason=}} To be invited to take the Oral Assessment an applicant must not only pass the FSOT but also the Qualifications Evaluation Panel review. The Department of State's Board of Examiners can find some candidacies unacceptable despite the fact that they passed the FSOT.\n\nSpecialists also undergo a QEP, but their essays were collected as part of the initial application on USAJobs. [[Foreign Service Specialist]] (FSS) candidates are evaluated by Subject Matter Experts for proven skills and recommended to the Board of Examiners for an oral assessment based on those skills.\n\n=== Oral Assessments ===\n\nThe oral assessment also varies for Generalists and Specialists. For Specialists there is a structured oral interview, written assessment, and usually an online, objective exam. For Generalists, there is a written assessment, structured oral interview, and structured group exercise.\n\nThe various parts of the oral assessment are aggregated and scored on a seven-point scale. At the end of the day a candidate will be informed if their score met the 5.25 cutoff score necessary to continue their candidacy. This score becomes relevant again after the final suitability review. Successfully passing the oral assessment grants a candidate a conditional offer of employment.\n\n=== Clearances and Final Suitability Review ===\n\nCandidates must then obtain a Class 1 (Worldwide Available) medical clearance, top secret security clearance, and suitability clearance. Depending upon the candidate's specific career track, they may also require eligibility for a top secret [[Sensitive Compartmented Information]] (TS/SCI) clearance. Once a candidate's clearance information has been obtained, a Final Suitability Review decides if this candidate is appropriate for employment in the Foreign Service. If so, the candidate's name is moved to the Register.\n\nFailure to obtain any of these clearances can result in a candidate's eligibility being terminated. It can be difficult for a candidate to receive a TOP SECRET clearance if they have extensive foreign travel, dual citizenship, non-United States citizen family members, foreign spouses, drug use, financial problems or a poor record of financial practices, frequent gambling, and allegiance or de facto allegiance to a foreign state.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}   Additionally, it can be difficult for anyone who has had a significant health problem to receive a Class 1 Medical Clearance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nThe Foreign Service rejected all candidates with [[HIV]] until 2008 when it decided to consider candidates on a case by case basis. The State Department said it was responding to changes in HIV treatment, but the policy change came after a decision by the [[US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] in ''Taylor v.

There are factors that can increase a candidate's score, such as foreign language proficiency or [[Veterans' Preference Act of 1944|Veteran's Preference]]. Once a candidate is put on the register, they can remain for 18 months. If they are not hired from the register within 18 months, their candidacy is terminated.  Separate registers are maintained for each of the five Generalist career cones as well as the 23 Specialist career tracks.\n\nTechnically, there are many registers. One for each Foreign Service Specialty, and one for each Generalist Cone. The rank-order competitiveness of the register is only relevant within each candidate's career field. Successful candidates from the register will receive offers of employment to join a Foreign Service Class. Generalists and Specialists attend separate orientation classes.\n\nGeneralist candidates who receive official offers of employment must attend a 6-week training/orientation course known as [[A-100 Class|A-100]] at the [[Foreign Service Institute]] (FSI) in Arlington, Virginia. Specialist orientation at FSI is 3 weeks long. Depending upon the specialty, employees will then undergo several months of training before departing for their first assignment.\n\nAll Foreign Service personnel must be worldwide available: that is, they may be deployed anywhere in the world based on the needs of the service.  They also agree to publicly support the policies of the United States Government.\n\n==Service terms and conditions==\nMembers of the Foreign Service are expected to serve much of their career abroad, working at embassies and consulates around the world. By internal regulation the maximum stretch of domestic assignments should last no more than six years (extensions are possible at the six-year limit for medical reasons, to enable children to complete high school, etc. The eight year limit is difficult to pierce and is reserved for those who are deemed \"critical to the service\" and for those persons at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level).  By law, however, Foreign Service personnel must go abroad after ten years of domestic service. The difficulties and the benefits associated with working abroad are many, especially in relation to family life.\n\nDependent family members generally accompany Foreign Service employees overseas.<ref>{{cite book | publisher=American Foreign Service Association | title=Inside a U.S. Embassy | year=2005 | url=https://archive.org/details/insideusembassyh00dorm | isbn=0-9649488-2-6 }}</ref> Unfortunately, this has become more difficult in regions marked by conflict and upheaval (currently many posts in the Middle East) where assignments are unaccompanied.  The children of Foreign Service members, sometimes called [[Foreign Service Brat]]s, grow up in a unique world, one that separates them, willingly or unwillingly, from their counterparts living continuously in the [[United States|United States of America]].\n\nWhile many children of Foreign Service members become very well developed, are able to form friendships easily, are skilled at moving frequently and enjoy international travel, other children have extreme difficulty adapting to the Foreign Service lifestyle. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} For both employees and their families, the opportunity to see the world, experience foreign cultures firsthand for a prolonged period, and the camaraderie amongst the Foreign Service and [[expatriate]] communities in general are considered some of the benefits of Foreign Service life.\n\nSome of the downsides of Foreign Service work include exposure to tropical diseases and the assignment to countries with inadequate health care systems, and potential exposure to violence, civil unrest and warfare. Attacks on US embassies and consulates around the world{{snd}}Beirut, Islamabad, Belgrade, [[1998 United States embassy bombings|Nairobi, Dar es Salaam]], Baghdad, Kabul, and Benghazi, among others{{snd}}underscore the dangers faced.\n\nForeign Service personnel stationed in nations with inadequate public infrastructure also face greater risk of injury or death due to fire, traffic accidents, and natural disasters.  For instance, an FSO was one of the first identified victims of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/01/la-police-honor-guard-will-escort-body-of-diplomat-killed-in-haiti-earthquake.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=L.A. Now | date=January 19, 2010}}</ref>\n\nFor members of the Foreign Service, a personal life outside of the U.S. Foreign Service can be exceptionally difficult. In addition to espionage, there is also the danger of personnel that use their position illegally for financial gain. The most frequent kind of illegal abuse of an official position concerns Consular Officers. There have been a handful of cases of FSOs on Consular Assignments selling visas for a price.<ref>{{cite book | publisher=United States Department of Justice| title=State Department Consular Officer Pleads Guilty to Visa Fraud| date=May 31, 2009 | url=http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2003/February/03_crm_078.htm}}</ref>\n\nMembers of the Foreign Service must agree to worldwide availability.  In practice, they generally have significant input as to where they will work, although issues such as rank, language ability, and previous assignments will affect one's possible onward assignments.  All assignments are based on the needs of the Service, and historically it has occasionally been necessary for the Department to make directed assignments to a particular post in order to fulfill the Government's diplomatic requirements.  This is not the norm, however, as many Foreign Service employees have volunteered to serve even at extreme hardship posts, including, most recently, Iraq and Afghanistan.<ref name='AFSA 2008-01'>{{cite news | first=Shawn | last=Dorman | title=Iraq \"Prime Candidate\" Exercise Cancelled | date=January 2008 | publisher=American Foreign Service Association | url =http://www.afsa.org/fsj/jan08/afsa_news.pdf | work =AFSANEWS | pages =1 | accessdate = March 2, 2008 | language = }}</ref>\n\nThe State Department maintains a Family Liaison Office to assist diplomats, including members of the Foreign Service and their families, in dealing with the unique issues of life as a U.S. diplomat, including the extended family separations that are usually required when an employee is sent to a danger post.<ref name='FLO'>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/m/dghr/flo |title=Family Liaison Office |accessdate=March 2, 2008 |work=www.state.gov |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] }}</ref>\n\n== Issues ==\n\n=== Clientitis ===\n{{Further information|Clientitis}}\n\n[[Clientitis]] (also called clientism<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lq_i3wpmBWUC&lpg=PA156&ots=RHlgVox9jG&dq=clientism%20clientitis&pg=PA156#v=onepage&q=clientism%20clientitis&f=false |title=Behind the disappearances: Argentina's dirty war against human rights and the United Nations |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=1990 |accessdate=May 8, 2013|page=156|chapter=The Carter Years|isbn=0812213130}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l4SoDU_daVoC&lpg=PA87&dq=clientitis%20congress&pg=PA87#v=onepage&q=clientitis%20congress&f=false |title=Turf War: The Clinton Administration And Northern Ireland|author= Timothy J.

Initially there were two services devoted to diplomatic and consular activity. The Diplomatic Service provided [[ambassador]]s and ministers to staff embassies overseas, while the Consular Service provided [[Consul (representative)|consuls]] to assist United States sailors and promote [[international trade]] and [[commerce]].\n\nThroughout the 19th century, ambassadors, or ministers, as they were known prior to the 1890s, and consuls were appointed by the president, and until 1856, earned no salary. Many had commercial ties to the countries in which they would serve, and were expected to earn a living through private business or by collecting fees. In 1856, Congress provided a salary for consuls serving at certain posts; those who received a salary could not engage in private business, but could continue to collect fees for services performed.\n\n==Lucile Atcherson Curtis==\n[[Lucile Atcherson Curtis]] was the first woman in what became the U.S. Foreign Service.<ref name=\"harvard.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch01223|title=Curtis, Lucile Atcherson, 1894-1986.

An extremely difficult Foreign Service examination was also implemented to recruit the most outstanding Americans, along with a merit-based system of promotions. The Rogers Act also created the Board of the Foreign Service and the Board of Examiners of the Foreign Service, the former to advise the Secretary of State on managing the Foreign Service, and the latter to manage the examination process.\n\nIn 1927 Congress passed legislation affording diplomatic status to representatives abroad of the Department of Commerce (until then known as \"[[Trade Commissioner|trade commissioners]]\"), creating the [[United States Commercial Service|Foreign Commerce Service]]. In 1930 Congress passed [https://archive.org/details/ForeignAgriculturalServiceActOf1930 similar legislation for the Department of Agriculture], creating the [[Foreign Agricultural Service]]. Though formally accorded [[Diplomatic rank|diplomatic status]], however, commercial and [[agricultural attach\u00e9]]s were [[Civil service|civil servants]] (not officers of the Foreign Service). In addition, the agricultural legislation stipulated that agricultural attach\u00e9s would not be construed as public ministers. On July 1, 1939, however, both the commercial and agricultural attach\u00e9s were transferred to the Department of State under Reorganization Plan No. II. The agricultural attach\u00e9s remained in the Department of State until 1954, when they were returned by Act of Congress to the Department of Agriculture. Commercial attach\u00e9s remained with State until 1980, when Reorganization Plan Number 3 of 1979 was implemented under terms of the Foreign Service Act of 1980.\n\n==Foreign Service Act of 1946==\nIn 1946 Congress at the request of the Department of State passed a new Foreign Service Act creating six classes of employees: [[Head of Mission|chiefs of mission]], [[Foreign Service Officer]]s, Foreign Service Reservists, Foreign Service Staff, \"alien personnel\" (subsequently renamed Foreign Service Nationals and later Locally Employed Staff), and consular agents.  Officers were expected to spend the bulk of their careers abroad and were commissioned officers of the United States, available for worldwide service.  Reserve officers often spent the bulk of their careers in Washington but were available for overseas service.  Foreign Service Staff personnel included clerical and support positions.  The intent of this system was to remove the distinction between Foreign Service and civil service staff, which had been a source of friction.  The Foreign Service Act of 1946 also repealed as redundant the 1927 and 1930 laws granting USDA and Commerce representatives abroad diplomatic status, since at that point agricultural and commercial attach\u00e9s were appointed by the Department of State.\n\nThe 1946 Act replaced the Board of Foreign Service Personnel, a body concerned solely with administering the system of promotions, with the Board of the Foreign Service, which was responsible more broadly for the personnel system as a whole, and created the position of [[Director General of the Foreign Service]].  It also introduced the \"up-or-out\" system under which failure to gain promotion to higher rank within a specified time in class would lead to mandatory retirement, essentially borrowing the concept from the U.S. Navy.  The 1946 Act also created the rank of Career Minister, accorded to the most senior officers of the service, and established mandatory retirement ages.<ref name=\"evans\">{{cite news|title=The Reorganization of the American Foreign Service|work=International Affairs, vol. 24/2, pp. 206-217|first=Alona E.|last=Evans|date=April 1948}}</ref>\n\n==Foreign Service Act of 1980==\nThe new personnel management approach was not wholly successful, which led to an effort in the late 1970s to overhaul the 1946 Act. During drafting of this Act, Congress chose to move the commercial attach\u00e9s back to Commerce while preserving their status as [[Foreign Service Officer]]s, and to include [[agricultural attach\u00e9]]s of the Department of Agriculture in addition to the existing FSOs of the Department of State, U.S. Information Agency, and U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nThe Foreign Service Act of 1980 is the most recent major legislative reform to the Foreign Service. It abolished the Foreign Service Reserve category of officers, and reformed the personnel system for non-diplomatic locally employed staff of overseas missions (Foreign Service Nationals). It created a [[Senior Foreign Service]] with a rank structure equivalent to [[General officer|general]] and [[flag officer]]s of the [[United States armed forces|armed forces]] and to the [[Senior Executive Service]]. It enacted danger pay for those diplomats who serve in dangerous and hostile surroundings along with other administrative changes. The 1980 Act also reauthorized the Board of the Foreign Service, which \"shall include one or more representatives of the Department of State, the [[United States Information Agency]], the [[United States Agency for International Development]], the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Labor, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Management and Budget, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and such other agencies as the President may designate.\"\n\nThis board is charged with advising \"the Secretary of State on matters relating to the Service, including furtherance of the objectives of maximum compatibility among agencies authorized by law to utilize the Foreign Service personnel system and compatibility between the Foreign Service personnel system and the other personnel systems of the Government.\"<ref>Foreign Service Act of 1980, Section 210.</ref>\n\n==Members of the Foreign Service==\n[[File:Secretary Pompeo delivers remarks and administers the Oath of Office to the 195th Foreign Service Generalist Class (44553342524) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] swears in the 195th Foreign Service Generalist Class in October 2018]]\nThe Foreign Service Act, {{UnitedStatesCode|22|3903}} ''[[et seq]].'', defines the following members of the Foreign Service:<ref>[http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/400/fsa.pdf Foreign Service Act]</ref>\n*[[Chief of Mission|Chiefs of mission]] are appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n*[[Ambassador-at-Large|Ambassadors at large]] are appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n*[[Senior Foreign Service]] (SFS) members are the senior leaders and experts for the management of the Foreign Service and the performance of its functions.  They are appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate.  SFS may come from the FSO or Specialist ranks and are the equivalent to flag or general officers in the military.\n*[[Foreign Service Officer]]s (known informally as \"generalists\") are appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate.  These are mostly diplomat \"generalists\" who, along with some subject area experts, have primary responsibility for carrying out the functions of the Foreign Service.\n*[[Foreign Service Specialists]] provide special skills and services required for effective performance by the Service (including, but not limited to Facilities Managers, IT Specialists, Nurse Practitioners and Special Agents of the Diplomatic Security Service). They are appointed by the Secretary of State.\n*[[Foreign Service Nationals]] (FSNs) are personnel who provide clerical, administrative, technical, fiscal, and other support at posts abroad. They may be native citizens of the host country or third-country citizens (the latter referred to in the past as Third Country Nationals or TCNs).  They are \"members of the Service\" as defined in the Foreign Service Act unlike other Locally Employed Staff,  (also known as LE Staff) who in some cases are U.S. citizens living abroad.\n*[[Consular agents]] provide consular and related services as authorized by the Secretary of State at specified locations abroad where no Foreign Service posts are situated.\n\nAdditionally, [[Diplomats in Residence]] are senior [[Foreign Service Officer]]s who act as recruiters for the United States Foreign Service. They operate in designated regions and hold honorary positions in local universities.\n\n==Foreign affairs agencies==\nWhile employees of the [[Department of State]] make up the largest portion of the Foreign Service, the Foreign Service Act of 1980 authorizes other U.S. government agencies to use the personnel system for positions that require service abroad. These include the Department of Commerce<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afsa.org/fcs/RevisedTourofDutyPolicy-0506.doc|title=Foreign Service Personnel Management Manual|publisher=}}</ref> ([[United States Commercial Service|Foreign Commercial Service]]), the Department of Agriculture (specifically the [[Foreign Agricultural Service]], though the Secretary of Agriculture has also authorized the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to use it as well), and the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID).<ref>See for example [https://fam.state.gov/FAM/15FAM/15FAM0230.html#M235_2 15 FAM 235.2], which specifically refers to the foreign affairs agencies as \"each Foreign Affairs Agency (U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Foreign Agriculture <nowiki>[</nowiki>''sic''<nowiki>]</nowiki> Service of the Department of Agriculture (FAS), and U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service of the Department of Commerce (US&FCS)) and the U.S. Defense representative.\"</ref>  USAID, Commerce, and Agriculture senior career FSOs can be appointed to ambassadorships, although the ranks of career ambassadors are in the vast majority of cases drawn from the Department of State, with a far smaller sub-set drawn from the ranks of USAID Mission Directors.\n\n==Foreign Service size==\nThe total number of Foreign Service members, excluding Foreign Service Nationals, from all Foreign Service agencies (State, USAID, etc.) is about 15,150.{{cn|date=October 2017}} This includes:\n*8,000 Foreign Service Officers, called \"generalist\" diplomats\n*5,800 Foreign Service Specialists<ref name=numbers> {{cite web |url= http://www.afsa.org/sites/default/files/0917_state_dept_hr_factsheet.pdf |title=HR Fact Sheet |publisher=US State Department}}</ref>\n* 1,700 at USAID{{cn|date=October 2017}}\n*250 Foreign Commercial Service\n*175 Foreign Agricultural Service\n*25 International Broadcasting Bureau<ref>{{cite web|title=Diplomacy Post-9/11: Life in the U.S. Foreign Service|url=http://thekojonnamdishow.org/shows/2011-09-22/diplomacy-post-911-life-us-foreign-service|accessdate=September 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIncreasingly, the State Department is assigning diplomats abroad under alternate personnel systems that afford more flexibility to the United States Government, such as reduced benefits, longer terms, etc.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Employment==\nThe process of being employed in the Foreign Service is different for each of the five categories as defined in the Foreign Service Act.\n\nThe evaluation process for all Foreign Service generalists and specialists can be broadly summarized as: Initial application, Qualifications Evaluation Panel (QEP), Oral Assessment, clearances and final suitability review, and the register.\n\nAll evaluation steps for Generalist and Specialist candidates are anchored using certain personality characteristics.<ref>{{cite web |title=13 Dimensions - Careers |url=https://careers.state.gov/work/foreign-service/officer/13-dimensions/ |website=careers.state.gov |accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref> For Generalists there are 13, for Specialists there are 12. Familiarity with these characteristics dramatically improves a candidate's probability of success.\n\n=== Initial application ===\n\nStep 1 for a Generalist is the Foreign Service Officer Test (FSOT). For a Specialist, it is an application on [[USAJobs]] or application in response to an advertised local hire position at a Foreign Service post.\n\n==== FSOT ====\n\nGeneralist candidates take the Foreign Service Officer Test (FSOT), a written exam consisting of three sections job knowledge, hypothetical scenarios (changed from biographical information), English grammar and usage, and an essay. Those who pass the FSOT are invited to submit short essays called Personal Narrative Questions (PNQs) for review by the Qualifications Evaluation Panel (QEP). Approximately 25 to 30 percent of candidates pass both the FSOT and the Personal Narrative Questions/Qualifications Evaluation Panel phase of the process.<ref name=\"act\">{{cite news|url=http://www.act.org/activity/spring2009/become.html|title=Becoming a Foreign Service Officer|date=Spring 2009|publisher=ACT's Activity Publication|accessdate=June 16, 2009}} \"Only about 25 to 30 percent of candidates pass the initial examination and screening and move onto the oral assessment phase\"</ref><ref name=\"act\"/><ref name=\"state\">{{cite web|url=http://www.careers.state.gov/officer/faqs.html  |title=U.S. Department of State Careers|publisher=United States State Department |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050106051359/http://www.careers.state.gov/officer/faqs.html |archivedate = January 6, 2005}} \"There is no set percentage that pass.

Given how varied the specialties are, applications vary. Candidates are asked to rate their own levels of experience, citing examples and references who can verify these claims.\n\n=== QEP ===\n\nIf a Generalist candidate's score on the FSOT meets or exceeds cutoff, they are invited to submit answers to Personal Narrative Questions, which will be reviewed by a Qualifications Evaluation Panel. Recently these have been six essays that ask for examples of how the candidate met certain challenges, anchored by the 13 personality characteristics. The Qualifications Evaluation Panel (QEP) (which is composed of three current Foreign Service Officers), was one of the most significant changes to the Foreign Service hiring process in decades. {{Citation needed|date=July 2018|reason=}} To be invited to take the Oral Assessment an applicant must not only pass the FSOT but also the Qualifications Evaluation Panel review. The Department of State's Board of Examiners can find some candidacies unacceptable despite the fact that they passed the FSOT.\n\nSpecialists also undergo a QEP, but their essays were collected as part of the initial application on USAJobs. [[Foreign Service Specialist]] (FSS) candidates are evaluated by Subject Matter Experts for proven skills and recommended to the Board of Examiners for an oral assessment based on those skills.\n\n=== Oral Assessments ===\n\nThe oral assessment also varies for Generalists and Specialists. For Specialists there is a structured oral interview, written assessment, and usually an online, objective exam. For Generalists, there is a written assessment, structured oral interview, and structured group exercise.\n\nThe various parts of the oral assessment are aggregated and scored on a seven-point scale. At the end of the day a candidate will be informed if their score met the 5.25 cutoff score necessary to continue their candidacy. This score becomes relevant again after the final suitability review. Successfully passing the oral assessment grants a candidate a conditional offer of employment.\n\n=== Clearances and Final Suitability Review ===\n\nCandidates must then obtain a Class 1 (Worldwide Available) medical clearance, top secret security clearance, and suitability clearance. Depending upon the candidate's specific career track, they may also require eligibility for a top secret [[Sensitive Compartmented Information]] (TS/SCI) clearance. Once a candidate's clearance information has been obtained, a Final Suitability Review decides if this candidate is appropriate for employment in the Foreign Service. If so, the candidate's name is moved to the Register.\n\nFailure to obtain any of these clearances can result in a candidate's eligibility being terminated. It can be difficult for a candidate to receive a TOP SECRET clearance if they have extensive foreign travel, dual citizenship, non-United States citizen family members, foreign spouses, drug use, financial problems or a poor record of financial practices, frequent gambling, and allegiance or de facto allegiance to a foreign state.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}   Additionally, it can be difficult for anyone who has had a significant health problem to receive a Class 1 Medical Clearance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nThe Foreign Service rejected all candidates with [[HIV]] until 2008 when it decided to consider candidates on a case by case basis. The State Department said it was responding to changes in HIV treatment, but the policy change came after a decision by the [[US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] in ''Taylor v. Rice'' that suggested the ban on HIV-positive applicants would not survive a lawsuit challenging it.<ref>{{cite web| publisher= Lambda Legal | url= http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/taylor-v-rice|title=Taylor v.

There are factors that can increase a candidate's score, such as foreign language proficiency or [[Veterans' Preference Act of 1944|Veteran's Preference]]. Once a candidate is put on the register, they can remain for 18 months. If they are not hired from the register within 18 months, their candidacy is terminated.  Separate registers are maintained for each of the five Generalist career cones as well as the 23 Specialist career tracks.\n\nTechnically, there are many registers. One for each Foreign Service Specialty, and one for each Generalist Cone. The rank-order competitiveness of the register is only relevant within each candidate's career field. Successful candidates from the register will receive offers of employment to join a Foreign Service Class. Generalists and Specialists attend separate orientation classes.\n\nGeneralist candidates who receive official offers of employment must attend a 6-week training/orientation course known as [[A-100 Class|A-100]] at the [[Foreign Service Institute]] (FSI) in Arlington, Virginia. Specialist orientation at FSI is 3 weeks long. Depending upon the specialty, employees will then undergo several months of training before departing for their first assignment.\n\nAll Foreign Service personnel must be worldwide available: that is, they may be deployed anywhere in the world based on the needs of the service.  They also agree to publicly support the policies of the United States Government.\n\n==Service terms and conditions==\nMembers of the Foreign Service are expected to serve much of their career abroad, working at embassies and consulates around the world. By internal regulation the maximum stretch of domestic assignments should last no more than six years (extensions are possible at the six-year limit for medical reasons, to enable children to complete high school, etc. The eight year limit is difficult to pierce and is reserved for those who are deemed \"critical to the service\" and for those persons at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level).  By law, however, Foreign Service personnel must go abroad after ten years of domestic service. The difficulties and the benefits associated with working abroad are many, especially in relation to family life.\n\nDependent family members generally accompany Foreign Service employees overseas.<ref>{{cite book | publisher=American Foreign Service Association | title=Inside a U.S. Embassy | year=2005 | url=https://archive.org/details/insideusembassyh00dorm | isbn=0-9649488-2-6 }}</ref> Unfortunately, this has become more difficult in regions marked by conflict and upheaval (currently many posts in the Middle East) where assignments are unaccompanied.  The children of Foreign Service members, sometimes called [[Foreign Service Brat]]s, grow up in a unique world, one that separates them, willingly or unwillingly, from their counterparts living continuously in the [[United States|United States of America]].\n\nWhile many children of Foreign Service members become very well developed, are able to form friendships easily, are skilled at moving frequently and enjoy international travel, other children have extreme difficulty adapting to the Foreign Service lifestyle. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} For both employees and their families, the opportunity to see the world, experience foreign cultures firsthand for a prolonged period, and the camaraderie amongst the Foreign Service and [[expatriate]] communities in general are considered some of the benefits of Foreign Service life.\n\nSome of the downsides of Foreign Service work include exposure to tropical diseases and the assignment to countries with inadequate health care systems, and potential exposure to violence, civil unrest and warfare. Attacks on US embassies and consulates around the world{{snd}}Beirut, Islamabad, Belgrade, [[1998 United States embassy bombings|Nairobi, Dar es Salaam]], Baghdad, Kabul, and Benghazi, among others{{snd}}underscore the dangers faced.\n\nForeign Service personnel stationed in nations with inadequate public infrastructure also face greater risk of injury or death due to fire, traffic accidents, and natural disasters.  For instance, an FSO was one of the first identified victims of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/01/la-police-honor-guard-will-escort-body-of-diplomat-killed-in-haiti-earthquake.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=L.A. Now | date=January 19, 2010}}</ref>\n\nFor members of the Foreign Service, a personal life outside of the U.S. Foreign Service can be exceptionally difficult. In addition to espionage, there is also the danger of personnel that use their position illegally for financial gain. The most frequent kind of illegal abuse of an official position concerns Consular Officers. There have been a handful of cases of FSOs on Consular Assignments selling visas for a price.<ref>{{cite book | publisher=United States Department of Justice| title=State Department Consular Officer Pleads Guilty to Visa Fraud| date=May 31, 2009 | url=http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2003/February/03_crm_078.htm}}</ref>\n\nMembers of the Foreign Service must agree to worldwide availability.  In practice, they generally have significant input as to where they will work, although issues such as rank, language ability, and previous assignments will affect one's possible onward assignments.  All assignments are based on the needs of the Service, and historically it has occasionally been necessary for the Department to make directed assignments to a particular post in order to fulfill the Government's diplomatic requirements.  This is not the norm, however, as many Foreign Service employees have volunteered to serve even at extreme hardship posts, including, most recently, Iraq and Afghanistan.<ref name='AFSA 2008-01'>{{cite news | first=Shawn | last=Dorman | title=Iraq \"Prime Candidate\" Exercise Cancelled | date=January 2008 | publisher=American Foreign Service Association | url =http://www.afsa.org/fsj/jan08/afsa_news.pdf | work =AFSANEWS | pages =1 | accessdate = March 2, 2008 | language = }}</ref>\n\nThe State Department maintains a Family Liaison Office to assist diplomats, including members of the Foreign Service and their families, in dealing with the unique issues of life as a U.S. diplomat, including the extended family separations that are usually required when an employee is sent to a danger post.<ref name='FLO'>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/m/dghr/flo |title=Family Liaison Office |accessdate=March 2, 2008 |work=www.state.gov |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] }}</ref>\n\n== Issues ==\n\n=== Clientitis ===\n{{Further information|Clientitis}}\n\n[[Clientitis]] (also called clientism<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lq_i3wpmBWUC&lpg=PA156&ots=RHlgVox9jG&dq=clientism%20clientitis&pg=PA156#v=onepage&q=clientism%20clientitis&f=false |title=Behind the disappearances: Argentina's dirty war against human rights and the United Nations |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=1990 |accessdate=May 8, 2013|page=156|chapter=The Carter Years|isbn=0812213130}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l4SoDU_daVoC&lpg=PA87&dq=clientitis%20congress&pg=PA87#v=onepage&q=clientitis%20congress&f=false |title=Turf War: The Clinton Administration And Northern Ireland|author= Timothy J.
