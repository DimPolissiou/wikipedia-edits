He is voiced by Nick Herman in the [[The Walking Dead (video game)|video game of the same name]], by [[Telltale Games]]. In the comics, he is known simply as '''Glenn''' and was not given a last name.\n\nIn both forms of media, Glenn is a young pizza delivery boy from Atlanta (although in the television series it's stated that he's originally from Yeun's home state, Michigan) who is separated from his family after the zombie outbreak and joins a group of survivors led by [[Rick Grimes]]. Glenn is known for being quick thinking and resourceful, which makes him the group's primary supply runner. As the group begins to move around the region looking for sanctuary, Glenn meets [[Maggie Greene]] and they fall in love. Their relationship is tested in numerous ways throughout the course of the series as their humanity is challenged in the face of numerous threats, including hostile survivors the group comes into contact with. They eventually marry and have a child, although Glenn is killed by [[Negan]] before the child is born.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Comic book series ===\nResourceful and clever, Glenn makes it out of Atlanta and comes up on the group of survivors on the outer limits of the city. Due to his knack for scavenging, he is often nominated to sneak into the city and find supplies. On one of these runs, he finds group leader [[Rick Grimes]] and brings him back to the group, reuniting them with his family.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=[[Robert Kirkman|Kirkman, Robert]] |cowriters= |penciller=[[Tony Moore (artist)|Moore, Tony]] |copencillers= |inker=Moore, Tony |coinkers= |colorist= |letterer=Kirkman, Robert |story=Days Gone Bye |title=The Walking Dead |volume=1 |issue=2 |date=November 2003 |publisher=[[Image Comics]] |location=1071 N.

Glenn grew up in Michigan with several sisters and moved to Atlanta. He worked as a pizza delivery boy, giving him in depth knowledge of Atlanta's layout. When the outbreak occurred, Glenn encountered another survivor named T-Dog (Theodore Douglas) and the two escaped Atlanta together and took refuge in a camp outside of the city led by Shane Walsh.\n\n==== Season 1 ====\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 1)}}\nIn the series premiere episode \"[[Days Gone Bye (The Walking Dead)|Days Gone Bye]]\", Glenn's voice is first heard using a radio to talk to Rick when Rick is hiding in a tank in the city of Atlanta. In the episode \"[[Guts (The Walking Dead)|Guts]]\", Glenn uses the radio to rescue Rick from the horde of walkers surrounding the tank, and guides Rick to the location of his group, which consists of [[Andrea (The Walking Dead)|Andrea]], [[T-Dog (The Walking Dead)|T-Dog]], [[Merle Dixon]], [[Jacqui (The Walking Dead)|Jacqui]], and [[Morales (The Walking Dead)|Morales]], hiding in a department store. The noise made by Rick as he and Glenn flee the horde draws the walkers to the store and the group finds themselves trapped inside. As the walkers try to break through the plate glass doors of the store, Rick decides to try to reach a box truck at a nearby construction site. To reach the truck, he and Glenn cover themselves in the blood and viscera of a dispatched walker, allowing them to successfully pass among the walkers, until a brief rainstorm washes off enough of the blood scent that they begin to draw attention. They make a break for the construction site, and Rick is able to reach the box truck. Glenn drives a [[Dodge Challenger]], its alarm blaring, to draw the attention of the walkers away from the store, while Rick drives the box truck to one of the store's cargo doors. The entire group (other than Merle, who is trapped on the roof of the store) is able to escape the city in the box truck, apart from Glenn, who drives away in the Challenger. Glenn races down the highway in his new Challenger and heads back to his group with Rick and his new group following behind in the box truck. In the episode \"[[Tell It to the Frogs]]\", they meet up with the rest of the survivors at the Atlanta campsite, where Glenn helps distribute supplies and assist others when needed. He later goes with Rick, [[Daryl Dixon|Daryl]], and T-Dog to find Merle in the city and help Rick regain the guns previously dropped near the tank. In the episode \"[[Vatos]]\", Glenn ends up getting kidnapped by a nursing home crew posing as gang bangers, who try to exchange him for weaponry. Glenn is released, but his group then finds out that the truck which they used to drive to the city is missing, leaving them with no choice but to return to the campsite on foot. Glenn and the rest of his teammates return to the camp just in time to witness a herd of walkers invade and kill many of the survivors. In the episode \"[[Wildfire (The Walking Dead)|Wildfire]]\", in the wake of the massacre, he assists in dealing with the corpses and insists that the group bury their people instead of burning them as they did the walkers they previously killed. Ultimately, he and the rest of the group leave the campsite and head to the [[Centers for Disease Control|CDC]]. Along the way Jim, a survivor who was bitten during the attack and has been battling the fever, finally gives in and requests to be left to die by the trees nearby which Glenn tries to argue but the group ultimately goes with Jim's choice. In the episode \"[[TS-19]]\", for a brief time, they enjoy the luxuries the CDC offers. They are on the road again, however, following the self-destruction of the CDC building.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 2)}}\nIn the season premiere \"[[What Lies Ahead]],\" Glenn continues to be a valuable asset to the group, helping to repair the RV and scavenging items from abandoned cars on the highway.

In the episode \"[[Save the Last One]],\" Glenn and T-Dog arrive at [[Hershel Greene]]'s farm, where Carl is recovering from a gunshot wound. He sparks up a friendship with Hershel's daughter Maggie when she catches him praying for Carl. In the episode \"[[Cherokee Rose (The Walking Dead)|Cherokee Rose]],\" Glenn agrees to act as live bait to draw a trapped walker out of a well, but this goes badly and he almost falls into the well. Glenn and Maggie later decide to go into town to get supplies from a pharmacy, when Lori discreetly asks him to get her a pregnancy test as well. When Maggie asks him what he's looking for, he tries to make an excuse and accidentally grabs a box of condoms. Maggie then seduces him and they have sex. In the episode \"[[Chupacabra (The Walking Dead)|Chupacabra]],\" Glenn learns that Lori is pregnant, and she begs him not to tell Rick. Maggie expresses to Glenn that their fling was a one-time thing, but Glenn tries to convince her that their romance should continue. Later at dinner, Maggie slips Glenn a note under the table asking him where they can have another sexual encounter; Glenn writes an answer and returns the note. After the meal ends Maggie opens the note with Glenn's response saying that he will meet her in the barn outside. A horrified Maggie hurries outside and runs toward the barn, but she is unable to prevent Glenn from discovering that the locked building is full of walkers. In the episode \"[[Secrets (The Walking Dead)|Secrets]],\" Maggie begs Glenn not to tell the others about the barn, but he soon reveals this secret and Lori's pregnancy to Dale. Maggie feels frustrated and betrayed by Glenn when he does not keep his promise that he will not reveal that walkers are in the barn. She forgives him soon afterwards however, and they start to engage in a relationship. In the mid-season finale \"[[Pretty Much Dead Already]],\" Glenn tells the rest of the group about the barn, and Shane eventually breaks the barn open, leading Glenn and the other survivors to kill all of the walkers as they file out of the barn, including a now-zombified Sophia.\n\nIn the mid-season premiere \"[[Nebraska (The Walking Dead)|Nebraska]],\" Hershel disappears after the incident at the barn. Before Glenn and Rick leave for town to find Maggie's father, Maggie tells Glenn she loves him. Glenn leaves before saying it back. They find Hershel in a bar and inform him that his youngest daughter, [[Beth Greene|Beth]], has collapsed and is in need of medical attention. They attempt to talk him into returning to the farm, but he refuses. Two men from another group, Dave and Tony, find them. An argument leads to a violent confrontation, and Rick kills the two men. In the episode \"[[Triggerfinger (The Walking Dead)|Triggerfinger]],\" more armed men from Dave and Tony's group come looking for them, and they get into a shootout with Glenn, Rick, and Hershel. Glenn is wracked with embarrassment and guilt after freezing during the shootout with outsiders. They capture one of the attackers, named [[Randall Culver|Randall]], before they all return to the farm. Glenn blames his inaction in town on his deep love for Maggie, and apparently breaks up with her when they get back to the farm. In the episode \"[[Judge, Jury, Executioner]],\" Hershel gives Glenn a family heirloom, representing his approval of Glenn's relationship with Maggie. In the episode \"[[Better Angels (The Walking Dead)|Better Angels]],\" when Randall apparently escapes, Rick, Shane, Daryl, and Glenn go on a manhunt for the fugitive; Shane leads Rick one direction while Daryl and Glenn comb another part of the woods. Glenn and Daryl find and kill Randall who has inexplicably reanimated from the dead as a walker despite no signs of a bite wound. In the season finale \"[[Beside the Dying Fire]],\" when the farm is overrun by walkers, Glenn plays a big part in its defense. During the chaos, he convinces Maggie to abandon the farmyard for the meantime so as to avoid any further danger. He later assures her that her family is safe, and seeing the right opportunity, confesses his love for her. The two eventually reunite with the other survivors at the highway. After discovering that Rick kept secret the fact that they are all infected, Glenn is among the survivors who grow wary of Rick. He and Maggie contemplate leaving camp and abandoning Rick's leadership. They, however, dismiss such thoughts after Rick taunts the group with the option of leaving on their own.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 3)}}\nIn the season premiere \"[[Seed (The Walking Dead)|Seed]],\" six to seven months after leaving the farm, Glenn has become increasingly proficient at fighting walkers. He and Maggie continue to have a strong relationship. The group finds a prison and decides to make it their new home. While clearing out part of the prison, Glenn and Maggie get separated from Hershel and Hershel gets bitten by a walker, forcing Rick to cut Hershel's leg off below the knee to prevent the infection from spreading. In the episode \"[[Sick (The Walking Dead)|Sick]],\" Glenn escorts Carol to the prison yard so that she can practice a C-section in preparation for Lori's delivery. In the episode \"[[Killer Within]],\" when [[Andrew (The Walking Dead)|Andrew]] lets walkers into the prison yard to attack the survivors, Glenn helps kill the walkers and stabilize the prison, but not before T-Dog and Lori are killed. In the episode \"[[Say the Word (The Walking Dead)|Say the Word]],\" Glenn finds Rick losing control and pleads for him to stop, but Rick nearly assaults Glenn. In the episode \"[[Hounded (The Walking Dead)|Hounded]],\" while out on a supply run, Glenn and Maggie are ambushed and captured by Merle and brought to Woodbury for interrogation. In the episode \"[[When the Dead Come Knocking]],\" Merle brutally beats Glenn while trying to find the whereabouts of their camp. Despite this, as well as being forced to fight a walker while strapped to a chair and having the [[The Governor (The Walking Dead)|Governor]] threaten to shoot Maggie, Glenn remains unbroken. But when the Governor threatens to shoot Glenn, Maggie tells her about the prison and their group. In the mid-season finale \"[[Made to Suffer]],\" when Glenn and Maggie attempt to escape, the Governor orders Merle to execute them; they fight back and Merle's group is overwhelmed by Rick's group. Rick, Glenn, and Maggie escape over the wall, and meet up with [[Michonne]].\n\nIn the mid-season premiere \"[[The Suicide King (The Walking Dead)|The Suicide King]],\" while Glenn remains behind, Rick and Maggie set off smoke grenades, killing several Woodbury residents and rescuing Merle and Daryl in the process. Glenn shows great frustration (at one point bludgeoning a walker pulled from a nearby vehicle) when he finds out that not only is Merle going with them, but Rick had not taken the opportunity to kill the Governor as well (still believing that he raped Maggie when they were held captive). They return to the prison without Merle and Daryl, but Glenn's relationship with Maggie begins to fall apart, despite her claims that the Governor threatened to cut off his hand if she refused to bow down to him. Rick has a breakdown while meeting [[Tyreese]]'s group, and Glenn escorts them out of the room when Rick starts yelling. In the episode \"[[Home (The Walking Dead)|Home]],\" with Rick losing control of himself, Glenn decides to impose himself as leader of the group, thinking about killing the Governor when he will not be expecting it. As he leaves on a scouting mission, he misses an attack made on the prison by the Governor, which results in [[Axel (The Walking Dead)|Axel]]'s death and the destruction of the main security gates. In the episode \"[[I Ain't a Judas]],\" when Rick argues with Hershel about leaving the prison, Glenn agrees with Rick that they should stay and fight. In the episode \"[[Arrow on the Doorpost]],\" Merle wants to kill the Governor during his meeting with Rick, but Glenn gets into a brawl with Merle to keep him from leaving the prison. Glenn begins to let go of some of his anger, and his relationship with Maggie improves.

Later, when Rick returns with the survivors from Woodbury, and Glenn opens the prison gates for them.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 4)}}\nIn the season premiere \"[[30 Days Without an Accident]],\" Glenn and Maggie get a pregnancy scare and decides to go out on a run in her place. When he gets back to the prison, Maggie tells him she is not pregnant. In the episode \"[[Infected (The Walking Dead)|Infected]],\" Glenn is seen shouting about walkers being in a cell block during an attack.

He heads to his room and finds the photo he took of Maggie. He grabs his riot gear, assault rifle, and an alcohol bottle from a survivor and heads out. Along the way, he encounters [[Tara Chambler|Tara]], a survivor of the attacking army. She explains that she was the reason behind this and has no need for living as she watched her sister and niece die. She also tells him about the death of Hershel, which leaves Glenn saddened. Glenn convinces her that they need each other to get out alive. Glenn throws the bottle at a nearby car to distract the walkers and he and Tara escape. Along the road, Tara mentions that The Governor told her that the prison group were bad people and she didn't believe him for one second. She then apologizes for everything. They both get attacked by walkers and Glenn passes out. As Tara kills the last zombie, a military truck pulls up and three people climb out: [[Abraham Ford]], [[Eugene Porter]], and [[Rosita Espinosa]]. In the episode \"[[Claimed]],\" Abraham convinces Tara to accompany them on their trek to Washington D.C. so Eugene can hopefully stop the virus and save the world, and they put an unconscious Glenn in the back of the truck. When Glenn wakes up, he bashes the back window until Abraham stops and gets out. Glenn insists on searching for Maggie, but when Abraham insists that Maggie is dead the two men brawl. The commotion draws walkers, and when Eugene tries to shoot them he accidentally cripples their vehicle. Glenn takes this as a sign that he should find Maggie and Tara decides to go with them, then Rosita follows and Eugene tells Abraham that they should go along until they can find a new vehicle. In the episode \"[[Alone (The Walking Dead)|Alone]],\" Glenn discovers a sign leading to Terminus. In the episode \"[[Us (The Walking Dead)|Us]],\" the group begins to see signs from Maggie that they should go to Terminus and when the group comes to a tunnel, Abraham can't bring himself to risk Eugene's life and they part ways, leaving Glenn and Tara to go through the tunnel alone. They come across the dead wandering around an area in the tunnel that has collapsed and while sneaking around them, Tara falls down the debris and is trapped. Glenn refuses to leave her and begins beating off the walkers, when they are rescued by Maggie, Sasha, Bob, Eugene, Abraham and Rosita. Reunited with Maggie, they all decide to continue to Terminus where they meet with the refugees.

They are taken to the slaughterhouse and lined up bending over a pig trough next where four other male survivors are brutally slaughtered over the pig trough but just as Glenn is next Gareth walks in and questions one of the guards about the survivors. An explosion caused by Carol distracts Gareth and allows Rick to break free from his cuffs, kill the guards, then set Glenn, Daryl and Bob free. The four soon discover that the people of Terminus are cannibals and Rick orders everyone shot on sight. They make their way back to the boxcar and free their friends as they fight their way out. As Glenn tries to oppose Rick's plan to go back they are reunited with Carol, Tyreese and Judith and move on. In the episode \"[[Strangers (The Walking Dead)|Strangers]],\" the group hear screams for help. They go and assist the man from a group of walkers. He introduces himself as Gabriel. He takes the survivors back to his church, which they quickly check is secure and not a trap. It's then decided that the group will need to go and fetch supplies. Glenn goes with Maggie and Tara to scavenge a weapons store, where he finds three silencers in a mini fridge. The group celebrate as Abraham makes a toast. In the episode \"[[Four Walls and a Roof]],\" the group discover Bob was captured by the cannibals of Terminus and is being used as bait, having been eaten on the leg. Bob reveals he is bitten, to which Glenn reminds to Rick that Jim had lasted two days before turning. When Abraham announces that he's taking Eugene and leaving to ensure his survival, an argument breaks out between him and Rick when he insists on taking the bus. Glenn manages to stop the argument by promising Abraham that if he stays for one more night to help deal with Gareth and the Hunters, then he and Maggie will leave with Abraham on the church bus the following morning. Abraham reluctantly agrees. Glenn says goodbye to Bob before he leaves to go to Washington with Maggie, Tara, Abraham, Eugene, and Rosita.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Self Help (The Walking Dead)|Self Help]],\" on their journey to DC, the bus crashes and the survivors face multiple walker problems including a herd consisting of thousands which Abraham tries to insist they go through despite Glenn attempting to reason with him.

However Glenn is doubtful that Noah's sanctuary is still there and his suspicions are proven true as they find the sanctuary in ruin and he and Rick start debating the logic in searching, and Beth's fate at [[Dawn Lerner|Dawn]]'s hand. Rick states he knew Dawn didn't mean to do it but would have killed her anyway if Daryl hadn't and Glenn noted that it wouldn't make a difference, making Michonne concerned about them debating killing someone makes her want to stop running and find a place to live. She later presses this when they find walker limbs, cut up, and insists on Washington again but Glenn is doubtful as Eugene was lying but Rick decides to take a chance. Later Glenn helps Michonne cut off Tyreese's arm when he is bitten and tries to haul him to safety, briefly being delayed by a truck opening and letting out numerous walker bodies with no arms and legs with \"w\"s cut into their foreheads, but Tyreese dies from blood loss and Glenn stands over his service. In the episode \"[[Them (The Walking Dead)|Them]],\" Glenn tries to comfort a grieving Maggie, still distraught over Beth's death, after she begins to doubt if she wants to live anymore. Glenn is also the sole member of the group with water during the drought and tries to make at least one member of the group drink some and later helps defend the barn they're staying in from a walker herd. In the episode \"[[The Distance (The Walking Dead)|The Distance]],\" when Maggie and Sasha bring in a stranger named [[Aaron (The Walking Dead)|Aaron]] who claims to have a community of good people nearby and wants them to join, Glenn leads a small group of Michonne, Maggie, Abraham and Rosita to investigate his claim of nearby cars. After learning he was telling to truth of the cars the group takes off at night to avoid suspicion but when they get paranoid about Aaron again they are forced to drive through a herd of walkers and escape on foot. However Glenn begins to trust Aaron again when they meet his boyfriend Eric, confirming his earlier claim there was only one person with him and begs Rick to do so as well. Later when the R.V. breaks down Glenn shows an angry Abraham where to find another battery to which he says\" how'd you know those were there?\" and Glenn just smiles, referencing Dale's teachings. Eventually the group arrives at Aaron's community the Alexandria Safe-Zone. In the episode \"[[Remember (The Walking Dead)|Remember]],\" Glenn and the others are interviewed by [[Deanna Monroe]], Alexandria's leader, and he admits the sense of brutality he has developed from being in the world for too long and how he needs to make it work and Deanna offers Glenn the job of supply runner. When the group is given two houses to divide among themselves they decide to sleep all together in one house to be cautious and the next day Glenn, Tara and Noah accompany Deanna's son Adien and his friend Nicholas on a run but learn they've strung a walker up as a warning and they try to reattach it which Glenn kills before it can kill Tara which enrages Adien. Once back at the safe zone Glenn provokes Aiden into fighting him until Rick and Deanna break it up and Deanna addresses the community to accept the group and personally thanks Glenn for knocking Aiden \"on his ass.\"\n\nIn the episode \"[[Forget (The Walking Dead)|Forget]],\" Glenn appears at the party at Deanna's house, where he assures Noah that he is family now. In the episode \"[[Spend (The Walking Dead)|Spend]],\" Glenn, Noah, Tara, Eugene, Aiden, and Nicholas head to a warehouse to scavenge parts to repair Alexandria's solar power system. As they approach the warehouse, they find that the front area is infested with walkers, though a cage prevents them from being able to enter. As the group enters, they encounter a zombified soldier wearing body armor. Despite Glenn's pleas not to shoot it, Aiden fires at the walker several times and hits one of its grenades, causing an explosion. Tara is critically wounded, and Aiden is apparently killed. The explosion also weakens the cage, allowing walkers to enter the warehouse. The group falls back, only to discover Aiden is still alive, but impaled by two pieces of metal. As Glenn, Noah, and Nicholas go to save Aiden, Eugene carries Tara out of the warehouse. With the walkers closing in, Nicholas panics and flees, forcing Glenn and Noah to abandon Aiden, who is eaten alive by walkers. Glenn, Noah, and Nicholas take shelter inside a revolving door, but are trapped by walkers on both sides. Eugene arrives in the van and lures the walkers on the outside away. However, Nicholas pushes his way out, leaving Glenn and Noah vulnerable. The walkers grab Noah and tear him apart as Glenn watches in horror. Nicholas goes to the van and tells Eugene they must leave immediately. When Eugene refuses, Nicholas pulls him out of the van and tries to leave without him. Glenn arrives and knocks Nicholas out. Glenn then proceeds to put him in the van, instead of leaving him behind. In the episode \"[[Try (The Walking Dead)|Try]],\" Glenn relates the true series of events to Rick. Deanna bans Glenn and Nicholas from the armory and leaving the Safe-Zone while she investigates. Glenn confronts Nicholas and tells him men like him should have died to the walkers, but he was lucky Alexandria's walls came up. Glenn threatens Nicholas, warning him never to set foot outside of the walls again.

While tracking him, Glenn is shot and wounded by Nicholas. Glenn manages to escape, and later attacks Nicholas when he is off-guard.

Nicholas begs for his life, and Glenn spares him.\n\n==== Season 6 ====\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 6)}}\nIn the season premiere \"[[First Time Again]],\" Glenn first appears in a flashback. In a flashback Glenn and Nicholas show at the infirmary both bloody and bruised from their fight in the woods. Glenn is patched up by Rosita and Maggie asks him what happened. Glenn tells her that walkers attacked him and Nicholas in the woods and Glenn was accidentally hit by a bullet that ricocheted off of a tree and hit him in the shoulder. Glenn later appears at Rick's meeting where they discuss how to get rid of the walker herd in the quarry. Glenn tells Maggie that she should stay in Alexandria and watch over Deanna who is still devastated over the deaths of Aiden and Reg. Maggie tells Glenn that's not the only reason he wants her to stay and Glenn acknowledges this. Glenn notices Nicholas and looks at him in disapproval. Nicholas raises his hand and says he wants to help Rick with the plan as they are going to need all help he can get. After Glenn sees this he offers to go too likely to watch Nicholas. Glenn later appears with he and Nicholas helping to build the wall to lure the walkers away. Glenn notices Maggie and Tara hugging which he smiles at. Glenn and Nicholas are later seen at the hardware store they are assigned to clear out. Glenn tells Nicholas that he will be keeping a close eye on him from now on. Nicholas tells him he just wants to help which Glenn says he can. At a shop between Alexandria and the quarry, Glenn, Heath, and Nicholas are tasked with killing a group of walkers trapped inside, so the noise made by the trapped walkers won't distract the approaching herd to veer off course. Glenn initially refuses to let Nicholas help, but Nicholas insists, and he saves Heath from being bitten by a walker. Later in the episode \"[[Thank You (The Walking Dead)|Thank You]]\" Glenn volunteers to start a distraction fire. Going with Nicholas, they run from the herd into a dead end alleyway, where they kill as many walkers as they can, but get trapped on top of a dumpster. Nicholas has a panic attack, says \"Thank you\" to Glenn, and shoots himself in the head. His body falls against Glenn, knocking him off the dumpster and into the herd of walkers. He is last seen lying on the ground underneath Nicholas' body, as the walkers begin to eat it. In the episode \"[[Now (The Walking Dead)|Now]],\" Maggie reveals that she is pregnant with Glenn's child. In the episode \"[[Heads Up (The Walking Dead)|Heads Up]],\" Glenn is seen escaping from underneath the dumpster. He is then found by Enid, whom he talks into returning with him to Alexandria. The two start to form an uneasy friendship despite having contrasting philosophies of survival. The two release balloons outside the walker-surrounded gates as a sign that they are alive. In the mid-season finale \"[[Start to Finish]],\" Glenn and Enid observe Maggie as she escapes from the herd that has invaded Alexandria, and they begin to formulate a plan to enter the city. In the episode \"[[Not Tomorrow Yet]],\" Glenn makes his first kill along with Heath and Tara and takes an active part in the gun battle with the Saviors. At the end of the episode he is distraught to learn that Maggie and Carol have been kidnapped by another group of Saviors. Maggie and Carol manage to escape and Glenn and Maggie are soon reunited. In \"[[East (The Walking Dead)|East]],\" Glenn leaves Alexandria with Rosita and Michonne to go after Daryl, who wants to avenge Denise's death by killing Dwight. All four end up captured by Dwight, who shoots Daryl. In the finale \"Last Day on Earth,\" the four are unloaded from the back of a truck by Dwight, where they discover Rick, Carl, Maggie, Abraham, Sasha, Eugene, and Aaron have already been captured. Negan announces his plan to beat one of them to death using his baseball bat called Lucille as punishment for the group having killed so many of his people. He initially offers to put the pregnant Maggie out of her misery then and there, causing Glenn to beg for her life; he is thrown back into the line by Dwight. After contemplating whom to kill, Negan decides to select at random by saying \"eenie, meanie, minie, mo.\" The season ends with Negan beating an unknown target to death.\n\n==== Season 7 ====\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 7)}}\nIn the seventh-season premiere, \"[[The Day Will Come When You Won't Be]]\", Abraham is revealed to be Negan's chosen victim; Negan brutally beats him to death with Lucille as the rest of the group watches, horrified. When Daryl strikes Negan in the face, Negan declares that he will need to kill someone else as punishment. He then strikes Glenn with Lucille. After two blows to the head, Glenn sits up, severely brain damaged with a dislocated eye and caved in skull, and mutters \"Maggie, I'll find you\", before Negan repeatedly bludgeons Glenn's skull into a bloody pulp. In \"[[The Cell (The Walking Dead)|The Cell]]\", Negan's henchman Dwight leaves a picture of Glenn's mangled corpse in Daryl's cell, where he is being held captive, to torment him. In \"[[Go Getters]]\", Glenn and Abraham are shown to be buried together at Hilltop.\n\n=== Video games ===\nGlenn's appearance in the first episode of [[The Walking Dead (2012 video game)|''The Walking Dead'' video game]] is his first chronological appearance in the franchise.

The girl, who has been infected, ends up killing herself before Glenn helps Lee's group escape.

There is a difference in how his death occurs: In the comic books, after being forced to their knees, Glenn was revealed to be the victim chosen outright to die. However, [[Abraham Ford]] received this fate on TV in the episode \"[[The Day Will Come When You Won't Be]].\" Glenn was still killed off in the same episode, with his demise being a result of [[Daryl Dixon]] disobeying Negan's rules. The deaths led to significant debate regarding the direction of the show. Some viewers and critics saw the deaths as too violent, with a number of them stating that the show had gone too far or that they would stop watching it; others felt that Glenn's death was needed because it reflects the comic book version and that both deaths show how brutal Negan can be.<ref>https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2016/10/30/was-glenns-violent-death-on-the-walking-dead-too-much/</ref><ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/24/the-walking-dead-signs-review |title=''The Walking Dead'': \"The Day Will Come When You Won't Be\" Review |last=Fowler |first=Matt |date=October 23, 2016 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/24/the-walking-dead-season-seven-premiere-the-day-will-come-when-you-wont-be |title=The Walking Dead season seven premiere: The Day Will Come When You Won't Be |last=Jeffries |first=Stuart |date=October 24, 2016 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nNoel Murray of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Glenn Rhee 6th in a list of 30 best ''Walking Dead'' characters, saying, \"Prior to his murder, the ever-upbeat ex-delivery man had been in the series as long as Rick, and though he'd seemed to be dead multiple times before, our man Glenn somehow persevered each and every time \u2026 except the last time.

Glenn grew up in Michigan with several sisters and moved to Atlanta. He worked as a pizza delivery boy, giving him in depth knowledge of Atlanta's layout. When the outbreak occurred, Glenn encountered another survivor named T-Dog (Theodore Douglas) and the two escaped Atlanta together and took refuge in a camp outside of the city led by Shane Walsh.\n\n==== Season 1 ====\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 1)}}\nIn the series premiere episode \"[[Days Gone Bye (The Walking Dead)|Days Gone Bye]]\", Glenn's voice is first heard using a radio to talk to Rick when Rick is hiding in a tank in the city of Atlanta. In the episode \"[[Guts (The Walking Dead)|Guts]]\", Glenn uses the radio to rescue Rick from the horde of walkers surrounding the tank, and guides Rick to the location of his group, which consists of [[Andrea (The Walking Dead)|Andrea]], [[T-Dog (The Walking Dead)|T-Dog]], [[Merle Dixon]], [[Jacqui (The Walking Dead)|Jacqui]], and [[Morales (The Walking Dead)|Morales]], hiding in a department store. The noise made by Rick as he and Glenn flee the horde draws the walkers to the store and the group finds themselves trapped inside. As the walkers try to break through the plate glass doors of the store, Rick decides to try to reach a box truck at a nearby construction site. To reach the truck, he and Glenn cover themselves in the blood and viscera of a dispatched walker, allowing them to successfully pass among the walkers, until a brief rainstorm washes off enough of the blood scent that they begin to draw attention. They make a break for the construction site, and Rick is able to reach the box truck. Glenn drives a [[Dodge Challenger]], its alarm blaring, to draw the attention of the walkers away from the store, while Rick drives the box truck to one of the store's cargo doors. The entire group (other than Merle, who is trapped on the roof of the store) is able to escape the city in the box truck, apart from Glenn, who drives away in the Challenger. Glenn races down the highway in his new Challenger and heads back to his group with Rick and his new group following behind in the box truck. In the episode \"[[Tell It to the Frogs]]\", they meet up with the rest of the survivors at the Atlanta campsite, where Glenn helps distribute supplies and assist others when needed. He later goes with Rick, [[Daryl Dixon|Daryl]], and T-Dog to find Merle in the city and help Rick regain the guns previously dropped near the tank. In the episode \"[[Vatos]]\", Glenn ends up getting kidnapped by a nursing home crew posing as gang bangers, who try to exchange him for weaponry. Glenn is released, but his group then finds out that the truck which they used to drive to the city is missing, leaving them with no choice but to return to the campsite on foot. Glenn and the rest of his teammates return to the camp just in time to witness a herd of walkers invade and kill many of the survivors. In the episode \"[[Wildfire (The Walking Dead)|Wildfire]]\", in the wake of the massacre, he assists in dealing with the corpses and insists that the group bury their people instead of burning them as they did the walkers they previously killed. Ultimately, he and the rest of the group leave the campsite and head to the [[Centers for Disease Control|CDC]]. Along the way Jim, a survivor who was bitten during the attack and has been battling the fever, finally gives in and requests to be left to die by the trees nearby which Glenn tries to argue but the group ultimately goes with Jim's choice. In the episode \"[[TS-19]]\", for a brief time, they enjoy the luxuries the CDC offers.

In the episode \"[[Chupacabra (The Walking Dead)|Chupacabra]],\" Glenn learns that Lori is pregnant, and she begs him not to tell Rick.

However, Nicholas pushes his way out, leaving Glenn and Noah vulnerable. The walkers grab Noah and tear him apart as Glenn watches in horror. Nicholas goes to the van and tells Eugene they must leave immediately. When Eugene refuses, Nicholas pulls him out of the van and tries to leave without him. Glenn arrives and knocks Nicholas out. Glenn then proceeds to put him in the van, instead of leaving him behind. In the episode \"[[Try (The Walking Dead)|Try]],\" Glenn relates the true series of events to Rick. Deanna bans Glenn and Nicholas from the armory and leaving the Safe-Zone while she investigates. Glenn confronts Nicholas and tells him men like him should have died to the walkers, but he was lucky Alexandria's walls came up. Glenn threatens Nicholas, warning him never to set foot outside of the walls again. In the season finale \"[[Conquer (The Walking Dead)|Conquer]],\" Glenn sees Nicholas climbing over the wall and grows suspicious and follows him out. While tracking him, Glenn is shot and wounded by Nicholas. Glenn manages to escape, and later attacks Nicholas when he is off-guard. A struggle ensues and Nicholas manages to escape, leaving Glenn to defend himself against walkers they attracted. As Nicholas tries to escape, Glenn tracks him down and holds him at gunpoint. Nicholas begs for his life, and Glenn spares him.\n\n==== Season 6 ====\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 6)}}\nIn the season premiere \"[[First Time Again]],\" Glenn first appears in a flashback. In a flashback Glenn and Nicholas show at the infirmary both bloody and bruised from their fight in the woods. Glenn is patched up by Rosita and Maggie asks him what happened. Glenn tells her that walkers attacked him and Nicholas in the woods and Glenn was accidentally hit by a bullet that ricocheted off of a tree and hit him in the shoulder. Glenn later appears at Rick's meeting where they discuss how to get rid of the walker herd in the quarry. Glenn tells Maggie that she should stay in Alexandria and watch over Deanna who is still devastated over the deaths of Aiden and Reg. Maggie tells Glenn that's not the only reason he wants her to stay and Glenn acknowledges this. Glenn notices Nicholas and looks at him in disapproval. Nicholas raises his hand and says he wants to help Rick with the plan as they are going to need all help he can get. After Glenn sees this he offers to go too likely to watch Nicholas. Glenn later appears with he and Nicholas helping to build the wall to lure the walkers away. Glenn notices Maggie and Tara hugging which he smiles at. Glenn and Nicholas are later seen at the hardware store they are assigned to clear out. Glenn tells Nicholas that he will be keeping a close eye on him from now on. Nicholas tells him he just wants to help which Glenn says he can. At a shop between Alexandria and the quarry, Glenn, Heath, and Nicholas are tasked with killing a group of walkers trapped inside, so the noise made by the trapped walkers won't distract the approaching herd to veer off course. Glenn initially refuses to let Nicholas help, but Nicholas insists, and he saves Heath from being bitten by a walker. Later in the episode \"[[Thank You (The Walking Dead)|Thank You]]\" Glenn volunteers to start a distraction fire. Going with Nicholas, they run from the herd into a dead end alleyway, where they kill as many walkers as they can, but get trapped on top of a dumpster. Nicholas has a panic attack, says \"Thank you\" to Glenn, and shoots himself in the head. His body falls against Glenn, knocking him off the dumpster and into the herd of walkers. He is last seen lying on the ground underneath Nicholas' body, as the walkers begin to eat it. In the episode \"[[Now (The Walking Dead)|Now]],\" Maggie reveals that she is pregnant with Glenn's child. In the episode \"[[Heads Up (The Walking Dead)|Heads Up]],\" Glenn is seen escaping from underneath the dumpster. He is then found by Enid, whom he talks into returning with him to Alexandria. The two start to form an uneasy friendship despite having contrasting philosophies of survival. The two release balloons outside the walker-surrounded gates as a sign that they are alive. In the mid-season finale \"[[Start to Finish]],\" Glenn and Enid observe Maggie as she escapes from the herd that has invaded Alexandria, and they begin to formulate a plan to enter the city. In the episode \"[[Not Tomorrow Yet]],\" Glenn makes his first kill along with Heath and Tara and takes an active part in the gun battle with the Saviors. At the end of the episode he is distraught to learn that Maggie and Carol have been kidnapped by another group of Saviors. Maggie and Carol manage to escape and Glenn and Maggie are soon reunited. In \"[[East (The Walking Dead)|East]],\" Glenn leaves Alexandria with Rosita and Michonne to go after Daryl, who wants to avenge Denise's death by killing Dwight. All four end up captured by Dwight, who shoots Daryl. In the finale \"Last Day on Earth,\" the four are unloaded from the back of a truck by Dwight, where they discover Rick, Carl, Maggie, Abraham, Sasha, Eugene, and Aaron have already been captured. Negan announces his plan to beat one of them to death using his baseball bat called Lucille as punishment for the group having killed so many of his people. He initially offers to put the pregnant Maggie out of her misery then and there, causing Glenn to beg for her life; he is thrown back into the line by Dwight. After contemplating whom to kill, Negan decides to select at random by saying \"eenie, meanie, minie, mo.\" The season ends with Negan beating an unknown target to death.\n\n==== Season 7 ====\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 7)}}\nIn the seventh-season premiere, \"[[The Day Will Come When You Won't Be]]\", Abraham is revealed to be Negan's chosen victim; Negan brutally beats him to death with Lucille as the rest of the group watches, horrified. When Daryl strikes Negan in the face, Negan declares that he will need to kill someone else as punishment. He then strikes Glenn with Lucille. After two blows to the head, Glenn sits up, severely brain damaged with a dislocated eye and caved in skull, and mutters \"Maggie, I'll find you\", before Negan repeatedly bludgeons Glenn's skull into a bloody pulp. In \"[[The Cell (The Walking Dead)|The Cell]]\", Negan's henchman Dwight leaves a picture of Glenn's mangled corpse in Daryl's cell, where he is being held captive, to torment him. In \"[[Go Getters]]\", Glenn and Abraham are shown to be buried together at Hilltop.\n\n=== Video games ===\nGlenn's appearance in the first episode of [[The Walking Dead (2012 video game)|''The Walking Dead'' video game]] is his first chronological appearance in the franchise. The character is voiced by Nick Herman. [[Lee Everett]] works with Glenn in \"A New Day,\" revealing that they are both from [[Macon, Georgia]]. Glenn volunteers to go out and scavenge for the survivors hiding out in Lee's family's pharmacy, but is pinned down by walkers at a local motel while trying to rescue a trapped girl, and the player must go out to save him. The girl, who has been infected, ends up killing herself before Glenn helps Lee's group escape. Glenn decides to leave the group at the end of the episode and return to Atlanta to find his friends, tying into his comic and television appearance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telltalegames.com/community/blogs/id-962 |title=Meet the Survivors: Glenn and Hershel |author= |date=6 April 2012 |work=[[Telltale Games]] |publisher=Telltale, Incorporated |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623162812/http://www.telltalegames.com/community/blogs/id-962 |archivedate=23 June 2013 |accessdate=30 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2550705/filmotype |title=Nick Herman Filmography |author= |date= |work=[[Internet Movie Database]] |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=30 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Casting and characterization ===\nSteven Yeun was announced to be part of the main cast in May 2010, along with [[Laurie Holden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2596657/the-walking-dead-tv-series-cast-2/|title='The Walking Dead' TV Series Adds Two More Cast Members|first=Rick Marshall|last=05/05/2010|work=mtv.com}}</ref> Former showrunner and executive producer [[Glen Mazzara]] describes Glenn as \"the heart of the show.\" He said that \"everybody loves that character; everybody\u2019s rooting for that character.

However, [[Abraham Ford]] received this fate on TV in the episode \"[[The Day Will Come When You Won't Be]].\" Glenn was still killed off in the same episode, with his demise being a result of [[Daryl Dixon]] disobeying Negan's rules. The deaths led to significant debate regarding the direction of the show. Some viewers and critics saw the deaths as too violent, with a number of them stating that the show had gone too far or that they would stop watching it; others felt that Glenn's death was needed because it reflects the comic book version and that both deaths show how brutal Negan can be.<ref>https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2016/10/30/was-glenns-violent-death-on-the-walking-dead-too-much/</ref><ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/24/the-walking-dead-signs-review |title=''The Walking Dead'': \"The Day Will Come When You Won't Be\" Review |last=Fowler |first=Matt |date=October 23, 2016 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/24/the-walking-dead-season-seven-premiere-the-day-will-come-when-you-wont-be |title=The Walking Dead season seven premiere: The Day Will Come When You Won't Be |last=Jeffries |first=Stuart |date=October 24, 2016 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nNoel Murray of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Glenn Rhee 6th in a list of 30 best ''Walking Dead'' characters, saying, \"Prior to his murder, the ever-upbeat ex-delivery man had been in the series as long as Rick, and though he'd seemed to be dead multiple times before, our man Glenn somehow persevered each and every time \u2026 except the last time.

This included the [[Lend-Lease]] program, which \"lent\" a wide array of resources and weapons to many countries, especially Great Britain and the [[USSR]], ostensibly to be repaid after the war. In practice, the United States frequently either did not push for repayment, or \"sold\" the goods for a nominal price, such as 10% of their value.

They practiced a sort of ''jirga'' system with two types of councils \u2013 ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' and ''{{transl|pus|sabh\u0101}}''. The ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' (summit) comprised elders and tribal chiefs. The king also joined sessions of the ''{{transl|pus|simite}}''. ''Sabh\u0101'' was a sort of rural council. In India it is referred to as ''Samiti'' and ''Sabha''.\n\nIt was used over time for the selection of rulers and headmen and the airing of matters of principle. From the time of the great Kushan ruler [[Kanishka]] to the 1970s, there were sixteen [[nation]]al ''loya jirgas'' and hundreds of smaller ones. The institution, which is centuries old, is a similar idea to the Islamic ''[[shura]]'' (consultative assembly).<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nIn the [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan society]], the ''loya jirga'' is still maintained and favored, mostly by tribal leaders to solve internal or external disputes with other tribes. In some cases it functions like a [[town hall meeting]].\n\nWhen the Afghans took power they tried to legitimize their hold with such a ''jirga''. While in the beginning only Pashtuns were allowed to participate in the ''jirgas'', later other ethnic groups like [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] and [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] were allowed to participate as well, however they were little more than observers. The member of the ''jirgas'' were mostly members of the Royal Family, religious leaders and tribal leaders of the Afghans. King [[Amanullah Khan]] institutionalized the ''jirga''. From Amanullah until the reign of [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] (1933\u20131973) and [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] (1973\u20131978) the ''jirga'' was recognized as a common meeting of regional Pashtun leaders.\n\nThe meetings do not have scheduled occurrences, but rather are called for when issues or disputes arise. There is no time limit for a ''loya jirga'' to conclude, and the meetings often take time because decisions can only be made as a group and arguments can drag out for days. Various issues can be addressed such as major disaster, foreign policy, declaration of war, the legitimacy of leaders, and the introduction of new ideas and laws.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nSome of the historical ''loya jirgas'' in the [[history of Afghanistan]] are:\n*'''1707\u20131709''' \u2013 ''Loya jirga'' was gathered by [[Mir Wais Hotak]] at [[Kandahar]] in 1707, but according to [[Ghulam Mohammad Ghobar]] it was gathered in Manja in 1709.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wolas.beepworld.de/mirwaisneeka.htm |title=Mirwais Neeka |publisher=Wolas.beepworld.de |date= |accessdate=2013-04-15}}</ref>\n*'''October 1747''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Kandahar]] was attended by Afghan representatives who appointed [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] as their new leader.\n*'''September 1928''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Paghman]], called by [[King Amanullah]], the third loya jirga of his reign (1919\u20131929) to discuss reforms.\n*'''September 1930''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' of 286 called by [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]] to confirm his accession to the throne.\n*'''1941''' \u2013 Called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve neutrality in [[World War II]].\n*'''1947''' \u2013 Held by Pashtuns in the [[FATA|Tribal Agencies]] to choose between joining [[India]] or [[Pakistan]].\n*'''July 26, 1949''' \u2013 [[Afghanistan-Pakistan relations]] rapidly deteriorated over a dispute, officially declared that it did not recognize the 1893 [[Durand Line]] border any longer between the two countries.<ref>Agha Amin, [http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 \"Resolving the Afghan-Pakistan Border Question\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012045458/http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 |date=October 12, 2008}}, ''Journal of Afghanistan Studies'', Kabul, (accessed December 12, 2009).</ref>\n*'''September 1964''' \u2013 A meeting of 452 called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve a new constitution.\n*'''July 1974''' \u2013 A meeting with Pakistan over the Durand Line.\n*'''[[1977 Afghan Constitutional Assembly election|January 1977]]''' \u2013 Approved the new constitution of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] establishing one-party rule in the [[Daouds Republic of Afghanistan|Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''April 1985''' \u2013 To ratify the new constitution of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''September 2001''' \u2013 Four different loya jirga movements anticipating the end of [[Taliban]] rule.

They practiced a sort of ''jirga'' system with two types of councils \u2013 ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' and ''{{transl|pus|sabh\u0101}}''. The ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' (summit) comprised elders and tribal chiefs. The king also joined sessions of the ''{{transl|pus|simite}}''. ''Sabh\u0101'' was a sort of rural council. In India it is referred to as ''Samiti'' and ''Sabha''.\n\nIt was used over time for the selection of rulers and headmen and the airing of matters of principle. From the time of the great Kushan ruler [[Kanishka]] to the 1970s, there were sixteen [[nation]]al ''loya jirgas'' and hundreds of smaller ones. The institution, which is centuries old, is a similar idea to the Islamic ''[[shura]]'' (consultative assembly).<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nIn the [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan society]], the ''loya jirga'' is still maintained and favored, mostly by tribal leaders to solve internal or external disputes with other tribes. In some cases it functions like a [[town hall meeting]].\n\nWhen the Afghans took power they tried to legitimize their hold with such a ''jirga''. While in the beginning only Pashtuns were allowed to participate in the ''jirgas'', later other ethnic groups like [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] and [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] were allowed to participate as well, however they were little more than observers. The member of the ''jirgas'' were mostly members of the Royal Family, religious leaders and tribal leaders of the Afghans. King [[Amanullah Khan]] institutionalized the ''jirga''. From Amanullah until the reign of [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] (1933\u20131973) and [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] (1973\u20131978) the ''jirga'' was recognized as a common meeting of regional Pashtun leaders.\n\nThe meetings do not have scheduled occurrences, but rather are called for when issues or disputes arise. There is no time limit for a ''loya jirga'' to conclude, and the meetings often take time because decisions can only be made as a group and arguments can drag out for days. Various issues can be addressed such as major disaster, foreign policy, declaration of war, the legitimacy of leaders, and the introduction of new ideas and laws.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nSome of the historical ''loya jirgas'' in the [[history of Afghanistan]] are:\n*'''1707\u20131709''' \u2013 ''Loya jirga'' was gathered by [[Mir Wais Hotak]] at [[Kandahar]] in 1707, but according to [[Ghulam Mohammad Ghobar]] it was gathered in Manja in 1709.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wolas.beepworld.de/mirwaisneeka.htm |title=Mirwais Neeka |publisher=Wolas.beepworld.de |date= |accessdate=2013-04-15}}</ref>\n*'''October 1747''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Kandahar]] was attended by Afghan representatives who appointed [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] as their new leader.\n*'''September 1928''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Paghman]], called by [[King Amanullah]], the third loya jirga of his reign (1919\u20131929) to discuss reforms.\n*'''September 1930''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' of 286 called by [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]] to confirm his accession to the throne.\n*'''1941''' \u2013 Called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve neutrality in [[World War II]].\n*'''1947''' \u2013 Held by Pashtuns in the [[FATA|Tribal Agencies]] to choose between joining [[India]] or [[Pakistan]].\n*'''July 26, 1949''' \u2013 [[Afghanistan-Pakistan relations]] rapidly deteriorated over a dispute, officially declared that it did not recognize the 1893 [[Durand Line]] border any longer between the two countries.<ref>Agha Amin, [http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 \"Resolving the Afghan-Pakistan Border Question\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012045458/http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 |date=October 12, 2008}}, ''Journal of Afghanistan Studies'', Kabul, (accessed December 12, 2009).</ref>\n*'''September 1964''' \u2013 A meeting of 452 called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve a new constitution.\n*'''July 1974''' \u2013 A meeting with Pakistan over the Durand Line.\n*'''[[1977 Afghan Constitutional Assembly election|January 1977]]''' \u2013 Approved the new constitution of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] establishing one-party rule in the [[Daouds Republic of Afghanistan|Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''April 1985''' \u2013 To ratify the new constitution of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''September 2001''' \u2013 Four different loya jirga movements anticipating the end of [[Taliban]] rule.

He remained in the military during the post-war period and was commissioned in the [[Bombay Sappers|Bombay Sappers Regiment]] of the Indian Army's [[Indian Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] on 15 December 1947. In April 1948, during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]], Rane played a key role in the capture of Rajauri by Indian forces by being instrumental in clearing several roadblocks and minefields. His actions helped clear the way for advancing Indian tanks. He was awarded the Param Vir Chakra on 8 April 1948 for his gallantry. He retired as a [[major]] from the Indian Army in 1968. During his 28 years' service with the army, he was [[mentioned in despatches]] five times.

He was the son of Raghoba. P. Rane, a police constable from Chendia village of [[Uttara Kannada]] district in [[Karnataka]].{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=56}} Rane's early education, mostly in district school, was chaotic due to his father's frequent transfers. In 1930, he became influenced by the [[Non-Cooperation Movement]], which agitated for Indian independence from Great Britain. His involvement with the movement alarmed his father, who moved the family back to their ancestral village at Chendia.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=57}}\n\n==Military career==\nAt the age of 22, Rane decided to join the [[British Indian Army]], while the [[Second World War]] was in full swing. On 10 July 1940, Rane enlisted in the [[Bombay Engineer Group|Bombay Engineer Regiment]], and passed out as the \"Best Recruit\", awarded the Commandant's Cane. Subsequently, he was promoted to ''[[Naik (military rank)|Naik]]'' ([[corporal]]).{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=57}}\n\nAfter his training, Rane was posted to the 28th Field Company, an [[Military engineering|engineering unit]] of the [[26th Indian Infantry Division|26th Infantry Division]] which, at the time, was fighting the [[Burma Campaign|Japanese in Burma]]. As his division retreated from the Japanese after the failed [[Arakan Campaign 1942\u201343|Arakan Campaign]], he, along with his two sections, was hand-picked by his company commander to stay back behind at [[Buthidaung]] to destroy key assets and then be evacuated by the [[Royal Indian Navy]]. Though the objective was soon achieved, the expected pickup did not happen. This forced Rane and his men to cross a river that was patrolled by the Japanese to reach their lines.

At 1100 hours, on that date near Nadpur South, just as Second Lieutenant Rane and his party were waiting near the tanks to start the work of clearing the mines ahead, the enemy started heavy mortaring of the area, with the result that two men of the mine-clearing party were killed and five others including Second Lieutenant Rane were wounded. The officer at once reorganized his party and started work for the tanks to go on to their position.  Throughout the day he was near the tanks under heavy enemy machine-gun and mortar fire. After the capture of Barwali Ridge at about 1630 hours, although knowing that the enemy had not been completely cleared of the area, Second Lieutenant Rane took his party ahead and started making a diversion for the tanks to proceed.  He worked on till 2200 hours that night in full view of the enemy and under heavy machine-gun fire. On 9 April he again started work at 0600 hours and worked on till 1500hrs when the diversion was ready for the tanks to proceed.  As the armoured column advanced, he got into the leading carrier and proceeded ahead.  After proceeding about half a mile he came across a roadblock made of pine trees.  He at once dismounted and blasted the trees away.  The advance continued.  Another 300 yards and the same story was repeated.  By this time it was getting on to 1700 hours.  The road was curving round the hill like a snake.  The next roadblock was a demolished culvert.  Second Lieutenant Rane again got on with the job.  Before he could start work, the enemy opened up with their machine-guns, but with super courage and leadership he made a diversion and the column proceeded ahead.  The roadblocks were becoming numerous but he blasted his way through.  It was now 1815 hours, and light was fading fast. The carrier came across a formidable roadblock of five big pine trees surrounded by mines and covered by machine-gun fire.  He started removing the mines and was determined to clear the roadblock but the armoured column commander appreciating the situation got the column into a harbour area. On 10 April 1948 at 0445 hours, Second Lieutenant Rane again started work on the roadblock in spite of machine-gun fire with the support of one troops of tanks.  With sheer will power he cleared this roadblock by 0630hours.  The next thousand yards was a mass of roadblocks and blasted embankments.  That was not all.  The enemy had the whole area covered with machine-gun fire but with superhuman efforts, in spite of having been wounded, with cool courage and exemplary leadership and complete disregard for personal life, he cleared the road by 1030 hours. The armoured column proceeded ahead and got off the road into the riverbed of the Tawi but Second Lieutenant Rane continued clearing the road for the administrative column.  The tanks reached Chingas by 1400 hours.  Second Lieutenant Rane appreciating that the opening of the road was most vital, continued working without rest or food till 2100 hours that night. On 11 April 1948, he again started work at 0600 hours and opened the road to Chingas by 1100 hours.

He worked on till 2200 hours that night in full view of the enemy and under heavy machine-gun fire. On 9 April he again started work at 0600 hours and worked on till 1500hrs when the diversion was ready for the tanks to proceed.  As the armoured column advanced, he got into the leading carrier and proceeded ahead.  After proceeding about half a mile he came across a roadblock made of pine trees.  He at once dismounted and blasted the trees away.  The advance continued.  Another 300 yards and the same story was repeated.  By this time it was getting on to 1700 hours.  The road was curving round the hill like a snake.  The next roadblock was a demolished culvert.  Second Lieutenant Rane again got on with the job.  Before he could start work, the enemy opened up with their machine-guns, but with super courage and leadership he made a diversion and the column proceeded ahead.  The roadblocks were becoming numerous but he blasted his way through.  It was now 1815 hours, and light was fading fast. The carrier came across a formidable roadblock of five big pine trees surrounded by mines and covered by machine-gun fire.  He started removing the mines and was determined to clear the roadblock but the armoured column commander appreciating the situation got the column into a harbour area. On 10 April 1948 at 0445 hours, Second Lieutenant Rane again started work on the roadblock in spite of machine-gun fire with the support of one troops of tanks.  With sheer will power he cleared this roadblock by 0630hours.  The next thousand yards was a mass of roadblocks and blasted embankments.  That was not all.  The enemy had the whole area covered with machine-gun fire but with superhuman efforts, in spite of having been wounded, with cool courage and exemplary leadership and complete disregard for personal life, he cleared the road by 1030 hours. The armoured column proceeded ahead and got off the road into the riverbed of the Tawi but Second Lieutenant Rane continued clearing the road for the administrative column.  The tanks reached Chingas by 1400 hours.  Second Lieutenant Rane appreciating that the opening of the road was most vital, continued working without rest or food till 2100 hours that night. On 11 April 1948, he again started work at 0600 hours and opened the road to Chingas by 1100 hours.  He worked on that night till 2200 hours clearing the road ahead.\n|source=<ref name=\"Citation: Maj Rama Raghoba Rane, PVC  @ TWDI\">{{cite web|title=Citation: Maj Rama Raghoba Rane, PVC  @ TWDI|url=http://twdi.in/node/1070|website=The War Decorated India & Trust|accessdate=27 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501062145/http://twdi.in/node/1070|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 May 2016}}</ref>\n|author=Gazette Notification: 5 Pres/50, 21-6-50\n}}\n\n===Subsequent career and later life===\nAfter the war, Rane was promoted to lieutenant on 14 January 1950 and to captain on 14 January 1954.<ref name=\"gazette_reg_commission\">{{cite news |title=Part I-Section 4: Ministry of Defence (Army Branch) |page=179  |date=9 August 1958 |website= |publisher=The Gazette of India}}</ref> On 27 May 1955, he received a regular commission as a captain, with the service number IC-7244.<ref name=\"gazette_reg_commission\"/> He retired with the rank of [[major]] on 25 June 1968.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=58}}{{refn|It is unclear when Rane was promoted to major.
