It is often mistakenly described as 4.5 miles long, but even taking in the gap between the two sections it still only totals 3.1-miles (5.0km). The route follows the bridges and cuttings of the line, but avoids the closed surface section of [[Highgate tube station|Highgate station]] and its adjoining tunnels, which are closed to walkers for safety reasons. The walk is almost all in [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]], but a short stretch between [[Crouch Hill]] and [[Crouch End Hill]] is in [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], and this section incorporates '''Crouch Hill Park'''.<ref name=islpg>{{cite web | url = http://www.islington.gov.uk/services/parks-environment/parks/islington_nature_reserves/Pages/parkland_walk.aspx | title = Parkland Walk | publisher = London Borough of Islington | accessdate = 12 February 2015 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150212131957/http://www.islington.gov.uk/services/parks-environment/parks/islington_nature_reserves/Pages/parkland_walk.aspx | archivedate = 12 February 2015 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=LNR>{{cite web|url= http://www.lnr.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/lnr/lnr_details.asp?C=0&N=parkland&ID=328|title= Parkland Walk|series=Local Nature Reserves|publisher=Natural England| date = 6 March 2013 |accessdate= 22 January 2014}}</ref><ref name=magic>{{cite web|url=http://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?startTopic=Designations&activelayer=lnrIndex&query=REF_CODE%3D%271009064%27 |title=Map of Parkland Walk|series=Local Nature Reserves|publisher=Natural England| accessdate=  22 January 2014}}</ref><ref name=GIGL>{{cite web|url=http://www.gigl.org.uk/igigl/siteDetails.aspx?sID=M116&sType=sinc|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121224042646/http://www.gigl.org.uk/igigl/siteDetails.aspx?sID=M116&sType=sinc|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 December 2012|title=Parkland Walk, Queen's Wood and Highgate Wood|publisher=Greenspace Information for Greater London|year=2006|accessdate=10 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=harpg>{{cite web | url = http://www.haringey.gov.uk/index/community_and_leisure/greenspaces/parks_and_open_spaces_parks_facilities/parklandwalk.htm | title = Parkland Walk Local Nature Reserve | publisher = London Borough of Haringey | accessdate = 30 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe walk is a [[local nature reserve]] and a [[Site of Nature Conservation Interest|Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation]]. It was declared a local nature reserve in 1990 and is London's longest such reserve. Between Finsbury Park and Highgate, the path forms part of the [[Capital Ring]] strategic walking route.<ref name=islpg/><ref name=LNR/><ref name=magic/><ref name=GIGL/><ref name=harpg/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Railway Platforms on Parkland Walk.JPG|thumb|The old platforms at [[Crouch End railway station|Crouch End station]].]]\n\n===Railway line===\nThe route of the path between [[Finsbury Park]] and [[Highgate]] was originally constructed by the [[Edgware, Highgate and London Railway]] in the 1860s as part of its railway line from [[Finsbury Park]] to [[Edgware]].  Before the line was opened on 22 August 1867, it was purchased by the larger [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR). Branch lines from [[Finchley]] to [[High Barnet]], and from Highgate to [[Alexandra Palace]], opened in 1872 and 1873. The GNR became part of the [[London and North Eastern Railway|London & North Eastern Railway]] (LNER) in 1923.<ref name=CULG_1>{{cite web | url = http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/northern.html#dates | title = Clive's Underground Line Guides - Northern Line | accessdate = 11 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=dshs>{{cite web | url = http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/h/highgate/ | title = Highgate Station | publisher = Disused stations | accessdate =  11 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nPlans were published by [[London Underground]] in the 1930s for the incorporation of these lines into the [[Northern line]] ([[Northern line#The Northern Heights plan|The Northern Heights Plan]]), but the onset of [[World War II]] stopped the work at an advanced stage. After the war the development plan was abandoned but passenger trains continued to run on this line until 3 July 1954, when [[British Railways]] (the successor to the LNER) ended such services permanently. The Alexandra Palace branch closed completely in 1957, but the link from Finsbury Park to Highgate and East Finchley remained open to freight traffic until 1964. Even after freight traffic had ceased, the line continued to be used to transfer empty tube stock between lines. This ceased in 1970 because of the poor condition of some of the intermediate bridges, and the track was lifted in 1972.<ref name=CULG_1/><ref name=dshs/>\n\n===Creation of the walk===\nAfter the track was lifted, most of the platforms and station buildings were demolished. The sections of the line from Finsbury Park to Highgate, and from Highgate to Alexandra Palace, (but not the intermediate section through the tunnels and station at Highgate) were converted into the Parkland Walk. This was officially opened in 1984 following extensive re-surfacing and improvements to access. In the late 1980s the park was threatened by a plan to build a road along its route, but the plan was withdrawn following local opposition which was coordinated by The Friends of the Parkland Walk.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.parkland-walk.org.uk/history | title = History of Parkland Walk | publisher = The Friends of the Parkland Walk | accessdate = 9 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe walk was declared a [[local nature reserve]] in 1990.{{citation needed | reason = opening year as walk and nature reserve|date=February 2015}}\n\n==Route description==\n\n===Finsbury Park to Crouch Hill===\nFrom the [[Finsbury Park (area)|Finsbury Park]] end the route starts from the western side of the existing East Coast Main Line beside a foot overbridge that gives access from the eastern end of Oxford Road to [[Finsbury Park]] itself. The route rises on an embankment overlooking the back gardens of the Victorian suburban houses. The route then bridges Upper Tollington Park.\n\nThe next bridge takes the walk over Stapleton Hall Road at a point where the [[Gospel Oak to Barking Line|Gospel Oak to Barking rail line]] also passes beneath the road. [[Stroud Green railway station|Stroud Green station]] once stood at this point, with its platforms cantilevered out over the sides of the bridge over Stapleton Hall Road. The station master's house still survives at road level, but there are no traces of the track- or road-side station buildings, which were destroyed in a fire in 1967.<ref name=dssgs>{{cite web | url = http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/s/stroud_green/index.shtml | title = Stroud Green Station | work = Disused Stations | accessdate = 8 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter crossing Mount Pleasant Villas on an overbridge, the embankment gives way to a cutting as the land rises north-westwards. The route continues beneath overbridges carrying Mount View Road, and [[Crouch Hill]].\n\n===Crouch Hill to Crouch End Hill===\nImmediately after  passing under Crouch Hill to the left can be seen a large  block house originally built to house switching gear for the Northern Heights as part of the plans to incorporate the line into the tube system. This has been redeveloped by adding extensions, cantilevered off the north and west sides of the existing building, and extending a short distance over the Parkland Walk. Now known as ''The Cape'', it is managed directly by Islington Council and houses a community energy centre, a youth centre, a new ecology centre and Ashmount School's \"after School Club\". There is a public cafe in the building to which there is direct access from the Parkland Walk.\n\nPassing the blockhouse, the walk enters Crouch Hill Park, which spreads to the south of the old railway line. The new park has a triangular form covering an area of {{convert|25730|m2}}, which is bounded by the walkway to the north and housing on the other sides, and is home to birds, invertebrates and bats, including some species locally uncommon or declining. It can be accessed from a number of access points on the Parkland Walk, from a public footpath called the Vicarage Path and from pedestrian entrances to the South and West of the park. A new building within the park contains [[Ashmount School]], a community primary school, and [[Bowlers Community Nursery]], a separate charity-run voluntary nursery.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://bowlersnursery.org | title =Bowlers Community Nursery | publisher = Bowlers Community Nursery | accessdate = 8 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nBeyond the site of the new school building, and just before Crouch End Station is a footbridge across the Parkland Walk dating back to the original railway, (so originally a crossing over  the railway) which was retained and now connects Hazelemere Road, in Haringey, to the Crouch Hill Park in Islington.\n\nAt this point the still intact but partly overgrown platforms of [[Crouch End railway station|Crouch End Station]] remain at the end of which the route passes under the site of the former station building and the road bridge over the cutting carrying [[Crouch End Hill]].\n\n===Crouch End Hill to Highgate tunnels===\n[[File:Parkland Walk.JPG|thumb|Parkland Walk]]\nBeyond this the cutting opens out on the northern side as the route skirts a hill, parallel to Hornsey Lane where some apartment blocks have been built. The route bridges Stanhope Road on a footbridge replacing the original structure. The route continues on an embankment to a brick-built bridge over Northwood Road, beneath which traffic can flow in only one direction at a time. The surrounding ground rises rapidly and the route becomes a cutting at the end of which the portals of the southern pair of Highgate tunnels come into view. Vestiges of line-side electrical equipment for the planned 1930s electrification of the line and part of the structure of the old Highgate station are visible through the tunnels. The tunnels are closed to pedestrian access. Consequently, the main route ends here with an exit onto Holmesdale Road. Should the walker choose to proceed further they can travel uphill along Holmesdale Road which soon joins [[Archway Road]]. Continuing along Archway Road, travelling north past [[Highgate station]], leads to the junction between Archway Road and [[Muswell Hill Road]].\n\n===Cranley Gardens to Alexandra Palace===\nThe route between the northern end of the Highgate Tunnels to the Northern line depot at [[Wellington Junction]] is used by trains entering the depot, while the rest of the cutting round [[Highgate Wood]] from Wellington Junction to [[Cranley Gardens railway station|Cranley Gardens]] is outside the wood's fence, not officially part of Parkland Walk, and so is allowed to stay overgrown.\n\nA further shorter section of the walk begins along Muswell Hill Road, just beyond Cranley Gardens, where the road overbridge crosses the old line. The site of the former [[Cranley Gardens railway station|Cranley Gardens station]] and the old trackbed has been replaced with housing. The walk continues opposite via steps down to the trackbed towards Alexandra Palace, which skirts a hill. The span of the seventeen-arch viaduct over St James's Lane gives a view eastwards and southwards over London. The route ends with a reconstructed overbridge under Muswell Hill itself. At this point Muswell Hill primary school has been built on the trackbed. The pedestrian route bypasses the primary school and leads into Alexandra Palace Park proper.  Further remains of the rail route can be seen in [[Alexandra Park, London|Alexandra Park]]. The [[Alexandra Palace railway station (Muswell Hill branch)|Alexandra Palace station building]] still exists and is used for community purposes.<ref>http://www.cufos.org.uk/</ref>\n\n[[File:Parkland Walk Islington.jpg|thumb|Parkland Walk in [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] with the Crouch Hill bridge]]\n\n==Wildlife==\n\n===Flora===\n\nNo trees were permitted to grow close to the track when the railway was operational. The range of trees found today has grown up in the last fifty years. Most arrived naturally ([[oak]], [[Ash tree|ash]], [[birch]], [[Crataegus|hawthorn]], [[cherry]], [[apple tree|apple]], [[holly]], [[rowan]], [[Sycamore Maple|sycamore]] and [[taxus|yew]]), but a few additional species have been planted ([[field maple]], [[hazel]], [[black poplar|black Italian poplar]] and [[Populus alba|white poplar]]).\n\nMore than three hundred species of wild flowers have been recorded on the Parkland Walk. They range from commonplace to exotic. Species sighted include [[Michaelmas daisy|Michaelmas daisies]], [[golden rod]]s, [[buddleia]] and [[Guernsey Fleabane|Guernsey fleabane]].\n\n===Fauna===\nThe great variety of plant life sustains a wide range of animals. Twenty two species of [[butterfly]] have been recorded. [[Hedgehog]]s benefit from the proximity of adjacent homes and occasional feedings from homeowners. [[Fox]]es are plentiful and [[muntjac]] (a small species of deer) are seen occasionally. A colony of [[slowworm]]s thrive along the grassy embankment. More than sixty species of bird have been seen along the walk and many breed here. Parkland Walk is known to be an important site for bats in the London context{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}, providing important foraging habitat and an excellent dark commuting route. A significant bat roost is known to exist in the vicinity.\n\n==Sculpture and urban legends==\n[[File:Spriggan sculpture by Marilyn Collins, Parkland Walk, Haringey.jpg|thumb|The spriggan sculpture]]\nAlong the walk just before the disused platforms at Crouch End, a man-sized green [[spriggan]] sculpture by [[Marilyn Collins]] has been placed in one of the alcoves of the wall at the footbridge before the former [[Crouch End]] station.\n\nAccording to a local urban legend, a ghostly 'goat-man' haunted the walk in the 1970s and 1980s. Local children playing out in the evenings would 'dare' each other to walk the Parkland Walk from the Crouch End Hill bridge to the Crouch Hill bridge in the darkness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harringayonline.com/forum/topics/goatman-of-parkland-walk-urban-myth-traced-to-harringay|title=Goatman of Parkland Walk Urban Myth Traced to Harringay|publisher=[[Harringay Online]]|date=25 March 2013}}</ref> It has been suggested that the sculpture, and the Parkland Walk generally, provided the inspiration for [[Stephen King]]'s short story \"[[Crouch End (short story)|Crouch End]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.londonguidedwalks.co.uk/blog/spriggan-in-crouch-end|title=Spriggan in Crouch End|last=Baker|first=Hazel|date=13 September 2014|website=London Blog|publisher=|access-date=7 July 2016}}</ref> However, as the story was first published in 1980 and the sculpture not erected until 1993, there can be no connection between the Spriggan and the story.<ref>http://www.harringayonline.com/forum/topics/the-mystery-of-the-parkland-walk-spriggan-solved</ref> It is possible that the Walk may have inspired King, as he stayed with friend and Crouch End resident Peter Straub during the 1970s. No definite link between the Parkland Walk and the story has ever been proven. <ref>http://www.northfour.co/stephen-kings-crouch-end/</ref>\n\n==  Crouch Hill Park project ==\nThe Islington section of the Parkland Walk formed a part of the Crouch Hill Park project, which provided improved accommodation for several institutions and reinstated an area of previously derelict parkland to the south of the Parkland Walk as a public park and nature reserve. The project included the demolition of the existing building of the [[Bowlers Community Nursery|Bowlers Nursery]] and the Crouch Hill Recreation Centre, and their replacement with new building containing the relocated [[Ashmount School]], a community primary school, and a new Bowlers Nursery. It also involved the rebuilding a blockhouse originally built to house switching gear for the never completed Northern Heights plan, and subsequently used to house a youth project. The whole project was executed at a total cost of \u00a313m to Islington Council.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe project was opposed by the [[Friends of the Parkland Walk]], the [[Ashmount Site Action Group]]  the [[Highgate Society]] and the [[20th Century Society]] all of whom favoured retention of the original school building on the original site off [[Hornsey Lane]]. It was also opposed by the Islington Green Party. The project was supported by both the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties, by the Ashmount School Governors,  by Ashmount  school parents and by Bowlers Nursery.  When the council carried out a consultation amongst residents, two thirds of the respondents were in favour of the scheme.  The project was also closely scrutinised by the Mayor of London whose consent was required as the land is specially protected [[Metropolitan Open Land]] and further examined by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government who could have chosen to call the project in and hold a public inquiry but despite requests to do so, did not. Objections to the project were made both to Islington, to the Mayor of London and the Secretary of State. An application for judicial review was threatened, but in the event did not materialise.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nFurther, a formal complaint against the council for proceeding with the project was made to the Local Government Ombudsman by the \"Ashmount Site Action Group\" (ASAG) but was not upheld. In the Council election of 2010 all three councillors elected for the local ward, in Islington, Hillrise, (two Liberal Democrat, one Labour) had publicly declared their support for the scheme. The project was financed by Islington Council under a  number of budget headings  recognising that the project was contributing to the re accommodation of several different bodies. It also received  a special grant due to its \"low Carbon\" status. In particular it was expected that a significant part of the cost of reproviding [[Ashmount School]] would be raised by realising the value of the old school site on [[Hornsey Lane]]. However, when Islington Council, relying on the recommendations of a Planning Inspector, applied to the Secretary of State for Education [[Michael Gove]] for permission to cease to use the old site for a school, permission was refused, and the site was requisitioned, without compensation to Islington Council, for use by a [[Free School]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nIn order to conform with the rules for building on [[Metropolitan Open Land]], the footprint of the new school building did not exceed that of the demolished buildings. The design  includes a [[brown roof]], climbing plants on walls, and areas of planted grassland, wild flowers and woodland. Bowlers Nursery moved into the new building in August 2012 and Ashmount School moved to the site in January 2013. Building operations at the Cape were finally completed in February 2013, two years and four months after the contract to carry out the work was signed by Islington Council. The Crouch Hill Project received a 2012 [[BREEAM]] award. Factors behind this award include the use of [[rain water harvesting]], natural ventilation systems to keep the school building cool in summer and the setting up of an \"energy centre\" in the blockhouse which by means of [[combined heat and power]] provides district heating both for the whole site and for social housing near the site, as well as generating electricity. The main fuel used is gas, but there is also provision for the use of [[biomass]] in the form of woodchips. The Architects were [[Penoyre & Prasad]] and the Contractors were [[Willmott Dixon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breeam.org/page.jsp?id=470|title=Crouch Hill Park, London, UK|publisher=[[BREEAM]]|accessdate=8 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416175117/http://www.breeam.org/page.jsp?id=470|archive-date=16 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ramboll.co.uk/news/viewnews?newsid=778A4677-A32C-4BB4-A021-6891269BFB4B|title=Crouch Hill Community Park, Islington, wins BREEAM Project of the Year|publisher=Ramboll UK Limited|accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Parkland Walk}}\n{{Portal|London}}\n* [https://www.parkland-walk.org.uk/ Friends of the Parkland Walk]\n* [http://www.urban75.org/london/alexandra.html Urban75 \u2014 Walking the Northern Heights]\n* [http://overground.eu.org/heights/ A collection of photos of the Northern Heights before it was decommissioned]\n* [http://www.londonskateparks.co.uk/skateparks/crouch-hill-park Crouch Hill Park Skatepark]\n* [https://www.skateparks.co.uk/london/crouch-hill-skatepark/ Crouch Hill Skatepark]\n\n{{LNRs in Greater London}}\n{{Long-distance footpaths in London}}\n{{coord|51.5742|-0.1245|type:landmark_dim:7000_region:GB|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Alexandra Palace]]\n[[Category:Cycleways in England]]\n[[Category:Footpaths in London]]\n[[Category:Local nature reserves in Greater London]]\n[[Category:Nature reserves in the London Borough of Haringey]]\n[[Category:Nature reserves in the London Borough of Islington]]\n[[Category:Parks and open spaces in the London Borough of Haringey]]\n[[Category:Parks and open spaces in the London Borough of Islington]]\n[[Category:Rail trails in England]]\n[[Category:Transport in the London Borough of Haringey]]\n[[Category:Transport in the London Borough of Islington]]\n[[Category:Muswell Hill]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Parkland Walk - 2007.jpg|thumb|Parkland Walk]]\n\nThe '''Parkland Walk''' is a {{convert|2.5|mi|adj=on}} linear green pedestrian and cycle route in [[London]], which follows the course of the [[railway line]] that used to run between [[Finsbury Park]] and [[Alexandra Palace]], through [[Stroud Green, London|Stroud Green]], [[Crouch End]], [[Highgate]] and [[Muswell Hill]].

There is a public cafe in the building to which there is direct access from the Parkland Walk.\n\nPassing the blockhouse, the walk enters Crouch Hill Park, which spreads to the south of the old railway line. The new park has a triangular form covering an area of {{convert|25730|m2}}, which is bounded by the walkway to the north and housing on the other sides, and is home to birds, invertebrates and bats, including some species locally uncommon or declining. It can be accessed from a number of access points on the Parkland Walk, from a public footpath called the Vicarage Path and from pedestrian entrances to the South and West of the park. A new building within the park contains [[Ashmount School]], a community primary school, and [[Bowlers Community Nursery]], a separate charity-run voluntary nursery.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://bowlersnursery.org | title =Bowlers Community Nursery | publisher = Bowlers Community Nursery | accessdate = 8 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nBeyond the site of the new school building, and just before Crouch End Station is a footbridge across the Parkland Walk dating back to the original railway, (so originally a crossing over  the railway) which was retained and now connects Hazelemere Road, in Haringey, to the Crouch Hill Park in Islington.\n\nAt this point the still intact but partly overgrown platforms of [[Crouch End railway station|Crouch End Station]] remain at the end of which the route passes under the site of the former station building and the road bridge over the cutting carrying [[Crouch End Hill]].\n\n===Crouch End Hill to Highgate tunnels===\n[[File:Parkland Walk.JPG|thumb|Parkland Walk]]\nBeyond this the cutting opens out on the northern side as the route skirts a hill, parallel to Hornsey Lane where some apartment blocks have been built. The route bridges Stanhope Road on a footbridge replacing the original structure. The route continues on an embankment to a brick-built bridge over Northwood Road, beneath which traffic can flow in only one direction at a time. The surrounding ground rises rapidly and the route becomes a cutting at the end of which the portals of the southern pair of Highgate tunnels come into view. Vestiges of line-side electrical equipment for the planned 1930s electrification of the line and part of the structure of the old Highgate station are visible through the tunnels. The tunnels are closed to pedestrian access. Consequently, the main route ends here with an exit onto Holmesdale Road. Should the walker choose to proceed further they can travel uphill along Holmesdale Road which soon joins [[Archway Road]]. Continuing along Archway Road, travelling north past [[Highgate station]], leads to the junction between Archway Road and [[Muswell Hill Road]].\n\n===Cranley Gardens to Alexandra Palace===\nThe route between the northern end of the Highgate Tunnels to the Northern line depot at [[Wellington Junction]] is used by trains entering the depot, while the rest of the cutting round [[Highgate Wood]] from Wellington Junction to [[Cranley Gardens railway station|Cranley Gardens]] is outside the wood\u2019s fence, not officially part of Parkland Walk, and so is allowed to stay overgrown.\n\nA further shorter section of the walk begins along Muswell Hill Road, just beyond Cranley Gardens, where the road overbridge crosses the old line. The site of the former [[Cranley Gardens railway station|Cranley Gardens station]] and the old trackbed has been replaced with housing. The walk continues opposite via steps down to the trackbed towards Alexandra Palace, which skirts a hill. The span of the seventeen-arch viaduct over St James's Lane gives a view eastwards and southwards over London. The route ends with a reconstructed overbridge under Muswell Hill itself. At this point Muswell Hill primary school has been built on the trackbed. The pedestrian route bypasses the primary school and leads into Alexandra Palace Park proper.  Further remains of the rail route can be seen in [[Alexandra Park, London|Alexandra Park]]. The [[Alexandra Palace railway station (Muswell Hill branch)|Alexandra Palace station building]] still exists and is used for community purposes.<ref>http://www.cufos.org.uk/</ref>\n\n[[File:Parkland Walk Islington.jpg|thumb|Parkland Walk in [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] with the Crouch Hill bridge]]\n\n==Wildlife==\n\n===Flora===\n\nNo trees were permitted to grow close to the track when the railway was operational. The range of trees found today has grown up in the last fifty years. Most arrived naturally ([[oak]], [[Ash tree|ash]], [[birch]], [[Crataegus|hawthorn]], [[cherry]], [[apple tree|apple]], [[holly]], [[rowan]], [[Sycamore Maple|sycamore]] and [[taxus|yew]]), but a few additional species have been planted ([[field maple]], [[hazel]], [[black poplar|black Italian poplar]] and [[Populus alba|white poplar]]).\n\nMore than three hundred species of wild flowers have been recorded on the Parkland Walk. They range from commonplace to exotic. Species sighted include [[Michaelmas daisy|Michaelmas daisies]], [[golden rod]]s, [[buddleia]] and [[Guernsey Fleabane|Guernsey fleabane]].\n\n===Fauna===\nThe great variety of plant life sustains a wide range of animals. Twenty two species of [[butterfly]] have been recorded. [[Hedgehog]]s benefit from the proximity of adjacent homes and occasional feedings from homeowners. [[Fox]]es are plentiful and [[muntjac]] (a small species of deer) are seen occasionally. A colony of [[slowworm]]s thrive along the grassy embankment. More than sixty species of bird have been seen along the walk and many breed here. Parkland Walk is known to be an important site for bats in the London context{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}, providing important foraging habitat and an excellent dark commuting route. A significant bat roost is known to exist in the vicinity.\n\n==Sculpture and urban legends==\n[[File:Spriggan sculpture by Marilyn Collins, Parkland Walk, Haringey.jpg|thumb|The spriggan sculpture]]\nAlong the walk just before the disused platforms at Crouch End, a man-sized green [[spriggan]] sculpture by [[Marilyn Collins]] has been placed in one of the alcoves of the wall at the footbridge before the former [[Crouch End]] station.\n\nAccording to a local urban legend, a ghostly 'goat-man' haunted the walk in the 1970s and 1980s. Local children playing out in the evenings would 'dare' each other to walk the Parkland Walk from the Crouch End Hill bridge to the Crouch Hill bridge in the darkness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harringayonline.com/forum/topics/goatman-of-parkland-walk-urban-myth-traced-to-harringay|title=Goatman of Parkland Walk Urban Myth Traced to Harringay|publisher=[[Harringay Online]]|date=25 March 2013}}</ref> It has been suggested that the sculpture, and the Parkland Walk generally, provided the inspiration for [[Stephen King]]'s short story \"[[Crouch End (short story)|Crouch End]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.londonguidedwalks.co.uk/blog/spriggan-in-crouch-end|title=Spriggan in Crouch End|last=Baker|first=Hazel|date=13 September 2014|website=London Blog|publisher=|access-date=7 July 2016}}</ref> However, as the story was first published in 1980 and the sculpture not erected until 1993, there can be no connection between the Spriggan and the story.<ref>http://www.harringayonline.com/forum/topics/the-mystery-of-the-parkland-walk-spriggan-solved</ref> It is possible that the Walk may have inspired King, as he stayed with friend and Crouch End resident Peter Straub during the 1970s. No definite link between the Parkland Walk and the story has ever been proven. <ref>http://www.northfour.co/stephen-kings-crouch-end/</ref>\n\n==  Crouch Hill Park project ==\nThe Islington section of the Parkland Walk formed a part of the Crouch Hill Park project, which provided improved accommodation for several institutions and reinstated an area of previously derelict parkland to the south of the Parkland Walk as a public park and nature reserve. The project included the demolition of the existing building of the [[Bowlers Community Nursery|Bowlers Nursery]] and the Crouch Hill Recreation Centre, and their replacement with new building containing the relocated [[Ashmount School]], a community primary school, and a new Bowlers Nursery. It also involved the rebuilding a blockhouse originally built to house switching gear for the never completed Northern Heights plan, and subsequently used to house a youth project. The whole project was executed at a total cost of \u00a313m to Islington Council.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe project was opposed by the [[Friends of the Parkland Walk]], the [[Ashmount Site Action Group]]  the [[Highgate Society]] and the [[20th Century Society]] all of whom favoured retention of the original school building on the original site off [[Hornsey Lane]]. It was also opposed by the Islington Green Party. The project was supported by both the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties, by the Ashmount School Governors,  by Ashmount  school parents and by Bowlers Nursery.  When the council carried out a consultation amongst residents, two thirds of the respondents were in favour of the scheme.  The project was also closely scrutinised by the Mayor of London whose consent was required as the land is specially protected [[Metropolitan Open Land]] and further examined by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government who could have chosen to call the project in and hold a public inquiry but despite requests to do so, did not. Objections to the project were made both to Islington, to the Mayor of London and the Secretary of State. An application for judicial review was threatened, but in the event did not materialise.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nFurther, a formal complaint against the council for proceeding with the project was made to the Local Government Ombudsman by the \"Ashmount Site Action Group\" (ASAG) but was not upheld. In the Council election of 2010 all three councillors elected for the local ward, in Islington, Hillrise, (two Liberal Democrat, one Labour) had publicly declared their support for the scheme. The project was financed by Islington Council under a  number of budget headings  recognising that the project was contributing to the re accommodation of several different bodies. It also received  a special grant due to its \"low Carbon\" status. In particular it was expected that a significant part of the cost of reproviding [[Ashmount School]] would be raised by realising the value of the old school site on [[Hornsey Lane]]. However, when Islington Council, relying on the recommendations of a Planning Inspector, applied to the Secretary of State for Education [[Michael Gove]] for permission to cease to use the old site for a school, permission was refused, and the site was requisitioned, without compensation to Islington Council, for use by a [[Free School]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nIn order to conform with the rules for building on [[Metropolitan Open Land]], the footprint of the new school building did not exceed that of the demolished buildings. The design  includes a [[brown roof]], climbing plants on walls, and areas of planted grassland, wild flowers and woodland. Bowlers Nursery moved into the new building in August 2012 and Ashmount School moved to the site in January 2013. Building operations at the Cape were finally completed in February 2013, two years and four months after the contract to carry out the work was signed by Islington Council. The Crouch Hill Project received a 2012 [[BREEAM]] award. Factors behind this award include the use of [[rain water harvesting]], natural ventilation systems to keep the school building cool in summer and the setting up of an \"energy centre\" in the blockhouse which by means of [[combined heat and power]] provides district heating both for the whole site and for social housing near the site, as well as generating electricity. The main fuel used is gas, but there is also provision for the use of [[biomass]] in the form of woodchips. The Architects were [[Penoyre & Prasad]] and the Contractors were [[Willmott Dixon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breeam.org/page.jsp?id=470|title=Crouch Hill Park, London, UK|publisher=[[BREEAM]]|accessdate=8 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416175117/http://www.breeam.org/page.jsp?id=470|archive-date=16 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ramboll.co.uk/news/viewnews?newsid=778A4677-A32C-4BB4-A021-6891269BFB4B|title=Crouch Hill Community Park, Islington, wins BREEAM Project of the Year|publisher=Ramboll UK Limited|accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Parkland Walk}}\n{{Portal|London}}\n* [https://www.parkland-walk.org.uk/ Friends of the Parkland Walk]\n* [http://www.urban75.org/london/alexandra.html Urban75 \u2014 Walking the Northern Heights]\n* [http://overground.eu.org/heights/ A collection of photos of the Northern Heights before it was decommissioned]\n* [http://www.londonskateparks.co.uk/skateparks/crouch-hill-park Crouch Hill Park Skatepark]\n* [https://www.skateparks.co.uk/london/crouch-hill-skatepark/ Crouch Hill Skatepark]\n\n{{LNRs in Greater London}}\n{{Long-distance footpaths in London}}\n{{coord|51.5742|-0.1245|type:landmark_dim:7000_region:GB|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Alexandra Palace]]\n[[Category:Cycleways in England]]\n[[Category:Footpaths in London]]\n[[Category:Local nature reserves in Greater London]]\n[[Category:Nature reserves in the London Borough of Haringey]]\n[[Category:Nature reserves in the London Borough of Islington]]\n[[Category:Parks and open spaces in the London Borough of Haringey]]\n[[Category:Parks and open spaces in the London Borough of Islington]]\n[[Category:Rail trails in England]]\n[[Category:Transport in the London Borough of Haringey]]\n[[Category:Transport in the London Borough of Islington]]\n[[Category:Muswell Hill]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCranley Gardens to Alexandra Palace:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkland_Walk"}

Crewdson and his followers believed that too much emphasis was placed by Quakers on the Inner Light, at the expense of Biblical authority.\n\nIn his book Crewdson criticized the American Quaker, [[Elias Hicks]] (1748\u20131830), who considered \"obedience to the light within\" to be the most important principle of worship and who regarded the Bible as a \"dead letter\" unless read \"under the regulating influence of the spirit of God\".<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.qhpress.org/quakerpages/qhoa/hicksdarby.htm |title=The Blood of Jesus A Sermon and Prayer Delivered by ELIAS HICKS, at Darby Meeting, Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, November 15, 1826 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref> Hicks had been responsible for the first schism in Quakerism in 1827.\n\nInitially, Hardshaw East Monthly Meeting was thrown into disorder by the controversy. The matter was discussed at the 1835 [[Britain Yearly Meeting|London Yearly Meeting]] and a Visiting Committee was appointed to investigate and seek the reconciliation of members there. The Committee, which included Crewdson's close friend, [[Joseph John Gurney]], the leading English Quaker evangelical of his time, was inclined to be sympathetic to Crewdson.<ref name=\"kennedy\" /> Even so, the correspondence that took place between Crewdson and the Committee in 1835 was published by them without his knowledge and consent in ''A Few Particulars of the Correspondence Between the Committee Appointed by the Friends' Yearly Meeting, and Isaac Crewdson''.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YdktAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA2 |title=A Few Particulars of the Correspondence Between the Committee Appointed by the Friends' Yearly Meeting, and Isaac Crewdson |page=2 |author=Society of Friends |publisher=Hamilton, Adams, & Company |year=1835 |accessdate=2013-04-08}}</ref> Eventually, the Committee brought matters to a head by asking Crewdson to withdraw his book from circulation, but he refused to do so.

Crewdson and his followers believed that too much emphasis was placed by Quakers on the Inner Light, at the expense of Biblical authority.\n\nIn his book Crewdson criticized the American Quaker, [[Elias Hicks]] (1748\u20131830), who considered \"obedience to the light within\" to be the most important principle of worship and who regarded the Bible as a \"dead letter\" unless read \"under the regulating influence of the spirit of God\".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.qhpress.org/quakerpages/qhoa/hicksdarby.htm |title=The Blood of Jesus A Sermon and Prayer Delivered by ELIAS HICKS, at Darby Meeting, Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, November 15, 1826 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref> Hicks had been responsible for the first schism in Quakerism in 1827.\n\nInitially, Hardshaw East Monthly Meeting was thrown into disorder by the controversy.

An essential component of a provider's ability to provide individualized palliative care is their ability to obtain an intimate understanding of the child and family's preferences and overall character. On initial consultation, palliative care providers often focus on affirming a caring relationship with the pediatric patient and their family by first asking the child how they would describe themself and what is important to them, communicating in an age and developmentally cognizant fashion. The provider may then gather similar information from the child's caregivers. Questions practitioners may ask include 'What does the child enjoy doing? What do they most dislike doing? What does a typical day look like for the child?' Other topics potentially addressed by the palliative care provider may also include familial rituals as well as spiritual and religious beliefs, life goals for the child, and the meaning of illness within the broader context of the child and their family's life.<ref name=\":6\" />\n* '''Developing a shared understanding of the child's condition with the patient and their family.''' The establishment of shared knowledge between medical providers, patients, and families is essential when determining palliative goals of care for pediatric patients. Initially, practitioners often elicit information from the patient ''and'' child to ascertain these parties' baseline understanding of the child's situation.<ref name=\":7\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Garwick AW, Patterson J, Bennett FC, Blum RW | title = Breaking the news.

Through this process, families can pursue informed, shared medical decision making regarding their child's care. A framework often employed by pediatric palliative care providers is 'ask, tell, ask' where the provider asks the patient and their family for a question to identify their level of comprehension of the situation, and then subsequently supplements the family's knowledge with additional expert knowledge.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\"baile\" /> This information is often conveyed without jargon or euphemism to maintain trust and ensure understanding. Providers iteratively check for comprehension of this knowledge supplementation by asking questions related to previous explanations, as information retention can be challenging when undergoing a stressful experience.<ref name=\":7\" />\n* '''Establishing meaning and dignity regarding the child's illness.''' As part of developing a shared understanding of a child's illness and character, palliative providers will assess both the child and their family's symbolic and emotional relationship to disease. As both the somatic and psychologic implications of illness can be distressing to children, palliative care practitioners look for opportunities to establish meaning and dignity regarding the child's illness by contextualizing disease within a broader framework of the child's life.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Dignity therapy : final words for final days |last=Chochinov | first = Harvey Max | name-list-format = vanc |date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517621-6|location=Oxford|oclc=714030350}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|title=The nature of suffering and the goals of medicine |last=Cassell | first = Eric J. | name-list-format = vanc | date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=1-60256-743-3|edition=2nd|location=New York|oclc=173843216}}</ref> Derived from the fields of [[Harvey Chochinov|dignity therapy]] and [[William Breitbart|meaning-centered psychotherapy]], the palliative care provider may explore the following questions with the sick child and their family:\n** What gives your life meaning, worth, or purpose?\n** Where do you find strength and support?\n** What inspires you?\n** How do you like to be thought of?\n** What are you most proud of?\n** What are the particular things you would like your family to know or remember about you?\n** When was the last time you laughed really hard?\n** Are you frightened by all of this?

Do you ever think about why this happened to you?<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n* '''Assessing preferences for decision making.''' Medical decision making in a pediatric setting is unique in that it is often the child's legal guardians, not the patient, who ultimately consent for most medical treatments. Yet within a palliative care setting, it is particularly consequential to incorporate the child's preferences within the ultimate goals of care. Equally important to consider, families may vary in the level of responsibility they want in this decision making process.<ref name=\":11\" /> Their preference may range from wanting to be the child's sole decision makers, to partnering with the medical team in a shared decision making model, to advocating for full deferral of decision-making responsibility to the clinician.<ref name=\":11\" /> Palliative care providers clarify a family's preferences and support needs for medical decision making by providing context, information, and options for treatment and medical palliation.\n* '''Optimizing the environment for effective conversations around prognosis and goals of care.''' Essential to facilitating supportive, clear communication around potentially distressing topics such as prognosis and goals of care for seriously ill pediatric patients is optimizing the setting where this communication will take place and developing informed consensus among the child's caregiving team regarding goals and options for care. Often, these conversations occur within the context of family meetings, which are formal meetings between families and the child's multidisciplinary medical team. Prior to the family meeting, providers often meet to discuss the child's overall case, reasonably expected prognosis, and options for care, in addition to clarifying specific roles each provider will take on during the family meeting. During this meeting, the multidisciplinary medical team may also discuss any legal or ethical considerations related to the case. Palliative care providers often facilitate this meeting and help synthesize its outcome for children and their families. Experts in optimized communication, palliative care providers may opt to hold the family meeting in a quiet space where the providers and family can sit and address concerns during a time when all parties are not constrained. Additionally, parents' preferences regarding information exchange with the sick child present should be clarified.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mack JW, Grier HE | title = The Day One Talk | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 563\u20136 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14752081 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2004.04.078 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mack JW, Hilden JM, Watterson J, Moore C, Turner B, Grier HE, Weeks JC, Wolfe J | display-authors = 6 | title = Parent and physician perspectives on quality of care at the end of life in children with cancer | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 23 | issue = 36 | pages = 9155\u201361 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16172457 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2005.04.010 }}</ref> If the child's guardians are resistant to disclosing information in front of their child, the child's provider may explore parental concerns on the topic.

A significant role of the pediatric palliative care provider is to help support children, their families, and their caregiving teams through the emotional stress of illness. Communication strategies the palliative care provider may employ in this role are asking for permission when engaging with potentially distressing conversations, naming emotions witnessed to create opportunities to discuss complex emotional responses to illness, actively listening, and allowing for invitational silence.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Back AL, Bauer-Wu SM, Rushton CH, Halifax J | title = Compassionate silence in the patient-clinician encounter: a contemplative approach | journal = Journal of Palliative Medicine | volume = 12 | issue = 12 | pages = 1113\u20137 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19698026 | pmc = 2939848 | doi = 10.1089/jpm.2009.0175 }}</ref> The palliative care provider may iteratively assess the child and family's emotional responses and needs during challenging conversations.

In [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and many other countries all palliative care is offered free, either through the [[National Health Service]] or through charities working in partnership with the local health services. Palliative care services in the United States are paid by philanthropy, fee-for service mechanisms, or from direct hospital support while hospice care is provided as a Medicare benefit; similar hospice benefits are offered by Medicaid and most private health insurers. Under the Medicare Hospice Benefit (MHB), a person signs off their Medicare Part B (acute hospital payment) and enrolls in the MHB through Medicare Part B with direct care provided by a Medicare certified hospice agency. Under terms of the MHB, the hospice agency is responsible for the care plan and may not bill the person for services. The hospice agency, together with the person's primary physician, is responsible for determining the care plan. All costs related to the terminal illness are paid from a per diem rate (~US $126/day) that the hospice agency receives from Medicare \u2013 this includes all drugs and equipment, nursing, social service, chaplain visits, and other services deemed appropriate by the hospice agency; Medicare does not pay for custodial care. People may elect to withdraw from the MHB and return to Medicare Part A and later re-enroll in hospice.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Certification and training for services===\nIn most countries, hospice care and palliative care is provided by an interdisciplinary team consisting of [[physician]]s, [[clinical pharmacy|pharmacists]], [[registered nurses|nurses]], [[nursing assistants]], [[social worker]]s, [[hospice chaplain|chaplain]]s, and caregivers.

Additionally, pediatric palliative care practitioners must assess both the sick child and their family's understanding of complex illness and options for care, and provide accessible, thoughtful education to address knowledge gaps and allow for informed decision making. Finally, practitioners are supporting children and families in the queries, emotional distress, and decision making that ensues from the child's illness.\n\nMany frameworks for communication have been established within the medical literature, but the field of pediatric palliative care is still in relative infancy. Communication considerations and strategies employed in a palliative setting include:\n\n* '''Developing supportive relationships with patients and families.''' An essential component of a provider's ability to provide individualized palliative care is their ability to obtain an intimate understanding of the child and family's preferences and overall character. On initial consultation, palliative care providers often focus on affirming a caring relationship with the pediatric patient and their family by first asking the child how they would describe themself and what is important to them, communicating in an age and developmentally cognizant fashion. The provider may then gather similar information from the child's caregivers. Questions practitioners may ask include 'What does the child enjoy doing? What do they most dislike doing? What does a typical day look like for the child?' Other topics potentially addressed by the palliative care provider may also include familial rituals as well as spiritual and religious beliefs, life goals for the child, and the meaning of illness within the broader context of the child and their family's life.<ref name=\":6\" />\n* '''Developing a shared understanding of the child's condition with the patient and their family.''' The establishment of shared knowledge between medical providers, patients, and families is essential when determining palliative goals of care for pediatric patients. Initially, practitioners often elicit information from the patient ''and'' child to ascertain these parties' baseline understanding of the child's situation.<ref name=\":7\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Garwick AW, Patterson J, Bennett FC, Blum RW | title = Breaking the news.

Through this process, families can pursue informed, shared medical decision making regarding their child's care. A framework often employed by pediatric palliative care providers is 'ask, tell, ask' where the provider asks the patient and their family for a question to identify their level of comprehension of the situation, and then subsequently supplements the family's knowledge with additional expert knowledge.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\"baile\" /> This information is often conveyed without jargon or euphemism to maintain trust and ensure understanding. Providers iteratively check for comprehension of this knowledge supplementation by asking questions related to previous explanations, as information retention can be challenging when undergoing a stressful experience.<ref name=\":7\" />\n* '''Establishing meaning and dignity regarding the child's illness.''' As part of developing a shared understanding of a child's illness and character, palliative providers will assess both the child and their family's symbolic and emotional relationship to disease. As both the somatic and psychologic implications of illness can be distressing to children, palliative care practitioners look for opportunities to establish meaning and dignity regarding the child's illness by contextualizing disease within a broader framework of the child's life.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Dignity therapy : final words for final days |last=Chochinov | first = Harvey Max | name-list-format = vanc |date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517621-6|location=Oxford|oclc=714030350}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|title=The nature of suffering and the goals of medicine |last=Cassell | first = Eric J. | name-list-format = vanc | date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=1-60256-743-3|edition=2nd|location=New York|oclc=173843216}}</ref> Derived from the fields of [[Harvey Chochinov|dignity therapy]] and [[William Breitbart|meaning-centered psychotherapy]], the palliative care provider may explore the following questions with the sick child and their family:\n** What gives your life meaning, worth, or purpose?\n** Where do you find strength and support?\n** What inspires you?\n** How do you like to be thought of?\n** What are you most proud of?\n** What are the particular things you would like your family to know or remember about you?\n** When was the last time you laughed really hard?\n** Are you frightened by all of this?

Do you ever think about why this happened to you?<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n* '''Assessing preferences for decision making.''' Medical decision making in a pediatric setting is unique in that it is often the child's legal guardians, not the patient, who ultimately consent for most medical treatments. Yet within a palliative care setting, it is particularly consequential to incorporate the child's preferences within the ultimate goals of care. Equally important to consider, families may vary in the level of responsibility they want in this decision making process.<ref name=\":11\" /> Their preference may range from wanting to be the child's sole decision makers, to partnering with the medical team in a shared decision making model, to advocating for full deferral of decision-making responsibility to the clinician.<ref name=\":11\" /> Palliative care providers clarify a family's preferences and support needs for medical decision making by providing context, information, and options for treatment and medical palliation.\n* '''Optimizing the environment for effective conversations around prognosis and goals of care.''' Essential to facilitating supportive, clear communication around potentially distressing topics such as prognosis and goals of care for seriously ill pediatric patients is optimizing the setting where this communication will take place and developing informed consensus among the child's caregiving team regarding goals and options for care. Often, these conversations occur within the context of family meetings, which are formal meetings between families and the child's multidisciplinary medical team. Prior to the family meeting, providers often meet to discuss the child's overall case, reasonably expected prognosis, and options for care, in addition to clarifying specific roles each provider will take on during the family meeting. During this meeting, the multidisciplinary medical team may also discuss any legal or ethical considerations related to the case. Palliative care providers often facilitate this meeting and help synthesize its outcome for children and their families. Experts in optimized communication, palliative care providers may opt to hold the family meeting in a quiet space where the providers and family can sit and address concerns during a time when all parties are not constrained. Additionally, parents' preferences regarding information exchange with the sick child present should be clarified.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mack JW, Grier HE | title = The Day One Talk | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 563\u20136 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14752081 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2004.04.078 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mack JW, Hilden JM, Watterson J, Moore C, Turner B, Grier HE, Weeks JC, Wolfe J | display-authors = 6 | title = Parent and physician perspectives on quality of care at the end of life in children with cancer | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 23 | issue = 36 | pages = 9155\u201361 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16172457 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2005.04.010 }}</ref> If the child's guardians are resistant to disclosing information in front of their child, the child's provider may explore parental concerns on the topic.

A significant role of the pediatric palliative care provider is to help support children, their families, and their caregiving teams through the emotional stress of illness. Communication strategies the palliative care provider may employ in this role are asking for permission when engaging with potentially distressing conversations, naming emotions witnessed to create opportunities to discuss complex emotional responses to illness, actively listening, and allowing for invitational silence.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Back AL, Bauer-Wu SM, Rushton CH, Halifax J | title = Compassionate silence in the patient-clinician encounter: a contemplative approach | journal = Journal of Palliative Medicine | volume = 12 | issue = 12 | pages = 1113\u20137 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19698026 | pmc = 2939848 | doi = 10.1089/jpm.2009.0175 }}</ref> The palliative care provider may iteratively assess the child and family's emotional responses and needs during challenging conversations.

In [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and many other countries all palliative care is offered free, either through the [[National Health Service]] or through charities working in partnership with the local health services. Palliative care services in the United States are paid by philanthropy, fee-for service mechanisms, or from direct hospital support while hospice care is provided as a Medicare benefit; similar hospice benefits are offered by Medicaid and most private health insurers. Under the Medicare Hospice Benefit (MHB), a person signs off their Medicare Part B (acute hospital payment) and enrolls in the MHB through Medicare Part B with direct care provided by a Medicare certified hospice agency. Under terms of the MHB, the hospice agency is responsible for the care plan and may not bill the person for services. The hospice agency, together with the person's primary physician, is responsible for determining the care plan. All costs related to the terminal illness are paid from a per diem rate (~US $126/day) that the hospice agency receives from Medicare \u2013 this includes all drugs and equipment, nursing, social service, chaplain visits, and other services deemed appropriate by the hospice agency; Medicare does not pay for custodial care. People may elect to withdraw from the MHB and return to Medicare Part A and later re-enroll in hospice.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Certification and training for services===\nIn most countries, hospice care and palliative care is provided by an interdisciplinary team consisting of [[physician]]s, [[clinical pharmacy|pharmacists]], [[registered nurses|nurses]], [[nursing assistants]], [[social worker]]s, [[hospice chaplain|chaplain]]s, and caregivers.

In 2015 the UK's palliative care was ranked as the best in the world \"due to comprehensive national policies, the extensive integration of palliative care into the ''[[National Health Service]]'', a strong hospice movement, and deep community engagement on the issue.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Quality of Death Index 2015: Ranking palliative care across the world|url=http://www.economistinsights.com/healthcare/analysis/quality-death-index-2015|access-date=8 October 2015|work=The Economist Intelligence Unit|date=6 October 2015|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=UK end-of-life care 'best in world'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34415362|access-date=8 October 2015|work=BBC|date=6 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Acceptance===\nThe focus on a person's quality of life has increased greatly since the 1990s.

According to the 2016 Census, 53,504 people live in the city, with a wider metropolitan population of 82,963.\n\nToday, Waterford is known for [[Waterford Crystal]], a legacy of the city's former glassmaking industry. Glass, or crystal, was manufactured in the city from 1783 until early 2009, when the factory there was shut down after the receivership of Waterford Wedgwood plc. The Waterford Crystal visitor centre in the Viking Quarter, under new owners, opened in June 2010, after the intervention of Waterford City Council and Waterford Chamber of Commerce, and resumed production. Waterford is also known for being the starting point of [[Ryanair]]'s first flight, a 14-seat [[Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante|Embraer Bandeirante]] [[turboprop]] aircraft flying between Waterford and [[Gatwick Airport]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Waterford}}\n[[File:Waterford city at night - geograph.org.uk - 1034017.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Waterford Quay at night]]\n\nThe name 'Waterford' comes {{etymology|non|Ve\u00f0rafj\u01ebr\u00f0r|[[Sheep|ram]] (wether) [[fjord]]}}. The Irish name is ''Port L\u00e1irge'', meaning \"L\u00e1rag's port\".<ref name=McEneaney>''Discover Waterford'', by Eamon McEneaney (2001). ({{ISBN|0-86278-656-8}})</ref>\n\n[[Viking]] raiders first established a settlement near Waterford in 853. It and all the other [[longphort]]s were vacated in 902, the Vikings having been driven out by the native Irish. The Vikings re-established themselves in Ireland at Waterford in 914, led at first by [[Ottir Iarla]] (Jarl Ottar) until 917, and after that by [[Ragnall ua \u00cdmair]] and the [[U\u00ed \u00cdmair]] dynasty, and built what would be Ireland's first city. Among the most prominent [[rulers of Waterford]] was [[Ivar of Waterford]].\n\nIn 1167, [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], the deposed [[Kings of Leinster|King of Leinster]], failed in an attempt to take Waterford. He returned in 1170 with [[Cambro-Norman]] mercenaries under [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]] (known as Strongbow); together they besieged and took the city after a desperate defence. In furtherance of the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]], King [[Henry II of England]] landed at Waterford in 1171. Waterford and then [[Dublin]] were declared royal cities, with Dublin also declared capital of Ireland.\n\nThroughout the medieval period, Waterford was Ireland's second city after Dublin. In the 15th century Waterford repelled two pretenders to the English throne: [[Lambert Simnel]] and [[Perkin Warbeck]]. As a result, King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] gave the city its motto: ''Urbs Intacta Manet Waterfordia (Waterford remains the untaken city)''.\n\nAfter the Protestant Reformation, Waterford remained a [[Catholic]] city and participated in the [[Confederate Ireland|confederation of Kilkenny]] \u2013 an independent Catholic government from 1642 to 1649. This was ended abruptly by [[Oliver Cromwell]], who [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|brought the country back under English rule]]; his son-in-law [[Henry Ireton]] finally took Waterford in 1650 after a [[Siege of Waterford|major siege]].<ref name=\"NewHistory\" /> \nIn 1690, during the [[Williamite War]], the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Irish Army]] was [[Capture of Waterford|forced to surrender Waterford]] in the wake of the [[Battle of the Boyne]].\n\nThe 18th century was a period of huge prosperity for Waterford. Most of the city's best architecture appeared during this time. A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of the [[Waterford Barracks|Cavalry Barracks]] at the end of the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waterfordvikingtriangle.com/assets/A3-Heritage-walk-map.pdf|title=Heritage Walk map|accessdate=7 December 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208180034/http://waterfordvikingtriangle.com/assets/A3-Heritage-walk-map.pdf|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 19th century, Waterford City was deemed vulnerable and the British government erected three [[Martello tower]]s on the Hook Peninsula to reinforce the existing Fort at [[Duncannon]]. During the 19th century, great industries such as glass making and ship building thrived in the city.\n\nThe city was represented in the [[Palace of Westminster|Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] from 1891 to 1918 by [[John Redmond]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]], leader (from January 1900) of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. Redmond, then leader of the [[Charles Stuart Parnell|pro-Parnell]] faction of the party, defeated [[David Sheehy]] in 1891. In 1911, Br. Jerome Foley, Br. Dunstan Drumm and Br. Leopold Loughran left Waterford for [[Malvern, Victoria|Malvern, Australia]]. Here, they founded [[De La Salle College Malvern|a Catholic college]] which is still in existence today.<ref>Steve Stefanopolous, ''St. Joseph's Malvern'', 2003. Held by the De La Salle College Malvern Archives</ref> In July 1922, Waterford was the scene of fighting between [[Irish Free State]] and [[Irish Republican]] troops during the [[Irish Civil War]].\n\n===References in Annals of Inisfallen===\nSee [[Annals of Inisfallen]] (AI)\n* ''AI926.2 The fleet of Port L\u00e1irge [came] over land, and they settled on [[Lough Gur|Loch Gair]].''\n* ''AI927.2 A slaughter of the foreigners of Port L\u00e1irge [was inflicted] at Cell Mo-Chell\u00f3c by the men of [[Munster|Mumu]] and by the foreigners of [[Limerick|Luimnech]].''\n* ''AI984.2 A great naval expedition(?) by the sons of [[Ivar of Limerick|Aralt]] to Port L\u00e1irge, and they and the [[Brian Boru|son of Cenn\u00e9tig]] exchanged hostages there as a guarantee of both together providing a hosting to attack [[Dublin|\u00c1th Cliath]].

The authority came into operation on 1 June 2014. Prior to this the city had its own local council, [[Waterford City Council]]. The new Council is the result of a merger of Waterford City Council and [[Waterford County Council]]. The Council has 32 representatives (councillors) who are elected from five electoral areas. The city itself forms three of the electoral areas \u2013 which when combined form the Metropolitan District of Waterford \u2013 and returns a total of 18 councillors to Waterford City and County Council. Residents in these areas are restricted to voting for candidates located in their ward for [[local elections]]. The office of the [[List of rulers of Waterford|Mayor of Waterford]] was established in 1377. A mayor is then elected by the councillors from the two electoral areas of the Metropolitan District of Waterford every year, and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual may serve. Mary O'Halloran who was mayor during 2007\u20132008 was the first woman to hold the post. The current mayor is Adam Wyse.\n\nFor the purposes of [[Elections in the Republic of Ireland|elections]] to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the city is part of the [[Waterford (D\u00e1il constituency)|Waterford constituency]], which includes the county of Waterford except for those parts of the county near [[Clonmel]] that lie in [[Tipperary South (D\u00e1il constituency)|Tipperary South]].<ref name=\"ea-2009\">{{cite web |title=Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009: Schedule |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0004/sched.html |work=[[Irish Statute Book|Irish Statute Book database]] |accessdate=29 September 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125044921/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0004/sched.html |archivedate=25 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The constituency elects four deputies to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.

To this day, it remains Waterford's most recognisable landmark. It is believed to be the first building in Ireland to use mortar. The [[River Suir]], which flows through Waterford City, has provided a basis for the city's long maritime history. The place downriver from Waterford where the [[River Nore|Nore]] and the [[River Barrow|Barrow]] join the [[River Suir]] is known in Irish as ''Cumar na dTr\u00ed Uisce'' (\"The confluence of the three waters\"). Waterford Port has been one of Ireland's major ports for over a millennium. In the 19th century, shipbuilding was a major industry. The owners of the Neptune Shipyard, the [[Malcomson family]], built and operated the largest fleet of iron steamers in the world between the mid-1850s and the late 1860s, including five trans-Atlantic passenger liners.<ref name=McEneaney />\n\nToday, Waterford is known for [[Waterford Crystal]], a legacy of the city's former glass making industry. Glass, or crystal, was manufactured in the city from 1783 until early 2009, when the factory there was shut down after the receivership of Waterford Wedgwood plc.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/world/2009-01-30-waterford-sit-in_N.htm|title=Waterford Crystal closed amid crippling debts|website=Usatoday.com|accessdate=1 October 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623165903/http://www.usatoday.com/money/world/2009-01-30-waterford-sit-in_N.htm|archivedate=23 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Waterford Crystal visitor centre in the Viking Quarter, under new owners, opened in June 2010, after the intervention of Waterford City Council and Waterford Chamber of Commerce, and resumed production.<ref>{{cite news|title=Waterford Crystal visitor centre opens|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0611/1224272270351.html|newspaper=Irish Times|date=6 June 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023040955/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0611/1224272270351.html|archivedate=23 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWaterford is also known for being the \"starting point\" of one of the biggest European airlines (as of 2013) \u2013 [[Ryanair]]'s first flight was a 14-seat [[Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante|Embraer Bandeirante]] [[turboprop]] aircraft, flying between Waterford and [[Gatwick Airport]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://airlineworld.wordpress.com/2007/10/04/tony-ryan-founder-of-ryanair-passes-away/ |title=Tony Ryan Obituary |website=Airlineworld.wordpress.com |date=4 October 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110812175229/http://airlineworld.wordpress.com/2007/10/04/tony-ryan-founder-of-ryanair-passes-away/ |archivedate=12 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Map of Waterford.png|thumb|Map of Waterford]]\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate of Waterford is, like the rest of Ireland, classified as a [[maritime climate|maritime temperate climate]] (''Cfb'') according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system.

This is the part of the city surrounded by the original 10th century fortifications, which is triangular in shape with its apex at Reginald's Tower. Though this was once the site of a thriving Viking city, the city centre has shifted to the west over the years, and it is now a quiet and tranquil area, dominated by narrow streets, medieval architecture, and civic spaces. Over the past decade, a number of restaurants have opened in High Street and Henrietta Street, taking advantage of the charming character of the area. Much of Waterford's impressive architecture is to be found in the 'Viking Triangle'.\n\nIn the 15th century, the city was enlarged with the building of an outer wall on the west side. Today Waterford retains more of its city walls than any other city in Ireland with the exception of [[Derry]], whose walls were built much later. Tours of Waterford's city walls are conducted daily.\n\nThe Quay, once termed by historian [[Mark Girouard]] 'the noblest quay in Europe', is a mile long from Grattan Quay to Adelphi Quay, though Adelphi Quay is now a residential area. It is still a major focal point for Waterford, commercially and socially, and the face that Waterford presents to those travelling into the city from the north. Near Reginald's Tower is the [[William Vincent Wallace]] Plaza, a monument and amenity built around the time of the millennium that commemorates the Waterford born composer.\n\nJohn Roberts Square is a pedestrianised area that is one of the main focal points of Waterford's modern day commercial centre. It was named after the city's most celebrated architect, John Roberts, and was formed from the junction of Barronstrand Street, Broad Street and George's Street. It is often referred to locally as Red Square, due to the red paving that was used when the area was first pedestrianised. A short distance to the east of John Roberts Square is Arundel Square, another square with a fine commercial tradition, which the City Square shopping centre opens onto.\n\nBallybricken, in the west, just outside the city walls, is thought to have been Waterford's Irishtown, a type of settlement that often formed outside Irish cities to house the Vikings and Irish that had been expelled during the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]]. Ballybricken is an inner city neighbourhood with a long tradition, centred around Ballybricken hill, which was a large, open market-square. Today it has been converted into a green, civic space, but the Bull Post, where livestock was once bought and sold, still stands as a remnant of the hill's past.\n\n[[File:Waterfordcathedral.jpg|thumb|Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity on Barronstrand Street]]\n\nThe Mall is a fine Georgian thoroughfare, built by the Wide Streets Commission to extend the city southwards. It contains some of the city's finest Georgian architecture. The [[People's Park (Waterford)|People's Park]], Waterford's largest and finest park, is located nearby.\n\nFerrybank, in [[County Waterford]], is Waterford's only suburb north of the river. It contains a village centre of its own.\n\nIn April 2003 an important site combining a 5th-century [[Iron Age]] and 9th century [[Viking]] settlement was discovered at [[Woodstown]] near the city, which appears to have been a Viking town that predates all such settlements in Ireland.<ref>[http://www.vikingwaterford.com/ 9th Century Settlement found at Woodstown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218104315/http://vikingwaterford.com/ |date=18 December 2014 }} \u2013 vikingwaterford.com</ref>\n\n[[Waterford Crystal]] is manufactured in Waterford but in early 2009 the company moved it operations to continental Europe. A new Waterford Crystal visitor centre opened on 22 June 2010.\n\nWaterford's oldest public house (pub) can be found just outside the old 'Viking Triangle'. T & H Doolan's, of 31/32 George's Street, has been officially active and open to the public for over three hundred years. The official record of licences dates back to the 18th century but the premises is believed to be closer to five hundred years in age. A main element of the structure includes one of the original city walls, almost 1,000 years old, which can be viewed in the lounge area of the building.\n{{-}}\n\n==Economy==\nWaterford is the main city of Ireland's [[South-East Region, Ireland|South-East Region]]. Historically Waterford was an important trading port which brought much prosperity to the city throughout the city's eventful history. Throughout its history Waterford Crystal provided employment to thousands in the city and surrounding areas.\n\nWaterford Port is Ireland's closest deep-water port to mainland Europe, handling approximately 12% of Ireland's external trade by value.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterfordcity.ie/documents/reports/WCDB%20Strategy%202002-2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812205744/http://www.waterfordcity.ie/documents/reports/WCDB%20Strategy%202002-2012.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Waterford's most famous export, [[Waterford Crystal]], is an internationally known and highly sought after product that was manufactured in the city from 1783 to 2009 and again from 2010 to the present day.

The farmers of the area benefited from the sale of their produce (mostly [[butter]] and [[milk]]) to the co-op. In 1964, all of the co-ops in Waterford amalgamated to become Waterford Co-op. This led to the construction of a [[cheese]] factory on a greenfield site opposite the general store, and Kilmeadan cheese was to become one of the most recognised and successful [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] brands in the world, winning gold and bronze medals in the World Cheese Awards in London in 2005.\n\nWaterford is the site of a number of multinational companies including [[GlaxoSmithKline]], Bausch & Lomb, Nypro Healthcare, [[Sanofi]], West Pharmaceuticals, Hasbro, Teva Pharmaceuticals and Honeywell International.\n\nThe Irish economic recession from 2008 onwards has had a major negative impact on Waterford's economy. A number of multinational companies have closed, including Waterford Crystal (which subsequently reopened) and Talk Talk, which has led to a high level of unemployment.

The Irish name is ''Port L\u00e1irge'', meaning \"L\u00e1rag's port\".<ref name=McEneaney>''Discover Waterford'', by Eamon McEneaney (2001). ({{ISBN|0-86278-656-8}})</ref>\n\n[[Viking]] raiders first established a settlement near Waterford in 853. It and all the other [[longphort]]s were vacated in 902, the Vikings having been driven out by the native Irish. The Vikings re-established themselves in Ireland at Waterford in 914, led at first by [[Ottir Iarla]] (Jarl Ottar) until 917, and after that by [[Ragnall ua \u00cdmair]] and the [[U\u00ed \u00cdmair]] dynasty, and built what would be Ireland's first city. Among the most prominent [[rulers of Waterford]] was [[Ivar of Waterford]].\n\nIn 1167, [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], the deposed [[Kings of Leinster|King of Leinster]], failed in an attempt to take Waterford. He returned in 1170 with [[Cambro-Norman]] mercenaries under [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]] (known as Strongbow); together they besieged and took the city after a desperate defence. In furtherance of the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]], King [[Henry II of England]] landed at Waterford in 1171. Waterford and then [[Dublin]] were declared royal cities, with Dublin also declared capital of Ireland.\n\nThroughout the medieval period, Waterford was Ireland's second city after Dublin. In the 15th century Waterford repelled two pretenders to the English throne: [[Lambert Simnel]] and [[Perkin Warbeck]]. As a result, King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] gave the city its motto: ''Urbs Intacta Manet Waterfordia (Waterford remains the untaken city)''.\n\nAfter the Protestant Reformation, Waterford remained a [[Catholic]] city and participated in the [[Confederate Ireland|confederation of Kilkenny]] \u2013 an independent Catholic government from 1642 to 1649. This was ended abruptly by [[Oliver Cromwell]], who [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|brought the country back under English rule]]; his son-in-law [[Henry Ireton]] finally took Waterford in 1650 after a [[Siege of Waterford|major siege]].<ref name=\"NewHistory\" /> \nIn 1690, during the [[Williamite War]], the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Irish Army]] was [[Capture of Waterford|forced to surrender Waterford]] in the wake of the [[Battle of the Boyne]].\n\nThe 18th century was a period of huge prosperity for Waterford. Most of the city's best architecture appeared during this time. A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of the [[Waterford Barracks|Cavalry Barracks]] at the end of the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waterfordvikingtriangle.com/assets/A3-Heritage-walk-map.pdf|title=Heritage Walk map|accessdate=7 December 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208180034/http://waterfordvikingtriangle.com/assets/A3-Heritage-walk-map.pdf|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 19th century, Waterford City was deemed vulnerable and the British government erected three [[Martello tower]]s on the Hook Peninsula to reinforce the existing Fort at [[Duncannon]]. During the 19th century, great industries such as glass making and ship building thrived in the city.\n\nThe city was represented in the [[Palace of Westminster|Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] from 1891 to 1918 by [[John Redmond]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]], leader (from January 1900) of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. Redmond, then leader of the [[Charles Stuart Parnell|pro-Parnell]] faction of the party, defeated [[David Sheehy]] in 1891. In 1911, Br. Jerome Foley, Br. Dunstan Drumm and Br. Leopold Loughran left Waterford for [[Malvern, Victoria|Malvern, Australia]]. Here, they founded [[De La Salle College Malvern|a Catholic college]] which is still in existence today.<ref>Steve Stefanopolous, ''St. Joseph's Malvern'', 2003. Held by the De La Salle College Malvern Archives</ref> In July 1922, Waterford was the scene of fighting between [[Irish Free State]] and [[Irish Republican]] troops during the [[Irish Civil War]].\n\n===References in Annals of Inisfallen===\nSee [[Annals of Inisfallen]] (AI)\n* ''AI926.2 The fleet of Port L\u00e1irge [came] over land, and they settled on [[Lough Gur|Loch Gair]].''\n* ''AI927.2 A slaughter of the foreigners of Port L\u00e1irge [was inflicted] at Cell Mo-Chell\u00f3c by the men of [[Munster|Mumu]] and by the foreigners of [[Limerick|Luimnech]].''\n* ''AI984.2 A great naval expedition(?) by the sons of [[Ivar of Limerick|Aralt]] to Port L\u00e1irge, and they and the [[Brian Boru|son of Cenn\u00e9tig]] exchanged hostages there as a guarantee of both together providing a hosting to attack [[Dublin|\u00c1th Cliath]].

The authority came into operation on 1 June 2014. Prior to this the city had its own local council, [[Waterford City Council]]. The new Council is the result of a merger of Waterford City Council and [[Waterford County Council]]. The Council has 32 representatives (councillors) who are elected from five electoral areas. The city itself forms three of the electoral areas \u2013 which when combined form the Metropolitan District of Waterford \u2013 and returns a total of 18 councillors to Waterford City and County Council. Residents in these areas are restricted to voting for candidates located in their ward for [[local elections]]. The office of the [[List of rulers of Waterford|Mayor of Waterford]] was established in 1377. A mayor is then elected by the councillors from the two electoral areas of the Metropolitan District of Waterford every year, and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual may serve. Mary O'Halloran who was mayor during 2007\u20132008 was the first woman to hold the post. The current mayor is Adam Wyse.\n\nFor the purposes of [[Elections in the Republic of Ireland|elections]] to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the city is part of the [[Waterford (D\u00e1il constituency)|Waterford constituency]], which includes the county of Waterford except for those parts of the county near [[Clonmel]] that lie in [[Tipperary South (D\u00e1il constituency)|Tipperary South]].<ref name=\"ea-2009\">{{cite web |title=Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009: Schedule |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0004/sched.html |work=[[Irish Statute Book|Irish Statute Book database]] |accessdate=29 September 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125044921/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0004/sched.html |archivedate=25 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The constituency elects four deputies to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.

To this day, it remains Waterford's most recognisable landmark. It is believed to be the first building in Ireland to use mortar. The [[River Suir]], which flows through Waterford City, has provided a basis for the city's long maritime history. The place downriver from Waterford where the [[River Nore|Nore]] and the [[River Barrow|Barrow]] join the [[River Suir]] is known in Irish as ''Cumar na dTr\u00ed Uisce'' (\"The confluence of the three waters\"). Waterford Port has been one of Ireland's major ports for over a millennium. In the 19th century, shipbuilding was a major industry. The owners of the Neptune Shipyard, the [[Malcomson family]], built and operated the largest fleet of iron steamers in the world between the mid-1850s and the late 1860s, including five trans-Atlantic passenger liners.<ref name=McEneaney />\n\nToday, Waterford is known for [[Waterford Crystal]], a legacy of the city's former glass making industry.

They have a long and rich history. In 1982 they changed their name to The Barrack Street Concert Band. The new name reflected a change in instrumentation including flutes, saxophones, oboes and a full percussion section which led to more members joining and a wider variety of music being played. In 1994 the band won the All Ireland Senior Military Band Championships in [[Wesley College (Dublin)|Wesley college]], Dublin under the Baton of Mr Niall O'Connor and 10 years later, in 2004, the band won the South of Ireland Senior Military band Championships in Clonakilty Co Cork under the Baton of the band's current musical director Mr Mark Fitzgerald.\n* '''Waterford Film For All''' (WFFA)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waterfordfilmforall.com/|title=WFFA \u2013 Waterford Film For All|website=Waterfordfilmforall.com|accessdate=1 October 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525101057/http://www.waterfordfilmforall.com/|archivedate=25 May 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> is a non-profit film society whose aim is to offer an alternative to the cineplex experience in Waterford.

This is the part of the city surrounded by the original 10th century fortifications, which is triangular in shape with its apex at Reginald's Tower. Though this was once the site of a thriving Viking city, the city centre has shifted to the west over the years, and it is now a quiet and tranquil area, dominated by narrow streets, medieval architecture, and civic spaces. Over the past decade, a number of restaurants have opened in High Street and Henrietta Street, taking advantage of the charming character of the area. Much of Waterford's impressive architecture is to be found in the 'Viking Triangle'.\n\nIn the 15th century, the city was enlarged with the building of an outer wall on the west side. Today Waterford retains more of its city walls than any other city in Ireland with the exception of [[Derry]], whose walls were built much later. Tours of Waterford's city walls are conducted daily.\n\nThe Quay, once termed by historian [[Mark Girouard]] 'the noblest quay in Europe', is a mile long from Grattan Quay to Adelphi Quay, though Adelphi Quay is now a residential area. It is still a major focal point for Waterford, commercially and socially, and the face that Waterford presents to those travelling into the city from the north. Near Reginald's Tower is the [[William Vincent Wallace]] Plaza, a monument and amenity built around the time of the millennium that commemorates the Waterford born composer.\n\nJohn Roberts Square is a pedestrianised area that is one of the main focal points of Waterford's modern day commercial centre. It was named after the city's most celebrated architect, John Roberts, and was formed from the junction of Barronstrand Street, Broad Street and George's Street. It is often referred to locally as Red Square, due to the red paving that was used when the area was first pedestrianised. A short distance to the east of John Roberts Square is Arundel Square, another square with a fine commercial tradition, which the City Square shopping centre opens onto.\n\nBallybricken, in the west, just outside the city walls, is thought to have been Waterford's Irishtown, a type of settlement that often formed outside Irish cities to house the Vikings and Irish that had been expelled during the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]]. Ballybricken is an inner city neighbourhood with a long tradition, centred around Ballybricken hill, which was a large, open market-square. Today it has been converted into a green, civic space, but the Bull Post, where livestock was once bought and sold, still stands as a remnant of the hill's past.\n\n[[File:Waterfordcathedral.jpg|thumb|Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity on Barronstrand Street]]\n\nThe Mall is a fine Georgian thoroughfare, built by the Wide Streets Commission to extend the city southwards. It contains some of the city's finest Georgian architecture. The [[People's Park (Waterford)|People's Park]], Waterford's largest and finest park, is located nearby.\n\nFerrybank, in [[County Waterford]], is Waterford's only suburb north of the river. It contains a village centre of its own.\n\nIn April 2003 an important site combining a 5th-century [[Iron Age]] and 9th century [[Viking]] settlement was discovered at [[Woodstown]] near the city, which appears to have been a Viking town that predates all such settlements in Ireland.<ref>[http://www.vikingwaterford.com/ 9th Century Settlement found at Woodstown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218104315/http://vikingwaterford.com/ |date=18 December 2014 }} \u2013 vikingwaterford.com</ref>\n\n[[Waterford Crystal]] is manufactured in Waterford but in early 2009 the company moved it operations to continental Europe. A new Waterford Crystal visitor centre opened on 22 June 2010.\n\nWaterford's oldest public house (pub) can be found just outside the old 'Viking Triangle'. T & H Doolan's, of 31/32 George's Street, has been officially active and open to the public for over three hundred years. The official record of licences dates back to the 18th century but the premises is believed to be closer to five hundred years in age. A main element of the structure includes one of the original city walls, almost 1,000 years old, which can be viewed in the lounge area of the building.\n{{-}}\n\n==Economy==\nWaterford is the main city of Ireland's [[South-East Region, Ireland|South-East Region]]. Historically Waterford was an important trading port which brought much prosperity to the city throughout the city's eventful history. Throughout its history Waterford Crystal provided employment to thousands in the city and surrounding areas.\n\nWaterford Port is Ireland's closest deep-water port to mainland Europe, handling approximately 12% of Ireland's external trade by value.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterfordcity.ie/documents/reports/WCDB%20Strategy%202002-2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812205744/http://www.waterfordcity.ie/documents/reports/WCDB%20Strategy%202002-2012.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Waterford's most famous export, [[Waterford Crystal]], is an internationally known and highly sought after product that was manufactured in the city from 1783 to 2009 and again from 2010 to the present day. Places where Waterford Crystal can be seen include New York City, where Waterford Crystal made the 2,668 crystals for the famous New Year's Eve Ball that is dropped each year in [[Times Square]]; [[Westminster Abbey]]; [[Windsor Castle]]; and the [[Kennedy Center]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]<ref>Beeson, Trevor (2002).

[[Kilmeadan]], about 5&nbsp;km from the city, was home to a very successful [[co-operative]]. The farmers of the area benefited from the sale of their produce (mostly [[butter]] and [[milk]]) to the co-op. In 1964, all of the co-ops in Waterford amalgamated to become Waterford Co-op. This led to the construction of a [[cheese]] factory on a greenfield site opposite the general store, and Kilmeadan cheese was to become one of the most recognised and successful [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] brands in the world, winning gold and bronze medals in the World Cheese Awards in London in 2005.\n\nWaterford is the site of a number of multinational companies including [[GlaxoSmithKline]], Bausch & Lomb, Nypro Healthcare, [[Sanofi]], West Pharmaceuticals, Hasbro, Teva Pharmaceuticals and Honeywell International.\n\nThe Irish economic recession from 2008 onwards has had a major negative impact on Waterford's economy. A number of multinational companies have closed, including Waterford Crystal (which subsequently reopened) and Talk Talk, which has led to a high level of unemployment. Until 2013 the [[hedge fund]] office of the [[Citibank]] resided here.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/citi-bank-waterford-job-losses-910614-May2013|title=50 jobs lost as Citi Bank announce Waterford office closure|first=Christina|last=Finn|website=Thejournal.ie|accessdate=1 October 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002022108/http://www.thejournal.ie/citi-bank-waterford-job-losses-910614-May2013/|archivedate=2 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWaterford Co-op and Avonmore Co-op have merged to form Glanbia plc.<ref>{{Cite book|title=21st Century Business Revised Edition|last=Murphy|first=William|publisher=CJ Fallon|year=2014|isbn=978-0-7144-1923-7|location=Ground Floor \u2013 Block B, Liffey Valley Office Campus, Dublin 22|pages=437|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n{{Main|Transport in Waterford}}\n\nThe [[M9 motorway (Ireland)|M9 motorway]], which was completed on 9 September 2010, connects the city to [[Dublin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishmotorwayinfo.com/inex/roads/m9/m9.html|title=M9 Motorway|author=Irish Motorway Info|work=irishmotorwayinfo.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721075015/http://www.irishmotorwayinfo.com/inex/roads/m9/m9.html|archivedate=21 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[N24 road (Ireland)|N24]] road connects the city to [[Limerick]] city.

The Ba/Ma-kholokoe are found in the Easter Free State (Harrismith, Wetsieshoek, Vrede, Kestel, etc.), Kwazulu/Natal(Nqutu) and Mpumalanga (Daggakraal, Amersfoort) as their historical residence. The Ba/Ma-kholokoe are the descendants of the originally Bantu-Speaking tribes from the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantu_peoples central Congo region who migrated Southwards around 600 AD]. They are the offspring of Bakgatla Chief Tabane and Mathulare daughter of the Bafokeng Chief. Tabane fathered five sons, Diale, Kgetsi, Kgwadi (Motl\u00f4kwa), Matsibolo/Matsiboho, and Mosia (in order of their birth). Each broke away to form Bapedi, Ba/Ma-kholokwe, Batl\u00f4kwa, Maphuthing and Basia respectively. Ba/Ma-kholokoe demonstrated linguistic and cultural characteristics that distinguished them from other Bantu-speakers of southern Africa, with their language showing a merger of South Sotho and [[Nguni language]]s. Other practices included totemism (Ba/Ma-kholokoe totem is Phuthi - Duiker, some still hold on to the fowl, while others the porcupine), the preferential marriage of paternal cousins, and an architectural style characterized by a round hut with a conical thatch roof. The senior house of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe is the house of Moduli/Molupi, they are the Makholokoe a Letseba \"letseba le letsebilae ke mang, le Mokholoane a shoele a sa le tsebe\". Tabane first son from his senior wife Matlaisane remained with the Bakgatla ba Mot\u0161ha group, after Tabane concurred the Ba-Venda nation he married a [https://luonde.co.za/venda-kingship/ Ba-Venda wife and fathered a son called Vele].\n\n=== History (Nalane) ===\n \nThe traditions of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolong_tribe Barolong kingdoms] indicate that at some time in the past up until the leadership battles of the 14th Century they were all under the same rule of a line of kings who claimed descent from a common ancestor, Morolong. Following the death of Morolong's 4th generation great- grandson Masilo there was a leadership crisis that resulted in the formation of the Ba-Hurutshe and Ba-Kwena clans. Ba/Ma-kholokoe claim lineage from the Ba-Hurutshe clan and traced their early ancestry to Mokgatla, the founder of the BaKgatla and his 4th generation great grandson Tabane. \n\nAround 1560 Kgetsi/Khetsi(Lekholokoe) son of Tabane married Mabale and fathered Moloi, Moloi married Maleseha and fathered Hlabathe, Hlabathe fathered Sehoala/Sehoele, Sehoala married Malekoesa and fathered Tjale, Tjale fathered Tsholedi, Tsholedi married Malekunya and fathered Motsoane, Motsoane fathered Mokholoane, fathered Matsemela who married Madiale and fathered the five known houses of Kholokoe Leubane, Maphale, Tsele, Motaoane and with Matsholedi fathered Lehasa. \n\nBefore the birth of Kgetsi/Khetsi, his father Tabane with other Bakgatla lived around \"Thaba tsa Mohale\" known today as [[Magaliesberg]], during the 1600s Kgetsi/Khetsi took his group and moved eastwards and North of Lekoa (Vaal) settling near Seratoe today [[Standerton]], at a mountain which since their occupation became Thaba Kholokoe.  This is where Ba/Ma-kholokoe lived for over 200 years, about eight to nine generations until the attacks of Matiwane in 1822, Mzilikazi in 1823 and is considered the birthplace of Ba/Ma-khlokoe. Some of the Ba/Ma-kholokoe Kings/Chief that lived in Thaba Kholokoe:\n- Kgetsi\n- Moloi\n- Hlabate\n- Sehoaba/Sehoele\n- Tyale\n- Tsholedi\n- Motsoane\n- Mokholoane\n- Matsemela\nFrom Thaba Kholokoe Ba/Ma-kholokoe spread to many areas around the Free State and Natal. One group under the leadership of Morena Wetsi (Oetsi) settled in today's Wetsieshoek, where many Ba/Ma-kholokoe were killed inside a [[Witsie's Cave (Lekhalong la Witsie)|cave]] during a war against the Boers. The kinship/chieftaincy of Bakholokoe has always been marked by disagreement and internal feuds, living the legacy for this leadership still in question to this day. \n\nAlthough many consider the totem of Ba/Ma-kholokoe as a [[:nso:Phuti|Phuthi]] (duiker), it is believed that this small antelope led Bakholokoe to safety during a war, there are some that say the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe totem is a porcupine [[Porcupine]].\n\n=== Land (Naha) ===\n \nAlthough one would love to hear the anecdotal side of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe history, it is unfortunately heavily clouded by the ever-present and festering issue of land and property dispossession and subsequent brutal oppression and painful suffering of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, first from the Dutch \u2015Boer\u2016 Government (Volksraad) of the Free State, and subsequently from the British Orange River Colony Administration and even in the modern times, especially under the Bantustan (Native Homelands) system of the nineteen seventy's and the nineteen eighty's, during which period people like the late Qwaqwa Homeland Prime Minister T.K.Mopeli, ruthlessly sought to and nearly achieved destroying the BaKholokoe Tribe! Much of the history written today states that Qwaqwa formerly known as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phuthaditjhaba Wetzieshoek] was residence to only two Basotho tribes Bakoena and Batlokoa completely ignoring the presence of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe.\n\nLike many other tribes, Bakholokoe were dispossessed of their land leading to their traditional leaders, the Batlokoa traditional leaders and the then secretary of Bakholokoe traditional council  [[Josiah_Tshangana_Gumede|JT Gumede]] going to England in 1906 to protest the Bakhlokoe and Batlokoa losing their ancestral land to the former Boer republics. \n\nAs early as 1837 the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe tribe was already resident in the northern Free State around the Maluti region, Northern Natal around the Klip River region and the Vaal River region, notably the areas of the Witsieshoek district and the Harrismith district. In 1856 the Ba-Kholokoe, under Morena Wetsi, were forcefully dispossessed of this part of their territory by the Free State Dutch Government, on wholly unjustifiable pretenses, only two years after the Convention of Bloemfontein of 1854.\n\nIn 1866 Commandant C. de Villiers, also popularly known as Masoothonyane, who was then in charge of the Thaba Nchu, i.e. Harrismith district, and a member of the Volksraad, requested the tribes to assist the Free State Government in the war against Moshoeshoe. They rendered military service as the Free Burgher Natives, and their armed contingents were known as the \u2015Witlaps\u2016 and the \u2015Ringhals\u2016. The services were rendered firstly in consideration to secure and confirm the Tribes in free possession of the lands they then occupied, and secondly after successful conclusion of that war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 head of cattle to Commandant De Villiers acting for his Government, he agreed to the enlargement of the lands occupied by the Tribes. He, De Villiers actually promised them that the land, approximately 2130 square miles (551 667 hectares) - which the tribes were already occupying, would be secured for them. This is war talk, since in a way he was indirectly saying that this land that they were occupying could at any time be expropriated, if need be by forceful declaration and action, from them. \n\nAt least up to and according to the guarantees of the Proclamation of 1848, no land occupied by these Tribes had been encroached by any Europeans, so De Villiers appeared to be acting in good faith as based on that Proclamation. After the conclusion of the war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 cattle, it was agreed that all the land occupied mainly by two tribes, BaTlokoa and Ba-Kholokoe, who assisted Commandant De Villiers and the Boers in the war against Moshoeshoe, would then be given to them, after it has also been enlarged. There were three payments which were made for the purchase of three different areas of the land: 2450 cattle paid for the Halspruit area, made by the BaTlokoa tribe, 4000 cattle paid for the Klip Rivier area, the land situated in the Vrede and Harrismith Districts, also made by the BaTlokoa tribe, and 3000 cattle paid for the Mill River Valley in the Harrismith district, made by the Ba-Kholokoe tribe. The payments for the land of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe were made by Morena Lesisa Tsotetsi, who was representing heirs of Morena Letika and Morena Lesala, both who were the late Marena (Chiefs) of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. He paid the combined 6450 cattle for both the Halspruit and Klip Rivier areas, which were largely occupied by the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. The Halspruit area was home to the Ba-Tlokoa tribe under the late Morena Lesala, and the Klip Rivier area was under the late Morena Letika, both of whom were now represented by Morena Lesisa. The payment for the Mill River Valley land, which covered both Thabantsu and Witsieshoek districts of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe was made by Morena Letlatsa Moloi, who was representing heirs of the Late Morena Hlomise, son of the late Morena Oetsi (\u2015Witsie\u2016) of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe. However, in 1888 the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, after having received notice to leave the land, were forcibly evicted without any compensation. The struggle to regain their land had begun. \n\nChief Letlatsa Moloi of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe became a thorn in the flesh for Captain John Quayle Dickson, the Advisor for Native Affairs in the British Colonial Orange Free State government. On the 5th of September 1903, Captain John Quayle Dickson wrote to Sir Harry Smith from his office in Bloemfontein indicating that he had visited Thabantsu (Harrismith) where he and the Regional Magistrate of the Thaba Nchu territory had personally met and informed Paramount Chief Letlasa of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe that from then onwards he would be granted no special privileges whatsoever, and that he was now stripped of his position as one of the well-known and respected Morena oa Ba-Kholokoe, declaring him to be \u2015just another Native\u2016, and therefore from then in his opinion Paramount Chief Letlatsa will give no further trouble. Yet more trouble from the cheated and dispossessed tribes was coming! The boundaries of these areas were well defined as verified at the inquiry held in Harrismith by Captain John Quayle Dickson, Advisor for Native affairs, and Magistrate Leary, as reported in Captain Dickson's letter of 23rd June 1906. A Mr. F Van Reenen also testified to the fact that Commander De Villiers had cheated these native Chiefs in dealing with them, and when this was brought to the knowledge of the Free State government, it forced his resignation from the Volksraad.\n\n=== Battles fought by Ba/Ma-Kholokoe ===\n\nSome of the history states that Ba/Ma-Kholokoe were not great warriors but according to the battles fought, won and lost the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe were as good warriors as any other tribe that lived in that era. Many Battles were fought at Thaba Kholokoe, with Mzilikazi have attacked Ba/Ma-Kholokoe a number of times.\n\nIn 1821 the [https://www.wdl.org/en/item/3269/view/1/231/ battle between (Mahlapo) of Chief Mofeli and Ba/Ma-Kholokoe] under Chief Polane saw Polane and his Son Selotolotsa Killed, alongside many others and their cattle were taken.\n\n[http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/9701/Appendix%201-11.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y In 1856/7 the battle of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe under Chief Wetsi/Oetsi] and the Boers saw many Ba/Makholokoe killed in the cave while Wetsi managed to escape to Lesotho.\n\n=== Genealogical tree of Ba/Ma-kholokoe ===\n\n[[File:New Makholokoe (2).png|thumb|Updated family tree]]\n[[File:Genealogy Bakgatla.jpg|thumb|Genealogy of Bakgatla from Morolong]]\n\n=== Some of the notable Ba/Ma-kholokoe ===\n\n* [[Precious_Moloi-Motsepe|Dr Precious Moloi Motsepe]]\n* [[Teboho Moloi]]\n* Dr Matholela Lucas Moloi\n* Pabi Moloi\n* [[Timothy Moloi]]\n* Nchakha Moloi\n* Vusi Moloi\n* Godfrey Moloi\n* Lehasa Moloi\n* [[Lerato Moloi]]\n* Onicca Moloi\n* Nana Moloi\n* [[Thabo Moloi]]\n=== Sources ===\n\n* DIE MAKHOLOKOE STAMHOOFDE, DIE GEKOSE STAMHOOF \u2013\nLETSITSA (II) \u2013 MOJALEFA OA BORENA BA MAKHOLOKOE\u2016, as\nrecorded in 1429 by the QWAQWA PRINTERS.

Tabane fathered five sons, Diale, Kgetsi, Kgwadi (Motl\u00f4kwa), Matsibolo/Matsiboho, and Mosia (in order of their birth). Each broke away to form Bapedi, Ba/Ma-kholokwe, Batl\u00f4kwa, Maphuthing and Basia respectively. Ba/Ma-kholokoe demonstrated linguistic and cultural characteristics that distinguished them from other Bantu-speakers of southern Africa, with their language showing a merger of South Sotho and [[Nguni language]]s. Other practices included totemism (Ba/Ma-kholokoe totem is Phuthi - Duiker, some still hold on to the fowl, while others the porcupine), the preferential marriage of paternal cousins, and an architectural style characterized by a round hut with a conical thatch roof. The senior house of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe is the house of Moduli/Molupi, they are the Makholokoe a Letseba \"letseba le letsebilae ke mang, le Mokholoane a shoele a sa le tsebe\". Tabane first son from his senior wife Matlaisane remained with the Bakgatla ba Mot\u0161ha group, after Tabane concurred the Ba-Venda nation he married a [https://luonde.co.za/venda-kingship/ Ba-Venda wife and fathered a son called Vele].\n\n=== History (Nalane) ===\n \nThe traditions of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolong_tribe Barolong kingdoms] indicate that at some time in the past up until the leadership battles of the 14th Century they were all under the same rule of a line of kings who claimed descent from a common ancestor, Morolong. Following the death of Morolong's 4th generation great- grandson Masilo there was a leadership crisis that resulted in the formation of the Ba-Hurutshe and Ba-Kwena clans. Ba/Ma-kholokoe claim lineage from the Ba-Hurutshe clan and traced their early ancestry to Mokgatla, the founder of the BaKgatla and his 4th generation great grandson Tabane. \n\nAround 1560 Kgetsi/Khetsi(Lekholokoe) son of Tabane married Mabale and fathered Moloi, Moloi married Maleseha and fathered Hlabathe, Hlabathe fathered Sehoala/Sehoele, Sehoala married Malekoesa and fathered Tjale, Tjale fathered Tsholedi, Tsholedi married Malekunya and fathered Motsoane, Motsoane fathered Mokholoane, fathered Matsemela who married Madiale and fathered the five known houses of Kholokoe Leubane, Maphale, Tsele, Motaoane and with Matsholedi fathered Lehasa. \n\nBefore the birth of Kgetsi/Khetsi, his father Tabane with other Bakgatla lived around \"Thaba tsa Mohale\" known today as [[Magaliesberg]], during the 1600s Kgetsi/Khetsi took his group and moved eastwards and North of Lekoa (Vaal) settling near Seratoe today [[Standerton]], at a mountain which since their occupation became Thaba Kholokoe.  This is where Ba/Ma-kholokoe lived for over 200 years, about eight to nine generations until the attacks of Matiwane in 1822, Mzilikazi in 1823 and is considered the birthplace of Ba/Ma-khlokoe. Some of the Ba/Ma-kholokoe Kings/Chief that lived in Thaba Kholokoe:\n- Kgetsi\n- Moloi\n- Hlabate\n- Sehoaba/Sehoele\n- Tyale\n- Tsholedi\n- Motsoane\n- Mokholoane\n- Matsemela\nFrom Thaba Kholokoe Ba/Ma-kholokoe spread to many areas around the Free State and Natal. One group under the leadership of Morena Wetsi (Oetsi) settled in today's Wetsieshoek, where many Ba/Ma-kholokoe were killed inside a [[Witsie's Cave (Lekhalong la Witsie)|cave]] during a war against the Boers. The kinship/chieftaincy of Bakholokoe has always been marked by disagreement and internal feuds, living the legacy for this leadership still in question to this day. \n\nAlthough many consider the totem of Ba/Ma-kholokoe as a [[:nso:Phuti|Phuthi]] (duiker), it is believed that this small antelope led Bakholokoe to safety during a war, there are some that say the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe totem is a porcupine [[Porcupine]].\n\n=== Land (Naha) ===\n \nAlthough one would love to hear the anecdotal side of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe history, it is unfortunately heavily clouded by the ever-present and festering issue of land and property dispossession and subsequent brutal oppression and painful suffering of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, first from the Dutch \u2015Boer\u2016 Government (Volksraad) of the Free State, and subsequently from the British Orange River Colony Administration and even in the modern times, especially under the Bantustan (Native Homelands) system of the nineteen seventy's and the nineteen eighty's, during which period people like the late Qwaqwa Homeland Prime Minister T.K.Mopeli, ruthlessly sought to and nearly achieved destroying the BaKholokoe Tribe! Much of the history written today states that Qwaqwa formerly known as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witsie%27s_Cave_(Lekhalong_la_Witsie) Wetsieshoek] was residence to only two Basotho tribes Bakoena and Batlokoa completely ignoring the presence of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe.\n\nLike many other tribes, Bakholokoe were dispossessed of their land leading to their traditional leaders, the Batlokoa traditional leaders and the then secretary of Bakholokoe traditional council  [[Josiah_Tshangana_Gumede|JT Gumede]] going to England in 1906 to protest the Bakhlokoe and Batlokoa losing their ancestral land to the former Boer republics. \n\nAs early as 1837 the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe tribe was already resident in the northern Free State around the Maluti region, Northern Natal around the Klip River region and the Vaal River region, notably the areas of the Witsieshoek district and the Harrismith district. In 1856 the Ba-Kholokoe, under Morena Wetsi, were forcefully dispossessed of this part of their territory by the Free State Dutch Government, on wholly unjustifiable pretenses, only two years after the Convention of Bloemfontein of 1854.\n\nIn 1866 Commandant C. de Villiers, also popularly known as Masoothonyane, who was then in charge of the Thaba Nchu, i.e. Harrismith district, and a member of the Volksraad, requested the tribes to assist the Free State Government in the war against Moshoeshoe. They rendered military service as the Free Burgher Natives, and their armed contingents were known as the \u2015Witlaps\u2016 and the \u2015Ringhals\u2016. The services were rendered firstly in consideration to secure and confirm the Tribes in free possession of the lands they then occupied, and secondly after successful conclusion of that war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 head of cattle to Commandant De Villiers acting for his Government, he agreed to the enlargement of the lands occupied by the Tribes. He, De Villiers actually promised them that the land, approximately 2130 square miles (551 667 hectares) - which the tribes were already occupying, would be secured for them. This is war talk, since in a way he was indirectly saying that this land that they were occupying could at any time be expropriated, if need be by forceful declaration and action, from them. \n\nAt least up to and according to the guarantees of the Proclamation of 1848, no land occupied by these Tribes had been encroached by any Europeans, so De Villiers appeared to be acting in good faith as based on that Proclamation. After the conclusion of the war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 cattle, it was agreed that all the land occupied mainly by two tribes, BaTlokoa and Ba-Kholokoe, who assisted Commandant De Villiers and the Boers in the war against Moshoeshoe, would then be given to them, after it has also been enlarged. There were three payments which were made for the purchase of three different areas of the land: 2450 cattle paid for the Halspruit area, made by the BaTlokoa tribe, 4000 cattle paid for the Klip Rivier area, the land situated in the Vrede and Harrismith Districts, also made by the BaTlokoa tribe, and 3000 cattle paid for the Mill River Valley in the Harrismith district, made by the Ba-Kholokoe tribe. The payments for the land of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe were made by Morena Lesisa Tsotetsi, who was representing heirs of Morena Letika and Morena Lesala, both who were the late Marena (Chiefs) of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. He paid the combined 6450 cattle for both the Halspruit and Klip Rivier areas, which were largely occupied by the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. The Halspruit area was home to the Ba-Tlokoa tribe under the late Morena Lesala, and the Klip Rivier area was under the late Morena Letika, both of whom were now represented by Morena Lesisa. The payment for the Mill River Valley land, which covered both Thabantsu and Witsieshoek districts of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe was made by Morena Letlatsa Moloi, who was representing heirs of the Late Morena Hlomise, son of the late Morena Oetsi (\u2015Witsie\u2016) of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe. However, in 1888 the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, after having received notice to leave the land, were forcibly evicted without any compensation. The struggle to regain their land had begun. \n\nChief Letlatsa Moloi of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe became a thorn in the flesh for Captain John Quayle Dickson, the Advisor for Native Affairs in the British Colonial Orange Free State government. On the 5th of September 1903, Captain John Quayle Dickson wrote to Sir Harry Smith from his office in Bloemfontein indicating that he had visited Thabantsu (Harrismith) where he and the Regional Magistrate of the Thaba Nchu territory had personally met and informed Paramount Chief Letlasa of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe that from then onwards he would be granted no special privileges whatsoever, and that he was now stripped of his position as one of the well-known and respected Morena oa Ba-Kholokoe, declaring him to be \u2015just another Native\u2016, and therefore from then in his opinion Paramount Chief Letlatsa will give no further trouble. Yet more trouble from the cheated and dispossessed tribes was coming! The boundaries of these areas were well defined as verified at the inquiry held in Harrismith by Captain John Quayle Dickson, Advisor for Native affairs, and Magistrate Leary, as reported in Captain Dickson's letter of 23rd June 1906. A Mr. F Van Reenen also testified to the fact that Commander De Villiers had cheated these native Chiefs in dealing with them, and when this was brought to the knowledge of the Free State government, it forced his resignation from the Volksraad.\n\n=== Battles fought by Ba/Ma-Kholokoe ===\n\nSome of the history states that Ba/Ma-Kholokoe were not great warriors but according to the battles fought, won and lost the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe were as good warriors as any other tribe that lived in that era. Many Battles were fought at Thaba Kholokoe, with Mzilikazi have attacked Ba/Ma-Kholokoe a number of times.\n\nIn 1821 the [https://www.wdl.org/en/item/3269/view/1/231/ battle between (Mahlapo) of Chief Mofeli and Ba/Ma-Kholokoe] under Chief Polane saw Polane and his Son Selotolotsa Killed, alongside many others and their cattle were taken.\n\n[http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/9701/Appendix%201-11.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y In 1856/7 the battle of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe under Chief Wetsi/Oetsi] and the Boers saw many Ba/Makholokoe killed in the cave while Wetsi managed to escape to Lesotho.\n\n=== Genealogical tree of Ba/Ma-kholokoe ===\n\n[[File:New Makholokoe (2).png|thumb|Updated family tree]]\n[[File:Genealogy Bakgatla.jpg|thumb|Genealogy of Bakgatla from Morolong]]\n\n=== Some of the notable Ba/Ma-kholokoe ===\n\n* [[Precious_Moloi-Motsepe|Dr Precious Moloi Motsepe]]\n* [[Teboho Moloi]]\n* Dr Matholela Lucas Moloi\n* Pabi Moloi\n* [[Timothy Moloi]]\n* Nchakha Moloi\n* Vusi Moloi\n* Godfrey Moloi\n* Lehasa Moloi\n* [[Lerato Moloi]]\n* Onicca Moloi\n* Nana Moloi\n* [[Thabo Moloi]]\n=== Sources ===\n\n* DIE MAKHOLOKOE STAMHOOFDE, DIE GEKOSE STAMHOOF \u2013\nLETSITSA (II) \u2013 MOJALEFA OA BORENA BA MAKHOLOKOE\u2016, as\nrecorded in 1429 by the QWAQWA PRINTERS.

He came from a family which produced three generations of eminent lawyers, with the  father, son and grandson each bearing the name Gerald FitzGibbon.\n\n==Background and early career==\nHe was the elder of the two sons of [[Gerald Fitzgibbon (author)|Gerald FitzGibbon]], QC, Master in Chancery (1793-1882), and his wife Ellen Patterson, daughter of John Patterson of [[Belfast]] (died 1885); his younger brother Henry (died 1912) was a distinguished doctor.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921''  London John Murray 1926 Vol. 2 p.372</ref> The younger Gerald  was educated at [[Trinity College Dublin]], where he was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|elected a Scholar]]. He retained deep feelings of affection and loyalty towards Trinity College throughout his life, and gave evidence on its behalf before a Royal Commission in 1906.<ref>David Fitzgerald, \"Gerald FitzGibbon\" ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', 1912 Supplement, p.30</ref>\n\nHe entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1857. He was called to the [[Bar Council of Ireland|Irish Bar]] in 1860 and to the [[Barristers in England and Wales|English Bar]] the following year. He went on the [[Munster]] Circuit, where he quickly acquired a large practice. He was a fine lawyer and an eloquent public  speaker. [[Maurice Healy (writer)|Maurice Healy]] recalled his \"beautiful voice\", which  was sometimes compared  to that of the great Russian singer [[Feodor Chaliapin]]: this, combined with a certain natural acting ability, made his arguments extraordinarily persuasive.\n\nHis  Courtroom victories included the [[libel]] action ''O'Keeffe v Cardinal Cullen'', an unprecedented legal victory by a [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Catholic priest]] against [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Paul Cullen (cardinal)|Paul Cullen]] (although the verdict was reversed on appeal).<ref>(1873) I.R. 7 C.L. 319; the alleged libel was in fact a sentence of suspension.</ref>\n\nAnother  triumph  was in the disputed [[Will (law)|will]] case  of ''Bagot v Bagot'', where he appeared for Mrs. Alice Bagot (ne Verner), daughter of [[Sir William Verner, 2nd Baronet]] and Mary Pakenham, and  widow of Christopher  Nevile Bagot,  of Aughrane Castle,  [[Justice of the Peace]] for [[County Galway]]. Her husband had denied [[paternity (law)|paternity]] of her son, William,  and [[inheritance|disinherited]]  him in favour  \nof Christopher's brother John. Fitzgibbon's eloquence, in the teeth of formidable medical evidence on the paternity issue  produced by  John Bagot, who was  the [[beneficiary]]  under  his brother's will,  persuaded the jury that  Christopher Bagot was under a temporary mental delusion when he wrote his will, and that the child was his.<ref>''[[The Spectator]] Archive'' 25 May 1878</ref>\n\nHaving initially declined to take silk in 1868, he became [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1872.<ref>Fitzgerald p.30</ref> He was a Bencher of the [[King's Inns]], and his portrait hangs in the Dining Hall there.\n\nIn 1876 he became [[Law Adviser to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], and the following year he became [[Solicitor General for Ireland]].<ref>Ball p.372</ref>\n\n==Lord Justice of Appeal==\nIn 1878 he was appointed to the Bench as [[Lord Justice]] of the [[Court of Appeal in Ireland]], with the general approval of the  legal profession and the Press, who praised both his political moderation and his legal ability. He  served on that Court with immense distinction for more than thirty years.\n\n===Reputation===\nThe old Court of Appeal  has been  described as  probably the strongest judicial tribunal ever to exist in Ireland, due to the presence of such exceptional judges as Fitzgibbon himself, [[Hugh Holmes]], [[Christopher Palles]] and [[Edward Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne|Lord Ashbourne]].  While Palles is usually regarded as the greatest of the  Irish judges of his time, some contemporaries thought that FitzGibbon was at least his equal: it is noteworthy that when the [[House of Lords]] heard  appeals from  decisions where FitzGibbon had dissented, they almost always preferred his view to that of his colleagues.<ref>Fitzgerald p.30</ref>\n\nMaurice Healy believed that FitzGibbon as a judge fell short of true greatness due to a certain lack of judicial impartiality, in that if he had a strong sympathy for one party to the appeal, he always found a way of deciding  the case  in their favour.<ref>Maurice Healy, ''The Old Munster Circuit'' (1939), Mecier Press edition, pp. 260\u20131</ref> On the other hand, Healy thought that the courtesy with which he conducted every appeal, and the deep interest he took in the legal arguments, made appearing in front of him \"an intellectual treat\".<ref>Healy p.260</ref> Delaney praises Fitzgibbon  both for his profound erudition and his innate sense of justice.<ref>V.T.H. Delaney, ''Christopher Palles'',  Allen Figgis and Co Dublin (1960) p.138</ref> However he  agrees with Healy that FitzGibbon, like Lord Ashbourne, was a pragmatist, who would always try to find in favour of the party he believed to have justice on their side, even if the precedents  pointed  the other way. Palles and Holmes, by contrast, although they were no less anxious to do justice between the parties, went strictly by the precedents.<ref>Delaney p.158</ref>\n\n===''Quinn v Leathem''===\nFitzgibbon went regularly on [[assizes]], most often to Belfast. It was there in 1896 that he sat as the trial judge, with a jury, in the controversial case of ''[[Quinn v Leathem]]''.<ref>[1901] A.C 495</ref> The House of Lords subsequently found that for several members of a [[trade union]] to ask a businessman only to deal with customers who employ union labour amounts to a [[conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]] to injure him, even though such a request, when made by an individual, had previously been found by the same tribunal in ''[[Allen v Flood]]''<ref>[1898] A.C. 1</ref> to be perfectly lawful. While the judgment on appeal aroused great indignation among trade unions, FitzGibbon, from the report of his summing up to the jury, seems to have stated the law (as it stood at the time) correctly.\n\n===Judicial style===\nHis judgments were written in a clear, sharp and decisive style, often with an abrupt opening sentence such as:  \"I doubt that the [Court of]  King's Bench can have been conscious of the consequences of its decision in this case\".<ref>''Antrim County Land, Building and Investment Co. v Stewart'' [1904] 2 I.R 357</ref>\n\nA good example of his judicial style can be found in  ''Aaron's Reefs v Twiss'',<ref>[1895] 2 1R 207</ref> where the Court of Appeal were divided on the question of whether certain statements in a company's [[prospectus (finance)|prospectus]] were simply \"optimistic\" or actually [[fraudulent]]. FitzGibbon found that there is no legal difference between a company which omits crucial facts from its prospectus and one which deliberately misrepresents the facts, remarking that:  \"if a company cannot be floated if the whole truth be disclosed by its prospectus, it cannot be honestly launched at all\". To the argument that the application of this standard of commercial honesty would be fatal to most company prospectuses, he observed drily: \"So much the better\".<ref>[1895] 2 IR 207, at 269</ref>\n\n==Political and social life==\nHe was a  Conservative in politics, and a close friend of [[Lord Randolph Churchill]];<ref>Roy Jenkins, ''Churchill''  Macmillan London 2001, p.13</ref> it was in a letter to FitzGibbon in 1886 that Churchill remarked that to effectively oppose the support of [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]  for  [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish Home Rule]], \"the [[Orange Order|Orange]] card would be the one to play\".<ref>Kenneth Ferguson, ''King's Inns Barristers 1868\u20132004'', Dublin 2005 p.48</ref> Yet FitzGibbon  was noted for his political moderation: he had a wide circle of friends of differing political views, and his daughter Anne married a close relative of Gladstone. His house, Kilrock,<ref>Kilrock House still exists and is now operated by the Health Services Executive.</ref> on the Hill of [[Howth]], was one of the centres of Dublin social life: here he entertained not only his legal colleagues, but many of the leading Irish and  British politicians of the day.<ref>Ferguson p.48</ref> His Christmas parties at Kilrock were for many years one of the high points of the Dublin  social calendar.<ref>Ball p.322</ref>\n\nHe was a man of great erudition, and had numerous interests outside the law. He was a devoted member of the [[Church of Ireland]], and spoke eloquently in 1904 of his confidence in the future of \"the Church which I love\".<ref>Ferguson p.47</ref> He was a member of the [[General Synod]] of the Church: he was called the most influential  Protestant laymen of his time, and was rewarded with a statue in St. Patrick's Cathedral.<ref>Ferguson p.47</ref> At the same time he was an active [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], and contributed much of his time and money to Masonic causes and charities.<ref>Fitzgerald p.31</ref>\n\nHe took a deep interest in  the future of Irish education, and  chaired a committee on educational endowments from 1885 to 1897. He gave evidence to the Royal Commission on the future of Trinity College Dublin, and the [[University of Dublin]] in 1906.<ref>Delaney p.23</ref> He strongly defended the University's policy on the admission of [[Irish Catholic|Catholics]], pointing out that Chief Baron Palles - one of his most distinguished colleagues on the Bench - was a Catholic graduate of the same University, and shared FitzGibbon's deep attachment to it.<ref>Delaney p.23</ref> He generously praised [[Clongowes Wood College]], Palles' old school, as an example of the best of Roman Catholic education.<ref>Delaney p.23</ref>\n\nHe was a member of both the [[Privy Council of Ireland]] and from 1900 of the [[British Privy Council]].<ref>Ball p.372</ref>\n\n==Death and tributes==\nHe died rather suddenly at Kilrock on 14 October 1909.

He came from a family which produced three generations of eminent lawyers, with the  father, son and grandson each bearing the name Gerald FitzGibbon.\n\n==Background and early career==\nHe was the elder of the two sons of [[Gerald Fitzgibbon (author)|Gerald FitzGibbon]], QC, Master in Chancery (1793-1882), and his wife Ellen Patterson of [[Belfast]] (died 1885); his younger brother Henry (died 1912) was a distinguished doctor.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921''  London John Murray 1926 Vol. 2 p.372</ref> The younger Gerald  was educated at [[Trinity College Dublin]], where he was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|elected a Scholar]]. He retained deep feelings of affection and loyalty towards Trinity College throughout his life, and gave evidence on its behalf before a Royal Commission in 1906.<ref>David Fitzgerald, \"Gerald FitzGibbon\" ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', 1912 Supplement, p.30</ref>\n\nHe entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1857. He was called to the [[Bar Council of Ireland|Irish Bar]] in 1860 and to the [[Barristers in England and Wales|English Bar]] the following year. He went on the [[Munster]] Circuit, where he quickly acquired a large practice. He was a fine lawyer and an eloquent public  speaker. [[Maurice Healy (writer)|Maurice Healy]] recalled his \"beautiful voice\", which  was sometimes compared  to that of the great Russian singer [[Feodor Chaliapin]]: this, combined with a certain natural acting ability, made his arguments extraordinarily persuasive.\n\nHis  Courtroom victories included the [[libel]] action ''O'Keeffe v Cardinal Cullen'', an unprecedented legal victory by a [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Catholic priest]] against [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Paul Cullen (cardinal)|Paul Cullen]] (although the verdict was reversed on appeal).<ref>(1873) I.R. 7 C.L. 319; the alleged libel was in fact a sentence of suspension.</ref>\n\nAnother  triumph  was in the disputed [[Will (law)|will]] case  of ''Bagot v Bagot'', where he appeared for Mrs. Alice Bagot (ne Verner), daughter of [[Sir William Verner, 2nd Baronet]] and Mary Pakenham, and  widow of Christopher  Nevile Bagot,  of Aughrane Castle,  [[Justice of the Peace]] for [[County Galway]]. Her husband had denied [[paternity (law)|paternity]] of her son, William,  and [[inheritance|disinherited]]  him in favour  \nof Christopher's brother John. Fitzgibbon's eloquence, in the teeth of formidable medical evidence on the paternity issue  produced by  John Bagot, who was  the [[beneficiary]]  under  his brother's will,  persuaded the jury that  Christopher Bagot was under a temporary mental delusion when he wrote his will, and that the child was his.<ref>''[[The Spectator]] Archive'' 25 May 1878</ref>\n\nHaving initially declined to take silk in 1868, he became [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1872.<ref>Fitzgerald p.30</ref> He was a Bencher of the [[King's Inns]], and his portrait hangs in the Dining Hall there.\n\nIn 1876 he became [[Law Adviser to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], and the following year he became [[Solicitor General for Ireland]].<ref>Ball p.372</ref>\n\n==Lord Justice of Appeal==\nIn 1878 he was appointed to the Bench as [[Lord Justice]] of the [[Court of Appeal in Ireland]], with the general approval of the  legal profession and the Press, who praised both his political moderation and his legal ability. He  served on that Court with immense distinction for more than thirty years.\n\n===Reputation===\nThe old Court of Appeal  has been  described as  probably the strongest judicial tribunal ever to exist in Ireland, due to the presence of such exceptional judges as Fitzgibbon himself, [[Hugh Holmes]], [[Christopher Palles]] and [[Edward Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne|Lord Ashbourne]].  While Palles is usually regarded as the greatest of the  Irish judges of his time, some contemporaries thought that FitzGibbon was at least his equal: it is noteworthy that when the [[House of Lords]] heard  appeals from  decisions where FitzGibbon had dissented, they almost always preferred his view to that of his colleagues.<ref>Fitzgerald p.30</ref>\n\nMaurice Healy believed that FitzGibbon as a judge fell short of true greatness due to a certain lack of judicial impartiality, in that if he had a strong sympathy for one party to the appeal, he always found a way of deciding  the case  in their favour.<ref>Maurice Healy, ''The Old Munster Circuit'' (1939), Mecier Press edition, pp. 260\u20131</ref> On the other hand, Healy thought that the courtesy with which he conducted every appeal, and the deep interest he took in the legal arguments, made appearing in front of him \"an intellectual treat\".<ref>Healy p.260</ref> Delaney praises Fitzgibbon  both for his profound erudition and his innate sense of justice.<ref>V.T.H. Delaney, ''Christopher Palles'',  Allen Figgis and Co Dublin (1960) p.138</ref> However he  agrees with Healy that FitzGibbon, like Lord Ashbourne, was a pragmatist, who would always try to find in favour of the party he believed to have justice on their side, even if the precedents  pointed  the other way. Palles and Holmes, by contrast, although they were no less anxious to do justice between the parties, went strictly by the precedents.<ref>Delaney p.158</ref>\n\n===''Quinn v Leathem''===\nFitzgibbon went regularly on [[assizes]], most often to Belfast. It was there in 1896 that he sat as the trial judge, with a jury, in the controversial case of ''[[Quinn v Leathem]]''.<ref>[1901] A.C 495</ref> The House of Lords subsequently found that for several members of a [[trade union]] to ask a businessman only to deal with customers who employ union labour amounts to a [[conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]] to injure him, even though such a request, when made by an individual, had previously been found by the same tribunal in ''[[Allen v Flood]]''<ref>[1898] A.C. 1</ref> to be perfectly lawful. While the judgment on appeal aroused great indignation among trade unions, FitzGibbon, from the report of his summing up to the jury, seems to have stated the law (as it stood at the time) correctly.\n\n===Judicial style===\nHis judgments were written in a clear, sharp and decisive style, often with an abrupt opening sentence such as:  \"I doubt that the [Court of]  King's Bench can have been conscious of the consequences of its decision in this case\".<ref>''Antrim County Land, Building and Investment Co. v Stewart'' [1904] 2 I.R 357</ref>\n\nA good example of his judicial style can be found in  ''Aaron's Reefs v Twiss'',<ref>[1895] 2 1R 207</ref> where the Court of Appeal were divided on the question of whether certain statements in a company's [[prospectus (finance)|prospectus]] were simply \"optimistic\" or actually [[fraudulent]]. FitzGibbon found that there is no legal difference between a company which omits crucial facts from its prospectus and one which deliberately misrepresents the facts, remarking that:  \"if a company cannot be floated if the whole truth be disclosed by its prospectus, it cannot be honestly launched at all\". To the argument that the application of this standard of commercial honesty would be fatal to most company prospectuses, he observed drily: \"So much the better\".<ref>[1895] 2 IR 207, at 269</ref>\n\n==Political and social life==\nHe was a  Conservative in politics, and a close friend of [[Lord Randolph Churchill]];<ref>Roy Jenkins, ''Churchill''  Macmillan London 2001, p.13</ref> it was in a letter to FitzGibbon in 1886 that Churchill remarked that to effectively oppose the support of [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]  for  [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish Home Rule]], \"the [[Orange Order|Orange]] card would be the one to play\".<ref>Kenneth Ferguson, ''King's Inns Barristers 1868\u20132004'', Dublin 2005 p.48</ref> Yet FitzGibbon  was noted for his political moderation: he had a wide circle of friends of differing political views, and his daughter Anne married a close relative of Gladstone. His house, Kilrock,<ref>Kilrock House still exists and is now operated by the Health Services Executive.</ref> on the Hill of [[Howth]], was one of the centres of Dublin social life: here he entertained not only his legal colleagues, but many of the leading Irish and  British politicians of the day.<ref>Ferguson p.48</ref> His Christmas parties at Kilrock were for many years one of the high points of the Dublin  social calendar.<ref>Ball p.322</ref>\n\nHe was a man of great erudition, and had numerous interests outside the law. He was a devoted member of the [[Church of Ireland]], and spoke eloquently in 1904 of his confidence in the future of \"the Church which I love\".<ref>Ferguson p.47</ref> He was a member of the [[General Synod]] of the Church: he was called the most influential  Protestant laymen of his time, and was rewarded with a statue in St. Patrick's Cathedral.<ref>Ferguson p.47</ref> At the same time he was an active [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], and contributed much of his time and money to Masonic causes and charities.<ref>Fitzgerald p.31</ref>\n\nHe took a deep interest in  the future of Irish education, and  chaired a committee on educational endowments from 1885 to 1897. He gave evidence to the Royal Commission on the future of Trinity College Dublin, and the [[University of Dublin]] in 1906.<ref>Delaney p.23</ref> He strongly defended the University's policy on the admission of [[Irish Catholic|Catholics]], pointing out that Chief Baron Palles - one of his most distinguished colleagues on the Bench - was a Catholic graduate of the same University, and shared FitzGibbon's deep attachment to it.<ref>Delaney p.23</ref> He generously praised [[Clongowes Wood College]], Palles' old school, as an example of the best of Roman Catholic education.<ref>Delaney p.23</ref>\n\nHe was a member of both the [[Privy Council of Ireland]] and from 1900 of the [[British Privy Council]].<ref>Ball p.372</ref>\n\n==Death and tributes==\nHe died rather suddenly at Kilrock on 14 October 1909. The next day the [[Lord Chief Justice of England]] in open court paid tribute to \"that great judge, profound lawyer and man of wide and varied learning\". This is apparently the only time an Irish judge has been honoured in this way.<ref>Fitzgerald p.31</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' paid him an equally glowing tribute, describing him as a man whose gifts could have easily seen him rise to the top of the political rather than the judicial sphere.\n\nHe is buried in old [[St. Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton]], near the ruined church.
