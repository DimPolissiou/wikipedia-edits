Not until 1920, when isolationist sentiments turned many voters against the party of [[Woodrow Wilson]], did Hamilton County vote Republican, and [[Herbert Hoover]] was to carry the county in 1928 due to anti-Catholic sentiment against [[Al Smith]].\n\nFrom 1940 onwards, when [[Wendell Willkie]] carried the county due to opposition to involvement in [[World War II]], Hamilton has become increasingly Republican. Although [[Lyndon Johnson]], [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1976 and [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992 all gained absolute majorities for the Democratic Party, since 1992, as with all traditionally Democratic parts of the [[Upland South]], a very rapid swing to the Republicans has taken place due to overwhelming local opposition to the Democratic Party's liberal views on social issues.<ref>Cohn, Nate; [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/upshot/southern-whites-loyalty-to-gop-nearing-that-of-blacks-to-democrats.html \u2018Demographic Shift: Southern Whites\u2019 Loyalty to G.O.P.

Not until 1920, when isolationist sentiments turned many voters against the party of [[Woodrow Wilson]], did Hamilton County vote Republican, and [[Herbert Hoover]] was to carry the county in 1928 due to anti-Catholic sentiment against [[Al Smith]].\n\nFrom 1940 onwards, when [[Wendell Willkie]] carried the county due to opposition to involvement in [[World War II]], Hamilton has become increasingly Republican. Although [[Lyndon Johnson]], [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1976 and [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992 all gained absolute majorities for the Democratic Party, since 1992, as with all traditionally Democratic parts of the [[Upland South]], a very rapid swing to the Republicans has taken place due to overwhelming local opposition to the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal views on social issues.<ref>Cohn, Nate; [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/upshot/southern-whites-loyalty-to-gop-nearing-that-of-blacks-to-democrats.html \u2018Demographic Shift: Southern Whites\u2019 Loyalty to G.O.P.

People who lived in these areas tended to be settled rather than nomadic. The region is fertile and well-watered, leading to an abundance of wildlife, and no need to travel far for food.  Physical remains such as the weirs and fish traps found in [[Lake Condah]] to the south of Hamilton, as well as accounts of early white settlers support local indigenous oral histories of well-established settlements in the area.\n\n===European settlement===\nOn 12 September 1836, the explorer, [[Major Thomas Mitchell]] was the first European to travel through the area where Hamilton later developed.  His reports of the fertility and abundance of \u2018[[Australia Felix]]\u2019 (as he called this region of Western Victoria) encouraged [[pastoralism|pastoralist]]s to move to the area and establish large sheep runs.  By 1839 there were a number of squatters in the area including the Wedge family whose property \u2018The Grange' was located within the present town site. \n\nThere was significant conflict between the Europeans and Aboriginal tribes at the time, over such things as resource and claims over land. \n\nDuring the early 1840s brothers Henry and [[Charles Wedge]], local squatters and servants participated in at least three revenge attacks for the killing of Patrick Codd (an employee on The Grange) and the stealing of sheep from their sheep run. The reprisals resulting in many deaths of [[Jardwadjali]] or [[Djab wurrung]] Aboriginals. The Grange's home station hut and store was infamously protected by a small mounted swivel gun. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Scars in the landscape : a register of massacre sites in western Victoria, 1803-1859|last=Clark, Ian D.|date=1995|publisher=Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|isbn=0855752815|location=Canberra|oclc=41539940}}</ref>\n\nThe \"frequent collisions\" compelling squatters of the area to request protection from the Government. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article65350742|title=[COPYRIGHT.]|date=21 March 1890|newspaper=[[Bathurst Free Press and Mining Journal]]|accessdate=9 November 2019|location=New South Wales, Australia|page=4|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn 1843 temporary protection came from 17 troopers, including Captain [[Henry Dana]] and the native police, [[Foster Fyans]], James Blair (police magistrate from Portland).

The township of Hamilton was formally declared in 1851. The town was named in the following way as quoted by the book, \"Dundas Shire Centenary 1863-1963\", page 58. Quote: \"In 1840, owing to police difficulties in controlling public houses on, or not on the imaginary boundary line, Henry Wade was sent from Sydney on a special mission to mark out the boundary. He completed the survey as far as Serviceton by the spring of 1847, and was then appointed District Surveyor and in 1850, laid out a township for the Grange, which he named Hamilton. It was then the prerogative of the surveyor to christen his lay-out. Wade and his family had made close friends of the Hamiltons and Gibsons of Bringalbert, there being intermarriages later.\" Unquote.\n\nThe railway reached the town in 1877, along with the [[Hamilton railway station, Victoria|local railway station]] which later became a hub of several branch lines.<ref name=jungways>{{Citation | author = Alan Jungwirth and Keith Lambert | isbn = 0-646-30010-5 | title = Weekly notice extracts 1894-1994 | year = 1996 | publisher = Weekly Notice Productions | page = 150}}</ref>\n\n== Heritage listings ==\nHamilton contains a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* 43 Gray Street: [[Hamilton Mechanics Institute]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/1637 | title=Mechanics Institute | publisher=Victorian Heritage Council | work=Victorian Heritage Database (Victorian Heritage Register) | accessdate=10 March 2019}}</ref>\n* 57 Gray Street: [[Hamilton Post Office]]<ref name=ahd-106135>{{cite AHD|106135|Hamilton Post Office|fn=2/02/131/0039|accessdate=9 March 2019}}</ref>\n* Kennedy, Martin, French and Thompson Streets: [[Hamilton Botanic Gardens]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/1871 | title=Hamilton Botanic Gardens | publisher=Victorian Heritage Council | work=Victorian Heritage Database (Victorian Heritage Register) | accessdate=10 March 2019}}</ref>\n* 14 Tyers Street: [[Hamilton Tuberculosis Chalet]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/3718 | title=Former Hamilton Tuberculosis Chalet | publisher=Victorian Heritage Council | work=Victorian Heritage Database (Victorian Heritage Register) | accessdate=10 March 2019}}</ref>\n* 2-16 Craig Street: [[Hamilton Gas Holder]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/4658 | title=Hamilton Gas Holder | publisher=Victorian Heritage Council | work=Victorian Heritage Database (Victorian Heritage Register) | accessdate=10 March 2019}}</ref>\n* 34 Thompson Street: [[Napier Club]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/4660 | title=Napier Club | publisher=Victorian Heritage Council | work=Victorian Heritage Database (Victorian Heritage Register) | accessdate=10 March 2019}}</ref>\n* 429 Henty Highway: [[Hamilton Racecourse Grandstand]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/14252 | title=Hamilton Racecourse Grandstand | publisher=Victorian Heritage Council | work=Victorian Heritage Database (Victorian Heritage Register) | accessdate=10 March 2019}}</ref>\n* 70 Rogers Road: [[Correagh]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/29871 | title=Correagh | publisher=Victorian Heritage Council | work=Victorian Heritage Database (Victorian Heritage Register) | accessdate=10 March 2019}}</ref>\n* Kent Road and Macarthur Street: [[Myrniong, Hamilton|Myrniong]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/4661 | title=Myrniong | publisher=Victorian Heritage Council | work=Victorian Heritage Database (Victorian Heritage Register) | accessdate=10 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Industry and employment==\nSheep grazing and agriculture are the primary industries in the surrounding shire, the area producing as much as 15% of Australia's total wool clip.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dvc.vic.gov.au/web20/dvclgv.nsf/AllDocs/E2778992BC7B75ACCA25716100824923 |title=Shire of Southern Grampians Council- Department of Planning and Community Development<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2006-09-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902123629/http://www.dvc.vic.gov.au/web20/dvclgv.nsf/AllDocs/E2778992BC7B75ACCA25716100824923 |archive-date=2006-09-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>   Inside the city of Hamilton the majority of employment is provided by the retail industry (20%) and the Health and Community Services sector (14.5%).

Set in {{convert|4|acres|ha}}, the gardens are distinguished by rare botanic species, a superbly restored rotunda, a small zoo featuring rabbits, [[cockatiels]] and [[budgerigars]] and playground and the ornate Thomson Fountain. The [[National Trust of Australia]] classified the gardens in 1990 with eight tree species listed on the Register of Significant Trees in Victoria.\n\n'''Hamilton Gallery''' Established in 1961, Hamilton Gallery's renowned collection features a decorative arts focus (well over half of its collection) of both Australian and International objects from the 17th century through to the present. Asian art and Australian paintings and prints are strongly represented but the Gallery is perhaps most well known for its rare collection of gouache and watercolour pictures by English landscape painter [[Paul Sandby]] (1731-1809).\n\n'''Sheepvention''', a wool-related trade-show and exhibition is held in the Hamilton Show-grounds in the first Monday & Tuesday of August each year, and attracts up to 20,000 visitors.  It has a similar feel to an [[Agricultural show]] but is focused on wool and sheep.  The Hamilton Agricultural Show is normally held in November.\n\n'''The Big Wool Bales''' was an attraction (now closed) consisting of five linked structures designed to resemble five gigantic woolbales - a tribute to the importance of the local wool industry. Together they formed a building and a cafe containing wool-related displays such as historical memorabilia, including farming and shearing equipment, wool scales, old horse harnesses, wool presses and weaving looms, along with wool samples and rural clothing.\n\n'''The Keeping Place''' is a small museum and living history centre run by local indigenous people.\n\n'''The Sir Reginald Ansett Transport Museum''' celebrates the founding of [[Ansett Australia]] in Hamilton in 1935 and displays items from the early days of the Ansett Airlines' operation.\n\n==Sport==\nThere are many sporting clubs and leagues in the Hamilton area.

People who lived in these areas tended to be settled rather than nomadic. The region is fertile and well-watered, leading to an abundance of wildlife, and no need to travel far for food.  Physical remains such as the weirs and fish traps found in [[Lake Condah]] to the south of Hamilton, as well as accounts of early white settlers support local indigenous oral histories of well-established settlements in the area.\n\n===European settlement===\nOn 12 September 1836, the explorer, [[Major Thomas Mitchell]] was the first European to travel through the area where Hamilton later developed.  His reports of the fertility and abundance of \u2018[[Australia Felix]]\u2019 (as he called this region of Western Victoria) encouraged [[pastoralism|pastoralist]]s to move to the area and establish large sheep runs.  By 1839 there were a number of squatters in the area including the Wedge family whose property \u2018The Grange' was located within the present town site. \n\nThere was significant conflict between the Europeans and Aboriginal tribes at the time, over such things as resource and claims over land. \n\nDuring the early 1840s brothers Henry and [[Charles Wedge]], local squatters and servants participated in at least three revenge attacks for the killing of Patrick Codd (an employee on The Grange) and the stealing of sheep from their sheep run. The reprisals resulting in many deaths of [[Jardwadjali]] or [[Djab wurrung]] Aboriginals. The Grange's home station hut and store was infamously protected by a small mounted swivel gun. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Scars in the landscape : a register of massacre sites in western Victoria, 1803-1859|last=Clark, Ian D.|date=1995|publisher=Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|isbn=0855752815|location=Canberra|oclc=41539940}}</ref>\n\nThe \"frequent collisions\" compelling squatters of the area to request protection from the Government. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article65350742|title=[COPYRIGHT.]|date=21 March 1890|newspaper=[[Bathurst Free Press and Mining Journal]]|accessdate=9 November 2019|location=New South Wales, Australia|page=4|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn 1843 temporary protection came from 17 troopers, including Captain [[Henry Dana]] and the native police, [[Foster Fyans]], James Blair (police magistrate from Portland).

The township of Hamilton was formally declared in 1851. The town was named in the following way as quoted by the book, \"Dundas Shire Centenary 1863-1963\", page 58. Quote: \"In 1840, owing to police difficulties in controlling public houses on, or not on the imaginary boundary line, Henry Wade was sent from Sydney on a special mission to mark out the boundary. He completed the survey as far as Serviceton by the spring of 1847, and was then appointed District Surveyor and in 1850, laid out a township for the Grange, which he named Hamilton. It was then the prerogative of the surveyor to christen his lay-out.

On average Hamilton  has 105 days per year with more than 1 mm of rain with a  marked minimum during Summer.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Hamilton Airport (Victoria)|Hamilton Airport]]\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan record high C = 44.0\n|Feb record high C = 44.5\n|Mar record high C = 39.6\n|Apr record high C = 33.7\n|May record high C = 27.0\t\n|Jun record high C = 22.0\t\n|Jul record high C = 18.7\t\n|Aug record high C = 22.6\t\n|Sep record high C = 28.0\t\n|Oct record high C = 34.0\n|Nov record high C = 38.1\n|Dec record high C = 43.3\t\n|year record high C = 44.5\n|Jan high C = 26.7\t\n|Feb high C = 26.8\n|Mar high C = 24.2\n|Apr high C = 19.9\n|May high C = 15.7\n|Jun high C = 12.9\n|Jul high C = 12.1\n|Aug high C = 13.3\n|Sep high C = 15.2\n|Oct high C = 18.0\n|Nov high C =  21.1\n|Dec high C = 24.2\n|year high C = 19.2\n|Jan low C = 11.2\n|Feb low C = 11.4\n|Mar low C = 10.4\n|Apr low C = 8.4\t\n|May low C = 6.7\t\n|Jun low C = 5.0\t\n|Jul low C = 4.4\n|Aug low C = 4.8\t\n|Sep low C = 5.8\n|Oct low C = 6.6\n|Nov low C = 8.2\t\n|Dec low C = 9.6\n|year low C = 7.7\t\n|Jan record low C = 1.5\t\n|Feb record low C = 2.1\t\n|Mar record low C = 1.5\n|Apr record low C = -0.5\n|May record low C = -1.5\t\n|Jun record low C = -3.8\t\t\n|Jul record low C = -2.8\t\n|Aug record low C = -3.6\t\n|Sep record low C = -3.5\t\n|Oct record low C = -0.7\n|Nov record low C = -0.1\n|Dec record low C = 0.0\n|year record low C = -3.8\n|Jan precipitation mm = 32.9\n|Feb precipitation mm = 23.3\n|Mar precipitation mm = 34.2\t\n|Apr precipitation mm = 39.8\n|May precipitation mm = 53.8\t\n|Jun precipitation mm = 65.8\n|Jul precipitation mm = 71.1\t\n|Aug precipitation mm = 77.9\t\n|Sep precipitation mm = 67.1\t\n|Oct precipitation mm = 54.3\n|Nov precipitation mm = 47.5\n|Dec precipitation mm = 44.2\t\n|year precipitation mm = 617.3\n|Jan precipitation days = 4.7\n|Feb precipitation days = 3.7\n|Mar precipitation days = 5.1\n|Apr precipitation days = 6.7\n|May precipitation days = 9.9\n|Jun precipitation days = 11.6\n|Jul precipitation days = 13.7\n|Aug precipitation days = 14.4\n|Sep precipitation days = 11.7\n|Oct precipitation days = 9.7\n|Nov precipitation days = 7.5\t\n|Dec precipitation days = 6.7\n|year precipitation days = 105.4 \t\n|source 1 = <ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_090173.shtml\n| publisher = Bureau of Meteorology |title = Climate statistics for  |accessdate = 3 December 2019}}</ref>\n|date=January 2019\n}}\n\n==Media==\n\n===Newspaper===\nHamilton and the surrounding areas is serviced by ''The [[Hamilton Spectator (Aus)|Hamilton Spectator]]'', a tri-weekly local newspaper published by the Spectator Observer newspaper group. Established in 1859 as the Hamilton Courier, it became the Hamilton Spectator and Grange District Advertiser in 1860, and later The Hamilton Spectator.\n\n===Radio===\nThere are two radio stations based in Hamilton:\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080525103019/http://theradio.com.au/localworks.aspx?PageID=6223&Station=3HA_Hamilton 3HA]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080525103002/http://theradio.com.au/hitmusic.aspx?PageID=6710&Station=Mixx_FM_Hamilton Mixx FM]\n\nBoth are owned by the [[Ace Radio]] network which operates radio stations in the Western District of Victoria.\n\nSeveral other radio stations broadcast into Hamilton, including national broadcasters such as the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] and regional stations based in nearby towns in Western Victoria such as [[Warrnambool, Victoria|Warrnambool]], [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]] and [[Ballarat]].\n\n==Attractions and events==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Hamilton Botanic Garden Gates.JPG|thumb|The gates to the Hamilton Botanical Gardens]]\n[[File:The Big Woolbales at Hamilton (2012).jpg|thumb|The Big Wool Bales, a former tourist attraction]]\nIn 1881 [[William Guilfoyle]], the director of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne]] was employed to design the '''Hamilton Botanic Gardens'''. Set in {{convert|4|acres|ha}}, the gardens are distinguished by rare botanic species, a superbly restored rotunda, a small zoo featuring rabbits, [[cockatiels]] and [[budgerigars]] and playground and the ornate Thomson Fountain. The [[National Trust of Australia]] classified the gardens in 1990 with eight tree species listed on the Register of Significant Trees in Victoria.\n\n'''Hamilton Gallery''' Established in 1961, Hamilton Gallery\u2019s renowned collection features a decorative arts focus (well over half of its collection) of both Australian and International objects from the 17th century through to the present. Asian art and Australian paintings and prints are strongly represented but the Gallery is perhaps most well known for its rare collection of gouache and watercolour pictures by English landscape painter [[Paul Sandby]] (1731-1809).\n\n'''Sheepvention''', a wool-related trade-show and exhibition is held in the Hamilton Show-grounds in the first Monday & Tuesday of August each year, and attracts up to 20,000 visitors.  It has a similar feel to an [[Agricultural show]] but is focused on wool and sheep.  The Hamilton Agricultural Show is normally held in November.\n\n'''The Big Wool Bales''' was an attraction (now closed) consisting of five linked structures designed to resemble five gigantic woolbales - a tribute to the importance of the local wool industry. Together they formed a building and a cafe containing wool-related displays such as historical memorabilia, including farming and shearing equipment, wool scales, old horse harnesses, wool presses and weaving looms, along with wool samples and rural clothing.\n\n'''The Keeping Place''' is a small museum and living history centre run by local indigenous people.\n\n'''The Sir Reginald Ansett Transport Museum''' celebrates the founding of [[Ansett Australia]] in Hamilton in 1935 and displays items from the early days of the Ansett Airlines' operation.\n\n==Sport==\nThere are many sporting clubs and leagues in the Hamilton area. The town is served by one [[Australian rules football]] team; Hamilton Kangaroos . This team competes in the [[Hampden Football League]]. \nThe town formerly had 2 teams, Hamilton Magpies and Hamilton Imperials, which played in the [[Western Border Football League]]. The teams agreed to merge at the end of the 2012 season in order to make the move to the [[Hampden Football League]].\n\n[[Netball]], [[field hockey]], [[basketball]], [http://hamiltonsoccerclubvic.com soccer], [[tennis]] and [[cricket]] are other popular sports in the town. Hamilton opened a large Indoor Sports and Aquatic Centre in March 2006, which contains four basketball courts, a twenty-five-metre indoor [[swimming pool]], 4  squash courts, a table tennis centre with 8 courts and a large [[gym]]. The city is also the home of the  Hamilton Rowing Club (HRC) who compete in Rowing Victoria regattas during the summer. The Hamilton and Alexandra College Rowing Club (HACRC) sometimes compete in such events or attempt to train. Tucked behind the Historical Society in Gray Street, is the Hamilton 8-Ball and Snooker Club.\n\nHamilton has a [[Thoroughbred racing in Australia|horse racing club]], the Hamilton Racing Club, which schedules around nine race meetings a year including the Hamilton Cup meeting in April.<ref name=\"RaceClub\">{{Citation | last = Country Racing Victoria | title = Hamilton Racing Club | url = http://www.countryracing.com.au/clubs/hamilton/ | accessdate = 2010-11-21 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101031190646/http://countryracing.com.au/clubs/hamilton/ | archivedate = 2010-10-31 }}</ref> As well as a harness racing club which has recently opened a new track, with state-of-the-art facilities.\n \nGolfers play at the Hamilton Golf Club<ref name = \"golf2\">{{Citation  | author= Golf Select | title = Hamilton | url = http://www.golfselect.com.au/armchair/courseView.aspx?course_id=983 | accessdate = 2009-05-11 }}</ref> or at the more minor course Parklands on Boundary and Hensley Park Roads.<ref name = \"golf\">{{Citation  | author= Golf Select | title = Parklands | url = http://www.golfselect.com.au/armchair/courseView.aspx?course_id=1061 | accessdate = 2009-05-11 }}</ref>\n\n== Wildlife and parks ==\nThe [[eastern barred bandicoot]] is native to the area, and a reserve has been built to protect the [[endangered species]]. In more recent times (2007), the numbers both within the reserve and without have been severely diminished to the point of near extinction as a result of extended drought.  Within the city the public lands adjoining the river and Lake Hamilton have been subject to spasmodic tree-planting projects.\n\n[[Mount Napier]] the highest point on the Western District Plains is found {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of Hamilton.\n\n==Education==\nPrimary schools in Hamilton include Hamilton (Gray Street) Primary School, George Street Primary School, Hamilton North Primary School and Saint Mary's Primary School.  Secondary schools include Hamilton & Alexandra College, Monivae College and Baimbridge College. There are two Primary to Year 12 schools: The Hamilton and Alexandra College and Good Shepherd College.\n\nHamilton Special School caters to primary school-age students who have special education needs, predominantly autistic spectrum disorders and communication difficulties.\n\n[[South West TAFE|South West Institute of Technical and Further Education]] (TAFE) has a campus in Hamilton, offering post-secondary and trade courses and qualifications.\n\n[[RMIT]] maintains a training and research site 4&nbsp;km from the centre of Hamilton,<ref name=\"RMITHamilton\">[http://www.rmit.edu.au/about/our-locations-and-facilities/locations/regional-sites/hamilton Hamilton].

The colony's capital relocated to Hamilton from [[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's]] in 1815. The city has been at the political and military heart of Bermuda ever since. Government buildings include the parliament building, the Government House to the north, the former Admiralty House of the [[Royal Navy]] to the west (both in Pembroke), and the [[British Army]] [[Bermuda Garrison|garrison]] headquarters at [[Prospect Camp, Bermuda|Prospect Camp]] to its east.\n\nThe Town of Hamilton became a city in 1897, ahead of the consecration in 1911 of the [[Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, Bermuda|Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity]] (Church of England), which was under construction at the time. A Catholic cathedral, [[Cathedral of Saint Theresa of Lisieux|St. Theresa's]], was later constructed. Today, the city overlooking Hamilton Harbour is primarily a business district, with few structures other than office buildings and shops. The City of Hamilton has long maintained a building height and view limit, which states that no buildings may obscure the Cathedral. In the 21st century, buildings have been planned and some are under construction that are as high as ten storeys in the area.

The city is named after [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Sir Henry Hamilton]], governor of the territory from 1786 to 1793. Hamilton Parish antedates the city.\n\nThe administrative capital of Bermuda, Hamilton, has a limited permanent population around 854 (2016); however in 2010, 13,340 (40% of Bermuda's working population) worked here on a daily basis. The only incorporated city in Bermuda, Hamilton is smaller than the historic town of [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]]. A more representative measure of Bermuda's local residential populations tends to be by parish.\n\n==Economy==\nAs the offshore domicile of many foreign companies, Bermuda has a highly developed international business economy; it is an exporter of financial services, primarily insurance, reinsurance, investment funds, and [[Special purpose entity|special-purpose vehicles]]. Finance and international business constitute the largest sector of Bermuda's economy, and virtually all of this business takes place within the borders of Hamilton.\n\nNumerous leading international insurance companies are based in Hamilton, as it is a global reinsurance centre{{Clarify|reason=|date=May 2018}}. Around 400 internationally owned and operated businesses are physically based in Bermuda, and many are represented by the Association of Bermuda International Companies. In total, over 1,500 exempted or international companies are currently registered with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda.\n\nThe city is the registered headquarters of the spirits manufacturer [[Bacardi]], semiconductor manufacturer [[Marvell Technology]], outsourcing company [[Genpact]], telecommunications company [[Global Crossing]], and reinsurance company [[Tokio Millennium Re Ltd]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Bermuda Move Allows Insurers To Avoid Taxes |date= 6 March 2000 |author= David Cay Johnston and Joseph B.

This shield is supported by a mermaid and heraldic sea horse (i.e., demi-horse, demi-fish), and is placed on a mount in front of which is a scroll containing the motto \"Sparsa Collegit\". The shield is topped by a crest featuring a closed helm topped with a torque above which an heraldic seahorse is emerging from the sea holding a flower.<ref name=\"FOTW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/bm-hm-hm.html|title=City of Hamilton (Bermuda)|work=crwflags.com}}</ref> The city's full motto is  ''Hamilton sparsa collegit'', (\"Hamilton has assembled the scattered\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bermuda-online.org/seecity.htm|title=Bermuda's City of Hamilton|work=bermuda-online.org}}</ref>\n\nThe city's flag is a [[banner of arms]], featuring the same details as on the shield of the city's coat of arms, but with the flowers in white rather than gold.<ref name=\"FOTW\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Parks==\nThe city of Hamilton has many parks for its size. Probably the most notable park in the city is Victoria Park. This park occupies a whole block and was named after [[Queen Victoria]]. Other parks in the city are Par La Ville Park, Barr's Park, All Buoy's Point Park, and the hidden Cedar Park.\n\n{{wide image|Hamilton, Bermuda 1911b.jpg|950px|Panorama of Hamilton, 1911. View from Fort Hamilton.}}\n{{wide image|Hamilton, Bermuda Panorama.jpg|950px|Panorama of Hamilton, 2007. Same vantage.}}\n\n==Climate==\nAlthough located some distance north of the geographic tropics, Hamilton has a warm trade-wind [[tropical rainforest climate]] bordering on [[humid subtropical climate]]. It is warm enough for coconut palms and other tropical palms to grow, although they may not fruit properly due to the lack of heat or sunshine during the winter months because of latitude. Hamilton has uncharacteristically warm temperatures for its latitude (32\u00b0N) because of the moderating influence of the North Atlantic and nearby [[Gulf Stream]]. Hamilton features warm and humid summers and semi-warm \"winters\". As temperatures are moderated by the Atlantic Ocean, it rarely gets very hot or cold in the city. Precipitation is plentiful throughout the year and Hamilton does not have a [[dry season]] month, a month where on average less than {{convert|60|mm|2|abbr=on}} of precipitation falls. Summer precipitation is usually from showers, thunderstorms, and tropical disturbances or even [[tropical cyclones]]. Meanwhile, winter precipitation is typically derived from westerly moving extra-tropical cyclones and their associated fronts. Erratic, extended dry spells occasionally develop because of variations in the semi-permanent sub-tropical ridge locally known as the [[Bermuda-Azores High]].\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Hamilton, Bermuda ([[L.F.

The Argo Cup brings the world's best match-racing sailors (including world champions and Olympic sailors) to Bermuda for five days of one-on-one 'match racing'. Points accrued during the event contribute to the World Match Racing Tour and ultimately a chance to race in the final event, the [[Monsoon Cup]] in Malaysia. The winner of that is crowned ISAF World Match Racing Champion. Unlike many water-based sports, which occur too far out to view from shore, 'match racing' is a great spectator sport. The race takes place only 15m from the shore, and spectators can see the heart of the action.\n\nThe history of the modern Bermuda Gold Cup event dates back to the very beginning of the match racing style of sailing. The first '[[match race]]' in a one-design racing yacht, i.e. technically identical boats, was the [[King Edward VII Gold Cup]]<ref>[http://www.bermudagoldcup.com/content/view/3/5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519080149/http://www.bermudagoldcup.com/content/view/3/5|date=19 May 2010}}</ref> in Bermuda (now known as the Argo Gold Cup) that was first sailed in 1937. The Argo Gold Cup is still a key event in the World Match Racing Tour calendar.\n\nThe King Edward VII Cup itself was originally given at the Tri-Centenary Regatta at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], in 1907, by [[King Edward VII]] in commemoration of the 300th Anniversary of the first permanent settlement in America. C. Sherman Hoyt won that regatta, and was the first sailor to accept the historic trophy.\n\nHoyt held the Gold Cup for three decades before donating it to the [[Royal Bermuda Yacht Club]] and proposing an annual one-on-one match-race series in 6-Meter yachts.

It is the territory's financial centre and a major port and [[tourist destination]]. Its population of 854 (2016)<ref>{{cite web |title=2016 Population and Housing Census Report |url=https://www.gov.bm/sites/default/files/2016%20Census%20Report.pdf |publisher=Government of Bermuda, Department of Statistics |accessdate=11 March 2020}}</ref> is one of the smallest of any capital cities.\n\n==History==\n\nThe history of Hamilton as a British city began in 1790 when the government of Bermuda set aside {{convert|145|acre|ha}} for its future seat, officially incorporated in 1793 by an Act of Parliament, and named for [[Governor of Bermuda|Governor]] [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Henry Hamilton]]. The colony's capital relocated to Hamilton from [[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's]] in 1815. The city has been at the political and military heart of Bermuda ever since. Government buildings include the parliament building, the Government House to the north, the former Admiralty House of the [[Royal Navy]] to the west (both in Pembroke), and the [[British Army]] [[Bermuda Garrison|garrison]] headquarters at [[Prospect Camp, Bermuda|Prospect Camp]] to its east.\n\nThe Town of Hamilton became a city in 1897, ahead of the consecration in 1911 of the [[Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, Bermuda|Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity]] (Church of England), which was under construction at the time. A Catholic cathedral, [[Cathedral of Saint Theresa of Lisieux|St. Theresa's]], was later constructed. Today, the city overlooking Hamilton Harbour is primarily a business district, with few structures other than office buildings and shops. The City of Hamilton has long maintained a building height and view limit, which states that no buildings may obscure the Cathedral. In the 21st century, buildings have been planned and some are under construction that are as high as ten storeys in the area. Bermuda's local newspaper, ''[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]],'' reports, \"If you don't recognise the city, from 15 years ago, we don't blame you as it has changed so much\".{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:West_end_of_Hamilton_Warf.jpg|West end of Hamilton Wharf, 1857\nFile:Government_House,_Mount_Langton.jpg|Old [[Government House, Bermuda|Government House]], Mount Langton, 1857\nFile:039 Pitt's Bay, n\u00e4ra Hamilton.jpg|Pitt's Bay, 1895\nFile:City Hall in Hamilton, Bermuda.jpg|City Hall in Hamilton\nFile:Cathedral in Hamilton, Bermuda.jpg|The [[Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, Bermuda|Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity]] in Hamilton.\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\nHamilton is located on the north side of [[Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda|Hamilton Harbour]], and is Bermuda's main port. Although there is a parish of the [[Hamilton Parish, Bermuda|same name]], the city of Hamilton is in the parish of [[Pembroke Parish, Bermuda|Pembroke]]. The city is named after [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Sir Henry Hamilton]], governor of the territory from 1786 to 1793. Hamilton Parish antedates the city.\n\nThe administrative capital of Bermuda, Hamilton, has a limited permanent population around 854 (2016); however in 2010, 13,340 (40% of Bermuda's working population) worked here on a daily basis. The only incorporated city in Bermuda, Hamilton is smaller than the historic town of [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]]. A more representative measure of Bermuda's local residential populations tends to be by parish.\n\n==Economy==\nAs the offshore domicile of many foreign companies, Bermuda has a highly developed international business economy; it is an exporter of financial services, primarily insurance, reinsurance, investment funds, and [[Special purpose entity|special-purpose vehicles]]. Finance and international business constitute the largest sector of Bermuda's economy, and virtually all of this business takes place within the borders of Hamilton.\n\nNumerous leading international insurance companies are based in Hamilton, as it is a global reinsurance centre{{Clarify|reason=|date=May 2018}}. Around 400 internationally owned and operated businesses are physically based in Bermuda, and many are represented by the Association of Bermuda International Companies. In total, over 1,500 exempted or international companies are currently registered with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda.\n\nThe city is the registered headquarters of the spirits manufacturer [[Bacardi]], semiconductor manufacturer [[Marvell Technology]], outsourcing company [[Genpact]], telecommunications company [[Global Crossing]], and reinsurance company [[Tokio Millennium Re Ltd]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Bermuda Move Allows Insurers To Avoid Taxes |date= 6 March 2000 |author= David Cay Johnston and Joseph B.

This shield is supported by a mermaid and heraldic sea horse (i.e., demi-horse, demi-fish), and is placed on a mount in front of which is a scroll containing the motto \"Sparsa Collegit\". The shield is topped by a crest featuring a closed helm topped with a torque above which an heraldic seahorse is emerging from the sea holding a flower.<ref name=\"FOTW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/bm-hm-hm.html|title=City of Hamilton (Bermuda)|work=crwflags.com}}</ref> The city's full motto is  ''Hamilton sparsa collegit'', (\"Hamilton has assembled the scattered\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bermuda-online.org/seecity.htm|title=Bermuda's City of Hamilton|work=bermuda-online.org}}</ref>\n\nThe city's flag is a [[banner of arms]], featuring the same details as on the shield of the city's coat of arms, but with the flowers in white rather than gold.<ref name=\"FOTW\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Parks==\nThe city of Hamilton has many parks for its size. Probably the most notable park in the city is Victoria Park. This park occupies a whole block and was named after [[Queen Victoria]]. Other parks in the city are Par La Ville Park, Barr's Park, All Buoy's Point Park, and the hidden Cedar Park.\n\n{{wide image|Hamilton, Bermuda 1911b.jpg|950px|Panorama of Hamilton, 1911. View from Fort Hamilton.}}\n{{wide image|Hamilton, Bermuda Panorama.jpg|950px|Panorama of Hamilton, 2007. Same vantage.}}\n\n==Climate==\nAlthough located some distance north of the geographic tropics, Hamilton has a warm trade-wind [[tropical rainforest climate]] bordering on [[humid subtropical climate]]. It is warm enough for coconut palms and other tropical palms to grow, although they may not fruit properly due to the lack of heat or sunshine during the winter months because of latitude. Hamilton has uncharacteristically warm temperatures for its latitude (32\u00b0N) because of the moderating influence of the North Atlantic and nearby [[Gulf Stream]]. Hamilton features warm and humid summers and semi-warm \"winters\". As temperatures are moderated by the Atlantic Ocean, it rarely gets very hot or cold in the city. Precipitation is plentiful throughout the year and Hamilton does not have a [[dry season]] month, a month where on average less than {{convert|60|mm|2|abbr=on}} of precipitation falls. Summer precipitation is usually from showers, thunderstorms, and tropical disturbances or even [[tropical cyclones]]. Meanwhile, winter precipitation is typically derived from westerly moving extra-tropical cyclones and their associated fronts. Erratic, extended dry spells occasionally develop because of variations in the semi-permanent sub-tropical ridge locally known as the [[Bermuda-Azores High]].\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Hamilton, Bermuda ([[L.F.

The Argo Cup brings the world's best match-racing sailors (including world champions and Olympic sailors) to Bermuda for five days of one-on-one 'match racing'. Points accrued during the event contribute to the World Match Racing Tour and ultimately a chance to race in the final event, the [[Monsoon Cup]] in Malaysia. The winner of that is crowned ISAF World Match Racing Champion. Unlike many water-based sports, which occur too far out to view from shore, 'match racing' is a great spectator sport. The race takes place only 15m from the shore, and spectators can see the heart of the action.\n\nThe history of the modern Bermuda Gold Cup event dates back to the very beginning of the match racing style of sailing. The first '[[match race]]' in a one-design racing yacht, i.e. technically identical boats, was the [[King Edward VII Gold Cup]]<ref>[http://www.bermudagoldcup.com/content/view/3/5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519080149/http://www.bermudagoldcup.com/content/view/3/5|date=19 May 2010}}</ref> in Bermuda (now known as the Argo Gold Cup) that was first sailed in 1937. The Argo Gold Cup is still a key event in the World Match Racing Tour calendar.\n\nThe King Edward VII Cup itself was originally given at the Tri-Centenary Regatta at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], in 1907, by [[King Edward VII]] in commemoration of the 300th Anniversary of the first permanent settlement in America. C. Sherman Hoyt won that regatta, and was the first sailor to accept the historic trophy.\n\nHoyt held the Gold Cup for three decades before donating it to the [[Royal Bermuda Yacht Club]] and proposing an annual one-on-one match-race series in 6-Meter yachts. In his letter he expressed the propriety of \"my returning a British Royal trophy to the custody of your club, with its long record of clean sportsmanship and keenly contested races between your Bermuda yachts and ours of Long Island Sound, and elsewhere...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sailingnetworks.com/events/details/8398 |title=2009 Bermuda Gold Cup (King Edward VII Gold Cup) \u2013 Oct 2009 \u2013 The Calendar on Sailing Networks |publisher=Sailingnetworks.com |date=11 October 2009 |accessdate=5 November 2013}}</ref> The first winner of the Cup in its new format was [[Briggs Cunningham]] in 1937.

It is built upon lands that once served as  \"hunting grounds\" for the Chickasaw Indians. The city was first called '''Toll Gate''', but its name later changed in honor of one of its distinguished citizens, Captain Albert James Hamilton (known as A.J. Hamilton), who had represented Marion County in the state legislature in the sessions of 1869, 1874 and 1875. Captain Hamilton donated forty acres of his land to the town. The same forty acres were then divided into lots and sold to help defray the cost of building the courthouse.<ref>''The Heritage of Marion County, Alabama'', vol. 47, Clanton, Al. 2000, p. 275 {{ISBN|1-891647-28-8}}</ref>  The Toll Gate community was elected in 1881 to be the next county seat, and by 1883 the Marion county courthouse in Pikeville had ceased to be functional. When the courthouse was moved from [[Pikeville, Marion County, Alabama|Pikeville]] to Toll Gate, the town's name was then changed from Toll Gate to Hamilton. On March 30, 1887, the newly built county courthouse was destroyed by fire.<ref>Marion Herald April 5, 1887 pg 8</ref> It was again rebuilt with wood, but replaced in 1901 with native sandstone quarried from the State.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Union forces passed through the town in search of goods and horses. A detachment of Wilson's Cavalry destroyed by fire the plantation belonging to the Helvingstons on the Military Ford, south of Toll Gate (Hamilton).<ref>John M.

It is built upon lands that once served as  \"hunting grounds\" for the Chickasaw Indians. The city was first called '''Toll Gate''', but its name later changed in honor of one of its distinguished citizens, Captain Albert James Hamilton (known as A.J. Hamilton), who had represented Marion County in the state legislature in the sessions of 1869, 1874 and 1875. Captain Hamilton donated forty acres of his land to the town. The same forty acres were then divided into lots and sold to help defray the cost of building the courthouse.<ref>''The Heritage of Marion County, Alabama'', vol. 47, Clanton, Al. 2000, p. 275 {{ISBN|1-891647-28-8}}</ref>  The Toll Gate community was elected in 1881 to be the next county seat, and by 1883 the Marion county courthouse in Pikeville had ceased to be functional. When the courthouse was moved from [[Pikeville, Marion County, Alabama|Pikeville]] to Toll Gate, the town's name was then changed from Toll Gate to Hamilton. On March 30, 1887, the newly built county courthouse was destroyed by fire.<ref>Marion Herald April 5, 1887 pg 8</ref> It was again rebuilt with wood, but replaced in 1901 with native sandstone quarried from the State.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Union forces passed through the town in search of goods and horses. A detachment of Wilson's Cavalry destroyed by fire the plantation belonging to the Helvingstons on the Military Ford, south of Toll Gate (Hamilton).<ref>John M.

At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 84, which indicates \"universal acclaim\", based on 4 reviews.<ref name=\"metacritic1\"/> David Jeffries of [[AllMusic]] gave the album four out of five stars, saying \"If he mentioned an exciting mixing of Twista's speed, De La Soul's D.A.I.S.Y. Age attitude, and the modern swagger of the Tech N9ne-driven underground, that would be the headline review of this sophomore release, ''Legends Never Die'', which follows his debut, ''Die, Rugged Man, Die'', by eight-plus years. That's criminal, because when producers like Mr. Green, Apathy, and Buckwild come up with fresh, funky ideas, R.A. responds with excellence, and sometimes a J-Zone-sized sense of humor (check \"Luv to Fuck\" for Talib Kweli and Redd Foxx's genetics being spliced together, right before your ears).\"<ref name=\"allmusic1\"/> Khari Nixon of ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' gave the album a positive review, saying \"There\u2019s something to be said about an individual that is enjoying his 3rd decade as a member of this cutthroat industry, and can still make relevant music rivaling the most prevalent material that\u2019s currently out. And for those that don\u2019t think ''Legends Never Die'' rivals today\u2019s prevalent material, simply press play on track 3, the tightly-run lyrical battleship better known as \u201cDefinition Of A Rap Flow\u201d, and we dare you to imagine a verse out today that can compete with that on just about any level.\"<ref name=\"source\"/>\n\nDavid \"Rek\" Lee of [[HipHopDX]] gave the album four out of five stars, saying \"''Legends Never Die'' isn\u2019t a perfect album. The sequencing is a bit off at times, as it inexplicably jumps from aggressive, lyrical tracks to more subdued conscious records. Also, some of the production feels dated even for an \u201cunderground record.\u201d But overall, it\u2019s an album embedded with enough humor, knowledge, and obscure Hip Hop references (\u201cI\u2019m a whooligan like James Caan\u2019s son\u2026\u201d) that will force listeners to keep this one in rotation. R.A. the Rugged Man might not care about an industry exec or releasing music on a consistent basis, but his love for the art is undeniable because he\u2019s only getting better. The champ is here.\"<ref name=\"hhdx\"/> Grant Jones of RapReviews gave the album an eight out of ten, saying \"''Legends Never Die''\" is noticeably more intense lyrically, with RA adopting his multi-syllable style which shows influences of Big Pun. \"Definition of a Rap Flow\" is the perfect example of how refined RA is at his art. The only person I can think that may match him for breathless flow is Esoteric, or Pun himself. This relentless verbal assault follows on \"Media Midgets\" which carries on RA's hatred of the industry, critics and everything else in between.

At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 84, which indicates \"universal acclaim\", based on 4 reviews.<ref name=\"metacritic1\"/> David Jeffries of [[AllMusic]] gave the album four out of five stars, saying \"If he mentioned an exciting mixing of Twista's speed, De La Soul's D.A.I.S.Y. Age attitude, and the modern swagger of the Tech N9ne-driven underground, that would be the headline review of this sophomore release, ''Legends Never Die'', which follows his debut, ''Die, Rugged Man, Die'', by eight-plus years. That's criminal, because when producers like Mr. Green, Apathy, and Buckwild come up with fresh, funky ideas, R.A. responds with excellence, and sometimes a J-Zone-sized sense of humor (check \"Luv to Fuck\" for Talib Kweli and Redd Foxx's genetics being spliced together, right before your ears).\"<ref name=\"allmusic1\"/> Khari Nixon of ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' gave the album a positive review, saying \"There\u2019s something to be said about an individual that is enjoying his 3rd decade as a member of this cutthroat industry, and can still make relevant music rivaling the most prevalent material that\u2019s currently out. And for those that don\u2019t think ''Legends Never Die'' rivals today\u2019s prevalent material, simply press play on track 3, the tightly-run lyrical battleship better known as \u201cDefinition Of A Rap Flow\u201d, and we dare you to imagine a verse out today that can compete with that on just about any level.\"<ref name=\"source\"/>\n\nDavid \"Rek\" Lee of [[HipHopDX]] gave the album four out of five stars, saying \"''Legends Never Die'' isn\u2019t a perfect album. The sequencing is a bit off at times, as it inexplicably jumps from aggressive, lyrical tracks to more subdued conscious records. Also, some of the production feels dated even for an \u201cunderground record.\u201d But overall, it\u2019s an album embedded with enough humor, knowledge, and obscure Hip Hop references (\u201cI\u2019m a whooligan like James Caan\u2019s son\u2026\u201d) that will force listeners to keep this one in rotation. R.A. the Rugged Man might not care about an industry exec or releasing music on a consistent basis, but his love for the art is undeniable because he\u2019s only getting better. The champ is here.\"<ref name=\"hhdx\"/> Grant Jones of RapReviews gave the album an eight out of ten, saying \"''Legends Never Die''\" is noticeably more intense lyrically, with RA adopting his multi-syllable style which shows influences of Big Pun. \"Definition of a Rap Flow\" is the perfect example of how refined RA is at his art. The only person I can think that may match him for breathless flow is Esoteric, or Pun himself. This relentless verbal assault follows on \"Media Midgets\" which carries on RA's hatred of the industry, critics and everything else in between. This is a theme which understandably ran through \"''Die Rugged Man, Die''\" as it was his ten years-late debut, but having now established himself with regular work and clearly not toning his act down for radio, the anti-industry message seems redundant at times.\"<ref name=\"rapreviews1\"/> Sean Ryon of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' gave the album an XL, saying \"With the exception of a few fillers, ''Legends Never Die'' is a truly compelling entry in the two-decade discography of R.A. the Rugged Man.

The subject attracted much interest in Antiquity because in the opening of [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Iliad]]'' the [[Troy|Trojan]] priest of [[Apollo]], [[Chryses]], addresses the god in the [[vocative case|vocative]] as {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u1fe6}} (''Smintheu'', 'O, Sminthian') when imploring him to send a plague against the Greeks because [[Agamemnon]] had seized his daughter [[Chryseis]] and refused to ransom her.<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' 1.39.</ref> The [[epithet]] {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03bc\u03af\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2}} (''Sminthos'') caused some confusion to [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] speakers since they did not recognize it as being Greek in origin, and attributed it to the [[Pelasgians|Pelasgian]] or [[Mysia]]n languages.<ref>Chantraine (1980) s.v. {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03bc\u03af\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2}}.</ref> The consonantal string -''nth''- (also found in place names such as [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]) is considered by [[philology|philologists]] to be non-Greek, and possibly [[Luwian language|Luwian]], in origin.<ref>Finkelberg (2005) 42-64.</ref> The passage of [[Homer]] gives no indication as to its meaning, and so myths about Apollo Smintheus primarily arose from attempts to [[aetiology|aetiologize]] the epithet.\n\nThe earliest tradition comes from [[Callinus]], an [[elegiac]] poet from [[Ephesus]] who lived in the mid-7th century BC. He relates that Hamaxitus was founded by a band of Teucrian (i.e. Trojan) [[Crete|Cretans]] who were told by an [[oracle]] to found a city wherever the 'earth-born' ({{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03b7\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2}}) attacked them. When they reached the area of Hamaxitus, a great horde of field mice ate all the leather on their equipment, and so they settled on the spot, interpreting the 'earth-born' of the oracle to have been the mice. This myth thus glosses the term ''sminthos'' as 'mouse'.<ref>[[Strabo]], Geography, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/13A3*.html#ref5 13.1.48] = [[Callinus]] T 4 (ed. Gerber); Dougherty (1994) 37-8.</ref> Callinus' aetiology takes into account both Apollo's role as a god of disease and the fact that it was in precisely this role that Chryses had invoked him as 'Sminthian' in the ''Iliad''. However, in discussing the cult, the [[Augustus|Augustan]] Greek geographer [[Strabo]] of Amaseia noted that the epithets of gods worshipped at several other Greek sanctuaries were also explained by reference to a god bringing an end to a plague of small animals, and so it is not clear how Callinus arrived at this specific explanation of ''sminthos'' as 'mouse'.<ref>[[Strabo]], Geography, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/13A3*.html#ref60 13.1.64]; Hekster (2002) 367-8.</ref> The term appears again as a poetic word for mice several centuries later in a fragment of the early 5th century BC [[tragedy|tragedian]] [[Aeschylus]], indicating that by this time Callinus' aetiology of 'Sminthian' had been generalized from an explanation of a particular epithet into an independent [[lexeme]].<ref>[[Aeschylus]] fr. 277 (ed.

The fragment belongs to a copy of the original decree, ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae|IG]]'' I<sup>3</sup> 1453, which had been set up at Hamaxitus. Several further fragments have subsequently been published, e.g. the [[Aphytis]] fragment: ''[[Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum|SEG]]'' 51.55.</ref>\n\nFollowing the defeat of Athens at the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 403 BC, Hamaxitus enjoyed a brief period of freedom from outside interference. In 399 BC it was forcibly re-incorporated into the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] before being freed once more by the [[Ancient Sparta|Spartan]] [[Dercylidas]] in 398 BC.<ref>[[Xenophon]], ''[[Hellenica]]'' 3.1.13, 16, [[Diodorus Siculus]] 14.38.3.</ref> In the 4th century BC Hamaxitus began minting its own coinage, which depicted a head of [[Apollo]] on the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]], and either a [[lyre]] (a symbol of Apollo) with the [[legend]] {{lang|grc|\u0391\u039c\u0391\u039e\u0399}} (see [[#Name|above]]) on the [[obverse and reverse|reverse]].<ref>Bresson (2007) 150-1, who provides a complete and up-to-date list of references.</ref> This imagery was a reference to the famous sanctuary of Apollo Smintheus in the territory of Hamaxitus, and examples of the coinage have been found widely distributed across the [[Troad]].<ref>Cook (1973) 234 reports finds at K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kuyu, Ezine, Baymari\u00e7, Akk\u00f6y, and Limantepe.</ref> Apart from the salt pans at Tragasai, Hamaxitus was also enriched by its excellent harbour in this period. Finds of [[Chios|Chian]] and [[Thasos|Thasian]] wine [[amphora]]e from this period at Be\u015fiktepe indicate Hamaxitus' involvement in [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] trade, while an inscription dating to the mid-4th century BC honours a merchant from [[Cius]] in [[Bithynia]] with the right to import and export goods from Hamaxitus tax-free by both land and sea.<ref>Amphorae: Cook (1973) 231.

''Thearodokoi'': Bresson (2007) 153 n. 60.</ref>\n\nThe settlement at Hamaxitus appears to have survived at least until the early Roman period following its synoecism with Alexandreia Troas (the city had been renamed from Antigoneia Troas following the death of Antigonus at the [[Battle of Ipsus]] in 301 BC). The fame of Apollo Smintheus only increased following the synoecism, which rebuilt the temple, created a new festival in the god's honour, and featured Apollo Smintheus on its coins until the mid-3rd century AD.<ref>For continuing interest in the cult see Ricl (1997) 189-94 T 39.</ref> The Smintheum continued to appear on Roman and [[Early Middle Ages|early mediaeval]] itineraries such as the ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]'' (4th or 5th century) and the ''[[Ravenna Cosmography]]'' (7th or 8th century).<ref>Ricl (1997) 190, T 39.5-7.</ref> It is therefore likely that the port at Be\u015fiktepe was still used by pilgrims, even if the settlement of Hamaxitus had long since declined.<ref>Bresson (2007) 156.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* W.

The grapheme {{lang|grc|\u03be}} (''xi'') originally represented /ks/ ({{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03c3}}); it was a peculiarity of Attic (consistent with not being psilotic and therefore retaining audibly [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] consonants) that /ks/ was pronounced /k<sup>h</sup>s/ and so represented by the grapheme {{lang|grc|\u03c7\u03c3}}, as here in ''h''{{lang|grc|\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1'''\u03c7\u03c3'''\u03b9\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}}.<ref>Goodwin (1894) \u00a728.3.</ref> All other literary and [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] sources refer to {{lang|grc|\u1f09\u03bc\u03b1'''\u03be'''\u03b9\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}} and [[Legend|legends]] on the city's own coinage from the 4th century BC read {{lang|grc|\u0391\u039c\u0391\u039e\u0399}} (''AMAXI'', i.e. {{lang|grc|\u1f09\u03bc\u03b1\u03be\u03b9(\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2)}}, ''Hamaxi(tos)'').<ref>The 'series 1' coinage (4th century BC): Bresson (2007) 150.</ref> The city's name derives from {{lang|grc|\u1f05\u03bc\u03b1\u03be\u03b1}} (''hamaxa'') meaning 'wagon', hence the adjective {{lang|grc|\u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}} (''hamaxitos''), 'traversed by wagons', 'carriage-road', 'high-road'.<ref>[[A Greek-English Lexicon|LSJ]] s.v. {{lang|grc|\u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}}.</ref> Remains of an ancient road have been identified leading away up the coast from the sheltered bay immediately below the rise on which the [[Classical Greece|Classical]] city was located at Be\u015fiktepe, indicating the name's origin.<ref>Cook (1973) 233-4.

The subject attracted much interest in Antiquity because in the opening of [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Iliad]]'' the [[Troy|Trojan]] priest of [[Apollo]], [[Chryses]], addresses the god in the [[vocative case|vocative]] as {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u1fe6}} (''Smintheu'', 'O, Sminthian') when imploring him to send a plague against the Greeks because [[Agamemnon]] had seized his daughter [[Chryseis]] and refused to ransom her.<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' 1.39.</ref> The [[epithet]] {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03bc\u03af\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2}} (''Sminthos'') caused some confusion to [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] speakers since they did not recognize it as being Greek in origin, and attributed it to the [[Pelasgians|Pelasgian]] or [[Mysia]]n languages.<ref>Chantraine (1980) s.v. {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03bc\u03af\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2}}.</ref> The consonantal string -''nth''- (also found in place names such as [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]) is considered by [[philology|philologists]] to be non-Greek, and possibly [[Luwian language|Luwian]], in origin.<ref>Finkelberg (2005) 42-64.</ref> The passage of [[Homer]] gives no indication as to its meaning, and so myths about Apollo Smintheus primarily arose from attempts to [[aetiology|aetiologize]] the epithet.\n\nThe earliest tradition comes from [[Callinus]], an [[elegiac]] poet from [[Ephesus]] who lived in the mid-7th century BC. He relates that Hamaxitus was founded by a band of Teucrian (i.e. Trojan) [[Crete|Cretans]] who were told by an [[oracle]] to found a city wherever the 'earth-born' ({{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03b7\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2}}) attacked them. When they reached the area of Hamaxitus, a great horde of field mice ate all the leather on their equipment, and so they settled on the spot, interpreting the 'earth-born' of the oracle to have been the mice. This myth thus glosses the term ''sminthos'' as 'mouse'.<ref>[[Strabo]], Geography, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/13A3*.html#ref5 13.1.48] = [[Callinus]] T 4 (ed. Gerber); Dougherty (1994) 37-8.</ref> Callinus' aetiology takes into account both Apollo's role as a god of disease and the fact that it was in precisely this role that Chryses had invoked him as 'Sminthian' in the ''Iliad''. However, in discussing the cult, the [[Augustus|Augustan]] Greek geographer [[Strabo]] of Amaseia noted that the epithets of gods worshipped at several other Greek sanctuaries were also explained by reference to a god bringing an end to a plague of small animals, and so it is not clear how Callinus arrived at this specific explanation of ''sminthos'' as 'mouse'.<ref>[[Strabo]], Geography, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/13A3*.html#ref60 13.1.64]; Hekster (2002) 367-8.</ref> The term appears again as a poetic word for mice several centuries later in a fragment of the early 5th century BC [[tragedy|tragedian]] [[Aeschylus]], indicating that by this time Callinus' aetiology of 'Sminthian' had been generalized from an explanation of a particular epithet into an independent [[lexeme]].<ref>[[Aeschylus]] fr. 277 (ed. Sommerstein); cf. likewise [[Callimachus]], ''[[Aitia|Aetia]]'' fr. 117.16.</ref>\n\nCallinus' version predominated in Classical Antiquity and is reflected in the local traditions of Hamaxitus. Coins minted by the city in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC feature Apollo Smintheus, and after Hamaxitus was [[synoecism|synoecized]], coins depicting Apollo Smintheus continued to be produced by the [[mint (coin)|mint]] of [[Alexandria Troas|Alexandreia Troas]] until the reign of the Empreror [[Gallienus]] (AD 260\u2013268).<ref>http://numismatics.org/collection/1944.100.43746.</ref> In the early 1st century AD, Strabo described the sanctuary of Apollo Smintheus as having a statue of Apollo with his foot on a mouse created by the sculptor [[Scopas of Paros]] (c. 395 \u2013 c. 350 BC), while the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] scholar [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] (c.

The name of the Tuzla \u00c7ay, which passes through these salt pans, means 'salty river' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].</ref> A fragment of the so-called Standards Decree, which dates to the 420s BC and imposed the use of Athenian weights, measures, and coins on members of the [[Delian League]], was found at the nearby village of G\u00fclp\u0131nar.<ref>''[[Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum|SEG]]'' 38.1251. The fragment belongs to a copy of the original decree, ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae|IG]]'' I<sup>3</sup> 1453, which had been set up at Hamaxitus. Several further fragments have subsequently been published, e.g. the [[Aphytis]] fragment: ''[[Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum|SEG]]'' 51.55.</ref>\n\nFollowing the defeat of Athens at the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 403 BC, Hamaxitus enjoyed a brief period of freedom from outside interference. In 399 BC it was forcibly re-incorporated into the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] before being freed once more by the [[Ancient Sparta|Spartan]] [[Dercylidas]] in 398 BC.<ref>[[Xenophon]], ''[[Hellenica]]'' 3.1.13, 16, [[Diodorus Siculus]] 14.38.3.</ref> In the 4th century BC Hamaxitus began minting its own coinage, which depicted a head of [[Apollo]] on the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]], and either a [[lyre]] (a symbol of Apollo) with the [[legend]] {{lang|grc|\u0391\u039c\u0391\u039e\u0399}} (see [[#Name|above]]) on the [[obverse and reverse|reverse]].<ref>Bresson (2007) 150-1, who provides a complete and up-to-date list of references.</ref> This imagery was a reference to the famous sanctuary of Apollo Smintheus in the territory of Hamaxitus, and examples of the coinage have been found widely distributed across the [[Troad]].<ref>Cook (1973) 234 reports finds at K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kuyu, Ezine, Baymari\u00e7, Akk\u00f6y, and Limantepe.</ref> Apart from the salt pans at Tragasai, Hamaxitus was also enriched by its excellent harbour in this period. Finds of [[Chios|Chian]] and [[Thasos|Thasian]] wine [[amphora]]e from this period at Be\u015fiktepe indicate Hamaxitus' involvement in [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] trade, while an inscription dating to the mid-4th century BC honours a merchant from [[Cius]] in [[Bithynia]] with the right to import and export goods from Hamaxitus tax-free by both land and sea.<ref>Amphorae: Cook (1973) 231.

First synoecized c. 188 - c. 171 BC: Bresson (2007).</ref> In the early [[Hellenistic]] period, Hamaxitus continued to promote its link with Apollo Smintheus, introducing a second and more elaborate series of coins advertising its link with the shrine.<ref>Bresson (2007) 151.</ref> As the popularity of the cult of Apollo Smintheus grew in the Hellenistic period (see [[#Apollo Smintheus|above]]), the convenient proximity of its port to the god's shrine meant Hamaxitus benefited from an increasing number of pilgrims passing through the city's harbour.<ref>Bresson (2007) 156.</ref> The continuing profitability of the salt pans at Tragasai is clear from King [[Lysimachus]]' attempt to tax them c. 301-281 BC, while the importance of this income to Hamaxitus is indicated by their strident (and successful) lobbying of Lysimachus for tax exemption on the salt pans.<ref>Ricl (1997) 198-200, T 59-64.</ref> In the last decade of the 4th century BC we hear of Hamaxitus honouring a friend of [[Antigonus Monophthalmus]], Nicomedes of [[Kos]], and c. 230-220 BC it appeared along the route of the [[Delphi]]c ''thearodokoi''.<ref>Nikomedes of Kos: ''IscrCos'' ED 71g B.6. ''Thearodokoi'': Bresson (2007) 153 n. 60.</ref>\n\nThe settlement at Hamaxitus appears to have survived at least until the early Roman period following its synoecism with Alexandreia Troas (the city had been renamed from Antigoneia Troas following the death of Antigonus at the [[Battle of Ipsus]] in 301 BC). The fame of Apollo Smintheus only increased following the synoecism, which rebuilt the temple, created a new festival in the god's honour, and featured Apollo Smintheus on its coins until the mid-3rd century AD.<ref>For continuing interest in the cult see Ricl (1997) 189-94 T 39.</ref> The Smintheum continued to appear on Roman and [[Early Middle Ages|early mediaeval]] itineraries such as the ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]'' (4th or 5th century) and the ''[[Ravenna Cosmography]]'' (7th or 8th century).<ref>Ricl (1997) 190, T 39.5-7.</ref> It is therefore likely that the port at Be\u015fiktepe was still used by pilgrims, even if the settlement of Hamaxitus had long since declined.<ref>Bresson (2007) 156.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* W.
