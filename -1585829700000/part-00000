[[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] was opened in 1923 and became their home ground.

In [[UEFA Euro 1968]], the team reached the semi-finals for the first time, being eliminated by [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nEngland qualified for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] in Mexico as reigning champions, and reached the quarter-finals, where they were knocked out by West Germany. England had been 2\u20130 up, but were eventually beaten 3\u20132 after [[extra time]].

England striker [[Gary Lineker]] finished as the tournament's top scorer with six goals.\n\nEngland went on to lose every match at [[UEFA Euro 1988]]. They next achieved their second best result in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] by finishing fourth&nbsp;\u2013 losing again to West Germany in a semi-final finishing 1\u20131 after [[extra time]], then 4\u20133 in England's first [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]].

Due to the emotional nature of the defeat to West Germany<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt0xx3So6zw&feature=emb_logo</ref>, the team were welcomed home as heroes and thousands of people lined the streets for an open-top bus parade.\n\n===Graham Taylor, Terry Venables, Glenn Hoddle and Kevin Keegan===\nThe 1990s saw four England managers follow Robson, each in the role for a relatively brief period. [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] was Robson's immediate successor. England failed to win any matches at [[UEFA Euro 1992]], drawing with tournament winners [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and later with [[France national football team|France]], before being eliminated by host nation [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. The team then failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] after losing a controversial game against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in Rotterdam, which resulted in Taylor's resignation.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1996, [[Terry Venables]] managed the team. At [[UEFA Euro 1996]], held in England, they equalled their best performance at a [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]], reaching the semi-finals as they did in 1968, before exiting via a penalty shoot-out loss to Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/retro-mbm-england-v-west-germany-sort-of-live |title =England v West Germany at Italia '90 \u2013 as it happened|date=27 March 2014|work=Guardian|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref> England striker [[Alan Shearer]] was the tournament's top scorer with five goals.

Following Hoddle's departure, [[Kevin Keegan]] took England to [[UEFA Euro 2000]], but the team left in the group stage and he resigned shortly afterwards.\n\n===Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, Steve McClaren and Fabio Capello===\n\n[[File:England team.jpg|thumb|left|The England team at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]]]\n[[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] took charge between 2001 and 2006, and was the team's first non-English manager. He guided England to the quarter-finals of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2004]] and the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. England lost only five competitive matches during his tenure, and England rose to number four in the world ranking under his guidance. Eriksson's contract was extended by the FA by two years, to include [[UEFA Euro 2008]], but was terminated by them after the 2006 World Cup.\n\n[[Steve McClaren]] was then appointed as head coach, but after failing to qualify for Euro 2008 was sacked on 22 November 2007. The following month, he was replaced by a second foreign manager, Italian [[Fabio Capello]], whose experience included spells at [[Juventus]] and [[Real Madrid]]. England won all but one of their [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification&nbsp;\u2013 UEFA Group 6|qualifying games]] for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], but at the tournament itself, England drew their opening two games; this led to questions about the team's spirit, tactics and ability to handle pressure.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rifts appear as players grow tired of Capello regime |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jun/21/england-john-terry-fabio-capello |date=21 June 2010 |last=Gibson |first=Owen |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=3 July 2010 |location=London}}</ref> They progressed to the next round, however, where they were beaten 4\u20131 by [[Germany national football team|Germany]], their heaviest defeat in a World Cup finals tournament match.

shirts, navy blue shorts and white or black socks. The team has periodically worn an all-white kit.\n\nAlthough England's first [[away kit]]s were blue, England's traditional away colours are red shirts, white shorts and red socks. In 1996, England's away kit was changed to grey shirts, shorts and socks. This kit was only worn three times, including against [[Germany National Football Team|Germany]] in the semi-final of [[Euro 1996]] but the deviation from the traditional red was unpopular with supporters and the England away kit remained red until 2011, when a navy blue away kit was introduced. The away kit is also sometimes worn during home matches, when a new edition has been released to promote it.\n\nEngland have occasionally had a third kit. At the 1970 World Cup England wore a third kit with pale blue shirts, shorts and socks against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]. They had a kit similar to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]'s, with yellow shirts, yellow socks and blue shorts which they wore in the summer of 1973. For the World Cup in 1986 England had a third kit of pale blue, imitating that worn in Mexico 16 years before and England retained pale blue third kits until 1992, but they were rarely used.\n\n[[Umbro]] first agreed to manufacture the kit in 1954 and since then has supplied most of the kits, the exceptions being from 1959\u20131965 with [[Bukta]] and 1974\u20131984 with [[Admiral Sportswear|Admiral]].

They initially used [[cricket]] grounds before later moving on to football club stadiums. The original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Empire Stadium]] was built in [[Wembley]], London, for the [[British Empire Exhibition]].\n\nEngland played their first match at the stadium in 1924 against Scotland and for the next 27 years Wembley was used as a venue for matches against Scotland only. The stadium later became known simply as Wembley Stadium and it became England's permanent home stadium during the 1950s. In October 2000, the stadium closed its doors, ending with a [[2000 England v Germany football match|defeat]].\n\nThis stadium was demolished during the period of 2002\u20132003, and work began to completely rebuild it. During this time, England played at venues across the country, though by the time of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification&nbsp;\u2013 UEFA Group 6|2006 World Cup qualification]], this had largely settled down to having [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s [[Old Trafford]] stadium as the primary venue, with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]'s [[St. James' Park, Newcastle|St. James' Park]] used on occasions when Old Trafford was unavailable.\n\nThey returned to the new [[Wembley Stadium]] in March 2007. The stadium is now owned by the Football Association, via its subsidiary Wembley National Stadium Limited.\n\n===Media coverage===\nAll England matches are broadcast with full commentary on [[talkSPORT]] and [[BBC Radio 5 Live]]. From the [[2008\u201309 in English football|2008\u201309]] season until the 2017\u201318 season, England's home and away qualifiers, and friendlies both home and away are broadcast live on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] (often with the exception of [[STV (TV network)|STV]], the ITV franchisee in central and northern [[Scotland]]). England's away qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup were shown on [[Setanta Sports]] until that company's collapse. As a result of Setanta Sports's demise, England's World Cup qualifier in Ukraine on 10 October 2009 was shown in the United Kingdom on a pay-per-view basis via the internet only. This one-off event was the first time an England game had been screened in such a way. The number of subscribers, paying between \u00a34.99 and \u00a311.99 each, was estimated at between 250,000 and 300,000 and the total number of viewers at around 500,000.<ref>{{cite news

FIFA World Cup semi-final: England vs Croatia.]]\n[[File:CRO-ENG 2018-07-11.svg|thumb|Line-ups of the 2018 FIFA World Cup semi-final: England (white) vs Croatia.]]\n\nEngland first appeared at the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]], and have subsequently qualified for a total of 15 FIFA World Cup finals tournaments, tied for sixth best by number of appearances. They are also tied for sixth by number of wins, alongside Spain. The national team is one of eight national teams to have won at least one [[FIFA World Cup]] title. The England team won their first and only World Cup title in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]]. The tournament was played on home soil, and England defeated [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] 4\u20132 in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|final]]. In [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]], England finished in fourth place, losing 2\u20131 to host nation [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the third place play-off, after losing on penalties to champions [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in the semi-final. They also finished in fourth place in [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]], after losing 2\u20130 to [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in the third place play-off and 2\u20131 to [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] in the semi-final after extra time. The team also reached the quarter-final stage in [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]], [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]], [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]], [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]].\n\nEngland failed to qualify for the World Cup in [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]], [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. The team's earliest exit in the finals tournament was its elimination in the first round in [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]], [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] and, most recently, the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. This was after being defeated in both their opening two matches for the first time, against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in Group D. In 1950, four teams remained after the first round, in 1958 eight teams remained and in 2014 sixteen teams remained. In [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], England suffered its most resounding World Cup defeat, 4\u20131 to [[Germany national football team|Germany]], in the Round of 16 stage. This came after drawing with the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], and defeating [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] 1\u20130 in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group C|group stage]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:white; color:#0B0B3F; {{box-shadow

the [[FIFA World Cup]], the [[UEFA European Championship]] and the [[UEFA Nations League]]. England, as a [[Countries of the United Kingdom|country of the United Kingdom]], is not a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] and therefore the national team does not compete at the [[Olympic Games]].\n\nEngland is one of the two oldest national teams in football, alongside [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], whom they played in the world's [[1872 Scotland v England football match|first international football match]] in 1872. England's home ground is [[Wembley Stadium]], London, and their headquarters is at [[St George's Park National Football Centre|St George's Park]], [[Burton upon Trent]]. The team's manager is [[Gareth Southgate]]. \n\nSince first entering the tournament in 1950, England has qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] 15 times. They won the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]], when they hosted [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|the finals]], and finished fourth in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]].

A [[England v Scotland representative matches (1870\u20131872)|representative match between England and Scotland]] was played on 5 March 1870, having been organised by the [[The Football Association|Football Association]]. A return fixture was organised by representatives of Scottish football teams on 30 November 1872. This match, played at [[Hamilton Crescent]] in Scotland, is viewed as the first official international football match, because the two teams were independently selected and operated, rather than being the work of a single football association.<ref>{{cite web |title=England Match No. 1&nbsp;\u2013 Scotland&nbsp;\u2013 30 November 1872&nbsp;\u2013 Match Summary and Report |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1872-00/1872-73/M0001Sco1872.html |publisher=englandfootballonline.com |accessdate=22 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203105311/http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1872-00/1872-73/M0001Sco1872.html |archive-date=3 December 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Over the next 40 years, England played exclusively with the other three [[Home Nations]]\u2014Scotland, [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]]\u2014in the [[British Home Championship]].\n\nAt first, England had no permanent home stadium. They joined [[FIFA]] in 1906 and played their first ever games against countries other than the Home Nations on a tour of Central Europe in 1908. [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] was opened in 1923 and became their home ground. The relationship between England and FIFA became strained, and this resulted in their departure from FIFA in 1928, before they rejoined in 1946. As a result, they did not compete in a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] until [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]], in which they were beaten in a [[England v United States (1950)|1\u20130 defeat]] by the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], failing to get past the first round in one of the most embarrassing defeats in the team's history.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/7823072/England-v-USA-1950-World-Cup-win-over-the-Three-Lions-lives-long-in-the-memory.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Tim |last=Hart |title=England v USA: 1950 World Cup win over the Three Lions lives long in the memory |date=12 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nTheir first defeat on home soil to a foreign team was a [[1949 England v Ireland football match|2\u20130 loss]] to [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]], on 21 September 1949 at [[Goodison Park]].

The [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] was hosted in England and Ramsey guided England to victory with a [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|4\u20132 win]] against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] after [[extra time]] in the final, during which [[Geoff Hurst]] scored a [[hat-trick]]. In [[UEFA Euro 1968]], the team reached the semi-finals for the first time, being eliminated by [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nEngland qualified for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] in Mexico as reigning champions, and reached the quarter-finals, where they were knocked out by West Germany. England had been 2\u20130 up, but were eventually beaten 3\u20132 after [[extra time]]. They failed in qualification for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], leading to Ramsey's dismissal.\n\n===Don Revie, Ron Greenwood and Bobby Robson===\nRamsey was succeeded by [[Don Revie]] between 1974 and 1977, but the team failed to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 1976]] and the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]]. Under [[Ron Greenwood]], they managed to qualify for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] in Spain (the first time competitively since 1962); despite not losing a game, they were eliminated in the second group stage.\n\n[[Bobby Robson]] managed England from 1982 to 1990. Although the team failed to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 1984]], they reached the quarter-finals of the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], losing 2\u20131 to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in a game made famous by two goals by [[Diego Maradona|Maradona]] for very contrasting reasons - the first being knocked in by hand, prompting the \"Hand of God\" label, the second being an outstanding individual goal, involving dribbling past several opponents. England striker [[Gary Lineker]] finished as the tournament's top scorer with six goals.\n\nEngland went on to lose every match at [[UEFA Euro 1988]]. They next achieved their second best result in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] by finishing fourth&nbsp;\u2013 losing again to West Germany in a semi-final finishing 1\u20131 after [[extra time]], then 4\u20133 in England's first [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]]. Despite losing to [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the third place play-off, the members of the England team were given bronze medals identical to the Italians'. Due to the emotional nature of the defeat to West Germany<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt0xx3So6zw&feature=emb_logo</ref>, the team were welcomed home as heroes and thousands of people lined the streets for an open-top bus parade.\n\n===Graham Taylor, Terry Venables, Glenn Hoddle and Kevin Keegan===\nThe 1990s saw four England managers follow Robson, each in the role for a relatively brief period. [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] was Robson's immediate successor. England failed to win any matches at [[UEFA Euro 1992]], drawing with tournament winners [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and later with [[France national football team|France]], before being eliminated by host nation [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. The team then failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] after losing a controversial game against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in Rotterdam, which resulted in Taylor's resignation.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1996, [[Terry Venables]] managed the team. At [[UEFA Euro 1996]], held in England, they equalled their best performance at a [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]], reaching the semi-finals as they did in 1968, before exiting via a penalty shoot-out loss to Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/retro-mbm-england-v-west-germany-sort-of-live |title =England v West Germany at Italia '90 \u2013 as it happened|date=27 March 2014|work=Guardian|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref> England striker [[Alan Shearer]] was the tournament's top scorer with five goals.

He guided England to the quarter-finals of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2004]] and the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. England lost only five competitive matches during his tenure, and England rose to number four in the world ranking under his guidance. Eriksson's contract was extended by the FA by two years, to include [[UEFA Euro 2008]], but was terminated by them after the 2006 World Cup.\n\n[[Steve McClaren]] was then appointed as head coach, but after failing to qualify for Euro 2008 was sacked on 22 November 2007. The following month, he was replaced by a second foreign manager, Italian [[Fabio Capello]], whose experience included spells at [[Juventus]] and [[Real Madrid]]. England won all but one of their [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification&nbsp;\u2013 UEFA Group 6|qualifying games]] for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], but at the tournament itself, England drew their opening two games; this led to questions about the team's spirit, tactics and ability to handle pressure.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rifts appear as players grow tired of Capello regime |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jun/21/england-john-terry-fabio-capello |date=21 June 2010 |last=Gibson |first=Owen |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=3 July 2010 |location=London}}</ref> They progressed to the next round, however, where they were beaten 4\u20131 by [[Germany national football team|Germany]], their heaviest defeat in a World Cup finals tournament match.

shirts, navy blue shorts and white or black socks. The team has periodically worn an all-white kit.\n\nAlthough England's first [[away kit]]s were blue, England's traditional away colours are red shirts, white shorts and red socks. In 1996, England's away kit was changed to grey shirts, shorts and socks. This kit was only worn three times, including against [[Germany National Football Team|Germany]] in the semi-final of [[Euro 1996]] but the deviation from the traditional red was unpopular with supporters and the England away kit remained red until 2011, when a navy blue away kit was introduced. The away kit is also sometimes worn during home matches, when a new edition has been released to promote it.\n\nEngland have occasionally had a third kit. At the 1970 World Cup England wore a third kit with pale blue shirts, shorts and socks against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]. They had a kit similar to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]'s, with yellow shirts, yellow socks and blue shorts which they wore in the summer of 1973. For the World Cup in 1986 England had a third kit of pale blue, imitating that worn in Mexico 16 years before and England retained pale blue third kits until 1992, but they were rarely used.\n\n[[Umbro]] first agreed to manufacture the kit in 1954 and since then has supplied most of the kits, the exceptions being from 1959\u20131965 with [[Bukta]] and 1974\u20131984 with [[Admiral Sportswear|Admiral]]. [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] purchased Umbro in 2008 and took over as kit supplier in 2013 following their sale of the Umbro brand.<ref>{{cite web|title=England's Uniforms and Playing Kits|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/teamunif/Unif.html|website=EnglandFootballOnline.com|accessdate=30 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115085155/http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamUnif/Unif.html|archive-date=15 January 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\nkits\n\n{{Football kit box\n|width=180\n|filetype=png\n|alt=\n|pattern_la=_eng18h\n|pattern_b=_eng18h\n|pattern_ra=_eng18h\n|leftarm=FFFFF\n|body=FFFFF\n|rightarm=FFFFF\n|shorts=FFFFF\n|pattern_sh=_eng18h\n|pattern_so=_eng18hlong\n|socks=FFFFF\n|title=This is the kit worn by england Away to Kosovo on 17th November 2019\n|align=\n}}\n\n===Crest===\nThe motif of the England national football team has three lions ''passant guardant'', the emblem of King [[Richard I of England|Richard I]], who reigned from 1189 to 1199.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cartwright|first1=Justin|title=Richard the Lionheart: battle addict who spent much of his life in France|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/14/richard-lionheart-battle-addict-france|accessdate=16 January 2016|work=The Guardian|date=14 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407080237/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/14/richard-lionheart-battle-addict-france|archive-date=7 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1872, English players wore white jerseys emblazoned with the three lions crest of the Football Association.<ref name=kits/> The lions, often blue, have had minor changes to colour and appearance.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Winter|first1=Henry|title=England identity crisis ahead as FA rejig Three Lions|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/4928389/England-identity-crisis-ahead-as-FA-rejig-Three-Lions.html|accessdate=16 January 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205110708/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/4928389/England-identity-crisis-ahead-as-FA-rejig-Three-Lions.html|archive-date=5 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Initially topped by a crown, this was removed in 1949 when the FA was given an official coat of arms by the [[College of Arms]];

They initially used [[cricket]] grounds before later moving on to football club stadiums. The original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Empire Stadium]] was built in [[Wembley]], London, for the [[British Empire Exhibition]].\n\nEngland played their first match at the stadium in 1924 against Scotland and for the next 27 years Wembley was used as a venue for matches against Scotland only. The stadium later became known simply as Wembley Stadium and it became England's permanent home stadium during the 1950s. In October 2000, the stadium closed its doors, ending with a [[2000 England v Germany football match|defeat]].\n\nThis stadium was demolished during the period of 2002\u20132003, and work began to completely rebuild it. During this time, England played at venues across the country, though by the time of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification&nbsp;\u2013 UEFA Group 6|2006 World Cup qualification]], this had largely settled down to having [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s [[Old Trafford]] stadium as the primary venue, with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]'s [[St. James' Park, Newcastle|St. James' Park]] used on occasions when Old Trafford was unavailable.\n\nThey returned to the new [[Wembley Stadium]] in March 2007. The stadium is now owned by the Football Association, via its subsidiary Wembley National Stadium Limited.\n\n===Media coverage===\nAll England matches are broadcast with full commentary on [[talkSPORT]] and [[BBC Radio 5 Live]]. From the [[2008\u201309 in English football|2008\u201309]] season until the 2017\u201318 season, England's home and away qualifiers, and friendlies both home and away are broadcast live on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] (often with the exception of [[STV (TV network)|STV]], the ITV franchisee in central and northern [[Scotland]]). England's away qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup were shown on [[Setanta Sports]] until that company's collapse. As a result of Setanta Sports's demise, England's World Cup qualifier in Ukraine on 10 October 2009 was shown in the United Kingdom on a pay-per-view basis via the internet only. This one-off event was the first time an England game had been screened in such a way. The number of subscribers, paying between \u00a34.99 and \u00a311.99 each, was estimated at between 250,000 and 300,000 and the total number of viewers at around 500,000.<ref>{{cite news

[[1950 FIFA World Cup]], and have subsequently qualified for a total of 15 FIFA World Cup finals tournaments, tied for sixth best by number of appearances. They are also tied for sixth by number of wins, alongside Spain. The national team is one of eight national teams to have won at least one [[FIFA World Cup]] title. The England team won their first and only World Cup title in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]]. The tournament was played on home soil, and England defeated [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] 4\u20132 in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|final]]. In [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]], England finished in fourth place, losing 2\u20131 to host nation [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the third place play-off, after losing on penalties to champions [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in the semi-final. They also finished in fourth place in [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]], after losing 2\u20130 to [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in the third place play-off and 2\u20131 to [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] in the semi-final after extra time. The team also reached the quarter-final stage in [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]], [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]], [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]], [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]].\n\nEngland failed to qualify for the World Cup in [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]], [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. The team's earliest exit in the finals tournament was its elimination in the first round in [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]], [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] and, most recently, the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. This was after being defeated in both their opening two matches for the first time, against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in Group D. In 1950, four teams remained after the first round, in 1958 eight teams remained and in 2014 sixteen teams remained. In [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], England suffered its most resounding World Cup defeat, 4\u20131 to [[Germany national football team|Germany]], in the Round of 16 stage. This came after drawing with the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], and defeating [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] 1\u20130 in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group C|group stage]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:white; color:#0B0B3F; {{box-shadow

Each cookie contains only 40 calories; they are 66% thinner than the original version.\n* ''Chocolate Oreo'' \u2013 Simply an Oreo cookie with chocolate cr\u00e8me filling instead of the original vanilla flavored white cr\u00e8me filling.<!--Introduced 2011-->\n* ''Mint Oreo'' \u2013 A variety of Oreo with two chocolate wafers separated by a mint flavored cr\u00e8me filling.<!--Introduced when?-->\n* ''The Most Stuf'' \u2013 Introduced in January 2019, a limited edition Oreo with approximately four times the amount of cr\u00e8me filling of a standard Oreo.\n\nSpecial edition ''Double Stuf Oreo'' cookies are produced during springtime, and around [[Halloween]] and [[Christmas]]. These have colored frosting reflecting the current holiday: blue or yellow for springtime; orange for Halloween; and red or green for the Christmas holiday. One side of each seasonal cookie is stamped with an appropriate design; the spring cookies feature flowers, butterflies, etc., while the Halloween editions feature a jack o'lantern, ghost, cat, flock of bats, or broom-riding witch.<!--What designs are featured on the Christmas ones?--> The 2017 ''Halloween Oreo'' broke with this tradition, having orange-colored cr\u00e8me filling (albeit with classic vanilla flavor) but carrying no seasonal designs.\n\nIn some countries, Oreos come in a variety of flavors that are not familiar to the U.S. market. For example, ''Green Tea Oreos'' are only available in China and Japan, while ''Lemon Ice Oreos'' were only ever introduced in Japan.\n\n=== Limited editions ===\n[[File:Mr. Christie, you definitely make good cookies! (2523264708).jpg|thumb|Close-up view of a golden Oreo cookie wafer]]\nBeginning in the early 2010s, Oreo began releasing [[Limited edition candy|limited edition]] runs of cookies with more exotic flavors. These \"limited editions\" typically appear in stores for a short period and are then discontinued, although some varieties have since resurfaced, for example: ''Reese's Oreos'' returned for a second limited run after they were first introduced for a limited period in 2014; and ''Birthday Cake Oreos'', originally introduced in 2012, have since become permanently available.<ref name=\"List\">{{cite web |url=http://www.glamour.com/story/special-oreos-flavors-limited-edition |title=A Comprehensive List of Every Special Oreo Flavor, Ever |last=Clinton |first=Leah Melby |date=June 17, 2015 |publisher=Glamour |access-date=February 21, 2017}}</ref> Some limited editions are only made available at certain retailers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.foodbeast.com/news/blueberry-oreos-fruity-crisps/ |title=NEW OREO FLAVORS: Blueberry Pie & Fruity Crisps |last=Ayerouth |first=Elie |date=May 26, 2016 |publisher=foodbeast.com |access-date=February 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\nLimited edition runs usually feature a cr\u00e8me filling that has been flavored to replicate the taste of a specific fruit or dessert, from familiar flavors such as [[lemon]] or [[Mentha|mint]], to the more specific and unusual flavors of [[blueberry pie]] or [[red velvet cake]]. They may also incorporate different varieties of cookie wafer, for example ''Cinnamon-Bun Oreos'' featured [[cinnamon]] flavored cookies and \"frosting flavored cr\u00e8me\".
