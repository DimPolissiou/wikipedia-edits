Mainly privileged elites were educated to read and write in Hanja. However, most of the population was illiterate.\n\nIn the 15th century, King [[Sejong the Great]] personally developed an [[alphabet]]ic [[featural writing system]] known today as [[Hangul]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kim-Renaud|first1=Young-Key|title=The Korean Alphabet: Its History and Structure|date=1997|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=9780824817237|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nonRl2cerIgC&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=16 May 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=\uc54c\uace0 \uc2f6\uc740 \ud55c\uae00|url=http://www.korean.go.kr/hangeul/setting/002.html|website=\uad6d\ub9bd\uad6d\uc5b4\uc6d0|publisher=National Institute of Korean Language|accessdate=4 December 2017}}</ref> He felt that Hanja was inadequate to write Korean and that this was the cause of its very restricted use; Hangul was designed to either aid in reading Hanja or replace Hanja entirely. Introduced in the document \"''[[Hunminjeongeum]]''\", it was called \"''eonmun''\" (colloquial script) and quickly spread nationwide to increase literacy in Korea. [[Hangul]] was widely used by all the Korean classes but often treated as \"''amkeul''\" (script for female) and disregarded by privileged elites, whereas [[Hanja]] was regarded as \"''jinseo''\" (true text). Consequently, official documents were always written in [[Hanja]] during the [[Joseon]] era.

Neither South Korea or North Korea opposes the learning of [[Hanja]], though they are not officially used in North Korea anymore, and their usage in South Korea is mainly reserved for specific circumstances, such as newspapers, scholarly papers, and disambiguation.\n\nSince the [[Korean War]], through 70 years of separation, [[North\u2013South differences in the Korean language|North\u2013South differences]] have developed in standard Korean, including variations in pronunciation and vocabulary chosen, but these minor differences can be found in any of the Korean dialects and still largely mutually intelligible.\n\n==Names==\nThe Korean names for the language are based on the [[Names of Korea|names for Korea]] used in both South Korea and North Korea.\n\nThe English word \"Korean\" is derived from [[Goryeo]], which is thought to be the first Korean dynasty known to Western nations. Korean people in the [[Post-Soviet states|former USSR]] refer to themselves as ''[[Koryo-saram]]'' and/or ''Koryo-in'' (literally, \"[[Names of Korea#Goryeo|Koryo/Goryeo]] person(s)\"), and call the language ''[[Koryo-mal]].''\n\nIn South Korea, the Korean language is referred to by many names including ''hanguk-eo'' (\"Korean language\"), ''hanguk-mal'' (\"Korean speech\") and ''uri-mal'' (\"our language\"). In \"''hanguk-eo''\" and \"''hanguk-mal''\", the first part of the word, \"''hanguk''\" was taken from the name of the [[Korean Empire]] ({{korean|\ub300\ud55c\uc81c\uad6d|\u5927\u97d3\u5e1d\u570b|Daehan Jeguk|labels=no}}).

Korean is also simply referred to as ''guk-eo'', literally \"national language\". This name is based on the same [[Hanja|Han characters]], meaning \"nation\" + \"language\" (\"\u570b\u8a9e\"), that are also used in Taiwan and Japan to refer to their respective national languages.\n\nIn North Korea and [[China]], the language is most often called ''Joseon-mal'', or more formally, ''Joseon-o''. This is taken from the North Korean name for Korea (Joseon), a name retained from the [[Joseon dynasty]] until the proclamation of the [[Korean Empire]], which in turn was annexed by the [[Empire of Japan]].\n\nIn [[mainland China]], following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term ''Ch\u00e1oxi\u01ceny\u01d4'' or the short form ''Ch\u00e1oy\u01d4'' has normally been used to refer to the standard language of North Korea and [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture|Yanbian]], whereas ''H\u00e1ngu\u00f3y\u01d4'' or the short form ''H\u00e1ny\u01d4'' is used to refer to the standard language of South Korea.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}\n\nSome older English sources also use the spelling \"Corea\" to refer to the nation, and its inflected form for the language, culture and people, \"Korea\" becoming more popular in the late 1800s according to Google's NGram English corpus of 2015.<ref name=\"GoogleNGrams\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Korea%2CCorea&year_start=1800&year_end=1950&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2CKorea%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CCorea%3B%2Cc0|title=Google Ngram Viewer}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n\nKorean is considered by most linguists to be a [[language isolate]], though it is commonly included by proponents of the now generally rejected [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] family.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Making of the Korean Language|last=Kim|first=Chin-Wu|publisher=Center for Korean Studies, University of Hawai'i|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> [[Alexander Vovin]] (2015)<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/18764127|title=\uc54c\ud0c0\uc774\ud560\uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 2|last=Vovin|first=Alexander|year=2015|isbn=978-8-955-56053-4|contribution=Korean as a Paleosiberian Language|access-date=2016-11-06}}</ref> notes that Koreanic shares some [[Linguistic typology|typological]] features with the four [[Paleosiberian languages|Paleosiberian]] language families (e.g. lack of phonemic [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] stops, verb [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]], earlier [[ergativity]]), and suggests that it actually has more in common with the various Paleosiberian language family (which is a geographical and areal grouping rather a genetic one) than with the putative [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] group.\n\nThe hypothesis that Korean could be related to [[Japanese language|Japanese]] has had some supporters due to some overlap in vocabulary and similar grammatical features that have been elaborated upon by such researchers as [[Samuel Martin (linguist)|Samuel E.

Also, the doublet ''wo'' meaning \"hemp\" is attested in Western Old Japanese and Southern Ryukyuan languages. It is thus plausible to assume a borrowed term.<ref>Vovin 2008: 211\u201312</ref> (see [[Classification of the Japonic languages]] or [[Comparison of Japanese and Korean]] for further details on a possible relationship.)\n\nAnother lesser-known theory is the [[Dravido-Korean languages]] theory which suggests a relation with Dravidian in India. Some of the common features in the Korean and [[Dravidian languages]] are that they share some similar vocabulary, are agglutinative, and follow the SOV order; in both languages, nominals and adjectives follow the same syntax, particles are post-positional, and modifiers always precede modified words.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Korean Language|publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=29|author=Min-Sohn, Ho |year=2001}}</ref> However, typological similarities such as these could have arisen by chance.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LbmP_1KIQ_8C&pg=PA109 Pozzi & Janhunen & Weiers 2006], p. 109</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Janhunen|first1=Juha|title=The Lost Languages of Koguryo|journal=Journal of Inner and East Asian Studies|date=2005|volume=2-2|pages=65\u201386}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Khitan language]] has many vocabulary items similar to Korean that are not found in Mongolian or Tungusic languages.

The [[standard language]] (''pyojun-eo'' or ''pyojun-mal'') of both South Korea and North Korea is based on the dialect of the area around Seoul (which, as Hanyang, was the capital of [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]]-era Korea for 500 years), though the northern standard after the [[Korean War]] has been influenced by the dialect of [[Pyongyang|P'y\u014fngyang]]. All dialects of Korean are similar to each other and largely [[mutually intelligible]] (with the exception of dialect-specific phrases or non-Standard vocabulary unique to dialects), though the [[Jeju dialect|dialect of Jeju Island]] is divergent enough to be sometimes classified as a separate language.<ref>{{cite web|author=Source: Unescopress |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/new_interactive_atlas_adds_two_more_endangered_languages/ |title=New interactive atlas adds two more endangered languages &#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref><ref>David Lightfoot, 1999. ''The development of language: acquisition, change, and evolution''</ref><ref>[[Juha Janhunen|Janhunen, Juha]], 1996. ''Manchuria: an ethnic history''</ref> One of the more salient differences between dialects is the use of tone: speakers of the [[Seoul dialect]] make use of vowel length, whereas speakers of the [[Gyeongsang dialect]] maintain the [[Pitch-accent language|pitch accent]] of Middle Korean. Some dialects are conservative, maintaining Middle Korean sounds (such as ''z, \u03b2, \u0259'') which have been lost from the standard language, whereas others are highly innovative.\n\nThere is substantial evidence for a history of extensive [[dialect levelling]], or even [[convergent evolution]] or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, for example \"[[garlic chives]]\" translated into Gyeongsang dialect {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255\u028c\u014b.\u0261u.d\u0361\u0291i/}} ({{lang|ko|\uc815\uad6c\uc9c0}}) but in Standard Korean, it is {{IPA|/pu\u02d0t\u0361\u0255\u02b0u/}} ({{lang|ko|\ubd80\ucd94}}). This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} See also the [[Japanese\u2013Koguryoic languages]] hypothesis.\n\nNonetheless, the separation of the two Korean states has resulted in increasing differences among the dialects that have emerged over time. Since the allies of the newly-founded nations split the Korean peninsula in half after 1945, the newly formed Korean nations have since borrowed vocabulary extensively from their respective allies. As the Soviet Union helped industrialize North Korea and establish it as a communist state, the North Koreans therefore borrowed a number of Russian terms. Likewise, since the United States helped South Korea extensively to develop militarily, economically, and politically, South Koreans therefore borrowed extensively from English.\n\nThe differences among northern and southern dialects have become so significant that many North Korean defectors reportedly have had great difficulty communicating with South Koreans after having initially settled into South Korea. In response to the diverging vocabularies, an app called Univoca was designed to help North Korean defectors learn South Korean terms by translating them into North Korean ones.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Korean is virtually two languages, and that's a big problem for North Korean defectors|url = http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-05-19/korean-today-virtually-two-languages-and-thats-problem-north-korean-defectors|website = Public Radio International|access-date = 2016-01-18}}</ref> More information can be found on the page [[North\u2013South differences in the Korean language|North-South differences in the Korean language]].\n\nAside from the standard language, there are few clear boundaries between Korean dialects, and they are typically partially grouped according to the [[regions of Korea]].{{citation needed|reason=This looks like something Korean popular culture tends to do for convenience, regardless of what linguists actually think.

It disappeared before {{IPA|[j]}}, and otherwise became {{IPA|/n/}}. However, the inflow of western [[Konglish|loanwords]] changed the trend, and now word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either {{IPA|[\u027e]}} or {{IPA|[l]}}. The traditional prohibition of word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} became a morphological rule called \"initial law\" ({{lang|ko|\ub450\uc74c\ubc95\uce59}}) in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} in North Korea.\n\nAll [[obstruent]]s (plosives, affricates, fricatives) at the end of a word are pronounced with [[no audible release]], {{IPA|[p\u031a, t\u031a, k\u031a]}}.\n\nPlosive stops {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} become nasal stops {{IPA|[m, n, \u014b]}} before nasal stops.\n\n[[Hangul]] spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.\n\nOne difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial {{IPA|[\u027e]}}, and initial {{IPA|[n]}}. For example,\n* \"labor\" \u2013 north: '''''r'''odong'' ({{lang|ko|\ub85c\ub3d9}}), south: '''''n'''odong'' ({{lang|ko|\ub178\ub3d9}})\n* \"history\" \u2013 north: '''''ry'''eoksa'' ({{lang|ko|\ub825\uc0ac}}), south: '''''y'''eoksa'' ({{lang|ko|\uc5ed\uc0ac}})\n* \"female\" \u2013 north: '''''ny'''eoja'' ({{lang|ko|\ub140\uc790}}), south: '''''y'''eoja'' ({{lang|ko|\uc5ec\uc790}})\n\n===Morphophonemics===\n{{Main|Morphophonology}}\nGrammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds.

The Korean language is traditionally considered to have nine parts of speech. For details, see [[Korean parts of speech]]. Modifiers generally precede the modified words, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]], but the verb is the only required and immovable element and [[word order]] is highly flexible, as in many other agglutinative languages.\n\n{|\n|-\n|'''A''':||&nbsp;||{{lang|ko|\uac00\uac8c\uc5d0}}|| &nbsp; ||{{lang|ko|\uac00\uc168\uc5b4\uc694?}}\n|-\n| || ||gage-e|| ||''ga-syeo-sseo-yo''\n|-\n| || ||store + [location marker ({{lang|ko|\uc5d0}})]|| ||[go (verb root) ({{lang|ko|\uac00}})] + [honorific ({{lang|ko|\uc2dc}})] + [conjugated (contraction rule)({{lang|ko|\uc5b4}})] + [past ({{lang|ko|\u3146}})] + [conjunctive ({{lang|ko|\uc5b4}})] + [polite marker ({{lang|ko|\uc694}})]\n|}\n:\"Did [you] go to the store?\" (\"you\" implied in conversation)\n\n{|\n|-\n|'''B''': ||&nbsp;||{{lang|ko|\uc608.}} (or {{lang|ko|\ub124.}})\n|-\n| || ||''ye'' (or ''ne'')\n|-\n| || ||yes\n|}\n:\"Yes.\"\n\n===Speech levels and honorifics===\n{{Main|Korean speech levels|Korean honorifics}}\n\nThe relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean grammar. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in ''[[honorific]]s'', whereas that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in ''speech level''.\n\n====Honorifics====\nWhen talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee, or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences.\n\nHonorifics in traditional Korea were strictly hierarchical. The caste and estate systems possessed patterns and usages much more complex and stratified than those used today. The intricate structure of the Korean honorific system flourished in traditional culture and society. Honorifics in contemporary Korea are now used for people who are psychologically distant. Honorifics are also used for people who are superior in status. For example, older people, teachers, and employers.<ref name=\"Sohn 2006\">{{cite book | last = Sohn | first = Ho-Min | title = Korean Language in Culture and Society | publisher = Twayne Publishers | location = Boston | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-8248-2694-9 |ref = harv}}</ref>\n\n====Speech levels====\nThere are seven verb [[paradigm]]s or [[Korean speech levels|''speech levels'' in Korean]], and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation.<ref>{{cite book |last= Choo|first=Miho |date=2008 |title=Using Korean: A Guide to Contemporary Usage |url= |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=3 |isbn=978-1-139-47139-8}}</ref> Unlike [[honorifics]]\u2014which are used to show respect towards the referent (the person spoken of) \u2014''speech levels'' are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience (the person spoken to). The names of the seven levels are derived from the non-honorific [[Imperative mood|imperative]] form of the verb {{lang|ko|[[wikt:\ud558\ub2e4|\ud558\ub2e4]]}} (''hada'', \"do\") in each level, plus the suffix {{lang|ko|\uccb4}} (\"che\", [[Hanja]]: {{lang|ko|\u9ad4}}), which means \"style\".\n\nThe three levels with high politeness (very formally polite, formally polite, casually polite) are generally grouped together as ''jondaenmal'' ({{lang|ko|\uc874\ub313\ub9d0}}), whereas the two levels with low politeness (formally impolite, casually impolite) are ''banmal'' ({{lang|ko|\ubc18\ub9d0}}) in Korean. The remaining two levels (neutral formality with neutral politeness, high formality with neutral politeness) are neither polite nor impolite.\n\nNowadays, younger-generation speakers no longer feel obligated to lower their usual regard toward the referent. It is common to see younger people talk to their older relatives with banmal ({{lang|ko|\ubc18\ub9d0}}). This is not out of disrespect, but instead it shows the intimacy and the closeness of the relationship between the two speakers. Transformations in social structures and attitudes in today's rapidly changing society have brought about change in the way people speak.<ref name=\"Sohn 2006\" />\n\n==Gender==\nIn general, Korean lacks grammatical gender.  As one of the few exceptions, the third-person singular pronoun has two different forms: \uadf8 ''geu'' (male) and \uadf8\ub140 ''geunyeo'' (female). Before \uadf8\ub140 were invented in need of translating 'she' into Korean, \uadf8 was the only one third-person singular pronoun, and had no grammatical gender.\n\nHowever, one can still find stronger contrasts between the sexes within Korean speech. Some examples of this can be seen in: (1) softer tone used by women in speech; (2) a married woman introducing herself as someone's mother or wife, not with her own name; (3) the presence of gender differences in titles and occupational terms (for example, a ''sajang'' is a company president and ''y\u014fsajang'' is a female company president.); (4) females sometimes using more [[tag question]]s and rising tones in statements, also seen in speech from children.<ref>Cho, Young A.

University of Hawaii Press, 2006. pp. 189\u201398.</ref>\n\nBetween two people of asymmetrical status in a Korean society, people tend to emphasize differences in status for the sake of solidarity. Koreans prefer to use kinship terms, rather than any other terms of reference.<ref>Kim, Minju. \"Cross Adoption of language between different genders: The case of the Korean kinship terms hyeng and enni.\" Proceedings of the Fifth Berkeley Women and Language Conference. Berkeley: Berkeley Women and Language Group. 1999.</ref> In traditional Korean society, women have long been in disadvantaged positions. Korean social structure traditionally was a patriarchically dominated family system that emphasized the maintenance of family lines. This structure has tended to separate the roles of women from those of men.<ref>Palley, Marian Lief. \"Women\u2019s Status in South Korea: Tradition and Change.\" Asian Survey, Vol 30 No. 12. December 1990. pp. 1136\u201353.</ref>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. A significant proportion of the vocabulary, especially words that denote abstract ideas, are [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean words]],<ref name=Sohn>Sohn, Ho-Min.

Sohn (2001) stated 50\u201360%.<ref name=Sohn /> Later, the same author (2006, p.&nbsp;5) gives an even higher estimate of 65%.<ref name=\"Sohn 2006\" /> Jeong Jae-do, one of the compilers of the dictionary ''Urimal Keun Sajeon'', asserts that the proportion is not so high. He points out that Korean dictionaries compiled during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|colonial period]] include many unused Sino-Korean words. In his estimation, the proportion of Sino-Korean vocabulary in the Korean language might be as low as 30%.<ref>{{Cite news|periodical=The Hankyoreh|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/religion/376204.html|date=2009-09-11|accessdate=2009-09-11|script-title=ko:\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub9d0 70%\uac00 \ud55c\uc790\ub9d0? \uc77c\uc81c\uac00 \uc65c\uace1\ud55c \uac70\ub77c\ub124|trans-title=Our language is 70% hanja?

It is similar to that of English \u2014 native English words and Latinate equivalents such as ''water-aqua'', ''fire-flame'', ''sea-marine'', ''two-dual'', ''sun-solar'', ''star-stellar''. Therefore, just like other Korean words, Korean has two sets of [[Korean numerals|numeral systems]]. However, unlike English and Latin which belong to the same Indo-European languages family and bear a certain resemblance, Korean and Chinese are [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetically unrelated]] and the two sets of Korean words differ completely from each other. All Sino-Korean [[morpheme]]s are [[Monosyllabic language|monosyllabic]] as in Chinese, whereas native Korean morphemes can be polysyllabic. The Sino-Korean words were deliberately imported alongside corresponding Chinese characters for a written language and everything was supposed to be written in Hanja, so the coexistence of Sino-Korean would be more thorough and systematic than that of Latinate words in English. To a much lesser extent, some words have also been borrowed from [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] and other languages.<ref>A History of the Korean Language - Lee and Ramsey\n\nhttp://altaica.ru/LIBRARY/KOREAN/Lee%20Ramsey_A%20history%20of%20the%20korean%20language.pdf</ref>\n\nThe vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, approximately 90% of which are from [[English language|English]].<ref name=Sohn /> Many words have also been borrowed from [[European languages|Western languages]] such as [[German language|German]] via [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ({{lang|ko|\uc544\ub974\ubc14\uc774\ud2b8}} (''[[wikt:\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8|areubaiteu]]'') \"part-time job\", {{lang|ko|\uc54c\ub808\ub974\uae30}} (''allereugi'') \"allergy\", {{lang|ko|\uae30\ube0c\uc2a4}} (''gibseu'' or ''gibuseu'') \"plaster cast used for broken bones\"). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]], taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example \"dozen\"&nbsp;> {{lang|ja-Kana|\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9}} ''d\u0101su''&nbsp;> {{lang|ko|\ub2e4\uc2a4}} ''daseu''. Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current \"Hangulization\" rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as \"German(y)\" (see [[Names of Germany#Korean|names of Germany]]), the first part of whose [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] ''Deutschland'' {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u0254\u028f\u032ft\u0361\u0283.lant]}} the Japanese approximated using the [[kanji]] {{lang|ja|\u7368\u9038}} <!-- ky\u016bjitai, no \u72ec please --> ''doitsu'' that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation: {{lang|ko|[[wikt:\u7368|\u7368]]}}&nbsp;''dok'' + {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u9038|\u9038]]}}&nbsp;''il'' = ''[[wikt:\ub3c5\uc77c|Dogil]]''. In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented \"Hangeulizations\" of the countries' endonyms or English names.\n\nBecause of such a prevalence of English in modern South Korean culture and society, [[lexical borrowing]] is inevitable. English-derived Korean, or '[[Konglish]]' ({{lang|ko|\ucf69\uae00\ub9ac\uc26c}}), is increasingly used. The vocabulary of the South Korean dialect of the Korean language is roughly 5% loanwords (excluding Sino-Korean vocabulary).<ref name=\"Sohn 2006\" /> However, due to North Korea's isolation, such influence is lacking in North Korean speech.\n\nKorean uses words adapted from English in ways that may seem strange to native English speakers. For example, ''fighting'' ({{lang|ko|\ud654\uc774\ud305 / \ud30c\uc774\ud305}}) is a term of encouragement like 'come on'/'go (on)' in English. Something that is 'service' ({{lang|ko|\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4}}) is free or 'on the house'. A building referred to as an 'aparteu' ({{lang|ko|\uc544\ud30c\ud2b8}}) is an 'apartment' (but in fact refers to a residence more akin to a condominium) and a type of pencil that is called a 'sharp' ({{lang|ko|\uc0e4\ud504}}) is a mechanical pencil. Like other borrowings, many of these idiosyncrasies, including all the examples listed above, appear to be imported into Korean via Japanese, or influenced by Japanese. Many English words introduced via Japanese pronunciation have been reformed as in \uba5c\ub860 (melon) which was once called \uba54\ub860 (meron) as in Japanese.\n\nNorth Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign influences on the Korean language in the North. In the early years, the North Korean government tried to eliminate Sino-Korean words. Consequently, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which are not in North Korean.\n\n==Writing system==\n[[File:Yeongdong Expressway Entrance Sign in Wonju Interchange.JPG|left|upright=1.36|thumb|The [[Latin alphabet]] used for foreigners in South Korea]]\n{{Korean writing}}\n{{Main|Hangul|Korean Braille|Hanja}}\n{{See also|Hangul consonant and vowel tables}}\n\nBefore the creation of [[Hangul|the modern Korean alphabet]], known as Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl in North Korea and as Hangul in South Korea, people in Korea (known as [[Joseon]] at the time) primarily wrote using [[Classical Chinese]] alongside native phonetic writing systems that predate Hangul by hundreds of years, including [[Idu script|idu]], [[hyangchal]], [[gugyeol]], and gakpil.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hannas|first1=Wm C.|title=Asia's Orthographic Dilemma|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1892-0|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJfv8Iyd2m4C&pg=PA57#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=20 September 2016|language=en|year=1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Chen|first1=Jiangping|title=Multilingual Access and Services for Digital Collections|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-4408-3955-9|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_CpZCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA66#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=20 September 2016|language=en|date=2016-01-18}}</ref><ref name=\"phonetic\">{{cite journal|title=Invest Korea Journal|date=1 January 2005|volume= 23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00a2AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=20 September 2016|publisher=Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency|language=en|quote=They later devised three different systems for writing Korean with Chinese characters: Hyangchal, Gukyeol and Idu.

Korean people in the [[Post-Soviet states|former USSR]] refer to themselves as ''[[Koryo-saram]]'' and/or ''Koryo-in'' (literally, \"[[Names of Korea#Goryeo|Koryo/Goryeo]] person(s)\"), and call the language ''[[Koryo-mal]].''\n\nIn South Korea, the Korean language is referred to by many names including ''hanguk-eo'' (\"Korean language\"), ''hanguk-mal'' (\"Korean speech\") and ''uri-mal'' (\"our language\"). In \"''hanguk-eo''\" and \"''hanguk-mal''\", the first part of the word, \"''hanguk''\" was taken from the name of the [[Korean Empire]] ({{korean|\ub300\ud55c\uc81c\uad6d|\u5927\u97d3\u5e1d\u570b|Daehan Jeguk|labels=no}}).

Korean is also simply referred to as ''guk-eo'', literally \"national language\". This name is based on the same [[Hanja|Han characters]], meaning \"nation\" + \"language\" (\"\u570b\u8a9e\"), that are also used in Taiwan and Japan to refer to their respective national languages.\n\nIn North Korea and [[China]], the language is most often called ''Joseon-mal'', or more formally, ''Joseon-o''. This is taken from the North Korean name for Korea (Joseon), a name retained from the [[Joseon dynasty]] until the proclamation of the [[Korean Empire]], which in turn was annexed by the [[Empire of Japan]].\n\nIn [[mainland China]], following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term ''Ch\u00e1oxi\u01ceny\u01d4'' or the short form ''Ch\u00e1oy\u01d4'' has normally been used to refer to the standard language of North Korea and [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture|Yanbian]], whereas ''H\u00e1ngu\u00f3y\u01d4'' or the short form ''H\u00e1ny\u01d4'' is used to refer to the standard language of South Korea.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}\n\nSome older English sources also use the spelling \"Corea\" to refer to the nation, and its inflected form for the language, culture and people, \"Korea\" becoming more popular in the late 1800s according to Google's NGram English corpus of 2015.<ref name=\"GoogleNGrams\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Korea%2CCorea&year_start=1800&year_end=1950&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2CKorea%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CCorea%3B%2Cc0|title=Google Ngram Viewer}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n\nKorean is considered by most linguists to be a [[language isolate]], though it is commonly included by proponents of the now generally rejected [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] family.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Making of the Korean Language|last=Kim|first=Chin-Wu|publisher=Center for Korean Studies, University of Hawai'i|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> [[Alexander Vovin]] (2015)<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/18764127|title=\uc54c\ud0c0\uc774\ud560\uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 2|last=Vovin|first=Alexander|year=2015|isbn=978-8-955-56053-4|contribution=Korean as a Paleosiberian Language|access-date=2016-11-06}}</ref> notes that Koreanic shares some [[Linguistic typology|typological]] features with the four [[Paleosiberian languages|Paleosiberian]] language families (e.g. lack of phonemic [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] stops, verb [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]], earlier [[ergativity]]), and suggests that it actually has more in common with the various Paleosiberian language family (which is a geographical and areal grouping rather a genetic one) than with the putative [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] group.\n\nThe hypothesis that Korean could be related to [[Japanese language|Japanese]] has had some supporters due to some overlap in vocabulary and similar grammatical features that have been elaborated upon by such researchers as [[Samuel Martin (linguist)|Samuel E.

Also, the doublet ''wo'' meaning \"hemp\" is attested in Western Old Japanese and Southern Ryukyuan languages. It is thus plausible to assume a borrowed term.<ref>Vovin 2008: 211\u201312</ref> (see [[Classification of the Japonic languages]] or [[Comparison of Japanese and Korean]] for further details on a possible relationship.)\n\nAnother lesser-known theory is the [[Dravido-Korean languages]] theory which suggests a relation with Dravidian in India. Some of the common features in the Korean and [[Dravidian languages]] are that they share some similar vocabulary, are agglutinative, and follow the SOV order; in both languages, nominals and adjectives follow the same syntax, particles are post-positional, and modifiers always precede modified words.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Korean Language|publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=29|author=Min-Sohn, Ho |year=2001}}</ref> However, typological similarities such as these could have arisen by chance.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LbmP_1KIQ_8C&pg=PA109 Pozzi & Janhunen & Weiers 2006], p. 109</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Janhunen|first1=Juha|title=The Lost Languages of Koguryo|journal=Journal of Inner and East Asian Studies|date=2005|volume=2-2|pages=65\u201386}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Khitan language]] has many vocabulary items similar to Korean that are not found in Mongolian or Tungusic languages.

The King Sejong Institute was established in response to:\n\n* An increase in the demand for Korean language education;\n* a rapid increase in Korean language education thanks to the spread of [[hallyu]], an increase in international marriage, the expansion of Korean enterprises into overseas markets, and enforcement of employment licensing system;\n* the need for a government-sanctioned Korean language educational institution;\n* the need for general support for overseas Korean language education based on a successful domestic language education program.\n\n===Topik Korea Institute===\nThe Topik Korea Institute is a lifelong educational center affiliated with a variety of Korean universities in Seoul, South Korea, whose aim is to promote Korean language and culture, support local Korean teaching internationally, and facilitate cultural exchanges.\n\nThe institute is sometimes compared to language and culture promotion organizations such as the King Sejong Institute. Unlike that organization, however, Topik Korea Institutes operate within established universities and colleges around the world, providing educational materials.\n\n==Dialects==\n{{Main|Korean dialects|Koreanic languages}}\n[[File:Koreandialects.png|thumb|upright=1.36|Dialects of Korean]]\n\nKorean has numerous small local [[dialect]]s (called ''mal'' ({{lang|ko|\ub9d0}}) [literally \"speech\"], ''saturi'' ({{lang|ko|\uc0ac\ud22c\ub9ac}}), or ''bang'eon'' ({{lang|ko|\ubc29\uc5b8}} in Korean). The [[standard language]] (''pyojun-eo'' or ''pyojun-mal'') of both South Korea and North Korea is based on the dialect of the area around Seoul (which, as Hanyang, was the capital of [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]]-era Korea for 500 years), though the northern standard after the [[Korean War]] has been influenced by the dialect of [[Pyongyang|P'y\u014fngyang]]. All dialects of Korean are similar to each other and largely [[mutually intelligible]] (with the exception of dialect-specific phrases or non-Standard vocabulary unique to dialects), though the [[Jeju dialect|dialect of Jeju Island]] is divergent enough to be sometimes classified as a separate language.<ref>{{cite web|author=Source: Unescopress |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/new_interactive_atlas_adds_two_more_endangered_languages/ |title=New interactive atlas adds two more endangered languages &#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref><ref>David Lightfoot, 1999. ''The development of language: acquisition, change, and evolution''</ref><ref>[[Juha Janhunen|Janhunen, Juha]], 1996. ''Manchuria: an ethnic history''</ref> One of the more salient differences between dialects is the use of tone: speakers of the [[Seoul dialect]] make use of vowel length, whereas speakers of the [[Gyeongsang dialect]] maintain the [[Pitch-accent language|pitch accent]] of Middle Korean. Some dialects are conservative, maintaining Middle Korean sounds (such as ''z, \u03b2, \u0259'') which have been lost from the standard language, whereas others are highly innovative.\n\nThere is substantial evidence for a history of extensive [[dialect levelling]], or even [[convergent evolution]] or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, for example \"[[garlic chives]]\" translated into Gyeongsang dialect {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255\u028c\u014b.\u0261u.d\u0361\u0291i/}} ({{lang|ko|\uc815\uad6c\uc9c0}}) but in Standard Korean, it is {{IPA|/pu\u02d0t\u0361\u0255\u02b0u/}} ({{lang|ko|\ubd80\ucd94}}). This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} See also the [[Japanese\u2013Koguryoic languages]] hypothesis.\n\nNonetheless, the separation of the two Korean states has resulted in increasing differences among the dialects that have emerged over time. Since the allies of the newly-founded nations split the Korean peninsula in half after 1945, the newly formed Korean nations have since borrowed vocabulary extensively from their respective allies. As the Soviet Union helped industrialize North Korea and establish it as a communist state, the North Koreans therefore borrowed a number of Russian terms. Likewise, since the United States helped South Korea extensively to develop militarily, economically, and politically, South Koreans therefore borrowed extensively from English.\n\nThe differences among northern and southern dialects have become so significant that many North Korean defectors reportedly have had great difficulty communicating with South Koreans after having initially settled into South Korea. In response to the diverging vocabularies, an app called Univoca was designed to help North Korean defectors learn South Korean terms by translating them into North Korean ones.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Korean is virtually two languages, and that's a big problem for North Korean defectors|url = http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-05-19/korean-today-virtually-two-languages-and-thats-problem-north-korean-defectors|website = Public Radio International|access-date = 2016-01-18}}</ref> More information can be found on the page [[North\u2013South differences in the Korean language|North-South differences in the Korean language]].\n\nAside from the standard language, there are few clear boundaries between Korean dialects, and they are typically partially grouped according to the [[regions of Korea]].{{citation needed|reason=This looks like something Korean popular culture tends to do for convenience, regardless of what linguists actually think.

It disappeared before {{IPA|[j]}}, and otherwise became {{IPA|/n/}}. However, the inflow of western [[Konglish|loanwords]] changed the trend, and now word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either {{IPA|[\u027e]}} or {{IPA|[l]}}. The traditional prohibition of word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} became a morphological rule called \"initial law\" ({{lang|ko|\ub450\uc74c\ubc95\uce59}}) in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} in North Korea.\n\nAll [[obstruent]]s (plosives, affricates, fricatives) at the end of a word are pronounced with [[no audible release]], {{IPA|[p\u031a, t\u031a, k\u031a]}}.\n\nPlosive stops {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} become nasal stops {{IPA|[m, n, \u014b]}} before nasal stops.\n\n[[Hangul]] spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.\n\nOne difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial {{IPA|[\u027e]}}, and initial {{IPA|[n]}}. For example,\n* \"labor\" \u2013 north: '''''r'''odong'' ({{lang|ko|\ub85c\ub3d9}}), south: '''''n'''odong'' ({{lang|ko|\ub178\ub3d9}})\n* \"history\" \u2013 north: '''''ry'''eoksa'' ({{lang|ko|\ub825\uc0ac}}), south: '''''y'''eoksa'' ({{lang|ko|\uc5ed\uc0ac}})\n* \"female\" \u2013 north: '''''ny'''eoja'' ({{lang|ko|\ub140\uc790}}), south: '''''y'''eoja'' ({{lang|ko|\uc5ec\uc790}})\n\n===Morphophonemics===\n{{Main|Morphophonology}}\nGrammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds.

The Korean language is traditionally considered to have nine parts of speech. For details, see [[Korean parts of speech]]. Modifiers generally precede the modified words, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]], but the verb is the only required and immovable element and [[word order]] is highly flexible, as in many other agglutinative languages.\n\n{|\n|-\n|'''A''':||&nbsp;||{{lang|ko|\uac00\uac8c\uc5d0}}|| &nbsp; ||{{lang|ko|\uac00\uc168\uc5b4\uc694?}}\n|-\n| || ||gage-e|| ||''ga-syeo-sseo-yo''\n|-\n| || ||store + [location marker ({{lang|ko|\uc5d0}})]|| ||[go (verb root) ({{lang|ko|\uac00}})] + [honorific ({{lang|ko|\uc2dc}})] + [conjugated (contraction rule)({{lang|ko|\uc5b4}})] + [past ({{lang|ko|\u3146}})] + [conjunctive ({{lang|ko|\uc5b4}})] + [polite marker ({{lang|ko|\uc694}})]\n|}\n:\"Did [you] go to the store?\" (\"you\" implied in conversation)\n\n{|\n|-\n|'''B''': ||&nbsp;||{{lang|ko|\uc608.}} (or {{lang|ko|\ub124.}})\n|-\n| || ||''ye'' (or ''ne'')\n|-\n| || ||yes\n|}\n:\"Yes.\"\n\n===Speech levels and honorifics===\n{{Main|Korean speech levels|Korean honorifics}}\n\nThe relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean grammar. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in ''[[honorific]]s'', whereas that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in ''speech level''.\n\n====Honorifics====\nWhen talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee, or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences.\n\nHonorifics in traditional Korea were strictly hierarchical. The caste and estate systems possessed patterns and usages much more complex and stratified than those used today. The intricate structure of the Korean honorific system flourished in traditional culture and society. Honorifics in contemporary Korea are now used for people who are psychologically distant. Honorifics are also used for people who are superior in status. For example, older people, teachers, and employers.<ref name=\"Sohn 2006\">{{cite book | last = Sohn | first = Ho-Min | title = Korean Language in Culture and Society | publisher = Twayne Publishers | location = Boston | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-8248-2694-9 |ref = harv}}</ref>\n\n====Speech levels====\nThere are seven verb [[paradigm]]s or [[Korean speech levels|''speech levels'' in Korean]], and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation.<ref>{{cite book |last= Choo|first=Miho |date=2008 |title=Using Korean: A Guide to Contemporary Usage |url= |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=3 |isbn=978-1-139-47139-8}}</ref> Unlike [[honorifics]]\u2014which are used to show respect towards the referent (the person spoken of) \u2014''speech levels'' are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience (the person spoken to). The names of the seven levels are derived from the non-honorific [[Imperative mood|imperative]] form of the verb {{lang|ko|[[wikt:\ud558\ub2e4|\ud558\ub2e4]]}} (''hada'', \"do\") in each level, plus the suffix {{lang|ko|\uccb4}} (\"che\", [[Hanja]]: {{lang|ko|\u9ad4}}), which means \"style\".\n\nThe three levels with high politeness (very formally polite, formally polite, casually polite) are generally grouped together as ''jondaenmal'' ({{lang|ko|\uc874\ub313\ub9d0}}), whereas the two levels with low politeness (formally impolite, casually impolite) are ''banmal'' ({{lang|ko|\ubc18\ub9d0}}) in Korean. The remaining two levels (neutral formality with neutral politeness, high formality with neutral politeness) are neither polite nor impolite.\n\nNowadays, younger-generation speakers no longer feel obligated to lower their usual regard toward the referent. It is common to see younger people talk to their older relatives with banmal ({{lang|ko|\ubc18\ub9d0}}). This is not out of disrespect, but instead it shows the intimacy and the closeness of the relationship between the two speakers. Transformations in social structures and attitudes in today's rapidly changing society have brought about change in the way people speak.<ref name=\"Sohn 2006\" />\n\n==Gender==\nIn general, Korean lacks grammatical gender.  As one of the few exceptions, the third-person singular pronoun has two different forms: \uadf8 ''geu'' (male) and \uadf8\ub140 ''geunyeo'' (female). Before \uadf8\ub140 were invented in need of translating 'she' into Korean, \uadf8 was the only one third-person singular pronoun, and had no grammatical gender.\n\nHowever, one can still find stronger contrasts between the sexes within Korean speech. Some examples of this can be seen in: (1) softer tone used by women in speech; (2) a married woman introducing herself as someone's mother or wife, not with her own name; (3) the presence of gender differences in titles and occupational terms (for example, a ''sajang'' is a company president and ''y\u014fsajang'' is a female company president.); (4) females sometimes using more [[tag question]]s and rising tones in statements, also seen in speech from children.<ref>Cho, Young A.

University of Hawaii Press, 2006. pp. 189\u201398.</ref>\n\nBetween two people of asymmetrical status in a Korean society, people tend to emphasize differences in status for the sake of solidarity. Koreans prefer to use kinship terms, rather than any other terms of reference.<ref>Kim, Minju. \"Cross Adoption of language between different genders: The case of the Korean kinship terms hyeng and enni.\" Proceedings of the Fifth Berkeley Women and Language Conference.

December 1990. pp. 1136\u201353.</ref>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. A significant proportion of the vocabulary, especially words that denote abstract ideas, are [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean words]],<ref name=Sohn>Sohn, Ho-Min. ''The Korean Language'' (Section 1.5.3 \"Korean vocabulary\", pp. 12\u201313), Cambridge University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-521-36943-6}}.</ref> either\n* directly borrowed from [[written Chinese]], or\n* coined in Korea or Japan using [[Chinese characters]],\n\nThe exact proportion of Sino-Korean vocabulary is a matter of debate. Sohn (2001) stated 50\u201360%.<ref name=Sohn /> Later, the same author (2006, p.&nbsp;5) gives an even higher estimate of 65%.<ref name=\"Sohn 2006\" /> Jeong Jae-do, one of the compilers of the dictionary ''Urimal Keun Sajeon'', asserts that the proportion is not so high. He points out that Korean dictionaries compiled during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|colonial period]] include many unused Sino-Korean words. In his estimation, the proportion of Sino-Korean vocabulary in the Korean language might be as low as 30%.<ref>{{Cite news|periodical=The Hankyoreh|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/religion/376204.html|date=2009-09-11|accessdate=2009-09-11|script-title=ko:\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub9d0 70%\uac00 \ud55c\uc790\ub9d0? \uc77c\uc81c\uac00 \uc65c\uace1\ud55c \uac70\ub77c\ub124|trans-title=Our language is 70% hanja?

It is similar to that of English \u2014 native English words and Latinate equivalents such as ''water-aqua'', ''fire-flame'', ''sea-marine'', ''two-dual'', ''sun-solar'', ''star-stellar''. Therefore, just like other Korean words, Korean has two sets of [[Korean numerals|numeral systems]]. However, unlike English and Latin which belong to the same Indo-European languages family and bear a certain resemblance, Korean and Chinese are [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetically unrelated]] and the two sets of Korean words differ completely from each other. All Sino-Korean [[morpheme]]s are [[Monosyllabic language|monosyllabic]] as in Chinese, whereas native Korean morphemes can be polysyllabic. The Sino-Korean words were deliberately imported alongside corresponding Chinese characters for a written language and everything was supposed to be written in Hanja, so the coexistence of Sino-Korean would be more thorough and systematic than that of Latinate words in English. To a much lesser extent, some words have also been borrowed from [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] and other languages.<ref>A History of the Korean Language - Lee and Ramsey\n\nhttp://altaica.ru/LIBRARY/KOREAN/Lee%20Ramsey_A%20history%20of%20the%20korean%20language.pdf</ref>\n\nThe vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, approximately 90% of which are from [[English language|English]].<ref name=Sohn /> Many words have also been borrowed from [[European languages|Western languages]] such as [[German language|German]] via [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ({{lang|ko|\uc544\ub974\ubc14\uc774\ud2b8}} (''[[wikt:\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8|areubaiteu]]'') \"part-time job\", {{lang|ko|\uc54c\ub808\ub974\uae30}} (''allereugi'') \"allergy\", {{lang|ko|\uae30\ube0c\uc2a4}} (''gibseu'' or ''gibuseu'') \"plaster cast used for broken bones\"). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]], taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example \"dozen\"&nbsp;> {{lang|ja-Kana|\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9}} ''d\u0101su''&nbsp;> {{lang|ko|\ub2e4\uc2a4}} ''daseu''. Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current \"Hangulization\" rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as \"German(y)\" (see [[Names of Germany#Korean|names of Germany]]), the first part of whose [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] ''Deutschland'' {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u0254\u028f\u032ft\u0361\u0283.lant]}} the Japanese approximated using the [[kanji]] {{lang|ja|\u7368\u9038}} <!-- ky\u016bjitai, no \u72ec please --> ''doitsu'' that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation: {{lang|ko|[[wikt:\u7368|\u7368]]}}&nbsp;''dok'' + {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u9038|\u9038]]}}&nbsp;''il'' = ''[[wikt:\ub3c5\uc77c|Dogil]]''. In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented \"Hangeulizations\" of the countries' endonyms or English names.\n\nBecause of such a prevalence of English in modern South Korean culture and society, [[lexical borrowing]] is inevitable. English-derived Korean, or '[[Konglish]]' ({{lang|ko|\ucf69\uae00\ub9ac\uc26c}}), is increasingly used. The vocabulary of the South Korean dialect of the Korean language is roughly 5% loanwords (excluding Sino-Korean vocabulary).<ref name=\"Sohn 2006\" /> However, due to North Korea's isolation, such influence is lacking in North Korean speech.\n\nKorean uses words adapted from English in ways that may seem strange to native English speakers. For example, ''fighting'' ({{lang|ko|\ud654\uc774\ud305 / \ud30c\uc774\ud305}}) is a term of encouragement like 'come on'/'go (on)' in English. Something that is 'service' ({{lang|ko|\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4}}) is free or 'on the house'. A building referred to as an 'aparteu' ({{lang|ko|\uc544\ud30c\ud2b8}}) is an 'apartment' (but in fact refers to a residence more akin to a condominium) and a type of pencil that is called a 'sharp' ({{lang|ko|\uc0e4\ud504}}) is a mechanical pencil. Like other borrowings, many of these idiosyncrasies, including all the examples listed above, appear to be imported into Korean via Japanese, or influenced by Japanese. Many English words introduced via Japanese pronunciation have been reformed as in \uba5c\ub860 (melon) which was once called \uba54\ub860 (meron) as in Japanese.\n\nNorth Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign influences on the Korean language in the North. In the early years, the North Korean government tried to eliminate Sino-Korean words. Consequently, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which are not in North Korean.\n\n==Writing system==\n[[File:Yeongdong Expressway Entrance Sign in Wonju Interchange.JPG|left|upright=1.36|thumb|The [[Latin alphabet]] used for foreigners in South Korea]]\n{{Korean writing}}\n{{Main|Hangul|Korean Braille|Hanja}}\n{{See also|Hangul consonant and vowel tables}}\n\nBefore the creation of [[Hangul|the modern Korean alphabet]], known as Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl in North Korea and as Hangul in South Korea, people in Korea (known as [[Joseon]] at the time) primarily wrote using [[Classical Chinese]] alongside native phonetic writing systems that predate Hangul by hundreds of years, including [[Idu script|idu]], [[hyangchal]], [[gugyeol]], and gakpil.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hannas|first1=Wm C.|title=Asia's Orthographic Dilemma|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1892-0|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJfv8Iyd2m4C&pg=PA57#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=20 September 2016|language=en|year=1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Chen|first1=Jiangping|title=Multilingual Access and Services for Digital Collections|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-4408-3955-9|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_CpZCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA66#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=20 September 2016|language=en|date=2016-01-18}}</ref><ref name=\"phonetic\">{{cite journal|title=Invest Korea Journal|date=1 January 2005|volume= 23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00a2AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=20 September 2016|publisher=Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency|language=en|quote=They later devised three different systems for writing Korean with Chinese characters: Hyangchal, Gukyeol and Idu.

So, while the word ''bibimbap'' is written as eight characters in a row in English, in Korean it is written \ube44\ube54\ubc25, as three syllable blocks in a row. The syllable blocks are then written left to right, top to bottom.\n\nModern Korean is written with spaces between words, a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese (except when Japanese is written exclusively in [[hiragana]], as in children's books). [[Korean punctuation]] marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns, from top to bottom, right to left, but it is now usually written in rows, from left to right, top to bottom.\n\n==Differences between North Korean and South Korean==\n{{Main|North\u2013South differences in the Korean language}}\nThe Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary.<ref>Kanno, Hiroomi (ed.) / Society for Korean Linguistics in Japan (1987).
