Entertainment]]. Located in [[Burbank, California]], the studio primarily produces and develops animated programs and shorts for [[Cartoon Network]]. In the 2010s, their programs began to expand into their sister companies [[Adult Swim]] and [[HBO Max]]. The company has only produced one theatrically released film, ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]'', which was distributed by its parent company, [[Warner Bros. Pictures]].\n\nThe actual animation service for their productions is done overseas, mostly in [[South Korea]] at [[Digital eMation]], [[Saerom Animation]], [[Rough Draft Studios|Rough Draft Korea]], and [[Sunmin Image Pictures]], with [[pre-production]] and [[post-production]] being United States-based.\n\n==History==\nCartoon Network Studios originated as a division of [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Inc.]] that focused on producing original programming for [[Cartoon Network]], including ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'', ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', and ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''. Following the 1996 merger of Hanna-Barbera's parent, [[Turner Broadcasting System]] with [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]], and after being located on Cahuenga Boulevard in [[Los Angeles]] since 1963, the Hanna-Barbera studio, its archives, and its extensive animation art collection, were relocated in 1998 to [[Sherman Oaks Galleria]] in [[Sherman Oaks, California]], where [[Warner Bros. Animation]] was located. This relocation was executed by its chief executive, [[Jean MacCurdy]].<ref name=\"seibert\">{{cite web|url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/12/18/hanna-barbera-studios-1997/|title=Hanna-Barbera Studios, 1997|first=Fred|last=Seibert|date=December 18, 2007|work=Frederator Blogs|publisher=[[Frederator Studios]]|accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref> After Hanna-Barbera was completely folded into Warner Bros.

Entertainment]]. Located in [[Burbank, California]], the studio primarily produces and develops animated programs and shorts for [[Cartoon Network]]. In the 2010s, their programs began to expand into their sister companies [[Adult Swim]] and [[HBO Max]]. The company has only produced one theatrically released film, ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]'', which was distributed by its parent company, [[Warner Bros. Pictures]].\n\nThe actual animation service for their productions is done overseas, mostly in [[South Korea]] at [[Digital eMation]], [[Saerom Animation]], [[Rough Draft Studios|Rough Draft Korea]], and [[Sunmin Image Pictures]], with [[pre-production]] and [[post-production]] being United States-based.\n\n==History==\nCartoon Network Studios originated as a division of [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Inc.]] that focused on producing original programming for [[Cartoon Network]], including ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'', ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', and ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''. Following the 1996 merger of Hanna-Barbera's parent, [[Turner Broadcasting System]] with [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]], and after being located on Cahuenga Boulevard in [[Los Angeles]] since 1963, the Hanna-Barbera studio, its archives, and its extensive animation art collection, were relocated in 1998 to [[Sherman Oaks Galleria]] in [[Sherman Oaks, California]], where [[Warner Bros. Animation]] was located. This relocation was executed by its chief executive, [[Jean MacCurdy]].<ref name=\"seibert\">{{cite web|url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/12/18/hanna-barbera-studios-1997/|title=Hanna-Barbera Studios, 1997|first=Fred|last=Seibert|date=December 18, 2007|work=Frederator Blogs|publisher=[[Frederator Studios]]|accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref> After Hanna-Barbera was completely folded into Warner Bros.

The studio's first live action series ''[[Tower Prep]]'' would arrive in 2010. Former [[New Line Television]] [[Reality television|reality]] producer Mark Costa was hired to oversee the projects and Cartoon Network Studios' live action production company Alive and Kicking, Inc.. ''[[Incredible Crew]]'' was the last series in that genre the studio produced for Cartoon Network. Despite the failure of live action on the channel, the studio's infrastructure was retained to produce live action fare for sibling programming block Adult Swim, identifying on-air as Alive and Kicking, along with two other companies (Rent Now Productions and Factual Productions), instead of using the Cartoon Network Studios banner.\n\nIn 2010, ''[[Adventure Time]]'' premiered on Cartoon Network.

She is a professor [[Emeritus|emerita]] at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]. Ideologically a [[Marxism|Marxist]], Davis was a member of the [[Communist Party USA]] until 1991, after which she joined the breakaway [[Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism]]. She is the author of over ten books on [[Social class|class]], [[feminism]], and the [[Incarceration in the United States|U.S. prison system]].\n\nBorn to an [[African American]] family in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], Davis studied French at [[Brandeis University]] and philosophy at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] in [[West Germany]]. Studying under the philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]], a prominent figure in the [[Frankfurt School]] of Marxism, Davis became increasingly interested in [[far-left politics]]. Returning to the U.S., she studied at the [[University of California, San Diego]] before moving to [[East Germany]], where she gained a doctorate at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. Back in the U.S., she joined the Communist Party and, as a [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminist]], involved herself in a range of leftist causes, including the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist movement]], the [[Black Panther Party]], and the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|campaign against]] the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1969 she was hired as an acting assistant professor of philosophy at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). UCLA's governing [[Regents of the University of California|Board of Regents]] soon fired her due to her Communist Party membership; after a court ruled this illegal, the university fired her again, this time for her use of inflammatory language. \n\nIn 1970, firearms registered to Davis were used in an [[Marin County courthouse incident|armed takeover of a courtroom]] in [[Marin County, California]], in which four people were killed. She was prosecuted for three capital felonies, including conspiracy to murder. After over a year in jail, she was acquitted of the charges in 1972. She continued both her academic work and her domestic activism. In the 1980s she was professor of [[Ethnic Studies|ethnic studies]] at [[San Francisco State University]]. Much of her work focused on [[Prison abolition movement|the abolition of prisons]] and in 1997 she co-founded [[Critical Resistance]], an organization working to abolish the [[prison\u2013industrial complex]]. During the 1970s she visited [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]]-governed countries and during the 1980s was twice the Communist Party's candidate for [[U.S. Vice President|Vice President]]. In 1991, amid the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], she left the party and joined the breakaway Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. Also in 1991, she joined the [[Feminist Studies|feminist studies]] department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she became department director before retiring in 2008. Since then she has continued to write and remained active in movements such as [[Occupy movement|Occupy]] and the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] campaign.\n\nPraised by many Marxists and others on the far left, Davis has received various awards, including the [[Lenin Peace Prize]]. She has also sustained criticism<!-- Criticism by who? --> for her support for political violence and her refusal to advocate for prisoners in Marxist-Leninist countries.<!-- What prisoners and which countries? -->\n\n==Early life==\nAngela Davis was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Her family lived in the \"Dynamite Hill\" neighborhood, which was marked in the 1950s by the bombings of houses in an attempt to intimidate and drive out middle-class blacks who had moved there. Davis occasionally spent time on her uncle's farm and with friends in New York City.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela Yvonne|title=Angela Davis: An Autobiography|date=March 1989|publisher=International Publishers|location=New York City|isbn=0-7178-0667-7|chapter=Rocks}}</ref> She had two brothers, [[Ben Davis (American football)|Ben]] and Reginald, and a sister, Fania.

Tuggle School, a segregated black elementary school, and later, Parker Annex, a middle-school branch of [[A. H. Parker High School|Parker High School]] in Birmingham. During this time, Davis's mother, Sallye Bell Davis, was a national officer and leading organizer of the [[Southern Negro Youth Congress]], an organization influenced by the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] aimed at building alliances among African Americans in the South.

She was accepted by the [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] Junior Year in France Program. Classes were initially at [[Biarritz]] and later at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. In Paris, she and other students lived with a French family. She was in Biarritz when she learned of the 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|Birmingham church bombing]], committed by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], in which four black girls were killed. She grieved deeply as she was personally acquainted with the victims.<ref name=\"Waters\"/>\n\nNearing completion of her degree in French, Davis realized her major interest was philosophy. She was particularly interested in Marcuse's ideas. On returning to Brandeis, she sat in on his course. Marcuse, she wrote in her autobiography, was approachable and helpful. She began making plans to attend the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] for [[Graduate school|graduate work]] in philosophy. In 1965, she graduated [[magna cum laude]], a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]].<ref name=\"Waters\"/>\n\n===University of Frankfurt===\n[[File:Angela_Davis_at_Goethe_University_in_Frankfurt,_Germany.tif|thumb|As a student at the Institute of Social Research at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany.

After visiting [[East Berlin]] during the annual [[May Day#Germany|May Day celebration]], she felt that the East German government was dealing better with the residual effects of [[fascism]] than were the [[West Germany|West Germans]].

In recent works, she has argued that the US prison system more closely resembles a new form of slavery than a criminal justice system. According to Davis, between the late 19th century and the mid-20th century, the number of prisons in the United States sharply increased but crime rates continued to fall. She argues that racism in American society during this time was demonstrated by the disproportionate share of the African-American population who were incarcerated. \"What is effective or just about this 'justice' system?\" she urged people to ask.<ref name=\"Prison Abolishment\">{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela|title=Are prisons Obsolete?|year=2003|publisher=Open Media Series|location=Canada}}</ref>\n\nDavis has lectured at [[Rutgers University]], [[San Francisco State University]], [[Stanford University]], [[Smith College]], [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Brown University]], [[Syracuse University]], and other schools. As most of her teaching is at the graduate level, she says that she concentrates more on posing questions that encourage development of [[critical thinking]] than on imparting knowledge.<ref name=\"BookTV\"/>\n\nAs early as 1969, Davis began public speaking engagements. She expressed her opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], racism, sexism, and the prison\u2013industrial complex, and her support of gay rights and other social justice movements. In 1969, she blamed [[imperialism]] for the troubles oppressed populations suffer: \n<blockquote>We are facing a common enemy and that enemy is Yankee Imperialism, which is killing us both here and abroad. Now I think anyone who would try to separate those struggles, anyone who would say that in order to consolidate an anti-war movement, we have to leave all of these other outlying issues out of the picture, is playing right into the hands of the enemy, she declared.<ref name=\"Speech-Vietnam\">{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Angela|title=Speech by Angela Davis at a Black Panther Rally in Bobby Hutton Park|url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2009/04/15/18589458.php|work=East Bay|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2001 she publicly spoke against the war on terror following the [[9/11 attacks]], continued to criticize the prison\u2013industrial complex, and discussed the broken immigration system. She said that to solve social justice issues, people must \"hone their critical skills, develop them and implement them.\" Later, in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, she declared that the \"horrendous situation in New Orleans\" was due to the country's structural racism, capitalism, and imperialism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JKENb33U4E|work=YouTube|title=Angela Davis making a live public speech|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n[[File:Angela-Davis-Mar-28-2006.jpg|thumb|right|Davis at the University of Alberta, March 28, 2006.]]\nDavis opposed the 1995 [[Million Man March]], arguing that the exclusion of women from this event promoted [[male chauvinism]]. She said that [[Louis Farrakhan]] and other organizers appeared to prefer that women take subordinate roles in society.

activist, philosopher, academic, and author. She is a professor [[Emeritus|emerita]] at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]. Ideologically a [[Marxism|Marxist]], Davis was a member of the [[Communist Party USA]] until 1991, after which she joined the breakaway [[Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism]]. She is the author of over ten books on [[Social class|class]], [[feminism]], and the [[Incarceration in the United States|U.S. prison system]].\n\nBorn to an [[African American]] family in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], Davis studied French at [[Brandeis University]] and philosophy at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] in [[West Germany]]. Studying under the philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]], a prominent figure in the [[Frankfurt School]] of Marxism, Davis became increasingly interested in [[far-left politics]]. Returning to the U.S., she studied at the [[University of California, San Diego]] before moving to [[East Germany]], where she gained a doctorate at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. Back in the U.S., she joined the Communist Party and, as a [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminist]], involved herself in a range of leftist causes, including the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist movement]], the [[Black Panther Party]], and the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|campaign against]] the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1969 she was hired as an acting assistant professor of philosophy at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). UCLA's governing [[Regents of the University of California|Board of Regents]] soon fired her due to her Communist Party membership; after a court ruled this illegal, the university fired her again, this time for her use of inflammatory language. \n\nIn 1970, firearms registered to Davis were used in an [[Marin County courthouse incident|armed takeover of a courtroom]] in [[Marin County, California]], in which four people were killed. She was prosecuted for three capital felonies, including conspiracy to murder. After over a year in jail, she was acquitted of the charges in 1972. She continued both her academic work and her domestic activism. In the 1980s she was professor of [[Ethnic Studies|ethnic studies]] at [[San Francisco State University]]. Much of her work focused on [[Prison abolition movement|the abolition of prisons]] and in 1997 she co-founded [[Critical Resistance]], an organization working to abolish the [[prison\u2013industrial complex]]. During the 1970s she visited [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]]-governed countries and during the 1980s was twice the Communist Party's candidate for [[U.S. Vice President|Vice President]]. In 1991, amid the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], she left the party and joined the breakaway Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. Also in 1991, she joined the [[Feminist Studies|feminist studies]] department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she became department director before retiring in 2008. Since then she has continued to write and remained active in movements such as [[Occupy movement|Occupy]] and the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] campaign.\n\nPraised by many Marxists and others on the far left, Davis has received various awards, including the [[Lenin Peace Prize]]. She has also sustained criticism<!-- Criticism by who? --> for her support for political violence and her refusal to advocate for prisoners in Marxist-Leninist countries.<!-- What prisoners and which countries? -->\n\n==Early life==\nAngela Davis was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Her family lived in the \"Dynamite Hill\" neighborhood, which was marked in the 1950s by the bombings of houses in an attempt to intimidate and drive out middle-class blacks who had moved there. Davis occasionally spent time on her uncle's farm and with friends in New York City.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela Yvonne|title=Angela Davis: An Autobiography|date=March 1989|publisher=International Publishers|location=New York City|isbn=0-7178-0667-7|chapter=Rocks}}</ref> She had two brothers, [[Ben Davis (American football)|Ben]] and Reginald, and a sister, Fania.

Tuggle School, a segregated black elementary school, and later, Parker Annex, a middle-school branch of [[A. H. Parker High School|Parker High School]] in Birmingham. During this time, Davis's mother, Sallye Bell Davis, was a national officer and leading organizer of the [[Southern Negro Youth Congress]], an organization influenced by the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] aimed at building alliances among African Americans in the South.

She was accepted by the [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] Junior Year in France Program. Classes were initially at [[Biarritz]] and later at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. In Paris, she and other students lived with a French family. She was in Biarritz when she learned of the 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|Birmingham church bombing]], committed by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], in which four black girls were killed. She grieved deeply as she was personally acquainted with the victims.<ref name=\"Waters\"/>\n\nNearing completion of her degree in French, Davis realized her major interest was philosophy. She was particularly interested in Marcuse's ideas. On returning to Brandeis, she sat in on his course. Marcuse, she wrote in her autobiography, was approachable and helpful. She began making plans to attend the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] for [[Graduate school|graduate work]] in philosophy. In 1965, she graduated [[magna cum laude]], a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]].<ref name=\"Waters\"/>\n\n===University of Frankfurt===\n[[File:Angela_Davis_at_Goethe_University_in_Frankfurt,_Germany.tif|thumb|As a student at the Institute of Social Research at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany.

After visiting [[East Berlin]] during the annual [[May Day#Germany|May Day celebration]], she felt that the East German government was dealing better with the residual effects of [[fascism]] than were the [[West Germany|West Germans]]. Many of her roommates were active in the radical [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund|Socialist German Student Union (SDS)]], and Davis participated in some SDS actions.

In recent works, she has argued that the US prison system more closely resembles a new form of slavery than a criminal justice system. According to Davis, between the late 19th century and the mid-20th century, the number of prisons in the United States sharply increased but crime rates continued to fall. She argues that racism in American society during this time was demonstrated by the disproportionate share of the African-American population who were incarcerated. \"What is effective or just about this 'justice' system?\" she urged people to ask.<ref name=\"Prison Abolishment\">{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela|title=Are prisons Obsolete?|year=2003|publisher=Open Media Series|location=Canada}}</ref>\n\nDavis has lectured at [[Rutgers University]], [[San Francisco State University]], [[Stanford University]], [[Smith College]], [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Brown University]], [[Syracuse University]], and other schools.

She expressed her opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], racism, sexism, and the prison\u2013industrial complex, and her support of gay rights and other social justice movements.

For example, the [[mitochondrial matrix]] separates the [[mitochondrion]] into many compartments.\n\nIn the [[eukaryotic cell]], the cytosol is surrounded by the [[cell membrane]] and is part of the [[cytoplasm]], which also comprises the mitochondria, [[plastid]]s, and other [[organelle]]s (but not their internal fluids and structures); the [[cell nucleus]] is separate. The cytosol is thus a liquid matrix around the organelles. In [[prokaryotes]], most of the chemical reactions of [[metabolism]] take place in the cytosol, while a few take place in membranes or in the [[periplasmic space]]. In eukaryotes, while many [[metabolic pathway]]s still occur in the cytosol, others take place within organelles.\n\nThe cytosol is a complex mixture of substances dissolved in water. Although water forms the large majority of the cytosol, its structure and properties within cells is not well understood. The concentrations of [[ion]]s such as [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] are different in the cytosol than in the [[extracellular fluid]]; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as [[osmoregulation]], [[cell signaling]], and the generation of [[action potentials]] in excitable cells such as endocrine, nerve and muscle cells. The cytosol also contains large amounts of [[macromolecule]]s, which can alter how molecules behave, through [[macromolecular crowding]].\n\nAlthough it was once thought to be a simple solution of molecules, the cytosol has multiple levels of organization. These include [[diffusion|concentration gradient]]s of small molecules such as [[calcium]], large complexes of [[enzyme]]s that act together and take part in [[metabolic pathway]]s, and [[protein complex]]es such as [[proteasome]]s and [[carboxysome]]s that enclose and separate parts of the cytosol.\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe term \"cytosol\" was first introduced in 1965 by H. A. Lardy, and initially referred to the liquid that was produced by breaking  cells apart and pelleting all the insoluble components by [[Ultracentrifuge|ultracentrifugation]].<ref>Lardy, H. A. 1965.

For example, the [[mitochondrial matrix]] separates the [[mitochondrion]] into many compartments.\n\nIn the [[eukaryotic cell]], the cytosol is surrounded by the [[cell membrane]] and is part of the [[cytoplasm]], which also comprises the mitochondria, [[plastid]]s, and other [[organelle]]s (but not their internal fluids and structures); the [[cell nucleus]] is separate. The cytosol is thus a liquid matrix around the organelles. In [[prokaryotes]], most of the chemical reactions of [[metabolism]] take place in the cytosol, while a few take place in membranes or in the [[periplasmic space]]. In eukaryotes, while many [[metabolic pathway]]s still occur in the cytosol, others take place within organelles.\n\nThe cytosol is a complex mixture of substances dissolved in water. Although water forms the large majority of the cytosol, its structure and properties within cells is not well understood. The concentrations of [[ion]]s such as [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] are different in the cytosol than in the [[extracellular fluid]]; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as [[osmoregulation]], [[cell signaling]], and the generation of [[action potentials]] in excitable cells such as endocrine, nerve and muscle cells. The cytosol also contains large amounts of [[macromolecule]]s, which can alter how molecules behave, through [[macromolecular crowding]].\n\nAlthough it was once thought to be a simple solution of molecules, the cytosol has multiple levels of organization. These include [[diffusion|concentration gradient]]s of small molecules such as [[calcium]], large complexes of [[enzyme]]s that act together and take part in [[metabolic pathway]]s, and [[protein complex]]es such as [[proteasome]]s and [[carboxysome]]s that enclose and separate parts of the cytosol.\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe term \"cytosol\" was first introduced in 1965 by H.

In 1016, the kingdom became part of the [[North Sea Empire]] of [[Cnut the Great]], a personal union between [[England]], [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]].  The [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at [[Winchester]] to [[Westminster]], and the [[City of London]] quickly established itself as England's largest and principal commercial centre.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bkGpFhiPtIEC&lpg=PA430&dq=History%20of%20London&pg=PA363#v=onepage&q&f=false ''London, 800\u20131216: The Shaping of a City''], \"''...rivalry between City and government, between a commercial capital in the City and the political capital of quite a different empire in Westminster.''\", accessed November 2013.</ref>\n\nHistories of the kingdom of England from the [[Norman conquest]] of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties: [[Norman England|Norman]] 1066\u20131154, [[Plantagenet era|Plantagenet]] 1154\u20131485, [[Tudor period|Tudor]] 1485\u20131603 and [[Stuart period|Stuart]] 1603\u20131707 (interrupted by the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] of 1649\u20131660).\nDynastically, all [[kings of England|English monarchs]] after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans; the distinction of the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenets]] is merely conventional, beginning with [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (reigned 1154\u20131189) as from that time, the [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin kings]] became \"more English in nature\"; the houses of [[House of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[House of York|York]] are both Plantagenet cadet branches, the [[Tudor dynasty]] claimed descent from [[Edward III]] via [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset|John Beaufort]] and [[James VI and I]] of the [[House of Stuart]] claimed descent from [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] via [[Margaret Tudor]].\n\nThe completion of the [[conquest of Wales by Edward I]] in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown. Edward III (reigned 1327\u20131377) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government\u2014in particular the evolution of the [[English parliament]].  From the 1340s the kings of England also [[English claims to the French throne|laid claim]] to the crown of [[kingdom of France|France]], but after the [[Hundred Years' War]] and the outbreak of the [[Wars of the Roses]] in 1455, the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent, except for [[Pale of Calais|Calais]]. After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses, the [[Tudor dynasty]] ruled during the [[English Renaissance]] and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper, achieving the full union of England and the [[Principality of Wales]] [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542|in 1542]]. [[Henry VIII]] oversaw the [[English Reformation]], and his daughter [[Elizabeth I]] (reigned 1558\u20131603) the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]], meanwhile establishing England as a [[great power]] and laying the foundations of the [[British Empire]] by claiming possessions in the [[English overseas possessions|New World]].\n\nFrom the accession of [[James VI and I]] in 1603, the [[Stuart dynasty]] ruled England in [[Union of the Crowns|personal union]] with [[kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]. Under the Stuarts, the kingdom plunged into [[English Civil War|civil war]], which culminated in the [[execution of Charles I]] in 1649. The monarchy returned in 1660, but the Civil War had established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without the consent of Parliament. This concept became legally established as part of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.\nFrom this time the kingdom of England, as well as its successor state the United Kingdom, functioned in effect as a [[constitutional monarchy]].<ref group=\"nb\">The [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]], with the reservation that it is \"[[uncodified constitution|uncodified]]\", is taken{{by whom|date=November 2015}} to be based in the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].</ref> On 1 May 1707, under the terms of the [[Acts of Union 1707]], the kingdoms of England and Scotland [[Political union|united]] to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/legislativescrutiny/ Acts of Union 1707] parliament.uk, accessed 27 January 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/visitingHolyrood/union_exhibition.pdf Making the Act of Union 1707] scottish.parliament.uk, accessed 27 January 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511140052/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/visitingHolyrood/union_exhibition.pdf |date=11 May 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Name==\n{{main article|Name of England}}\nThe Anglo-Saxons referred to themselves as the ''Engle''  or the ''Angelcynn'', originally names of the [[Angles]].

Favre, 1883\u20111887, t. 1, col. 251c. http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/ANGLIA\n</ref> By the 14th century, ''England'' was also used in reference to the entire island of Great Britain.\n\nThe standard title for monarchs from [[\u00c6thelstan]] until [[John, King of England|John]] was ''{{lang|la|Rex Anglorum}}'' (\"King of the English\"). [[Canute the Great]], a Dane, was the first to call himself \"King of England\". In the [[Norman England|Norman period]] ''{{lang|la|Rex Anglorum}}'' remained standard, with occasional use of ''{{lang|la|Rex Anglie}}'' (\"King of England\"). From John's reign onwards all other titles were eschewed in favour of ''{{lang|la|Rex}}'' or ''{{lang|la|Regina Anglie}}''. In 1604 [[James VI and I|James I]], who had inherited the English throne the previous year, adopted the title (now usually rendered in English rather than Latin) ''King of Great Britain''. The English and Scottish parliaments, however, did not recognise this title until the Acts of Union of 1707.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2019}}\n===Anglo-Saxon England===\n{{main article|Anglo-Saxon England}}\nThe kingdom of England emerged from the gradual unification of the early medieval [[Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]] known as the [[Heptarchy]]: [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]], [[Mercia]], [[Northumbria]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]], and [[Kingdom of Wessex|Wessex]]. The [[Viking invasions]] of the 9th century upset the balance of power between the English kingdoms, and native Anglo-Saxon life in general. The English lands were unified in the 10th century in a reconquest completed by King \u00c6thelstan in 927 [[Common Era|CE]].\n\nDuring the Heptarchy, the most powerful king among the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms might become acknowledged as [[Bretwalda]], a [[high king]] over the other kings. The decline of Mercia allowed Wessex to become more powerful. It absorbed the kingdoms of Kent and Sussex in 825. The [[List of monarchs of Wessex|kings of Wessex]] became increasingly dominant over the other kingdoms of England during the 9th century. In 827, Northumbria submitted to [[Egbert of Wessex]] at [[Dore]], briefly making Egbert the first king to reign over a united England.\n\nIn 886, [[Alfred the Great]] retook London, which he apparently regarded as a turning point in his reign. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' says that \"all of the English people (''all Angelcyn'') not [[Danelaw|subject to the Danes]] submitted themselves to King Alfred.\"<ref name=aschron>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/657/657.txt The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle] Freely licensed version at Gutenberg Project.

At about this time, [[Lothian]], bordering the northern portion of Northumbria ([[Bernicia]]), was ceded to the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. On 12 July 927 the monarchs of Britain gathered at [[Eamont]] in Cumbria to recognise \u00c6thelstan as king of the English. This can be considered England's 'foundation date', although the process of unification had taken almost 100 years.\n\n[[File:Cnut 1014 1035.jpg|thumb|The dominions of [[Cnut the Great]] (1014\u20131035)]]\n\nEngland has remained in political unity ever since. During the reign of [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]] (978\u20131016), a new wave of Danish invasions was orchestrated by [[Sweyn I of Denmark]], culminating after a quarter-century of warfare in the Danish conquest of England in 1013. But Sweyn died on 2 February 1014, and \u00c6thelred was restored to the throne. In 1015, Sweyn's son [[Cnut the Great]] (commonly known as Canute) launched a new invasion. The ensuing war ended with an agreement in 1016 between Canute and \u00c6thelred's successor, [[Edmund Ironside]], to divide England between them, but Edmund's death on 30 November of that year left England united under Danish rule. This continued for 26 years until the death of [[Harthacnut]] in June 1042. He was the son of Canute and [[Emma of Normandy]] (the widow of \u00c6thelred the Unready) and had no heirs of his own; he was succeeded by his half-brother, \u00c6thelred's son, [[Edward the Confessor]]. The Kingdom of England was once again independent.\n\n===Norman conquest===\n{{main article|Norman conquest of England}}\n\nThe peace lasted until the death of the childless Edward in January 1066. His brother-in-law was crowned [[Harold II of England|King Harold]], but his cousin [[William the Conqueror]], Duke of Normandy, immediately claimed the throne for himself. William launched an invasion of England and landed in [[Sussex]] on 28 September 1066. Harold and his army were in [[York]] following their victory against the Norwegians at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] (25 September 1066) when the news reached him. He decided to set out without delay and confront the Norman army in Sussex so marched southwards at once, despite the army not being properly rested following the battle with the Norwegians. The armies of Harold and William faced each other at the [[Battle of Hastings]] (14 October 1066), in which the English army, or ''[[Fyrd]]'', was defeated, Harold and his two brothers were slain, and William emerged as victor. William was then able to conquer England with little further opposition. He was not, however, planning to absorb the Kingdom into the [[Duchy of Normandy]]. As a mere duke, William owed allegiance to [[Philip I of France]], whereas in the independent Kingdom of England he could rule without interference. He was crowned on 25 December 1066 in [[Westminster Abbey]], London. \n\nThe Norman invasion also marked the fall of \"Orthodox\" England, with William the Conqueror being blessed by Rome to bring England \"into full communion with the 'reformed Papacy'; for since 1052 the English archbishop had been banned and denounced as schismatic by Rome\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Moss|first=Vladimir|title=The Fall of Orthodox England: the Ecclesiastical Roots of the Norman Conquest, 1043-1087|publisher=St. Michael's Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=4-5, 24-31}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Douglas|first=David|title=William the Conqueror|publisher=Eyre & Spottiswoode|year=1964|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The position of England during the [[East\u2013West Schism|Great Schism]] was that of opposition to the papal reforms being done at the time, and thus England was more in line with the East during the Schism.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reid|first=R.

In doing so, he annexed what is now the county of [[Cumbria]] to England. In 1124, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] ceded what is now southeast Scotland (called [[Lothian]]) to the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], in return for the King of Scotland's loyalty. This final cession established what would become the traditional [[England-Scotland border|borders]] of England which have remained largely unchanged since then (except for occasional and temporary changes). This area of land had previously been a part of the Anglian [[Kingdom of Northumbria]]. Lothian contained what later became the Scottish capital, [[Edinburgh]]. This arrangement was later finalized in 1237 by the [[Treaty of York]].\n\n[[File:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|King John signs ''[[Magna Carta]]'' at [[Runnymede]] in 1215, surrounded by his baronage. Illustration from ''Cassell's History of England'', 1902.]]\n\nThe [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] came into [[personal union]] with the Kingdom of England upon the accession of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], who had married [[Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine]]. The Kingdom of England and the Duchy of Normandy remained in personal union until [[John, King of England|John Lackland]], Henry II's son and fifth-generation descendant of William I, lost the continental possessions of the Duchy to [[Philip II of France]] in 1204. A few remnants of [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]], including the [[Channel Islands]], remained in John's possession, together with most of the Duchy of Aquitaine.\n\nUp until the Norman conquest of England, Wales had remained for the most part independent of the [[Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]], although some Welsh kings did sometimes acknowledge the [[Bretwalda]]. Soon after the [[Norman conquest of England]], however, some Norman lords began to attack Wales. They conquered and ruled parts of it, acknowledging the overlordship of the Norman kings of England but with considerable local independence. Over many years these \"[[Marcher Lords]]\" conquered more and more of Wales, against considerable resistance led by various Welsh princes, who also often acknowledged the overlordship of the Norman kings of England.\n\n[[Edward I of England|Edward I]] defeated [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], and so effectively conquered Wales, in 1282. He created the title [[Prince of Wales]] for his heir, the future [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], in 1301. Edward I's conquest was brutal and the subsequent repression considerable, as the magnificent Welsh [[castle]]s such as [[Conwy Castle|Conwy]], [[Harlech Castle|Harlech]], and [[Caernarfon Castle|Caernarfon]] attest; but this event re-united under a single ruler the lands of [[Roman Britain]] for the first time since the establishment of the Kingdom of the [[Jutes]] in [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] in the 5th century, some 700 years before. Accordingly, this was a highly significant moment in the history of medieval England, as it re-established links with the pre-Saxon past. These links were exploited for political purposes to unite the peoples of the kingdom, including the Anglo-Normans, by popularising [[Welsh mythology|Welsh legends]].\n\nThe [[Welsh language]]\u2014derived from the [[British language (Celtic)|British language]], continued to be spoken by the majority of the population of Wales for at least another 500 years, and is still a majority language in parts of the country.\n\n===Late Middle Ages===\n{{Main article|England in the Late Middle Ages}}\n{{further information|Wars of the Roses|Hundred Years' War|Great Slump (15th century)}}\n[[File:Agincour.JPG|thumb|Fifteenth-century miniature depicting the English victory over France at the [[Battle of Agincourt]].]]\n\n[[Edward III of England|Edward III]] was the first English king to have a [[English claims to the French throne|claim to the throne of France]]. His pursuit of the claim resulted in the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337\u20131453), which pitted five kings of England of the [[House of Plantagenet]] against five kings of France of the [[Capetian House of Valois]]. Extensive naval raiding was carried out by all sides during the war, often involving [[privateer]]s such as John Hawley of Dartmouth or the Castilian [[Pero Ni\u00f1o]]. Though the English won numerous victories, they were unable to overcome the numerical superiority of the French and their strategic use of gunpowder weapons. England was defeated at the [[Battle of Formigny]] in 1450 and finally at the [[Battle of Castillon]] in 1453, retaining only a single town in France, [[Calais]].\n\nDuring the Hundred Years' War an [[English identity]] began to develop in place of the previous division between the Norman lords and their [[Anglo-Saxon]] subjects. This was a consequence of sustained hostility to the increasingly nationalist French, whose kings and other leaders (notably the charismatic [[Joan of Arc]]) used a developing sense of French identity to help draw people to their cause. The [[Anglo-Normans]] became separate from their cousins who held lands mainly in France and mocked the former for their archaic and bastardised spoken French. [[Middle English|English]] also became the language of the law courts during this period.\n\nThe kingdom had little time to recover before entering the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455\u20131487), a series of civil wars over possession of the throne between the [[House of Lancaster]] (whose heraldic symbol was the red rose) and the [[House of York]] (whose symbol was the white rose), each led by different branches of the descendants of Edward III. The end of these wars found the throne held by the descendant of an initially illegitimate member of the House of Lancaster, married to the eldest daughter of the House of York: [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and [[Elizabeth of York]]. They were the founders of the [[Tudor dynasty]], which ruled the kingdom from 1485 to 1603.\n\n===Tudor period===\n{{Main article|Tudor period|Elizabethan era|Stuart period|English Renaissance}}\nWales retained a separate legal and administrative system, which had been established by [[Edward I]] in the late 13th century. The country was divided between the [[Marcher Lords]], who gave feudal allegiance to the crown, and the [[Principality of Wales]]. Under the Tudor monarchy, [[Henry VIII]] replaced the laws of Wales with those of England (under the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542]]). Wales was incorporated into the Kingdom of England, and henceforth was represented in the [[Parliament of England]].\n\n[[File:Elizabeth I (Armada Portrait).jpg|thumb|Portrait of Elizabeth I made to commemorate the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] (1588), depicted in the background. Elizabeth's international power is symbolised by the hand resting on the globe.]]\n\nDuring the 1530s, Henry VIII overthrew the power of the Roman Catholic Church within the kingdom, replacing the pope as head of the English Church and seizing the Church's lands, thereby facilitating the creation of a variation of Catholicism that became more Protestant over time. This had the effect of aligning England with Scotland, which also gradually adopted a Protestant religion, whereas the most important continental powers, France and Spain, remained Roman Catholic.\n\nIn 1541, during Henry VIII's reign, the [[Parliament of Ireland]] proclaimed him [[king of Ireland]], thereby bringing the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] into personal union with the Kingdom of England.\n\n[[Calais]], the last remaining continental possession of the Kingdom, was lost in 1558, during the reign of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]] and [[Mary I of England|Mary I]]. Their successor, [[Elizabeth I]], consolidated the new and increasingly Protestant [[Church of England]]. She also began to build up the kingdom's naval strength, on the foundations Henry VIII had laid down. By 1588, her new navy was strong enough to defeat the [[Spanish Armada]], which had sought to invade England to put a Catholic monarch on the throne in her place.\n\n===Early modern history===\n{{main article|Early modern Britain|Stuart period}}\nThe House of Tudor ended with the death of Elizabeth I on 24 March 1603. [[James I of England|James I]] ascended the throne of England and brought it into personal union with the Kingdom of Scotland. Despite the [[Union of the Crowns]], the kingdoms remained separate and independent states: a state of affairs which lasted for more than a century.\n\n====Civil War and Interregnum====\n{{main article|English Civil War|English Interregnum|English Commonwealth|English Protectorate}}\n[[File:Cromwell at Dunbar Andrew Carrick Gow.jpg|thumb|''Cromwell at Dunbar''. [[Oliver Cromwell]] united the whole of the [[British Isles]] by force and created the [[Commonwealth of England]].]]\n\nThe Stuart kings overestimated the power of the English monarchy, and were cast down by Parliament in 1645 and 1688. In the first instance, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s introduction of new forms of taxation in defiance of Parliament led to the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u201345), in which the king was defeated, and to the abolition of the monarchy under [[Oliver Cromwell]] during the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]] of 1649\u20131660. Henceforth, the monarch could reign only at the will of Parliament.\n\nAfter the [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|trial]] and [[execution of Charles I]] in January 1649, the [[Rump Parliament]] passed an [[s:Act declaring England to be a Commonwealth|act declaring England to be a Commonwealth]] on 19 May 1649.  The monarchy and the House of Lords were abolished, and so the House of Commons became a unitary legislative chamber with a new body, the [[Council of State (England)|Council of State]] becoming the executive. However the Army remained the dominant institution in the new republic and the most prominent general was [[Oliver Cromwell]]. The Commonwealth fought [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|wars in Ireland]] and [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Scotland]] which were subdued and placed under Commonwealth military occupation.\n\nIn April 1653 Cromwell and the other ''[[Grandee (New Model Army)|Grandee]]s'' of the [[New Model Army]], frustrated with the members of the [[Rump Parliament]] who would not pass legislation to dissolve the Rump and to allow a new more representative parliament to be elected, stopped the Rump's session by force of arms and declared the Rump dissolved.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAfter an experiment with a Nominated Assembly ([[Barebone's Parliament]]), the Grandees in the Army, through the Council of State imposed a new constitutional arrangement under a written constitution called the [[Instrument of Government]]. Under the Instrument of Government executive power lay with a [[Lord Protector (Protectorate)|Lord Protector]] (an office be held for life of the incumbent) and there were to be triennial Parliaments, with each sitting for at least five months. Article 23 of the Instrument of Government stated that Oliver Cromwell was to be the first Lord Protector. The [[Instrument of Government]] was replaced by a second constitution (the [[Humble Petition and Advice]]) under which the Lord Protector could nominate his successor. Cromwell nominated his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] who became Lord Protector on the death of Oliver on 3 September 1658.\n\n====Restoration and Glorious Revolution====\n{{main article|Restoration (England)|Glorious Revolution}}\nRichard proved to be ineffectual and was unable to maintain his rule. He resigned his title and retired into obscurity. The Rump Parliament was recalled and there was a second period where the executive power lay with the Council of state. But this restoration of Commonwealth rule similar to that before the Protectorate, proved to be unstable, and the exiled claimant, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was [[Restoration (England)|restored]] to the throne in 1660.\n\nFollowing the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, an attempt by [[James II of England|James II]] to reintroduce Roman Catholicism\u2014a century after its suppression by the Tudors\u2014led to the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, in which he was deposed by Parliament. The Crown was then offered by Parliament to James II's Protestant daughter and son-in-law/nephew, [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]].\n\n====Union with Scotland====\nIn the Scottish case, the attractions were partly financial and partly to do with removing English trade sanctions put in place through the [[Alien Act 1705]]. The English were more anxious about the royal succession. The death of [[William III of England|William III]] in 1702 had led to the accession of his sister-in-law [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] to the thrones of England and Scotland, but her only surviving child had died in 1700, and the English [[Act of Settlement 1701]] had given the succession to the English crown to the Protestant [[House of Hanover]]. Securing the same succession in Scotland became the primary object of English strategic thinking towards Scotland. By 1704, the [[Union of the Crowns]] was in crisis, with the Scottish [[Act of Security 1704|Act of Security]] allowing for the Scottish Parliament to choose a different monarch, which could in turn lead to an independent foreign policy during a major European war. The English establishment did not wish to risk a [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] on the Scottish throne, nor the possibility of a Scottish military alliance with another power.\n\nA [[Treaty of Union]] was agreed on 22 July 1706, and following the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] of 1707, which created the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], the independence of the kingdoms of England and Scotland came to an end on 1 May 1707. The Acts of Union created a [[customs union]] and [[monetary union]] and provided that any \"laws and statutes\" that were \"contrary to or inconsistent with the terms\" of the Acts would \"cease and become void\".\n\nThe English and Scottish Parliaments were merged into the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], located in [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]], London. At this point England ceased to exist as a separate political entity, and since then has had no national [[Government of England|government]]. The laws of England were unaffected, with the legal jurisdiction continuing to be that of [[England and Wales]], while [[Scotland]] continued to have its own laws and law courts. This continued after the [[Acts of Union 1800|1801 union]] between the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland, forming the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. In 1922 the [[Irish Free State]] seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927|renamed]] the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\n==Territorial divisions==\n{{further information|Historic counties of England|List of earldoms|Domesday Book|County palatine|English county histories|English feudal barony}}\n\nThe [[historic counties of England|counties of England]] were established for administration by the [[Normans]], in most cases based on earlier [[shire]]s established by the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. They ceased to be used for administration only with the creation of the [[administrative counties of England|administrative counties]] in 1889.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/types/type_page.jsp?unit_type=ANC_CNTY Vision of Britain] \u2013 Type details for ancient county.

Feudal baronies became perhaps obsolete (but not extinct) on the abolition of feudal tenure during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], as confirmed by the [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660]] passed under the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] which took away knight-service and other legal rights.\nTenure by [[knight-service]] was abolished and discharged and the lands covered by such tenures, including once-feudal baronies, were henceforth held by [[socage]] (i.e. in exchange for monetary rents).\nThe English ''Fitzwalter Case'' in 1670 ruled that barony by tenure had been discontinued for many years and any claims to a [[peerage]] on such basis, meaning a right to sit in the [[House of Lords]], were not to be revived, nor any right of succession based on them.\n\nThe [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in 1284 followed the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|conquest of Wales]] by [[Edward I of England]].  It assumed the lands held by the Princes of Gwynedd under the title \"[[Prince of Wales]]\" as legally part of the lands of England, and established shire counties on the English model over those areas. The [[Welsh Marches|Marcher Lords]] were progressively tied to the English kings by the grants of lands and lordships in England. The [[Council of Wales and the Marches]], administered from [[Ludlow Castle]], was initially established in 1472 by [[Edward IV of England]] to govern the lands held under the Principality of Wales.<ref name=EnglishLaw>William Searle Holdsworth, \"A History of English Law,\" Little, Brown, and Company, 1912, p. 502</ref> and the bordering English counties.  It was abolished in 1689.  Under the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542]] introduced under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], the jurisdiction of the marcher lords was abolished in 1536.  The Acts had the effect of annexing Wales to England and creating a single state and legal jurisdiction, commonly referred to as [[England and Wales]].  \n\nAt the same time the Council of Wales was created in 1472, a [[Council of the North]] was set up for the [[North of England|northern counties]] of England.  After falling into disuse, it was re-established in 1537 and abolished in 1641.

In 1016, the kingdom became part of the [[North Sea Empire]] of [[Cnut the Great]], a personal union between [[England]], [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]].  The [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at [[Winchester]] to [[Westminster]], and the [[City of London]] quickly established itself as England's largest and principal commercial centre.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bkGpFhiPtIEC&lpg=PA430&dq=History%20of%20London&pg=PA363#v=onepage&q&f=false ''London, 800\u20131216: The Shaping of a City''], \"''...rivalry between City and government, between a commercial capital in the City and the political capital of quite a different empire in Westminster.''\", accessed November 2013.</ref>\n\nHistories of the kingdom of England from the [[Norman conquest]] of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties: [[Norman England|Norman]] 1066\u20131154, [[Plantagenet era|Plantagenet]] 1154\u20131485, [[Tudor period|Tudor]] 1485\u20131603 and [[Stuart period|Stuart]] 1603\u20131707 (interrupted by the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] of 1649\u20131660).\nDynastically, all [[kings of England|English monarchs]] after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans; the distinction of the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenets]] is merely conventional, beginning with [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (reigned 1154\u20131189) as from that time, the [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin kings]] became \"more English in nature\"; the houses of [[House of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[House of York|York]] are both Plantagenet cadet branches, the [[Tudor dynasty]] claimed descent from [[Edward III]] via [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset|John Beaufort]] and [[James VI and I]] of the [[House of Stuart]] claimed descent from [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] via [[Margaret Tudor]].\n\nThe completion of the [[conquest of Wales by Edward I]] in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown. Edward III (reigned 1327\u20131377) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government\u2014in particular the evolution of the [[English parliament]].  From the 1340s the kings of England also [[English claims to the French throne|laid claim]] to the crown of [[kingdom of France|France]], but after the [[Hundred Years' War]] and the outbreak of the [[Wars of the Roses]] in 1455, the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent, except for [[Pale of Calais|Calais]]. After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses, the [[Tudor dynasty]] ruled during the [[English Renaissance]] and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper, achieving the full union of England and the [[Principality of Wales]] [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542|in 1542]]. [[Henry VIII]] oversaw the [[English Reformation]], and his daughter [[Elizabeth I]] (reigned 1558\u20131603) the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]], meanwhile establishing England as a [[great power]] and laying the foundations of the [[British Empire]] by claiming possessions in the [[English overseas possessions|New World]].\n\nFrom the accession of [[James VI and I]] in 1603, the [[Stuart dynasty]] ruled England in [[Union of the Crowns|personal union]] with [[kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]. Under the Stuarts, the kingdom plunged into [[English Civil War|civil war]], which culminated in the [[execution of Charles I]] in 1649. The monarchy returned in 1660, but the Civil War had established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without the consent of Parliament. This concept became legally established as part of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.\nFrom this time the kingdom of England, as well as its successor state the United Kingdom, functioned in effect as a [[constitutional monarchy]].<ref group=\"nb\">The [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]], with the reservation that it is \"[[uncodified constitution|uncodified]]\", is taken{{by whom|date=November 2015}} to be based in the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].</ref> On 1 May 1707, under the terms of the [[Acts of Union 1707]], the kingdoms of England and Scotland [[Political union|united]] to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/legislativescrutiny/ Acts of Union 1707] parliament.uk, accessed 27 January 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/visitingHolyrood/union_exhibition.pdf Making the Act of Union 1707] scottish.parliament.uk, accessed 27 January 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511140052/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/visitingHolyrood/union_exhibition.pdf |date=11 May 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Name==\n{{main article|Name of England}}\nThe Anglo-Saxons referred to themselves as the ''Engle''  or the ''Angelcynn'', originally names of the [[Angles]].

Favre, 1883\u20111887, t. 1, col. 251c. http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/ANGLIA\n</ref> By the 14th century, ''England'' was also used in reference to the entire island of Great Britain.\n\nThe standard title for monarchs from [[\u00c6thelstan]] until [[John, King of England|John]] was ''{{lang|la|Rex Anglorum}}'' (\"King of the English\"). [[Canute the Great]], a Dane, was the first to call himself \"King of England\". In the [[Norman England|Norman period]] ''{{lang|la|Rex Anglorum}}'' remained standard, with occasional use of ''{{lang|la|Rex Anglie}}'' (\"King of England\"). From John's reign onwards all other titles were eschewed in favour of ''{{lang|la|Rex}}'' or ''{{lang|la|Regina Anglie}}''. In 1604 [[James VI and I|James I]], who had inherited the English throne the previous year, adopted the title (now usually rendered in English rather than Latin) ''King of Great Britain''. The English and Scottish parliaments, however, did not recognise this title until the Acts of Union of 1707.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2019}}\n===Anglo-Saxon England===\n{{main article|Anglo-Saxon England}}\nThe kingdom of England emerged from the gradual unification of the early medieval [[Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]] known as the [[Heptarchy]]: [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]], [[Mercia]], [[Northumbria]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]], and [[Kingdom of Wessex|Wessex]]. The [[Viking invasions]] of the 9th century upset the balance of power between the English kingdoms, and native Anglo-Saxon life in general. The English lands were unified in the 10th century in a reconquest completed by King \u00c6thelstan in 927 [[Common Era|CE]].\n\nDuring the Heptarchy, the most powerful king among the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms might become acknowledged as [[Bretwalda]], a [[high king]] over the other kings. The decline of Mercia allowed Wessex to become more powerful. It absorbed the kingdoms of Kent and Sussex in 825. The [[List of monarchs of Wessex|kings of Wessex]] became increasingly dominant over the other kingdoms of England during the 9th century. In 827, Northumbria submitted to [[Egbert of Wessex]] at [[Dore]], briefly making Egbert the first king to reign over a united England.\n\nIn 886, [[Alfred the Great]] retook London, which he apparently regarded as a turning point in his reign. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' says that \"all of the English people (''all Angelcyn'') not [[Danelaw|subject to the Danes]] submitted themselves to King Alfred.\"<ref name=aschron>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/657/657.txt The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle] Freely licensed version at Gutenberg Project. Note: This electronic edition is a collation of material from nine diverse extant versions of the Chronicle. It contains primarily the translation of Rev. James Ingram, as published in the Everyman edition.</ref> Asser added that \"Alfred, king of the Anglo-Saxons, restored the [[city of London]] splendidly ... and made it habitable once more.\"<ref>Asser's ''Life of King Alfred'', ch. 83, trans. Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred & Other Contemporary Sources'' (Penguin Classics) (1984), pp. 97\u201398.</ref> Alfred's \"restoration\" entailed reoccupying and refurbishing the nearly deserted Roman walled city, building [[Wharf|quays]] along the [[Thames]], and laying a new city street plan.<ref>[[Alan Vince|Vince, Alan]], ''Saxon London: An Archaeological Investigation'', The Archaeology of London series (1990).</ref> It is probably at this point that Alfred assumed the new royal style 'King of the Anglo-Saxons.'\n\nDuring the following years Northumbria repeatedly changed hands between the English kings and the Norwegian invaders, but was definitively brought under English control by [[Eadred]] in 954, completing the unification of England. At about this time, [[Lothian]], bordering the northern portion of Northumbria ([[Bernicia]]), was ceded to the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. On 12 July 927 the monarchs of Britain gathered at [[Eamont]] in Cumbria to recognise \u00c6thelstan as king of the English. This can be considered England's 'foundation date', although the process of unification had taken almost 100 years.\n\n[[File:Cnut 1014 1035.jpg|thumb|The dominions of [[Cnut the Great]] (1014\u20131035)]]\n\nEngland has remained in political unity ever since. During the reign of [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]] (978\u20131016), a new wave of Danish invasions was orchestrated by [[Sweyn I of Denmark]], culminating after a quarter-century of warfare in the Danish conquest of England in 1013. But Sweyn died on 2 February 1014, and \u00c6thelred was restored to the throne. In 1015, Sweyn's son [[Cnut the Great]] (commonly known as Canute) launched a new invasion. The ensuing war ended with an agreement in 1016 between Canute and \u00c6thelred's successor, [[Edmund Ironside]], to divide England between them, but Edmund's death on 30 November of that year left England united under Danish rule. This continued for 26 years until the death of [[Harthacnut]] in June 1042. He was the son of Canute and [[Emma of Normandy]] (the widow of \u00c6thelred the Unready) and had no heirs of his own; he was succeeded by his half-brother, \u00c6thelred's son, [[Edward the Confessor]]. The Kingdom of England was once again independent.\n\n===Norman conquest===\n{{main article|Norman conquest of England}}\n\nThe peace lasted until the death of the childless Edward in January 1066. His brother-in-law was crowned [[Harold II of England|King Harold]], but his cousin [[William the Conqueror]], Duke of Normandy, immediately claimed the throne for himself. William launched an invasion of England and landed in [[Sussex]] on 28 September 1066. Harold and his army were in [[York]] following their victory against the Norwegians at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] (25 September 1066) when the news reached him. He decided to set out without delay and confront the Norman army in Sussex so marched southwards at once, despite the army not being properly rested following the battle with the Norwegians. The armies of Harold and William faced each other at the [[Battle of Hastings]] (14 October 1066), in which the English army, or ''[[Fyrd]]'', was defeated, Harold and his two brothers were slain, and William emerged as victor. William was then able to conquer England with little further opposition. He was not, however, planning to absorb the Kingdom into the [[Duchy of Normandy]]. As a mere duke, William owed allegiance to [[Philip I of France]], whereas in the independent Kingdom of England he could rule without interference. He was crowned on 25 December 1066 in [[Westminster Abbey]], London. \n\nThe Norman invasion also marked the fall of \"Orthodox\" England, with William the Conqueror being blessed by Rome to bring England \"into full communion with the 'reformed Papacy'; for since 1052 the English archbishop had been banned and denounced as schismatic by Rome\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Moss|first=Vladimir|title=The Fall of Orthodox England: the Ecclesiastical Roots of the Norman Conquest, 1043-1087|publisher=St. Michael's Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=4-5, 24-31}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Douglas|first=David|title=William the Conqueror|publisher=Eyre & Spottiswoode|year=1964|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The position of England during the [[East\u2013West Schism|Great Schism]] was that of opposition to the papal reforms being done at the time, and thus England was more in line with the East during the Schism.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reid|first=R.

In doing so, he annexed what is now the county of [[Cumbria]] to England. In 1124, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] ceded what is now southeast Scotland (called [[Lothian]]) to the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], in return for the King of Scotland's loyalty. This final cession established what would become the traditional [[England-Scotland border|borders]] of England which have remained largely unchanged since then (except for occasional and temporary changes). This area of land had previously been a part of the Anglian [[Kingdom of Northumbria]]. Lothian contained what later became the Scottish capital, [[Edinburgh]]. This arrangement was later finalized in 1237 by the [[Treaty of York]].\n\n[[File:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|King John signs ''[[Magna Carta]]'' at [[Runnymede]] in 1215, surrounded by his baronage. Illustration from ''Cassell's History of England'', 1902.]]\n\nThe [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] came into [[personal union]] with the Kingdom of England upon the accession of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], who had married [[Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine]]. The Kingdom of England and the Duchy of Normandy remained in personal union until [[John, King of England|John Lackland]], Henry II's son and fifth-generation descendant of William I, lost the continental possessions of the Duchy to [[Philip II of France]] in 1204. A few remnants of [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]], including the [[Channel Islands]], remained in John's possession, together with most of the Duchy of Aquitaine.\n\nUp until the Norman conquest of England, Wales had remained for the most part independent of the [[Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]], although some Welsh kings did sometimes acknowledge the [[Bretwalda]]. Soon after the [[Norman conquest of England]], however, some Norman lords began to attack Wales. They conquered and ruled parts of it, acknowledging the overlordship of the Norman kings of England but with considerable local independence. Over many years these \"[[Marcher Lords]]\" conquered more and more of Wales, against considerable resistance led by various Welsh princes, who also often acknowledged the overlordship of the Norman kings of England.\n\n[[Edward I of England|Edward I]] defeated [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], and so effectively conquered Wales, in 1282. He created the title [[Prince of Wales]] for his heir, the future [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], in 1301. Edward I's conquest was brutal and the subsequent repression considerable, as the magnificent Welsh [[castle]]s such as [[Conwy Castle|Conwy]], [[Harlech Castle|Harlech]], and [[Caernarfon Castle|Caernarfon]] attest; but this event re-united under a single ruler the lands of [[Roman Britain]] for the first time since the establishment of the Kingdom of the [[Jutes]] in [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] in the 5th century, some 700 years before. Accordingly, this was a highly significant moment in the history of medieval England, as it re-established links with the pre-Saxon past. These links were exploited for political purposes to unite the peoples of the kingdom, including the Anglo-Normans, by popularising [[Welsh mythology|Welsh legends]].\n\nThe [[Welsh language]]\u2014derived from the [[British language (Celtic)|British language]], continued to be spoken by the majority of the population of Wales for at least another 500 years, and is still a majority language in parts of the country.\n\n===Late Middle Ages===\n{{Main article|England in the Late Middle Ages}}\n{{further information|Wars of the Roses|Hundred Years' War|Great Slump (15th century)}}\n[[File:Agincour.JPG|thumb|Fifteenth-century miniature depicting the English victory over France at the [[Battle of Agincourt]].]]\n\n[[Edward III of England|Edward III]] was the first English king to have a [[English claims to the French throne|claim to the throne of France]]. His pursuit of the claim resulted in the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337\u20131453), which pitted five kings of England of the [[House of Plantagenet]] against five kings of France of the [[Capetian House of Valois]]. Extensive naval raiding was carried out by all sides during the war, often involving [[privateer]]s such as John Hawley of Dartmouth or the Castilian [[Pero Ni\u00f1o]]. Though the English won numerous victories, they were unable to overcome the numerical superiority of the French and their strategic use of gunpowder weapons. England was defeated at the [[Battle of Formigny]] in 1450 and finally at the [[Battle of Castillon]] in 1453, retaining only a single town in France, [[Calais]].\n\nDuring the Hundred Years' War an [[English identity]] began to develop in place of the previous division between the Norman lords and their [[Anglo-Saxon]] subjects. This was a consequence of sustained hostility to the increasingly nationalist French, whose kings and other leaders (notably the charismatic [[Joan of Arc]]) used a developing sense of French identity to help draw people to their cause. The [[Anglo-Normans]] became separate from their cousins who held lands mainly in France and mocked the former for their archaic and bastardised spoken French. [[Middle English|English]] also became the language of the law courts during this period.\n\nThe kingdom had little time to recover before entering the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455\u20131487), a series of civil wars over possession of the throne between the [[House of Lancaster]] (whose heraldic symbol was the red rose) and the [[House of York]] (whose symbol was the white rose), each led by different branches of the descendants of Edward III. The end of these wars found the throne held by the descendant of an initially illegitimate member of the House of Lancaster, married to the eldest daughter of the House of York: [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and [[Elizabeth of York]]. They were the founders of the [[Tudor dynasty]], which ruled the kingdom from 1485 to 1603.\n\n===Tudor period===\n{{Main article|Tudor period|Elizabethan era|Stuart period|English Renaissance}}\nWales retained a separate legal and administrative system, which had been established by [[Edward I]] in the late 13th century. The country was divided between the [[Marcher Lords]], who gave feudal allegiance to the crown, and the [[Principality of Wales]]. Under the Tudor monarchy, [[Henry VIII]] replaced the laws of Wales with those of England (under the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542]]). Wales was incorporated into the Kingdom of England, and henceforth was represented in the [[Parliament of England]].\n\n[[File:Elizabeth I (Armada Portrait).jpg|thumb|Portrait of Elizabeth I made to commemorate the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] (1588), depicted in the background. Elizabeth's international power is symbolised by the hand resting on the globe.]]\n\nDuring the 1530s, Henry VIII overthrew the power of the Roman Catholic Church within the kingdom, replacing the pope as head of the English Church and seizing the Church's lands, thereby facilitating the creation of a variation of Catholicism that became more Protestant over time. This had the effect of aligning England with Scotland, which also gradually adopted a Protestant religion, whereas the most important continental powers, France and Spain, remained Roman Catholic.\n\nIn 1541, during Henry VIII's reign, the [[Parliament of Ireland]] proclaimed him [[king of Ireland]], thereby bringing the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] into personal union with the Kingdom of England.\n\n[[Calais]], the last remaining continental possession of the Kingdom, was lost in 1558, during the reign of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]] and [[Mary I of England|Mary I]]. Their successor, [[Elizabeth I]], consolidated the new and increasingly Protestant [[Church of England]]. She also began to build up the kingdom's naval strength, on the foundations Henry VIII had laid down. By 1588, her new navy was strong enough to defeat the [[Spanish Armada]], which had sought to invade England to put a Catholic monarch on the throne in her place.\n\n===Early modern history===\n{{main article|Early modern Britain|Stuart period}}\nThe House of Tudor ended with the death of Elizabeth I on 24 March 1603. [[James I of England|James I]] ascended the throne of England and brought it into personal union with the Kingdom of Scotland. Despite the [[Union of the Crowns]], the kingdoms remained separate and independent states: a state of affairs which lasted for more than a century.\n\n====Civil War and Interregnum====\n{{main article|English Civil War|English Interregnum|English Commonwealth|English Protectorate}}\n[[File:Cromwell at Dunbar Andrew Carrick Gow.jpg|thumb|''Cromwell at Dunbar''. [[Oliver Cromwell]] united the whole of the [[British Isles]] by force and created the [[Commonwealth of England]].]]\n\nThe Stuart kings overestimated the power of the English monarchy, and were cast down by Parliament in 1645 and 1688. In the first instance, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s introduction of new forms of taxation in defiance of Parliament led to the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u201345), in which the king was defeated, and to the abolition of the monarchy under [[Oliver Cromwell]] during the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]] of 1649\u20131660. Henceforth, the monarch could reign only at the will of Parliament.\n\nAfter the [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|trial]] and [[execution of Charles I]] in January 1649, the [[Rump Parliament]] passed an [[s:Act declaring England to be a Commonwealth|act declaring England to be a Commonwealth]] on 19 May 1649.  The monarchy and the House of Lords were abolished, and so the House of Commons became a unitary legislative chamber with a new body, the [[Council of State (England)|Council of State]] becoming the executive. However the Army remained the dominant institution in the new republic and the most prominent general was [[Oliver Cromwell]]. The Commonwealth fought [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|wars in Ireland]] and [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Scotland]] which were subdued and placed under Commonwealth military occupation.\n\nIn April 1653 Cromwell and the other ''[[Grandee (New Model Army)|Grandee]]s'' of the [[New Model Army]], frustrated with the members of the [[Rump Parliament]] who would not pass legislation to dissolve the Rump and to allow a new more representative parliament to be elected, stopped the Rump's session by force of arms and declared the Rump dissolved.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAfter an experiment with a Nominated Assembly ([[Barebone's Parliament]]), the Grandees in the Army, through the Council of State imposed a new constitutional arrangement under a written constitution called the [[Instrument of Government]]. Under the Instrument of Government executive power lay with a [[Lord Protector (Protectorate)|Lord Protector]] (an office be held for life of the incumbent) and there were to be triennial Parliaments, with each sitting for at least five months. Article 23 of the Instrument of Government stated that Oliver Cromwell was to be the first Lord Protector. The [[Instrument of Government]] was replaced by a second constitution (the [[Humble Petition and Advice]]) under which the Lord Protector could nominate his successor. Cromwell nominated his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] who became Lord Protector on the death of Oliver on 3 September 1658.\n\n====Restoration and Glorious Revolution====\n{{main article|Restoration (England)|Glorious Revolution}}\nRichard proved to be ineffectual and was unable to maintain his rule. He resigned his title and retired into obscurity. The Rump Parliament was recalled and there was a second period where the executive power lay with the Council of state. But this restoration of Commonwealth rule similar to that before the Protectorate, proved to be unstable, and the exiled claimant, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was [[Restoration (England)|restored]] to the throne in 1660.\n\nFollowing the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, an attempt by [[James II of England|James II]] to reintroduce Roman Catholicism\u2014a century after its suppression by the Tudors\u2014led to the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, in which he was deposed by Parliament. The Crown was then offered by Parliament to James II's Protestant daughter and son-in-law/nephew, [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]].\n\n====Union with Scotland====\nIn the Scottish case, the attractions were partly financial and partly to do with removing English trade sanctions put in place through the [[Alien Act 1705]]. The English were more anxious about the royal succession. The death of [[William III of England|William III]] in 1702 had led to the accession of his sister-in-law [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] to the thrones of England and Scotland, but her only surviving child had died in 1700, and the English [[Act of Settlement 1701]] had given the succession to the English crown to the Protestant [[House of Hanover]]. Securing the same succession in Scotland became the primary object of English strategic thinking towards Scotland. By 1704, the [[Union of the Crowns]] was in crisis, with the Scottish [[Act of Security 1704|Act of Security]] allowing for the Scottish Parliament to choose a different monarch, which could in turn lead to an independent foreign policy during a major European war. The English establishment did not wish to risk a [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] on the Scottish throne, nor the possibility of a Scottish military alliance with another power.\n\nA [[Treaty of Union]] was agreed on 22 July 1706, and following the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] of 1707, which created the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], the independence of the kingdoms of England and Scotland came to an end on 1 May 1707. The Acts of Union created a [[customs union]] and [[monetary union]] and provided that any \"laws and statutes\" that were \"contrary to or inconsistent with the terms\" of the Acts would \"cease and become void\".\n\nThe English and Scottish Parliaments were merged into the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], located in [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]], London. At this point England ceased to exist as a separate political entity, and since then has had no national [[Government of England|government]]. The laws of England were unaffected, with the legal jurisdiction continuing to be that of [[England and Wales]], while [[Scotland]] continued to have its own laws and law courts. This continued after the [[Acts of Union 1800|1801 union]] between the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland, forming the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. In 1922 the [[Irish Free State]] seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927|renamed]] the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\n==Territorial divisions==\n{{further information|Historic counties of England|List of earldoms|Domesday Book|County palatine|English county histories|English feudal barony}}\n\nThe [[historic counties of England|counties of England]] were established for administration by the [[Normans]], in most cases based on earlier [[shire]]s established by the [[Anglo-Saxons]].

Feudal baronies became perhaps obsolete (but not extinct) on the abolition of feudal tenure during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], as confirmed by the [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660]] passed under the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] which took away knight-service and other legal rights.\nTenure by [[knight-service]] was abolished and discharged and the lands covered by such tenures, including once-feudal baronies, were henceforth held by [[socage]] (i.e. in exchange for monetary rents).\nThe English ''Fitzwalter Case'' in 1670 ruled that barony by tenure had been discontinued for many years and any claims to a [[peerage]] on such basis, meaning a right to sit in the [[House of Lords]], were not to be revived, nor any right of succession based on them.\n\nThe [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in 1284 followed the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|conquest of Wales]] by [[Edward I of England]].  It assumed the lands held by the Princes of Gwynedd under the title \"[[Prince of Wales]]\" as legally part of the lands of England, and established shire counties on the English model over those areas. The [[Welsh Marches|Marcher Lords]] were progressively tied to the English kings by the grants of lands and lordships in England. The [[Council of Wales and the Marches]], administered from [[Ludlow Castle]], was initially established in 1472 by [[Edward IV of England]] to govern the lands held under the Principality of Wales.<ref name=EnglishLaw>William Searle Holdsworth, \"A History of English Law,\" Little, Brown, and Company, 1912, p. 502</ref> and the bordering English counties.  It was abolished in 1689.  Under the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542]] introduced under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], the jurisdiction of the marcher lords was abolished in 1536.  The Acts had the effect of annexing Wales to England and creating a single state and legal jurisdiction, commonly referred to as [[England and Wales]].  \n\nAt the same time the Council of Wales was created in 1472, a [[Council of the North]] was set up for the [[North of England|northern counties]] of England.  After falling into disuse, it was re-established in 1537 and abolished in 1641.  A very short-lived [[Council of the West]] also existed for the [[West Country]] between 1537 and 1540.\n\n==See also==\n<!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order & add a short description [[WP:SEEALSO]] -->\n{{div col |colwidth=20em |small=yes}}\n*{{annotated link |Anglo-Norman language}}\n*{{annotated link |Crown Jewels of England}}\n*{{annotated link |England and Wales}}\n*{{annotated link |English colonial empire}}\n*{{annotated link |English Army}}\n*[[List of English monarchs]]\n*{{annotated link |Middle English language}}\n*{{annotated link |Privy Council of England}}\n*{{annotated link |Royal Navy}}\n*{{annotated link |United Kingdom}}\n{{div col end}}\n<!-- please keep entries in alphabetical order -->\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* Bartlett, Robert.
