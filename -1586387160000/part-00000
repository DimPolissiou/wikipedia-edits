Arguing that these tales of heroism are common in Europe, he wrote that Grabowski's book is part of a \"growing body of corrective scholarship\" that discusses the indifference or complicity of European populations; but he also warned readers and reviewers not to \"reinforce orientalist narratives about 'Eastern' Europe\" or the idea that only populations close to the genocide could stop it, which he calls \"fetishiz[ing] spatial proximity\".<ref name=Fleming2016/>\n\n====Controversy====\nSince the publication of the Polish- and English-language editions of ''[[Hunt for the Jews]]'', Grabowski has been boycotted by the Polish-Canadian community, and Polish groups have attempted to have him fired from his academic position. According to media reports, Grabowski has faced harassment and death threats, leading to increased security patrols in his department at the [[University of Ottawa]].<ref name=\"legion2018\">[https://legionmagazine.com/en/2018/02/the-truth-about-poland/ The truth about Poland], ''Legion Magazine'', Stephen J.
