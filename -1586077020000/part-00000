The French attacked the English while they were [[Cr\u00e9cy campaign|traversing northern France]] during the [[Hundred Years' War]] resulting in an English victory and heavy loss of life among the French.\n\nThe English army had landed in the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] on 12&nbsp;July. It had burnt a path of destruction through some of the richest lands in France to within {{convert|2|mi|km|sigfig=1}} of Paris, [[looting|sacking]] many towns on the way. The English then marched north, hoping to link up with an allied Flemish army which had invaded from [[County of Flanders|Flanders]]. Hearing that the Flemish had turned back, and having [[Battle of Blanchetaque|temporarily outdistanced]] the pursuing French, Edward had his army prepare a defensive position on a hillside near [[Cr\u00e9cy-en-Ponthieu]]. Late on 26 August the French army, which greatly outnumbered the English, attacked.\n\nDuring a brief archery duel a large force of French mercenary [[crossbowmen]] was routed by Welsh and  [[English longbowmen]]. The French then launched a series of cavalry charges by their mounted [[knights]]. These were disordered by their impromptu nature, by having to force their way through the fleeing crossbowmen, by the muddy ground, by having to charge uphill, and by the pits dug by the English. The attacks were further broken up by the effective fire from the English [[Archery|archers]], which caused heavy casualties. By the time the French charges reached the English [[men-at-arms]], who had dismounted for the battle, they had lost much of their impetus. The ensuing [[hand-to-hand combat]] was described as \"murderous, without pity, cruel, and very horrible\". The French charges continued late into the night, all with the same result: fierce fighting followed by a French repulse.\n\nThe English then [[Siege of Calais (1346\u201347)|laid siege to the port of Calais]]. The battle crippled the French army's ability to relieve the siege; the town fell to the English the following year and remained under English rule for more than two centuries, [[Siege of Calais (1558)|until 1558]]. Cr\u00e9cy established the effectiveness of the [[longbow]] as a dominant weapon on the Western European battlefield.\n\n==Background==\n\nSince the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, English monarchs had held titles and lands within France, the possession of which made them [[vassal]]s of the kings of France.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=394}} Following a series of disagreements between [[Philip VI of France]] ({{reign|1328|1350}}) and [[Edward III of England]] ({{reign|1327|1377}}), on 24 May 1337 Philip's [[Conseil du Roi|Great Council]] in Paris agreed that the lands held by Edward in France should be taken back into Philip's hands on the grounds that Edward was in breach of his obligations as a vassal. This marked the start of the [[Hundred Years' War]], which was to last 116 years.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=184}}\n\n[[File:Edward III (18th century).jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=a head and shoulders drawing of Edward III, in armour and bearing a sword|{{center|[[Edward III of England]]}}]]\nIn 1345 Edward's main army sailed on 29 June and anchored off [[Sluys]] in Flanders until 22 July, while Edward attended to diplomatic affairs.{{sfn|Lucas|1929|pp=519\u2013524}} When it sailed, probably intending to land in [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]], it was scattered by a storm. There were further delays and it proved impossible to take any action with this force before winter.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=315}} Meanwhile, [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Henry, Earl of Derby]], led a whirlwind [[Gascon campaign of 1345|campaign through Gascony]] at the head of an Anglo-Gascon army.{{sfn|Gribit|2016|p=1}} He heavily defeated two large French armies at the battles of [[Battle of Bergerac|Bergerac]] and [[Battle of Auberoche|Auberoche]], captured more than 100 French towns and fortifications in [[P\u00e9rigord]] and [[Agenais]] and gave the English possessions in Gascony [[strategic depth]].{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=476\u2013478}}\n\nIn March 1346 a French army numbering between 15,000 and 20,000,{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=3}} \"enormously superior\" to any force the Anglo-Gascons could field, including all the military officers of the royal household,{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=485\u2013486}} and commanded by [[John II of France|John, Duke of Normandy]], the son and heir of Philip VI, marched on Gascony. They besieged the strategically and logistically important town of [[Aiguillon, Lot-et-Garonne|Aiguillon]].{{sfn|Fowler|1961|p=215}} On 2&nbsp;April the ''[[arri\u00e8re-ban]]'', the formal call to arms for all able-bodied males, was announced for the south of France.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=485}} French financial, logistical and manpower efforts were focused on this offensive.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=484}} Derby, now Lancaster,<ref group=note>During the 1345 campaign he was known as the Earl of Derby, but his father died in September 1345 and he became the Earl of Lancaster. {{harvnb|Sumption|1990|p=476}}</ref> sent an urgent appeal for help to Edward.{{sfn|Harari|1999|p=384}} Edward was not only morally obliged to succour his vassal, but contractually required to; his [[indenture]] with Lancaster stated that if Lancaster were attacked by overwhelming numbers, then Edward \"shall rescue him in one way or another\".{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=493}}\n\nMeanwhile, Edward was raising a fresh army, and assembled more than 700 vessels to transport it \u2013 the largest English fleet ever to that date.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=102}}{{sfn|Burne|1999|p=138}} The French were aware of Edward's efforts, and to guard against the possibility of an English landing in northern France, relied on their powerful navy.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=494}} This reliance was misplaced, and the French were unable to prevent Edward successfully crossing the [[English Channel|Channel]].{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=494}}\n\n==Prelude==\n{{further|Cr\u00e9cy campaign}}\n[[File:Map of the route of Edward III's chevauch\u00e9e of 1346.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|alt=A map of south east England and north east France showing the route of the English army|{{center|Map of the route of Edward III's chevauch\u00e9e of 1346}}]]\nThe English landed at [[Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue]], [[Normandy]], on 12 July 1346. They achieved complete strategic surprise and marched south.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=103}} Edward's soldiers razed every town in their path and looted whatever they could from the populace. [[Caen]], the cultural, political, religious and financial centre of north west Normandy, was [[battle of Caen (1346)|stormed on 26 July]] and subsequently looted for five days. More than 5,000 French soldiers and civilians were killed; among the few prisoners was [[Raoul II of Brienne, Count of Eu|Raoul, Count of Eu]], the [[Constable of France]]. On 29 July Edward sent his fleet back to England, laden with loot, with a letter ordering that reinforcements, supplies and money be collected, embarked and loaded respectively, and sent to rendezvous with his army at [[Le Crotoy|Crotoy]], on the north bank of the mouth of the [[River Somme]].{{sfn|Harari|1999|p=387}}{{sfn|Ayton|2007b|p=75}} The English marched out towards the [[Seine River|River Seine]] on 1&nbsp;August.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=507\u2013510}}\n\nThe French military position was difficult. Their main army, commanded by John, Duke of Normandy, the son and heir of Philip VI, was committed to the intractable [[siege of Aiguillon]] in the south west. After his surprise landing in Normandy Edward was devastating some of the richest land in France and flaunting his ability to march at will through France. On 2&nbsp;August, a small English force supported by many [[Flanders|Flemings]] invaded France from Flanders; French defences there were completely inadequate. The treasury was all but empty. On 29 July, Philip proclaimed the ''arri\u00e8re-ban'' for northern France, ordering every able-bodied male to assemble at [[Rouen]], where Philip himself arrived on the 31st.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=512\u2013513}}{{sfn|Livingstone|Witzel|2004|pp=73\u201374}} On 7&nbsp;August, the English reached the Seine, {{convert|12|mi|km}} south of Rouen, and turned south-east. By 12 August, Edward's army was encamped at [[Poissy]], 20 miles from Paris, having left a 20-mile wide swath of destruction down the left bank of the Seine,{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=515\u2013517}} burning villages to within {{convert|2|mi|km|sigfig=1}} of Paris.{{sfn|Ayton|2007b|p=71}}{{sfn|Rogers|2000|p=257}} Philip's army marched parallel to the English on the other bank, and in turn encamped north of Paris, where it was steadily reinforced. Paris was in uproar, swollen with refugees, and preparations were made to defend the capital street by street.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=514\u2013515, 517}}\n\n[[File:Phil6france.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|{{center|[[Philip VI of France]]}}|alt=A Medieval image of Philip IV seated, wearing a blue robe decorated with fleurs de lys]]\nPhilip sent orders to Duke John of Normandy insisting that he abandon the siege of Aiguillon and march his army north, which after delay and prevarication he did on 20 August \u2013 though he would ultimately not arrive in time to change the course of events in the north.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=512\u2013513, 514, 519, 539}} The French army outside Paris consisted of some 8,000 [[men-at-arms]], 6,000 crossbowmen, and many infantry [[Feudal levies|levies]]. Philip sent a challenge on 14&nbsp;August suggesting that the two armies do battle at a mutually agreed time and place in the area. Edward indicated that he would meet Philip to the south of the Seine, without actually committing himself. On 16&nbsp;August the French moved into position; Edward promptly burnt down Poissy, destroyed the bridge there, and marched north.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=517\u2013519, 520}}{{sfn|Harari|1999|p=385}}\n\nThe French had carried out a [[scorched earth]] policy, carrying away all stores of food and so forcing the English to spread out over a wide area to forage, which greatly slowed them. Bands of French peasants attacked some of the smaller groups of foragers. Philip reached the River Somme a day's march ahead of Edward. He based himself at [[Amiens]] and sent large detachments to hold every bridge and ford across the Somme between Amiens and the sea. The English were now trapped in an area which had been stripped of food. The French moved out of Amiens and advanced westwards, towards the English. They were now willing to give battle, knowing that they would have the advantage of being able to stand on the defensive while the English were forced to try and fight their way past them.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=520\u2013521, 522}}\n\nEdward was determined to break the French blockade of the Somme{{sfn|Ormrod|2012|p=277}} and probed at several points, vainly attacking [[Hangest-sur-Somme|Hangest]] and [[Pont-Remy]] before moving west along the river. English supplies were running out and the army was ragged, starving and beginning to suffer from a drop in morale.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=521}} On the evening of 24 August the English were encamped north of [[Acheux-en-Vimeu|Acheux]] while the French were {{convert|6|mi|km|sigfig=1}} away at [[Abbeville]]. During the night the English marched on a tidal ford named [[Blanchetaque]]. The far bank was defended by a force of 3,500 French. [[English longbow]]men and mounted men-at-arms waded into the tidal river and after [[Battle of Blanchetaque|a short, sharp fight]] routed the French. The main French army had followed the English, and their scouts captured some stragglers and several wagons, but Edward had broken free of immediate pursuit. Such was the French confidence that Edward would not ford the Somme that the area beyond had not been denuded, allowing Edward's army to plunder it and resupply.{{sfn|Hardy|2010|pp=64\u201365}}{{sfn|Burne|1999|pp=156\u2013160}}\n\nMeanwhile, the Flemings, having been rebuffed by the French at [[Estaires]], besieged [[B\u00e9thune]] on 14 August. After several setbacks they fell out among themselves, burnt their [[siege engine|siege equipment]] and gave up their expedition on 24 August.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=512, 524}} Edward received the news that he would not be reinforced by the Flemings shortly after crossing the Somme. The ships which were expected to be waiting off Crotoy were nowhere to be seen. Edward decided to engage Philip's army with the force he had. Having temporarily shaken off the French pursuit, he used the respite to prepare a defensive position at [[Cr\u00e9cy-en-Ponthieu]].{{sfn|Burne|1999|pp=156\u2013160}} The French returned to Abbeville, crossed the Somme at the bridge there, and doggedly set off after the English again.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=524\u2013525}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\n\n====English army====\n\nThe English army mainly comprised English and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] soldiers, along with some allied [[Duchy of Brittany|Breton]] and Flemish troops and a few German mercenaries.{{sfn|Burne|1999|p=138}}{{sfn|Allmand|2005|p=15}} The exact size and composition of the English force is not known. Contemporary estimates vary widely; for example [[Froissart]]'s third version of his [[Froissart's Chronicles|''Chronicles'']] more than doubles his estimate in the first.{{sfn|DeVries|1998|p=161}} Modern historians have estimated its size as from 7,000 to 15,000.{{sfn|DeVries|1998|p=157 n. 6}} Andrew Ayton suggests a figure of around 14,000: 2,500 men-at-arms, 5,000 longbowmen, 3,000 [[hobelar]]s (light cavalry and mounted archers) and 3,500 spearmen.{{sfn|Ayton|2007c|p=}} [[Clifford J. Rogers|Clifford Rogers]] suggests 15,000: 2,500 men-at-arms, 7,000 longbowmen, 3,250 hobelars and 2,300 spearmen. [[Jonathan Sumption]], going by the carrying capacity of its original transport fleet, believes the force was around 7,000 to 10,000.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=497}} Up to a thousand men were convicted felons serving on the promise of a pardon at the end of the campaign.{{sfn|Ayton|2007b|p=69}}{{sfn|Ayton|2007c|p=195}} Many of the English, including many of the felons, were veterans; perhaps as many as half.{{sfn|Rogers|2000|pp=234\u2013235}}{{sfn|Ayton|2007c|pp=203, 207, 217}}\n\nThe men-at-arms of both armies wore a quilted [[gambeson]] under [[mail (armour)|mail armour]] which covered the body and limbs. This was supplemented by varying amounts of [[plate armour]] on the body and limbs, more so for wealthier and more experienced men. Heads were protected by [[bascinet]]s: open-faced military iron or steel helmets, with mail attached to the lower edge of the helmet to protect the throat, neck and shoulders. A moveable visor (face guard) protected the face. [[Heater shield]]s, typically made from thin wood overlaid with leather, were carried. The English men-at-arms were all dismounted. The weapons they used are not recorded, but in similar battles they used their lances as pikes, cut them down to use as short spears, or fought with swords and battle axes.{{sfn|Edge|Paddock|1988|pp=68\u201383}}{{sfn|Prestwich|2007b|p=155}}{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=90\u201391}}{{sfn|Mallett|1974|p=37}}\n\n[[File:Bodkin1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|alt=a photograph of an iron arrowhead|{{center|A modern replica of a [[bodkin point]] arrowhead used to penetrate armour by [[English longbows]]}}]]\nThe [[longbow]] used by the English and Welsh archers was unique to them; it took up to ten years to master and could discharge up to ten arrows per minute well over {{convert|300|m|ft}}.<ref group=note>This range is given by material scientists and is supported by most modern historians.

During the morning of the battle, they were each issued with two more quivers, for a total of 72 arrows per man. This was only sufficient for perhaps fifteen minutes shooting at the maximum rate, although as the battle wore on the rate would slow. Regular resupply of ammunition would be required from the wagons to the rear; the archers would also venture forward during pauses in the fighting to retrieve arrows.{{sfn|Strickland|Hardy|2011|pp=31, 278\u2013279}} Modern historians suggest that half a million arrows may have been shot during the battle.{{sfn|Hardy|2010|p=69}}{{sfn|Ayton|Preston|2007|pp=360, 362}}\n\n[[File:English gun used at Crecy.jpg|thumb|alt=a pen and ink drawing of a very early [[Bombard (weapon)|bombard]]|{{center|Depiction of an English [[Bombard (weapon)|bombard]] as used at the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy}}]]\nThe English army was also equipped with several types of gunpowder weapons, in unknown numbers: small guns firing lead balls; [[ribauldequin]]s firing either metal arrows or [[grapeshot]]; and [[Bombard (weapon)|bombards]], an early form of cannon firing metal balls {{convert|3.2|\u2013|3.6|in|mm|sigfig=1}} in diameter.

The French attacked the English while they were [[Cr\u00e9cy campaign|traversing northern France]] during the [[Hundred Years' War]] resulting in an English victory and heavy loss of life among the French.\n\nThe English army had landed in the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] on 12&nbsp;July. It had burnt a path of destruction through some of the richest lands in France to within {{convert|2|mi|km|sigfig=1}} of Paris, [[looting|sacking]] many towns on the way. The English then marched north, hoping to link up with an allied Flemish army which had invaded from [[County of Flanders|Flanders]]. Hearing that the Flemish had turned back, and having [[Battle of Blanchetaque|temporarily outdistanced]] the pursuing French, Edward had his army prepare a defensive position on a hillside near [[Cr\u00e9cy-en-Ponthieu]]. Late on 26 August the French army, which greatly outnumbered the English, attacked.\n\nDuring a brief archery duel a large force of French mercenary [[crossbowmen]] was routed by Welsh and  [[English longbowmen]]. The French then launched a series of cavalry charges by their mounted [[knights]]. These were disordered by their impromptu nature, by having to force their way through the fleeing crossbowmen, by the muddy ground, by having to charge uphill, and by the pits dug by the English. The attacks were further broken up by the effective fire from the English [[Archery|archers]], which caused heavy casualties. By the time the French charges reached the English [[men-at-arms]], who had dismounted for the battle, they had lost much of their impetus. The ensuing [[hand-to-hand combat]] was described as \"murderous, without pity, cruel, and very horrible\". The French charges continued late into the night, all with the same result: fierce fighting followed by a French repulse.\n\nThe English then [[Siege of Calais (1346\u201347)|laid siege to the port of Calais]]. The battle crippled the French army's ability to relieve the siege; the town fell to the English the following year and remained under English rule for more than two centuries, [[Siege of Calais (1558)|until 1558]]. Cr\u00e9cy established the effectiveness of the [[longbow]] as a dominant weapon on the Western European battlefield.\n\n==Background==\n\nSince the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, English monarchs had held titles and lands within France, the possession of which made them [[vassal]]s of the kings of France.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=394}} Following a series of disagreements between [[Philip VI of France]] ({{reign|1328|1350}}) and [[Edward III of England]] ({{reign|1327|1377}}), on 24 May 1337 Philip's [[Conseil du Roi|Great Council]] in Paris agreed that the lands held by Edward in France should be taken back into Philip's hands on the grounds that Edward was in breach of his obligations as a vassal. This marked the start of the [[Hundred Years' War]], which was to last 116 years.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=184}}\n\n[[File:Edward III (18th century).jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=a head and shoulders drawing of Edward III, in armour and bearing a sword|{{center|[[Edward III of England]]}}]]\nIn 1345 Edward's main army sailed on 29 June and anchored off [[Sluys]] in Flanders until 22 July, while Edward attended to diplomatic affairs.{{sfn|Lucas|1929|pp=519\u2013524}} When it sailed, probably intending to land in [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]], it was scattered by a storm.

More than 5,000 French soldiers and civilians were killed; among the few prisoners was [[Raoul II of Brienne, Count of Eu|Raoul, Count of Eu]], the [[Constable of France]]. On 29 July Edward sent his fleet back to England, laden with loot, with a letter ordering that reinforcements, supplies and money be collected, embarked and loaded respectively, and sent to rendezvous with his army at [[Le Crotoy|Crotoy]], on the north bank of the mouth of the [[River Somme]].{{sfn|Harari|1999|p=387}}{{sfn|Ayton|2007b|p=75}} The English marched out towards the [[Seine River|River Seine]] on 1&nbsp;August.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=507\u2013510}}\n\nThe French military position was difficult. Their main army, commanded by John, Duke of Normandy, the son and heir of Philip VI, was committed to the intractable [[siege of Aiguillon]] in the south west. After his surprise landing in Normandy Edward was devastating some of the richest land in France and flaunting his ability to march at will through France. On 2&nbsp;August, a small English force supported by many [[Flanders|Flemings]] invaded France from Flanders; French defences there were completely inadequate. The treasury was all but empty. On 29 July, Philip proclaimed the ''arri\u00e8re-ban'' for northern France, ordering every able-bodied male to assemble at [[Rouen]], where Philip himself arrived on the 31st.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=512\u2013513}}{{sfn|Livingstone|Witzel|2004|pp=73\u201374}} On 7&nbsp;August, the English reached the Seine, {{convert|12|mi|km}} south of Rouen, and turned south-east.

Philip sent a challenge on 14&nbsp;August suggesting that the two armies do battle at a mutually agreed time and place in the area. Edward indicated that he would meet Philip to the south of the Seine, without actually committing himself. On 16&nbsp;August the French moved into position; Edward promptly burnt down Poissy, destroyed the bridge there, and marched north.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=517\u2013519, 520}}{{sfn|Harari|1999|p=385}}\n\nThe French had carried out a [[scorched earth]] policy, carrying away all stores of food and so forcing the English to spread out over a wide area to forage, which greatly slowed them. Bands of French peasants attacked some of the smaller groups of foragers. Philip reached the River Somme a day's march ahead of Edward. He based himself at [[Amiens]] and sent large detachments to hold every bridge and ford across the Somme between Amiens and the sea. The English were now trapped in an area which had been stripped of food. The French moved out of Amiens and advanced westwards, towards the English. They were now willing to give battle, knowing that they would have the advantage of being able to stand on the defensive while the English were forced to try and fight their way past them.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=520\u2013521, 522}}\n\nEdward was determined to break the French blockade of the Somme{{sfn|Ormrod|2012|p=277}} and probed at several points, vainly attacking [[Hangest-sur-Somme|Hangest]] and [[Pont-Remy]] before moving west along the river. English supplies were running out and the army was ragged, starving and beginning to suffer from a drop in morale.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=521}} On the evening of 24 August the English were encamped north of [[Acheux-en-Vimeu|Acheux]] while the French were {{convert|6|mi|km|sigfig=1}} away at [[Abbeville]]. During the night the English marched on a tidal ford named [[Blanchetaque]]. The far bank was defended by a force of 3,500 French. [[English longbow]]men and mounted men-at-arms waded into the tidal river and after [[Battle of Blanchetaque|a short, sharp fight]] routed the French. The main French army had followed the English, and their scouts captured some stragglers and several wagons, but Edward had broken free of immediate pursuit. Such was the French confidence that Edward would not ford the Somme that the area beyond had not been denuded, allowing Edward's army to plunder it and resupply.{{sfn|Hardy|2010|pp=64\u201365}}{{sfn|Burne|1999|pp=156\u2013160}}\n\nMeanwhile, the Flemings, having been rebuffed by the French at [[Estaires]], besieged [[B\u00e9thune]] on 14 August. After several setbacks they fell out among themselves, burnt their [[siege engine|siege equipment]] and gave up their expedition on 24 August.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=512, 524}} Edward received the news that he would not be reinforced by the Flemings shortly after crossing the Somme. The ships which were expected to be waiting off Crotoy were nowhere to be seen. Edward decided to engage Philip's army with the force he had. Having temporarily shaken off the French pursuit, he used the respite to prepare a defensive position at [[Cr\u00e9cy-en-Ponthieu]].{{sfn|Burne|1999|pp=156\u2013160}} The French returned to Abbeville, crossed the Somme at the bridge there, and doggedly set off after the English again.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=524\u2013525}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\n\n====English army====\n\nThe English army mainly comprised English and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] soldiers, along with some allied [[Duchy of Brittany|Breton]] and Flemish troops and a few German mercenaries.{{sfn|Burne|1999|p=138}}{{sfn|Allmand|2005|p=15}} The exact size and composition of the English force is not known.

Heads were protected by [[bascinet]]s: open-faced military iron or steel helmets, with mail attached to the lower edge of the helmet to protect the throat, neck and shoulders. A moveable visor (face guard) protected the face. [[Heater shield]]s, typically made from thin wood overlaid with leather, were carried. The English men-at-arms were all dismounted. The weapons they used are not recorded, but in similar battles they used their lances as pikes, cut them down to use as short spears, or fought with swords and battle axes.{{sfn|Edge|Paddock|1988|pp=68\u201383}}{{sfn|Prestwich|2007b|p=155}}{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=90\u201391}}{{sfn|Mallett|1974|p=37}}\n\n[[File:Bodkin1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|alt=a photograph of an iron arrowhead|{{center|A modern replica of a [[bodkin point]] arrowhead used to penetrate armour by [[English longbows]]}}]]\nThe [[longbow]] used by the English and Welsh archers was unique to them; it took up to ten years to master and could discharge up to ten arrows per minute well over {{convert|300|m|ft}}.<ref group=note>This range is given by material scientists and is supported by most modern historians.

The Italians stayed in the van, while the mounted men-at-arms left their accompanying infantry and wagons behind.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=526}}{{sfn|Strickland|Hardy|2011|p=31}} Discipline was lost; the French were hampered by the absence of their Constable, who was normally responsible for marshalling and leading their army, but who had been captured at Caen.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=507\u2013511}}{{sfn|Livingstone|Witzel|2004|pp=282\u2013283}} Once it halted, men, especially infantry, were continually joining Philip's battle as they marched north west from Abbeville.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=438\u2013440}}{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=526}}\n\nAfter reconnoitring the English position, a [[council of war]] was held where the senior French officials, who were completely confident of victory, advised an attack, but not until the next day.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007b|p=147}} The army was tired from a 12-mile march, and needed to reorganise so as to be able to attack in strength.{{sfn|Schnerb|2007|pp=270\u2013271}} It was also known that the [[Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy|Count of Savoy]], with more than 500 men-at-arms, was marching to join the French and was nearby.{{sfn|Schnerb|2007|pp=269, 271}} (He intercepted some of the French survivors the day after the battle).{{sfn|Schnerb|2007|p=269}} Despite this advice, the French attacked later the same afternoon; it is unclear from the contemporary sources whether this was a deliberate choice by Philip, or because too many of the French knights kept pressing forward and the battle commenced against his wishes.{{sfn|DeVries|1998|pp=166\u2013167}} Philip's plan was to use the long-range missiles of his crossbowmen to soften up the English infantry and disorder, and possibly dishearten, their formations, so as to allow the accompanying mounted men-at-arms to break into their ranks and rout them.{{sfn|DeVries|1998|p=175}}{{sfn|Ayton|Preston|2007|p=369}} Modern historians have generally considered this to have been a practical approach, and one with proven success against other armies.{{sfn|Mitchell|2008|pp=248\u2013249}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Archery duel===\n[[File:BattleofCrecyEngraving.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A black and white engraving of a mounted knight charging|{{center|Battle of Cr\u00e9cy (19th-century engraving)}}]]\n\nThe French army moved forward late in the afternoon, unfurling their sacred battle banner, the ''[[oriflamme]]'', indicating that no prisoners would be taken.{{sfn|DeVries|1998|p=166}}{{sfn|King|2017|pp=109\u2013110}} As they advanced, a sudden rainstorm broke over the field. The English archers de-strung their bows to avoid the strings becoming slackened; the Genoese with their crossbows did not need to take precautions, as their bowstrings were made of leather.{{sfn|DeVries|2015|pp=318\u2013319}} The Genoese engaged the English longbowmen in an archery duel.{{sfn|DeVries|1998|p=167}} The longbowmen outranged their opponents{{sfn|Rogers|1998|p=238}} and had a [[rate of fire]] more than three times greater.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=532}}{{sfn|Prestwich|2007b|p=148}} The crossbowmen were also without their protective pavises, which were still with the French baggage, as were their reserve supplies of ammunition.{{sfn|Ayton|Preston|2007|p=369}}{{sfn|Bennett|1994|p=10}}{{sfn|Wailly|1987|p=66}} The mud also impeded their ability to reload, which required them to press the stirrups of their weapons into the ground, and thus slowed their rate of fire.{{sfn|DeVries|2015|pp=318\u2013319}} The Italians were rapidly defeated and fled;{{sfn|DeVries|1998|pp=168\u2013169}} aware of their vulnerability without their pavises, they may have made only a token effort.{{sfn|Mitchell|2008|p=249}} Modern historians disagree as to how many casualties they suffered, but as some contemporary sources suggest they may have failed to get off any shots at all and the most recent specialist study of this duel concludes that they hastily shot perhaps two volleys, then withdrew before any real exchange with the English could develop, they were probably light.{{sfn|Mitchell|2008|p=249}}\n\nThe knights and nobles following in Alen\u00e7on's division, hampered by the routed mercenaries, hacked at them as they retreated. By most contemporary accounts the crossbowmen were considered cowards at best and more likely traitors,{{sfn|Mitchell|2008|p=250}} and many of them were killed by the French.{{sfn|DeVries|2015|p=319}} The clash of the retreating Genoese and the advancing French cavalry threw the leading battle into disarray. The longbowmen continued to shoot into the massed troops. The discharge of the English bombards added to the confusion, though contemporary accounts differ as to whether they inflicted significant casualties.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007b|p=148}}{{sfn|Mitchell|2008|p=242}}\n\n===Cavalry charges===\nAlen\u00e7on's battle then launched a [[Charge (warfare)|cavalry charge]]. This was disordered by its impromptu nature, by having to force its way through the fleeing Italians, by the muddy ground, by having to charge uphill, and by the pits dug by the English.{{sfn|Bennett|1994|p=7}} The attack was further broken up by the heavy and effective shooting from the English archers, which caused many casualties.{{sfn|Rogers|1998|p=240}} It is likely the archers preserved their ammunition until they had a reasonable chance of penetrating the French armour, which would be a range of about {{convert|80|m|ft}}.{{sfn|Ayton|Preston|2007|p=371}} The armoured French riders had some protection, but their horses were completely unarmoured and were killed or wounded in large numbers.{{sfn|Livingstone|Witzel|2004|p=290}} Disabled horses fell, spilling or trapping their riders and causing following ranks to swerve to avoid them and fall into even further disorder.{{sfn|Ayton|Preston|2007|p=373}} Wounded horses fled across the hillside in panic.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=528\u2013529}} By the time the tight formation of English men-at-arms and spearmen received the French charge it had lost much of its impetus.{{sfn|DeVries|1998|pp=170\u2013171}}\n[[File:Battle of Cr\u00e9cy - Grandes Chroniques de France (c.1415), f.152v - BL Cotton MS Nero E II.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A colourful and stylised picture of late-Medieval cavalry battle|{{center|Battle of Cr\u00e9cy, as envisaged 80 years after the battle}}]]\nA contemporary described the [[hand-to-hand combat]] which ensued as \"murderous, without pity, cruel, and very horrible\".{{sfn|DeVries|1998|p=171}} Men-at-arms who lost their footing, or who were thrown from wounded horses, were trampled underfoot, crushed by falling horses and bodies and suffocated in the mud. After the battle, many French bodies were recovered with no marks on them. Alen\u00e7on was among those killed.{{sfn|Livingstone|Witzel|2004|p=292}}{{sfn|DeVries|2015|p=313}}{{sfn|Prestwich|2007b|p=150}} The French attack was beaten off. English infantry moved forward to knife the French wounded, loot the bodies and recover arrows.{{sfn|Livingstone|Witzel|2004|p=289}}{{sfn|Ayton|2007c|p=192}} Some sources say Edward had given orders that, contrary to custom,{{sfn|King|2002|pp=269\u2013270}} no prisoners be taken; outnumbered as he was he did not want to lose fighting men to escorting and guarding captives. In any event, there is no record of any prisoners being taken until the next day, after the battle.{{sfn|King|2017|pp=109\u2013110}}{{sfn|DeVries|1998|p=163}}\n\nFresh forces of French cavalry moved into position at the foot of the hill and repeated Alen\u00e7on's charge. They had the same problems as Alen\u00e7on's force, with the added disadvantage that the ground they were advancing over was littered with dead and wounded horses and men.{{sfn|Rogers|1998|p=240}}{{sfn|Prestwich|2007b|p=150}} Ayton and Preston write of \"long mounds of fallen warhorses and men&nbsp;... add[ing] significantly to the difficulties facing fresh formations&nbsp;... as they sought to approach the English position\".{{sfn|Ayton|Preston|2007|p=373}} Nevertheless, they charged home, albeit in such a disordered state that they were again unable to break into the English formation. A prolonged m\u00eal\u00e9e resulted, with a report that at one point the Prince of Wales was beaten to his knees. One account has the Prince's [[standard-bearer]] standing on his [[standard (flag)|banner]] to prevent its capture. A modern historian has described the fighting as \"horrific carnage\".{{sfn|Prestwich|2007b|p=157}} Edward sent forward a detachment from his reserve battle to rescue the situation.{{sfn|Ayton|Preston|2007|pp=368, 376}} The French were again repulsed. They came again. The English ranks were thinned, but those in the rear stepped forward to fill the gaps.{{sfn|DeVries|1998|p=171}}{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=529}}\n\nHow many times the French charged is disputed, but they continued late into the night,{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=438\u2013440}} with the dusk and then dark disorganising the French yet further.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007b|p=157}} All had the same result: fierce fighting followed by a French retreat. In one attack the Count of Blois dismounted his men and had them advance on foot; the Count's body was found on the field.{{sfn|Ayton|Preston|2007|p=375}} The French nobility stubbornly refused to yield. There was no lack of courage on either side.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007b|p=157}} Famously, blind King John of Bohemia tied his horse's [[bridle]] to those of his attendants and galloped into the twilight; all were dragged from their horses and killed.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=529}}{{sfn|DeVries|1998|p=172}} There are accounts of entire English battles advancing on occasion to clear away broken French charges milling in front of them, then withdrawing in good order to their original positions.{{sfn|Ayton|Preston|2007|pp=375, 376}}\n\nPhilip himself was caught up in the fighting, had two horses killed underneath him, and received an arrow in the jaw.{{sfn|Rogers|1998|p=238}} The bearer of the ''oriflamme'' was a particular target for the English archers; he was seen to fall but survived, albeit abandoning the sacred banner to be captured.{{sfn|Livingstone|Witzel|2004|p=299}} Finally, Philip abandoned the field of battle, although it is unclear why. It was nearly midnight and the battle petered out, with the majority of the French army melting away from the battlefield.{{sfn|DeVries|1998|pp=172\u2013173}}{{sfn|Burne|1999|p=182}} The English slept where they had fought. The next morning substantial French forces were still arriving on the battlefield, to be charged by the English men-at-arms, now mounted, routed and pursued for miles.{{sfn|DeVries|1998|p=173}}{{sfn|Oman|1998|p=145}} Their losses alone were reported as several thousand,{{sfn|Burne|1999|p=185}} including the Duke of Lorraine.{{sfn|Ayton|2007a|p=20}} Meanwhile, a few wounded or stunned Frenchmen were pulled from the heaps of dead men and dying horses and taken prisoner.{{sfn|Livingstone|Witzel|2004|p=304}}{{sfn|Prestwich|2007b|p=151}}\n\n==Casualties==\n\n[[File:Edward III counting the dead on the battlefield of Cr\u00e9cy.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A colourful late-Medieval depiction of [[Edward III]] counting the dead after the battle|{{center|[[Edward III]] counting the dead on the battlefield of Cr\u00e9cy}}]]\n\nThe losses in the battle were highly asymmetrical. All contemporary sources agree that English casualties were very low.{{sfn|DeVries|1998|p=174}}{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=530}} It was reported that English deaths comprised 3 or 4 men-at-arms and a small number of the rank and file, for a total of 40 according to a roll-call after the battle.{{sfn|Ayton|2007c|pp=190\u2013191 (+ nn. 151, 152)}}{{sfn|Rogers|2000|p=270}} It has been suggested by some modern historians that this is too few and that English deaths might have numbered around 300.{{sfn|Ayton|2007c|p=191}}{{sfn|Rogers|2000|p=270}} To date, only two Englishmen killed at the battle have been identified;{{sfn|Ayton|2007a|p=28}} two English knights were also taken prisoner, although it is unclear at what stage in the battle this happened.{{sfn|Ayton|2007c|p=191}}\n\nSimilarly, all contemporary sources consider the French casualties to have been very high. According to a count made by the English [[heralds]] after the battle, the bodies of 1,542 French noble men-at-arms were found, plus probably several hundred in the pursuit which followed.{{sfn|Ayton|2007a|pp=19\u201320 n. 79}}{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=530}} Over 2,200 heraldic coats were taken from the field of battle as war booty by the English.{{sfn|Ayton|2007a|pp=19\u201320 n. 79}} Jonathan Sumption describes the total French losses as \"catastrophic\",{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=530}} and Ayton refers to the \"extraordinarily heavy casualties suffered by the French\" and \"breathtaking losses\".{{sfn|Ayton|2007a|pp=19\u201320}} An estimate by the chronicler [[Geoffrey the Baker]], deemed credible by modern historians, says 4,000 French knights were killed.{{sfn|Prestwich|1996|p=331}}{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=80}} Among the known knightly dead were two kings, nine princes, ten [[count]]s, a [[duke]], an [[archbishop]] and a [[bishop]].{{sfn|DeVries|1998|pp=173\u2013174}} According to Ayton, the heavy losses of the French can also be attributed to the [[Chivalry|chivalric]] ideals held by knights of the time; nobles would have preferred to die in battle, rather than dishonourably flee the field, especially in view of their fellow knights.{{sfn|Ayton|2007a|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nNo reliable figures exist for losses among the common French soldiery, although they were also considered to have been heavy. [[Jean Le Bel]] estimated 15,000\u201316,000.{{sfn|DeVries|1998|p=174}} Froissart writes that the French army suffered a total of 30,000 killed or captured.{{sfn|Froissart|1908|pp=99\u2013107}} The modern historian [[Alfred Burne]] estimates 10,000 infantry, as \"a pure guess\",{{sfn|Burne|1999|p=184}} for a total of 12,000 French dead.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=80}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThe result of the battle is described by Clifford Rogers as \"a total victory for the English\",{{sfn|Rogers|1993|p=99}} and by Ayton as \"unprecedented\" and \"a devastating military humiliation\".{{sfn|Ayton|2007a|pp=7, 20}} Sumption considers it \"a political catastrophe for the French Crown\".{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=532}} The battle was reported to the [[Parliament of England|English parliament]] on 13 September in glowing terms as a sign of divine favour and justification for the huge cost of the war to date.{{sfn|Ayton|2007a|p=33}} A contemporary chronicler opined \"By haste and disorganisation were the French destroyed\".{{sfn|Schnerb|2007|p=271}} Rogers writes that, among other factors, the English \"benefitted from superior organisation, cohesion and leadership\" and from \"the indiscipline of the French\".{{sfn|Rogers|1993|p=99}} According to Ayton \"England's international reputation as a military power was established in an evening's hard fighting\".{{sfn|Ayton|2007b|p=107}}\n\nEdward ended the campaign by [[Siege of Calais (1346)|laying siege to Calais]], which fell after eleven months, the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy having crippled the French army's ability to relieve the town.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=73}} This secured an English [[entrep\u00f4t]] into northern France which was [[Pale of Calais|held]] for two hundred years.{{sfn|Burne|1999|pp=207\u2013217}} The battle established the effectiveness of the longbow as a dominant weapon on the Western European battlefield.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=438\u2013440}} English and Welsh archers served as mercenaries in Italy in significant numbers, and some as far afield as Hungary.{{sfn|Ayton|2007a|p=30}} Modern historian [[Joseph Dahmus]] includes the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy

Malenchenko, Musabayev and cosmonaut [[Valeri Polyakov]] became the 16th resident Mir crew, with Malenchenko in command. The crew conducted medical experiments and experiments in materials science. There were many problems during the mission, which finally ended with the first successful manual docking of a [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]] supply ship at Mir by Malenchenko. On November 4, 1994, Malenchenko, Musabayev and [[Ulf Merbold]] returned to Earth aboard their Soyuz capsule after landing 88&nbsp;km northeast of [[Arkalyk]].

For the spacewalk, Malenchenko donned an Orlan spacesuit with the blue stripe. The duration of the spacewalk was 5 hours and 51 minutes. The spacewalk was delayed for about an hour due to a small leak between Space Station modules. The spacewalk started from the Pirs Docking Compartment Module at 15:37 GMT. The first task for Padalka and Malenchenko was to relocate the Strela-2 boom from the Pirs module to the forward end of the Zarya module. The relocation was needed since Pirs module will be detached from the Space Station in the future for the arrival of the new Multi-purpose Laboratory Module (MLM) '''Nauka'''. The next task completed by Padalka and Malenchenko was to deploy a 21-inch diameter spherical satellite. The two cosmonauts also  retrieved five debris shields from the Pirs Module, prior to installing them on the Zvezda Module. They also completed several get-ahead tasks (since the both opted not to take rests during the night passes) as the duo were about an hour ahead of the timeline. They retrieved an external experiment called Biorisk from the Pirs Module for return to Earth, and  for added stability installed two structural support struts between the Pirs Module and the EVA ladder. Padalka and Malenchenko then both ingress the Pirs Module, prior to closing the hatch and beginning the re-pressurisation procedure, to end a highly successful spacewalk.\n[[File:ISS-47 Yuri Malenchenko with camera in the Cupola module.jpg|thumb|Yuri Malenchenko in the Cupola module during Expedition 47.]]\n\n===Expedition 46/47===\n[[File:Soyuz TMA-19M crew in front of their spacecraft.jpg|thumb|left| The [[Soyuz TMA-19M]] crew during a fit check]]\nMalenchenko arrived at the ISS [[Soyuz TMA-19M]] to join the Expedition 46 crew.

Next they disconnected eight other cables between PMA-2 and the ''Destiny''. Malenchenko removed and replaced a failed electrical circuit box and together with Whitson removed the active [[Common Berthing Mechanism]] cover that was located at the outboard end of ''Harmony''.

For the spacewalk, Malenchenko donned an Orlan spacesuit with the blue stripe. The duration of the spacewalk was 5 hours and 51 minutes. The spacewalk was delayed for about an hour due to a small leak between Space Station modules. The spacewalk started from the Pirs Docking Compartment Module at 15:37 GMT. The first task for Padalka and Malenchenko was to relocate the Strela-2 boom from the Pirs module to the forward end of the Zarya module. The relocation was needed since Pirs module will be detached from the Space Station in the future for the arrival of the new Multi-purpose Laboratory Module (MLM) '''Nauka'''. The next task completed by Padalka and Malenchenko was to deploy a 21-inch diameter spherical satellite. The two cosmonauts also  retrieved five debris shields from the Pirs Module, prior to installing them on the Zvezda Module. They also completed several get-ahead tasks (since the both opted not to take rests during the night passes) as the duo were about an hour ahead of the timeline. They retrieved an external experiment called Biorisk from the Pirs Module for return to Earth, and  for added stability installed two structural support struts between the Pirs Module and the EVA ladder. Padalka and Malenchenko then both ingress the Pirs Module, prior to closing the hatch and beginning the re-pressurisation procedure, to end a highly successful spacewalk.\n[[File:ISS-47 Yuri Malenchenko with camera in the Cupola module.jpg|thumb|Yuri Malenchenko in the Cupola module during Expedition 47.]]\n\n===Expedition 46/47===\n[[File:Soyuz TMA-19M crew in front of their spacecraft.jpg|thumb|left| The [[Soyuz TMA-19M]] crew during a fit check]]\nMalenchenko arrived at the ISS [[Soyuz TMA-19M]] to join the Expedition 46 crew.

It gave its name to the final four years of the [[French Revolution]]. Mainstream historiography<ref>For example F. Furet and D. Richet in \u201cFrench Revolution\u201d (Macmillan, 1970)</ref> also uses the term in reference to the period from the dissolution of the [[National Convention]] on 26 October 1795 (4 Brumaire) to Napoleon's coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. \n\nThe Directory was continually at war with foreign coalitions which at different times included [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. It annexed [[Austrian Netherlands|Belgium]] and the [[left bank of the Rhine]], while Bonaparte conquered a large part of Italy. The Directory established 196 short-lived sister republics modelled after France, in Italy, [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]] and the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]]. The conquered cities and states were required to send to France huge amounts of money, as well as art treasures, which were used to fill the new [[Louvre]] museum in Paris. An army led by Bonaparte tried to conquer [[Eyalet of Egypt|Egypt]] and marched as far as [[Saint-Jean-d'Acre]] in [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]]. The Directory defeated a resurgence of  the [[War in the Vend\u00e9e]], the royalist-led civil war in the Vend\u00e9e region, but failed in its venture to support the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] and create an Irish Republic.\n\nThe French economy was in continual crisis during the Directory. At the beginning, the treasury was empty; the paper money, the [[Assignat]], had fallen to a fraction of its value, and prices soared. The Directory stopped printing assignats and restored the value of the money, but this caused a new crisis; prices and wages fell, and economic activity slowed to a standstill.\n\nIn its first two years, the Directory concentrated on ending the excesses of the [[Jacobin]] [[Reign of Terror]]; mass executions stopped, and measures taken against exiled priests and royalists were relaxed. The Jacobin political club was closed and the government crushed an armed uprising planned by the Jacobins and an early socialist revolutionary, [[Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Babeuf]], known as \"''Gracchus'' Babeuf\". However, following the discovery of a royalist conspiracy including a prominent general, [[Jean-Charles Pichegru]], the Jacobins took charge of the new Councils and hardened the measures against the Church and \u00e9migr\u00e9s. The Jacobins took two additional seats in the Directory, hopelessly dividing it.\n\nIn 1799, after several defeats, French victories in the Netherlands and Switzerland restored the French military position, but the Directory had lost the support of all the political factions. Bonaparte returned from Egypt in October, and was engaged by the [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s]] and others to carry out a parliamentary coup d'\u00e9tat on 8\u20139 November 1799. The coup abolished the Directory, and replaced it with the [[French Consulate]] led by Bonaparte.\n\n== Prehistory and genesis ==\n{{see also|History of France#Revolutionary France (1789\u20131799)}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}<!--many subsections have no or few citations-->\n\n=== Ending the rule of Robespierre ===\n{{see also|History of France#Death-sentencing politicians (February\u2013July 1794)|9 Thermidor|Fall of Maximilien Robespierre}}\n[[File:Max Adamo Sturz Robespierres.JPG|thumb|The Convention rises against Robespierre (27 July 1794)]]\n[[File:Execution robespierre, saint just....jpg|thumb|The execution of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and his chief followers on 28 July 1794 ended the [[Reign of Terror]] and opened the way to the Directory]]\nOn 27 July 1794, members of the [[French Convention]], the revolutionary parliament of France, rose up against its leader [[Maximilien Robespierre]], who was in the midst of executing thousands of suspected enemies of the Revolution. Robespierre and his leading followers were declared outside the law, and on 28 July were arrested and guillotined the same day. The Revolutionary Tribunal, which had sent thousands to the guillotine, ceased meeting and its head, [[Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville|Fouquier-Tinville]], was arrested and imprisoned, and after trial was himself sentenced to death. More than five hundred suspected counter-revolutionaries awaiting trial and execution were immediately released.\n\n=== Purpose of the new Constitution ===\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Boissy d-Anglas.jpg|thumb|[[Fran\u00e7ois Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas]], one of the principal authors of the [[Constitution of 1795]], which created the Directory]]\nIn July 1794, the members of the Convention began planning a new form of government and drafting a new Constitution, which would become the [[Constitution of the Year III]] (August 1795). An important aim was to prevent too much power from becoming concentrated in the hands of one man. One of the authors of the new Constitution, [[Fran\u00e7ois Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas]], wrote to the Convention:\n<blockquote>We propose to you to compose an executive power of five members, renewed with one new member each year, called the Directory. This executive will have a force concentrated enough that it will be swift and firm, but divided enough to make it impossible for any member to even consider becoming a tyrant. A single chief would be dangerous. Each member will preside for three months; he will have during this time the signature and seal of the head of state. By the slow and gradual replacement of members of the Directory, you will preserve the advantages of order and continuity and will have the advantages of unity without the inconveniences.<ref name=tulard/></blockquote>\n\n=== Structure of the new Constitution ===\nThe [[Constitution of the Year III]] (22 August 1795) began with the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] and declared that \"the Rights of Man in society are liberty, equality, security, and property\".{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=702}}  It guaranteed freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and freedom of labour, but forbade armed assemblies and even public meetings of political societies. Only individuals or public authorities could tender petitions.\n\nThe judicial system was reformed, and judges were given short terms of office: two years for justices of the peace, five for judges of department tribunals. They were elected, and could be re-elected, to assure their independence from the other branches of government.\n\nThe new legislature had two houses, a [[Council of Five Hundred]] and a [[Council of Ancients]] with two hundred fifty members. Electoral assemblies in each [[Cantons of France|''canton'' of France]], which brought together a total of thirty thousand qualified electors, chose representatives to an electoral assembly in each [[Departments of France|department]], which then elected the members of both houses. The members of this legislature had a term of three years, with one-third of the members renewed every year. The Ancients could not initiate new laws, but could veto those proposed by the Council of Five Hundred.\n\nThe Constitution established a unique kind of executive, a five-man Directory chosen by the legislature.<ref>J. F,. Bosher, ''The French Revolution'' (1988), pp. 226\u201330</ref><ref>Gershoy, ''The French Revolution and Napoleon'' (1964) pp. 303\u20138</ref> It required the Council of Five Hundred to prepare, by secret ballot, a list of candidates for the Directory. The Council of Ancients then chose, again by secret ballot, the Directors from that provided list. The Constitution required that Directors be at least forty years old. To assure gradual but continual change, one Director, chosen by lot, was replaced each year. Ministers for the various departments of State aided the Directors. These ministers did not form a council or cabinet and had no general powers of government.\n\nThe new Constitution sought to create a [[separation of powers]]; the Directors had no voice in legislation or taxation, nor could Directors or Ministers sit in either house. To assure that the Directors would have some independence, each would be elected by one portion of the legislature, and they could not be removed by the legislature unless they violated the law.<ref name=tulard>Jean Tulard, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Fayard, Alfred Fierro, ''Histoire et dictionnaire de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', Robert Laffont, Paris, 1998, pp. 198\u2013199. (In French)</ref>\n\nUnder the new [[Constitution of 1795]], to be eligible to vote in the elections for the Councils, voters were required to meet certain minimum property and residency standards. In towns with over six thousand population, they had to own or rent a property with a revenue equal to the standard income for at least one hundred fifty or two hundred days of work, and to have lived in their residence for at least a year. This ruled out a large part of the French population.\n\nThe big loser under the new system was the City of Paris, which had dominated events in the first part of the Revolution. On 24 August 1794,  the committees of the sections of Paris, the bastions of the Jacobins, which had provided most of the manpower for demonstrations and invasions of the Convention, were abolished. Shortly afterwards, on 31 August, the municipality of Paris, which had been the domain of Danton and Robespierre, was abolished, and the city placed under direct control of the national government. When the Law of 19 Vend\u00e9miaire Year IV (11 October 1795), in application of the [[Constitution of the Year III|new Constitution]], created the first twelve ''[[arrondissement]]s'' of Paris, it established twelve new committees, one for each ''arrondissement''. The city became a new [[Departments of France|department]], the [[Seine (department)|department of the Seine]], replacing the former department of Paris created in 1790.<ref>Fierro, Alfred, ''Histoire et dictionnaire de Paris'' (1996), Robert Laffont, p. 608, (French)</ref><ref>''Loi du 19 vend\u00e9miaire, an 4.

On 21 September 1794, the remains of [[Jean-Paul Marat]], whose furious articles had promoted the Reign of Terror, were placed with great ceremony in the [[Pantheon (Paris)|Panth\u00e9on]], while on the same day, the moderate Convention member [[Antoine Christophe Merlin|Merlin de Thionville]] described the Jacobins as \"A hangout of outlaws\" and the \"knights of the guillotine\". Young men known as [[Muscadins]], largely from middle-class families, attacked the Jacobin and radical clubs. The new freedom of the press saw the appearance of a host of new newspapers and pamphlets from the left and the right, such as the royalist ''L'Orateur du peuple'' edited by [[Louis-Marie Stanislas Fr\u00e9ron|Stanislas Fr\u00e9ron]], an extreme Jacobin who had moved to the extreme right, and at the opposite end of the spectrum, the ''Tribun du peuple'', edited by [[Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Babeuf|Gracchus Babeuf]], a former priest who advocated an early version of [[socialism]]. On 5 February 1795, the semi-official newspaper ''[[Le Moniteur Universel]]'' (''Le Moniteur'') attacked Marat for encouraging the bloody extremes of the [[Reign of Terror]]. Marat's remains were removed from the Panth\u00e9on two days later.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=375}} The surviving [[Girondin]] deputies, whose leaders had been executed during the Reign of Terror, were brought back into the Convention on 8 March 1795.\n\nThe Convention tried to bring a peaceful end to the Catholic and royalist [[War in the Vend\u00e9e|uprising in the Vend\u00e9e]]. The Convention signed an amnesty agreement, promising to recognize the freedom of religion and allowing territorial guards to keep their weapons if the ''Vend\u00e9ens'' would end their revolt. On a proposal from Boissy d'Anglas, on 21 February 1795 the Convention formally proclaimed the freedom of religion and the separation of church and state.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=375}}\n\n=== Wars (1794\u20131795) ===\nBetween July 1794 and the October 1795 elections for the new-style Parliament, the government tried to obtain international peace treaties and secure French gains. In January 1795 General [[Jean-Charles Pichegru|Pichegru]] took advantage of an extremely cold winter and invaded the [[Netherlands|Dutch Republic]]. He captured [[Utrecht]] on 18 January, and on 14 February units of French cavalry captured the Dutch fleet, which was trapped in the ice at [[Den Helder]]. The Dutch government asked for peace, conceding [[Zeelandic Flanders|Dutch Flanders]], [[Maastricht]] and [[Venlo]] to France. On 9 February, after a French offensive in the Alps, the [[Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke of Tuscany]] signed a treaty with France. Soon afterwards, on 5 April, France signed a peace treaty, the [[Peace of Basel]], with [[Prussia]], where [[Frederick William II of Prussia|King Frederick William II]] was tired of the war; Prussia recognized the French occupation of the western bank of the [[Rhine]]. On 22 July 1795, a peace agreement, the \"Treaty of Basel\", was signed with Spain, where the French army had marched as far as [[Bilbao]]. By the time the Directory was chosen, the coalition against France was reduced to Britain and [[Austria]], which hoped that [[Russian Empire|Russia]] might be brought in on its side.\n\n=== Failed Jacobin coup (May 1795) and rebellion in Brittany (June\u2013July) ===\n{{main|Revolt of 1 Prairial Year III}}\n[[File:Louis Lazare Hoche1.jpg|thumb|General [[Lazare Hoche]] defeated a royalist army that landed in Brittany (July 1795)]]\nOn 20 May 1795 (1 Prairial Year III), the Jacobins attempted to seize power in Paris. Following the model of Danton's seizure of the National Assembly in June, 1792, a mob of [[sans-culottes]] invaded the meeting hall of the Convention at the Tuileries, killed one deputy, and demanded that a new government be formed. This time the army moved swiftly to clear the hall. Several deputies who had taken the side of the invaders were arrested. The uprising continued the following day, as the sans-culottes seized the ''H\u00f4tel de Ville'' as they had done in earlier uprisings, but with little effect; crowds did not move to support them. On the third day, 22 May, the army moved into and occupied the working-class neighborhood of the faubourg Saint-Antoine. The sans-culottes were disarmed and their leaders were arrested. In the following days the surviving members of the Committee of Public Safety, the committee that had been led by Robespierre, were arrested, with the exception of [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]] and two others. Six of the deputies who had participated in the uprising and had been sentenced to death committed suicide before they were taken to the guillotine.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=378}}\n\nOn 23 June 1795, the [[Chouan]]s, royalist and Catholic rebels in [[Brittany]], formed an army of 14,000 men near [[Quiberon]]. With the assistance of the British navy, a force of two thousand royalists was landed at Quiberon. The French army under General [[Hoche]] reacted swiftly, forcing the royalists to take refuge on the peninsula and then to withdraw. They surrendered on 21 July; 748 of the rebels were executed by firing squad.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=379}}\n\n=== Adoption of the new Constitution ===\n[[File:Paul Barras directeur.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Barras]] organized the defense of the government against attacks from the left and right (e.g. October 1795)]]\nThe new [[Constitution of the Year III]] was presented to the Convention and debated between 4 July \u2013 17 August 1795, and was formally adopted on 22 August 1795. It was a long document, with 377 articles, compared with 124 in the first French Constitution of 1793. Even before it took effect, however, the members of the Convention took measures to assure they would still have dominance in the legislature over the government. They required that in the first elections, two hundred and fifty new deputies would be elected, while five hundred members of the old Convention would remain in place until the next elections. A national referendum of eligible voters was then held. The total number of voters was low; of five million eligible voters, 1,057,390 electors approved the Constitution, and 49,978 opposed it. The proposal that two thirds of members of the old Convention should remain in place was approved by a much smaller margin, 205,498 to 108,754. {{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=199}}\n\n=== October 1795 royalist rebellion ===\n{{main|13 Vend\u00e9miaire}}\n[[File:Attaque de la Convention nationale, 1790.jpg|thumb|[Napoleon|Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte's soldiers fire upon insurgents at the [[Saint-Roch, Paris|church of Saint Roch]] (5 October 1795)]]\n[[File:Bonaparte by Giuseppe Longhi.jpg|thumb|Bonaparte as a new general in the [[Army of the Interior]] (1795)]]\nThe new [[Constitution of the Year III]] was officially proclaimed in force on 23 September 1795, but the new Councils had not yet been elected, and the Directors had not yet been chosen. The leaders of the royalists and constitutional monarchists chose this moment to try to seize power. They saw that the vote in favor of the new Constitution was hardly overwhelming. Paris voters were particularly hostile to the idea of keeping two-thirds of the old members of the Convention in the new Councils. A central committee was formed, with members from the wealthier neighborhoods of Paris, and they began planning a march on the center of the city and on the Tuileries, where the Convention still met.\n\nThe members of the Convention, very much experienced with conspiracies, were well aware that the planning was underway. A group of five republican deputies, led by [[Paul Barras]], had already formed an unofficial directory, in anticipation of the creation of the real one. They were concerned about the national guard members from western Paris, and were unsure about the military commander of Paris, [[Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Menou|General Menou]]. Barras decided to turn to military commanders in his entourage who were known republicans, particularly [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]], whom he had known when Bonaparte was successfully  fighting the British in Toulon. Bonaparte, at this point a general of second rank in the Army of the Interior, was ordered to defend the government buildings on the right bank.\n\nThe armed royalist insurgents planned a march in two columns along both the right bank and left bank of the Seine toward the Tuileries. There on October 5, 1795, the royalists were met by the artillery of General [[Joachim Murat]] at the Sablons and by Bonaparte's soldiers and artillery in front of the church of Saint-Roch. The whiff of grapeshot of Bonaparte's cannons and gunfire of his soldiers brutally mowed down advancing columns, killing some four hundred insurgents, and ended the rebellion. Bonaparte was promoted to General of Division on 16 October, and General in Chief of the Army of the Interior on 26 October. It was the last uprising to take place in Paris during the French Revolution.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=202}}\n\n== History ==\n=== Directory takes charge ===\nBetween 12 and 21 October 1795, immediately after the suppression of royalist uprising in Paris, the elections for the new Councils decreed by the new Constitution took place. Three-hundred seventy nine members of the old Convention, for the most part moderate republicans, were elected to the new legislature. To assure that the Directory did not abandon the Revolution entirely, the Council required that all of the members of the Directory be former members of the Convention and [[regicides]], those who had voted for the execution of [[Louis XVI]].\n\nDue to the rules established by the Convention, a majority of members of the new legislature, 381 of 741 deputies, had served in the Convention and were ardent republicans, but a large part of the new deputies elected were royalists, 118 versus 11 from the left. The members of the upper house, the Council of Ancients, were chosen by lot from among all of the deputies.\n\nOn 31 October 1795, the Council of Ancients chose the first Directory from a list of candidates submitted by the Council of Five Hundred. One person elected, the [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s]], refused to take the position, saying it didn't suit his interests or personality.  A new member, [[Lazare Carnot]], was elected in his place.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=204\u2013206}}\n\nThe members elected to the Directory were the following:\n* [[Paul Fran\u00e7ois Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras]], a member of a minor noble family from [[Provence]],  Barras had been a revolutionary envoy to Toulon, where he met the young Bonaparte, and arranged his promotion to captain. Barras had been removed from the [[Committee of Public Safety]] by Robespierre. Fearing for his life, Barras had helped organize the downfall of Robespierre. An expert at political intrigue, Barras became the dominant figure in the Directory. His leading opponent in the Directory,  Carnot, described him as \"without faith and without morals... in politics, without character and without resolution... He has all the tastes of an opulent prince, generous, magnificent and dissipated.\" {{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=564}} \n* [[Louis Marie de La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux]] was a fierce republican and anti-Catholic, who had proposed to execute Louis XVI after the [[flight to Varennes]]. He promoted the establishment of a new religion, [[theophilanthropy]], to replace Christianity.  \n* [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rewbell]] had an expertise in foreign relations, and was a close ally of Paul Barras. He  was a firm moderate republican who had voted for the death of the King but had also opposed Robespierre and the extreme Jacobins. He was an opponent of the Catholic church and a proponent of individual liberties. \n* [[\u00c9tienne-Fran\u00e7ois Le Tourneur]] was a former captain of engineers, and a specialist in military and naval affairs. He was a close ally within the Directory of Carnot. \n* [[Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot]]: when the Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e9s was elected by the Ancients, but refused the position, his place was taken by Carnot. Carnot was an army captain at the beginning of the Revolution, and when elected to the Convention became a member of the commission of military affairs, as well as a vocal opponent of Robespierre. He was an energetic and efficient manager, who restructured the French military and helped it achieve its first successes, earning him the title of \"The Organizer of the Victory.\"  Napoleon, who later made Carnot his Minister of War, described him as \"a hard worker, sincere in everything, but without intrigues, and easy to fool.\"{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=624}}\n\nThe following day, the members of the new government took over their offices in the Luxembourg Palace, which had previously been occupied by the Committee of Public Safety. Nothing had been prepared, and the rooms had no furniture: they managed to find firewood to heat the room, and a table in order to work. Each member took charge of a particular sector: Rewbell diplomacy; Carnot and Le Tourneur military affairs, La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux religion and public instruction, and Barras internal affairs.\n\nThe Council of Ancients was attributed the building at the Tuileries Palace formerly occupied by the Convention, while the Council of Five Hundred deliberated in the ''[[Salle du Man\u00e8ge]]'', the former riding school west of the palace in the [[Tuileries Garden]]. One of the early decisions of the new parliament was to designate uniforms for both houses: the Five Hundred wore long white robes with a blue belt, a scarlet cloak and a hat of blue velour, while members of the Ancients wore a robe of blue-violet, a scarlet sash, a white mantle, and a violet hat.\n{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=206}}\n\n==== Gallery ====\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Paul Barras.jpg|[[Paul Barras]] (here in the ceremonial dress of a Director) was a master of political intrigue\nFile:La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux Directeur.JPG|[[Louis Marie de La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux]]\nFile:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Reubell.JPG|[[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rewbell]]\nFile:\u00c9tienne-Fran\u00e7ois Le Tourneur - Directeur.jpg|[[\u00c9tienne-Fran\u00e7ois Le Tourneur]]\nFile:Portrait Lazare Carnot.jpg|[[Lazare Carnot]], a brilliant organizer and mathematician but poor intriguer, was the enemy of Barras\n</gallery>\n\n=== Finance and economy ===\nThe new Director overseeing financial affairs, La R\u00e9veilli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux, gave a succinct description of the financial state of France when the Directory took power: \"The national Treasury was completely empty; not a single sou remained. The [[assignats]] were almost worthless; the little value which remained drained away each day with accelerated speed. One could not print enough money in one night to meet the most pressing needs of the next day.... The public revenues were nonexistent; citizens had lost the habit of paying taxes. [...] All public credit was dead and all confidence lost. [...] The depreciation of the ''assignats'', the frightening speed of the fall, reduced the salary of all public employees and functionaries to a value which was purely nominal.\"{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=209\u2013210}}\n\nThe drop in value in the money was accompanied by extraordinary inflation. The ''[[Louis d'or]]'' (gold coin), which was worth 2000 [[Livre tournois|''livres'']] in paper money at the beginning of the Directory, increased to 3000 and then 5000 ''livres''. The price of a liter of wine increased from 50 sous in October 1795 to ten francs and then thirty francs. A measure of flour worth two ''livres'' in 1790 was worth 225 ''livres'' in October 1794.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=209\u2013210}}\n\nThe new government continued to print ''assignats'', which were based on the value of property confiscated from the Church and the aristocracy, but it could not print them fast enough; even when it printed one hundred million in a day, it covered only one-third of the government's needs. To fill the treasury, the Directory resorted in December 1795 to a forced loan of 600 million ''livres'' from wealthy citizens, who were required to pay between 50 and 6000 ''livres'' each.\n\nTo fight inflation, the government began minting more coins of gold and silver, which had real value;  the government had little gold but large silver reserves, largely in the form of silverware, candlesticks and other objects confiscated from the churches and the nobility. It minted 72 million [[\u00e9cus]], and when this silver supply ran low, it obtained much more gold and silver through military campaigns outside of France, particularly from Bonaparte's [[Army of Italy (France)|army in Italy]]. Bonaparte demanded gold or silver from each city he conquered, threatening to destroy the cities if they did not pay.\n\nThese measures reduced the rate of inflation. On 19 February 1796, the government held a ceremony in the [[Place Vend\u00f4me]] to destroy the printing presses which had been used to produce huge quantities of ''assignats''. This success produced a new problem: the country was still flooded with more than two billion four hundred million (2.400.000.000) ''assignats'', claims on confiscated properties, which now had some value. Those who held ''assignats'' were able to exchange them for state mandates, which they could use to buy ch\u00e2teaux, church buildings and other [[biens nationaux]] (state property) at extremely reduced prices. Speculation became rampant, and property in Paris and other cities could change hands several times a day.\n\nAnother major problem faced by the Directory was the enormous public debt, the same problem that had led to the Revolution in the first place. In September\u2013December 1797, the Directory attacked this problem by declaring bankruptcy on two-thirds of the debt, but assured payment on the other third. This resulted in the ruin of those who held large quantities of government bonds, but stabilized the currency. To keep the treasury full, the Directory also imposed new taxes on property owners, based on the number of fireplaces and chimneys, and later on the number of windows, of their residences. It refrained from adding more taxes on wine and salt, which had helped cause the 1789 revolution, but added new taxes on gold and silver objects, playing cards, tobacco, and other luxury products. Through these means, the Directory brought about a relative stability of finances which continued through the Directory and Consulate. {{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=209\u2013213}}\n\n=== Food supply ===\nThe food supply for the population, and particularly for the Parisians, was a major economic and political problem before and during the Revolution; it had led to food riots in Paris and attacks on the [[National Convention|Convention]]. To assure the supply of food to the [[sans-culottes]] in Paris, the base of support of the [[Jacobins]], the Convention had strictly regulated grain distribution and set maximum prices for bread and other essential products. As the value of the currency dropped, the fixed prices soon did not cover the cost of production, and supplies dropped. The Convention was forced to abolish the [[General maximum|maximum]] on 24 December 1794, but it continued to buy huge quantities of bread and meat which it distributed at low prices to the Parisians. This Paris food distribution cost a large part of the national budget, and was resented by the rest of the country, which did not have that benefit. By early 1796, the grain supply was supplemented by deliveries from [[Italy]] and even from [[Algeria]]. Despite the increased imports, the grain supply to Paris was not enough. The Ministry of the Interior reported on 23 March 1796 that there was only enough wheat to make bread for five days, and there were shortages of meat and firewood. The Directory was forced to resume deliveries of subsidized food to the very poor, the elderly, the sick, and government employees. The food shortages and high prices were one factor in the growth of discontent and the [[Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Babeuf|Gracchus Babeuf]]'s uprising, the [[Conspiracy of the Equals]], in 1796. The harvests were good in the following years and the food supplies improved considerably, but the supply was still precarious in the north, the west, the southeast, and the valley of the Seine.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=209}}\n\n=== Babeuf's Conspiracy of the Equals ===\n{{main|Conspiracy of the Equals}}\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Babeuf.jpg|thumb|[[Fran\u00e7ois No\u00ebl Babeuf]], engraving by Fran\u00e7ois Bonneville, 1794 (BNF, D\u00e9partement des Estampes)]]\n[[File:Attaque camp de Grenelle.jpeg|thumb|Attack by the followers of Babeuf on the army camp of Grenelle on 9 and 10 September 1796. Drawing by [[Abraham Girardet]], engraving by Pierre-Gabriel Berthault, 1802. (BNF, D\u00e9partement des Estampes)]]\nIn 1795, the Directory faced a new threat from the left, from the followers of [[Fran\u00e7ois No\u00ebl Babeuf]], a talented political agitator who took the name ''Gracchus'' and was the organizer of what became known as the [[Conspiracy of the Equals]]. Babeuf had, since 1789, been drawn to the Agrarian Law, an agrarian reform preconized by the ancient Roman brothers, [[Gracchi|Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus]], of sharing [[Common ownership|goods in common]], as means of achieving economic equality. By the time of the [[Fall of Maximilien Robespierre|fall of Robespierre]], he had abandoned this as an impractical scheme and was moving towards a more complex plan.<ref>John Hall Stewart, ''A Documentary Survey of the French Revolution'' (1951) pp 654\u201357</ref> Babeuf did not call for the abolition of private property, and wrote that peasants should own their own plots of land, but he advocated that all wealth should be shared equally: all citizens who were able would be required to work, and all would receive the same income. Babeuf did not believe that the mass of French citizens was ready for self-government; accordingly, he proposed a dictatorship under his leadership until the people were educated enough to take charge. \"People!\", Babeuf wrote. \"Breathe, see, recognize your guide, your defender.... Your tribune presents himself with confidence.\" {{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|p=|pages=189}}\n\nAt first, Babeuf's following was small; the readers of his newspaper, ''Le Tribun du peuple'' (\"The Tribune of the People\"), were mostly middle-class far-left Jacobins who had been excluded from the new government. However, his popularity increased in the working-class of the capital with the drop in value of the ''assignats'', which rapidly resulted in the decrease of wages and the rise of food prices. Beginning in October 1795, he allied himself with the most radical Jacobins, and on 29 March 1796 formed the ''Directoire secret des \u00c9gaux'' (\"Secret Directory of Equals\"), which proposed to \"revolutionize the people\" through pamphlets and placards, and eventually to overthrow the government. He formed an alliance of utopian socialists and radical Jacobins, including [[F\u00e9lix Lepeletier]], [[Pierre-Antoine Antonelle]], [[Sylvain Marechal]], [[Jean-Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Amar]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Robert Lindet]]. The [[Conspiracy of Equals]] was organized in a novel way: in the center was Babeuf and the Secret Directory, who hid their identities, and shared information with other members of the Conspiracy only via trusted intermediaries. This conspiratorial structure was later adopted by Marxist movements. Despite his precautions, the Directory infiltrated an agent into the conspiracy, and was fully informed of what he was doing.<ref>R. B. Rose, ''Gracchus Babeuf: The First Revolutionary Communist'' (Stanford University Press, 1978)</ref> Bonaparte, the newly named commander of the [[Army of the Interior]], was ordered to close the [[Panth\u00e9on Club]], the major meeting place for the Jacobins in Paris, which he did on 27 February 1796. The Directory took other measures to prevent an uprising; the Legion of Police (''l\u00e9gion de police''), a local police force dominated by Jacobins, was forced to become a part of the Army, and the Army organized a mobile column to patrol the neighborhoods and stop uprisings.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=192\u2013194}}\n\nBefore Babeuf and his conspiracy could strike, he was betrayed by a police spy and arrested in his hiding place on 10 May 1796. Though he was a talented agitator, he was a very poor conspirator; with him in his hiding place were the complete records of the conspiracy, with all of the names of the conspirators. Despite this setback, the conspiracy went ahead with its plans. On the night of 9\u201310 September 1796, between 400 and 700 Jacobins went to the 21st Regiment of Dragoons (''21e r\u00e9giment de dragons'') army camp at [[Grenelle]] and tried to incite an armed rebellion against the Convention. At the same time a column of militants was formed in the working-class neighborhoods of Paris to march on the Luxembourg Palace, headquarters of the Directory. Director Carnot had been informed the night before by the commander of the camp, and a unit of dragoons was ready. When the attack began at about ten o'clock, the dragoons appeared suddenly and charged. About twenty Jacobins were killed, and the others arrested. The column of militants, learning what had happened, disbanded in confusion. The widespread arrest of Babeuf's militants and Jacobins followed. The practice of arresting suspects at their homes at night, stopped after the downfall of Robespierre, was resumed on this occasion.\n\nDespite his arrest, Babeuf, in jail, still felt he could negotiate with the government. He wrote to the Directory: \"Citizen Directors, why don't you look above yourselves and treat with me as with an equal power? You have seen now the vast confidence of which I am the center... this view makes you tremble.\"{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|page=199}} Several attempts were made by Babeuf's followers to free him from prison. He was finally moved to [[Vend\u00f4me]] for trial. The Directory did not tremble. The accused Jacobins were tried by military courts between 19 September and 27 October. Thirty Jacobins, including three former deputies of the Convention, were convicted and guillotined. Babeuf and his principal followers were tried in Vend\u00f4me between 20 February and 26 May 1797. The two principal leaders, Babeuf and [[Augustin Alexandre Darth\u00e9|Darth\u00e9]], were convicted. They both attempted suicide, but failed and were guillotined on 27 May 1797. However, in the following months, the Directory and Councils gradually turned away from the royalist right and tried to find new allies on the left.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|page=199}}<ref>Doyle, ''Oxford History,''pp 324\u201326</ref><ref>George Rude, ''The French Revolution: Its Causes, Its History and Its Legacy After 200 Years'' (1991) p 122</ref>\n\n=== War and Diplomacy (1796\u20131797) ===\nThe major preoccupation of the Directory during its existence was the war against the coalition of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Austria]]. The military objective set by the Convention in October 1795 was to enlarge France to what were declared its natural limits: the [[Pyrenees]], the [[Rhine]] and the [[Alps]], the borders of [[Gaul]] at the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. In 1795, [[Prussia]], [[Spain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] quit [[the War of the First Coalition]] and the war and made peace with France, but Great Britain refused to accept the French annexation of [[Belgium]]. Beside Britain and Austria, the only enemies remaining for France were the kingdom of [[Sardinia]] and several small Italian states. Austria proposed a European congress to settle borders, but the Directory refused, demanding direct negotiations with Austria instead. Under British pressure, Austria agreed to continue the war against France.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=223}}\n\n[[Lazare Carnot]], the Director who oversaw military affairs, planned a new campaign against Austria, using three armies: General [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan's]] [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]] on the Rhine and General [[Jean Victor Moreau|Moreau]]'s [[Army of the Rhine and Moselle]] on the Danube would march to [[Vienna]] and dictate a peace. A third army, the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]] under General Bonaparte, who had risen in rank with spectacular speed due to his defense of the government from a royalist uprising, would carry out a diversionary operation against Austria in northern Italy. Jourdan's army captured [[Mayence]] and [[Frankfurt]], but on 14 August 1796 was defeated by the Austrians at the [[Battle of Amberg]] and again on 3 September 1796 at the [[Battle of W\u00fcrzburg]], and had to retreat back to the Rhine. General Moreau, without the support of Jourdan, was also forced to retreat.\n\n==== Italian campaign ====\n[[File:La Bataille du Pont d'Arcole.jpg|thumb|Bonaparte won his first major victory leading his soldiers across a bridge at the [[Battle of Arcole]] (17 November 1796)]]\n[[File:Napoleon at the Battle of Rivoli.jpg|thumb|Bonaparte defeats the Austrians at the [[Battle of Rivoli]] (14 January 1797)]]\n[[File:Irish-Invasion-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|A British cartoon showed the failure of the French military expedition to Ireland dispersed by storms at sea in 1797]]\nThe story was much different in Italy. Bonaparte, though he was only twenty-eight years old, was named commander of the Army of Italy on 2 March 1796, through the influence of Barras, his patron in the Directory. Bonaparte faced the combined armies of Austria and Sardinia, which numbered seventy thousand men. Bonaparte slipped his army between them and defeated them in a series of battles, culminating at the [[Battle of Mondovi]] where he defeated the Sardinians on 22 April 1796, and the [[Battle of Lodi]], where he defeated the Austrians on 10 May. The [[Victor Amadeus III of Savoy|king of Sardinia and Savoy]] was forced to make peace in May 1796 and ceded [[Nice]] and [[Savoy]] to France.\n\nAt the end of 1796, Austria sent two new armies to Italy to expel Bonaparte, but Bonaparte outmaneuvered them both, winning a first victory at the [[Battle of Arcole]] on 17 November 1796, then at the [[Battle of Rivoli]] on 14 January 1797. He forced Austria to sign the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] (October 1797), whereby [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|the emperor]] ceded [[Lombardy]] and the [[Austrian Netherlands]] to the French Republic in exchange for [[Venice]] and urged [[Diet of the Holy Roman Empire|the Diet]] to surrender the lands beyond the Rhine.<ref name=Black173>Black, p. 173.</ref>\n\n==== Spanish alliance ====\nThe Directory was eager to form a coalition with Spain to block British commerce with the continent and to close the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to British ships. By the [[Second Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]], concluded in August 1796, Spain became the ally of France, and on 5 October, it declared war on Britain. The British fleet under Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Jervis]] defeated the Spanish fleet at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1797)|Cape St Vincent]], keeping the Mediterranean open to British ships, but the United Kingdom was brought into such extreme peril by the mutinies in its fleet that it offered to acknowledge the French conquest of the Netherlands and to restore the French colonies.\n\n==== Irish Misadventure ====\nThe Directory also sought a new way to strike British interests and to repay the 1707-1800 [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] for the support it gave to royalist insurgents in [[Brittany]], [[France]]. A French fleet of 44 vessels departed [[Brest, France|Brest]] on 15 December 1796, carrying an expeditionary force of 14,000 soldiers, led by General Hoche to [[Ireland]], where they hoped to join forces with Irish rebels to expel the British from the 1542-1800 [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. However, the fleet was separated by storms off the Irish coast and, being unable to land on Ireland, had to return to home port with 31 vessels and 12,000 surviving soldiers.\n\n=== Rise of the royalists and coup d'\u00e8tat (1797) ===\n{{main|Coup of 18 Fructidor}}\nThe first elections held after the formation of the Directory were held in March and April 1797, in order to replace one-third of the members of the Councils. The elections were a crushing defeat for the old members of the Convention; 205 of the 216 were defeated. Only eleven former deputies from the Convention were reelected, several of whom were royalists.{{sfn|Soboul|1975|p=505}} The elections were a triumph for the royalists, particularly in the south and in the west; after the elections there were about 160 royalist deputies, divided between those who favored a return to an absolute monarchy, and those who wished a constitutional monarchy on the British model. The constitutional monarchists elected to the Council included [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours]], who later emigrated to the United States with his family, and whose son, [[\u00c9leuth\u00e8re Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e du Pont]], founded the \"E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company\", now known as [[DuPont]]. In Paris and other large cities, the candidates of the left dominated. General [[Jean-Charles Pichegru]], a former Jacobin and ordinary soldier who had become one of the most successful generals of the Revolution, was elected president of the new Council of Five Hundred. [[Fran\u00e7ois Barb\u00e9-Marbois]], a diplomat and future negotiator of the sale of [[Louisiana]] to the United States, was elected president of the Council of Ancients.\n\n[[File:Pichegru.jpg|thumb|left|General [[Jean-Charles Pichegru]], president of the Council of Five Hundred, was accused of being a secret royalist]]\nRoyalism was not strictly legal, and deputies could not announce themselves as such, but royalist newspapers and pamphlets soon appeared, there were pro-monarchy demonstrations in theaters, and royalists wore identifying clothing items, such as black velvet collars, in show of mourning for the execution of Louis XVI. The parliamentary royalists demanded changes in the government fiscal policies, and a more tolerant position toward religion. During the Convention, churches had been closed and priests required to take an [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|oath to the government]]. Priests who had refused to take the oath were expelled from the country, on pain of the death penalty if they returned. Under the Directory, many priests had quietly returned, and many churches around the country had re-opened and were discreetly holding services. When the Directory proposed moving the ashes of the celebrated mathematician and philosopher [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] to the ''[[Panth\u00e9on]]'', one deputy, [[Louis-S\u00e9bastien Mercier]], a former [[Girondin]] and opponent of the Jacobins, protested that the ideas of Descartes had inspired the [[Reign of Terror]] of the Revolution and destroyed religion in France. Descartes' ashes were not moved.{{Sfn|Lefebre|1977|page=212}} ''\u00c9migr\u00e9s'' who had left during the Revolution had been threatened by the Convention with the death penalty if they returned; now, under the Directory, they quietly began to return.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=181}}\n\n[[File:Charles Pierre Francois Augereau.jpg|thumb|General [[Pierre Augereau]], a close ally of Bonaparte, led the army that arrested the royalist leaders of the legislature (4 September 1797)]]\n[[File:Augereau Coup d etat 18 Fructidor in Tuileries.jpg|thumb|The army arrests General Pichegru at the Tuileries Palace (4 September 1797)]]\nParallel with the parliamentary royalists, but not directly connected with them, a clandestine network of royalists existed, whose objective was to place [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], then in exile in [[Germany]], on the French throne. They were funded largely by Britain, through the offices of [[William Wickham (1761\u20131840)|William Wickham]], the British spymaster who had his headquarters in [[Switzerland]]. These networks were too divided and too closely watched by the police to have much effect on politics. However, Wickham did make one contact that proved to have a decisive effect on French politics: through an intermediary, he had held negotiations with General Pichegru, then commander of the Army of the Rhine.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=217}}\n\nThe Directory itself was divided. [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]], [[Letourneur]] and [[Louis Marie de La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux|La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re L\u00e9peaux]] were not royalists, but favored a more moderate government, more tolerant of religion. Though Carnot himself had been a member of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] led by Robespierre, he declared that the Jacobins were ungovernable, that the Revolution could not go on forever, and that it was time to end it. A new member, [[Fran\u00e7ois-Marie, marquis de Barth\u00e9lemy]], a diplomat, had joined the Directory; he was allied with Carnot. The royalists in the Councils immediately began to demand more power over the government and particularly over the finances, threatening the position of Barras.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=218\u2013219}}\n\nBarras, the consummate intriguer, won La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re L\u00e9peaux over to his side, and began planning the downfall of the royalists. From letters taken from a captured royalist agent, he was aware of the contacts that General Pichegru made with the British and that he had been in contact with the exiled Louis XVIII. He presented this information to Carnot, and Carnot agreed to support his action against the Councils. General [[Lazare Hoche|Hoche]], the new Minister of War, was directed to march the [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]] through Paris on its way to Brest, on the pretext that they would be embarked for a new expedition to Ireland. Hoche himself resigned as Minister of War on 22 July. General [[Pierre Augereau]], a close subordinate and ally of Bonaparte, and his troops arrived in Paris on 7 August, though it was a violation of the Constitution for soldiers to be within twelve leagues of the city without permission of the Councils. The royalist members of the Councils protested, but could do nothing to send them away.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=392}}\n\nOn 4 September 1797, with the army in place, the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor|''Coup d'\u00e9tat'' of 18 Fructidor, Year V]] was set in motion. General Augereau's soldiers arrested Pichegru, Barth\u00e9lemy, and the leading royalist deputies of the Councils. The next day, the Directory annulled the elections of about two hundred deputies in 53 departments.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=393}} Sixty-five deputies were deported to [[Guiana]], 42 royalist newspapers were closed, and 65 journalists and editors were deported. Carnot and Barth\u00e9lemy were removed from the Directory. Carnot went into exile in Switzerland; he later returned and became, for a time, Bonaparte's minister of war. [[Fran\u00e7ois-Marie, marquis de Barth\u00e9lemy|Barth\u00e9lemy]] and Pichegru both were sent to exile in [[French Guiana]] (penal colony of Cayenne). In June 1798, they both escaped, and went first to the United States and then to England. During the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], Pichegru returned secretly to Paris, where he was captured on 28 February 1804. He died in prison on 6 April 1804, either strangled or having committed suicide.\n\n=== Second Directory and resurgence of the Jacobins ===\nThe coup was followed by a scattering of uprisings by royalists in [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[Tarascon]] and other towns, particularly in the southwest and west. A commissioner of the Directory was assassinated in [[Lyon]], and on 22 October counter-revolutionaries seized the city government of [[Carpentras]] for twenty-four hours. These brief uprisings served only to justify a wave of repression from the new government.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=439\u2013440}}\n\nWith Carnot and Barth\u00e9lemy gone from the Directory, and the royalists expelled from the Councils, the Jacobins were once again in control of the government. The two vacant places in the Directory were filled by [[Philippe Antoine, comte Merlin|Merlin de Douai]], a lawyer who had helped write the [[Law of Suspects]] during the Reign of Terror; and [[Fran\u00e7ois de Neufch\u00e2teau]], a poet and expert in industry inland navigation, who served only a few months. Eight of the twelve Directors and ministers of the new government were regicides, who as deputies of the Convention had voted for the execution of Louis XVI, and were now determined to continue the Revolution.<ref>Albert Soboul, ''The French Revolution'' (1975) p 508</ref> {{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=1030}}\n\nThe central administration and city governments were quickly purged of suspected royalists. The next target was the wave of noble ''\u00e9migr\u00e9s'' and priests who had begun to return to France. The Jacobins in the Councils demanded that the law of 1793 be enforced; ''\u00e9migr\u00e9s'' were ordered to leave France within fifteen days. If they did not, they were to be judged by a military commission, and, on simple proof of their identity, were to be executed within twenty-four hours. Military commissions were established throughout the country to judge not only returning ''\u00e9migr\u00e9s'', but also rebels and conspirators. Between 4 September 1797 and the end of the Directory in 1799, 160 persons were condemned to death by the military tribunals, including 41 priests and several women. {{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=441\u2013442}}\n\nOn 16 October 1797, the Council of Five Hundred considered a new law which banned political activities by nobles, who were to be considered as foreigners, and had to apply for naturalization in order to take part in politics. A certain number, listed by names, were to be banned permanently from political activity, were to have their property confiscated, and were to be required to leave immediately. The law called for certain exemptions for those in the government and military (Director Barras and General Bonaparte were both from minor noble families). In the end, resistance to the law was so great that it was not adopted.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=452\u2013453}}\n\nThe Jacobin-dominated councils also demanded the deportation of priests who refused to take an oath to the government, and an oath declaring their hatred of royalty and anarchy. 267 priests were deported to the French penal colony of Cayenne in French Guiana, of whom 111 survived and returned to France. 920 were sent to a prison colony on the [[\u00cele de R\u00e9]], and 120, a large part of them Belgians, to another colony on the [[Ol\u00e9ron|\u00cele d'Ol\u00e9ron]].{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|page 445}}  <ref>See: ''Seuls les morts ne reviennent jamais : les pionniers de la guillotine s\u00e8che en Guyane fran\u00e7aise'', Philippe de Ladebat, ed. Amalth\u00e9e, France, 2008 \u2013 http://site.voila.fr/fructidor/page1.html</ref> The new government continued the anti-religious policy of the Convention. Several churches, including the cathedral [[Notre Dame de Paris]] and the church of [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]], were converted [[Theophilanthropic]] temples, a new religion based on the belief in the existence of God and the immortality of the human spirit. Religious observations were forbidden on Sunday; they were allowed only on the last day of the 10-day week (''d\u00e9cade'') of the [[French Republican Calendar]].{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=231}} Other churches remained closed, and were forbidden to ring their bells, although many religious services took place in secret in private homes. The National Guard was mobilized  to search rural areas and forests for priests and nobles in hiding. As during the Reign of Terror, lists were prepared of suspects, who would be arrested in the event of attempted uprisings. {{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=441\u2013442}}\n\nThe new Jacobin-dominated Directory and government also targeted the press. Newspaper publishers were required to submit copies of their publications to the police for official approval. On 17 December 1797, seventeen Paris newspapers were closed by order of the Directory. The Directory also imposed a substantial tax on all newspapers or magazines distributed by mail, although Jacobin publications, as well as scientific and art publications, were excluded. Books critical of the Jacobins were censored; [[Louis-Marie Prudhomme]]'s six-volume ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et impartiale des erreurs, des fautes et des crimes commis pendant la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise''<ref>''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et impartiale des erreurs, des fautes et des crimes commis pendant la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', Faubourg Saint-Germain, Paris, 1797, (Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France)[http://gallica.bnf.fr/services/engine/search/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&version=1.2&collapsing=disabled&query=%28gallica%20all%20%22Histoire%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20et%20impartiale%20des%20erreurs%2C%20des%20fautes%20et%20des%20crimes%20commis%20pendant%20la%20R%C3%A9volution%20fran%C3%A7aise%22%29%20and%20dc.relation%20all%20%22cb37250832j%22]</ref> (\"General and impartial history of the errors, faults and crimes committed during the French Revolution\") was seized by the police. The Directory also authorized the opening and reading of letters coming from outside of France.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|page=452}}\n  \nDespite all these security measures, there was a great increase in brigandage and robbery in the French countryside; travelers were frequently stopped on roads and robbed; the robberies were often blamed on royalist bands. On 18 January 1798, the Councils passed a new law against highwaymen and bandits, calling for them to be tried by military tribunals, and authorizing the death penalty for robbery or attempted robbery on the roads of France.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=449\u201350}}\n\nThe political repression and terror under the Directory were real, but they were on a much smaller scale than the Reign of Terror under Robespierre and the Convention, and the numbers of those repressed declined during the course of the Directory. After 1798, no further political prisoners were sent to French Guiana, and, in the final year of the Directory, only one person was executed for a political offense.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|page=455}}\n\n=== Elections of 1798 ===\nIn the spring of 1798, not only a new third of the legislature had to be chosen, but the places of the members expelled by the revolution of {{lang|fr|Fructidor}} had to be filled. 437 seats were open, out of 750. The elections took place between 9 and 18 April. The royalists had been disqualified, and the moderates were in disarray, while  the radical Jacobins made a strong showing. Before the new deputies could take their seats, Barras and the other Directors, more moderate than the new Jacobins, organized a commission to review the elections, and disqualified many of the more extreme Jacobin candidates, replacing them with moderates. They sent the list of candidates for Director to the Councils, excluding any radicals. Fran\u00e7ois de Neufch\u00e5teau was chosen by a drawing of lots to leave the Directory and Barras proposed only moderate Jacobins to replace him: the choice fell on [[Jean-Baptiste Treilhard]], a lawyer. These political maneuvers secured the power of the Directory, but widened further the gap between the moderate Directory and the radical Jacobin majority in the Councils.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=232\u2013233}}\n\n=== War and diplomacy (1798) ===\nOn 17 October 1797, General Bonaparte and the Austrians signed the [[Treaty of Campoformio]]. It was a triumph for France. France received the left bank of the [[Rhine]] as far south of [[Cologne]], [[History of Belgium|Belgium]], and the islands in the [[Ionian Sea]] that had belonged to [[Venice]]. Austria in compensation was given the territories of Venice up to the [[Aegean Sea]]. In late November and December, he took part in negotiations with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and Austria, at the [[Second Congress of Rastatt]], to redraw the borders of Germany. He was then summoned back to Paris to take charge of an even more ambitious project, the invasion of Britain, which had been proposed by Director Carnot and General Hoche. But an eight-day inspection of the ports where the invasion fleet was being prepared convinced Bonaparte that the invasion had little chance of success: the ships were in poor condition, the crews poorly trained, and funds and logistics were lacking. He privately told his associate [[Marmont]] his view of the Directory: \"Nothing can be done with these people. They don't understand anything of greatness. We need to go back to our projects for the East. It is only there that great results can be achieved.\"{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=243\u2013244}} The invasion of England was cancelled, and a less ambitious plan to support an Irish uprising was proposed instead (see below).\n\n==== Sister Republics ====\n{{main|Sister republic}}\nThe grand plan of the Directory in 1798, with the assistance of its armies, was the creation of \"Sister Republics\" in Europe which would share the same revolutionary values and same goals, and would be natural allies of France. In the [[Dutch Republic]] (Republic of the Seven United Netherlands), the French army installed the [[Batavian Republic]] with the same system of a Directory and two elected Councils. In [[Milan]], the [[Cisalpine Republic]] was created, which was governed jointly by a Directory and Councils and by the French army. General [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier|Berthier]], who had replaced Bonaparte as the commander of the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]], imitated the actions of the Directory in Paris, purging the new republic's legislature of members whom he considered too radical. The [[Ligurian Republic]] was formed in [[Genoa]]. [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] was also turned by the French army into a sister republic, the [[Piedmontese Republic]]. In [[Turin]], King [[Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia|Charles-Emmanuel IV]], (whose wife, [[Marie Clotilde of France|Clotilde]] was [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s youngest sister), fled French dominance and sailed, protected by the British fleet, to [[Sardinia]]. In [[Savoy]], General [[Barth\u00e9lemy Catherine Joubert|Joubert]] did not bother to form a sister republic, he simply made the province a department of France.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=251\u2013253}}\n\nThe Directory also directly attacked the authority of [[Pope Pius VI]], who governed [[Rome]] and the [[Papal States]] surrounding it. Shortly after Christmas on 28 December 1797, anti-French riots took place in Rome, and a French Army brigadier general, [[Mathurin-L\u00e9onard Duphot|Duphot]], was assassinated. Pope Pius VI moved quickly and formally apologized to the Directory on 29 December 1797, but the Directory refused his apology. Instead, Berthier's troops entered Rome and occupied the city on 10 February 1798. Thus the [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] was also proclaimed on 10 February 1798. Pius VI was arrested and confined in the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] before being taken to France in 1799. The Vatican treasury of thirty million francs was sent to Paris, where it helped finance Bonaparte's expedition to Egypt, and five hundred cases of paintings, statues, and other art objects were sent to France and added to the collections of the [[Louvre]].{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=252}}\n\nA French army under General [[Guillaume Brune]] occupied much of Switzerland. The [[Helvetian Republic]] was proclaimed on 12 April 1798. On 26 August 1798, [[Geneva]] was detached from the new republic and made part of France. The treasury of [[Bern]] was seized, and, like the treasury of the Vatican, was used to finance Bonaparte's [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|expedition to Egypt]].\n\nThe new military campaigns required thousands of additional soldiers. The Directory approved the first permanent law of [[conscription]], which was unpopular in the countryside, and particularly in Belgium, which had formally become part of France. Riots and peasant uprisings took place in the Belgian countryside. Blaming the unrest on Belgian priests, French authorities ordered the arrest and deportation of several thousands of them.<ref>Thys, Augustin, ''La pers\u00e9cution religieuse en Belgique sous le Directoire ex\u00e9cutif, 1798\u201399'', d'apr\u00e8s des documents in\u00e9dits, Anvers, 1898, [https://archive.org/stream/laperscutionre00thys#page/n6/mode/1up] (in French)</ref>\n\n==== Bonaparte's expedition to Egypt (May 1798) ====\n{{main|French campaign in Egypt and Syria}}\nThe idea of a French military expedition to Egypt had been proposed by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]] in a memoir to the [[Institut de France|French Institute]] as early as 3 July 1797, and in a letter the following month from Talleyrand to Bonaparte. The Egyptian expedition had three objectives: to cut the shortest route from England to [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]] by occupying he [[Isthmus of Suez]]; to found a colony which could produce cotton and sugar cane, which were in short supply in France due to the British blockade; and to provide a base for a future French attack on British India. It also had several personal advantages for Bonaparte: it allowed him to keep a distance from the unpopular Directory, while at the same time staying in the public eye.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=245}}\n\n[[File:The Battle of the Nile.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Destruction of 'L'Orient' at the Battle of the Nile, 1 August 1798'', oil on canvas by George Arnald (1825-1827). Defeat at the Battle of the Nile left Bonaparte and his army stranded in Egypt. [[National Maritime Museum]], [[Greenwich]], [[England]]]]\nThe Directory itself was not enthusiastic about the idea, which would take its most successful general and his army far from Europe just at the time that a major new war was brewing. Director La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux wrote: \"The idea never came from the Directory or any of its members. The ambition and pride of Bonaparte could no longer support the idea of not being visible, and of being under the orders of the Directory.\"\n\nThe idea presented two other problems: Republican French policy was opposed to colonization, and France was not at war with the Ottoman Empire, to which Egypt belonged. Therefore, the expedition was given an additional scientific purpose: \"to enlighten the world and to obtain new treasures for science.\" A large team of prominent scientists was added to the expedition; twenty-one mathematicians, three astronomers, four architects, thirteen naturalists and an equal number of geographers, plus painters, a pianist and the poet [[Fran\u00e7ois-Auguste Parseval-Grandmaison]]{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=245-246}}\n\nOn 19 May 1798, two hundred ships carrying Bonaparte, and 35,000 men comprising the [[Order of battle of the Arm\u00e9e d'Orient (1798)|''Arm\u00e9e d'Orient'']], most of them veterans of Bonaparte's Army of Italy, sailed from [[Toulon]]. The British fleet under [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]], expecting a French expedition toward [[Constantinople]], was not in position to stop them. The French fleet stopped briefly at [[Malta]], capturing the island, the government of which offered little resistance. Bonaparte's army landed in the bay of [[Alexandria]] on 1 July, and captured that city on 2 July, with little opposition. He wrote a letter to the Pascha of Egypt, claiming that his purpose was to liberate Egypt from the tyranny of the [[Mamluk]]s. His army marched across the desert, despite extreme heat, and defeated the Mameluks at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]] on 21 July 1798. A few days later, however, on 1 August, the British fleet under Admiral Nelson arrived off the coast; the French fleet was taken by surprise and destroyed in the [[Battle of the Nile]]. Only four French ships escaped. Bonaparte and his army were prisoners in Egypt. .{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=246\u2013247}}\n\n==== Failed uprising in Ireland (August 1798) ====\n{{main|Irish Rebellion of 1798}}\nAnother attempt to support an Irish uprising was made on 7 August 1798. A French fleet sailed from [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort-sur-Mer]] (Rochefort) carrying an expeditionary force led by General [[Jean Joseph Amable Humbert]]. The attack was intended to support an [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|uprising]] of [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] led by [[Wolfe Tone]]. Tone had several meetings with Bonaparte in France to coordinate the timing, but the uprising within the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] began early and was suppressed on 14 July 1798 before the French fleet arrived. The French force landed at [[Killala]], in northwest Ireland, on 22 August. It defeated British troops in two small engagements on 24 and 27 August, and Humbert declared the formation of an Irish Republic at [[Castlebar]] on 27 August, but the French forces were defeated at the [[Battle of Ballinamuck]] on 8 September 1798 by the troops of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], [[Commander-in-Chief, Ireland|British Commander-in-chief in Ireland]]. A second part of the French expeditionary force, not knowing that the first had surrendered, left Brest on 16 September. It was intercepted by the British Navy in the bay of [[Donegal (town)|Donegal]], and six of the French warships were captured.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=398\u2013400}}\n\n==== Quasi-War with the United States (1798\u20131799) ====\n{{main|Quasi-War}}\nTensions between the United States and France developed into the [[Quasi-War]], an undeclared naval war. France complained the United States was ignoring the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|1778 Treaty of Alliance]] that had brought the French into the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The United States insisted on taking a neutral stance in the war between France and Britain. After the [[Jay Treaty]] with Britain went into effect in 1795, France began to side against the United States and by 1797 had seized over 300 American merchant ships. [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] favored Britain while [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republicans]] favored France. Federalist President [[John Adams]] built up the [[History of the United States Navy|United States Navy]], finishing three frigates, approving funds to build three more and sending diplomats to Paris to negotiate. They were insulted by Foreign Minister Talleyrand (who demanded bribes before talking). The [[XYZ Affair]] told Americans about the negotiations and angered American public opinion. The war was fought almost entirely at sea, mostly between privateers and merchant ships. In 1800, the [[Convention of 1800]] (Treaty of Mortefontaine) ended the conflict.<ref>De Conde, Alexander, ''The quasi-war: the politics and diplomacy of the undeclared war with France 1797\u20131801'', Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1966</ref>\n\n=== War and political crisis (1799) ===\n==== Second Coalition against France ====\n{{main|War of the Second Coalition}}\n[[File:Suvorovs Battle By Adda.jpg|thumb|[[Suvorov]] and a Russian-Austrian army defeat the French at the [[Battle of Cassano (1799)|Battle of Cassano]] on 27 April 1799 by [[Luigi Schiavonetti]]]]\nBritain and Austria had been alarmed by the French creation of Sister Republics. Austria first demanded that France hand over a share of the territory of the new Republics to it. When the Directory refused, Austria began searching for partners for a new military alliance against France. The new Czar of Russia, [[Paul I of Russia]], was extremely hostile to French republican ideas, sympathetic to the exiled Louis XVIII, and willing to join a new coalition against France. The Czar offered an army of 20,000 men, sent by sea to Holland on his Baltic fleet. He sent another army of 60,000 men, veterans of fighting in Poland and Turkey, under his best general, [[Alexander Suvorov]], to join the Austrian forces in northern Italy.\n\nThe King of Prussia, [[Frederick-William III]], had carefully preserved neutrality in order to profit from both sides. The Directory made the error of sending one of the most prominent revolutionaries of 1789, the Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e9s, who had voted for the death of Louis XVI, as ambassador to Berlin, where his ideas appalled the arch-conservative and ultra-monarchist king. Frederick William maintained his neutrality,  refusing to support either side, a setback for France.\n\nBy the end of 1798, the coalition could count on 300,000 soldiers, and would be able to increase the number to 600,000. The best French army, headed by Bonaparte, was stranded in Egypt. General Brune had 12,000 men in Holland; [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Bernadotte]], 10,000 men on the Rhine; Jourdan, 40,000 men in the army of the Danube; Massena, 30,000 soldiers in Switzerland; Scherer, 40,000 men on the [[Adige]] river in northern Italy; and 27,000 men under Macdonald were based in Naples: a total of 170,000 men. To try to match the coalition forces, the Directory ordered a new call up of young men between the ages of twenty and twenty five to the army, seeking to add two hundred thousand new soldiers. {{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=256}}\n\n==== Resurgence of the War in Italy and Switzerland ====\nOn 10 November 1798, the British and Austrian governments had agreed on a common goal of suppressing the five new sister republics and forcing France back into its 1789 borders. Then on 29 November 1798, on the first day of the [[War of the Second Coalition]], the [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|King of Naples]] launched an attack on Rome, which was lightly defended by French soldiers. A British fleet landed three thousand Neapolitan soldiers in Tuscany. However, the French army of General [[Jean \u00c9tienne Championnet|Championnet]] responded quickly, defeating the Neapolitan army at the [[Battle of Civita Castellana]] at [[Civita Castellana]] on 5 December. The next day, 6 December 1798, French soldiers also forced the [[King of Sardinia]] to remove his soldiers from [[Piedmont]] and to retreat to his island of [[Sardinia]], his last possession. The French army marched to the [[Kingdom of Naples]], obliging the King of Naples to leave his City of [[Naples]] on a British warship on 23 December 1798. Naples was then occupied on 23 January 1799, and a new Neapolitan republic, the so-called [[Parthenopean Republic]], the sixth under French protection, was proclaimed on 26 January.\n\nPeace negotiations with Austria went nowhere in the spring of 1799, and the Directory decided to launch a new offensive into [[Germany]], but the arrival of a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] army under Alexander Suvorov and fresh Austrian forces under the [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] for a time changed the balance of power. [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]]'s Army of the Danube crossed the Rhine on 6 March but was defeated by the Archduke Charles, first at the [[Battle of Ostrach]] and then at the [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|Battle of Stockach]] on 25 March 1799. Jourdan's army withdrew while Jourdan himself returned to Paris to plea for more soldiers.\n\nThe forces of the [[Second Coalition]] invaded French-occupied Italy, and after five earlier battles, a joint Russian-Austrian army under Suvorov's command defeated Moreau at the [[Battle of Cassano (1799)|Battle of Cassano]] on 27 April 1799 and thus occupied [[Turin]] and [[Milan]] and thereby took back the [[Cisalpine Republic]] from France. Suvorov then defeated the French Army on the Terrivva. To redress the situation, [[Barth\u00e9lemy Catherine Joubert|Joubert]] was named the new head of the Army of Italy on 5 July, but his army suffered defeat by the Russians at the [[Battle of Novi (1799)|Battle of Novi]], on 15 August;  Joubert himself was shot through the heart when the battle began, and his army was routed. The Sister Republics established by the French in Italy quickly collapsed, leaving only Genoa under French control. {{Sfn|Tulard|page=257}}\n\nIn August, the Russians and British opened a new front in the Netherlands. A British army was landed at Helder on 27 August, and was joined by a Russian army. On 31 August, the Dutch fleet, allied with France, was defeated by the Royal Navy. Seeing the French army and government in a crisis, the leaders of the royalist rebellions in the Vend\u00e9e and Brittany came together on 15 September to prepare a renewed uprising.{{Sfn|Tullard|1998|page=408}}\n\nThe surviving leaders of the royalist rebellions in the Vend\u00e9e and Brittany, which had long been dormant, saw a new opportunity for success and met to plan strategy on 15 September 1799. The royalist commander [[Louis de Frott\u00e9]], in exile in England, returned to France to command the new uprising.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=408}}\n\n==== Bonaparte's Campaign in Syria (February\u2013May 1799) ====\nWhile the French armies in Italy and Switzerland tried to preserve the Sister Republics, Bonaparte pursued his own campaign in Egypt. He explained in a letter to the Directory that Egyptian venture was just the beginning of a broader campaign \"to create a formidable diversion in the campaign of Republican France versus monarchic Europe. Egypt would be the base of something much larger than the original project, and at the same time a lever which will aid in the creation of a general uprising of the Muslim world.\"  This uprising, he believed, would lead to the collapse of British power from the Middle East to India.{{Sfn|Tulard|page=257}} With this goal in mind, he left Cairo and marched his army across the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai desert]] into Syria, where he [[Siege of Acre (1799)|laid siege]] to the port of [[Saint-Jean-d'Acre]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which was defended by a local army and supplied by a British fleet offshore. His long siege and attempts to storm the city were a failure; his army was ravaged by disease, it was down to 11,000 men, and he learned that an Ottoman army was to be embarked by the British fleet to sail to Cairo to recapture the city. On 17 May, he abandoned the siege and was back in Cairo by 4 June. The British fleet landed the Ottoman army, but as soon as they were ashore they were decisively defeated by Bonaparte at the [[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Battle of Aboukir]] on 25 July 1799.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=248\u2013249}}\n\nDue to the British blockade of Egypt, Bonaparte had received no news from France for six months. He sent one of his military aides to meet with Turkish government officials and to try to get news from France, but the officer was intercepted by the British navy. The British admiral and naval commander in the eastern Mediterranean, [[Sidney Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Sidney Smith]], who had lived in Paris and knew France well, gave the officer a packet of recent French newspapers and sent him back to Bonaparte.  Bonaparte spent the night reading the newspapers, learning about the political and military troubles in France. His orders permitted him to return home any time he chose. The next day he decided to return to France immediately. He handed over command of the army to [[Jean-Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber|General Kl\u00e9ber]] and left Egypt with a small party of senior officers aboard the frigate ''La Muiron''. He escaped the British blockade but did not reach France until 9 October.<ref>Thiers, Adolphe, ''Histoire de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', 1839 (Ninth edition), Volume 10, Chapter XIII, Project Gutenberg digital edition</ref>\n\n==== Tide turns: French successes (September 1799) ====\n[[File:SA 4941-Anno 1799. De slag bij Castricum..jpg|thumb|The French-Dutch victory over the British and Russians at the [[Battle of Castricum]], 6 October 1799, by Jan Antoon Neuhys, [[Amsterdam Museum]], [[Netherlands]]]]\nThe military position of France, which seemed disastrous during the summer, improved greatly in September. On 19 September, General Brune won a victory over the British-Russian army in the Netherlands at [[Battle of Castricum|Castricum]]. On 18 October, besieged by Brune at [[Alkmaar]], the British-Russian forces under the Duke of York agreed to withdraw. In Switzerland, a Russian Empire Army had split into two. On 25\u201326 September, the French army in Switzerland, led by [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na]], defeated one part of the Russian army under [[Alexander Korsakov|Alexander Rimsky-Korsakov]] at the [[Second Battle of Zurich]], and forced the rest of the Russian army, under Suvorov, into disastrous retreat across the Alps to 'Italy'. Suvorov was furious at the Austrians, blaming them for not supporting his troops, and he urged the Czar to withdraw his forces from the war.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=257}} \n \nThe royalist uprising in the west of France, planned to accompany the British-Russian-Austrian offensive, was also a failure. The Chouans briefly seized [[Le Mans]] on 14 October and [[Nantes]] on 19 October, but they were quickly driven out by the French Army, and the rebellion had collapsed by 29 October.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=409}}\n\n=== New economic crisis ===\nSince the beginning of the Revolution, the nation suffered from rampant inflation. By the time of the Directory, the paper money, the ''assignat'', based on the value of goods confiscated from the church and nobility, had already lost most of its value. Prices had soared, and the government could not print money fast enough to meet its expenses.  The value of the assignat had dropped drastically against the value of the livre, a coin from the old regime which contained silver. In 1790, at the beginning the Revolution, an assignat with a face value of 1000 livres could be exchanged for nine hundred real livres containing silver.  In January, 1795, The Convention decided to issue assignats worth thirty billion livres, without any additional backing by gold. By March 1795, an assignat with a value of one thousand livres could buy only eighty livres containing metal.  In February 1796, the Directory decided to abolish the assignat, and held a public ceremony to destroy the printing plates. The assignat was replaced by a new note, the ''Mandat territorial''.  But since this new paper money also lacked any substantial backing, its value also plummeted;  by February 1797 the ''Mandat'' was worth only one percent of its original value. The Directory decided to return to the use of gold or silver coins, which kept their value. One hundred livres of Mandats was exchanged for twenty sous of metallic money.  The difficulty was that the Directory had only enough gold and silver to produce three hundred million livres.   The result of the shortage of money in circulation was a drastic deflation and drop in prices, which was accompanied by a drop in investment, and a drop in wages.  It led to a drop in economic activity, and unemployment.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page-543}}\n\n=== New elections, new Directors and a growing political crisis ===\n[[File:Fabre - Lucien Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|[[Lucien Bonaparte]], 24-year-old brother of Napol\u00e9on, was elected President of the Council of Five Hundred, by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Fabre]], Museo Napoleonico, Rome]]\nNew elections to elect 315 members of the Councils were held between 21 March \u2013 9 April 1799.  The royalists had been discredited and were gone; the major winners were the neo-Jacobins, who wanted to continue and strengthen the Revolution.  The new members of the Council included [[Lucien Bonaparte]], the younger brother of Napoleon, just twenty-four years old. On the strength of his name, he was elected the President of the Council of Five Hundred.\n\nThis time the Directors did not try to disqualify the Jacobins but looked for other ways to keep control of the government. It was time to elect a new member of the Directory, as Rewbell had been designated by the drawing of lots to step down. Under the Constitution, the selection of a new member of the Directory was voted by the old members of the Councils, not the newly elected ones. The candidate selected to replace him was the Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e9s, one of the major leaders of the revolution in 1789, who had been serving as Ambassador to Berlin. Siey\u00e9s had his own project in mind: He had devised a new doctrine that the power of government should be limited in order to protect the rights of the citizens. His idea was to adopt a new Constitution with a supreme court, on the American model, to protect individual rights. He privately saw his primary mission as preventing a return of Reign of Terror of 1793, a new constitution, and bringing the Revolution to a close as soon as possible, by whatever means. {{Sfn|Lefebre|1977|page=719}}\n\nOnce the elections were complete, the Jacobin majority immediately demanded that the Directory be made more revolutionary. The Councils began meeting on 20 May, and on 5 June they began their offensive to turn the Directors to the left. They declared the election of the Director Treilhard illegal on technical grounds and voted to replace him with [[Louis-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Gohier]], a lawyer who had been Minister of Justice during the Convention, and who had overseen the arrest of the moderate Girondin deputies. The Jacobins in the Council then went a step further and demanded the resignation of two moderate Directors, La Revelliere and Merlin. They were replaced by two new members, [[Roger Ducos]], a little-known lawyer who had been a member of the Committee of Public Safety, and was an ally of Barras, and an obscure Jacobin general, [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois-Auguste Moulin]]. The new Ministers named by the Directors were for the most part reliable Jacobins, though Siey\u00e9s arranged the appointment of one of his allies, [[Joseph Fouch\u00e9]], as the new Minister of Police. {{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=241}}\n\nThe Jacobin members immediately began proposing laws that were largely favorable to the sans-culottes and working class, but which alarmed the upper and middle classes. The Councils imposed a forced loan of one hundred million francs, to be paid immediately according to a graduated scale by all who paid a property tax of over three hundred francs. Those who did not pay would be classified the same as \u00e9migr\u00e9 nobles and would lose all civil rights. The Councils also passed a new law that called for making hostages of the fathers, mothers and grandparents of emigre nobles whose children had emigrated or were serving in rebel bands or armies. These hostages were subject to large fines or deportation in the event of assassinations or property damage caused by royalist soldiers or bandits.{{Sfn|Sefebre|1977|page=719}} On June 27 General Jourdan, a prominent Jacobin member of the Councils, proposed a mass draft of all eligible young men between twenty and twenty-five to raise two hundred thousand new soldiers for the army. This would be the first draft since 1793.\n\nThe new Jacobins opened a new political club, the Club du Manege, on the model of Jacobin clubs of the Convention. It opened on 6 July and soon had three thousand members, with 250 deputies, including many alumni of the Jacobins during the Reign of Terror, as well as former supporters of the ultra-revolutionary Fran\u00e7ois Babeuf. One prominent member, General Jourdan, greeted the members at the club's banquet of July 14 with the toast, \"to a return of the pikes'\", referring to the weapons used by the sans-culottes to parade the heads of executed nobles. The club members also were not afraid to attack the Directory itself, complaining of its lavish furnishings and the luxurious coaches used by Directory members. The Directory soon responded to the provocations; Siey\u00e9s denounced the club members as a return of Robespierre's reign of terror. The Minister of Police, Fouch\u00e9, closed the Club on 13 August.{{Sfn|Lefebre|1977|page=684}}\n\n=== Bonaparte returns to France, coup d'\u00e8tat and the end of the Directory ===\n==== Preparing the coup d'\u00e8tat ====\n{{main|18 Brumaire}}\n[[File:Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s - crop.jpg|thumb|[[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s]] first proposed the coup d'\u00e9tat, but he was left out of the final resulting government]]\n[[File:Joseph Fouch\u00e9.png|thumb|[[Joseph Fouch\u00e9]], Minister of Police, assured that the police would not interfere in Bonaparte's seizure of power]]\nThe rule that Directors must to be at least forty years old became one justification for the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]]: the coup d'\u00e9tat took place on 9 November 1799, when Bonaparte was thirty years old.{{Sfn|Tulard, Fayard and Fierro|1998|pages=704\u2013705}} Bonaparte returned to France, landing at the fishing village of [[Saint-Rapha\u00ebl, Var|Saint-Rapha\u00ebl]] on 9 October 1799, and made a triumphal progression northward to Paris. His victory over the Ottoman Turks at the [[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Battle of Aboukir]] had been widely reported, and overshadowed the other French victories at the [[Second Battle of Zurich]] and the [[Battle of Bergen (1799)|Battle of Bergen]]. Between [[Avignon]] and Paris, he was welcomed by large, enthusiastic crowds, who saw him as a saviour of the Republic from foreign enemies and the corruption of the Directory. Upon his arrival in Paris he was elected to the [[Institut de France]] for the scientific accomplishments of his expedition to Egypt. He was welcomed by royalists because he was from a minor noble family in [[Corsica]], and by the Jacobins because he had suppressed the attempted royalist ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' at the beginning of the Directory. His brother Lucien, though only twenty-four years old, became a prominent figure in the Council of Five Hundred because of his name.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=260-261}}\n\nBonaparte's first ambition was to be appointed to the Directory, but he was not yet forty years old, the minimum age set by the Constitution, and the Director [[Louis-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Gohier|Gohier]], a strict legalist, blocked that avenue. His earliest ally had been the Director Barras, but he disliked Barras because his wife Jos\u00e9phine had been his mistress before she married Bonaparte, and because of charges of corruption that surrounded Barras and his allies. Bonaparte wrote later that the Jacobin director, General [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois-Auguste Moulin|Moulin]], approached Bonaparte and suggested that he lead a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'', but he declined; he wished to end the Revolution, not continue it.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|page=723}} Siey\u00e9s, who had been looking for a war hero and general to assist in a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'', had originally in mind General [[Barth\u00e9lemy Catherine Joubert|Joubert]], but Joubert had been killed at the [[Battle of Novi]] in August 1799. He then approached General [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]], but Moreau was not interested. The first meeting between Siey\u00e9s and Bonaparte, on 23 October 1799, went badly; the two men each had enormous egos and instantly disliked each other. Nonetheless, they had a strong common interest and, on 6 November 1799, they formalized their plan.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=260-261}}\n\nThe ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' was carefully planned by Siey\u00e8s and Bonaparte, with the assistance of Bonaparte's brother Lucien, the diplomat and consummate intriguer [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]], the Minister of Police [[Joseph Fouch\u00e9|Fouch\u00e9]], and the Commissioner of the Directory, Pierre Fran\u00e7ois R\u00e9al. The plan called for three Directors to suddenly resign, leaving the country without an Executive. The Councils would then be told that a Jacobin conspiracy threatened the Nation; the Councils would be moved for their own security to the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Cloud]], some {{convert|5|km}} west of Paris, safe from the mobs of the French capital. Bonaparte would be named head of government to defend the Republic against the conspiracy; the Councils would be dissolved, and a new Constitution would be written. If the coup went well, it was simply a parliamentary maneuver; it would be perfectly legal. Bonaparte would provide security and take the part of convincing the Deputies. Fouch\u00e9 and R\u00e9al would assure that there would be no interference from the police or the city of Paris. Fouch\u00e9 proposed that the leading Jacobin deputies be arrested at the start of the coup, but Bonaparte said it would not be necessary, which later proved to be an error.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=261\u2013263}}  Shortly before the coup, Bonaparte met with the principal army commanders: Jourdan, Bernadotte, Augereau and Moreau, and informed them of the impending coup. They did not all support it, but agreed not to stand in his way. The president of the Council of Ancients was also brought into the coup, so he could play his part, and Bonaparte's brother Lucien would manage the Council of Five Hundred. On the evening of 6 November, the Councils held a banquet at the former church of Saint-Sulpice. Bonaparte attended, but seemed cold and distracted, and departed early. {{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=723\u2013724}}\n\n==== Coup d'\u00e9tat is launched (9\u201310 November)====\n[[File:Bouchot - Le general Bonaparte au Conseil des Cinq-Cents.jpg|thumb|Bonaparte confronts the members of the Council of Five Hundred on 10 November 1799]]\nEarly in the morning of 9 November, army units began taking positions in Paris, and the members of the Council of Ancients were awakened and instructed to come to the Tuileries Palace for an emergency meeting. When they gathered at seven-thirty, they were told that a Jacobin conspiracy to overthrow the government had been discovered and that they should transfer their meeting the next day to the ''Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Cloud'', where they would be in safety. The members were asked to approve a decree to move the meeting site, and to appoint Bonaparte as commander of troops in Paris to assure their security.  Alarmed, they quickly approved the decree. Bonaparte himself appeared with his staff and told them, \"Citizen representatives, the Republic was about to perish. You learned of it and your decree has just saved it\".{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=263}} At eleven in the morning, the members of the Council of Five Hundred met at the [[Palais Bourbon]] and were given the same message. They agreed to move their meeting the following day to Saint-Cloud.\n\nAs planned, by the afternoon Siey\u00e9s and [[Roger Ducos]] had given their resignations. Talleyrand was assigned to win the resignation of Barras. Talleyrand was supplied with a large amount of money to offer Barras to quit; historians differ on whether he gave the money to Barras or kept it for himself. Barras, seeing the movements of soldiers outside and being assured that he could keep the great wealth he had acquired as a Director, readily agreed to leave the Directory. With three members gone, the Directory could not legally meet. The Jacobin directors Moulin and Gohier were arrested and confined to the [[Luxembourg Palace]] under the guard of General Moreau. The first day of the coup had gone exactly as planned.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=263}}\n\n[[File:Gros - First Consul Bonaparte (Detail).png|thumb|left|Bonaparte as the new First Consul, by [[Antoine-Jean Gros]], c. 1802, [[Mus\u00e9e de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur]], Paris]]\nOn 10 November, the members of both councils were taken in a procession of carriages with a strong military escort to Saint-Cloud. 6,000 soldiers had already been assembled at the ch\u00e2teau; because their pay had repeatedly been delayed, they were particularly hostile to the members of the Chambers. Bonaparte spoke first to the Council of the Ancients, assembled in the [[Orangery|''Orangerie'']] of the domain of Saint-Cloud, and explained that the Directory was no more. Bonaparte was received coldly, but the Council did not offer any opposition. He then moved to the Council of Five Hundred, which was already meeting under the presidency of his brother Lucien. Here he received a far more hostile reception from the Jacobin deputies. He was questioned, jeered, insulted, shouted down, and jostled. His brother was unable to restore calm, and some of the Jacobin deputies began to demand that Bonaparte be declared outside the law, as Robespierre had been. If the Council voted him outside the law, Bonaparte could be arrested and executed immediately without trial. While the deputies raged and argued, Bonaparte and his brother, escorted by a handful of soldiers, left the ''Orangerie'', approached the unit of [[grenadier]]s of General Murat waiting impatiently outside, and told them that the deputies had tried to assassinate Bonaparte with their pens. The grenadiers charged into the hall and quickly emptied it of deputies.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=263}}\n\nBonaparte wrote his own official version of what happened, which was published in all newspapers and posted on placards on walls all over France; it vividly described how he had narrowly escaped death from the hands of \"twenty Jacobin assassins\" and concluded: \"The majority returned freely and peacefully to the meeting hall, listened to the propositions which had been made for assuring the public safety, deliberated and prepared a beneficial resolution which should become the new law and basis of the Republic.\"{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=264\u2013265}}\n\nWith that event, the Directory was finished. A new government, the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], was founded. According to most historians, the [[French Revolution]] was over.\n\n== French society during the Directory ==\nDespite wars and social turmoil, the population of France continued to grow during the Directory. It was 27,800,000 in 1796, before the Directory, and had grown to 27,900,000 by 1801. Annual population growth had dropped from 16 percent in 1785, before the Revolution, to zero in 1790; but it then rebounded to 36 percent in 1795, then down to 12 percent in 1800. Part of the drop in birthrate during the Directory is attributed to the simplification of divorce, and the change in inheritance laws, which granted equal shares to all descendants. The number of young men killed in the wars during the Directory numbered 235,000 between 1795 and 1799. The high birth rate before the Revolution \u2013 together with conscription from conquered and allied states<ref>Brun, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois in: Revue historique des arm\u00e9es: Les unit\u00e9s \u00e9trang\u00e8res dans les arm\u00e9es napol\u00e9oniennes: un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la strat\u00e9gie globale du Grand Empire [http://rha.revues.org/6752]</ref> \u2013 allowed Napoleon to fill the ranks of his ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' during the [[First French Empire|Empire]] between 1804 and 1815.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=272}}\n\nBy the time of the Directory, French society had been dramatically restructured. Nobles and clergy, the two classes which had held most of the power before the Revolution, had disappeared. An estimated one percent of the population, mostly nobles and priests, but also many members of the upper middle class who had supported the [[Kingdom of France|monarchy]], had emigrated. The number was even higher in border regions, such as [[Bas-Rhin]], where 4.5 percent of the population had left.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=272}}\n\n=== Rich and poor ===\n[[File:Boilly-Point-de-Convention-ca1797.jpg|thumb|Dress of upper-class Parisians in 1797 by [[Louis-L\u00e9opold Boilly]]]]\nUnder the Directory the middle and upper classes took a dominant position in Paris society, replacing the nobility. Enormous fortunes were made, often by providing supplies to the army or by speculation on real estate. Some parts of the middle and upper classes suffered: the abolition of the old professional guilds of lawyers and doctors brought the ruin of many members, who faced competition from anyone who wanted to use those titles. The merchants and shipowners in Bordeaux, Nantes, Marseille and other ports were ruined by the British naval blockade. Bankers took on a more prominent role, when investment was scarce.\n\nTwo new groups gained importance during the Directory. The number of government officials of all levels increased dramatically. The writer [[Louis-S\u00e9bastien Mercier]] in his ''Paris pendant la R\u00e9volution (1789\u20131798), ou Le nouveau Paris'', published in 1800, wrote: \"There is no one who has not complained of the insolence, or the ignorance, of the multitude of government officials employed in the bureaus to sharpen their pens and to obstruct the course of affairs. New has the bureaucracy been carried to a point so so exaggerated, so costly, to exhausting.\"{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=276}}\n\nGenerals and other military officers also grew greatly in importance during the Directory and became a caste independent of the political structure. The Directory had abolished the Jacobin system of political commissioners who supervised and could overrule the military commanders. Generals like Bonaparte in Italy, Hoche in Germany and Pichegru in Alsace directed entire provinces according to their own ideas and wishes, with little interference from Paris. The soldiers of these generals were often more loyal to their generals than to the Directory, as the soldiers of Bonaparte showed during the 1799 coup d'\u00e9tat that ended the Directory.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=277}}\n\nThe working class and poor in Paris and other large cities suffered particularly from the high inflation during the first part of the Directory, which brought higher prices for bread, meat, wine, firewood and other basic commodities. In the last two years of the Directory, the problem was the opposite: with the suppression of the ''assignats'', the money became scarce, the economy slowed, and unemployment grew.    The Directory distributed scarce food items, such as cooking oil, butter and eggs, to government employees and to members of the Councils. Before the Revolution, taking care of the poor had been the responsibility of the Church. During the Directory, the government, particularly in Paris and other large cities, was forced to take over this role. To feed the Parisians and prevent food riots, the government bought flour in the countryside at market prices with its silver coins, then gave it to the bakeries, which sold it at the traditional market price of four sous a pound, which was virtually nothing. The subsidies were reduced in the last years of the Directory, paying only for bread, but they were an enormous expense for the Directory. At the beginning, the government tried to provide the standard minimum of one pound of bread a day per person, but the shortage of money reduced the daily ration to sixty grams of bread a day. The government also tried giving rice as a substitute for bread, but the poor lacked firewood to cook it.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=173\u2013174}}\n\n=== Crime and corruption ===\nEconomic problems led to a large increase in crime under The Directory, particularly in the countryside. Bands of the unemployed became beggars and turned to robbery, and brigands robbed travelers along the highways. Some of the brigands were former royalists turned highwaymen. They were later celebrated in the novel of [[Alexander Dumas]], ''Les Compagnons de J\u00e9hu'' (\"The Companions of Jehu\"). The government did not have the money to hire more police, and the great majority of the army was occupied fighting in Italy, Switzerland and Egypt. The growing insecurity on the roads seriously harmed commerce in France. The problem of brigands and highwaymen was not seriously addressed until after a serious wave of crimes on the roads in the winter of 1797\u201398. The Councils passed a law calling for the death penalty for any robbery committed on the main highways or against a public vehicle, such as a coach, even if nothing was taken. If the crime was committed by more than one person, the robbers were tried by a military tribunal rather than a civilian court. The wave of highway robberies was finally stopped by Bonaparte and the Consulate, which employed special tribunals even swifter and more severe than the Directory tribunals.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|page=449-450}}\n\nCorruption was another serious problem, particularly with the businessmen who provided supplies to the army and government. In one case, the Chevalier enterprise received a contract to build three large warships and two frigates at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]]; the company was paid in national property seized from the aristocracy and the Church, but it never constructed the ships, or even bought the materials.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|page=508}}  Huge contracts for government supplies were passed from the furnishers to sub-contractors, who each paid the furnisher a fee. Sometimes contractors demanded to be paid for their services in advance in silver. They were paid, but never delivered the services, and then reimbursed the government with nearly-worthless assignats. The Directors themselves were accused of receiving money from contractors. The Minister of Finance of the Directory, [[Dominique-Vincent Ramel-Nogaret]], was offered 100,000 francs for a bribe to give a contract by a furnisher named Langlois. Ramel refused and turned Langlois over to the police; however, some ministers and Directors, like Barras, left the government with large fortunes. The Directory was unable to escape the accusations of  widespread corruption.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|page=508}}\n\n=== ''Muscadins'', ''Incroyables'' and ''Merveilleuses'' ===\n[[File:Muscadins.jpg|thumb|''Les deux incroyables'': [[Muscadins]] or [[Incroyables]] wore extravagant costumes in reaction against the recent [[Reign of Terror]], by [[Carle Vernet]], c. 1797]]\nBorn in reaction against the strict codes of behavior established during the [[National Convention|Convention]] and the [[Reign of Terror]], the ''[[Muscadins]]'' were fashionable young men who carried canes and sometimes, in groups, attacked [[sans-culottes]]. Following soon afterwards, the Directory had its own fashion reflecting the new social behavior and carried out by young Parisians of both sexes, from middle and upper-class families, often survivors of the excesses of the Revolution, who had lost parents and family members to the guillotine. They were called ''[[Incroyables and Merveilleuses]]'' and dressed in extravagant costumes. The men, the ''Incroyables'', wore long hair to their shoulders, round hats with broad brims, short coats and silk culottes. Their female counterparts, the ''Merveilleuses'', wore flowing, high-breasted transparent dresses reminiscent of the Greco-Roman era. They frequented balls called ''[[Bals des victimes]]'' and spoke in their own particular accent and vocabulary, avoiding to pronounce the letter \"R\", as it was the first letter of the word \"Revolution\"{{Sfn|Tulard1998|page=884}}\n\n=== Marriage and divorce ===\nDuring the Directory, almost all the structures and rules of Paris society had been swept away, but no new structures and rules had yet been created to replace them. The [[brothers Goncourt]] meticulously described the period on their ''Histoire de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise pendant le Directoire''. Caste and rank mattered far less; all the old titles and forms of address had disappeared, along with old customs and social conventions. Men no longer took off their hats when talking to women, and people of different ranks spoke to each other as equals. Society no longer met in private, in the houses of the nobility, but in public, at balls, restaurants and public gardens. As the Goncourts said, \"social anarchy\" reigned in Paris: \"everyone met with everyone.\" Government ministers could be seen walking or dining with actresses, bankers with courtesans.{{sfn|de Goncourt|page=178}}\n \n\"Liaisons were easy\", the Goncourts reported, \"marriage less so.\" The old system of marriages arranged between families based on fortune, profession, and social condition was less common. Marriages were no longer controlled by the church, but by the new civil code, which described marriage as \"nature in action.\" Marriage was seen as a temporary, not a permanent state. Children born outside of marriage were given equal status concerning inheritance and other legal matters as those born to married couples. Divorce was much simpler, and could be requested by either the husband or wife. In one period of fifteen months, 5,994 civil law divorces were granted in Paris, of which 3,886 were requested by the wife. Of 1,148 divorces granted on the grounds of \"incompatibility of humor\", 887 were requested by the wife. The new system also led to a large increase in the number of children born outside of marriage and not wanted; in 1795 four thousand unwanted children in the Department of the Seine were turned over to foundling hospitals.{{sfn|de Goncourt|page=185}}\n\nThe breakdown of the old system of arranged marriages led to the creation of the first newspaper where men and women could advertise themselves for suitable spouses, called the ''Indicateur des marriages''. it also led to the establishment of the first marriage bureaus. A businessman named Liardot rented a large former mansion, brought in selected eligible young women as paying guests, and invited men seeking wives to meet them at balls, concerts and card games each given at the house each evening. The men were screened by their profession and education.{{sfn|de Goncourt|page=185}}\n\n=== Amusement\u2014''Bals des victimes'', pleasure gardens, new restaurants and caf\u00e9s ===\nAlthough balls were not banned during the [[Reign of Terror]],<ref>Tissier, Andr\u00e9, ''Les spectacles \u00e0 Paris pendant la R\u00e9volution... de la proclamation de la R\u00e9publique \u00e0 la fin de la Convention nationale (21 septembre 1792 \u2013 26 octobre 1795)'', publisher: Droz, 2002, pp. 363\u2013369 and further [https://books.google.com/books?id=saeLdu3k14AC&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=combien+de+bals+%C3%A0+paris+pendant+la+grande+terreur+de+robespierre&source=bl&ots=hDu_QlsZuB&sig=VfntF288ZtnF-3lCYjvaBFNHe70&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjzmszO8cXPAhUkJsAKHUC8Cy8Q6AEITzAH#v=onepage&q=bal&f=false]</ref> after the death of Robespierre and the fall of the Jacobins, the city experienced a frenzy of dancing that lasted throughout the period of the French Directory. The Goncourt brothers reported that 640 balls took place in 1797 alone. Several former monasteries were turned into ballrooms, including the [[Professed House (Paris)|Noviciate of the Jesuits]], the ''Monast\u00e8re des Carmes'' (turned into a prison where 191 members of the Catholic Church (bishops, priests, monks) were [[September Massacres|massacred on 2 September 1792]], the ''S\u00e9minaire Saint-Sulpice'', and even in the former Saint-Sulpice cemetery. Some of the former palatial townhouses of the nobility were rented and used for ballrooms; the ''H\u00f4tel de Longueville'' near the Louvre put on enormous spectacles, with three hundred couples dancing, in thirty circles of sixteen dancers each, the women in nearly transparent dresses, styled after Roman tunics. In the public balls, everyone danced with everyone; merchants, clerks, artisans and workers danced with shop women and seamstresses. In the more popular public balls, the ''cavaliers'' were charged 80 sous for admission, while women paid 12 sous. At more exclusive balls, admission was five livres.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|pages=145\u2013146}} Aristocrats who had survived or returned from exile held their own balls in their houses in the [[Faubourg Saint-Germain]], where ''[[Bals des victimes]]'' (\"Balls of the victims\") were attended by invitees who had lost at least one parent to the guillotine.\n\nThe formal dancing of the minuet was replaced by a much more passionate new dance, the [[waltz]], which was introduced to Paris during this time from Germany. For summer evening entertainment, Parisians began to abandon the Tuileries Gardens and the gardens of the [[Palais-Royal]] and went to the new pleasure gardens which appeared in the neighborhood between the [[Boulevards of Paris|Grands boulevards]] and the [[Palais-Royal]]. The most famous was the [[Jardin de Tivoli, Paris|''Jardin de Tivoli'']], also known as ''Folie Boutin'' or ''Grand Tivoli'', located on [[rue Saint-Lazare]]. It had belonged to an aristocrat named Boutin, who was guillotined during the Reign of Terror. It was a vast garden covering 40 [[Arpent|''arpents'']] (13,675 hectares), and could hold as many as ten thousand persons. It had alleys filled with promenaders, greenhouses, illuminations, an orchestra, dancing, a caf\u00e9, and fireworks at night. Other new gardens competed by adding spectacles and pageants. The ''[[Jardin des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]]'' offered a pageant of costumed soldiers on horseback performing elaborate maneuvers and firing weapons. The ''Mousseau'' (now ''[[Parc Monceau]]'') had performers dressed as [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] dancing and fighting battles. The former ''Pavillon de Hanovre'', which had been part of Cardinal Richelieu's residential complex, featured a terrace for dancing and dining decorated with Turkish tents, Chinese kiosks and lanterns.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|pages=213\u2013234}}\n\nMany new restaurants and caf\u00e9s, usually close to the twenty-three theaters, appeared in and around the Palais-Royal and the new boulevards. A new caf\u00e9, the ''Tortoni'', specializing in ice creams, opened in 1795 at the corner of the [[boulevard des Italiens]] and ''rue Taitbout''. The new restaurants in the Palais-Royal were often run by the former chefs of archbishops and aristocrats who had gone into exile. The restaurant ''M\u00e9ot'' offered a menu with over one hundred dishes. Beside the ''M\u00e9ot'' and ''Beauvilliers'', under the arcades of the Palais-Royal were the restaurants and caf\u00e9s such as ''Naudet'', ''Robert'', ''V\u00e9ry'', ''Foy'', ''Hur\u00e9'' <!-- there was a Hu\u00e9 at the Grand Palais (=end of 19th century)  -->, ''Berceau'', ''Lyrique'', ''Libert\u00e9 conquise'', ''de Chartres'' (now ''[[Le Grand V\u00e9four]]''), and ''du Sauvage'' <!-- can't find trace of any restaurant by the name of \"restaurant du Sauvage\" -->(the last owned by the former coachman of Robespierre). In the cellars of the Palais-Royal were more popular caf\u00e9s, usually with music, smaller menus at more reasonable prices. One of those, the ''Postal'' <!-- can't find anything by that name -->, offered a menu for just 36 sous. Many of the caf\u00e9s in the cellars had orchestras; the most famous was the ''Caf\u00e9 des Aveugles'', with an orchestra of four blind musicians.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|pages=73\u201383}}\n\nAfter the Reign of Terror had ended, dining hours for upper-class Parisians returned gradually to what they had been before the Revolution, with ''d\u00e9jeuner'' at midday, dinner at 6 or 7 in the evening, and supper at 2 in the morning. When the theater performances ended at 10 PM, the spectators went to the nearby caf\u00e9s on the boulevards.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|page=74}}\n\n== Church and State ==\nThe Roman Catholic Church was one of the greatest [[status quo]] losers of over the course of the 1789-1799 French Revolution.{{According to whom|date=December 2016}} Priests, who refused to take an oath to the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] emigrated or were expelled from France under a penalty of death. Church property, from cathedrals to candlesticks, was seized and sold. Church ceremonies were banned, causing clandestine religious services to be conducted in private homes. During the [[Reign of Terror]], at Robespierre's urging, the [[National Convention]], on 7 May 1794, proclaimed a new religion, the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]], which in a little over a year led to the [[Thermidorian Reaction]], and Robespierre's downfall and execution. The Roman Catholic Church had been the official state religion during the monarchy, and the Directors were all anti-religious republicans, but the Directory, with a few exceptions, did not try to impose any particular religious views, and its policy toward priests and religious institutions changed depending upon political events.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=548\u2013559}} After the fall of Robespierre, the repression against the Church eased and, although the policy of repression remained, many churches, especially in the provinces, re-opened, and exiled priests began to quietly return.\n\nIn November 1797, working with the new [[Decimal time|decimal-based]] [[French Republican Calendar|Republican Calendar]], the week of which has ten days, the Directory replaced Sundays and religious holidays with republican celebrations. The tenth day of the week, called ''decadi'', was designated to replace Sunday. The churches still functioning with Constitutional priests were instructed to have mass on ''decadi'', rather than on the day that would have been Sunday in the previous calendar, and ''decadi'' became the official non-working day: government employees were off, and schools, shops and markets were closed. To replace saints' and religious days, a whole series of secular holidays was created, in addition to the patriotic celebrations already in place, such as 14 of July and important dates of the French Revolution. There were also special days, such as, \"the day of the sovereignty of the people\"; \"the day of youth\"; \"the day of spouses\"; \"the day of agriculture\" and \"the day of the elderly\". Certain churches were given new names: the cathedral [[Notre Dame de Paris]] was renamed \"Temple of the Supreme Being\", Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont became the \"Temple of Filial piety\". On ''decadi'', the constitutional priests who performed services were required to share the space with other republican religions and associations who wanted to use the buildings. Large churches were divided into sections for use by various religions.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=548\u2013559}}\n\nA new religion, [[Theophilanthropy]], had been founded in 1796 by a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] printer-bookseller named Jean-Baptiste Chemin-Dupont\u00e8s (1760\u20131852?).<ref>[http://data.bnf.fr/12229334/jean-baptiste_chemin-dupontes/ Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]</ref> It was encouraged by the Director La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux and the Ministry of the Interior, with the state paying for its newspaper. Members believed in God and in the immortality of the soul, but not in the [[original sin]]. The sect was similar in form to [[Calvinism]], with readings aloud of texts, hymns and sermons. With the support of the Directory, the sect was given four churches in Paris, including Saint-Roch, Saint-Sulpice and, in April 1798, Notre-Dame de Paris, as well as churches in [[Dijon]], [[Poitiers]] and [[Bordeaux]]. Members of the sect included some prominent figures, such as General Hoche, the industrialist [[\u00c9leuth\u00e8re Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e du Pont]], the painter [[Jean-Baptiste Regnault]], and the American philosopher and political activist [[Thomas Paine]]. Beginning in May 1798, however, the Directory began to withdraw support from the newly established deistic sect, which it considered too close to the Jacobins. The sect still had eighteen churches in 1799, but in 1801 it was abolished by Bonaparte. {{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=548\u2013559}}\n\nIn Italy, the French army attacked the papal states governed by the Roman Catholic Church in Italy. In February 1797, Bonaparte occupied [[Ancona]] to force [[Pope Pius VI]] to negotiate. The pope was obliged to cede Ancona and the northern part of his states to the new French-sponsored [[Cispadane Republic]]. The gold and silver in the treasury of the Vatican was taken to France to help support the French currency. Following anti-French riots in Rome in December 1797, a French army under Berthier entered Rome and proclaimed a Roman Republic. Pius VI was taken prisoner by the French Army, and transferred to [[Valence, Dr\u00f4me|Valence]] in France, where he was kept prisoner until his death in 1801.\n\n== Economy ==\n=== Finance ===\nMany of the economic, social and political woes during the Directory were results of the breakdown of the financial system. The principal problem was a great shortage of money with real value; that is, coins made of silver, and an excess of paper money, the value of which shrank as more and more was printed. The Directory produced only 32 million [[French livre|livres]] worth of silver-based coins in its first two years. Much of this money was hoarded, since, unlike the paper money, it had and retained real value. As a consequence, the government, to cover its costs, was forced to print millions of notes, first called ''[[assignat]]s'' and then ''[[Mandats territoriaux|mandats]]'', which were based on the value of property seized from the Church and the clergy. These notes declined in value as more and more were printed. When the notes became nearly worthless, the Directory first devalued them and finally gave up and stopped printing paper money. The shortage of real money in the second part of the Directory led to a new problem: shortage of credit; interest rates rose to about ten percent, double what they had been in 1789. The consequence in the last two years of the Directory was a decline in economic activity, and in wages, while prices rose. The population lost confidence in the money and in the Directory's management.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=513\u2013515}}\n\nThe lack of credit led to the creation of a number of new private banks, and the growing importance of banks and bankers in the economy. The ''[[Caisse des comptes courants]]'', created in June 1796, had some of the most important industrialists and financiers in France as its founders, who would later become the founders of the [[Bank of France|''Banque de France'']]. Several other new private banks followed, which concentrated the wealth of France even more in Paris. Since the nobility had gone into exile, the bankers became the new nobility of France.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=515\u2013518}} In other words, bankers became the new aristocrats.\n\n=== Transportation and commerce ===\nThe transportation system within France was another handicap to the economy. The roads and canals had not been improved or maintained since the overthrow of the monarchy. Major canals that had been started in Burgundy and in the north were unfinished. Maritime commerce was in an even worse situation as a result of the war and blockade of French ports by Britain. During the Directory, the number of French ships of more than two hundred tons was one tenth of what it had been in 1789. The conquest of Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy improved the situation somewhat: French goods could be transported on the neutral ships of these countries, and maritime traffic on the [[Baltic Sea]] to Germany became an important trade route for France. However, the British navy largely cut off the trade with the French colonies in the Caribbean, which earlier had provided sugar, cotton, indigo and coffee to France; and the entry of the fleet of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Nelson]] into the [[Mediterranean Sea]] cut off the trade routes there. The major ports of [[Nantes]] and [[Marseille]] saw their commerce and trade routes disappear.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=523\u2013525}}\n\n=== Industry ===\nThe continual wars and fiscal crises greatly limited the expansion of French industry. The [[Industrial Revolution]] had only just begun in France. Production during the Directory had fallen below what it was in 1789. The number of workers in the [[Silk|silk industry]] in [[Lyon]] had dropped from 12,000 before 1787 to 6,500. The [[Cotton|cotton textile industry]] was more successful due to the embargo against British products caused by the war. New factories and new technologies, such as mechanical [[loom]]s, were introduced in [[Normandy]] and in [[Alsace]]. However, the technologies were still primitive; the [[steam engine]] had not yet arrived in French factories. The [[chemical industry]] was also advancing rapidly during the Directory; the chemist and entrepreneur [[Jean Antoine Claude Chaptal]] built a chemical factory in [[Montpellier]], which he soon moved to [[16th arrondissement of Paris|Chaillot]], a village west of Paris. The most effective promoter of French industry was [[Fran\u00e7ois de Neufch\u00e2teau]], who was Minister of the Interior before becoming a Director in 1797. He planned a new canal system, began work on a new road across the [[Pyrenees]], and organized the first national industrial exposition in Paris, which opened with great success in October 1798. Once he became Consul, Bonaparte copied the idea of the industrial exposition. Despite this bright spot, French industry was primitive: without steam power, most factories in France depended upon water power, and the [[Metalworking|metallurgy industry]] still melted iron with wood fires, not oil.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=528\u2013531}}\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nAgriculture was another weak spot of the French economy. While the country was essentially rural, the methods of farming had not been changed in centuries. The vast majority of farmers had small plots of land, sold little and worked essentially to produce enough food for their families. The price of grain was freed from government control under the Directory in 1797, and farmers could sell their grain at whatever price they could get. Following the Revolution in 1789, the forests had been taken away from the nobles and opened to everyone; as a result, large areas of the forests were immediately cut down, and no new trees planted to replace them. The land of the nobility and Church was taken and redistributed to peasants, but under the new inheritance laws, which gave equal shares to all sons, the size of the farm plots became smaller and smaller. Small plots were not consolidated into larger fields, as was taking place in England at the same time. Most farmers were reluctant to try new methods; they did not want to leave fields idle to recover productivity, or to grow forage crops to feed cattle. Furthermore, during the endless wars of the Directory, thousands of farmers were taken into the army, and thousands of [[horse]]s and [[mule]]s needed for farming were taken by the Army for the use of the [[cavalry]] and transport. Under these conditions, food shortages and famines occurred regularly in France until the time of [[Napoleon III]].{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=531\u2013533}}\n\n== Education and science ==\nThe education system of France was in a chaotic state at the beginning of the Directory. The College of Sorbonne and most other colleges of the University of Paris, had been closed because of their close association with the Catholic Church, and did not reopen until 1808. The schools run by the Catholic Church had also been closed, and any kind of religious instruction forbidden. The government of Jacobins during the Convention created several new scientific institutions, but had concentrated on primary education, which it decreed should be obligatory and free for all young people, but there were few teachers available. By forbidding religious education, seizing the property of the Church and chasing out the clergy, they effectively closed the largest part of the educational system of the country.\n\nAt the beginning of the period, the Directory reversed the policy of obligatory and free education for all, largely because of the lack of money to pay teachers. The Directory began to create a system of central schools, with the goal of one in each department, which boys could attend from the age of twelve, with a full curriculum of sciences, history and literature. The state paid a part of the cost, while each student also paid the professor a fee. The new schools had libraries (mostly confiscated from the nobility), small botanical gardens, and museums of natural history. For the first time in French schools, French instead of Latin was the basis of education. Three of these schools were organized in Paris; two of them later became the famous [[Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV]] and [[Lyc\u00e9e Charlemagne]]. But by the end of the Directory there were only 992 students in the three Paris schools.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=561\u2013562.}}\n\nFor primary education, each ''arrondissement'' in Paris had one school for boys and another for girls, and each [[Communes of France|commune]] in the country was supposed to have the same. Since the state lacked money, teachers were paid by the commune or by the students. Once a student learned to read, write, and count, he or she was graduated. In villages, the school was often located in the former church, and teachers were expected, as part of their duties, to carry water, clean the church, ring the bells, and, when needed, dig graves in the churchyard cemetery.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=564}}\n\nThe choices were greater for the children of the middle and upper middle class, as these families had tutors, or sent their children to private schools, but for much of the population, schooling was minimal. There were 56 public schools in the Seine department, which by the population should have had at least 20,000 students; but they had only between 1100 and 1200.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=564}}\n\nThe continual wars during the Directory also had their effect on education. Beginning in October 1797, boys in public schools were required to take part in periodic military exercises, and the Directory established five military schools, called ''\u00c9coles de Mars'', for a total of 15,000 students. Attendance was a requirement for entry into the higher schools of engineering and public works.\n\nThe Directory focused its attention on secondary education and especially on creating specialized higher schools for training managers, judges, doctors and engineers, for which there was an immediate and pressing need. The ''[[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]]'' had been founded by a member of the Directory, [[Lazare Carnot]] and the mathematician [[Gaspard Monge]], in 1794. The school became the most prestigious engineering and public works school in France. However, by the end of the Directory there were still no law schools, and only two schools of medicine outside of Paris.\n\nThe ''[[Institut de France]]'' was also founded in 1795 by [[Lazare Carnot]] and [[Monge]], to bring together the scientists and researchers, who previously had worked in separate academies, to share knowledge and ideas. It was divided into three large sections: physical sciences and mathematics; moral and political science; and literature and the fine arts. It organized the large party of scientists and scholars who accompanied Napoleon to Egypt, which discovered such treasures as the [[Rosetta Stone]], which allowed the deciphering of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. One of the ''Institut de France'' first members and speakers was Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, who took the place of Carnot after the latter had been removed from the Directory and left France.\n\n== Art and culture==\n=== Painting \u2013 The Salon and the Louvre ===\nThe artists of Paris were in a difficult situation during the Directory, as their most important patrons, the aristocracy, had been executed or had emigrated; however a new wealthy class was just being formed. Before the Revolution a half-figure portrait could be commissioned from a less-known artist for three hundred livres. During the Directory, the price fell to forty-eight livres.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|page=268}} Nonetheless, the [[Salon (Paris)|''Salon'']] took place in the Louvre in 1795 as it had since 1725, before the Revolution, and each year thereafter. The most prominent artist of the Revolution, [[Jacques-Louis David]], closely connected with the Jacobins, was in seclusion in his studio inside the Louvre. At the end of the period, in 1799, he produced one important work, the ''[[Intervention of the Sabine Women]]''. However, a new generation of artists, inspired by David,  showed their works; [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]]; [[Anne-Louis Girodet]], a pupil of David, renown for his romantic paintings, particularly a 1797 painting of the prominent actress [[Anne Fran\u00e7oise Elisabeth Lange|Mademoiselle Lange]] as [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]; [[Carle Vernet]], the son and father of famous painters; the portrait painter and [[Portrait miniature|miniaturist]] [[Jean-Baptiste Isabey]], known as the \"painter of the kings\" or \"portraitist of Europe\",<ref>[http://www.napoleon-empire.net/personnages/isabey.php ''Napol\u00e9on & Empire: Jean-Baptiste Isabey (1767\u20131855)]</ref> who painted queen [[Marie-Antoinette]] and empress [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Jos\u00e9phine]], and remained active until the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]; the genre painter [[Louis-L\u00e9opold Boilly]]; [[Antoine-Jean Gros]], a young history and landscape painter, who soon achieved fame and a government position in 1796 with a heroic portrait of Bonaparte at the [[battle of Arcole]]; the romantic landscapes of [[Hubert Robert]]; [[Pierre-Paul Prud'hon]], whose work combined [[Neoclassicism]] and [[Romanticism]]; and a major neoclassical sculptor from the earlier generation, [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], famous for his busts of [[George Washington]] and [[Voltaire]].{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|page=268}}\n\nMaking the Louvre into an art museum had first been proposed in 1747 by [[\u00c9tienne La Font de Saint-Yenne]] and supported by [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] in 1765 in the article on the Louvre in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]''. The idea was accepted by Louis XVI who, in 1789, began work on the ''Grande Galerie'' of the Louvre. The Revolution intervened, and on 27 July 1793 the Convention decreed the creation of a Museum of the Republic (''Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise''), which opened on 10 August 1793, the first anniversary of the [[10 August (French Revolution)|storming of the Tuileries]].{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1004}}\n\nIn 1797, at the end of Bonaparte's triumphant first Italian campaign, convoys of wagons began arriving in Paris, carrying bronze horses, Greek antiquities, tapestries, marble statues, paintings and other works of art taken from Italian cities under the terms of peace agreed by the Austrians. They included works by [[Raphael]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Titian]], [[Paolo Veronese]] and other masters. Other convoys arrived from the Netherlands and Flanders with more art from the Spanish provinces. The more famous works were displayed on wagons in a festive victory parade through the center of Paris. The rest was crammed, unwrapped, into the corridors, galleries and stairways of the Louvre. Work began to rebuild the ''[[Galerie d'Apollon]]'' and other galleries to provide a home for the 'newly acquired' art.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1860|pages=283\u2013287}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\" caption=\"Art during the Directory\">\nFile:Louvre-peinture-francaise-p1020324.jpg|''Imaginary view of the gallery of the Louvre as a ruin'', by [[Hubert Robert]] (1796), [[Louvre]], [[Paris]]\nFile:Gerard FrancoisPascalSimon-Cupid Psyche end.jpg|''Psyche et l'Amour'' by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]] (1797), Louvre\nFile:Girodet-Trioson - Mademoiselle Lange as Venus, 1798.jpg|''Mademoiselle Lange as Venus'', by [[Anne-Louis Girodet]] (1798), [[Museum der bildenden K\u00fcnste]], [[Leipzig]] \nFile:The Intervention of the Sabine Women.jpg|The ''Intervention of the Sabine Women'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1799), Louvre\n</gallery>\n\n=== Furniture and decoration \u2013 the ''Directoire'' style ===\n[[File:Styles of ornament, exhibited in designs, and arranged in historical order, with descriptive text. A handbook for architects, designers, painters, sculptors, wood-carvers, chasers, modellers, (14765802365).jpg|thumb|Furniture and objects in the Directory style]]\nThe Directory had no public money to spend on architecture, but the newly-wealthy upper class had abundant money to buy ch\u00e2teaux and town houses, and to redecorate them. The style of interior decoration, known as the ''[[Directoire style]]'', was one of the notable contributions of the period. It was a transitional style, a compromise between the  [[Louis XVI style]] and [[Neoclassicism in France|French neoclassicism]].  [[Riesener]], the famous furniture designer for Louis XVI, did not die until 1806, though his clientele changed from the nobility to the wealthy new upper class. The Directory saw the first widespread use of [[mahogany]], an imported tropical wood used in the making of furniture.{{Sfn|Lefebvre}}\n\n=== Literature ===\nThe Directory period produced a small number of important literary works, often very critical of the excesses of Revolution. These included  ''Essay on the Revolutions'' by [[Chateaubriand]], published in 1797, which called for a return to Christian values.  At the complete opposite end of the literary scale was the last major work of the [[Marquis de Sade]], ''The New Justine'', published in 1797.  Sade also wrote a satirical brochure mocking thinly-disguised characters resembling Bonapartre and Josephine. Shortly after the end Directory, on 6 March 1801, Sade was arrested for ''Justine'' and its sequel and ended his days in the insane asylum of Charenton. {{Sfn|Tulard1998||page=1081}}\n\n== Directory judged by historians ==\nolphe Thiers]], later twice the Prime Minister and the first president of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], wrote the first major history in French of the Revolution, in ten volumes, published between 1823 and 1827. He described the Directory this way:\n:<blockquote>One of the indispensable qualities of a government is to have good reputation that defends it against unjust attacks. When it has lost this reputation, and when people blame it for the faults of others, and even for bad luck, then it no longer has the ability to govern, and this incapacity should force it to retire. How many governments had been used up during the Revolution!... The Directory had been used up like the Committee of Public Safety before it, and the government of Napoleon that followed. All the accusations against the Directory proved not its faults but its nullity.<ref name=\"Thiers, Adolphe 1827\">Thiers, Adolphe, ''Histoire de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', Volume 10, Chapter XV, (1827). Online version on Project Gutenberg</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThiers blamed Barras, the only Director who served from the beginning to the end of the Directory, for its failure.\n:<blockquote>By a bizarre chance, but one that is seen often in the conflicts within revolutions, public opinion had indulgence for the one Director who merited it the least. Barras alone deserved all that was said of the Directory. First of all, he never worked; he left to his colleagues all the burden of business. He spoke only a decisive moments, when his voice was stronger than his courage. He occupied himself with nothing. He only concerned himself with the personnel of the government, which best suited his genius at intrigue. He took a share of all the profits of the government suppliers, and alone of the Directors deserved the accusation of corruption. Despite all of his faults, he was treated differently than the others, first of all because, unlike the other four, he was not a lawyer; and despite his laziness, his debauched habits, his bad manners, and his liaisons with the Jacobins, he alone was credited with 18 Fructidor [the downfall of Robespierre], and he gave the appearance of a man of action, more capable of governing than his colleagues... He was even treacherous toward his colleagues; because all of the criticism that he deserved himself he skillfully managed to shift exclusively onto them.<ref name=\"Thiers, Adolphe 1827\"/>  </blockquote>\n\nThe most celebrated and vivid description of French society under the Directory was written by the [[Goncourt brothers]], Edmond and Jules, published in 1864, which described the mores, daily life, culture and preoccupations of the Parisians. Its final chapter contained the lines:\n:<blockquote>Like a guest at the end of an orgy, France was weary; weary of gods, of tribunes, of heroes, of executioners; weary of struggles, of efforts, of cries, of curses, of enthusiasms, of fevers, of intoxications, of storms, of triumphs, of agonies \u2013 France was weary of revolutions, coups d'\u00e9tats. constitutions, legislatures... weary of conquests, weary of being saved; weary of Belgium submissive, Italy conquered; of Germany, when all the eagles of Germany had been taken to the ''Invalides'', but France was still not the head; France was weary of climbing into the sky, of amassing empires, of monopolizing the world; France glutted with glory; France broken, sleeping on a mattress of corpses, sleeping on a  bed of laurels. France, emptied of men, of silver, of crimes, of ideas, of eloquence; France, like Mirabeau when he was dying, asking of his doctors and his descendants only one single thing: to sleep!<ref>De Goncourt, Edmond et Jules, ''Histoire de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise pendant le Directoire'', (1864) [[Groupe Flammarion|Flammarion]], Paris</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe shortest and simplest description of the entire period, from the Convention to the Empire, was given by [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]] in 1837\u201343 in his novel ''[[Illusions perdues]]''. The Spanish Jesuit diplomat Carlos Herrera tells Lucien de Rubempr\u00e9: \"In 1793 the French invented government by the people, which ended with an absolute emperor.

For if the Revolution had put in circulation eight milliards of paper-money, the Thermidorean reaction went ten times as fast in that direction, for it issued the amazing sum of thirty milliards in paper ''within fifteen months''.<ref>[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin, Pyotr Alexeyevich]], ''The Great French Revolution, 1789\u20131793'', chapter ''The 9th Thermidor'', translated by [[Nora Dryhurst|N.

It repudiated most of the assignats [paper money] and the debt but failed to restore financial confidence or stability. Guerrilla activity flared up again in the Vend\u00e9e and other parts of western France. The religious schism became more acute; the Directory took severe measures toward the refractory clergy [those who would not swear allegiance to the government].<ref name=\"Joel Colton 1971 p 412\">R.R. Palmer and Joel Colton, ''A History of the Modern World'', 4th edition, 1971, p 412''</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1971, the American historians Jerome Blum, Rondo Cameron and Thomas G. Barnes wrote:\n:<blockquote>It was a government of self-interest rather than virtue, thus losing any claim on idealism. It never had a strong base of popular support; when elections were held, most of its candidates were defeated. Historians have been quite negative on the Directory's use of military force to overturn election returns that went against them. [...] Having by this coup d'\u00e9tat forfeited its claim to be a constitutional government, the Directory henceforth clung to power only by such illegal acts as purges and quashed elections.<ref name=\"Jerome Blum 1970 p 488\">Jerome Blum, Rondo Cameron, and Thomas G. Barnes, ''The European World \u2013 A History'', 2nd ed., 1970, p 488</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the 1970s, other historians wrote that the achievements of the Directory, were minor, though it did establish administrative procedures and financial reforms that worked out well when Napoleon started using them.<ref name=\"Hunt 1979 p 735\">Hunt, Lansky and Hanson, (1979) p 735</ref><ref name=\"Directory 1975 pp. 159-73\">Martyn Lyons, ''France under the Directory'' (1975), pp. 159\u201373</ref> It was blamed for creating  chronic violence, ambivalent forms of justice, and repeated recourse to heavy-handed repression.<ref name=\"Howard G.

On the one hand, massive disengagement, apathy, and cynicism about government; on the other hand, rancorous, violent hostility between the politically engaged minorities of royalists and Jacobins, between whom the directorial moderates vainly attempted to navigate. Legality became the main casualty in this situation.<ref>Isser Woloch, ''In the Aftermath of the French Revolution'', History Teacher, 1994, 28#1 pp. 7\u201311 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/494283 in JSTOR]</ref></blockquote>\n \nIn 2007, Howard Brown wrote: \n:<blockquote>The four years of the Directory were a time of chronic disquiet and the late atrocities had made goodwill between parties impossible. The same instinct of self-preservation which had led the members of the Convention to claim so large a part in the new legislature and the whole of the Directory impelled them to keep their predominance. War was at the center of attention, not only for the survival of France but for the loot and forced payments into the French treasury.<ref>Howard G, Brown, ''French revolutionary studies \u2013 A Discredited Regime: The Directory and Army Contracting'', in ''French History'', Oxford University Press, 1990, 4#1 pp: 48\u201376.</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Leadership and composition ==\nThe Directory was officially led by a president, as stipulated by Article 141 of the [[Constitution of the Year III]].

It gave its name to the final four years of the [[French Revolution]]. Mainstream historiography<ref>For example F. Furet and D. Richet in \u201cFrench Revolution\u201d (Macmillan, 1970)</ref> also uses the term in reference to the period from the dissolution of the [[National Convention]] on 26 October 1795 (4 Brumaire) to Napoleon's coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. \n\nThe Directory was continually at war with foreign coalitions which at different times included [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. It annexed [[Austrian Netherlands|Belgium]] and the [[left bank of the Rhine]], while Bonaparte conquered a large part of Italy. The Directory established 196 short-lived sister republics modelled after France, in Italy, [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]] and the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]]. The conquered cities and states were required to send to France huge amounts of money, as well as art treasures, which were used to fill the new [[Louvre]] museum in Paris. An army led by Bonaparte tried to conquer [[Eyalet of Egypt|Egypt]] and marched as far as [[Saint-Jean-d'Acre]] in [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]]. The Directory defeated a resurgence of  the [[War in the Vend\u00e9e]], the royalist-led civil war in the Vend\u00e9e region, but failed in its venture to support the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] and create an Irish Republic.\n\nThe French economy was in continual crisis during the Directory. At the beginning, the treasury was empty; the paper money, the [[Assignat]], had fallen to a fraction of its value, and prices soared. The Directory stopped printing assignats and restored the value of the money, but this caused a new crisis; prices and wages fell, and economic activity slowed to a standstill.\n\nIn its first two years, the Directory concentrated on ending the excesses of the [[Jacobin]] [[Reign of Terror]]; mass executions stopped, and measures taken against exiled priests and royalists were relaxed. The Jacobin political club was closed and the government crushed an armed uprising planned by the Jacobins and an early socialist revolutionary, [[Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Babeuf]], known as \"''Gracchus'' Babeuf\". However, following the discovery of a royalist conspiracy including a prominent general, [[Jean-Charles Pichegru]], the Jacobins took charge of the new Councils and hardened the measures against the Church and \u00e9migr\u00e9s. The Jacobins took two additional seats in the Directory, hopelessly dividing it.\n\nIn 1799, after several defeats, French victories in the Netherlands and Switzerland restored the French military position, but the Directory had lost the support of all the political factions. Bonaparte returned from Egypt in October, and was engaged by the [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s]] and others to carry out a parliamentary coup d'\u00e9tat on 8\u20139 November 1799. The coup abolished the Directory, and replaced it with the [[French Consulate]] led by Bonaparte.\n\n== Prehistory and genesis ==\n{{see also|History of France#Revolutionary France (1789\u20131799)}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}<!--many subsections have no or few citations-->\n\n=== Ending the rule of Robespierre ===\n{{see also|History of France#Death-sentencing politicians (February\u2013July 1794)|9 Thermidor|Fall of Maximilien Robespierre}}\n[[File:Max Adamo Sturz Robespierres.JPG|thumb|The Convention rises against Robespierre (27 July 1794)]]\n[[File:Execution robespierre, saint just....jpg|thumb|The execution of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and his chief followers on 28 July 1794 ended the [[Reign of Terror]] and opened the way to the Directory]]\nOn 27 July 1794, members of the [[French Convention]], the revolutionary parliament of France, rose up against its leader [[Maximilien Robespierre]], who was in the midst of executing thousands of suspected enemies of the Revolution. Robespierre and his leading followers were declared outside the law, and on 28 July were arrested and guillotined the same day. The Revolutionary Tribunal, which had sent thousands to the guillotine, ceased meeting and its head, [[Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville|Fouquier-Tinville]], was arrested and imprisoned, and after trial was himself sentenced to death. More than five hundred suspected counter-revolutionaries awaiting trial and execution were immediately released.\n\n=== Purpose of the new Constitution ===\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Boissy d-Anglas.jpg|thumb|[[Fran\u00e7ois Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas]], one of the principal authors of the [[Constitution of 1795]], which created the Directory]]\nIn July 1794, the members of the Convention began planning a new form of government and drafting a new Constitution, which would become the [[Constitution of the Year III]] (August 1795). An important aim was to prevent too much power from becoming concentrated in the hands of one man. One of the authors of the new Constitution, [[Fran\u00e7ois Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas]], wrote to the Convention:\n<blockquote>We propose to you to compose an executive power of five members, renewed with one new member each year, called the Directory. This executive will have a force concentrated enough that it will be swift and firm, but divided enough to make it impossible for any member to even consider becoming a tyrant. A single chief would be dangerous. Each member will preside for three months; he will have during this time the signature and seal of the head of state. By the slow and gradual replacement of members of the Directory, you will preserve the advantages of order and continuity and will have the advantages of unity without the inconveniences.<ref name=tulard/></blockquote>\n\n=== Structure of the new Constitution ===\nThe [[Constitution of the Year III]] (22 August 1795) began with the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] and declared that \"the Rights of Man in society are liberty, equality, security, and property\".{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=702}}  It guaranteed freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and freedom of labour, but forbade armed assemblies and even public meetings of political societies. Only individuals or public authorities could tender petitions.\n\nThe judicial system was reformed, and judges were given short terms of office: two years for justices of the peace, five for judges of department tribunals. They were elected, and could be re-elected, to assure their independence from the other branches of government.\n\nThe new legislature had two houses, a [[Council of Five Hundred]] and a [[Council of Ancients]] with two hundred fifty members. Electoral assemblies in each [[Cantons of France|''canton'' of France]], which brought together a total of thirty thousand qualified electors, chose representatives to an electoral assembly in each [[Departments of France|department]], which then elected the members of both houses. The members of this legislature had a term of three years, with one-third of the members renewed every year. The Ancients could not initiate new laws, but could veto those proposed by the Council of Five Hundred.\n\nThe Constitution established a unique kind of executive, a five-man Directory chosen by the legislature.<ref>J. F,. Bosher, ''The French Revolution'' (1988), pp. 226\u201330</ref><ref>Gershoy, ''The French Revolution and Napoleon'' (1964) pp. 303\u20138</ref> It required the Council of Five Hundred to prepare, by secret ballot, a list of candidates for the Directory. The Council of Ancients then chose, again by secret ballot, the Directors from that provided list. The Constitution required that Directors be at least forty years old. To assure gradual but continual change, one Director, chosen by lot, was replaced each year. Ministers for the various departments of State aided the Directors. These ministers did not form a council or cabinet and had no general powers of government.\n\nThe new Constitution sought to create a [[separation of powers]]; the Directors had no voice in legislation or taxation, nor could Directors or Ministers sit in either house. To assure that the Directors would have some independence, each would be elected by one portion of the legislature, and they could not be removed by the legislature unless they violated the law.<ref name=tulard>Jean Tulard, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Fayard, Alfred Fierro, ''Histoire et dictionnaire de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', Robert Laffont, Paris, 1998, pp. 198\u2013199. (In French)</ref>\n\nUnder the new [[Constitution of 1795]], to be eligible to vote in the elections for the Councils, voters were required to meet certain minimum property and residency standards. In towns with over six thousand population, they had to own or rent a property with a revenue equal to the standard income for at least one hundred fifty or two hundred days of work, and to have lived in their residence for at least a year. This ruled out a large part of the French population.\n\nThe big loser under the new system was the City of Paris, which had dominated events in the first part of the Revolution. On 24 August 1794,  the committees of the sections of Paris, the bastions of the Jacobins, which had provided most of the manpower for demonstrations and invasions of the Convention, were abolished. Shortly afterwards, on 31 August, the municipality of Paris, which had been the domain of Danton and Robespierre, was abolished, and the city placed under direct control of the national government. When the Law of 19 Vend\u00e9miaire Year IV (11 October 1795), in application of the [[Constitution of the Year III|new Constitution]], created the first twelve ''[[arrondissement]]s'' of Paris, it established twelve new committees, one for each ''arrondissement''. The city became a new [[Departments of France|department]], the [[Seine (department)|department of the Seine]], replacing the former department of Paris created in 1790.<ref>Fierro, Alfred, ''Histoire et dictionnaire de Paris'' (1996), Robert Laffont, p. 608, (French)</ref><ref>''Loi du 19 vend\u00e9miaire, an 4.

On 21 September 1794, the remains of [[Jean-Paul Marat]], whose furious articles had promoted the Reign of Terror, were placed with great ceremony in the [[Pantheon (Paris)|Panth\u00e9on]], while on the same day, the moderate Convention member [[Antoine Christophe Merlin|Merlin de Thionville]] described the Jacobins as \"A hangout of outlaws\" and the \"knights of the guillotine\". Young men known as [[Muscadins]], largely from middle-class families, attacked the Jacobin and radical clubs. The new freedom of the press saw the appearance of a host of new newspapers and pamphlets from the left and the right, such as the royalist ''L'Orateur du peuple'' edited by [[Louis-Marie Stanislas Fr\u00e9ron|Stanislas Fr\u00e9ron]], an extreme Jacobin who had moved to the extreme right, and at the opposite end of the spectrum, the ''Tribun du peuple'', edited by [[Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Babeuf|Gracchus Babeuf]], a former priest who advocated an early version of [[socialism]]. On 5 February 1795, the semi-official newspaper ''[[Le Moniteur Universel]]'' (''Le Moniteur'') attacked Marat for encouraging the bloody extremes of the [[Reign of Terror]]. Marat's remains were removed from the Panth\u00e9on two days later.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=375}} The surviving [[Girondin]] deputies, whose leaders had been executed during the Reign of Terror, were brought back into the Convention on 8 March 1795.\n\nThe Convention tried to bring a peaceful end to the Catholic and royalist [[War in the Vend\u00e9e|uprising in the Vend\u00e9e]]. The Convention signed an amnesty agreement, promising to recognize the freedom of religion and allowing territorial guards to keep their weapons if the ''Vend\u00e9ens'' would end their revolt. On a proposal from Boissy d'Anglas, on 21 February 1795 the Convention formally proclaimed the freedom of religion and the separation of church and state.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=375}}\n\n=== Wars (1794\u20131795) ===\nBetween July 1794 and the October 1795 elections for the new-style Parliament, the government tried to obtain international peace treaties and secure French gains. In January 1795 General [[Jean-Charles Pichegru|Pichegru]] took advantage of an extremely cold winter and invaded the [[Netherlands|Dutch Republic]]. He captured [[Utrecht]] on 18 January, and on 14 February units of French cavalry captured the Dutch fleet, which was trapped in the ice at [[Den Helder]]. The Dutch government asked for peace, conceding [[Zeelandic Flanders|Dutch Flanders]], [[Maastricht]] and [[Venlo]] to France. On 9 February, after a French offensive in the Alps, the [[Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke of Tuscany]] signed a treaty with France. Soon afterwards, on 5 April, France signed a peace treaty, the [[Peace of Basel]], with [[Prussia]], where [[Frederick William II of Prussia|King Frederick William II]] was tired of the war; Prussia recognized the French occupation of the western bank of the [[Rhine]]. On 22 July 1795, a peace agreement, the \"Treaty of Basel\", was signed with Spain, where the French army had marched as far as [[Bilbao]]. By the time the Directory was chosen, the coalition against France was reduced to Britain and [[Austria]], which hoped that [[Russian Empire|Russia]] might be brought in on its side.\n\n=== Failed Jacobin coup (May 1795) and rebellion in Brittany (June\u2013July) ===\n{{main|Revolt of 1 Prairial Year III}}\n[[File:Louis Lazare Hoche1.jpg|thumb|General [[Lazare Hoche]] defeated a royalist army that landed in Brittany (July 1795)]]\nOn 20 May 1795 (1 Prairial Year III), the Jacobins attempted to seize power in Paris. Following the model of Danton's seizure of the National Assembly in June, 1792, a mob of [[sans-culottes]] invaded the meeting hall of the Convention at the Tuileries, killed one deputy, and demanded that a new government be formed. This time the army moved swiftly to clear the hall. Several deputies who had taken the side of the invaders were arrested. The uprising continued the following day, as the sans-culottes seized the ''H\u00f4tel de Ville'' as they had done in earlier uprisings, but with little effect; crowds did not move to support them. On the third day, 22 May, the army moved into and occupied the working-class neighborhood of the faubourg Saint-Antoine. The sans-culottes were disarmed and their leaders were arrested. In the following days the surviving members of the Committee of Public Safety, the committee that had been led by Robespierre, were arrested, with the exception of [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]] and two others. Six of the deputies who had participated in the uprising and had been sentenced to death committed suicide before they were taken to the guillotine.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=378}}\n\nOn 23 June 1795, the [[Chouan]]s, royalist and Catholic rebels in [[Brittany]], formed an army of 14,000 men near [[Quiberon]]. With the assistance of the British navy, a force of two thousand royalists was landed at Quiberon. The French army under General [[Hoche]] reacted swiftly, forcing the royalists to take refuge on the peninsula and then to withdraw. They surrendered on 21 July; 748 of the rebels were executed by firing squad.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=379}}\n\n=== Adoption of the new Constitution ===\n[[File:Paul Barras directeur.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Barras]] organized the defense of the government against attacks from the left and right (e.g. October 1795)]]\nThe new [[Constitution of the Year III]] was presented to the Convention and debated between 4 July \u2013 17 August 1795, and was formally adopted on 22 August 1795. It was a long document, with 377 articles, compared with 124 in the first French Constitution of 1793. Even before it took effect, however, the members of the Convention took measures to assure they would still have dominance in the legislature over the government. They required that in the first elections, two hundred and fifty new deputies would be elected, while five hundred members of the old Convention would remain in place until the next elections. A national referendum of eligible voters was then held. The total number of voters was low; of five million eligible voters, 1,057,390 electors approved the Constitution, and 49,978 opposed it. The proposal that two thirds of members of the old Convention should remain in place was approved by a much smaller margin, 205,498 to 108,754. {{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=199}}\n\n=== October 1795 royalist rebellion ===\n{{main|13 Vend\u00e9miaire}}\n[[File:Attaque de la Convention nationale, 1790.jpg|thumb|[Napoleon|Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte's soldiers fire upon insurgents at the [[Saint-Roch, Paris|church of Saint Roch]] (5 October 1795)]]\n[[File:Bonaparte by Giuseppe Longhi.jpg|thumb|Bonaparte as a new general in the [[Army of the Interior]] (1795)]]\nThe new [[Constitution of the Year III]] was officially proclaimed in force on 23 September 1795, but the new Councils had not yet been elected, and the Directors had not yet been chosen. The leaders of the royalists and constitutional monarchists chose this moment to try to seize power. They saw that the vote in favor of the new Constitution was hardly overwhelming. Paris voters were particularly hostile to the idea of keeping two-thirds of the old members of the Convention in the new Councils. A central committee was formed, with members from the wealthier neighborhoods of Paris, and they began planning a march on the center of the city and on the Tuileries, where the Convention still met.\n\nThe members of the Convention, very much experienced with conspiracies, were well aware that the planning was underway. A group of five republican deputies, led by [[Paul Barras]], had already formed an unofficial directory, in anticipation of the creation of the real one. They were concerned about the national guard members from western Paris, and were unsure about the military commander of Paris, [[Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Menou|General Menou]]. Barras decided to turn to military commanders in his entourage who were known republicans, particularly [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]], whom he had known when Bonaparte was successfully  fighting the British in Toulon. Bonaparte, at this point a general of second rank in the Army of the Interior, was ordered to defend the government buildings on the right bank.\n\nThe armed royalist insurgents planned a march in two columns along both the right bank and left bank of the Seine toward the Tuileries. There on October 5, 1795, the royalists were met by the artillery of General [[Joachim Murat]] at the Sablons and by Bonaparte's soldiers and artillery in front of the church of Saint-Roch. The whiff of grapeshot of Bonaparte's cannons and gunfire of his soldiers brutally mowed down advancing columns, killing some four hundred insurgents, and ended the rebellion. Bonaparte was promoted to General of Division on 16 October, and General in Chief of the Army of the Interior on 26 October. It was the last uprising to take place in Paris during the French Revolution.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=202}}\n\n== History ==\n=== Directory takes charge ===\nBetween 12 and 21 October 1795, immediately after the suppression of royalist uprising in Paris, the elections for the new Councils decreed by the new Constitution took place. Three-hundred seventy nine members of the old Convention, for the most part moderate republicans, were elected to the new legislature. To assure that the Directory did not abandon the Revolution entirely, the Council required that all of the members of the Directory be former members of the Convention and [[regicides]], those who had voted for the execution of [[Louis XVI]].\n\nDue to the rules established by the Convention, a majority of members of the new legislature, 381 of 741 deputies, had served in the Convention and were ardent republicans, but a large part of the new deputies elected were royalists, 118 versus 11 from the left. The members of the upper house, the Council of Ancients, were chosen by lot from among all of the deputies.\n\nOn 31 October 1795, the Council of Ancients chose the first Directory from a list of candidates submitted by the Council of Five Hundred. One person elected, the [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s]], refused to take the position, saying it didn't suit his interests or personality.  A new member, [[Lazare Carnot]], was elected in his place.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=204\u2013206}}\n\nThe members elected to the Directory were the following:\n* [[Paul Fran\u00e7ois Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras]], a member of a minor noble family from [[Provence]],  Barras had been a revolutionary envoy to Toulon, where he met the young Bonaparte, and arranged his promotion to captain. Barras had been removed from the [[Committee of Public Safety]] by Robespierre. Fearing for his life, Barras had helped organize the downfall of Robespierre. An expert at political intrigue, Barras became the dominant figure in the Directory. His leading opponent in the Directory,  Carnot, described him as \"without faith and without morals... in politics, without character and without resolution... He has all the tastes of an opulent prince, generous, magnificent and dissipated.\" {{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=564}} \n* [[Louis Marie de La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux]] was a fierce republican and anti-Catholic, who had proposed to execute Louis XVI after the [[flight to Varennes]]. He promoted the establishment of a new religion, [[theophilanthropy]], to replace Christianity.  \n* [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rewbell]] had an expertise in foreign relations, and was a close ally of Paul Barras. He  was a firm moderate republican who had voted for the death of the King but had also opposed Robespierre and the extreme Jacobins. He was an opponent of the Catholic church and a proponent of individual liberties. \n* [[\u00c9tienne-Fran\u00e7ois Le Tourneur]] was a former captain of engineers, and a specialist in military and naval affairs. He was a close ally within the Directory of Carnot. \n* [[Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot]]: when the Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e9s was elected by the Ancients, but refused the position, his place was taken by Carnot. Carnot was an army captain at the beginning of the Revolution, and when elected to the Convention became a member of the commission of military affairs, as well as a vocal opponent of Robespierre. He was an energetic and efficient manager, who restructured the French military and helped it achieve its first successes, earning him the title of \"The Organizer of the Victory.\"  Napoleon, who later made Carnot his Minister of War, described him as \"a hard worker, sincere in everything, but without intrigues, and easy to fool.\"{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=624}}\n\nThe following day, the members of the new government took over their offices in the Luxembourg Palace, which had previously been occupied by the Committee of Public Safety. Nothing had been prepared, and the rooms had no furniture: they managed to find firewood to heat the room, and a table in order to work. Each member took charge of a particular sector: Rewbell diplomacy; Carnot and Le Tourneur military affairs, La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux religion and public instruction, and Barras internal affairs.\n\nThe Council of Ancients was attributed the building at the Tuileries Palace formerly occupied by the Convention, while the Council of Five Hundred deliberated in the ''[[Salle du Man\u00e8ge]]'', the former riding school west of the palace in the [[Tuileries Garden]]. One of the early decisions of the new parliament was to designate uniforms for both houses: the Five Hundred wore long white robes with a blue belt, a scarlet cloak and a hat of blue velour, while members of the Ancients wore a robe of blue-violet, a scarlet sash, a white mantle, and a violet hat.\n{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=206}}\n\n==== Gallery ====\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Paul Barras.jpg|[[Paul Barras]] (here in the ceremonial dress of a Director) was a master of political intrigue\nFile:La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux Directeur.JPG|[[Louis Marie de La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux]]\nFile:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Reubell.JPG|[[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rewbell]]\nFile:\u00c9tienne-Fran\u00e7ois Le Tourneur - Directeur.jpg|[[\u00c9tienne-Fran\u00e7ois Le Tourneur]]\nFile:Portrait Lazare Carnot.jpg|[[Lazare Carnot]], a brilliant organizer and mathematician but poor intriguer, was the enemy of Barras\n</gallery>\n\n=== Finance and economy ===\nThe new Director overseeing financial affairs, La R\u00e9veilli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux, gave a succinct description of the financial state of France when the Directory took power: \"The national Treasury was completely empty; not a single sou remained. The [[assignats]] were almost worthless; the little value which remained drained away each day with accelerated speed. One could not print enough money in one night to meet the most pressing needs of the next day.... The public revenues were nonexistent; citizens had lost the habit of paying taxes. [...] All public credit was dead and all confidence lost. [...] The depreciation of the ''assignats'', the frightening speed of the fall, reduced the salary of all public employees and functionaries to a value which was purely nominal.\"{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=209\u2013210}}\n\nThe drop in value in the money was accompanied by extraordinary inflation. The ''[[Louis d'or]]'' (gold coin), which was worth 2000 [[Livre tournois|''livres'']] in paper money at the beginning of the Directory, increased to 3000 and then 5000 ''livres''. The price of a liter of wine increased from 50 sous in October 1795 to ten francs and then thirty francs. A measure of flour worth two ''livres'' in 1790 was worth 225 ''livres'' in October 1794.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=209\u2013210}}\n\nThe new government continued to print ''assignats'', which were based on the value of property confiscated from the Church and the aristocracy, but it could not print them fast enough; even when it printed one hundred million in a day, it covered only one-third of the government's needs. To fill the treasury, the Directory resorted in December 1795 to a forced loan of 600 million ''livres'' from wealthy citizens, who were required to pay between 50 and 6000 ''livres'' each.\n\nTo fight inflation, the government began minting more coins of gold and silver, which had real value;  the government had little gold but large silver reserves, largely in the form of silverware, candlesticks and other objects confiscated from the churches and the nobility. It minted 72 million [[\u00e9cus]], and when this silver supply ran low, it obtained much more gold and silver through military campaigns outside of France, particularly from Bonaparte's [[Army of Italy (France)|army in Italy]]. Bonaparte demanded gold or silver from each city he conquered, threatening to destroy the cities if they did not pay.\n\nThese measures reduced the rate of inflation. On 19 February 1796, the government held a ceremony in the [[Place Vend\u00f4me]] to destroy the printing presses which had been used to produce huge quantities of ''assignats''. This success produced a new problem: the country was still flooded with more than two billion four hundred million (2.400.000.000) ''assignats'', claims on confiscated properties, which now had some value. Those who held ''assignats'' were able to exchange them for state mandates, which they could use to buy ch\u00e2teaux, church buildings and other [[biens nationaux]] (state property) at extremely reduced prices. Speculation became rampant, and property in Paris and other cities could change hands several times a day.\n\nAnother major problem faced by the Directory was the enormous public debt, the same problem that had led to the Revolution in the first place. In September\u2013December 1797, the Directory attacked this problem by declaring bankruptcy on two-thirds of the debt, but assured payment on the other third. This resulted in the ruin of those who held large quantities of government bonds, but stabilized the currency. To keep the treasury full, the Directory also imposed new taxes on property owners, based on the number of fireplaces and chimneys, and later on the number of windows, of their residences. It refrained from adding more taxes on wine and salt, which had helped cause the 1789 revolution, but added new taxes on gold and silver objects, playing cards, tobacco, and other luxury products. Through these means, the Directory brought about a relative stability of finances which continued through the Directory and Consulate. {{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=209\u2013213}}\n\n=== Food supply ===\nThe food supply for the population, and particularly for the Parisians, was a major economic and political problem before and during the Revolution; it had led to food riots in Paris and attacks on the [[National Convention|Convention]]. To assure the supply of food to the [[sans-culottes]] in Paris, the base of support of the [[Jacobins]], the Convention had strictly regulated grain distribution and set maximum prices for bread and other essential products. As the value of the currency dropped, the fixed prices soon did not cover the cost of production, and supplies dropped. The Convention was forced to abolish the [[General maximum|maximum]] on 24 December 1794, but it continued to buy huge quantities of bread and meat which it distributed at low prices to the Parisians. This Paris food distribution cost a large part of the national budget, and was resented by the rest of the country, which did not have that benefit. By early 1796, the grain supply was supplemented by deliveries from [[Italy]] and even from [[Algeria]]. Despite the increased imports, the grain supply to Paris was not enough. The Ministry of the Interior reported on 23 March 1796 that there was only enough wheat to make bread for five days, and there were shortages of meat and firewood. The Directory was forced to resume deliveries of subsidized food to the very poor, the elderly, the sick, and government employees. The food shortages and high prices were one factor in the growth of discontent and the [[Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Babeuf|Gracchus Babeuf]]'s uprising, the [[Conspiracy of the Equals]], in 1796. The harvests were good in the following years and the food supplies improved considerably, but the supply was still precarious in the north, the west, the southeast, and the valley of the Seine.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=209}}\n\n=== Babeuf's Conspiracy of the Equals ===\n{{main|Conspiracy of the Equals}}\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Babeuf.jpg|thumb|[[Fran\u00e7ois No\u00ebl Babeuf]], engraving by Fran\u00e7ois Bonneville, 1794 (BNF, D\u00e9partement des Estampes)]]\n[[File:Attaque camp de Grenelle.jpeg|thumb|Attack by the followers of Babeuf on the army camp of Grenelle on 9 and 10 September 1796. Drawing by [[Abraham Girardet]], engraving by Pierre-Gabriel Berthault, 1802. (BNF, D\u00e9partement des Estampes)]]\nIn 1795, the Directory faced a new threat from the left, from the followers of [[Fran\u00e7ois No\u00ebl Babeuf]], a talented political agitator who took the name ''Gracchus'' and was the organizer of what became known as the [[Conspiracy of the Equals]]. Babeuf had, since 1789, been drawn to the Agrarian Law, an agrarian reform preconized by the ancient Roman brothers, [[Gracchi|Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus]], of sharing [[Common ownership|goods in common]], as means of achieving economic equality. By the time of the [[Fall of Maximilien Robespierre|fall of Robespierre]], he had abandoned this as an impractical scheme and was moving towards a more complex plan.<ref>John Hall Stewart, ''A Documentary Survey of the French Revolution'' (1951) pp 654\u201357</ref> Babeuf did not call for the abolition of private property, and wrote that peasants should own their own plots of land, but he advocated that all wealth should be shared equally: all citizens who were able would be required to work, and all would receive the same income. Babeuf did not believe that the mass of French citizens was ready for self-government; accordingly, he proposed a dictatorship under his leadership until the people were educated enough to take charge. \"People!\", Babeuf wrote. \"Breathe, see, recognize your guide, your defender.... Your tribune presents himself with confidence.\" {{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|p=|pages=189}}\n\nAt first, Babeuf's following was small; the readers of his newspaper, ''Le Tribun du peuple'' (\"The Tribune of the People\"), were mostly middle-class far-left Jacobins who had been excluded from the new government. However, his popularity increased in the working-class of the capital with the drop in value of the ''assignats'', which rapidly resulted in the decrease of wages and the rise of food prices. Beginning in October 1795, he allied himself with the most radical Jacobins, and on 29 March 1796 formed the ''Directoire secret des \u00c9gaux'' (\"Secret Directory of Equals\"), which proposed to \"revolutionize the people\" through pamphlets and placards, and eventually to overthrow the government. He formed an alliance of utopian socialists and radical Jacobins, including [[F\u00e9lix Lepeletier]], [[Pierre-Antoine Antonelle]], [[Sylvain Marechal]], [[Jean-Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Amar]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Robert Lindet]]. The [[Conspiracy of Equals]] was organized in a novel way: in the center was Babeuf and the Secret Directory, who hid their identities, and shared information with other members of the Conspiracy only via trusted intermediaries. This conspiratorial structure was later adopted by Marxist movements. Despite his precautions, the Directory infiltrated an agent into the conspiracy, and was fully informed of what he was doing.<ref>R. B. Rose, ''Gracchus Babeuf: The First Revolutionary Communist'' (Stanford University Press, 1978)</ref> Bonaparte, the newly named commander of the [[Army of the Interior]], was ordered to close the [[Panth\u00e9on Club]], the major meeting place for the Jacobins in Paris, which he did on 27 February 1796. The Directory took other measures to prevent an uprising; the Legion of Police (''l\u00e9gion de police''), a local police force dominated by Jacobins, was forced to become a part of the Army, and the Army organized a mobile column to patrol the neighborhoods and stop uprisings.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=192\u2013194}}\n\nBefore Babeuf and his conspiracy could strike, he was betrayed by a police spy and arrested in his hiding place on 10 May 1796. Though he was a talented agitator, he was a very poor conspirator; with him in his hiding place were the complete records of the conspiracy, with all of the names of the conspirators. Despite this setback, the conspiracy went ahead with its plans. On the night of 9\u201310 September 1796, between 400 and 700 Jacobins went to the 21st Regiment of Dragoons (''21e r\u00e9giment de dragons'') army camp at [[Grenelle]] and tried to incite an armed rebellion against the Convention. At the same time a column of militants was formed in the working-class neighborhoods of Paris to march on the Luxembourg Palace, headquarters of the Directory. Director Carnot had been informed the night before by the commander of the camp, and a unit of dragoons was ready. When the attack began at about ten o'clock, the dragoons appeared suddenly and charged. About twenty Jacobins were killed, and the others arrested. The column of militants, learning what had happened, disbanded in confusion. The widespread arrest of Babeuf's militants and Jacobins followed. The practice of arresting suspects at their homes at night, stopped after the downfall of Robespierre, was resumed on this occasion.\n\nDespite his arrest, Babeuf, in jail, still felt he could negotiate with the government. He wrote to the Directory: \"Citizen Directors, why don't you look above yourselves and treat with me as with an equal power? You have seen now the vast confidence of which I am the center... this view makes you tremble.\"{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|page=199}} Several attempts were made by Babeuf's followers to free him from prison. He was finally moved to [[Vend\u00f4me]] for trial. The Directory did not tremble. The accused Jacobins were tried by military courts between 19 September and 27 October. Thirty Jacobins, including three former deputies of the Convention, were convicted and guillotined. Babeuf and his principal followers were tried in Vend\u00f4me between 20 February and 26 May 1797. The two principal leaders, Babeuf and [[Augustin Alexandre Darth\u00e9|Darth\u00e9]], were convicted. They both attempted suicide, but failed and were guillotined on 27 May 1797. However, in the following months, the Directory and Councils gradually turned away from the royalist right and tried to find new allies on the left.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|page=199}}<ref>Doyle, ''Oxford History,''pp 324\u201326</ref><ref>George Rude, ''The French Revolution: Its Causes, Its History and Its Legacy After 200 Years'' (1991) p 122</ref>\n\n=== War and Diplomacy (1796\u20131797) ===\nThe major preoccupation of the Directory during its existence was the war against the coalition of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Austria]]. The military objective set by the Convention in October 1795 was to enlarge France to what were declared its natural limits: the [[Pyrenees]], the [[Rhine]] and the [[Alps]], the borders of [[Gaul]] at the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. In 1795, [[Prussia]], [[Spain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] quit [[the War of the First Coalition]] and the war and made peace with France, but Great Britain refused to accept the French annexation of [[Belgium]]. Beside Britain and Austria, the only enemies remaining for France were the kingdom of [[Sardinia]] and several small Italian states. Austria proposed a European congress to settle borders, but the Directory refused, demanding direct negotiations with Austria instead. Under British pressure, Austria agreed to continue the war against France.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=223}}\n\n[[Lazare Carnot]], the Director who oversaw military affairs, planned a new campaign against Austria, using three armies: General [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan's]] [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]] on the Rhine and General [[Jean Victor Moreau|Moreau]]'s [[Army of the Rhine and Moselle]] on the Danube would march to [[Vienna]] and dictate a peace. A third army, the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]] under General Bonaparte, who had risen in rank with spectacular speed due to his defense of the government from a royalist uprising, would carry out a diversionary operation against Austria in northern Italy. Jourdan's army captured [[Mayence]] and [[Frankfurt]], but on 14 August 1796 was defeated by the Austrians at the [[Battle of Amberg]] and again on 3 September 1796 at the [[Battle of W\u00fcrzburg]], and had to retreat back to the Rhine. General Moreau, without the support of Jourdan, was also forced to retreat.\n\n==== Italian campaign ====\n[[File:La Bataille du Pont d'Arcole.jpg|thumb|Bonaparte won his first major victory leading his soldiers across a bridge at the [[Battle of Arcole]] (17 November 1796)]]\n[[File:Napoleon at the Battle of Rivoli.jpg|thumb|Bonaparte defeats the Austrians at the [[Battle of Rivoli]] (14 January 1797)]]\n[[File:Irish-Invasion-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|A British cartoon showed the failure of the French military expedition to Ireland dispersed by storms at sea in 1797]]\nThe story was much different in Italy. Bonaparte, though he was only twenty-eight years old, was named commander of the Army of Italy on 2 March 1796, through the influence of Barras, his patron in the Directory. Bonaparte faced the combined armies of Austria and Sardinia, which numbered seventy thousand men. Bonaparte slipped his army between them and defeated them in a series of battles, culminating at the [[Battle of Mondovi]] where he defeated the Sardinians on 22 April 1796, and the [[Battle of Lodi]], where he defeated the Austrians on 10 May. The [[Victor Amadeus III of Savoy|king of Sardinia and Savoy]] was forced to make peace in May 1796 and ceded [[Nice]] and [[Savoy]] to France.\n\nAt the end of 1796, Austria sent two new armies to Italy to expel Bonaparte, but Bonaparte outmaneuvered them both, winning a first victory at the [[Battle of Arcole]] on 17 November 1796, then at the [[Battle of Rivoli]] on 14 January 1797. He forced Austria to sign the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] (October 1797), whereby [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|the emperor]] ceded [[Lombardy]] and the [[Austrian Netherlands]] to the French Republic in exchange for [[Venice]] and urged [[Diet of the Holy Roman Empire|the Diet]] to surrender the lands beyond the Rhine.<ref name=Black173>Black, p. 173.</ref>\n\n==== Spanish alliance ====\nThe Directory was eager to form a coalition with Spain to block British commerce with the continent and to close the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to British ships. By the [[Second Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]], concluded in August 1796, Spain became the ally of France, and on 5 October, it declared war on Britain. The British fleet under Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Jervis]] defeated the Spanish fleet at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1797)|Cape St Vincent]], keeping the Mediterranean open to British ships, but the United Kingdom was brought into such extreme peril by the mutinies in its fleet that it offered to acknowledge the French conquest of the Netherlands and to restore the French colonies.\n\n==== Irish Misadventure ====\nThe Directory also sought a new way to strike British interests and to repay the 1707-1800 [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] for the support it gave to royalist insurgents in [[Brittany]], [[France]]. A French fleet of 44 vessels departed [[Brest, France|Brest]] on 15 December 1796, carrying an expeditionary force of 14,000 soldiers, led by General Hoche to [[Ireland]], where they hoped to join forces with Irish rebels to expel the British from the 1542-1800 [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. However, the fleet was separated by storms off the Irish coast and, being unable to land on Ireland, had to return to home port with 31 vessels and 12,000 surviving soldiers.\n\n=== Rise of the royalists and coup d'\u00e8tat (1797) ===\n{{main|Coup of 18 Fructidor}}\nThe first elections held after the formation of the Directory were held in March and April 1797, in order to replace one-third of the members of the Councils. The elections were a crushing defeat for the old members of the Convention; 205 of the 216 were defeated. Only eleven former deputies from the Convention were reelected, several of whom were royalists.{{sfn|Soboul|1975|p=505}} The elections were a triumph for the royalists, particularly in the south and in the west; after the elections there were about 160 royalist deputies, divided between those who favored a return to an absolute monarchy, and those who wished a constitutional monarchy on the British model. The constitutional monarchists elected to the Council included [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours]], who later emigrated to the United States with his family, and whose son, [[\u00c9leuth\u00e8re Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e du Pont]], founded the \"E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company\", now known as [[DuPont]]. In Paris and other large cities, the candidates of the left dominated. General [[Jean-Charles Pichegru]], a former Jacobin and ordinary soldier who had become one of the most successful generals of the Revolution, was elected president of the new Council of Five Hundred. [[Fran\u00e7ois Barb\u00e9-Marbois]], a diplomat and future negotiator of the sale of [[Louisiana]] to the United States, was elected president of the Council of Ancients.\n\n[[File:Pichegru.jpg|thumb|left|General [[Jean-Charles Pichegru]], president of the Council of Five Hundred, was accused of being a secret royalist]]\nRoyalism was not strictly legal, and deputies could not announce themselves as such, but royalist newspapers and pamphlets soon appeared, there were pro-monarchy demonstrations in theaters, and royalists wore identifying clothing items, such as black velvet collars, in show of mourning for the execution of Louis XVI. The parliamentary royalists demanded changes in the government fiscal policies, and a more tolerant position toward religion. During the Convention, churches had been closed and priests required to take an [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|oath to the government]]. Priests who had refused to take the oath were expelled from the country, on pain of the death penalty if they returned. Under the Directory, many priests had quietly returned, and many churches around the country had re-opened and were discreetly holding services. When the Directory proposed moving the ashes of the celebrated mathematician and philosopher [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] to the ''[[Panth\u00e9on]]'', one deputy, [[Louis-S\u00e9bastien Mercier]], a former [[Girondin]] and opponent of the Jacobins, protested that the ideas of Descartes had inspired the [[Reign of Terror]] of the Revolution and destroyed religion in France. Descartes' ashes were not moved.{{Sfn|Lefebre|1977|page=212}} ''\u00c9migr\u00e9s'' who had left during the Revolution had been threatened by the Convention with the death penalty if they returned; now, under the Directory, they quietly began to return.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=181}}\n\n[[File:Charles Pierre Francois Augereau.jpg|thumb|General [[Pierre Augereau]], a close ally of Bonaparte, led the army that arrested the royalist leaders of the legislature (4 September 1797)]]\n[[File:Augereau Coup d etat 18 Fructidor in Tuileries.jpg|thumb|The army arrests General Pichegru at the Tuileries Palace (4 September 1797)]]\nParallel with the parliamentary royalists, but not directly connected with them, a clandestine network of royalists existed, whose objective was to place [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], then in exile in [[Germany]], on the French throne. They were funded largely by Britain, through the offices of [[William Wickham (1761\u20131840)|William Wickham]], the British spymaster who had his headquarters in [[Switzerland]]. These networks were too divided and too closely watched by the police to have much effect on politics. However, Wickham did make one contact that proved to have a decisive effect on French politics: through an intermediary, he had held negotiations with General Pichegru, then commander of the Army of the Rhine.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=217}}\n\nThe Directory itself was divided. [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]], [[Letourneur]] and [[Louis Marie de La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux|La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re L\u00e9peaux]] were not royalists, but favored a more moderate government, more tolerant of religion. Though Carnot himself had been a member of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] led by Robespierre, he declared that the Jacobins were ungovernable, that the Revolution could not go on forever, and that it was time to end it. A new member, [[Fran\u00e7ois-Marie, marquis de Barth\u00e9lemy]], a diplomat, had joined the Directory; he was allied with Carnot. The royalists in the Councils immediately began to demand more power over the government and particularly over the finances, threatening the position of Barras.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=218\u2013219}}\n\nBarras, the consummate intriguer, won La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re L\u00e9peaux over to his side, and began planning the downfall of the royalists. From letters taken from a captured royalist agent, he was aware of the contacts that General Pichegru made with the British and that he had been in contact with the exiled Louis XVIII. He presented this information to Carnot, and Carnot agreed to support his action against the Councils. General [[Lazare Hoche|Hoche]], the new Minister of War, was directed to march the [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]] through Paris on its way to Brest, on the pretext that they would be embarked for a new expedition to Ireland. Hoche himself resigned as Minister of War on 22 July. General [[Pierre Augereau]], a close subordinate and ally of Bonaparte, and his troops arrived in Paris on 7 August, though it was a violation of the Constitution for soldiers to be within twelve leagues of the city without permission of the Councils. The royalist members of the Councils protested, but could do nothing to send them away.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=392}}\n\nOn 4 September 1797, with the army in place, the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor|''Coup d'\u00e9tat'' of 18 Fructidor, Year V]] was set in motion. General Augereau's soldiers arrested Pichegru, Barth\u00e9lemy, and the leading royalist deputies of the Councils. The next day, the Directory annulled the elections of about two hundred deputies in 53 departments.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=393}} Sixty-five deputies were deported to [[Guiana]], 42 royalist newspapers were closed, and 65 journalists and editors were deported. Carnot and Barth\u00e9lemy were removed from the Directory. Carnot went into exile in Switzerland; he later returned and became, for a time, Bonaparte's minister of war. [[Fran\u00e7ois-Marie, marquis de Barth\u00e9lemy|Barth\u00e9lemy]] and Pichegru both were sent to exile in [[French Guiana]] (penal colony of Cayenne). In June 1798, they both escaped, and went first to the United States and then to England. During the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], Pichegru returned secretly to Paris, where he was captured on 28 February 1804. He died in prison on 6 April 1804, either strangled or having committed suicide.\n\n=== Second Directory and resurgence of the Jacobins ===\nThe coup was followed by a scattering of uprisings by royalists in [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[Tarascon]] and other towns, particularly in the southwest and west. A commissioner of the Directory was assassinated in [[Lyon]], and on 22 October counter-revolutionaries seized the city government of [[Carpentras]] for twenty-four hours. These brief uprisings served only to justify a wave of repression from the new government.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=439\u2013440}}\n\nWith Carnot and Barth\u00e9lemy gone from the Directory, and the royalists expelled from the Councils, the Jacobins were once again in control of the government. The two vacant places in the Directory were filled by [[Philippe Antoine, comte Merlin|Merlin de Douai]], a lawyer who had helped write the [[Law of Suspects]] during the Reign of Terror; and [[Fran\u00e7ois de Neufch\u00e2teau]], a poet and expert in industry inland navigation, who served only a few months. Eight of the twelve Directors and ministers of the new government were regicides, who as deputies of the Convention had voted for the execution of Louis XVI, and were now determined to continue the Revolution.<ref>Albert Soboul, ''The French Revolution'' (1975) p 508</ref> {{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=1030}}\n\nThe central administration and city governments were quickly purged of suspected royalists. The next target was the wave of noble ''\u00e9migr\u00e9s'' and priests who had begun to return to France. The Jacobins in the Councils demanded that the law of 1793 be enforced; ''\u00e9migr\u00e9s'' were ordered to leave France within fifteen days. If they did not, they were to be judged by a military commission, and, on simple proof of their identity, were to be executed within twenty-four hours. Military commissions were established throughout the country to judge not only returning ''\u00e9migr\u00e9s'', but also rebels and conspirators. Between 4 September 1797 and the end of the Directory in 1799, 160 persons were condemned to death by the military tribunals, including 41 priests and several women. {{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=441\u2013442}}\n\nOn 16 October 1797, the Council of Five Hundred considered a new law which banned political activities by nobles, who were to be considered as foreigners, and had to apply for naturalization in order to take part in politics. A certain number, listed by names, were to be banned permanently from political activity, were to have their property confiscated, and were to be required to leave immediately. The law called for certain exemptions for those in the government and military (Director Barras and General Bonaparte were both from minor noble families). In the end, resistance to the law was so great that it was not adopted.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=452\u2013453}}\n\nThe Jacobin-dominated councils also demanded the deportation of priests who refused to take an oath to the government, and an oath declaring their hatred of royalty and anarchy. 267 priests were deported to the French penal colony of Cayenne in French Guiana, of whom 111 survived and returned to France. 920 were sent to a prison colony on the [[\u00cele de R\u00e9]], and 120, a large part of them Belgians, to another colony on the [[Ol\u00e9ron|\u00cele d'Ol\u00e9ron]].{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|page 445}}  <ref>See: ''Seuls les morts ne reviennent jamais : les pionniers de la guillotine s\u00e8che en Guyane fran\u00e7aise'', Philippe de Ladebat, ed. Amalth\u00e9e, France, 2008 \u2013 http://site.voila.fr/fructidor/page1.html</ref> The new government continued the anti-religious policy of the Convention. Several churches, including the cathedral [[Notre Dame de Paris]] and the church of [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]], were converted [[Theophilanthropic]] temples, a new religion based on the belief in the existence of God and the immortality of the human spirit. Religious observations were forbidden on Sunday; they were allowed only on the last day of the 10-day week (''d\u00e9cade'') of the [[French Republican Calendar]].{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=231}} Other churches remained closed, and were forbidden to ring their bells, although many religious services took place in secret in private homes. The National Guard was mobilized  to search rural areas and forests for priests and nobles in hiding. As during the Reign of Terror, lists were prepared of suspects, who would be arrested in the event of attempted uprisings. {{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=441\u2013442}}\n\nThe new Jacobin-dominated Directory and government also targeted the press. Newspaper publishers were required to submit copies of their publications to the police for official approval. On 17 December 1797, seventeen Paris newspapers were closed by order of the Directory. The Directory also imposed a substantial tax on all newspapers or magazines distributed by mail, although Jacobin publications, as well as scientific and art publications, were excluded. Books critical of the Jacobins were censored; [[Louis-Marie Prudhomme]]'s six-volume ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et impartiale des erreurs, des fautes et des crimes commis pendant la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise''<ref>''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et impartiale des erreurs, des fautes et des crimes commis pendant la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', Faubourg Saint-Germain, Paris, 1797, (Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France)[http://gallica.bnf.fr/services/engine/search/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&version=1.2&collapsing=disabled&query=%28gallica%20all%20%22Histoire%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20et%20impartiale%20des%20erreurs%2C%20des%20fautes%20et%20des%20crimes%20commis%20pendant%20la%20R%C3%A9volution%20fran%C3%A7aise%22%29%20and%20dc.relation%20all%20%22cb37250832j%22]</ref> (\"General and impartial history of the errors, faults and crimes committed during the French Revolution\") was seized by the police. The Directory also authorized the opening and reading of letters coming from outside of France.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|page=452}}\n  \nDespite all these security measures, there was a great increase in brigandage and robbery in the French countryside; travelers were frequently stopped on roads and robbed; the robberies were often blamed on royalist bands. On 18 January 1798, the Councils passed a new law against highwaymen and bandits, calling for them to be tried by military tribunals, and authorizing the death penalty for robbery or attempted robbery on the roads of France.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=449\u201350}}\n\nThe political repression and terror under the Directory were real, but they were on a much smaller scale than the Reign of Terror under Robespierre and the Convention, and the numbers of those repressed declined during the course of the Directory. After 1798, no further political prisoners were sent to French Guiana, and, in the final year of the Directory, only one person was executed for a political offense.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|page=455}}\n\n=== Elections of 1798 ===\nIn the spring of 1798, not only a new third of the legislature had to be chosen, but the places of the members expelled by the revolution of {{lang|fr|Fructidor}} had to be filled. 437 seats were open, out of 750. The elections took place between 9 and 18 April. The royalists had been disqualified, and the moderates were in disarray, while  the radical Jacobins made a strong showing. Before the new deputies could take their seats, Barras and the other Directors, more moderate than the new Jacobins, organized a commission to review the elections, and disqualified many of the more extreme Jacobin candidates, replacing them with moderates. They sent the list of candidates for Director to the Councils, excluding any radicals. Fran\u00e7ois de Neufch\u00e5teau was chosen by a drawing of lots to leave the Directory and Barras proposed only moderate Jacobins to replace him: the choice fell on [[Jean-Baptiste Treilhard]], a lawyer. These political maneuvers secured the power of the Directory, but widened further the gap between the moderate Directory and the radical Jacobin majority in the Councils.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=232\u2013233}}\n\n=== War and diplomacy (1798) ===\nOn 17 October 1797, General Bonaparte and the Austrians signed the [[Treaty of Campoformio]]. It was a triumph for France. France received the left bank of the [[Rhine]] as far south of [[Cologne]], [[History of Belgium|Belgium]], and the islands in the [[Ionian Sea]] that had belonged to [[Venice]]. Austria in compensation was given the territories of Venice up to the [[Aegean Sea]]. In late November and December, he took part in negotiations with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and Austria, at the [[Second Congress of Rastatt]], to redraw the borders of Germany. He was then summoned back to Paris to take charge of an even more ambitious project, the invasion of Britain, which had been proposed by Director Carnot and General Hoche. But an eight-day inspection of the ports where the invasion fleet was being prepared convinced Bonaparte that the invasion had little chance of success: the ships were in poor condition, the crews poorly trained, and funds and logistics were lacking. He privately told his associate [[Marmont]] his view of the Directory: \"Nothing can be done with these people. They don't understand anything of greatness. We need to go back to our projects for the East. It is only there that great results can be achieved.\"{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=243\u2013244}} The invasion of England was cancelled, and a less ambitious plan to support an Irish uprising was proposed instead (see below).\n\n==== Sister Republics ====\n{{main|Sister republic}}\nThe grand plan of the Directory in 1798, with the assistance of its armies, was the creation of \"Sister Republics\" in Europe which would share the same revolutionary values and same goals, and would be natural allies of France. In the [[Dutch Republic]] (Republic of the Seven United Netherlands), the French army installed the [[Batavian Republic]] with the same system of a Directory and two elected Councils. In [[Milan]], the [[Cisalpine Republic]] was created, which was governed jointly by a Directory and Councils and by the French army. General [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier|Berthier]], who had replaced Bonaparte as the commander of the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]], imitated the actions of the Directory in Paris, purging the new republic's legislature of members whom he considered too radical. The [[Ligurian Republic]] was formed in [[Genoa]]. [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] was also turned by the French army into a sister republic, the [[Piedmontese Republic]]. In [[Turin]], King [[Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia|Charles-Emmanuel IV]], (whose wife, [[Marie Clotilde of France|Clotilde]] was [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s youngest sister), fled French dominance and sailed, protected by the British fleet, to [[Sardinia]]. In [[Savoy]], General [[Barth\u00e9lemy Catherine Joubert|Joubert]] did not bother to form a sister republic, he simply made the province a department of France.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=251\u2013253}}\n\nThe Directory also directly attacked the authority of [[Pope Pius VI]], who governed [[Rome]] and the [[Papal States]] surrounding it. Shortly after Christmas on 28 December 1797, anti-French riots took place in Rome, and a French Army brigadier general, [[Mathurin-L\u00e9onard Duphot|Duphot]], was assassinated. Pope Pius VI moved quickly and formally apologized to the Directory on 29 December 1797, but the Directory refused his apology. Instead, Berthier's troops entered Rome and occupied the city on 10 February 1798. Thus the [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] was also proclaimed on 10 February 1798. Pius VI was arrested and confined in the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] before being taken to France in 1799. The Vatican treasury of thirty million francs was sent to Paris, where it helped finance Bonaparte's expedition to Egypt, and five hundred cases of paintings, statues, and other art objects were sent to France and added to the collections of the [[Louvre]].{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=252}}\n\nA French army under General [[Guillaume Brune]] occupied much of Switzerland. The [[Helvetian Republic]] was proclaimed on 12 April 1798. On 26 August 1798, [[Geneva]] was detached from the new republic and made part of France. The treasury of [[Bern]] was seized, and, like the treasury of the Vatican, was used to finance Bonaparte's [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|expedition to Egypt]].\n\nThe new military campaigns required thousands of additional soldiers. The Directory approved the first permanent law of [[conscription]], which was unpopular in the countryside, and particularly in Belgium, which had formally become part of France. Riots and peasant uprisings took place in the Belgian countryside. Blaming the unrest on Belgian priests, French authorities ordered the arrest and deportation of several thousands of them.<ref>Thys, Augustin, ''La pers\u00e9cution religieuse en Belgique sous le Directoire ex\u00e9cutif, 1798\u201399'', d'apr\u00e8s des documents in\u00e9dits, Anvers, 1898, [https://archive.org/stream/laperscutionre00thys#page/n6/mode/1up] (in French)</ref>\n\n==== Bonaparte's expedition to Egypt (May 1798) ====\n{{main|French campaign in Egypt and Syria}}\nThe idea of a French military expedition to Egypt had been proposed by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]] in a memoir to the [[Institut de France|French Institute]] as early as 3 July 1797, and in a letter the following month from Talleyrand to Bonaparte. The Egyptian expedition had three objectives: to cut the shortest route from England to [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]] by occupying he [[Isthmus of Suez]]; to found a colony which could produce cotton and sugar cane, which were in short supply in France due to the British blockade; and to provide a base for a future French attack on British India. It also had several personal advantages for Bonaparte: it allowed him to keep a distance from the unpopular Directory, while at the same time staying in the public eye.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=245}}\n\n[[File:The Battle of the Nile.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Destruction of 'L'Orient' at the Battle of the Nile, 1 August 1798'', oil on canvas by George Arnald (1825-1827). Defeat at the Battle of the Nile left Bonaparte and his army stranded in Egypt. [[National Maritime Museum]], [[Greenwich]], [[England]]]]\nThe Directory itself was not enthusiastic about the idea, which would take its most successful general and his army far from Europe just at the time that a major new war was brewing. Director La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux wrote: \"The idea never came from the Directory or any of its members. The ambition and pride of Bonaparte could no longer support the idea of not being visible, and of being under the orders of the Directory.\"\n\nThe idea presented two other problems: Republican French policy was opposed to colonization, and France was not at war with the Ottoman Empire, to which Egypt belonged. Therefore, the expedition was given an additional scientific purpose: \"to enlighten the world and to obtain new treasures for science.\" A large team of prominent scientists was added to the expedition; twenty-one mathematicians, three astronomers, four architects, thirteen naturalists and an equal number of geographers, plus painters, a pianist and the poet [[Fran\u00e7ois-Auguste Parseval-Grandmaison]]{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=245-246}}\n\nOn 19 May 1798, two hundred ships carrying Bonaparte, and 35,000 men comprising the [[Order of battle of the Arm\u00e9e d'Orient (1798)|''Arm\u00e9e d'Orient'']], most of them veterans of Bonaparte's Army of Italy, sailed from [[Toulon]]. The British fleet under [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]], expecting a French expedition toward [[Constantinople]], was not in position to stop them. The French fleet stopped briefly at [[Malta]], capturing the island, the government of which offered little resistance. Bonaparte's army landed in the bay of [[Alexandria]] on 1 July, and captured that city on 2 July, with little opposition. He wrote a letter to the Pascha of Egypt, claiming that his purpose was to liberate Egypt from the tyranny of the [[Mamluk]]s. His army marched across the desert, despite extreme heat, and defeated the Mameluks at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]] on 21 July 1798. A few days later, however, on 1 August, the British fleet under Admiral Nelson arrived off the coast; the French fleet was taken by surprise and destroyed in the [[Battle of the Nile]]. Only four French ships escaped. Bonaparte and his army were prisoners in Egypt. .{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=246\u2013247}}\n\n==== Failed uprising in Ireland (August 1798) ====\n{{main|Irish Rebellion of 1798}}\nAnother attempt to support an Irish uprising was made on 7 August 1798. A French fleet sailed from [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort-sur-Mer]] (Rochefort) carrying an expeditionary force led by General [[Jean Joseph Amable Humbert]]. The attack was intended to support an [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|uprising]] of [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] led by [[Wolfe Tone]]. Tone had several meetings with Bonaparte in France to coordinate the timing, but the uprising within the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] began early and was suppressed on 14 July 1798 before the French fleet arrived. The French force landed at [[Killala]], in northwest Ireland, on 22 August. It defeated British troops in two small engagements on 24 and 27 August, and Humbert declared the formation of an Irish Republic at [[Castlebar]] on 27 August, but the French forces were defeated at the [[Battle of Ballinamuck]] on 8 September 1798 by the troops of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], [[Commander-in-Chief, Ireland|British Commander-in-chief in Ireland]]. A second part of the French expeditionary force, not knowing that the first had surrendered, left Brest on 16 September. It was intercepted by the British Navy in the bay of [[Donegal (town)|Donegal]], and six of the French warships were captured.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=398\u2013400}}\n\n==== Quasi-War with the United States (1798\u20131799) ====\n{{main|Quasi-War}}\nTensions between the United States and France developed into the [[Quasi-War]], an undeclared naval war. France complained the United States was ignoring the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|1778 Treaty of Alliance]] that had brought the French into the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The United States insisted on taking a neutral stance in the war between France and Britain. After the [[Jay Treaty]] with Britain went into effect in 1795, France began to side against the United States and by 1797 had seized over 300 American merchant ships. [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] favored Britain while [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republicans]] favored France. Federalist President [[John Adams]] built up the [[History of the United States Navy|United States Navy]], finishing three frigates, approving funds to build three more and sending diplomats to Paris to negotiate. They were insulted by Foreign Minister Talleyrand (who demanded bribes before talking). The [[XYZ Affair]] told Americans about the negotiations and angered American public opinion. The war was fought almost entirely at sea, mostly between privateers and merchant ships. In 1800, the [[Convention of 1800]] (Treaty of Mortefontaine) ended the conflict.<ref>De Conde, Alexander, ''The quasi-war: the politics and diplomacy of the undeclared war with France 1797\u20131801'', Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1966</ref>\n\n=== War and political crisis (1799) ===\n==== Second Coalition against France ====\n{{main|War of the Second Coalition}}\n[[File:Suvorovs Battle By Adda.jpg|thumb|[[Suvorov]] and a Russian-Austrian army defeat the French at the [[Battle of Cassano (1799)|Battle of Cassano]] on 27 April 1799 by [[Luigi Schiavonetti]]]]\nBritain and Austria had been alarmed by the French creation of Sister Republics. Austria first demanded that France hand over a share of the territory of the new Republics to it. When the Directory refused, Austria began searching for partners for a new military alliance against France. The new Czar of Russia, [[Paul I of Russia]], was extremely hostile to French republican ideas, sympathetic to the exiled Louis XVIII, and willing to join a new coalition against France. The Czar offered an army of 20,000 men, sent by sea to Holland on his Baltic fleet. He sent another army of 60,000 men, veterans of fighting in Poland and Turkey, under his best general, [[Alexander Suvorov]], to join the Austrian forces in northern Italy.\n\nThe King of Prussia, [[Frederick-William III]], had carefully preserved neutrality in order to profit from both sides. The Directory made the error of sending one of the most prominent revolutionaries of 1789, the Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e9s, who had voted for the death of Louis XVI, as ambassador to Berlin, where his ideas appalled the arch-conservative and ultra-monarchist king. Frederick William maintained his neutrality,  refusing to support either side, a setback for France.\n\nBy the end of 1798, the coalition could count on 300,000 soldiers, and would be able to increase the number to 600,000. The best French army, headed by Bonaparte, was stranded in Egypt. General Brune had 12,000 men in Holland; [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Bernadotte]], 10,000 men on the Rhine; Jourdan, 40,000 men in the army of the Danube; Massena, 30,000 soldiers in Switzerland; Scherer, 40,000 men on the [[Adige]] river in northern Italy; and 27,000 men under Macdonald were based in Naples: a total of 170,000 men. To try to match the coalition forces, the Directory ordered a new call up of young men between the ages of twenty and twenty five to the army, seeking to add two hundred thousand new soldiers. {{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=256}}\n\n==== Resurgence of the War in Italy and Switzerland ====\nOn 10 November 1798, the British and Austrian governments had agreed on a common goal of suppressing the five new sister republics and forcing France back into its 1789 borders. Then on 29 November 1798, on the first day of the [[War of the Second Coalition]], the [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|King of Naples]] launched an attack on Rome, which was lightly defended by French soldiers. A British fleet landed three thousand Neapolitan soldiers in Tuscany. However, the French army of General [[Jean \u00c9tienne Championnet|Championnet]] responded quickly, defeating the Neapolitan army at the [[Battle of Civita Castellana]] at [[Civita Castellana]] on 5 December. The next day, 6 December 1798, French soldiers also forced the [[King of Sardinia]] to remove his soldiers from [[Piedmont]] and to retreat to his island of [[Sardinia]], his last possession. The French army marched to the [[Kingdom of Naples]], obliging the King of Naples to leave his City of [[Naples]] on a British warship on 23 December 1798. Naples was then occupied on 23 January 1799, and a new Neapolitan republic, the so-called [[Parthenopean Republic]], the sixth under French protection, was proclaimed on 26 January.\n\nPeace negotiations with Austria went nowhere in the spring of 1799, and the Directory decided to launch a new offensive into [[Germany]], but the arrival of a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] army under Alexander Suvorov and fresh Austrian forces under the [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] for a time changed the balance of power. [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]]'s Army of the Danube crossed the Rhine on 6 March but was defeated by the Archduke Charles, first at the [[Battle of Ostrach]] and then at the [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|Battle of Stockach]] on 25 March 1799. Jourdan's army withdrew while Jourdan himself returned to Paris to plea for more soldiers.\n\nThe forces of the [[Second Coalition]] invaded French-occupied Italy, and after five earlier battles, a joint Russian-Austrian army under Suvorov's command defeated Moreau at the [[Battle of Cassano (1799)|Battle of Cassano]] on 27 April 1799 and thus occupied [[Turin]] and [[Milan]] and thereby took back the [[Cisalpine Republic]] from France. Suvorov then defeated the French Army on the Terrivva. To redress the situation, [[Barth\u00e9lemy Catherine Joubert|Joubert]] was named the new head of the Army of Italy on 5 July, but his army suffered defeat by the Russians at the [[Battle of Novi (1799)|Battle of Novi]], on 15 August;  Joubert himself was shot through the heart when the battle began, and his army was routed. The Sister Republics established by the French in Italy quickly collapsed, leaving only Genoa under French control. {{Sfn|Tulard|page=257}}\n\nIn August, the Russians and British opened a new front in the Netherlands. A British army was landed at Helder on 27 August, and was joined by a Russian army. On 31 August, the Dutch fleet, allied with France, was defeated by the Royal Navy. Seeing the French army and government in a crisis, the leaders of the royalist rebellions in the Vend\u00e9e and Brittany came together on 15 September to prepare a renewed uprising.{{Sfn|Tullard|1998|page=408}}\n\nThe surviving leaders of the royalist rebellions in the Vend\u00e9e and Brittany, which had long been dormant, saw a new opportunity for success and met to plan strategy on 15 September 1799. The royalist commander [[Louis de Frott\u00e9]], in exile in England, returned to France to command the new uprising.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=408}}\n\n==== Bonaparte's Campaign in Syria (February\u2013May 1799) ====\nWhile the French armies in Italy and Switzerland tried to preserve the Sister Republics, Bonaparte pursued his own campaign in Egypt. He explained in a letter to the Directory that Egyptian venture was just the beginning of a broader campaign \"to create a formidable diversion in the campaign of Republican France versus monarchic Europe. Egypt would be the base of something much larger than the original project, and at the same time a lever which will aid in the creation of a general uprising of the Muslim world.\"  This uprising, he believed, would lead to the collapse of British power from the Middle East to India.{{Sfn|Tulard|page=257}} With this goal in mind, he left Cairo and marched his army across the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai desert]] into Syria, where he [[Siege of Acre (1799)|laid siege]] to the port of [[Saint-Jean-d'Acre]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which was defended by a local army and supplied by a British fleet offshore. His long siege and attempts to storm the city were a failure; his army was ravaged by disease, it was down to 11,000 men, and he learned that an Ottoman army was to be embarked by the British fleet to sail to Cairo to recapture the city. On 17 May, he abandoned the siege and was back in Cairo by 4 June. The British fleet landed the Ottoman army, but as soon as they were ashore they were decisively defeated by Bonaparte at the [[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Battle of Aboukir]] on 25 July 1799.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=248\u2013249}}\n\nDue to the British blockade of Egypt, Bonaparte had received no news from France for six months. He sent one of his military aides to meet with Turkish government officials and to try to get news from France, but the officer was intercepted by the British navy. The British admiral and naval commander in the eastern Mediterranean, [[Sidney Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Sidney Smith]], who had lived in Paris and knew France well, gave the officer a packet of recent French newspapers and sent him back to Bonaparte.  Bonaparte spent the night reading the newspapers, learning about the political and military troubles in France. His orders permitted him to return home any time he chose. The next day he decided to return to France immediately. He handed over command of the army to [[Jean-Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber|General Kl\u00e9ber]] and left Egypt with a small party of senior officers aboard the frigate ''La Muiron''. He escaped the British blockade but did not reach France until 9 October.<ref>Thiers, Adolphe, ''Histoire de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', 1839 (Ninth edition), Volume 10, Chapter XIII, Project Gutenberg digital edition</ref>\n\n==== Tide turns: French successes (September 1799) ====\n[[File:SA 4941-Anno 1799. De slag bij Castricum..jpg|thumb|The French-Dutch victory over the British and Russians at the [[Battle of Castricum]], 6 October 1799, by Jan Antoon Neuhys, [[Amsterdam Museum]], [[Netherlands]]]]\nThe military position of France, which seemed disastrous during the summer, improved greatly in September. On 19 September, General Brune won a victory over the British-Russian army in the Netherlands at [[Battle of Castricum|Castricum]]. On 18 October, besieged by Brune at [[Alkmaar]], the British-Russian forces under the Duke of York agreed to withdraw. In Switzerland, a Russian Empire Army had split into two. On 25\u201326 September, the French army in Switzerland, led by [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na]], defeated one part of the Russian army under [[Alexander Korsakov|Alexander Rimsky-Korsakov]] at the [[Second Battle of Zurich]], and forced the rest of the Russian army, under Suvorov, into disastrous retreat across the Alps to 'Italy'. Suvorov was furious at the Austrians, blaming them for not supporting his troops, and he urged the Czar to withdraw his forces from the war.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=257}} \n \nThe royalist uprising in the west of France, planned to accompany the British-Russian-Austrian offensive, was also a failure. The Chouans briefly seized [[Le Mans]] on 14 October and [[Nantes]] on 19 October, but they were quickly driven out by the French Army, and the rebellion had collapsed by 29 October.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=409}}\n\n=== New economic crisis ===\nSince the beginning of the Revolution, the nation suffered from rampant inflation. By the time of the Directory, the paper money, the ''assignat'', based on the value of goods confiscated from the church and nobility, had already lost most of its value. Prices had soared, and the government could not print money fast enough to meet its expenses.  The value of the assignat had dropped drastically against the value of the livre, a coin from the old regime which contained silver. In 1790, at the beginning the Revolution, an assignat with a face value of 1000 livres could be exchanged for nine hundred real livres containing silver.  In January, 1795, The Convention decided to issue assignats worth thirty billion livres, without any additional backing by gold. By March 1795, an assignat with a value of one thousand livres could buy only eighty livres containing metal.  In February 1796, the Directory decided to abolish the assignat, and held a public ceremony to destroy the printing plates. The assignat was replaced by a new note, the ''Mandat territorial''.  But since this new paper money also lacked any substantial backing, its value also plummeted;  by February 1797 the ''Mandat'' was worth only one percent of its original value. The Directory decided to return to the use of gold or silver coins, which kept their value. One hundred livres of Mandats was exchanged for twenty sous of metallic money.  The difficulty was that the Directory had only enough gold and silver to produce three hundred million livres.   The result of the shortage of money in circulation was a drastic deflation and drop in prices, which was accompanied by a drop in investment, and a drop in wages.  It led to a drop in economic activity, and unemployment.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page-543}}\n\n=== New elections, new Directors and a growing political crisis ===\n[[File:Fabre - Lucien Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|[[Lucien Bonaparte]], 24-year-old brother of Napol\u00e9on, was elected President of the Council of Five Hundred, by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Fabre]], Museo Napoleonico, Rome]]\nNew elections to elect 315 members of the Councils were held between 21 March \u2013 9 April 1799.  The royalists had been discredited and were gone; the major winners were the neo-Jacobins, who wanted to continue and strengthen the Revolution.  The new members of the Council included [[Lucien Bonaparte]], the younger brother of Napoleon, just twenty-four years old. On the strength of his name, he was elected the President of the Council of Five Hundred.\n\nThis time the Directors did not try to disqualify the Jacobins but looked for other ways to keep control of the government. It was time to elect a new member of the Directory, as Rewbell had been designated by the drawing of lots to step down. Under the Constitution, the selection of a new member of the Directory was voted by the old members of the Councils, not the newly elected ones. The candidate selected to replace him was the Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e9s, one of the major leaders of the revolution in 1789, who had been serving as Ambassador to Berlin. Siey\u00e9s had his own project in mind: He had devised a new doctrine that the power of government should be limited in order to protect the rights of the citizens. His idea was to adopt a new Constitution with a supreme court, on the American model, to protect individual rights. He privately saw his primary mission as preventing a return of Reign of Terror of 1793, a new constitution, and bringing the Revolution to a close as soon as possible, by whatever means. {{Sfn|Lefebre|1977|page=719}}\n\nOnce the elections were complete, the Jacobin majority immediately demanded that the Directory be made more revolutionary. The Councils began meeting on 20 May, and on 5 June they began their offensive to turn the Directors to the left. They declared the election of the Director Treilhard illegal on technical grounds and voted to replace him with [[Louis-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Gohier]], a lawyer who had been Minister of Justice during the Convention, and who had overseen the arrest of the moderate Girondin deputies. The Jacobins in the Council then went a step further and demanded the resignation of two moderate Directors, La Revelliere and Merlin. They were replaced by two new members, [[Roger Ducos]], a little-known lawyer who had been a member of the Committee of Public Safety, and was an ally of Barras, and an obscure Jacobin general, [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois-Auguste Moulin]]. The new Ministers named by the Directors were for the most part reliable Jacobins, though Siey\u00e9s arranged the appointment of one of his allies, [[Joseph Fouch\u00e9]], as the new Minister of Police. {{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=241}}\n\nThe Jacobin members immediately began proposing laws that were largely favorable to the sans-culottes and working class, but which alarmed the upper and middle classes. The Councils imposed a forced loan of one hundred million francs, to be paid immediately according to a graduated scale by all who paid a property tax of over three hundred francs. Those who did not pay would be classified the same as \u00e9migr\u00e9 nobles and would lose all civil rights. The Councils also passed a new law that called for making hostages of the fathers, mothers and grandparents of emigre nobles whose children had emigrated or were serving in rebel bands or armies. These hostages were subject to large fines or deportation in the event of assassinations or property damage caused by royalist soldiers or bandits.{{Sfn|Sefebre|1977|page=719}} On June 27 General Jourdan, a prominent Jacobin member of the Councils, proposed a mass draft of all eligible young men between twenty and twenty-five to raise two hundred thousand new soldiers for the army. This would be the first draft since 1793.\n\nThe new Jacobins opened a new political club, the Club du Manege, on the model of Jacobin clubs of the Convention. It opened on 6 July and soon had three thousand members, with 250 deputies, including many alumni of the Jacobins during the Reign of Terror, as well as former supporters of the ultra-revolutionary Fran\u00e7ois Babeuf. One prominent member, General Jourdan, greeted the members at the club's banquet of July 14 with the toast, \"to a return of the pikes'\", referring to the weapons used by the sans-culottes to parade the heads of executed nobles. The club members also were not afraid to attack the Directory itself, complaining of its lavish furnishings and the luxurious coaches used by Directory members. The Directory soon responded to the provocations; Siey\u00e9s denounced the club members as a return of Robespierre's reign of terror. The Minister of Police, Fouch\u00e9, closed the Club on 13 August.{{Sfn|Lefebre|1977|page=684}}\n\n=== Bonaparte returns to France, coup d'\u00e8tat and the end of the Directory ===\n==== Preparing the coup d'\u00e8tat ====\n{{main|18 Brumaire}}\n[[File:Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s - crop.jpg|thumb|[[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s]] first proposed the coup d'\u00e9tat, but he was left out of the final resulting government]]\n[[File:Joseph Fouch\u00e9.png|thumb|[[Joseph Fouch\u00e9]], Minister of Police, assured that the police would not interfere in Bonaparte's seizure of power]]\nThe rule that Directors must to be at least forty years old became one justification for the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]]: the coup d'\u00e9tat took place on 9 November 1799, when Bonaparte was thirty years old.{{Sfn|Tulard, Fayard and Fierro|1998|pages=704\u2013705}} Bonaparte returned to France, landing at the fishing village of [[Saint-Rapha\u00ebl, Var|Saint-Rapha\u00ebl]] on 9 October 1799, and made a triumphal progression northward to Paris. His victory over the Ottoman Turks at the [[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Battle of Aboukir]] had been widely reported, and overshadowed the other French victories at the [[Second Battle of Zurich]] and the [[Battle of Bergen (1799)|Battle of Bergen]]. Between [[Avignon]] and Paris, he was welcomed by large, enthusiastic crowds, who saw him as a saviour of the Republic from foreign enemies and the corruption of the Directory. Upon his arrival in Paris he was elected to the [[Institut de France]] for the scientific accomplishments of his expedition to Egypt. He was welcomed by royalists because he was from a minor noble family in [[Corsica]], and by the Jacobins because he had suppressed the attempted royalist ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' at the beginning of the Directory. His brother Lucien, though only twenty-four years old, became a prominent figure in the Council of Five Hundred because of his name.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=260-261}}\n\nBonaparte's first ambition was to be appointed to the Directory, but he was not yet forty years old, the minimum age set by the Constitution, and the Director [[Louis-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Gohier|Gohier]], a strict legalist, blocked that avenue. His earliest ally had been the Director Barras, but he disliked Barras because his wife Jos\u00e9phine had been his mistress before she married Bonaparte, and because of charges of corruption that surrounded Barras and his allies. Bonaparte wrote later that the Jacobin director, General [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois-Auguste Moulin|Moulin]], approached Bonaparte and suggested that he lead a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'', but he declined; he wished to end the Revolution, not continue it.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|page=723}} Siey\u00e9s, who had been looking for a war hero and general to assist in a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'', had originally in mind General [[Barth\u00e9lemy Catherine Joubert|Joubert]], but Joubert had been killed at the [[Battle of Novi]] in August 1799. He then approached General [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]], but Moreau was not interested. The first meeting between Siey\u00e9s and Bonaparte, on 23 October 1799, went badly; the two men each had enormous egos and instantly disliked each other. Nonetheless, they had a strong common interest and, on 6 November 1799, they formalized their plan.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=260-261}}\n\nThe ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' was carefully planned by Siey\u00e8s and Bonaparte, with the assistance of Bonaparte's brother Lucien, the diplomat and consummate intriguer [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]], the Minister of Police [[Joseph Fouch\u00e9|Fouch\u00e9]], and the Commissioner of the Directory, Pierre Fran\u00e7ois R\u00e9al. The plan called for three Directors to suddenly resign, leaving the country without an Executive. The Councils would then be told that a Jacobin conspiracy threatened the Nation; the Councils would be moved for their own security to the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Cloud]], some {{convert|5|km}} west of Paris, safe from the mobs of the French capital. Bonaparte would be named head of government to defend the Republic against the conspiracy; the Councils would be dissolved, and a new Constitution would be written. If the coup went well, it was simply a parliamentary maneuver; it would be perfectly legal. Bonaparte would provide security and take the part of convincing the Deputies. Fouch\u00e9 and R\u00e9al would assure that there would be no interference from the police or the city of Paris. Fouch\u00e9 proposed that the leading Jacobin deputies be arrested at the start of the coup, but Bonaparte said it would not be necessary, which later proved to be an error.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=261\u2013263}}  Shortly before the coup, Bonaparte met with the principal army commanders: Jourdan, Bernadotte, Augereau and Moreau, and informed them of the impending coup. They did not all support it, but agreed not to stand in his way. The president of the Council of Ancients was also brought into the coup, so he could play his part, and Bonaparte's brother Lucien would manage the Council of Five Hundred. On the evening of 6 November, the Councils held a banquet at the former church of Saint-Sulpice. Bonaparte attended, but seemed cold and distracted, and departed early. {{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=723\u2013724}}\n\n==== Coup d'\u00e9tat is launched (9\u201310 November)====\n[[File:Bouchot - Le general Bonaparte au Conseil des Cinq-Cents.jpg|thumb|Bonaparte confronts the members of the Council of Five Hundred on 10 November 1799]]\nEarly in the morning of 9 November, army units began taking positions in Paris, and the members of the Council of Ancients were awakened and instructed to come to the Tuileries Palace for an emergency meeting. When they gathered at seven-thirty, they were told that a Jacobin conspiracy to overthrow the government had been discovered and that they should transfer their meeting the next day to the ''Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Cloud'', where they would be in safety. The members were asked to approve a decree to move the meeting site, and to appoint Bonaparte as commander of troops in Paris to assure their security.  Alarmed, they quickly approved the decree. Bonaparte himself appeared with his staff and told them, \"Citizen representatives, the Republic was about to perish. You learned of it and your decree has just saved it\".{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=263}} At eleven in the morning, the members of the Council of Five Hundred met at the [[Palais Bourbon]] and were given the same message. They agreed to move their meeting the following day to Saint-Cloud.\n\nAs planned, by the afternoon Siey\u00e9s and [[Roger Ducos]] had given their resignations. Talleyrand was assigned to win the resignation of Barras. Talleyrand was supplied with a large amount of money to offer Barras to quit; historians differ on whether he gave the money to Barras or kept it for himself. Barras, seeing the movements of soldiers outside and being assured that he could keep the great wealth he had acquired as a Director, readily agreed to leave the Directory. With three members gone, the Directory could not legally meet. The Jacobin directors Moulin and Gohier were arrested and confined to the [[Luxembourg Palace]] under the guard of General Moreau. The first day of the coup had gone exactly as planned.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=263}}\n\n[[File:Gros - First Consul Bonaparte (Detail).png|thumb|left|Bonaparte as the new First Consul, by [[Antoine-Jean Gros]], c. 1802, [[Mus\u00e9e de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur]], Paris]]\nOn 10 November, the members of both councils were taken in a procession of carriages with a strong military escort to Saint-Cloud. 6,000 soldiers had already been assembled at the ch\u00e2teau; because their pay had repeatedly been delayed, they were particularly hostile to the members of the Chambers. Bonaparte spoke first to the Council of the Ancients, assembled in the [[Orangery|''Orangerie'']] of the domain of Saint-Cloud, and explained that the Directory was no more. Bonaparte was received coldly, but the Council did not offer any opposition. He then moved to the Council of Five Hundred, which was already meeting under the presidency of his brother Lucien. Here he received a far more hostile reception from the Jacobin deputies. He was questioned, jeered, insulted, shouted down, and jostled. His brother was unable to restore calm, and some of the Jacobin deputies began to demand that Bonaparte be declared outside the law, as Robespierre had been. If the Council voted him outside the law, Bonaparte could be arrested and executed immediately without trial. While the deputies raged and argued, Bonaparte and his brother, escorted by a handful of soldiers, left the ''Orangerie'', approached the unit of [[grenadier]]s of General Murat waiting impatiently outside, and told them that the deputies had tried to assassinate Bonaparte with their pens. The grenadiers charged into the hall and quickly emptied it of deputies.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=263}}\n\nBonaparte wrote his own official version of what happened, which was published in all newspapers and posted on placards on walls all over France; it vividly described how he had narrowly escaped death from the hands of \"twenty Jacobin assassins\" and concluded: \"The majority returned freely and peacefully to the meeting hall, listened to the propositions which had been made for assuring the public safety, deliberated and prepared a beneficial resolution which should become the new law and basis of the Republic.\"{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|pages=264\u2013265}}\n\nWith that event, the Directory was finished. A new government, the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], was founded. According to most historians, the [[French Revolution]] was over.\n\n== French society during the Directory ==\nDespite wars and social turmoil, the population of France continued to grow during the Directory. It was 27,800,000 in 1796, before the Directory, and had grown to 27,900,000 by 1801. Annual population growth had dropped from 16 percent in 1785, before the Revolution, to zero in 1790; but it then rebounded to 36 percent in 1795, then down to 12 percent in 1800. Part of the drop in birthrate during the Directory is attributed to the simplification of divorce, and the change in inheritance laws, which granted equal shares to all descendants. The number of young men killed in the wars during the Directory numbered 235,000 between 1795 and 1799. The high birth rate before the Revolution \u2013 together with conscription from conquered and allied states<ref>Brun, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois in: Revue historique des arm\u00e9es: Les unit\u00e9s \u00e9trang\u00e8res dans les arm\u00e9es napol\u00e9oniennes: un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la strat\u00e9gie globale du Grand Empire [http://rha.revues.org/6752]</ref> \u2013 allowed Napoleon to fill the ranks of his ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' during the [[First French Empire|Empire]] between 1804 and 1815.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=272}}\n\nBy the time of the Directory, French society had been dramatically restructured. Nobles and clergy, the two classes which had held most of the power before the Revolution, had disappeared. An estimated one percent of the population, mostly nobles and priests, but also many members of the upper middle class who had supported the [[Kingdom of France|monarchy]], had emigrated. The number was even higher in border regions, such as [[Bas-Rhin]], where 4.5 percent of the population had left.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=272}}\n\n=== Rich and poor ===\n[[File:Boilly-Point-de-Convention-ca1797.jpg|thumb|Dress of upper-class Parisians in 1797 by [[Louis-L\u00e9opold Boilly]]]]\nUnder the Directory the middle and upper classes took a dominant position in Paris society, replacing the nobility. Enormous fortunes were made, often by providing supplies to the army or by speculation on real estate. Some parts of the middle and upper classes suffered: the abolition of the old professional guilds of lawyers and doctors brought the ruin of many members, who faced competition from anyone who wanted to use those titles. The merchants and shipowners in Bordeaux, Nantes, Marseille and other ports were ruined by the British naval blockade. Bankers took on a more prominent role, when investment was scarce.\n\nTwo new groups gained importance during the Directory. The number of government officials of all levels increased dramatically. The writer [[Louis-S\u00e9bastien Mercier]] in his ''Paris pendant la R\u00e9volution (1789\u20131798), ou Le nouveau Paris'', published in 1800, wrote: \"There is no one who has not complained of the insolence, or the ignorance, of the multitude of government officials employed in the bureaus to sharpen their pens and to obstruct the course of affairs. New has the bureaucracy been carried to a point so so exaggerated, so costly, to exhausting.\"{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=276}}\n\nGenerals and other military officers also grew greatly in importance during the Directory and became a caste independent of the political structure. The Directory had abolished the Jacobin system of political commissioners who supervised and could overrule the military commanders. Generals like Bonaparte in Italy, Hoche in Germany and Pichegru in Alsace directed entire provinces according to their own ideas and wishes, with little interference from Paris. The soldiers of these generals were often more loyal to their generals than to the Directory, as the soldiers of Bonaparte showed during the 1799 coup d'\u00e9tat that ended the Directory.{{Sfn|Tulard|1998|page=277}}\n\nThe working class and poor in Paris and other large cities suffered particularly from the high inflation during the first part of the Directory, which brought higher prices for bread, meat, wine, firewood and other basic commodities. In the last two years of the Directory, the problem was the opposite: with the suppression of the ''assignats'', the money became scarce, the economy slowed, and unemployment grew.    The Directory distributed scarce food items, such as cooking oil, butter and eggs, to government employees and to members of the Councils. Before the Revolution, taking care of the poor had been the responsibility of the Church. During the Directory, the government, particularly in Paris and other large cities, was forced to take over this role. To feed the Parisians and prevent food riots, the government bought flour in the countryside at market prices with its silver coins, then gave it to the bakeries, which sold it at the traditional market price of four sous a pound, which was virtually nothing. The subsidies were reduced in the last years of the Directory, paying only for bread, but they were an enormous expense for the Directory. At the beginning, the government tried to provide the standard minimum of one pound of bread a day per person, but the shortage of money reduced the daily ration to sixty grams of bread a day. The government also tried giving rice as a substitute for bread, but the poor lacked firewood to cook it.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=173\u2013174}}\n\n=== Crime and corruption ===\nEconomic problems led to a large increase in crime under The Directory, particularly in the countryside. Bands of the unemployed became beggars and turned to robbery, and brigands robbed travelers along the highways. Some of the brigands were former royalists turned highwaymen. They were later celebrated in the novel of [[Alexander Dumas]], ''Les Compagnons de J\u00e9hu'' (\"The Companions of Jehu\"). The government did not have the money to hire more police, and the great majority of the army was occupied fighting in Italy, Switzerland and Egypt. The growing insecurity on the roads seriously harmed commerce in France. The problem of brigands and highwaymen was not seriously addressed until after a serious wave of crimes on the roads in the winter of 1797\u201398. The Councils passed a law calling for the death penalty for any robbery committed on the main highways or against a public vehicle, such as a coach, even if nothing was taken. If the crime was committed by more than one person, the robbers were tried by a military tribunal rather than a civilian court. The wave of highway robberies was finally stopped by Bonaparte and the Consulate, which employed special tribunals even swifter and more severe than the Directory tribunals.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|page=449-450}}\n\nCorruption was another serious problem, particularly with the businessmen who provided supplies to the army and government. In one case, the Chevalier enterprise received a contract to build three large warships and two frigates at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]]; the company was paid in national property seized from the aristocracy and the Church, but it never constructed the ships, or even bought the materials.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|page=508}}  Huge contracts for government supplies were passed from the furnishers to sub-contractors, who each paid the furnisher a fee. Sometimes contractors demanded to be paid for their services in advance in silver. They were paid, but never delivered the services, and then reimbursed the government with nearly-worthless assignats. The Directors themselves were accused of receiving money from contractors. The Minister of Finance of the Directory, [[Dominique-Vincent Ramel-Nogaret]], was offered 100,000 francs for a bribe to give a contract by a furnisher named Langlois. Ramel refused and turned Langlois over to the police; however, some ministers and Directors, like Barras, left the government with large fortunes. The Directory was unable to escape the accusations of  widespread corruption.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|page=508}}\n\n=== ''Muscadins'', ''Incroyables'' and ''Merveilleuses'' ===\n[[File:Muscadins.jpg|thumb|''Les deux incroyables'': [[Muscadins]] or [[Incroyables]] wore extravagant costumes in reaction against the recent [[Reign of Terror]], by [[Carle Vernet]], c. 1797]]\nBorn in reaction against the strict codes of behavior established during the [[National Convention|Convention]] and the [[Reign of Terror]], the ''[[Muscadins]]'' were fashionable young men who carried canes and sometimes, in groups, attacked [[sans-culottes]]. Following soon afterwards, the Directory had its own fashion reflecting the new social behavior and carried out by young Parisians of both sexes, from middle and upper-class families, often survivors of the excesses of the Revolution, who had lost parents and family members to the guillotine. They were called ''[[Incroyables and Merveilleuses]]'' and dressed in extravagant costumes. The men, the ''Incroyables'', wore long hair to their shoulders, round hats with broad brims, short coats and silk culottes. Their female counterparts, the ''Merveilleuses'', wore flowing, high-breasted transparent dresses reminiscent of the Greco-Roman era. They frequented balls called ''[[Bals des victimes]]'' and spoke in their own particular accent and vocabulary, avoiding to pronounce the letter \"R\", as it was the first letter of the word \"Revolution\"{{Sfn|Tulard1998|page=884}}\n\n=== Marriage and divorce ===\nDuring the Directory, almost all the structures and rules of Paris society had been swept away, but no new structures and rules had yet been created to replace them. The [[brothers Goncourt]] meticulously described the period on their ''Histoire de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise pendant le Directoire''. Caste and rank mattered far less; all the old titles and forms of address had disappeared, along with old customs and social conventions. Men no longer took off their hats when talking to women, and people of different ranks spoke to each other as equals. Society no longer met in private, in the houses of the nobility, but in public, at balls, restaurants and public gardens. As the Goncourts said, \"social anarchy\" reigned in Paris: \"everyone met with everyone.\" Government ministers could be seen walking or dining with actresses, bankers with courtesans.{{sfn|de Goncourt|page=178}}\n \n\"Liaisons were easy\", the Goncourts reported, \"marriage less so.\" The old system of marriages arranged between families based on fortune, profession, and social condition was less common. Marriages were no longer controlled by the church, but by the new civil code, which described marriage as \"nature in action.\" Marriage was seen as a temporary, not a permanent state. Children born outside of marriage were given equal status concerning inheritance and other legal matters as those born to married couples. Divorce was much simpler, and could be requested by either the husband or wife. In one period of fifteen months, 5,994 civil law divorces were granted in Paris, of which 3,886 were requested by the wife. Of 1,148 divorces granted on the grounds of \"incompatibility of humor\", 887 were requested by the wife. The new system also led to a large increase in the number of children born outside of marriage and not wanted; in 1795 four thousand unwanted children in the Department of the Seine were turned over to foundling hospitals.{{sfn|de Goncourt|page=185}}\n\nThe breakdown of the old system of arranged marriages led to the creation of the first newspaper where men and women could advertise themselves for suitable spouses, called the ''Indicateur des marriages''. it also led to the establishment of the first marriage bureaus. A businessman named Liardot rented a large former mansion, brought in selected eligible young women as paying guests, and invited men seeking wives to meet them at balls, concerts and card games each given at the house each evening. The men were screened by their profession and education.{{sfn|de Goncourt|page=185}}\n\n=== Amusement\u2014''Bals des victimes'', pleasure gardens, new restaurants and caf\u00e9s ===\nAlthough balls were not banned during the [[Reign of Terror]],<ref>Tissier, Andr\u00e9, ''Les spectacles \u00e0 Paris pendant la R\u00e9volution... de la proclamation de la R\u00e9publique \u00e0 la fin de la Convention nationale (21 septembre 1792 \u2013 26 octobre 1795)'', publisher: Droz, 2002, pp. 363\u2013369 and further [https://books.google.com/books?id=saeLdu3k14AC&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=combien+de+bals+%C3%A0+paris+pendant+la+grande+terreur+de+robespierre&source=bl&ots=hDu_QlsZuB&sig=VfntF288ZtnF-3lCYjvaBFNHe70&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjzmszO8cXPAhUkJsAKHUC8Cy8Q6AEITzAH#v=onepage&q=bal&f=false]</ref> after the death of Robespierre and the fall of the Jacobins, the city experienced a frenzy of dancing that lasted throughout the period of the French Directory. The Goncourt brothers reported that 640 balls took place in 1797 alone. Several former monasteries were turned into ballrooms, including the [[Professed House (Paris)|Noviciate of the Jesuits]], the ''Monast\u00e8re des Carmes'' (turned into a prison where 191 members of the Catholic Church (bishops, priests, monks) were [[September Massacres|massacred on 2 September 1792]], the ''S\u00e9minaire Saint-Sulpice'', and even in the former Saint-Sulpice cemetery. Some of the former palatial townhouses of the nobility were rented and used for ballrooms; the ''H\u00f4tel de Longueville'' near the Louvre put on enormous spectacles, with three hundred couples dancing, in thirty circles of sixteen dancers each, the women in nearly transparent dresses, styled after Roman tunics. In the public balls, everyone danced with everyone; merchants, clerks, artisans and workers danced with shop women and seamstresses. In the more popular public balls, the ''cavaliers'' were charged 80 sous for admission, while women paid 12 sous. At more exclusive balls, admission was five livres.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|pages=145\u2013146}} Aristocrats who had survived or returned from exile held their own balls in their houses in the [[Faubourg Saint-Germain]], where ''[[Bals des victimes]]'' (\"Balls of the victims\") were attended by invitees who had lost at least one parent to the guillotine.\n\nThe formal dancing of the minuet was replaced by a much more passionate new dance, the [[waltz]], which was introduced to Paris during this time from Germany. For summer evening entertainment, Parisians began to abandon the Tuileries Gardens and the gardens of the [[Palais-Royal]] and went to the new pleasure gardens which appeared in the neighborhood between the [[Boulevards of Paris|Grands boulevards]] and the [[Palais-Royal]]. The most famous was the [[Jardin de Tivoli, Paris|''Jardin de Tivoli'']], also known as ''Folie Boutin'' or ''Grand Tivoli'', located on [[rue Saint-Lazare]]. It had belonged to an aristocrat named Boutin, who was guillotined during the Reign of Terror. It was a vast garden covering 40 [[Arpent|''arpents'']] (13,675 hectares), and could hold as many as ten thousand persons. It had alleys filled with promenaders, greenhouses, illuminations, an orchestra, dancing, a caf\u00e9, and fireworks at night. Other new gardens competed by adding spectacles and pageants. The ''[[Jardin des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]]'' offered a pageant of costumed soldiers on horseback performing elaborate maneuvers and firing weapons. The ''Mousseau'' (now ''[[Parc Monceau]]'') had performers dressed as [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] dancing and fighting battles. The former ''Pavillon de Hanovre'', which had been part of Cardinal Richelieu's residential complex, featured a terrace for dancing and dining decorated with Turkish tents, Chinese kiosks and lanterns.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|pages=213\u2013234}}\n\nMany new restaurants and caf\u00e9s, usually close to the twenty-three theaters, appeared in and around the Palais-Royal and the new boulevards. A new caf\u00e9, the ''Tortoni'', specializing in ice creams, opened in 1795 at the corner of the [[boulevard des Italiens]] and ''rue Taitbout''. The new restaurants in the Palais-Royal were often run by the former chefs of archbishops and aristocrats who had gone into exile. The restaurant ''M\u00e9ot'' offered a menu with over one hundred dishes. Beside the ''M\u00e9ot'' and ''Beauvilliers'', under the arcades of the Palais-Royal were the restaurants and caf\u00e9s such as ''Naudet'', ''Robert'', ''V\u00e9ry'', ''Foy'', ''Hur\u00e9'' <!-- there was a Hu\u00e9 at the Grand Palais (=end of 19th century)  -->, ''Berceau'', ''Lyrique'', ''Libert\u00e9 conquise'', ''de Chartres'' (now ''[[Le Grand V\u00e9four]]''), and ''du Sauvage'' <!-- can't find trace of any restaurant by the name of \"restaurant du Sauvage\" -->(the last owned by the former coachman of Robespierre). In the cellars of the Palais-Royal were more popular caf\u00e9s, usually with music, smaller menus at more reasonable prices. One of those, the ''Postal'' <!-- can't find anything by that name -->, offered a menu for just 36 sous. Many of the caf\u00e9s in the cellars had orchestras; the most famous was the ''Caf\u00e9 des Aveugles'', with an orchestra of four blind musicians.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|pages=73\u201383}}\n\nAfter the Reign of Terror had ended, dining hours for upper-class Parisians returned gradually to what they had been before the Revolution, with ''d\u00e9jeuner'' at midday, dinner at 6 or 7 in the evening, and supper at 2 in the morning. When the theater performances ended at 10 PM, the spectators went to the nearby caf\u00e9s on the boulevards.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|page=74}}\n\n== Church and State ==\nThe Roman Catholic Church was one of the greatest [[status quo]] losers of over the course of the 1789-1799 French Revolution.{{According to whom|date=December 2016}} Priests, who refused to take an oath to the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] emigrated or were expelled from France under a penalty of death. Church property, from cathedrals to candlesticks, was seized and sold. Church ceremonies were banned, causing clandestine religious services to be conducted in private homes. During the [[Reign of Terror]], at Robespierre's urging, the [[National Convention]], on 7 May 1794, proclaimed a new religion, the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]], which in a little over a year led to the [[Thermidorian Reaction]], and Robespierre's downfall and execution. The Roman Catholic Church had been the official state religion during the monarchy, and the Directors were all anti-religious republicans, but the Directory, with a few exceptions, did not try to impose any particular religious views, and its policy toward priests and religious institutions changed depending upon political events.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=548\u2013559}} After the fall of Robespierre, the repression against the Church eased and, although the policy of repression remained, many churches, especially in the provinces, re-opened, and exiled priests began to quietly return.\n\nIn November 1797, working with the new [[Decimal time|decimal-based]] [[French Republican Calendar|Republican Calendar]], the week of which has ten days, the Directory replaced Sundays and religious holidays with republican celebrations. The tenth day of the week, called ''decadi'', was designated to replace Sunday. The churches still functioning with Constitutional priests were instructed to have mass on ''decadi'', rather than on the day that would have been Sunday in the previous calendar, and ''decadi'' became the official non-working day: government employees were off, and schools, shops and markets were closed. To replace saints' and religious days, a whole series of secular holidays was created, in addition to the patriotic celebrations already in place, such as 14 of July and important dates of the French Revolution. There were also special days, such as, \"the day of the sovereignty of the people\"; \"the day of youth\"; \"the day of spouses\"; \"the day of agriculture\" and \"the day of the elderly\". Certain churches were given new names: the cathedral [[Notre Dame de Paris]] was renamed \"Temple of the Supreme Being\", Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont became the \"Temple of Filial piety\". On ''decadi'', the constitutional priests who performed services were required to share the space with other republican religions and associations who wanted to use the buildings. Large churches were divided into sections for use by various religions.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=548\u2013559}}\n\nA new religion, [[Theophilanthropy]], had been founded in 1796 by a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] printer-bookseller named Jean-Baptiste Chemin-Dupont\u00e8s (1760\u20131852?).<ref>[http://data.bnf.fr/12229334/jean-baptiste_chemin-dupontes/ Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]</ref> It was encouraged by the Director La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux and the Ministry of the Interior, with the state paying for its newspaper. Members believed in God and in the immortality of the soul, but not in the [[original sin]]. The sect was similar in form to [[Calvinism]], with readings aloud of texts, hymns and sermons. With the support of the Directory, the sect was given four churches in Paris, including Saint-Roch, Saint-Sulpice and, in April 1798, Notre-Dame de Paris, as well as churches in [[Dijon]], [[Poitiers]] and [[Bordeaux]]. Members of the sect included some prominent figures, such as General Hoche, the industrialist [[\u00c9leuth\u00e8re Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e du Pont]], the painter [[Jean-Baptiste Regnault]], and the American philosopher and political activist [[Thomas Paine]]. Beginning in May 1798, however, the Directory began to withdraw support from the newly established deistic sect, which it considered too close to the Jacobins. The sect still had eighteen churches in 1799, but in 1801 it was abolished by Bonaparte. {{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=548\u2013559}}\n\nIn Italy, the French army attacked the papal states governed by the Roman Catholic Church in Italy. In February 1797, Bonaparte occupied [[Ancona]] to force [[Pope Pius VI]] to negotiate. The pope was obliged to cede Ancona and the northern part of his states to the new French-sponsored [[Cispadane Republic]]. The gold and silver in the treasury of the Vatican was taken to France to help support the French currency. Following anti-French riots in Rome in December 1797, a French army under Berthier entered Rome and proclaimed a Roman Republic. Pius VI was taken prisoner by the French Army, and transferred to [[Valence, Dr\u00f4me|Valence]] in France, where he was kept prisoner until his death in 1801.\n\n== Economy ==\n=== Finance ===\nMany of the economic, social and political woes during the Directory were results of the breakdown of the financial system. The principal problem was a great shortage of money with real value; that is, coins made of silver, and an excess of paper money, the value of which shrank as more and more was printed. The Directory produced only 32 million [[French livre|livres]] worth of silver-based coins in its first two years. Much of this money was hoarded, since, unlike the paper money, it had and retained real value. As a consequence, the government, to cover its costs, was forced to print millions of notes, first called ''[[assignat]]s'' and then ''[[Mandats territoriaux|mandats]]'', which were based on the value of property seized from the Church and the clergy. These notes declined in value as more and more were printed. When the notes became nearly worthless, the Directory first devalued them and finally gave up and stopped printing paper money. The shortage of real money in the second part of the Directory led to a new problem: shortage of credit; interest rates rose to about ten percent, double what they had been in 1789. The consequence in the last two years of the Directory was a decline in economic activity, and in wages, while prices rose. The population lost confidence in the money and in the Directory's management.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=513\u2013515}}\n\nThe lack of credit led to the creation of a number of new private banks, and the growing importance of banks and bankers in the economy. The ''[[Caisse des comptes courants]]'', created in June 1796, had some of the most important industrialists and financiers in France as its founders, who would later become the founders of the [[Bank of France|''Banque de France'']]. Several other new private banks followed, which concentrated the wealth of France even more in Paris. Since the nobility had gone into exile, the bankers became the new nobility of France.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=515\u2013518}} In other words, bankers became the new aristocrats.\n\n=== Transportation and commerce ===\nThe transportation system within France was another handicap to the economy. The roads and canals had not been improved or maintained since the overthrow of the monarchy. Major canals that had been started in Burgundy and in the north were unfinished. Maritime commerce was in an even worse situation as a result of the war and blockade of French ports by Britain. During the Directory, the number of French ships of more than two hundred tons was one tenth of what it had been in 1789. The conquest of Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy improved the situation somewhat: French goods could be transported on the neutral ships of these countries, and maritime traffic on the [[Baltic Sea]] to Germany became an important trade route for France. However, the British navy largely cut off the trade with the French colonies in the Caribbean, which earlier had provided sugar, cotton, indigo and coffee to France; and the entry of the fleet of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Nelson]] into the [[Mediterranean Sea]] cut off the trade routes there. The major ports of [[Nantes]] and [[Marseille]] saw their commerce and trade routes disappear.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=523\u2013525}}\n\n=== Industry ===\nThe continual wars and fiscal crises greatly limited the expansion of French industry. The [[Industrial Revolution]] had only just begun in France. Production during the Directory had fallen below what it was in 1789. The number of workers in the [[Silk|silk industry]] in [[Lyon]] had dropped from 12,000 before 1787 to 6,500. The [[Cotton|cotton textile industry]] was more successful due to the embargo against British products caused by the war. New factories and new technologies, such as mechanical [[loom]]s, were introduced in [[Normandy]] and in [[Alsace]]. However, the technologies were still primitive; the [[steam engine]] had not yet arrived in French factories. The [[chemical industry]] was also advancing rapidly during the Directory; the chemist and entrepreneur [[Jean Antoine Claude Chaptal]] built a chemical factory in [[Montpellier]], which he soon moved to [[16th arrondissement of Paris|Chaillot]], a village west of Paris. The most effective promoter of French industry was [[Fran\u00e7ois de Neufch\u00e2teau]], who was Minister of the Interior before becoming a Director in 1797. He planned a new canal system, began work on a new road across the [[Pyrenees]], and organized the first national industrial exposition in Paris, which opened with great success in October 1798. Once he became Consul, Bonaparte copied the idea of the industrial exposition. Despite this bright spot, French industry was primitive: without steam power, most factories in France depended upon water power, and the [[Metalworking|metallurgy industry]] still melted iron with wood fires, not oil.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=528\u2013531}}\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nAgriculture was another weak spot of the French economy. While the country was essentially rural, the methods of farming had not been changed in centuries. The vast majority of farmers had small plots of land, sold little and worked essentially to produce enough food for their families. The price of grain was freed from government control under the Directory in 1797, and farmers could sell their grain at whatever price they could get. Following the Revolution in 1789, the forests had been taken away from the nobles and opened to everyone; as a result, large areas of the forests were immediately cut down, and no new trees planted to replace them. The land of the nobility and Church was taken and redistributed to peasants, but under the new inheritance laws, which gave equal shares to all sons, the size of the farm plots became smaller and smaller. Small plots were not consolidated into larger fields, as was taking place in England at the same time. Most farmers were reluctant to try new methods; they did not want to leave fields idle to recover productivity, or to grow forage crops to feed cattle. Furthermore, during the endless wars of the Directory, thousands of farmers were taken into the army, and thousands of [[horse]]s and [[mule]]s needed for farming were taken by the Army for the use of the [[cavalry]] and transport. Under these conditions, food shortages and famines occurred regularly in France until the time of [[Napoleon III]].{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=531\u2013533}}\n\n== Education and science ==\nThe education system of France was in a chaotic state at the beginning of the Directory. The College of Sorbonne and most other colleges of the University of Paris, had been closed because of their close association with the Catholic Church, and did not reopen until 1808. The schools run by the Catholic Church had also been closed, and any kind of religious instruction forbidden. The government of Jacobins during the Convention created several new scientific institutions, but had concentrated on primary education, which it decreed should be obligatory and free for all young people, but there were few teachers available. By forbidding religious education, seizing the property of the Church and chasing out the clergy, they effectively closed the largest part of the educational system of the country.\n\nAt the beginning of the period, the Directory reversed the policy of obligatory and free education for all, largely because of the lack of money to pay teachers. The Directory began to create a system of central schools, with the goal of one in each department, which boys could attend from the age of twelve, with a full curriculum of sciences, history and literature. The state paid a part of the cost, while each student also paid the professor a fee. The new schools had libraries (mostly confiscated from the nobility), small botanical gardens, and museums of natural history. For the first time in French schools, French instead of Latin was the basis of education. Three of these schools were organized in Paris; two of them later became the famous [[Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV]] and [[Lyc\u00e9e Charlemagne]]. But by the end of the Directory there were only 992 students in the three Paris schools.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=561\u2013562.}}\n\nFor primary education, each ''arrondissement'' in Paris had one school for boys and another for girls, and each [[Communes of France|commune]] in the country was supposed to have the same. Since the state lacked money, teachers were paid by the commune or by the students. Once a student learned to read, write, and count, he or she was graduated. In villages, the school was often located in the former church, and teachers were expected, as part of their duties, to carry water, clean the church, ring the bells, and, when needed, dig graves in the churchyard cemetery.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=564}}\n\nThe choices were greater for the children of the middle and upper middle class, as these families had tutors, or sent their children to private schools, but for much of the population, schooling was minimal. There were 56 public schools in the Seine department, which by the population should have had at least 20,000 students; but they had only between 1100 and 1200.{{Sfn|Lefebvre|1977|pages=564}}\n\nThe continual wars during the Directory also had their effect on education. Beginning in October 1797, boys in public schools were required to take part in periodic military exercises, and the Directory established five military schools, called ''\u00c9coles de Mars'', for a total of 15,000 students. Attendance was a requirement for entry into the higher schools of engineering and public works.\n\nThe Directory focused its attention on secondary education and especially on creating specialized higher schools for training managers, judges, doctors and engineers, for which there was an immediate and pressing need. The ''[[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]]'' had been founded by a member of the Directory, [[Lazare Carnot]] and the mathematician [[Gaspard Monge]], in 1794. The school became the most prestigious engineering and public works school in France. However, by the end of the Directory there were still no law schools, and only two schools of medicine outside of Paris.\n\nThe ''[[Institut de France]]'' was also founded in 1795 by [[Lazare Carnot]] and [[Monge]], to bring together the scientists and researchers, who previously had worked in separate academies, to share knowledge and ideas. It was divided into three large sections: physical sciences and mathematics; moral and political science; and literature and the fine arts. It organized the large party of scientists and scholars who accompanied Napoleon to Egypt, which discovered such treasures as the [[Rosetta Stone]], which allowed the deciphering of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. One of the ''Institut de France'' first members and speakers was Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, who took the place of Carnot after the latter had been removed from the Directory and left France.\n\n== Art and culture==\n=== Painting \u2013 The Salon and the Louvre ===\nThe artists of Paris were in a difficult situation during the Directory, as their most important patrons, the aristocracy, had been executed or had emigrated; however a new wealthy class was just being formed. Before the Revolution a half-figure portrait could be commissioned from a less-known artist for three hundred livres. During the Directory, the price fell to forty-eight livres.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|page=268}} Nonetheless, the [[Salon (Paris)|''Salon'']] took place in the Louvre in 1795 as it had since 1725, before the Revolution, and each year thereafter. The most prominent artist of the Revolution, [[Jacques-Louis David]], closely connected with the Jacobins, was in seclusion in his studio inside the Louvre. At the end of the period, in 1799, he produced one important work, the ''[[Intervention of the Sabine Women]]''. However, a new generation of artists, inspired by David,  showed their works; [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]]; [[Anne-Louis Girodet]], a pupil of David, renown for his romantic paintings, particularly a 1797 painting of the prominent actress [[Anne Fran\u00e7oise Elisabeth Lange|Mademoiselle Lange]] as [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]; [[Carle Vernet]], the son and father of famous painters; the portrait painter and [[Portrait miniature|miniaturist]] [[Jean-Baptiste Isabey]], known as the \"painter of the kings\" or \"portraitist of Europe\",<ref>[http://www.napoleon-empire.net/personnages/isabey.php ''Napol\u00e9on & Empire: Jean-Baptiste Isabey (1767\u20131855)]</ref> who painted queen [[Marie-Antoinette]] and empress [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Jos\u00e9phine]], and remained active until the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]; the genre painter [[Louis-L\u00e9opold Boilly]]; [[Antoine-Jean Gros]], a young history and landscape painter, who soon achieved fame and a government position in 1796 with a heroic portrait of Bonaparte at the [[battle of Arcole]]; the romantic landscapes of [[Hubert Robert]]; [[Pierre-Paul Prud'hon]], whose work combined [[Neoclassicism]] and [[Romanticism]]; and a major neoclassical sculptor from the earlier generation, [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], famous for his busts of [[George Washington]] and [[Voltaire]].{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|page=268}}\n\nMaking the Louvre into an art museum had first been proposed in 1747 by [[\u00c9tienne La Font de Saint-Yenne]] and supported by [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] in 1765 in the article on the Louvre in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]''. The idea was accepted by Louis XVI who, in 1789, began work on the ''Grande Galerie'' of the Louvre. The Revolution intervened, and on 27 July 1793 the Convention decreed the creation of a Museum of the Republic (''Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise''), which opened on 10 August 1793, the first anniversary of the [[10 August (French Revolution)|storming of the Tuileries]].{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1004}}\n\nIn 1797, at the end of Bonaparte's triumphant first Italian campaign, convoys of wagons began arriving in Paris, carrying bronze horses, Greek antiquities, tapestries, marble statues, paintings and other works of art taken from Italian cities under the terms of peace agreed by the Austrians. They included works by [[Raphael]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Titian]], [[Paolo Veronese]] and other masters. Other convoys arrived from the Netherlands and Flanders with more art from the Spanish provinces. The more famous works were displayed on wagons in a festive victory parade through the center of Paris. The rest was crammed, unwrapped, into the corridors, galleries and stairways of the Louvre. Work began to rebuild the ''[[Galerie d'Apollon]]'' and other galleries to provide a home for the 'newly acquired' art.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1860|pages=283\u2013287}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\" caption=\"Art during the Directory\">\nFile:Louvre-peinture-francaise-p1020324.jpg|''Imaginary view of the gallery of the Louvre as a ruin'', by [[Hubert Robert]] (1796), [[Louvre]], [[Paris]]\nFile:Gerard FrancoisPascalSimon-Cupid Psyche end.jpg|''Psyche et l'Amour'' by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]] (1797), Louvre\nFile:Girodet-Trioson - Mademoiselle Lange as Venus, 1798.jpg|''Mademoiselle Lange as Venus'', by [[Anne-Louis Girodet]] (1798), [[Museum der bildenden K\u00fcnste]], [[Leipzig]] \nFile:The Intervention of the Sabine Women.jpg|The ''Intervention of the Sabine Women'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1799), Louvre\n</gallery>\n\n=== Furniture and decoration \u2013 the ''Directoire'' style ===\n[[File:Styles of ornament, exhibited in designs, and arranged in historical order, with descriptive text.

The style of interior decoration, known as the ''[[Directoire style]]'', was one of the notable contributions of the period. It was a transitional style, a compromise between the  [[Louis XVI style]] and [[Neoclassicism in France|French neoclassicism]].  [[Riesener]], the famous furniture designer for Louis XVI, did not die until 1806, though his clientele changed from the nobility to the wealthy new upper class. The Directory saw the first widespread use of [[mahogany]], an imported tropical wood used in the making of furniture.{{Sfn|Lefebvre}}\n\n=== Literature ===\nThe Directory period produced a small number of important literary works, often very critical of the excesses of Revolution. These included  ''Essay on the Revolutions'' by [[Chateaubriand]], published in 1797, which called for a return to Christian values.  At the complete opposite end of the literary scale was the last major work of the [[Marquis de Sade]], ''The New Justine'', published in 1797.  Sade also wrote a satirical brochure mocking thinly-disguised characters resembling Bonapartre and Josephine. Shortly after the end Directory, on 6 March 1801, Sade was arrested for ''Justine'' and its sequel and ended his days in the insane asylum of Charenton. {{Sfn|Tulard1998||page=1081}}\n\n== Directory judged by historians ==\n=== 19th Century Historians and Writers ===\nHistorians generally have not been kind to the 'Age of the Directory'. [[Adolphe Thiers]], later twice the Prime Minister and the first president of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], wrote the first major history in French of the Revolution, in ten volumes, published between 1823 and 1827. He described the Directory this way:\n:<blockquote>One of the indispensable qualities of a government is to have good reputation that defends it against unjust attacks. When it has lost this reputation, and when people blame it for the faults of others, and even for bad luck, then it no longer has the ability to govern, and this incapacity should force it to retire. How many governments had been used up during the Revolution!... The Directory had been used up like the Committee of Public Safety before it, and the government of Napoleon that followed. All the accusations against the Directory proved not its faults but its nullity.<ref name=\"Thiers, Adolphe 1827\">Thiers, Adolphe, ''Histoire de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', Volume 10, Chapter XV, (1827). Online version on Project Gutenberg</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThiers blamed Barras, the only Director who served from the beginning to the end of the Directory, for its failure.\n:<blockquote>By a bizarre chance, but one that is seen often in the conflicts within revolutions, public opinion had indulgence for the one Director who merited it the least. Barras alone deserved all that was said of the Directory. First of all, he never worked; he left to his colleagues all the burden of business. He spoke only a decisive moments, when his voice was stronger than his courage. He occupied himself with nothing. He only concerned himself with the personnel of the government, which best suited his genius at intrigue. He took a share of all the profits of the government suppliers, and alone of the Directors deserved the accusation of corruption. Despite all of his faults, he was treated differently than the others, first of all because, unlike the other four, he was not a lawyer; and despite his laziness, his debauched habits, his bad manners, and his liaisons with the Jacobins, he alone was credited with 18 Fructidor [the downfall of Robespierre], and he gave the appearance of a man of action, more capable of governing than his colleagues... He was even treacherous toward his colleagues; because all of the criticism that he deserved himself he skillfully managed to shift exclusively onto them.<ref name=\"Thiers, Adolphe 1827\"/>  </blockquote>\n\nThe most celebrated and vivid description of French society under the Directory was written by the [[Goncourt brothers]], Edmond and Jules, published in 1864, which described the mores, daily life, culture and preoccupations of the Parisians. Its final chapter contained the lines:\n:<blockquote>Like a guest at the end of an orgy, France was weary; weary of gods, of tribunes, of heroes, of executioners; weary of struggles, of efforts, of cries, of curses, of enthusiasms, of fevers, of intoxications, of storms, of triumphs, of agonies \u2013 France was weary of revolutions, coups d'\u00e9tats. constitutions, legislatures... weary of conquests, weary of being saved; weary of Belgium submissive, Italy conquered; of Germany, when all the eagles of Germany had been taken to the ''Invalides'', but France was still not the head; France was weary of climbing into the sky, of amassing empires, of monopolizing the world; France glutted with glory; France broken, sleeping on a mattress of corpses, sleeping on a  bed of laurels. France, emptied of men, of silver, of crimes, of ideas, of eloquence; France, like Mirabeau when he was dying, asking of his doctors and his descendants only one single thing: to sleep!<ref>De Goncourt, Edmond et Jules, ''Histoire de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise pendant le Directoire'', (1864) [[Groupe Flammarion|Flammarion]], Paris</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe shortest and simplest description of the entire period, from the Convention to the Empire, was given by [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]] in 1837\u201343 in his novel ''[[Illusions perdues]]''.

Tor encrypts the data, including the next node destination [[IP address]], multiple times and sends it through a [[virtual circuit]] comprising successive, random-selection Tor relays. Each relay decrypts a layer of [[encryption]] to reveal the next relay in the circuit to pass the remaining encrypted data on to it. The final relay decrypts the innermost layer of encryption and sends the original data to its destination without revealing or knowing the source IP address.

It is an implementation of [[onion routing]], which encrypts and then randomly bounces communications through a network of relays run by volunteers around the globe. These onion routers employ [[encryption]] in a multi-layered manner (hence the onion metaphor) to ensure [[perfect forward secrecy]] between relays, thereby providing users with anonymity in a network location. That anonymity extends to the hosting of censorship-resistant content by Tor's anonymous onion service feature.<ref name=\"usenix-design\" /> Furthermore, by keeping some of the entry relays (bridge relays) secret, users can evade [[Internet censorship]] that relies upon blocking public Tor relays.<ref name=\"torproject-bridges\" />\n\nBecause the [[IP address]] of the sender and the recipient are not ''both'' in [[cleartext]] at any hop along the way, anyone eavesdropping at any point along the communication channel cannot directly identify both ends. Furthermore, to the recipient it appears that the last Tor [[Node (networking)|node]] (called the exit node), rather than the sender, is the originator of the communication.\n\n===Originating traffic===\n[[File:EtherApeTorScreenShot.png|thumb|A visual depiction of the traffic between some Tor relay [[Node (networking)|nodes]] from the [[open-source software|open-source]] [[packet sniffing]] program [[EtherApe]]]]\nA Tor user's [[SOCKS]]-aware applications can be configured to direct their network traffic through a Tor instance's SOCKS interface, which is listening on TCP port 9150 at [[localhost]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2018-12&post=TorPCAP---Tor-Network-Forensics |title= TorPCAP - Tor Network Forensics |website= Netresec |accessdate= 12 December 2018}}</ref> Tor periodically creates virtual circuits through the Tor network through which it can [[multiplexing|multiplex]] and onion-route that traffic to its destination. Once inside a Tor network, the traffic is sent from router to router along the circuit, ultimately reaching an exit node at which point the [[cleartext]] packet is available and is forwarded on to its original destination. Viewed from the destination, the traffic appears to originate at the Tor exit node.\n\n[[File:Tor-non-exit-relay-bandwidth-usage.jpg|thumb|A Tor non-exit relay with a maximum output of 239.69 kbit/s]]\nTor's application independence sets it apart from most other anonymity networks: it works at the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) stream level. Applications whose traffic is commonly anonymized using Tor include [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), [[instant messaging]], and [[World Wide Web]] browsing.\n\n===Onion services{{anchor|Hidden services}}===\n{{See also|List of Tor onion services}}\nTor can also provide anonymity to websites and other servers. Servers configured to receive inbound connections only through Tor are called '''onion services''' (formerly, '''hidden services''').<ref>{{cite web |last1=Winter |first1=Philipp |title=How Do Tor Users Interact With Onion Services? |url=https://nymity.ch/onion-services/pdf/sec18-onion-services.pdf |accessdate=27 December 2018}}</ref> Rather than revealing a server's IP address (and thus its network location), an onion service is accessed through its [[.onion|onion address]], usually via the [[#Tor Browser|Tor Browser]]. The Tor network understands these addresses by looking up their corresponding [[public key]]s and ''introduction points'' from a [[distributed hash table]] within the network. It can route data to and from onion services, even those hosted behind [[firewall (computing)|firewalls]] or [[network address translator]]s (NAT), while preserving the anonymity of both parties. Tor is necessary to access these onion services.<ref name=\"torproject-conf-hidden\" />\n\nOnion services were first specified in 2003<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mathewson|first1=Nick|title=Add first draft of rendezvous point document|url=https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/commit/?id=3d538f6d702937c23bec33b3bdd62ff9fba9d2a3|website=Tor Source Code|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref> and have been deployed on the Tor network since 2004.<ref name=\"or-locating\" /> Other than the database that stores the onion service descriptors,<ref name=\"torproject-hidden\" /> Tor is decentralized by design; there is no direct readable list of all onion services, although a number of onion services catalog publicly known onion addresses.\n\nBecause onion services route their traffic entirely through the Tor network, connection to an onion service is encrypted end-to-end and not subject to eavesdropping. There are, however, security issues involving Tor onion services. For example, services that are reachable through Tor onion services ''and'' the public Internet are susceptible to correlation attacks and thus not perfectly hidden.

It is [[free software]], available under the [[GNU General Public License]].<ref name=license/>\n\n==Weaknesses==\nLike all current [[latency (engineering)|low-latency]] [[anonymity network]]s, Tor cannot and does not attempt to protect against monitoring of traffic at the boundaries of the Tor network (i.e., the traffic entering and exiting the network). While Tor does provide protection against [[traffic analysis]], it cannot prevent traffic confirmation (also called ''end-to-end correlation'').<ref name=\"torproject-one-cell\" /><ref name=\"torproject-fail-both-ends\" />\n\nIn spite of known weaknesses and attacks listed here, a 2009 study revealed Tor and the alternative network system [[Java Anon Proxy|JonDonym]] (Java Anon Proxy, JAP) are considered more resilient to website fingerprinting techniques than other [[tunneling protocol]]s.\n\nThe reason for this is conventional single-hop [[VPN]] protocols do not need to reconstruct packet data nearly as much as a multi-hop service like Tor or JonDonym. Website fingerprinting yielded greater than 90% accuracy for identifying [[HTTP]] packets on conventional VPN protocols versus Tor which yielded only 2.96% accuracy. However, some protocols like [[OpenSSH]] and [[OpenVPN]] required a large amount of data before HTTP packets were identified.<ref name=\"ccsw-attacking\" />\n\nResearchers from the [[University of Michigan]] developed a network scanner allowing identification of 86% of live Tor \"bridges\" with a single scan.<ref name=\"twe-zmap\"/>\n\n===Eavesdropping===\n\n==== Autonomous system (AS) eavesdropping ====\nIf an [[Autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]] (AS) exists on both path segments from a client to entry relay and from exit relay to destination, such an AS can statistically correlate traffic on the entry and exit segments of the path and potentially infer the destination with which the client communicated. In 2012, LASTor proposed a method to predict a set of potential ASes on these two segments and then avoid choosing this path during the path selection algorithm on the client side. In this paper, they also improve latency by choosing shorter geographical paths between a client and destination.<ref name=\"LASTor-2012\" />\n\n==== Exit node eavesdropping ====\nIn September 2007, Dan Egerstad, a Swedish security consultant, revealed he had intercepted usernames and passwords for e-mail accounts by operating and monitoring Tor exit nodes.<ref name=\"wired-rogue-nodes\" /> As Tor cannot encrypt the traffic between an exit node and the target server, any exit node is in a position to capture traffic passing through it that does not use [[end-to-end encryption]] such as [[Secure Sockets Layer]] (SSL) or [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS). While this may not inherently breach the anonymity of the source, traffic intercepted in this way by self-selected third parties can expose information about the source in either or both of payload and protocol data.<ref name=\"sf-tor-hack\" /> Furthermore, Egerstad is circumspect about the possible subversion of Tor by intelligence agencies:<ref name=\"smh-hack-of-year\" />\n\n{{quote|\"If you actually look in to where these Tor nodes are hosted and how big they are, some of these nodes cost thousands of dollars each month just to host because they're using lots of bandwidth, they're heavy-duty servers and so on. Who would pay for this and be anonymous?\"}}\n\nIn October 2011, a research team from [[ESIEA (university)|ESIEA]] claimed to have discovered a way to compromise the Tor network by decrypting communication passing over it.<ref name=\"thn-compromised\" /><ref name=\"01-chercheurs\" /> The technique they describe requires creating a map of Tor network nodes, controlling one-third of them, and then acquiring their encryption [[Key (cryptography)|keys]] and algorithm [[Random seed|seeds]]. Then, using these known keys and seeds, they claim the ability to decrypt two encryption layers out of three. They claim to break the third key by a statistical attack. In order to redirect Tor traffic to the nodes they controlled, they used a [[denial-of-service]] attack. A response to this claim has been published on the official Tor Blog stating these rumours of Tor's compromise are greatly exaggerated.<ref name=\"torproject-rumors-exaggerated\" />\n\n===Traffic-analysis attack===\nThere are two methods of traffic-analysis attack, passive and active. In the passive traffic-analysis method, the attacker extracts features from the traffic of a specific flow on one side of the network and looks for those features on the other side of the network. In the active traffic-analysis method, the attacker alters the timings of the packets of a flow according to a specific pattern and looks for that pattern on the other side of the network; therefore, the attacker can link the flows in one side to the other side of the network and break the anonymity of it.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Soltani|first=Ramin|last2=Goeckel|first2=Dennis|last3=Towsley|first3=Don|last4=Houmansadr|first4=Amir|date=27 November 2017|arxiv=1711.10079|doi=10.1109/ACSSC.2017.8335179|title=2017 51st Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers|pages=258\u2013262|isbn=978-1-5386-1823-3}}</ref> It is shown, although timing noise is added to the packets, there are active traffic analysis methods robust against such a noise.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Steven Murdoch]] and George Danezis from [[University of Cambridge]] presented an article at the 2005 [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] [[Symposium]] on security and privacy on traffic-analysis techniques that allow adversaries with only a partial view of the network to infer which nodes are being used to relay the anonymous streams.<ref name=\"ieee-low-cost\" /> These techniques greatly reduce the anonymity provided by Tor. Murdoch and Danezis have also shown that otherwise unrelated streams can be linked back to the same initiator. This attack, however, fails to reveal the identity of the original user.<ref name=\"ieee-low-cost\" /> Murdoch has been working with and has been funded by Tor since 2006.\n\n===Tor exit node block===\nOperators of Internet sites have the ability to prevent traffic from Tor exit nodes or to offer reduced functionality for Tor users. For example, it is not generally possible to edit [[Wikipedia]] when using Tor or when using an IP address also used by a Tor exit node. The [[BBC]] blocks the IP addresses of all known Tor guards and exit nodes from its [[iPlayer]] service, although relays and bridges are not blocked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/help/troubleshooting/tv-games-consoles/in_the_uk_message|title=BBC iPlayer Help \u2013 Why does BBC iPlayer think I'm outside the UK?|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=10 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Bad apple attack===\nIn March 2011, researchers with the Rocquencourt [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation]] (Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique, INRIA), documented an attack that is capable of revealing the IP addresses of [[BitTorrent]] users on the Tor network. The \"bad apple attack\" exploits Tor's design and takes advantage of insecure application use to associate the simultaneous use of a secure application with the IP address of the Tor user in question. One method of attack depends on control of an exit node or hijacking tracker responses, while a secondary attack method is based in part on the statistical exploitation of [[distributed hash table]] tracking.<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" /> According to the study:<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" />\n\nThe results presented in the bad apple attack research paper are based on an attack in the wild launched against the Tor network by the authors of the study. The attack targeted six exit nodes, lasted for twenty-three days, and revealed a total of 10,000 IP addresses of active Tor users. This study is significant because it is the first documented attack designed to target [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] file-sharing applications on Tor.<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" /> BitTorrent may generate as much as 40% of all traffic on Tor.<ref name=\"shining-light\" /> Furthermore, the bad apple attack is effective against insecure use of any application over Tor, not just BitTorrent.<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" />\n\n===Some protocols expose IP addresses===\nResearchers from the [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation]] (INRIA) showed that the Tor dissimulation technique in [[BitTorrent]] can be bypassed by attackers controlling a Tor exit node. The study was conducted by monitoring six exit nodes for a period of twenty-three days. Researches used three [[attack vector]]s:<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />\n;Inspection of BitTorrent control messages: Tracker announces and extension protocol handshakes may optionally contain a client [[IP address]]. Analysis of collected data revealed that 35% and 33% of messages, respectively, contained addresses of clients.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />{{rp|3}}\n;Hijacking trackers' responses: Due to lack of encryption or authentication in communication between the tracker and peer, typical [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s allow attackers to determine peer IP addresses and even verify the distribution of content. Such attacks work when Tor is used only for tracker communication.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />{{rp|4}}\n;Exploiting distributed hash tables (DHT): This attack exploits the fact that [[distributed hash table]] (DHT) connections through Tor are impossible, so an attacker is able to reveal a target's IP address by looking it up in the DHT even if the target uses Tor to connect to other peers.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\nWith this technique, researchers were able to identify other streams initiated by users, whose IP addresses were revealed.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />\n\n===Sniper attack===\nJansen ''et al''., describes a [[DDoS]] attack targeted at the Tor node software, as well as defenses against that attack and its variants. The attack works using a colluding client and server, and filling the queues of the exit node until the node runs out of memory, and hence can serve no other (genuine) clients. By attacking a significant proportion of the exit nodes this way, an attacker can degrade the network and increase the chance of targets using nodes controlled by the attacker.<ref name=\"andssy-sniper\" />\n\n===Heartbleed bug===\nThe [[Heartbleed]] [[OpenSSL]] [[Software bug|bug]] disrupted the Tor network for several days in April 2014 while [[private key]]s were renewed. The Tor Project recommended Tor relay operators and onion service operators revoke and generate fresh keys after patching OpenSSL, but noted Tor relays use two sets of keys and Tor's multi-hop design minimizes the impact of exploiting a single relay.<ref name=\"torproject-openssl-cve\" /> 586 relays later found to be susceptible to the Heartbleed bug were taken offline as a precautionary measure.<ref name=\"ml-rejecting\" /><ref name=\"torproject-news-20140416\" /><ref name=\"ars-ranks-cut\" /><ref name=\"tp-blacklisting\" />\n{{anchor |Relay early attack}}<!-- there are links here; please don't move/remove without fixing the links -->\n\n=== Relay early traffic confirmation attack ===\nOn 30 July 2014 the Tor Project issued the security advisory \"relay early traffic confirmation attack\" in which the project discovered a group of relays that tried to deanonymize onion service users and operators.<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"On July 4, 2014 we found a group of relays that we assume were trying to deanonymize users. They appear to have been targeting people who operate or access Tor hidden services.\"</ref>\nIn summary, the attacking onion service directory node changed the headers of cells being relayed tagging them as \"relay\" or \"relay early\" cells differently to encode additional information and sent them back to the requesting user/operator. If the user's/operator's guard/entry node was also part of the attacking relays, the attacking relays might be able to capture the IP address of the user/operator along with the onion service information that the user/operator was requesting. The attacking relays were stable enough to achieve being designated as \"suitable as hidden service directory\" and \"suitable as entry guard\"; therefore, both the onion service users and the onion services might have used those relays as guards and hidden service directory nodes.<ref name=relay-early-attack>{{cite web | ref = harv | last = Dingledine | first = Roger | date = 30 July 2014 | title = Tor security advisory: \"relay early\" traffic confirmation attack | url = https://blog.torproject.org/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack | publisher = The Tor Project }}</ref>\n\nThe attacking nodes joined the network early in the year on 30 January and the project removed them on 4 July.<ref name=relay-early-attack /> \nAlthough when the attack began was unclear, the project implied that between February and July, onion service users' and operators' IP addresses might be exposed.<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"...we assume were trying to deanonymize users.

The attack probably also tried to learn who published hidden service descriptors, which would allow the attackers to learn the location of that hidden service... Hidden service operators should consider changing the location of their hidden service.\"</ref>\n\nThe project mentioned the following mitigations besides removing the attacking relays from the network:\n* patched relay software to prevent relays from relaying cells with \"relay early\" headers that were not intended.<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"Relays should upgrade to a recent Tor release (0.2.4.23 or 0.2.5.6-alpha), to close the particular protocol vulnerability the attackers used...\"</ref>\n* planned update for users' proxy software so that they could inspect if they received \"relay early\" cells from the relays (as they are not supposed to),<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"For expert users, the new Tor version warns you in your logs if a relay on your path injects any relay-early cells: look for the phrase 'Received an inbound RELAY_EARLY cell'\"</ref> along with the settings to connect to just one guard node instead of selecting randomly from 3 to reduce the probability of connecting to an attacking relay<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"Clients that upgrade (once new Tor Browser releases are ready) will take another step towards limiting the number of entry guards that are in a position to see their traffic, thus reducing the damage from future attacks like this one... 3) Put out a software update that will (once enough clients have upgraded) let us tell clients to move to using one entry guard rather than three, to reduce exposure to relays over time.\"</ref>\n* recommended that onion services might want to change their locations<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"Hidden service operators should consider changing the location of their hidden service.\"</ref>\n* reminded users and onion service operators that Tor could not prevent deanonymization if the attacker controlled or could listen to both ends of the Tor circuit, like in this attack.<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"...but remember that preventing traffic confirmation in general remains an open research problem.\"</ref>\n\nIn November 2014 there was speculation in the aftermath of [[Operation Onymous]], resulting in 17 arrests internationally, that a Tor weakness had been exploited. A representative of [[Europol]] was secretive about the method used, saying: \"''This is something we want to keep for ourselves.

In one way or another, human (user) errors can lead to detection. The Tor Project website provides the best practices (instructions) on how to properly use the Tor browser. When improperly used, Tor is not secure. For example, Tor warns its users that not all traffic is protected; only the traffic routed through the Tor browser is protected. Users are also warned to use https versions of websites, not to [[BitTorrent|torrent]] with Tor, not to enable browser plugins, not to open documents downloaded through Tor while online, and to use safe bridges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://torproject.org/|title=The Tor Project &#124; Privacy & Freedom Online|website=torproject.org}}</ref> Users are also warned that they cannot provide their name or other revealing information in web forums over Tor and stay anonymous at the same time.<ref name=stayan>{{cite web|title=Tor: Overview \u2013 Staying anonymous|url=https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en|accessdate=21 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nDespite intelligence agencies' claims that 80% of Tor users would be de-anonymized within 6 months in the year 2013,<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/08/building-a-new-tor-that-withstands-next-generation-state-surveillance/|title=Building a new Tor that can resist next-generation state surveillance|website=arstechnica.com|accessdate=13 September 2016|date=31 August 2016}}</ref> that has still not happened. In fact, as late as September 2016, the FBI could not locate, de-anonymize and identify the Tor user who hacked into the email account of a staffer on [[Hillary Clinton]]'s email server.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe best tactic of law enforcement agencies to de-anonymize users appears to remain with Tor-relay adversaries running poisoned nodes, as well as counting on the users themselves using the Tor browser improperly. E.g., downloading a video through the Tor browser and then opening the same file on an unprotected hard drive while online can make the users' real IP addresses available to authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/08/aussie-cops-ran-child-porn-site-for-months-revealed-30-us-ips/|title=Aussie cops ran child porn site for months, revealed 30 US IPs|website=arstechnica.com|accessdate=13 September 2016|date=16 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Odds of detection ===\nWhen properly used, odds of being de-anonymized through Tor are said to be extremely low. Tor project's cofounder Nick Mathewson recently explained that the problem of \"Tor-relay adversaries\" running poisoned nodes means that a theoretical adversary of this kind is not the network's greatest threat:\n\n{{quotation|\"No adversary is truly global, but no adversary needs to be truly global,\" he says. \"Eavesdropping on the entire Internet is a several-billion-dollar problem. Running a few computers to eavesdrop on a lot of traffic, a selective denial of service attack to drive traffic to your computers, that's like a tens-of-thousands-of-dollars problem.\" At the most basic level, an attacker who runs two poisoned Tor nodes\u2014one entry, one exit\u2014is able to analyse traffic and thereby identify the tiny, unlucky percentage of users whose circuit happened to cross both of those nodes. At present the Tor network offers, out of a total of around 7,000 relays, around 2,000 guard (entry) nodes and around 1,000 exit nodes. So the odds of such an event happening are one in two million (1/2000 x 1/1000), give or take.<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\"/>}}\n\nTor does not provide protection against [[Timing attack|end-to-end timing attack]]s: if an attacker can watch the traffic coming out of the target computer, and also the traffic arriving at the target's chosen destination (e.g. a server hosting a .onion site), that attacker can use statistical analysis to discover that they are part of the same circuit.<ref name=stayan/>\n\n=== Levels of security ===\nDepending on individual user needs, Tor browser offers three levels of security located under the Security Level (the small gray shield at the top-right of the screen) icon > Advanced Security Settings. In addition to encrypting the data, including constantly changing an IP address through a virtual circuit comprising successive, randomly selected Tor relays, several other layers of security are at a user's disposal:\n\n# '''Standard (default) \u2013 at this security level, all browser features are enabled.'''\n#* This level provides the most usable experience, and the lowest level of security.\n# '''Safer \u2013 at this security level, the following changes apply:'''\n#* JavaScript is disabled on non-HTTPS sites.\n#*On sites where JavaScript is enabled, performance optimizations are disabled.

The name is derived from an acronym for the original software project name \"The Onion Router\".<ref name=\"onion-router\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.torproject.org/about/why-is-it-called-tor|title=Why is it called Tor?|website=Tor Project &#124; Support|url-status=live|accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref> Tor directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer [[overlay network]] consisting of more than seven thousand relays<ref name=\"torstatus\" /> to conceal a user's location and usage from anyone conducting [[Computer and network surveillance#Network surveillance|network surveillance]] or [[Traffic analysis#In computer security|traffic analysis]]. Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace Internet activity to the user: this includes \"visits to Web sites, online posts, instant messages, and other communication forms\".<ref name=\"nyt-navels\" /> Tor's intended use is to protect the personal privacy of its users, as well as their freedom and ability to conduct confidential communication by keeping their Internet activities unmonitored.\n\nTor does not prevent an online service from determining when it is being accessed through Tor. Tor protects a user's privacy, but does not hide the fact that someone is using Tor. Some websites restrict allowances through Tor. For example, [[Wikipedia]] blocks attempts by Tor users to edit articles unless special permission is sought.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/10/world/europe/turkey-wikipedia-ban-recep-tayyip-erdogan.html|title=Turks Click Away, but Wikipedia Is Gone|last=Kingsley|first=Patrick|date=10 June 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=11 June 2017|url-access=limited|archive-url=https://archive.is/kGv45|archive-date=25 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Onion routing]] is implemented by [[encryption]] in the [[application layer]] of a [[communication protocol]] stack, nested like the layers of an [[onion]]. Tor encrypts the data, including the next node destination [[IP address]], multiple times and sends it through a [[virtual circuit]] comprising successive, random-selection Tor relays. Each relay decrypts a layer of [[encryption]] to reveal the next relay in the circuit to pass the remaining encrypted data on to it. The final relay decrypts the innermost layer of encryption and sends the original data to its destination without revealing or knowing the source IP address. Because the routing of the communication was partly concealed at every hop in the Tor circuit, this method eliminates any single point at which the communicating peers can be determined through [[Computer and network surveillance|network surveillance]] that relies upon knowing its source and destination.<ref name=\"Termanini2018\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVNPDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT210|title=The Nano Age of Digital Immunity Infrastructure Fundamentals and Applications: The Intelligent Cyber Shield for Smart Cities|last=Termanini|first=Rocky|publisher=CRC Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-351-68287-9|pages=210\u2013211|lccn=2017053798}}</ref>\n\nAn adversary may try to de-anonymize the user by some means.

It is an implementation of [[onion routing]], which encrypts and then randomly bounces communications through a network of relays run by volunteers around the globe. These onion routers employ [[encryption]] in a multi-layered manner (hence the onion metaphor) to ensure [[perfect forward secrecy]] between relays, thereby providing users with anonymity in a network location. That anonymity extends to the hosting of censorship-resistant content by Tor's anonymous onion service feature.<ref name=\"usenix-design\" /> Furthermore, by keeping some of the entry relays (bridge relays) secret, users can evade [[Internet censorship]] that relies upon blocking public Tor relays.<ref name=\"torproject-bridges\" />\n\nBecause the [[IP address]] of the sender and the recipient are not ''both'' in [[cleartext]] at any hop along the way, anyone eavesdropping at any point along the communication channel cannot directly identify both ends. Furthermore, to the recipient it appears that the last Tor [[Node (networking)|node]] (called the exit node), rather than the sender, is the originator of the communication.\n\n===Originating traffic===\n[[File:EtherApeTorScreenShot.png|thumb|A visual depiction of the traffic between some Tor relay [[Node (networking)|nodes]] from the [[open-source software|open-source]] [[packet sniffing]] program [[EtherApe]]]]\nA Tor user's [[SOCKS]]-aware applications can be configured to direct their network traffic through a Tor instance's SOCKS interface, which is listening on TCP port 9150 at [[localhost]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2018-12&post=TorPCAP---Tor-Network-Forensics |title= TorPCAP - Tor Network Forensics |website= Netresec |accessdate= 12 December 2018}}</ref> Tor periodically creates virtual circuits through the Tor network through which it can [[multiplexing|multiplex]] and onion-route that traffic to its destination. Once inside a Tor network, the traffic is sent from router to router along the circuit, ultimately reaching an exit node at which point the [[cleartext]] packet is available and is forwarded on to its original destination. Viewed from the destination, the traffic appears to originate at the Tor exit node.\n\n[[File:Tor-non-exit-relay-bandwidth-usage.jpg|thumb|A Tor non-exit relay with a maximum output of 239.69 kbit/s]]\nTor's application independence sets it apart from most other anonymity networks: it works at the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) stream level. Applications whose traffic is commonly anonymized using Tor include [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), [[instant messaging]], and [[World Wide Web]] browsing.\n\n===Onion services{{anchor|Hidden services}}===\n{{See also|List of Tor onion services}}\nTor can also provide anonymity to websites and other servers. Servers configured to receive inbound connections only through Tor are called '''onion services''' (formerly, '''hidden services''').<ref>{{cite web |last1=Winter |first1=Philipp |title=How Do Tor Users Interact With Onion Services? |url=https://nymity.ch/onion-services/pdf/sec18-onion-services.pdf |accessdate=27 December 2018}}</ref> Rather than revealing a server's IP address (and thus its network location), an onion service is accessed through its [[.onion|onion address]], usually via the [[#Tor Browser|Tor Browser]]. The Tor network understands these addresses by looking up their corresponding [[public key]]s and ''introduction points'' from a [[distributed hash table]] within the network. It can route data to and from onion services, even those hosted behind [[firewall (computing)|firewalls]] or [[network address translator]]s (NAT), while preserving the anonymity of both parties. Tor is necessary to access these onion services.<ref name=\"torproject-conf-hidden\" />\n\nOnion services were first specified in 2003<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mathewson|first1=Nick|title=Add first draft of rendezvous point document|url=https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/commit/?id=3d538f6d702937c23bec33b3bdd62ff9fba9d2a3|website=Tor Source Code|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref> and have been deployed on the Tor network since 2004.<ref name=\"or-locating\" /> Other than the database that stores the onion service descriptors,<ref name=\"torproject-hidden\" /> Tor is decentralized by design; there is no direct readable list of all onion services, although a number of onion services catalog publicly known onion addresses.\n\nBecause onion services route their traffic entirely through the Tor network, connection to an onion service is encrypted end-to-end and not subject to eavesdropping. There are, however, security issues involving Tor onion services. For example, services that are reachable through Tor onion services ''and'' the public Internet are susceptible to correlation attacks and thus not perfectly hidden. Other pitfalls include misconfigured services (e.g. identifying information included by default in web server error responses), uptime and downtime statistics, intersection attacks, and user error.<ref name=\"torproject-hidden\" /><ref name=\"register-embassy-passwd\" /> The [[open-source software|open source]] OnionScan program, written by independent security researcher [[Sarah Jamie Lewis]], comprehensively examines onion services for numerous flaws and vulnerabilities.<ref name=\"OnionScan\">{{Cite web |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kb7bg3/onionscan-checks-if-your-dark-web-site-really-is-anonymous |title=A Tool to Check If Your Dark Web Site Really Is Anonymous: 'OnionScan' will probe dark web sites for security weaknesses\n |last=Cox |first=Joseph |date=6 April 2016 |website=Motherboard |access-date=7 July 2017}}</ref> (Lewis has also pioneered the field of onion dildonics, inasmuch as [[sex toy]]s can be insecurely connected over the Internet.)<ref name=\"Onion Dildonics\">{{Cite journal |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sex-toy-bluetooth-hacks-security-fix |title=keep getting hacked \u2013 but Tor could be the answer to safer connected sex Connected sex toys are gathering huge amounts of data about our most intimate moments.

While Tor does provide protection against [[traffic analysis]], it cannot prevent traffic confirmation (also called ''end-to-end correlation'').<ref name=\"torproject-one-cell\" /><ref name=\"torproject-fail-both-ends\" />\n\nIn spite of known weaknesses and attacks listed here, a 2009 study revealed Tor and the alternative network system [[Java Anon Proxy|JonDonym]] (Java Anon Proxy, JAP) are considered more resilient to website fingerprinting techniques than other [[tunneling protocol]]s.\n\nThe reason for this is conventional single-hop [[VPN]] protocols do not need to reconstruct packet data nearly as much as a multi-hop service like Tor or JonDonym. Website fingerprinting yielded greater than 90% accuracy for identifying [[HTTP]] packets on conventional VPN protocols versus Tor which yielded only 2.96% accuracy. However, some protocols like [[OpenSSH]] and [[OpenVPN]] required a large amount of data before HTTP packets were identified.<ref name=\"ccsw-attacking\" />\n\nResearchers from the [[University of Michigan]] developed a network scanner allowing identification of 86% of live Tor \"bridges\" with a single scan.<ref name=\"twe-zmap\"/>\n\n===Eavesdropping===\n\n==== Autonomous system (AS) eavesdropping ====\nIf an [[Autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]] (AS) exists on both path segments from a client to entry relay and from exit relay to destination, such an AS can statistically correlate traffic on the entry and exit segments of the path and potentially infer the destination with which the client communicated. In 2012, LASTor proposed a method to predict a set of potential ASes on these two segments and then avoid choosing this path during the path selection algorithm on the client side. In this paper, they also improve latency by choosing shorter geographical paths between a client and destination.<ref name=\"LASTor-2012\" />\n\n==== Exit node eavesdropping ====\nIn September 2007, Dan Egerstad, a Swedish security consultant, revealed he had intercepted usernames and passwords for e-mail accounts by operating and monitoring Tor exit nodes.<ref name=\"wired-rogue-nodes\" /> As Tor cannot encrypt the traffic between an exit node and the target server, any exit node is in a position to capture traffic passing through it that does not use [[end-to-end encryption]] such as [[Secure Sockets Layer]] (SSL) or [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS). While this may not inherently breach the anonymity of the source, traffic intercepted in this way by self-selected third parties can expose information about the source in either or both of payload and protocol data.<ref name=\"sf-tor-hack\" /> Furthermore, Egerstad is circumspect about the possible subversion of Tor by intelligence agencies:<ref name=\"smh-hack-of-year\" />\n\n{{quote|\"If you actually look in to where these Tor nodes are hosted and how big they are, some of these nodes cost thousands of dollars each month just to host because they're using lots of bandwidth, they're heavy-duty servers and so on. Who would pay for this and be anonymous?\"}}\n\nIn October 2011, a research team from [[ESIEA (university)|ESIEA]] claimed to have discovered a way to compromise the Tor network by decrypting communication passing over it.<ref name=\"thn-compromised\" /><ref name=\"01-chercheurs\" /> The technique they describe requires creating a map of Tor network nodes, controlling one-third of them, and then acquiring their encryption [[Key (cryptography)|keys]] and algorithm [[Random seed|seeds]]. Then, using these known keys and seeds, they claim the ability to decrypt two encryption layers out of three. They claim to break the third key by a statistical attack. In order to redirect Tor traffic to the nodes they controlled, they used a [[denial-of-service]] attack. A response to this claim has been published on the official Tor Blog stating these rumours of Tor's compromise are greatly exaggerated.<ref name=\"torproject-rumors-exaggerated\" />\n\n===Traffic-analysis attack===\nThere are two methods of traffic-analysis attack, passive and active. In the passive traffic-analysis method, the attacker extracts features from the traffic of a specific flow on one side of the network and looks for those features on the other side of the network. In the active traffic-analysis method, the attacker alters the timings of the packets of a flow according to a specific pattern and looks for that pattern on the other side of the network; therefore, the attacker can link the flows in one side to the other side of the network and break the anonymity of it.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Soltani|first=Ramin|last2=Goeckel|first2=Dennis|last3=Towsley|first3=Don|last4=Houmansadr|first4=Amir|date=27 November 2017|arxiv=1711.10079|doi=10.1109/ACSSC.2017.8335179|title=2017 51st Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers|pages=258\u2013262|isbn=978-1-5386-1823-3}}</ref> It is shown, although timing noise is added to the packets, there are active traffic analysis methods robust against such a noise.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Steven Murdoch]] and George Danezis from [[University of Cambridge]] presented an article at the 2005 [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] [[Symposium]] on security and privacy on traffic-analysis techniques that allow adversaries with only a partial view of the network to infer which nodes are being used to relay the anonymous streams.<ref name=\"ieee-low-cost\" /> These techniques greatly reduce the anonymity provided by Tor. Murdoch and Danezis have also shown that otherwise unrelated streams can be linked back to the same initiator. This attack, however, fails to reveal the identity of the original user.<ref name=\"ieee-low-cost\" /> Murdoch has been working with and has been funded by Tor since 2006.\n\n===Tor exit node block===\nOperators of Internet sites have the ability to prevent traffic from Tor exit nodes or to offer reduced functionality for Tor users. For example, it is not generally possible to edit [[Wikipedia]] when using Tor or when using an IP address also used by a Tor exit node. The [[BBC]] blocks the IP addresses of all known Tor guards and exit nodes from its [[iPlayer]] service, although relays and bridges are not blocked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/help/troubleshooting/tv-games-consoles/in_the_uk_message|title=BBC iPlayer Help \u2013 Why does BBC iPlayer think I'm outside the UK?|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=10 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Bad apple attack===\nIn March 2011, researchers with the Rocquencourt [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation]] (Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique, INRIA), documented an attack that is capable of revealing the IP addresses of [[BitTorrent]] users on the Tor network. The \"bad apple attack\" exploits Tor's design and takes advantage of insecure application use to associate the simultaneous use of a secure application with the IP address of the Tor user in question. One method of attack depends on control of an exit node or hijacking tracker responses, while a secondary attack method is based in part on the statistical exploitation of [[distributed hash table]] tracking.<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" /> According to the study:<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" />\n\nThe results presented in the bad apple attack research paper are based on an attack in the wild launched against the Tor network by the authors of the study. The attack targeted six exit nodes, lasted for twenty-three days, and revealed a total of 10,000 IP addresses of active Tor users. This study is significant because it is the first documented attack designed to target [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] file-sharing applications on Tor.<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" /> BitTorrent may generate as much as 40% of all traffic on Tor.<ref name=\"shining-light\" /> Furthermore, the bad apple attack is effective against insecure use of any application over Tor, not just BitTorrent.<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" />\n\n===Some protocols expose IP addresses===\nResearchers from the [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation]] (INRIA) showed that the Tor dissimulation technique in [[BitTorrent]] can be bypassed by attackers controlling a Tor exit node. The study was conducted by monitoring six exit nodes for a period of twenty-three days. Researches used three [[attack vector]]s:<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />\n;Inspection of BitTorrent control messages: Tracker announces and extension protocol handshakes may optionally contain a client [[IP address]]. Analysis of collected data revealed that 35% and 33% of messages, respectively, contained addresses of clients.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />{{rp|3}}\n;Hijacking trackers' responses: Due to lack of encryption or authentication in communication between the tracker and peer, typical [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s allow attackers to determine peer IP addresses and even verify the distribution of content. Such attacks work when Tor is used only for tracker communication.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />{{rp|4}}\n;Exploiting distributed hash tables (DHT): This attack exploits the fact that [[distributed hash table]] (DHT) connections through Tor are impossible, so an attacker is able to reveal a target's IP address by looking it up in the DHT even if the target uses Tor to connect to other peers.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\nWith this technique, researchers were able to identify other streams initiated by users, whose IP addresses were revealed.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />\n\n===Sniper attack===\nJansen ''et al''., describes a [[DDoS]] attack targeted at the Tor node software, as well as defenses against that attack and its variants. The attack works using a colluding client and server, and filling the queues of the exit node until the node runs out of memory, and hence can serve no other (genuine) clients. By attacking a significant proportion of the exit nodes this way, an attacker can degrade the network and increase the chance of targets using nodes controlled by the attacker.<ref name=\"andssy-sniper\" />\n\n===Heartbleed bug===\nThe [[Heartbleed]] [[OpenSSL]] [[Software bug|bug]] disrupted the Tor network for several days in April 2014 while [[private key]]s were renewed. The Tor Project recommended Tor relay operators and onion service operators revoke and generate fresh keys after patching OpenSSL, but noted Tor relays use two sets of keys and Tor's multi-hop design minimizes the impact of exploiting a single relay.<ref name=\"torproject-openssl-cve\" /> 586 relays later found to be susceptible to the Heartbleed bug were taken offline as a precautionary measure.<ref name=\"ml-rejecting\" /><ref name=\"torproject-news-20140416\" /><ref name=\"ars-ranks-cut\" /><ref name=\"tp-blacklisting\" />\n{{anchor |Relay early attack}}<!-- there are links here; please don't move/remove without fixing the links -->\n\n=== Relay early traffic confirmation attack ===\nOn 30 July 2014 the Tor Project issued the security advisory \"relay early traffic confirmation attack\" in which the project discovered a group of relays that tried to deanonymize onion service users and operators.<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"On July 4, 2014 we found a group of relays that we assume were trying to deanonymize users. They appear to have been targeting people who operate or access Tor hidden services.\"</ref>\nIn summary, the attacking onion service directory node changed the headers of cells being relayed tagging them as \"relay\" or \"relay early\" cells differently to encode additional information and sent them back to the requesting user/operator. If the user's/operator's guard/entry node was also part of the attacking relays, the attacking relays might be able to capture the IP address of the user/operator along with the onion service information that the user/operator was requesting. The attacking relays were stable enough to achieve being designated as \"suitable as hidden service directory\" and \"suitable as entry guard\"; therefore, both the onion service users and the onion services might have used those relays as guards and hidden service directory nodes.<ref name=relay-early-attack>{{cite web | ref = harv | last = Dingledine | first = Roger | date = 30 July 2014 | title = Tor security advisory: \"relay early\" traffic confirmation attack | url = https://blog.torproject.org/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack | publisher = The Tor Project }}</ref>\n\nThe attacking nodes joined the network early in the year on 30 January and the project removed them on 4 July.<ref name=relay-early-attack /> \nAlthough when the attack began was unclear, the project implied that between February and July, onion service users' and operators' IP addresses might be exposed.<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"...we assume were trying to deanonymize users. They appear to have been targeting people who operate or access Tor hidden services... users who operated or accessed hidden services from early February through July 4 should assume they were affected...

The attack probably also tried to learn who published hidden service descriptors, which would allow the attackers to learn the location of that hidden service... Hidden service operators should consider changing the location of their hidden service.\"</ref>\n\nThe project mentioned the following mitigations besides removing the attacking relays from the network:\n* patched relay software to prevent relays from relaying cells with \"relay early\" headers that were not intended.<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"Relays should upgrade to a recent Tor release (0.2.4.23 or 0.2.5.6-alpha), to close the particular protocol vulnerability the attackers used...\"</ref>\n* planned update for users' proxy software so that they could inspect if they received \"relay early\" cells from the relays (as they are not supposed to),<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"For expert users, the new Tor version warns you in your logs if a relay on your path injects any relay-early cells: look for the phrase 'Received an inbound RELAY_EARLY cell'\"</ref> along with the settings to connect to just one guard node instead of selecting randomly from 3 to reduce the probability of connecting to an attacking relay<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"Clients that upgrade (once new Tor Browser releases are ready) will take another step towards limiting the number of entry guards that are in a position to see their traffic, thus reducing the damage from future attacks like this one... 3) Put out a software update that will (once enough clients have upgraded) let us tell clients to move to using one entry guard rather than three, to reduce exposure to relays over time.\"</ref>\n* recommended that onion services might want to change their locations<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"Hidden service operators should consider changing the location of their hidden service.\"</ref>\n* reminded users and onion service operators that Tor could not prevent deanonymization if the attacker controlled or could listen to both ends of the Tor circuit, like in this attack.<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"...but remember that preventing traffic confirmation in general remains an open research problem.\"</ref>\n\nIn November 2014 there was speculation in the aftermath of [[Operation Onymous]], resulting in 17 arrests internationally, that a Tor weakness had been exploited. A representative of [[Europol]] was secretive about the method used, saying: \"''This is something we want to keep for ourselves.

In one way or another, human (user) errors can lead to detection. The Tor Project website provides the best practices (instructions) on how to properly use the Tor browser. When improperly used, Tor is not secure. For example, Tor warns its users that not all traffic is protected; only the traffic routed through the Tor browser is protected. Users are also warned to use https versions of websites, not to [[BitTorrent|torrent]] with Tor, not to enable browser plugins, not to open documents downloaded through Tor while online, and to use safe bridges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://torproject.org/|title=The Tor Project &#124; Privacy & Freedom Online|website=torproject.org}}</ref> Users are also warned that they cannot provide their name or other revealing information in web forums over Tor and stay anonymous at the same time.<ref name=stayan>{{cite web|title=Tor: Overview \u2013 Staying anonymous|url=https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en|accessdate=21 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nDespite intelligence agencies' claims that 80% of Tor users would be de-anonymized within 6 months in the year 2013,<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/08/building-a-new-tor-that-withstands-next-generation-state-surveillance/|title=Building a new Tor that can resist next-generation state surveillance|website=arstechnica.com|accessdate=13 September 2016|date=31 August 2016}}</ref> that has still not happened. In fact, as late as September 2016, the FBI could not locate, de-anonymize and identify the Tor user who hacked into the email account of a staffer on [[Hillary Clinton]]'s email server.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe best tactic of law enforcement agencies to de-anonymize users appears to remain with Tor-relay adversaries running poisoned nodes, as well as counting on the users themselves using the Tor browser improperly. E.g., downloading a video through the Tor browser and then opening the same file on an unprotected hard drive while online can make the users' real IP addresses available to authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/08/aussie-cops-ran-child-porn-site-for-months-revealed-30-us-ips/|title=Aussie cops ran child porn site for months, revealed 30 US IPs|website=arstechnica.com|accessdate=13 September 2016|date=16 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Odds of detection ===\nWhen properly used, odds of being de-anonymized through Tor are said to be extremely low. Tor project's cofounder Nick Mathewson recently explained that the problem of \"Tor-relay adversaries\" running poisoned nodes means that a theoretical adversary of this kind is not the network's greatest threat:\n\n{{quotation|\"No adversary is truly global, but no adversary needs to be truly global,\" he says. \"Eavesdropping on the entire Internet is a several-billion-dollar problem. Running a few computers to eavesdrop on a lot of traffic, a selective denial of service attack to drive traffic to your computers, that's like a tens-of-thousands-of-dollars problem.\" At the most basic level, an attacker who runs two poisoned Tor nodes\u2014one entry, one exit\u2014is able to analyse traffic and thereby identify the tiny, unlucky percentage of users whose circuit happened to cross both of those nodes. At present the Tor network offers, out of a total of around 7,000 relays, around 2,000 guard (entry) nodes and around 1,000 exit nodes. So the odds of such an event happening are one in two million (1/2000 x 1/1000), give or take.<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\"/>}}\n\nTor does not provide protection against [[Timing attack|end-to-end timing attack]]s: if an attacker can watch the traffic coming out of the target computer, and also the traffic arriving at the target's chosen destination (e.g. a server hosting a .onion site), that attacker can use statistical analysis to discover that they are part of the same circuit.<ref name=stayan/>\n\n=== Levels of security ===\nDepending on individual user needs, Tor browser offers three levels of security located under the Security Level (the small gray shield at the top-right of the screen) icon > Advanced Security Settings. In addition to encrypting the data, including constantly changing an IP address through a virtual circuit comprising successive, randomly selected Tor relays, several other layers of security are at a user's disposal:\n\n# '''Standard (default) \u2013 at this security level, all browser features are enabled.'''\n#* This level provides the most usable experience, and the lowest level of security.\n# '''Safer \u2013 at this security level, the following changes apply:'''\n#* JavaScript is disabled on non-HTTPS sites.\n#*On sites where JavaScript is enabled, performance optimizations are disabled. Scripts on some sites may run slower.\n#* Some mechanisms of displaying math equations are disabled.\n#* Audio and video (HTML5 media), and WebGL are click-to-play.\n# '''Safest \u2013 at this security level, these additional changes apply:'''\n#* JavaScript is disabled by default on all sites.\n#* Some fonts, icons, math symbols, and images are disabled.\n#* Audio and video (HTML5 media),

A determination of a neurological problem must be made by a trained physician, and must not be due to a postnatal insult, such as [[meningitis]], [[concussion]], [[traumatic brain injury]], etc.\n\nAll four diagnostic systems show virtual agreement on their criteria for CNS damage at the neurological level, and evidence of a CNS neurological impairment due to prenatal alcohol exposure will result in a diagnosis of FAS or pFAS, and functional impairments are highly likely.<ref name=Canadian/><ref name=IOM/><ref name=4digitcode/><ref name=CDC/>\n\nNeurological problems are expressed as either hard signs, or diagnosable disorders, such as [[epilepsy]] or other [[seizure disorder]]s, or soft signs. Soft signs are broader, nonspecific neurological impairments, or symptoms, such as impaired [[fine motor skills]], [[sensory processing disorder|neurosensory]] [[hearing loss]], poor [[Gait (human)|gait]], [[developmental coordination disorder|clumsiness]], and poor [[Hand-eye coordination|hand - eye coordination]].  Many soft signs have [[Norm-referenced test|norm-referenced criteria]], while others are determined through clinical judgment.  \"Clinical judgment\" is only as good as the clinician, and soft signs should be assessed by either a pediatric neurologist, a pediatric neuropsychologist, or both.\n\n====Functional====\nWhen structural or neurological impairments are not observed, all four diagnostic systems allow CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure to be assessed in terms of functional impairments.<ref name=Canadian/><ref name=IOM/><ref name=4digitcode/><ref name=CDC/> Functional impairments are deficits, problems, delays, or abnormalities due to prenatal alcohol exposure (rather than hereditary causes or postnatal insults) in observable and measurable domains related to daily functioning, often referred to as [[developmental disabilities]]. There is no consensus on a specific pattern of functional impairments due to prenatal alcohol exposure<ref name=IOM/> and only CDC guidelines label developmental delays as such,<ref name=CDC/> so criteria (and FASD diagnoses) vary somewhat across diagnostic systems.\n\nThe four diagnostic systems list various CNS domains that can qualify for functional impairment that can determine an FASD diagnosis:\n\n* Evidence of a complex pattern of behavior or cognitive abnormalities inconsistent with developmental level in the following CNS domains \u2013 Sufficient for a pFAS or ARND diagnosis using IOM guidelines<ref name=IOM/>\n** [[Learning disability|Learning disabilities]], academic achievement, [[Deferred gratification|impulse control]], [[Social learning (social pedagogy)|social perception]], [[communication]], [[abstraction]], math skills, [[memory]], [[attention]], judgment\n* Performance at two or more [[standard deviation]]s on [[standardized testing]] in three or more of the following CNS domains \u2013 Sufficient for an FAS, pFAS or static encephalopathy diagnosis using 4-Digit Diagnostic Code<ref name=4digitcode/>\n** [[Executive functioning]], [[memory]], [[cognition]], [[Adaptive behavior|social/adaptive skills]], academic achievement, [[communication|language]], [[motor skill]]s, [[attention]], activity level\n* General [[cognitive]] deficits (e.g., [[IQ]]) at or below the 3rd percentile on [[standardized testing]] \u2013 Sufficient for an FAS diagnosis using CDC guidelines<ref name=CDC/>\n* Performance at or below the 16th percentile on [[standardized testing]] in three or more of the following CNS domains \u2013 Sufficient for an FAS diagnosis using CDC guidelines<ref name=CDC/>\n** [[Cognition]], [[executive functioning]], [[motor skill|motor functioning]], [[ADHD|attention and hyperactive problems]], [[social skills]], [[sensory processing disorder]], social [[communication]], [[memory]], difficulties responding to common [[parenting]] practices\n* Performance at two or more [[standard deviation]]s on [[standardized testing]] in three or more of the following CNS domains \u2013 Sufficient for an FAS diagnosis using Canadian guidelines\n** Cognition, [[communication]], academic achievement, [[memory]], [[executive functioning]], [[adaptive behavior]], [[motor skills]], [[social skills]], social [[communication]]\n\n===Related signs===\nOther conditions may commonly co-occur with FAS, stemming from prenatal alcohol exposure.

On the contrary, clinical and animal studies have identified a broad spectrum of pathways through which maternal alcohol can negatively affect the outcome of a pregnancy.

The so-called placental barrier is practically absent with respect to ethanol.\n# The developing fetal nervous system appears particularly sensitive to ethanol toxicity. The latter interferes with proliferation, differentiation, neuronal migration, axonic outgrowth, integration, and fine-tuning of the synaptic network. In short, all major processes in the developing central nervous system appear compromised.\n# Fetal tissues are quite different from adult tissues in function and purpose.  For example, the main detoxicating organ in adults is the [[Human liver|liver]], whereas the fetal liver is incapable of detoxifying ethanol, as the ADH and ALDH enzymes have not yet been brought to expression at this early stage.  Up to term, fetal tissues do not have significant capacity for the detoxification of ethanol, and the [[fetus]] remains exposed to ethanol in the amniotic fluid for periods far longer than the decay time of ethanol in the maternal circulation. The lack of significant quantities of ADH and ALDH means that fetal tissues have much lower quantities of antioxidant enzymes, like [[Superoxide dismutase|SOD]], glutathione transferases, and [[Glutathione peroxidase|glutathion peroxidases]], resulting in antioxidant protection being much less effective.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nBecause admission of alcohol use during pregnancy can stigmatize birth mothers, many are reluctant to admit drinking or to provide an accurate report of the quantity they drank. This complicates diagnosis and treatment of the syndrome.<ref name=CDC/> As a result, diagnosis of the severity of FASD relies on protocols of observation of the child's physiology and behavior rather than maternal self-reporting. \nPresently, four FASD diagnostic systems that diagnose FAS and other FASD conditions have been developed in North America:\n* The [[Institute of Medicine]]'s guidelines for FAS, the first system to standardize diagnoses of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure;<ref name =IOM/>\n* The [[University of Washington]]'s \"The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code\", which ranks the four key features of FASD on a [[Likert scale]] of one to four and yields 256 descriptive codes that can be categorized into 22 distinct clinical categories, ranging from FAS to no findings;<ref name=4digitcode/>\n* The [[Centers for Disease Control]]'s \"Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis\", which established consensus on the diagnosis FAS in the U.S. but deferred addressing other FASD conditions;<ref name=CDC>[https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/documents/FAS_guidelines_accessible.pdf Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis (PDF).] CDC (July 2004).  Retrieved on 2019-10-19</ref> and\n* Canadian guidelines for FASD diagnoses, which established criteria for diagnosing FASD in Canada and harmonized most differences between the IOM and University of Washington's systems.<ref name=Canadian>{{Cite journal|last=Chudley|title=Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: Canadian guidelines for diagnosis|journal=CMAJ|volume=172|issue=5 Suppl|pages=S1\u2013S21|year=2005|pmid=15738468|doi=10.1503/cmaj.1040302|pmc=557121|display-authors=etal|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nEach diagnostic system requires that a complete FASD evaluation includes an assessment of the four key features of FASD, described below. A positive finding on all four features is required for a diagnosis of FAS. However, prenatal alcohol exposure and central nervous system damage are the critical elements of the spectrum of FASD, and a positive finding in these two features is sufficient for an FASD diagnosis that is not \"full-blown FAS\".\n\nWhile the four diagnostic systems essentially agree on criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), there are still differences when full criteria for FAS are not met. This has resulted in differing and evolving nomenclature for other conditions across the spectrum of FASD, which may account for such a wide variety of terminology. Most individuals with deficits resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure do not express all features of FAS and fall into other FASD conditions.<ref name =IOM/> The Canadian guidelines recommend the assessment and descriptive approach of the \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" for each key feature of FASD and the terminology of the IOM in diagnostic categories, excepting ARBD.<ref name=Canadian/>\n\nThus, other FASD conditions are partial expressions of FAS. However, these other FASD conditions may create disabilities similar to FAS if the key area of central nervous system damage shows clinical deficits in two or more of [[Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder#Ten brain domains|ten domains of brain functioning]]. Essentially, even though growth deficiency and/or FAS facial features may be mild or nonexistent in other FASD conditions, yet clinically significant brain damage of the central nervous system is present. In these other FASD conditions, an individual may be at greater risk for adverse outcomes because brain damage is present without associated visual cues of poor growth or the \"FAS face\" that might ordinarily trigger an FASD evaluation. Such individuals may be misdiagnosed with primary [[DSM-IV Codes|mental health disorders]] such as [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] or [[oppositional defiance disorder]] without appreciation that brain damage is the underlying cause of these disorders, which requires a different treatment paradigm than typical mental health disorders. While other FASD conditions may not yet be included as an [[ICD]] or [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV-TR]] diagnosis, they nonetheless pose significant impairment in [[Adaptive behavior|functional behavior]] because of underlying brain damage.\n\n===Fetal alcohol syndrome===\nThe following criteria must be fully met for an FAS diagnosis:<ref name =Canadian/><ref name =IOM/><ref name =4digitcode/><ref name =CDC/>\n\n# Growth deficiency: Prenatal or postnatal height or weight (or both) at or below the 10th percentile<ref name=\"growthchart\"/>\n# FAS facial features: All three FAS facial features present<ref name =facial/>\n# Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural neurological, ''or'' functional impairment\n# Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed or Unknown prenatal alcohol exposure\n\nFetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the first diagnosable condition of FASD that was discovered. FAS is the only expression of FASD that has garnered consensus among experts to become an official [[ICD-9]] and [[ICD-10]] diagnosis. To make this diagnosis or determine any FASD condition, a [[Interdisciplinarity|multi-disciplinary]] evaluation is necessary to assess each of the four key features for assessment. Generally, a trained [[physician]] will determine growth deficiency and FAS facial features. While a qualified physician may also assess central nervous system structural abnormalities and/or neurological problems, usually central nervous system damage is determined through [[Psychological testing|psychological]], [[Speech pathology|speech-language]], and [[occupational therapy]] assessments to ascertain clinically significant impairments in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains.<ref name =Lang/> Prenatal alcohol exposure risk may be assessed by a qualified physician, [[psychologist]], [[social work]]er, or chemical health counselor. These professionals work together as a team to assess and interpret data of each key feature for assessment and develop an integrative, multi-disciplinary report to diagnose FAS (or other FASD conditions) in an individual.\n\n===Partial FAS===\nPartial FAS (pFAS) was previously known as atypical FAS in the 1997 edition of the \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\". People with pFAS have a confirmed history of prenatal alcohol exposure, but may lack growth deficiency or the complete facial stigmata. Central nervous system damage is present at the same level as FAS. These individuals have the same functional disabilities but \"look\" less like FAS.\n\nThe following criteria must be fully met for a diagnosis of Partial FAS:<ref name =Canadian/><ref name =IOM/><ref name =4digitcode/>\n\n# Growth deficiency: Growth or height may range from normal to deficient<ref name =growthchart/>\n# FAS facial features: Two or three FAS facial features present<ref name =facial/>\n# Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural, neurological, ''or'' functional impairment in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains<ref name =Lang/>\n# Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure\n\n===Fetal alcohol effects===\nFetal alcohol effects (FAE) is a previous term for alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder and alcohol-related birth defects.<ref name=CDC2015Fact/> It was initially used in research studies to describe humans and animals in whom teratogenic effects were seen after confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure (or unknown exposure for humans), but without obvious physical anomalies.<ref name =FAE/> Smith (1981) described FAE as an \"extremely important concept\" to highlight the debilitating effects of brain damage, regardless of the growth or facial features.<ref name =FAESmith>{{cite journal | author = Smith D.W. | year = 1981 | title = Fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects | url = | journal = Neurobehavioral Toxicology and Teratology | volume = 3 | issue = | page = 127 }}</ref> This term has fallen out of favor with clinicians because it was often regarded by the public as a less severe disability than FAS, when in fact its effects can be just as detrimental.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Aase J.M. |author2=Jones K.L. |author3=Clarren S.K. | year = 1995 | title = Do we need the term FAE? | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 95 | issue = 3| pages = 428\u2013430 | pmid = 7862486 }}</ref>\n\n====Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder====\nAlcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) was initially suggested by the Institute of Medicine to replace the term FAE and focus on central nervous system damage, rather than growth deficiency or FAS facial features. The Canadian guidelines also use this diagnosis and the same criteria. While the \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" includes these criteria for three of its diagnostic categories, it refers to this condition as [[encephalopathy|static encephalopathy]]. The behavioral effects of ARND are not necessarily unique to alcohol however, so use of the term must be within the context of confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure.<ref name =FASGuide/> ARND may be gaining acceptance over the terms FAE and ARBD to describe FASD conditions with central nervous system abnormalities or behavioral or cognitive abnormalities or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure without regard to growth deficiency or FAS facial features.<ref name =FASGuide/><ref name =MalbinTry>Malbin, D.

The \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" further distinguishes confirmed exposure as ''High Risk'' and ''Some Risk'':\n\n* High Risk: Confirmed use of alcohol during pregnancy known to be at high [[blood alcohol content|blood alcohol levels]] (100&nbsp;mg/dL or greater) delivered at least weekly in early pregnancy.\n* Some Risk: Confirmed use of alcohol during pregnancy with use less than High Risk or unknown usage patterns.\n* Unknown Risk: Unknown use of alcohol during pregnancy.\n* No Risk: Confirmed absence of prenatal alcohol exposure.\n\n====Confirmed exposure====\nAmount, frequency, and timing of prenatal alcohol use can dramatically impact the other three key features of FASD. While consensus exists that alcohol is a teratogen, there is no clear consensus as to what level of exposure is toxic.<ref name=IOM/> The CDC guidelines are silent on these elements diagnostically. The IOM and Canadian guidelines explore this further, acknowledging the importance of significant alcohol exposure from regular or heavy episodic alcohol consumption in determining, but offer no standard for diagnosis. Canadian guidelines discuss this lack of clarity and parenthetically point out that \"heavy alcohol use\" is defined by the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] as five or more drinks per episode on five or more days during a 30-day period.<ref>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (2000). National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. ''Tenth special report to the U.S Congress on alcohol and health: Highlights frfom current research''. Washington, DC: The Institute.</ref>\n\n\"The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" ranking system distinguishes between levels of prenatal alcohol exposure as ''high risk'' and ''some risk''. It operationalizes high risk exposure as a [[blood alcohol content|blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) greater than 100&nbsp;mg/dL delivered at least weekly in early pregnancy. This BAC level is typically reached by a 55&nbsp;kg female drinking six to eight beers in one sitting.<ref name =4digitcode/>\n\n====Unknown exposure====\nFor many adopted or adults and children in foster care, records or other reliable sources may not be available for review. Reporting alcohol use during pregnancy can also be stigmatizing to birth mothers, especially if alcohol use is ongoing.<ref name=CDC/> In these cases, all diagnostic systems use an unknown prenatal alcohol exposure designation. A diagnosis of FAS is still possible with an unknown exposure level if other key features of FASD are present at clinical levels.\n\n====Confirmed absence of exposure====\nConfirmed absence of exposure would apply to planned pregnancies in which no alcohol was used or pregnancies of women who do not use alcohol or report no use during the pregnancy. This designation is relatively rare, as most people presenting for an FASD evaluation are at least ''suspected'' to have had a prenatal alcohol exposure due to presence of other key features of FASD.<ref name =4digitcode/><ref name =CDC/>\n\n==== Biomarkers ====\nEvidence is insufficient for the use of chemical biomarkers to detect prenatal alcohol exposure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McQuire|first=C.|last2=Paranjothy|first2=S.|last3=Hurt|first3=L.|last4=Mann|first4=M.|last5=Farewell|first5=D.|last6=Kemp|first6=A.|date=2016-09-01|title=Objective Measures of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure: A Systematic Review|journal=Pediatrics|volume=138|issue=3|pages=e20160517|doi=10.1542/peds.2016-0517|issn=0031-4005|pmid=27577579}}</ref> Biomarkers being studied include fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) detected in the meconium (first feces of an infant) and hair.

The proposed framework attempts to harmonize IOM, 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, CDC, and Canadian guidelines for measuring CNS damage vis-\u00e0-vis FASD evaluations and diagnosis.

Early intervention from birth to age 3 has been shown to improve the development of a child born with FASD.<ref name=\":0\" /> Because CNS damage, symptoms, secondary disabilities, and needs vary widely by individual, there is no one treatment type that works for everyone.\n\n===Medication===\n[[Psychoactive drug]]s are frequently tried on those with FASD as many FASD symptoms are mistaken for or overlap with other disorders, most notably [[ADHD]].<ref name=Buxton/>\n\n===Behavioral interventions===\n[[Behaviorism|Behavioral]] interventions are based on the [[Learning theory (education)|learning theory]], which is the basis for many parenting and [[Psychology|professional]] strategies and interventions.<ref name=MalbinTry/> Along with ordinary [[parenting styles]], such strategies are frequently used by default for treating those with FAS, as the diagnoses [[oppositional defiance disorder]] (ODD), [[conduct disorder]], [[reactive attachment disorder]] (RAD) often overlap with FAS (along with [[ADHD]]), and these are sometimes thought to benefit from behavioral interventions. Frequently, a person's poor academic achievement results in [[special education]] services, which also utilizes principles of [[Learning theory (education)|learning theory]], [[behavior modification]], and [[outcome-based education]].\n\n===Developmental framework===\nMany books and handouts on FAS recommend a developmental approach, based on [[developmental psychology]], even though most do not specify it as such and provide little theoretical background. Optimal human development generally occurs in identifiable stages (e.g., [[Jean Piaget]]'s [[theory of cognitive development]], [[Erik Erikson]]'s [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of psychosocial development]], [[John Bowlby]]'s [[Attachment theory|attachment framework]], and other [[developmental stage theories]]). FAS interferes with normal development,<ref name=McCreight/> which may cause stages to be delayed, skipped, or immaturely developed. Over time, an unaffected child can negotiate the increasing demands of life by progressing through stages of development normally, but not so for a child with FAS.<ref name=McCreight/>\n\nBy knowing what developmental stages and tasks children follow, treatment and interventions for FAS can be tailored to helping a person meet developmental tasks and demands successfully.<ref name=McCreight/> If a person is delayed in the [[adaptive behavior]] domain, for instance, then interventions would be recommended to target specific delays through additional education and practice (e.g., practiced instruction on tying shoelaces), giving reminders, or making accommodations (e.g., using slip-on shoes) to support the desired functioning level. This approach is an advance over behavioral interventions, because it takes the person's developmental context into account while developing interventions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n===Advocacy model===\nThe [[advocacy]] model takes the point of view that someone is needed to actively mediate between the environment and the person with FAS.<ref name=FASGuide/> Advocacy activities are conducted by an advocate (for example, a family member, friend, or [[Case management (mental health)|case manager]]) and fall into three basic categories. An advocate for FAS: (1) interprets FAS and the disabilities that arise from it and explains it to the environment in which the person operates, (2) engenders change or accommodation on behalf of the person, and (3) assists the person in developing and reaching attainable goals.<ref name=FASGuide/>\n\nThe advocacy model is often recommended, for example, when developing an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) for the person's progress at school.<ref name=Buxton>Buxton, B.

Structural impairments may include [[microcephaly]] (small head size) of two or more standard deviations below the average, or other abnormalities in brain structure (e.g., [[agenesis of the corpus callosum]], [[cerebellar hypoplasia]]).<ref name=IOM/>\n\nMicrocephaly is determined by comparing head circumference (often called [[Orbitofrontal cortex|occipitofrontal]] circumference, or OFC) to appropriate OFC growth charts.<ref name=growthchart/> Other structural impairments must be observed through [[medical imaging]] techniques by a trained physician.

In the context of FASD, [[Neurology|neurological impairments]] are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure which causes general neurological damage to the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), the [[peripheral nervous system]], or the [[autonomic nervous system]]. A determination of a neurological problem must be made by a trained physician, and must not be due to a postnatal insult, such as [[meningitis]], [[concussion]], [[traumatic brain injury]], etc.\n\nAll four diagnostic systems show virtual agreement on their criteria for CNS damage at the neurological level, and evidence of a CNS neurological impairment due to prenatal alcohol exposure will result in a diagnosis of FAS or pFAS, and functional impairments are highly likely.<ref name=Canadian/><ref name=IOM/><ref name=4digitcode/><ref name=CDC/>\n\nNeurological problems are expressed as either hard signs, or diagnosable disorders, such as [[epilepsy]] or other [[seizure disorder]]s, or soft signs. Soft signs are broader, nonspecific neurological impairments, or symptoms, such as impaired [[fine motor skills]], [[sensory processing disorder|neurosensory]] [[hearing loss]], poor [[Gait (human)|gait]], [[developmental coordination disorder|clumsiness]], and poor [[Hand-eye coordination|hand - eye coordination]].  Many soft signs have [[Norm-referenced test|norm-referenced criteria]], while others are determined through clinical judgment.  \"Clinical judgment\" is only as good as the clinician, and soft signs should be assessed by either a pediatric neurologist, a pediatric neuropsychologist, or both.\n\n====Functional====\nWhen structural or neurological impairments are not observed, all four diagnostic systems allow CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure to be assessed in terms of functional impairments.<ref name=Canadian/><ref name=IOM/><ref name=4digitcode/><ref name=CDC/> Functional impairments are deficits, problems, delays, or abnormalities due to prenatal alcohol exposure (rather than hereditary causes or postnatal insults) in observable and measurable domains related to daily functioning, often referred to as [[developmental disabilities]].

The so-called placental barrier is practically absent with respect to ethanol.\n# The developing fetal nervous system appears particularly sensitive to ethanol toxicity. The latter interferes with proliferation, differentiation, neuronal migration, axonic outgrowth, integration, and fine-tuning of the synaptic network. In short, all major processes in the developing central nervous system appear compromised.\n# Fetal tissues are quite different from adult tissues in function and purpose.  For example, the main detoxicating organ in adults is the [[Human liver|liver]], whereas the fetal liver is incapable of detoxifying ethanol, as the ADH and ALDH enzymes have not yet been brought to expression at this early stage.  Up to term, fetal tissues do not have significant capacity for the detoxification of ethanol, and the [[fetus]] remains exposed to ethanol in the amniotic fluid for periods far longer than the decay time of ethanol in the maternal circulation. The lack of significant quantities of ADH and ALDH means that fetal tissues have much lower quantities of antioxidant enzymes, like [[Superoxide dismutase|SOD]], glutathione transferases, and [[Glutathione peroxidase|glutathion peroxidases]], resulting in antioxidant protection being much less effective.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nBecause admission of alcohol use during pregnancy can stigmatize birth mothers, many are reluctant to admit drinking or to provide an accurate report of the quantity they drank. This complicates diagnosis and treatment of the syndrome.<ref name=CDC/> As a result, diagnosis of the severity of FASD relies on protocols of observation of the child's physiology and behavior rather than maternal self-reporting. \nPresently, four FASD diagnostic systems that diagnose FAS and other FASD conditions have been developed in North America:\n* The [[Institute of Medicine]]'s guidelines for FAS, the first system to standardize diagnoses of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure;<ref name =IOM/>\n* The [[University of Washington]]'s \"The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code\", which ranks the four key features of FASD on a [[Likert scale]] of one to four and yields 256 descriptive codes that can be categorized into 22 distinct clinical categories, ranging from FAS to no findings;<ref name=4digitcode/>\n* The [[Centers for Disease Control]]'s \"Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis\", which established consensus on the diagnosis FAS in the U.S. but deferred addressing other FASD conditions;<ref name=CDC>[https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/documents/FAS_guidelines_accessible.pdf Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis (PDF).] CDC (July 2004).  Retrieved on 2019-10-19</ref> and\n* Canadian guidelines for FASD diagnoses, which established criteria for diagnosing FASD in Canada and harmonized most differences between the IOM and University of Washington's systems.<ref name=Canadian>{{Cite journal|last=Chudley|title=Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: Canadian guidelines for diagnosis|journal=CMAJ|volume=172|issue=5 Suppl|pages=S1\u2013S21|year=2005|pmid=15738468|doi=10.1503/cmaj.1040302|pmc=557121|display-authors=etal|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nEach diagnostic system requires that a complete FASD evaluation includes an assessment of the four key features of FASD, described below. A positive finding on all four features is required for a diagnosis of FAS. However, prenatal alcohol exposure and central nervous system damage are the critical elements of the spectrum of FASD, and a positive finding in these two features is sufficient for an FASD diagnosis that is not \"full-blown FAS\".\n\nWhile the four diagnostic systems essentially agree on criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), there are still differences when full criteria for FAS are not met. This has resulted in differing and evolving nomenclature for other conditions across the spectrum of FASD, which may account for such a wide variety of terminology. Most individuals with deficits resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure do not express all features of FAS and fall into other FASD conditions.<ref name =IOM/> The Canadian guidelines recommend the assessment and descriptive approach of the \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" for each key feature of FASD and the terminology of the IOM in diagnostic categories, excepting ARBD.<ref name=Canadian/>\n\nThus, other FASD conditions are partial expressions of FAS. However, these other FASD conditions may create disabilities similar to FAS if the key area of central nervous system damage shows clinical deficits in two or more of [[Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder#Ten brain domains|ten domains of brain functioning]]. Essentially, even though growth deficiency and/or FAS facial features may be mild or nonexistent in other FASD conditions, yet clinically significant brain damage of the central nervous system is present. In these other FASD conditions, an individual may be at greater risk for adverse outcomes because brain damage is present without associated visual cues of poor growth or the \"FAS face\" that might ordinarily trigger an FASD evaluation. Such individuals may be misdiagnosed with primary [[DSM-IV Codes|mental health disorders]] such as [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] or [[oppositional defiance disorder]] without appreciation that brain damage is the underlying cause of these disorders, which requires a different treatment paradigm than typical mental health disorders. While other FASD conditions may not yet be included as an [[ICD]] or [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV-TR]] diagnosis, they nonetheless pose significant impairment in [[Adaptive behavior|functional behavior]] because of underlying brain damage.\n\n===Fetal alcohol syndrome===\nThe following criteria must be fully met for an FAS diagnosis:<ref name =Canadian/><ref name =IOM/><ref name =4digitcode/><ref name =CDC/>\n\n# Growth deficiency: Prenatal or postnatal height or weight (or both) at or below the 10th percentile<ref name=\"growthchart\"/>\n# FAS facial features: All three FAS facial features present<ref name =facial/>\n# Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural neurological, ''or'' functional impairment\n# Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed or Unknown prenatal alcohol exposure\n\nFetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the first diagnosable condition of FASD that was discovered. FAS is the only expression of FASD that has garnered consensus among experts to become an official [[ICD-9]] and [[ICD-10]] diagnosis. To make this diagnosis or determine any FASD condition, a [[Interdisciplinarity|multi-disciplinary]] evaluation is necessary to assess each of the four key features for assessment. Generally, a trained [[physician]] will determine growth deficiency and FAS facial features. While a qualified physician may also assess central nervous system structural abnormalities and/or neurological problems, usually central nervous system damage is determined through [[Psychological testing|psychological]], [[Speech pathology|speech-language]], and [[occupational therapy]] assessments to ascertain clinically significant impairments in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains.<ref name =Lang/> Prenatal alcohol exposure risk may be assessed by a qualified physician, [[psychologist]], [[social work]]er, or chemical health counselor. These professionals work together as a team to assess and interpret data of each key feature for assessment and develop an integrative, multi-disciplinary report to diagnose FAS (or other FASD conditions) in an individual.\n\n===Partial FAS===\nPartial FAS (pFAS) was previously known as atypical FAS in the 1997 edition of the \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\". People with pFAS have a confirmed history of prenatal alcohol exposure, but may lack growth deficiency or the complete facial stigmata. Central nervous system damage is present at the same level as FAS. These individuals have the same functional disabilities but \"look\" less like FAS.\n\nThe following criteria must be fully met for a diagnosis of Partial FAS:<ref name =Canadian/><ref name =IOM/><ref name =4digitcode/>\n\n# Growth deficiency: Growth or height may range from normal to deficient<ref name =growthchart/>\n# FAS facial features: Two or three FAS facial features present<ref name =facial/>\n# Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural, neurological, ''or'' functional impairment in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains<ref name =Lang/>\n# Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure\n\n===Fetal alcohol effects===\nFetal alcohol effects (FAE) is a previous term for alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder and alcohol-related birth defects.<ref name=CDC2015Fact/> It was initially used in research studies to describe humans and animals in whom teratogenic effects were seen after confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure (or unknown exposure for humans), but without obvious physical anomalies.<ref name =FAE/> Smith (1981) described FAE as an \"extremely important concept\" to highlight the debilitating effects of brain damage, regardless of the growth or facial features.<ref name =FAESmith>{{cite journal | author = Smith D.W. | year = 1981 | title = Fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects | url = | journal = Neurobehavioral Toxicology and Teratology | volume = 3 | issue = | page = 127 }}</ref> This term has fallen out of favor with clinicians because it was often regarded by the public as a less severe disability than FAS, when in fact its effects can be just as detrimental.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Aase J.M. |author2=Jones K.L. |author3=Clarren S.K. | year = 1995 | title = Do we need the term FAE? | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 95 | issue = 3| pages = 428\u2013430 | pmid = 7862486 }}</ref>\n\n====Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder====\nAlcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) was initially suggested by the Institute of Medicine to replace the term FAE and focus on central nervous system damage, rather than growth deficiency or FAS facial features. The Canadian guidelines also use this diagnosis and the same criteria. While the \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" includes these criteria for three of its diagnostic categories, it refers to this condition as [[encephalopathy|static encephalopathy]]. The behavioral effects of ARND are not necessarily unique to alcohol however, so use of the term must be within the context of confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure.<ref name =FASGuide/> ARND may be gaining acceptance over the terms FAE and ARBD to describe FASD conditions with central nervous system abnormalities or behavioral or cognitive abnormalities or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure without regard to growth deficiency or FAS facial features.<ref name =FASGuide/><ref name =MalbinTry>Malbin, D.

Baltimore: Brookes Publishing. {{ISBN|1-55766-283-5}}.</ref> The Canadian guidelines recommend that ARBD should not be used as an umbrella term or diagnostic category for FASD.\n\n===Exposure===\nPrenatal alcohol exposure is determined by interview of the biological mother or other family members knowledgeable of the mother's alcohol use during the pregnancy (if available), prenatal health records (if available), and review of available birth records, court records (if applicable), [[drug rehabilitation|chemical dependency treatment]] records (if applicable), chemical biomarkers,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bager|first=Heidi|last2=Christensen|first2=Lars Porskjaer|last3=Husby|first3=Steffen|last4=Bjerregaard|first4=Lene|date=February 2017|title=Biomarkers for the Detection of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure: A Review|journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research|volume=41|issue=2|pages=251\u2013261|doi=10.1111/acer.13309}}</ref> or other reliable sources.\n\nExposure level is assessed as ''confirmed exposure'', ''unknown exposure'', and ''confirmed absence of exposure'' by the IOM, CDC and Canadian diagnostic systems. The \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" further distinguishes confirmed exposure as ''High Risk'' and ''Some Risk'':\n\n* High Risk: Confirmed use of alcohol during pregnancy known to be at high [[blood alcohol content|blood alcohol levels]] (100&nbsp;mg/dL or greater) delivered at least weekly in early pregnancy.\n* Some Risk: Confirmed use of alcohol during pregnancy with use less than High Risk or unknown usage patterns.\n* Unknown Risk: Unknown use of alcohol during pregnancy.\n* No Risk: Confirmed absence of prenatal alcohol exposure.\n\n====Confirmed exposure====\nAmount, frequency, and timing of prenatal alcohol use can dramatically impact the other three key features of FASD. While consensus exists that alcohol is a teratogen, there is no clear consensus as to what level of exposure is toxic.<ref name=IOM/> The CDC guidelines are silent on these elements diagnostically. The IOM and Canadian guidelines explore this further, acknowledging the importance of significant alcohol exposure from regular or heavy episodic alcohol consumption in determining, but offer no standard for diagnosis. Canadian guidelines discuss this lack of clarity and parenthetically point out that \"heavy alcohol use\" is defined by the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] as five or more drinks per episode on five or more days during a 30-day period.<ref>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (2000). National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. ''Tenth special report to the U.S Congress on alcohol and health: Highlights frfom current research''. Washington, DC: The Institute.</ref>\n\n\"The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" ranking system distinguishes between levels of prenatal alcohol exposure as ''high risk'' and ''some risk''. It operationalizes high risk exposure as a [[blood alcohol content|blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) greater than 100&nbsp;mg/dL delivered at least weekly in early pregnancy. This BAC level is typically reached by a 55&nbsp;kg female drinking six to eight beers in one sitting.<ref name =4digitcode/>\n\n====Unknown exposure====\nFor many adopted or adults and children in foster care, records or other reliable sources may not be available for review. Reporting alcohol use during pregnancy can also be stigmatizing to birth mothers, especially if alcohol use is ongoing.<ref name=CDC/> In these cases, all diagnostic systems use an unknown prenatal alcohol exposure designation. A diagnosis of FAS is still possible with an unknown exposure level if other key features of FASD are present at clinical levels.\n\n====Confirmed absence of exposure====\nConfirmed absence of exposure would apply to planned pregnancies in which no alcohol was used or pregnancies of women who do not use alcohol or report no use during the pregnancy. This designation is relatively rare, as most people presenting for an FASD evaluation are at least ''suspected'' to have had a prenatal alcohol exposure due to presence of other key features of FASD.<ref name =4digitcode/><ref name =CDC/>\n\n==== Biomarkers ====\nEvidence is insufficient for the use of chemical biomarkers to detect prenatal alcohol exposure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McQuire|first=C.|last2=Paranjothy|first2=S.|last3=Hurt|first3=L.|last4=Mann|first4=M.|last5=Farewell|first5=D.|last6=Kemp|first6=A.|date=2016-09-01|title=Objective Measures of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure: A Systematic Review|journal=Pediatrics|volume=138|issue=3|pages=e20160517|doi=10.1542/peds.2016-0517|issn=0031-4005|pmid=27577579}}</ref> Biomarkers being studied include fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) detected in the meconium (first feces of an infant) and hair.

The proposed framework attempts to harmonize IOM, 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, CDC, and Canadian guidelines for measuring CNS damage vis-\u00e0-vis FASD evaluations and diagnosis. The standardized approach is referred to as the Ten Brain Domains and encompasses aspects of all four diagnostic systems' recommendations for assessing CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure. The framework provides clear definitions of brain dysfunction, specifies empirical data needed for accurate diagnosis, and defines intervention considerations that address the complex nature of FASD with the intention to avoid common secondary disabilities.<ref name=Lang/>\n\nThe proposed Ten Brain Domains include:<ref name=Lang/>\n*[[Outcome-based education|Achievement]], [[adaptive behavior]], [[attention]], [[cognition]], [[executive functioning]], [[language]], [[memory]], [[motor skills]], [[multisensory integration]] or soft [[Neurology|neurological]] problems, social [[communication]]<ref name=Lang>{{cite journal |last1=Lang |first1=Jeannette |year=2006 |title=Ten Brain Domains: A Proposal for Functional Central Nervous System Parameters for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Diagnosis and Follow-up |journal=Journal of the FAS Institute |volume=4 |pages=1\u201311 |url=http://www.motherisk.org/JFAS_documents/JFAS_5012_Final_e12_6.28.6.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926012830/http://www.motherisk.org/JFAS_documents/JFAS_5012_Final_e12_6.28.6.pdf |archivedate=26 September 2006 |df=dmy-all |access-date=4 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe Fetal Alcohol Diagnostic Program (FADP) uses unpublished Minnesota state criteria of performance at 1.5 or more [[standard deviation]]s on [[standardized testing]] in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains to determine CNS damage.

Early intervention from birth to age 3 has been shown to improve the development of a child born with FASD.<ref name=\":0\" /> Because CNS damage, symptoms, secondary disabilities, and needs vary widely by individual, there is no one treatment type that works for everyone.\n\n===Medication===\n[[Psychoactive drug]]s are frequently tried on those with FASD as many FASD symptoms are mistaken for or overlap with other disorders, most notably [[ADHD]].<ref name=Buxton/>\n\n===Behavioral interventions===\n[[Behaviorism|Behavioral]] interventions are based on the [[Learning theory (education)|learning theory]], which is the basis for many parenting and [[Psychology|professional]] strategies and interventions.<ref name=MalbinTry/> Along with ordinary [[parenting styles]], such strategies are frequently used by default for treating those with FAS, as the diagnoses [[oppositional defiance disorder]] (ODD), [[conduct disorder]], [[reactive attachment disorder]] (RAD) often overlap with FAS (along with [[ADHD]]), and these are sometimes thought to benefit from behavioral interventions. Frequently, a person's poor academic achievement results in [[special education]] services, which also utilizes principles of [[Learning theory (education)|learning theory]], [[behavior modification]], and [[outcome-based education]].\n\n===Developmental framework===\nMany books and handouts on FAS recommend a developmental approach, based on [[developmental psychology]], even though most do not specify it as such and provide little theoretical background. Optimal human development generally occurs in identifiable stages (e.g., [[Jean Piaget]]'s [[theory of cognitive development]], [[Erik Erikson]]'s [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of psychosocial development]], [[John Bowlby]]'s [[Attachment theory|attachment framework]], and other [[developmental stage theories]]). FAS interferes with normal development,<ref name=McCreight/> which may cause stages to be delayed, skipped, or immaturely developed. Over time, an unaffected child can negotiate the increasing demands of life by progressing through stages of development normally, but not so for a child with FAS.<ref name=McCreight/>\n\nBy knowing what developmental stages and tasks children follow, treatment and interventions for FAS can be tailored to helping a person meet developmental tasks and demands successfully.<ref name=McCreight/> If a person is delayed in the [[adaptive behavior]] domain, for instance, then interventions would be recommended to target specific delays through additional education and practice (e.g., practiced instruction on tying shoelaces), giving reminders, or making accommodations (e.g., using slip-on shoes) to support the desired functioning level. This approach is an advance over behavioral interventions, because it takes the person's developmental context into account while developing interventions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n===Advocacy model===\nThe [[advocacy]] model takes the point of view that someone is needed to actively mediate between the environment and the person with FAS.<ref name=FASGuide/> Advocacy activities are conducted by an advocate (for example, a family member, friend, or [[Case management (mental health)|case manager]]) and fall into three basic categories. An advocate for FAS: (1) interprets FAS and the disabilities that arise from it and explains it to the environment in which the person operates, (2) engenders change or accommodation on behalf of the person, and (3) assists the person in developing and reaching attainable goals.<ref name=FASGuide/>\n\nThe advocacy model is often recommended, for example, when developing an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) for the person's progress at school.<ref name=Buxton>Buxton, B.

These disabilities often emerge over time due to a mismatch between the primary disabilities and environmental expectations; secondary disabilities can be ameliorated with early interventions and appropriate supportive services.<ref name=2disabilities/>\n\nSix main secondary disabilities were identified in a University of Washington research study of 473 subjects diagnosed with FAS, PFAS (partial fetal alcohol syndrome), and ARND (alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder):<ref name=FASGuide/><ref name=2disabilities/>\n\n* Mental health problems: Diagnosed with [[ADHD]], [[Clinical Depression]], or other [[mental illness]], experienced by over 90% of the subjects\n* Disrupted school experience: Suspended or expelled from school or dropped out of school, experienced by 60% of the subjects (age 12 and older)\n* Trouble with the law: Charged or convicted with a crime, experienced by 60% of the subjects (age 12 and older)\n* Confinement: For inpatient psychiatric care, inpatient chemical dependency care, or incarcerated for a crime, experienced by about 50% of the subjects (age 12 and older)\n* Inappropriate sexual behavior: Sexual advances, sexual touching, or promiscuity, experienced by about 50% of the subjects (age 12 and older)\n* Alcohol and drug problems: Abuse or dependency, experienced by 35% of the subjects (age 12 and older)\n\nTwo additional secondary disabilities exist for adults:<ref name=FASGuide/><ref name=2disabilities/>\n\n* Dependent living: Group home, living with family or friends, or some sort of assisted living, experienced by 80% of the subjects (age 21 and older)\n* Problems with employment: Required ongoing job training or coaching, could not keep a job, unemployed, experienced by 80% of the subjects (age 21 and older)\n\n===Protective factors and strengths===\nEight factors were identified in the same study as universal protective factors that reduced the incidence rate of the secondary disabilities:<ref name=FASGuide/><ref name=2disabilities/>\n* Living in a stable and nurturing home for over 73% of life\n* Being diagnosed with FAS before age six\n* Never having experienced violence\n* Remaining in each living situation for at least 2.8 years\n* Experiencing a \"good quality home\" (meeting 10 or more defined qualities) from age 8 to 12 years old\n* Having been found eligible for developmental disability (DD) services\n* Having basic needs met for at least 13% of life\n* Having a diagnosis of FAS (rather than another FASD condition)\n\nMalbin (2002) has identified the following areas of interests and talents as strengths that often stand out for those with FASD and should be utilized, like any strength, in treatment planning:<ref name=\"MalbinTry\"/>\n*Music, playing instruments, composing, singing, art, spelling, reading, computers, mechanics, woodworking, skilled vocations (welding, electrician, etc.), writing, poetry\n*Participation in non-impact sport or physical fitness activities\n\n==Epidemiology==\nFASD is estimated to affect between 2% and 5% of people in the United States and Western Europe.<ref name=CDC2015Prev/> FAS is believed to occur in between 0.2 and 9 per 1000 live births in the United States.<ref name=CDC2015Prev/> The lifetime costs of an individual with FAS were estimated to be two million USD in 2002.<ref name=CDC2015Prev/> Drinking any quantity during pregnancy, the risk of giving birth to a child with FASD is about 15%, and to a child with FAS about 1.5%.

Its capital is [[Benin City]]. The 2014 estimated population of the Edo state is 5 million people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nigerdeltabudget.org/new/index.php/overview-of-edo-state|title=Overview of Edo State|last=User|first=Super|website=Niger Delta Budget Monitoring Group|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> It is made up of 4 major ethnic groups; namely the Bini, Esan, [[Owan]], and Etsako. However the State has a high presence of residents from across the country and the world because of its cosmopolitan tendencies. Benin City the capital has a history of being one of the foremost destinations of Europeans during their exploration of the African continent many centuries ago. Some of the flash points have remained tourists attractions for the state.\n\n== History ==\nThe Mid-Western Region was a division of Nigeria from 1963 to 1991, formally known as Bendel state from 1976. It was formed in June 1963 from Benin and Delta provinces of the Western Region, and its capital was Benin City. It was renamed a province in 1966, and in 1967 when the other provinces were split up into several states, it remained territorially intact, becoming a state.\n\nDuring the [[Nigerian Civil War]], the Biafran forces invaded the new Mid-Western state, en route to [[Lagos State|Lagos]], in an attempt to force a quick end to the war. While under Biafran occupation, the state was declared as the \u201cRepublic of Benin\u201d as Nigerian forces were to retake the region. The republic collapsed a day after the declaration as Nigerian troops overtook Benin City. Edo State was formed on August 27, 1991 when Bendel State was split into Edo and [[Delta State]]s.\n\n== People ==\nWith Benin City as capital, the population of the entire state is approximately 8 million. It is made up of three major ethnic groups; namely Edo (Binis), Esan and Afemai (Owan/Etsako) with Akoko Edo.  However the State has a high presence of residents from across the country and the world because of its cosmopolitan tendencies. Benin City the capital has a history of being one of the foremost destinations of Europeans during their exploration of Africa continent many centuries ago. Some of the flash points have  remained enviable tourists\u2019 attraction for the state.\n\n===Demographics===\nThe main ethnic groups in Edo State are Binis, Etsako, Esans, Owans and Akoko Edos. Virtually all the groups traced their origin to Benin City hence the dialects of the groups vary with their distance from Benin City. The Bini speaking people who occupy seven out of the 18 Local Government Areas of the state constitute 57.14%; while others are as follow: Esan (17.14%), Etsako (12.19%), Owan (7.43%), and Akoko Edo (5.70%). However, the Igbira speaking communities exist in Akoko Edo as well as  [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] Izons, Urhobos, Itsekiris communities in Ovia North East and South West Local Government Areas especially in the borderlands. Also, Ika speaking communities exist in Igbanke in Orhionmwon LGA.\n\nA lot of communities and indeed the ruling dynasties in all the clans trace their roots to the ancient kingdom of Benin. Cultural similarities are in the areas of religious worships, folk-lore, dances, festivals, traditional modes of dressing, arts and craft. The political pattern and behaviour are based on a situation where both the monarchial and republican ideas flourished in an integrated manner. The colourful traditional festivals in the state manifest its rich cultural heritage. Critical among these are the Igue and Ekaba festivals done among the Binis and manhood initiation (age groups) by the Etsako people. With an estimated population of 3,218, 332 made up of 1,640,461 males and 1, 577, 871 females and a growth rate of 2.7% per annum (NPC, 2006), as well as a total landmass of 19,187 square kilometers, the state has a population density of about 168 persons per square kilometers.\n\n== Governors ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Title\n!Took office\n!Left office\n!Party\n!Notes\n|-\n|Colonel [[John Ewerekumoh Yeri]]\n|Governor\n|Aug 1990\n|Jan 1992\n|(Military)\n|\n|-\n|[[John Odigie Oyegun|John E.K.

Its capital is [[Benin City]]. The 2014 estimated population of the Edo state is 5 million people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nigerdeltabudget.org/new/index.php/overview-of-edo-state|title=Overview of Edo State|last=User|first=Super|website=Niger Delta Budget Monitoring Group|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> It is made up of 4 major ethnic groups; namely the Bini, Esan, [[Owan]], and Etsako. However the State has a high presence of residents from across the country and the world because of its cosmopolitan tendencies. Benin City the capital has a history of being one of the foremost destinations of Europeans during their exploration of the African continent many centuries ago. Some of the flash points have remained tourists attractions for the state.\n\n== History ==\nThe Mid-Western Region was a division of Nigeria from 1963 to 1991, formally known as Bendel state from 1976. It was formed in June 1963 from Benin and Delta provinces of the Western Region, and its capital was Benin City. It was renamed a province in 1966, and in 1967 when the other provinces were split up into several states, it remained territorially intact, becoming a state.\n\nDuring the [[Nigerian Civil War]], the Biafran forces invaded the new Mid-Western state, en route to [[Lagos State|Lagos]], in an attempt to force a quick end to the war. While under Biafran occupation, the state was declared as the \u201cRepublic of Benin\u201d as Nigerian forces were to retake the region. The republic collapsed a day after the declaration as Nigerian troops overtook Benin City. Edo State was formed on August 27, 1991 when Bendel State was split into Edo and [[Delta State]]s.\n\n== People ==\nWith Benin City as capital, the population of the entire state is approximately 8 million. It is made up of three major ethnic groups; namely Edo (Binis), Esan and Afemai (Owan/Etsako) with Akoko Edo.  However the State has a high presence of residents from across the country and the world because of its cosmopolitan tendencies. Benin City the capital has a history of being one of the foremost destinations of Europeans during their exploration of Africa continent many centuries ago. Some of the flash points have  remained enviable tourists\u2019 attraction for the state.\n\n===Demographics===\nThe main ethnic groups in Edo State are Binis, Etsako, Esans, Owans and Akoko Edos. Virtually all the groups traced their origin to Benin City hence the dialects of the groups vary with their distance from Benin City. The Bini speaking people who occupy seven out of the 18 Local Government Areas of the state constitute 57.14%; while others are as follow: Esan (17.14%), Etsako (12.19%), Owan (7.43%), and Akoko Edo (5.70%). However, the Igbira speaking communities exist in Akoko Edo as well as  [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] Izons, Urhobos, Itsekiris communities in Ovia North East and South West Local Government Areas especially in the borderlands. Also, Ika speaking communities exist in Igbanke in Orhionmwon LGA.\n\nA lot of communities and indeed the ruling dynasties in all the clans trace their roots to the ancient kingdom of Benin. Cultural similarities are in the areas of religious worships, folk-lore, dances, festivals, traditional modes of dressing, arts and craft. The political pattern and behaviour are based on a situation where both the monarchial and republican ideas flourished in an integrated manner. The colourful traditional festivals in the state manifest its rich cultural heritage. Critical among these are the Igue and Ekaba festivals done among the Binis and manhood initiation (age groups) by the Etsako people. With an estimated population of 3,218, 332 made up of 1,640,461 males and 1, 577, 871 females and a growth rate of 2.7% per annum (NPC, 2006), as well as a total landmass of 19,187 square kilometers, the state has a population density of about 168 persons per square kilometers.\n\n== Governors ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Title\n!Took office\n!Left office\n!Party\n!Notes\n|-\n|Colonel [[John Ewerekumoh Yeri]]\n|Governor\n|Aug 1990\n|Jan 1992\n|(Military)\n|\n|-\n|[[John Odigie Oyegun|John E.K.

Thus they are often referred to in English-language research as \"[[Viking]] Rus'\". The scholarly consensus <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/the-vikings-at-home/|title=The Vikings at home|website=History Extra}}</ref> is that the Rus' people originated in what is currently coastal [[East Middle Sweden|eastern Sweden]] around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as [[Roslagen]] in [[Sweden]] (with the older name being ''[[Roden, Sweden|Roden]]'').\n\nBasing themselves among [[Slavs]] and [[Volga Finns]] in the upper [[Volga region]], they formed a diaspora of traders and raiders exchanging furs and slaves for silk, silver and other commodities available to the east and south. Around the ninth century, on the river routes to the [[Black Sea]], they had an unclear but significant role in forming the principality of [[Kievan Rus]], gradually assimilating with local [[Slavic peoples|Slavic populations]]. They also extended their operations much further east and south, among the [[Bulgars]] and [[Khazars]], on the routes to the [[Caspian Sea]]. By around the eleventh century, the word ''Rus{{'}}'' was increasingly associated with the principality of Kiev, and the term ''[[Varangian]]'' was becoming more common as a term for Scandinavians traveling the river-routes.\n\nLittle, however, is certain about the Rus{{'}}. This is to a significant extent because, although Rus{{'}} people were active over a long period and vast distances, textual evidence for their activities is very sparse and almost never produced by contemporary Rus' people themselves. It is believed that writing was brought to the Rus by the Slavs for religious reasons, but this happened long after their early history. The word ''Rus{{'}}'' in the primary sources does not always mean the same thing as it does when used by today's scholars. Meanwhile, archaeological evidence and researchers' understanding of it is accumulating only gradually. As a trading diaspora, Rus' people intermingled extensively with Finnic, Slavic, and Turkic peoples and their customs and identity seem correspondingly to have varied considerably over time and space.\n\nThe other key reason for dispute about the origins of Rus' people is the likelihood that they had a role in ninth- to tenth-century state formation in eastern Europe (ultimately giving their name to [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]]), making them relevant to what are today seen as the national histories of [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Sweden]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Finland]] and [[Baltic states]]. \n\n== Key sources ==\n=== Etymology ===\n{{Main|Rus' (name)}}\n[[File:Europe 814.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Europe]] in the 9th century. [[Roslagen]] is located along the coast of the northern tip of the pink area marked ''\"Swedes and Goths\"''.]]\n\nThe etymology and semantic history of the word ''Rus{{'}}'' has been a highly contentious topic, on which debate is ongoing. This is partly because of a widespread assumption that by identifying the linguistic origin of the name ''Rus{{'}}'', scholars can identify the origins of the people whom it described. This assumption has, however, been criticized in twenty-first-century scholarship.<ref>James E.

It has therefore been influential on modern history-writing, but it is also much later than the time it describes, and historians agree it primarily reflects the political and religious politics of the time of [[Mstislav I of Kiev]].\n\nHowever, the chronicle does include the texts of a series of Rus'\u2013Byzantine Treaties from [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine Treaty (911)|911]], [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine Treaty (945)|945]], and [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine War (970\u2013971)|971]].<ref>Thorir Jonsson Hraundal, 'New Perspectives on Eastern Vikings/Rus in Arabic Sources', ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'', 10 (2014), 65\u201397 {{DOI|10.1484/J.VMS.5.1052}} (pp. 66-67).</ref> The Rus'\u2013Byzantine Treaties give a valuable insight into the names of the Rus'.

There was no law among them, but tribe rose against tribe. Discord thus ensued among them, and they began to war one against the other. They said to themselves, \"Let us seek a prince who may rule over us, and judge us according to the Law\". They accordingly went overseas to the Varangian Russes: these particular Varangians were known as Russes, just as some are called [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]], and others [[Normans]], [[Angles|English]], and [[Gutes|Gotlanders]], for they were thus named. The Chuds, the Slavs, the Krivichians and the Ves' then said to the people of Rus', \"Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us\". Thus they selected three brothers, with their kinsfolk, who took with them all the Russes and migrated. The oldest, Rurik, located himself in Novgorod; the second, [[Sineus and Truvor|Sineus]], at [[Beloozero]]; and the third, [[Sineus and Truvor|Truvor]], in [[Izborsk]]. On account of these Varangians, the district of Novgorod became known as the land of Rus'.<ref name=\"RPC\">''[https://archive.org/details/TheRussianPrimaryChronicle The Russian Primary Chronicle: Laurentian Text'', ed. and trans. by Samuel Hazzard Cross and Olgerd P.

The Varangians (''Varyags'', in [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]]) are first mentioned by the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' as having exacted tribute from the Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859. It was the time of rapid expansion of the Vikings in Northern Europe; England began to pay [[Danegeld]] in 859, and the [[Curonians]] of [[Grobin]] faced an invasion by the Swedes at about the same date.\n\nIt has been argued that the word ''Varangian'', in its many forms, does not appear in primary sources until the eleventh century (though it does appear frequently in later sources describing earlier periods). This suggests that the term ''Rus{{'}}'' was used broadly to denote Scandinavians until it became too firmly associated with the now extensively Slavicised elite of Kievan Rus. At that point, the new term ''Varangian'' was increasingly preferred to name Scandinavians, probably mostly from what is currently Sweden,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Forte|first1=Angelo|first2=Richard|last2=Oram|first3=Frederik|last3=Pedersen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vEd859jvk0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Viking Empires|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year= 2005|ISBN= 0-521-82992-5|pages=13\u201314}}</ref> plying the river-routes between the Baltic and the Black/Caspian Seas.<ref>Marika M\u00e4gi, ''In <i>Austrvegr</i>: The Role of the Eastern Baltic in Viking Age Communication Across the Baltic Sea'', The Northern World, 84 (Leiden: Brill, 2018), p. 195, citing Alf Thulin, 'The Rus' of Nestor's Chronicle', ''Mediaeval Scandinavia'', 13 (2000), 70-96.</ref>\n\nDue largely to geographic considerations, it is often argued that most of the Varangians who traveled and settled in the lands of eastern Baltic, modern Russian Federation and lands to the south came from the area of modern [[Sweden]].\n\nThe Varangians left a number of [[varangian runestones|rune stones]] in their native [[Sweden]] that tell of their journeys to what is today Russia, Ukraine, Greece, and Belarus. Most of these rune stones can be seen today, and are a telling piece of historical evidence. The [[Varangian runestones]] tell of many notable Varangian expeditions, and even account for the fates of individual warriors and travelers.\n\nIn Russian history, two cities are used to describe the beginnings of the country: Kiev and Novgorod.<ref name=\"auto9\">Duczko, Wladyslaw. Viking Rus\u202f: Studies on the Presence of Scandinavians in Eastern Europe. The Northern World. Leiden: Brill, 2004.</ref> In the first part of the eleventh century the former was already a Slav metropolis, rich and powerful, a fast growing centre of civilization adopted from Byzantium. The latter town, Novgorod, was another centre of the same culture but founded in different surroundings, where some old local traditions moulded this commercial city into a mighty oligarchic republic of a kind otherwise unknown in this part of Europe. These towns have tended to overshadow other places of a significance that they had acquired long before Kiev and Novgorod. The two original centers of Rus were Staraja Ladoga and Rurikovo Gorodishche, two points on the ends the Volkhov, a river running for 200 km between [[Lake Ilmen]] in the south to [[Lake Ladoga]] in the north<ref name=\"auto9\"/>. This was the territory that most probably was originally called by the Norsemen Gardar, a name that long after Viking Age was given much wider content and become Gardariki, denomination for whole Old Russian State. The area between the lakes was the original Rus, and it was from here its name was transferred to the Slav territories on the middle Dnieper, which eventually became \u201cRuskaja zemlja\u201d.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> The pre-history of the first territory of Rus has been sought in the developments around the mid eighth century, when Staraja Ladoga was founded as a trading place, serving the operations of Scandinavian hunters and dealers in furs obtained in the north-eastern forest zone of Eastern Europe. In the early period (the second part of the eighth and first part of the ninth century) Norse presence is only visible at Staraja Ladoga, and to a much lesser degree at a few other sites in the northern parts of Eastern Europe. The objects that represent Norse material culture of this period are rare outside Ladoga and mostly known as single finds. This rarity continues through the ninth century until the whole situation changes radically during the next century, when historians meet, at many places and in relatively large quantities, the material remains of a thriving Scandinavian culture.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> For a short period of time, some areas of Eastern Europe became as much part of the Norse world as were Danish and Norwegian territories in the West. The culture of the Rus contained Norse elements used as a manifestation of their Scandinavian background. These elements, which were current in tenth century Scandinavia, appear at various places in form of collections of many types of metal ornaments, mainly female but even male, such as weapons, decorated parts of horse bridle, and diverse objects embellished in current Norse art styles.<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\n\n== Debate on the origins of the Rus' ==\nThe historiography of the origins of the Rus' is infamously contentious, due to its perceived importance for the legitimation of nation-building, imperialism, and independence movements within the Slavonic-speaking world, and for legitimating different political relationships between eastern and western European countries.

The Rus' appeared to emulate aspects of [[Khazar]] political organization\u2014hence the mention of a Rus' ''[[Khagan|chaganus]]'' in the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] court in 839 (''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'').

Devoid of any silver dirham finds in the 8th century AD, it was situated west of the profitable fur and silver trade networks that spanned from the Baltic to the Muslim lands, via the [[Volga region|Volga]]-[[Kama River|Kama]] basins. At the prime hill in Kiev, fortifications and other symbols of consolidation and power appear from the 9th century, thus preceding the literary appearance of 'Rus' in the middle Dnieper region. By the 10th century, the lowlands around Kiev had extensive 'Slavic' styled settlements, and there is evidence of growing trade with the Byzantine lands. This might have attracted Rus' movements, and a shift in power, from the north to Kiev.<ref>{{harvtxt|Franklin|1996|pp=90\u2013122}}</ref> Thus, Kiev does not appear to have evolved from the infrastructure of the Scandinavian trade networks, but rather it forcibly took them over, as evidenced by the destruction of numerous earlier trade settlements in the north, including the famous [[Staraya Ladoga|Staraja Ladoga]].<ref>Tolochko p. 186</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* ''The Annals of Saint-Bertin'', transl.

Thus they are often referred to in English-language research as \"[[Viking]] Rus'\". The scholarly consensus <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/the-vikings-at-home/|title=The Vikings at home|website=History Extra}}</ref> is that the Rus' people originated in what is currently coastal [[East Middle Sweden|eastern Sweden]] around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as [[Roslagen]] in [[Sweden]] (with the older name being ''[[Roden, Sweden|Roden]]'').\n\nBasing themselves among [[Slavs]] and [[Volga Finns]] in the upper [[Volga region]], they formed a diaspora of traders and raiders exchanging furs and slaves for silk, silver and other commodities available to the east and south. Around the ninth century, on the river routes to the [[Black Sea]], they had an unclear but significant role in forming the principality of [[Kievan Rus]], gradually assimilating with local [[Slavic peoples|Slavic populations]]. They also extended their operations much further east and south, among the [[Bulgars]] and [[Khazars]], on the routes to the [[Caspian Sea]]. By around the eleventh century, the word ''Rus{{'}}'' was increasingly associated with the principality of Kiev, and the term ''[[Varangian]]'' was becoming more common as a term for Scandinavians traveling the river-routes.\n\nLittle, however, is certain about the Rus{{'}}. This is to a significant extent because, although Rus{{'}} people were active over a long period and vast distances, textual evidence for their activities is very sparse and almost never produced by contemporary Rus' people themselves. It is believed that writing was brought to the Rus by the Slavs for religious reasons, but this happened long after their early history. The word ''Rus{{'}}'' in the primary sources does not always mean the same thing as it does when used by today's scholars. Meanwhile, archaeological evidence and researchers' understanding of it is accumulating only gradually. As a trading diaspora, Rus' people intermingled extensively with Finnic, Slavic, and Turkic peoples and their customs and identity seem correspondingly to have varied considerably over time and space.\n\nThe other key reason for dispute about the origins of Rus' people is the likelihood that they had a role in ninth- to tenth-century state formation in eastern Europe (ultimately giving their name to [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]]), making them relevant to what are today seen as the national histories of [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Sweden]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Finland]] and [[Baltic states]]. \n\n== Key sources ==\n=== Etymology ===\n{{Main|Rus' (name)}}\n[[File:Europe 814.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Europe]] in the 9th century.

This is partly because of a widespread assumption that by identifying the linguistic origin of the name ''Rus{{'}}'', scholars can identify the origins of the people whom it described. This assumption has, however, been criticized in twenty-first-century scholarship.<ref>James E.

There was no law among them, but tribe rose against tribe. Discord thus ensued among them, and they began to war one against the other. They said to themselves, \"Let us seek a prince who may rule over us, and judge us according to the Law\". They accordingly went overseas to the Varangian Russes: these particular Varangians were known as Russes, just as some are called [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]], and others [[Normans]], [[Angles|English]], and [[Gutes|Gotlanders]], for they were thus named. The Chuds, the Slavs, the Krivichians and the Ves' then said to the people of Rus', \"Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us\". Thus they selected three brothers, with their kinsfolk, who took with them all the Russes and migrated.

The Varangians (''Varyags'', in [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]]) are first mentioned by the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' as having exacted tribute from the Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859. It was the time of rapid expansion of the Vikings in Northern Europe; England began to pay [[Danegeld]] in 859, and the [[Curonians]] of [[Grobin]] faced an invasion by the Swedes at about the same date.\n\nIt has been argued that the word ''Varangian'', in its many forms, does not appear in primary sources until the eleventh century (though it does appear frequently in later sources describing earlier periods). This suggests that the term ''Rus{{'}}'' was used broadly to denote Scandinavians until it became too firmly associated with the now extensively Slavicised elite of Kievan Rus. At that point, the new term ''Varangian'' was increasingly preferred to name Scandinavians, probably mostly from what is currently Sweden,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Forte|first1=Angelo|first2=Richard|last2=Oram|first3=Frederik|last3=Pedersen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vEd859jvk0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Viking Empires|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year= 2005|ISBN= 0-521-82992-5|pages=13\u201314}}</ref> plying the river-routes between the Baltic and the Black/Caspian Seas.<ref>Marika M\u00e4gi, ''In <i>Austrvegr</i>: The Role of the Eastern Baltic in Viking Age Communication Across the Baltic Sea'', The Northern World, 84 (Leiden: Brill, 2018), p. 195, citing Alf Thulin, 'The Rus' of Nestor's Chronicle', ''Mediaeval Scandinavia'', 13 (2000), 70-96.</ref>\n\nDue largely to geographic considerations, it is often argued that most of the Varangians who traveled and settled in the lands of eastern Baltic, modern Russian Federation and lands to the south came from the area of modern [[Sweden]].\n\nThe Varangians left a number of [[varangian runestones|rune stones]] in their native [[Sweden]] that tell of their journeys to what is today Russia, Ukraine, Greece, and Belarus. Most of these rune stones can be seen today, and are a telling piece of historical evidence. The [[Varangian runestones]] tell of many notable Varangian expeditions, and even account for the fates of individual warriors and travelers.\n\nIn Russian history, two cities are used to describe the beginnings of the country: Kiev and Novgorod.<ref name=\"auto9\">Duczko, Wladyslaw. Viking Rus\u202f: Studies on the Presence of Scandinavians in Eastern Europe. The Northern World. Leiden: Brill, 2004.</ref> In the first part of the eleventh century the former was already a Slav metropolis, rich and powerful, a fast growing centre of civilization adopted from Byzantium. The latter town, Novgorod, was another centre of the same culture but founded in different surroundings, where some old local traditions moulded this commercial city into a mighty oligarchic republic of a kind otherwise unknown in this part of Europe. These towns have tended to overshadow other places of a significance that they had acquired long before Kiev and Novgorod. The two original centers of Rus were Staraja Ladoga and Rurikovo Gorodishche, two points on the ends the Volkhov, a river running for 200 km between [[Lake Ilmen]] in the south to [[Lake Ladoga]] in the north<ref name=\"auto9\"/>. This was the territory that most probably was originally called by the Norsemen Gardar, a name that long after Viking Age was given much wider content and become Gardariki, denomination for whole Old Russian State. The area between the lakes was the original Rus, and it was from here its name was transferred to the Slav territories on the middle Dnieper, which eventually became \u201cRuskaja zemlja\u201d.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> The pre-history of the first territory of Rus has been sought in the developments around the mid eighth century, when Staraja Ladoga was founded as a trading place, serving the operations of Scandinavian hunters and dealers in furs obtained in the north-eastern forest zone of Eastern Europe. In the early period (the second part of the eighth and first part of the ninth century) Norse presence is only visible at Staraja Ladoga, and to a much lesser degree at a few other sites in the northern parts of Eastern Europe. The objects that represent Norse material culture of this period are rare outside Ladoga and mostly known as single finds. This rarity continues through the ninth century until the whole situation changes radically during the next century, when historians meet, at many places and in relatively large quantities, the material remains of a thriving Scandinavian culture.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> For a short period of time, some areas of Eastern Europe became as much part of the Norse world as were Danish and Norwegian territories in the West. The culture of the Rus contained Norse elements used as a manifestation of their Scandinavian background. These elements, which were current in tenth century Scandinavia, appear at various places in form of collections of many types of metal ornaments, mainly female but even male, such as weapons, decorated parts of horse bridle, and diverse objects embellished in current Norse art styles.<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\n\n== Debate on the origins of the Rus' ==\nThe historiography of the origins of the Rus' is infamously contentious, due to its perceived importance for the legitimation of nation-building, imperialism, and independence movements within the Slavonic-speaking world, and for legitimating different political relationships between eastern and western European countries.

At the beginning of an important speech in 1749, later published as ''Origines gentis et nominis Russorum'' ('The Origins of the People and the Name of the Russians'), M\u00fcller argued that Russia owed its name and early ruling dynasty to ethnically Scandinavian Varangians.<ref name=\"auto11\">Serhii Plokhy, ''Ukraine and Russia: Representations of the Past'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008), chapter 1.</ref><ref>Elena Melnikova, 'The \"Varangian Problem\": Science in the Grip of Ideology and Politics', in ''Russia's Identity in International Relations: Images, Perceptions, Misperceptions'', ed. by Ray Taras (Abingdon: Routledge, 2013), pp. 42-52 (p. 43).</ref> This statement caused anger in his Russian audience, and earned him much animosity during his professional career in Russia.<ref name=\"auto11\"/><ref name=\"auto10\"/> Scathing criticism from [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Lomonosov]], [[Stepan Krasheninnikov|Krasheninnikov]], and other Russian historians led to M\u00fcller being forced to suspend his work on the issue until Lomonosov's death.

After conducting several military campaigns, he was elected [[King of Bohemia]] in 1469 and adopted the title [[Duke of Austria]] in 1487. He was the son of [[John Hunyadi]], [[Regent of Hungary]], who died in 1456. In 1457, Matthias was imprisoned along with his older brother, [[Ladislaus Hunyadi]], on the orders of King [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]]. Ladislaus Hunyadi was executed, causing a rebellion that forced King Ladislaus to flee Hungary. After the King died unexpectedly, Matthias's uncle [[Michael Szil\u00e1gyi]] persuaded the [[Estates of the realm|Estates]] to unanimously proclaim Matthias king on 24 January 1458. He began his rule under his uncle's guardianship, but he took effective control of government within two weeks.\n\nAs king, Matthias waged wars against the Czech [[mercenaries]] who dominated [[Upper Hungary]] (today parts of [[Slovakia]] and [[Northern Hungary]]) and against [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]], who claimed Hungary for himself. In this period, the [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered [[Despotate of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]], terminating the zone of [[buffer state]]s along the southern frontiers of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Matthias signed a peace treaty with Frederick III in 1463, acknowledging the Emperor's right to style himself King of Hungary. The Emperor returned the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]] with which Matthias was crowned on 29 April 1464. In this year, Matthias invaded the territories that had recently been occupied by the Ottomans and seized fortresses in Bosnia. He soon realized he could expect no substantial aid from the Christian powers and gave up his anti-Ottoman policy.\n\nMatthias introduced new taxes and regularly collected extraordinary taxes. These measures caused a rebellion in [[Transylvania]] in 1467, but he subdued the rebels. The next year, Matthias declared war on [[George of Pod\u011bbrady]], the [[Hussite]] King of Bohemia, and conquered [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], and [[Lausitz]], but he could not occupy [[Bohemia]] proper. The Catholic Estates proclaimed him King of Bohemia on 3 May 1469, but the Hussite lords refused to yield to him even after the death of their leader George of Pod\u011bbrady in 1471. Instead, they elected [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus Jagiellon]], the eldest son of [[Casimir IV of Poland]]. A group of Hungarian prelates and lords offered the throne to Vladislaus's younger brother [[Saint Casimir|Casimir]], but Matthias overcame their rebellion. Having routed the united troops of Casimir IV and Vladislaus at [[Breslau]] in [[Silesia]] (now Wroc\u0142aw in Poland) in late 1474, Matthias turned against the Ottomans, who had devastated the eastern parts of Hungary. He sent reinforcements to [[Stephen the Great]], [[Prince of Moldavia]], enabling Stephen to repel a series of Ottoman invasions in the late 1470s. In 1476, Matthias besieged and seized [[\u0160abac]], an important Ottoman border fort. He concluded a peace treaty with Vladislaus Jagiellon in 1478, confirming the division of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] between them. Matthias waged a war against Emperor Frederick and occupied [[Lower Austria]] between 1482 and 1487.\n\nMatthias established one of the earliest professional standing armies of medieval Europe (the [[Black Army of Hungary]]), reformed the administration of justice, reduced the power of the barons, and promoted the careers of talented individuals chosen for their abilities rather than their social statuses. Matthias patronized art and science; his royal library, the ''[[Bibliotheca Corviniana]]'', was one of the largest collections of books in Europe. With his patronage, Hungary became the first country to embrace the [[Renaissance]] from Italy. As Matthias the Just, the monarch who wandered among his subjects in disguise, he remains a popular hero of Hungarian folk tales.\n\n==Early life==\n\n[[File:Matei Corvin house Cluj-Napoca.jpg|thumb|right|The house where Matthias Corvinus was born |The [[Matthias Corvinus House, Cluj-Napoca|house where Matthias Corvinus was born]] in Kolozsv\u00e1r (present-day [[Cluj-Napoca]], Romania)]]\n[[File:M\u00e1ty\u00e1s kir\u00e1ly fiatalkori eszm\u00e9nyes\u00edtett domborm\u0171-k\u00e9pm\u00e1sa a milan\u00f3i Castello Sforzesco m\u00fazeum\u00e1ban.jpg|thumb|left|Matthias Corvinus as young monarch.

For instance, a Latin translation of [[Xenophon]]'s [[Cyropaedia|biography of Cyrus the Great]], [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]]'s book of [[Alexander the Great]], and a military treatise by the contemporaneous [[Roberto Valturio]] survived.

Corvin}}, {{lang-sk|Matej Korv\u00edn}}, {{lang-cz|Maty\u00e1\u0161 Korv\u00edn}}; {{daterangedash|23 February 1443|6 April 1490|dmy}}), was [[King of Hungary]] and [[King of Croatia|Croatia]] from 1458 to 1490. After conducting several military campaigns, he was elected [[King of Bohemia]] in 1469 and adopted the title [[Duke of Austria]] in 1487. He was the son of [[John Hunyadi]], [[Regent of Hungary]], who died in 1456. In 1457, Matthias was imprisoned along with his older brother, [[Ladislaus Hunyadi]], on the orders of King [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]]. Ladislaus Hunyadi was executed, causing a rebellion that forced King Ladislaus to flee Hungary. After the King died unexpectedly, Matthias's uncle [[Michael Szil\u00e1gyi]] persuaded the [[Estates of the realm|Estates]] to unanimously proclaim Matthias king on 24 January 1458. He began his rule under his uncle's guardianship, but he took effective control of government within two weeks.\n\nAs king, Matthias waged wars against the Czech [[mercenaries]] who dominated [[Upper Hungary]] (today parts of [[Slovakia]] and [[Northern Hungary]]) and against [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]], who claimed Hungary for himself. In this period, the [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered [[Despotate of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]], terminating the zone of [[buffer state]]s along the southern frontiers of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Matthias signed a peace treaty with Frederick III in 1463, acknowledging the Emperor's right to style himself King of Hungary. The Emperor returned the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]] with which Matthias was crowned on 29 April 1464. In this year, Matthias invaded the territories that had recently been occupied by the Ottomans and seized fortresses in Bosnia. He soon realized he could expect no substantial aid from the Christian powers and gave up his anti-Ottoman policy.\n\nMatthias introduced new taxes and regularly collected extraordinary taxes. These measures caused a rebellion in [[Transylvania]] in 1467, but he subdued the rebels. The next year, Matthias declared war on [[George of Pod\u011bbrady]], the [[Hussite]] King of Bohemia, and conquered [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], and [[Lausitz]], but he could not occupy [[Bohemia]] proper. The Catholic Estates proclaimed him King of Bohemia on 3 May 1469, but the Hussite lords refused to yield to him even after the death of their leader George of Pod\u011bbrady in 1471. Instead, they elected [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus Jagiellon]], the eldest son of [[Casimir IV of Poland]]. A group of Hungarian prelates and lords offered the throne to Vladislaus's younger brother [[Saint Casimir|Casimir]], but Matthias overcame their rebellion. Having routed the united troops of Casimir IV and Vladislaus at [[Breslau]] in [[Silesia]] (now Wroc\u0142aw in Poland) in late 1474, Matthias turned against the Ottomans, who had devastated the eastern parts of Hungary. He sent reinforcements to [[Stephen the Great]], [[Prince of Moldavia]], enabling Stephen to repel a series of Ottoman invasions in the late 1470s. In 1476, Matthias besieged and seized [[\u0160abac]], an important Ottoman border fort. He concluded a peace treaty with Vladislaus Jagiellon in 1478, confirming the division of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] between them. Matthias waged a war against Emperor Frederick and occupied [[Lower Austria]] between 1482 and 1487.\n\nMatthias established one of the earliest professional standing armies of medieval Europe (the [[Black Army of Hungary]]), reformed the administration of justice, reduced the power of the barons, and promoted the careers of talented individuals chosen for their abilities rather than their social statuses. Matthias patronized art and science; his royal library, the ''[[Bibliotheca Corviniana]]'', was one of the largest collections of books in Europe.

Kov\u00e1cs|1990|p=161}} [[Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg]] proposed one of his daughters to Matthias but the Hungarian Estates opposed this plan.{{sfn|E. Kov\u00e1cs|1990|p=161}} In an attempt to enter into an alliance with King Casimir IV of Poland, Matthias proposed to the King's daughter [[Hedwig Jagiellon, Duchess of Bavaria|Hedvig]] but he was refused.{{sfn|E. Kov\u00e1cs|1990|p=105}}{{sfn|Teke|1981|p=290}} During the 1470 meeting of Emperor Frederick and Matthias, a marriage between Matthias and the Emperor's five-year-old daughter [[Kunigunde of Austria]] was also discussed, but the Emperor was not willing to commit himself to the marriage.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=78}}\n\nMatthias's third wife Beatrice of Naples was born in 1457.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=80}} Their engagement was announced in Breslau on 30 October 1474, during the siege of the town by Casimir IV and Vladislaus Jagiellon.{{sfn|Teke|1981|p=296}} Her dowry amounted to 200,000 gold pieces.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=88}} Beatrice survived her husband and returned to Naples where she died in 1508.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=150}}\n\nMatthias's only known child John Corvinus was born out of wedlock in 1473.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=134}}{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=94}} His mother [[Barbara Edelp\u00f6ck]]{{mdash}}the daughter of a citizen of Stein in Lower Austria{{mdash}}met the King in early 1470.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=134}} John Corvinus died on 12 October 1504.{{sfn|E.

Statuia lui Matei Corvin.jpg|thumb|[[Matthias Corvinus Monument]] in front of [[St. Michael's Church, Cluj-Napoca|St. Michael's Church]] (Cluj-Napoca)]]\n\nAccording to Marcus Tanner, Matthias ruled \"a European superpower\" at the end of his reign.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=xi}} His conquests, however, were lost within months of his death.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=xv}} The burghers of Breslau soon murdered his captain Heinz Dompnig.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=102}} The Emperor's rule in Vienna and Wiener Neustadt was restored without resistance.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\nStephen Z\u00e1polya said the King's death relieved \"Hungary of the trouble and oppression from which it had suffered so far\".{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=345}} Royal authority quickly diminished because various claimants{{mdash}}John Corvinus, Maximilian of the Romans, Vladislaus Jagiellon, and the latter's younger brother, [[John I Albert|John Albert]]{{mdash}}were fighting for the crown.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=69}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=344}} Vladislaus Jagiellon triumphed because the barons regarded him as a weak ruler and he gained the support of Matthias's wealthy widow by promising to marry her.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=69}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=345}} Vladislaus was elected king after he promised he would abolish all \"harmful innovations\" introduced by Matthias, especially the extraordinary tax.{{sfn|Bak|1994|p=76}} Vladislaus could not finance the maintenance of the Black Army and the unpaid mercenaries began plundering the countryside.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=69}} A royal force led by Paul Kinizsi eliminated them on the river Sz\u00e1va in 1492.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=69}}{{sfn|Teke|1981|p=321}}\n\nThe burden of Matthias's wars and splendid royal court mainly fell on the peasants, who paid at least 85% of the taxes.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|pp=66\u201367}}{{sfn|Bak|1994|p=71}} The ''Chronicle of Dubnic'', written in eastern Hungary in 1479, says \"widows and orphans\" cursed the King for the high taxes.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=166}} However, stories about \"Matthias the Just\", who wandered in disguise throughout his realm to deliver justice to his subjects, seem to have spread during Matthias's reign.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=174\u2013175}} The saying \"Dead is Matthias, lost is justice\" became popular soon after his death, reflecting that commoners were more likely to have received a fair trial in Matthias's reign than under his successors.{{sfn|Bak|1994|p=74}}{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=63}} Matthias is also the subject of popular folk tales in Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, and Slovenia.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=177}} For instance, [[King Matja\u017e]] is one of the [[King asleep in mountain|sleeping kings]] of Slovenian folklore.{{sfn|Luk\u00e1cs|2010|pp=371\u2013379}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=177}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<Center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Matthias I (Chronica Hungarorum).jpg|Matthias I (Chronica Hungarorum)\nFile:Matei
