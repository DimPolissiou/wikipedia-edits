The core storyline focuses on a plantation owned by Sintil, the local oungan (vodou priest), and run by zonbis. The zonbis, humans brought back to life from a death-like state by an oungan to work, are essentially slaves. They cannot speak, cannot think, and have no more cognitive function than is required to work the plantation. \n\nSintil controls the zonbis with the help of his daughter Siltana and a hired man named Zof\u00e8. Sintil frequently reminds Siltana that she must remember to never give the zonbis salt because if they taste it they will wake up. At the beginning of the book Siltana is happy to follow her father's directives. However when a new zonbi named Klodonis is brought to the plantation she falls in love with him and loses interest in her normal duties on the ranch. She is devastated by the fact that Klodonis is in a permanent stupor and cannot reciprocate her feelings. Her frustration buillds throughout the book until at last in desperation she gives Klodonis salt and restores him to being fully human. Unfortunately, far from being in love with her, Klodonis knocks her to the ground and immediately revives the rest of the zonbis, launching a rebellion against Sintil which eventually spreads to the village and culminates in Sintil's bloody demise.\n\nThe majority of the main plotline happens in the very end of the book. There are, however, several smaller plotlines sprinkled throughout ''D\u00e9zafi,'' which focus on other villagers in Bouan\u00e8f and how their lives are affected by Sintil\u2019s presence. J\u00e9r\u00f2m, for example, is a villager who hides in his brother\u2019s attic for almost the entirety of the book out of fear of Sintil. Another character, Gaston, uses his winnings from a lucky day at gambling to travel to Port-au-Prince. Unfortunately, once there he cannot earn enough money to make a stable living and languishes on the streets for years before attempting to return to Bouan\u00e8f just as the revolution is taking place. However when he sees the chaotic revolution occurring in the village he turns around and walks back towards Port-au-Prince. Still another villager, J\u00e9d\u00e9yon, lives alone in an old house with his niece Rita. J\u00e9d\u00e9yon has been abandoned by his wife and family who left for the United States without him and he constantly berates and chastises Rita, who takes care of him and the house. He dies before the rebellion.\n\nThere is an additional abstract plotline which centers on a series of cock fight (d\u00e9zafis, in Haitian). When Sintil is at last apprehended and killed it is at one of these cock fights. \n\n== Structure ==\n[[File:Franketienne Painting.jpg|thumb|318x318px|An untitled spiralist painting by Frank\u00e9tienne. |alt=]]\nDue to its spiralist influences, ''D\u00e9zafi'' is unconventional in structure and formatting. It follows a spiral-like structure, in which the narrative bends back to where it began with multiple repetitions and reiterations of points and details.<ref name=\":4\" /> The main story progresses on and up, building to the climax with numerous other voices and perspectives included to build the sense that the whole narrative reality is collective and exists both objectively and subjectively.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe original 1975 includes three types of text: italics, bold with forward slashes, and indented standard roman type.

It follows a spiral-like structure, in which the narrative bends back to where it began with multiple repetitions and reiterations of points and details.<ref name=\":4\" /> The main story progresses on and up, building to the climax with numerous other voices and perspectives included to build the sense that the whole narrative reality is collective and exists both objectively and subjectively.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe original 1975 includes three types of text: italics, bold with forward slashes, and indented standard roman type. These three different formats are interwoven throughout the text, such that a single page might have portions of each.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe standard roman type is used predominantly for the plot and concrete experiences of the characters, but it accounts for less than half of the text of ''D\u00e9zafi''. The rest is written in either italics or bold and does not relate directly to the plotline of the book, but rather has a more poetic and abstract significance with regards to [[Culture of Haiti|Haitian culture]]. Frequently these sections are related to the titular d\u00e9zafi (cock fight) and they are often narrated in first person plural.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the later 2002 edition of the book many more font sizes and typefaces were added beyond the original three, n addition to other changes relating to spelling and formatting.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== Political Message ==\nIn ''D\u00e9zafi'' Sintil and his cronies are a veiled allegory for the [[Duvalier dynasty|Duvalier regime]] which ruled Haiti at the time when D\u00e9zafi was written.<ref name=\":5\">McFee, Mollie (2017). \"Beyond Translation: The Matrice of Frank\u00e9tienne's Dezafi\". ''Comparative Literature Studies''. '''54''' (2): 381\u2013405. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.5325/complitstudies.54.2.0381. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&nbsp;0010-4132.</ref> The zonbis in ''D\u00e9zafi'' are meant to represent Haitians living under the Duvalier regime.<ref name=\":5\" /> Frank\u00e9tienne was hinting that the Duvalier regime could be overturned through an uprising of the populace of Haiti, just as Sintil was only overthrown when the zonbis finally woke up and exacted their vengeance. And as Sintil was only overthrown once the ''zonbis'' had their humanity restored, Frank\u00e9tienne implies that an uprising can only take place once the people of Haiti awaken from their subservient stupor.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nUnfortunately, at the time of ''D\u00e9zafi''<nowiki/>'s publication much of Haiti was illiterate and thus could not access Frank\u00e9tienne\u2019s message. Only 20% of Haitians could read, and many of that number were against the idea of writing in Creole, preferring French.<ref name=\":5\" /> Therefore, the general public of Haiti was not able to read ''D\u00e9zafi'' and Frank\u00e9tienne's attempt to call the people to revolt against the Duvalier regime fell on deaf ears. For this reason he later switched to writing plays, which the ordinary citizen could access. This decision irritated the Duvalier regime.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|last=Archibold|first=Randal C.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/30/world/americas/30haiti.html|title=A Prolific Father of Haitian Letters, Busier Than Ever|date=2011-04-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n''D\u00e9zafi'' is widely seen as an influential piece of [[Haitian literature]].<ref name=\":3\" /> Frank\u00e9tienne was named an Artist for Peace by [[UNESCO]] in 2010<ref>[https://news.un.org/en/story/2010/03/333482-haitian-writer-franketienne-named-unesco-artist-peace \"Haitian writer Frank\u00e9tienne named UNESCO Artist for Peace\"].

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film.\n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is a re-imagining of the Norman and Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel set ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"4\" | Original series \n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Title\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' (TV spin-off film)\n| N/A\n| 1\n| July 5, 1987\n| July 5, 1987\n| [[Richard Rothstein (screenwriter)|Richard Rothstein]], [[Ken Topolsky]]\n| [[NBC]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'' (TV series)\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| [[Carlton Cuse]], [[Kerry Ehrin]], [[Anthony Cipriano]]\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nAlex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum for killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willie ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Mrs. Bates]], are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]].

Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', the ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

Russell (cinematographer)|John L. Russell]] and Best Art Direction for [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]], [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clatworthy]] and [[George Milo]]. All three sequels have been nominated for [[Saturn Awards]]: ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' for Best Supporting Actress ([[Meg Tilly]]); ''[[Psycho III]]'' for Best Horror Film and Best Actor ([[Anthony Perkins]]); and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies (attraction)|Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation, ''Psycho: The Musical'', was performed January 25 to February 9, 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in 1959 for the production of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. It has been said that the house, designed by art directors [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]] and [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clathworthy]], was loosely based on an [[Edward Hopper]] painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''Psycho'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and ''[[Thriller (American TV series)|Boris Karloff's Thriller]]''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented [[Studio Tour|Studio Tram Tour]]. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. A 1992 episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' called \"Incident in Lot 7\" featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular [[Angela Lansbury]] series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four ''Psycho'' films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===''78/52'' documentary (2017) ===\n\nA documentary examination of the ''Psycho'' shower scene was released on October 13, 2017 by director [[Alexandre O. Philippe]] running 91 minutes. The cast of participants included [[Guillermo del Toro]], [[Peter Bogdanovich]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Karyn Kusama]], [[Eli Roth]], [[Oz Perkins]], [[Leigh Whannell]], [[Walter Murch]], [[Danny Elfman]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Richard Stanley (director)|Richard Stanley]] and [[Neil Marshall]].<ref>. {{cite web | date = January 24, 2017 | author = Owen Gleiberman | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/7852-review-psycho-1201966555/ | title = Film Review: \u201878/52: Hitchcock\u2019s Shower Scene\u2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Janet Leigh|Leigh, Janet]]; Nickens, Christopher (1995).

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film.\n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is a re-imagining of the Norman and Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel set ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"4\" | Original series \n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money.

Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago.

Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]].

Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Title\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' (TV spin-off film)\n| N/A\n| 1\n| July 5, 1987\n| July 5, 1987\n| [[Richard Rothstein (screenwriter)|Richard Rothstein]], [[Ken Topolsky]]\n| [[NBC]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'' (TV series)\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| [[Carlton Cuse]], [[Kerry Ehrin]], [[Anthony Cipriano]]\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nA [[television film|made-for-TV]] [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film. Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum for killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willie ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Mrs. Bates]], are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network. The series is a television reboot set in the 2010s and chronicle [[Norman Bates]]' early childhood with his mother and how she drove him to become a killer. In July 2012, A&E ordered 10 episodes of the series, skipping the initial pilot stage. The series takes place in the modern day and stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as young Norman Bates and [[Vera Farmiga]] as [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Mrs. Bates]]. The series premiered on March 18, 2013 and produced five seasons for a total of 50 episodes. The series was shot in [[Vancouver]] with a replica of the Psycho house from [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and a recreation of the original Bates Motel from the first movie. The original interior sets have also been recreated.\n\n==Cast==\n===Principal cast===\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; width:95%; float:center; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; display:table;\">\n<center>'''List indicator(s)'''</center>\n*A {{note label|Young|Y}} indicates the actor portrayed the role of a younger version of the character.\n*A dark grey cell indicates the character was not in the film.\n</blockquote>\n\n{{Clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" width=\"14%\" | Characters\n! colspan=\"4\"  | Original series\n!

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film.

The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original. He describes it as a \"Slow, stilted, completely pointless scene-for-scene remake of the Hitchcock classic (with a few awkward new touches to taint its claim as an exact replica.)\" He ultimately calls it \"an insult, rather than a tribute to a landmark film.\"{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Continuity===\nWhile ''Bates Motel'' (1987) was a partial continuation of the series as it continued from where ''Psycho'' left off, it ignored the continuity of ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'', and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' due to the death of Norman Bates in the film and the fact that Bates is deemed sane and returns to the Bates Motel in ''Psycho II''. ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', the ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

Russell (cinematographer)|John L. Russell]] and Best Art Direction for [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]], [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clatworthy]] and [[George Milo]]. All three sequels have been nominated for [[Saturn Awards]]: ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' for Best Supporting Actress ([[Meg Tilly]]); ''[[Psycho III]]'' for Best Horror Film and Best Actor ([[Anthony Perkins]]); and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies (attraction)|Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation, ''Psycho: The Musical'', was performed January 25 to February 9, 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in 1959 for the production of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. It has been said that the house, designed by art directors [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]] and [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clathworthy]], was loosely based on an [[Edward Hopper]] painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''Psycho'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and ''[[Thriller (American TV series)|Boris Karloff's Thriller]]''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented [[Studio Tour|Studio Tram Tour]]. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. A 1992 episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' called \"Incident in Lot 7\" featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular [[Angela Lansbury]] series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four ''Psycho'' films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===''78/52'' documentary (2017) ===\n\nA documentary examination of the ''Psycho'' shower scene was released on October 13, 2017 by director [[Alexandre O.

An early example of the [[platform game]] genre, the [[gameplay]] focuses on maneuvering the main character across a series of platforms while dodging and jumping over obstacles. In the game, [[Mario]] (originally named Mr. Video and then Jumpman) must rescue a [[damsel in distress]] named [[Pauline (Nintendo)|Pauline]] (originally named Lady), from a giant ape named [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]]. The hero and ape later became two of Nintendo's most popular and recognizable characters. ''Donkey Kong'' is one of the most important games from the [[golden age of arcade video games]] as well as one of the most popular arcade games of all time.\nThe game was the latest in a series of efforts by Nintendo to break into the North American market. [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]], Nintendo's president at the time, assigned the project to a first-time [[video game design]]er named [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. Drawing from a wide range of inspirations, including ''[[Popeye]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'', and ''[[King Kong]]'', Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game alongside Nintendo's chief engineer, [[Gunpei Yokoi]]. The two men broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization, including [[cutscene]]s to advance the game's plot and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay.\n\nAlthough Nintendo's American staff was initially apprehensive, ''Donkey Kong'' succeeded commercially and critically in North America and Japan. Nintendo [[license]]d the game to [[Coleco]], who developed home [[Video game console|console]] versions for numerous platforms. Other companies [[Video game clone|cloned]] Nintendo's hit and avoided royalties altogether. Miyamoto's characters appeared on cereal boxes, television cartoons, and dozens of other places. A lawsuit brought by [[Universal Studios|Universal City Studios]] (later Universal Studios), alleging ''Donkey Kong'' violated its trademark of ''King Kong'', ultimately failed. The success of ''Donkey Kong'' and Nintendo's victory in the courtroom helped to position the company for video-game market dominance from its release in 1981 until the late 1990s.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Donkey Kong Gameplay.png|thumb|left|Gameplay of ''Donkey Kong'' in the first stage, with Mario holding a [[hammer]].]]\n\nFollowing 1980's ''[[Space Panic]]'', ''Donkey Kong'' is one of the earliest examples of the [[platform game]] genre<ref name=\"Chris Crawford\"/>{{rp|94}}<ref>{{Allgame|4724|Space Panic}}</ref> even prior to the term being coined; the U.S. gaming press used ''climbing game'' for games with platforms and ladders.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Player's Guide to Climbing Games |journal=Electronic Games |date=January 1983 |volume=1 |issue=11 |page=49 |url=https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_11_1983-01_Reese_Communications_US#page/n47/mode/2up |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319134356/https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_11_1983-01_Reese_Communications_US |archivedate=March 19, 2016 }}</ref> As the first platform game to feature jumping, ''Donkey Kong'' requires the player to jump between gaps and over obstacles or approaching enemies, setting the template for the future of the platform genre.<ref name=\"GamesRadar\">{{cite web|title=Gaming's most important evolutions |page=3 |publisher=[[GamesRadar]] |date=October 8, 2010 |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035/p-3 |accessdate=April 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319151505/http://www.gamesradar.com/gamings-most-important-evolutions/ |archivedate=March 19, 2012  }}</ref> With its four unique stages, ''Donkey Kong'' was the most complex arcade game at the time of its release, and one of the first arcade games to feature multiple stages, following 1980's ''[[Phoenix (video game)|Phoenix]]'' and 1981's ''[[Gorf]]'' and ''[[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]]''{{rp|66}}<ref name=\"Arcade Fever\"/>\n\nCompetitive video gamers and referees stress the game's high level of difficulty compared to other classic arcade games. Winning the game requires patience and the ability to accurately time Mario's ascent.<ref name=\"High Score!\"/>{{rp|82}} In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game also gives the player a score. Points are awarded for the following: leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer [[power-up]]; collecting items such as hats, [[Umbrella|parasols]], and purses (presumably belonging to Pauline); removing rivets from platforms, and completing each stage (determined by a steadily decreasing bonus counter). The player typically receives three lives with a [[1-up|bonus]] awarded for 7,000 points, although this can be modified via the game's built-in [[Dip switch|DIP switches]]. One life is lost whenever Mario touches Donkey Kong or any enemy object, falls too far through a gap or off the end of a platform, or lets the bonus counter reach zero.\n\nThe game is divided into four different single-screen stages. Each represents 25 meters of the structure Donkey Kong has climbed, one stage being 25 meters higher than the previous. The final stage occurs at 100 meters. Stage one involves Mario scaling a construction site made of crooked girders and ladders while jumping over or hammering barrels and oil drums tossed by Donkey Kong.  Stage two involves climbing a five-story structure of [[conveyor belt]]s, each of which transport cement pans.  The third stage involves the player riding elevators while avoiding bouncing springs. The fourth and final stage requires Mario to remove eight rivets from the platforms supporting Donkey Kong; removing the final rivet causes Donkey Kong to fall and the hero to be reunited with Pauline.<ref name=\"King of Kong\"/> These four stages combine to form a level.\n\nUpon completion of the fourth stage, the level then increments, and the game repeats the stages with progressive difficulty. For example, Donkey Kong begins to hurl barrels faster and sometimes diagonally, and fireballs speed up. The victory music alternates between levels 1 and 2. The fourth level, however, consists of 5 stages with the final stage at 125 meters. The 22nd level is colloquially known as the [[kill screen]], due to an error in the game's programming that kills Mario after a few seconds, effectively ending the game.<ref name=\"King of Kong\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Anchor|Story and characters}}\n[[File:Dkong end.png|thumb|On the final screen of each level, [[Mario]] and Pauline are reunited.]]\n''Donkey Kong'' is considered to be the earliest video game with a storyline that visually unfolds on screen.<ref name=\"GamesRadar\"/> The eponymous [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong character]] is the game's ''[[de facto]]'' villain.

Donkey Kong smirks upon Mario's demise. Pauline has a pink dress and long hair,<ref name=\"Gender Inclusive\"/>{{rp|19\u201320}} and a speech balloon crying \"HELP!\" appears frequently beside her. Mario, depicted in red overalls and a red cap, is an [[everyman]] character, a type common in Japan.

Pauline, for example, is depicted as disheveled (like ''King Kong''{{'s}} [[Fay Wray]]) in a torn dress and [[stiletto heel]]s.<ref name=\"Gender Inclusive\"/>{{rp|19\u201320}}\n\n''Donkey Kong'' is the first example of a complete narrative told in video game form and, like 1980s ''[[Pac-Man]]'', it employs [[cutscene]]s to advance its plot. The game opens with the gorilla climbing a pair of ladders to the top of a construction site. He sets Pauline down and stomps his feet, causing the steel beams to change shape. He moves to his final perch and sneers. A melody plays, and the level (or stage) starts. This brief animation sets the scene and adds background to the gameplay, a first for video games. Upon reaching the end of the stage, another cutscene begins. A heart appears between Mario and Pauline, but Donkey Kong grabs her and climbs higher, causing the heart to break. The narrative concludes when Mario reaches the end of the rivet stage. He and Pauline are reunited, and a short intermission plays.<ref name=\"Power-up\"/>{{rp|40\u201342}} The gameplay then loops from the beginning at a higher level of difficulty, without any formal ending.\n\n==Development==\n{{Anchor|Development and release}}\n[[File:Donkey_Kong_arcade_at_the_QuakeCon_2005.png|thumb|Small model based on original arcade cabinet]]\nAs of early 1981, Nintendo's efforts to expand to North America had failed, culminating with the attempted export of the otherwise successful ''[[Radar Scope]]''.

The 1983 spinoff ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' introduced Mario's brother Luigi in a single-screen cooperative game set in a sewer, and launched the ''Mario'' franchise. Also in 1983, ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'' appeared in the form of a [[fixed shooter]], with an exterminator ridding the ape\u2014and insects\u2014from a greenhouse.\n\nNintendo revived the ''Donkey Kong'' franchise in the 1990s for a series of platform games and spin-offs developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]], beginning with ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' in [[1994 in video gaming|1994]]. In [[2004 in video gaming|2004]], Nintendo released ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong]]'', a sequel to the Game Boy's ''Donkey Kong'', in which Mario must chase Donkey Kong to get back the stolen Mini-Mario toys. In the follow-up ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis]]'', Donkey Kong once again falls in love with Pauline and kidnaps her, and Mario uses the Mini-Mario toys to help him rescue her. ''Donkey Kong Racing'' for the GameCube was in development by Rare, but was canceled when Microsoft purchased the company. In 2004, Nintendo released the first of the ''[[Donkey Konga]]'' games, a rhythm-based game series that uses a special bongo controller. ''[[Donkey Kong Jungle Beat]]'' ([[2005 in video gaming|2005]]) is a unique platform action game that uses the same bongo controller accessory. In [[2007 in video gaming|2007]], ''[[Donkey Kong Barrel Blast]]'' was released for the Nintendo Wii. It was originally developed as a GameCube game and would have used the bongo controller, but it was delayed and released exclusively as a [[Wii]] game with no support for the bongo accessory. The ''Donkey Kong Country'' series was revived by [[Retro Studios]] in 2010 with the release of ''[[Donkey Kong Country Returns]]'', and its sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze]]'', in 2014. \n\n''Donkey Kong'' appears as a game in the Wii U game ''[[NES Remix]]'', which features multiple NES games and sometimes \"remixes\" them by presenting significantly modified versions of the games as challenges. One such challenge features Link from ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' traveling through the first screen to save Pauline.  The difficulty is increased compared to the original ''Donkey Kong'' because Link cannot jump, as in ''Zelda''.\n\n===Licensing===\nBy late June 1982, ''Donkey Kong''{{'}}s success had prompted more than 50 parties in the U.S. and Japan to license the game's characters.<ref name=\"Ultimate History\" />{{rp|215}} Mario and his simian nemesis appeared on cereal boxes, board games, pajamas, and [[manga]]. In 1983, the animation studio [[Ruby-Spears Productions|Ruby-Spears]] produced a ''Donkey Kong'' cartoon (as well as ''Donkey Kong Jr.'') for the ''[[Saturday Supercade]]'' program on CBS. In the show, mystery crime-solving plots in the mode of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' are framed around the premise of Mario and Pauline chasing Donkey Kong (voiced by [[Soupy Sales]]), who has escaped from the circus. The show lasted two seasons.\n\n===In popular culture===\nSince its original release, ''Donkey Kong''{{'s}} success has entrenched the game in [[Culture of the United States|American popular culture]]. In 1982, [[Buckner & Garcia]] and R. Cade and the Video Victims both recorded songs (\"[[Pac-Man Fever (album)|Do the Donkey Kong]]\" and \"Donkey Kong\", respectively) based on the game. Artists like [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince]] and [[Trace Adkins]] referenced the game in songs. Episodes of television series such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'', ''[[Crank Yankers]]'' and ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' have also contained references to the game. Even today, sound effects from the Atari 2600 version often serve as generic video game sounds in films and television series. The phrase \"It's on like Donkey Kong\" has been used in various works of popular culture.

An early example of the [[platform game]] genre, the [[gameplay]] focuses on maneuvering the main character across a series of platforms while dodging and jumping over obstacles. In the game, [[Mario]] (originally named Mr. Video and then Jumpman) must rescue a [[damsel in distress]] named [[Pauline (Nintendo)|Pauline]] (originally named Lady), from a giant ape named [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]]. The hero and ape later became two of Nintendo's most popular and recognizable characters. ''Donkey Kong'' is one of the most important games from the [[golden age of arcade video games]] as well as one of the most popular arcade games of all time.\nThe game was the latest in a series of efforts by Nintendo to break into the North American market. [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]], Nintendo's president at the time, assigned the project to a first-time [[video game design]]er named [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. Drawing from a wide range of inspirations, including ''[[Popeye]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'', and ''[[King Kong]]'', Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game alongside Nintendo's chief engineer, [[Gunpei Yokoi]]. The two men broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization, including [[cutscene]]s to advance the game's plot and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay.\n\nAlthough Nintendo's American staff was initially apprehensive, ''Donkey Kong'' succeeded commercially and critically in North America and Japan. Nintendo [[license]]d the game to [[Coleco]], who developed home [[Video game console|console]] versions for numerous platforms. Other companies [[Video game clone|cloned]] Nintendo's hit and avoided royalties altogether. Miyamoto's characters appeared on cereal boxes, television cartoons, and dozens of other places. A lawsuit brought by [[Universal Studios|Universal City Studios]] (later Universal Studios), alleging ''Donkey Kong'' violated its trademark of ''King Kong'', ultimately failed. The success of ''Donkey Kong'' and Nintendo's victory in the courtroom helped to position the company for video-game market dominance from its release in 1981 until the late 1990s.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Donkey Kong Gameplay.png|thumb|left|Gameplay of ''Donkey Kong'' in the first stage, with Mario holding a [[hammer]].]]\n\nFollowing 1980's ''[[Space Panic]]'', ''Donkey Kong'' is one of the earliest examples of the [[platform game]] genre<ref name=\"Chris Crawford\"/>{{rp|94}}<ref>{{Allgame|4724|Space Panic}}</ref> even prior to the term being coined; the U.S. gaming press used ''climbing game'' for games with platforms and ladders.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Player's Guide to Climbing Games |journal=Electronic Games |date=January 1983 |volume=1 |issue=11 |page=49 |url=https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_11_1983-01_Reese_Communications_US#page/n47/mode/2up |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319134356/https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_11_1983-01_Reese_Communications_US |archivedate=March 19, 2016 }}</ref> As the first platform game to feature jumping, ''Donkey Kong'' requires the player to jump between gaps and over obstacles or approaching enemies, setting the template for the future of the platform genre.<ref name=\"GamesRadar\">{{cite web|title=Gaming's most important evolutions |page=3 |publisher=[[GamesRadar]] |date=October 8, 2010 |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035/p-3 |accessdate=April 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319151505/http://www.gamesradar.com/gamings-most-important-evolutions/ |archivedate=March 19, 2012  }}</ref> With its four unique stages, ''Donkey Kong'' was the most complex arcade game at the time of its release, and one of the first arcade games to feature multiple stages, following 1980's ''[[Phoenix (video game)|Phoenix]]'' and 1981's ''[[Gorf]]'' and ''[[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]]''{{rp|66}}<ref name=\"Arcade Fever\"/>\n\nCompetitive video gamers and referees stress the game's high level of difficulty compared to other classic arcade games. Winning the game requires patience and the ability to accurately time Mario's ascent.<ref name=\"High Score!\"/>{{rp|82}} In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game also gives the player a score. Points are awarded for the following: leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer [[power-up]]; collecting items such as hats, [[Umbrella|parasols]], and purses (presumably belonging to Pauline); removing rivets from platforms, and completing each stage (determined by a steadily decreasing bonus counter). The player typically receives three lives with a [[1-up|bonus]] awarded for 7,000 points, although this can be modified via the game's built-in [[Dip switch|DIP switches]]. One life is lost whenever Mario touches Donkey Kong or any enemy object, falls too far through a gap or off the end of a platform, or lets the bonus counter reach zero.\n\nThe game is divided into four different single-screen stages. Each represents 25 meters of the structure Donkey Kong has climbed, one stage being 25 meters higher than the previous. The final stage occurs at 100 meters. Stage one involves Mario scaling a construction site made of crooked girders and ladders while jumping over or hammering barrels and oil drums tossed by Donkey Kong.  Stage two involves climbing a five-story structure of [[conveyor belt]]s, each of which transport cement pans.  The third stage involves the player riding elevators while avoiding bouncing springs. The fourth and final stage requires Mario to remove eight rivets from the platforms supporting Donkey Kong; removing the final rivet causes Donkey Kong to fall and the hero to be reunited with Pauline.<ref name=\"King of Kong\"/> These four stages combine to form a level.\n\nUpon completion of the fourth stage, the level then increments, and the game repeats the stages with progressive difficulty. For example, Donkey Kong begins to hurl barrels faster and sometimes diagonally, and fireballs speed up. The victory music alternates between levels 1 and 2. The fourth level, however, consists of 5 stages with the final stage at 125 meters. The 22nd level is colloquially known as the [[kill screen]], due to an error in the game's programming that kills Mario after a few seconds, effectively ending the game.<ref name=\"King of Kong\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Anchor|Story and characters}}\n[[File:Dkong end.png|thumb|On the final screen of each level, [[Mario]] and Pauline are reunited.]]\n''Donkey Kong'' is considered to be the earliest video game with a storyline that visually unfolds on screen.<ref name=\"GamesRadar\"/> The eponymous [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong character]] is the game's ''[[de facto]]'' villain.

The player must take the role of Mario and rescue her. This is the first occurrence of the [[damsel in distress]] scenario that provided the template for countless video games to come.<ref name=\"High Score!\"/>{{rp|82}}\n\nThe game uses graphics and animation for characterization. Donkey Kong smirks upon Mario's demise. Pauline has a pink dress and long hair,<ref name=\"Gender Inclusive\"/>{{rp|19\u201320}} and a speech balloon crying \"HELP!\" appears frequently beside her. Mario, depicted in red overalls and a red cap, is an [[everyman]] character, a type common in Japan. Graphical limitations and the low pixel resolution of the small [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] prompted his design: drawing a mouth with so few pixels was infeasible, so the character was given a mustache;<ref name=\"Power-up\"/>{{rp|37}} the programmers could not animate hair, so he got a cap; to make his arm movements visible, he needed colored overalls.<ref name=\"High Score!\"/>{{rp|238}} The artwork used for the cabinets and promotional materials make these cartoon-like character designs even more explicit. Pauline, for example, is depicted as disheveled (like ''King Kong''{{'s}} [[Fay Wray]]) in a torn dress and [[stiletto heel]]s.<ref name=\"Gender Inclusive\"/>{{rp|19\u201320}}\n\n''Donkey Kong'' is the first example of a complete narrative told in video game form and, like 1980s ''[[Pac-Man]]'', it employs [[cutscene]]s to advance its plot. The game opens with the gorilla climbing a pair of ladders to the top of a construction site. He sets Pauline down and stomps his feet, causing the steel beams to change shape. He moves to his final perch and sneers. A melody plays, and the level (or stage) starts. This brief animation sets the scene and adds background to the gameplay, a first for video games. Upon reaching the end of the stage, another cutscene begins. A heart appears between Mario and Pauline, but Donkey Kong grabs her and climbs higher, causing the heart to break. The narrative concludes when Mario reaches the end of the rivet stage. He and Pauline are reunited, and a short intermission plays.<ref name=\"Power-up\"/>{{rp|40\u201342}} The gameplay then loops from the beginning at a higher level of difficulty, without any formal ending.\n\n==Development==\n{{Anchor|Development and release}}\n[[File:Donkey_Kong_arcade_at_the_QuakeCon_2005.png|thumb|Small model based on original arcade cabinet]]\nAs of early 1981, Nintendo's efforts to expand to North America had failed, culminating with the attempted export of the otherwise successful ''[[Radar Scope]]''. They were left with a large number of unsold ''Radar Scope'' machines, so company president [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]] thought of simply converting them into something new. He approached a young [[industrial design]]er named [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], who had been working for Nintendo since 1977, to see if he could design such a replacement.

One of the first releases from [[Electronic Arts]] was ''[[Hard Hat Mack]]'' (Apple II, 1983), a three-stage game without an ape, but using the construction site setting from ''Donkey Kong''.

The 1983 spinoff ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' introduced Mario's brother Luigi in a single-screen cooperative game set in a sewer, and launched the ''Mario'' franchise. Also in 1983, ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'' appeared in the form of a [[fixed shooter]], with an exterminator ridding the ape\u2014and insects\u2014from a greenhouse.\n\nNintendo revived the ''Donkey Kong'' franchise in the 1990s for a series of platform games and spin-offs developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]], beginning with ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' in [[1994 in video gaming|1994]]. In [[2004 in video gaming|2004]], Nintendo released ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong]]'', a sequel to the Game Boy's ''Donkey Kong'', in which Mario must chase Donkey Kong to get back the stolen Mini-Mario toys. In the follow-up ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis]]'', Donkey Kong once again falls in love with Pauline and kidnaps her, and Mario uses the Mini-Mario toys to help him rescue her. ''Donkey Kong Racing'' for the GameCube was in development by Rare, but was canceled when Microsoft purchased the company. In 2004, Nintendo released the first of the ''[[Donkey Konga]]'' games, a rhythm-based game series that uses a special bongo controller. ''[[Donkey Kong Jungle Beat]]'' ([[2005 in video gaming|2005]]) is a unique platform action game that uses the same bongo controller accessory. In [[2007 in video gaming|2007]], ''[[Donkey Kong Barrel Blast]]'' was released for the Nintendo Wii. It was originally developed as a GameCube game and would have used the bongo controller, but it was delayed and released exclusively as a [[Wii]] game with no support for the bongo accessory. The ''Donkey Kong Country'' series was revived by [[Retro Studios]] in 2010 with the release of ''[[Donkey Kong Country Returns]]'', and its sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze]]'', in 2014. \n\n''Donkey Kong'' appears as a game in the Wii U game ''[[NES Remix]]'', which features multiple NES games and sometimes \"remixes\" them by presenting significantly modified versions of the games as challenges. One such challenge features Link from ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' traveling through the first screen to save Pauline.  The difficulty is increased compared to the original ''Donkey Kong'' because Link cannot jump, as in ''Zelda''.\n\n===Licensing===\nBy late June 1982, ''Donkey Kong''{{'}}s success had prompted more than 50 parties in the U.S. and Japan to license the game's characters.<ref name=\"Ultimate History\" />{{rp|215}} Mario and his simian nemesis appeared on cereal boxes, board games, pajamas, and [[manga]]. In 1983, the animation studio [[Ruby-Spears Productions|Ruby-Spears]] produced a ''Donkey Kong'' cartoon (as well as ''Donkey Kong Jr.'') for the ''[[Saturday Supercade]]'' program on CBS. In the show, mystery crime-solving plots in the mode of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' are framed around the premise of Mario and Pauline chasing Donkey Kong (voiced by [[Soupy Sales]]), who has escaped from the circus. The show lasted two seasons.\n\n===In popular culture===\nSince its original release, ''Donkey Kong''{{'s}} success has entrenched the game in [[Culture of the United States|American popular culture]]. In 1982, [[Buckner & Garcia]] and R. Cade and the Video Victims both recorded songs (\"[[Pac-Man Fever (album)|Do the Donkey Kong]]\" and \"Donkey Kong\", respectively) based on the game. Artists like [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince]] and [[Trace Adkins]] referenced the game in songs. Episodes of television series such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'', ''[[Crank Yankers]]'' and ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' have also contained references to the game. Even today, sound effects from the Atari 2600 version often serve as generic video game sounds in films and television series.

Cadets were given a King's commission, after passing out, and were posted to one of the [[Eight Unit Scheme of Indianisation|eight units]] selected for Indianisation. Because of the slow pace of Indianisation, with just 69 officers being commissioned between 1918 and 1932, political pressure was applied, leading to the formation of the [[Indian Military Academy]] in 1932 and greater numbers of officers of Indian origin being commissioned.<ref>{{cite book |title=Thimayya: an amazing life |last=Khanduri |first=Chandra B. |year=2006 |publisher=Knowledge World |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-81-87966-36-4 |page=394 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWXfAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=30 July 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106003728/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWXfAAAAMAAJ |archivedate=6 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn [[World War II]] Indian soldiers fought alongside the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].

As the war progressed, the size and role of the Indian Army expanded dramatically, and troops were sent to battlefronts as soon as possible.

During five days of fighting, the Indian Army, backed by an [[Indian Air Force]] squadron of [[Hawker Tempest]] aircraft, routed the Hyderabad State forces. Five Indian Army infantry battalions and one armoured squadron were engaged in the operation. The following day, Hyderabad was proclaimed as a part of the Union.

Meanwhile, Chinese troops had also made incursions into Indian-held territory, and tensions between the two reached a new high when Indian forces discovered the road constructed by China in Aksai Chin. After a series of failed negotiations, the [[People's Liberation Army]] attacked Indian Army positions on the Thag La ridge. This move by China caught India by surprise; and on 12 October Nehru gave orders for the Chinese to be expelled from Aksai Chin. However, poor co-ordination among various divisions of the Indian Army, and the late decision to mobilise the Indian Air Force in vast numbers, gave China a crucial tactical and strategic advantage over India. On 20 October, Chinese soldiers attacked India from both the northwest and northeast, and captured large portions of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nAs the fighting moved beyond disputed territories, China called on the Indian government to negotiate; however, India remained determined to regain lost territory. With no agreement in sight, China unilaterally withdrew its forces from Arunachal Pradesh. The reasons for the withdrawal are disputed, with India claiming various logistical problems for China and diplomatic support from the United States, while China stated that it still held territory it had staked a claim on. The dividing line between the Indian and Chinese forces was named the [[Line of Actual Control]].\n\nThe poor decisions made by India's military commanders, and the political leadership, raised several questions. The [[Henderson-Brooks Report|Henderson-Brooks and Bhagat committee]] was soon set up by the government of India to determine the causes of the poor performance of the Indian Army. Its report criticised the decision not to allow the Indian Air Force to target Chinese transport lines, out of fear of a Chinese aerial counter-attack on Indian civilian areas. Much of the blame was placed on the then\u2013defence minister, [[Krishna Menon]], who resigned from his post soon after the war ended. Despite frequent calls for its release, the Henderson-Brooks report still remains classified.<ref>Claude Arpi. ''India and her neighbourhood: a French observer's views''.

However, Pakistan began conducting and allowing a series of mountaineering expeditions to the glacier beginning in the 1950s.

Diplomatic tensions eased after the [[Lahore Summit]] was held in 1999. However, the sense of optimism was short-lived since in mid-1999 Pakistani paramilitary forces and Kashmiri insurgents captured the deserted, but strategic, Himalayan heights in the [[Kargil district]] of India. These had been vacated by the Indian army during the onset of the inhospitable winter and were supposed to be reoccupied in spring. The regular Pakistani troops who took control of these areas received important support, both in the form of arms and supplies, from Pakistan.

On 22 April 2016, Army Chief D S Suhag was expected to review the exercise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/Indian-Armys-firing-exercise-Shatrujeet-enters-its-last-phase/articleshow/51861638.cms|title=Indian Army's firing exercise 'Shatrujeet' enters its last phase \u2013 Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=18 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418064432/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/Indian-Armys-firing-exercise-Shatrujeet-enters-its-last-phase/articleshow/51861638.cms|archivedate=18 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-army-conducts-battle-exercise-shatrujeet-in-rajasthan-1396215|title=Indian Army Conducts Battle Exercise 'Shatrujeet' In Rajasthan|website=NDTV.com|access-date=18 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417140922/http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-army-conducts-battle-exercise-shatrujeet-in-rajasthan-1396215|archivedate=17 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsghana.com.gh/indian-army-test-its-operation-abilities/|title=Indian Army Test Its Operation Abilities|last=Admin|website=News Ghana|access-date=18 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422040921/http://www.newsghana.com.gh/indian-army-test-its-operation-abilities/|archivedate=22 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Mission and doctrine==\n\nInitially, the army's main objective was to defend the nation's frontiers. However, over the years, the army has also taken up the responsibility of providing internal security, especially against insurgencies in [[Kashmir]] and the [[Northeast India|Northeast]].\nThe current combat doctrine of the Indian Army is based on effectively utilising holding formations and strike formations. In the case of an attack, the holding formations would contain the enemy and strike formations would counter-attack to neutralise enemy forces. In the case of an Indian attack, the holding formations would pin enemy forces down, whilst the strike formations attack at a point of Indian choosing. The Indian Army is large enough to devote several corps to the strike role. Currently, the army is also looking at enhancing its [[special forces]] capabilities. With the role of India increasing, and the requirement for protection of India's interests in far-off countries become important, the Indian Army and Indian Navy are jointly planning to set up a marine brigade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/100770/India/army-and-navy-plan-to-set-up-a-marine-brigade.html |title=Army and navy plan to set up a marine brigade |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date=9 June 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019211335/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/100770/India/army-and-navy-plan-to-set-up-a-marine-brigade.html |archivedate=19 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{update inline|date=June 2017}}\n\n==Organisation==\n{{Main|List of serving generals of the Indian Army}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ Principal Staff Officers at Headquarters, Indian Army \n!Post\n!Current Holder\n|- \n|[[Chief of the Army Staff (India)|Chief of the Army Staff]] \n|General [[Manoj Mukund Naravane]], PVSM, AVSM, SM, VSM, ADC\n|- \n|[[Vice Chief of Army Staff (India)|Vice Chief of Army Staff]]\n|Lieutenant General [[Satinder Kumar Saini]] AVSM,YSM,VSM\n|- \n|Deputy Chief of Army Staff  (Information Systems & Training)\n|\n|- \n|Deputy Chief of Army Staff  (Planning & Systems) \n|Lieutenant General Sudharshan Shrikant Hasabnis<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/make-in-india-not-just-confined-to-india-anymore-benefitting-others-jitendra-singh/1378556|title='Make in India' not just confined to India anymore, benefitting others: Jitendra Singh|work=Outlook|access-date=2018-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910094634/https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/make-in-india-not-just-confined-to-india-anymore-benefitting-others-jitendra-singh/1378556|archive-date=10 September 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Adjutant-General (India)|Adjutant General]] \n|Lieutenant General Ashwani Kumar, AVSM<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html==|title=Official Website of Indian Army|website=uniindia.com|accessdate=2017-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707115430/http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html==|archive-date=7 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html|title=Lt General Ashwani Kumar assumes charge as Adjutant General|access-date=12 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202223736/http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html|archive-date=2 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Military Secretary (India)|Military Secretary]] \n|Lieutenant General [[Jaswinder Singh Sandhu (general)|Jaswinder Singh Sandhu]], UYSM, AVSM, VSM<ref name=\"Kashmir News Zone\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.kashmirnewszone.com/lt-gen-k-bhatt-take-15-corps-goc/|title=Lt Gen A K Bhatt to take over as 15 Corps GOC - Kashmir News Zone|date=2017-12-15|work=Kashmir News Zone|access-date=2017-12-29|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816105614/http://www.kashmirnewszone.com/lt-gen-k-bhatt-take-15-corps-goc/|archive-date=16 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Master-General of the Ordnance|Master General of Ordnance]] \n|Lieutenant General S K Upadhya<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projectyourstate.com/index.php/Home/display/Lt-Gen-S-K-Upadhyay-designated-as-MGO|title=Lt Gen S K Upadhyay designated as MGO|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Indian Army Corps of Engineers|Engineer-in-Chief]] \n|Lieutenant General [[S.

On 4 June 2017, the chief of staff announced that the Army was planning to open combat positions to women, who would first be appointed to positions in the military police.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n[[File:Honour guard, India 20060302-9 d-0108-2-515h.jpg|thumb|The mounted [[President's Bodyguard]] during a state visit by a foreign dignitary]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Director General\n!Center\n|-\n|[[Indian Army Armoured Corps|Armoured Corps]]\n|\n|The Armoured Corps Centre and School, [[Ahmednagar]]\n|-\n|[[Regiment of Artillery (India)|Regiment of Artillery]]\n|Lieutenant General P K Srivastava, PVSM, AVSM, VSM<ref name=IndianArmyArtilleryDG>{{Cite web |title=The Regiment of Artillery: Director General and Colonel Commandant |url=http://www.indianarmy.nic.in/Site/FormTemplete/frmTempSimple.aspx?MnId=tp6QV4gmHtrUy/2aWwOdPQ==&ParentID=c/kSjJUgAet86QVQqfy9rQ== |website=Official Website of Indian Army |access-date=7 January 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224160759/http://www.indianarmy.nic.in/Site/FormTemplete/frmTempSimple.aspx?MnId=tp6QV4gmHtrUy%2F2aWwOdPQ%3D%3D&ParentID=c%2FkSjJUgAet86QVQqfy9rQ%3D%3D |archivedate=24 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theweek.in/wire-updates/national/2019/01/26/des70-day-army-awards.html|title=List of personnel being conferred gallantry and distinguished awards|website=The Week|language=en|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref>\n|The School of Artillery, [[Devlali]] near [[Nasik]]\n|-\n|[[Corps of Army Air Defence (India)|Corps of Army Air Defence]]&nbsp;\n|Lieutenant General A P Singh,<ref name=IndianArmyAirDefenceDG>{{Cite web |title=Army Air Defence: Director General Army Air Defence |url=http://www.indianarmy.nic.in/Site/FormTemplete/frmTemp2P_SameRow1Flash2C.aspx?MnId=sAfhA9jyS0nVao8srSkuig==&ParentID=MYf/ZqOryVj+hMZZBdL2Yw==&flag=7QuSd9EEv4RiL0wgt7N/BA== |website=Official Website of Indian Army |access-date=7 January 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224215707/http://www.indianarmy.nic.in/Site/FormTemplete/frmTemp2P_SameRow1Flash2C.aspx?MnId=sAfhA9jyS0nVao8srSkuig%3D%3D&ParentID=MYf%2FZqOryVj%2BhMZZBdL2Yw%3D%3D&flag=7QuSd9EEv4RiL0wgt7N%2FBA%3D%3D |archivedate=24 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n|[[Gopalpur, Orissa|Gopalpur]], [[Odisha]].\n|-\n|[[Army Aviation Corps (India)|Army Aviation Corps]]\n|Lieutenant General Kanwal Kumar<ref name=IndianArmyAviationDG>{{Cite web |title=Army Aviation Corps: Director General and Colonel Commandant |url=http://www.indianarmy.nic.in/Site/FormTemplete/frmTempSimple.aspx?MnId=1jNdrzG4uqOdGXvYwmFaHA==&ParentID=jXRQ8bX13B68jZasmqKbng== |website=Official Website of Indian Army |access-date=7 January 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224215513/http://www.indianarmy.nic.in/Site/FormTemplete/frmTempSimple.aspx?MnId=1jNdrzG4uqOdGXvYwmFaHA%3D%3D&ParentID=jXRQ8bX13B68jZasmqKbng%3D%3D |archivedate=24 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n|Combat Army Aviation Training School, [[Nasik]].\n|-\n|[[Indian Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]]\n|Lieutenant General [[S K Shrivastava]], AVSM\n|[[College of Military Engineering, Pune]]<br />[[Madras Engineer Group]], [[Bangalore]]<br />[[Bengal Engineer Group]], [[Roorkee]]<br />[[Bombay Engineer Group]], [[Khadki]] near [[Pune]]\n|-\n|[[Indian Army Corps of Signals|Corps of Signals]]\n|Lieutenant General Rajeev Sabheral, AVSM, VSM<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indianarmy.nic.in/Site/FormTemplete/frmTempSimple.aspx?MnId=h8szue/cWu/d1pegKHWb3A==&ParentID=ZETSh8BjfAVd9DdrFSyVeA==&flag=8CKP966uzg96kLov0aWdfQ==|title=The Corps of Signals SO-in-C|accessdate=2019-09-07}}</ref>\n|[[Military College of Telecommunication Engineering]] (MCTE), [[Mhow]]<br />Two Signal Training Centres at [[Jabalpur]] and [[Goa]].\n|-\n|[[Mechanised Infantry Regiment|Mechanised Infantry]]\n|Lieutenant General R K Jagga\n|[[Ahmednagar]]\n|-\n|Infantry\n|\n|\n|}\n\n'''[[Indian Army Armoured Corps|Armoured Corps]]'''\n[[File:Indian Army Armoured Corps.jpg|thumb|Indian Army Armoured Corps in 2006]]\n\nThere are 65 Armoured Regiments in the Indian Army (including the PBG and 61st Cavalry). These include the following historic regiments dating back to the nineteenth century or earlier: [[1st Duke of York's Own Skinner's Horse|1st (Skinner's) Horse]], the [[2nd Lancers (Gardner's Horse)]], the [[3rd Cavalry (India)|3rd Cavalry]], the [[4th Duke of Cambridge's Own Hodson's Horse|4th (Hodson's) Horse]], the [[7th Light Cavalry]], the [[8th King George's Own Light Cavalry|8th Light Cavalry]], the [[9th Royal Deccan Horse|9th (Deccan) Horse]], the [[14th Prince of Wales's Own Scinde Horse|14th (Scinde) Horse]], the [[The Poona Horse|17th (Poona) Horse]], the [[15th Lancers]], the [[16th Light Cavalry]], the [[18th Cavalry]], the 20th Lancers and the [[The Central India Horse (21st King George V's Own Horse)|21st (Central India) Horse]]. A substantial number of additional units designated as either \"Cavalry\" or \"Armoured\" Regiments have been raised since Independence.\n\n'''[[Mechanised infantry|Mechanised Infantry]]'''\n\nThe Mechanised Infantry is the newest Combat Arm of the Indian Army. Often referred to as \"tomorrow's arm in today's Army\", it is formed of two Regiments; [[Brigade of the Guards#Regimental Battalions|The Brigade of the Guards]] and [[Mechanised Infantry Regiment]] and comprises 48 Mechanised Infantry Battalions in all. The brain-child of raising of this arm was that of [[Krishnaswamy Sundarji|Gen Krishnaswamy Sundarji, PVSM]] (28 April 1930 \u2013 8 February 1999), who was the Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army from 1986 to 1988. During the late 70s, as part of Indian Army modernisation, there was an urgent need to re-calibrate the Indian Mechanised Forces by forming of Mechanised Infantry units to further the shock-action, fire-power, flexibility and mobility of Armoured formations to include ground-holding ability. Thus, the Mechanised Infantry Regiment was born by careful selection of existing Infantry battalions based on operational performance. As the need for more Mechanised battalions grew, the elite Brigade of The Guards were also converted to the Mechanised profile. The two Regiments along with the Armoured Corps form part of the Indian Army's elite \"Mechanised Forces\".\n\n'''Infantry'''\n[[File:Yudh Abhyas 2018 2.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Indian Army soldier during a training exercise]]\n\nUpon its inception, the Indian Army inherited the British Army's organisational structure, which is still maintained today. Therefore, like its predecessor, an Indian infantry regiment's responsibility is not to undertake field operations but to provide battalions and well trained personnel to the field formations. As such it is common to find battalions of the same regiment spread across several brigades, divisions, corps, commands, and even theatres. Like its British and Commonwealth counterparts, troops enlisted within the regiment are immensely loyal, take great pride in the regiment to which they are assigned, and generally spend their entire career within the regiment.\n\nMost Indian Army infantry regiments recruit based on certain selection criteria, such as on the basis of region (for example, the [[Assam Regiment]]), caste/community ([[Jat Regiment]]), or religion ([[Sikh Regiment]]). Most regiments continue the heritage of regiments raised under the British Raj, but some have been raised after independence. Some regiments raised after independence have specialised in border defence, in particular the [[Ladakh Scouts]], the [[Arunachal Scouts]] and the [[Sikkim Scouts]].\n\n[[File:Indian Army Gurkha rifles.jpg|alt=|thumb|Indian Army Gorkha Rifles troopers, during a combat simulation in Fort Irwin, California.]]\n[[File:Indian Army-Rajput regiment.jpeg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Rajput Regiment]] during a [[Delhi Republic Day parade|Republic Day Parade]]]]\n[[File:Indian Army-Sikh Light Infantry regiment.jpeg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Sikh Light Infantry]] during a Republic Day Parade]]\n[[File:Indian Army-Madras regiment.jpeg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Madras Regiment]] during a Republic Day Parade]]\n\nOver the years there have been fears that troops' allegiance lay more with their regiments and the regions/castes/communities/religions from which they were recruited, as opposed to the union of India as a whole. Thus some \"all India\" or \"all class\" regiments have been created that recruit troops from all over India regardless of region, caste/community or religion, such as the [[Brigade of the Guards]] (which later converted to the Mechanised Infantry profile) and the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Infantry regiments in the Indian Army<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Units/Infantry.html?layout=default |title=Infantry Regiments |publisher=Bharat Rakshak |year=2008 |accessdate=24 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007164813/http://bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Units/Infantry.html?layout=default |archivedate=7 October 2013 }}</ref>\n!Regiment\n!Regimental Center\n!Raised\n|-\n|[[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]]\n|[[Bangalore]], [[Karnataka]]\n|1945\n|-\n|[[Punjab Regiment (India)|Punjab Regiment]]\n|[[Ramgarh Cantonment]], [[Jharkhand]]\n|1761\n|-\n|[[Madras Regiment]]\n|[[Wellington Cantonment]], [[Tamil Nadu]]\n|1758\n|-\n|[[The Grenadiers]]\n|[[Jabalpur]], [[Madhya Pradesh]]\n|1778\n|-\n|[[Maratha Light Infantry]]\n|[[Belgaum]], Karnataka\n|1768\n|-\n|[[Rajputana Rifles]]\n|[[Delhi Cantonment]], [[New Delhi]]\n|1775\n|-\n|[[Rajput Regiment]]\n|[[Fatehgarh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]\n|1778\n|-\n|[[Jat Regiment]]\n|[[Bareilly]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1795\n|-\n|[[Sikh Regiment]]\n|Ramgarh Cantonment, Jharkhand\n|1846\n|-\n|[[Sikh Light Infantry]]\n|[[Fatehgarh]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1857\n|-\n|[[Dogra Regiment]]\n|[[Faizabad]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1877\n|-\n|[[Garhwal Rifles]]\n|[[Lansdowne, India|Lansdowne]], [[Uttarakhand]]\n|1887\n|-\n|[[Kumaon Regiment]]\n|[[Ranikhet]], Uttarakhand\n|1813\n|-\n|[[Assam Regiment]]\n|[[Shillong]], [[Meghalaya]]\n|1941\n|-\n|[[Bihar Regiment]]\n|[[Danapur Cantonment]], [[Bihar]]\n|1941\n|-\n|[[Mahar Regiment]]\n|[[Sagar, Madhya Pradesh|Sagar]], Madhya Pradesh\n|1941\n|-\n|[[Jammu & Kashmir Rifles]]\n|Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh\n|1821\n|-\n|[[Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry]]\n|[[Avantipur]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]]\n|1947\n|-\n|[[Naga Regiment]]\n|Ranikhet, Uttarakhand\n|1970\n|-\n|[[1 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|[[Sabathu]], [[Himachal Pradesh]]\n|1815\n|-\n|[[3 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|[[Varanasi]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1815\n|-\n|[[4 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|Sabathu, Himachal Pradesh\n|1857\n|-\n|[[5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]]\n|Shillong, Meghalaya\n|1858\n|-\n|[[8 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|Shillong, Meghalaya\n|1824\n|-\n|[[9 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh\n|1817\n|-\n|[[11 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|[[Lucknow]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1918\n|-\n|[[Ladakh Scouts]]\n|[[Leh]], Jammu and Kashmir\n|1963\n|-\n|[[Rashtriya Rifles]]\n|\n|1990\n|-\n|[[Arunachal Scouts]]\n|Shillong, Meghalaya\n|2010\n|-\n|[[Sikkim Scouts]]\n|\n|2013\n|}\n\n'''Artillery'''\n[[File:The DRDO's Pinaka Launcher system gliding down the Rajpath during the Republic Day Parade - 2006, in New Delhi on January 26, 2006.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Pinaka Multi Barrel Rocket Launcher]]s were used during the [[Kargil War]].]]\n\nThe [[Regiment of Artillery]] is the second largest arm of the Indian Army, constituting nearly one sixth of the Army's total strength.

The 1990s saw the formation of the Corps of Army Air Defence and the coalescing of all aviation assets into the Army Aviation Corps. The arm is now focused on field artillery, and supplies regiments and batteries to each of the operational commands.

The MI (as it is commonly referred to) was constituted in 1941 and was initially created to check corruption in the Army's own ranks. With time, its role has evolved into cross border intelligence, intelligence sharing with friendly nations, infiltrating insurgent groups and counter-terrorism. In the late 1970s, the MI was embroiled in the [[Samba spy scandal]] wherein three Indian Army officers were falsely implicated as Pakistani spies. The organisation has since emerged from the scandal as a prime Intelligence organisation of the Indian Army. {{as of|2012}}, the MI has seen many of its roles taken away by the newly created [[National Technical Research Organisation]] and the [[Defence Intelligence Agency (India)|Defence Intelligence Agency]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bangladesh-indian-army-military-intelligence-directorate-sheikh-hasina/1/170880.html |title=How Indian Army's Military Intelligence Directorate works : Special Report&nbsp;\u2013 India Today |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date=28 January 2012 |accessdate=4 November 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031141954/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bangladesh-indian-army-military-intelligence-directorate-sheikh-hasina/1/170880.html |archivedate=31 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since it was set up in 2004 as a premier apex scientific agency under the National Security Adviser in the Prime Minister's Office,  it also includes the National Institute of Cryptology Research and Development (NICRD), which is the first of its kind in Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/state-govt-allots-land-for-ntro-in-borda-village/424811-3-236.html|title=State govt allots land for NTRO in Borda village|work=IBNLive|accessdate=4 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017235147/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/state-govt-allots-land-for-ntro-in-borda-village/424811-3-236.html|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Field formations===\nBelow are the basic field formations of the Indian Army:\n\n*[[Command (military formation)|Command]]: Indian Army has six operational commands and one training command.

Shirts are buttoned up with two chest pockets with buttoned up flaps. Trousers have two pockets, two thigh box pockets and a back pocket. The Indian Army Jungle [[camouflage]] dress features a jungle camouflage pattern and is designed for use in woodland environments. The Indian Army Desert camouflage, which features a desert camouflage pattern, is used by artillery and infantry posted in dusty, semi-desert and desert areas of [[Rajasthan]] and its vicinity.\n\nThe forces of the [[East India Company]] in India were forced by casualties to dye their white summer [[tunic]]s to neutral tones, initially a tan called [[khaki]] (from the [[Hindi]] word for \"dusty\"). This was a temporary measure which became standard in the Indian service in the 1880s. Only during the [[Second Boer War]] in 1902, did the entire [[British Army]] standardise on [[dun]] for [[Service Dress (British Army)|Service Dress]]. The Indian Army uniform standardises on dun for khaki.\nThe modern Indian Army wears distinctive parade uniforms characterised by variegated turbans and waist-sashes in regimental colours. The Gurkha and Garwhal Rifles and the Assam, Kumaon and Naga Regiments wear broad brimmed hats of traditional style. Traditionally, all rifle regiments (the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles, the Garhwal Rifles, all Gorkha Rifles, and the Rajputana Rifles) as well as the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry wear [[rank badge]]s, buttons and blackened wire embroidered articles of uniform in black instead of the usual brass (or gold) colour as the original role of the rifle regiments was camouflage and concealment.\n\n===Medals and awards===\n{{Main|Awards and decorations of the Indian Armed Forces}}\n\nThe medals awarded by the President of India for gallantry displayed at the battlefield, in order of precedence, are- [[Param Vir Chakra]], [[Maha Vir Chakra]] and [[Vir Chakra]].\n\nThe medals awarded by the President for gallantry displayed away from the battlefield, in order of precedence, are- [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|Ashoka Chakra]], [[Kirti Chakra]] and [[Shaurya Chakra]].\n\nMany of the recipients of these awards have been Indian Army personnel.\n\n===Women===\n[[File:Dr Seema Rao Woman Commando Trainer at Corps Battle School Northern Command Indian Army.png|alt=|thumb|A female civilian Contractor<ref>https://www.forbesindia.com/article/2019-wpower-trailblazers/dr-seema-rao-indias-first-female-combat-trainer-fighting-stereotypes/52713/1</ref> briefing Indian Army soldiers on firing techniques.]]\n\nThe role of [[Women in Indian Armed Forces#Indian Army|women in the Indian army]] began when the \"Indian Military Nursing Service\" was formed in 1888, and nurses fought in World War I and II where 350 Indian Army nurses either died or were taken prisoner of war or declared missing in action, this includes nurses who died when SS Kuala was sunk by the Japanese Bombers in 1942.<ref>[http://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indian-army-must-stop-its-discrimination-against-military-nurses/story-VmhPT6cKj3GW3M3KjCterK.html Indian Army must stop its discrimination against military nurses] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214073109/http://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indian-army-must-stop-its-discrimination-against-military-nurses/story-VmhPT6cKj3GW3M3KjCterK.html |date=14 December 2017 }}, [[Hindustan Times]], 13 December 2017.</ref> In 1992, the Indian Army began inducting women officers in non-medical roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joinindianarmy.nic.in/bravo/entry-schemes-women.htm|title=Entry Schemes Women : Officers Selection - Join Indian Army|website=joinindianarmy.nic.in|access-date=21 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225175117/http://joinindianarmy.nic.in/Bravo/entry-schemes-women.htm|archive-date=25 February 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 19 January 2007, the United Nations first all female peacekeeping force made up of 105 Indian policewomen was deployed to [[Liberia]].<ref>{{cite news|title=First All-Female U.N.

Meanwhile, Chinese troops had also made incursions into Indian-held territory, and tensions between the two reached a new high when Indian forces discovered the road constructed by China in Aksai Chin. After a series of failed negotiations, the [[People's Liberation Army]] attacked Indian Army positions on the Thag La ridge. This move by China caught India by surprise; and on 12 October Nehru gave orders for the Chinese to be expelled from Aksai Chin. However, poor co-ordination among various divisions of the Indian Army, and the late decision to mobilise the Indian Air Force in vast numbers, gave China a crucial tactical and strategic advantage over India. On 20 October, Chinese soldiers attacked India from both the northwest and northeast, and captured large portions of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nAs the fighting moved beyond disputed territories, China called on the Indian government to negotiate; however, India remained determined to regain lost territory. With no agreement in sight, China unilaterally withdrew its forces from Arunachal Pradesh. The reasons for the withdrawal are disputed, with India claiming various logistical problems for China and diplomatic support from the United States, while China stated that it still held territory it had staked a claim on. The dividing line between the Indian and Chinese forces was named the [[Line of Actual Control]].\n\nThe poor decisions made by India's military commanders, and the political leadership, raised several questions. The [[Henderson-Brooks Report|Henderson-Brooks and Bhagat committee]] was soon set up by the government of India to determine the causes of the poor performance of the Indian Army. Its report criticised the decision not to allow the Indian Air Force to target Chinese transport lines, out of fear of a Chinese aerial counter-attack on Indian civilian areas. Much of the blame was placed on the then\u2013defence minister, [[Krishna Menon]], who resigned from his post soon after the war ended. Despite frequent calls for its release, the Henderson-Brooks report still remains classified.<ref>Claude Arpi. ''India and her neighbourhood: a French observer's views''.

Pakistani leaders believed that India, which was still recovering from the Sino-Indian War, would be unable to deal with a military thrust and a Kashmiri rebellion. India reacted swiftly and launched a counter-offensive against Pakistan. In reply, on 1 September Pakistan launched [[Operation Grand Slam]], invading India's Chamb-Jaurian sector. In retaliation, the Indian Army launched a major offensive all along its border with Pakistan, with Lahore as its prime target.\n\n[[File:1965 Indo-Pak War DestroyedShermanTank.jpg|alt=|thumb|Indian Army officer next to a destroyed Pakistani Sherman tank, after the battle of ''Asal Uttar.'']]\n\nInitially, the Indian Army met with considerable success in the northern sector. After launching prolonged artillery barrages against Pakistan, India was able to capture three important mountain positions in Kashmir. By 9 September, the Indian Army had made considerable inroads into Pakistan.

Diplomatic tensions eased after the [[Lahore Summit]] was held in 1999. However, the sense of optimism was short-lived since in mid-1999 Pakistani paramilitary forces and Kashmiri insurgents captured the deserted, but strategic, Himalayan heights in the [[Kargil district]] of India. These had been vacated by the Indian army during the onset of the inhospitable winter and were supposed to be reoccupied in spring. The regular Pakistani troops who took control of these areas received important support, both in the form of arms and supplies, from Pakistan. Some of the heights under their control, which also included the Tiger Hill, overlooked the vital [[Srinagar]]-[[Leh]] Highway ([[National Highway 1 (India)|NH 1A]]), [[Batalik]] and [[Dras]].\n[[File:KWM.jpg|thumb|Kargil War Memorial looking at National Highway 1 from the foot of Tololing]]\n\nOnce the scale of the Pakistani incursion was realised, the Indian Army quickly mobilised about 200,000 troops and [[Operation Vijay (1999)|Operation Vijay]] was launched. However, since the heights were under Pakistani control, India was at a clear strategic disadvantage. From their [[observation post]]s, the Pakistani forces had a clear line-of-sight to lay down [[indirect fire|indirect artillery fire]] on NH 1A, inflicting heavy casualties on the Indians.<ref name=\"NLI\">[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_5-5-2003_pg7_14 Indian general praises Pakistani valour at Kargil] 5 May 2003 Daily Times, Pakistan {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116123416/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_5-5-2003_pg7_14 |date=16 January 2009 }}</ref> This was a serious problem for the Indian Army as the highway was its main logistical and supply route.<ref>Kashmir in the Shadow of War By Robert Wirsing Published by M.E.

Once the NH 1A area was cleared, the Indian Army turned to driving the invading force back across the Line of Control. The [[Battle of Tololing]], among other assaults, slowly tilted the combat in India's favour. Nevertheless, some posts put up a stiff resistance, including Tiger Hill (Point 5140) that fell only later in the war. As the operation was fully under way, about 250 artillery guns were brought in to clear the infiltrators in the posts that were in the [[Sightline|line-of-sight]]. At many vital points, neither artillery nor air power could dislodge the outposts manned by the Pakistan soldiers, who were out of visible range. The Indian Army mounted some direct frontal ground assaults which were slow and took a heavy toll given the steep ascent that had to be made on peaks as high as {{convert|18000|ft|m}}.

Exercise Shakti is conducted to practice and validate anti-terrorist operations and drills in snowbound and mountainous areas. The second joint military exercise between the two countries was held in September 2013 with the first one being held in India in October 2011. The theme of the exercise is to conduct platoon level joint counter insurgency operations in high altitude mountainous terrain under the UN Charter, thus emphasising the shared concerns of both countries about global terrorism. An added aim of the exercise is to qualitatively enhance knowledge of each other's military procedures thus increasing the scope for interoperability and better responsiveness to a common threat. The twelve-day exercise with the French Army is scheduled to be conducted in multiple modules in order to achieve complete integration between the two contingents at every stage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/indo-french-joint-army-exercise-shakti-2013-begins-today_875147.html |title=Indo-French joint Army exercise Shakti 2013 begins today |publisher=Zeenews.india.com |date= |accessdate=11 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706090958/http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/indo-french-joint-army-exercise-shakti-2013-begins-today_875147.html |archivedate=6 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.161880577341913.1073741956.123788044484500&type=1 |title=Indo-French Joint Army Exercise \"Shakti 2016\" |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=11 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018110057/https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.161880577341913.1073741956.123788044484500&type=1 |archivedate=18 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n'''Exercise Shoorveer'''\n\nOn first week of April 2012 the Indian Army launched a massive summer exercise in the Rajasthan desert involving over 50,000 troops and several hundred artillery guns and infantry combat vehicles as part of its efforts to shore up its battle worthiness on the western front with Pakistan. The exercise, code-named \"Shoorveer\", was being conducted by the Jaipur-based South Western Command and ended in the first week of May. This was the largest ever exercise conducted by Indian army since 1947. The collective training started with honing of basic battle procedures and tactical drills at a tactical level.\n\nA number of field firings were carried out to check the accuracy and lethality of the weapon systems. Many innovations and modifications carried out by units and formations to enhance combat power were tested in the field. The troops built on the training momentum gradually, with increased combat tempo to set the stage for a major joint army-air force exercise in the later part of the exercise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.facenfacts.com/NewsDetails/24655/indian-army-gears-up-for-war-game-in-rajasthan-desert.htm |title=Indian Army gears up for war game in Rajasthan desert |publisher=FacenFacts |date=25 April 2012 |accessdate=1 June 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605123334/http://www.facenfacts.com/NewsDetails/24655/indian-army-gears-up-for-war-game-in-rajasthan-desert.htm |archivedate=5 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n'''Exercise Rudra Akrosh'''\n\nIn May 2012 the Indian army started testing the preparedness level of its units and to validate new age technology, battle concepts, organizational structures and networked operations. The Western Army Command conducted its summer training exercises in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. Code named Exercise Rudra Akrosh, the war games were aimed at validating the operational and transformational effectiveness of various formations under the Western Army Command. The exercise which entered its culmination phase was also witnessed by Western Army Commander Lt General S R Ghosh. It included various summer training manoeuvres where approximately 20,000 troops tested battle skills with state-of-the-art weapons systems in complete integration with the fighter and transport aircraft provided by the Indian Air Force. Besides interacting with the soldiers and officers co-ordinating the war games, Lt Gen Ghosh witnessed various battle manoeuvres by infantry troops, mechanised infantry, tanks, artillery, Heli-borne troops and surveillance equipment. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and attack helicopters were also co-opted in the operational scenario. Recently, the Jaipur-based South Western Command&mdash;also known as Sapta Shakti command&mdash;conducted its summer war games with more than 50,000 troops, latest weaponry and air assets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/generalnewsfeed/news/western-army-command-conducts-summer-training-exercises/997533.html |title=Western Army Command conducts summer training exercises, IBN Live News |publisher=Ibnlive.in.com |accessdate=1 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928032748/http://ibnlive.in.com/generalnewsfeed/news/western-army-command-conducts-summer-training-exercises/997533.html |archivedate=28 September 2015 }}{{dead link|date=April 2016|reason=failed bot fix, 28 February}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/western-army-command-conducts-summer-training-exercises-112051100459_1.html |title=Western Army Command conducts summer training exercises |date=2012-05-11 |work=Business Standard India |access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref>\n\n'''Exercise Nomadic Elephant'''\n\nThe Indian Army has been conducting training exercises with the [[Mongolian Army]].

However, over the years, the army has also taken up the responsibility of providing internal security, especially against insurgencies in [[Kashmir]] and the [[Northeast India|Northeast]].\nThe current combat doctrine of the Indian Army is based on effectively utilising holding formations and strike formations. In the case of an attack, the holding formations would contain the enemy and strike formations would counter-attack to neutralise enemy forces. In the case of an Indian attack, the holding formations would pin enemy forces down, whilst the strike formations attack at a point of Indian choosing. The Indian Army is large enough to devote several corps to the strike role. Currently, the army is also looking at enhancing its [[special forces]] capabilities. With the role of India increasing, and the requirement for protection of India's interests in far-off countries become important, the Indian Army and Indian Navy are jointly planning to set up a marine brigade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/100770/India/army-and-navy-plan-to-set-up-a-marine-brigade.html |title=Army and navy plan to set up a marine brigade |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date=9 June 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019211335/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/100770/India/army-and-navy-plan-to-set-up-a-marine-brigade.html |archivedate=19 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{update inline|date=June 2017}}\n\n==Organisation==\n{{Main|List of serving generals of the Indian Army}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ Principal Staff Officers at Headquarters, Indian Army \n!Post\n!Current Holder\n|- \n|[[Chief of the Army Staff (India)|Chief of the Army Staff]] \n|General [[Manoj Mukund Naravane]], PVSM, AVSM, SM, VSM, ADC\n|- \n|[[Vice Chief of Army Staff (India)|Vice Chief of Army Staff]]\n|Lieutenant General [[Satinder Kumar Saini]] AVSM,YSM,VSM\n|- \n|Deputy Chief of Army Staff  (Information Systems & Training)\n|\n|- \n|Deputy Chief of Army Staff  (Planning & Systems) \n|Lieutenant General Sudharshan Shrikant Hasabnis<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/make-in-india-not-just-confined-to-india-anymore-benefitting-others-jitendra-singh/1378556|title='Make in India' not just confined to India anymore, benefitting others: Jitendra Singh|work=Outlook|access-date=2018-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910094634/https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/make-in-india-not-just-confined-to-india-anymore-benefitting-others-jitendra-singh/1378556|archive-date=10 September 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Adjutant-General (India)|Adjutant General]] \n|Lieutenant General Ashwani Kumar, AVSM<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html==|title=Official Website of Indian Army|website=uniindia.com|accessdate=2017-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707115430/http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html==|archive-date=7 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html|title=Lt General Ashwani Kumar assumes charge as Adjutant General|access-date=12 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202223736/http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html|archive-date=2 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Military Secretary (India)|Military Secretary]] \n|Lieutenant General [[Jaswinder Singh Sandhu (general)|Jaswinder Singh Sandhu]], UYSM, AVSM, VSM<ref name=\"Kashmir News Zone\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.kashmirnewszone.com/lt-gen-k-bhatt-take-15-corps-goc/|title=Lt Gen A K Bhatt to take over as 15 Corps GOC - Kashmir News Zone|date=2017-12-15|work=Kashmir News Zone|access-date=2017-12-29|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816105614/http://www.kashmirnewszone.com/lt-gen-k-bhatt-take-15-corps-goc/|archive-date=16 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Master-General of the Ordnance|Master General of Ordnance]] \n|Lieutenant General S K Upadhya<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projectyourstate.com/index.php/Home/display/Lt-Gen-S-K-Upadhyay-designated-as-MGO|title=Lt Gen S K Upadhyay designated as MGO|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Indian Army Corps of Engineers|Engineer-in-Chief]] \n|Lieutenant General [[S.

These include the following historic regiments dating back to the nineteenth century or earlier: [[1st Duke of York's Own Skinner's Horse|1st (Skinner's) Horse]], the [[2nd Lancers (Gardner's Horse)]], the [[3rd Cavalry (India)|3rd Cavalry]], the [[4th Duke of Cambridge's Own Hodson's Horse|4th (Hodson's) Horse]], the [[7th Light Cavalry]], the [[8th King George's Own Light Cavalry|8th Light Cavalry]], the [[9th Royal Deccan Horse|9th (Deccan) Horse]], the [[14th Prince of Wales's Own Scinde Horse|14th (Scinde) Horse]], the [[The Poona Horse|17th (Poona) Horse]], the [[15th Lancers]], the [[16th Light Cavalry]], the [[18th Cavalry]], the 20th Lancers and the [[The Central India Horse (21st King George V's Own Horse)|21st (Central India) Horse]]. A substantial number of additional units designated as either \"Cavalry\" or \"Armoured\" Regiments have been raised since Independence.\n\n'''[[Mechanised infantry|Mechanised Infantry]]'''\n\nThe Mechanised Infantry is the newest Combat Arm of the Indian Army. Often referred to as \"tomorrow's arm in today's Army\", it is formed of two Regiments; [[Brigade of the Guards#Regimental Battalions|The Brigade of the Guards]] and [[Mechanised Infantry Regiment]] and comprises 48 Mechanised Infantry Battalions in all. The brain-child of raising of this arm was that of [[Krishnaswamy Sundarji|Gen Krishnaswamy Sundarji, PVSM]] (28 April 1930 \u2013 8 February 1999), who was the Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army from 1986 to 1988. During the late 70s, as part of Indian Army modernisation, there was an urgent need to re-calibrate the Indian Mechanised Forces by forming of Mechanised Infantry units to further the shock-action, fire-power, flexibility and mobility of Armoured formations to include ground-holding ability. Thus, the Mechanised Infantry Regiment was born by careful selection of existing Infantry battalions based on operational performance. As the need for more Mechanised battalions grew, the elite Brigade of The Guards were also converted to the Mechanised profile. The two Regiments along with the Armoured Corps form part of the Indian Army's elite \"Mechanised Forces\".\n\n'''Infantry'''\n[[File:Yudh Abhyas 2018 2.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Indian Army soldier during a training exercise]]\n\nUpon its inception, the Indian Army inherited the British Army's organisational structure, which is still maintained today. Therefore, like its predecessor, an Indian infantry regiment's responsibility is not to undertake field operations but to provide battalions and well trained personnel to the field formations. As such it is common to find battalions of the same regiment spread across several brigades, divisions, corps, commands, and even theatres. Like its British and Commonwealth counterparts, troops enlisted within the regiment are immensely loyal, take great pride in the regiment to which they are assigned, and generally spend their entire career within the regiment.\n\nMost Indian Army infantry regiments recruit based on certain selection criteria, such as on the basis of region (for example, the [[Assam Regiment]]), caste/community ([[Jat Regiment]]), or religion ([[Sikh Regiment]]). Most regiments continue the heritage of regiments raised under the British Raj, but some have been raised after independence. Some regiments raised after independence have specialised in border defence, in particular the [[Ladakh Scouts]], the [[Arunachal Scouts]] and the [[Sikkim Scouts]].\n\n[[File:Indian Army Gurkha rifles.jpg|alt=|thumb|Indian Army Gorkha Rifles troopers, during a combat simulation in Fort Irwin, California.]]\n[[File:Indian Army-Rajput regiment.jpeg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Rajput Regiment]] during a [[Delhi Republic Day parade|Republic Day Parade]]]]\n[[File:Indian Army-Sikh Light Infantry regiment.jpeg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Sikh Light Infantry]] during a Republic Day Parade]]\n[[File:Indian Army-Madras regiment.jpeg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Madras Regiment]] during a Republic Day Parade]]\n\nOver the years there have been fears that troops' allegiance lay more with their regiments and the regions/castes/communities/religions from which they were recruited, as opposed to the union of India as a whole. Thus some \"all India\" or \"all class\" regiments have been created that recruit troops from all over India regardless of region, caste/community or religion, such as the [[Brigade of the Guards]] (which later converted to the Mechanised Infantry profile) and the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Infantry regiments in the Indian Army<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Units/Infantry.html?layout=default |title=Infantry Regiments |publisher=Bharat Rakshak |year=2008 |accessdate=24 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007164813/http://bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Units/Infantry.html?layout=default |archivedate=7 October 2013 }}</ref>\n!Regiment\n!Regimental Center\n!Raised\n|-\n|[[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]]\n|[[Bangalore]], [[Karnataka]]\n|1945\n|-\n|[[Punjab Regiment (India)|Punjab Regiment]]\n|[[Ramgarh Cantonment]], [[Jharkhand]]\n|1761\n|-\n|[[Madras Regiment]]\n|[[Wellington Cantonment]], [[Tamil Nadu]]\n|1758\n|-\n|[[The Grenadiers]]\n|[[Jabalpur]], [[Madhya Pradesh]]\n|1778\n|-\n|[[Maratha Light Infantry]]\n|[[Belgaum]], Karnataka\n|1768\n|-\n|[[Rajputana Rifles]]\n|[[Delhi Cantonment]], [[New Delhi]]\n|1775\n|-\n|[[Rajput Regiment]]\n|[[Fatehgarh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]\n|1778\n|-\n|[[Jat Regiment]]\n|[[Bareilly]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1795\n|-\n|[[Sikh Regiment]]\n|Ramgarh Cantonment, Jharkhand\n|1846\n|-\n|[[Sikh Light Infantry]]\n|[[Fatehgarh]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1857\n|-\n|[[Dogra Regiment]]\n|[[Faizabad]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1877\n|-\n|[[Garhwal Rifles]]\n|[[Lansdowne, India|Lansdowne]], [[Uttarakhand]]\n|1887\n|-\n|[[Kumaon Regiment]]\n|[[Ranikhet]], Uttarakhand\n|1813\n|-\n|[[Assam Regiment]]\n|[[Shillong]], [[Meghalaya]]\n|1941\n|-\n|[[Bihar Regiment]]\n|[[Danapur Cantonment]], [[Bihar]]\n|1941\n|-\n|[[Mahar Regiment]]\n|[[Sagar, Madhya Pradesh|Sagar]], Madhya Pradesh\n|1941\n|-\n|[[Jammu & Kashmir Rifles]]\n|Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh\n|1821\n|-\n|[[Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry]]\n|[[Avantipur]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]]\n|1947\n|-\n|[[Naga Regiment]]\n|Ranikhet, Uttarakhand\n|1970\n|-\n|[[1 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|[[Sabathu]], [[Himachal Pradesh]]\n|1815\n|-\n|[[3 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|[[Varanasi]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1815\n|-\n|[[4 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|Sabathu, Himachal Pradesh\n|1857\n|-\n|[[5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]]\n|Shillong, Meghalaya\n|1858\n|-\n|[[8 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|Shillong, Meghalaya\n|1824\n|-\n|[[9 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh\n|1817\n|-\n|[[11 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|[[Lucknow]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1918\n|-\n|[[Ladakh Scouts]]\n|[[Leh]], Jammu and Kashmir\n|1963\n|-\n|[[Rashtriya Rifles]]\n|\n|1990\n|-\n|[[Arunachal Scouts]]\n|Shillong, Meghalaya\n|2010\n|-\n|[[Sikkim Scouts]]\n|\n|2013\n|}\n\n'''Artillery'''\n[[File:The DRDO's Pinaka Launcher system gliding down the Rajpath during the Republic Day Parade - 2006, in New Delhi on January 26, 2006.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Pinaka Multi Barrel Rocket Launcher]]s were used during the [[Kargil War]].]]\n\nThe [[Regiment of Artillery]] is the second largest arm of the Indian Army, constituting nearly one sixth of the Army's total strength.

In the late 1970s, the MI was embroiled in the [[Samba spy scandal]] wherein three Indian Army officers were falsely implicated as Pakistani spies.

The Indian Army Desert camouflage, which features a desert camouflage pattern, is used by artillery and infantry posted in dusty, semi-desert and desert areas of [[Rajasthan]] and its vicinity.\n\nThe forces of the [[East India Company]] in India were forced by casualties to dye their white summer [[tunic]]s to neutral tones, initially a tan called [[khaki]] (from the [[Hindi]] word for \"dusty\").

Only during the [[Second Boer War]] in 1902, did the entire [[British Army]] standardise on [[dun]] for [[Service Dress (British Army)|Service Dress]].

Tillman lobbied the [[South Carolina General Assembly]] to create the school as an agricultural institution for the state and the resolution passed by only one vote.\n\nIn his will, Clemson explicitly stated he wanted the school to be modeled after what is now [[Mississippi State University]]: \"This institution, I desire, to be under the control and management of a board of trustees, a part of whom are hereinafter appointed, and to be modeled after the Agricultural College of Mississippi as far as practicable.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Will of Thomas Green Clemson |url=http://www.clemson.edu/about/history/tgc-will.html}}</ref>\n\n===Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina===\n[[File:CU Godfrey Hall Aug2010.jpg|thumb|left|287px|Godfrey Hall, constructed in 1897, formerly housed the Textile Department.]]\n\nIn November 1889, South Carolina Governor [[John Peter Richardson III]] signed the bill, thus establishing the Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina. As a result, federal funds for agricultural education from the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]] and the [[Hatch Act of 1887]] were transferred from [[University of South Carolina|South Carolina College]] (today, the [[University of South Carolina]]) to Clemson.<ref name=\"History of Clemson\"/> Construction of the college began with Hardin Hall in 1890 and then main classroom buildings in 1891. Henry Aubrey Strode became the first president of Clemson from 1890 to 1893. Edwin Craighead succeeded Strode in 1893. Clemson Agricultural College formally opened in July 1893 with an initial enrollment of 446. The common curriculum of the first incoming students was English, history, botany, mathematics, physics and agriculture. Until 1955, the college was also an all-white male [[Military academy|military school]].\n\n[[File:Cadets on Bowman Field (Oconeean 1904).png|thumb|right|287px|Corps of Cadets at Clemson College in 1904]]\n\nOn May 22, 1894, the main building [[Tillman Hall at Clemson University|(Tillman Hall)]] was destroyed by a fire, which consumed the library, classrooms, and offices. Tillman Hall was rebuilt in 1894 and is still standing today. The first graduating class of Clemson was in 1896 with degrees in mechanical-electrical engineering and agriculture. Clemson's first football team began in 1896 led by trainer [[Walter Riggs]]. Henry Hartzog, graduate of [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina]], became president of Clemson in 1897. Hartzog created a textile department in 1898. Clemson became the first Southern school to train textile specialists. Hartzog expanded the curriculum with more industrialization skills such as foundry work, agriculture studies and mechanics. In 1902 a large student walkout over the use of rigid military discipline escalated tensions between students and faculty forcing Hartzog to resign. Patrick Mell succeeded Hartzog from 1902 to 1910.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Riley|first1=Helene|title=Clemson University|publisher=Arcadia Publishing}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the resignation of Mell in 1910 former Clemson Tigers football coach [[Walter Riggs]] became president of Clemson from 1910 to 1924.<ref>{{cite web|title=Walter M.

Lee of the first graduating class of Clemson in 1896. In 1915 [[Riggs Field]] was dedicated after Walter Riggs and is the [[Clemson Tigers men's soccer]] home field. During [[World War I]] enrollment in Clemson declined. In 1917 Clemson formed a [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] and in 1918 a Student Army Training Corps was formed. Effects of World War I made Clemson hire the first women faculty due to changes in faculty.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lusk|first1=Brock|title=Tigers in the Trenches: A Study of Clemson in the Great War |url=http://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3114&context=all_theses&sei-redir=1&referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bing.com%2Fsearch%3FPC%3DU157%26q%3Dclemson%2Buniversity%2Bduring%2Bworld%2Bwar%2Bii%26first%3D11%26FORM%3DPORE#search=%22clemson%20university%20during%20world%20war%20ii%22|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> Riggs accepted a six-month army educational commission in 1919 overseas in [[France]] leaving Samuel Earle as acting president. On March 10, 1920 a large walkout occurred protesting unfair \"prison camp\" style military discipline. The 1920 walkout led to the creation of a Department of Student Affairs. On January 22, 1924 Riggs died on a business trip to [[Washington, D.C.]] leaving Earle the acting president. In October 1924 another walkout of around 500 students occurred when Earle rejected their demands of better food and the dismissal of mess officer Harcombe and the reinstatement of their senior class president. The 1924 walkout resulted in 23 students dismissed and 112 suspended.\n\n[[File:ClemsonMemlStadium06.jpg|thumb|right|287px|Clemson Memorial Stadium in 2006]]\n\nOn April 1, 1925 a fire destroyed the interior of the agricultural building and with it many research projects and an agricultural museum. The exterior of the building survived, leading to the construction of Sikes Hall to hold the library from Tillman Hall. On May 27, 1926 Mechanical Hall was destroyed in a fire. Present-day Freeman Hall, built in 1926, was the reconstructed shop building. In 1928 Riggs Hall was established in honor of [[Walter Riggs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Department |url=https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ece/about/history.html|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> President Enoch Sikes increased student enrollment by over 1,000 students and expanded the degree programs with an addition of the first graduate degree. The Department of Arts and Sciences was formed in 1926 with the addition of modern languages programs. Programs at Clemson were reorganized into six schools of agriculture, chemistry, engineering, general science, textiles, and vocational studies. In 1927 Clemson received accreditation from the Association of Secondary Schools and Colleges of the Southern States.\n\nDuring [[The Great Depression]] student enrollment and income declined. [[The New Deal]] brought needed construction to the campus under the [[Works Progress Administration]] with new dormitories to relieve the housing shortages. Long Hall, Sirrine Hall, and 29,625 acres of privately owned farmland was acquired by Clemson through federal funding. Agricultural engineers of Clemson diversified with the Clemson Agricultural Extension to educate farmers on soil conservation and crop storage techniques during The Great Depression. Robert Poole became the first Clemson alumnus to be president in 1940. On September 19, 1942 [[Memorial Stadium (Clemson)|Memorial Stadium]] was formally opened as the new stadium for the [[Clemson Tigers football]] team who previously played on [[Riggs Field]] since 1915.<ref>{{cite web|title=Memorial Stadium |url=http://www.collegegridirons.com/acc/MemorialStadium.htm |website=collegegridirons.com |accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]] more than 6,500 students were sent overseas in the military. As a result of the Clemson ROTC, around 5,850 were commissioned officers. The class of 1943 had a historical low of 343 graduates.<ref>{{cite web|title=Military History at Clemson|url=https://www.clemson.edu/business/departments/air-rotc/about/index.html|website=clemson.edu|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> By the end of the war, 376 Clemson students had been killed in it.\n\n===Becoming civilian and coeducational and desegregated===\nIn 1955 Clemson underwent a major restructuring and was transformed into \"civilian\" status for students.

These organizations operate under Tiger Media, the university's student media department, and are each on the third floor of the Hendrix Student Center. These include [[The Tiger (newspaper)|''The Tiger'']], ''The Tiger Town Observer'', Tigervision, ''TAPS Yearbook'', ''The Pendulum'', ''The Chronicle'', ''The Sensible Tiger'', and [[WSBF-FM]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About Tiger Media|url=http://www.cutigervision.com/about|work=Tiger Media}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TheTigerClemson1917.png|thumb|right|400px|Logo from [[The Tiger (newspaper)|''The Tiger'']] Vol. XII No. 25 on May 2, 1917]]\n\nFounded in 1907, [[The Tiger (newspaper)|''The Tiger'']] is the oldest student-run newspaper in South Carolina. ''The Tiger'' publishes local and university related news pieces. Additionally, the paper publishes opinion articles on general and national issues, lifestyle articles on topics such as food, sex, and music. With sports being a major part of Clemson University's culture and events, ''The Tiger'' also contains a large sports section focusing on football, basketball, baseball, and soccer. ''The Tiger'' is published weekly, on Mondays, and maintains a staff of 20 senior members and 75 junior staff members.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.thetigernews.com/about.php|work=The Tiger News|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130204112131/http://www.thetigernews.com/about.php|archivedate=2013-02-04|df=}}</ref>\n\n''The Tiger Town Observer'' is a conservative news magazine that focuses on university politics. The magazine identifies itself as a \"traditionally conservative\" news source and lists its political values as liberty, transparency, lifelong learning, free market and charity.<ref>{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://tigertownobserver.com/?page_id=7|work=Tiger Town Observer|accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nTigervision, Clemson's student-run TV station, broadcasts on channel 88 on the university's campus cable network. The station was created in 1994 under the name Clemson Cable Network by students at [[WSBF-FM]] who were interested in television production. The station aired a variety of student created content as well as recently released movies via a licensing agreement. By 2006, after experiencing a decline in membership and viewers, CCN was no longer consistently producing content and fell into relative obscurity. However, in 2007, CCN was reorganized into Clemson Television and began to produce student comedy shows as well as airing public domain films. As content quality began to increase, so did membership. In 2014, CTV was renamed Tigervision to coincide with its switch to high definition broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Tigervision|url=http://www.cutigervision.com/about|work=Tigervision}}</ref>\n\n''TAPS Yearbook'' was established in 1907 after members of the Clemson College Chronicle, the literary arts magazine at the time, wanted to publish a new book printed annually. It is named after the song \"Taps\", which was played each night when cadets went to bed during the college's time as a military school. Each edition of ''TAPS'' contains student portraits, information on student organizations, and reviews of the past year's events.<ref>{{cite book |title=TAPS Yearbook|date=2011|pages=357}}</ref> In 2017, ''TAPS'' announced the end of the 2017-18 academic year would mark the final edition of the yearbook.

In the beginning, WSBF's content was mostly agriculture education shows and classical music. By the mid-1960s, the station began to air sports programs such as ''The Frank Howard Show'' along with news. The station would eventually shift to a \"progressive\" format where it focused on new, up-and-coming contemporary music groups. During the 1980s, the formet would shift gradually changed to the station's current \"alternative\" format. WSBF plays a variety genres including jazz, rap, punk, rock, and folk focusing on independent artists. The station broadcasts to the Clemson area and upstate South Carolina on 88.1 FM as well as online.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of WSBF|url=https://wsbf.net/#/history|work=WSBF}}</ref>\n\n''The Chronicle'' is a literary art magazine that publishes biannually.

It was established in 2014 and officially joined Tiger Media the following year. It publishes twice a year during the fall and focuses on international politics, economics, and global affairs. ''The Pendulum'' often takes these topics and discusses how they affect students and the Clemson community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemsonpendulum.org|title=The Pendulum|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n''The Sensible Tiger'' is a student-run weekly newsletter established in 2018 which provides students with brief, non-partisan news in an effort ease political divides on campus. The Sensible Tiger has interviewed 2019 Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke and Washington Post contributor Josh Dawsey, and produces a biweekly Spotify podcast entitled \"The Watercooler.\"\n\n==Traditions==\n\n===Tiger Paw===\n\nThe Tiger paw became the official logo for Clemson University in 1970, in place of the previous tiger logo. The change was inspired by President Robert Edwards to \"upgrade the image of the university.\" The Tiger Paw logo was introduced at a press conference on July 21, 1970. It was created by John Antonio and developed by Helen Weaver of Henderson Advertising in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], from a mold of a [[Bengal tiger]] sent to the agency by the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The paw is now used on all athletic teams and collegiate documents. The tiger paw is also painted on surfaces throughout campus and on highways leading to the campus.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Bob|title=Death Valley Days|year=1991|publisher=Longsteet Press|isbn=978-1563520068|pages=36\u201342}}</ref>\n\n===Homecoming and Tigerama===\n\nEvery year Clemson students have the opportunity to attend Homecoming and Tigerama. The Clemson Homecoming tradition began in 1914 and has been held annually at Clemson University ever since. During homecoming week, various student organizations design and build Homecoming floats on Bowman Field. The floats are then revealed on the Saturday of the football game and judged by a select panel. Since 1957, Clemson has held \"Tigerama\" on the Friday night of homecoming week. Tigerama is one of the nation's largest student-run-pep rallies, averaging about 40,000 people. This Clemson event includes the crowning of Miss Homecoming, skits by various academic organizations, as well as a fireworks show.<ref name=\"Blackman 1999 144\"/>\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Traditions|url=http://www.clemson.edu/about/traditions.html|publisher=Clemson University|accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===First Friday Parade===\nThe First Friday Parade has been held on the Friday before the first home football game every year since 1974. The parade includes fraternities, sororities, the Clemson marching band, the university President, as well as many other student organizations.  The parade route travels through portions of Highway 93 and Main Street and concludes at the university's [[amphitheatre]], where the first pep rally of the year is held. In 1985, the parade had its highest attendance, when accompanying CBS commentators were the Grand Marshalls.<ref name=\"Blackman 1999 144\">{{cite book|last=Blackman|first=Sam|title=Clemson:Where the Tigers play|year=1999|publisher=Sports Publishing|isbn=978-1583820056|page=144}}</ref><ref name=\"Traditions\">{{cite web|title=Traditions|url=http://www.clemson.edu/about/traditions.html|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Alma mater===\nThe Clemson University alma mater originated in the 1910s after a group of Clemson ROTC cadets in May 1918 was asked to sing the school's song at a gathering of ROTC cadets in [[Plattsburgh, New York]]; they were unable to do so, as Clemson had no song at the time. One of the cadets in attendance, A.C. Corcoran of [[Charleston, South Carolina]], decided to remedy the situation and wrote the words to the alma mater and set them to [[Annie Lisle]], which was the melody of [[Cornell University]]'s alma mater, as well as many others. The words were later officially accepted by the then-named Clemson Agricultural College as the alma mater and was first performed by the Clemson Glee Club on February 17, 1919.<ref name=\"Alma Mater\">{{cite web|title=The Mystery of the Clemson Alma Mater|url=http://www.clemson.edu/tigerband/History_AlmaMater.htm|publisher=Clemson University|accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1947 the club \"Tiger Brotherhood\" decided that, rather than continue borrowing another school's melody, the university should compose its own. As a result, the Tiger Brotherhood sponsored a contest to have Clemson students compose a unique melody. On May 5, 1947, Clemson University's school newspaper \"The Tiger\" announced Robert E. Farmer of [[Anderson, South Carolina]], a member of the glee club at the time, as the winner. Farmer's melody was slightly altered in 1970, but was restored to its original tune in 2009.<ref name = \"Alma Mater\" />\n\n===Fight song===\nThe university's fight song is the [[jazz standard]], the \"[[Tiger Rag]]\".<ref>\"[http://www.clemson.edu/about/traditions.html Traditions]\".

Tillman lobbied the [[South Carolina General Assembly]] to create the school as an agricultural institution for the state and the resolution passed by only one vote.\n\nIn his will, Clemson explicitly stated he wanted the school to be modeled after what is now [[Mississippi State University]]: \"This institution, I desire, to be under the control and management of a board of trustees, a part of whom are hereinafter appointed, and to be modeled after the Agricultural College of Mississippi as far as practicable.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Will of Thomas Green Clemson |url=http://www.clemson.edu/about/history/tgc-will.html}}</ref>\n\n===Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina===\n[[File:CU Godfrey Hall Aug2010.jpg|thumb|left|287px|Godfrey Hall, constructed in 1897, formerly housed the Textile Department.]]\n\nIn November 1889, South Carolina Governor [[John Peter Richardson III]] signed the bill, thus establishing the Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina. As a result, federal funds for agricultural education from the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]] and the [[Hatch Act of 1887]] were transferred from [[University of South Carolina|South Carolina College]] (today, the [[University of South Carolina]]) to Clemson.<ref name=\"History of Clemson\"/> Construction of the college began with Hardin Hall in 1890 and then main classroom buildings in 1891. Henry Aubrey Strode became the first president of Clemson from 1890 to 1893. Edwin Craighead succeeded Strode in 1893. Clemson Agricultural College formally opened in July 1893 with an initial enrollment of 446. The common curriculum of the first incoming students was English, history, botany, mathematics, physics and agriculture. Until 1955, the college was also an all-white male [[Military academy|military school]].\n\n[[File:Cadets on Bowman Field (Oconeean 1904).png|thumb|right|287px|Corps of Cadets at Clemson College in 1904]]\n\nOn May 22, 1894, the main building [[Tillman Hall at Clemson University|(Tillman Hall)]] was destroyed by a fire, which consumed the library, classrooms, and offices. Tillman Hall was rebuilt in 1894 and is still standing today. The first graduating class of Clemson was in 1896 with degrees in mechanical-electrical engineering and agriculture. Clemson's first football team began in 1896 led by trainer [[Walter Riggs]]. Henry Hartzog, graduate of [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina]], became president of Clemson in 1897. Hartzog created a textile department in 1898. Clemson became the first Southern school to train textile specialists. Hartzog expanded the curriculum with more industrialization skills such as foundry work, agriculture studies and mechanics. In 1902 a large student walkout over the use of rigid military discipline escalated tensions between students and faculty forcing Hartzog to resign. Patrick Mell succeeded Hartzog from 1902 to 1910.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Riley|first1=Helene|title=Clemson University|publisher=Arcadia Publishing}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the resignation of Mell in 1910 former Clemson Tigers football coach [[Walter Riggs]] became president of Clemson from 1910 to 1924.<ref>{{cite web|title=Walter M.

Lee of the first graduating class of Clemson in 1896. In 1915 [[Riggs Field]] was dedicated after Walter Riggs and is the [[Clemson Tigers men's soccer]] home field. During [[World War I]] enrollment in Clemson declined. In 1917 Clemson formed a [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] and in 1918 a Student Army Training Corps was formed. Effects of World War I made Clemson hire the first women faculty due to changes in faculty.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lusk|first1=Brock|title=Tigers in the Trenches: A Study of Clemson in the Great War |url=http://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3114&context=all_theses&sei-redir=1&referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bing.com%2Fsearch%3FPC%3DU157%26q%3Dclemson%2Buniversity%2Bduring%2Bworld%2Bwar%2Bii%26first%3D11%26FORM%3DPORE#search=%22clemson%20university%20during%20world%20war%20ii%22|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> Riggs accepted a six-month army educational commission in 1919 overseas in [[France]] leaving Samuel Earle as acting president. On March 10, 1920 a large walkout occurred protesting unfair \"prison camp\" style military discipline. The 1920 walkout led to the creation of a Department of Student Affairs. On January 22, 1924 Riggs died on a business trip to [[Washington, D.C.]] leaving Earle the acting president. In October 1924 another walkout of around 500 students occurred when Earle rejected their demands of better food and the dismissal of mess officer Harcombe and the reinstatement of their senior class president. The 1924 walkout resulted in 23 students dismissed and 112 suspended.\n\n[[File:ClemsonMemlStadium06.jpg|thumb|right|287px|Clemson Memorial Stadium in 2006]]\n\nOn April 1, 1925 a fire destroyed the interior of the agricultural building and with it many research projects and an agricultural museum. The exterior of the building survived, leading to the construction of Sikes Hall to hold the library from Tillman Hall. On May 27, 1926 Mechanical Hall was destroyed in a fire. Present-day Freeman Hall, built in 1926, was the reconstructed shop building. In 1928 Riggs Hall was established in honor of [[Walter Riggs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Department |url=https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ece/about/history.html|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> President Enoch Sikes increased student enrollment by over 1,000 students and expanded the degree programs with an addition of the first graduate degree. The Department of Arts and Sciences was formed in 1926 with the addition of modern languages programs. Programs at Clemson were reorganized into six schools of agriculture, chemistry, engineering, general science, textiles, and vocational studies. In 1927 Clemson received accreditation from the Association of Secondary Schools and Colleges of the Southern States.\n\nDuring [[The Great Depression]] student enrollment and income declined. [[The New Deal]] brought needed construction to the campus under the [[Works Progress Administration]] with new dormitories to relieve the housing shortages. Long Hall, Sirrine Hall, and 29,625 acres of privately owned farmland was acquired by Clemson through federal funding. Agricultural engineers of Clemson diversified with the Clemson Agricultural Extension to educate farmers on soil conservation and crop storage techniques during The Great Depression. Robert Poole became the first Clemson alumnus to be president in 1940. On September 19, 1942 [[Memorial Stadium (Clemson)|Memorial Stadium]] was formally opened as the new stadium for the [[Clemson Tigers football]] team who previously played on [[Riggs Field]] since 1915.<ref>{{cite web|title=Memorial Stadium |url=http://www.collegegridirons.com/acc/MemorialStadium.htm |website=collegegridirons.com |accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]] more than 6,500 students were sent overseas in the military. As a result of the Clemson ROTC, around 5,850 were commissioned officers. The class of 1943 had a historical low of 343 graduates.<ref>{{cite web|title=Military History at Clemson|url=https://www.clemson.edu/business/departments/air-rotc/about/index.html|website=clemson.edu|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> By the end of the war, 376 Clemson students had been killed in it.\n\n===Becoming civilian and coeducational and desegregated===\nIn 1955 Clemson underwent a major restructuring and was transformed into \"civilian\" status for students.

There are residence halls designated for fraternities and sororities, but there are no traditional Greek houses on campus. However, there are a few fraternity houses off campus near the college. The Fraternity Quad on campus (consisting of seven fraternity and sorority halls) is certified by the U.S. [[Green Building Council]]'s [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) program. The remaining sororities' on-campus housing is on the other end of campus, in what is commonly referred to as \"the horseshoe,\" in Smith and Barnett Halls.\n\nThe College Panhellenic Council Chapters at Clemson University include [[Alpha Phi]], [[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Alpha Delta Pi]], [[Chi Omega]], [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Delta Zeta]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], [[Kappa Delta]], [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], Pi Beta Phi, [[Sigma Kappa]], and [[Zeta Tau Alpha]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clemsongreeklife.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2&Itemid=4 |title=Chapters |publisher=Clemsongreeklife.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08}}</ref>  The Interfraternity Council Chapters include [[Alpha Gamma Rho]], [[Alpha Sigma Phi]], [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Beta Theta Pi]], [[Beta Upsilon Chi]], Chi Phi, [[Delta Chi]], [[Delta Tau Delta]], [[FarmHouse]], [[Kappa Alpha Order]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Pi Kappa Phi]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], [[Phi Delta Theta]], [[Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[Sigma Nu]], [[Theta Chi]], [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]], [[Psi Upsilon]], and [[Triangle Fraternity|Triangle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://clemsonifc.theginsystem.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=17&Itemid=31 |title=Clemson IFC - Fraternities |publisher=Clemsonifc.theginsystem.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710190420/http://clemsonifc.theginsystem.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=17&Itemid=31 |archivedate=2012-07-10 |df= }}</ref>\n\nAs of the fall 2017 semester there are twenty IFC Fraternities, thirteen NPC Sororities, eight NPHC Chapters, and four MGC Chapters, which make up approximately 23 percent of the undergraduate student body.\n\nIn 2017 15% of men and 31% of women were involved in Greek life, out of 19,825 undergraduate students.<ref name=\"Fall 2017 Greek Life Grade Summary\">{{cite web | title= Fall 2017 Grade Summary | url=http://www.clemson.edu/campus-life/fraternity-sorority-life/documents/Fall%202017%20Grade%20Summary.pdf |accessdate=May 3, 2018}}</ref> While the required GPA to join Greek life is 2.7, the mean GPA of each sorority was above the all-university mean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/campus-life/fraternity-sorority-life/|title=Fraternity and Sorority Life - Clemson University Student Affairs|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Clemson ROTC cannon.jpg|thumb|250px|Clemson's U.S. Army ROTC Battalion headquarters, found in [[Johnstone Hall]]]]\n\n===Military heritage===\nAlthough the university became a coeducational civilian institution in 1955, it still maintains an active military presence. Cadets still participate during home football games, during which cadets hold the ropes as the team enters from the Hill, and they complete pushups for every Clemson point scored, just as the Tiger does.\n\nThe university is home to detachments for [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) as well as a host school for the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] [[Officer Candidates School (United States Marine Corps)#Platoon Leaders Class|PLC]] program adjacent to the Semper Fi Society.\n\nIn addition to students from the university, these organizations also serve students from [[Anderson University (South Carolina)|Anderson University]], [[Southern Wesleyan University]], and [[Tri-County Technical College]].

The society is not associated with the ROTC, but can lead to a commission into the U.S. Marine Corps via the Platoon Leaders Course program.\n\n===Student media===\nClemson University has seven completely student-run media outlets. These organizations operate under Tiger Media, the university's student media department, and are each on the third floor of the Hendrix Student Center. These include [[The Tiger (newspaper)|''The Tiger'']], ''The Tiger Town Observer'', Tigervision, ''TAPS Yearbook'', ''The Pendulum'', ''The Chronicle'', ''The Sensible Tiger'', and [[WSBF-FM]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About Tiger Media|url=http://www.cutigervision.com/about|work=Tiger Media}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TheTigerClemson1917.png|thumb|right|400px|Logo from [[The Tiger (newspaper)|''The Tiger'']] Vol. XII No. 25 on May 2, 1917]]\n\nFounded in 1907, [[The Tiger (newspaper)|''The Tiger'']] is the oldest student-run newspaper in South Carolina. ''The Tiger'' publishes local and university related news pieces. Additionally, the paper publishes opinion articles on general and national issues, lifestyle articles on topics such as food, sex, and music. With sports being a major part of Clemson University's culture and events, ''The Tiger'' also contains a large sports section focusing on football, basketball, baseball, and soccer.

The station was created in 1994 under the name Clemson Cable Network by students at [[WSBF-FM]] who were interested in television production. The station aired a variety of student created content as well as recently released movies via a licensing agreement. By 2006, after experiencing a decline in membership and viewers, CCN was no longer consistently producing content and fell into relative obscurity. However, in 2007, CCN was reorganized into Clemson Television and began to produce student comedy shows as well as airing public domain films. As content quality began to increase, so did membership. In 2014, CTV was renamed Tigervision to coincide with its switch to high definition broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Tigervision|url=http://www.cutigervision.com/about|work=Tigervision}}</ref>\n\n''TAPS Yearbook'' was established in 1907 after members of the Clemson College Chronicle, the literary arts magazine at the time, wanted to publish a new book printed annually. It is named after the song \"Taps\", which was played each night when cadets went to bed during the college's time as a military school. Each edition of ''TAPS'' contains student portraits, information on student organizations, and reviews of the past year's events.<ref>{{cite book |title=TAPS Yearbook|date=2011|pages=357}}</ref> In 2017, ''TAPS'' announced the end of the 2017-18 academic year would mark the final edition of the yearbook.

In the beginning, WSBF's content was mostly agriculture education shows and classical music. By the mid-1960s, the station began to air sports programs such as ''The Frank Howard Show'' along with news. The station would eventually shift to a \"progressive\" format where it focused on new, up-and-coming contemporary music groups. During the 1980s, the formet would shift gradually changed to the station's current \"alternative\" format. WSBF plays a variety genres including jazz, rap, punk, rock, and folk focusing on independent artists. The station broadcasts to the Clemson area and upstate South Carolina on 88.1 FM as well as online.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of WSBF|url=https://wsbf.net/#/history|work=WSBF}}</ref>\n\n''The Chronicle'' is a literary art magazine that publishes biannually.

''The Pendulum'' often takes these topics and discusses how they affect students and the Clemson community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemsonpendulum.org|title=The Pendulum|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n''The Sensible Tiger'' is a student-run weekly newsletter established in 2018 which provides students with brief, non-partisan news in an effort ease political divides on campus. The Sensible Tiger has interviewed 2019 Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke and Washington Post contributor Josh Dawsey, and produces a biweekly Spotify podcast entitled \"The Watercooler.\"\n\n==Traditions==\n\n===Tiger Paw===\n\nThe Tiger paw became the official logo for Clemson University in 1970, in place of the previous tiger logo. The change was inspired by President Robert Edwards to \"upgrade the image of the university.\" The Tiger Paw logo was introduced at a press conference on July 21, 1970. It was created by John Antonio and developed by Helen Weaver of Henderson Advertising in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], from a mold of a [[Bengal tiger]] sent to the agency by the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The paw is now used on all athletic teams and collegiate documents. The tiger paw is also painted on surfaces throughout campus and on highways leading to the campus.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Bob|title=Death Valley Days|year=1991|publisher=Longsteet Press|isbn=978-1563520068|pages=36\u201342}}</ref>\n\n===Homecoming and Tigerama===\n\nEvery year Clemson students have the opportunity to attend Homecoming and Tigerama. The Clemson Homecoming tradition began in 1914 and has been held annually at Clemson University ever since. During homecoming week, various student organizations design and build Homecoming floats on Bowman Field. The floats are then revealed on the Saturday of the football game and judged by a select panel. Since 1957, Clemson has held \"Tigerama\" on the Friday night of homecoming week. Tigerama is one of the nation's largest student-run-pep rallies, averaging about 40,000 people. This Clemson event includes the crowning of Miss Homecoming, skits by various academic organizations, as well as a fireworks show.<ref name=\"Blackman 1999 144\"/>\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Traditions|url=http://www.clemson.edu/about/traditions.html|publisher=Clemson University|accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===First Friday Parade===\nThe First Friday Parade has been held on the Friday before the first home football game every year since 1974. The parade includes fraternities, sororities, the Clemson marching band, the university President, as well as many other student organizations.  The parade route travels through portions of Highway 93 and Main Street and concludes at the university's [[amphitheatre]], where the first pep rally of the year is held.

One of the cadets in attendance, A.C. Corcoran of [[Charleston, South Carolina]], decided to remedy the situation and wrote the words to the alma mater and set them to [[Annie Lisle]], which was the melody of [[Cornell University]]'s alma mater, as well as many others. The words were later officially accepted by the then-named Clemson Agricultural College as the alma mater and was first performed by the Clemson Glee Club on February 17, 1919.<ref name=\"Alma Mater\">{{cite web|title=The Mystery of the Clemson Alma Mater|url=http://www.clemson.edu/tigerband/History_AlmaMater.htm|publisher=Clemson University|accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1947 the club \"Tiger Brotherhood\" decided that, rather than continue borrowing another school's melody, the university should compose its own. As a result, the Tiger Brotherhood sponsored a contest to have Clemson students compose a unique melody. On May 5, 1947, Clemson University's school newspaper \"The Tiger\" announced Robert E. Farmer of [[Anderson, South Carolina]], a member of the glee club at the time, as the winner. Farmer's melody was slightly altered in 1970, but was restored to its original tune in 2009.<ref name = \"Alma Mater\" />\n\n===Fight song===\nThe university's fight song is the [[jazz standard]], the \"[[Tiger Rag]]\".<ref>\"[http://www.clemson.edu/about/traditions.html Traditions]\".
