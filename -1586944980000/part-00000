Ava Helen Pauling advocated this movement and encouraged her husband to become educated on Streit's philosophy.  As a result, Linus Pauling became publicly involved in the cause, eventually joining the [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] chapter of Federal Union, the organizational outgrowth of Union Now. In 1940, thanks in part to Ava Helen's suggestion, Linus Pauling gave his first political speech, urging his audience to consider Union Now as a movement toward a viable system of government. This effectively began Pauling's career as a public proponent of peace and human rights.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chris Petersen|author2=Cliff Mead|title=The Pauling Catalogue, Vol. 3|publisher=Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections|year=2006|pages=206\u2013208|isbn=0-9629082-6-6}}</ref>\n\n===Women's rights===\nAva Helen was deeply involved in the movement for women's rights.

It was released on September 16, 2008, by [[Columbia Records]].\n\nAfter independently releasing the 2004 album ''[[Ray Ray]]'', Saadiq continued working on other artists' projects and developed a partnership with audio engineer Charles Brungardt, who shared the singer's fascination with historic recording techniques and equipment. In 2008, he returned from a vacation that inspired him to pursue classic [[soul music]] and recorded ''The Way I See It'' primarily at his [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood]] studio with the engineer.\n\nSaadiq and Brungardt disregarded their previous experience in recording production while making ''The Way I See It''. Instead, they experimented with older recording techniques in an attempt to recreate the [[Motown]] music aesthetic of the 1960s, producing a traditional soul album that draws on the [[Motown#Motown Sound|Motown Sound]] and [[Philadelphia soul]] styles. Saadiq, whose lyrics mostly deal with romantic subject matter, described it as a series of love songs about music and remaining faithful to it despite trends.\n\n''The Way I See It'' was initially overlooked by consumers, but [[record chart|charted]] steadily on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and eventually sold 282,000 copies in the United States by 2011. It also performed well in European countries such as France, where it charted for 51 weeks. The album received mostly positive reviews from critics and was seen as an exemplary release of the classic soul revival at the time.

Brungardt interned at Blakeslee Recording Company, Saadiq's [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood]] recording studio, and eventually became his principal sonic partner on projects. The two shared a fascination with historic recording techniques and equipment. They also studied the 2006 book ''[[Recording The Beatles]]'' together and had an interest in the knowledge of recording gear by engineers and technicians for English [[rock music|rock]] band [[The Beatles]].<ref name=\"Britton\">{{cite journal |last=Britton |first=Jack |date=March 2011 |url=http://www.emusician.com/pop/0808/a-modern-throwback/136231 |title=A Modern Throwback |journal=[[Electronic Musician]] |location=New York |accessdate=March 27, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ApgdQ1uP?url=http://www.emusician.com/pop/0808/a-modern-throwback/136231 |archivedate=September 21, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Brungardt increased his [[audio engineering|engineering]] output, and in 2007, Saadiq enlisted him to engineer and [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]] English singer [[Joss Stone]]'s studio album ''[[Introducing Joss Stone]]'',<ref name=\"Britton\"/> which Saadiq produced.<ref name=\"Lewis\">{{cite journal|last=Lewis |first=Pete |url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/409/raphael_saadiq_this_years_vintage/ |title=Raphael Saadiq: This Years Vintage |journal=[[Blues & Soul]] |location=London |issue=1020 |date=May 22, 2009 |accessdate=March 27, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Apgl4SvN?url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/409/raphael_saadiq_this_years_vintage/ |archivedate=September 21, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWhile vacationing in [[the Bahamas]] and [[Costa Rica]] in 2008, Saadiq observed people there listening to classic [[soul music]] and was inspired to pursue it as a musical direction for his next album. He recounted the experience in an interview for ''[[Blues & Soul]]'', saying that \"I was like 'Wow, maybe I should tap into this vibe, because it\u2019s actually what I LOVE!' ... I realised that, though you can hear it in many of the records I've done throughout my career, I'd never paid 100% attention to going in that direction before.

Label executive [[Rick Rubin]] visited Saadiq's home studio and was impressed by his material there. He said of Rubin's visit and advice to him as a solo artist, \"He told me to never box myself in.

In an interview for ''[[Sound on Sound]]'', he discussed his comfort level when returning to Blakeslee Recording Company: \"The music for this album flowed organically, naturally, and since I have my own studio I was able to perfect it and take my time to make it right. I was able to live with it day after day, and I think that had a lot to do with how the album turned out.\" He wrote the songs extemporaneously, often by playing guitar and improvising riffs. He subsequently sung them while playing each instrument one at a time, including guitar, bass, and basic piano parts that he planned to include on the recordings. He attributed this secluded approach to \"the state of the industry\" and idealized \"bounc[ing] ideas off other people, do some writing with them, take the material to my band and say, 'OK, let's cut it,' with the orchestra already there. That's my dream.

Brungardt used various standard mics for the [[snare drum]] to achieve a more solid cracking sound,<ref name=\"Buskin\"/> rather than capturing the drum's overall tone. Their miking of the guitars' amps was adapted from ''The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions'', and as Brungardt recounted, \"It really gave us warmth and character. It allowed the amp to breathe and we got the tones of the amp along with the room. For me, that really opened things up so that I could play with the live room, using different [[reverberation|reverbs]] to get a sound.\" For Saadiq's bass, they used a [[DI unit]] to connect a microphone [[preamplifier]], increased the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] on a plug-in for less compression, and adjusted the low-end tones with an equalizer plug-in.<ref name=\"Farinella\"/>\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n[[File:Hitsville USA.jpg|right|thumb|''The Way I See It'' draws on the music of 1960s Motown ([[Hitsville U.S.A.|former headquarters]] pictured).]]\n\n''The Way I See It'' has a traditional soul style fashioned after the 1960s [[Motown#Motown Sound|Motown Sound]] and [[Philadelphia soul]].<ref name=\"Mulvey\">{{cite journal|last=Mulvey|first=John|title=Raphael Saadiq \u2013 The Way I See It|journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|location=London|date=May 2009|page=97}}</ref> It is a departure from Saadiq's previous work with [[neo soul]],<ref name=\"Pareles\"/> which bears a [[hip hop music|hip hop]] influence.<ref name=\"Whelan\"/> J.

It was released on September 16, 2008, by [[Columbia Records]].\n\nAfter independently releasing the 2004 album ''[[Ray Ray]]'', Saadiq continued working on other artists' projects and developed a partnership with audio engineer Charles Brungardt, who shared the singer's fascination with historic recording techniques and equipment. In 2008, he returned from a vacation that inspired him to pursue classic [[soul music]] and recorded ''The Way I See It'' primarily at his [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood]] studio with the engineer.\n\nSaadiq and Brungardt disregarded their previous experience in recording production while making ''The Way I See It''. Instead, they experimented with older recording techniques in an attempt to recreate the [[Motown]] music aesthetic of the 1960s, producing a traditional soul album that draws on the [[Motown#Motown Sound|Motown Sound]] and [[Philadelphia soul]] styles. Saadiq, whose lyrics mostly deal with romantic subject matter, described it as a series of love songs about music and remaining faithful to it despite trends.\n\n''The Way I See It'' was initially overlooked by consumers, but [[record chart|charted]] steadily on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and eventually sold 282,000 copies in the United States by 2011. It also performed well in European countries such as France, where it charted for 51 weeks. The album received mostly positive reviews from critics and was seen as an exemplary release of the classic soul revival at the time. It garnered Saadiq a newer, more diverse audience as he toured extensively in support of the album, performing concerts in the US, Europe, and Asia.\n\n== Background ==\nAfter releasing his second studio album ''[[Ray Ray]]'' in 2004,<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilson |first=MacKenzie |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/raphael-saadiq-mn0000402249 |title=Raphael Saadiq \u2013 Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=[[Allmusic]].

He recounted the experience in an interview for ''[[Blues & Soul]]'', saying that \"I was like 'Wow, maybe I should tap into this vibe, because it\u2019s actually what I LOVE!' ... I realised that, though you can hear it in many of the records I've done throughout my career, I'd never paid 100% attention to going in that direction before. So the difference this time is that I took a more focused route.\"<ref name=\"Lewis\"/> As a part of [[Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9!]] during the late 1980s and 1990s, Saadiq had incorporated influences from the music of [[Motown]] in his songwriting for the group.<ref name=\"Britton\"/> Before recording ''The Way I See It'', Saadiq signed to [[Columbia Records]].

In an interview for ''[[Sound on Sound]]'', he discussed his comfort level when returning to Blakeslee Recording Company: \"The music for this album flowed organically, naturally, and since I have my own studio I was able to perfect it and take my time to make it right. I was able to live with it day after day, and I think that had a lot to do with how the album turned out.\" He wrote the songs extemporaneously, often by playing guitar and improvising riffs. He subsequently sung them while playing each instrument one at a time, including guitar, bass, and basic piano parts that he planned to include on the recordings. He attributed this secluded approach to \"the state of the industry\" and idealized \"bounc[ing] ideas off other people, do some writing with them, take the material to my band and say, 'OK, let's cut it,' with the orchestra already there. That's my dream.

However, they ultimately found live instrumentalists more dynamic and challenged themselves to reproduce older music productions and the Motown aesthetic of the 1960s.<ref name=\"Britton\"/> To familiarize themselves with vintage recording techniques, they studied [[Mark Lewisohn]]'s 1988 book ''[[The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions]]'',<ref name=\"Buskin\"/> books about Motown Records, and images of the label's studio personnel, setup of instruments, and [[microphone practice|microphone placement]].<ref name=\"Britton\"/> They also studied Motown [[Equalization (audio)|EQ]]s to achieve a tone they found adequate for songs' rhythm guitar parts.<ref name=\"Britton\"/> Saadiq said that he had to disregard \"about 85 to 90 percent of the new techniques ... People used to take recording very seriously. They used to wear lab coats at [[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road]]. So I got serious with what I was trying to do, both mentally and physically.\"<ref name=\"Farinella\"/> Brungardt said in an interview for ''[[Mix (magazine)|Mix]]'' that he abandoned the approach learned on previous records he had engineered, where \"they wanted it clean with no distortion.

Brungardt used various standard mics for the [[snare drum]] to achieve a more solid cracking sound,<ref name=\"Buskin\"/> rather than capturing the drum's overall tone. Their miking of the guitars' amps was adapted from ''The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions'', and as Brungardt recounted, \"It really gave us warmth and character. It allowed the amp to breathe and we got the tones of the amp along with the room. For me, that really opened things up so that I could play with the live room, using different [[reverberation|reverbs]] to get a sound.\" For Saadiq's bass, they used a [[DI unit]] to connect a microphone [[preamplifier]], increased the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] on a plug-in for less compression, and adjusted the low-end tones with an equalizer plug-in.<ref name=\"Farinella\"/>\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n[[File:Hitsville USA.jpg|right|thumb|''The Way I See It'' draws on the music of 1960s Motown ([[Hitsville U.S.A.|former headquarters]] pictured).]]\n\n''The Way I See It'' has a traditional soul style fashioned after the 1960s [[Motown#Motown Sound|Motown Sound]] and [[Philadelphia soul]].<ref name=\"Mulvey\">{{cite journal|last=Mulvey|first=John|title=Raphael Saadiq \u2013 The Way I See It|journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|location=London|date=May 2009|page=97}}</ref> It is a departure from Saadiq's previous work with [[neo soul]],<ref name=\"Pareles\"/> which bears a [[hip hop music|hip hop]] influence.<ref name=\"Whelan\"/> J.

Some ecological organizations, such as the [[Xerces Society]], have attempted to raise awareness of their benefits, to counteract the general agricultural and home garden labeling of thistles as unwanted weeds. The monarch butterfly, ''[[Danaus plexippus]]'' for instance, was highlighted as traditionally relying upon taller large-flowered thistle species such as Tall thistle, ''[[Cirsium altissimum]]'', for its migration.<ref name=\"Xerces\"/> Although such organizations focus on the benefits of native thistles, certain non-native thistles, such as ''[[Cirsium vulgare]]'' in North America, may provide similar benefits to wildlife. Some prairie and wildflower seed production companies supply bulk seed for native North American thistle species, for wildlife habitat restoration, although availability tends to be low. Thistles are particularly valued by bumblebees for their high nectar production.

[[Pound coins]] with this motto and a thistle were minted in 1984, 1989, and 2014. The combination of thistle and motto first appeared on the bawbee issued by King Charles II. In 1826 the [[grant of arms]] to the new [[National Bank of Scotland]] stipulates that the shield be surrounded by thistles and \"thistle\" is used as [[Thistle (disambiguation)#Football (soccer) clubs|the name]] of several [[football in Scotland|Scottish football]] clubs.

This floral combination appears on the present issues of the one pound coin. Beside the Tudor rose and Irish [[shamrock]] the thistle appears on the badge of the [[Yeomen of the Guard]] and the arms of the [[Canada Company]]. Issues of the historical [[florin (British coin)|florin]] showed the same flora, later including a leek. The thistle is also used to symbolise connection with Scotland overseas. For example, in Canada, it is one of the four floral emblems on the [[flag of Montreal]]; in the US, [[Carnegie Mellon University]] features the thistle in its crest in honour of the Scottish heritage of its founder, [[Andrew Carnegie]]. The thistle is also the emblem of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', which originated in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nWhich species of thistle is referred to in the original legend is disputed. Popular modern usage favours cotton thistle (''[[Onopordum acanthium]]''), perhaps because of its more imposing appearance, though it is unlikely to have occurred in Scotland in medieval times; the spear thistle (''[[Cirsium vulgare]]''), an abundant native species in Scotland, is a more likely candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twocrows.co.uk/kaleidescopes/text-pages/thistle-text.html |title=Flowers of Scotland: Thistle |publisher=Twocrows.co.uk |date= |accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ormiston.com/ormiston/tartan/thistle.htm |title=Why is the THISTLE a Scottish national symbol? |publisher=Ormiston.com |date= |accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref> Other species, including dwarf thistle (''[[Cirsium acaule]]''), musk thistle (''[[Carduus nutans]]''), and melancholy thistle (''[[Cirsium heterophyllum]]'') have also been suggested.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitscotland.com/guide/scotland-factfile/scottish-icons/the-thistle |title=Scotland Fact File: The Thistle |publisher=Visitscotland.com |date= |accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Thistle of Lorraine===\n[[File:Grandes Armes de Nancy.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], former capital of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]].]]\nThe thistle, and more precisely ''[[Onopordum acanthium]]'', is one of the symbols of [[Lorraine]], together with its coat of arms which displays three [[avalerion]]s, and the [[Cross of Lorraine]].\n\nLorraine is a region located in northeastern France, along the border with [[Luxembourg]] and [[Germany]]. Before the [[French Revolution]], a large part of the region formed the [[Duchy of Lorraine]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], the thistle was an emblem of the [[Virgin Mary]] because its white sap would bring to mind the milk falling from the breast of the Mother of God. It was later adopted as a personal symbol by [[Ren\u00e9 of Anjou]], together with the Cross of Lorraine, then known as the Cross of Anjou. It seems through his book ''Livre du cuer d'amours espris'' that the Duke chose the thistle as his emblem not only because it was a Christian symbol, but also because he associated it with physical love.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Histoire de Nancy|author=Christian Pfister|volume=1|publisher=Berger-Levrault|year=1908|page=554}}</ref>\n\nThe thistle and the cross were used again by his grandson, [[Ren\u00e9 II, Duke of Lorraine]], who introduced them in the region. The  two symbols became hugely popular among the local people during the [[Battle of Nancy]] in 1477, during which the Lorrain army defeated [[Burgundy]]. The Duke's motto was \"''Qui s'y frotte s'y pique''\", meaning \"who touches it, pricks oneself\", with a similar idea to the Scottish motto \"''[[Nemo me impune lacessit]]''\". Nowadays the thistle is still the official symbol of the city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], as well as the emblem of the [[AS Nancy]] football team, and the [[Lorraine Regional Natural Park]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mooc.tela-botanica.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=18810|title=Le chardon|publisher=Tela Botanica|accessdate=11 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nancy-webtv.fr/index.php/sommaire/622-origine-du-blason-de-nancy|title=Origine du blason de Nancy|publisher=Nancy WebTV|accessdate=11 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Place names==\n''Carduus'' is the [[Latin language|Latin]] term for a thistle (hence [[cardoon]], ''chardon'' in French), and ''Cardonnacum'' is the Latin word for a place with thistles.

Some ecological organizations, such as the [[Xerces Society]], have attempted to raise awareness of their benefits, to counteract the general agricultural and home garden labeling of thistles as unwanted weeds. The monarch butterfly, ''[[Danaus plexippus]]'' for instance, was highlighted as traditionally relying upon taller large-flowered thistle species such as Tall thistle, ''[[Cirsium altissimum]]'', for its migration.<ref name=\"Xerces\"/> Although such organizations focus on the benefits of native thistles, certain non-native thistles, such as ''[[Cirsium vulgare]]'' in North America, may provide similar benefits to wildlife. Some prairie and wildflower seed production companies supply bulk seed for native North American thistle species, for wildlife habitat restoration, although availability tends to be low. Thistles are particularly valued by bumblebees for their high nectar production.

[[Pound coins]] with this motto and a thistle were minted in 1984, 1989, and 2014. The combination of thistle and motto first appeared on the bawbee issued by King Charles II. In 1826 the [[grant of arms]] to the new [[National Bank of Scotland]] stipulates that the shield be surrounded by thistles and \"thistle\" is used as [[Thistle (disambiguation)#Football (soccer) clubs|the name]] of several [[football in Scotland|Scottish football]] clubs.

As part of the arms of the [[University of Edinburgh]], the thistle appears together with a saltire on one of the escutcheons of the [[Mercat Cross, Edinburgh|Mercat Cross in Edinburgh]].

This floral combination appears on the present issues of the one pound coin. Beside the Tudor rose and Irish [[shamrock]] the thistle appears on the badge of the [[Yeomen of the Guard]] and the arms of the [[Canada Company]]. Issues of the historical [[florin (British coin)|florin]] showed the same flora, later including a leek. The thistle is also used to symbolise connection with Scotland overseas. For example, in Canada, it is one of the four floral emblems on the [[flag of Montreal]]; in the US, [[Carnegie Mellon University]] features the thistle in its crest in honour of the Scottish heritage of its founder, [[Andrew Carnegie]]. The thistle is also the emblem of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', which originated in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nWhich species of thistle is referred to in the original legend is disputed. Popular modern usage favours cotton thistle (''[[Onopordum acanthium]]''), perhaps because of its more imposing appearance, though it is unlikely to have occurred in Scotland in medieval times; the spear thistle (''[[Cirsium vulgare]]''), an abundant native species in Scotland, is a more likely candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twocrows.co.uk/kaleidescopes/text-pages/thistle-text.html |title=Flowers of Scotland: Thistle |publisher=Twocrows.co.uk |date= |accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ormiston.com/ormiston/tartan/thistle.htm |title=Why is the THISTLE a Scottish national symbol? |publisher=Ormiston.com |date= |accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref> Other species, including dwarf thistle (''[[Cirsium acaule]]''), musk thistle (''[[Carduus nutans]]''), and melancholy thistle (''[[Cirsium heterophyllum]]'') have also been suggested.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitscotland.com/guide/scotland-factfile/scottish-icons/the-thistle |title=Scotland Fact File: The Thistle |publisher=Visitscotland.com |date= |accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Thistle of Lorraine===\n[[File:Grandes Armes de Nancy.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], former capital of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]].]]\nThe thistle, and more precisely ''[[Onopordum acanthium]]'', is one of the symbols of [[Lorraine]], together with its coat of arms which displays three [[avalerion]]s, and the [[Cross of Lorraine]].\n\nLorraine is a region located in northeastern France, along the border with [[Luxembourg]] and [[Germany]]. Before the [[French Revolution]], a large part of the region formed the [[Duchy of Lorraine]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], the thistle was an emblem of the [[Virgin Mary]] because its white sap would bring to mind the milk falling from the breast of the Mother of God. It was later adopted as a personal symbol by [[Ren\u00e9 of Anjou]], together with the Cross of Lorraine, then known as the Cross of Anjou. It seems through his book ''Livre du cuer d'amours espris'' that the Duke chose the thistle as his emblem not only because it was a Christian symbol, but also because he associated it with physical love.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Histoire de Nancy|author=Christian Pfister|volume=1|publisher=Berger-Levrault|year=1908|page=554}}</ref>\n\nThe thistle and the cross were used again by his grandson, [[Ren\u00e9 II, Duke of Lorraine]], who introduced them in the region. The  two symbols became hugely popular among the local people during the [[Battle of Nancy]] in 1477, during which the Lorrain army defeated [[Burgundy]]. The Duke's motto was \"''Qui s'y frotte s'y pique''\", meaning \"who touches it, pricks oneself\", with a similar idea to the Scottish motto \"''[[Nemo me impune lacessit]]''\". Nowadays the thistle is still the official symbol of the city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], as well as the emblem of the [[AS Nancy]] football team, and the [[Lorraine Regional Natural Park]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mooc.tela-botanica.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=18810|title=Le chardon|publisher=Tela Botanica|accessdate=11 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nancy-webtv.fr/index.php/sommaire/622-origine-du-blason-de-nancy|title=Origine du blason de Nancy|publisher=Nancy WebTV|accessdate=11 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Place names==\n''Carduus'' is the [[Latin language|Latin]] term for a thistle (hence [[cardoon]], ''chardon'' in French), and ''Cardonnacum'' is the Latin word for a place with thistles.

It has the chemical formula MgC{{sub|2}}O{{sub|4}}.  Magnesium oxalate is a white solid that comes in two forms: an [[anhydrous]] form and a [[dihydrate]] form where two water molecules are complexed with the structure.  Both forms are practically insoluble in water and are insoluble in organic solutions.\n\n== Natural occurrence ==\nSome oxalates can be found in nature and the most known naturally occurring oxalates are whewellite and weddellite, which are calcium oxalates.  Magnesium oxalate has been found naturally near Mill of Johnston which is located close to Insch in northeast Scotland.  The naturally occurring magnesium oxalate is called glushinskite.  The magnesium oxalate was found  at the lichen and rock interface on serpentinite.  It was found in a creamy white layer which was mixed in with the lichen fungus.  A scanning electron micrograph of samples taken showed that the crystals had a pyramidal structure with both curved and striated faces.  The size of these crystals ranged from  2 to 5 \u03bcm.<ref name=\"Source4\">{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=M |author2=D. Jones |author3=D.J.

Magnesium oxide is important because it is used as a catalyst, refractory materials, adsorbents, superconductors, and ferroelectric materials.  Nano sized particles of magnesium oxide are optimal for some of these uses because of the larger surface area to volume ratio as compared with larger particles.  Most common syntheses of magnesium oxide produce fairly large particles, however, the sol-gel synthesis using magnesium oxalate produces highly stable nano sized particles of magnesium oxide.  The sol-gel synthesis involves combining a magnesium salt, or in this case magnesium oxalate, with a gelating agent.  This process effectively produces nano sized particles of magnesium oxide.<ref name=\"Source6\">{{cite journal|last=Mastuli|first=Mohd|author2=Roshidah Rusdi |author3=Annie Mahat |author4=Norazira Saat |author5=Norlida Kamarulzaman  |title=Sol-Gel Synthesis of Highly Stable Nano Sized MgO from Magnesium Oxalate Dihydrate|journal=Advanced Materials Research|year=2012|volume=545|pages=137\u2013142 |doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.545.137}}</ref>\n\n== Health and safety ==\nMagnesium oxalate is a skin and eye irritant.  If inhaled, it will irritate the lungs and [[mucous membrane]]s.  Magnesium oxalate has no known chronic effects nor any carcinogenic effects.  If magnesium oxalate does come in contact with skin or eyes, flush with water for at least 15 minutes and call a physician if irritation occurs.  If inhaled, go to fresh air and call  a physician.  If swallowed, call a physician immediately.  If a spill occurs wash with water and make sure that no dust is released into the air.  Dispose of the wash water accordingly.  Whenever working with magnesium oxalate, safety goggles, boots, and a lab apron should be worn.  If there is dust in the air, a respirator should be worn also.  Magnesium oxalate is non-flammable and stable, but in fire conditions it will give off toxic fumes.  According to OSHA, magnesium oxalate is considered to be hazardous.<ref name=\"Source7\">{{cite web|url=http://ull.chemistry.uakron.edu/erd/Chemicals/28000/26173.html|title=Magnesium

He focuses on the rise in presidential fundraising and the targeting of key electoral states throughout a president's term in office \u2013 illustrating that recent presidents have disproportionately visited those states that are important to their political prospects while largely neglecting those without electoral payoff.

He focuses on the rise in presidential fundraising and the targeting of key electoral states throughout a president's term in office \u2013 illustrating that recent presidents have disproportionately visited those states that are important to their political prospects while largely neglecting those without electoral payoff.

The program centers on a high-technology military [[helicopter]], code named  [[Airwolf (helicopter)|''Airwolf'']], and its crew as they undertake various exotic missions, many involving [[espionage]], with a [[Cold War]] theme.\n\nThe show was created by [[Donald P. Bellisario]] and was produced over four seasons. The first three seasons' main cast consisted of [[Jan-Michael Vincent]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], and [[Alex Cord]], and from the second season onwards [[Jean Bruce Scott]] was added as a regular. The show originally aired on [[CBS]] and after the original series was cancelled, a fourth season, with an entirely new cast and on a much smaller budget, was filmed in Canada for the [[USA Network]].\n\nThe show's distinctive musical score, which was originally orchestral, but shifted to more synthesizer-based arrangements early in the second season, was composed and mainly conducted by [[Sylvester Levay]]. Udi Harpaz conducted the scores for many later second- and third-season episodes.\n\n==Series synopsis==\n[[Image:Airwolf side.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bell 222]] as [[Airwolf (helicopter)|''Airwolf'']]]]\n\nThe fictional ''Airwolf'' is described as an advanced prototype [[Supersonic aircraft|supersonic helicopter]] with [[Stealth aircraft|stealth]] capabilities and a formidable arsenal, was designed by Charles Henry Moffet{{reference needed|date=May 2019}} ([[David Hemmings]])\u2014a genius with a psychopathic taste for torturing and killing women\u2014and built by \"the Firm\", a division of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (a play on the term \"the Company\", a nickname for the CIA). As the series begins, Moffet and his crew steal ''Airwolf'' during a live-fire weapons test. During the theft, Moffet opens fire on the Firm's bunker, killing a United States Senator and seriously injuring Firm deputy director Michael Coldsmith-Briggs III (code name \"Archangel\"). Moffet takes the gunship to [[Libya]], where he begins performing acts of aggression\u2014such as sinking an American [[destroyer]]\u2014as a service for [[Muammar Gaddafi]], who allows Moffet to keep ''Airwolf'' on Libyan soil.\n\nArchangel recruits the reclusive Stringfellow Hawke (Vincent), the chief [[test pilot]] during the development of ''Airwolf'', to recover the gunship. Archangel leaves his assistant Gabrielle Ademaur ([[Belinda Bauer (actress)|Belinda Bauer]])\u2014who becomes Hawke's love interest\u2014at Hawke's cabin to brief him for his mission. A week later, after an undercover operative in Libya is killed in the line of duty, Gabrielle is sent in undercover and Hawke is sent in sooner than originally planned. With the assistance of pilot and father figure Dominic Santini (Borgnine), Hawke finds and recovers Airwolf, but Gabrielle is tortured and killed by Moffet. Hawke obliterates Moffet with a hail of missiles from Airwolf before returning to the United States. Instead of returning the gunship, Hawke and Santini booby-trap Airwolf and hide it in \"the Lair\", a large natural cave in the remote \"Valley of the Gods\" (visually modeled on [[Monument Valley]]). Hawke refuses to return Airwolf until the Firm can find and recover his brother, St. John ([[Christopher Connelly]]), who has been [[missing in action]] since the [[Vietnam War]]. To obtain access to ''Airwolf'', Archangel offers Hawke protection from other government agencies who might try to recover ''Airwolf''; in return, Hawke and Santini must fly missions of national importance for the Firm.\n\nThe Firm, during the first three seasons, served as both ally and enemy for Hawke and Santini; when an opportunity to seize ''Airwolf'' presented itself, Firm operatives often took it. The first season of the series was dark, arc driven, and quite reflective of the contemporary Cold War, with the Firm personnel distinctly dressed in white, implicitly boasting that \"wearing [[black and white hat symbolism in film|white hats]]\" distinguished them as good instead of evil. Hawke remained unconvinced, and Santini was skeptical, also; this was explained in the season-one episode \"Daddy's Gone a Hunt'n\". Early episodes frequently detailed the efforts of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] to recover ''Airwolf'' from Hawke, who is officially charged with having stolen it. Because CBS wanted to make the series more family oriented, the program was transformed during season two into a more light-hearted show, with Hawke and Santini portrayed as cooperative partners with the Firm. This persisted into the fourth season with the newly introduced \"Company\" and the new crew of ''Airwolf''.\n\n===Cast===\n{{overly detailed|section|date=April 2016}}\n\n====Seasons 1 through 3====\n\n'''Stringfellow \"String\" Hawke''' ([[Jan-Michael Vincent]]): When Stringfellow Hawke was ten,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/airwolf/watch/random-target-37825/|title=Watch Airwolf - Random Target Online - TV.com|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=TV.com}}</ref> he and his parents were involved in a boating accident. He was rescued by his brother St John, but their parents drowned. After the death of his parents and the subsequent death of his girlfriend in a car crash, Stringfellow grew to believe that anyone he loved was destined to die tragically. In a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] mission during the [[Vietnam War]], Stringfellow was separated from St. John; Stringfellow was rescued, but St. John was not. St. John was subsequently listed as [[Missing in action|M.I.A.]], causing Stringfellow to further withdraw from society. Stringfellow had a [[Master's degree]] in [[applied physics]] and, while often hot tempered, could be pragmatic. An avid fisherman, Stringfellow ate fish, but refused to eat red meat; he also refused to wear underwear. Stringfellow lived in seclusion in a log cabin by [[Lake Hemet]] (outside [[Los Angeles]]) with his [[Bluetick Coonhound]] \"Tet\" (named after the 1968 [[Communism|communist]] [[Tet Offensive]]), where he serenaded eagles on his priceless [[Stradivarius]] [[cello]]. Hawke had a remarkable collection of rare paintings, which his grandfather collected for his grandmother.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">From \"Shadow of the Hawke\", Season 1, Episode 1</ref>\n\nIn 1982, Stringfellow served as a test pilot for Airwolf during its development program. As he was one of several pilots to fly Airwolf, the Firm recruited him to recover Airwolf after its designer, Doctor Charles Henry Moffet, absconded with it and took it to [[Libya]]. With the assistance of Dominic Santini, Hawke recovered Airwolf. Upon returning to the United States, the Firm failed to provide Stringfellow with new information regarding St. John. In retaliation, Hawke and Santini hid Airwolf, vowing not to return it until St. John was found. In return for protection from the government, Stringfellow piloted Airwolf on national security missions for the Firm.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In the first episode of Season 4, Stringfellow was gravely wounded by an explosion, but was carried from the hospital (with an unknown outcome) by his recently returned brother, St. John.<ref>From \"Blackjack\", Season 4, Episode 1</ref>\n\n'''Dominic \"Dom\" Santini''' ([[Ernest Borgnine]]): Santini was born and raised on the fictional [[Caribbean]] island nation of San Remo. Santini was of [[Italian Americans|Italian-American]] descent and was [[multilingualism|bilingual]], speaking both English and Italian fluently.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> A ladies' man in his youth, Dominic was forced to marry Lila\u2014a young woman from a wealthy family\u2014when she falsely claimed to be carrying his child (she would not truly become pregnant until years after their marriage). Though Lila left Dominic and took their daughter, Sally Ann, when Sally was 7, Dominic always kept his cottage in San Remo in the hope that Sally would return. Sally Ann followed a \"[[jet set]]\" existence focused on the casino in San Remo; Lila used Sally to provide her with male companionship. Sally Ann Santini died of a drug overdose in 1984, which devastated Dominic. Weeks later, Lila was murdered by San Remo's criminal element while attempting to blackmail the owner of San Remo's casino; when Dominic was arrested for her murder, Stringfellow helped bring the guilty parties to justice and used Airwolf to destroy the casino.<ref>From \"Sins of the Past\", Season 2, Episode 6</ref> Santini's other known relatives include his younger brother Tony Santini and Tony's daughter (Dominic's niece) Jo Santini, who becomes an important supporting character on the series during its fourth and final season. Dominic also has another niece, Holly Mathews, who suffers from a delusional emotional illness and nearly causes a disaster for her uncle and his friends during the Season 2 episode \"The Truth About Holly.\"\n\nSantini was a veteran of [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]], serving as a combat aviator for the [[U.S. Army]] in both conflicts. During his wartime experiences, Santini became a good friend of fellow American military aviator Alan B. Hawke. After Hawke and his wife were killed in a boating accident, Santini raised the Hawkes' two young sons. After St John Hawke went [[missing in action]] during the [[Vietnam War]], Santini and Stringfellow Hawke dedicated themselves to the operation of Santini Air, a [[Van Nuys]], [[California]]-based air charter service founded and owned by Santini that specializes in performing aerial stunts for [[Hollywood]] film productions.\n\nSantini served as flight engineer on Airwolf, with Stringfellow as pilot and aircraft commander. When necessary, Santini would also occasionally take Hawke's place as Airwolf's pilot. Santini had great admiration and fondness for the elegant and sleek espionage aircraft, which he affectionately dubbed \"the Lady\". He harbored a distrust of the Firm, especially its deputy director Michael Coldsmith-Briggs III, who was codenamed \"Archangel\" but whom Santini derisively termed \"[[Mister Clean]]\".\n\nIn 1987, in the first episode of Season 4, Dominic was killed in the same helicopter explosion that also severely injured Stringfellow Hawke. This explosion was caused by an act of sabotage by Santini's and Hawke's enemies.\n\n'''Michael Coldsmith-Briggs III''' ([[Alex Cord]]): Codenamed \"Archangel\", Coldsmith-Briggs was the Firm's [[Take point|point man]] on the Airwolf project. He was present at the weapons test where Moffet stole Airwolf and used the gunship's weaponry to destroy the Firm's bunker. As a result of the attack, Archangel suffered injuries to his left arm and leg, and lost the sight in his left eye (which he usually covered with either a black eyeglass lens or a white patch). His leg injuries left him with a limp, for which he used a silver-handled cane. Archangel routinely wore white three-piece suits with a white tie and a white [[Panama hat]], which was a standard uniform for operatives of the Firm.\n\nArchangel recruited Stringfellow to recapture Airwolf, seizing Stringfellow's art collection (allegedly at the insistence of the Firm) to ensure his participation. After Stringfellow refused to return Airwolf, Archangel brokered a deal by which he would provide government assistance for Airwolf (and Stringfellow's quest to find St. John) in exchange for the use of Airwolf on missions of national importance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Though he was usually the man dispatching Airwolf on missions, Archangel occasionally served as flight engineer on Airwolf.<ref>First occurred during \"Bite of the Jackal\", Season 1, Episode 3</ref>\n\nIn the first two seasons, Archangel was often assisted by Marella ([[Deborah Pratt]]). She had doctorates in [[Aeronautical Engineering]], [[Electronic Engineering]], [[Psychology]], [[Microbiology]], and [[French Literature]], and was one year away from completing her [[Doctor of Medicine|Medical Doctorate]] as of the episode \"Fallen Angel.\" Marella was last seen in the final episode of Season 2, \"Short Walk to Freedom\"; in Season 3, she was replaced by a series of minor characters. In 1987, at the beginning of Season 4, Archangel was suddenly (and unexpectedly) reassigned to the [[Middle East]], and was not mentioned for the remainder of the series.\n\n'''Caitlin O'Shannessy''' ([[Jean Bruce Scott]]): A helicopter pilot for the [[Texas Highway Patrol]], Caitlin first crossed paths with Airwolf when the gunship prevented her from being assaulted by four [[redneck]]s during the events of the Season 2 episode \"Sweet Britches\". After saving Stringfellow from a corrupt sheriff (and, in turn, being saved by Airwolf from being assaulted again), Caitlin tracked Stringfellow to Santini Air. Santini hired Caitlin, who had left the Highway Patrol, as a pilot for Santini Air. After initially covering up the existence of Airwolf, the events of Season 2 episode \"Fallen Angel\" resulted in her being added to the Airwolf crew, serving as either a pilot or flight engineer (as the situation required). Caitlin was never mentioned in Season 4.\n\n====Season 4====\n'''St. John Hawke''' ([[Barry Van Dyke]]): Brother of Stringfellow, and raised by Santini after the death of his parents. Van Dyke took over the role from Christopher Connelly, who portrayed the character in early CBS episodes. Santini taught both Stringfellow and St. John how to fly, and both brothers showed particular talent as [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] aviators during the Vietnam War. In 1969, St. John was separated from Stringfellow and the rest of his unit during a mission. He would remain missing in action for the next 18 years, until he was suddenly located in a deep-cover CIA mission in 1987. Returning to the United States, he reunited with Stringfellow and, due to his brother's injuries, took over as pilot of Airwolf.\n\n'''Major Mike Rivers''' ([[Geraint Wyn Davies]]): Air Force Major tasked with locating Airwolf during the season 4 episode \"Blackjack.\"\n\n'''Jo Santini''' ([[Michele Scarabelli]]): Niece of Dominic Santini, Jo becomes both owner of Santini Air and custodian of Airwolf following the events of Season 4 episode \"Blackjack\".\n\n'''Jason Locke''' ([[Anthony Sherwood]]): Archangel's replacement as the Company agent who sends the Airwolf crew on their missions. Sometimes he even pilots Airwolf.\n\n==Production history==\n{{Main|List of Airwolf episodes}}\n{{original research|section|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe series ran for 55 episodes on [[CBS]] in the United States in 1984 through 1986, and an additional 24 episodes, with a new cast and production company, aired on the [[USA Network]] in 1987, for a total of 79 [[List of Airwolf episodes|episodes]]. A reedited version (produced in Germany) of the first episode was also released on home video in the UK and several countries; it received a theatrical release in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sqm2AAAAIAAJ&q=%22Care+Bears%22+-+ABC+network&dq=%22Care+Bears%22+-+ABC+network&hl=en|title=Emmy, Volume 8|author=Staff|year=1986|work=Emmy|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] (ATAS)|volume=8|page=20}}</ref> The show was broadcast in several international markets.

Bellisario first toyed with the idea of the adventures of an ace combat pilot in a third-season episode of ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' entitled \"Two Birds of a Feather\" (1983), starring [[William Lucking]], which itself was inspired by several episodes of Bellisario's ''[[Tales of the Gold Monkey]]''\u2014\"Legends Are Forever\" and \"Honor Thy Brother\" (1982)\u2014in which Lucking had played a similar character. The ''Magnum'' episode was intended as a [[Television pilot|backdoor pilot]], but a series was not commissioned. Bellisario heavily reworked the idea, and the final result was ''Airwolf''.\n\n===Seasons 2 and 3===\nTo improve [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], the studio wanted to add a regular female character and jettison the dark and moody tales of international espionage. This was accomplished at the start of the second season with the addition of Caitlin O'Shannessy ([[Jean Bruce Scott]]) and new stories that were domestic and more action-oriented. These changes proved unsuccessful, however, and while production costs remained high, creator Bellisario left both the studio and the series after Season 2. Bellisario's then-wife, Deborah Pratt, also left at that time (she was nearly three months pregnant with their daughter, [[Troian Bellisario|Troian]], as Season 2 drew to a close). Series star Jan-Michael Vincent's problems with alcoholism also contributed to the show's problems.<ref>Dangaard, Colin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tF0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA3&dq=%22Jan-Michael%20Vincent%22&pg=PA54#v=onepage&q=%22Jan-Michael%20Vincent%22&f=false \"Danger: Falling Idol\"], ''Los Angeles Magazine'', March 1997: 54\u201364</ref> Bernard Kowalski stepped in as executive producer for the third season, but the ratings remained low and the series was canceled by CBS.\n\n===Season 4===\nThe USA Network funded a fourth season in 1987, to be produced in Canada by [[Alliance Atlantis|Atlantis]] and The Arthur Company (owned by [[Arthur L. Annecharico]]) in association with [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]. This was intended to increase the number of episodes to make the show eligible for [[broadcast syndication]]. The original cast was written out of the fourth season: Jan-Michael Vincent appears in a first transitional episode; a body double for Ernest Borgnine seen only from the back represented Santini, who was killed off in an explosion; Archangel was said to have suddenly been assigned overseas. \"The Firm\" was replaced by \"the Company\"; no mention was made of Caitlin. St. John Hawke, played by [[Barry Van Dyke]], was suddenly revealed to be alive, having been working for many years as a deep undercover agent for American intelligence, contradicting characterizations in the previous three seasons. St. John replaced Stringfellow as the central character. Production moved to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada on a reduced budget that was less than one-third of the original CBS budget. The production crew no longer had access to the original ''Airwolf'' helicopter, and all in-flight shots were recycled from earlier seasons; the original full-size studio mockup was re-dressed and used for all interior shots. Actress [[Michele Scarabelli]], who played Jo Santini, said in a ''[[Starlog]]'' magazine interview that all 24 scripts were in place before the cast arrived, leaving the actors little room to develop their characters.\n\n==''Airwolf'' helicopter==\n{{Main|Airwolf (helicopter)}}\n\nThe flight-capable ''Airwolf'' helicopter was a cosmetically modified [[Bell 222]], serial number 47085, sometimes unofficially called a Bell 222A.<ref>Van Hoten, C: [http://wolfslair.airwolf.tv/issue03.html \"The Wolf's Lair, Issue 3, p. 6\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103024458/http://wolfslair.airwolf.tv/issue03.html |date=2008-01-03 }}.

The 73-minute soundtrack was created over a five-year period by a fan, [[Northern Ireland]]-based [[graphic designer]] Mark J. Cairns, in collaboration with original composer Levay, with a foreword by the series' creator, Bellisario.\n\nAfter the original CBS series was cancelled in 1986, Cairns headed the International Airwolf Appreciation Association for nearly 10 years (from 1988\u20131998). He decided in early 1994 to produce his own high-quality soundtrack for the series using the episodic scores from the three seasons of the series to create the first 22 synthesizer-based tracks on the soundtrack, including various medleys and character themes. Only one thousand copies were made.\n\nThe first digital download-only EP release, entitled 'Airwolf Main Themes' was made available in September 2009. It contains four tracks based on variations of the series' Main Theme and was a preview of the future Extended Themes release.\n\nA further 42-track, 146-minute, enhanced two-CD, limited-edition soundtrack album release called ''Airwolf Extended Themes'' (containing both a CD of the series' main theme variants, and a second CD of the episodic themes) was released on March 26, 2014. Bulgarian-Polish musician, Jan Michal Szulew, was the main arranger and orchestrator on the first CD, and Mark J. Cairns the arranger and overall producer of the second CD on this soundtrack. Two thousand copies were made.\n\n===Track listings===\n'''Airwolf Themes CD1 by Mark J.

These are a dual-language (English / German) release, plus, for the first time, either English or German subtitles are available. This release was significant as Universal Studios provided Koch Media with a new, HD print for season 1 episode, \"Bite Of The Jackal\", to cure the unintended cuts Universal had made of this episode on the Fabulous Films' earlier version of the print.

The program centers on a high-technology military [[helicopter]], code named  [[Airwolf (helicopter)|''Airwolf'']], and its crew as they undertake various exotic missions, many involving [[espionage]], with a [[Cold War]] theme.\n\nThe show was created by [[Donald P. Bellisario]] and was produced over four seasons. The first three seasons' main cast consisted of [[Jan-Michael Vincent]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], and [[Alex Cord]], and from the second season onwards [[Jean Bruce Scott]] was added as a regular. The show originally aired on [[CBS]] and after the original series was cancelled, a fourth season, with an entirely new cast and on a much smaller budget, was filmed in Canada for the [[USA Network]].\n\nThe show's distinctive musical score, which was originally orchestral, but shifted to more synthesizer-based arrangements early in the second season, was composed and mainly conducted by [[Sylvester Levay]]. Udi Harpaz conducted the scores for many later second- and third-season episodes.\n\n==Series synopsis==\n[[Image:Airwolf side.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bell 222]] as [[Airwolf (helicopter)|''Airwolf'']]]]\n\nThe fictional ''Airwolf'' is described as an advanced prototype [[Supersonic aircraft|supersonic helicopter]] with [[Stealth aircraft|stealth]] capabilities and a formidable arsenal, was designed by Charles Henry Moffet{{reference needed|date=May 2019}} ([[David Hemmings]])\u2014a genius with a psychopathic taste for torturing and killing women\u2014and built by \"the Firm\", a division of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (a play on the term \"the Company\", a nickname for the CIA). As the series begins, Moffet and his crew steal ''Airwolf'' during a live-fire weapons test. During the theft, Moffet opens fire on the Firm's bunker, killing a United States Senator and seriously injuring Firm deputy director Michael Coldsmith-Briggs III (code name \"Archangel\"). Moffet takes the gunship to [[Libya]], where he begins performing acts of aggression\u2014such as sinking an American [[destroyer]]\u2014as a service for [[Muammar Gaddafi]], who allows Moffet to keep ''Airwolf'' on Libyan soil.\n\nArchangel recruits the reclusive Stringfellow Hawke (Vincent), the chief [[test pilot]] during the development of ''Airwolf'', to recover the gunship. Archangel leaves his assistant Gabrielle Ademaur ([[Belinda Bauer (actress)|Belinda Bauer]])\u2014who becomes Hawke's love interest\u2014at Hawke's cabin to brief him for his mission. A week later, after an undercover operative in Libya is killed in the line of duty, Gabrielle is sent in undercover and Hawke is sent in sooner than originally planned. With the assistance of pilot and father figure Dominic Santini (Borgnine), Hawke finds and recovers Airwolf, but Gabrielle is tortured and killed by Moffet. Hawke obliterates Moffet with a hail of missiles from Airwolf before returning to the United States. Instead of returning the gunship, Hawke and Santini booby-trap Airwolf and hide it in \"the Lair\", a large natural cave in the remote \"Valley of the Gods\" (visually modeled on [[Monument Valley]]). Hawke refuses to return Airwolf until the Firm can find and recover his brother, St. John ([[Christopher Connelly]]), who has been [[missing in action]] since the [[Vietnam War]]. To obtain access to ''Airwolf'', Archangel offers Hawke protection from other government agencies who might try to recover ''Airwolf''; in return, Hawke and Santini must fly missions of national importance for the Firm.\n\nThe Firm, during the first three seasons, served as both ally and enemy for Hawke and Santini; when an opportunity to seize ''Airwolf'' presented itself, Firm operatives often took it. The first season of the series was dark, arc driven, and quite reflective of the contemporary Cold War, with the Firm personnel distinctly dressed in white, implicitly boasting that \"wearing [[black and white hat symbolism in film|white hats]]\" distinguished them as good instead of evil. Hawke remained unconvinced, and Santini was skeptical, also; this was explained in the season-one episode \"Daddy's Gone a Hunt'n\". Early episodes frequently detailed the efforts of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] to recover ''Airwolf'' from Hawke, who is officially charged with having stolen it. Because CBS wanted to make the series more family oriented, the program was transformed during season two into a more light-hearted show, with Hawke and Santini portrayed as cooperative partners with the Firm. This persisted into the fourth season with the newly introduced \"Company\" and the new crew of ''Airwolf''.\n\n===Cast===\n{{overly detailed|section|date=April 2016}}\n\n====Seasons 1 through 3====\n\n'''Stringfellow \"String\" Hawke''' ([[Jan-Michael Vincent]]): When Stringfellow Hawke was ten,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/airwolf/watch/random-target-37825/|title=Watch Airwolf - Random Target Online - TV.com|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=TV.com}}</ref> he and his parents were involved in a boating accident. He was rescued by his brother St John, but their parents drowned. After the death of his parents and the subsequent death of his girlfriend in a car crash, Stringfellow grew to believe that anyone he loved was destined to die tragically. In a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] mission during the [[Vietnam War]], Stringfellow was separated from St. John; Stringfellow was rescued, but St. John was not. St. John was subsequently listed as [[Missing in action|M.I.A.]], causing Stringfellow to further withdraw from society. Stringfellow had a [[Master's degree]] in [[applied physics]] and, while often hot tempered, could be pragmatic. An avid fisherman, Stringfellow ate fish, but refused to eat red meat; he also refused to wear underwear. Stringfellow lived in seclusion in a log cabin by [[Lake Hemet]] (outside [[Los Angeles]]) with his [[Bluetick Coonhound]] \"Tet\" (named after the 1968 [[Communism|communist]] [[Tet Offensive]]), where he serenaded eagles on his priceless [[Stradivarius]] [[cello]]. Hawke had a remarkable collection of rare paintings, which his grandfather collected for his grandmother.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">From \"Shadow of the Hawke\", Season 1, Episode 1</ref>\n\nIn 1982, Stringfellow served as a test pilot for Airwolf during its development program. As he was one of several pilots to fly Airwolf, the Firm recruited him to recover Airwolf after its designer, Doctor Charles Henry Moffet, absconded with it and took it to [[Libya]]. With the assistance of Dominic Santini, Hawke recovered Airwolf. Upon returning to the United States, the Firm failed to provide Stringfellow with new information regarding St. John. In retaliation, Hawke and Santini hid Airwolf, vowing not to return it until St. John was found. In return for protection from the government, Stringfellow piloted Airwolf on national security missions for the Firm.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In the first episode of Season 4, Stringfellow was gravely wounded by an explosion, but was carried from the hospital (with an unknown outcome) by his recently returned brother, St. John.<ref>From \"Blackjack\", Season 4, Episode 1</ref>\n\n'''Dominic \"Dom\" Santini''' ([[Ernest Borgnine]]): Santini was born and raised on the fictional [[Caribbean]] island nation of San Remo. Santini was of [[Italian Americans|Italian-American]] descent and was [[multilingualism|bilingual]], speaking both English and Italian fluently.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> A ladies' man in his youth, Dominic was forced to marry Lila\u2014a young woman from a wealthy family\u2014when she falsely claimed to be carrying his child (she would not truly become pregnant until years after their marriage). Though Lila left Dominic and took their daughter, Sally Ann, when Sally was 7, Dominic always kept his cottage in San Remo in the hope that Sally would return. Sally Ann followed a \"[[jet set]]\" existence focused on the casino in San Remo; Lila used Sally to provide her with male companionship. Sally Ann Santini died of a drug overdose in 1984, which devastated Dominic. Weeks later, Lila was murdered by San Remo's criminal element while attempting to blackmail the owner of San Remo's casino; when Dominic was arrested for her murder, Stringfellow helped bring the guilty parties to justice and used Airwolf to destroy the casino.<ref>From \"Sins of the Past\", Season 2, Episode 6</ref> Santini's other known relatives include his younger brother Tony Santini and Tony's daughter (Dominic's niece) Jo Santini, who becomes an important supporting character on the series during its fourth and final season. Dominic also has another niece, Holly Mathews, who suffers from a delusional emotional illness and nearly causes a disaster for her uncle and his friends during the Season 2 episode \"The Truth About Holly.\"\n\nSantini was a veteran of [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]], serving as a combat aviator for the [[U.S. Army]] in both conflicts. During his wartime experiences, Santini became a good friend of fellow American military aviator Alan B. Hawke. After Hawke and his wife were killed in a boating accident, Santini raised the Hawkes' two young sons. After St John Hawke went [[missing in action]] during the [[Vietnam War]], Santini and Stringfellow Hawke dedicated themselves to the operation of Santini Air, a [[Van Nuys]], [[California]]-based air charter service founded and owned by Santini that specializes in performing aerial stunts for [[Hollywood]] film productions.\n\nSantini served as flight engineer on Airwolf, with Stringfellow as pilot and aircraft commander. When necessary, Santini would also occasionally take Hawke's place as Airwolf's pilot. Santini had great admiration and fondness for the elegant and sleek espionage aircraft, which he affectionately dubbed \"the Lady\". He harbored a distrust of the Firm, especially its deputy director Michael Coldsmith-Briggs III, who was codenamed \"Archangel\" but whom Santini derisively termed \"[[Mister Clean]]\".\n\nIn 1987, in the first episode of Season 4, Dominic was killed in the same helicopter explosion that also severely injured Stringfellow Hawke. This explosion was caused by an act of sabotage by Santini's and Hawke's enemies.\n\n'''Michael Coldsmith-Briggs III''' ([[Alex Cord]]): Codenamed \"Archangel\", Coldsmith-Briggs was the Firm's [[Take point|point man]] on the Airwolf project. He was present at the weapons test where Moffet stole Airwolf and used the gunship's weaponry to destroy the Firm's bunker. As a result of the attack, Archangel suffered injuries to his left arm and leg, and lost the sight in his left eye (which he usually covered with either a black eyeglass lens or a white patch). His leg injuries left him with a limp, for which he used a silver-handled cane. Archangel routinely wore white three-piece suits with a white tie and a white [[Panama hat]], which was a standard uniform for operatives of the Firm.\n\nArchangel recruited Stringfellow to recapture Airwolf, seizing Stringfellow's art collection (allegedly at the insistence of the Firm) to ensure his participation. After Stringfellow refused to return Airwolf, Archangel brokered a deal by which he would provide government assistance for Airwolf (and Stringfellow's quest to find St. John) in exchange for the use of Airwolf on missions of national importance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Though he was usually the man dispatching Airwolf on missions, Archangel occasionally served as flight engineer on Airwolf.<ref>First occurred during \"Bite of the Jackal\", Season 1, Episode 3</ref>\n\nIn the first two seasons, Archangel was often assisted by Marella ([[Deborah Pratt]]). She had doctorates in [[Aeronautical Engineering]], [[Electronic Engineering]], [[Psychology]], [[Microbiology]], and [[French Literature]], and was one year away from completing her [[Doctor of Medicine|Medical Doctorate]] as of the episode \"Fallen Angel.\" Marella was last seen in the final episode of Season 2, \"Short Walk to Freedom\"; in Season 3, she was replaced by a series of minor characters. In 1987, at the beginning of Season 4, Archangel was suddenly (and unexpectedly) reassigned to the [[Middle East]], and was not mentioned for the remainder of the series.\n\n'''Caitlin O'Shannessy''' ([[Jean Bruce Scott]]): A helicopter pilot for the [[Texas Highway Patrol]], Caitlin first crossed paths with Airwolf when the gunship prevented her from being assaulted by four [[redneck]]s during the events of the Season 2 episode \"Sweet Britches\". After saving Stringfellow from a corrupt sheriff (and, in turn, being saved by Airwolf from being assaulted again), Caitlin tracked Stringfellow to Santini Air. Santini hired Caitlin, who had left the Highway Patrol, as a pilot for Santini Air. After initially covering up the existence of Airwolf, the events of Season 2 episode \"Fallen Angel\" resulted in her being added to the Airwolf crew, serving as either a pilot or flight engineer (as the situation required). Caitlin was never mentioned in Season 4.\n\n====Season 4====\n'''St. John Hawke''' ([[Barry Van Dyke]]): Brother of Stringfellow, and raised by Santini after the death of his parents. Van Dyke took over the role from Christopher Connelly, who portrayed the character in early CBS episodes. Santini taught both Stringfellow and St. John how to fly, and both brothers showed particular talent as [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] aviators during the Vietnam War. In 1969, St. John was separated from Stringfellow and the rest of his unit during a mission. He would remain missing in action for the next 18 years, until he was suddenly located in a deep-cover CIA mission in 1987. Returning to the United States, he reunited with Stringfellow and, due to his brother's injuries, took over as pilot of Airwolf.\n\n'''Major Mike Rivers''' ([[Geraint Wyn Davies]]): Air Force Major tasked with locating Airwolf during the season 4 episode \"Blackjack.\"\n\n'''Jo Santini''' ([[Michele Scarabelli]]): Niece of Dominic Santini, Jo becomes both owner of Santini Air and custodian of Airwolf following the events of Season 4 episode \"Blackjack\".\n\n'''Jason Locke''' ([[Anthony Sherwood]]): Archangel's replacement as the Company agent who sends the Airwolf crew on their missions. Sometimes he even pilots Airwolf.\n\n==Production history==\n{{Main|List of Airwolf episodes}}\n{{original research|section|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe series ran for 55 episodes on [[CBS]] in the United States in 1984 through 1986, and an additional 24 episodes, with a new cast and production company, aired on the [[USA Network]] in 1987, for a total of 79 [[List of Airwolf episodes|episodes]]. A reedited version (produced in Germany) of the first episode was also released on home video in the UK and several countries; it received a theatrical release in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sqm2AAAAIAAJ&q=%22Care+Bears%22+-+ABC+network&dq=%22Care+Bears%22+-+ABC+network&hl=en|title=Emmy, Volume 8|author=Staff|year=1986|work=Emmy|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] (ATAS)|volume=8|page=20}}</ref> The show was broadcast in several international markets.

Bellisario first toyed with the idea of the adventures of an ace combat pilot in a third-season episode of ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' entitled \"Two Birds of a Feather\" (1983), starring [[William Lucking]], which itself was inspired by several episodes of Bellisario's ''[[Tales of the Gold Monkey]]''\u2014\"Legends Are Forever\" and \"Honor Thy Brother\" (1982)\u2014in which Lucking had played a similar character. The ''Magnum'' episode was intended as a [[Television pilot|backdoor pilot]], but a series was not commissioned. Bellisario heavily reworked the idea, and the final result was ''Airwolf''.\n\n===Seasons 2 and 3===\nTo improve [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], the studio wanted to add a regular female character and jettison the dark and moody tales of international espionage. This was accomplished at the start of the second season with the addition of Caitlin O'Shannessy ([[Jean Bruce Scott]]) and new stories that were domestic and more action-oriented. These changes proved unsuccessful, however, and while production costs remained high, creator Bellisario left both the studio and the series after Season 2. Bellisario's then-wife, Deborah Pratt, also left at that time (she was nearly three months pregnant with their daughter, [[Troian Bellisario|Troian]], as Season 2 drew to a close). Series star Jan-Michael Vincent's problems with alcoholism also contributed to the show's problems.<ref>Dangaard, Colin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tF0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA3&dq=%22Jan-Michael%20Vincent%22&pg=PA54#v=onepage&q=%22Jan-Michael%20Vincent%22&f=false \"Danger: Falling Idol\"], ''Los Angeles Magazine'', March 1997: 54\u201364</ref> Bernard Kowalski stepped in as executive producer for the third season, but the ratings remained low and the series was canceled by CBS.\n\n===Season 4===\nThe USA Network funded a fourth season in 1987, to be produced in Canada by [[Alliance Atlantis|Atlantis]] and The Arthur Company (owned by [[Arthur L. Annecharico]]) in association with [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]. This was intended to increase the number of episodes to make the show eligible for [[broadcast syndication]]. The original cast was written out of the fourth season: Jan-Michael Vincent appears in a first transitional episode; a body double for Ernest Borgnine seen only from the back represented Santini, who was killed off in an explosion; Archangel was said to have suddenly been assigned overseas. \"The Firm\" was replaced by \"the Company\"; no mention was made of Caitlin. St. John Hawke, played by [[Barry Van Dyke]], was suddenly revealed to be alive, having been working for many years as a deep undercover agent for American intelligence, contradicting characterizations in the previous three seasons. St. John replaced Stringfellow as the central character. Production moved to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada on a reduced budget that was less than one-third of the original CBS budget. The production crew no longer had access to the original ''Airwolf'' helicopter, and all in-flight shots were recycled from earlier seasons; the original full-size studio mockup was re-dressed and used for all interior shots. Actress [[Michele Scarabelli]], who played Jo Santini, said in a ''[[Starlog]]'' magazine interview that all 24 scripts were in place before the cast arrived, leaving the actors little room to develop their characters.\n\n==''Airwolf'' helicopter==\n{{Main|Airwolf (helicopter)}}\n\nThe flight-capable ''Airwolf'' helicopter was a cosmetically modified [[Bell 222]], serial number 47085, sometimes unofficially called a Bell 222A.<ref>Van Hoten, C: [http://wolfslair.airwolf.tv/issue03.html \"The Wolf's Lair, Issue 3, p. 6\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103024458/http://wolfslair.airwolf.tv/issue03.html |date=2008-01-03 }}.

The 73-minute soundtrack was created over a five-year period by a fan, [[Northern Ireland]]-based [[graphic designer]] Mark J. Cairns, in collaboration with original composer Levay, with a foreword by the series' creator, Bellisario.\n\nAfter the original CBS series was cancelled in 1986, Cairns headed the International Airwolf Appreciation Association for nearly 10 years (from 1988\u20131998). He decided in early 1994 to produce his own high-quality soundtrack for the series using the episodic scores from the three seasons of the series to create the first 22 synthesizer-based tracks on the soundtrack, including various medleys and character themes. Only one thousand copies were made.\n\nThe first digital download-only EP release, entitled 'Airwolf Main Themes' was made available in September 2009. It contains four tracks based on variations of the series' Main Theme and was a preview of the future Extended Themes release.\n\nA further 42-track, 146-minute, enhanced two-CD, limited-edition soundtrack album release called ''Airwolf Extended Themes'' (containing both a CD of the series' main theme variants, and a second CD of the episodic themes) was released on March 26, 2014. Bulgarian-Polish musician, Jan Michal Szulew, was the main arranger and orchestrator on the first CD, and Mark J. Cairns the arranger and overall producer of the second CD on this soundtrack. Two thousand copies were made.\n\n===Track listings===\n'''Airwolf Themes CD1 by Mark J.

The club's formation came about when a group of forty people, with a common vision, met and set the foundations for creating a football club that would represent the [[Greeks|Greek]] residents of the [[Nicosia|capital]] and express their deep desire for Cyprus' incorporation ([[enosis]]) into Greece. The meeting took place at a traditional confectionery, owned by Charalambos Hadjioannou, downtown in [[Ledra Street]] and the first president of the club was Giorgos Poulias.<ref name=\"apoelfc_history1\" /> The first clubhouse was the \"Athenians Club\" ({{lang|el|\u039b\u03ad\u03c3\u03c7\u03b7 \u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd}}) at the end of Ledra Street.<ref name=\"apoelfc_history1\" />\n\nAfter a journey to the football club in [[Alexandria]], Egypt in 1927 the General Assembly of 1928 decided the players showed that they were not just good footballers but also excellent track and field athletes. Hence it was decided to create a track and field team in addition to the football team. The name APOEL was adopted to reflect this, with the 'A' standing for 'Athletic'. Soon after a volleyball team and a table tennis team were established.\n\n===The 1930s : The first league titles===\nCyprus did not have any country-wide league until 1932. Football clubs of the time played friendly matches only. In 1932, [[Pezoporikos Larnaca]] organised an unofficial league, the first island-wide league, and it was won by APOEL after defeating [[AEL Limassol]] in the final by 4\u20130. In 1934, there was a disagreement between [[Enosis Neon Trust|Trust]] and [[Anorthosis Famagusta FC|Anorthosis Famagusta]] on the organisation of the fourth unofficial league. APOEL and [[AEL Limassol]] organised a meeting for the foundation of a country-wide governing body and an official country-wide league. The meeting took place in APOEL's clubhouse on 23 September and the establishment of the [[Cyprus Football Association]] was agreed. Two years later the APOEL football team celebrated its first [[Cypriot First Division|championship]] title of the official [[Cyprus football league system|Cyprus football league]]. APOEL also won the championship for the following four years, making this a very successful period for the club with 5 consecutive [[Cypriot First Division|championships]] (1936\u20131940).<ref name=\"apoelfc_history1\" />\n\n===The 1948 conflicts===\nPolitics, however, would soon spark conflict within the team. On 23 May 1948 the board of the club send a telegram to the [[Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics]] ({{lang-el|\u03a3.\u0395.\u0393.\u0391.\u03a3.}}), with the opportunity of the annual Panhellenic Track and Field Competition, which included wishes that \"the rebellion\" is finished. Several leftist club members perceived the telegram as a political comment on the [[Greek Civil War]] and they distanced themselves from the club.<ref name=\"1948events\">{{cite web|url=http://www.apoel.net/apoel2/history/1948.shtml |publisher=apoel.net |script-title=el:\u03a4\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 1948 |accessdate=25 March 2014 |language=Greek |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428122249/http://apoel.net/apoel2/history/1948.shtml |archivedate=28 April 2014 }}</ref> A few days later, on 4 June 1948, they founded [[AC Omonia]], which until today is the archrival of APOEL and there has been a traditional animosity between the fans of the two teams.<ref name=\"1948events\" />\n\n===1955\u201359 period===\nMore conflicts led to further struggles for APOEL. Athletes belonging to the club frequently participated in national clashes. During the 1955\u201359 national uprising against the British, many of APOEL's athletes and members of the club were active members of [[EOKA]] (the National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters), the most outstanding example being the club's track and field athlete [[Michalis Karaolis|Michalakis Karaolis]] who was hanged by the British colonial authorities. During this period the football team had their closest brush with relegation as most football players were actively taking part in the national struggle.\n\n===Triumph in the 1963\u201364 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup===\nThe football team were quickly back to full strength and made their debut in European Competitions (the first not only for APOEL but for any Cypriot team) in 1963, when they faced the [[Norway|Norwegian]] team [[SK Gj\u00f8vik-Lyn]] in the [[1963\u201364 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]]. Two victories for APOEL over both legs (6\u20130, 1\u20130) marked APOEL's successful European debut, as they became the first [[Greece|Hellenic]] team to progress in a European Competition. The next round against the tournament winners [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] met APOEL with their heaviest defeat ever (16\u20131) and put an end to APOEL's European debut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apoelfc.com.cy/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=9121&tt=graphic&lang=l1|publisher=APOEL FC|script-title=el:\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 1960&nbsp;\u2013 1970|language=Greek|date=|accessdate=25 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===The successful participation in pan-Hellenic Greek Championship===\nOther triumphs followed in the early 1970s.

The rivalry is also indicative of social, cultural and political differences and originates from 1948 when the board of APOEL sent a telegram to the [[Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics]] (Greek: \u03a3.\u0395.\u0393.\u0391.\u03a3.), with the opportunity of the annual Panhellenic Track and Field Competition stating its wish for the \"communist mutiny\" to be ended.

The club's formation came about when a group of forty people, with a common vision, met and set the foundations for creating a football club that would represent the [[Greeks|Greek]] residents of the [[Nicosia|capital]] and express their deep desire for Cyprus' incorporation ([[enosis]]) into Greece. The meeting took place at a traditional confectionery, owned by Charalambos Hadjioannou, downtown in [[Ledra Street]] and the first president of the club was Giorgos Poulias.<ref name=\"apoelfc_history1\" /> The first clubhouse was the \"Athenians Club\" ({{lang|el|\u039b\u03ad\u03c3\u03c7\u03b7 \u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd}}) at the end of Ledra Street.<ref name=\"apoelfc_history1\" />\n\nAfter a journey to the football club in [[Alexandria]], Egypt in 1927 the General Assembly of 1928 decided the players showed that they were not just good footballers but also excellent track and field athletes. Hence it was decided to create a track and field team in addition to the football team. The name APOEL was adopted to reflect this, with the 'A' standing for 'Athletic'. Soon after a volleyball team and a table tennis team were established.\n\n===The 1930s : The first league titles===\nCyprus did not have any country-wide league until 1932. Football clubs of the time played friendly matches only. In 1932, [[Pezoporikos Larnaca]] organised an unofficial league, the first island-wide league, and it was won by APOEL after defeating [[AEL Limassol]] in the final by 4\u20130. In 1934, there was a disagreement between [[Enosis Neon Trust|Trust]] and [[Anorthosis Famagusta FC|Anorthosis Famagusta]] on the organisation of the fourth unofficial league. APOEL and [[AEL Limassol]] organised a meeting for the foundation of a country-wide governing body and an official country-wide league. The meeting took place in APOEL's clubhouse on 23 September and the establishment of the [[Cyprus Football Association]] was agreed. Two years later the APOEL football team celebrated its first [[Cypriot First Division|championship]] title of the official [[Cyprus football league system|Cyprus football league]]. APOEL also won the championship for the following four years, making this a very successful period for the club with 5 consecutive [[Cypriot First Division|championships]] (1936\u20131940).<ref name=\"apoelfc_history1\" />\n\n===The 1948 conflicts===\nPolitics, however, would soon spark conflict within the team. On 23 May 1948 the board of the club send a telegram to the [[Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics]] ({{lang-el|\u03a3.\u0395.\u0393.\u0391.\u03a3.}}), with the opportunity of the annual Panhellenic Track and Field Competition, which included wishes that \"the rebellion\" is finished.

Athletes belonging to the club frequently participated in national clashes. During the 1955\u201359 national uprising against the British, many of APOEL's athletes and members of the club were active members of [[EOKA]] (the National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters), the most outstanding example being the club's track and field athlete [[Michalis Karaolis|Michalakis Karaolis]] who was hanged by the British colonial authorities. During this period the football team had their closest brush with relegation as most football players were actively taking part in the national struggle.\n\n===Triumph in the 1963\u201364 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup===\nThe football team were quickly back to full strength and made their debut in European Competitions (the first not only for APOEL but for any Cypriot team) in 1963, when they faced the [[Norway|Norwegian]] team [[SK Gj\u00f8vik-Lyn]] in the [[1963\u201364 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]]. Two victories for APOEL over both legs (6\u20130, 1\u20130) marked APOEL's successful European debut, as they became the first [[Greece|Hellenic]] team to progress in a European Competition. The next round against the tournament winners [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] met APOEL with their heaviest defeat ever (16\u20131) and put an end to APOEL's European debut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apoelfc.com.cy/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=9121&tt=graphic&lang=l1|publisher=APOEL FC|script-title=el:\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 1960&nbsp;\u2013 1970|language=Greek|date=|accessdate=25 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===The successful participation in pan-Hellenic Greek Championship===\nOther triumphs followed in the early 1970s.

In 1986 APOEL was drawn against [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.]] for the second round of the [[1986\u201387 European Cup|European Cup]]. This was the first time that a Cypriot team faced a Turkish team in a European football competition.
