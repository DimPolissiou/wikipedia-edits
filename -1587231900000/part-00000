''Ichhenodi'' basically revolves around a story of two sisters, Meghla and Adrija, and how they entangle themselves in a relationship with their love interest, Anurag.\n\nMeghla, who finds the essence of her life in music, is fond of her elder sister Adrija, and loves her above anyone else. The sisters get caught up in a love triangle making their life go upside down. Meghla is proud of her elder sister Adrija as she is a smart, beautiful girl, who is a topper as well when it comes to study. However, Adrija despises her since childhood and hates her after she comes to know that Meghla is not her own sister but adopted. Adrija begins to love Anurag madly but Anurag falls in love with the simple and docile Meghla, and her passion for music. Meghla refuses him and tries to convince him to marry Adrija but circumstances compel them to marry each other. Adrija creates many misunderstandings to destroy the marital life of Meghla and Anurag, but their love conquers every time. Adrija even goes to the extent of trying to kill Meghla on many occasions, but in vain. In frustration, she pushes Anurag from a cliff, who is then saved by Tua, also a passionate singer. Anurag loses his memory in the accident and is named \"Vikram\" by Tua and her family. Tua starts loving Vikram, without knowing his past. Adrija now marries Piklu, Anurag's cousin and enters his family to torture Meghla and makes her life hell by instigating Malobika against her, rendering Meghla responsible for Anurag's supposed death and portrays Meghla as a cheap and characterless girl in the eyes of the family members. A distraught and lonely Meghla finds solace in music and is pacified by her ''Guru Maa'', who turns out to be her own biological mother. She soon finds out that Anurag is alive and after many obstacles, they finally reunite (as Anurag's memory returns). Tua along with her aunt, Shariah then join forces with Adrija to separate Meghla from Anurag. They file a case against Anurag, accusing him of deceit and [[polygamy]], but they fail due to the intervention of Adv. Shubhalakshmi, an experienced lawyer. Meghla also helps her to mend her broken relationship with her estranged husband, Adv. Anweshan. Meghla, who now despises Adrija from the core, exposes all her crimes and gets her arrested. Shattered and ashamed of her deeds, Tua changes herself and becomes a loyal confidante to Meghla, despite Anurag's initial reluctance. Adrija flees from police custody and takes the alias of \"Mallika Dasgupta\" to hide herself from the public eye. Deep Dasgupta, husband of the real Mallika (who is now dead), promises to help Adrija without knowledge of her true intentions. Soon Meghla gets pregnant and everyone in the family become happy. But their happiness is short-lived as Adrija kills Meghla's unborn baby. A devastated Anurag blames Meghla for everything and asks for a separation. Meghla, unable to bear Anurag's indifference, files for divorce, and soon, their divorce happens. Meghla restarts her singing career, while Deep helps to get Adrija arrested. Anurag decides to move to [[U.S.A]]. and spends a night with Meghla before his departure. Meghla gets pregnant again but decides to tell nobody about her prospective baby.\n\n===2 Years Later===\nA widowed Malobika misses Anurag and Meghla's presence in the family. Mimi, Anurag's elder cousin sister, returns home, as she promised to Anurag to take over the responsibilities of the Banerjee family in his absence, and also becomes a strong emotional support to Meghla. Meghla, who is now a famous playback singer, raises her son (with Anurag), namely ''Roddur'' single-handedly. Adrija returns in Piklu's life after her release from jail and consequent, change in disposition. She soon becomes pregnant and transforms into a good-hearted person who cares for Piklu and his family. She restores love her towards Meghla and like others, also wants Meghla and Anurag's reunion. Anurag becomes a famous playback singer known as \"AB\" in order to get close to Meghla. Lastly, Mimi and Sanjoy, ''Pagla Ghora'' (Anurag's uncle) and Shabnam get married. Meghla and Anurag too finally reunite and take care of the family and ''Roddur'' together.

Prior to 1987, it was assumed that the [[Lanterman\u2013Petris\u2013Short Act]] allowed involuntary treatment for those who were detained under an initial three-day hold (for evaluation and treatment) and a subsequent fourteen-day hospitalization (for those patients declared after the three-day hold to be dangerous to themselves or others or gravely disabled). In 1987, in ''Riese v. St. Mary's Hospital and Medical Center'', the California State Court of Appeals declared that these patients had the right to exercise informed consent regarding the use of antipsychotic drugs, except in an emergency, and if they rejected medication \"a judicial determination of their incapacity to make treatment decisions\" was required before they could be involuntarily treated.<ref name=\"mentalillnesspolicy1\">{{cite web|url=https://mentalillnesspolicy.org/legal/involuntary-medication-riese-st-marys.html |title=Involuntary medications: Riese v.

Prior to 1987, it was assumed that the [[Lanterman\u2013Petris\u2013Short Act]] allowed involuntary treatment for those who were detained under an initial three-day hold (for evaluation and treatment) and a subsequent fourteen-day hospitalization (for those patients declared after the three-day hold to be dangerous to themselves or others or gravely disabled). In 1987, in ''Riese v. St. Mary's Hospital and Medical Center'', the California State Court of Appeals declared that these patients had the right to exercise informed consent regarding the use of antipsychotic drugs, except in an emergency, and if they rejected medication \"a judicial determination of their incapacity to make treatment decisions\" was required before they could be involuntarily treated.<ref name=\"mentalillnesspolicy1\">{{cite web|url=https://mentalillnesspolicy.org/legal/involuntary-medication-riese-st-marys.html |title=Involuntary medications: Riese v.

This allowed the group members greater freedom to focus on different elements of their careers, and gave the group opportunities to explore different musical styles and showcase different skills.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} Sina.com.

The Stanley first opened as a [[movie theater|movie theatre]] in December 1930, and showed movies for over sixty years before falling revenues led to its closure in 1991. After years of threatened commercial redevelopment, the Stanley was renovated as a stage theatre in 1997\u20131998 and subsequently awarded status as a heritage building.\n\nAs a stage for the Arts Club, the Stanley has been used to put on classics, Broadway musicals and other large productions, including ''[[Swing!]]'',  ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', ''[[Miss Saigon]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Disney's Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[White Christmas (musical)|Irving Berlin's White Christmas]]''. The theatre, which went through major fundraising to finance its renovations and mortgage, at one stage lost its sponsor [[du Maurier (cigarette)|du Maurier]] due to tobacco regulations, but in 2005 received new sponsorship from [[Industrial Alliance|Industrial Alliance Pacific Life Insurance Company]] and the theatre's name was changed to the Stanley Industrial Alliance Stage.\n\n==Movie theatre==\nThe Stanley opened on December 15, 1930.<ref name=cte>{{harvnb|Gilligan}}</ref> Originally envisioned as a [[vaudeville]] venue,<ref name=bump>{{harvnb|Mathison|2006}}</ref> it was built by Frederick Guest, owner of a chain of theatres in [[Ontario]], who reportedly fell in love with Vancouver and decided to build his dream theatre there.<ref name=bump/><ref name=southgranville100>{{harvnb|Celebrating Our History: The Stanley Theatre\u2014South Granville's Beating Heart|p=3}}</ref> He hired Henry Holdsby Simmonds as the architect,<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=cclerk960730>{{harvnb|Policy Report Development and Building: Proposed Rezoning of 2750 Granville Street (Stanley Theatre)}}</ref> who designed it with a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] interior and an [[Art Deco]] exterior,<ref name=inwood>{{harvnb|Inwood|1998|pp=B1\u2013B2}}</ref> with seating for 1,216 people.<ref name=inwood/> In order to make as high quality a theatre as possible, Simmonds used only the best materials he could find, including tindle stone from [[Winnipeg]] and tiles from [[Italy]], along with chandeliers, carpets and furnishings from local merchants.<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=inwood/> Like the [[Stanley Cup]] and [[Stanley Park]], the theatre was named after [[Governor General of Canada]] [[Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]].<ref name=bump/>\n\nThe first film shown at the Stanley was ''[[One Romantic Night]]'', starring [[Lillian Gish]].<ref name=cte/><ref>{{harvnb|Grand Opening Tonight at 5 p.m. of the Stanley Theatre (advertisement)|p=12}}</ref> Admission was originally between 10 and 40 cents.<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=inwood/> The vertical Stanley sign was added in 1940 and the stylized Stanley script came in 1957.<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=inwood/> The cinema, which had been part of the Granville Theatre Company,<ref name=cclerk960730/> was bought by [[Famous Players]] in 1941 for $268,000.<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=inwood/>\n\nThe Stanley was originally built as a neighbourhood theatre, but gradually became more popular and attracted moviegoers from throughout the Vancouver region.<ref name=cclerk960730/> From the 1950s onwards, progressively improved sound and projection systems along with refurbished seating added to the theatre's appeal.<ref name=southgranville100/> On July 8, 1954 the Stanley began showing films in [[stereophonic]] [[CinemaScope]] for the first time.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanley Theatre Previews CinemaScope Tonite!

the lobby, reconfiguration of the balcony, an expansion of the stage to twice its original size, a new twenty-five metre fly tower from which to raise and lower scenery, new dressing rooms, a trap room, an electrical room and a green room backstage, a reduction of the number of seats from 1,216 to 650, a crush bar in the old projection booth, a section cut out of the theatre's dome to use for spotlights, and a full restoration of the theatre's [[Metal leaf|gold-leafed]] plaster decorations.<ref name=inwood/><ref name=totallighting>{{harvnb|The Stanley Theatre, Vancouver, BC (Total Lighting

The Stanley first opened as a [[movie theater|movie theatre]] in December 1930, and showed movies for over sixty years before falling revenues led to its closure in 1991. After years of threatened commercial redevelopment, the Stanley was renovated as a stage theatre in 1997\u20131998 and subsequently awarded status as a heritage building.\n\nAs a stage for the Arts Club, the Stanley has been used to put on classics, Broadway musicals and other large productions, including ''[[Swing!]]'',  ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', ''[[Miss Saigon]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Disney's Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[White Christmas (musical)|Irving Berlin's White Christmas]]''. The theatre, which went through major fundraising to finance its renovations and mortgage, at one stage lost its sponsor [[du Maurier (cigarette)|du Maurier]] due to tobacco regulations, but in 2005 received new sponsorship from [[Industrial Alliance|Industrial Alliance Pacific Life Insurance Company]] and the theatre's name was changed to the Stanley Industrial Alliance Stage.\n\n==Movie theatre==\nThe Stanley opened on December 15, 1930.<ref name=cte>{{harvnb|Gilligan}}</ref> Originally envisioned as a [[vaudeville]] venue,<ref name=bump>{{harvnb|Mathison|2006}}</ref> it was built by Frederick Guest, owner of a chain of theatres in [[Ontario]], who reportedly fell in love with Vancouver and decided to build his dream theatre there.<ref name=bump/><ref name=southgranville100>{{harvnb|Celebrating Our History: The Stanley Theatre\u2014South Granville's Beating Heart|p=3}}</ref> He hired Henry Holdsby Simmonds as the architect,<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=cclerk960730>{{harvnb|Policy Report Development and Building: Proposed Rezoning of 2750 Granville Street (Stanley Theatre)}}</ref> who designed it with a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] interior and an [[Art Deco]] exterior,<ref name=inwood>{{harvnb|Inwood|1998|pp=B1\u2013B2}}</ref> with seating for 1,216 people.<ref name=inwood/> In order to make as high quality a theatre as possible, Simmonds used only the best materials he could find, including tindle stone from [[Winnipeg]] and tiles from [[Italy]], along with chandeliers, carpets and furnishings from local merchants.<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=inwood/> Like the [[Stanley Cup]] and [[Stanley Park]], the theatre was named after [[Governor General of Canada]] [[Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]].<ref name=bump/>\n\nThe first film shown at the Stanley was ''[[One Romantic Night]]'', starring [[Lillian Gish]].<ref name=cte/><ref>{{harvnb|Grand Opening Tonight at 5 p.m. of the Stanley Theatre (advertisement)|p=12}}</ref> Admission was originally between 10 and 40 cents.<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=inwood/> The vertical Stanley sign was added in 1940 and the stylized Stanley script came in 1957.<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=inwood/> The cinema, which had been part of the Granville Theatre Company,<ref name=cclerk960730/> was bought by [[Famous Players]] in 1941 for $268,000.<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=inwood/>\n\nThe Stanley was originally built as a neighbourhood theatre, but gradually became more popular and attracted moviegoers from throughout the Vancouver region.<ref name=cclerk960730/> From the 1950s onwards, progressively improved sound and projection systems along with refurbished seating added to the theatre's appeal.<ref name=southgranville100/> On July 8, 1954 the Stanley began showing films in [[stereophonic]] [[CinemaScope]] for the first time.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanley Theatre Previews CinemaScope Tonite!

movie theatre.<ref name=aird/><ref>{{harvnb|Kalmon}}</ref> In the months leading up to the Stanley's closure, Famous Players had a conditional sale agreement for the theatre with Vancouver developer Sandy Cox, who was planning to keep the Stanley's facade and convert the interior into retail space.<ref name=aird/> The Vancouver City Council received a proposal to change the building to retail use, which it approved, but the planned development was abandoned, and the building remained vacant for several years.<ref name=cclerk960730/> During the early 1990s, a \"Save Our Stanley\" campaign was begun to preserve the building and prevent commercial redevelopment of the space.<ref name=artscape>{{harvnb|Jones|2005}}</ref><ref name=boardoftrade>{{harvnb|Stanley Theatre moves to the next

theatre from Famous Players for $3,173,000.<ref name=inwood/> Renovation costs, including sound and lighting equipment, came to $5.8&nbsp;million,<ref name=inwood/> which brought the costs of purchase

stage lighting position]]\n\nArchitects including Thom Weeks and Jennifer Stanley led renovations of the Stanley into a live theatre.<ref name=cte/><ref name=inwood/> Weeks was initially disappointed with the state of the pre-renovated theatre, which looked \"pretty tired\" with its aged orange walls and sticky, soft drink-stained carpets.<ref name=inwood/> However, by the time the renovations were completed, and the actors and musicians were getting ready to first perform in it, there was a general feeling of excitement about the theatre.<ref name=inwood/> Renovations included expansion of the lobby, reconfiguration of the balcony, an expansion of the stage to twice its original size, a new twenty-five metre fly tower from which to raise and lower scenery, new dressing rooms, a trap room, an electrical room and a green room backstage, a reduction of the number of seats from 1,216 to 650, a crush bar in the old projection booth, a section cut out of the theatre's dome to use for spotlights, and a full restoration of the theatre's [[Metal leaf|gold-leafed]] plaster decorations.<ref name=inwood/><ref name=totallighting>{{harvnb|The Stanley Theatre, Vancouver, BC (Total Lighting Solutions)}}</ref> As a result of these renovations, in 1999 the theatre was awarded a City of Vancouver Heritage Award,<ref name=vanhistory1991/> as well as an IES International Illumination Design Award.<ref name=totallighting/>\n\n===Effects on the local area===\nA 2003 study claimed the Stanley's renovation brought positive economic effects to the theatre's local area, bounded by 8th Street and 17th between Fir and Hemlock.<ref name=artscape/> According to the study, this area became more of a leisure/recreation destination, with many new culturally related businesses, retail stores and service-related businesses opening. An increase in overall sales was noted and 76% of surveyed residents responded that the theatre's reopening had a positive effect on the community. Business respondents also reportedly had a positive view of the theatre's effects.<ref name=artscape/>\n\n==Live stage==\n[[File:Stanley Theatre at night.jpg|thumb|right|The 2004\u20132005 production

successful run,<ref name=artsclub/><ref name=ce>{{harvnb|Page}}</ref> followed by ''[[Hamlet]]''.<ref name=ce/> In addition to showing Arts Club productions, the theatre is rented out for other purposes, including business and educational presentations,<ref name=artscape/> and has been used for comedy acts and concerts, such as [[Lorne Elliott]],<ref>{{harvnb|MacPherson|2006}}</ref>

with its over-budget renovation costs, the Stanley was left with a $2&nbsp;million mortgage.<ref name=cthomas/> That year [[Industrial Alliance|Industrial Alliance Pacific Life Insurance Company]]

It was released in 1974. Of special note is the release of the album in [[Argentina]], calling the album \"P\u00e1jaros Y Frutas Ex\u00f3ticas\" (literally translated as \"Birds and Exotic Fruit\"). The cover artwork for the album is by [[Jakob Bogdani]], a noted Hungarian artist whose paintings centred on exotic birds and fruit.\n\n==Recording==\n{{more references|section|date=January 2019}}\nCollaborating again with producer Chris Thomas, Procol Harum the band recorded the album at George Martin's Air London Studios in London. According to singer/songwriter/piano player and band leader Gary Brooker the album was recorded in reaction to the two preceding albums which used extensive orchestration.

It was released in 1974. Of special note is the release of the album in [[Argentina]], calling the album \"P\u00e1jaros Y Frutas Ex\u00f3ticas\" (literally translated as \"Birds and Exotic Fruit\"). The cover artwork for the album is by [[Jakob Bogdani]], a noted Hungarian artist whose paintings centred on exotic birds and fruit.\n\n==Recording==\n{{more references|section|date=January 2019}}\nCollaborating again with producer Chris Thomas, Procol Harum the band recorded the album at George Martin's Air London Studios in London.

These have promising activity against a biological target related to COVID-19 disease. At the beginning of vaccine or drug development, little is known about the safety, [[toxicity]], [[pharmacokinetics]], and [[metabolism]] of the NCE in humans.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> It is the function and obligation of drug development to assess all of these parameters prior to human clinical trials to prove safety and efficacy. A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial (\"[[Phase I study|first-in-human]]\" [FIH] or First Human Dose [FHD], previously also known as \"first-in-man\" [FIM]).\n\nIn addition, drug development must establish the [[physicochemistry|physicochemical properties]] of the NCE: its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility. Manufacturers must optimize the process they use to make the chemical so they can scale up from a [[medicinal chemist]] producing milligrams, to manufacturing on the kilogram and [[ton]] scale.<ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> They further examine the product for suitability to package as [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]], [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], aerosol, intramuscular injectable, subcutaneous injectable, or [[intravenous]] [[formulations]]. Together, these processes are known in preclinical and clinical development as ''chemistry, manufacturing, and control'' (CMC).<ref name=strovel/>\n\nMany aspects of drug development focus on satisfying the [[new drug application|regulatory requirements]] of drug licensing authorities.<ref name=fda-ddp/> These generally constitute tests designed to determine the major toxicities of a novel compound prior to first use in humans.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/> It is a regulatory requirement that an assessment of major organ toxicity be performed (effects on the heart and lungs, brain, kidney, liver and digestive system), as well as effects on other parts of the body that might be affected by the drug (e.g., the skin if the new vaccine is to be delivered by skin injection). Increasingly, these tests are made using ''[[in vitro]]'' methods (e.g., with isolated cells), but many tests can only be made by using experimental animals to demonstrate the complex interplay of metabolism and drug exposure on toxicity.<ref name=strovel/>\n\nThe information is gathered from this preclinical testing, as well as information on CMC, and submitted to regulatory authorities (in the US, to the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]), as an [[Investigational New Drug]] (IND) or [[Biologics License Application]] application for a vaccine.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/><ref

These have promising activity against a biological target related to COVID-19 disease. At the beginning of vaccine or drug development, little is known about the safety, [[toxicity]], [[pharmacokinetics]], and [[metabolism]] of the NCE in humans.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> It is the function and obligation of drug development to assess all of these parameters prior to human clinical trials to prove safety and efficacy. A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial (\"[[Phase I study|first-in-human]]\" [FIH] or First Human Dose [FHD], previously also known as \"first-in-man\" [FIM]).\n\nIn addition, drug development must establish the [[physicochemistry|physicochemical properties]] of the NCE: its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility. Manufacturers must optimize the process they use to make the chemical so they can scale up from a [[medicinal chemist]] producing milligrams, to manufacturing on the kilogram and [[ton]] scale.<ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> They further examine the product for suitability to package as [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]], [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], aerosol, intramuscular injectable, subcutaneous injectable, or [[intravenous]] [[formulations]]. Together, these processes are known in preclinical and clinical development as ''chemistry, manufacturing, and control'' (CMC).<ref name=strovel/>\n\nMany aspects of drug development focus on satisfying the [[new drug application|regulatory requirements]] of drug licensing authorities.<ref name=fda-ddp/> These generally constitute tests designed to determine the major toxicities of a novel compound prior to first use in humans.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/> It is a regulatory requirement that an assessment of major organ toxicity be performed (effects on the heart and lungs, brain, kidney, liver and digestive system), as well as effects on other parts of the body that might be affected by the drug (e.g., the skin if the new vaccine is to be delivered by skin injection). Increasingly, these tests are made using ''[[in vitro]]'' methods (e.g., with isolated cells), but many tests can only be made by using experimental animals to demonstrate the complex interplay of metabolism and drug exposure on toxicity.<ref name=strovel/>\n\nThe information is gathered from this preclinical testing, as well as information on CMC, and submitted to regulatory authorities (in
