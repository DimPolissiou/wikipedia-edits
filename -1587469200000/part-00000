They were held on May 13, 2019 to elect members to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]].\n\nCandidates were expected to be either for or against President [[Rodrigo Duterte]]. As the Philippines has a [[multi-party system]], those who are for (or against) Duterte may find themselves running against each other. Other districts that may be seen as [[safe seat]]s may see a candidate elected unopposed. Several seats have not been apportioned since 1907, [[gerrymandering]] on some newly-apportioned seats and entrenchment of [[Political dynasties in the Philippines|political dynasties]] make competitive races in so-called [[swing seat]]s rare. The [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] is expected to lead the opposition against PDP-Laban.\n\n== Electoral system ==\nThe [[Philippines]] uses [[parallel voting]] for its lower house elections. There are currently 297 seats in the House; 238 of these are district representatives, and 59 are party-list representatives. Philippine law mandates that there should be one party-list representative for every four district representatives. District representatives are elected under the [[plurality voting system]] from [[single-member districts]]. Party-list representatives are elected via the nationwide vote with a 2% \"soft\" [[election threshold]], with a 3-seat cap. The party in the party-list election with the most votes usually wins three seats, the other parties with more than 2% of the vote two seats, and the parties with less than 2% of the vote winning a seat each if the 20% quota is not met.\n\nCampaigning for elections from congressional districts seats are decidedly local; the candidates are most likely a part of an [[Slate (elections)|election slate]] that includes candidates for other positions in the locality, and slates may comprise different parties. The political parties contesting the election make no attempt to create a national campaign.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nParty-list campaigning, on the other hand, is done on a national scale. Parties usually attempt to appeal to a specific demographic. Polling is usually conducted for the party-list election, while pollsters may release polls on specific district races. In district elections, pollsters do not attempt to make forecasts on how many votes a party would achieve, nor the number of seats a party would win; they do attempt to do that in party-list elections, though.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Participating parties==\n\n===Contesting district elections===\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!colspan=2|Party !!

National reapportionment has not happened since the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]] took effect, and aside from piecemeal redistricting, the apportionment was based on the ordinance from the constitution, which was in turn based from the 1980 census.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:92%;\"\n|+ House Bills (HB)<ref>{{cite web|title=HOUSE BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS|url=http://congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/?v=bills|publisher=congress.gov.ph|accessdate=February 10, 2018}}</ref> and Senate Bills<ref>{{cite web|title=SENATE BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS|url=http://senate.gov.ph/legisdocs/?v=bills|publisher=senate.gov.ph|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref> (SB) related to redistricing bills\n|-\n!Bill No. !!

Two were in [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]], where the entire province was redistricted from four districts to six, and one each in [[Cavite]], where the sixth and seventh districts were redistricted into three, [[Aklan]] and [[Southern Leyte]], which were split into two districts, [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], where [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]] was separated from the second district and [[South Cotabato]], where [[General Santos City]] was separated from the first district.\n\nAs there are now 245 districts; therefore, there are 61 party-list seats (at least 20% of the total), an increase from 59. The 18th Congress shall then have 306 representatives. However, as preparations were already on its way when the laws for the creation of General Santos and Southern Leyte districts were made, the commission decided to delay elections for the four seats involved to October 2019; the ballots for those districts showed their previous conflagrations as if it were not redistricted yet. A lawsuit was then decided by the Supreme Court prior to rescheduled elections, ordering the commission to declare the winner of the election in South Cotabato's 1st district. Upon doing so, the commission then declared the winner of the unified Southern Leyte district as well. The first elections for these two districts shall be on 2022, at the next general election. This left the number of districts to 243, with still 61 party-list seats.\n\n==Retiring and term-limited incumbents==\n===Term limited===\nThese representatives are term-limited, and are thus not allowed to run in 2019:\n{{col-start}}{{col-2}}\n*Ang Asosasyon Sang Mangunguma Nga Bisaya Owa Mangunguma incumbents\n**Sharon Garin (party-list)\n**:Garin denied that either she or her siblings were running for [[Governor of Iloilo]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Richard\u2019s sis not running for guv|url=https://www.panaynews.net/richards-sis-not-running-for-guv/|work=Panay News|date=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n*Advocacy for Teacher Empowerment through Action, Cooperation, and Harmony Towards Educational Reforms, Inc. incumbents\n**Julieta Cortuna (party-list)\n\n*Alliance of Concerned Teachers incumbents\n**Antonio Tinio (party-list)\n\n*Ako Bikol incumbents\n**Rodel Batocabe\u2020 (party-list)\n***Decided to run for [[Daraga, Albay|Daraga]] mayor, killed in an assassination.\n**Christopher Co (party-list)\n\n*Buhay Hayaan Yumabong incumbents\n**Mariano Michael Velarde Jr. (party-list)\n\n*Citizens' Battle Against Corruption incumbents\n**[[Sherwin Tugna]] (party-list)\n\n*Democratic Independent Workers Association incumbents\n**Emmeline Aglipay-Villar (party-list)\n\n*Gabriela Women's Party incumbents\n**Emmi de Jesus (party-list)\n\n*Kalinga: Advocacy for Social Empowerment and Nation Building through Easing Poverty incumbents\n**Abigail Faye Ferriol-Pascual (party-list)\n\n*Kusug Tausug incumbents\n**Shernee Tan (party-list)\n\n*Liberal Party incumbents\n**[[Kaka Bag-ao]] (Dinagat Islands)\n**:Running for Governor of [[Dinagat Islands]].<ref>{{cite news|title=LIST: Local bets who filed COCs on Day 4, October 16|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2019/214467-list-local-bets-who-filed-certificates-candidacy-october-16-2018|accessdate=October 30, 2018|work=Rappler|language=en}}</ref>\n**[[Teddy Baguilat]] (Ifugao)\n**:Running for Governor of [[Ifugao]]\n**Jorge Banal (Quezon City\u20133rd)\n**Leopoldo Bataoil (Pangasinan\u20132nd)\n**[[Feliciano Belmonte Jr.]] (Quezon City\u20134th)\n**:Belmonte will retire from politics after his term ends in 2019, according to his daughter, [[Quezon City]] Vice Mayor [[Joy Belmonte]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cepeda|first1=Mara|title=Sonny Belmonte will stick with LP, says daughter Joy|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/169561-sonny-belmonte-staying-liberal-party|accessdate=May 5, 2018|work=Rappler|language=en}}</ref>\n**Imelda Calixto-Rubiano (Pasay)\n**:Running for Mayor of [[Pasay]] under [[Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan|PDP-Laban]].\n**Jose Carlos Cari (Leyte\u20135th)\n**Winnie Castelo (Quezon City\u20132nd)\n**:Running for Councilor of the 2nd District of [[Quezon City]] under Serbisyo sa Bayan Party.\n**Ronald Cosalan (Benguet)\n**[[Raul Daza]] (Northern Samar\u20131st)\n**Rogelio Espina (Biliran)\n**:Running for Governor of [[Biliran]]\n**Ana Cristina Go (Isabela\u20132nd)\n**[[Miro Quimbo]] (Marikina\u20132nd)\n**:Quimbo will run for Mayor of [[Marikina City]], later, he decided not to run.\n**Carlo Lopez (Manila\u20132nd)\n**[[Rene Relampagos]] (Bohol\u20131st)\n**:Running for Vice Governor of [[Bohol]] under the [[National Unity Party (Philippines)|National Unity Party]].\n**Linabelle Ruth Villarica (Bulacan\u20134th)\n**:Running for Mayor of [[Meycauayan, Bulacan]] under [[Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan|PDP-Laban]].\n\n*LPG Marketers Association incumbents\n**Arnel Ty (party-list)\n\n*Nacionalista Party incumbents\n**Florencio Flores Jr. (Bukidnon\u20132nd)\n**Seth Frederick Jalosjos (Zamboanga del Norte\u20131st)\n**[[Imelda Marcos]] (Ilocos Norte\u20132nd) \n**:running for Governor of Ilocos Norte, later withdrew\n\n*Nationalist People's Coalition incumbents\n**Pedro Acharon Jr. (South Cotabato\u20131st)\n**[[Mercedes Alvarez (politician)|Mercedes Alvarez]] (Negros Occidental\u20136th)\n**:In 2017, Alvarez said she plans to retire from politics after finishing her term.

They were held on May 13, 2019 to elect members to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]].\n\nCandidates were expected to be either for or against President [[Rodrigo Duterte]]. As the Philippines has a [[multi-party system]], those who are for (or against) Duterte may find themselves running against each other. Other districts that may be seen as [[safe seat]]s may see a candidate elected unopposed. Several seats have not been apportioned since 1907, [[gerrymandering]] on some newly-apportioned seats and entrenchment of [[Political dynasties in the Philippines|political dynasties]] make competitive races in so-called [[swing seat]]s rare. The [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] is expected to lead the opposition against PDP-Laban.\n\n== Electoral system ==\nThe [[Philippines]] uses [[parallel voting]] for its lower house elections. There are currently 297 seats in the House; 238 of these are district representatives, and 59 are party-list representatives. Philippine law mandates that there should be one party-list representative for every four district representatives. District representatives are elected under the [[plurality voting system]] from [[single-member districts]]. Party-list representatives are elected via the nationwide vote with a 2% \"soft\" [[election threshold]], with a 3-seat cap. The party in the party-list election with the most votes usually wins three seats, the other parties with more than 2% of the vote two seats, and the parties with less than 2% of the vote winning a seat each if the 20% quota is not met.\n\nCampaigning for elections from congressional districts seats are decidedly local; the candidates are most likely a part of an [[Slate (elections)|election slate]] that includes candidates for other positions in the locality, and slates may comprise different parties. The political parties contesting the election make no attempt to create a national campaign.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nParty-list campaigning, on the other hand, is done on a national scale. Parties usually attempt to appeal to a specific demographic. Polling is usually conducted for the party-list election, while pollsters may release polls on specific district races. In district elections, pollsters do not attempt to make forecasts on how many votes a party would achieve, nor the number of seats a party would win; they do attempt to do that in party-list elections, though.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Participating parties==\n\n===Contesting district elections===\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!colspan=2|Party !!

National reapportionment has not happened since the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]] took effect, and aside from piecemeal redistricting, the apportionment was based on the ordinance from the constitution, which was in turn based from the 1980 census.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:92%;\"\n|+ House Bills (HB)<ref>{{cite web|title=HOUSE BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS|url=http://congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/?v=bills|publisher=congress.gov.ph|accessdate=February 10, 2018}}</ref> and Senate Bills<ref>{{cite web|title=SENATE BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS|url=http://senate.gov.ph/legisdocs/?v=bills|publisher=senate.gov.ph|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref> (SB) related to redistricing bills\n|-\n!Bill No. !!

The 18th Congress shall then have 306 representatives. However, as preparations were already on its way when the laws for the creation of General Santos and Southern Leyte districts were made, the commission decided to delay elections for the four seats involved to October 2019; the ballots for those districts showed their previous conflagrations as if it were not redistricted yet. A lawsuit was then decided by the Supreme Court prior to that, ordering the commission to declare the winner of the election in South Cotabato's 1st district. Upon doing so, the commission then declared the winner of the Southern Leyte district as well. The first elections for these two districts shall be on 2022, at the next general election.

It is celebrated in honour of [[Haile Selassie]]'s 1966 visit to Jamaica.\n\n==Visit of Selassie to Jamaica==\nHaile Selassie had already met with several Rasta elders in [[Addis Ababa]], and had allowed Rastafari and other [[African diaspora|people of African descent]] to settle on his personal land in [[Shashamane]].\n\nHaile Selassie visited [[Jamaica]] on Thursday, April 21, 1966. Some 100,000 Rastafari from all over Jamaica descended on [[Palisadoes Airport]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]],<ref name=\"Dread\">Dread, The Rastafarians of Jamaica, by Joseph Owens ISBN</ref> having heard that the man whom they considered to be God was coming to visit them.

The day had been overcast and stormy. After about half an hour, the door swung open and the emperor appeared at the top of the mobile steps. A deafening tumult was heard from the crowd, who beat [[calabash]] drums, lit firecrackers, waved signs, and sounded [[Abeng]] horns of the [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0022.html |title=A Special Gleaner Feature on Pieces of the Past \u2013 All Hail The State Visit of Emperor Haile Selassie I \u2013 The first 500 years in Jamaica |publisher=Jamaica-gleaner.com |accessdate=April 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511172601/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0022.html |archivedate=May 11, 2011 }}</ref> All protocol was dropped as the crowd pressed past the security forces and onto the [[red carpet]] that had been laid out for the reception. Selassie waved from the top of the steps; some interpreters have claimed that he shed tears, although this is disputed. He then returned into the plane, disappearing for several more minutes. Finally Jamaican authorities were obliged to request Ras [[Mortimer Planno]], a well-known Rasta leader, to climb the steps, enter the plane, and negotiate the Emperor's descent.<ref>''Catch a Fire: The Life of Bob Marley'' by Timothy White p. 15, 210, 211.</ref> When Planno reemerged, he announced to the crowd: \"The Emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm. Step back and let the Emperor land\"<ref>''Black Heretics, Black Prophets: Radical Political Intellectuals'' p. 189 by Anthony Bogues</ref> After Planno escorted the African monarch down the steps, journalists were puzzled by Selassie's refusal to walk on the red carpet on the way to his limousine (hence ''grounation'', [[Iyaric]] equivalent of ''foundation'', \"uplifted\" with the sound of the word ''ground'' in the sense of \"making contact with the soil\"). He was then driven to the [[Official residence# Jamaica|King's House]], the residence of [[Governor-General of Jamaica|Governor-General]] [[Clifford Campbell]].<ref name=\"White, p. 211\">White, p. 211.</ref> \n\nAs a result of Planno's actions, the Jamaican authorities were asked to ensure that Rastafari representatives were present at all state functions attended by His Majesty,<ref>''Rastafari: From Outcasts to Culture Bearers'' Page 86 by Ennis Barrington Edmonds</ref><ref>''Verbal Riddim: The Politics and Aesthetics of African-Caribbean Dub Poetry'', page 83 by Christian Habekost</ref> and Rastafari elders, including Planno and probably [[Joseph Hibbert]], also obtained a private audience with the Emperor,<ref>Edmonds, p. 86</ref> where he reportedly told them that they should not immigrate to Ethiopia until they had first liberated the people of Jamaica. This dictum came to be known as \"liberation before [[repatriation]]\".

It is celebrated in honor of [[Haile Selassie]]'s 1966 visit to Jamaica.\n\n==Visit of Selassie to Jamaica==\nHaile Selassie had already met with several Rasta elders in [[Addis Ababa]], and had allowed Rastafari and other [[African diaspora|people of African descent]] to settle on his personal land in [[Shashamane]].\n\nHaile Selassie visited [[Jamaica]] on Thursday, April 21, 1966. Some 100,000 Rastafari from all over Jamaica descended on [[Palisadoes Airport]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]],<ref name=\"Dread\">Dread, The Rastafarians of Jamaica, by Joseph Owens ISBN</ref> having heard that the man whom they considered to be God was coming to visit them. They waited at the airport playing [[drum]]s and smoking large quantities of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].<ref name=\"Dread\"/> Today the Rastafari celebrate that Haile Selassie visited Jamaica on {{nowrap|April 21}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/holydays/holydays.shtml |title=Rastafari: Holy days |date=October 20, 2011 |website=BBC  |access-date=April 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhen Haile Selassie's [[Ethiopian Airlines]] flight landed at the airport at {{nowrap|1:30&nbsp;pm}}, the crowd surrounded his plane on the [[Airport apron|tarmac]]. The day had been overcast and stormy. After about half an hour, the door swung open and the emperor appeared at the top of the mobile steps. A deafening tumult was heard from the crowd, who beat [[calabash]] drums, lit firecrackers, waved signs, and sounded [[Abeng]] horns of the [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0022.html |title=A Special Gleaner Feature on Pieces of the Past \u2013 All Hail The State Visit of Emperor Haile Selassie I \u2013 The first 500 years in Jamaica |publisher=Jamaica-gleaner.com |accessdate=April 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511172601/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0022.html |archivedate=May 11, 2011 }}</ref> All protocol was dropped as the crowd pressed past the security forces and onto the [[red carpet]] that had been laid out for the reception. Selassie waved from the top of the steps; some interpreters have claimed that he shed tears, although this is disputed. He then returned into the plane, disappearing for several more minutes. Finally Jamaican authorities were obliged to request Ras [[Mortimer Planno]], a well-known Rasta leader, to climb the steps, enter the plane, and negotiate the Emperor's descent.<ref>''Catch a Fire: The Life of Bob Marley'' by Timothy White p. 15, 210, 211.</ref> When Planno reemerged, he announced to the crowd: \"The Emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm. Step back and let the Emperor land\"<ref>''Black Heretics, Black Prophets: Radical Political Intellectuals'' p. 189 by Anthony Bogues</ref> After Planno escorted the African monarch down the steps, journalists were puzzled by Selassie's refusal to walk on the red carpet on the way to his limousine (hence ''grounation'', [[Iyaric]] equivalent of ''foundation'', \"uplifted\" with the sound of the word ''ground'' in the sense of \"making contact with the soil\"). He was then driven to the [[Official residence# Jamaica|King's House]], the residence of [[Governor-General of Jamaica|Governor-General]] [[Clifford Campbell]].<ref name=\"White, p. 211\">White, p. 211.</ref> \n\nAs a result of Planno's actions, the Jamaican authorities were asked to ensure that Rastafari representatives were present at all state functions attended by His Majesty,<ref>''Rastafari: From Outcasts to Culture Bearers'' Page 86 by Ennis Barrington Edmonds</ref><ref>''Verbal Riddim: The Politics and Aesthetics of African-Caribbean Dub Poetry'', page 83 by Christian Habekost</ref> and Rastafari elders, including Planno and probably [[Joseph Hibbert]], also obtained a private audience with the Emperor,<ref>Edmonds, p. 86</ref> where he reportedly told them that they should not immigrate to Ethiopia until they had first liberated the people of Jamaica.
