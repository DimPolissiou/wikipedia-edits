{"title_page": "Comparison of digital image metadata editors", "text_new": "This article presents a comparison of [[digital image]] [[metadata]] [[File viewer|viewers]] and metadata [[Editor (disambiguation)#Computing|editors]].\n\nA metadata editor is a [[computer program]] that allows users to view and edit [[metadata tag]]s interactively on the computer screen and save them in the graphics file. Usually a metadata viewer is preferred over a metadata editor for viewing tags.\n\nA number of metadata editors for various platforms exist. Users choose among them based on factors such as the availability for the user's platform, the feature set and usability of the [[user interface]] (UI).\n\nThe [[Metadata Working Group|Metadata Working Group (MWG)]] is a consortium of leading companies in the digital media industry.<ref name=\"mwg\">http://www.metadataworkinggroup.org/info/pdf/photokina_pr_2008_09_24.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727082048/http://www.metadataworkinggroup.org/info/pdf/photokina_pr_2008_09_24.pdf |date=2011-07-27 }} Metadata Working Group Introduces First Specification for Interoperability and Preservation of Metadata in Digital Photography</ref> \nThe MWG publishes technical specifications that describe how to effectively store metadata into digital media files. These royalty-free specifications are made available to software developers, manufacturers and service providers so that they may create products that use metadata in a consistent way, and that allow consumers to better describe, organize and find their media. Where possible, these specifications rely on existing standards, and aim to create a unified and cohesive approach to applying these standards.<ref name=\"spec\">http://www.metadataworkinggroup.org/pdf/mwg_guidance.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131102845/http://www.metadataworkinggroup.org/pdf/mwg_guidance.pdf |date=2012-01-31 }} Guidelines for Handling Image Metadata</ref>\n\n== Features ==\n\n{|  class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:80%;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=2 | Software\n! rowspan=2 | Platform\n! rowspan=2 | License\n! rowspan=2 | Latest version\n! rowspan=2 | Last release year\n! rowspan=2 | Size<br />([[Megabyte|MB]]){{efn|The size depends on chosen installation.<br/>The lower limit is for a minimal installation.<br/>The upper limit is for a full installation with all features.}}\n! rowspan=2 | Description\n! rowspan=2 | Number{{efn|Number of editable tags}}\n! colspan=6 | Supported metadata standards{{efn|EXIF - Exchangeable image file format for digital still cameras<br/>\nGPS - The global positioning system<br/>\nIPTC - IPTC-NAA Information Interchange Model<br/>\nXMP - Extensible Metadata Platform<br/>\nMaker - Proprietary Maker Notes<br/>\nOther - Other standards, for example: IRB Adobe Photoshop image resource blocks, MPF - Multu-Picture Format\n:R - Can Read tags\n:E - Can Edit tags\n:W - Can Write tags\n:D - Can Delete tags}}\n! colspan=4 | Supported file formats{{efn|JPEG - ISO/IEC  IS 10918-1 1993(E)<br/>\nTIFF - Tagged Image File Format<br/>\nRaw - Proprietary raw formats<br/>\nOther - Other formats, for example: PSD Adobe Photoshop, DNG Digital Negative, JP2 JPEG2000\n:Yes - Format is supported}}\n|- \n!

The book was published on December 4, 2012. A [[GraphicAudio]] [[audiobook]] was recorded in 2013.\n\n==Plot==\nThe book is set in two time periods: Batman in the main narrative set in present day, and the story of Thomas Wayne set primarily in 1957-58.\n\n===Thomas Wayne===\nIn 1957, [[Thomas Wayne]] arrives at the Koffee Klatch coffee house, where he meets [[Martha Wayne | Martha Kane]] at a party. He meets her friends, including Lew Moxon, son of mob boss Julius Moxon. When he takes a passed out Martha home, Thomas wonders why she can't love him like he loves her. Thomas meets with his father, Patrick, at [[Wayne Enterprises#Wayne Tower]], where he lays down his disdain over Martha Kane's friends, demanding that he learns to be ''the predator and not the prey'', before kicking him out. Thomas sets up an interview to see Dr. Ernst Richter, as he is very interested with his experiments. Thomas shows Richter their new laboratory inside [[Arkham Asylum]]. With everything set, they begin work creating a sociological virus against human desires for crime, corruption and evil. \n\nIn 1958: Martha rushes into [[Wayne Manor]] and tells Thomas that Denholm Sinclair, a man she was interested in, was arrested but doesn't know why. Thomas doesn't tell her Denholm's crimes of  embezzlement, arson, and murder at the Kane Foundation Orphanage, but says he'll try to help him. In actuality, Denholm is taken in as their new test subject. As months pass, Denholm along with 3 others are tested with the virus; as they all start deforming and increasing in strength, becoming monsters, they break out and kill Richter. Thomas finds him and freaks out, calling his butler Jarvis Pennyworth for help, who personally \u201ccleans it up\u201d using his OSS and SOE skills. Throughout the year, the 4 subjects become Gotham's vigilante group, The Apocalypse, consist of Fate, Reaper, Chanteuse, and Disciple. Hunting down criminals, the mob, and anyone in the middle. This leads all of Gotham's gangs to join forces in an attempt to trap and kill the Apocalypse at the amusement park, only to suffer heavy losses, leaving both Julius Moxon and his right hand man Salvatore to escape. \n\nAt the manor, Thomas sets up his costume for the party at Martha's house, a \"Bat-Man\" outfit, when he is confronted by Denholm aka Disciple. He thanks him for ''fixing'' him, and reveals Julius is going to Kane Mansion for his help, and plots to kill him. Thomas pleads but Disciple knocks him out. At the Kane Mansion, \"Thomas\" is greeted by the elegant masquerading wearing Martha when Salvatore and six armed men arrive demanding for Thomas Wayne to fix Julius. The real Thomas enters the ballroom unseen, when Lew tries to calm everything down as \"Thomas\" attacks him and fights the gang, leaving the party-goers in awe. Thomas helps Julius recover when Disciple appears wanting to kill Thomas, and Thomas leads him to the cave underneath Wayne Manor in hopes of trapping him. He finds Patrick Wayne's old shotgun and Thomas fires at him, emptying the shells and ultimately killing him. But Thomas doesn't realize what just happened as his blood spills into the Gotham River...\n\n===Bruce Wayne/Batman=\nIn present day, [[Batman]] chases down victims controlled by the villainess [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)#Fay Moffit | Spellbinder]] to commit crimes, one of them being [[Commissioner Gordon]]. After subduing them all, he discovers Spellbinder is actually being controlled by forces unknown, and finds the dummy [[Ventriloquist (comics) | Scarface]] that gives him an invitation card for a party held at Bristol, where Wayne Manor is, alerting him that someone knows who is behind the mask. Returning to the [[Batcave]] in the [[Batmobile]], Bruce Wayne thinks over how things have changed: he's pushing 50, and not longer in his prime; and he has since abandoned his playboy persona to become a Howard Hughes-inspired recluse. By morning, as he thinks about the card, Bruce finds himself in his mother's gardens where he discovers a woman who has somehow trespassed into. Pretending to be the manor's gamekeeper, Gerald, he learns the woman, Amanda Richter, intends is to warn Wayne. He helps her to the front of the grounds where she calls [[Alfred Pennyworth]] through the intercom, and Bruce notices how alert Alfred's voice is when she reveals her name, and goes back to the cave. Scanning the card, he discovers it contains data: a missing file related to his parents' deaths. It is a witness report by Marion Richter, Amanda's sister, claiming Thomas and Martha Wayne were killed due to his business with their father, Dr. Ernst Richter; followed by an interview with Alfred knowing the Richters, but denying anything else. Bruce reopens the case of his parents' deaths.\n\nBatman meets up with Gordon, who reveals that Spellbinder's victims each got a card designed for memory tampering, made by deceased cultist Doctor Moon. Batman heads to Dixon College, where Moon's Cultists resided. After fighting the group of sword wielding assassins, Batman finds the body of Moon, with letters in his hand from Thomas Wayne to Ernst Richter about his obsession with Richter's work, but the pages are missing. He meets with Alfred to ask about his knowledge of Richter, but claims to not know anything. Bruce finds Amanda at Curtis Point park. Using his Gerald persona, Amanda reveals her father, Ernst, lived and died at Arkham Asylum; then her story becomes weird when she reveals her name is actually Marion, and screams at Bruce by calling him Thomas, and accusing him of their nightmare before collapsing. He takes her home where he is greeted by her nurse, Ellen Doppel. She reveals Amanda is actually Marion, but with a split personality of Amanda, claiming to be her ghost who wants revenge.\n\nBatman looks up that Richter was brought in through the OSS, cementing the connection between the Richters and Pennyworths even more. He looks up the file on Denholm Sinclair, learning about the Kane Foundation Orphanage arson, and roars the Batmobile to that destination. Investigating inside, [[Harley Quinn]] unexpectedly reveals herself and a chase begins just as the orphanage explodes into flames. Batman grabs Harley through the destruction, and drags her underneath Arkham to meet up with Gordon until she breaks free. Chasing her, she leads him to the laboratory that belonged to Thomas and Richter. Batman finds Richter's diary, and reads about the subjects' escape back in '58. Batman realizes he's being watched, and temporary shuts down the camera to grab evidence before finally taking Harley to Gordon. Batman goes back to the lab and hides. Nurse Doppel arrives for the book and Batman confronts her. She reveals she'd been instructed by Marion/Amanda to come and get the book, and pleads to him that she's been controlled by evil forces. Telling her to follow her instructions like normal, Batman heads back to the Batmobile and looks over the letter he grabbed from the lab, while realizing from these recent events that he never actually knew his parents. Reading the letter written by Thomas, he learns about the Apocalypse group; learning they lasted a full decade, ending a few years before his parents died. Batman realizes Doppel is heading to the home of Lewis Moxon and his daughter, Mallory, his childhood friend.\n\nBruce meets Mallory inside her home, and wants her help to talk to her father about his father's past and the Apocalypse group. Mallory says the Apocalypse isn't something to speak to her father of, while taking a call that she got the book. Bruce checks who called her and is surprised to hear Alfred's voice. He heads back to the Batmobile, only to see it getting towed by [[The Joker]]'s gang. Bruce knocks one out to disguise himself as one of them as they reach the Joker at his lair, who stole the Batmobile to lure Batman. Bruce sneaks inside the Batmobile and uses his jet to break free from its binds. Joker and his gang come at him with RPGs while the Joker controls the trains. Bruce defeats the gang and survives Joker's explosive attack, and heads home. Bruce confronts Alfred at the manor, and Alfred reveals that he's known what Thomas and Jarvis had done years back since 1967, around the time his father died and he took over for the Waynes. He also reveals that the Richters have always tried to blackmail them for years, and it is only now that Bruce knows about it. Bruce shows Alfred where tonight's party is located: the condemned Kane Mansion. Alfred pleads for Bruce not to go, and Bruce fires him.\n\nBatman arrives at the Mansion and sees various dancing mannequins in the ballroom. He sees Marion/Amanda dancing until she disappears, then the tape of Thomas Wayne's testimony on the night of the 1958 costume party is played just as Batman is attacked by numerous killers. Batman climbs to the ballroom's dome and detonates it; the debris traps the mannequin assassins while Batman saves Marion/Amanda, grabs Thomas Wayne's testimony tapes, and returns to the Batcave. Bruce finishes the tape where Thomas reveals he killed Disciple, but his blood went into the Gotham river, heightening the chances of infecting many from contact. Bruce answers a call from Nurse Doppel about Marion/Amanda, until he realizes he's not at home at all.... Bruce wakes up alongside Amanda at the Academy Theater, the same one he, Thomas and Martha were the night of the latter two's deaths. Bruce escapes just as footage of the 1958 costume party plays, followed by NEWS ON THE MARCH on Thomas Wayne saving lives from the German Measels, a lie Bruce now knows as his father was trying to cure those from his virus. He heads out to [[Crime Alley]], where Nurse Doppel appears and shoots him. Dying, Droppel reveals to Bruce that she is Marion, and that \u201cAmanda\u201d is the real Nurse Doppel, with the late Amanda's memories implanted. She explains she wants him dead as his family took everything from hers, and she took control of any villain she could catch to show him his family's dark past, as he carries the sins of his father. The real Nurse Doppell arrives, and remembering who she is, kills Marion. Bruce seemingly dies.\n\nSix months later: Alfred and Gordon talk at the Wayne Mausoleum, talking about the funeral held for Bruce and what kind of man he was. Once Gordon leaves, Batman reveals himself to Alfred; deciding to stay dead as he always felt he was when his parents were killed. He asks if they ever truly know their parents, and Alfred believes its best to known them from how we remember them, not for who they truly were.\n\n==Reviews==\nEric Garneau wrote that \"there are a few nice things to be said about Hickman's writing.

The book was published on December 4, 2012. A [[GraphicAudio]] [[audiobook]] was recorded in 2013.\n\n==Plot==\nThe book is set in two time periods: Batman in the main narrative set in present day, and the story of Thomas Wayne set primarily in 1957-58.\n\n===THOMAS WAYNE===\nIn 1957, [[Thomas Wayne]] arrives at the Koffee Klatch coffee house, where he meets [[Martha Wayne | Martha Kane]] at a party. He meets her friends, including Lew Moxon, son of mob boss Julius Moxon. When he takes a passed out Martha home, Thomas wonders why she can't love him like he loves her. Thomas meets with his father, Patrick, at [[Wayne Enterprises#Wayne Tower]], where he lays down his disdain over Martha Kane's friends, demanding that he learns to be ''the predator and not the prey'', before kicking him out. Thomas sets up an interview to see Dr. Ernst Richter, as he is very interested with his experiments. Thomas shows Richter their new laboratory inside [[Arkham Asylum]]. With everything set, they begin work creating a sociological virus against human desires for crime, corruption and evil. \n\nIn 1958: Martha rushes into [[Wayne Manor]] and tells Thomas that Denholm Sinclair, a man she was interested in, was arrested but doesn't know why. Thomas doesn't tell her Denholm's crimes of  embezzlement, arson, and murder at the Kane Foundation Orphanage, but says he'll try to help him. In actuality, Denholm is taken in as their new test subject. As months pass, Denholm along with 3 others are tested with the virus; as they all start deforming and increasing in strength, becoming monsters, they break out and kill Richter. Thomas finds him and freaks out, calling his butler Jarvis Pennyworth for help, who personally \u201ccleans it up\u201d using his OSS and SOE skills. Throughout the year, the 4 subjects become Gotham's vigilante group, The Apocalypse, consist of Fate, Reaper, Chanteuse, and Disciple. Hunting down criminals, the mob, and anyone in the middle. This leads all of Gotham's gangs to join forces in an attempt to trap and kill the Apocalypse at the amusement park, only to suffer heavy losses, leaving both Julius Moxon and his right hand man Salvatore to escape. \n\nAt the manor, Thomas sets up his costume for the party at Martha's house, a \"Bat-Man\" outfit, when he is confronted by Denholm aka Disciple. He thanks him for ''fixing'' him, and reveals Julius is going to Kane Mansion for his help, and plots to kill him. Thomas pleads but Disciple knocks him out. At the Kane Mansion, \"Thomas\" is greeted by the elegant masquerading wearing Martha when Salvatore and six armed men arrive demanding for Thomas Wayne to fix Julius. The real Thomas enters the ballroom unseen, when Lew tries to calm everything down as \"Thomas\" attacks him and fights the gang, leaving the party-goers in awe. Thomas helps Julius recover when Disciple appears wanting to kill Thomas, and Thomas leads him to the cave underneath Wayne Manor in hopes of trapping him. He finds Patrick Wayne's old shotgun and Thomas fires at him, emptying the shells and ultimately killing him. But Thomas doesn't realize what just happened as his blood spills into the Gotham River...\n\n===BRUCE WAYNE/BATMAN===\nIn present day, [[Batman]] chases down victims controlled by the villainess [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)#Fay Moffit | Spellbinder]] to commit crimes, one of them being [[Commissioner Gordon]].

ZANU won the election and Mugabe became the first [[Prime Minister of Zimbabwe]] on 18 April 1980, when the country achieved internationally recognised independence.\n\n==Background==\nThe origin of the war in [[Rhodesia]] can be traced to the conquest of the region by the [[British South Africa Company]] in the late 19th century, and the dissent of native leaders who opposed foreign rule.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, p. 37\">{{Harvnb|Rogers|1998|p=37}}</ref> Britons began settling in Southern Rhodesia from the 1890s, and while it was never accorded full [[dominion]] status, these settlers effectively governed the country after 1923.\n\nIn his famous \"[[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]]\" speech, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Harold Macmillan]] revealed Britain's new policy to only permit independence to its African colonies under majority rule.<ref name=wessels6873/> But many white Rhodesians were concerned that such immediate change would cause chaos [[Congo Crisis|as had resulted]] in the former [[Belgian Congo]] after its independence in 1960.<ref name=\"wessels6873\">{{Harvnb|Wessels|2010|pp=68\u201373}}</ref>\n\nBritain's unwillingness to compromise led to Rhodesia's [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|unilateral declaration of independence]] (UDI) on 11 November 1965.

Two rival nationalist organisations emerged in August 1963: the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) and the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), after disagreements about tactics, as well as tribalism and personality clashes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sibanda|2005\n|p=321}}</ref> ZANU and its military wing [[ZANLA]] were headed by [[Robert Mugabe]] and consisted primarily of [[Shona language|Shona]] tribes.

[[Ian Smith]] further expounded this by portraying the conflict as primarily anti-communist in nature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Michael|date=June 2007|title=The Wretched of the Empire: Politics, Ideology and Counterinsurgency in Rhodesia, 1965\u201380|journal=Small Wars & Insurgencies|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=175\u2013195|doi=10.1080/09574040701400601|issn=0959-2318}}</ref> The Rhodesian whites, and a percentage of well-off blacks, viewed the British demand for majority-rule as a direct attack on their way of life. Having previously witnesses the communist redistribution of resources after the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Mau Rebellion]], Rhodesians refused to allow the majority-rule policy to come into effect. Much of the Rhodesian economy as well as the land was controlled by white Rhodesians, and, fearing total confiscation by either the ZIPRA or ZANLA, the RF elected to hold onto the unofficial minority-rule. In ignoring other contributing factors to the conflict, Smith and the RF were able to strengthen ties with the West, however, Britain remained neutral. The division between the communists and anti-communists caused the fighting to spill over the Rhodesian borders. Neighboring African nations, supported primarily by North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, utilized communist material support to begin launching guerrilla attacks on the RF.\n\nThe United States took the official position that it would not recognize Rhodesia as an independent sovereign. However, many American soldiers who had seen combat in Vietnam quickly joined into the Rhodesian Front. The RF created advertising campaigns in order to attract soldiers from Western countries, and the RF amassed a force of nearly 1,400 soldiers that were highly trained in special forces and guerrilla warfare, bringing the total RF military force to over 10,000 men. Many of the professional American soldiers entering the RF directly into the force became de facto members of the Rhodesian government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vvaveteran.org/32-2/32-2_rhodesia.html|title=The VVA Veteran, a publication of Vietnam Veterans of America|website=vvaveteran.org|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union became extremely invested in the Rhodesian Bush War.

The Rhodesian government saw the conflict as a fight between one part of the country's population (the Whites) on behalf of the whole population (including the Black majority) against several externally financed parties made up of predominantly Black [[Radicalization|radicals]] and communists. The Nationalists considered their country occupied and dominated by a foreign power, namely Britain, since 1890.<ref name=\"binda48\">{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|p=48}}</ref>\n\nThe British government, in the person of the [[Governor of Southern Rhodesia|Governor]], had indirectly ruled the country from 1923, when it took over from the [[British South Africa Company]] and granted [[self-governing colony|self-governing status]] to a locally elected government, made up predominantly of Whites. Ian Smith's [[Rhodesian Front]] party was elected to power in 1962 and [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] on 11 November 1965 to preserve what it saw as the self-government it had possessed since 1923.<ref name=\"binda48\"/>\n\nThe Rhodesian government contended that it was defending Western values, Christianity, the [[rule of law]] and democracy by fighting Communists, but it was unwilling to compromise on most political, economic and social inequalities. The Smith administration claimed that the legitimate voice of the black Shona and Ndebele population were the traditional chiefs, not the ZANU and ZAPU nationalists, whom it regarded as dangerous, violent usurpers.<ref name=\"wood2008542\">{{Harvnb|Wood|2008|pp=542\u2013555}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978\u20131979, the Smith administration tried to blunt the power of the nationalist cause by acceding to an \"Internal Settlement\" which ended minority rule, changed the name of the country to [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]], and arranged multiracial elections, which were held [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia general election, 1979|in 1979]] and won by Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]], who became the country's first Black head of government. Unsatisfied with this and spurred on by Britain's refusal to recognise the new order, the nationalist forces persisted.\n\nThe war ended when, at the behest of both South Africa (its major supporter) and the United States, the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian government ceded power to Britain in the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] in December 1979. The UK Government held another election [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980|in 1980]] to form a new government. The election was won by ZANU. The new government, headed by [[Robert Mugabe]], was recognised internationally, and the country was renamed [[Zimbabwe]].\n\n==Belligerents==\n\n===Rhodesian Security Forces===\n{{main|Rhodesian Security Forces}}\n[[File:Rhodesian African Rifles, Lake Kariba, December 1976, 3.png|thumb|upright|Two soldiers of the [[Rhodesian African Rifles]] aboard a patrol boat on [[Lake Kariba]], December 1976.

While the regular army consisted of a professional core of white soldiers (and some units, such as the [[Rhodesian SAS]] and the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]], were all-white), by 1978\u20131979 the rest was majority black.<ref name=\"lohman3\">{{Harvnb|Lohman|MacPherson|1983|loc=chpt. 3}}</ref>\n\nBy contrast, army reserves were largely white, and toward the end of the war were increasingly called up to deal with the growing insurgency. The regular army was supported by the para-military [[British South Africa Police]] of about 8,000 to 11,000 men (the majority of whom were black) and 19,000 to 35,000 police reservists (which, like their army counterparts, were largely white). The police reserves acted as a type of home guard.<ref name=\"lohman3\"/>\n\nThe war saw the extensive operation of Rhodesian regulars as well as elite units such as the [[Selous Scouts]] and the [[Rhodesian Special Air Service|Rhodesian SAS]]. The [[Rhodesian Army]] fought bitterly against the black nationalist guerrillas. The Rhodesian Army also comprised mostly black regiments such as the [[Rhodesian African Rifles]]. As the war went on, the frequent call-up of reservists was increasingly used to supplement the professional soldiers and the many volunteers from overseas.<ref name=\"abbott17\">{{Harvnb|Abbott|Botham|1986|p=17}}</ref><ref name=\"binda186188\">{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|pp=186\u2013188}}</ref>\n\nBy 1978, all white men up to the age of 60 were subject to periodic call-up to the army; younger men up to 35 might expect to spend alternating blocks of six weeks in the army and at home. Many of the overseas volunteers came from Britain, Ireland, South Africa, Portugal, Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America with the latter three being held in high regard for their recent [[Vietnam War]] experience.<ref name=\"abbott17\"/><ref name=\"binda186188\"/>\n\nConsidering the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 232|arms embargo]], the Rhodesian Army was well-equipped. The standard infantry weapon was the Belgian [[FN FAL]] Rifle as produced in South Africa under license as the R1 Rifle and supplemented by the [[H&K G3]] rifle that came from Portuguese forces. However, other weapons such as the British L1A1 ('SLR') variant of the FAL and the older British [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] [[bolt-action]] rifle were used by reservists and the [[British South Africa Police]]. Other weapons included the [[Bren]] LMG in both .303\" and 7.62mm NATO, [[Sten]] SMG, [[Uzi]], [[Browning Hi-Power]] pistol, Colt [[M16 rifle]] (very late in the war), [[FN MAG]] (FN MAG58) general-purpose machine-gun, [[L16 81mm Mortar|81 mm mortar]], and [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore]] mines. After [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|UDI]], Rhodesia was heavily reliant on South African and domestically produced weapons and equipment, as well as international smuggling operations, commonly referred to as \"sanction-busting\".<ref name=smith109116/> South Africa provided extensive support to Rhodesia in the form of a Lend / Lease program and both the official and unofficial support of many branches of the South African armed forces.\n\nThe [[Rhodesian Air Force]] (RhAF) operated a variety of equipment and carried out numerous roles, with air power providing the Rhodesians with a significant advantage over their guerrilla enemy.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, p. 41\"/> The fleet consisted mainly of British aircraft and largely obsolete aircraft, such as the [[World War II]] vintage [[C-47 Skytrain|Douglas Dakota]] transport aircraft and the British [[de Havilland Vampire]]. The arms embargo caused a lack of spare parts from external suppliers and RhAF had to find alternative means to keep its aircraft flying. The larger South African Air Force provided extensive training, aircraft and aircrews in support of RhAF operations from 1966. The Rhodesians also used more modern types of aircraft like the [[Hawker Hunter]] and [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] bombers, the [[Cessna Skymaster]] as well as [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III]] (SA316) helicopters until they were supplemented by the [[Bell 205|Agusta Bell 205]].<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, p. 41\"/> Very late in the war, the Rhodesian forces were able to smuggle and use a few Agusta Bell [[UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brent|1987|p=14}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the war, much of Rhodesia's military hardware was of British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] origin, but during the course of the conflict, new equipment such as [[Eland Mk7|Eland armoured cars]] were procured from South Africa. Several Polish-made [[T-55]] tanks destined for [[Idi Amin]]'s regime in Uganda were diverted to Rhodesia by the South Africans, in the last year of the war.<ref name=\"bindaQuartz\">{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|pp=462\u2013472}}</ref> The Rhodesians also produced a wide range of wheeled [[MRAP|mine-proofed armoured vehicles]], often using Mercedes [[Unimog]], [[Land Rover]] and [[Bedford trucks|Bedford]] truck components, including unlicensed copies of the [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[UR-416]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid-Daly|Stiff|1983|p=425}}</ref>\n\nDuring the course of the war, most white citizens carried personal weapons, and it was not unusual to see white housewives carrying [[submachine gun]]s. A [[siege mentality]] set in and all civilian transport had to be escorted in convoys for safety against ambushes. Farms and villages in rural areas were frequently attacked by guerrillas.\n\nThe Rhodesian government divided the country into eight geographical operational areas: North West Border (Operation Ranger), Eastern Border (Operation Thrasher), North East Border (Operation Hurricane), South East Border (Operation Repulse), Midlands (Operation Grapple), Kariba (Operation Splinter), Matabeleland (Operation Tangent), [[Harare|Salisbury]] and District (\"SALOPS\").\n{{clear}}\n\n===Nationalist guerrilla forces===\nThe two major armed groups campaigning against [[Ian Smith]]'s government were the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA), the armed wing of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), and the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA), the armed wing of the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU). The fighting was largely rural, as the two rival movements tried to win peasant support and to recruit fighters while harassing the administration and the white civilians. To ensure local domination, ZANLA and ZIPRA sometimes fought against each other as well as against the security forces.<ref name=bennett/>\n\n====ZANLA====\n{{Main|Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army}}\nZANLA was the armed wing of ZANU.<ref name=\"binda48\"/> The organisation also had strong links with [[Mozambique]]'s independence movement, [[FRELIMO]]. ZANLA, in the end, was present on a more or less permanent basis in over half the country, as evidenced by the location of the demobilisation bases at the end of the war, which were in every province except [[Matabeleland North]].<ref name=\"demobbases\">{{Harvnb|Martin|Johnson|1981|p=321}}</ref> In addition, they were fighting a civil war against ZIPRA, despite the formation of a joint front by their political parties after 1978.<ref name=bennett/> It was ZANLA's intention to occupy the ground, supplant the administration in rural areas, and then mount the final conventional campaign. ZANLA concentrated on the politicisation of the rural areas using force, persuasion, ties of kinship and collaboration with spirit mediums.<ref name=\"kriger51\">{{Harvnb|Kriger|2003|p=51}}</ref>\n\nZANLA tried to paralyse the Rhodesian effort and economy by planting Soviet anti-tank [[land mine]]s on the roads. From 1972 to 1980 there were 2,504 vehicle detonations of land mines (mainly Soviet TM46s), killing 632 people and injuring 4,410. Mining of roads increased 33.7% from 1978 (894 mines or 2.44 mines were detonated or recovered per day) to 1979 (2,089 mines or 5.72 mines a day).<ref name=\"woodsummary\">{{cite news |title=Rhodesian Insurgency |last=Wood |first=J.

In contrast to ZANLA's [[Mozambique]] links, Nkomo's ZIPRA was more oriented towards [[Zambia]] for local bases. However, this was not always with full Zambian government support: by 1979, the combined forces based in Zambia of ZIPRA, ''[[Umkhonto we Sizwe]]'' (the armed wing of the [[African National Congress]] of South Africa) and South-West African [[SWAPO]] fighters were a major threat to Zambia's internal security. Because [[ZAPU]]'s political strategy relied more heavily on negotiations than armed force, ZIPRA grew slower and less elaborately than ZANLA, but by 1979 it had an estimated 20,000 combatants, almost all based in camps around Lusaka, Zambia.\n\nZIPRA was responsible for two attacks on civilian [[Air Rhodesia]] Viscount aeroplanes, [[Air Rhodesia Flight 825|on 3 September 1978]] and [[Air Rhodesia Flight 827|12 February 1979]]. Using [[Strela 2|SA-7]] [[surface-to-air missile]]s, the guerrillas shot down each plane during its ascent from Kariba Airport.<ref name=viscount1/><ref name=viscount2/> ZIPRA took advice from its Soviet instructors in formulating its vision and strategy of popular revolution. About 1,400 Soviets, 700 East German and 500 Cuban instructors were deployed to the area.<ref name=\"newsatelier\">{{cite news |title=Afrikaserie: Simbabwe (Africa Series: Zimbabwe) |first=Walter |last=Doebler |location=Ottersweier |url=http://www.newsatelier.de/html/simbabwe.html |work=newsatelier.de |language=German |date=22 July 2006 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn the advice of the Soviets, ZIPRA built up its conventional forces, and motorised with Soviet armoured vehicles and a number of small aeroplanes,<ref>{{Harvnb|Dabengwa|1995|loc=chpt. ZIPRA in the Zimbabwe War of National Liberation}}</ref> in Zambia. ZIPRA's (i.e. ZAPU's) intention was to allow ZANLA to bring the Rhodesian forces to the point of defeat, and then take the victory from the much lighter forces of ZANLA and the essentially defeated Rhodesians. ZIPRA kept a light presence within Rhodesia, reconnoitring, keeping contact with the peasants and sometimes skirmishing with ZANLA.<ref name=\"Dabengwa 1995 48\u201372\">{{Harvnb|Dabengwa|1995|pp=48\u201372}}</ref>\n\nZIPRA's conventional threat partly distracted Rhodesian forces from fighting ZANLA. By the late 1970s, ZIPRA had developed a strategy known as ''Storming the Heavens'' to launch a conventional invasion from Zambia, supported by a limited number of armoured vehicles and light aircraft. An operation by the Rhodesian armed forces to destroy a ZIPRA base near Livingstone in Zambia was never launched.<ref name=\"Dabengwa 1995 48\u201372\"/>\n\nThe ZAPU/ZIPRA strategy for taking over Zimbabwe proved unsuccessful. In any event, the transfer of power to black nationalists took place not by the military take-over expected by ZAPU/ZIPRA, but by a peaceful and internationally supervised election. Rhodesia reverted briefly to British rule, and a general election took place in early 1980. This election was supervised both by the UK and international forces.\n\nRobert Mugabe (of ZANLA/ZANU) won this election, because he was the only major competitor of the majority ethnicity, Shona. Once in power, Mugabe was internationally recognised as Zimbabwe's leader and was installed as head of government, and had the backing of the overwhelming majority ethnic group. He was therefore able to quickly and irreversibly consolidate his power, forcing ZAPU, and therefore ZIPRA which was ZAPU's army, to give up hope of taking over the country in the place of ZANU/ZANLA.\n\n==Pre-war events==\n\n===Civil disobedience (1957\u20131964)===\n[[File:Rhodesialand.png|thumb|upright=1.3|In 1962, Rhodesia was split about equally between black ''(orange and purple)'' and white ''(yellow)'' areas.

It set up a strong defense along the [[Zambezi River]] running from [[Lake Kariba]] to the Mozambique border. Here 30-man camps were established at 8-kilometre intervals supported by mobile rapid reaction units. From 1966 to 1970, these defences accounted for 175 insurgents killed for the loss of 14 defenders.<ref name=\"Britannica 1971 259\"/> The conflict continued at a low level until 21 December 1972 when ZANLA conducted the [[attack on Altena Farm]] in north-east Rhodesia.

In response, SAS troops were inserted into Mozambique with the approval of the Portuguese administration, in the first officially sanctioned external operation. The Rhodesian government began authorising an increasing number of external operations.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, pp. 39-40\" />\n\nIn the first phase of the conflict (until the end of 1972), Rhodesia's political and military position was strong. Nationalist guerrillas did not make serious inroads. In the early 1970s, the two main nationalist groups faced serious internal divisions, aid from the [[Organisation of African Unity]] was temporarily suspended in 1971, and 129 nationalists were expelled from Zambia after they were alleged to have plotted against President [[Kenneth Kaunda]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Britannica|1972|p=235}}</ref>\n\nBritain's efforts to isolate Rhodesia economically had not produced major compromises by the Smith Government. Indeed, late in 1971 the British and Rhodesian Governments had negotiated a compromise political settlement which would have bowed to the Smith Government's agenda of postponing majority rule into the indefinite future. Nevertheless, when it was found that such a delayed approach to majority rule was unacceptable to most of Rhodesia's African population, the deal fell apart.<ref name=\"Ryan\">{{Harvnb|Ryan|2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Rhodesia joined [[Alcora Exercise]], a secret defensive alliance for Southern Africa, formalised in 1970 by Portugal and South Africa. Alcora formalised and deepened the political and military co-operation between the three countries against the revolutionary insurgency in Rhodesia, Angola, Mozambique and [[South West Africa]] and against the hostile neighbouring countries.\n\nHowever, the end of Portuguese rule in Mozambique created new military and political pressures on the Rhodesian Government to accept the principle of immediate majority rule.\n\n===Second phase (1972\u20131979)===\n{{for|Rhodesian Army counter-insurgency tactics|Fireforce}}\n[[File:Rhodesian reservists on patrol.jpg|thumb|upright|Rhodesian reservist soldiers on patrol with [[FN FAL]] rifles during the 1970s.]]\nThe black nationalists continued to operate from secluded bases in neighbouring [[Zambia]] and from [[FRELIMO]]-controlled areas in the Portuguese colony of [[Mozambique]], making periodic raids into [[Rhodesia]]. By 1973, guerrilla activity was increasing in the aftermath of the Altena Farm raid, particularly in the northeast part of the country where portions of the African population were evacuated from border areas, and compulsory military service for whites was extended to one year.<ref>{{Harvnb|Britannica|1974|p=600}}</ref> As the war intensified, conscription was raised to men between the ages of 38 and 50, though this was modified in 1977.

A transitional government was formed within months and Mozambique became independent under FRELIMO rule on 25 June 1975.

Even overt South African support for Rhodesia was waning. South Africa began scaling back economic assistance to Rhodesia, placed limits on the amount of fuel and munitions being supplied to the Rhodesian military, and withdrew the personnel and equipment they had previously provided to aid the war effort, including a border police unit that had been helping guard the Rhodesia-Zambia border.<ref>{{Harvnb|Britannica|1976|pp=619\u2013620}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, the length of active military service was extended to 18 months; this took effect immediately, with soldiers about to end their one-year service finding their active service extended. Even after discharge from regular service, white men entered the reserve forces, and were often called up for duty and subjected to long military service. In addition, Rhodesia recruited black men to volunteer for military service; by 1976, half of the Rhodesian Army was composed of black soldiers. Although some raised questions about their loyalty, the Rhodesian government stated that it had no doubts about their loyalty, and planned to train black officers. Legislation to conscript blacks was introduced and came in effect in 1979, but the response to call-ups was poor. Rhodesia also recruited foreign volunteers for service, with groups of foreigners who served in Rhodesia including the [[The Crippled Eagles|Crippled Eagles]] and [[7 Independent Company (Rhodesia)|7 Independent Company]].<ref name=fall>{{cite web |url=http://www.popularsocialscience.com/2012/10/19/the-fall-of-rhodesia/ |title=The Fall of Rhodesia |publisher=Popularsocialscience.com |date=19 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/681613642.html?dids=681613642:681613642&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+26%2C+1976&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Rhodesia+to+Seek+More+Black+Soldiers&pqatl=google |title=Los Angeles Times: Archives \u2013 Rhodesia to Seek More Black Soldiers |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=26 November 1976}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Black Conscription Protestors Arrested |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19781125&id=XgMuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XaEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5461,2563770 |accessdate=14 October 2014 |work=The Montreal Gazette |agency=Reuters |date=25 November 1978}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Rhodesians add six months to Conscription |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=muZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HuEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6527,1218119 |accessdate=14 October 2014 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |agency=UPI |date=5 May 1976}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Many Blacks ignore call-up in Rhodesia |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat=19790112&id=fv9jAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UOcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3506,2527817 |accessdate=14 October 2014 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |agency=AAP-Reuter |date=12 January 1979}}</ref>\n\nLate in 1976, Ian Smith accepted the basic elements of the compromise proposals made by US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] to introduce majority rule within two years.<ref>{{cite news |title=White rule in Rhodesia to end |publisher=BBC |location=London |date=23 September 1976 |accessdate=19 October 2011 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/24/newsid_2537000/2537969.stm}}</ref> The Smith Government then sought to negotiate an acceptable settlement with moderate black leaders, while retaining strong white influence in key areas.

When all was ready a Rhodesian soldier took his vehicle loudspeaker and announced, in Shona, \"''Zimbabwe tatora''\", meaning \"we have taken Zimbabwe\", and Nyathi blew a whistle signalling the cadres to muster. The cadres began cheering and ran towards the vehicles, packing around them as more ran onto the parade ground from other areas of the camp.<ref name=\"lohman4\"/>\n\nThe Rhodesians then opened fire and continued shooting until there was no movement on the parade ground, then they returned to Rhodesia.

Nkomo claimed responsibility for the attack and spoke of it to the [[BBC]] in a way Rhodesians considered gloating.<ref name=\"viscount1\">{{cite news |title=Rhodesia: Seeds of Political Destruction |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916377,00.html |location=New York |work=Time |date=18 September 1978 |accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref> In the second attack all 59 people on board were killed in the crash.<ref name=\"viscount2\">{{cite news |title=59 killed in Viscount Disaster |work=The Rhodesia Herald |date=13 February 1979 }}</ref>\n\nIn retaliation for the shooting down of Flight 825 in September 1978, Rhodesian Air Force Canberra bombers, Hunter fighter-bombers and helicopter gunships attacked the ZIPRA guerrilla base at Westlands farm near Lusaka in October 1978, warning Zambian forces by radio not to interfere.<ref>{{Harvnb|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|pp=140\u2013143}}</ref>\n\nThe increased effectiveness of the bombing and follow-up 'air mobile' strikes using [[C-47 Skytrain|Dakota]]-dropped parachutists and helicopter 'air cav' techniques had a significant effect on the development of the conflict. As late as September 1979, despite the increased sophistication of guerrilla forces in Mozambique, a raid by Selous Scouts, with artillery and air support, on \"New Chimoio\" still reportedly resulted in heavy ZANLA casualties.{{#tag:ref|The increased guerrilla capabilities were evident during that raid in that the insurgents, now armed with Soviet surface-to-air missiles, were able to shoot down a Rhodesian helicopter, killing all 12 on board.<ref name=\"beckett2\">{{Harvnb|Beckett|2007}}</ref>|group=\"n\"}} However, a successful raid on the Rhodesian strategic fuel reserves in [[Harare|Salisbury]] also underscored the importance of concluding a negotiated settlement and achieving international recognition before the war expanded further.\n\n====Military pressure====\nThe larger problem was that by 1979, combined ZIPRA and ZANLA strength inside Rhodesia totalled at least 12,500 guerrillas and it was evident that insurgents were entering the country at a faster rate than the Rhodesian forces could kill or capture. In addition, 22,000 ZIPRA and 16,000 ZANLA fighters remained uncommitted outside the country.<ref name=beckett2/> Joshua Nkomo's ZIPRA forces were preparing their forces in Zambia with the intent of confronting the Rhodesians through a conventional invasion. Whether such an invasion could have been successful in the short term against the well trained Rhodesian army and air force is questionable. However, what was clear was that the insurgency was growing in strength daily and the ability of the security forces to continue to control the entire country was coming under serious challenge.<ref name=lohman4/>\n\nBy putting the civilian population at risk, ZIPRA and the ZANLA had been particularly effective in creating conditions that accelerated white emigration. This not only seriously undermined the morale of the white population, it was also gradually reducing the availability of trained reserves for the army and the police. For a discussion see: {{Main|Rhodesia Regiment}} The economy was also suffering badly from the war; the Rhodesian GDP consistently declined in the late 1970s.<ref name=beckett2/> Part of the economic decline was due to white men being called up for extended periods of military service, which also affected many Rhodesian families.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nPolitically, the Rhodesians were therefore pinning all their hopes on the \"internal\" political settlement that had been negotiated with moderate black nationalist leaders in 1978 and its ability to achieve external recognition and support. This internal settlement led to the creation of [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]] under a new constitution in 1979.\n\n===Resolution===\nUnder the agreement of March 1978, the country was renamed [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]], and in the general election of 24 April 1979, Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]] became the country's first black prime minister. On 1 June 1979, [[Josiah Zion Gumede]] became President. The internal settlement left control of the military, police, civil service, and judiciary in white hands, and assured whites about one-third of the seats in parliament. It was essentially a power-sharing arrangement between whites and blacks.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/1/newsid_2492000/2492915.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1 &#124; 1979: End of white rule in Rhodesia |work=BBC News |date=18 April 1980}}</ref> The factions led by Nkomo and Mugabe denounced the new government as a puppet of white Rhodesians and fighting continued. The hoped for recognition of the internal settlement, and of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, by the newly elected [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] did not materialise after the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|latter's election]] in May 1979. Likewise, although the US Senate voted to lift sanctions against Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, the [[Carter administration]] also refused to recognise the internal settlement.\n\nWhile Prime Minister Thatcher clearly sympathized with the internal settlement and thought of the ZANLA and ZIPRA leaders as terrorists, she was prepared to support a push for further compromise if it could end the fighting.<ref>{{cite news |title=Margaret Thatcher blocked talks with 'Terrorist' Mugabe |url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-12-30-margaret-thatcher-blocked-talks-with-terrorist-mugabe |first=Katherine |last=Haddon |location=London |newspaper=[[Mail & Guardian]] |date=30 December 2009 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref> Britain was also reluctant to recognise the internal settlement for fear of fracturing the unity of the [[Commonwealth]]. Thus later in 1979, the Thatcher government called a peace conference in London to which all nationalist leaders were invited.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998 65\">{{Harvnb|Rogers|1998|p=65}}</ref>\n[[File:ZIPRA battalion.jpg|thumb|Member of the Commonwealth Monitoring Force supervising a ZIPRA assembly point.]]\nThe outcome of this conference would become known as the [[Lancaster House Agreement]]. During the conference, the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian Government accepted a watering down of the 1978 internal settlement while Mugabe and Nkomo agreed to end the war in exchange for new elections in which they could participate. The economic sanctions imposed on Rhodesia were lifted in late 1979, and the country reverted to temporary British rule until elections could be held. Under the Constitution of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia (Amendment) (No. 4) Act 1979 of 11 December 1979, the country formally reverted to its colonial status as Southern Rhodesia. The Zimbabwe-Rhodesian parliament voted itself out of power, and [[Christopher Soames, Baron Soames|Lord Soames]] was appointed by the British government to rule the country as Governor-Designate, arriving in Salisbury on 12 December to take over from President Gumede.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/11/newsid_3950000/3950445.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 11 &#124; 1979: Rhodesia reverts to British rule |work=BBC News |date=11 December 1941}}</ref> On 21 December 1979, a cease-fire was announced.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998 65\"/> An election was scheduled for early 1980.

Britain contributed 800 soldiers and 300 [[Royal Air Force]] personnel, along with small naval and marine contingents. Australia, [[Fiji]], [[Kenya]], and [[New Zealand]] also contributed smaller numbers of troops.

We reached a political settlement... A compromise.\"<ref name=k;a;vav />\n\nDuring the [[Zimbabwean parliamentary election, 1980|election of 1980]], there were accusations of voter intimidation by Mugabe's guerrilla cadres, sections of which were accused of not having assembled in the designated guerrilla assembly points as required under the Lancaster House Agreement, and the international observers as well as Lord Soames were accused of looking the other way. The Rhodesian military may have seriously considered a coup d'\u00e9tat in March 1980.<ref name=bindaQuartz/> This alleged coup was to consist of two stages: [[Operation Quartz]], coordinated attacks on guerrilla assembly points within the country, and Operation Hectic, the assassination of Mugabe and his key aides.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rhodesia.nl/quartz.htm |title=Operation Quartz \u2013 Rhodesia 1980 |publisher=Rhodesia.nl |date=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, even in the context of alleged voter intimidation by ZANLA elements, widespread support for Mugabe from large sections of the black population (in particular from the [[Shona people|Shona]] language group which made up the overwhelming majority of the country's population) could not be seriously disputed. Moreover, the clear absence of any external support for such a coup, and the inevitable conflagration that would have engulfed the country thereafter, scuttled the plan.<ref name=bindaQuartz/>\n\nThe election of early 1980 was won by Mugabe, who became prime minister after [[Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front|ZANU-PF]] received 63% of the vote. By 16 March 1980, all Commonwealth forces had departed, save for 40 infantry instructors who temporarily stayed behind to train the new nation's army.<ref name=britains-smallwars/> On 18 April 1980, interim British rule ended and the country was internationally recognised as independent. The colony of Southern Rhodesia was formally renamed Zimbabwe, and on 18 April 1982, the government changed the name of the country's capital from Salisbury to [[Harare]].\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Main|Zimbabwe|Robert Mugabe}}\nAccording to Rhodesian government statistics, more than 20,000 were killed during the war. From December 1972 to December 1979, 1,120 members of the Rhodesian security forces were killed, along with 10,050 guerrillas who were killed in Rhodesia, and an unknown number in Mozambique and Zambia, 7,790 black civilians, and 468 white civilians.<ref name=fall/>\n\nAfter he assumed power, [[Robert Mugabe]] acted incrementally to consolidate his power, forming a coalition government with his ZAPU rivals and the white minority. The Rhodesian Army was merged with guerrilla forces to form the [[Zimbabwe Defence Forces]], and the Rhodesian security forces were merged with ZANLA and ZIPRA forces. Joshua Nkomo was given a series of cabinet positions.\n\nHowever, Mugabe was torn between keeping his coalition stable and pressures to meet the expectations of his followers for social change. Clashes between ZANLA and ZIPRA forces took place in 1980 and 1981. In February 1982, Mugabe fired Nkomo and two other ZAPU ministers from his cabinet, triggering bitter fighting between ZAPU supporters in [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]]-speaking region of the country and the ruling ZANU. Between 1982 and 1985, the military crushed armed resistance from Ndebele groups in [[Matabeleland]] and the [[Midlands, Zimbabwe|Midlands]] in a military crackdown known as ''[[Gukurahundi]]'', a Shona term which translates roughly to mean \"the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains\". The ''Gukurahundi'' campaigns were also known as the Matabeleland Massacres.<ref name=\"watch\">{{Harvnb|Nyarota|2006\n|p=134}}</ref>\n\nThe Zimbabwean military's North Korean-trained [[Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade|Fifth Brigade]] was deployed to Matabeleland to crush resistance.

In December 1987, the two groups reached an accord which saw them merge into one party known as [[ZANU PF]], headed by Mugabe. Mugabe then became President and gained additional powers, as the office of Prime Minister was abolished.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nBeyond Zimbabwe's borders, as a result of Rhodesian aid and support for [[RENAMO]], the Rhodesian Bush War also helped influence the outbreak of the [[Mozambique Civil War]], which lasted from 1977 until 1992. That conflict claimed over a million lives, and made some five million people homeless.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n=== Popular culture ===\nA number of books and films are set during the Bush War.\n\nFilms include:\n* [[Albino (film)|''Albino'' (1976 film)]] \u2013 a German thriller based on the novel ''The Whispering Death'' by Daniel Carney\n* [[Game for Vultures|''A Game For Vultures'' (1979 film)]] \u2013 British made thriller set during the war.\n* [[Shamwari (film)|''Shamwari'' (1982 film)]] - thriller starring [[Ian Yule]] and [[Ken Gampu]] set in [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] during the war.\n* [[Blind Justice (1988 film)|''Blind Justice'' (1988 film)]] \u2013 British film set during the early part of the war.

The country returned temporarily to British control and new elections were held under British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] supervision in March 1980. ZANU won the election and Mugabe became the first [[Prime Minister of Zimbabwe]] on 18 April 1980, when the country achieved internationally recognised independence.\n\n==Background==\nThe origin of the war in [[Rhodesia]] can be traced to the conquest of the region by the [[British South Africa Company]] in the late 19th century, and the dissent of native leaders who opposed foreign rule.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, p. 37\">{{Harvnb|Rogers|1998|p=37}}</ref> Britons began settling in Southern Rhodesia from the 1890s, and while it was never accorded full [[dominion]] status, these settlers effectively governed the country after 1923.\n\nIn his famous \"[[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]]\" speech, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Harold Macmillan]] revealed Britain's new policy to only permit independence to its African colonies under majority rule.<ref name=wessels6873/> But many white Rhodesians were concerned that such immediate change would cause chaos [[Congo Crisis|as had resulted]] in the former [[Belgian Congo]] after its independence in 1960.<ref name=\"wessels6873\">{{Harvnb|Wessels|2010|pp=68\u201373}}</ref>\n\nBritain's unwillingness to compromise led to Rhodesia's [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|unilateral declaration of independence]] (UDI) on 11 November 1965. Although Rhodesia had the private support of neighbouring South Africa and [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]], which still owned [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], it never gained formal diplomatic recognition from any country.<ref name=\"wood2008p6\">{{Harvnb|Wood|2008|p=6}}</ref><ref name=\"smith109116\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|pp=109\u2013116}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the vote in Rhodesia was constitutionally open to all, regardless of race, property requirements left many blacks unable to participate.<ref name=\"pbharris\">{{Harvnb|Harris|1969|pp=72\u201380}}</ref> The new 1969 constitution reserved eight seats in the [[Politics of Rhodesia#1969 ('UDI') Constitution|66 seat parliament]] for \"Non-Europeans\" only, with a further eight reserved for tribal chiefs.\n\nAmidst this backdrop, [[African nationalist]]s advocated armed struggle to bring about black rule, primarily denouncing the wealth disparity between the races. Two rival nationalist organisations emerged in August 1963: the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) and the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), after disagreements about tactics, as well as tribalism and personality clashes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sibanda|2005\n|p=321}}</ref> ZANU and its military wing [[ZANLA]] were headed by [[Robert Mugabe]] and consisted primarily of [[Shona language|Shona]] tribes.

[[Ian Smith]] further expounded this by portraying the conflict as primarily anti-communist in nature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Michael|date=June 2007|title=The Wretched of the Empire: Politics, Ideology and Counterinsurgency in Rhodesia, 1965\u201380|journal=Small Wars & Insurgencies|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=175\u2013195|doi=10.1080/09574040701400601|issn=0959-2318}}</ref> The Rhodesian whites, and a percentage of well-off blacks, viewed the British demand for majority-rule as a direct attack on their way of life. Having previously witnesses the communist redistribution of resources after the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Mau Rebellion]], Rhodesians refused to allow the majority-rule policy to come into effect. Much of the Rhodesian economy as well as the land was controlled by white Rhodesians, and, fearing total confiscation by either the ZIPRA or ZANLA, the RF elected to hold onto the unofficial minority-rule. In ignoring other contributing factors to the conflict, Smith and the RF were able to strengthen ties with the West, however, Britain remained neutral. The division between the communists and anti-communists caused the fighting to spill over the Rhodesian borders. Neighboring African nations, supported primarily by North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, utilized communist material support to begin launching guerrilla attacks on the RF.\n\nThe United States took the official position that it would not recognize Rhodesia as an independent sovereign. However, many American soldiers who had seen combat in Vietnam quickly joined into the Rhodesian Front. The RF created advertising campaigns in order to attract soldiers from Western countries, and the RF amassed a force of nearly 1,400 soldiers that were highly trained in special forces and guerrilla warfare, bringing the total RF military force to over 10,000 men. Many of the professional American soldiers entering the RF directly into the force became de facto members of the Rhodesian government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vvaveteran.org/32-2/32-2_rhodesia.html|title=The VVA Veteran, a publication of Vietnam Veterans of America|website=vvaveteran.org|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union became extremely invested in the Rhodesian Bush War.

The Nationalists considered their country occupied and dominated by a foreign power, namely Britain, since 1890.<ref name=\"binda48\">{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|p=48}}</ref>\n\nThe British government, in the person of the [[Governor of Southern Rhodesia|Governor]], had indirectly ruled the country from 1923, when it took over from the [[British South Africa Company]] and granted [[self-governing colony|self-governing status]] to a locally elected government, made up predominantly of Whites. Ian Smith's [[Rhodesian Front]] party was elected to power in 1962 and [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] on 11 November 1965 to preserve what it saw as the self-government it had possessed since 1923.<ref name=\"binda48\"/>\n\nThe Rhodesian government contended that it was defending Western values, Christianity, the [[rule of law]] and democracy by fighting Communists, but it was unwilling to compromise on most political, economic and social inequalities. The Smith administration claimed that the legitimate voice of the black Shona and Ndebele population were the traditional chiefs, not the ZANU and ZAPU nationalists, whom it regarded as dangerous, violent usurpers.<ref name=\"wood2008542\">{{Harvnb|Wood|2008|pp=542\u2013555}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978\u20131979, the Smith administration tried to blunt the power of the nationalist cause by acceding to an \"Internal Settlement\" which ended minority rule, changed the name of the country to [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]], and arranged multiracial elections, which were held [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia general election, 1979|in 1979]] and won by Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]], who became the country's first Black head of government. Unsatisfied with this and spurred on by Britain's refusal to recognise the new order, the nationalist forces persisted.\n\nThe war ended when, at the behest of both South Africa (its major supporter) and the United States, the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian government ceded power to Britain in the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] in December 1979. The UK Government held another election [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980|in 1980]] to form a new government. The election was won by ZANU. The new government, headed by [[Robert Mugabe]], was recognised internationally, and the country was renamed [[Zimbabwe]].\n\n==Belligerents==\n\n===Rhodesian Security Forces===\n{{main|Rhodesian Security Forces}}\n[[File:Rhodesian African Rifles, Lake Kariba, December 1976, 3.png|thumb|upright|Two soldiers of the [[Rhodesian African Rifles]] aboard a patrol boat on [[Lake Kariba]], December 1976.

While the regular army consisted of a professional core of white soldiers (and some units, such as the [[Rhodesian SAS]] and the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]], were all-white), by 1978\u20131979 the rest was majority black.<ref name=\"lohman3\">{{Harvnb|Lohman|MacPherson|1983|loc=chpt. 3}}</ref>\n\nBy contrast, army reserves were largely white, and toward the end of the war were increasingly called up to deal with the growing insurgency. The regular army was supported by the para-military [[British South Africa Police]] of about 8,000 to 11,000 men (the majority of whom were black) and 19,000 to 35,000 police reservists (which, like their army counterparts, were largely white). The police reserves acted as a type of home guard.<ref name=\"lohman3\"/>\n\nThe war saw the extensive operation of Rhodesian regulars as well as elite units such as the [[Selous Scouts]] and the [[Rhodesian Special Air Service|Rhodesian SAS]]. The [[Rhodesian Army]] fought bitterly against the black nationalist guerrillas. The Rhodesian Army also comprised mostly black regiments such as the [[Rhodesian African Rifles]]. As the war went on, the frequent call-up of reservists was increasingly used to supplement the professional soldiers and the many volunteers from overseas.<ref name=\"abbott17\">{{Harvnb|Abbott|Botham|1986|p=17}}</ref><ref name=\"binda186188\">{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|pp=186\u2013188}}</ref>\n\nBy 1978, all white men up to the age of 60 were subject to periodic call-up to the army; younger men up to 35 might expect to spend alternating blocks of six weeks in the army and at home. Many of the overseas volunteers came from Britain, Ireland, South Africa, Portugal, Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America with the latter three being held in high regard for their recent [[Vietnam War]] experience.<ref name=\"abbott17\"/><ref name=\"binda186188\"/>\n\nConsidering the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 232|arms embargo]], the Rhodesian Army was well-equipped. The standard infantry weapon was the Belgian [[FN FAL]] Rifle as produced in South Africa under license as the R1 Rifle and supplemented by the [[H&K G3]] rifle that came from Portuguese forces. However, other weapons such as the British L1A1 ('SLR') variant of the FAL and the older British [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] [[bolt-action]] rifle were used by reservists and the [[British South Africa Police]]. Other weapons included the [[Bren]] LMG in both .303\" and 7.62mm NATO, [[Sten]] SMG, [[Uzi]], [[Browning Hi-Power]] pistol, Colt [[M16 rifle]] (very late in the war), [[FN MAG]] (FN MAG58) general-purpose machine-gun, [[L16 81mm Mortar|81 mm mortar]], and [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore]] mines. After [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|UDI]], Rhodesia was heavily reliant on South African and domestically produced weapons and equipment, as well as international smuggling operations, commonly referred to as \"sanction-busting\".<ref name=smith109116/> South Africa provided extensive support to Rhodesia in the form of a Lend / Lease program and both the official and unofficial support of many branches of the South African armed forces.\n\nThe [[Rhodesian Air Force]] (RhAF) operated a variety of equipment and carried out numerous roles, with air power providing the Rhodesians with a significant advantage over their guerrilla enemy.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, p. 41\"/> The fleet consisted mainly of British aircraft and largely obsolete aircraft, such as the [[World War II]] vintage [[C-47 Skytrain|Douglas Dakota]] transport aircraft and the British [[de Havilland Vampire]]. The arms embargo caused a lack of spare parts from external suppliers and RhAF had to find alternative means to keep its aircraft flying. The larger South African Air Force provided extensive training, aircraft and aircrews in support of RhAF operations from 1966. The Rhodesians also used more modern types of aircraft like the [[Hawker Hunter]] and [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] bombers, the [[Cessna Skymaster]] as well as [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III]] (SA316) helicopters until they were supplemented by the [[Bell 205|Agusta Bell 205]].<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, p. 41\"/> Very late in the war, the Rhodesian forces were able to smuggle and use a few Agusta Bell [[UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brent|1987|p=14}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the war, much of Rhodesia's military hardware was of British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] origin, but during the course of the conflict, new equipment such as [[Eland Mk7|Eland armoured cars]] were procured from South Africa. Several Polish-made [[T-55]] tanks destined for [[Idi Amin]]'s regime in Uganda were diverted to Rhodesia by the South Africans, in the last year of the war.<ref name=\"bindaQuartz\">{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|pp=462\u2013472}}</ref> The Rhodesians also produced a wide range of wheeled [[MRAP|mine-proofed armoured vehicles]], often using Mercedes [[Unimog]], [[Land Rover]] and [[Bedford trucks|Bedford]] truck components, including unlicensed copies of the [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[UR-416]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid-Daly|Stiff|1983|p=425}}</ref>\n\nDuring the course of the war, most white citizens carried personal weapons, and it was not unusual to see white housewives carrying [[submachine gun]]s. A [[siege mentality]] set in and all civilian transport had to be escorted in convoys for safety against ambushes. Farms and villages in rural areas were frequently attacked by guerrillas.\n\nThe Rhodesian government divided the country into eight geographical operational areas: North West Border (Operation Ranger), Eastern Border (Operation Thrasher), North East Border (Operation Hurricane), South East Border (Operation Repulse), Midlands (Operation Grapple), Kariba (Operation Splinter), Matabeleland (Operation Tangent), [[Harare|Salisbury]] and District (\"SALOPS\").\n{{clear}}\n\n===Nationalist guerrilla forces===\nThe two major armed groups campaigning against [[Ian Smith]]'s government were the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA), the armed wing of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), and the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA), the armed wing of the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU). The fighting was largely rural, as the two rival movements tried to win peasant support and to recruit fighters while harassing the administration and the white civilians. To ensure local domination, ZANLA and ZIPRA sometimes fought against each other as well as against the security forces.<ref name=bennett/>\n\n====ZANLA====\n{{Main|Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army}}\nZANLA was the armed wing of ZANU.<ref name=\"binda48\"/> The organisation also had strong links with [[Mozambique]]'s independence movement, [[FRELIMO]]. ZANLA, in the end, was present on a more or less permanent basis in over half the country, as evidenced by the location of the demobilisation bases at the end of the war, which were in every province except [[Matabeleland North]].<ref name=\"demobbases\">{{Harvnb|Martin|Johnson|1981|p=321}}</ref> In addition, they were fighting a civil war against ZIPRA, despite the formation of a joint front by their political parties after 1978.<ref name=bennett/> It was ZANLA's intention to occupy the ground, supplant the administration in rural areas, and then mount the final conventional campaign. ZANLA concentrated on the politicisation of the rural areas using force, persuasion, ties of kinship and collaboration with spirit mediums.<ref name=\"kriger51\">{{Harvnb|Kriger|2003|p=51}}</ref>\n\nZANLA tried to paralyse the Rhodesian effort and economy by planting Soviet anti-tank [[land mine]]s on the roads. From 1972 to 1980 there were 2,504 vehicle detonations of land mines (mainly Soviet TM46s), killing 632 people and injuring 4,410. Mining of roads increased 33.7% from 1978 (894 mines or 2.44 mines were detonated or recovered per day) to 1979 (2,089 mines or 5.72 mines a day).<ref name=\"woodsummary\">{{cite news |title=Rhodesian Insurgency |last=Wood |first=J.

They began by replacing air in tyres with water which absorbed some of the blast and reduced the heat of the explosion. Initially, they protected the bodies with steel deflector plates, sandbags and mine conveyor belting.

In contrast to ZANLA's [[Mozambique]] links, Nkomo's ZIPRA was more oriented towards [[Zambia]] for local bases. However, this was not always with full Zambian government support: by 1979, the combined forces based in Zambia of ZIPRA, ''[[Umkhonto we Sizwe]]'' (the armed wing of the [[African National Congress]] of South Africa) and South-West African [[SWAPO]] fighters were a major threat to Zambia's internal security. Because [[ZAPU]]'s political strategy relied more heavily on negotiations than armed force, ZIPRA grew slower and less elaborately than ZANLA, but by 1979 it had an estimated 20,000 combatants, almost all based in camps around Lusaka, Zambia.\n\nZIPRA was responsible for two attacks on civilian [[Air Rhodesia]] Viscount aeroplanes, [[Air Rhodesia Flight 825|on 3 September 1978]] and [[Air Rhodesia Flight 827|12 February 1979]]. Using [[Strela 2|SA-7]] [[surface-to-air missile]]s, the guerrillas shot down each plane during its ascent from Kariba Airport.<ref name=viscount1/><ref name=viscount2/> ZIPRA took advice from its Soviet instructors in formulating its vision and strategy of popular revolution. About 1,400 Soviets, 700 East German and 500 Cuban instructors were deployed to the area.<ref name=\"newsatelier\">{{cite news |title=Afrikaserie: Simbabwe (Africa Series: Zimbabwe) |first=Walter |last=Doebler |location=Ottersweier |url=http://www.newsatelier.de/html/simbabwe.html |work=newsatelier.de |language=German |date=22 July 2006 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn the advice of the Soviets, ZIPRA built up its conventional forces, and motorised with Soviet armoured vehicles and a number of small aeroplanes,<ref>{{Harvnb|Dabengwa|1995|loc=chpt. ZIPRA in the Zimbabwe War of National Liberation}}</ref> in Zambia. ZIPRA's (i.e. ZAPU's) intention was to allow ZANLA to bring the Rhodesian forces to the point of defeat, and then take the victory from the much lighter forces of ZANLA and the essentially defeated Rhodesians. ZIPRA kept a light presence within Rhodesia, reconnoitring, keeping contact with the peasants and sometimes skirmishing with ZANLA.<ref name=\"Dabengwa 1995 48\u201372\">{{Harvnb|Dabengwa|1995|pp=48\u201372}}</ref>\n\nZIPRA's conventional threat partly distracted Rhodesian forces from fighting ZANLA. By the late 1970s, ZIPRA had developed a strategy known as ''Storming the Heavens'' to launch a conventional invasion from Zambia, supported by a limited number of armoured vehicles and light aircraft. An operation by the Rhodesian armed forces to destroy a ZIPRA base near Livingstone in Zambia was never launched.<ref name=\"Dabengwa 1995 48\u201372\"/>\n\nThe ZAPU/ZIPRA strategy for taking over Zimbabwe proved unsuccessful. In any event, the transfer of power to black nationalists took place not by the military take-over expected by ZAPU/ZIPRA, but by a peaceful and internationally supervised election. Rhodesia reverted briefly to British rule, and a general election took place in early 1980. This election was supervised both by the UK and international forces.\n\nRobert Mugabe (of ZANLA/ZANU) won this election, because he was the only major competitor of the majority ethnicity, Shona. Once in power, Mugabe was internationally recognised as Zimbabwe's leader and was installed as head of government, and had the backing of the overwhelming majority ethnic group. He was therefore able to quickly and irreversibly consolidate his power, forcing ZAPU, and therefore ZIPRA which was ZAPU's army, to give up hope of taking over the country in the place of ZANU/ZANLA.\n\n==Pre-war events==\n\n===Civil disobedience (1957\u20131964)===\n[[File:Rhodesialand.png|thumb|upright=1.3|In 1962, Rhodesia was split about equally between black ''(orange and purple)'' and white ''(yellow)'' areas.

While Nkomo initially supported the constitution, he reversed his position after other NDP leaders disagreed. The government banned the NDP in December 1961 and arrested NDP leaders, excluding Nkomo who, again, was out of the country.

The embargo meant the Rhodesia was hampered by a lack of modern equipment but it used other means to receive vital war supplies such as [[Petroleum|oil]], munitions, and arms via the [[apartheid]] government of South Africa. War material was also obtained through elaborate international smuggling schemes, domestic production, and captured infiltrating enemy combatants.<ref name=smith109116/>\n\nFive months later, on 28 April 1966, the Rhodesian Security Forces engaged militants in [[Sinoia]], during the [[Sinoia battle|first major engagement of the war]].<ref name=\"events\"/> Seven ZANLA men were killed, and in retaliation the survivors killed two civilians at their farm near Hartley three weeks later.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, p. 39\"/>\n\nDuring Portuguese rule of Mozambique, until 1974\u20131975, Rhodesia was able to defend its border with Zambia relatively easily and prevent many guerrilla incursions. It set up a strong defense along the [[Zambezi River]] running from [[Lake Kariba]] to the Mozambique border. Here 30-man camps were established at 8-kilometre intervals supported by mobile rapid reaction units. From 1966 to 1970, these defences accounted for 175 insurgents killed for the loss of 14 defenders.<ref name=\"Britannica 1971 259\"/> The conflict continued at a low level until 21 December 1972 when ZANLA conducted the [[attack on Altena Farm]] in north-east Rhodesia.

In response, SAS troops were inserted into Mozambique with the approval of the Portuguese administration, in the first officially sanctioned external operation. The Rhodesian government began authorising an increasing number of external operations.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, pp. 39-40\" />\n\nIn the first phase of the conflict (until the end of 1972), Rhodesia's political and military position was strong. Nationalist guerrillas did not make serious inroads. In the early 1970s, the two main nationalist groups faced serious internal divisions, aid from the [[Organisation of African Unity]] was temporarily suspended in 1971, and 129 nationalists were expelled from Zambia after they were alleged to have plotted against President [[Kenneth Kaunda]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Britannica|1972|p=235}}</ref>\n\nBritain's efforts to isolate Rhodesia economically had not produced major compromises by the Smith Government. Indeed, late in 1971 the British and Rhodesian Governments had negotiated a compromise political settlement which would have bowed to the Smith Government's agenda of postponing majority rule into the indefinite future. Nevertheless, when it was found that such a delayed approach to majority rule was unacceptable to most of Rhodesia's African population, the deal fell apart.<ref name=\"Ryan\">{{Harvnb|Ryan|2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Rhodesia joined [[Alcora Exercise]], a secret defensive alliance for Southern Africa, formalised in 1970 by Portugal and South Africa. Alcora formalised and deepened the political and military co-operation between the three countries against the revolutionary insurgency in Rhodesia, Angola, Mozambique and [[South West Africa]] and against the hostile neighbouring countries.\n\nHowever, the end of Portuguese rule in Mozambique created new military and political pressures on the Rhodesian Government to accept the principle of immediate majority rule.\n\n===Second phase (1972\u20131979)===\n{{for|Rhodesian Army counter-insurgency tactics|Fireforce}}\n[[File:Rhodesian reservists on patrol.jpg|thumb|upright|Rhodesian reservist soldiers on patrol with [[FN FAL]] rifles during the 1970s.]]\nThe black nationalists continued to operate from secluded bases in neighbouring [[Zambia]] and from [[FRELIMO]]-controlled areas in the Portuguese colony of [[Mozambique]], making periodic raids into [[Rhodesia]]. By 1973, guerrilla activity was increasing in the aftermath of the Altena Farm raid, particularly in the northeast part of the country where portions of the African population were evacuated from border areas, and compulsory military service for whites was extended to one year.<ref>{{Harvnb|Britannica|1974|p=600}}</ref> As the war intensified, conscription was raised to men between the ages of 38 and 50, though this was modified in 1977.

Even after discharge from regular service, white men entered the reserve forces, and were often called up for duty and subjected to long military service. In addition, Rhodesia recruited black men to volunteer for military service; by 1976, half of the Rhodesian Army was composed of black soldiers. Although some raised questions about their loyalty, the Rhodesian government stated that it had no doubts about their loyalty, and planned to train black officers. Legislation to conscript blacks was introduced and came in effect in 1979, but the response to call-ups was poor. Rhodesia also recruited foreign volunteers for service, with groups of foreigners who served in Rhodesia including the [[The Crippled Eagles|Crippled Eagles]] and [[7 Independent Company (Rhodesia)|7 Independent Company]].<ref name=fall>{{cite web |url=http://www.popularsocialscience.com/2012/10/19/the-fall-of-rhodesia/ |title=The Fall of Rhodesia |publisher=Popularsocialscience.com |date=19 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/681613642.html?dids=681613642:681613642&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+26%2C+1976&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Rhodesia+to+Seek+More+Black+Soldiers&pqatl=google |title=Los Angeles Times: Archives \u2013 Rhodesia to Seek More Black Soldiers |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=26 November 1976}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Black Conscription Protestors Arrested |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19781125&id=XgMuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XaEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5461,2563770 |accessdate=14 October 2014 |work=The Montreal Gazette |agency=Reuters |date=25 November 1978}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Rhodesians add six months to Conscription |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=muZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HuEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6527,1218119 |accessdate=14 October 2014 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |agency=UPI |date=5 May 1976}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Many Blacks ignore call-up in Rhodesia |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat=19790112&id=fv9jAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UOcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3506,2527817 |accessdate=14 October 2014 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |agency=AAP-Reuter |date=12 January 1979}}</ref>\n\nLate in 1976, Ian Smith accepted the basic elements of the compromise proposals made by US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] to introduce majority rule within two years.<ref>{{cite news |title=White rule in Rhodesia to end |publisher=BBC |location=London |date=23 September 1976 |accessdate=19 October 2011 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/24/newsid_2537000/2537969.stm}}</ref> The Smith Government then sought to negotiate an acceptable settlement with moderate black leaders, while retaining strong white influence in key areas.

When all was ready a Rhodesian soldier took his vehicle loudspeaker and announced, in Shona, \"''Zimbabwe tatora''\", meaning \"we have taken Zimbabwe\", and Nyathi blew a whistle signalling the cadres to muster.

As late as September 1979, despite the increased sophistication of guerrilla forces in Mozambique, a raid by Selous Scouts, with artillery and air support, on \"New Chimoio\" still reportedly resulted in heavy ZANLA casualties.{{#tag:ref|The increased guerrilla capabilities were evident during that raid in that the insurgents, now armed with Soviet surface-to-air missiles, were able to shoot down a Rhodesian helicopter, killing all 12 on board.<ref name=\"beckett2\">{{Harvnb|Beckett|2007}}</ref>|group=\"n\"}} However, a successful raid on the Rhodesian strategic fuel reserves in [[Harare|Salisbury]] also underscored the importance of concluding a negotiated settlement and achieving international recognition before the war expanded further.\n\n====Military pressure====\nThe larger problem was that by 1979, combined ZIPRA and ZANLA strength inside Rhodesia totalled at least 12,500 guerrillas and it was evident that insurgents were entering the country at a faster rate than the Rhodesian forces could kill or capture. In addition, 22,000 ZIPRA and 16,000 ZANLA fighters remained uncommitted outside the country.<ref name=beckett2/> Joshua Nkomo's ZIPRA forces were preparing their forces in Zambia with the intent of confronting the Rhodesians through a conventional invasion. Whether such an invasion could have been successful in the short term against the well trained Rhodesian army and air force is questionable. However, what was clear was that the insurgency was growing in strength daily and the ability of the security forces to continue to control the entire country was coming under serious challenge.<ref name=lohman4/>\n\nBy putting the civilian population at risk, ZIPRA and the ZANLA had been particularly effective in creating conditions that accelerated white emigration. This not only seriously undermined the morale of the white population, it was also gradually reducing the availability of trained reserves for the army and the police. For a discussion see: {{Main|Rhodesia Regiment}} The economy was also suffering badly from the war; the Rhodesian GDP consistently declined in the late 1970s.<ref name=beckett2/> Part of the economic decline was due to white men being called up for extended periods of military service, which also affected many Rhodesian families.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nPolitically, the Rhodesians were therefore pinning all their hopes on the \"internal\" political settlement that had been negotiated with moderate black nationalist leaders in 1978 and its ability to achieve external recognition and support. This internal settlement led to the creation of [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]] under a new constitution in 1979.\n\n===Resolution===\nUnder the agreement of March 1978, the country was renamed [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]], and in the general election of 24 April 1979, Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]] became the country's first black prime minister. On 1 June 1979, [[Josiah Zion Gumede]] became President. The internal settlement left control of the military, police, civil service, and judiciary in white hands, and assured whites about one-third of the seats in parliament. It was essentially a power-sharing arrangement between whites and blacks.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/1/newsid_2492000/2492915.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1 &#124; 1979: End of white rule in Rhodesia |work=BBC News |date=18 April 1980}}</ref> The factions led by Nkomo and Mugabe denounced the new government as a puppet of white Rhodesians and fighting continued.

Likewise, although the US Senate voted to lift sanctions against Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, the [[Carter administration]] also refused to recognise the internal settlement.\n\nWhile Prime Minister Thatcher clearly sympathized with the internal settlement and thought of the ZANLA and ZIPRA leaders as terrorists, she was prepared to support a push for further compromise if it could end the fighting.<ref>{{cite news |title=Margaret Thatcher blocked talks with 'Terrorist' Mugabe |url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-12-30-margaret-thatcher-blocked-talks-with-terrorist-mugabe |first=Katherine |last=Haddon |location=London |newspaper=[[Mail & Guardian]] |date=30 December 2009 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref> Britain was also reluctant to recognise the internal settlement for fear of fracturing the unity of the [[Commonwealth]].

During the conference, the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian Government accepted a watering down of the 1978 internal settlement while Mugabe and Nkomo agreed to end the war in exchange for new elections in which they could participate. The economic sanctions imposed on Rhodesia were lifted in late 1979, and the country reverted to temporary British rule until elections could be held. Under the Constitution of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia (Amendment) (No. 4) Act 1979 of 11 December 1979, the country formally reverted to its colonial status as Southern Rhodesia.

The Rhodesian military may have seriously considered a coup d'\u00e9tat in March 1980.<ref name=bindaQuartz/> This alleged coup was to consist of two stages: [[Operation Quartz]], coordinated attacks on guerrilla assembly points within the country, and Operation Hectic, the assassination of Mugabe and his key aides.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rhodesia.nl/quartz.htm |title=Operation Quartz \u2013 Rhodesia 1980 |publisher=Rhodesia.nl |date=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, even in the context of alleged voter intimidation by ZANLA elements, widespread support for Mugabe from large sections of the black population (in particular from the [[Shona people|Shona]] language group which made up the overwhelming majority of the country's population) could not be seriously disputed. Moreover, the clear absence of any external support for such a coup, and the inevitable conflagration that would have engulfed the country thereafter, scuttled the plan.<ref name=bindaQuartz/>\n\nThe election of early 1980 was won by Mugabe, who became prime minister after [[Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front|ZANU-PF]] received 63% of the vote. By 16 March 1980, all Commonwealth forces had departed, save for 40 infantry instructors who temporarily stayed behind to train the new nation's army.<ref name=britains-smallwars/> On 18 April 1980, interim British rule ended and the country was internationally recognised as independent. The colony of Southern Rhodesia was formally renamed Zimbabwe, and on 18 April 1982, the government changed the name of the country's capital from Salisbury to [[Harare]].\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Main|Zimbabwe|Robert Mugabe}}\nAccording to Rhodesian government statistics, more than 20,000 were killed during the war. From December 1972 to December 1979, 1,120 members of the Rhodesian security forces were killed, along with 10,050 guerrillas who were killed in Rhodesia, and an unknown number in Mozambique and Zambia, 7,790 black civilians, and 468 white civilians.<ref name=fall/>\n\nAfter he assumed power, [[Robert Mugabe]] acted incrementally to consolidate his power, forming a coalition government with his ZAPU rivals and the white minority. The Rhodesian Army was merged with guerrilla forces to form the [[Zimbabwe Defence Forces]], and the Rhodesian security forces were merged with ZANLA and ZIPRA forces. Joshua Nkomo was given a series of cabinet positions.\n\nHowever, Mugabe was torn between keeping his coalition stable and pressures to meet the expectations of his followers for social change. Clashes between ZANLA and ZIPRA forces took place in 1980 and 1981. In February 1982, Mugabe fired Nkomo and two other ZAPU ministers from his cabinet, triggering bitter fighting between ZAPU supporters in [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]]-speaking region of the country and the ruling ZANU. Between 1982 and 1985, the military crushed armed resistance from Ndebele groups in [[Matabeleland]] and the [[Midlands, Zimbabwe|Midlands]] in a military crackdown known as ''[[Gukurahundi]]'', a Shona term which translates roughly to mean \"the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains\". The ''Gukurahundi'' campaigns were also known as the Matabeleland Massacres.<ref name=\"watch\">{{Harvnb|Nyarota|2006\n|p=134}}</ref>\n\nThe Zimbabwean military's North Korean-trained [[Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade|Fifth Brigade]] was deployed to Matabeleland to crush resistance. German journalist Shari Eppel estimates approximately 20,000 Matabele were murdered in these first years after the war;<ref>{{Harvnb|Eppel|2008}}</ref> most of those killed were victims of public executions.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nViolence between ZANLA and ZIPRA continued until 1987. In December 1987, the two groups reached an accord which saw them merge into one party known as [[ZANU PF]], headed by Mugabe. Mugabe then became President and gained additional powers, as the office of Prime Minister was abolished.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nBeyond Zimbabwe's borders, as a result of Rhodesian aid and support for [[RENAMO]], the Rhodesian Bush War also helped influence the outbreak of the [[Mozambique Civil War]], which lasted from 1977 until 1992. That conflict claimed over a million lives, and made some five million people homeless.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n=== Popular culture ===\nA number of books and films are set during the Bush War.\n\nFilms include:\n* [[Albino (film)|''Albino'' (1976 film)]] \u2013 a German thriller based on the novel ''The Whispering Death'' by Daniel Carney\n* [[Game for Vultures|''A Game For Vultures'' (1979 film)]] \u2013 British made thriller set during the war.\n* [[Shamwari (film)|''Shamwari'' (1982 film)]] - thriller starring [[Ian Yule]] and [[Ken Gampu]] set in [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] during the war.\n* [[Blind Justice (1988 film)|''Blind Justice'' (1988 film)]] \u2013 British film set during the early part of the war.

During a time when Britain's [[balance of trade]] showed a growing deficit, with shrinking and increasingly [[protectionism|protectionist]] continental markets due to the [[Long Depression]] (1873\u201396), Africa offered [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and other countries an open market that would garner them a [[trade surplus]]: a market that bought more from the colonial power than it sold overall.<ref name=\"Shillington\" /><ref>Ewout Frankema, Jeffrey Williamson, and Pieter Woltjer, \"An Economic Rationale for the West African Scramble?

Another inducement for imperialism arose from the demand for raw materials, especially [[copper]], cotton, rubber, [[palm oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], diamonds, tea, and [[tin]], to which European consumers had grown accustomed and upon which European industry had grown dependent. Additionally, Britain wanted the southern and eastern coasts of Africa for stopover ports on the route to Asia and its empire in India.<ref>Lynn Hunt, ''The Making of the West'': volume C, Bedford: St. Martin, 2009.</ref> However, in Africa \u2013 excluding the area which became the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910 \u2013 the amount of capital investment by Europeans was relatively small, compared to other continents. Consequently, the companies involved in tropical African commerce were relatively small, apart from [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[De Beers Mining Company]]. Rhodes had carved out [[Rhodesia]] for himself; [[Leopold II of Belgium]] later, and with considerable brutality, exploited the [[Congo Free State]].\n\nThese events might detract from the pro-imperialist arguments of colonial lobbyists such as the ''[[Alldeutscher Verband]]'', [[Francesco Crispi]] and [[Jules Ferry]], who argued that sheltered overseas markets in Africa would solve the problems of low prices and [[overproduction]] caused by shrinking continental markets. [[John A.

The vast interior between [[Egypt]] and the gold and diamond-rich [[southern Africa]] had strategic value in securing the flow of overseas trade.

The growing navies, and new ships driven by steam power, required coaling stations and ports for maintenance.

Colonies with large native populations were also a source of military power; Britain and France used large numbers of [[Sepoy#Sepoys in British India|British Indian]] and North African soldiers, respectively, in many of their colonial wars (and would do so again in the coming World Wars).

The [[Jameson Raid]] of 1895 was a failed attempt by the British South Africa Company and the [[Johannesburg Reform Committee]] to overthrow the Boer government in the Transvaal. The [[Second Boer War]], fought between 1899 and 1902, was about control of the gold and diamond industries; the independent Boer republics of the [[Orange Free State]] and the South African Republic (or Transvaal) were this time defeated and absorbed into the British Empire.\n\nThe French thrust into the African interior was mainly from the coasts of [[West Africa]] (modern day [[Senegal]]) eastward, through the [[Sahel]] along the southern border of the Sahara, a huge desert covering most of present-day [[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], and [[Chad]]. Their ultimate aim was to have an uninterrupted colonial empire from the [[Niger River]] to the Nile, thus controlling all trade to and from the Sahel region, by virtue of their existing control over the Caravan routes through the Sahara. The British, on the other hand, wanted to link their possessions in [[Southern Africa]] (modern South Africa, [[Botswana]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]], and [[Zambia]]), with their territories in [[East Africa]] (modern [[Kenya]]), and these two areas with the Nile basin.\n\n[[File:Muhammad Ahmad.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad Ahmad]], leader of the Mahdists. This fundamentalist group of Muslim dervishes overran much of [[Sudan]] and [[Mahdist War|fought]] British forces.]]\n\nThe Sudan (which included most of present-day Uganda) was the key to the fulfillment of these ambitions, especially since Egypt was already under British control. This \"red line\" through Africa is made most famous by [[Cecil Rhodes]]. Along with [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], the British colonial minister in South Africa, Rhodes advocated such a \"Cape to Cairo\" empire, linking the Suez Canal to the mineral-rich Southern part of the continent by rail. Though hampered by German occupation of [[Tanganyika]] until the end of World War I, Rhodes successfully lobbied on behalf of such a sprawling African empire.\n\nIf one draws a line from [[Cape Town]] to [[Cairo]] (Rhodes's dream), and one from [[Dakar]] to the [[Horn of Africa]] (now [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Djibouti]] and Somalia), (the French ambition), these two lines intersect somewhere in eastern Sudan near [[Fashoda]], explaining its strategic importance. In short, Britain had sought to extend its East African empire contiguously from Cairo to the [[Cape of Good Hope]], while France had sought to extend its own holdings from Dakar to the Sudan, which would enable its empire to span the entire continent from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Red Sea]].\n\nA French force under [[Jean-Baptiste Marchand]] arrived first at the strategically located fort at Fashoda, soon followed by a British force under [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], commander in chief of the British Army since 1892. The French withdrew [[Fashoda Incident|after a standoff]] and continued to press claims to other posts in the region. In March 1899, the French and British agreed that the source of the Nile and [[Congo River]]s should mark the frontier between their spheres of influence.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\n===Moroccan Crisis===\n{{Main|First Moroccan Crisis|Second Moroccan Crisis}}\n\nAlthough the 1884\u201385 Berlin Conference had set the rules for the Scramble for Africa, it had not weakened the rival imperialists. The 1898 Fashoda Incident, which had seen France and the British Empire on the brink of war, ultimately led to the signature of the ''[[Entente cordiale|Entente Cordiale]]'' of 1904, which countered the influence of the European powers of the Triple Alliance. As a result, the new German Empire decided to test the solidity of such influence, using the contested territory of [[Morocco]] as a battlefield.\n\nThus, Kaiser Wilhelm II visited [[Tangiers]] on 31 March 1905 and made a speech in favor of Moroccan independence, challenging French influence in Morocco. France's influence in Morocco had been reaffirmed by Britain and Spain in 1904. The Kaiser's speech bolstered French nationalism, and with British support the French foreign minister, [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]], took a defiant line. The crisis peaked in mid-June 1905, when Delcass\u00e9 was forced out of the ministry by the more conciliation-minded premier [[Maurice Rouvier]]. But by July 1905 Germany was becoming isolated and the French agreed to a conference to solve the crisis. Both France and Germany continued to posture up until the conference, with Germany mobilizing reserve army units in late December and France actually moving troops to the border in January 1906.\n\n[[File:Si Kaddour ben Ghabrit et le sultan Moufay Hafid.jpg|thumb|left|The Moroccan [[Sultan]] [[Abdelhafid of Morocco|Abdelhafid]], who led the resistance to French expansionism during the [[Agadir Crisis]]]]\n\nThe 1906 [[Algeciras Conference]] was called to settle the dispute. Of the thirteen nations present, the German representatives found their only supporter was [[Austria-Hungary]]. France had firm support from Britain, the US, Russia, Italy and Spain. The Germans eventually accepted an agreement, signed on 31 May 1906, whereby France yielded certain domestic changes in Morocco but retained control of key areas.\n\nHowever, five years later the Second Moroccan Crisis (or [[Agadir Crisis]]) was sparked by the deployment of the German gunboat ''[[SMS Panther|Panther]]'' to the port of [[Agadir]] on 1 July 1911. Germany had started to attempt to surpass [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[History of the Royal Navy|naval supremacy]]&nbsp;\u2013 the British navy had a policy of remaining larger than the next two naval fleets in the world combined. When the British heard of the ''Panther'''s arrival in Morocco, they wrongly believed that the Germans meant to turn Agadir into a naval base on the Atlantic.\n\nThe German move was aimed at reinforcing claims for compensation for acceptance of effective French control of the [[North Africa]]n kingdom, where France's pre-eminence had been upheld by the 1906 Algeciras Conference. In November 1911 a convention was signed under which Germany accepted France's position in Morocco in return for territory in the [[French Equatorial Africa]]n colony of [[Middle Congo]] (now the [[Republic of the Congo]]).\n\n[[French protectorate in Morocco|France]] and [[Spanish Protectorate in Morocco|Spain]] subsequently established a full [[protectorate]] over Morocco (30 March 1912), ending what remained of the country's formal independence. Furthermore, British backing for France during the two Moroccan crises reinforced the Entente between the two countries and added to Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions that would culminate in the First World War.\n\n===Dervish resistance===\n[[File:Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan.jpeg|thumb|upright|Statue of Sayyid [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] (the \"Mad Mullah\"), leader of the [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish movement]]]]\n\nFollowing the [[Berlin conference|Berlin Conference]] at the end of the 19th century, the [[British people|British]], [[Italian people|Italians]], and [[Ethiopia]]ns sought to claim lands owned by the Somalis such as the Warsangali Sultanate, the [[Ajuran Sultanate]] and the [[Gobroon Dynasty]].\n\nThe [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish]] movement was a state established by [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]], a Somali religious leader who gathered Muslim soldiers from across the [[Horn of Africa]] and united them into a loyal army known as the ''Dervishes''. This Dervish army enabled Hassan to carve out a powerful state through conquest of lands sought after by the Ethiopians and the European powers. The Dervish movement successfully repulsed the British Empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region.<ref>Kevin Shillington, ''Encyclopedia of African History'' (CRC Press, 2005), p. 1406.</ref> Due to these successful expeditions, the Dervish movement was recognised as an ally by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[German Empire|German]] empires.

In both territories the threat to German rule was quickly defeated once large-scale reinforcements from Germany arrived, with the Herero rebels in German South-West Africa being defeated at the [[Battle of Waterberg]] and the Maji-Maji rebels in German East Africa being steadily crushed by German forces slowly advancing through the countryside, with the natives resorting to guerrilla warfare. German efforts to clear the bush of civilians in German South-West Africa then resulted in a [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide|genocide of the population]].\n\nIn total, as many as 65,000 Herero (80% of the total Herero population), and 10,000 Namaqua (50% of the total Namaqua population) either starved, died of thirst, or were worked to death in camps such as [[Shark Island Concentration Camp]] between 1904 and 1908. Characteristic of this genocide was death by starvation and the poisoning of the population's wells whilst they were trapped in the [[Namib Desert]].\n\n==Colonial encounter==\n\n===Colonial consciousness and exhibitions===\n\n====Colonial lobby====\n[[File:African Pigmies CNE-v1-p58-B.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pygmies]] and a European. Some pygmies would be exposed in [[human zoo]]s, such as [[Ota Benga]] displayed by [[eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] in the [[Bronx Zoo]].]]\n\nIn its earlier stages, imperialism was generally the act of individual explorers as well as some adventurous merchantmen. The colonial powers were a long way from approving without any dissent the expensive adventures carried out abroad. Various important political leaders, such as [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], opposed colonisation in its first years. However, during his second premiership between 1880 and 1885 he could not resist the colonial lobby in his cabinet, and thus did not execute his electoral promise to disengage from Egypt. Although Gladstone was personally opposed to imperialism, the [[class conflict|social tensions]] caused by the [[Long Depression]] pushed him to favor [[jingoism]]: the imperialists had become the \"parasites of [[patriotism]]\" ([[John A. Hobson]]).<ref>[[John A. Hobson]], ''[[Imperialism (Hobson)|Imperialism]]'', 1902, p. 61 (quoted by Arendt).</ref> In [[French Third Republic|France]], then [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical]] politician [[Georges Clemenceau]] also adamantly opposed himself to it: he thought colonisation was a diversion from the \"blue line of the [[Vosges mountains|Vosges]]\" mountains, that is [[revanchism]] and the patriotic urge to reclaim the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region which had been annexed by the German Empire with the 1871 [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]]. Clemenceau actually made [[Jules Ferry]]'s cabinet fall after the 1885 [[Sino-French War|Tonkin disaster]]. According to [[Hannah Arendt]] in ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951), this expansion of national sovereignty on overseas territories contradicted the unity of the [[nation state]] which provided citizenship to its population. Thus, a tension between the [[Moral universalism|universalist]] will to respect human rights of the colonised people, as they may be considered as \"citizens\" of the nation state, and the imperialist drive to cynically [[Exploitation of labour|exploit]] populations deemed inferior began to surface. Some, in colonising countries, opposed what they saw as unnecessary evils of the colonial administration when left to itself; as described in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899)&nbsp;\u2013 published around the same time as [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s ''[[The White Man's Burden]]''&nbsp;\u2013 or in [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]]'s ''[[Journey to the End of the Night]]'' (1932).\n\nColonial lobbies emerged to legitimise the Scramble for Africa and other expensive overseas adventures. In Germany, France, and Britain, the middle class often sought strong overseas policies to ensure the market's growth. Even in lesser powers, voices like [[Enrico Corradini]] claimed a \"place in the sun\" for so-called \"proletarian nations\", bolstering [[nationalism]] and [[militarism]] in an early prototype of [[fascism]].\n\n====Colonial propaganda and jingoism====\n\n=====Colonial exhibitions=====\n[[File:Dellepiane-exposition-nationale-coloniale-1906.jpg|thumb|Poster for the 1906 [[Colonial Exhibition]] in [[Marseilles]] (France)]]\nHowever, by the end of World War I the colonial empires had become very popular almost everywhere in Europe: [[public opinion]] had been convinced of the needs of a colonial empire, although most of the metropolitans would never see a piece of it. [[Colonial exhibition]]s were instrumental in this change of popular mentalities brought about by the colonial propaganda, supported by the colonial lobby and by various scientists.<ref>Paul S. Landau, and Deborah D. Kaspin, eds. ''Images and empires: visuality in colonial and postcolonial Africa'' (U of California Press, 2002).</ref> Thus, conquests of territories were inevitably followed by public displays of the [[indigenous people]] for scientific and leisure purposes. [[Carl Hagenbeck]], a German merchant in wild animals and a future entrepreneur of most Europeans zoos, decided in 1874 to exhibit [[Samoa]] and [[Sami people]] as \"purely natural\" populations. In 1876, he sent one of his collaborators to the newly conquered Egyptian Sudan to bring back some wild beasts and [[Nubians]]. Presented in Paris, London, and Berlin these Nubians were very successful. Such \"[[human zoos]]\" could be found in Hamburg, Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Milan, New York City, Paris, etc., with 200,000 to 300,000 visitors attending each exhibition. [[Tuaregs]] were exhibited after the French conquest of [[Timbuktu]] (visited by [[Ren\u00e9 Cailli\u00e9]], disguised as a Muslim, in 1828, thereby winning the prize offered by the French ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie''); [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] after the [[French Madagascar|occupation]] of [[Madagascar]]; [[Dahomey Amazons|Amazons]] of [[Abomey]] after [[Behanzin]]'s mediatic defeat against the French in 1894.

In French West Africa, following conquest and abolition by the French, over a million slaves fled from their masters to earlier homes between 1906 and 1911. In Madagascar, the French abolished slavery in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed. Slavery was abolished in the French controlled Sahel by 1911. Independent nations attempting to westernize or impress Europe sometimes cultivated an image of slavery suppression. In response to European pressure, the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] abolished slavery in 1900 and Ethiopia officially abolished slavery in 1932. Colonial powers were mostly successful in abolishing slavery, though slavery remained active in Africa even though it has gradually moved to a [[wage]] economy. Slavery was never fully eradicated in Africa.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005). Encyclopedia of African history.

During a time when Britain's [[balance of trade]] showed a growing deficit, with shrinking and increasingly [[protectionism|protectionist]] continental markets due to the [[Long Depression]] (1873\u201396), Africa offered [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and other countries an open market that would garner them a [[trade surplus]]: a market that bought more from the colonial power than it sold overall.<ref name=\"Shillington\" /><ref>Ewout Frankema, Jeffrey Williamson, and Pieter Woltjer, \"An Economic Rationale for the West African Scramble?

Another inducement for imperialism arose from the demand for raw materials, especially [[copper]], cotton, rubber, [[palm oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], diamonds, tea, and [[tin]], to which European consumers had grown accustomed and upon which European industry had grown dependent. Additionally, Britain wanted the southern and eastern coasts of Africa for stopover ports on the route to Asia and its empire in India.<ref>Lynn Hunt, ''The Making of the West'': volume C, Bedford: St. Martin, 2009.</ref> However, in Africa \u2013 excluding the area which became the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910 \u2013 the amount of capital investment by Europeans was relatively small, compared to other continents. Consequently, the companies involved in tropical African commerce were relatively small, apart from [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[De Beers Mining Company]]. Rhodes had carved out [[Rhodesia]] for himself; [[Leopold II of Belgium]] later, and with considerable brutality, exploited the [[Congo Free State]].\n\nThese events might detract from the pro-imperialist arguments of colonial lobbyists such as the ''[[Alldeutscher Verband]]'', [[Francesco Crispi]] and [[Jules Ferry]], who argued that sheltered overseas markets in Africa would solve the problems of low prices and [[overproduction]] caused by shrinking continental markets. [[John A.

The vast interior between [[Egypt]] and the gold and diamond-rich [[southern Africa]] had strategic value in securing the flow of overseas trade.

The growing navies, and new ships driven by steam power, required coaling stations and ports for maintenance.

Colonies with large native populations were also a source of military power; Britain and France used large numbers of [[Sepoy#Sepoys in British India|British Indian]] and North African soldiers, respectively, in many of their colonial wars (and would do so again in the coming World Wars).

The [[Jameson Raid]] of 1895 was a failed attempt by the British South Africa Company and the [[Johannesburg Reform Committee]] to overthrow the Boer government in the Transvaal. The [[Second Boer War]], fought between 1899 and 1902, was about control of the gold and diamond industries; the independent Boer republics of the [[Orange Free State]] and the South African Republic (or Transvaal) were this time defeated and absorbed into the British Empire.\n\nThe French thrust into the African interior was mainly from the coasts of [[West Africa]] (modern day [[Senegal]]) eastward, through the [[Sahel]] along the southern border of the Sahara, a huge desert covering most of present-day [[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], and [[Chad]]. Their ultimate aim was to have an uninterrupted colonial empire from the [[Niger River]] to the Nile, thus controlling all trade to and from the Sahel region, by virtue of their existing control over the Caravan routes through the Sahara. The British, on the other hand, wanted to link their possessions in [[Southern Africa]] (modern South Africa, [[Botswana]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]], and [[Zambia]]), with their territories in [[East Africa]] (modern [[Kenya]]), and these two areas with the Nile basin.\n\n[[File:Muhammad Ahmad.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad Ahmad]], leader of the Mahdists. This fundamentalist group of Muslim dervishes overran much of [[Sudan]] and [[Mahdist War|fought]] British forces.]]\n\nThe Sudan (which included most of present-day Uganda) was the key to the fulfillment of these ambitions, especially since Egypt was already under British control. This \"red line\" through Africa is made most famous by [[Cecil Rhodes]]. Along with [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], the British colonial minister in South Africa, Rhodes advocated such a \"Cape to Cairo\" empire, linking the Suez Canal to the mineral-rich Southern part of the continent by rail. Though hampered by German occupation of [[Tanganyika]] until the end of World War I, Rhodes successfully lobbied on behalf of such a sprawling African empire.\n\nIf one draws a line from [[Cape Town]] to [[Cairo]] (Rhodes's dream), and one from [[Dakar]] to the [[Horn of Africa]] (now [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Djibouti]] and Somalia), (the French ambition), these two lines intersect somewhere in eastern Sudan near [[Fashoda]], explaining its strategic importance. In short, Britain had sought to extend its East African empire contiguously from Cairo to the [[Cape of Good Hope]], while France had sought to extend its own holdings from Dakar to the Sudan, which would enable its empire to span the entire continent from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Red Sea]].\n\nA French force under [[Jean-Baptiste Marchand]] arrived first at the strategically located fort at Fashoda, soon followed by a British force under [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], commander in chief of the British Army since 1892. The French withdrew [[Fashoda Incident|after a standoff]] and continued to press claims to other posts in the region. In March 1899, the French and British agreed that the source of the Nile and [[Congo River]]s should mark the frontier between their spheres of influence.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\n===Moroccan Crisis===\n{{Main|First Moroccan Crisis|Second Moroccan Crisis}}\n\nAlthough the 1884\u201385 Berlin Conference had set the rules for the Scramble for Africa, it had not weakened the rival imperialists. The 1898 Fashoda Incident, which had seen France and the British Empire on the brink of war, ultimately led to the signature of the ''[[Entente cordiale|Entente Cordiale]]'' of 1904, which countered the influence of the European powers of the Triple Alliance. As a result, the new German Empire decided to test the solidity of such influence, using the contested territory of [[Morocco]] as a battlefield.\n\nThus, Kaiser Wilhelm II visited [[Tangiers]] on 31 March 1905 and made a speech in favor of Moroccan independence, challenging French influence in Morocco. France's influence in Morocco had been reaffirmed by Britain and Spain in 1904. The Kaiser's speech bolstered French nationalism, and with British support the French foreign minister, [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]], took a defiant line. The crisis peaked in mid-June 1905, when Delcass\u00e9 was forced out of the ministry by the more conciliation-minded premier [[Maurice Rouvier]]. But by July 1905 Germany was becoming isolated and the French agreed to a conference to solve the crisis. Both France and Germany continued to posture up until the conference, with Germany mobilizing reserve army units in late December and France actually moving troops to the border in January 1906.\n\n[[File:Si Kaddour ben Ghabrit et le sultan Moufay Hafid.jpg|thumb|left|The Moroccan [[Sultan]] [[Abdelhafid of Morocco|Abdelhafid]], who led the resistance to French expansionism during the [[Agadir Crisis]]]]\n\nThe 1906 [[Algeciras Conference]] was called to settle the dispute. Of the thirteen nations present, the German representatives found their only supporter was [[Austria-Hungary]]. France had firm support from Britain, the US, Russia, Italy and Spain. The Germans eventually accepted an agreement, signed on 31 May 1906, whereby France yielded certain domestic changes in Morocco but retained control of key areas.\n\nHowever, five years later the Second Moroccan Crisis (or [[Agadir Crisis]]) was sparked by the deployment of the German gunboat ''[[SMS Panther|Panther]]'' to the port of [[Agadir]] on 1 July 1911. Germany had started to attempt to surpass [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[History of the Royal Navy|naval supremacy]]&nbsp;\u2013 the British navy had a policy of remaining larger than the next two naval fleets in the world combined. When the British heard of the ''Panther'''s arrival in Morocco, they wrongly believed that the Germans meant to turn Agadir into a naval base on the Atlantic.\n\nThe German move was aimed at reinforcing claims for compensation for acceptance of effective French control of the [[North Africa]]n kingdom, where France's pre-eminence had been upheld by the 1906 Algeciras Conference. In November 1911 a convention was signed under which Germany accepted France's position in Morocco in return for territory in the [[French Equatorial Africa]]n colony of [[Middle Congo]] (now the [[Republic of the Congo]]).\n\n[[French protectorate in Morocco|France]] and [[Spanish Protectorate in Morocco|Spain]] subsequently established a full [[protectorate]] over Morocco (30 March 1912), ending what remained of the country's formal independence. Furthermore, British backing for France during the two Moroccan crises reinforced the Entente between the two countries and added to Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions that would culminate in the First World War.\n\n===Dervish resistance===\n[[File:Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan.jpeg|thumb|upright|Statue of Sayyid [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] (the \"Mad Mullah\"), leader of the [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish movement]]]]\n\nFollowing the [[Berlin conference|Berlin Conference]] at the end of the 19th century, the [[British people|British]], [[Italian people|Italians]], and [[Ethiopia]]ns sought to claim lands owned by the Somalis such as the Warsangali Sultanate, the [[Ajuran Sultanate]] and the [[Gobroon Dynasty]].\n\nThe [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish]] movement was a state established by [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]], a Somali religious leader who gathered Muslim soldiers from across the [[Horn of Africa]] and united them into a loyal army known as the ''Dervishes''. This Dervish army enabled Hassan to carve out a powerful state through conquest of lands sought after by the Ethiopians and the European powers. The Dervish movement successfully repulsed the British Empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region.<ref>Kevin Shillington, ''Encyclopedia of African History'' (CRC Press, 2005), p. 1406.</ref> Due to these successful expeditions, the Dervish movement was recognised as an ally by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[German Empire|German]] empires.

In both territories the threat to German rule was quickly defeated once large-scale reinforcements from Germany arrived, with the Herero rebels in German South-West Africa being defeated at the [[Battle of Waterberg]] and the Maji-Maji rebels in German East Africa being steadily crushed by German forces slowly advancing through the countryside, with the natives resorting to guerrilla warfare. German efforts to clear the bush of civilians in German South-West Africa then resulted in a [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide|genocide of the population]].\n\nIn total, as many as 65,000 Herero (80% of the total Herero population), and 10,000 Namaqua (50% of the total Namaqua population) either starved, died of thirst, or were worked to death in camps such as [[Shark Island Concentration Camp]] between 1904 and 1908. Characteristic of this genocide was death by starvation and the poisoning of the population's wells whilst they were trapped in the [[Namib Desert]].\n\n==Colonial encounter==\n\n===Colonial consciousness and exhibitions===\n\n====Colonial lobby====\n[[File:African Pigmies CNE-v1-p58-B.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pygmies]] and a European. Some pygmies would be exposed in [[human zoo]]s, such as [[Ota Benga]] displayed by [[eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] in the [[Bronx Zoo]].]]\n\nIn its earlier stages, imperialism was generally the act of individual explorers as well as some adventurous merchantmen. The colonial powers were a long way from approving without any dissent the expensive adventures carried out abroad. Various important political leaders, such as [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], opposed colonisation in its first years. However, during his second premiership between 1880 and 1885 he could not resist the colonial lobby in his cabinet, and thus did not execute his electoral promise to disengage from Egypt. Although Gladstone was personally opposed to imperialism, the [[class conflict|social tensions]] caused by the [[Long Depression]] pushed him to favor [[jingoism]]: the imperialists had become the \"parasites of [[patriotism]]\" ([[John A. Hobson]]).<ref>[[John A. Hobson]], ''[[Imperialism (Hobson)|Imperialism]]'', 1902, p. 61 (quoted by Arendt).</ref> In [[French Third Republic|France]], then [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical]] politician [[Georges Clemenceau]] also adamantly opposed himself to it: he thought colonisation was a diversion from the \"blue line of the [[Vosges mountains|Vosges]]\" mountains, that is [[revanchism]] and the patriotic urge to reclaim the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region which had been annexed by the German Empire with the 1871 [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]]. Clemenceau actually made [[Jules Ferry]]'s cabinet fall after the 1885 [[Sino-French War|Tonkin disaster]]. According to [[Hannah Arendt]] in ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951), this expansion of national sovereignty on overseas territories contradicted the unity of the [[nation state]] which provided citizenship to its population. Thus, a tension between the [[Moral universalism|universalist]] will to respect human rights of the colonised people, as they may be considered as \"citizens\" of the nation state, and the imperialist drive to cynically [[Exploitation of labour|exploit]] populations deemed inferior began to surface. Some, in colonising countries, opposed what they saw as unnecessary evils of the colonial administration when left to itself; as described in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899)&nbsp;\u2013 published around the same time as [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s ''[[The White Man's Burden]]''&nbsp;\u2013 or in [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]]'s ''[[Journey to the End of the Night]]'' (1932).\n\nColonial lobbies emerged to legitimise the Scramble for Africa and other expensive overseas adventures. In Germany, France, and Britain, the middle class often sought strong overseas policies to ensure the market's growth. Even in lesser powers, voices like [[Enrico Corradini]] claimed a \"place in the sun\" for so-called \"proletarian nations\", bolstering [[nationalism]] and [[militarism]] in an early prototype of [[fascism]].\n\n====Colonial propaganda and jingoism====\n\n=====Colonial exhibitions=====\n[[File:Dellepiane-exposition-nationale-coloniale-1906.jpg|thumb|Poster for the 1906 [[Colonial Exhibition]] in [[Marseilles]] (France)]]\nHowever, by the end of World War I the colonial empires had become very popular almost everywhere in Europe: [[public opinion]] had been convinced of the needs of a colonial empire, although most of the metropolitans would never see a piece of it. [[Colonial exhibition]]s were instrumental in this change of popular mentalities brought about by the colonial propaganda, supported by the colonial lobby and by various scientists.<ref>Paul S. Landau, and Deborah D. Kaspin, eds. ''Images and empires: visuality in colonial and postcolonial Africa'' (U of California Press, 2002).</ref> Thus, conquests of territories were inevitably followed by public displays of the [[indigenous people]] for scientific and leisure purposes. [[Carl Hagenbeck]], a German merchant in wild animals and a future entrepreneur of most Europeans zoos, decided in 1874 to exhibit [[Samoa]] and [[Sami people]] as \"purely natural\" populations. In 1876, he sent one of his collaborators to the newly conquered Egyptian Sudan to bring back some wild beasts and [[Nubians]]. Presented in Paris, London, and Berlin these Nubians were very successful. Such \"[[human zoos]]\" could be found in Hamburg, Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Milan, New York City, Paris, etc., with 200,000 to 300,000 visitors attending each exhibition. [[Tuaregs]] were exhibited after the French conquest of [[Timbuktu]] (visited by [[Ren\u00e9 Cailli\u00e9]], disguised as a Muslim, in 1828, thereby winning the prize offered by the French ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie''); [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] after the [[French Madagascar|occupation]] of [[Madagascar]]; [[Dahomey Amazons|Amazons]] of [[Abomey]] after [[Behanzin]]'s mediatic defeat against the French in 1894.

In French West Africa, following conquest and abolition by the French, over a million slaves fled from their masters to earlier homes between 1906 and 1911. In Madagascar, the French abolished slavery in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed. Slavery was abolished in the French controlled Sahel by 1911. Independent nations attempting to westernize or impress Europe sometimes cultivated an image of slavery suppression. In response to European pressure, the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] abolished slavery in 1900 and Ethiopia officially abolished slavery in 1932. Colonial powers were mostly successful in abolishing slavery, though slavery remained active in Africa even though it has gradually moved to a [[wage]] economy. Slavery was never fully eradicated in Africa.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005). Encyclopedia of African history.

It was the first major box office hit about events concerning the [[German reunification|newly reunified Germany]]. Unlike other films in this period that focused on the problems following reunification, ''Go Trabi Go'' sees the main characters, former citizens of [[East Germany]], explore places in Europe outside the [[Eastern Bloc]] that they were not allowed to visit during the [[Communism|Communist]] era.<ref>{{cite book|last=Naughton|pages=165}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe year is 1990 and Germany has been newly reunified. German teacher Udo Struutz decides that his family should go on their first vacation in the \"west\" to relive [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Italian Journey]]'' in their family [[Trabant 601]] (\"Trabi\").\n\n==Plot==\nUdo Struutz ([[Wolfgang Stumph]]), teacher in the East German town of [[Bitterfeld]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], is a great fan of [[Goethe]] and wants to visit all places described in Goethe's ''[[Italian Journey]]''. Following the [[German reunification]] in 1990, he sees the possibility to do so since it is now possible for him and his wife Rita (Marie Gruber) and daughter Jacqueline (Claudia Schmutzler) to travel to Italy. Driving in their family [[Trabant]] (called \"Schorsch\"), they set out to go on their first vacation in the \"west\".\n\nTheir first stop on their journey southwards is [[Regensburg]] where Struutz's brother-in-law ([[Ottfried Fischer]]) lives, who are portrayed as extreme opposites to the East German family. Following this short family reunion, the family with their Trabant is transported by a friendly truck driver to Italy where they continue on their own again. Arriving in [[Rome]], the family's borrowed [[camera]] is stolen which prompts mother and daughter Struutz to chase after the thief, not only recovering their camera but also the money the thief stole. Not being able to talk to the police about it and not being able to find Udo again, they decide to check into a luxury hotel with the recovered money. Meanwhile, Udo sleeps in the car after driving through the city the whole day and is awakened by four young women who want to party with him, which leads to the Trabi driving down some stairs and casing being torn apart which they then replace with colorful spare parts.

It was the first major box office hit about events concerning the [[German reunification|newly reunified Germany]]. Unlike other films in this period that focused on the problems following reunification, ''Go Trabi Go'' sees the main characters, former citizens of [[East Germany]], explore places in Europe outside the [[Eastern Bloc]] that they were not allowed to visit during the [[Communism|Communist]] era.<ref>{{cite book|last=Naughton|pages=165}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe year is 1990 and Germany has been newly reunified. German teacher Udo Struutz decides that his family should go on their first vacation in the \"west\" to relive [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Italian Journey]]'' in their family [[Trabant 601]] (\"Trabi\").\n\n==Plot==\nUdo Struutz ([[Wolfgang Stumph]]), teacher in the East German town of [[Bitterfeld]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], is a great fan of [[Goethe]] and wants to visit all places described in Goethe's ''[[Italian Journey]]''. Following the [[German reunification]] in 1990, he sees the possibility to do so since it is now possible for him and his wife Rita (Marie Gruber) and daughter Jacqueline (Claudia Schmutzler) to travel to Italy. Driving in their family [[Trabant]] (called \"Schorsch\"), they set out to go on their first vacation in the \"west\".\n\nTheir first stop on their journey southwards is [[Regensburg]] where Struutz's brother-in-law ([[Ottfried Fischer]]) lives, who are portrayed as extreme opposites to the East German family. Following this short family reunion, the family with their Trabant is transported by a friendly truck driver to Italy where they continue on their own again. Arriving in [[Rome]], the family's borrowed [[camera]] is stolen which prompts mother and daughter Struutz to chase after the thief, not only recovering their camera but also the money the thief stole. Not being able to talk to the police about it and not being able to find Udo again, they decide to check into a luxury hotel with the recovered money. Meanwhile, Udo sleeps in the car after driving through the city the whole day and is awakened by four young women who want to party with him, which leads to the Trabi driving down some stairs and casing being torn apart which they then replace with colorful spare parts. The family reunites at the [[Spanish Steps]] the next day and continues onto [[Naples]] where the Trabi loses its roof because the family forgot to secure it in place while trying to make a picture of themselves with [[Vesuvius]] in the background.\n\n==Reception==\n''Go Trabi Go'' was a major box office hit, attracting 1.5 million viewers in both parts of Germany, making it one of only three unification films that enjoyed success at the box office.<ref>{{cite book|last=Naughton|pages=119, 166}}</ref> This success has been described as being partly due to the love/hate relationship many East Germans had with their \"Trabi\", which was the most well-known and ridiculed symbol of East Germany.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rodden|pages=176}}</ref>\n\nStephen Kinzer of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the movie as a way for East Germans to laugh \"not precisely at themselves, but at the absurdities of the system under which they lived until last year.\"<ref name=\"nyt1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/07/world/chemnitz-journal-that-good-for-nothing-car-is-good-for-a-laugh.html?pagewanted=all|title=CHEMNITZ JOURNAL; That Good-for-Nothing Car Is Good for a Laugh|last=Kinzer|first=Stephan|date=March 7, 1991|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-11-03}}</ref> He likens the Trabi as a symbol for the people who built it, who \"survive[d] through difficult times and ultimately triumph[ed]\".<ref name=\"nyt1\" /> The film was also praised for its rollicking portrayal of the car as a main character while still getting across the problems of the \"East\" in the newly reunified country by using the car as a metaphor \u2014 slow, breaking down and ridiculed by the West.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rodden|pages=175}}</ref>\n\nThe film was criticised for relying almost solely on crude [[clich\u00e9]]s and mostly ignoring politically sensitive issues.<ref name=\"clarke107\">{{cite book|last=Clarke|pages=107, 108}}</ref> Another reason for criticism was that the film paints the main characters in a humble, fair and nice way while their West German counterparts are depicted as vulgar, mean and shallow.<ref name=\"nyt1\" /><ref name=\"clarke107\" />\n\nThe film was followed by a sequel, ''Go Trabi Go 2: Das war der wilde Osten'' (1992), which did not match the success of the original.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack album was released by Hansa.\n# \"Westward Ho\" - [[John Parr]] (4:38)\n# \"Gates Of Eden\"  - Eena, i.e. Ina Lucia Hildebrand (4:38)  \n# \"Questa Notte\" - Francesco Napoli (3:28) \n# \"Trabi Goes To Napoli\" (Instrumental) - Westlake Orchestra (4:20)  \n# \"Due Ragazze In Me\" - [[Gianna Nannini]] (3:44)  \n# \"White Doves Have Crossed The Borders\" - John Parr (3:47)  \n# \"Lady Of My Heart\" - [[Taco (singer)|Taco]] (3:58)  \n# \"[[Keep On Running (The Real Milli Vanilli song)|Keep On Running]]\" - [[The Real Milli Vanilli|The Real Voices Of Milli Vanilli]] (4:08)  \n# \"Jacqueline's Song\" - Claudia Schmutzler (3:02)  \n# \"Solo Con Te\" - [[Eros Ramazzotti]] (5:01)  \n# \"Lover Boy\" - Gabriela Di Rosa (3:35)  \n# \"Lady Of My Heart\" (Hollywood String Version Instrumental) - Westlake Orchestra (3:58)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=David|title=German Cinema: Since Unification|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]]|date=July 2006|isbn=0-8264-9106-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OFNU61-OHyMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}\n*{{cite book|last=Naughton|first=Leonie|title=That Was the Wild East: Film Culture, Unification, and the \"New\" Germany|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|date=January 31, 2002|isbn=0-472-08888-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AugFhjJZz0QC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}\n*{{cite book|last=Rodden|first=John|title=Repainting the Little Red Schoolhouse: A History of Eastern German Education, 1945-1995|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=January 3, 2002|isbn=0-19-511244-X|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LSzZlw2jBTIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0101960}}\n\n[[Category:1991 films]]\n[[Category:1990s comedy films]]\n[[Category:German comedy films]]\n[[Category:German films]]\n[[Category:Films about automobiles]]\n[[Category:Films set in Italy]]\n[[Category:Ostalgie]]\n", "name_user": "Sommerauer", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Trabi_Go"}
