the 2019 UK general election and the UK leaving the EU in January 2020, Another Europe is Possible has been criticised for contributing to Labour's defeat. The organisation has been criticised in the socialist news website Counterfire for running a 'uniquely unsuccessful campaign whose only practical effect is to have forced Labour into a position which materially assisted in its election defeat' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.counterfire.org/articles/analysis/20805-another-struggle-is-possible|title=Another struggle is possible|last=Rees|first=John|website=Counterfire|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>. The day after the 2019 general election result, the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]''  published an editorial holding responsible 'groups like another Europe Is Possible' for Labour's defeat <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/b/why-we-lost-how-we-win|title=Why we lost, how we win|last=Friday|last2=December 13|date=2019-12-13|website=Morning Star|language=en|access-date=2020-02-29|last3=2019}}</ref>.\n\nTopics associated with Another Europe is Possible, such as the holding of a second referendum concerning the UK's relationship with the EU, have received significant criticism in outlets for political commentary.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/14/second-referendum-could-break-democracy</ref><ref>https://www.politico.eu/article/a-2nd-brexit-referendum-would-be-undemocratic-michael-gove/</ref> Another Europe is Possible has also received direct criticism on the 'World Socialist Website', with writer Julie Hyland stating that \" it is where apologists for the EU parade as \u201cprogressives\u201d, and specifically claiming that the organisation \" does not represent working people, but a section of the upper middle class\u2014personified by Varoufakis\u2014who are significant beneficiaries of the EU\".<ref>https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/06/07/euro-j07.html</ref> In a February 2019 letter, [[Unite the Union]] claimed that Another Europe is Possible had misrepresented the union's general secretary Len McCluskey regarding his discussions with then UK Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] stating that: \u201cUnite activists for the most part know better than to believe media rumours about their union, and we urge Another Europe is Possible to take the same sceptical approach.\u201d.<ref>https://unitetheunion.org/news-events/news/2019/february/unite-responds-to-misleading-letter-from-another-europe-is-possible/</ref>\n\nIn an article for [[New Statesman]], journalist Anoosh Chakelian suggested that Another Europe is Possible, along with a similar group 'For Our Future's Sake', recieved criticism because \"both groups have the same problem that other figures on the left, including young Labour members and Momentum activists, are not sympathetic to attacks on Corbyn regardless of how they feel about Brexit. Corbyn represents the socially liberal values they endorse, and they would prefer to see a purely anti-hard Brexit, anti-Tory approach.\"<ref>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/06/why-everyone-hating-these-pro-remain-campaign-groups</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n== External links ==\n\n{{Portal bar|Society|United Kingdom|Brexit|Current events}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Another Europe is Possible}}\n\n[[Category:Brexit]]\n[[Category:Advocacy groups in the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{db-spam|help=off}}\n{{short description|European Union reform political campaigning group}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2020}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020|cs1-dates=y}}\n{{Infobox organisation\n| name = Another Europe is Possible\n| named_after = \n| image = \n| image_size = \n| alt = \n| caption = \n| logo = \n| formation = {{Nowrap|{{Start date and age|df=y|2016||}}}}\n| founder = \n| founding_location = London, United Kingdom.\n| type = [[Advocacy group]]\n| status = \n| purpose = Political campaigning concerning the UK's relationship with the EU\n| coords = <!-- {{coord|LAT|LON|display=inline, title}} -->\n| region = [[United Kingdom]]\n| fields =\n| key_people = \n| parent_organization = \n| affiliations =  \n}}\n'''Another Europe is Possible''' is a political organisation based in the [[United Kingdom]] which was founded in February 2016 to campaign for the 'Remain' option during the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]] (often referred to as the 'Brexit referendum').

the 2019 UK general election and the UK leaving the EU in January 2020, Another Europe is Possible has been criticised for contributing to Labour's defeat. The organisation has been criticised in the socialist news website Counterfire for running a 'uniquely unsuccessful campaign whose only practical effect is to have forced Labour into a position which materially assisted in its election defeat' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.counterfire.org/articles/analysis/20805-another-struggle-is-possible|title=Another struggle is possible|last=Rees|first=John|website=Counterfire|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>.

Corbyn represents the socially liberal values they endorse, and they would prefer to see a purely anti-hard Brexit, anti-Tory approach.\"<ref>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/06/why-everyone-hating-these-pro-remain-campaign-groups</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n== External links ==\n\n{{Portal bar|Society|United Kingdom|Brexit|Current events}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Another Europe is Possible}}\n\n[[Category:Brexit]]\n[[Category:Advocacy groups in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Boredintheevening", "label": "safe", "comment": "incoroprated Brexit sidebar", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Europe_is_Possible"}

In 2010 the game underwent a shift from its original subscription-based payment model to being [[free-to-play]], with a paid subscription and an in-game store.\n\nThe game saw continued development, alternating between expansions and free updates, which added new content in the regions of [[The Lord of the Rings Online: Rise of Isengard|Isengard]], [[The Lord of the Rings Online: Riders of Rohan|Rohan]] and [[Gondor]]. In late 2016 it was announced that the publishing of the game would transfer from [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] to [[Daybreak Game Company]], with development being taken over by Standing Stone Games, made up of former Turbine staff.<ref name=\"Bree Royce\">{{cite news | url=http://massivelyop.com/2016/12/19/turbine-spins-lotro-and-ddo-teams-out-to-new-studio-using-daybreak-as-publisher/ | title=TURBINE SPINS ''Lord of the Rings Online'' AND DDO TEAMS OUT TO NEW STUDIO, USING DAYBREAK AS PUBLISHER | work=Massively Overpowered | date=December 19, 2016 | accessdate=December 20, 2016 | author=Bree Royce}}</ref> The game development continued and in 2017 the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mordor|Mordor]]'' expansion was released, bringing the main storyline to a close. The story then shifted to showing how various inhabitants of [[Middle-earth]] deal with the downfall of [[Sauron]], with ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Minas Morgul|Minas Morgul]]'' expansion released in 2019<ref>{{cite news | url=https://mmocourt.com/2019/02/26/lord-of-the-rings-online-expansion-to-include-minas-morgul-and-shelob/ | title=LORD OF THE RINGS ONLINE EXPANSION TO INCLUDE MINAS MORGUL AND SHELOB | work=MMOCourt | date=February 26, 2019| accessdate=August 27, 2019 | author=Michael}}</ref> and a [[Gundabad]]-themed expansion announced for 2021.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://massivelyop.com/2020/02/29/pax-east-2020-lotro-plans-aragorn-and-arwens-wedding-2021-expansion-as-ddo-teases-unicorns/| title=PAX East 2020: LOTRO plans Aragorn and Arwen's wedding plus 2021 expansion as DDO teases unicorns| work=MassivelyOP| date=February 29, 2020| accessdate=February 29, 2020| author=ree Royce}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nMuch of the gameplay is typical of the [[Massively multiplayer online game|Massive Multiplayer Online]] (MMO) format: the player controls a character [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] which can be moved around the game world and interacts with other players, [[non-player character]]s and other entities in the [[virtual world]]. Characters gain [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] by earning [[experience point]]s from defeating enemies and completing quests and improve their personal stats by equipping items and using consumable buffs. As characters increase in level, they earn both new skills and trait points, which can be assigned in various configurations to customize personal playstyle. Players can use the quest tracker to navigate objectives on the mini-map and traverse the game world either on foot or using personal mounts, which include horses, [[pony|ponie]]s, goats and, more recently, [[elk]]s. Instantaneous travel is also available by using in-game stable-masters and certain \"quick travel\" skills. In addition to the detailed Quest log, player characters also have a Deed log, which tracks their progress across a vast number of achievements, ranging from frivolous to being vital for character progression.\n\nAs opposed to other [[role-playing video game]]s, the equivalent of [[Health (gaming)|health]] or [[Health (gaming)|hit points]] in ''The Lord of the Rings Online'' is [[morale]], which can be raised via food, rest, music, and [[Battle cry|battle cries]], and characters whose morale reaches zero in combat are considered \"defeated\" instead of killed. The equivalent of [[Magic (gaming)|mana]] is called \"power\" because of the way [[Magic (Middle-earth)|magic]] in Tolkien's [[Middle-earth]] differs from other fantasy games such as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', except for the [[Beorn]]ing class, which uses \"wrath\" instead. Player characters can own a personal house, which can be decorated and provide additional storage. The crafting system allows each character to master up to three professions, which are separated into \"gathering\" of materials and actual \"crafting\" of usable items. In consistency with the characterization of [[Hobbit]]s in Tolkien's writings, a fair emphasis is placed on cooking and farming. Players can also customize the look of their characters by using the Cosmetic system, which can display armor and weapons other than those worn for combat effectiveness. In addition to character name, players can also choose their current PvMP rank and a title to be displayed.\n\n''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria|Mines of Moria]]'' added the concept of Legendary items, which gain experience points and levels alongside the player character, allowing them to increase in power over time. Each character can equip two class-specific legendary items (one of which is always the main weapon), which contain Legacies that provide modifiers to class-specific abilities. Alongside regular experience points, players gain Legendary Item experience, which can be applied to different Legendary items to increase their levels. Each item level in turn comes with a set amount of Legendary points, which can be assigned to specific Legacies to increase their potency. Players can further customize their Legendary items by naming them, giving them titles and slotting additional gems and runes. Characters can begin using Legendary items at level 50, but they have to be periodically replaced to make up for the difference in stats until level 100, when Legendary items can be \"imbued\". Imbued Legendary Items can stay relevant despite the increase in character level, but require the player to apply various crystals, scrolls and runes to remain so.\n\n''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Riders of Rohan|Riders of Rohan]]'' introduced the mounted combat to the game. While regular character mounts only provide a speed boost and a minimal protection against the attacks, the new rohirric war-steeds allow players to execute special \"mounted\" skills and attacks while on horseback. War-steeds have many of the same stats as player characters, including morale and power, and can be customized by selecting different types of war-steeds, investing in different trait lines and switching between different mounted stances. Players can also invest in a Legendary [[bridle]] item and customize the look of their war-steeds by mix-and-matching various appearance traits.\n\n=== Characters and races ===\n''Lord of the Rings Online'' launched with four playable races: [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], [[Hobbit]]s and [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lotro.com/en/explore/characters|title=Characters|work=The Lord of the Rings Online|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}</ref> In 2014 a new race of [[Beorn]]ings was added, although this race is only for the new class of the same name. ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mordor|Mordor]]'' expansion in 2017 added the new [[Calaquendi|High Elf]] race. In 2019 a new race of \"Stout-Axe Dwarves\" was added, representing a dwarven clan from the far east of Middle-Earth with an appearance distinct from that of Longbeard dwarves. Released as part of ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Minas Morgul|Minas Morgul]]'' expansion, Stout-Axes dwarves also allow players to choose either male or female sex for their character<ref>{{cite web|url=https://massivelyop.com/2019/08/03/lotro-announces-stout-axe-dwarves-ddo-reveals-alchemist-class-and-permadeath-server/|title=LOTRO announces Stout Axe Dwarves, DDO reveals Alchemist class and permadeath server|author = Justin Olivetti|work=Massively Overpowered|date=August 3, 2019|accessdate=August 27, 2019}}</ref> as with all other races, while the original Dwarven race only allows to create male characters. After selecting a character race, players are limited in choosing a character class based on that race, with the most radical exception being the Beorning race, which only allows the Beorning class.\n\nThe original seven character classes in the game are Burglar, Captain, Champion, Guardian, Hunter, Lore-master and Minstrel. ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria|Mines of Moria]]'' added the Rune-Keeper and Warden classes, while a tenth Beorning class was added in a regular update on November 2014. These three additional classes have to be unlocked by both free-to-play players and subscribers either through the in-game Store or by purchasing the ''Mines of Moria'' expansion. A character of each class can further specialize in one of the three trait lines that further determine their skills and combat role. While players can switch between different trait lines at will, each requires a specific set of gear and Legendary Items to complement and fully utilize it. In addition to Class traits, Racial and Virtue traits can also be earne and upgraded by completing specific quests and deeds.\n\n=== Game economy===\nAn in-game currency of gold, silver and copper coins allows player characters to accumulate wealth by completing quests and selling obtained loot and crafted items to NPCs or other players. Currency can also be used to acquire equipment from NPCs or players, pay to repair equipment after combat, fast travel, buy crafting materials, and purchase a house. Players can trade face-to-face, via in-game mail, or at in-game Auction Houses. LOTRO points (formerly \"Turbine points\") are used in the in-game store and can be both purchased with real money or earned in-game. LOTRO points can be spend on content unlocks, character boosts and convenience upgrades as well as \"Mithril Coins\", a meta-currency for various game-related purchases. The game also features a wide variety of barter currencies for specific regions, group instances and seasonal festivals, which are either placed in character bags or a Store-purchased \"Barter wallet\".\n\nOn reaching Level 15, players can purchase a house in an [[Instance dungeon|instanced]] neighborhood, which is shared between all of their characters on the same [[game server]]. Houses come in different sizes and include chests for additional storage, but require a weekly maintenance rent using in-game currency and can be locked on failure to pay upkeep. Players can decorate their houses by placing decorations and furniture obtained as rewards for various in-game activities, such as quests, deeds or seasonal festivals. Originally four themed neighborhoods were available based on the four playable races: Dwarves, Elves, Men and Hobbits. With the release of the first region in [[Gondor]], Premium Housing became available in the Cape of Belfalas area, with upkeep required in Mithril Coins instead of gold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lotro.com/en/game/articles/dev-diary-premium-housing|title=Dev Diary \u2013 Premium Housing|date=October 18, 2016|publisher=Turbine|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}</ref> Additional Premium Housing areas in [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] are slated for release in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://massivelyop.com/2019/04/06/lotro-announces-rohan-housing-while-ddo-is-slated-to-get-a-64-bit-client/|title=LOTRO announces Rohan housing while DDO is slated to get a 64-bit client|author = Justin Olivetti|work=Massively Overpowered|date=April 6, 2019|accessdate=August 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Deeds and reputation===\nDeeds are a means of tracking accomplishments for each character that are not part of any quest. Most common are regional deeds, found in all of the game's landscape regions, including Explorer, Slayer, Lore and Reputation deeds. Deeds are generally discovered upon completion of one of the goals of the deed (e.g., finding the first area of an Explorer deed or killing the first enemy of a Slayer deed), although some deeds are hidden and do not show up until all required objectives have been completed. Other deeds include those tied to individual character's class or race, while Epic story deeds are advanced by completing quests in the Epic Quest line. Additional deeds are also found in conjunction with the Skirmish and Instance features. A final Deed category is the Hobby, related to fishing, which currently is the only in-game Hobby. In addition, there are 'Meta' Deeds that require completion of several other deeds, usually all of the deeds in a region or in an Instance Cluster. Deed completion is generally rewarded by statistic boosts, often LOTRO points, and sometimes cosmetic/non-combat awards such as titles or emotes.\n\nReputation is the measure of how well acquainted a player is with a specific group or faction. Each region in ''The Lord of the Rings Online'' features one or several factions, reputation for which may be gained by completing quests, deeds, defeating specific monsters and using Reputation items. Reputation factions in the original game and in the ''Mines of Moria'' favored advancement by collecting and using Reputation items, while those from ''Siege of Mirkwood'' onward lean towards repeatable quests that provide a set amount of Reputation each day instead. Each Reputation faction includes vendors with a set of specific rewards unlocked at various tiers, ranging from cosmetic pets and outfits to top-tier weapons and armour. Crafting Guilds are special Reputation factions for the crafting skills that provide access to exclusive crafting recipes, and each character can join up to two Crafting Guilds at a time.\n\n===Fellowship and group instances===\nA fellowship is a band of up to six characters, created to complete quests and group instances, which can be formed and disbanded by the leader at any time. All players in a fellowship can communicate with each other in the fellowship chat panel, where a conversation is seen by all fellowship members. The fellowship leader also has the ability to invite or dismiss a member at any time. Members in a fellowship will also appear to each other on the regional maps, which enables them to easily find one another in the game world. A fellowship can also be transformed into a Raid, which can be composed of up to four separate fellowships and can contain anywhere from 6 to 24 players.\n\nFellowships (including those found in raids) can use the Fellowship Maneuver system to perform special group moves. Fellowship Maneuvers occur randomly and require that the target be stunned or knocked down in any group encounter with a \"signature\" or higher difficulty enemy. Certain classes also have special skills that can initiate Fellowship Maneuvers when triggered. When a Fellowship Maneuver is initiated, every player within the area will get a color wheel on their screen to choose one of four skill contributions, with different combinations resulting in different powerful attacks.\n\nFellowships are required to complete many of the group instances, which come in several different variations. A typical \"instance\" alternates between groups of strong enemies and [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] encounters which often features unique game mechanics and provide a chest of rewards upon defeat. \"Raids\" are similar to instances, but feature \"raid locks\" which prevent characters from killing each boss more than once a week, but also allow to track progress of a difficult raid across multiple game sessions. \"Skirmishes\" were introduced with the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Siege of Mirkwood|Siege of Mirkwood]]'' expansions and feature both enemy groups of random composition and randomized \"Skirmish Lieutenant\" encounters across the instance. \"Epic Battles\" were introduced with the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Helm's Deep|Helm's Deep]]'' expansion and represent large-scale battles, in which numerous friendly [[Non-player character|NPCs]] engage the enemy alongside the player characters, whose focus lies on supporting their allies and completing specific objectives during the battle as opposed to simply defeating all of the enemies. While some group instances are fixed in both their size and intended level, others can be played on different group sizes, levels and tiers of difficulty for progressively higher rewards.\n\nMonster Players in the game can also join Fellowships, though they are named Warbands instead. Monster characters (see below) in a PvP zone also gain access to the Fellowship Manoeuvers panel, which are renamed to Warband Maneuvers.\n\n=== World regions ===\nThe game's environment is [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], based on ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]''. It has been noted that the game's license does not cover rights to any other works in [[Tolkien's legendarium]], such as ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Turbine |url=http://www.lotro-europe.com/faq.php?type=About+Game#About%20Game |title=\"Is The Lord of the Rings Online (LOTRO) based on the movies or the books?\" and \"What about The Silmarillion?\" at the official FAQ |date=n.d. |accessdate=November 15, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127032914/http://www.lotro-europe.com/faq.php?type=About+Game#About%20Game |archivedate=November 27, 2007}}</ref> The game world is broadly divided into larger sections of [[Eriador]], [[Rhovanion]], [[Gondor]] and [[Mordor]]. It is then divided into separate \"Regions\", which are then further further sub-divided into \"Areas\". In the original game regions the area division served mostly navigational purpose, but from [[Enedwaith]] onwards each area usually has a distinctive landscape aesthetic and its own separate storyline. The game's distinction of regions does not always match that of Tolkien's original definitions: for example, Northfarthing of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] is considered to be part of [[Evendim]] region, [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] is considered to be part of [[Rhovanion]] and [[Gondor|Kingdom of Gondor]] is split into several smaller regions.\n\nEach region in the game contains [[non-player character]]<nowiki/>s (NPCs) and quests within an established player character level range, with the main Epic storyline usually serving as a guide between the region's areas in progression from lowest to highest level. Each region also has a capital settlement, but only a few regions feature a proper \"hub\" for player activities, which is commonly defined as an area which includes all major in-game services for player characters, such as vault-keepers, auction houses and crafting halls. It is important to note that each Region is considered to be permanently set in a specific point in time during the [[War of the Ring]] despite the passage of time in the main story: this means that many characters such as [[Gandalf]] or [[Aragorn]] can be present in multiple places at once if those places are set during different portions of the story. Several major locations are even permanently available in more than one state: for example players can freely move from [[Isengard]] flooded by the [[Ent]]s to Isengard at the height of [[Saruman]]'s power and from [[Minas Tirith]] rebuilding after the [[battle of the Pelennor Fields]] to Minas Tirith before the battle, with the enemy still at the doorstep.\n\n=== Player vs Monster Player ===\nClassic [[Player versus player|Player vs. Player]] (PvP) combat, found in many other MMOs, does not exist in ''The Lord of the Rings Online''. Free People characters can only \"spar\" each other on request and for no rewards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Spar|title=Spar|website=Lotro-wiki.com|accessdate=May 2, 2019}}</ref> Instead, Player vs Monster Player (also known as PvMP or Monster Play)<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lotro.com/article/313|title=Game Systems: Monster Play Overview|date=n.d.|publisher=Turbine|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225021407/http://www.lotro.com/article/313|archivedate=February 25, 2008|accessdate=March 8, 2008}} \u2013 this reference is historical only.</ref> system allows players to create \"Monster player\" characters and engage Free People in combat in special secluded areas.\n\nMonster player classes are Orc Reaver, Orc Defiler, Spider Weaver, Uruk Blackarrow, Uruk Warleader and Warg Stalker.

Infamy is awarded for killing Free People characters, and higher ranks give access to better equipment and stat ratings.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Rank|title=Monster Play Rank Titles: Rank Chart|date=n.d.|publisher=Turbine|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}</ref> Monster players can equip no items, but can use consumable buffs and can be customized with specific appearance traits, purchased with Commendations given for quest completion or enemy kills. The quests, deeds and titles are similar to those of the regular characters, but Monster players are unable to leave the confines of the PvMP area and interact with Free People characters who do not wish to be a part of it. Originally, the only PvMP are was the [[Ettenmoors]], where Free Players could travel and battle Monster players for control over the five keeps and minor outposts. In July 2015, a second PvMP area was added in the ruins of [[Osgiliath]].<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?572512-Update-16-2-Release-Notes|title=Update 16.2 Release Notes|website=Lotro.com|accessdate=May 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nEach game region contains from several dozens to over a hundred \"Regional\" quests which can be standalone missions or part of complete storyline with a clear culminating point, which often runs parallel to the Epic Story.  The main storyline (also known as the \"Epic Quest Line\") is presented as a series of \"Books\", which consist of series of quests called \"Chapters\". Initially eight Books were available at the game's release, with a new book added with each content update. After the game's transion to [[free-to-play]] new Books stopped being strictly tied to updates, with some major updates containing no new Books while others adding several Books at once instead.\n\n===Volume I: Shadows of Angmar===\nThe original Epic Story focused mostly on events that were new additions to the ''Lord of the Rings'' story by the creators of the game. Starting shortly after [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and his company had left [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], the player character makes it to [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], where they become acquainted to [[Aragorn]] and [[Gandalf]] and become involved in the larger affairs of [[Middle-Earth]]. After initially following in the footsteps of Aragorn and the Hobbits to [[Weathertop]] and the [[Trollshaws]] where they track the single [[Nazg\u00fbl|Black Rider]] that was not swept away at the [[Ford of Bruinen]], the player character soon gets involved into a campaign against resurgent [[Angmar]], eventually stopping the plans of several powerful servants of The Witch King across [[Eriador]].\n\n*'''Book I \u2013 Stirrings in the Darkness''' \u2013 After the introductions, the player is sent to [[Aragorn]], who needs help weakening the Blackwolds, a hostile gang within Bree-land, loyal to [[Saruman|Sharkey]]. After helping Aragorn and the [[Ranger (Middle-earth)|Rangers]], the player is sent to [[Tom Bombadil]] to destroy the evil in Othrongroth, the Great Barrow of the [[Barrow-downs]]. Though the Wightlord Sambrog is defeated, the [[Witch-king]] and his servants, Ivar and Skorgrim, escape the player's pursuit. Upon returning to [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], the player discovers Aragorn has left with the [[Hobbit]]s and instead meets [[Gandalf]], who arrived too late to help. The player is then instructed by Gandalf (who leaves for [[Rivendell]] as well) to locate one of Gandalf's fellow [[Istari]], [[Radagast the Brown]].\n*'''Book II \u2013 The Red Maid''' \u2013 The player is sent to the Ranger Candaith, who tries to learn the location of [[Radagast the Brown]] for the player. While waiting, the player investigates the mysterious events that happened on [[Weathertop]] and fights the [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orc]] army around and on top of the hill. By the time the enemy is defeated, Candaith has found Radagast in the city of Ost Guruth and sends the player to meet him. Radagast asks for the player's help in cleansing the area of Garth Agarwen from the evil [[Barrow-wight|wights]] that inhabit it. Ultimately the player and Radagast fight Ivar the Bloodhand, their leader and servant of the [[Witch-king]]. Upon succeeding, the player is urgently sent to the North Downs to aid the Rangers in those lands.\n*'''Book III \u2013 The Council of the North''' \u2013 The player is asked by [[Halbarad]] to aid in the defense of the North Downs against [[Angmar]]'s forces, by uniting the three main armies of the North Downs: the Men of the town of Trestlebridge, the local Dwarves led by [[Dori (Middle-earth)|Dori]], and [[Gildor]]'s Elves. After accomplishing this, the player is sent to Rivendell, where the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] has now safely arrived.\n*'''Book IV \u2013 Chasing Shadows''' \u2013 [[Nazg\u00fbl|The Black Rider]] that survived the Flood of [[Bruinen]] by [[Elrond]] is still somewhere in the [[Trollshaws]], making it impossible for the Fellowship to leave. With the help of [[Legolas]], Elladan and Elrohir, the player chases the [[Nazg\u00fbl]], destroying the Trolls he has corrupted, and forcing the Ringwraith to retreat to the [[Misty Mountains]]. The player is sent to pursue him, where [[Gl\u00f3in]] and some Dwarves have set up a camp.\n*'''Book V \u2013 The Last Refuge''' \u2013 The player's search for the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] brings him/her to the final stronghold of Skorgr\u00edm and the Dourhands, the corrupted Dwarves. An assault led by [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] results in the fall of Skorgrim and his servants. But the Nazg\u00fbl has fled to Helegrod, where a long-dead [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragon]] Thorog has been reanimated as a wight to serve the [[Sauron|Dark Lord]]. The player arrives just in time to stop the Nazg\u00fbl, defeating him and making him lose control of the Dragon, who escapes. Now that [[Rivendell]] is safe, it is time to move on to [[Angmar]] itself.\n*'''Book VI \u2013 Fires in the North''' \u2013 Rangers of the North, led by Corunir and Golodir, have gone to [[Angmar]] and their kinsmen want to know what has become of them. Upon arriving in Angmar, the player finds Corunir safe in a friendly Hillmen village. He begs the player to find his lost company, who passed through Rammas Deluon: a great series of statues that weaken (or even kill) those who pass it. After destroying the spirits within them, the player becomes able to resist the power of Rammas Deluon, and finds a hidden [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]] settlement, where a part of the scattered party lives.\n*'''Book VII \u2013 The Hidden Hope''' \u2013 The player is informed that Golodir is settled at Gath Forthnir, far in the North. Upon arriving there, (s)he finds that Golodir is long gone and the Rangers are led by his daughter, Lorniel. Lorniel reveals that Golodir has been captured by Mordirith, Steward of [[Angmar]], and has been locked away in [[Carn D\u00fbm]]. As leader of the remaining Rangers, and with the help of the Elf Laerdan, Lorniel launches an assault on Carn D\u00fbm, where she is slain by Mordirith, who then releases broken Golodir in a mockery, to continue his torture.\n*'''Book VIII \u2013 The Scourge of the North''' \u2013 Golodir's grief for the death of his daughter has almost destroyed him, yet he sees a chance to avenge her. Reclaiming an ancient sword, he travels with the player to the heart of [[Carn D\u00fbm]], defeating Mordirith with his blade. But then Mordirith's ''[[palant\u00edr]]'', a great seeing-stone he used to torture Golodir, is quickly taken by the mysterious Sara Oakheart.\n*'''Book IX \u2013 Shores of Evendim''' \u2013 The player learns that Sara Oakheart is none other than [[Amarthiel]], the legendary Champion of Angmar. She has set up a plot within a tower of Barad Gularan to use the player to weaken Mordirith. Now that she has the ''[[palant\u00edr]]'', she can communicate with [[Sauron]] and challenge Mordirith's position. The player is sent to kill all of Mordirith's Knights, in an attempt to further weaken his power. But despite the player's victories over Mordirith, Amarthiel only grows stronger. After losing Fornost and Barad Gularan, she moves to Ann\u00faminas, the ancient capital of Arnor. The Rangers there, led by Calenglad, need the player's aid.\n*'''Book X \u2013 The City of Kings''' \u2013 A massive battle in Ann\u00faminas ensues and the wise [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] Laerdan offers his services to Calenglad. Mordrambor, one of [[Amarthiel]]'s captains, is captured, but while in captivity he poisons the mind of Laerdan, making the Elf decide to fight Amarthiel on his own, in an attempt to make up for his mistakes in the past. Again the Free Peoples have been tricked by Amarthiel and her servants. Together with the Rangers of [[Evendim]], the player is able to wrestle the ''[[palant\u00edr]]'' from Amarthiel's clutches, but Laerdan is lost. However, within the ''palant\u00edr'', Amarthiel saw a glimpse of where Narchuil, her ancient ring, lies. She is now determined to possess its power once more.\n*'''Book XI \u2013 Prisoner of the Free Peoples''' \u2013 [[Amarthiel]]'s captain Mordrambor breaks free, killing many Rangers. Soon he leads an army out of Ann\u00faminas, to find Amarthiel's Ring, Narchuil. The player attempts to find Narchuil before Amarthiel can, searching the ancient ruins of the [[Trollshaws]]. After much searching, it turns out Narmeleth, Laerdan's daughter, who originally caused Amarthiel's fall in Fornost, has become possessed by her. But all searching seems in vain, when it is revealed Amarthiel has already found Narchuil. However, [[Elrond]] does not fall for her trickery again; he realizes Narchuil is still out there, and Laerdan knows where.\n*'''Book XII \u2013 The Ashen Wastes''' \u2013 [[Amarthiel]] has Laerdan transported to [[Angmar]], where she learns from him under torture where her Ring is. In a brave attempt to save both Laerdan and the ring Narchuil, the player is able to get to them before Amarthiel does, but only half of the ring was found. Laerdan confesses to [[Elrond]] he has broken the Narchuil in two, and reveals where the other part should be. But then he swears an oath upon [[Varda|Elbereth]] that he will not rest before he has saved his daughter, and leaves the Council.\n*'''Book XIII \u2013 Doom of the Last King''' \u2013 Trying to find out more about the other half of Narchuil, the player is sent to Forochel. However Amarthiel's forces have already arrived, and their search is underway. In an attempt to find the ring before the Angmarim, the player receives help from the shade of the Last King Arvedui. During a confrontation with the enemy, it appears that Mordrambor has betrayed [[Amarthiel]]: the two battle each other and disappear from the view. The player then retrieves the second half of Narchuil and returns it to Rivendell.\n*'''Book XIV \u2013 The Ring-forges of Eregion''' \u2013 Still seeking to save Narmeleth, Laerdan travels with the two-halves of Narchuil to Eregion. [[Amarthiel]], baiting him in, reclaims Narchuil for herself. Elrond sends many Heralds of [[Rivendell]] to all corners of [[Eriador]] to help him in his search for the lost Ring-lore. But all efforts are too late, for Narchuil has been reforged when the Free Peoples reach Eregion. It quickly becomes clear none are able to withstand Narchuil, until Mordrambor, Amarthiel's former servant, arrives. Sowing confusion in her, he shows her the arrival of Mordirith, who is in power once again, but Amarthiel does not surrender and believes she can defeat him with use of Narchuil. However, Mordirith has the power of the [[Witch-king]] and defeats her, claiming Narchuil as his own. Just as he is about to finish Amarthiel, Laerdan appears. He reveals his knowledge that Mordirith is actually E\u00e4rnur, the last King of [[Gondor]], taken captive by the Witch-King and made a Wraith in mockery of his former defiance. Under Mordirith's orders Mordrambor kills Laerdan, after which the two leave. Amarthiel is devastated by the loss of her father, and taken captive by the Free Peoples.\n*'''Book XV \u2013 Daughter of Strife''' \u2013 With the death of her father, Narmeleth is once again freed from the evil influence of Amarthiel. She becomes a captive of the Free Peoples, but volunteers to avenge her father. In Angmar, the final battle between the Free People and Mordirith ensues. First Mordrambor is defeated and Narchuil is finally destroyed by Narmeleth. In the final confrontation, she sacrifices herself to defeat Mordirith. The book ends bittersweet with Narmeleth's redemption and her death and Elrond comforts the player, saying that she had found peace in the Undying Lands.\n\n===Volume II: Mines of Moria===\n{{main|The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria#Storyline}}\nUnder orders of King [[Dain Ironfoot]], a company of dwarves from [[Erebor]] known as the Iron Garrison is sent to investigate and potentially reclaim [[Moria]]. By sheer luck, they arrive mere days after Gandalf had fought and defeated [[Durin's Bane]], throwing the denizens of Moria into disarray. Using the power vacuum in the wake of the [[Balrog]]'s demise, the dwarves quickly claim major ground and establish several footholds within [[Khazad-d\u00fbm]], but soon begin to face ever greater peril as the forces of evil in Moria begin to unite under new leadership. Making an alliance with the Elves of [[Lothlorien]] the dwarves attempt to hold their ground when a personal emissary of [[Sauron]] himself arrives from [[Dol Guldur]] to put an end to their expedition. This story concludes in the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Siege of Mirkwood|Siege of Mirkwood]]'' expansion where the [[Galadhrim]] launch a major assault against Dol Guldur in an effort to draw the Eye of the enemy away from the Fellowhip as it departs from Lorien.\n\n===Volume III: Allies of the King===\n{{main|The Lord of the Rings Online: Siege of Mirkwood#Storyline|The Lord of the Rings Online: Rise of Isengard#Storyline|The Lord of the Rings Online: Riders of Rohan#Storyline|The Lord of the Rings Online: Helm's Deep#Storyline}}\nLady [[Galadriel]] tasks the player with leading the [[Rangers of the North]] to the aid of [[Aragorn]] in the south and the player travels across [[Eriador]] to assemble the [[Grey Company]] from their Ranger friends with whom they had become well-acquainted during the Angmar campaign. Led by [[Halbarad]] and the Sons of [[Elrond]], the Grey Company rides south but encounters several perils, first losing several Rangers in [[Enedwaith]] and then suffering another major loss due to a betrayal in [[Dunland]]. [[Saruman]]'s forces block the Company's passage across the Fords of Isen and as the Rangers recuperate, Lady Galadriel summons the player back to Lorien and tells them to follow the Felloship down the river [[Anduin]]. Accompanied by a girl from Dunland, an elf from Lorien and a man from [[Rohan]], the player follows the Fellowship to the Falls of Rauros, after which they follow the Three Hunters into the land of Rohan where they become closely familiar with many of the local rulers. Eventually the player fights in the [[battle of Helm's Deep]], after which they accompany King [[Th\u00e9oden]] to confront Saruman at [[Orthanc (Middle-earth)|Orthanc]] where the Rangers of the North finally meet with Aragorn.\n\n===Volume IV: The Strength of Sauron===\nAfter the Grey Company follows into the Paths of the Dead, the player follows them and arrived into [[Gondor]], which is now besieged by the [[Corsairs of Umbar]]. After making a stop at [[Dol Amroth]], the player catches up with Aragorn's forces and takes part in the Battle of [[Pelargir]], after which Aragorn bids them to find and inform either [[Faramir]] or [[Gandalf]] in [[Minas Tirith]] while his men will sail up Anduin in the Corsair ships. Unable to pass through the enemy blockade at Harlond, the player takes a detour through [[Ithilien]] and eventually reaches the besieged [[Osgiliath]], narrowly escaping with the remaining Rangers of Ithilien and reaching the White City just as Faramir is shot by a Morgul dart and rendered unconscious. The player assists Gandalf in preparing the city for a siege and just before the city gates are shut is send by the wizard to find King Th\u00e9oden's forces. The player reunites with their friends from Rohan in the [[Dr\u00faedain]] forest and fights in the [[battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. The player then joins the assembled Host of the West that marches through North Ithilien into [[Dagorlad]] and fights at the Battle of the Black Gates from where they see the [[One Ring]] destroyed and the forces of Sauron finally defeated.\n\n===The Black Book of Mordor: Where the Shadows Lie===\n{{main|The Lord of the Rings Online: Mordor}}\nAs Aragorn is crowned the King of Gondor, the Free Peoples of Middle-Earth begin to explore the lands of [[Mordor]] which were closed to them for over a thousand years. Assisting Gandalf, the player learns of the G\u00farzyul \u2013 powerful servants of the Enemy which unlike the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] did not perish with him and continue to pose a danger to the people of Middle-Earth. One of the G\u00farzyul known as Karazgar the Weeping Warrior has been suspiciously abscent from the power struggle in Mordor, having escaped into the northern lands. The player character and Gandalf give chase after him, through the ruins of [[Dol Guldur]] into the halls of King [[Thranduil]], eventually leading to the Kingdom Under the Mountain, now rules by Dain's son Thorin III. While running an errand for Thorin III in the [[Iron Hills]], the player comes upon an artifact from Mordor \u2013 a Black Book which they deliver to Gandalf for safekeeping. Karazgar's forces assault Erebor but are repelled and a company of dwarves departs to reclaim their ancient strongholds in [[Ered Mithrin]], believing them to be safe after the defeat of Sauron. They battle against Karazgar until Gandalf's reveals his weakness and learns that Karazgar desires the very book that he carries. Gandalf departs to the lands of [[Beorn]]ings in the Vales of Andiuin, where he and the player meet with the entourage of Lord Elrond who accompany Lady [[Arwen]] to her wedding in Minas Tirith.\n\n== Development and release history ==\n[[Sierra On-Line]] first announced the development of a licensed Middle-earth MMORPG in 1998.<ref>{{cite web | title=Middle-earth Online Memories \u2013 Part 1 | url=http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/795/795002p1.html | website=Rpgvault.ign.com | year=2007 | accessdate=April 22, 2009}}</ref> Sierra had financial troubles in 1999 and replaced the staff working on the game. Sierra continued to confirm development of the MMORPG but did not release any development details. [[Vivendi Universal Games]], the parent company of Sierra, secured eight-year rights to produce computer and video games based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' books in 2001. Vivendi announced an agreement with [[Turbine (company)|Turbine]] in 2003 to produce ''Middle-earth Online'' (at that time expected to be released in 2004). In March 2005, Turbine announced that it had bought the rights to make an MMORPG based on Tolkien's literature and that Turbine would publish ''The Lord of the Rings Online'' instead of Vivendi. A closed beta was announced on September 8, 2006. An open beta began on March 30, 2007, and was open to all who pre-ordered the game's Founders Club edition.

According to Thomas, all references that were made to the music of the peoples of Middle-earth in the books were used to extrapolate as much information as possible about the instruments and styles that each race would have used to create their music. This information was then used as the base for creating the score.<ref>{{cite web | title=Chance Thomas Invades Middle Earth |work=IGN | accessdate = June 12, 2008| url=http://music.ign.com/articles/791/791216p1.html}}</ref> In the first two years of the game Thomas and DiGregorio each contributed roughly half of all music, which was released as soundtrack CD available with the Special Edition of 2007 \"''Shadows of Angmar''\" or pre-order of 2008 ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria|Mines of Moria]]'' expansion, in addition to 61 songs that were made available for free in [[mp3]] format using a download manager released by Turbine.<ref>{{cite web | title=''Lord of the Rings Online'' Download Manager Release |work=Lord of the Rings Online | accessdate = June 12, 2008| url=http://forums.lotro.com/showthread.php?t=143442}}</ref> Their collaboration continued on the ''Mines of Moria'' soundtrack, released as a CD with the Collector's Edition of the expansion.\n\nNeither ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Siege of Mirkwood|Siege of Mirkwood]]'' nor ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Rise of Isengard|Rise of Isengard]]'' expansions received a dedicated soundtrack release, with no music added to the game between 2009 and 2012 made officially available until the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Riders of Rohan|Riders of Rohan]]'' expansion, for which Chance Thomas returned to work on LOTRO after years of absence, releasing a soundtrack available both on CD and as digital download.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], taking place during the time period of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Developed by [[Turbine, Inc.]], the game launched in North America, Australia, Japan, and Europe in spring 2007 as ''The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar''. Players could create characters of four races and seven classes and adventure throughout the region of [[Eriador]]. The next fall, ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria|Mines of Moria]]'' expansion was released, adding the region of [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] and two new playable classes. It was followed by the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Siege of Mirkwood|Siege of Mirkwood]]'' in December 2009. In 2010 the game underwent a shift from its original subscription-based payment model to being [[free-to-play]], with a paid subscription and an in-game store.\n\nThe game saw continued development, alternating between expansions and free updates, which added new content in the regions of [[The Lord of the Rings Online: Rise of Isengard|Isengard]], [[The Lord of the Rings Online: Riders of Rohan|Rohan]] and [[Gondor]]. In late 2016 it was announced that the publishing of the game would transfer from [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] to [[Daybreak Game Company]], with development being taken over by Standing Stone Games, made up of former Turbine staff.<ref name=\"Bree Royce\">{{cite news | url=http://massivelyop.com/2016/12/19/turbine-spins-lotro-and-ddo-teams-out-to-new-studio-using-daybreak-as-publisher/ | title=TURBINE SPINS ''Lord of the Rings Online'' AND DDO TEAMS OUT TO NEW STUDIO, USING DAYBREAK AS PUBLISHER | work=Massively Overpowered | date=December 19, 2016 | accessdate=December 20, 2016 | author=Bree Royce}}</ref> The game development continued and in 2017 the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mordor|Mordor]]'' expansion was released, bringing the main storyline to a close. The story then shifted to showing how various inhabitants of [[Middle-earth]] deal with the downfall of [[Sauron]], with ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Minas Morgul|Minas Morgul]]'' expansion released in 2019<ref>{{cite news | url=https://mmocourt.com/2019/02/26/lord-of-the-rings-online-expansion-to-include-minas-morgul-and-shelob/ | title=LORD OF THE RINGS ONLINE EXPANSION TO INCLUDE MINAS MORGUL AND SHELOB | work=MMOCourt | date=February 26, 2019| accessdate=August 27, 2019 | author=Michael}}</ref> and a [[Gundabad]]-themed expansion announced for 2021.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://massivelyop.com/2020/02/29/pax-east-2020-lotro-plans-aragorn-and-arwens-wedding-2021-expansion-as-ddo-teases-unicorns/| title=PAX East 2020: LOTRO plans Aragorn and Arwen's wedding plus 2021 expansion as DDO teases unicorns| work=MassivelyOP| date=February 29, 2020| accessdate=February 29, 2020| author=ree Royce}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nMuch of the gameplay is typical of the [[Massively multiplayer online game|Massive Multiplayer Online]] (MMO) format: the player controls a character [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] which can be moved around the game world and interacts with other players, [[non-player character]]s and other entities in the [[virtual world]]. Characters gain [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] by earning [[experience point]]s from defeating enemies and completing quests and improve their personal stats by equipping items and using consumable buffs. As characters increase in level, they earn both new skills and trait points, which can be assigned in various configurations to customize personal playstyle. Players can use the quest tracker to navigate objectives on the mini-map and traverse the game world either on foot or using personal mounts, which include horses, [[pony|ponie]]s, goats and, more recently, [[elk]]s. Instantaneous travel is also available by using in-game stable-masters and certain \"quick travel\" skills. In addition to the detailed Quest log, player characters also have a Deed log, which tracks their progress across a vast number of achievements, ranging from frivolous to being vital for character progression.\n\nAs opposed to other [[role-playing video game]]s, the equivalent of [[Health (gaming)|health]] or [[Health (gaming)|hit points]] in ''The Lord of the Rings Online'' is [[morale]], which can be raised via food, rest, music, and [[Battle cry|battle cries]], and characters whose morale reaches zero in combat are considered \"defeated\" instead of killed. The equivalent of [[Magic (gaming)|mana]] is called \"power\" because of the way [[Magic (Middle-earth)|magic]] in Tolkien's [[Middle-earth]] differs from other fantasy games such as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', except for the [[Beorn]]ing class, which uses \"wrath\" instead. Player characters can own a personal house, which can be decorated and provide additional storage. The crafting system allows each character to master up to three professions, which are separated into \"gathering\" of materials and actual \"crafting\" of usable items. In consistency with the characterization of [[Hobbit]]s in Tolkien's writings, a fair emphasis is placed on cooking and farming. Players can also customize the look of their characters by using the Cosmetic system, which can display armor and weapons other than those worn for combat effectiveness. In addition to character name, players can also choose their current PvMP rank and a title to be displayed.\n\n''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria|Mines of Moria]]'' added the concept of Legendary items, which gain experience points and levels alongside the player character, allowing them to increase in power over time. Each character can equip two class-specific legendary items (one of which is always the main weapon), which contain Legacies that provide modifiers to class-specific abilities. Alongside regular experience points, players gain Legendary Item experience, which can be applied to different Legendary items to increase their levels. Each item level in turn comes with a set amount of Legendary points, which can be assigned to specific Legacies to increase their potency. Players can further customize their Legendary items by naming them, giving them titles and slotting additional gems and runes. Characters can begin using Legendary items at level 50, but they have to be periodically replaced to make up for the difference in stats until level 100, when Legendary items can be \"imbued\". Imbued Legendary Items can stay relevant despite the increase in character level, but require the player to apply various crystals, scrolls and runes to remain so.\n\n''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Riders of Rohan|Riders of Rohan]]'' introduced the mounted combat to the game. While regular character mounts only provide a speed boost and a minimal protection against the attacks, the new rohirric war-steeds allow players to execute special \"mounted\" skills and attacks while on horseback. War-steeds have many of the same stats as player characters, including morale and power, and can be customized by selecting different types of war-steeds, investing in different trait lines and switching between different mounted stances. Players can also invest in a Legendary [[bridle]] item and customize the look of their war-steeds by mix-and-matching various appearance traits.\n\n=== Characters and races ===\n''Lord of the Rings Online'' launched with four playable races: [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], [[Hobbit]]s and [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lotro.com/en/explore/characters|title=Characters|work=The Lord of the Rings Online|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}</ref> In 2014 a new race of [[Beorn]]ings was added, although this race is only for the new class of the same name. ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mordor|Mordor]]'' expansion in 2017 added the new [[Calaquendi|High Elf]] race. In 2019 a new race of \"Stout-Axe Dwarves\" was added, representing a dwarven clan from the far east of Middle-Earth with an appearance distinct from that of Longbeard dwarves. Released as part of ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Minas Morgul|Minas Morgul]]'' expansion, Stout-Axes dwarves also allow players to choose either male or female sex for their character<ref>{{cite web|url=https://massivelyop.com/2019/08/03/lotro-announces-stout-axe-dwarves-ddo-reveals-alchemist-class-and-permadeath-server/|title=LOTRO announces Stout Axe Dwarves, DDO reveals Alchemist class and permadeath server|author = Justin Olivetti|work=Massively Overpowered|date=August 3, 2019|accessdate=August 27, 2019}}</ref> as with all other races, while the original Dwarven race only allows to create male characters. After selecting a character race, players are limited in choosing a character class based on that race, with the most radical exception being the Beorning race, which only allows the Beorning class.\n\nThe original seven character classes in the game are Burglar, Captain, Champion, Guardian, Hunter, Lore-master and Minstrel. ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria|Mines of Moria]]'' added the Rune-Keeper and Warden classes, while a tenth Beorning class was added in a regular update on November 2014. These three additional classes have to be unlocked by both free-to-play players and subscribers either through the in-game Store or by purchasing the ''Mines of Moria'' expansion. A character of each class can further specialize in one of the three trait lines that further determine their skills and combat role. While players can switch between different trait lines at will, each requires a specific set of gear and Legendary Items to complement and fully utilize it. In addition to Class traits, Racial and Virtue traits can also be earne and upgraded by completing specific quests and deeds.\n\n=== Game economy===\nAn in-game currency of gold, silver and copper coins allows player characters to accumulate wealth by completing quests and selling obtained loot and crafted items to NPCs or other players. Currency can also be used to acquire equipment from NPCs or players, pay to repair equipment after combat, fast travel, buy crafting materials, and purchase a house. Players can trade face-to-face, via in-game mail, or at in-game Auction Houses. LOTRO points (formerly \"Turbine points\") are used in the in-game store and can be both purchased with real money or earned in-game. LOTRO points can be spend on content unlocks, character boosts and convenience upgrades as well as \"Mithril Coins\", a meta-currency for various game-related purchases. The game also features a wide variety of barter currencies for specific regions, group instances and seasonal festivals, which are either placed in character bags or a Store-purchased \"Barter wallet\".\n\nOn reaching Level 15, players can purchase a house in an [[Instance dungeon|instanced]] neighborhood, which is shared between all of their characters on the same [[game server]]. Houses come in different sizes and include chests for additional storage, but require a weekly maintenance rent using in-game currency and can be locked on failure to pay upkeep. Players can decorate their houses by placing decorations and furniture obtained as rewards for various in-game activities, such as quests, deeds or seasonal festivals. Originally four themed neighborhoods were available based on the four playable races: Dwarves, Elves, Men and Hobbits. With the release of the first region in [[Gondor]], Premium Housing became available in the Cape of Belfalas area, with upkeep required in Mithril Coins instead of gold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lotro.com/en/game/articles/dev-diary-premium-housing|title=Dev Diary \u2013 Premium Housing|date=October 18, 2016|publisher=Turbine|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}</ref> Additional Premium Housing areas in [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] are slated for release in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://massivelyop.com/2019/04/06/lotro-announces-rohan-housing-while-ddo-is-slated-to-get-a-64-bit-client/|title=LOTRO announces Rohan housing while DDO is slated to get a 64-bit client|author = Justin Olivetti|work=Massively Overpowered|date=April 6, 2019|accessdate=August 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Deeds and reputation===\nDeeds are a means of tracking accomplishments for each character that are not part of any quest. Most common are regional deeds, found in all of the game's landscape regions, including Explorer, Slayer, Lore and Reputation deeds. Deeds are generally discovered upon completion of one of the goals of the deed (e.g., finding the first area of an Explorer deed or killing the first enemy of a Slayer deed), although some deeds are hidden and do not show up until all required objectives have been completed. Other deeds include those tied to individual character's class or race, while Epic story deeds are advanced by completing quests in the Epic Quest line. Additional deeds are also found in conjunction with the Skirmish and Instance features. A final Deed category is the Hobby, related to fishing, which currently is the only in-game Hobby. In addition, there are 'Meta' Deeds that require completion of several other deeds, usually all of the deeds in a region or in an Instance Cluster. Deed completion is generally rewarded by statistic boosts, often LOTRO points, and sometimes cosmetic/non-combat awards such as titles or emotes.\n\nReputation is the measure of how well acquainted a player is with a specific group or faction. Each region in ''The Lord of the Rings Online'' features one or several factions, reputation for which may be gained by completing quests, deeds, defeating specific monsters and using Reputation items. Reputation factions in the original game and in the ''Mines of Moria'' favored advancement by collecting and using Reputation items, while those from ''Siege of Mirkwood'' onward lean towards repeatable quests that provide a set amount of Reputation each day instead. Each Reputation faction includes vendors with a set of specific rewards unlocked at various tiers, ranging from cosmetic pets and outfits to top-tier weapons and armour. Crafting Guilds are special Reputation factions for the crafting skills that provide access to exclusive crafting recipes, and each character can join up to two Crafting Guilds at a time.\n\n===Fellowship and group instances===\nA fellowship is a band of up to six characters, created to complete quests and group instances, which can be formed and disbanded by the leader at any time. All players in a fellowship can communicate with each other in the fellowship chat panel, where a conversation is seen by all fellowship members. The fellowship leader also has the ability to invite or dismiss a member at any time. Members in a fellowship will also appear to each other on the regional maps, which enables them to easily find one another in the game world. A fellowship can also be transformed into a Raid, which can be composed of up to four separate fellowships and can contain anywhere from 6 to 24 players.\n\nFellowships (including those found in raids) can use the Fellowship Maneuver system to perform special group moves. Fellowship Maneuvers occur randomly and require that the target be stunned or knocked down in any group encounter with a \"signature\" or higher difficulty enemy. Certain classes also have special skills that can initiate Fellowship Maneuvers when triggered. When a Fellowship Maneuver is initiated, every player within the area will get a color wheel on their screen to choose one of four skill contributions, with different combinations resulting in different powerful attacks.\n\nFellowships are required to complete many of the group instances, which come in several different variations. A typical \"instance\" alternates between groups of strong enemies and [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] encounters which often features unique game mechanics and provide a chest of rewards upon defeat. \"Raids\" are similar to instances, but feature \"raid locks\" which prevent characters from killing each boss more than once a week, but also allow to track progress of a difficult raid across multiple game sessions. \"Skirmishes\" were introduced with the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Siege of Mirkwood|Siege of Mirkwood]]'' expansions and feature both enemy groups of random composition and randomized \"Skirmish Lieutenant\" encounters across the instance. \"Epic Battles\" were introduced with the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Helm's Deep|Helm's Deep]]'' expansion and represent large-scale battles, in which numerous friendly [[Non-player character|NPCs]] engage the enemy alongside the player characters, whose focus lies on supporting their allies and completing specific objectives during the battle as opposed to simply defeating all of the enemies. While some group instances are fixed in both their size and intended level, others can be played on different group sizes, levels and tiers of difficulty for progressively higher rewards.\n\nMonster Players in the game can also join Fellowships, though they are named Warbands instead. Monster characters (see below) in a PvP zone also gain access to the Fellowship Manoeuvers panel, which are renamed to Warband Maneuvers.\n\n=== World regions ===\nThe game's environment is [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], based on ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]''. It has been noted that the game's license does not cover rights to any other works in [[Tolkien's legendarium]], such as ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Turbine |url=http://www.lotro-europe.com/faq.php?type=About+Game#About%20Game |title=\"Is The Lord of the Rings Online (LOTRO) based on the movies or the books?\" and \"What about The Silmarillion?\" at the official FAQ |date=n.d. |accessdate=November 15, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127032914/http://www.lotro-europe.com/faq.php?type=About+Game#About%20Game |archivedate=November 27, 2007}}</ref> The game world is broadly divided into larger sections of [[Eriador]], [[Rhovanion]], [[Gondor]] and [[Mordor]]. It is then divided into separate \"Regions\", which are then further further sub-divided into \"Areas\". In the original game regions the area division served mostly navigational purpose, but from [[Enedwaith]] onwards each area usually has a distinctive landscape aesthetic and its own separate storyline. The game's distinction of regions does not always match that of Tolkien's original definitions: for example, Northfarthing of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] is considered to be part of [[Evendim]] region, [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] is considered to be part of [[Rhovanion]] and [[Gondor|Kingdom of Gondor]] is split into several smaller regions.\n\nEach region in the game contains [[non-player character]]<nowiki/>s (NPCs) and quests within an established player character level range, with the main Epic storyline usually serving as a guide between the region's areas in progression from lowest to highest level. Each region also has a capital settlement, but only a few regions feature a proper \"hub\" for player activities, which is commonly defined as an area which includes all major in-game services for player characters, such as vault-keepers, auction houses and crafting halls. It is important to note that each Region is considered to be permanently set in a specific point in time during the [[War of the Ring]] despite the passage of time in the main story: this means that many characters such as [[Gandalf]] or [[Aragorn]] can be present in multiple places at once if those places are set during different portions of the story. Several major locations are even permanently available in more than one state: for example players can freely move from [[Isengard]] flooded by the [[Ent]]s to Isengard at the height of [[Saruman]]'s power and from [[Minas Tirith]] rebuilding after the [[battle of the Pelennor Fields]] to Minas Tirith before the battle, with the enemy still at the doorstep.\n\n=== Player vs Monster Player ===\nClassic [[Player versus player|Player vs. Player]] (PvP) combat, found in many other MMOs, does not exist in ''The Lord of the Rings Online''. Free People characters can only \"spar\" each other on request and for no rewards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Spar|title=Spar|website=Lotro-wiki.com|accessdate=May 2, 2019}}</ref> Instead, Player vs Monster Player (also known as PvMP or Monster Play)<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lotro.com/article/313|title=Game Systems: Monster Play Overview|date=n.d.|publisher=Turbine|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225021407/http://www.lotro.com/article/313|archivedate=February 25, 2008|accessdate=March 8, 2008}} \u2013 this reference is historical only.</ref> system allows players to create \"Monster player\" characters and engage Free People in combat in special secluded areas.\n\nMonster player classes are Orc Reaver, Orc Defiler, Spider Weaver, Uruk Blackarrow, Uruk Warleader and Warg Stalker.

The main storyline (also known as the \"Epic Quest Line\") is presented as a series of \"Books\", which consist of series of quests called \"Chapters\". Initially eight Books were available at the game's release, with a new book added with each content update. After the game's transion to [[free-to-play]] new Books stopped being strictly tied to updates, with some major updates containing no new Books while others adding several Books at once instead.\n\n===Volume I: Shadows of Angmar===\nThe original Epic Story focused mostly on events that were new additions to the ''Lord of the Rings'' story by the creators of the game. Starting shorly after [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and his company had left [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], the player character makes it to [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], where they become acquainted to [[Aragorn]] and [[Gandalf]] and become involved in the larger affairs of [[Middle-Earth]]. After initially following in the footsteps of Aragorn and the Hobbits to [[Weathertop]] and the [[Trollshaws]] where they track the single [[Nazg\u00fbl|Black Rider]] that was not swept away at the [[Ford of Bruinen]], the player character soon gets involved into a campaign against resurgent [[Angmar]], eventually stopping the plans of several powerful servants of The Witch King across [[Eriador]].\n\n*'''Book I \u2013 Stirrings in the Darkness''' \u2013 After the introductions, the player is sent to [[Aragorn]], who needs help weakening the Blackwolds, a hostile gang within Bree-land, loyal to [[Saruman|Sharkey]]. After helping Aragorn and the [[Ranger (Middle-earth)|Rangers]], the player is sent to [[Tom Bombadil]] to destroy the evil in Othrongroth, the Great Barrow of the [[Barrow-downs]]. Though the Wightlord Sambrog is defeated, the [[Witch-king]] and his servants, Ivar and Skorgrim, escape the player's pursuit. Upon returning to [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], the player discovers Aragorn has left with the [[Hobbit]]s and instead meets [[Gandalf]], who arrived too late to help. The player is then instructed by Gandalf (who leaves for [[Rivendell]] as well) to locate one of Gandalf's fellow [[Istari]], [[Radagast the Brown]].\n*'''Book II \u2013 The Red Maid''' \u2013 The player is sent to the Ranger Candaith, who tries to learn the location of [[Radagast the Brown]] for the player. While waiting, the player investigates the mysterious events that happened on [[Weathertop]] and fights the [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orc]] army around and on top of the hill. By the time the enemy is defeated, Candaith has found Radagast in the city of Ost Guruth and sends the player to meet him. Radagast asks for the player's help in cleansing the area of Garth Agarwen from the evil [[Barrow-wight|wights]] that inhabit it. Ultimately the player and Radagast fight Ivar the Bloodhand, their leader and servant of the [[Witch-king]]. Upon succeeding, the player is urgently sent to the North Downs to aid the Rangers in those lands.\n*'''Book III \u2013 The Council of the North''' \u2013 The player is asked by [[Halbarad]] to aid in the defense of the North Downs against [[Angmar]]'s forces, by uniting the three main armies of the North Downs: the Men of the town of Trestlebridge, the local Dwarves led by [[Dori (Middle-earth)|Dori]], and [[Gildor]]'s Elves. After accomplishing this, the player is sent to Rivendell, where the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] has now safely arrived.\n*'''Book IV \u2013 Chasing Shadows''' \u2013 [[Nazg\u00fbl|The Black Rider]] that survived the Flood of [[Bruinen]] by [[Elrond]] is still somewhere in the [[Trollshaws]], making it impossible for the Fellowship to leave. With the help of [[Legolas]], Elladan and Elrohir, the player chases the [[Nazg\u00fbl]], destroying the Trolls he has corrupted, and forcing the Ringwraith to retreat to the [[Misty Mountains]]. The player is sent to pursue him, where [[Gl\u00f3in]] and some Dwarves have set up a camp.\n*'''Book V \u2013 The Last Refuge''' \u2013 The player's search for the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] brings him/her to the final stronghold of Skorgr\u00edm and the Dourhands, the corrupted Dwarves. An assault led by [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] results in the fall of Skorgrim and his servants. But the Nazg\u00fbl has fled to Helegrod, where a long-dead [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragon]] Thorog has been reanimated as a wight to serve the [[Sauron|Dark Lord]]. The player arrives just in time to stop the Nazg\u00fbl, defeating him and making him lose control of the Dragon, who escapes. Now that [[Rivendell]] is safe, it is time to move on to [[Angmar]] itself.\n*'''Book VI \u2013 Fires in the North''' \u2013 Rangers of the North, led by Corunir and Golodir, have gone to [[Angmar]] and their kinsmen want to know what has become of them. Upon arriving in Angmar, the player finds Corunir safe in a friendly Hillmen village. He begs the player to find his lost company, who passed through Rammas Deluon: a great series of statues that weaken (or even kill) those who pass it. After destroying the spirits within them, the player becomes able to resist the power of Rammas Deluon, and finds a hidden [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]] settlement, where a part of the scattered party lives.\n*'''Book VII \u2013 The Hidden Hope''' \u2013 The player is informed that Golodir is settled at Gath Forthnir, far in the North. Upon arriving there, (s)he finds that Golodir is long gone and the Rangers are led by his daughter, Lorniel. Lorniel reveals that Golodir has been captured by Mordirith, Steward of [[Angmar]], and has been locked away in [[Carn D\u00fbm]]. As leader of the remaining Rangers, and with the help of the Elf Laerdan, Lorniel launches an assault on Carn D\u00fbm, where she is slain by Mordirith, who then releases broken Golodir in a mockery, to continue his torture.\n*'''Book VIII \u2013 The Scourge of the North''' \u2013 Golodir's grief for the death of his daughter has almost destroyed him, yet he sees a chance to avenge her. Reclaiming an ancient sword, he travels with the player to the heart of [[Carn D\u00fbm]], defeating Mordirith with his blade. But then Mordirith's ''[[palant\u00edr]]'', a great seeing-stone he used to torture Golodir, is quickly taken by the mysterious Sara Oakheart.\n*'''Book IX \u2013 Shores of Evendim''' \u2013 The player learns that Sara Oakheart is none other than [[Amarthiel]], the legendary Champion of Angmar. She has set up a plot within a tower of Barad Gularan to use the player to weaken Mordirith. Now that she has the ''[[palant\u00edr]]'', she can communicate with [[Sauron]] and challenge Mordirith's position. The player is sent to kill all of Mordirith's Knights, in an attempt to further weaken his power. But despite the player's victories over Mordirith, Amarthiel only grows stronger. After losing Fornost and Barad Gularan, she moves to Ann\u00faminas, the ancient capital of Arnor. The Rangers there, led by Calenglad, need the player's aid.\n*'''Book X \u2013 The City of Kings''' \u2013 A massive battle in Ann\u00faminas ensues and the wise [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] Laerdan offers his services to Calenglad. Mordrambor, one of [[Amarthiel]]'s captains, is captured, but while in captivity he poisons the mind of Laerdan, making the Elf decide to fight Amarthiel on his own, in an attempt to make up for his mistakes in the past. Again the Free Peoples have been tricked by Amarthiel and her servants. Together with the Rangers of [[Evendim]], the player is able to wrestle the ''[[palant\u00edr]]'' from Amarthiel's clutches, but Laerdan is lost. However, within the ''palant\u00edr'', Amarthiel saw a glimpse of where Narchuil, her ancient ring, lies. She is now determined to possess its power once more.\n*'''Book XI \u2013 Prisoner of the Free Peoples''' \u2013 [[Amarthiel]]'s captain Mordrambor breaks free, killing many Rangers. Soon he leads an army out of Ann\u00faminas, to find Amarthiel's Ring, Narchuil. The player attempts to find Narchuil before Amarthiel can, searching the ancient ruins of the [[Trollshaws]]. After much searching, it turns out Narmeleth, Laerdan's daughter, who originally caused Amarthiel's fall in Fornost, has become possessed by her. But all searching seems in vain, when it is revealed Amarthiel has already found Narchuil. However, [[Elrond]] does not fall for her trickery again; he realizes Narchuil is still out there, and Laerdan knows where.\n*'''Book XII \u2013 The Ashen Wastes''' \u2013 [[Amarthiel]] has Laerdan transported to [[Angmar]], where she learns from him under torture where her Ring is. In a brave attempt to save both Laerdan and the ring Narchuil, the player is able to get to them before Amarthiel does, but only half of the ring was found. Laerdan confesses to [[Elrond]] he has broken the Narchuil in two, and reveals where the other part should be. But then he swears an oath upon [[Varda|Elbereth]] that he will not rest before he has saved his daughter, and leaves the Council.\n*'''Book XIII \u2013 Doom of the Last King''' \u2013 Trying to find out more about the other half of Narchuil, the player is sent to Forochel. However Amarthiel's forces have already arrived, and their search is underway. In an attempt to find the ring before the Angmarim, the player receives help from the shade of the Last King Arvedui. During a confrontation with the enemy, it appears that Mordrambor has betrayed [[Amarthiel]]: the two battle each other and disappear from the view. The player then retrieves the second half of Narchuil and returns it to Rivendell.\n*'''Book XIV \u2013 The Ring-forges of Eregion''' \u2013 Still seeking to save Narmeleth, Laerdan travels with the two-halves of Narchuil to Eregion. [[Amarthiel]], baiting him in, reclaims Narchuil for herself. Elrond sends many Heralds of [[Rivendell]] to all corners of [[Eriador]] to help him in his search for the lost Ring-lore. But all efforts are too late, for Narchuil has been reforged when the Free Peoples reach Eregion. It quickly becomes clear none are able to withstand Narchuil, until Mordrambor, Amarthiel's former servant, arrives. Sowing confusion in her, he shows her the arrival of Mordirith, who is in power once again, but Amarthiel does not surrender and believes she can defeat him with use of Narchuil. However, Mordirith has the power of the [[Witch-king]] and defeats her, claiming Narchuil as his own. Just as he is about to finish Amarthiel, Laerdan appears. He reveals his knowledge that Mordirith is actually E\u00e4rnur, the last King of [[Gondor]], taken captive by the Witch-King and made a Wraith in mockery of his former defiance. Under Mordirith's orders Mordrambor kills Laerdan, after which the two leave. Amarthiel is devastated by the loss of her father, and taken captive by the Free Peoples.\n*'''Book XV \u2013 Daughter of Strife''' \u2013 With the death of her father, Narmeleth is once again freed from the evil influence of Amarthiel. She becomes a captive of the Free Peoples, but volunteers to avenge her father. In Angmar, the final battle between the Free People and Mordirith ensues. First Mordrambor is defeated and Narchuil is finally destroyed by Narmeleth. In the final confrontation, she sacrifices herself to defeat Mordirith. The book ends bittersweet with Narmeleth's redemption and her death and Elrond comforts the player, saying that she had found peace in the Undying Lands.\n\n===Volume II: Mines of Moria===\n{{main|The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria#Storyline}}\nUnder orders of King [[Dain Ironfoot]], a company of dwarves from [[Erebor]] known as the Iron Garrison is sent to investigate and potentially reclaim [[Moria]]. By sheer luck, they arrive mere days after Gandalf had fought and defeated [[Durin's Bane]], throwing the denizens of Moria into disarray. Using the power vacuum in the wake of the [[Balrog]]'s demise, the dwarves quickly claim major ground and establish several footholds within [[Khazad-d\u00fbm]], but soon begin to face ever greater peril as the forces of evil in Moria begin to unite under new leadership. Making an alliance with the Elves of [[Lothlorien]] the dwarves attempt to hold their ground when a personal emissary of [[Sauron]] himself arrives from [[Dol Guldur]] to put an end to their expedition. This story concludes in the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Siege of Mirkwood|Siege of Mirkwood]]'' expansion where the [[Galadhrim]] launch a major assault agaist Dol Guldur in an effort to draw the Eye of the enemy away from the Fellowhip as it departs from Lorien.\n\n===Volume III: Allies of the King===\n{{main|The Lord of the Rings Online: Siege of Mirkwood#Storyline|The Lord of the Rings Online: Rise of Isengard#Storyline|The Lord of the Rings Online: Riders of Rohan#Storyline|The Lord of the Rings Online: Helm's Deep#Storyline}}\nLady [[Galadriel]] tasks the player with leading the [[Rangers of the North]] to the aid of [[Aragorn]] in the south and the player travels across [[Eriador]] to assemble the [[Grey Company]] from their Ranger friends with whom they had become well-acquainted during the Angmar campaign. Led by [[Halbarad]] and the Sons of [[Elrond]], the Grey Company rides south but encounters several perils, first losing several Rangers in [[Enedwaith]] and then suffering another major loss due to a betrayal in [[Dunland]]. [[Saruman]]'s forces block the Company's passage across the Fords of Isen and as the Rangers recuperate, Lady Galadriel summons the player back to Lorien and tells them to follow the Felloship down the river [[Anduin]]. Accompanied by a girl from Dunland, an elf from Lorien and a man from [[Rohan]], the player follows the Fellowship to the Falls of Rauros, after which they follow the Three Hunters into the land of Rohan where they become closely familiar with many of the local rulers. Eventually the player fights in the [[battle of Helm's Deep]], after which they accompany King [[Th\u00e9oden]] to confront Saruman at [[Orthanc (Middle-earth)|Orthanc]] where the Rangers of the North finally meet with Aragorn.\n\n===Volume IV: The Strength of Sauron===\nAfter the Grey Company follows into the Paths of the Dead, the player follows them and arrived into [[Gondor]], which is now besieged by the [[Corsairs of Umbar]]. After making a stop at [[Dol Amroth]], the player catches up with Aragorn's forces and takes part in the Battle of [[Pelargir]], after which Aragorn bids them to find and inform either [[Faramir]] or [[Gandalf]] in [[Minas Tirith]] while his men will sail up Anduin in the Corsair ships. Unable to pass through the enemy blockade at Harlond, the player takes a detour through [[Ithilien]] and eventually reaches the besieged [[Osgiliath]], narrowly escaping with the remaining Rangers of Ithilien and reaching the White City just as Faramir is shot by a Morgul dart and rendered unconscious. The player assists Gandalf in preparing the city for a siege and just before the city gates are shut is send by the wizard to find King Th\u00e9oden's forces. The player reunites with their friends from Rohan in the [[Dr\u00faedain]] forest and fights in the [[battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. The player then joins the assembled Host of the West that marches through North Ithilien into [[Dagorlad]] and fights at the Battle of the Black Gates from where they see the [[One Ring]] destroyed and the forces of Sauron finally defeated.\n\n===The Black Book of Mordor: Where the Shadows Lie===\n{{main|The Lord of the Rings Online: Mordor}}\nAs Aragorn is crowned the King of Gondor, the Free Peoples of Middle-Earth begin to explore the lands of [[Mordor]] which were closed to them for over a thousand years. Assisting Gandalf, the player learns of the G\u00farzyul \u2013 powerful servants of the Enemy which unlike the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] did not perish with him and continue to pose a danger to the people of Middle-Earth. One of the G\u00farzyul known as Karazgar the Weeping Warrior has been suspiciously abscent from the power struggle in Mordor, having escaped into the northern lands. The player character and Gandalf give chase after him, through the ruins of [[Dol Guldur]] into the halls of King [[Thranduil]], eventually leading to the Kingdom Under the Mountain, now rules by Dain's son Thorin III. While running an errand for Thorin III in the [[Iron Hills]], the player comes upon an artifact from Mordor \u2013 a Black Book which they deliver to Gandalf for safekeeping. Karazgar's forces assault Erebor but are repelled and a company of dwarves departs to reclaim their ancient strongholds in [[Ered Mithrin]], believing them to be safe after the defeat of Sauron. They battle against Karazgar until Gandalf's reveals his weakness and learns that Karazgar desires the very book that he carries. Gandalf departs to the lands of [[Beorn]]ings in the Vales of Andiuin, where he and the player meet with the entourage of Lord Elrond who accompany Lady [[Arwen]] to her wedding in Minas Tirith.\n\n== Development and release history ==\n[[Sierra On-Line]] first announced the development of a licensed Middle-earth MMORPG in 1998.<ref>{{cite web | title=Middle-earth Online Memories \u2013 Part 1 | url=http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/795/795002p1.html | website=Rpgvault.ign.com | year=2007 | accessdate=April 22, 2009}}</ref> Sierra had financial troubles in 1999 and replaced the staff working on the game. Sierra continued to confirm development of the MMORPG but did not release any development details. [[Vivendi Universal Games]], the parent company of Sierra, secured eight-year rights to produce computer and video games based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' books in 2001. Vivendi announced an agreement with [[Turbine (company)|Turbine]] in 2003 to produce ''Middle-earth Online'' (at that time expected to be released in 2004). In March 2005, Turbine announced that it had bought the rights to make an MMORPG based on Tolkien's literature and that Turbine would publish ''The Lord of the Rings Online'' instead of Vivendi.

According to Thomas, all references that were made to the music of the peoples of Middle-earth in the books were used to extrapolate as much information as possible about the instruments and styles that each race would have used to create their music. This information was then used as the base for creating the score.<ref>{{cite web | title=Chance Thomas Invades Middle Earth |work=IGN | accessdate = June 12, 2008| url=http://music.ign.com/articles/791/791216p1.html}}</ref> In the first two years of the game Thomas and DiGregorio each contributed roughly half of all music, which was released as soundtrack CD available with the Special Edition of 2007 \"''Shadows of Angmar''\" or pre-order of 2008 ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria|Mines of Moria]]'' expansion, in addition to 61 songs that were made available for free in [[mp3]] format using a download manager released by Turbine.<ref>{{cite web | title=''Lord of the Rings Online'' Download Manager Release |work=Lord of the Rings Online | accessdate = June 12, 2008| url=http://forums.lotro.com/showthread.php?t=143442}}</ref> Their collaboration continued on the ''Mines of Moria'' soundtrack, released as a CD with the Collector's Edition of the expansion. \n\nNeither ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Siege of Mirkwood|Siege of Mirkwood]]'' nor ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Rise of Isengard|Rise of Isengard]]'' expansions received a dedicated sountrack release, with no music added to the game between 2009 and 2012 made officially available until the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Riders of Rohan|Riders of Rohan]]'' expansion, for which Chance Thomas returned to work on LOTRO after years of absence, releasing a soundtrack available both on CD and as digital download. Music for the next year's ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Helm's Deep|Helm's Deep]]'' expansion was entirely composed by Stephen DiGregorio and was released as an album on [[Soundcloud]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://soundcloud.com/stevedgamecomposer/sets/the-lord-of-the-rings-online|title=The Lord of the Rings Online\u2122: Helm's Deep\u2122 OST|accessdate= March 6, 2020 |first = Stephen | last =DiGregorio | publisher = Soundcloud| date = November 8, 2013}}</ref> while music added between 2013 and 2017 was likewise not covered by any official releases. In 2017 Chance Thomas returned once more to contribute music to the game, releasing a soundtrack album for ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mordor|Mordor]]'' expansion in addition to a commemorative 10th Anniversary Soundtrack which covered a collection of his work for the game from all previous soundtracks. After Mordor all music so far has been composed by Bill Champagne, with full soundtracks for free updates and expansions alike released on the game's Youtube channel. Soundtrack for ''Lord of the Rings Online'' has received much praise for its quality and variety.<ref name=\"gamespot review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/middleearthonline/review.html?sid=6170521 |title=Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar Review |accessdate=April 24, 2007 |date=May 10, 2007 | first = Kevin | last = VanOrd | publisher = [[GameSpot]]}}</ref><ref name=\"ign review\">{{cite web |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/787/787942p1.html |title= The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar Review.

There was also division known as [[North East 1]] that began in 1987 for clubs based in the north-east but this was a seventh (later eighth) tier league.  Currently, the division is made up of teams from around the [[North East England|North Eastern area of England]], principally [[County Durham]], [[Cumbria]], [[East Yorkshire]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[Northumberland]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[Tyne and Wear]], and [[West Yorkshire]], who play home and away matches throughout a winter season.\n\nThe league champions are automatically promoted to the [[North Premier]], whilst the second placed team enters into a play-off match with the second placed team in the equivalent division [[North 1 West]].

Figures in brackets in the drawn games column represent points won in such shootouts.\n*{{note label|1952 season|B|B}} The [[1952 Yugoslav First League]] was shortened and completed over a period of three and a half months, beginning on 2 March and ending on 22 June. The reason for the changes was a desire to start the next season in the fall of 1952, thus implementing the fall\u2013spring format that had become a norm all across Europe by this time. The clubs were initially divided into two groups of six teams each, where everyone within a given group played each other twice (home and away). The statistics for the 1952 season thus show season totals and not just the final standings in the second stage group.\n*{{note label|earthquake|C|C}} Vardar was initially relegated, but was decided that would be allowed to remain in the top-flight Yugoslav First League the following season due to the devastating [[1963 Skopje earthquake|earthquake that hit Skopje]] in July 1963. The thinking on the part of Yugoslav politicians was that having a team in the top-tier league would be a boost to the morale of inhabitants of Skopje.\n*{{note label|1986-87 season|D|D}} Due to the match-fixing scandal in the 1985\u201386 season, ten clubs had started the [[1986\u201387 Yugoslav First League]] season with a deduction of 6 points. [[FK Vardar|Vardar]], who had not been deducted any points, won the title and participated in the [[1987\u201388 European Cup]]. After post-season legal proceedings the situation was resolved in July 1987 with a court ruling which nullified the deductions and which meant that the title was given back to Partizan and that Vardar finished the season in fifth place.<ref name=\"yugoteams\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesj/joeg-ec.html|title=Yugoslav teams in Eurocups|last=Miladinovich|first=Misha|date=16 December

Figures in brackets in the drawn games column represent points won in such shootouts.\n*{{note label|1952 season|B|B}} The [[1952 Yugoslav First League]] was shortened and completed over a period of three and a half months, beginning on 2 March and ending on 22 June. The reason for the changes was a desire to start the next season in the fall of 1952, thus implementing the fall\u2013spring format that had become a norm all across Europe by this time. The clubs were initially divided into two groups of six teams each, where everyone within a given group played each other twice (home and away). The statistics for the 1952 season thus show season totals and not just the final standings in the second stage group.\n*{{note label|earthquake|C|C}} Vardar was initially relegated, but was decided that would be allowed to remain in the top-flight Yugoslav First League the following season due to the devastating [[1963 Skopje earthquake|earthquake that hit Skopje]] in July 1963. The thinking on the part of Yugoslav politicians was that having a team in the top-tier league would be a boost to the morale of inhabitants of Skopje.\n*{{note label|1986-87 season|D|D}} Due to the match-fixing scandal in the 1985\u201386 season, ten clubs had started the [[1986\u201387 Yugoslav First League]] season with a deduction of 6 points. [[FK Vardar|Vardar]], who had not been deducted any points, won the title and participated in the [[1987\u201388 European Cup]]. After post-season legal proceedings the situation was resolved in July 1987 with a court ruling which nullified the deductions and which meant that the title was given back to Partizan and that Vardar finished the season in fifth place.<ref name=\"yugoteams\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesj/joeg-ec.html|title=Yugoslav teams in Eurocups|last=Miladinovich|first=Misha|date=16 December 1999|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=21 July 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"yugochamps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesj/joegchamp.html|title=Yugoslavia/Serbia (and Montenegro) - List of Champions|last=Stokkermans|first=Karel|date=21 May 2010|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=21 July 2017}}</ref>\n*{{note label|2010-11 season|E|E}} Vardar was initially relegated, but was stayed in the league because of fusion with [[FK Miravci|Miravci]].<ref name=\"vardarmiravci\">{{cite web|url=http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/18448/2/|title=Official, FK Vardar Stays in First Division|date=23 June 2011|publisher=MINA|accessdate=21 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|FK Vardar}}\n*[https://fkvardar.mk/ Official website] {{in lang|mk}}\n\n{{FK Vardar}}\n{{FK Vardar seasons}}\n\n[[Category:FK Vardar|Seasons]]\n[[Category:FK Vardar seasons| ]]\n[[Category:North Macedonia football club seasons|Vardar]]\n[[Category:Association football in North Macedonia lists|Vardar Seasons]]\n", "name_user": "Jolicnikola", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSFR Yugoslavia (1947\u20131992)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FK_Vardar_seasons"}

Its height is {{convert|63|ft}}, circumference is {{convert|32|ft}} and spread is {{convert|73|ft}}.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe Marlboro Tree, located in [[Marlboro Township, New Jersey]] is certified by the [[New Jersey|State of New Jersey]] as the largest known example of this tree in the state. It is about 152 years old and measures {{convert|76|ft}} in height and {{convert|19.7|ft}} in circumference. Five grown people must hold hands to fully encircle the tree.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/NJ/200003335.html Marlboro Tree]</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\nBlack willow roots are very bitter, and have been used as a substitute for [[quinine]] in the past.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gunn|first1=John C.|title=Gunn's Newest Family Physician|location=Google Books|pages=807\u2013811|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8OYrAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA809 |accessdate=2014-12-23|year=1883}}</ref> Ethnobotanical uses of black willow by various Native American tribes include basketry, and treatment of fever, headache, and coughs.<ref>http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Salix+nigra</ref>  The bark of the tree contains [[salicylic acid]], a chemical compound similar to [[aspirin]] (acetylsalicylic acid).\n\nThe black willow is the only United States native species to be used as timber for a variety of different items. The black willow lumber is used in furniture and shipping containers. The largest production site for black willow timber was in Louisiana at its peak in the years of 1970. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/usda/amwood/271black.pdf|title=Black Willow, An American Wood|last=|first=|date=July 1985|website=United States Department of Agriculture|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIt may also be used as an environmental restorative. Swamp trees in general are, by necessity, good at surviving and thriving in areas where highly mobile environmental toxins are present. Black Willow is very resistant to herbivory and flooding and is also a fantastic [[erosion control]] tool. Thus, it is useful for any sort of marshland stabilization or restorative as long as the roots don't penetrate any clay liner that may be in place.<ref>S. Li, L. Martin, S. Pezeshki and F.
