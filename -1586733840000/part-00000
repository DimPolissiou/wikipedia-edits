Its original stand out feature was the aerial imagery.<ref>https://www.geek.com/news/msn-offers-msn-virtual-earth-558930/</ref> The original version lacked many of its distinguishing features, including birds' eye view and 3D maps, and the Collections functionality was limited to a single \"Scratchpad\" of points of interest.\n\nIn December 2005, Virtual Earth was replaced by '''Windows Live Local''', featuring improvements, technologies from [[Pictometry International]], and integrated with the Local Search index on [[Windows Live Search]].<ref>https://www.pcworld.com/article/123847/article.html</ref> On November 6, 2006, Microsoft added the ability to view the maps in [[3D model|3D]] using a [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] managed control and managed interfaces to [[Direct3D]]. Microsoft subsequently referred to this product officially as \"''Live Search Maps''\", integrating it as part of its Live Search services.\n\nOn June 3, 2009, Microsoft officially rebranded Live Search Maps as ''Bing Maps'', and the Virtual Earth platform as ''Bing Maps for Enterprise''.\n\nIn 2010, Microsoft added an [[OpenStreetMap]] layer to Bing Maps.<ref>https://blogs.bing.com/maps/2010/08/02/bing-maps-adds-openstreetmap</ref> From 2012, [[Nokia]] (formerly [[Navteq]]) powered many aspects of Bing Maps as an extension to its [[Windows Phone 7]] partnership with Microsoft, including mapping data, geocoding, traffic data and navigation.<ref>https://www.gottabemobile.com/nokia-to-power-bing-maps-as-result-of-windows-phone-7-deal/</ref><ref>https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/20/3098821/microsoft-nokia-maps-windows-phone-8</ref><ref>https://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2012/05/24/bing-maps-taps-nokia-to-power-its-traffic-feature-and-geocoding-information/</ref> As of 2018, [[Here (company)|Here]] (formerly Nokia) continues to provide street data for Bing Maps.<ref>https://blog.capterra.com/bing-maps-vs-google-maps/</ref>\n\n===Updates===\n* v1 (Beagle) (July 2005)\n* v2 (Calypso) (December 2005) - \"Bird's-eye imagery\" released\n* v2.5 (February 2006)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061017034033/http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%211415.entry v3 (Discovery)] (May 2006) - Real time traffic, collections, new [[API]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061017032552/http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%214097.entry v4 (Endeavour)] (September 2006) - People search, drawing on maps, new imagery\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061208095437/http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%217573.entry v5 (Spaceland)] (November 2006) - 3D viewer, building models in 15 cities\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080223100822/http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%217986.entry Data update] (December 2006) - New 3D models and high-resolution imagery for 6 new areas\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070630230746/http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%218017.entry Data update] (January 2007) - Over 100 European cities with bird's-eye coverage added\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080223101136/http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%218457.entry Data update] (29 March 2007) - 3.8TB of bird's-eye imagery, [[orthophoto]]s and 3D models of 5 British cities\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080223100254/http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%218495.entry v5.5 (Falcon)] (3 April 2007) VE 3D plugin for Firefox, [[GeoRSS]] support, area calculations\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080223100836/http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%219276.entry v6 (Gemini)] (15 October 2007) - New data, party maps, traffic based routing, v6 MapControl, Bird's Eye in 3D, etc.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080512082323/http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%2114129.entry v6.1 (GoliatH)] (10 April 2008) - Improved quality of 3D models, improved KML support and new export capabilities, street labels on Bird's Eye imagery, MapCruncher integration, [[High-definition video|HD]] filming capabilities, Clearflow traffic report system\n* [http://blogs.msdn.com/virtualearth/archive/2008/09/24/new-feature-release-of-live-search-maps.aspx v6.2 (Helios)] (24 September 2008) - Multi-point driving directions, landmarks in directions, weather, real stars, new data\n* [http://blogs.msdn.com/virtualearth/archive/2008/12/29/virtual-earth-data-release-december-2008.aspx Data Update] (29 December 2008) - 48TB of road network data\n* [http://blogs.msdn.com/virtualearth/archive/2009/04/09/virtual-earth-api-release-information-april-2009.aspx v6.2 (Ikonos)] (14 April 2009) - Performance improvements\n* Bing (3 June 2009)\n* [http://www.bing.com/community/blogs/maps/archive/2009/12/02/bing-maps-adds-streetside-enhanced-bird-s-eye-photosynth-and-more.aspx?WT.mc_ID=Twitter Bing Maps Silverlight Beta] (2 December 2009) - Silverlight, Twitter, Streetside\n* (Oslo) (11 June 2010) - Silverlight improvements\n* (Boston M4) (December 2010) - [http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/maps/archive/2010/12/15/announcing-v1-1-of-the-new-map-style.aspx New map style] [https://web.archive.org/web/20110131164345/http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/maps/archive/2010/12/07/bing-s-new-mall-maps-get-in-get-out-and-the-avoid-the-crowds.aspx Venue maps]\n\n===Imagery updates===\nBing maps frequently update and expand the geographic areas covered by their imagery, with new updates being released on roughly a monthly basis. Each imagery release typically contains more than 10TB of imagery.\n\nHowever, the necessary time-lapse before images are updated means that aerial and Bird's-Eye images for a particular location can sometimes be several years out-of-date. This is particularly noticeable in locations that have undergone rapid recent development or experienced other dramatic changes since the imagery was taken, such as areas affected by natural disasters.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Street maps===\nUsers can browse and search topographically-shaded [[street map]]s for many cities worldwide. Maps include certain points of interest built in, such as metro stations, stadiums, hospitals, and other facilities. It is also possible to browse public user-created points of interest. Searches can cover public collections, businesses or types of business, locations, or people. Five street map views are available: Road View, Aerial View, Bird's Eye View, Street Side View, and 3D View.\n\n====Road view====\n:Road view is the default map view and displays vector imagery of roads, buildings, and geography. The data from which the default road map is rendered is licensed from [[Navteq]]. In certain parts of the world, road view maps from alternative data providers are also available. For example, when viewing a map of [[London]], the user may see road data from the [[Collins Bartholomew]] London Street Map. In all parts of the UK, road data from the [[Ordnance survey|Ordnance Survey]] can also be displayed. A Bing Maps app is available that will display road data from [[OpenStreetMap]].<ref>[http://www.bing.com/toolbox/blogs/maps/archive/2010/08/02/bing-maps-adds-open-street-maps-layer.aspx Bing.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021120249/http://www.bing.com/toolbox/blogs/maps/archive/2010/08/02/bing-maps-adds-open-street-maps-layer.aspx |date=2010-10-21 }}</ref>\n\n====Aerial view====\n:Aerial view overlays satellite imagery onto the map and highlights roads and major landmarks for easy identification amongst the satellite images. Since end of November 2010, [[OpenStreetMap]] mappers have been able to use imagery of Bing Aerial as a map background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opengeodata.org/microsoft-imagery-details|title=Microsoft Imagery details - OpenStreetMap Blog|website=opengeodata.org|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526081340/http://opengeodata.org/microsoft-imagery-details|archivedate=26 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n:At the end of January 2012, both Bing Aerial and Birds Eye View imagery at military bases in Germany became blurred.

Unlike the top-down aerial view captured by satellite, Bird's-eye images are taken at an oblique 45-degree angle, showing the sides and roofs of buildings giving better [[depth perception]] for geography. With Bird's Eye views, many details such as signs, advertisements and pedestrians are clearly visible. Microsoft has occasionally removed Bird's Eye view from areas where it was previously available.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n====Streetside ====\n[[File:Bing Maps Streetside.png|thumb|right|Bing Maps showing Streetside's view near the [[Palace of Westminster]]]]\n[[File:Bing Maps Streetside Car.jpg|thumb|upright|Bing Maps Streetside car with cameras on the roof]]\n:Streetside provides 360-degree imagery of street-level scenes taken from special cameras mounted on moving vehicles.

Since 2014, new 3D imagery has been introduced to a number of new cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/bing-maps-shows-super-bowl-spirit-new-venue-map-streetside-hi-res-venue-imagery-213827|title=Bing Maps Shows Super Bowl Spirit With New Venue Map, Streetside & Hi-Res Venue Imagery - Search Engine Land|date=28 January 2015|website=searchengineland.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128162450/https://searchengineland.com/bing-maps-shows-super-bowl-spirit-new-venue-map-streetside-hi-res-venue-imagery-213827|archivedate=28 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/08/20/microsoft-goes-after-google-with-bing-maps-update-94-new-cities-get-street-view-3d-maps/|title=Microsoft chases after Google in new, huge Bing Maps update|date=20 August 2014|website=venturebeat.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803102721/https://venturebeat.com/2014/08/20/microsoft-goes-after-google-with-bing-maps-update-94-new-cities-get-street-view-3d-maps/|archivedate=3 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Driving, walking, and transit directions===\nUsers can get directions between two or more locations. In September 2010, Bing Maps added public transit directions (bus, subway, and local rail) to its available direction options.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/community/blogs/maps/archive/2010/09/16/bing-maps-gets-transit-directions.aspx|title=Bing Maps Gets Transit Directions|website=www.bing.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007055156/http://www.bing.com/community/blogs/maps/archive/2010/09/16/bing-maps-gets-transit-directions.aspx|archivedate=7 October 2010}}</ref> Currently transit directions are only available in 11 cities: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Newark Metro Area, New York Metro Area, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver BC, and Washington DC.\nIt is also available in other countries such as Spain, Germany, Italy, Austria, Brazil, Mexico and some others.\n\n===Map apps===\n{{Main|Windows Maps}}\nBing Map Apps is a collection of 1st and 3rd party applications that add additional functionality and content to Bing Maps. Examples of map apps include a parking finder, a taxi fare calculator, an app that maps out Facebook friends, and an app which lets users explore the day's newspaper front pages from around the world. These apps are only accessible through Bing Maps [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]]. A source code is available on [[Microsoft Developer Network]] to explain integration of Maps in Web Applications. A sample ongoing project on locating Blood Donors on Maps is available here.<ref>[http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ASPNET-MVC-4-with-Bing-Maps-947ae78c/ ASP.NET MVC 4 with Bing Maps in C# for Visual Studio 2010] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120319015221/http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ASPNET-MVC-4-with-Bing-Maps-947ae78c/ |date=2012-03-19 }}. Code.msdn.microsoft.com (2012-05-22). Retrieved on 2013-07-21.</ref>\n\n===Traffic information and ClearFlow===\nBing Maps shows users current traffic information for major highways and roads. The feature uses 4 color codes (black, red, yellow, green) to indicate traffic volume, from heaviest traffic to lightest traffic.\nMicrosoft announced in March 2008 that it will release its latest software technology called \"ClearFlow\".{{Update inline|inaccurate=y|date=May 2013}} It is a Web-based service for traffic-based driving directions available on Bing.com in 72 cities across the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/maps/|title=Maps|website=www.bing.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505025009/https://www.bing.com/maps|archivedate=5 May 2018}}</ref> The tool took five years for Microsoft's [[Artificial Intelligence]] team to develop. ClearFlow provides real-time traffic data to help drivers avoid traffic congestion. ClearFlow gives information for alternative routes and supplies traffic conditions on city streets adjacent to highways.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/10/technology/10maps.html|title=Microsoft Introduces Tool for Avoiding Traffic Jams|author=Markoff, John|publisher=New York Times|date=2008-04-10|accessdate=2008-04-10|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409084911/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/10/technology/10maps.html|archivedate=2009-04-09}}</ref> Clearflow anticipates traffic patterns, while taking into account sporting/arena events, time of day and weather conditions, and then reflects the back ups and their consequential spill over onto city streets. Often, ClearFlow found it may be faster to stay on the highway instead of seeking alternative side street routes, which involve traffic lights and congestion as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2008/04/10/microsoft-clearflow-maps/|title=Microsoft Implements 'Clearflow' Traffic Artificial Intelligence in Live Maps|author=Glazowski, Paul|publisher=Marshable Social Networking News|date=2008-04-10|accessdate=2008-04-10|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412045156/http://mashable.com/2008/04/10/microsoft-clearflow-maps/|archivedate=2008-04-12}}</ref>\n\n===Sharing and embedding maps===\nBing Maps allows users to share maps and embed maps into their websites. By clicking the e-mail icon in the bottom-left corner of Bing Maps, a window will open that displays a shareable URL so others can access the map currently being viewed. This window also provides HTML code to embed a small version of the map onto any web page.\n\n===Design===\nIn August 2010, Bing Maps launched an overhauled design for its default view. The new colors create a more visually appealing backdrop for information delivery that helps content \u2018pop\u2019 on the map.  The backdrop provides clear differentiation for pushpins, labels and red, yellow and green traffic overlays.  These design principles also works well in black and white and creates differentiation for those with the most common forms of color blindness.\nAlso, larger fonts correspond to larger roads to help customers more easily identify main roads in cities.  More readable labels eliminate the need for bolding and less-attractive glows. The inclusion of neighborhood labels allows users to quickly find or convey locations in a commonly used and highly relevant format.\n\n==Other features==\n\n===People, business, and location search===\nThe search box at the top of Bing Maps can be used to locate places, businesses and landmarks, and people. Search results appear both on a left-side rail and as pushpins on the map (linked together by numbers). Search results often include addresses, contact information, and reviews for businesses and landmarks. For relevant searches, the user will also see a description of the landmark or place (powered by Wikipedia) if a Wikipedia article exists.\nThe search process can also be guided using local directories for numerous categories (restaurants, hotels, tourist attractions, retail stores, etc.).\n\n===User contributions===\nBing Maps users can also view and add \"user contributed\" entries to the map. These [[User-generated content|user-contributions]] must be toggled on by users. Such items can include businesses, landmarks, buildings, and locations. Users can browse user-contributions by tags and subscribe to [[RSS feed]]s to receive updates of new user-contributions to a specific area.\n\n===Dynamic labels===\nIn August 2010, Bing Maps added dynamic labels to its Silverlight experience (bing.com/maps/explore). Turn on the dynamic labels beta from the map style selector on bing.com/maps/explore and the labels become clickable.  This allows users to quickly zoom down to a region or location anywhere on the map with just a few clicks. Zooming back out in a single click is also possible by using the \u2018breadcrumb\u2019 trail at the top left of the map.\n\n==AJAX and Silverlight versions==\nBing Maps has two separate versions for users: an [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]] version (located at Bing.com/Maps) and an opt-in [[Silverlight]] version (located at Bing.com/Maps/Explore\u2014not available anymore) that requires Microsoft Silverlight to be installed. The Silverlight version is positioned to offer richer, more dynamic features and a smoother experience. In November 2010, the AJAX and Silverlight versions were combined into a semi-hybrid site where Silverlight features such as Map Apps and Streetside could be enabled through the Bing.com/Maps site - these features still required Silverlight to be installed, but does not require use of a separate Bing Maps site.\n\nThe AJAX and Silverlight site share the following features: Road View, Aerial View, Bird's-Eye View, Sharing Maps, People/Business/Location Search, Building Footprints, Driving Directions, Walking Directions.\n\nSilverlight users exclusively can use Map Apps, StreetSide View, Photosynths, and Dynamic Labels.\n\n==Map apps==\n\n===Access===\nBing Map Apps are accessed either through the \"Map Apps\" button in the Bing Maps Explore Bar or through direct perma-links. The Map Apps button is only viewable if the user is in the Bing Maps Silverlight experience or in [[Windows 8]].\n\n===Bing map apps===\nThere are a number of map apps that are developed/published by Bing, as indicated by the publisher above the map app's name in the app gallery. The following are a list of 1st party apps:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[2010 Tour de France]]: Shows Tour de France segments and results\n| Bing Health Maps: Displays various health statistic heat maps for the US\n| Bing Maps World Tour \u2013 Explore new imagery for Bing Maps\n|-\n| Businesses by Category: Displays businesses by various categories (Shopping, Food, Travel, etc.)\n| Coin Search: A game to find hidden coins in StreetSide imagery\n| Current Traffic: [[Traffic congestion map|See traffic levels]] for major highways and roads\n|-\n| Distance Calculator: Calculate the distance between 2 points in Miles or Kilometers\n| Education Map: See local opportunities to volunteer and mentor kids\n| Food Cart Finder: Find the best food carts to eat at in Portland, OR\n|-\n| foursquare Everysquare: Integrates [[Foursquare City Guide|foursquare]] checkins and badges to Bing Maps\n| Haiti Earthquake: View before and after photos of Haiti\n| Home Turf Finder: Find places to watch the World Cup based on country\n|-\n| Hotel Finder: Find and learn about hotels\n| Local Events: Learn about local upcoming events\n| Local Lens: Keep up to date with hyperlocal information\n|-\n| StreetSide Photos: Explore cities and landmarks at the StreetSide level using geo-tagged Flickr images\n| Teach Here: Search for local teaching job opportunities\n| Twitter Maps: See real-time updates from geo-tagged tweets\n|-\n| What's Nearby: See what's in the neighborhood (restaurants, bars, movie theatres, shopping, etc.)\n| World Cup: Check the latest information on the World Cup\n| [[WorldWide Telescope]]: Explore the skies and universe\n|-\n| My Friends: Map out [[Facebook]] friends\n| OpenStreetMap: Change the base map to OpenStreetMap\n|\n|}\n\n===Third-party apps===\nBing Map Apps also allows third parties to create and submit map apps.

Through a special agreement with Microsoft, the Advanced Ortho Aerial Program will provide wall-to-wall 30&nbsp;cm aerial coverage of the contiguous United States and Western Europe that DigitalGlobe has the exclusive rights to distribute beyond Bing Maps. The program's first orthophoto mosaics are of Augusta, GA, San Diego, CA and Tampa, FL, and can be viewed on DigitalGlobe's website.\n\n===Americas===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Its original stand out feature was the aerial imagery.<ref>https://www.geek.com/news/msn-offers-msn-virtual-earth-558930/</ref> The original version lacked many of its distinguishing features, including birds' eye view and 3D maps, and the Collections functionality was limited to a single \"Scratchpad\" of points of interest.\n\nIn December 2005, Virtual Earth was replaced by '''Windows Live Local''', featuring improvements, technologies from [[Pictometry International]], and integrated with the Local Search index on [[Windows Live Search]].<ref>https://www.pcworld.com/article/123847/article.html</ref> On November 6, 2006, Microsoft added the ability to view the maps in [[3D model|3D]] using a [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] managed control and managed interfaces to [[Direct3D]]. Microsoft subsequently referred to this product officially as \"''Live Search Maps''\", integrating it as part of its Live Search services.\n\nOn June 3, 2009, Microsoft officially rebranded Live Search Maps as ''Bing Maps'', and the Virtual Earth platform as ''Bing Maps for Enterprise''.\n\nIn 2010, Microsoft added an [[OpenStreetMap]] layer to Bing Maps.<ref>https://blogs.bing.com/maps/2010/08/02/bing-maps-adds-openstreetmap</ref> From 2012, [[Nokia]] (formerly [[Navteq]]) powered many aspects of Bing Maps as an extension to its [[Windows Phone 7]] partnership with Microsoft, including mapping data, geocoding, traffic data and navigation.<ref>https://www.gottabemobile.com/nokia-to-power-bing-maps-as-result-of-windows-phone-7-deal/</ref><ref>https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/20/3098821/microsoft-nokia-maps-windows-phone-8</ref><ref>https://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2012/05/24/bing-maps-taps-nokia-to-power-its-traffic-feature-and-geocoding-information/</ref> As of 2018, [[Here (company)|Here]] (formerly Nokia) continues to provide street data for Bing Maps.<ref>https://blog.capterra.com/bing-maps-vs-google-maps/</ref>\n\n===Updates===\n* v1 (Beagle) (July 2005)\n* v2 (Calypso) (December 2005) - \"Bird's-eye imagery\" released\n* v2.5 (February 2006)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061017034033/http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%211415.entry v3 (Discovery)] (May 2006) - Real time traffic, collections, new [[API]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061017032552/http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%214097.entry v4 (Endeavour)] (September 2006) - People search, drawing on maps, new imagery\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061208095437/http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%217573.entry v5 (Spaceland)] (November 2006) - 3D viewer, building models in 15 cities\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080223100822/http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%217986.entry Data update] (December 2006) - New 3D models and high-resolution imagery for 6 new areas\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070630230746/http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%218017.entry Data update] (January 2007) - Over 100 European cities with bird's-eye coverage added\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080223101136/http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%218457.entry Data update] (29 March 2007) - 3.8TB of bird's-eye imagery, [[orthophoto]]s and 3D models of 5 British cities\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080223100254/http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%218495.entry v5.5 (Falcon)] (3 April 2007) VE 3D plugin for Firefox, [[GeoRSS]] support, area calculations\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080223100836/http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%219276.entry v6 (Gemini)] (15 October 2007) - New data, party maps, traffic based routing, v6 MapControl, Bird's Eye in 3D, etc.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080512082323/http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%2114129.entry v6.1 (GoliatH)] (10 April 2008) - Improved quality of 3D models, improved KML support and new export capabilities, street labels on Bird's Eye imagery, MapCruncher integration, [[High-definition video|HD]] filming capabilities, Clearflow traffic report system\n* [http://blogs.msdn.com/virtualearth/archive/2008/09/24/new-feature-release-of-live-search-maps.aspx v6.2 (Helios)] (24 September 2008) - Multi-point driving directions, landmarks in directions, weather, real stars, new data\n* [http://blogs.msdn.com/virtualearth/archive/2008/12/29/virtual-earth-data-release-december-2008.aspx Data Update] (29 December 2008) - 48TB of road network data\n* [http://blogs.msdn.com/virtualearth/archive/2009/04/09/virtual-earth-api-release-information-april-2009.aspx v6.2 (Ikonos)] (14 April 2009) - Performance improvements\n* Bing (3 June 2009)\n* [http://www.bing.com/community/blogs/maps/archive/2009/12/02/bing-maps-adds-streetside-enhanced-bird-s-eye-photosynth-and-more.aspx?WT.mc_ID=Twitter Bing Maps Silverlight Beta] (2 December 2009) - Silverlight, Twitter, Streetside\n* (Oslo) (11 June 2010) - Silverlight improvements\n* (Boston M4) (December 2010) - [http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/maps/archive/2010/12/15/announcing-v1-1-of-the-new-map-style.aspx New map style] [https://web.archive.org/web/20110131164345/http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/maps/archive/2010/12/07/bing-s-new-mall-maps-get-in-get-out-and-the-avoid-the-crowds.aspx Venue maps]\n\n===Imagery updates===\nBing maps frequently update and expand the geographic areas covered by their imagery, with new updates being released on roughly a monthly basis. Each imagery release typically contains more than 10TB of imagery.\n\nHowever, the necessary time-lapse before images are updated means that aerial and Bird's-Eye images for a particular location can sometimes be several years out-of-date. This is particularly noticeable in locations that have undergone rapid recent development or experienced other dramatic changes since the imagery was taken, such as areas affected by natural disasters.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Street maps===\nUsers can browse and search topographically-shaded [[street map]]s for many cities worldwide. Maps include certain points of interest built in, such as metro stations, stadiums, hospitals, and other facilities. It is also possible to browse public user-created points of interest. Searches can cover public collections, businesses or types of business, locations, or people. Five street map views are available: Road View, Aerial View, Bird's Eye View, Street Side View, and 3D View.\n\n====Road view====\n:Road view is the default map view and displays vector imagery of roads, buildings, and geography. The data from which the default road map is rendered is licensed from [[Navteq]]. In certain parts of the world, road view maps from alternative data providers are also available. For example, when viewing a map of [[London]], the user may see road data from the [[Collins Bartholomew]] London Street Map. In all parts of the UK, road data from the [[Ordnance survey|Ordnance Survey]] can also be displayed. A Bing Maps app is available that will display road data from [[OpenStreetMap]].<ref>[http://www.bing.com/toolbox/blogs/maps/archive/2010/08/02/bing-maps-adds-open-street-maps-layer.aspx Bing.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021120249/http://www.bing.com/toolbox/blogs/maps/archive/2010/08/02/bing-maps-adds-open-street-maps-layer.aspx |date=2010-10-21 }}</ref>\n\n====Aerial view====\n:Aerial view overlays satellite imagery onto the map and highlights roads and major landmarks for easy identification amongst the satellite images. Since end of November 2010, [[OpenStreetMap]] mappers have been able to use imagery of Bing Aerial as a map background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opengeodata.org/microsoft-imagery-details|title=Microsoft Imagery details - OpenStreetMap Blog|website=opengeodata.org|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526081340/http://opengeodata.org/microsoft-imagery-details|archivedate=26 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n:At the end of January 2012, both Bing Aerial and Birds Eye View imagery at military bases in Germany became blurred.

Unlike the top-down aerial view captured by satellite, Bird's-eye images are taken at an oblique 45-degree angle, showing the sides and roofs of buildings giving better [[depth perception]] for geography. With Bird's Eye views, many details such as signs, advertisements and pedestrians are clearly visible.

To attempt to achieve near-photorealism, all 3D buildings are [[texture mapping|textured]] using composites of [[aerial photography]]. To view the 3D maps, users must install a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]], then enable the \"3D\" option on \"Bing Maps\". In addition to exploring the maps using a mouse and keyboard, it is possible to navigate the 3D environment using an [[Xbox 360 controller]] or another [[game controller]] in [[Windows 7]], [[Windows Vista]] or [[Windows XP]].\n\n:More than 60 cities worldwide could be viewed in 3D, including most of the major cities in the [[United States]] and a few cities in [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[France]].<ref>[http://maps.live.com/?v=2&cid=320432CACC287CB4!101&encType=1 List of 3D cities] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516170412/http://maps.live.com/?v=2&cid=320432CACC287CB4!101&encType=1 |date=2016-05-16 }}</ref> Some additional cities have had a select few important landmarks modelled in 3D, such as the [[Colosseum]] in [[Rome]].

In September 2010, Bing Maps added public transit directions (bus, subway, and local rail) to its available direction options.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/community/blogs/maps/archive/2010/09/16/bing-maps-gets-transit-directions.aspx|title=Bing Maps Gets Transit Directions|website=www.bing.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007055156/http://www.bing.com/community/blogs/maps/archive/2010/09/16/bing-maps-gets-transit-directions.aspx|archivedate=7 October 2010}}</ref> Currently transit directions are only available in 11 cities: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Newark Metro Area, New York Metro Area, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver BC, and Washington DC.\nIt is also available in other countries such as Spain, Germany, Italy, Austria, Brazil, Mexico and some others.\n\n===Map apps===\n{{Main|Windows Maps}}\nBing Map Apps is a collection of 1st and 3rd party applications that add additional functionality and content to Bing Maps. Examples of map apps include a parking finder, a taxi fare calculator, an app that maps out Facebook friends, and an app which lets users explore the day's newspaper front pages from around the world. These apps are only accessible through Bing Maps [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]]. A source code is available on [[Microsoft Developer Network]] to explain integration of Maps in Web Applications. A sample ongoing project on locating Blood Donors on Maps is available here.<ref>[http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ASPNET-MVC-4-with-Bing-Maps-947ae78c/ ASP.NET MVC 4 with Bing Maps in C# for Visual Studio 2010] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120319015221/http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ASPNET-MVC-4-with-Bing-Maps-947ae78c/ |date=2012-03-19 }}. Code.msdn.microsoft.com (2012-05-22). Retrieved on 2013-07-21.</ref>\n\n===Traffic information and ClearFlow===\nBing Maps shows users current traffic information for major highways and roads. The feature uses 4 color codes (black, red, yellow, green) to indicate traffic volume, from heaviest traffic to lightest traffic.\nMicrosoft announced in March 2008 that it will release its latest software technology called \"ClearFlow\".{{Update inline|inaccurate=y|date=May 2013}} It is a Web-based service for traffic-based driving directions available on Bing.com in 72 cities across the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/maps/|title=Maps|website=www.bing.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505025009/https://www.bing.com/maps|archivedate=5 May 2018}}</ref> The tool took five years for Microsoft's [[Artificial Intelligence]] team to develop. ClearFlow provides real-time traffic data to help drivers avoid traffic congestion. ClearFlow gives information for alternative routes and supplies traffic conditions on city streets adjacent to highways.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/10/technology/10maps.html|title=Microsoft Introduces Tool for Avoiding Traffic Jams|author=Markoff, John|publisher=New York Times|date=2008-04-10|accessdate=2008-04-10|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409084911/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/10/technology/10maps.html|archivedate=2009-04-09}}</ref> Clearflow anticipates traffic patterns, while taking into account sporting/arena events, time of day and weather conditions, and then reflects the back ups and their consequential spill over onto city streets. Often, ClearFlow found it may be faster to stay on the highway instead of seeking alternative side street routes, which involve traffic lights and congestion as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2008/04/10/microsoft-clearflow-maps/|title=Microsoft Implements 'Clearflow' Traffic Artificial Intelligence in Live Maps|author=Glazowski, Paul|publisher=Marshable Social Networking News|date=2008-04-10|accessdate=2008-04-10|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412045156/http://mashable.com/2008/04/10/microsoft-clearflow-maps/|archivedate=2008-04-12}}</ref>\n\n===Sharing and embedding maps===\nBing Maps allows users to share maps and embed maps into their websites. By clicking the e-mail icon in the bottom-left corner of Bing Maps, a window will open that displays a shareable URL so others can access the map currently being viewed. This window also provides HTML code to embed a small version of the map onto any web page.\n\n===Design===\nIn August 2010, Bing Maps launched an overhauled design for its default view. The new colors create a more visually appealing backdrop for information delivery that helps content \u2018pop\u2019 on the map.  The backdrop provides clear differentiation for pushpins, labels and red, yellow and green traffic overlays.  These design principles also works well in black and white and creates differentiation for those with the most common forms of color blindness.\nAlso, larger fonts correspond to larger roads to help customers more easily identify main roads in cities.  More readable labels eliminate the need for bolding and less-attractive glows. The inclusion of neighborhood labels allows users to quickly find or convey locations in a commonly used and highly relevant format.\n\n==Other features==\n\n===People, business, and location search===\nThe search box at the top of Bing Maps can be used to locate places, businesses and landmarks, and people. Search results appear both on a left-side rail and as pushpins on the map (linked together by numbers). Search results often include addresses, contact information, and reviews for businesses and landmarks. For relevant searches, the user will also see a description of the landmark or place (powered by Wikipedia) if a Wikipedia article exists.\nThe search process can also be guided using local directories for numerous categories (restaurants, hotels, tourist attractions, retail stores, etc.).\n\n===User contributions===\nBing Maps users can also view and add \"user contributed\" entries to the map. These [[User-generated content|user-contributions]] must be toggled on by users. Such items can include businesses, landmarks, buildings, and locations. Users can browse user-contributions by tags and subscribe to [[RSS feed]]s to receive updates of new user-contributions to a specific area.\n\n===Dynamic labels===\nIn August 2010, Bing Maps added dynamic labels to its Silverlight experience (bing.com/maps/explore). Turn on the dynamic labels beta from the map style selector on bing.com/maps/explore and the labels become clickable.  This allows users to quickly zoom down to a region or location anywhere on the map with just a few clicks. Zooming back out in a single click is also possible by using the \u2018breadcrumb\u2019 trail at the top left of the map.\n\n==AJAX and Silverlight versions==\nBing Maps has two separate versions for users: an [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]] version (located at Bing.com/Maps) and an opt-in [[Silverlight]] version (located at Bing.com/Maps/Explore\u2014not available anymore) that requires Microsoft Silverlight to be installed. The Silverlight version is positioned to offer richer, more dynamic features and a smoother experience. In November 2010, the AJAX and Silverlight versions were combined into a semi-hybrid site where Silverlight features such as Map Apps and Streetside could be enabled through the Bing.com/Maps site - these features still required Silverlight to be installed, but does not require use of a separate Bing Maps site.\n\nThe AJAX and Silverlight site share the following features: Road View, Aerial View, Bird's-Eye View, Sharing Maps, People/Business/Location Search, Building Footprints, Driving Directions, Walking Directions.\n\nSilverlight users exclusively can use Map Apps, StreetSide View, Photosynths, and Dynamic Labels.\n\n==Map apps==\n\n===Access===\nBing Map Apps are accessed either through the \"Map Apps\" button in the Bing Maps Explore Bar or through direct perma-links. The Map Apps button is only viewable if the user is in the Bing Maps Silverlight experience or in [[Windows 8]].\n\n===Bing map apps===\nThere are a number of map apps that are developed/published by Bing, as indicated by the publisher above the map app's name in the app gallery. The following are a list of 1st party apps:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[2010 Tour de France]]: Shows Tour de France segments and results\n| Bing Health Maps: Displays various health statistic heat maps for the US\n| Bing Maps World Tour \u2013 Explore new imagery for Bing Maps\n|-\n| Businesses by Category: Displays businesses by various categories (Shopping, Food, Travel, etc.)\n| Coin Search: A game to find hidden coins in StreetSide imagery\n| Current Traffic: [[Traffic congestion map|See traffic levels]] for major highways and roads\n|-\n| Distance Calculator: Calculate the distance between 2 points in Miles or Kilometers\n| Education Map: See local opportunities to volunteer and mentor kids\n| Food Cart Finder: Find the best food carts to eat at in Portland, OR\n|-\n| foursquare Everysquare: Integrates [[Foursquare City Guide|foursquare]] checkins and badges to Bing Maps\n| Haiti Earthquake: View before and after photos of Haiti\n| Home Turf Finder: Find places to watch the World Cup based on country\n|-\n| Hotel Finder: Find and learn about hotels\n| Local Events: Learn about local upcoming events\n| Local Lens: Keep up to date with hyperlocal information\n|-\n| StreetSide Photos: Explore cities and landmarks at the StreetSide level using geo-tagged Flickr images\n| Teach Here: Search for local teaching job opportunities\n| Twitter Maps: See real-time updates from geo-tagged tweets\n|-\n| What's Nearby: See what's in the neighborhood (restaurants, bars, movie theatres, shopping, etc.)\n| World Cup: Check the latest information on the World Cup\n| [[WorldWide Telescope]]: Explore the skies and universe\n|-\n| My Friends: Map out [[Facebook]] friends\n| OpenStreetMap: Change the base map to OpenStreetMap\n|\n|}\n\n===Third-party apps===\nBing Map Apps also allows third parties to create and submit map apps.

Through a special agreement with Microsoft, the Advanced Ortho Aerial Program will provide wall-to-wall 30&nbsp;cm aerial coverage of the contiguous United States and Western Europe that DigitalGlobe has the exclusive rights to distribute beyond Bing Maps. The program's first orthophoto mosaics are of Augusta, GA, San Diego, CA and Tampa, FL, and can be viewed on DigitalGlobe's website.\n\n===Americas===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
