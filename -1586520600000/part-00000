More than $345 million<ref name=\"Hospital appeal raises record $18 million - SBS News\">{{cite web|title=Hospital appeal raises record $18 million|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/hospital-appeal-raises-record-18-million}}</ref> has been raised for the hospital since the appeal began in 1931.\n\nIndividuals and businesses, clubs, schools and country towns throughout the state conduct activities to raise money for the hospital.\n\nThe appeal is a non-political, non-denominational organisation that exists solely to financially support The Royal Children's Hospital.\n\nFor the first time in 2014, the telethon was staged within the 2,500-seat Plenary theatre at the [[Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre]] (MCEC). The public were able to purchase tickets to join the live studio audience, with proceeds donated to the appeal. In 2016, the evening concert was marketed as a ticketed event via [[Ticketek]].\n\nThe state-of-the-art MCEC complex, which is entirely undercover, also features a vast foyer area and support rooms which allowed the appeal to expand activities such as the popular Kids Day Out program and host community groups which fundraise for the hospital.\n\n==History==\nThe Appeal started in 1931 when groups of journalists from [[The Herald and Weekly Times]] Ltd organised a sporting [[carnival]] in aid of Melbourne hospitals. The proceeds from the appeal initially went to different hospitals each year, but from their third-year proceeds have gone exclusively to the Melbourne Royal Children's Hospital. In 1942, Sir [[Keith Murdoch]] as managing director and editor of ''The Herald'' agreed that ''The Herald'' and radio station [[3DB (Melbourne)|3DB]] should broadcast an all-day appeal on [[Good Friday]]. In 1957, the [[HSV (TV station)|Seven Network]] joined the appeal and presented a three-hour [[telethon]] on Good Friday afternoon. In 1960, the telethon adopted the day-long format which continues annually to this day.\n\nDuring the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the telethon was also re-broadcast through regional Victoria via local channels, with [[Prime7|Prime Television]] being the sole regional broadcaster from 1992 with the aggregation of regional markets.\n\n==Funds raised==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:30%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

This room has many computer and data-processing resources to monitor, command and communicate with the station.  The ISS control room operates continuously. A second control room in the same building, which formerly hosted the Shuttle flight control team, can be set up for ISS operations should the need arise (e.g., during repairs or hardware upgrades in the main room), and also hosts training simulations.\n\nIn the event that the MCC-H is unavailable due to a hurricane or other unforeseen event, NASA has the option of quickly relocating to a temporary Backup Control Center (BCC) at a hotel in Round Rock, Texas, about 4 hours away,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grush |first1=Loren |title=How NASA kept the ISS flying while Harvey hit Mission Control |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/31/16228906/nasa-mission-control-center-tropical-storm-harvey-international-space-station |website=The Verge |accessdate=6 July 2019|date=2017-08-31 }}</ref> or a more robust but farther one at the Huntsville Operations Support Center (HOSC)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Marsh |first1=Angela L. |last2=Pirani |first2=Joseph L. |last3=Bornas |first3=Nicholas |title=Operating and Managing a Backup Control Center |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100020234.pdf |website=NASA Technical Reports Server |publisher=US Govt |accessdate=6 July 2019}}</ref> at [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] for ISS operations.

This facility was in the Engineering Support Building at the east end of Mission Control Road, about 0.5 mile (0.8&nbsp;km) east of Phillips Parkway. Mercury and Gemini launches were conducted from separate blockhouses at the Cape.\n\nThe building, which was on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], was demolished in May 2010 due to concerns about [[asbestos]] and the estimated $5&nbsp;million cost of repairs after 40 years of exposure to salt air. Formerly a stop on the [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]] tours, in the late 1990s, the control room consoles were removed, refurbished, and relocated to a re-creation of the room in the Debus Center at the KSC Visitor Complex.<ref>[http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-050410a.html Mercury Control building]</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Houston (1965\u2013present)==\n\n===Gemini and Apollo (1965-1975)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n{{Infobox NRHP\n  | name =Apollo Mission Control Center\n  | nrhp_type = nhl\n  | image =\n  | caption = Mission Control during a Shuttle flight\n  | location= [[Houston, Texas]]\n  | coordinates = {{coord|29|33|29|N|95|5|18|W|display=inline,title}}\n| locmapin = Texas#USA\n  | area =\n  | built = 1965\n  | architect= Charles Luckman\n  | architecture= International\n  | added = October 3, 1985\n  | governing_body = NASA\n  | refnum=85002815<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2008a}}</ref>\n}}\nLocated in Building 30 at the Johnson Space Center (known as the Manned Spacecraft Center until 1973), the Houston MCC was first used in June 1965 for [[Gemini 4]]. It housed two primary rooms known as Mission Operation Control Rooms (MOCR, pronounced \"moh-ker\").\nThese two rooms  controlled all [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], [[Project Apollo|Apollo]], [[Skylab]], and [[Space Shuttle]] flights up to 1998.  Each consisted of a four-tier auditorium, dominated by a large map screen, which, with the exception of Apollo lunar flights, had a [[Mercator projection]] of the Earth, with locations of  tracking stations, and a three-orbit \"[[sine wave]]\" track of the spacecraft in flight. Each MOCR tier was specialized, staffed by various controllers responsible for a specific spacecraft system.\n\nMOCR 1, housed on the second floor of Building 30, was used for [[Apollo 5]], [[Apollo 7]], the [[Skylab]] and the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] ([[Saturn IB]]) missions.\n\n====Mission Operations Control Room 2====\n[[File:Mission Operations Control Room at the conclusion of Apollo 11.jpg|thumb|left|MOCR 2 at the conclusion of [[Apollo 11]] in 1969]]\nMOCR 2 was used for all other Gemini and Apollo ([[Saturn V]]) flights (except Gemini 3) and was located on the third floor. As the flight control room for [[Apollo 11]], the first crewed Moon landing, MOCR 2 was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1985. It was last used in 1992 as the flight control room for [[STS-53]] and was subsequently converted back almost entirely to its [[Apollo program|Apollo]]-era configuration and preserved for historical purposes. Together with several support wings, it is now listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the \"Apollo Mission Control Center\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/nr//travel/aviation/apo.htm |title=Apollo Mission Control Center- Aviation: From Sand Dunes to Sonic Booms: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary |publisher=Nps.gov |accessdate=2008-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501221321/http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/aviation/apo.htm |archivedate=2008-05-01 }}</ref> In January 2018, the first set of consoles in MOCR 2 were removed and sent to the [[Kansas Cosmosphere]] for archival cleaning, refurbishment, and restoration to Apollo-era configuration, for eventual display back in the control room.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-012518a-apollo-mission-control-consoles-restoration.html |title=NASA sends historic Apollo mission control consoles to be restored |date=2018-01-25 |accessdate=2018-02-01 }}</ref> On July 1, 2019, the newly restored Apollo-era Mission Control was reopened to the public, after a two-year long effort to restore the room to its configuration as seen during the Apollo Moon landings.

FCR 2 was used mostly for classified [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] shuttle flights, then was remodeled to its Apollo-era configuration. From the moment a [[space shuttle]] cleared its launch tower in Florida until it landed on Earth, it was in the hands of Mission Control. When a shuttle mission was underway, its control room was staffed around the clock, usually in three shifts.\n\nIn 1992, JSC began building an extension to Building 30. The new five-story section (30 South) went operational in 1998 and houses two flight control rooms, designated ''White'', and ''Blue''. The White FCR was used in tandem with FCR 2 for seven shuttle missions, [[STS-70]] through [[STS-76]], and handled all following shuttle flights through the end of the program. When not in use for the shuttle program, the White FCR was reconfigured as a backup for the ISS FCR from time to time as needed (such as during periods of construction or upgrades in the ISS FCR).\n\n===International Space Station (1998\u2013present)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:International Space Station Flight Control Room.jpg|thumb|White Flight Control Room during ISS operations (2016)]]\nThe newer section of Building 30 also houses the International Space Station Flight Control Room. The first ISS control room, originally named the Special Vehicles Operations Room (SVO), then the Blue FCR, was operational around the clock to support the ISS until the fall of 2006.\n\nFCR 1, meanwhile, had its original consoles and tiered decking removed after [[STS-71]], and was first converted to a \"Life Sciences Center\" for ISS payload control operations. After substantial remodelling, mainly with new technologies not available in 1998, ISS flight control moved into the totally revamped FCR 1 in October 2006, due to the growth of the ISS and the international cooperation required among national control centers around the world.\n\n===Other facilities===\nOther MCC facilities include the Training Flight Control Room, sometimes referred to as the Red FCR, a training area for flight controllers; a Life Sciences Control Room used to oversee various experiments; the Simulation Control Area (SCA), primarily used during shuttle astronaut and flight control training; and an Exploration Planning Operations Center, used to test new concepts for operations beyond low-Earth orbit. Additionally, there are multi-purpose support rooms (MPSRs) which are staffed by backup flight controllers, who analyze data and run simulations as well as provide information and advice for the flight controllers.\n\nBuilding 30 was named for Kraft on April 14, 2011.<ref name=\"nasa.gov\"/>\n\n===MCC-21===\n[[File:MCC Blue Room.jpg|thumb|Blue Flight Control Room]]\nFrom 2012 to 2014, the rooms used during the Shuttle program underwent upgrades in preparation for future human space flight activities. The ISS FCR 1, the White FCR, the Blue FCR, the SCA, and the MPSRs all had their consoles removed and replaced with modern hardware, in part to support the new operational concept of commercial companies having a presence in Mission Control. This project is known as Mission Control Center for the 21st Century, or MCC-21.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/09/mission-control-update-floor-plan-post-shuttle-era/ |title=Mission Control looks to update floor plan in post-Shuttle era |publisher=nasaspaceflight.com |date= 2011-09-19|accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref> The White FCR was officially completed and unveiled in April 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/technology&id=9499399|title=NASA gives ABC-13 tour of new mission control |publisher=ABC News |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref> The modernized White FCR is used for flight controller training and occasionally for nominal ISS operations when FCR 1 is temporarily removed from service for repairs or upgrades.\n\n===Commercial Crew===\nIn 2019, the first of the [[Commercial Crew Development|Commercial Crew]] vehicles to be controlled from Houston was launched: the [[Boeing CST-100 Starliner]]. The [[SpaceX]] [[Dragon 2]] demo flight launched earlier in the year, but SpaceX Mission Control is at their headquarters in Hawthorne, CA. The Boeing Starliner missions use a number of control centers across the United States, several in Houston in the Mission Control building:\n* [[Atlas V]] launch vehicle operations are controlled from the [[United Launch Alliance]]'s Atlas Spaceflight Operations Center at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] with support from a team in the Vehicle Ascent and Launch Operations Room (VALOR) at the company's headquarters in Denver, Colorado.\n* The Boeing Mission Control Center (BMCC) is at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] looking after Starliner during ascent, orbit, and entry.\n* Mission Control Center for the CST-100 is known as MCC-CST and operates out of the White FCR and Ops Suite 1 just outside the room.\n* The [[Guidance, Navigation and Control]] (GNC) and flight software team reside in the Blue FCR down the hall from Mission Control Center-CST.<ref name=\"CST\">{{cite web |last1=Jordan |first1=Gary |title=How the Mission is Controlled: Inside NASA and Boeing Joint Operations |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/how-the-mission-is-controlled-inside-nasa-and-boeing-joint-operations |website=nasa.gov |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |accessdate=21 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Console positions ==\n\n===Mercury Control Center (1960\u20131963)===\nDuring the early years at Cape Canaveral, the original MCC consisted only of three rows, as the Mercury capsule was simple in design and construction, with missions lasting no more than 35 hours.[[Image:Chris Kraft and Walt Williams.jpg|thumb|right|Walt Williams (standing) and Chris Kraft in Mercury Control during [[Mercury-Atlas 9|MA-9]] in 1963]]\n\nThe first row consisted of several controllers, the [[Booster Systems Engineer]] (BOOSTER), [[Flight controller#Flight Surgeon (SURGEON)|Flight Surgeon]] (SURGEON), [[capsule communicator]] (CAPCOM), [[Flight controller#Retrofire Officer (RETRO)|Retrofire Officer]] (RETRO), [[Flight Dynamics Officer]] (FIDO), and [[Flight controller#Guidance Officer (GUIDANCE)|Guidance Officer]] (GUIDO).\n\nThe BOOSTER controller, depending upon the type of rocket being used, was either an engineer from the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (for Mercury-Redstone flights) or an Air Force engineer (for Mercury-Atlas and later Gemini-Titan flights) assigned for that mission.  The BOOSTER controller's job would last no more than six hours total and he would vacate his console after the booster was jettisoned.\n\nThe SURGEON controller, consisting of a flight surgeon (either a military or civilian physician), monitored the astronaut's vital signs during the flight, and if a medical need arose, could recommend treatment.  They could also talk directly to the astronaut crew if there was a medical need that the astronauts needed to discuss.\n\nThe CAPCOM controller, filled by an astronaut, maintained nominal air-to-ground communications between the MCC and the orbiting spacecraft; the exception being the SURGEON or Flight Director, and only in an emergency.\n\nThe RETRO, FIDO, and GUIDO controllers monitored spacecraft trajectory and handled course changes.\n\nThe second row also consisted of several controllers, the ENVIRONMENTAL, [[Flight controller#Procedures Controller (PROCEDURES)|PROCEDURES]], [[Flight Director|FLIGHT]], SYSTEMS, and NETWORK.  The ENVIRONMENTAL controller, later called EECOM, oversaw the consumption of spacecraft oxygen and monitored pressurization, while the SYSTEMS controller, later called EGIL, monitored all other spacecraft systems, including electrical consumption.  The PROCEDURES controller, first held by [[Gene Kranz]], handled the writing of all mission milestones, \"GO/NO GO\" decisions, and synchronized the MCC with the launch countdowns and the [[Eastern Test Range]].  The PROCEDURES controller also handled communications, via [[Teleprinter|teletype]], between the MCC and the worldwide network of tracking stations and ships.\n\nThe flight director, known as FLIGHT, was ultimate supervisor of the Mission Control Center, and gave the final orbit entrance/exit, and, in emergencies, mission abort decisions.  During Mercury missions, this position was held by [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr.|Christopher Kraft]], with [[John Hodge (engineer)|John Hodge]], an Englishman who came to NASA after the cancellation of the Canadian [[Avro Arrow]] project, joining the flight director ranks for the 22-orbit [[Mercury 9]], requiring Kraft to divide Mission Control into two shifts.  The flight director's console was also the only position in the Cape MCC to have a television monitor, allowing him to see the rocket lift off from the pad.  The NETWORK controller, an Air Force officer, served as the \"switchboard\" between the MCC, the Goddard Space Flight Center in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]] (as on-site real-time computing did not exist), and the worldwide tracking station and ship network.\n\nThe back row, consisting primarily of NASA and Department of Defense (DOD) management, was the location of the operations director (held by Walt Williams), a general or flag officer who could coordinate with the DOD on all search-and-rescue missions, and the [[Flight controller#Public Affairs Officer (PAO)|PAO]] ([[John A. Powers|\"Shorty\" Powers]] during Mercury), who provided minute-by-minute mission commentary for the news media and public.\n\nIn addition to the controllers in the Cape MCC, each of the crewed tracking stations and the ''Rose Knot Victor'' and ''Coastal Sentry Quebec'' tracking ships, had three controllers, a CAPCOM, SURGEON, and an engineer.  Unlike the Cape CAPCOM, which was always staffed by an astronaut, the tracking station/tracking ship CAPCOMs were either a NASA engineer, or an astronaut, with the latter located at stations deemed \"critical\" by the flight director and operations director.\n\n===MOCR (1965\u20131998)===\n[[File:Gemini Mission Control - GPN-2000-001405.jpg|thumb|left|MOCR 2 during [[Gemini 5]] in 1965]]\n\nAfter the move from the Cape MCC to the Houston MCC in 1965, the new MOCRs, which were larger and more sophisticated than the single Cape MCC, consisted of four rows, with the first row, later known as \"the Trench\" (a term coined by Apollo-era RETRO controller John Llewellyn, which, according to Flight Director [[Eugene Kranz]], reminded him of the firing range during his years as a USAF officer). It was occupied by the BOOSTER, RETRO, FIDO, and GUIDO controllers. During Gemini, the BOOSTER position was handled by both an engineer from [[Lockheed Martin|Martin Marietta]] and an astronaut, while all missions from [[Apollo 7]] used engineers from the Marshall Space Flight Center.\n\nThe second row, after [[Project Gemini]], consisted of the SURGEON, [[EECOM]], and CAPCOM.  The EECOM, which replaced the ENVIRONMENTAL controller and some of the SYSTEMS controller's functions, monitored the spacecraft's electrical and environmental systems.  Like the CAPCOMs during Mercury, all CAPCOMs in the Houston MCC were astronauts. [[File:Apollo 13 Mailbox at Mission Control.jpg|thumb|right|MOCR 2 during the [[Apollo 13]] crisis]]\n\nOn the other side of the aisle of the second row were controllers who monitored specific parts of Gemini, Apollo,  [[Skylab]], ASTP and [[Space Shuttle]] missions. During the Gemini program, the two [[Agena (rocket)|Agena]] controllers monitored the Agena upper stage used as a docking target from [[Gemini 8]] through [[Gemini 12]].  For the Apollo lunar flights, the [[Flight controller#Telemetry, Electrical, EVA Mobility Unit Officer (TELMU)|TELMU]] and CONTROL controllers monitored the Lunar Module.  During Skylab, the [[Flight controller#Electrical Generation and Integrated Lighting Systems Engineer (EGIL)|EGIL]] (pronounced \"eagle\") monitored Skylab's solar panels, while the EXPERIMENTS controller monitored experiments and the telescopes in the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]].  The PAYLOAD and EXPERIMENTS controllers monitored Space Shuttle operations.  Another controller, the [[Instrumentation and Communications Officer|INCO]], monitored the spacecraft's communications and instrumentation.\n\nThe third row consisted of the PAO, PROCEDURES, and the [[Flight controller#Flight Activities Officer (FAO)|FAO]] (flight activities officer), who coordinated with the flight schedule.  The AFD (assistant flight director) and the flight director were also located on the third row.\n\nThe fourth row, like the old Cape MCC's third row, was reserved for NASA management, including the director of the Johnson Space Center, the director of flight operations, the director of flight crew operations (chief astronaut), and the Department of Defense officer.\n\n===Blue FCR (1998\u20132006)===\nThe Blue FCR, used primarily for ISS operations from 1998 to 2006, was arranged in five rows of three consoles, plus one in the rear right corner. From left to right, as viewed from the rear of the room, the front row consisted of [[Flight controller#Attitude Determination and Control Officer (ADCO)|ADCO]], [[Flight controller#Thermal Operations and Resources Office (THOR)|THOR]], and [[Flight controller#Power, Heating, Articulation, Lighting Control Officer (PHALCON)|PHALCON]].\n\nThe second row consisted of [[Flight controller#Operations Support Officer (OSO)|OSO]], [[Flight controller#Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS)|ECLSS]] pronounced \"eekliss\", and [[Flight controller#Robotics Operations Systems Officer (ROBO)|ROBO]].\n\nThe third row consisted of [[Flight controller#Onboard Data Interfaces and Networks (ODIN)|ODIN]], depending on phase of flight, either [[Flight controller#Assembly and Checkout Officer (ACO)|ACO]] (shuttle docked) or the [[Flight controller#Cargo Integration Officer (CIO)|CIO]] (Free-flight Operations) and [[Flight controller#Operations Planner (OpsPlan)|OpsPlan]].\n\nThe fourth row consisted of [[Flight controller#Communication and Tracking Officer (CATO)|CATO]], [[Flight Director|FLIGHT\u2014the flight director]], and [[Flight controller#Capsule Communicator .28CAPCOM.29|CAPCOM]].\n\nThe fifth last row consisted of [[Ground Controller|GC]], depending on the phase of flight; either [[Flight controller#Russian Interface Officer (RIO)|RIO]], [[Flight controller#Extravehicular Activity Officer (EVA)|EVA]], [[Flight controller#Visiting Vehicles Officer (VVO)|VVO]], or [[Flight controller#Flight Dynamics Officer (FDO)|FDO]] (reboosts only), and [[Flight controller#Flight Surgeon (SURGEON)|SURGEON]].\n\nIn the back, right corner, behind the surgeon, the [[Flight controller#Public Affairs Officer (PAO)|PAO (Public Affairs Officer)]] was occasionally present.\n\n===White FCR (1998\u20132011)===\n[[Image:STS-115 Shuttle (White) Flight Control Room.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The White FCR during [[STS-115]] in 2006]]\n\nThe White FCR, which was used for Space Shuttle operations, was arranged in five rows. From left to right, as viewed from the rear of the room):\n\nThe front row (the \"trench\") had [[Flight controller#Flight Dynamics Officer (FDO)|FDO]] (pronounced \"fido\"), responsible for orbital guidance and orbital changes, depending on the phase of flight; either [[Flight controller#Ascent/Entry Guidance and Procedures Office(Ascent/Entry)|Guidance]], a specialist in the procedures of those two high-energy, fast-paced phases of flight or [[Flight controller#Rendezvous Guidance and Procedures Officer (GPO)|rendezvous]], a specialist in orbital rendezvous procedures; and [[Ground Controller|GC]], the controller responsible for the computers and systems in MCC itself.\n\nThe second row had [[Flight controller#Propulsion Officer (Prop)|PROP]], responsible for the propulsion system; [[Flight controller#Guidance Navigation and Control Officer (GNC)|GNC]], responsible for systems that determine the spacecraft's attitude and issue commands to control it; [[Flight controller#Maintenance, Mechanical, Arm, and Crew Systems (MMACS)|MMACS]] (pronounced \"max\"), responsible for the mechanical systems on the space craft, such as the payload bay doors and landing gear; and [[Flight controller#Electrical Generation and Integrated Lighting Systems Engineer (EGIL)|EGIL]] (pronounced \"eagle\"), responsible for the fuel cells, electrical distribution and O<sub>2</sub> & H<sub>2</sub> supplies.\n\nThe third row had [[Data Processing Systems Engineer|DPS]], responsible for the computer systems; [[Flight controller#Assembly and Checkout Officer (ACO)|ACO]] or Payloads, responsible for all payload-related activities (depending on whether the shuttle flight supported an ISS assembly flight or not; [[Flight controller#Flight Activities Officer (FAO)|FAO]], responsible for the overall plans of activities for the entire flight; and [[EECOM]] responsible for the management of environmental systems.\n\nThe fourth row had [[Instrumentation and Communications Officer|INCO]], responsible for communications systems for uploading all systems commands to the vehicle; [[Flight Director|FLIGHT\u2014the Flight Director]], the person in charge of the flight; [[Capsule communicator|CAPCOM]], an astronaut who is normally the only controller to talk to the astronauts on board; and [[Flight controller#Payload Deployment and Retrieval System (PRDS)|PDRS]], responsible for robot arm operations.\n\nThe back row had [[Flight controller#Public Affairs Officer (PAO)|PAO (Public Affairs Officer)]], the \"voice\" of MCC; [[Flight controller#Mission Operations Directorate (MOD)|MOD]], a management representative, depending on the phase of flight; either [[Flight controller#Russian Interface Officer (RIO)|RIO for MIR flights]], a Russian-speaker who spoke with the Russian MCC, known as \u0426\u0443\u043f, (Tsup); [[Booster Systems Engineer|BOOSTER]] responsible for the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|SRBs]] and the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|SSMEs]] during ascent, or [[Flight controller#Extravehicular Activity Officer (EVA)|EVA]] responsible for space suit systems and EVA tasks; and finally, [[Flight controller#Flight Surgeon (SURGEON)|SURGEON]].\n\n===FCR 1 (2006\u2013present)===\n[[Image:STS-128 MCC space station flight control room.jpg|thumb|right|250px|FCR 1 in 2009 during the [[STS-128]] mission.]]\n\nAll US International Space Station operations are currently controlled from FCR 1, remodeled in 2006. This FCR abandoned the traditional tiered floor layout, with all rows instead at the same level.  A few engineering specialists are in the center of the front row, with the public affairs commentator at the right end behind a low partition. The space station trajectory position was moved to the third row.\n\nDuring early ISS operations, a scheme known as Gemini was used, which reduced staffing for real-time ISS support by consolidating six system disciplines into two positions. From these two \"super-consoles\", named Atlas and Titan, two people can do the work of up to eight other flight controllers during low-activity periods.<ref name=\"Oberg 2006\">Oberg, James \"NASA's Newest Flight Control Room\" (October 22, 2006) spaceflight.com</ref> One position, call sign TITAN (Telemetry, Information Transfer, and Attitude Navigation), was responsible for Communication & Tracking (CATO), Command & Data Handling (ODIN), and Motion Control Systems (ADCO). The other position, call sign ATLAS (Atmosphere, Thermal, Lighting and Articulation Specialist), was responsible for Thermal Control (THOR), Environmental Control & Life Support (ECLSS), and Electrical Power Systems (PHALCON).  ATLAS was also responsible for monitoring Robotics (ROBO) and Mechanical Systems (OSO) heaters, as those consoles were not supported during the majority of Gemini shifts.<ref name=\"Oberg 2006\"/> While Gemini officially reflected the fact that two controllers act as \"twins\" during operations, the name was also an homage to the first missions (Project Gemini) controlled from that room. In addition, Titan was the type of booster rocket which launched the Gemini spacecraft and Atlas boosters launched Gemini-era Agena target vehicles (and several missions in Project Mercury).\n\nIn 2010 after ISS assembly complete, the Gemini concept was removed and the six core disciplines were reduced to four. Those console positions are ETHOS (Environmental and Thermal Operating Systems) which consists of the ECLSS system as well as the internal thermal control system formerly held by THOR; SPARTAN (Station Power, ARticulation, Thermal, and ANalysis) which consists of the electrical power and external thermal control systems; CRONUS (Communications RF Onboard Networks Utilization Specialist), a combination of the previous ODIN and CATO positions; and ADCO (Motion Control Systems).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Launch Control Center]] in Florida\n* [[Launch status check]]\n* [[Mission control center]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/160406main_mission_control_fact_sheet.pdf NASA Mission Control Fact Sheet]\n* [http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts-jsc.html Space Shuttle News Reference]\n* [http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2006/10/nasas-newest-flight-control-room/ 2006 ISS Flight Control Room]\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Mission Control Center Houston}}\n* [http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/mcc/index.html NASA's MCC page]\n* [http://gis.larc.nasa.gov/historic/Mission_Control_Center MCC history]\n* [http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/101space/101visual2.htm National Park Service Mission Control page]\n* [https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/10/going-boldly-what-it-was-like-to-be-an-apollo-flight-controller/ Detailed behind-the-scenes tour of MOCR 2], by Sy Liebergot.\n* [http://www.balettie.com/mcc/ Mission Control Center Overview]\n\n{{NASA navbox}}\n{{NASA centers}}\n{{National Register of Historic Places}}\n{{Spaceflight landmarks}}\n\n{{Use American English|date=January 2014}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kraft, Christopher C.

This room has many computer and data-processing resources to monitor, command and communicate with the station.  The ISS control room operates continuously. A second control room in the same building, which formerly hosted the Shuttle flight control team, can be set up for ISS operations should the need arise (e.g., during repairs or hardware upgrades in the main room), and also hosts training simulations.\n\nIn the event that the MCC-H is unavailable due to a hurricane or other unforeseen event, NASA has the option of quickly relocating to a temporary Backup Control Center (BCC) at a hotel in Round Rock, Texas, about 4 hours away<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grush |first1=Loren |title=How NASA kept the ISS flying while Harvey hit Mission Control |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/31/16228906/nasa-mission-control-center-tropical-storm-harvey-international-space-station |website=The Verge |accessdate=6 July 2019|date=2017-08-31 }}</ref>, or a more robust but farther one at the Huntsville Operations Support Center (HOSC)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Marsh |first1=Angela L. |last2=Pirani |first2=Joseph L. |last3=Bornas |first3=Nicholas |title=Operating and Managing a Backup Control Center |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100020234.pdf |website=NASA Technical Reports Server |publisher=US Govt |accessdate=6 July 2019}}</ref> at [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] for ISS operations.

This facility was in the Engineering Support Building at the east end of Mission Control Road, about 0.5 mile (0.8&nbsp;km) east of Phillips Parkway. Mercury and Gemini launches were conducted from separate blockhouses at the Cape.\n\nThe building, which was on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], was demolished in May 2010 due to concerns about [[asbestos]] and the estimated $5 million cost of repairs after 40 years of exposure to salt air. Formerly a stop on the [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]] tours, in the late 1990s, the control room consoles were removed, refurbished, and relocated to a re-creation of the room in the Debus Center at the KSC Visitor Complex.<ref>[http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-050410a.html Mercury Control building]</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Houston (1965\u2013present)==\n\n===Gemini and Apollo (1965-1975)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n{{Infobox NRHP\n  | name =Apollo Mission Control Center\n  | nrhp_type = nhl\n  | image =\n  | caption = Mission Control during a Shuttle flight\n  | location= [[Houston, Texas]]\n  | coordinates = {{coord|29|33|29|N|95|5|18|W|display=inline,title}}\n| locmapin = Texas#USA\n  | area =\n  | built = 1965\n  | architect= Charles Luckman\n  | architecture= International\n  | added = October 3, 1985\n  | governing_body = NASA\n  | refnum=85002815<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2008a}}</ref>\n}}\nLocated in Building 30 at the Johnson Space Center (known as the Manned Spacecraft Center until 1973), the Houston MCC was first used in June 1965 for [[Gemini 4]]. It housed two primary rooms known as Mission Operation Control Rooms (MOCR, pronounced \"moh-ker\").\nThese two rooms  controlled all [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], [[Project Apollo|Apollo]], [[Skylab]], and [[Space Shuttle]] flights up to 1998.  Each consisted of a four-tier auditorium, dominated by a large map screen, which, with the exception of Apollo lunar flights, had a [[Mercator projection]] of the Earth, with locations of  tracking stations, and a three-orbit \"[[sine wave]]\" track of the spacecraft in flight. Each MOCR tier was specialized, staffed by various controllers responsible for a specific spacecraft system.\n\nMOCR 1, housed on the second floor of Building 30, was used for [[Apollo 5]], [[Apollo 7]], the [[Skylab]] and the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] ([[Saturn IB]]) missions. \n\n====Mission Operations Control Room 2====\n[[File:Mission Operations Control Room at the conclusion of Apollo 11.jpg|thumb|left|MOCR 2 at the conclusion of [[Apollo 11]] in 1969]]\nMOCR 2 was used for all other Gemini and Apollo ([[Saturn V]]) flights (except Gemini 3) and was located on the third floor. As the flight control room for [[Apollo 11]], the first crewed Moon landing, MOCR 2 was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1985. It was last used in 1992 as the flight control room for [[STS-53]] and was subsequently converted back almost entirely to its [[Apollo program|Apollo]]-era configuration and preserved for historical purposes. Together with several support wings, it is now listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the \"Apollo Mission Control Center\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/nr//travel/aviation/apo.htm |title=Apollo Mission Control Center- Aviation: From Sand Dunes to Sonic Booms: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary |publisher=Nps.gov |accessdate=2008-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501221321/http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/aviation/apo.htm |archivedate=2008-05-01 }}</ref> In January 2018, the first set of consoles in MOCR 2 were removed and sent to the [[Kansas Cosmosphere]] for archival cleaning, refurbishment, and restoration to Apollo-era configuration, for eventual display back in the control room.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-012518a-apollo-mission-control-consoles-restoration.html |title=NASA sends historic Apollo mission control consoles to be restored |date=2018-01-25 |accessdate=2018-02-01 }}</ref> On July 1, 2019, the newly restored Apollo-era Mission Control was reopened to the public, after a two-year long effort to restore the room to its configuration as seen during the Apollo Moon landings.

FCR 2 was used mostly for classified [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] shuttle flights, then was remodeled to its Apollo-era configuration. From the moment a [[space shuttle]] cleared its launch tower in Florida until it landed on Earth, it was in the hands of Mission Control. When a shuttle mission was underway, its control room was staffed around the clock, usually in three shifts.\n\nIn 1992, JSC began building an extension to Building 30. The new five-story section (30 South) went operational in 1998 and houses two flight control rooms, designated ''White'', and ''Blue''. The White FCR was used in tandem with FCR 2 for seven shuttle missions, [[STS-70]] through [[STS-76]], and handled all following shuttle flights through the end of the program. When not in use for the shuttle program, the White FCR was reconfigured as a backup for the ISS FCR from time to time as needed (such as during periods of construction or upgrades in the ISS FCR).\n\n===International Space Station (1998\u2013present)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:International Space Station Flight Control Room.jpg|thumb|White Flight Control Room during ISS operations (2016) ]]\nThe newer section of Building 30 also houses the International Space Station Flight Control Room. The first ISS control room, originally named the Special Vehicles Operations Room (SVO), then the Blue FCR, was operational around the clock to support the ISS until the fall of 2006.\n\nFCR 1, meanwhile, had its original consoles and tiered decking removed after [[STS-71]], and was first converted to a \"Life Sciences Center\" for ISS payload control operations. After substantial remodelling, mainly with new technologies not available in 1998, ISS flight control moved into the totally revamped FCR 1 in October 2006, due to the growth of the ISS and the international cooperation required among national control centers around the world.\n\n===Other facilities===\nOther MCC facilities include the Training Flight Control Room, sometimes referred to as the Red FCR, a training area for flight controllers; a Life Sciences Control Room used to oversee various experiments; the Simulation Control Area (SCA), primarily used during shuttle astronaut and flight control training; and an Exploration Planning Operations Center, used to test new concepts for operations beyond low-Earth orbit. Additionally, there are multi-purpose support rooms (MPSRs) which are staffed by backup flight controllers, who analyze data and run simulations as well as provide information and advice for the flight controllers.\n\nBuilding 30 was named for Kraft on April 14, 2011.<ref name=\"nasa.gov\"/>\n\n===MCC-21===\n[[File:MCC Blue Room.jpg|thumb|Blue Flight Control Room]]\nFrom 2012 to 2014, the rooms used during the Shuttle program underwent upgrades in preparation for future human space flight activities. The ISS FCR 1, the White FCR, the Blue FCR, the SCA, and the MPSRs all had their consoles removed and replaced with modern hardware, in part to support the new operational concept of commercial companies having a presence in Mission Control.

The BOOSTER controller's job would last no more than six hours total and he would vacate his console after the booster was jettisoned.\n\nThe SURGEON controller, consisting of a flight surgeon (either a military or civilian physician), monitored the astronaut's vital signs during the flight, and if a medical need arose, could recommend treatment.  They could also talk directly to the astronaut crew if there was a medical need that the astronauts needed to discuss.\n\nThe CAPCOM controller, filled by an astronaut, maintained nominal air-to-ground communications between the MCC and the orbiting spacecraft; the exception being the SURGEON or Flight Director, and only in an emergency.\n\nThe RETRO, FIDO, and GUIDO controllers monitored spacecraft trajectory and handled course changes.\n\nThe second row also consisted of several controllers, the ENVIRONMENTAL, [[Flight controller#Procedures Controller (PROCEDURES)|PROCEDURES]], [[Flight Director|FLIGHT]], SYSTEMS, and NETWORK.  The ENVIRONMENTAL controller, later called EECOM, oversaw the consumption of spacecraft oxygen and monitored pressurization, while the SYSTEMS controller, later called EGIL, monitored all other spacecraft systems, including electrical consumption.  The PROCEDURES controller, first held by [[Gene Kranz]], handled the writing of all mission milestones, \"GO/NO GO\" decisions, and synchronized the MCC with the launch countdowns and the [[Eastern Test Range]].  The PROCEDURES controller also handled communications, via [[Teleprinter|teletype]], between the MCC and the worldwide network of tracking stations and ships.\n\nThe flight director, known as FLIGHT, was ultimate supervisor of the Mission Control Center, and gave the final orbit entrance/exit, and, in emergencies, mission abort decisions.  During Mercury missions, this position was held by [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr.|Christopher Kraft]], with [[John Hodge (engineer)|John Hodge]], an Englishman who came to NASA after the cancellation of the Canadian [[Avro Arrow]] project, joining the flight director ranks for the 22-orbit [[Mercury 9]], requiring Kraft to divide Mission Control into two shifts.  The flight director's console was also the only position in the Cape MCC to have a television monitor, allowing him to see the rocket lift off from the pad.  The NETWORK controller, an Air Force officer, served as the \"switchboard\" between the MCC, the Goddard Space Flight Center in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]] (as on-site real-time computing did not exist), and the worldwide tracking station and ship network.\n\nThe back row, consisting primarily of NASA and Department of Defense (DOD) management, was the location of the operations director (held by Walt Williams), a general or flag officer who could coordinate with the DOD on all search-and-rescue missions, and the [[Flight controller#Public Affairs Officer (PAO)|PAO]] ([[John A. Powers|\"Shorty\" Powers]] during Mercury), who provided minute-by-minute mission commentary for the news media and public.\n\nIn addition to the controllers in the Cape MCC, each of the crewed tracking stations and the ''Rose Knot Victor'' and ''Coastal Sentry Quebec'' tracking ships, had three controllers, a CAPCOM, SURGEON, and an engineer.  Unlike the Cape CAPCOM, which was always staffed by an astronaut, the tracking station/tracking ship CAPCOMs were either a NASA engineer, or an astronaut, with the latter located at stations deemed \"critical\" by the flight director and operations director.\n\n===MOCR (1965\u20131998)===\n[[File:Gemini Mission Control - GPN-2000-001405.jpg|thumb|left|MOCR 2 during [[Gemini 5]] in 1965]]\n\nAfter the move from the Cape MCC to the Houston MCC in 1965, the new MOCRs, which were larger and more sophisticated than the single Cape MCC, consisted of four rows, with the first row, later known as \"the Trench\" (a term coined by Apollo-era RETRO controller John Llewellyn, which, according to Flight Director [[Eugene Kranz]], reminded him of the firing range during his years as a USAF officer). It was occupied by the BOOSTER, RETRO, FIDO, and GUIDO controllers. During Gemini, the BOOSTER position was handled by both an engineer from [[Lockheed Martin|Martin Marietta]] and an astronaut, while all missions from [[Apollo 7]] used engineers from the Marshall Space Flight Center.\n\nThe second row, after [[Project Gemini]], consisted of the SURGEON, [[EECOM]], and CAPCOM.  The EECOM, which replaced the ENVIRONMENTAL controller and some of the SYSTEMS controller's functions, monitored the spacecraft's electrical and environmental systems.  Like the CAPCOMs during Mercury, all CAPCOMs in the Houston MCC were astronauts. [[File:Apollo 13 Mailbox at Mission Control.jpg|thumb|right|MOCR 2 during the [[Apollo 13]] crisis]]\n\nOn the other side of the aisle of the second row were controllers who monitored specific parts of Gemini, Apollo,  [[Skylab]], ASTP and [[Space Shuttle]] missions. During the Gemini program, the two [[Agena (rocket)|Agena]] controllers monitored the Agena upper stage used as a docking target from [[Gemini 8]] through [[Gemini 12]].  For the Apollo lunar flights, the [[Flight controller#Telemetry, Electrical, EVA Mobility Unit Officer (TELMU)|TELMU]] and CONTROL controllers monitored the Lunar Module.  During Skylab, the [[Flight controller#Electrical Generation and Integrated Lighting Systems Engineer (EGIL)|EGIL]] (pronounced \"eagle\") monitored Skylab's solar panels, while the EXPERIMENTS controller monitored experiments and the telescopes in the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]].  The PAYLOAD and EXPERIMENTS controllers monitored Space Shuttle operations.  Another controller, the [[Instrumentation and Communications Officer|INCO]], monitored the spacecraft's communications and instrumentation.\n\nThe third row consisted of the PAO, PROCEDURES, and the [[Flight controller#Flight Activities Officer (FAO)|FAO]] (flight activities officer), who coordinated with the flight schedule.  The AFD (assistant flight director) and the flight director were also located on the third row.\n\nThe fourth row, like the old Cape MCC's third row, was reserved for NASA management, including the director of the Johnson Space Center, the director of flight operations, the director of flight crew operations (chief astronaut), and the Department of Defense officer.\n\n===Blue FCR (1998\u20132006)===\nThe Blue FCR, used primarily for ISS operations from 1998 to 2006, was arranged in five rows of three consoles, plus one in the rear right corner. From left to right, as viewed from the rear of the room, the front row consisted of [[Flight controller#Attitude Determination and Control Officer (ADCO)|ADCO]], [[Flight controller#Thermal Operations and Resources Office (THOR)|THOR]], and [[Flight controller#Power, Heating, Articulation, Lighting Control Officer (PHALCON)|PHALCON]].\n\nThe second row consisted of [[Flight controller#Operations Support Officer (OSO)|OSO]], [[Flight controller#Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS)|ECLSS]] pronounced \"eekliss\", and [[Flight controller#Robotics Operations Systems Officer (ROBO)|ROBO]].\n\nThe third row consisted of [[Flight controller#Onboard Data Interfaces and Networks (ODIN)|ODIN]], depending on phase of flight, either [[Flight controller#Assembly and Checkout Officer (ACO)|ACO]] (shuttle docked) or the [[Flight controller#Cargo Integration Officer (CIO)|CIO]] (Free-flight Operations) and [[Flight controller#Operations Planner (OpsPlan)|OpsPlan]].\n\nThe fourth row consisted of [[Flight controller#Communication and Tracking Officer (CATO)|CATO]], [[Flight Director|FLIGHT\u2014the flight director]], and [[Flight controller#Capsule Communicator .28CAPCOM.29|CAPCOM]].\n\nThe fifth last row consisted of [[Ground Controller|GC]], depending on the phase of flight; either [[Flight controller#Russian Interface Officer (RIO)|RIO]], [[Flight controller#Extravehicular Activity Officer (EVA)|EVA]], [[Flight controller#Visiting Vehicles Officer (VVO)|VVO]], or [[Flight controller#Flight Dynamics Officer (FDO)|FDO]] (reboosts only), and [[Flight controller#Flight Surgeon (SURGEON)|SURGEON]].\n\nIn the back, right corner, behind the surgeon, the [[Flight controller#Public Affairs Officer (PAO)|PAO (Public Affairs Officer)]] was occasionally present.\n\n===White FCR (1998\u20132011)===\n[[Image:STS-115 Shuttle (White) Flight Control Room.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The White FCR during [[STS-115]] in 2006]]\n\nThe White FCR, which was used for Space Shuttle operations, was arranged in five rows. From left to right, as viewed from the rear of the room):\n\nThe front row (the \"trench\") had [[Flight controller#Flight Dynamics Officer (FDO)|FDO]] (pronounced \"fido\"), responsible for orbital guidance and orbital changes, depending on the phase of flight; either [[Flight controller#Ascent/Entry Guidance and Procedures Office(Ascent/Entry)|Guidance]], a specialist in the procedures of those two high-energy, fast-paced phases of flight or [[Flight controller#Rendezvous Guidance and Procedures Officer (GPO)|rendezvous]], a specialist in orbital rendezvous procedures; and [[Ground Controller|GC]], the controller responsible for the computers and systems in MCC itself.\n\nThe second row had [[Flight controller#Propulsion Officer (Prop)|PROP]], responsible for the propulsion system; [[Flight controller#Guidance Navigation and Control Officer (GNC)|GNC]], responsible for systems that determine the spacecraft's attitude and issue commands to control it; [[Flight controller#Maintenance, Mechanical, Arm, and Crew Systems (MMACS)|MMACS]] (pronounced \"max\"), responsible for the mechanical systems on the space craft, such as the payload bay doors and landing gear; and [[Flight controller#Electrical Generation and Integrated Lighting Systems Engineer (EGIL)|EGIL]] (pronounced \"eagle\"), responsible for the fuel cells, electrical distribution and O<sub>2</sub> & H<sub>2</sub> supplies.\n\nThe third row had [[Data Processing Systems Engineer|DPS]], responsible for the computer systems; [[Flight controller#Assembly and Checkout Officer (ACO)|ACO]] or Payloads, responsible for all payload-related activities (depending on whether the shuttle flight supported an ISS assembly flight or not; [[Flight controller#Flight Activities Officer (FAO)|FAO]], responsible for the overall plans of activities for the entire flight; and [[EECOM]] responsible for the management of environmental systems.\n\nThe fourth row had [[Instrumentation and Communications Officer|INCO]], responsible for communications systems for uploading all systems commands to the vehicle; [[Flight Director|FLIGHT\u2014the Flight Director]], the person in charge of the flight; [[Capsule communicator|CAPCOM]], an astronaut who is normally the only controller to talk to the astronauts on board; and [[Flight controller#Payload Deployment and Retrieval System (PRDS)|PDRS]], responsible for robot arm operations.\n\nThe back row had [[Flight controller#Public Affairs Officer (PAO)|PAO (Public Affairs Officer)]], the \"voice\" of MCC; [[Flight controller#Mission Operations Directorate (MOD)|MOD]], a management representative, depending on the phase of flight; either [[Flight controller#Russian Interface Officer (RIO)|RIO for MIR flights]], a Russian-speaker who spoke with the Russian MCC, known as \u0426\u0443\u043f, (Tsup); [[Booster Systems Engineer|BOOSTER]] responsible for the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|SRBs]] and the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|SSMEs]] during ascent, or [[Flight controller#Extravehicular Activity Officer (EVA)|EVA]] responsible for space suit systems and EVA tasks; and finally, [[Flight controller#Flight Surgeon (SURGEON)|SURGEON]].\n\n===FCR 1 (2006\u2013present)===\n[[Image:STS-128 MCC space station flight control room.jpg|thumb|right|250px|FCR 1 in 2009 during the [[STS-128]] mission.]]\n\nAll US International Space Station operations are currently controlled from FCR 1, remodeled in 2006. This FCR abandoned the traditional tiered floor layout, with all rows instead at the same level.  A few engineering specialists are in the center of the front row, with the public affairs commentator at the right end behind a low partition. The space station trajectory position was moved to the third row.\n\nDuring early ISS operations, a scheme known as Gemini was used, which reduced staffing for real-time ISS support by consolidating six system disciplines into two positions. From these two \"super-consoles\", named Atlas and Titan, two people can do the work of up to eight other flight controllers during low-activity periods.<ref name=\"Oberg 2006\">Oberg, James \"NASA's Newest Flight Control Room\" (October 22, 2006) spaceflight.com</ref> One position, call sign TITAN (Telemetry, Information Transfer, and Attitude Navigation), was responsible for Communication & Tracking (CATO), Command & Data Handling (ODIN), and Motion Control Systems (ADCO). The other position, call sign ATLAS (Atmosphere, Thermal, Lighting and Articulation Specialist), was responsible for Thermal Control (THOR), Environmental Control & Life Support (ECLSS), and Electrical Power Systems (PHALCON).  ATLAS was also responsible for monitoring Robotics (ROBO) and Mechanical Systems (OSO) heaters, as those consoles were not supported during the majority of Gemini shifts.<ref name=\"Oberg 2006\"/> While Gemini officially reflected the fact that two controllers act as \"twins\" during operations, the name was also an homage to the first missions (Project Gemini) controlled from that room. In addition, Titan was the type of booster rocket which launched the Gemini spacecraft and Atlas boosters launched Gemini-era Agena target vehicles (and several missions in Project Mercury).\n\nIn 2010 after ISS assembly complete, the Gemini concept was removed and the six core disciplines were reduced to four. Those console positions are ETHOS (Environmental and Thermal Operating Systems) which consists of the ECLSS system as well as the internal thermal control system formerly held by THOR; SPARTAN (Station Power, ARticulation, Thermal, and ANalysis) which consists of the electrical power and external thermal control systems; CRONUS (Communications RF Onboard Networks Utilization Specialist), a combination of the previous ODIN and CATO positions; and ADCO (Motion Control Systems).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Flight controller]]\n* [[Mission control center]]\n* [[Launch status check]]\n* [[Launch Control Center]] in Florida\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/160406main_mission_control_fact_sheet.pdf NASA Mission Control Fact Sheet]\n* [http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts-jsc.html Space Shuttle News Reference]\n* [http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2006/10/nasas-newest-flight-control-room/ 2006 ISS Flight Control Room]\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Mission Control Center Houston}}\n* [http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/mcc/index.html NASA's MCC page]\n* [http://gis.larc.nasa.gov/historic/Mission_Control_Center MCC history]\n* [http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/101space/101visual2.htm National Park Service Mission Control page]\n* [https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/10/going-boldly-what-it-was-like-to-be-an-apollo-flight-controller/ Detailed behind-the-scenes tour of MOCR 2], by Sy Liebergot.\n* [http://www.balettie.com/mcc/ Mission Control Center Overview]\n\n{{NASA navbox}}\n{{NASA centers}}\n{{National Register of Historic Places}}\n{{Spaceflight landmarks}}\n\n{{Use American English|date=January 2014}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kraft, Christopher C.

Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

In 892, [[Ismail Samani]] (892\u2013907) united the Samanid state under one ruler, thus effectively putting an end to the [[feudal]] system used by the Samanids. It was also under him that the Samanids became independent of Abbasid authority.\n\nThe Samanid Empire is part of the [[Iranian Intermezzo]], which saw the creation of a [[Persianate society|Persianate]] culture and identity that brought Iranian speech and traditions into the fold of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].

The original home of the Samanids is unclear, for some [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] texts claim that the name was derived from a village near [[Samarkand]], while others assert it was a village near [[Balkh]] or [[Termez|Tirmidh]].

He was defeated at a battle near [[Pushang]] in 857, and fled to [[Nishapur]], where he was captured by Ya'qub al-Saffar and sent to Sistan as a hostage.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} The Tahirids thereafter assumed direct control over Herat.\n\n====The Samanid branches in Transoxiana (819\u2013892)====\n{{See Also|Samanid Civil War of 888}}\n[[File:Transoxiana 8th century.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxiana]].]]\nIn 839/40, Nuh seized [[Isfijab]] from the nomadic [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Oghuz Turks|Turks]] living in the [[steppe]]. He thereafter had a wall constructed around the city to protect it from their attacks. He died in 841/2\u2014his two brothers Yahya and Ahmad were then appointed as the joint rulers of the city by the Tahirid governor of Khorasan.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} After Yahya's death in 855, Ahmad took control over Ch\u00e2ch, thus becoming the ruler of most of [[Transoxiana]]. He died in 864/5; his son [[Nasr I]] received Farghana and Samarkand, while his other son [[Ya'qub ibn Ahmad|Ya'qub]] received Ch\u00e2ch (areas around modern Tashkent/Chachkent).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Meanwhile, the Tahirids authority had significantly weakened after suffering several defeats by the Saffarid ruler Ya'qub al-Saffar, thus losing their grip over the Samanids, who became more or less independent. Nasr I used this opportunity to strengthen his authority by sending his brother [[Ismail Samani|Ismail]] to [[Bukhara]], which was in an unstable condition after suffering from raids by the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarazm]]. When Ismail reached the city, he was warmly received by its inhabitants, who saw him as one who could restore order.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Regardless, the [[Bukhar Khudahs]] continued to autonomously rule in Bukhara for a few more years.\n\nAfter not so long, disagreement over where tax money should be distributed started a conflict between the brothers. Ismail was eventually victorious in the dynastic struggle, and took control of the Samanid state. However, Nasr had been the one who had been invested with Transoxiana, and the Abbasid [[caliph]]s continued to recognize him as the rightful ruler. Because of this, Ismail continued to recognize his brother as well, but Nasr was completely powerless, a situation that would continue until his death in August 892.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}}\n\n===Final unification and height of power (892\u2013907)===\n[[File:13 Buhara Mavzolej Ismaila Samanija (2).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Picture of the [[Samanid Mausoleum]], the burial site of [[Ismail Samani]].]]\nA few months later, Ya'qub al-Saffar also died and was succeeded by his brother [[Amr ibn al-Layth]], who saw himself as the heir of the Tahirids, thus claiming Transoxiana, Khorasan and other parts of Iran for himself. He thereafter forced the Abbasid caliph to recognize him as the ruler of those territories, which they did. In the spring of 900, he [[Battle of Balkh|clashed]] with Ismail near [[Balkh]], but was defeated and taken to captivity. Ismail thereafter sent him Baghdad, where he was executed.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} Ismail was thereafter recognized as the ruler of all of Khorasan and Transoxiana by the caliph.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} Furthermore, he also received the investiture over [[Tabaristan]], [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] and [[Isfahan]].{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} It was also during this period that the Afrighid dynasty was forced into submission.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}}\n\nBefore his major victory against the Saffarids, he had made various expeditions in Transoxiana; in 892, he put an end to the [[Principality of Ushrusana]] by seizing all of its lands. During the same period, he put an end to the Bukhar Khudas in Bukhara. In 893, he invaded the territories of the [[Karluk Turks]], taking [[Taraz|Talas]] and converting the [[Church of the East|Nestorian church]] there into a [[mosque]].<ref>Renee Grousset, ''The Empire of the Steppes:A History of Central Asia'', Transl.

The invasion was successful; Muhammad ibn Zayd was killed and Tabaristan was conquered by the Samanids.

Furthermore, because of his campaigns in the north, his empire was so safe from enemy incursions that the defences of Bukhara and Samarkand were unused. However, this later had consequences; at the end of the dynasty, the earlier strong, but now falling apart walls, were greatly missed by the Samanids, who were constantly under attack by the [[Karakhanids]] and other enemies.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=140}}\n\nIsmail died in November 907, and was succeeded by his son [[Ahmad Samani]] (r. 907\u2013914).\n\n===Intermediate period (907\u2013961)===\nNot long after his accession, Ahmad invaded Sistan; by 911, Sistan was under complete Samanid control, and Ahmad's cousin [[Abu Salih Mansur]] was appointed as its governor. Meanwhile, an [[Alids|Alid]] named [[Hasan al-Utrush]] was slowly re-establishing Zaydi over Tabaristan. In 913, Ahmad sent an army under [[Muhammad ibn Sa'luk]] to deal with him. Although the Samanid army was much larger, Hasan managed to emerge victorious. Ahmad, before he could plan another expedition to Tabaristan, was the following year murdered by some of his slaves in a tent near Bukhara.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} During his reign, Ahmad is also said to have replaced the language of the court from Persian to [[Arabic]], which made him unpopular among his subjects, and forced him to change it back to Persian. After Ahmad's death, his eight-year-old son [[Nasr II]] (r. 914\u2013943) succeeded him.\n[[File:NasrIISamanidCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Nasr II]], minted in [[Nishapur]] (933/4).]]\nDue to Nasr's youth, his prime minister [[Abu 'Abd-Allah al-Jaihani]] took care over most of the state affairs. Jaihani was not only an experienced administrator, but also a prominent geographer and greatly educated man. Almost right after Nasr II had ascended the throne, several revolts erupted, the most dangerous one being under the uncle of his father, [[Ishaq ibn Ahmad]], who seized Samarkand and began minting coins there, while his son Abu Salih Mansur seized [[Nishapur]] and several cities in Khorasan. Ishaq was eventually defeated and captured, while Abu Salih Mansur died of natural causes in 915.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} Some time later Nasr II once again had to deal with rebels; in 919, the governor of Khorasan, [[Husayn ibn Ali Marvarrudhi]], rebelled against Samanid authority. Nasr responded by sending an army under [[Ahmad ibn Sahl]] to suppress the rebellion, which the latter managed to accomplish. After a few weeks, however, Ahmad shortly rebelled himself at Nishapur, made incursions into Gorgan, and then fortified himself in [[Merv]] to avoid a Samanid counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Samanid general [[Hamuya ibn Ali]] managed to lure Ahmad out of Merv, and defeated him in a battle at [[Marw al-Rudh]]; he was captured and imprisoned in Bukhara, where he remained until his death in 920.\n\nIn the west, Nasr II clashed several times with [[Daylamite]] and [[Gilaki people|Gilite]] rulers; In 921, the Zaydids under the Gilite ruler [[Lili ibn al-Nu'man]] invaded Khorasan, but were defeated by the [[Simjurids|Simjurid]] general [[Simjur al-Dawati]]. Later in 930, a Dailamite military leader, [[Makan ibn Kaki]], seized Tabaristan and Gurgan, and even took possession of Nishapur in western Khorasan. He was, however, forced to withdraw back to Tabaristan one year later, due to the threat that Samanids posed.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref>Madelung (1975), pp. 211\u2013212</ref> Makan then returned to Tabaristan, where he was defeated by the [[Ziyarid]] ruler [[Mardavij]], who managed to conquer the region.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref name=\"Iran212\">Madelung (1975), p. 212</ref> In 935, Nasr II re-established Samanid control in Gurgan and made Mardavij's successor [[Vushmgir]] his vassal. However, in 939 he declared independence, but was defeated the following year at [[Battle of Iskhabad|Iskhabad]].\n\nIn 943 several Samanid army officers, angry at Nasr's support of [[Isma'ili]] missionaries, formed a conspiracy to murder him. Nasr's son [[Nuh I]], however, learned of the conspiracy. He went to a banquet designed to organize the plot and had the head of their leader cut off. To appease the other officers, he promised to stop the Isma'ili missionaries from continuing their activities. He then convinced his father to abdicate, who died of [[tuberculosis]] after a few months.<ref>''A new text on Ismailism at the Samanid court'', Patricia Crone and Luke Treadwell, '''Texts, documents, and artefacts:Islamic Studies in Honour of D.S. Richards''', ed. Chase F. Robinson, (Brill, 2003), 46.</ref>\n\nRight when Nuh I ascended the throne, a revolt erupted in Khwarazm, which he managed to suppress. Later in 945, he had to deal with the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu 'Ali Chaghani]], who refused to relinquish his post as governor of Khorasan to [[Ibrahim ibn Simjur]]. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then rebelled, and was joined by several prominent figures such as [[Abu Mansur Muhammad]], whom he appointed as his commander-in-chief. In 947, he installed Nuh's uncle [[Ibrahim ibn Ahmad]] as ''amir'' in Bukhara. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then returned to his domains in [[Chaghaniyan]]. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers.\n\nWhen the news of the re-capture of Bukhara arrived to Abu Ali Chaghani, he once again marched towards Bukhara, but was defeated by an army sent by Nuh and withdrew back to Chaghaniyan.

In 999, Nasr b. Ali, a nephew of Harun, returned and took possession of Bukhara, meeting little resistance. The Samanid domains were split up between the [[Ghaznavids]], who gained [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Afghanistan]], and the Karakhanids, who received Transoxiana; the [[Oxus River]] thus became the boundary between the two rival empires.\n\n===Isma'il Muntasir's attempt to resurrect the Samanid state (1000\u20131005)===\n[[File:Isma'il Muntasir.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Artwork of [[Isma'il Muntasir]] in a battle.]]\n[[Isma'il Muntasir]] was the youngest son of Nuh II\u2014he was imprisoned by the Karakhanids after their conquest of Bukhara in 999. Some time later, Isma'il managed to escape to Khwarazm, where he gained support. Driving the Karakhanids out of Bukhara, he then moved on to and captured Samarkand. The approach of the Karakhanid army, however, forced Isma'il to give up all of his possessions, following which he travelled to Khorasan, where he captured Nishapur. Mahmud's army, however, made its way to the region, and Isma'il decided it necessary to flee again.\n\nIn 1003 Isma'il came back to Transoxiana, where he requested for and received assistance from the Oghuz Turks of the [[Zarafshan]] valley. They defeated the Karakhanids in several battles, even when Nasr Khan was involved. For various reasons, however, Isma'il came to feel that he could not rely on the Oghuz to restore him, so he went back to Khorasan. He tried to gain Mahmud's support for a campaign to restore the Samanid state, but failed. Some time afterwards, he returned to the Zarafshan valley, where he gained the support of the Oghuz and others. A Karakhanid army was defeated in May 1004, but subsequently the Oghuz deserted Isma'il during another battle, and his army fell apart.\n\nFleeing to Khorasan yet again, Isma'il attempted to reenter Transoxiana in the end of 1004. The Karakhanids stopped this and Isma'il was nearly killed. Following this, he sought the hospitality of an [[Arab]] tribe near Merv. Their chief, however, killed Isma'il in 1005. His death marked the defeat of the last attempt to restore the Samanid state. Descendants of the Samanid family continued to live in Transoxiana where they were well regarded, but their power was relatively broken.\n\n===Iranian intermezzo===\nAlong with several other states, the Samanid Empire was part of the [[Iranian Intermezzo]], or \"Persian renaissance\". This period has been described as having a key importance in the formation of the Islamic civilization, both politically and culturally. In political terms, it saw an effective break up of the Abbasid power and the rise of several successor states such as the Samanids and Buyids while in cultural terms, it witnessed the rise of new Persian as an administrative and literary language.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OeiKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR19&dq=Medieval+Central+Asia+and+the+Persianate+World,+A.C.S.+Peacock,+D.G.+Tor,+Iranian+Intermezzo#v=onepage&q=Medieval%20Central%20Asia%20and%20the%20Persianate%20World,%20A.C.S.%20Peacock,%20D.G.%20Tor,%20Iranian%20Intermezzo&f=true|title=Medieval Central Asia and the Persianate World: Iranian Tradition and Islamic Civilisation|last=Peacock|first=A.

The main responsibility of both governors and local rulers was to collect taxes and support the Samanid ruler with troops if needed. The most important province in the Samanid Empire was Khorasan, which was in the start given to a relative of the Samanid ruler or a local Iranian prince (such as the [[Muhtajids]]), while it was later given to one of his most trusted slaves. The governor of Khorasan was normally the ''[[sipah-salar]]'' (commander-in-chief).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\nLike in the Abbasid Caliphate, Turkic slaves could in the Samanid state rise to high offices, which would sometimes result the Turkic slaves usurp power, almost making the ruler their puppet.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\n====The nature of political authority under the Samanids====\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Cultural and religious efforts===\n\n\nThe Samanids revived [[Persian culture]] by patronizing [[Rudaki]],<ref>\"Mihragan\", J.

The mass conversion of the Turks to Islam eventually led to a growing influence of the [[Ghaznavids]], who would later rule the region.\n\nAgriculture and trading were the economic basis of Samanid State. The Samanids were heavily involved in trading&nbsp;\u2013 even with Europe, as thousands of Samanid coins that have been found in the Baltic and Scandinavian countries testify.<ref>History of Bukhara, By Narshakhi trans. Richard N. Frye, pg. 143</ref>\n\nAnother lasting contribution of the Samanids to the history of Islamic art is the pottery known as Samanid Epigraphic Ware: plates, bowls, and pitchers fired in a white slip and decorated only with calligraphy, often elegantly and rhythmically written.  The Arabic phrases used in this calligraphy are generally more or less generic well wishes, or Islamic admonitions to good table manners.\n\n===Scholarship===\n\n====Avicenna and Abu Rayhan al-Biruni====\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:The Sasanian King Khusraw and Courtiers in a Garden, Page from a manuscript of the Shahnama (Book of Kings) of Firdawsi, late 15th-early 16th century.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king [[Khosrow II]] and his courtiers in a garden'', page from a manuscript of the [[Shahnameh]], late 15th-early 16th century.

It was during the Samanid period that [[Persian literature]] appeared in Transoxania and was formally recognized.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} The advancement of an Islamic New Persian literature thus started in Transoxiana and Khorasan instead of [[Fars Province|Fars]], the homeland of the Persians. The best known poets of the Samanid period were [[Rudaki]] (d. 941), [[Daqiqi]] (d. 977) and [[Ferdowsi]] (d. 1020).{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nAlthough Persian was the most favorable language, Arabic continued to enjoy a high status and was still popular among the members of the Samanid family.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} For example, [[Al-Tha'\u0101lib\u012b|al-Tha'alibi]] wrote an Arabic anthology named Yatimat al-dahr (\"The Unique Pearl\"). The fourth section of the anthology included a detailed account of the poets that lived under the Samanids. It also states that the poets of Khwarazm mostly wrote in Arabic.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nThe acknowledged founder of Persian classical poetry, and a man of great perception, was Rudaki, who was born in the village of [[Rudaki, Tajikistan|Panjrudak]], which is today part of the [[Panjakent District]] in [[Tajikistan]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} Rudaki was already becoming popular during his early years, due to his poems, his voice, and his great skill in using the [[Chang (instrument)|chang]] (an Iranian instrument similar to the [[harp]]). He was shortly invited to the Samanid court, where he stayed almost the rest of his life. Only less than 2,000 of his poetry lines have survived, but are enough to prove his great poetic skills\u2014he perfected every basic verse forms of medieval Persian poetry; mathnawi, [[qasida]], [[ghazal]] and [[ruba'i]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\"Look at the cloud, how it cries like a grieving man\n: Thunder moans like a lover with a broken heart.\n: Now and then the sun peeks from behind the clouds\n: Like a prisoner hiding from the guard.\"&nbsp;\u2013 Rudaki\n</div>\n\nAnother prominent poet was [[Shahid Balkhi]], born in the village of Jakhudanak near Balkh. Not much is known about his life, but he is mentioned as being one of the best poets in the court of Nasr II, and one of the best scholars of the age. He was also a student of Rudaki, and had close relations with him. He died in 936, a few years before Rudaki's death. His death saddened Rudaki, who afterwards wrote an emotional [[elegy]] about him.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nDaqiqi, who was a native of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], began his career at the court of the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad]] in [[Chaghaniyan]], and was later invited to the Samanid court.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}} Under the Samanids, ancient Iranian legends and heroic traditions were taken in special interest, thus inspiring Daqiqi to write the [[Shahnameh]] (\"The Book of Kings\"), a long [[epic poem]] based on the history of the Iranians. However, by his death in 977, he had only managed to complete a small part of it, which was about the conflict between [[Vishtaspa|Gushtasp]] and [[Arjasp]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nHowever, the most prominent poet of that age, was Ferdowsi\u2014he was born in Tus in 940 to a ''dehqan'' family. It was during his youth that there was a period of growth under the Samanids. The rapid growth of interest in ancient Iranian history made him continue the work of Daqiqi, completing the Shahnameh in 994, only a few years before the fall of the Samanid Empire. He later completed a second version of the Shahnameh in 1010, which he presented to the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud. However, his work was not as appreciated by the Ghaznavids as it was by the Samanids.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Population===\nUnder the Samanid Empire, the [[Zarafshan]] valley, [[Qashqadaryo Region|Kashka Darya]] and [[Usrushana]] were populated by [[Sogdia]]ns; [[Tukharistan]] by the Bactrians; [[Khwarezm]] by the Khwarazmians; the [[Fergana Valley|Ferghana valley]] by the Ferghanans; southern [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] by Khorasanians; and the [[Pamir mountains]] and its surroundings by the [[Saka]] and other early Iranian peoples.

Nasr I used this opportunity to strengthen his authority by sending his brother [[Ismail Samani|Ismail]] to [[Bukhara]], which was in an unstable condition after suffering from raids by the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarazm]]. When Ismail reached the city, he was warmly received by its inhabitants, who saw him as one who could restore order.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Although the [[Bukhar Khudahs]] continued to autonomously rule in Bukhara for a few more years.\n\nAfter not so long, disagreement over where tax money should be distributed, started a conflict between the brothers. Ismail was eventually victorious in the dynastic struggle, and took control of the Samanid state. However, Nasr had been the one who had been invested with Transoxiana, and the Abbasid [[caliph]]s continued to recognize him as the rightful ruler. Because of this, Ismail continued to recognize his brother as well, but Nasr was completely powerless, a situation that would continue until his death in August 892.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}}\n\n===Final unification and height of power (892\u2013907)===\n[[File:13 Buhara Mavzolej Ismaila Samanija (2).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Picture of the [[Samanid Mausoleum]], the burial site of [[Ismail Samani]].]]\nA few months later, Ya'qub al-Saffar also died and was succeeded by his brother [[Amr ibn al-Layth]], who saw himself as the heir of the Tahirids, thus claiming Transoxiana, Khorasan and other parts of Iran for himself.

In the spring of 900, he [[Battle of Balkh|clashed]] with Ismail near [[Balkh]], but was defeated and taken to captivity.

Furthermore, because of his campaigns in the north, his empire was so safe from enemy incursions that the defences of Bukhara and Samarkand were unused. However, this later had consequences; at the end of the dynasty, the earlier strong, but now falling apart walls, were greatly missed by the Samanids, who were constantly under attack by the [[Karakhanids]] and other enemies.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=140}}\n\nIsmail died in November 907, and was succeeded by his son [[Ahmad Samani]] (r. 907\u2013914).\n\n===Intermediate period (907\u2013961)===\nNot long after his accession, Ahmad invaded Sistan; by 911, Sistan was under complete Samanid control, and Ahmad's cousin [[Abu Salih Mansur]] was appointed as its governor. Meanwhile, an [[Alids|Alid]] named [[Hasan al-Utrush]] was slowly re-establishing Zaydi over Tabaristan. In 913, Ahmad sent an army under [[Muhammad ibn Sa'luk]] to deal with him. Although the Samanid army was much larger, Hasan managed to emerge victorious. Ahmad, before he could plan another expedition to Tabaristan, was the following year murdered by some of his slaves in a tent near Bukhara.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} During his reign, Ahmad is also said to have replaced the language of the court from Persian to [[Arabic]], which made him unpopular among his subjects, and forced him to change it back to Persian. After Ahmad's death, his eight-year-old son [[Nasr II]] (r. 914\u2013943) succeeded him.\n[[File:NasrIISamanidCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Nasr II]], minted in [[Nishapur]] (933/4).]]\nDue to Nasr's youth, his prime minister [[Abu 'Abd-Allah al-Jaihani]] took care over most of the state affairs. Jaihani was not only an experienced administrator, but also a prominent geographer and greatly educated man. Almost right after Nasr II had ascended the throne, several revolts erupted, the most dangerous one being under the uncle of his father, [[Ishaq ibn Ahmad]], who seized Samarkand and began minting coins there, while his son Abu Salih Mansur seized [[Nishapur]] and several cities in Khorasan. Ishaq was eventually defeated and captured, while Abu Salih Mansur died of natural causes in 915.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} Some time later Nasr II once again had to deal with rebels; in 919, the governor of Khorasan, [[Husayn ibn Ali Marvarrudhi]], rebelled against Samanid authority. Nasr responded by sending an army under [[Ahmad ibn Sahl]] to suppress the rebellion, which the latter managed to accomplish. After a few weeks, however, Ahmad shortly rebelled himself at Nishapur, made incursions into Gorgan, and then fortified himself in [[Merv]] to avoid a Samanid counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Samanid general [[Hamuya ibn Ali]] managed to lure Ahmad out of Merv, and defeated him in a battle at [[Marw al-Rudh]]; he was captured and imprisoned in Bukhara, where he remained until his death in 920.\n\nIn the west, Nasr II clashed several times with [[Daylamite]] and [[Gilaki people|Gilite]] rulers; In 921, the Zaydids under the Gilite ruler [[Lili ibn al-Nu'man]] invaded Khorasan, but were defeated by the [[Simjurids|Simjurid]] general [[Simjur al-Dawati]]. Later in 930, a Dailamite military leader, [[Makan ibn Kaki]], seized Tabaristan and Gurgan, and even took possession of Nishapur in western Khorasan. He was, however, forced to withdraw back to Tabaristan one year later, due to the threat that Samanids posed.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref>Madelung (1975), pp. 211\u2013212</ref> Makan then returned to Tabaristan, where he was defeated by the [[Ziyarid]] ruler [[Mardavij]], who managed to conquer the region.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref name=\"Iran212\">Madelung (1975), p. 212</ref> In 935, Nasr II re-established Samanid control in Gurgan and made Mardavij's successor [[Vushmgir]] his vassal. However, in 939 he declared independence, but was defeated the following year at [[Battle of Iskhabad|Iskhabad]].\n\nIn 943 several Samanid army officers, angry at Nasr's support of [[Isma'ili]] missionaries, formed a conspiracy to murder him. Nasr's son [[Nuh I]], however, learned of the conspiracy. He went to a banquet designed to organize the plot and had the head of their leader cut off. To appease the other officers, he promised to stop the Isma'ili missionaries from continuing their activities. He then convinced his father to abdicate, who died of [[tuberculosis]] after a few months.<ref>''A new text on Ismailism at the Samanid court'', Patricia Crone and Luke Treadwell, '''Texts, documents, and artefacts:Islamic Studies in Honour of D.S.

Later in 945, he had to deal with the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu 'Ali Chaghani]], who refused to relinquish his post as governor of Khorasan to [[Ibrahim ibn Simjur]]. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then rebelled, and was joined by several prominent figures such as [[Abu Mansur Muhammad]], whom he appointed as his commander-in-chief. In 947, he installed Nuh's uncle [[Ibrahim ibn Ahmad]] as ''amir'' in Bukhara. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then returned to his domains in [[Chaghaniyan]]. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers.\n\nWhen the news of the re-capture of Bukhara arrived to Abu Ali Chaghani, he once again marched towards Bukhara, but was defeated by an army sent by Nuh and withdrew back to Chaghaniyan. After some time, he left the region and tried to obtain support from other Samanid vassals. Meanwhile, Nuh had Chaghaniyan ravaged{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}} and its capital sacked.{{sfn|Frye|1975|pp=149\u2013151}} Another battle shortly ensured between Abu 'Ali Chaghani and a Samanid army in [[Tukharistan]], which resulted in a Samanid victory. Fortunately for Abu Ali Chaghani, he managed to secure the support of other Samanid vassals, such as the rulers of [[Khuttal]], and the Kumiji [[mountain people]], but in the end made peace with Nuh, who allowed him to keep Chaghaniyan in return for sending his son [[Abu'l Muzaffar Abdallah]] as hostage to Bukhara.{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=764\u2013766}}\n[[File:Iran circa 1000AD.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Iran]] in the mid-10th century.]]\n[[Alp Tigin]], nominal vassal of the Samanids, conquered Ghazna in 962 from the Lawik dynasty.<ref>He dispossessed an indigenous family who had ruled in [[Ghazni]], the Lawiks (?), and following him a series of slave commanders, ruled there as nominal vassals of the Samanids; they struck coins but placed the names of the Samanids on them</ref><ref>Gard\u012bz\u012b, ed. \u1e24ab\u012bb\u012b, pp. 161\u201362; J\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b, \u1e6cabaq\u0101t, I, pp. 226\u201327; Ne\u1e93\u0101m-al-Molk, pp. 142\u201358; \u0160ab\u0101nk\u0101ra\u02be\u012b, pp. 29\u201334; Bosworth, 1965, pp. 16\u201321</ref> The fifth of these commanders was Seb\u00fcktigin, who governed \u1e20azna for twenty years till 387/997 with the title (as it appears from his tomb inscription,<ref>Flury, pp. 62\u201363</ref>) of al-\u1e25\u0101jeb al-ajall (most noble commander).

Some time later, Isma'il managed to escape to Khwarazm, where he gained support. Driving the Karakhanids out of Bukhara, he then moved on to and captured Samarkand. The approach of the Karakhanid army, however, forced Isma'il to give up all of his possessions, following which he travelled to Khorasan, where he captured Nishapur. Mahmud's army, however, made its way to the region, and Isma'il decided it necessary to flee again.\n\nIn 1003 Isma'il came back to Transoxiana, where he requested for and received assistance from the Oghuz Turks of the [[Zarafshan]] valley. They defeated the Karakhanids in several battles, even when Nasr Khan was involved. For various reasons, however, Isma'il came to feel that he could not rely on the Oghuz to restore him, so he went back to Khorasan. He tried to gain Mahmud's support for a campaign to restore the Samanid state, but failed. Some time afterwards, he returned to the Zarafshan valley, where he gained the support of the Oghuz and others. A Karakhanid army was defeated in May 1004, but subsequently the Oghuz deserted Isma'il during another battle, and his army fell apart.\n\nFleeing to Khorasan yet again, Isma'il attempted to reenter Transoxiana in the end of 1004. The Karakhanids stopped this and Isma'il was nearly killed. Following this, he sought the hospitality of an [[Arab]] tribe near Merv. Their chief, however, killed Isma'il in 1005. His death marked the defeat of the last attempt to restore the Samanid state. Descendants of the Samanid family continued to live in Transoxiana where they were well regarded, but their power was relatively broken.\n\n===Iranian intermezzo===\nAlong with several other states, the Samanid Empire was part of the [[Iranian Intermezzo]], or \"Persian renaissance\". This period has been described as having a key importance in the formation of the Islamic civilization, both politically and culturally.

It was during the Samanid period that [[Persian literature]] appeared in Transoxania and was formally recognized.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} The advancement of an Islamic New Persian literature thus started in Transoxiana and Khorasan instead of [[Fars Province|Fars]], the homeland of the Persians. The best known poets of the Samanid period were [[Rudaki]] (d. 941), [[Daqiqi]] (d. 977) and [[Ferdowsi]] (d. 1020).{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nAlthough Persian was the most favorable language, Arabic continued to enjoy a high status and was still popular among the members of the Samanid family.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} For example, [[Al-Tha'\u0101lib\u012b|al-Tha'alibi]] wrote an Arabic anthology named Yatimat al-dahr (\"The Unique Pearl\"). The fourth section of the anthology included a detailed account of the poets that lived under the Samanids. It also states that the poets of Khwarazm mostly wrote in Arabic.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nThe acknowledged founder of Persian classical poetry, and a man of great perception, was Rudaki, who was born in the village of [[Rudaki, Tajikistan|Panjrudak]], which is today part of the [[Panjakent District]] in [[Tajikistan]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} Rudaki was already becoming popular during his early years, due to his poems, his voice, and his great skill in using the [[Chang (instrument)|chang]] (an Iranian instrument similar to the [[harp]]). He was shortly invited to the Samanid court, where he stayed almost the rest of his life. Only less than 2,000 of his poetry lines have survived, but are enough to prove his great poetic skills\u2014he perfected every basic verse forms of medieval Persian poetry; mathnawi, [[qasida]], [[ghazal]] and [[ruba'i]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\"Look at the cloud, how it cries like a grieving man\n: Thunder moans like a lover with a broken heart.\n: Now and then the sun peeks from behind the clouds\n: Like a prisoner hiding from the guard.\"&nbsp;\u2013 Rudaki\n</div>\n\nAnother prominent poet was [[Shahid Balkhi]], born in the village of Jakhudanak near Balkh. Not much is known about his life, but he is mentioned as being one of the best poets in the court of Nasr II, and one of the best scholars of the age. He was also a student of Rudaki, and had close relations with him. He died in 936, a few years before Rudaki's death. His death saddened Rudaki, who afterwards wrote an emotional [[elegy]] about him.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nDaqiqi, who was a native of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], began his career at the court of the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad]] in [[Chaghaniyan]], and was later invited to the Samanid court.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}} Under the Samanids, ancient Iranian legends and heroic traditions were taken in special interest, thus inspiring Daqiqi to write the [[Shahnameh]] (\"The Book of Kings\"), a long [[epic poem]] based on the history of the Iranians. However, by his death in 977, he had only managed to complete a small part of it, which was about the conflict between [[Vishtaspa|Gushtasp]] and [[Arjasp]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nHowever, the most prominent poet of that age, was Ferdowsi\u2014he was born in Tus in 940 to a ''dehqan'' family. It was during his youth that there was a period of growth under the Samanids. The rapid growth of interest in ancient Iranian history made him continue the work of Daqiqi, completing the Shahnameh in 994, only a few years before the fall of the Samanid Empire. He later completed a second version of the Shahnameh in 1010, which he presented to the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud.

Scholars, poets, artists and other men of education from many Muslim countries assembled in the Samanid capital of Bukhara, where a rich soil was created for the prosper of creative thought, thus making it one of the most distinguished cultural centres of the Eastern world.

It has a white slip with black slip decoration under a transparent glaze. There is calligraphic decoration all around the bowl. It is elongated at some points and compressed in other areas of the letter to the point where it almost looks abstract. Right in the center of the bowl is a black dot. If the bowl is looked at closely there are cracks and marks that have occurred over time. What would once have been a white bowl is now stained yellow in some areas. The calligraphy looks well thought out and planned. Each letter is well spaced, and the whole saying fits perfectly around the bowl. This may be because the artists used to practice beforehand on paper.

The film tells the story of a litter of [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] puppies who are kidnapped by the villainous [[Cruella de Vil]] (\"deVille\"),<ref>Disney-produced 1961 advertising used the \"deVille\" spelling.\"101 Dalmatians\" (Orpheum Theater advertisement).

Their parents, Pongo and Perdita, set out to save their children from Cruella, in the process rescuing 84 additional puppies that were bought in pet shops, bringing the total of Dalmatians to 101.\n\nThe film was originally released to theaters on January 25, 1961, by [[Buena Vista Distribution]],<ref name=\"Gebert\">{{Cite book|last=Gebert|first=Michael|title=The Encyclopedia of Movie Awards|publisher=St. Martin's Paperbacks|year=1996|isbn=0-668-05308-9}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> and was a box office success, pulling the studio out of the financial slump caused by ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', a costlier production released two years prior.<ref>{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Susan|title='101 Dalmatians' was just the hit a flagging Disney needed|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/classichollywood/la-et-mn-ca-classic-hollywood-dalmatians-20150201-story.html|access-date=February 5, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 31, 2015}}</ref> Aside from its box office revenue, its commercial success was due to the employment of inexpensive animation techniques\u2014such as using [[xerography]] during the process of [[traditional animation|inking and painting traditional animation cels]]\u2014that kept production costs down. Disney released a [[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|live-action adaptation]] in 1996 and a sequel, ''[[102 Dalmatians]]'' in 2000, a [[direct to video]] [[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure|animated sequel]] in 2003 and a [[Cruella (film)|live-action spin-off/prequel]] directed by [[Craig Gillespie]] is scheduled to be released on May 28, 2021.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot length should be between 400 and 700 words. Current word count is 634 words. -->\nRoger Radcliffe is a songwriter who lives in a bachelor flat in [[London]], with his pet [[Dalmatian dog|Dalmatian]], Pongo, who decides to find a wife for Roger and a mate for himself, because he is bored with bachelor life. While watching various women with their female dog look-alikes out the window, he spots the perfect pair, a woman named Anita and her female Dalmatian, Perdita. He quickly gets Roger out of the house and drags him through the park to arrange a meeting. Roger and Anita eventually fall in love and marry with their dogs.\n\nLater, Perdita gives birth to a litter of 15 puppies. That same night, they are visited by [[Cruella de Vil|Cruella De Vil]], a wealthy former schoolmate of Anita's. She offers to buy the entire litter, but Roger says they are not for sale, leading to a falling out. A few weeks later, she hires her henchmen, Jasper and Horace, to steal them. When [[Metropolitan Police Service|Scotland Yard]] is unable to find them, Pongo and Perdita use the \"Twilight bark\", a canine gossip line, to ask for help from the other dogs in London.\n\nAn [[Old English Sheepdog]] named Colonel, along with his compatriots, a gray horse named Captain, and a tabby cat named Sergeant Tibbs, find the puppies in a place called Hell Hall (Cruella's abandoned and dilapidated family estate, also known as The De Vil Place in [[Suffolk]]), along with 84 other Dalmatian puppies that she had bought from various dog stores. When Tibbs learns they are going to be made into dog-skin [[fur coat]]s, the Colonel quickly sends word back to London. Upon receiving the message, Pongo and Perdita leave town to retrieve their puppies. Winter has arrived, and they must cross the [[River Stour, Suffolk|Stour River]] which is running fast and laden with slabs of broken ice. Meanwhile, Tibbs overhears Cruella ordering Jasper and Horace to kill the puppies that night out of fear the police will soon find them. In response, Tibbs attempts to rescue them while Jasper and Horace are preoccupied watching television, but they finish their show and come for them before he can get them out of the house. Pongo and Perdita break in and confront Jasper and Horace just as they are about to kill the puppies. While the adult dogs attack them, the Colonel and Tibbs guide the puppies from the house.\n\nAfter a happy reunion with their own puppies, Pongo and Perdita realize there are dozens of others with them, 99 altogether including their own. Shocked at Cruella's plans, Pongo and Perdita decide to adopt the other 84 puppies, certain that Roger and Anita would never reject them. The Dalmatians begin making their way back to London through deep snow, as all open water is frozen solid. Other animals help them along the way, while Cruella, Jasper, and Horace chase them. In the town of Dinsford, they cover themselves with soot to disguise themselves as [[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]]s, then pile inside a [[moving van]] bound for London. As it is leaving, melting snow clears off the soot and Cruella sees them. Enraged, she follows the van in her car and rams it, but Jasper and Horace, who try to cut it off from above, end up crashing into her. Both vehicles crash into a deep ravine, leaving Cruella and her henchmen stranded and defeated at last as the van drives away.\n\nBack in London, Roger and Anita are attempting to celebrate Christmas and his first big hit, a song about Cruella. They miss their canine companions, but they hear barking outside and the house is filled with dogs after their nanny opens the door. After wiping away the rest of the soot, they are delighted to realize their pets have returned home. After counting 84 extra puppies, they decide to keep all the puppies and use the money from Roger's song to buy a larger house in the country so they can have a Dalmatian plantation.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Rod Taylor]] as Pongo, Roger's pet, Perdita's mate, and the father of 15 of the 99 puppies.\n* [[Cate Bauer]] as Perdita, Anita's Dalmatian pet, Pongo's mate, and the mother of 15 of the 99 puppies.\n* [[Betty Lou Gerson]] as [[Cruella de Vil|Cruella De Vil]], a cruel and eccentric heiress who has Pongo and Perdita's puppies kidnapped with the intention of making fur coats out of them. She has an obsession for pelts, but is only shown wearing a single, voluminous white coat. Beneath this, she wears a skintight black dress. Cruella smokes constantly and drives a long red and black car based on a 1934\u201336 [[Mercedes-Benz 500K]] Cabriolet. She was also Anita's former schoolmate, which is why Anita assumes [[good-faith]] that Cruella is well-meaning despite her eccentric behavior. Roger, however, is far less trusting, and suspects her of being the one to kidnap the puppies (which she did). Gerson also voiced Mrs. Birdwell, a contestant on the show \"What's My Crime?\". [[Mary Wickes]] served as Cruella's live-action model.\n* [[Ben Wright (English actor)|Ben Wright]] as Roger Radcliffe, Pongo's \"pet\" (owner) and Anita's husband. He works as a songwriter and later becomes rich when creating a song about Cruella de Vil. [[Bill Lee (singer)|Bill Lee]] provided Roger's singing voice.\n* [[Lisa Davis (actress)|Lisa Davis]] as Anita Radcliffe, Perdita's owner and Roger's wife. [[Helene Stanley]] served as Anita's live-action model.\n* [[Martha Wentworth]] as Nanny, The Radcliffes' maid. She is very maternal and fussy, detests Cruella, has no patience for teasing, and is very attached to the puppies, but worthless in a crisis except to give the alarm. Wentworth also voiced Queenie, one of three cows who help the puppies when seeking shelter from the cold, and Lucy, a goose who helps send the word along about the puppies, along with Towser.\n* [[J. Pat O'Malley]] and [[Frederick Worlock]] as Jasper and Horace, respectively, Cruella's [[comic relief]] henchmen who carry out the kidnapping of the Dalmatian puppies. Jasper is tall and thin, while Horace is short and fat; otherwise, they are obviously fraternal twin brothers. They argue often. Although they appear to be stupid, Horace appears to be the more intelligent of the two, but is absolutely intimidated by his brother, who has the more ready tongue. Jasper has a closed mind to the possibility of sapience in dogs \u2014 as well as the equal possibility of cleverness in his brother. Jasper drinks alcohol, whereas Horace eats sandwiches. Both enjoy watching a weekly television program called \"What's My Crime?\", wherein the misdeeds of lawbreakers are guessed by a panel of contestants. One of the guest stars of this program, Percival \"Meathead\" Fauncewater, is an acquaintance of theirs. O'Malley also voiced The Colonel, an old [[Old English Sheepdog|sheepdog]] who aids Pongo and Perdita in finding the puppies. Worlock also voiced Inspector Craven, a contestant on \"What's My Crime?\"\n* [[Thurl Ravenscroft]] as The Captain, a [[horse]] who also aids Pongo and Perdita in finding the puppies.\n* [[David Frankham]] as Sergeant Tibbs, a [[tabby cat]] who is the most prominent in masterminding a rescue mission to save the puppies from Cruella.\n* [[Mimi Gibson]] as Lucky, a [[runt]]y puppy of Pongo and Perdita who nearly dies after being born. He is given the name \"Lucky\" because of being revived by Roger. He loves watching TV, and is portrayed as a troublemaker.\n* [[Barbara Beaird]] as Rolly, a puppy who is always hungry, and is shown as pudgier than the rest of the puppies. His collar is tight around his neck with his fat bunched up around it.\n* Mickey Maga as Patch, a puppy who loves Thunderbolt and has a spot on his eye. Patch is aggressive, barking and growling, but is often frightened by Cruella de Vil. He is the star of the animated sequel, ''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]''.\n* Sandra Abbott as Penny, the only puppy not named for her appearance or habits.\n* [[Mary Wickes]] as Freckles, a puppy who has a pattern of spots over the bridge of her nose resembling freckles on a human child. Freckles is shown very tired, or asking many questions.\n* [[Tudor Owen (actor)|Tudor Owen]] as Towser, a [[bloodhound]] who helps spread the news about the stolen puppies, along with Lucy.\n* [[George Pelling]] as Danny, a [[Great Dane]] who aids Pongo and Perdita and is one of the first dogs to answer Pongo's message, along with Scottie.\n* [[Queenie Leonard]] as Princess, one of the three cows who help the puppies when seeking shelter from the cold.\n* [[Marjorie Bennett]] as Duchess, one of the three cows who help the puppies when seeking shelter from the cold.\n* [[Barbara Luddy]] as Rover, one of the 84 Dalmatian puppies that Cruella kidnapped.\n* [[Rickie Sorensen]] as Spotty, one of the 84 Dalmatian puppies that Cruella kidnapped.\n* [[Tom Conway]] as Collie, who offers the Dalmatians shelter for the night at a [[dairy farm]]. Conway also voiced the Quizmaster, the host of \"What's My Crime?\"\n* Ramsay Hill as the [[Labrador Retriever]] who aids the Dalmatians in making it back to London.\n* [[Paul Wexler (actor)|Paul Wexler]] as Car Mechanic\n* [[Basil Ruysdael]] as Truck Driver\n* [[Paul Frees]] as Dirty Dawson, the villain of ''The Thunderbolt Adventure Hour'', the show that the Dalmatians watch.\n* [[Lucille Bliss]] as TV Commercial Singer, who sings the \"Kanine Krunchies\" jingle.\n* [[Junius Matthews]] as Scottie, Danny's terrier friend who is one of the first dogs to answer Pongo's message, along with Danny.\n\n==Production==\n===Story development===\nDodie Smith wrote the book ''[[The Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' in 1956.

In addition to the character animation, Anderson also sought to use Xerography on \"the background painting because I was going to apply the same technique to the whole picture\".<ref name=Anderson /> Along with color stylist [[Walt Peregoy]], the two had the line drawings be printed on a separate animation cel before being laid over the background, which gave the appearance similar to the Xeroxed animation.<ref name=\"Redefining the Line\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Amidi|first=Amid|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/rip/walt-peregoy-101-dalmatians-color-stylist-rip-108028.html|title=Walt Peregoy, '101 Dalmatians' Color Stylist, RIP|publisher=Cartoon Brew|date=January 17, 2015|access-date=March 23, 2016}}</ref> Disney disliked the artistic look of the film and felt he was losing the \"fantasy\" element of his animated films.<ref name=\"Redefining the Line\"/> In a meeting with Anderson and the animation staff concerning future films, Walt said, \"We're never gonna have one of those goddamned things\" referring to ''Dalmatians'' and its technique, and stated, \"Ken's never going to be an art director again\".<ref name=Anderson />\n\nKen Anderson took this to heart, but Walt eventually forgave him on his final trip to the studio in late 1966. As Anderson recalled in an interview:\n\n<blockquote>He looked very sick, I said \"Gee it's great to see you Walt\", and he said \"You know that thing you did on ''Dalmatians''\". He didn't say anything else, but he just gave me this look and I knew that all was forgiven and in his opinion maybe what I did on ''Dalmatians'' wasn't so bad. That was the last time I ever saw him. Then, a few weeks later, I learned he was gone.<ref name=\"Redefining the Line\"/></blockquote>\n\n====Live-action reference====\nAs with the previous Disney films, actors provided live-action reference in order to determine what would work before the animation process begun.

He took further influence from her voice actress, [[Betty Lou Gerson]], with whom he added her cheekbones to the character. He later complimented \"[t]hat [her] voice was the greatest thing I've ever had a chance to work with. A voice like Betty Lou's gives you something to do.

However, unlike the previous animated Disney films at the time, the songs were not composed by a team, but by [[Mel Leven]] who composed both lyrics and music.<ref name=\"Koenig\" /> Previously, Leven had composed songs for the [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]] animation studio in which animators, who transferred to work at Disney, had recommended him to Walt.<ref>{{cite interview|url=https://animatedviews.com/2008/dalmatians-101-spot-light-on-songwriter-mel-leven/|subject=William Leven|title=''Dalmatians'' 101: \"Spot\"-light on songwriter Mel Leven|interviewer=J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Noyer|publisher=Animated Views|date=March 3, 2008|access-date=May 21, 2018}}</ref> His first assignment was to compose \"Cruella de Vil\", of which Leven composed three versions. The final version used in the film was composed as a \"bluesy number\" prior to a meeting with Walt in forty-five minutes.<ref name=\"Koenig\" />\n\nThe other two songs included in the film are \"Kanine Krunchies Jingle\" (sung by [[Lucille Bliss]], who voiced Anastasia Tremaine in Disney's 1950 film ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''), and \"Dalmatian Plantation\" in which only two lines are sung by Roger at its closure. Leven had also written additional songs that were not included in the film. The first song, \"Don't Buy a Parrot from a Sailor\", a [[cockney]] chant, was meant to be sung by Jasper and Horace at the De Vil Mansion.

While watching various women with their female dog look-alikes out the window, he spots the perfect pair, a woman named Anita and her female Dalmatian, Perdita. He quickly gets Roger out of the house and drags him through the park to arrange a meeting. Roger and Anita eventually fall in love and marry with their dogs.\n\nLater, Perdita gives birth to a litter of 15 puppies. That same night, they are visited by [[Cruella de Vil|Cruella De Vil]], a wealthy former schoolmate of Anita's. She offers to buy the entire litter, but Roger says they are not for sale, leading to a falling out. A few weeks later, she hires her henchmen, Jasper and Horace, to steal them. When [[Metropolitan Police Service|Scotland Yard]] is unable to find them, Pongo and Perdita use the \"Twilight bark\", a canine gossip line, to ask for help from the other dogs in London.\n\nAn [[Old English Sheepdog]] named Colonel, along with his compatriots, a gray horse named Captain, and a tabby cat named Sergeant Tibbs, find the puppies in a place called Hell Hall (Cruella's abandoned and dilapidated family estate, also known as The De Vil Place in [[Suffolk]]), along with 84 other Dalmatian puppies that she had bought from various dog stores. When Tibbs learns they are going to be made into dog-skin [[fur coat]]s, the Colonel quickly sends word back to London. Upon receiving the message, Pongo and Perdita leave town to retrieve their puppies. Winter has arrived, and they must cross the [[River Stour, Suffolk|Stour River]] which is running fast and laden with slabs of broken ice. Meanwhile, Tibbs overhears Cruella ordering Jasper and Horace to kill the puppies that night out of fear the police will soon find them. In response, Tibbs attempts to rescue them while Jasper and Horace are preoccupied watching television, but they finish their show and come for them before he can get them out of the house. Pongo and Perdita break in and confront Jasper and Horace just as they are about to kill the puppies. While the adult dogs attack them, the Colonel and Tibbs guide the puppies from the house.\n\nAfter a happy reunion with their own puppies, Pongo and Perdita realize there are dozens of others with them, 99 altogether including their own. Shocked at Cruella's plans, Pongo and Perdita decide to adopt the other 84 puppies, certain that Roger and Anita would never reject them. The Dalmatians begin making their way back to London through deep snow, as all open water is frozen solid. Other animals help them along the way, while Cruella, Jasper, and Horace chase them. In the town of Dinsford, they cover themselves with soot to disguise themselves as [[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]]s, then pile inside a [[moving van]] bound for London. As it is leaving, melting snow clears off the soot and Cruella sees them. Enraged, she follows the van in her car and rams it, but Jasper and Horace, who try to cut it off from above, end up crashing into her. Both vehicles crash into a deep ravine, leaving Cruella and her henchmen stranded and defeated at last as the van drives away.\n\nBack in London, Roger and Anita are attempting to celebrate Christmas and his first big hit, a song about Cruella. They miss their canine companions, but they hear barking outside and the house is filled with dogs after their nanny opens the door. After wiping away the rest of the soot, they are delighted to realize their pets have returned home. After counting 84 extra puppies, they decide to keep all the puppies and use the money from Roger's song to buy a larger house in the country so they can have a Dalmatian plantation.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Rod Taylor]] as Pongo, Roger's pet, Perdita's mate, and the father of 15 of the 99 puppies.\n* [[Cate Bauer]] as Perdita, Anita's Dalmatian pet, Pongo's mate, and the mother of 15 of the 99 puppies.\n* [[Betty Lou Gerson]] as [[Cruella de Vil|Cruella De Vil]], a cruel and eccentric heiress who has Pongo and Perdita's puppies kidnapped with the intention of making fur coats out of them. She has an obsession for pelts, but is only shown wearing a single, voluminous white coat. Beneath this, she wears a skintight black dress. Cruella smokes constantly and drives a long red and black car based on a 1934\u201336 [[Mercedes-Benz 500K]] Cabriolet. She was also Anita's former schoolmate, which is why Anita assumes [[good-faith]] that Cruella is well-meaning despite her eccentric behavior. Roger, however, is far less trusting, and suspects her of being the one to kidnap the puppies (which she did). Gerson also voiced Mrs. Birdwell, a contestant on the show \"What's My Crime?\". [[Mary Wickes]] served as Cruella's live-action model.\n* [[Ben Wright (English actor)|Ben Wright]] as Roger Radcliffe, Pongo's \"pet\" (owner) and Anita's husband. He works as a songwriter and later becomes rich when creating a song about Cruella de Vil. [[Bill Lee (singer)|Bill Lee]] provided Roger's singing voice.\n* [[Lisa Davis (actress)|Lisa Davis]] as Anita Radcliffe, Perdita's owner and Roger's wife. [[Helene Stanley]] served as Anita's live-action model.\n* [[Martha Wentworth]] as Nanny, The Radcliffes' maid. She is very maternal and fussy, detests Cruella, has no patience for teasing, and is very attached to the puppies, but worthless in a crisis except to give the alarm. Wentworth also voiced Queenie, one of three cows who help the puppies when seeking shelter from the cold, and Lucy, a goose who helps send the word along about the puppies, along with Towser.\n* [[Frederick Worlock]] and [[J. Pat O'Malley]] as Horace and Jasper, respectively, Cruella's [[comic relief]] henchmen who carry out the kidnapping of the Dalmatian puppies. Jasper is tall and thin, while Horace is short and fat; otherwise, they are obviously fraternal twin brothers. They argue often. Although they appear to be stupid, Horace appears to be the more intelligent of the two, but is absolutely intimidated by his brother, who has the more ready tongue. Jasper has a closed mind to the possibility of sapience in dogs \u2014 as well as the equal possibility of cleverness in his brother. Jasper drinks alcohol, whereas Horace eats sandwiches. Both enjoy watching a weekly television program called \"What's My Crime?\", wherein the misdeeds of lawbreakers are guessed by a panel of contestants. One of the guest stars of this program, Percival \"Meathead\" Fauncewater, is an acquaintance of theirs. O'Malley also voiced The Colonel, an old [[Old English Sheepdog|sheepdog]] who aids Pongo and Perdita in finding the puppies. Worlock also voiced Inspector Craven, a contestant on \"What's My Crime?\"\n* [[Thurl Ravenscroft]] as The Captain, a [[horse]] who also aids Pongo and Perdita in finding the puppies.\n* [[David Frankham]] as Sergeant Tibbs, a [[tabby cat]] who is the most prominent in masterminding a rescue mission to save the puppies from Cruella.\n* [[Mimi Gibson]] as Lucky, a [[runt]]y puppy of Pongo and Perdita who nearly dies after being born. He is given the name \"Lucky\" because of being revived by Roger. He loves watching TV, and is portrayed as a troublemaker.\n* [[Barbara Beaird]] as Rolly, a puppy who is always hungry, and is shown as pudgier than the rest of the puppies. His collar is tight around his neck with his fat bunched up around it.\n* Mickey Maga as Patch, a puppy who loves Thunderbolt and has a spot on his eye. Patch is aggressive, barking and growling, but is often frightened by Cruella de Vil. He is the star of the animated sequel, ''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]''.\n* Sandra Abbott as Penny, the only puppy not named for her appearance or habits.\n* [[Mary Wickes]] as Freckles, a puppy who has a pattern of spots over the bridge of her nose resembling freckles on a human child. Freckles is shown very tired, or asking many questions.\n* [[Tudor Owen (actor)|Tudor Owen]] as Towser, a [[bloodhound]] who helps spread the news about the stolen puppies, along with Lucy.\n* [[George Pelling]] as Danny, a [[Great Dane]] who aids Pongo and Perdita and is one of the first dogs to answer Pongo's message, along with Scottie.\n* [[Queenie Leonard]] as Princess, one of the three cows who help the puppies when seeking shelter from the cold.\n* [[Marjorie Bennett]] as Duchess, one of the three cows who help the puppies when seeking shelter from the cold.\n* [[Barbara Luddy]] as Rover, one of the 84 Dalmatian puppies that Cruella kidnapped.\n* [[Rickie Sorensen]] as Spotty, one of the 84 Dalmatian puppies that Cruella kidnapped.\n* [[Tom Conway]] as Collie, who offers the Dalmatians shelter for the night at a [[dairy farm]]. Conway also voiced the Quizmaster, the host of \"What's My Crime?\"\n* Ramsay Hill as the [[Labrador Retriever]] who aids the Dalmatians in making it back to London.\n* [[Paul Wexler (actor)|Paul Wexler]] as Car Mechanic\n* [[Basil Ruysdael]] as Truck Driver\n* [[Paul Frees]] as Dirty Dawson, the villain of ''The Thunderbolt Adventure Hour'', the show that the Dalmatians watch.\n* [[Lucille Bliss]] as TV Commercial Singer, who sings the \"Kanine Krunchies\" jingle.\n* [[Junius Matthews]] as Scottie, Danny's terrier friend who is one of the first dogs to answer Pongo's message, along with Danny.\n\n==Production==\n===Story development===\nDodie Smith wrote the book ''[[The Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' in 1956. When [[Walt Disney]] read it in 1957, it immediately grabbed his attention, and he promptly obtained the rights. Smith had always secretly hoped that Disney would make it into a film.<ref name=\"Sincerely Yours\">{{cite DVD notes|title=Sincerely Yours, Walt Disney|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDg5WtLIYLM|type=Bonus feature|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment|format=DVD|location=Burbank, California|year=2008|via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Disney assigned [[Bill Peet]] to write the story, which he did, marking the first time that the story for a Disney animated film was written by a single person.<ref name=thomas>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Bob|title=Disney's Art of Animation: From Mickey Mouse to Hercules|chapter=Chapter 7: The Postwar Films|page=106|year=1997}}</ref> Writing in his autobiography, Peet was tasked by Disney to write a detailed screenplay first before storyboarding.

Walt said the script was \"great stuff\" and commissioned Peet to begin storyboarding.

By 1959, he had modified a Xerox camera to transfer drawings by animators directly to [[cel|animation cels]], eliminating the inking process, thus saving time and money while preserving the spontaneity of the penciled elements.<ref name=\"Finch\">{{cite book|last=Finch|first=Christopher|title=The Art of Walt Disney: From Mickey Mouse to the Magic Kingdom|chapter=Chapter 10: Limited Animation|year=1973|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_0810990075/page/303 303]|edition=1st|publisher=[[Abrams Books|Harry N.

According to [[Chuck Jones]], Disney was able to complete the film for about half of what it would have cost if they had had to animate all the dogs and spots.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/Jones/interview_chuck_jones.htm|title=An Interview with Chuck Jones|publisher=Michaelbarrier.com|access-date=April 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]] proposed the use of the Xerox on ''Dalmatians'' to Walt, who was disenchanted with animation by then, and replied \"Ah, yeah, yeah, you can fool around all you want to\".<ref name=Anderson>{{cite book|last=Canemaker|first=John|title=Before the Animation Begins: The Art and Lives of Disney Inspirational Sketch Artists|publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]]|year=1996|pages=177\u20138|isbn=978-0786861521}}</ref> For the stylized art direction, Anderson took inspiration from British cartoonist [[Ronald Searle]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PMK9MQLnRCEC&pg=PT82&dq=%22work+of+British+cartoonist,+Ronald+Searle%22#v=onepage&q=%22work%20of%20British%20cartoonist%2C%20Ronald%20Searle%22&f=false|last=Norman|first=Floyd|authorlink=Floyd Norman|title=Animated Life: A Lifetime of tips, tricks, techniques and stories from a Disney Legend|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-0240818054|year=2013|access-date=March 23, 2016}}</ref> who once advised him to use a Mont Blanc pen and India ink for his artwork. In addition to the character animation, Anderson also sought to use Xerography on \"the background painting because I was going to apply the same technique to the whole picture\".<ref name=Anderson /> Along with color stylist [[Walt Peregoy]], the two had the line drawings be printed on a separate animation cel before being laid over the background, which gave the appearance similar to the Xeroxed animation.<ref name=\"Redefining the Line\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Amidi|first=Amid|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/rip/walt-peregoy-101-dalmatians-color-stylist-rip-108028.html|title=Walt Peregoy, '101 Dalmatians' Color Stylist, RIP|publisher=Cartoon Brew|date=January 17, 2015|access-date=March 23, 2016}}</ref> Disney disliked the artistic look of the film and felt he was losing the \"fantasy\" element of his animated films.<ref name=\"Redefining the Line\"/> In a meeting with Anderson and the animation staff concerning future films, Walt said, \"We're never gonna have one of those goddamned things\" referring to ''Dalmatians'' and its technique, and stated, \"Ken's never going to be an art director again\".<ref name=Anderson />\n\nKen Anderson took this to heart, but Walt eventually forgave him on his final trip to the studio in late 1966. As Anderson recalled in an interview:\n\n<blockquote>He looked very sick, I said \"Gee it's great to see you Walt\", and he said \"You know that thing you did on ''Dalmatians''\". He didn't say anything else, but he just gave me this look and I knew that all was forgiven and in his opinion maybe what I did on ''Dalmatians'' wasn't so bad. That was the last time I ever saw him. Then, a few weeks later, I learned he was gone.<ref name=\"Redefining the Line\"/></blockquote>\n\n====Live-action reference====\nAs with the previous Disney films, actors provided live-action reference in order to determine what would work before the animation process begun. Actress [[Helene Stanley]] performed the live-action reference for the character of Anita. She did the same work for the characters of [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]] and [[Aurora (Disney)|Princess Aurora]] in ''Sleeping Beauty''.<ref>{{cite web|work=Disney Archives|title=Cinderella Character History|url=https://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/cinderella/cinderella.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803224356/http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/cinderella/cinderella.html|archive-date=August 3, 2003}}</ref> Meanwhile, [[Mary Wickes]] provided the live-action reference for Cruella de Vil.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation|last1=Thomas|first1=Frank|last2=Johnston|first2=Ollie|isbn=978-0786860708|publisher=[[Abbeville Publishing Group|Abbeville Press]]|year=1981|page=320|title-link=Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life}}</ref>\n\n====Character animation====\n[[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc Davis]] was the sole animator on Cruella De Vil. During production, Davis claimed her character was partly inspired by [[Bette Davis]] (no relation), [[Rosalind Russell]], and [[Tallulah Bankhead]]. He took further influence from her voice actress, [[Betty Lou Gerson]], with whom he added her cheekbones to the character. He later complimented \"[t]hat [her] voice was the greatest thing I've ever had a chance to work with. A voice like Betty Lou's gives you something to do.

However, unlike the previous animated Disney films at the time, the songs were not composed by a team, but by [[Mel Leven]] who composed both lyrics and music.<ref name=\"Koenig\" /> Previously, Leven had composed songs for the [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]] animation studio in which animators, who transferred to work at Disney, had recommended him to Walt.<ref>{{cite interview|url=https://animatedviews.com/2008/dalmatians-101-spot-light-on-songwriter-mel-leven/|subject=William Leven|title=''Dalmatians'' 101: \"Spot\"-light on songwriter Mel Leven|interviewer=J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Noyer|publisher=Animated Views|date=March 3, 2008|access-date=May 21, 2018}}</ref> His first assignment was to compose \"Cruella de Vil\", of which Leven composed three versions. The final version used in the film was composed as a \"bluesy number\" prior to a meeting with Walt in forty-five minutes.<ref name=\"Koenig\" />\n\nThe other two songs included in the film are \"Kanine Krunchies Jingle\" (sung by [[Lucille Bliss]], who voiced Anastasia Tremaine in Disney's 1950 film ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''), and \"Dalmatian Plantation\" in which only two lines are sung by Roger at its closure. Leven had also written additional songs that were not included in the film. The first song, \"Don't Buy a Parrot from a Sailor\", a [[cockney]] chant, was meant to be sung by Jasper and Horace at the De Vil Mansion. A second song, \"Cheerio, Good-Bye, Toodle-oo, Hip Hip!\" was to be sung by the dalmatian puppies as they make their way into London.<ref name=\"Koenig\" /> A third song titled \"March of the One Hundred and One\" was meant for the dogs to sing after escaping Cruella by van.

Unlike the original film, none of the animals had speaking voices in this version. Its success in theaters led to ''[[102 Dalmatians]]'', released on November 22, 2000.\n\n====TV series====\nAfter the first live-action version of the film, an animated series titled ''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]'' was launched. The designs of the characters were stylized further to allow for economic animation and to appeal to contemporary trends.\n\n''[[101 Dalmatian Street]]'' is the second TV series with a plot in the 21st century, with a new art style, and a concept loosely based in the source material. It centres on Dylan, a descendant of Pongo and Perdita, caring for his 97 younger siblings with the help of his stepsister Dolly.\n\n====Sequel====\n''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London
