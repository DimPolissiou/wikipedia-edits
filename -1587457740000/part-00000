Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from Ong's father to free his son. A ransom of $20000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 24 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

That night, after barging into the house, when Harun went to search for items to rob, Yasin restrained Poon, and raped the woman. While Yasin was sitting on her chest as he was trying to rape her, Poon suffered fractures on her ribs and she died as a result. Her body was taken to the beach and dumped in the sea, where it was fished out by a fisherman the following morning. 9 months later, when Harun was arrested for an unrelated case of theft, he surprised his interrogators by confessing that he was involved in the robbery. This led to Yasin's arrest and both men were charged with murder. At the end of the trial in early 1974, Harun was convicted of robbery by night and sentenced to 12 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane, while Yasin was sentenced to death for murdering Poon. Although Yasin's appeal against the death sentence was rejected by the Court of Appeal, his appeal to the Privy Council was accepted and he was sentenced to 2 years' jail for committing a rash/negligient act which results in death. Yasin was later charged with rape, but he denied raping the elderly woman at the trial. Yasin was eventually found guilty of attempted rape and sentenced to 8 years' jail, and that sentence was ordered to run consecutively with the jail term he received for causing Poon's death.\n\n* 18 September 1972: A 22-year-old seamstress Cheng Li Zhen was walking along [[Queenstown, Singapore|Queenstown]] with her sister when she suddenly screamed and collapsed to the ground with blood oozing out from her chest.

Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him. During the trial, when asked how he felt when strangling Tay's wife, Sek brought up an incident when he was nearly strangled by someone at the Singapore Boys\u2019 Home until he blacked out.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's 35-year-old school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide any evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty and sentenced him to death for the murder of Liang Shan Shan.

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and tried, claimed that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission over a pen he sold to Tan, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence while he was forced to help dispose the body out of fear. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. Justice Sinnathuray rejected their defences and stating that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and satisfied that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore he convicted both of them as charged and sentenced both of them to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995.\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994 : Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, two Japanese tourists Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56, were robbed by two Malay men, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad. The two acquaintances, who came to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview, saw the Japanse tour group which Fujii and Takashita were with, and deciding to rob them. Takashita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint from the assault. Fujii, however, was severely assaulted by Abdul Nasir. As he was trying to escape, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face. This led to a facial fracture and caused Fujii to suffocate to death. Both men were not arrested until when two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and suffocate a taxi driver. His fingerprints were then tested and found to match those found at the crime scene, and thus he was charged with the murder of Fujii. Abdul Rahman, who was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft, was also charged with murder, however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to one of robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. Judicial Comissioner Choo Han Teck, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial, accepting Abdul Nasir's defence that he had accidentally stepped onto Fujii while rejecting the prosecution's arguement that he had intentionally stamped on Fujii and killed her, therefore he acquitted Abdul Nasir of murder and found him guilty of robbery with hurt and sentenced him to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal, but by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. However, that did not put an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee (who was eventually hanged for drug trafficking) during the period of his remand before the trial, where they briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being abducted. On 3 March 1997, Abdul Nasir was found guilty of kidnapping and despite the urgings of the prosecution to impose the death sentence on Abdul Nasir, Justice T. S. Sinnathuray accepted that Abdul Nasir did not make any threats on the hostages' lives and never harmed the hostages, and thus he sentenced Abdul Nasir to life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane. Justice Sinnathuray also ordered that Abdul Nasir's life sentence should run consecutively with the jail term he received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir had to serve a total of 38 years in prison (At that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir filed an appeal for his two jail terms to run concurrently, but it was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How decided that the definition of life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of 20 years' imprisonment, and this amendment will apply to future cases. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment and hence his life term remained as a jail term of 20 years, and he would still be spending 38 years in prison.\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from Ong's father to free his son. A ransom of $20000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 24 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

That night, after barging into the house, when Harun went to search for items to rob, Yasin restrained Poon, and raped the woman. While Yasin was sitting on her chest as he was trying to rape her, Poon suffered fractures on her ribs and she died as a result. Her body was taken to the beach and dumped in the sea, where it was fished out by a fisherman the following morning. 9 months later, when Harun was arrested for an unrelated case of theft, he surprised his interrogators by confessing that he was involved in the robbery. This led to Yasin's arrest and both men were charged with murder. At the end of the trial in early 1974, Harun was convicted of robbery by night and sentenced to 12 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane, while Yasin was sentenced to death for murdering Poon. Although Yasin's appeal against the death sentence was rejected by the Court of Appeal, his appeal to the Privy Council was accepted and he was sentenced to 2 years' jail for committing a rash/negligient act which results in death. Yasin was later charged with rape, but he denied raping the elderly woman at the trial. Yasin was eventually found guilty of attempted rape and sentenced to 8 years' jail, and that sentence was ordered to run consecutively with the jail term he received for causing Poon's death.\n\n* 18 September 1972: A 22-year-old seamstress Cheng Li Zhen was walking along [[Queenstown, Singapore|Queenstown]] with her sister when she suddenly screamed and collapsed to the ground with blood oozing out from her chest.

Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide any evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty of the murder of Liang Shan Shan and sentenced him to death. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was executed by hanging on 19 May 1995.\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1990===\n* 15 May 1990: Tan Ah Hong and James Soh Fook Leong were stabbed by two men after chatting on the spiral steps of the Amber Beacon Tower at [[East Coast Park]].

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and tried, claimed that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission over a pen he sold to Tan, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence while he was forced to help dispose the body out of fear. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. Justice Sinnathuray rejected their defences and stating that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and satisfied that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore he convicted both of them as charged and sentenced both of them to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995.\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994 : Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, two Japanese tourists Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56, were robbed by two Malay men, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad. The two acquaintances, who came to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview, saw the Japanse tour group which Fujii and Takashita were with, and deciding to rob them. Takashita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint from the assault. Fujii, however, was severely assaulted by Abdul Nasir. As he was trying to escape, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face. This led to a facial fracture and caused Fujii to suffocate to death. Both men were not arrested until when two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and suffocate a taxi driver. His fingerprints were then tested and found to match those found at the crime scene, and thus he was charged with the murder of Fujii. Abdul Rahman, who was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft, was also charged with murder, however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to one of robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. Judicial Comissioner Choo Han Teck, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial, accepting Abdul Nasir's defence that he had accidentally stepped onto Fujii while rejecting the prosecution's arguement that he had intentionally stamped on Fujii and killed her, therefore he acquitted Abdul Nasir of murder and found him guilty of robbery with hurt and sentenced him to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal, but by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. However, that did not put an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee (who was eventually hanged for drug trafficking) during the period of his remand before the trial, where they briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being abducted. On 3 March 1997, Abdul Nasir was found guilty of kidnapping and despite the urgings of the prosecution to impose the death sentence on Abdul Nasir, Justice T. S. Sinnathuray accepted that Abdul Nasir did not make any threats on the hostages' lives and never harmed the hostages, and thus he sentenced Abdul Nasir to life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane. Justice Sinnathuray also ordered that Abdul Nasir's life sentence should be run consecutively with the jail term he received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir had to serve a total of 38 years in prison (At that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir filed an appeal for his two jail terms to run concurrently, but it was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How decided that the definition of life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of 20 years' imprisonment, and this amendment will apply to future cases. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment and hence his life term remained as a jail term of 20 years, and he would still be spending 38 years in prison.\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

Dubbed the \"[[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] of the West\"  by some authors (a term described as one that \"serves the novelist better than the historian\")<ref>Edrington, p. 4</ref>, it was intended as the decisive blow by [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces to break the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] possession of the West along the base of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It was fought at [[Glorieta Pass]] in the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] in what is now [[New Mexico]], and was an important event in the history of the [[New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War]].\n\nThere was a skirmish on March 26 between advance elements from each army, with the main battle occurring on March 28. Although the Confederates were able to push the Union force back through the pass, they had to retreat when their supply train was destroyed and most of their horses and mules killed or driven off. Eventually the Confederates had to withdraw entirely from the territory back into [[Confederate Arizona]] and then [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]]. Glorieta Pass thus represented the climax of the campaign.\n\n==New Mexico Campaign==\n{{Main|New Mexico Campaign}}\nThe lower portion of the New Mexico Territory had been largely neglected by both the federal government and the territorial government in Santa Fe. As a result, Confederate sympathy was strong, in hopes of receiving better treatment by the new government. Following [[Secession in the United States|secession]] moves by residents, Confederate forces seized Mesilla and captured the federal troops there, who made a halfhearted attempt to retreat to Santa Fe. In early 1862 the Confederacy established the [[Arizona Territory (CSA)|Confederate Arizona Territory]], which included the southern halves of both modern [[Arizona]] and New Mexico. The territorial capital was at [[Mesilla, New Mexico|Mesilla]], some {{convert|45|mi}} from El Paso and near today's major city of [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]]. The strategic goals were to gain access to the gold and silver mines of California and the [[Colorado Territory]] and the seaports in [[Southern California]], and thus evade the Union naval blockade.<ref>Frazier, p. 75</ref><ref>Whitlock, pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\nThe commanders of the New Mexico Campaign were Confederate [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Henry Hopkins Sibley]] and  Union [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Edward Canby]]. Sibley attempted to capture [[Fort Craig]], completely outmaneuvering Canby at the [[Battle of Valverde]] in February and driving him back into his fort, but failed to force Canby's surrender. Sibley then bypassed the fort and advanced north through the [[Rio Grande]] Valley, occupying [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on March 10. Canby remained at Fort Craig, hoping to cut Sibley's logistical support from Texas and awaiting reinforcements before he dared to take the offensive. Sibley made his headquarters at the abandoned Union storehouse at [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]].\n\nIn March Sibley sent a Confederate force of 200-300 [[Texas|Texans]] under the command of [[Major (United States)|Maj.]] [[Charles L. Pyron]] on an advance expedition over the [[Glorieta Pass]], a strategic location on the [[Santa Fe Trail]] at the southern tip of the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] southeast of Santa Fe.<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\"/> Control of the pass would allow the Confederates to advance onto the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] and make an assault on [[Fort Union National Monument|Fort Union]], a Union stronghold on the route northward over [[Raton Pass]]. Sibley sent six companies under the command of Col. Tom Green to block the eastern end of Glorieta Pass, turning any Union defensive position in the Sangre de Cristos.<ref>Frazier, p. 199</ref>\n\n==Opposing forces==\n===Union (North)===\n{{Further|Glorieta Pass order of battle#Union Army|l1=Union order of battle}}\n\n===Confederate===\n{{Further|Glorieta Pass order of battle#Confederate Army|l1=Confederate order of battle}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:glorietapass.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Battle of Glorieta Pass: actions on March 28\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}]]\n\nThe Confederates were led by<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qfg02|title=GLORIETA, BATTLE OF &#124; The Handbook of Texas Online&#124; Texas State Historical Association (TSHA)|publisher=Tshaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-18}}</ref> Charles L. Pyron and [[William Read Scurry]]. During the battle on March 26, Pyron had his battalion of the [[2nd Texas Mounted Rifles]],<ref>This battalion also included companies of Arizona Confederates.</ref> four companies of the [[5th Texas Mounted Rifles]] under Maj. John Shropshire and two cannons. Scurry's force included nine companies of the [[4th Texas Mounted Rifles]] under Maj. Henry Raguet, five companies of the [[7th Texas Mounted Rifles]] under Maj. Powhatan Jordan and three additional cannons.\n\nThe Union forces were led by Col. [[John P. Slough]] of the [[1st Colorado Infantry]], with units under the command of Maj. [[John M. Chivington]]. In the action on March 26, Chivington had three infantry companies and one mounted company of the 1st Colorado and a detachment of the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st]] and [[3rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|3rd]] U.S. Cavalry regiments.<ref>Whitlock, p. 171</ref> During the main battle on the 28th, Slough commanded, in person, nine companies of the 1st Colorado, a detachment from the 1st, [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd]] and 3rd U.S. Cavalry regiments and two artillery batteries.<ref>Frazier, pp. 205, 215</ref> Chivington commanded five companies of the 5th U.S. Infantry, one company from the 1st Colorado, [[James Hobart Ford]]'s independent company from the 2nd Colorado and some New Mexico militiamen.<ref>Whitlock, p. 188</ref>\n\nPrior to the battle Union forces performed a forced march from [[Denver]], over [[Raton Pass]], to Fort Union and then to Glorieta Pass, covering the distance of {{convert|400|mi|-2}} in 14 days. Combat commenced shortly after their arrival at the battlefield, leaving them little time to recuperate.<ref>Hudnall, p. 291</ref>\n\n===Apache Canyon===\n[[File:Battle of Glorieta Pass Action at Apache Canyon.jpg|thumb|Action at Apache Canyon.]]\nPyron's force of 300 camped at Apache Canyon, at one end of Glorieta Pass, leaving a picket post of 50 men at the summit of the pass. Chivington led 418 soldiers to the pass and, on the morning of March 26, moved out to attack. After noon Chivington's men captured the picket post and found the main force behind them. Chivington advanced on them, but their [[Field artillery in the American Civil War|artillery]] fire threw him back. He regrouped, split his force to the two sides of the pass, caught the Confederates in a crossfire, and soon forced them to retire. Pyron retired about {{convert|1.5|mi}} to a narrow section of the pass and formed a defensive line before Chivington's men appeared. The Union forces flanked Pyron's men again and punished them with [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire. Pyron ordered another retreat, but the withdrawal of the artillery caused the Confederates to become disorganized and start fighting in separate clusters of men. Chivington ordered a mounted Colorado company to make a frontal charge against the artillery; this succeeded in capturing several Confederates and scattering the rest. Not knowing if Confederate reinforcements were nearby, Chivington then retired and went into camp at [[Kozlowski's Ranch]] to await Slough with the main body. His small victory was a morale boost for Slough's army.<ref>Josephy, pp. 79\u201381.</ref><ref>Frazier, pp. 208\u2013210</ref>\n\nNo fighting occurred the next day, as reinforcements arrived for both sides. Scurry's troops arrived at 3:00&nbsp;am on March 27, swelling the Confederate force to about 1,100 men and five cannons; as senior officer present, he took command of the entire Confederate force. Thinking that Slough would attack again and expecting Green to arrive in the Union rear at any time, Scurry chose to remain in place for the day, digging rifle pits.<ref>Frazier, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> Slough arrived early in the morning of March 28 with about 900 more men, bringing the Union strength to 1,300.\n\n===Glorieta Pass===\n[[File:GP Battlefield.jpg|left|thumb|Glorieta Pass battlefield. This photograph was taken in 1990 from Sharpshooter's Ridge, just north of Pigeon's Ranch. It was the location of the Union right flank during the last day's battle.]]\nBoth Scurry and Slough decided to attack on March 28 and set out early to do so. Expecting the Confederates to remain in Apache Canyon, Slough sent Chivington with two infantry battalions, under Lewis and Wynkoop, out in a circling movement with orders to go hide out at Glorieta Pass and hit the Texans in the flank once Slough's main force had engaged their front.<ref>Frazier, p. 214</ref> Chivington did as ordered and his men waited above the pass for Slough and the enemy to arrive. However, instead of remaining at Apache Canyon as Slough had expected, Scurry advanced down the canyon more rapidly than Slough had anticipated. Scurry believed the Union force was retreating to Fort Union. He intended to attack them until Green could arrive. One cannon and a small guard was left at [[Johnson's Ranch]], while the rest of the Confederate force\u2014more than 1000 men\u2014marched eastwards along the Santa Fe Trail.<ref>Frazier, pp. 213\u2013214.</ref>\n\nWhen Slough found the Texans so far forward he launched an attack, hitting them about 11:00&nbsp;am some {{convert|1/2|mi|m}} from Pigeon's Ranch. A provisional battalion of four companies from the 1st Colorado, supported by both batteries, was commanded by Lt. Col. Samuel Tappan, who deployed his men across the trail.<ref>Whitlock, p. 190</ref> The Confederates dismounted and formed a line across the canyon, but the terrain caused some companies to become intermingled.<ref>Frazier, p. 216</ref> Tappan was initially successful and held his ground for a half-hour, but the Confederates' numerical superiority enabled them to outflank Tappan's line by noon. The Union troops were thrown back in confusion but managed to take up position around the adobe ranch buildings.<ref>[http://thisweekinthecivilwar.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1073/] {{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> Slough reformed his men several hundred yards closer to [[Pigeon's Ranch]], with the four companies under Tappan and an artillery battery on a hill to the left, the other battery supported by two companies in the center across the road and the remaining two companies on the ridge to the right.<ref>Whitlock, p. 200.</ref>\n\nScurry then launched a three-pronged attack. Pyron and Raguet were ordered to attack the Union right, Shropshire the Union left, with the remainder led by Scurry against the Union center, and the artillery firing in support.<ref>Frazier, p. 219.</ref> The attack on the Union left was beaten back, with Shropshire killed. The attack on the center stalled, while the artillery was forced to withdraw after one cannon was disabled and a limber destroyed. The attack itself then stalled, with the Confederates fighting by squads \"with a desperation unequaled by any engagement of the war.\"<ref>Whitlock, p. 201</ref> At around 3:00&nbsp;pm the Confederates outflanked the Union right, but Raguet was mortally wounded. From the ridge (thereafter known as \"Sharpshooters Ridge\"), Confederate riflemen started picking off the artillerymen and infantry below them. Scurry again pressed the Union center, and the Union position became untenable. Slough reluctantly ordered a retreat, and Tappan formed the companies on the left into a rear guard. Slough reformed his line a half-mile east of Pigeon's Ranch, where skirmishing continued until dusk. The Union men finally retreated to Kozlowski's Ranch, leaving the Confederates in possession of the battlefield.\n\n====Johnson's Ranch====\nWith the sounds of battle echoing in the distance, Lt. Col. [[Manuel Antonio Chaves|Manuel Chaves]] of the [[2nd New Mexico Infantry]], commander of the New Mexican volunteers, informed Maj. Chivington that his scouts had located the Confederate supply train at Johnson's Ranch. After watching the supply train for an hour, Chivington's force descended the slope and attacked, driving off or capturing the small guard with few casualties on either side.<ref>Three Confederates were killed and several wounded, including the regimental chaplain; two officers and 15 men were captured. The only Union casualty was one man injured by flying debris from the exploding ammunition wagons. Whitlock pp. 206\u2013207.</ref> They then looted and burned 80 supply wagons and spiked the cannon, either killing or driving off about 500 horses and mules before returning with their prisoners to Kozlowski's Ranch.<ref>Frazier, p. 226</ref> With no supplies to sustain his advance, Scurry had to retreat to Santa Fe, the first step on the long road back to [[San Antonio]], Texas. Thanks to Chaves' assistance, the Federals had turned a defeat into victory and stopped further Confederate advances in the Southwest. Glorieta Pass was the turning point of the war in the [[New Mexico Territory]].\n\nOne of Chaves' scouts was Anastasio Duran. He was stationed with the Union Army at Fort Union and was a resident of Chaperito (or Chaparito), New Mexico. He was considered a \"[[Comanchero]]\" by U.S. Army officers and was renowned for his hunting skills. He was intimately familiar with the terrain. Duran was the lead scout who led Chivington's forces to attack behind Confederate lines at the Battle of Glorieta Pass.<ref>This information is compiled from the oral history of the Duran family of New Mexico, recorded in 1976 by L J Bonney, Esq. and from documents of the era in possession of the Duran family. One such document was the Fort Union commander's written commendation thanking Duran for his service in the battle and naming him the most proficient scout for the Union Army in the New Mexico.\n*Note 1: Duran's family stated that he also voluntarily chose to join the war on the Union side because it included a war against Texas. Texas was considered enemy territory at this time by many native New Mexicans (Indio-Hispano and American Indian).\n*Note 2: Much native New Mexican history before 1900, both Indio-Hispano and American Indian, not related to Anglo events, is of an oral nature.</ref>\n\nParts of the battlefield are preserved in [[Pecos National Historical Park]].\n\n==Controversy==\nMany New Mexicans disputed the view that Chivington was the hero of Johnson's Ranch. Many Santa Fe residents credited James L. Collins, a [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] official, who had suggested the roundabout attack on the supply train. Chivington had actually been sent out in hopes of making a flank attack, and the discovery of the supply train was a lucky accident. He was also accused of almost letting the opportunity slip by him. On January 23, 1864, the New Mexico Territorial Legislature adopted a resolution that did not mention Chivington and instead asked [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] to promote William H. Lewis and Asa B. Carey, both regular army officers, for \"distinguished service\" in the battle. On March 8 the ''Rio Abajo Press'' of Albuquerque complained about \"Col. Chivington's strutting about in plumage stolen from Captain William H. Lewis\" (it did not mention Carey). According to the newspaper editor, \"Some one of the party\" suggested the attack, which Chivington only agreed to after \"two hours persuasion.\" Furthermore, Lewis had led the attack, while Chivington was \"viewing the scene from afar\".<ref>Keleher, pp. 180\u2013182.</ref>\n\nA more serious charge made against Chivington was that if he had hurried to reinforce Slough as soon as he heard gunfire coming from Pigeon's Ranch, his 400 men might have been enough to win the battle for the Federals, especially if he had attacked Scurry's flank as he had been ordered.<ref>One reason Chivington failed to come was due to an acoustic shadow that prevented him from hearing sounds from the battle. Whitlock, p. 205.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Glorieta Pass.png|thumb|right|Battle of Glorieta Pass marker at the Cuerno Verde Rest Area, Colorado.]]\nIn the end, the Battle of Glorieta Pass was consequential. First, despite the fact that the Confederates took the field, they were forced to retreat to Santa Fe due to the destruction of their supplies and eventually abandon New Mexico Territory.<ref>Frazier, p. 230.</ref> Second, the battle at Glorieta foiled Sibley's plan to obtain his key objective: the capture of the major federal base at Fort Union. That would have broken federal resistance in New Mexico and compelled Union forces to retire north of Raton Pass and back into Colorado Territory.<ref>Josephy, pp. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\nIn any case, the dream of a Confederate stronghold in the Southwest was impractical; New Mexico could not provide enough sustenance for any prolonged Confederate occupation.<ref>Whitlock, pp. 240\u2013241</ref> Furthermore, the approach of the Federal \"[[California Column]]\" eastward through the New Mexico Territory during the summer of 1862 would have seriously jeopardized Confederate control of the region.\n\n==Battlefield preservation==\n{{Main|Glorieta Pass Battlefield}}\n[[File:Battle of Glorieta Pass Battlefield.jpg|thumb|right|The battlefield in 2012.]]\n\nIn 1987 two Confederate burial sites were discovered at Pigeon's Ranch. One was the solitary grave of Maj. John Samuel Shropshire, the other was a mass grave of 30 Confederates. Only Shropshire and five others could be positively identified<ref>[http://www.lasvegasmuseum.org/pdf/Glorieta.pdf ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006082935/http://www.lasvegasmuseum.org/pdf/Glorieta.pdf |date=October 6, 2014 }}</ref> On August 5, 1990, Maj.

The Battle of Glorieta Pass received the highest rating from the commission, priority I (class A). Class A battlefields are principal strategic operations having a direct impact on the course of the war. With this rating the commission placed Glorieta Pass on the same level as battles such as [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] and [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]]. The priority I rating identified Glorieta Pass as being not only one of the most important, but also one of the most highly endangered battlefields in the country. Only ten other battlefields received the priority I (class A) rating. The commission recommended that Congress focus its preservation efforts on priority I, nationally significant battlefields.<ref>''Civil War Sites Advisory Commission Report on the Nation's Civil War Battlefields''.

Dubbed the \"[[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] of the West\"  by some authors (a term described as one that \"serves the novelist better than the historian\")<ref>Edrington, p. 4</ref>, it was intended as the decisive blow by [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces to break the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] possession of the West along the base of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It was fought at [[Glorieta Pass]] in the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] in what is now [[New Mexico]], and was an important event in the history of the [[New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War]].\n\nThere was a skirmish on March 26 between advance elements from each army, with the main battle occurring on March 28. Although the Confederates were able to push the Union force back through the pass, they had to retreat when their supply train was destroyed and most of their horses and mules killed or driven off. Eventually the Confederates had to withdraw entirely from the territory back into [[Confederate Arizona]] and then [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]]. Glorieta Pass thus represented the climax of the campaign.\n\n==New Mexico Campaign==\n{{Main|New Mexico Campaign}}\nThe lower portion of the New Mexico Territory had been largely neglected by both the federal government and the territorial government in Santa Fe. As a result, Confederate sympathy was strong, in hopes of receiving better treatment by the new government. Following [[Secession in the United States|secession]] moves by residents, Confederate forces seized Mesilla and captured the federal troops there, who made a halfhearted attempt to retreat to Santa Fe. In early 1862 the Confederacy established the [[Arizona Territory (CSA)|Confederate Arizona Territory]], which included the southern halves of both modern [[Arizona]] and New Mexico. The territorial capital was at [[Mesilla, New Mexico|Mesilla]], some {{convert|45|mi}} from El Paso and near today's major city of [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]]. The strategic goals were to gain access to the gold and silver mines of California and the [[Colorado Territory]] and the seaports in [[Southern California]], and thus evade the Union naval blockade.<ref>Frazier, p. 75</ref><ref>Whitlock, pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\nThe commanders of the New Mexico Campaign were Confederate [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Henry Hopkins Sibley]] and  Union [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Edward Canby]]. Sibley attempted to capture [[Fort Craig]], completely outmaneuvering Canby at the [[Battle of Valverde]] in February and driving him back into his fort, but failed to force Canby's surrender. Sibley then bypassed the fort and advanced north through the [[Rio Grande]] Valley, occupying [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on March 10. Canby remained at Fort Craig, hoping to cut Sibley's logistical support from Texas and awaiting reinforcements before he dared to take the offensive. Sibley made his headquarters at the abandoned Union storehouse at [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]].\n\nIn March Sibley sent a Confederate force of 200-300 [[Texas|Texans]] under the command of [[Major (United States)|Maj.]] [[Charles L. Pyron]] on an advance expedition over the [[Glorieta Pass]], a strategic location on the [[Santa Fe Trail]] at the southern tip of the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] southeast of Santa Fe.<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\"/> Control of the pass would allow the Confederates to advance onto the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] and make an assault on [[Fort Union National Monument|Fort Union]], a Union stronghold on the route northward over [[Raton Pass]]. Sibley sent six companies under the command of Col. Tom Green to block the eastern end of Glorieta Pass, turning any Union defensive position in the Sangre de Cristos.<ref>Frazier, p. 199</ref>\n\n==Opposing forces==\n===Union (North)===\n{{Further|Glorieta Pass order of battle#Union Army|l1=Union order of battle}}\n\n===Confederate===\n{{Further|Glorieta Pass order of battle#Confederate Army|l1=Confederate order of battle}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:glorietapass.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Battle of Glorieta Pass: actions on March 28\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}]]\n\nThe Confederates were led by<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qfg02|title=GLORIETA, BATTLE OF &#124; The Handbook of Texas Online&#124; Texas State Historical Association (TSHA)|publisher=Tshaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-18}}</ref> Charles L. Pyron and [[William Read Scurry]]. During the battle on March 26, Pyron had his battalion of the [[2nd Texas Mounted Rifles]],<ref>This battalion also included companies of Arizona Confederates.</ref> four companies of the [[5th Texas Mounted Rifles]] under Maj. John Shropshire and two cannons. Scurry's force included nine companies of the [[4th Texas Mounted Rifles]] under Maj. Henry Raguet, five companies of the [[7th Texas Mounted Rifles]] under Maj. Powhatan Jordan and three additional cannons.\n\nThe Union forces were led by Col. [[John P. Slough]] of the [[1st Colorado Infantry]], with units under the command of Maj. [[John M. Chivington]]. In the action on March 26, Chivington had three infantry companies and one mounted company of the 1st Colorado and a detachment of the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st]] and [[3rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|3rd]] U.S. Cavalry regiments.<ref>Whitlock, p. 171</ref> During the main battle on the 28th, Slough commanded, in person, nine companies of the 1st Colorado, a detachment from the 1st, [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd]] and 3rd U.S. Cavalry regiments and two artillery batteries.<ref>Frazier, pp. 205, 215</ref> Chivington commanded five companies of the 5th U.S. Infantry, one company from the 1st Colorado, [[James Hobart Ford]]'s independent company from the 2nd Colorado and some New Mexico militiamen.<ref>Whitlock, p. 188</ref>\n\nPrior to the battle Union forces performed a forced march from [[Denver]], over [[Raton Pass]], to Fort Union and then to Glorieta Pass, covering the distance of {{convert|400|mi|-2}} in 14 days. Combat commenced shortly after their arrival at the battlefield, leaving them little time to recuperate.<ref>Hudnall, p. 291</ref>\n\n===Apache Canyon===\n[[File:Battle of Glorieta Pass Action at Apache Canyon.jpg|thumb|Action at Apache Canyon.]]\nPyron's force of 300 camped at Apache Canyon, at one end of Glorieta Pass, leaving a picket post of 50 men at the summit of the pass. Chivington led 418 soldiers to the pass and, on the morning of March 26, moved out to attack. After noon Chivington's men captured the picket post and found the main force behind them. Chivington advanced on them, but their [[Field artillery in the American Civil War|artillery]] fire threw him back. He regrouped, split his force to the two sides of the pass, caught the Confederates in a crossfire, and soon forced them to retire. Pyron retired about {{convert|1.5|mi}} to a narrow section of the pass and formed a defensive line before Chivington's men appeared. The Union forces flanked Pyron's men again and punished them with [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire. Pyron ordered another retreat, but the withdrawal of the artillery caused the Confederates to become disorganized and start fighting in separate clusters of men. Chivington ordered a mounted Colorado company to make a frontal charge against the artillery; this succeeded in capturing several Confederates and scattering the rest. Not knowing if Confederate reinforcements were nearby, Chivington then retired and went into camp at [[Kozlowski's Ranch]] to await Slough with the main body. His small victory was a morale boost for Slough's army.<ref>Josephy, pp. 79\u201381.</ref><ref>Frazier, pp. 208\u2013210</ref>\n\nNo fighting occurred the next day, as reinforcements arrived for both sides. Scurry's troops arrived at 3:00&nbsp;am on March 27, swelling the Confederate force to about 1,100 men and five cannons; as senior officer present, he took command of the entire Confederate force. Thinking that Slough would attack again and expecting Green to arrive in the Union rear at any time, Scurry chose to remain in place for the day, digging rifle pits.<ref>Frazier, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> Slough arrived early in the morning of March 28 with about 900 more men, bringing the Union strength to 1,300.\n\n===Glorieta Pass===\n[[File:GP Battlefield.jpg|left|thumb|Glorieta Pass battlefield. This photograph was taken in 1990 from Sharpshooter's Ridge, just north of Pigeon's Ranch. It was the location of the Union right flank during the last day's battle.]]\nBoth Scurry and Slough decided to attack on March 28 and set out early to do so. Expecting the Confederates to remain in Apache Canyon, Slough sent Chivington with two infantry battalions, under Lewis and Wynkoop, out in a circling movement with orders to go hide out at Glorieta Pass and hit the Texans in the flank once Slough's main force had engaged their front.<ref>Frazier, p. 214</ref> Chivington did as ordered and his men waited above the pass for Slough and the enemy to arrive. However, instead of remaining at Apache Canyon as Slough had expected, Scurry advanced down the canyon more rapidly than Slough had anticipated. Scurry believed the Union force was retreating to Fort Union. He intended to attack them until Green could arrive. One cannon and a small guard was left at [[Johnson's Ranch]], while the rest of the Confederate force\u2014more than 1000 men\u2014marched eastwards along the Santa Fe Trail.<ref>Frazier, pp. 213\u2013214.</ref>\n\nWhen Slough found the Texans so far forward he launched an attack, hitting them about 11:00&nbsp;am some {{convert|1/2|mi|m}} from Pigeon's Ranch. A provisional battalion of four companies from the 1st Colorado, supported by both batteries, was commanded by Lt. Col. Samuel Tappan, who deployed his men across the trail.<ref>Whitlock, p. 190</ref> The Confederates dismounted and formed a line across the canyon, but the terrain caused some companies to become intermingled.<ref>Frazier, p. 216</ref> Tappan was initially successful and held his ground for a half-hour, but the Confederates' numerical superiority enabled them to outflank Tappan's line by noon. The Union troops were thrown back in confusion but managed to take up position around the adobe ranch buildings.<ref>[http://thisweekinthecivilwar.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1073/] {{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> Slough reformed his men several hundred yards closer to [[Pigeon's Ranch]], with the four companies under Tappan and an artillery battery on a hill to the left, the other battery supported by two companies in the center across the road and the remaining two companies on the ridge to the right.<ref>Whitlock, p. 200.</ref>\n\nScurry then launched a three-pronged attack. Pyron and Raguet were ordered to attack the Union right, Shropshire the Union left, with the remainder led by Scurry against the Union center, and the artillery firing in support.<ref>Frazier, p. 219.</ref> The attack on the Union left was beaten back, with Shropshire killed. The attack on the center stalled, while the artillery was forced to withdraw after one cannon was disabled and a limber destroyed. The attack itself then stalled, with the Confederates fighting by squads \"with a desperation unequaled by any engagement of the war.\"<ref>Whitlock, p. 201</ref> At around 3:00&nbsp;pm the Confederates outflanked the Union right, but Raguet was mortally wounded. From the ridge (thereafter known as \"Sharpshooters Ridge\"), Confederate riflemen started picking off the artillerymen and infantry below them. Scurry again pressed the Union center, and the Union position became untenable. Slough reluctantly ordered a retreat, and Tappan formed the companies on the left into a rear guard. Slough reformed his line a half-mile east of Pigeon's Ranch, where skirmishing continued until dusk. The Union men finally retreated to Kozlowski's Ranch, leaving the Confederates in possession of the battlefield.\n\n====Johnson's Ranch====\nWith the sounds of battle echoing in the distance, Lt. Col. [[Manuel Antonio Chaves|Manuel Chaves]] of the [[2nd New Mexico Infantry]], commander of the New Mexican volunteers, informed Maj. Chivington that his scouts had located the Confederate supply train at Johnson's Ranch. After watching the supply train for an hour, Chivington's force descended the slope and attacked, driving off or capturing the small guard with few casualties on either side.<ref>Three Confederates were killed and several wounded, including the regimental chaplain; two officers and 15 men were captured. The only Union casualty was one man injured by flying debris from the exploding ammunition wagons. Whitlock pp. 206\u2013207.</ref> They then looted and burned 80 supply wagons and spiked the cannon, either killing or driving off about 500 horses and mules before returning with their prisoners to Kozlowski's Ranch.<ref>Frazier, p. 226</ref> With no supplies to sustain his advance, Scurry had to retreat to Santa Fe, the first step on the long road back to [[San Antonio]], Texas. Thanks to Chaves' assistance, the Federals had turned a defeat into victory and stopped further Confederate advances in the Southwest. Glorieta Pass was the turning point of the war in the [[New Mexico Territory]].\n\nOne of Chaves' scouts was Anastasio Duran. He was stationed with the Union Army at Fort Union and was a resident of Chaperito (or Chaparito), New Mexico. He was considered a \"[[Comanchero]]\" by U.S. Army officers and was renowned for his hunting skills. He was intimately familiar with the terrain. Duran was the lead scout who led Chivington's forces to attack behind Confederate lines at the Battle of Glorieta Pass.<ref>This information is compiled from the oral history of the Duran family of New Mexico, recorded in 1976 by L J Bonney, Esq. and from documents of the era in possession of the Duran family. One such document was the Fort Union commander's written commendation thanking Duran for his service in the battle and naming him the most proficient scout for the Union Army in the New Mexico.\n*Note 1: Duran's family stated that he also voluntarily chose to join the war on the Union side because it included a war against Texas. Texas was considered enemy territory at this time by many native New Mexicans (Indio-Hispano and American Indian).\n*Note 2: Much native New Mexican history before 1900, both Indio-Hispano and American Indian, not related to Anglo events, is of an oral nature.</ref>\n\nParts of the battlefield are preserved in [[Pecos National Historical Park]].\n\n==Controversy==\nMany New Mexicans disputed the view that Chivington was the hero of Johnson's Ranch. Many Santa Fe residents credited James L. Collins, a [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] official, who had suggested the roundabout attack on the supply train. Chivington had actually been sent out in hopes of making a flank attack, and the discovery of the supply train was a lucky accident. He was also accused of almost letting the opportunity slip by him. On January 23, 1864, the New Mexico Territorial Legislature adopted a resolution that did not mention Chivington and instead asked [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] to promote William H. Lewis and Asa B. Carey, both regular army officers, for \"distinguished service\" in the battle. On March 8 the ''Rio Abajo Press'' of Albuquerque complained about \"Col. Chivington's strutting about in plumage stolen from Captain William H. Lewis\" (it did not mention Carey). According to the newspaper editor, \"Some one of the party\" suggested the attack, which Chivington only agreed to after \"two hours persuasion.\" Furthermore, Lewis had led the attack, while Chivington was \"viewing the scene from afar\".<ref>Keleher, pp. 180\u2013182.</ref>\n\nA more serious charge made against Chivington was that if he had hurried to reinforce Slough as soon as he heard gunfire coming from Pigeon's Ranch, his 400 men might have been enough to win the battle for the Federals, especially if he had attacked Scurry's flank as he had been ordered.<ref>One reason Chivington failed to come was due to an acoustic shadow that prevented him from hearing sounds from the battle. Whitlock, p. 205.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Glorieta Pass.png|thumb|right|Battle of Glorieta Pass marker at the Cuerno Verde Rest Area, Colorado.]]\nIn the end, the Battle of Glorieta Pass was consequential. First, despite the fact that the Confederates took the field, they were forced to retreat to Santa Fe due to the destruction of their supplies and eventually abandon New Mexico Territory.<ref>Frazier, p. 230.</ref> Second, the battle at Glorieta foiled Sibley's plan to obtain his key objective: the capture of the major federal base at Fort Union. That would have broken federal resistance in New Mexico and compelled Union forces to retire north of Raton Pass and back into Colorado Territory.<ref>Josephy, pp. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\nIn any case, the dream of a Confederate stronghold in the Southwest was impractical; New Mexico could not provide enough sustenance for any prolonged Confederate occupation.<ref>Whitlock, pp. 240\u2013241</ref> Furthermore, the approach of the Federal \"[[California Column]]\" eastward through the New Mexico Territory during the summer of 1862 would have seriously jeopardized Confederate control of the region.\n\n==Battlefield preservation==\n{{Main|Glorieta Pass Battlefield}}\n[[File:Battle of Glorieta Pass Battlefield.jpg|thumb|right|The battlefield in 2012.]]\n\nIn 1987 two Confederate burial sites were discovered at Pigeon's Ranch. One was the solitary grave of Maj. John Samuel Shropshire, the other was a mass grave of 30 Confederates. Only Shropshire and five others could be positively identified<ref>[http://www.lasvegasmuseum.org/pdf/Glorieta.pdf ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006082935/http://www.lasvegasmuseum.org/pdf/Glorieta.pdf |date=October 6, 2014 }}</ref> On August 5, 1990, Maj.

The Battle of Glorieta Pass received the highest rating from the commission, priority I (class A). Class A battlefields are principal strategic operations having a direct impact on the course of the war. With this rating the commission placed Glorieta Pass on the same level as battles such as [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] and [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]]. The priority I rating identified Glorieta Pass as being not only one of the most important, but also one of the most highly endangered battlefields in the country. Only ten other battlefields received the priority I (class A) rating. The commission recommended that Congress focus its preservation efforts on priority I, nationally significant battlefields.<ref>''Civil War Sites Advisory Commission Report on the Nation's Civil War Battlefields''.

Calas was a [[Protestant]] in an officially [[Catholic]] society. Doubts about his guilt were raised by opponents of the Catholic Church and he was exonerated in 1764. In France, he became a symbolic victim of [[religious intolerance]], along with [[Fran\u00e7ois-Jean de la Barre]] and [[Pierre-Paul Sirven]].\n\n==Background==\nCalas, along with his wife, was a Protestant. France was then a Catholic country. Catholicism was the [[state religion]], with no legal right for individuals to practice different faiths.
