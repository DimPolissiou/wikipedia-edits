The earliest reference in the Illio yearbook appears to be one mention in the summary of the 1907 football season. The term was more widely used in the 1910s especially during the 1914, 1915, and 1916 football seasons.

The earliest reference in the Illio yearbook appears to be one mention in the summary of the 1907 football season. The term was more widely used in the 1910s especially during the 1914, 1915, and 1916 football seasons. [[The Daily Illini]] and football programs prior to these dates do not extensively cite the term and also used the terms \"Indians,\" \"our men,\" \"Orange and Blue,\" and the \"homecomers\".<ref name=\"Fighting Illini Name FAQ\"/>\n\nThe term Fighting Illini first appeared in a January 29, 1911 newspaper article describing the basketball team's effort during a game versus Purdue. By March 3, 1911, the athletic teams appeared to have earned the Fighting Illini nickname as a formal appellation evidenced in a newspaper report. In 2005, evidence suggested Fighting Illini was first used in 1921 as part of a fundraising campaign for construction of [[Memorial Stadium (Champaign)|Memorial Stadium]], but articles discovered in 2013 show it was first used in 1911.<ref name=\"Fighting Illini Name\"/> The Fighting Illini nickname was adopted by general consensus as an unofficial school nickname sometime between 1921\u20131930.

It was released in April 2011 for [[Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]]. The digital PC version is distributed online by Valve's [[Steam (software)|Steam]] service, while all retail editions were distributed by [[Electronic Arts]].\n\nLike the original ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' (2007), players solve puzzles by placing portals and teleporting between them. ''Portal 2'' adds features including tractor beams, lasers, light bridges, and paint-like gels that alter player movement or allow portals to be placed on any surface. In the [[single-player]] campaign, players control [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], who navigates the dilapidated [[Aperture Science Laboratories|Aperture Science Enrichment Center]] during its reconstruction by the supercomputer [[GLaDOS]] ([[Ellen McLain]]); new characters include robot [[Wheatley (Portal)|Wheatley]] ([[Stephen Merchant]]) and Aperture founder [[Cave Johnson (Portal)|Cave Johnson]] ([[J. K. Simmons]]). In the new cooperative mode, players solve puzzles together as robots Atlas and P-Body (both voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]). [[Jonathan Coulton]] and [[The National (band)|The National]] produced songs for the game.\n\nValve announced ''Portal 2'' in March 2010, and promoted it with [[alternate reality game]]s including the [[Potato Sack]], a collaboration with several [[Independent video game development|independent game developers]]. After release, Valve released [[downloadable content]] and a simplified [[Level editor|map editor]] to allow players to create and share levels.\n\n''Portal 2'' received acclaim for its gameplay, balanced [[learning curve]], pacing, [[dark humor]], writing, and acting. It has been described as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]] by numerous publications and critics.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Portal physics-2.svg|thumb|''Portal 2'' challenges the player to use teleportation to traverse obstacle courses. The player's speed does not change upon passing through portals. In this example, the vertical velocity of the falling character is converted into horizontal velocity by the portal.|alt=A schematic of two platforms separated by a gap and by height. One portal opening is located at the bottom of the gap, the other on a wall high above the lower platform. A human figure is shown by a trajectory path to be able to jump from the lower platform into the bottom portal and exit the top portal to land on the higher platform.|left]]\n\n''Portal 2'' is a first-person perspective puzzle game. The player takes the role of [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]] in the [[single-player]] campaign, as one of two robots{{mdash}}Atlas and P-Body{{mdash}}in the cooperative campaign, or as a simplistic humanoid icon in community-developed puzzles. These three characters can explore and interact with the environment. Characters can withstand limited damage but will die after sustained injury. There is no penalty for falling onto a solid surface, but falling into bottomless pits or toxic pools kills the player character immediately. When Chell dies in the single-player game, the game restarts from a recent [[Checkpoint (video gaming)#Checkpoints|checkpoint]];<ref name=\"gi reveal\" /> in the cooperative game, the robot [[Spawning (video gaming)|respawns]] shortly afterwards without restarting the puzzle.<ref name=\"pcworld interview\" /> The goal of both campaigns is to explore the Aperture Science Laboratory\u2014a complicated, malleable mechanized maze. While most of the game takes place in modular test chambers with clearly defined entrances and exits, other parts occur in behind-the-scenes areas where the objective is less clear.\n\nThe initial tutorial levels guide the player through the general movement controls and illustrate how to interact with the environment. The player must solve puzzles using the 'portal gun' or 'Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device', which can create two portals connecting two distant surfaces depicted as matte white, continuous, and flat. Characters can use these portals to move between rooms or to \"fling\" objects or themselves across a distance. Outlines of placed portals are visible through walls and other obstacles for easy location.<ref name=\"cvg edge l4d\">{{cite web | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/288474/news/portal-2-influenced-by-left-4-dead-valve/ | title = Portal 2 influenced by Left 4 Dead \u2013 Valve | work = [[Computer and Video Games]] | date = February 11, 2011 | accessdate = February 11, 2011 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110213144938/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/288474/news/portal-2-influenced-by-left-4-dead-valve/ | archivedate = February 13, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph interview\">{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8359173/Portal-2-developer-interview-Chet-Falisek-and-Erik-Wolpaw.html | title = Portal 2 developer interview: Chet Falisek and Erik Wolpaw | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = March 4, 2011 | accessdate = March 4, 2011 | first = David | last = Brown | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110309212313/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8359173/Portal-2-developer-interview-Chet-Falisek-and-Erik-Wolpaw.html | archivedate = March 9, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nGame elements include Thermal Discouragement Beams ([[laser]]s), Excursion Funnels ([[tractor beam]]s), and Hard Light Bridges, all of which can be transmitted through portals.<ref name=\"gi reveal\" /><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/253854/news/two-more-portal-2-e3-gameplay-videos/ | title = Two more Portal 2 E3 gameplay videos | first = Mike | last = Jackson | date = June 29, 2010 | accessdate =July 1, 2010 | publisher = [[Computer and Video Games]]}}</ref><ref name=\"g4tv pax\" /><ref name=\"ign pax\">{{cite web | url= http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/111/1118382p1.html | title = Portal 2 Multiplayer Preview | first = Arthur | last = Gies | date =September 6, 2010 | accessdate =September 6, 2010 | publisher = IGN | archivedate=January 25, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125084337/http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/111/1118382p1.html}}</ref> Aerial Faith Plates launch the player or objects through the air and sometimes into portals.

It was released in April 2011 for [[Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]]. The digital PC version is distributed online by Valve's [[Steam (software)|Steam]] service, while all retail editions were distributed by [[Electronic Arts]].\n\nLike the original ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' (2007), players solve puzzles by placing portals and teleporting between them. ''Portal 2'' adds features including tractor beams, lasers, light bridges, and paint-like gels that alter player movement or allow portals to be placed on any surface. In the [[single-player]] campaign, players control [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], who navigates the dilapidated [[Aperture Science Laboratories|Aperture Science Enrichment Center]] during its reconstruction by the supercomputer [[GLaDOS]] ([[Ellen McLain]]); new characters include robot [[Wheatley (Portal)|Wheatley]] ([[Stephen Merchant]]) and Aperture founder [[Cave Johnson (Portal)|Cave Johnson]] ([[J. K. Simmons]]). In the new cooperative mode, players solve puzzles together as robots Atlas and P-Body (both voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]). [[Jonathan Coulton]] and [[The National (band)|The National]] produced songs for the game.\n\nValve announced ''Portal 2'' in March 2010, and promoted it with [[alternate reality game]]s including the [[Potato Sack]], a collaboration with several [[Independent video game development|independent game developers]]. After release, Valve released [[downloadable content]] and a simplified [[Level editor|map editor]] to allow players to create and share levels.\n\n''Portal 2'' received acclaim for its gameplay, balanced [[learning curve]], pacing, [[dark humor]], writing, and acting. It has been described as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]] by numerous publications and critics.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Portal physics-2.svg|thumb|''Portal 2'' challenges the player to use teleportation to traverse obstacle courses. The player's speed does not change upon passing through portals. In this example, the vertical velocity of the falling character is converted into horizontal velocity by the portal.|alt=A schematic of two platforms separated by a gap and by height. One portal opening is located at the bottom of the gap, the other on a wall high above the lower platform. A human figure is shown by a trajectory path to be able to jump from the lower platform into the bottom portal and exit the top portal to land on the higher platform.|left]]\n\n''Portal 2'' is a first-person perspective puzzle game. The player takes the role of [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]] in the [[single-player]] campaign, as one of two robots{{mdash}}Atlas and P-Body{{mdash}}in the cooperative campaign, or as a simplistic humanoid icon in community-developed puzzles. These three characters can explore and interact with the environment. Characters can withstand limited damage but will die after sustained injury. There is no penalty for falling onto a solid surface, but falling into bottomless pits or toxic pools kills the player character immediately. When Chell dies in the single-player game, the game restarts from a recent [[Checkpoint (video gaming)#Checkpoints|checkpoint]];<ref name=\"gi reveal\" /> in the cooperative game, the robot [[Spawning (video gaming)|respawns]] shortly afterwards without restarting the puzzle.<ref name=\"pcworld interview\" /> The goal of both campaigns is to explore the Aperture Science Laboratory\u2014a complicated, malleable mechanized maze. While most of the game takes place in modular test chambers with clearly defined entrances and exits, other parts occur in behind-the-scenes areas where the objective is less clear.\n\nThe initial tutorial levels guide the player through the general movement controls and illustrate how to interact with the environment. The player must solve puzzles using the 'portal gun' or 'Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device', which can create two portals connecting two distant surfaces depicted as matte white, continuous, and flat. Characters can use these portals to move between rooms or to \"fling\" objects or themselves across a distance. Outlines of placed portals are visible through walls and other obstacles for easy location.<ref name=\"cvg edge l4d\">{{cite web | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/288474/news/portal-2-influenced-by-left-4-dead-valve/ | title = Portal 2 influenced by Left 4 Dead \u2013 Valve | work = [[Computer and Video Games]] | date = February 11, 2011 | accessdate = February 11, 2011 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110213144938/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/288474/news/portal-2-influenced-by-left-4-dead-valve/ | archivedate = February 13, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph interview\">{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8359173/Portal-2-developer-interview-Chet-Falisek-and-Erik-Wolpaw.html | title = Portal 2 developer interview: Chet Falisek and Erik Wolpaw | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = March 4, 2011 | accessdate = March 4, 2011 | first = David | last = Brown | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110309212313/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8359173/Portal-2-developer-interview-Chet-Falisek-and-Erik-Wolpaw.html | archivedate = March 9, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nGame elements include Thermal Discouragement Beams ([[laser]]s), Excursion Funnels ([[tractor beam]]s), and Hard Light Bridges, all of which can be transmitted through portals.<ref name=\"gi reveal\" /><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/253854/news/two-more-portal-2-e3-gameplay-videos/ | title = Two more Portal 2 E3 gameplay videos | first = Mike | last = Jackson | date = June 29, 2010 | accessdate =July 1, 2010 | publisher = [[Computer and Video Games]]}}</ref><ref name=\"g4tv pax\" /><ref name=\"ign pax\">{{cite web | url= http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/111/1118382p1.html | title = Portal 2 Multiplayer Preview | first = Arthur | last = Gies | date =September 6, 2010 | accessdate =September 6, 2010 | publisher = IGN | archivedate=January 25, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125084337/http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/111/1118382p1.html}}</ref> Aerial Faith Plates launch the player or objects through the air and sometimes into portals.

announced on March 5, 2010, via ''[[Game Informer]]''. Events during the preceding week foreshadowed the announcement. On March 1, Valve released a patch for ''Portal'' that included a new achievement, \"Transmission Received\", requiring the player to manipulate in-game radios. This revealed new sound effects that became part of an [[alternate reality game]] (ARG).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/195026/anatomy_of_an_alternatereality_game.html | title = Anatomy of an Alternate-Reality Game | date = April 26, 2010 | accessdate = May 13, 2010 | publisher = [[GamePro]] | first = Alex | last = Wawro | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100501031529/http://www.pcworld.com/article/195026/anatomy_of_an_alternatereality_game.html | archivedate = May 1, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Some of the new effects were of [[Morse code]] strings that suggested GLaDOS was rebooting, while others could be decoded as [[Slow-scan television|SSTV]] images from grainy Aperture Science videos.

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|702|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|667|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|35|sqmi}} (5.0%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, part of north Florida's [[Red Hills Region]].

This library was the first and only public library in the city of Tallahassee until 1955.  The philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie offered the city of Tallahassee money to build a public library in 1906. According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee which only served the black community became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County.

Retrieved April 09, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum.

According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County.

In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N.
