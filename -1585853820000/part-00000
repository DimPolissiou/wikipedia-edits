In 1955, the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City's Broadway [[Theater District]] was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. When that venue was torn down in 1982, the nearby Little Theatre was renamed in her honor.

She said her stage debut was as a five-year-old singer at Washington's [[Lafayette Square Opera House|Belasco Theatre]], on Lafayette Square, across from the White House.<ref>Evely, Douglas E., Dickson, Paul, and Ackerman, S.J.[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DspYRi7G4C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2#v=onepage&q=%22Helen%20Hayes%22 \"The White House Neighborhood\"]''On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington D.C.''

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F.

She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.

In 1955, the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City's Broadway [[Theater District]] was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. When that venue was torn down in 1982, the nearby Little Theatre was renamed in her honor.

She said her stage debut was as a five-year-old singer at Washington's [[Lafayette Square Opera House|Belasco Theatre]], on Lafayette Square, across from the White House.<ref>Evely, Douglas E., Dickson, Paul, and Ackerman, S.J.[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DspYRi7G4C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2#v=onepage&q=%22Helen%20Hayes%22 \"The White House Neighborhood\"]''On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington D.C.''

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

She is one of those actors ... where to watch how she is doing something is almost as pleasurable as what she is doing.\"<ref>Barnes, Clive. \"Stage:Unseen White Rabbit Returns:James Stewart Stars in Phoenix's 'Harvey'\", ''The New York Times'', February 25, 1970, p.41</ref> She spent most of her last years writing and raising money for organizations that fight asthma.\n\n==Philanthropy==\n[[File:SHAKESPEARE CENTER DEDICATION HELEN HAYES 4 small.jpg|thumb|upright|Riverside Shakespeare Company Shakespeare Center Dedication with Helen Hayes, 1982.]]\nHayes was a generous donor of time and money to a number of causes and organizations, including the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]] of New York City. Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]], and was produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating.\n\n==Helen Hayes Hospital==\n[[File:Helen Hayes and young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Helen Hayes and a young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945]]\n\nAccording to her daughter-in-law, HB MacArthur, Hayes took the most pride in her philanthropic work with [[Helen Hayes Hospital]], a physical rehabilitation hospital located in [[West Haverstraw]], New York. She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.
