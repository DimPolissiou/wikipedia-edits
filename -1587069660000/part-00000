Skittles has hinted at new flavor releases on its Facebook page, using such statuses as \"Locking myself in the Rainbow kitchen until I see some results!\" A 2011 posting contained confirmation of a new flavor: \"Putting the last touches on a new Skittles flavor. Tweak the Rainbow.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/skittles/posts/119249298144659 |title=Putting the last... |author=Skittles |date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, in 2013, Skittles replaced the lime-flavored Skittles with green apple, causing a backlash from some consumers. The lime became part of their Darkside packets, which were discontinued in 2015 and followed up by their Orchards packets, which were then discontinued in 2017. Lime is now currently part of the \"Long Lost Lime\" packets that came out in summer 2017 and 2018.\n<gallery>\nFile:Skittles-Wrapper-Small.jpg|Skittles\nFile:Skittles-Tropical-Small.jpg|Tropical Skittles, one of the first variations available\nFile:Skittles-Wild-Berry-Wrapper-Small.jpg|Wild Berry Skittles, released in 1989\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Smarties (tablet candy)]]\n* [[Jelly beans]]\n*[[Skittles Commercial: The Broadway Musical]]\n*[[Mars, Incorporated]]\n* [[List of confectionery brands]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Skittles}}\n* [http://www.skittles.com/ Official U.S. website]\n\n{{Mars brands|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Skittles (Candy)}}\n[[Category:Mars confectionery brands]]\n[[Category:Wrigley Company brands]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:British confectionery]]\n", "name_user": "91.131.204.194", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skittles_(confectionery)"}

Pozzi tells how he just lost his net worth when the poker game he was playing at was robbed and he was beaten after the others suspected him of orchestrating the robbery. Now he cannot afford the minimum $10,000 buy-in to play a poker game with a pair of eccentric old millionaires whom he had previously beaten handily. With money and time to spare, the intrigued Nashe offers to back Pozzi with $10,000 for a rematch.\n\nThe wealthy men, Flower and Stone, live together on a huge estate. They willingly agree to another game, but are not the suckers Pozzi takes them for. They win again. Nashe puts up his car as collateral against the cash if Flower and Stone will cut cards, winner take all. Nashe loses.\n\nNo clear alternative exists except to work off the debt. The quirky Flower and Stone have a pile of 10,000 large stones, said to be from a 15th-century castle. They would like to build a wall on their property, so they tell Nashe and Pozzi that if they devote the next 50 days to erecting the wall, their debt will be paid.\n\nA foreman named Calvin Murks keeps an eye on the two men. Nashe methodically goes about his task, but Pozzi becomes increasingly unhinged, feeling like a slave. Pozzi takes offense at a snide remark by Murks and assaults him, whereupon Murks begins coming to work armed with a gun.\n\nPozzi attempts to escape. His badly beaten body is found. Nashe cannot be sure who did this, although Murks seems a likely suspect. Pozzi eventually disappears and Nashe fears that he is dead. He privately decides to get even, the best way he knows how.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Spader]] as Jack Pozzi\n* [[Mandy Patinkin]] as Jim Nashe\n* [[M.
