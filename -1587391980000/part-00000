Sex cord-stromal tumors  in prepubertal children may be manifested by [[precocious puberty|early puberty]]; abdominal pain and distension are also common.

Thus [[Nulliparity|not having children]] is a risk factor for ovarian cancer, likely because ovulation is suppressed via pregnancy.  During ovulation, cells are constantly stimulated to divide while ovulatory cycles continue.

Histologically, they are similar to intestinal or cervical adenocarcinomas and are often actually metastases of [[appendiceal cancer|appendiceal]] or [[colon cancer]]s. Advanced mucinous adenocarcinomas have a poor prognosis, generally worse than serous tumors, and are often resistant to platinum chemotherapy, though they are rare.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Pseudomyxoma peritonei ======\n{{Main|Pseudomyxoma peritonei}}\n\n''Pseudomyxoma peritonei'' refers to a collection of encapsulated mucous or gelatinous material in the abdominopelvic cavity, which is very rarely caused by a primary mucinous ovarian tumor. More commonly, it is associated with ovarian metastases of intestinal cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n===== Undifferentiated epithelial =====\nUndifferentiated cancers - those where the cell type cannot be determined - make up about 10% of epithelial ovarian cancers and have a comparatively poor prognosis.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> When examined under the microscope, these tumors have very abnormal cells that are arranged in clumps or sheets. Usually there are recognizable clumps of serous cells inside the tumor.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Malignant Brenner tumor ======\n{{Main|Brenner tumor}}\n\nMalignant Brenner tumors are rare. Histologically, they have dense fibrous stroma with areas of transitional epithelium, and some squamous differentiation. To be classified as a malignant Brenner tumor, it must have Brenner tumor foci and transitional cell carcinoma. The transitional cell carcinoma component is typically poorly differentiated and resembles urinary tract cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Transitional cell carcinoma ======\n{{Main|Transitional cell carcinoma}}\n\nTransitional cell carcinomas represent less than 5% of ovarian cancers.

Sex cord-stromal tumors are the main hormone-producing ovarian tumors.<ref name=\":8\">{{harvnb|Williams Gynecology|2012}}</ref>\n\nSeveral different cells from the [[mesenchyme]] can give rise to sex-cord or stromal tumors. These include [[fibroblast]]s and endocrine cells. The symptoms of a sex-cord or stromal ovarian tumor can differ from other types of ovarian cancer. Common signs and symptoms include [[ovarian torsion]], [[hemorrhage]] from or rupture of the tumor, an abdominal mass, and hormonal disruption. In children, [[precocious puberty#Isosexual and heterosexual|isosexual precocious pseudopuberty]] may occur with granulosa cell tumors since they produce estrogen. These tumors cause abnormalities in menstruation ([[menometrorrhagia|excessive bleeding]], [[oligomenorrhea|infrequent menstruation]], or [[amenorrhea|no menstruation]]) or postmenopausal bleeding. Because these tumors produce estrogen, they can cause or occur at the same time as [[endometrial cancer]] or [[breast cancer]]. Other sex-cord/stromal tumors present with distinct symptoms. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors cause [[virilization]] and [[hirsutism|excessive hair growth]] due to the production of [[testosterone]] and [[androstenedione]], which can also cause [[Cushing's syndrome]] in rare cases. Also, sex-cord stromal tumors occur that do not cause a hormonal imbalance, including benign fibromas, which cause ascites and [[hydrothorax]].<ref name=Harrisons/> With germ cell tumors, sex cord-stromal tumors are the most common ovarian cancer diagnosed in women under 20.<ref name=\":8\"/>\n\n===== Granulosa cell tumor =====\nGranulosa cell tumors are the most common sex-cord stromal tumors, making up 70% of cases, and are divided into two histologic subtypes: adult granulosa cell tumors, which develop in women over 50, and juvenile granulosa tumors, which develop before puberty or before the age of 30. Both develop in the [[ovarian follicle]] from a population of cells that surrounds [[germinal cell]]s.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n====== Adult granulosa cell tumor ======\nAdult granulosa cell tumors are characterized by later onset (30+ years, 50 on average). These tumors produce high levels of estrogen, which causes its characteristic symptoms: [[menometrorrhagia]]; [[endometrial hyperplasia]]; [[Breast pain|tender]], [[Breast enlargement|enlarged breasts]]; [[Vaginal bleeding|postmenopausal bleeding]]; and [[Amenorrhoea|secondary amenorrhea]]. The mass of the tumor can cause other symptoms, including abdominal pain and distension, or symptoms similar to an [[ectopic pregnancy]] if the tumor bleeds and ruptures.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n====== Juvenile granulosa cell tumor ======\n\n===== Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor =====\nSertoli-Leydig tumors are most common in women before the age of 30, and particularly common before puberty.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Sclerosing stromal tumors =====\nSclerosing stromal tumors  typically occur in girls before puberty or women before the age of 30.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Germ cell tumor ====\n{{Main|Ovarian germ cell tumors}}\nGerm cell tumors of the ovary develop from the ovarian [[germ cells]].<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Germ cell tumor]] accounts for about 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 5% of ovarian cancers, because most germ-cell tumors are [[teratoma]]s and most teratomas are benign.

Some germ-cell tumors have an [[isochromosome]] 12, where one arm of chromosome 12 is deleted and replaced with a duplicate of the other.<ref name=Harrisons/> Most germ-cell cancers have a better prognosis than other subtypes and are more sensitive to chemotherapy. They are more likely to be stage I at diagnosis.<ref name=\":8\" /> Overall, they metastasize more frequently than epithelial ovarian cancers. In addition, the cancer markers used vary with tumor type: [[choriocarcinomas]] are monitored with [[beta-HCG]] and endodermal sinus tumors with [[alpha-fetoprotein]].<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nGerm-cell tumors are typically discovered when they become large, palpable masses. However, like sex cord tumors, they can cause ovarian torsion or hemorrhage and, in children, isosexual precocious puberty. They frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes, especially para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes.<ref name=Harrisons/> The most common symptom of germ cell tumors is [[Abdominal pain|subacute abdominal pain]] caused by the tumor bleeding, [[Necrosis|necrotizing]], or stretching the [[ovarian capsule]]. If the tumor ruptures, causes significant bleeding, or torses the ovary, it can cause [[Acute abdomen|acute abdominal pain]], which occurs in less than 10% of those with germ-cell tumors. They can also secrete hormones which change the [[menstrual cycle]]. In 25% of germ-cell tumors, the cancer is discovered during a [[Well-woman examination|routine examination]] and does not cause symptoms.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nDiagnosing germ cell tumors may be difficult because the normal menstrual cycle and [[puberty]] can cause pain and pelvic symptoms, and a young woman may even believe these symptoms to be those of pregnancy, and not seek treatment due to the stigma of [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]]. Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, [[karyotype]], human chorionic gonadotropin, and liver function are used to diagnose germ cell tumor and potential co-occurring gonadal dysgenesis. A germ cell tumor may be initially mistaken for a benign [[ovarian cyst]].<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Dysgerminoma =====\n{{Main|Dysgerminoma}}\nDysgerminoma accounts for 35% of ovarian cancer in young women and is the most likely germ cell tumor to metastasize to the lymph nodes; nodal metastases occur in 25\u201330% of cases.<ref name=Current/><ref name=\":8\" /> These tumors may have mutations in [[CD117|the ''KIT'' gene]], a mutation known for its role in [[gastrointestinal stromal tumor]]. [[Swyer syndrome|People with an XY karyotype and ovaries]] ([[gonadal dysgenesis]]) or an X,0 karyotype and ovaries ([[Turner syndrome]]) who develop a unilateral dysgerminoma are at risk for a [[gonadoblastoma]] in the other ovary, and in this case, both ovaries are usually removed when a unilateral dysgerminoma is discovered to avoid the risk of another malignant tumor. Gonadoblastomas in people with Swyer or Turner syndrome become malignant in approximately 40% of cases. However, in general, dysgerminomas are bilateral 10\u201320% of the time.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThey are composed of cells that cannot [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] further and develop directly from germ cells or from gonadoblastomas. Dysgerminomas contain [[syncytiotrophoblast]]s in approximately 5% of cases, and can therefore cause elevated hCG levels. On gross appearance, dysgerminomas are typically pink to tan-colored, have multiple lobes, and are solid. Microscopically, they appear identical to [[seminoma]]s and very close to [[Embryonic germ cell|embryonic primordial germ cells]], having large, polyhedral, rounded [[clear cell]]s. The nuclei are uniform and round or square with prominent [[Nucleolus|nucleoli]] and the [[cytoplasm]] has high levels of [[glycogen]]. Inflammation is another prominent histologic feature of dysgerminomas.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Choriocarcinoma =====\n{{Main|Choriocarcinoma}}\nChoriocarcinoma can occur as a primary ovarian tumor developing from a germ cell, though it is usually a gestational disease that metastasizes to the ovary. Primary ovarian choriocarcinoma has  a poor prognosis and can occur without a pregnancy. They produce high levels of hCG and can cause [[Precocious puberty|early puberty]] in children or [[menometrorrhagia]] (irregular, heavy menstruation) after menarche.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Immature (solid) teratoma =====\n{{Main|Immature teratoma}}Immature, or solid, teratomas are the most common type of ovarian germ cell tumor, making up 40\u201350% of cases. Teratomas are characterized by the presence of disorganized tissues arising from all three embryonic [[germ layer]]s: [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]], and [[endoderm]]; immature teratomas also have undifferentiated [[stem cell]]s that make them more malignant than mature teratomas (dermoid cysts). The different tissues are visible on gross pathology and often include bone, cartilage, hair, [[mucus]], or [[Sebaceous gland|sebum]], but these tissues are not visible from the outside, which appears to be a solid mass with lobes and cysts. Histologically, they have large amounts of [[neuroectoderm]] organized into sheets and tubules along with [[Neuroglia|glia]]; the amount of neural tissue determines the histologic grade. Immature teratomas usually only affect one ovary (10% co-occur with dermoid cysts) and usually metastasize throughout the peritoneum. They can also cause mature teratoma implants to grow throughout the abdomen in a disease called [[growing teratoma syndrome]]; these are usually benign but will continue to grow during chemotherapy, and often necessitate further surgery. Unlike mature teratomas, immature teratomas form many [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]], making them less likely to cause ovarian torsion. There is no specific marker for immature teratomas, but [[carcinoembryonic antigen]] (CEA), CA-125, CA19-9, or AFP can sometimes indicate an immature teratoma.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nStage I teratomas make up the majority (75%) of cases and have the best prognosis, with 98% of patients surviving 5 years; if a Stage I tumor is also grade 1, it can be treated with unilateral surgery only. Stage II though IV tumors make up the remaining quarter of cases and have a worse prognosis,  with 73\u201388% of patients surviving 5 years.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Mature teratoma (dermoid cyst) =====\n{{Main|Dermoid cyst}}\nMature teratomas, or dermoid cysts, are rare tumors consisting of mostly benign tissue that develop after menopause. The tumors consist of disorganized tissue with nodules of malignant tissue, which can be of various types. The most common malignancy is [[Squamous-cell carcinoma|squamous cell carcinoma]], but [[adenocarcinoma]], [[basal-cell carcinoma]], [[Carcinoid|carcinoid tumor]], [[neuroectodermal tumor]], [[Melanoma|malignant melanoma]], [[sarcoma]], [[Sebaceous carcinoma|sebaceous tumor]], and [[struma ovarii]] can also be part of the dermoid cyst. They are treated with surgery and adjuvant platinum chemotherapy or radiation.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Yolk sac tumor/endodermal sinus tumor =====\n{{Main|Yolk sac tumor}}\n[[Yolk sac]] tumors, formerly called endodermal sinus tumors, make up approximately 10\u201320% of ovarian germ cell malignancies, and have the worst prognosis of all [[ovarian germ cell tumors]]. They occur both before menarche (in one-third of cases) and after menarche (the remaining two-thirds of cases). Half of the people with yolk sac tumors are diagnosed in stage I. Typically, they are unilateral until metastasis, which occurs within the peritoneal cavity and via the bloodstream to the lungs. Yolk sac tumors grow quickly and recur easily, and are not easily treatable once they have recurred. Stage I yolk sac tumors are highly treatable, with a 5-year disease-free survival rate of 93%, but stage II-IV tumors are less treatable, with survival rates of 64\u201391%.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nTheir gross appearance is solid, friable, and yellow, with necrotic and hemorrhagic areas. They also often contain cysts that can degenerate or rupture. Histologically, yolk sac tumors are characterized by the presence of [[Schiller\u2013Duval body|Schiller-Duval bodies]] (which are pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors) and a reticular pattern. Yolk sac tumors commonly secrete [[alpha-fetoprotein]] and can be [[Immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemically]] stained for its presence; the level of alpha-fetoprotein in the blood is a useful marker of recurrence.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Embryonal carcinoma =====\n{{Main|Embryonal carcinoma}}\nEmbryonal carcinomas, a rare tumor type usually found in mixed tumors, develop directly from germ cells but are not terminally differentiated; in rare cases they may develop in dysgenetic gonads. They can develop further into a variety of other neoplasms, including choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma. They occur in younger people, with an average age at diagnosis of 14, and secrete both alpha-fetoprotein (in 75% of cases) and hCG.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nHistologically, embryonal carcinoma appears similar to the [[embryonic disc]], made up of epithelial, [[Anaplasia|anaplastic]] cells in disorganized sheets, with gland-like spaces and papillary structures.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Polyembryoma =====\n{{Main|Polyembryoma}}\nPolyembryomas, the most immature form of teratoma and very rare ovarian tumors, are histologically characterized by having several [[embryo]]-like bodies with structures resembling a [[germ disk]], [[yolk sac]], and [[amniotic sac]]. [[Syncytiotrophoblast|Syncytiotrophoblast giant cells]] also occur in polyembryomas.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Squamous cell carcinoma ====\nPrimary ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are rare and have a poor prognosis when advanced. More typically, ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are cervical metastases, areas of differentiation in an endometrioid tumor, or derived from a mature teratoma.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n==== Mixed tumors ====\nMixed tumors contain elements of more than one of the above classes of tumor histology. To be classed as a mixed tumor, the minor type must make up more than 10% of the tumor.<ref name=\":7\" /> Though mixed carcinomas can have any combination of cell types, mixed ovarian cancers are typically serous/endometrioid or clear cell/endometrioid.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> Mixed germ cell tumors make up approximately 25\u201330% of all germ cell ovarian cancers, with combinations of dysgerminoma, yolk sac tumor, and/or immature teratoma. The prognosis and treatment vary based on the component cell types.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Secondary ovarian cancer ====\nOvarian cancer can also be a secondary cancer, the result of [[metastasis]] from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body.<ref name=Harrisons/> About 7% of ovarian cancers are due to metastases, while the rest are primary cancers.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Common primary cancers are [[breast cancer]], [[colon cancer]], [[appendiceal cancer]], and [[stomach cancer]] (primary gastric cancers that metastasize to the ovary are called [[Krukenberg tumor]]s).<ref name=Harrisons/> Krukenberg tumors have signet ring cells and mucinous cells.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> Endometrial cancer and lymphomas can also metastasize to the ovary.<ref name=Levy>{{Cite book|title = Premalignant & Malignant Disorders of the Ovaries & Oviducts|last = Levy|first = Gary | name-list-format = vanc |publisher = McGraw-Hill|year = 2013|last2 = Purcell|last3 = Karen|work = CURRENT Diagnosis & Treatment: Obstetrics & Gynecology, 11e| veditors = DeCherney AH, Nathan L, Laufer N, Roman AS |url = http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=498&sectionid=41008645|isbn = 978-0-07-163856-2|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170910175639/http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=498&sectionid=41008645|archivedate = 2017-09-10}}</ref>\n\n==== Borderline tumors====\nOvarian [[borderline tumor]]s, sometimes called low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, have some benign and some malignant features.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> LMP tumors make up approximately 10%-15% of all ovarian tumors.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> They develop earlier than epithelial ovarian cancer, around the age of 40\u201349. They typically do not have extensive invasion; 10% of LMP tumors have areas of stromal microinvasion (<3mm, <5% of tumor). LMP tumors have other abnormal features, including increased mitosis, [[pleomorphism (cytology)|changes in cell size or nucleus size]], [[nuclear atypia|abnormal nuclei]], cell stratification, and [[papillary projections|small projections on cells]] (papillary projections). Serous and/or mucinous characteristics can be seen on histological examination, and serous histology makes up the overwhelming majority of advanced LMP tumors. More than 80% of LMP tumors are Stage I; 15% are stage II and III and less than 5% are stage IV.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Implants of LMP tumors are often non-invasive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Staging ===\nOvarian cancer is staged using the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics|FIGO]] staging system and uses information obtained after surgery, which can include a total [[Hysterectomy|abdominal hysterectomy]] via [[Laparotomy|midline laparotomy]], [[Salpingoophorectomy|removal of (usually) both ovaries and Fallopian tubes]], [[Omentectomy|(usually) the omentum]], [[pelvic washing|pelvic (peritoneal) washing]]s, assessment of [[Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection|retroperitoneal lymph nodes]] (including the [[Pelvic lymph nodes|pelvic]] and [[Paraaortic lymph node|para-aortic lymph nodes]]), [[appendectomy]] in suspected mucinous tumors, and pelvic/peritoneal biopsies for [[cytopathology]].<ref name=Jayson/><ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=SGO/> Around 30% of ovarian cancers that appear confined to the ovary have metastasized microscopically, which is why even stage-I cancers must be staged completely.<ref name=Harrisons/> 22% of cancers presumed to be stage I are observed to have lymphatic metastases.<ref name=\":7\" /> The AJCC stage is the same as the FIGO stage.

Ovarian cancer metastases usually grow on the surface of organs rather than the inside; they are also common on the omentum and the peritoneal lining. Cancer cells can also travel through the [[lymphatic system]] and metastasize to lymph nodes connected to the ovaries via blood vessels; i.e. the lymph nodes along the [[Suspensory ligament of ovary|infundibulopelvic ligament]], the [[Broad ligament of the uterus|broad ligament]], and the [[Round ligament of uterus|round ligament]]. The most commonly affected groups include the [[paraaortic lymph node|paraaortic]], [[hypogastric lymph node|hypogastric]], [[external iliac lymph nodes|external iliac]], [[obturator lymph nodes|obturator]], and [[inguinal lymph node]]s. Usually, ovarian cancer does not metastasize to the liver, lung, brain, or kidneys unless it is recurrent disease; this differentiates ovarian cancer from many other forms of cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n== Screening ==\nThere is no simple and reliable way to test for ovarian cancer in women who do not have any signs or symptoms. Screening is not recommended in women who are at average risk, as evidence does not support a reduction in death and the high rate of false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery, which is accompanied by its own risks.<ref name=Gros2018/> The [[Pap test]] does not screen for ovarian cancer.<ref name = CDCsep2016/>\n\nOvarian cancer is usually only palpable in advanced stages.<ref name=Hoffman35/>  Screening is not recommended using [[CA-125]] measurements, [[HE4]] levels, ultrasound, or adnexal palpation in women who are at average risk.

Because ambiguous results are more likely than detection of a treatable problem, and because the usual response to ambiguous results is invasive interventions, in women of average risk, the potential harms of having screening without an indication outweigh the potential benefits. The purpose of screening is to diagnose ovarian cancer at an early stage, when it is more likely to be treated successfully.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Harrisons82/>\n\nScreening with [[transvaginal ultrasound]], pelvic examination, and CA-125 levels can be used instead of preventive surgery in women who have BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.

This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in people at high risk. Women with ''BRCA'' gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of [[Fallopian tube cancer]]. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Harrisons82/>\n\nPeople with a significant family history for ovarian cancer are often referred to a [[genetic counselor]] to see if  testing for BRCA mutations would be beneficial.<ref name=Hoffman35/> The use of oral contraceptives, the absence of 'periods' during the menstrual cycle, and tubal ligation reduce the risk.<ref name=\"CibulaWidschwendter2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cibula D, Widschwendter M, M\u00e1jek O, Dusek L | title = Tubal ligation and the risk of ovarian cancer: review and meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 55\u201367 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20634209 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq030 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\nThere may an association of developing ovarian cancer and ovarian stimulation during infertility treatments.

The surgery depends upon the extent of nearby invasion of other tissues by the cancer when it is diagnosed. This extent of the cancer is described by assigning it a stage, the presumed type, and the grade of cancer. The gynecological surgeon may  remove one (unilateral oophorectomy) or both ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy). The Fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), uterus (hysterectomy), and the [[Greater omentum|omentum]] (omentectomy) may also be removed. Typically, all of these organs are removed.<ref name=\"CanadianCS2017\" />\n\nFor low-grade, unilateral stage-IA cancers, only the involved ovary (which must be unruptured) and Fallopian tube will be removed. This can be done especially in young people who wish to preserve their fertility. However, a risk of microscopic metastases exists and staging must be completed.<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> If any metastases are found, a second surgery to remove the remaining ovary and uterus is needed.<ref name=\":2\" /> [[Tranexamic acid]] can be administered prior to surgery to reduce the need for blood transfusions due to blood loss during the surgery.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIf a tumor in a premenopausal woman is determined to be a low malignant potential tumor during surgery, and it is clearly stage I cancer, only the affected ovary is removed. For postmenopausal women with low malignant potential tumors, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is still the preferred option. During staging, the appendix can be examined or removed. This is particularly important with mucinous tumors.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> In children or adolescents with ovarian cancer, surgeons typically attempt to preserve one ovary to allow for the completion of [[puberty]], but if the cancer has spread, this is not always possible.

For stage I and II cancer, laparascopic (keyhole) surgery can be used, but metastases may not be found. For advanced cancer, laparoscopy is not used, since debulking metastases requires access to the entire peritoneal cavity. Depending on the extent of the cancer, procedures may include a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, biopsies throughout the peritoneum and abdominal lymphatic system, [[omentectomy]], [[splenectomy]], [[bowel resection]], [[Diaphragm resection|diaphragm stripping or resection]], [[appendectomy]], or even a posterior [[pelvic exenteration]].<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nTo fully stage ovarian cancer, [[lymphadenectomy]] can be included in the surgery, but a significant survival benefit to this practice may not happen.<ref name=Jayson/> This is particularly important in germ cell tumors because they frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes.<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nIf ovarian cancer recurs, secondary surgery is sometimes a treatment option.

Chemotherapy is used after surgery to treat any residual disease, if appropriate.  In some cases, there may be reason to perform chemotherapy first, followed by surgery.

It is disproportionately deadly because it lacks any clear early detection or screening test, meaning most cases are not diagnosed until they have reached advanced stages.<ref name=\"SGOfive\"/><ref name=Jayson/>\n\nOvarian cancer metastasizes early in its development, often before it has been diagnosed. High-grade tumors metastasize more readily than low-grade tumors. Typically, tumor cells begin to metastasize by growing in the peritoneal cavity.<ref name=Harrisons/> More than 60% of women presenting with ovarian cancer have stage-III or stage-IV cancer, when it has already spread beyond the ovaries. Ovarian cancers shed cells into the naturally occurring fluid within the abdominal cavity. These cells can then implant on other abdominal (peritoneal) structures, including the uterus, [[urinary bladder]], [[bowel]],  [[mesentery|lining of the bowel wall]], and [[Greater omentum|omentum]], forming new tumor growths before cancer is even suspected.\n\nThe five-year survival rate for all stages of ovarian cancer is 46%; the one-year survival rate is 72% and the ten-year survival rate is 35%.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Statistics and outlook for ovarian cancer|url = http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/treatment/statistics-and-outlook-for-ovarian-cancer|website = www.cancerresearchuk.org|accessdate = 2015-05-16|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150518192429/http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/treatment/statistics-and-outlook-for-ovarian-cancer|archivedate = 2015-05-18}}</ref> For cases where a diagnosis is made early in the disease, when the cancer is still confined to the primary site, the five-year survival rate is 92.7%.<ref name=\"SEER\">Survival rates based on SEER incidence and NCHS mortality statistics, as cited by the National Cancer Institute in [http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/ovary.html SEER Stat Fact Sheets&nbsp;\u2014 Cancer of the Ovary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706145616/http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/ovary.html |date=2014-07-06 }}</ref> About 70% of women with advanced disease respond to initial treatment, most of whom attain complete remission, but half of these women experience a recurrence 1\u20134 years after treatment.<ref name=Harrisons/> [[Brain metastasis]] is more common in stage III/IV cancer but can still occur in cancers staged at I/II. People with brain metastases survive a median of 8.2 months, though surgery, chemotherapy, and [[Whole brain radiotherapy|whole brain radiation therapy]] can improve survival.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nOvarian cancer survival varies significantly with subtype. Dysgerminomas have a very favorable prognosis. In early stages, they have a five-year survival rate of 96.9%.<ref name=Current/> Around two-thirds of dysgerminomas are diagnosed at stage I.<ref name=\":8\" /> Stage-III dysgerminomas have a five-year survival of 61%; when treated with BEP chemotherapy after incomplete surgical removal, dysgerminomas have a 95% two-year survival rate. Sex-cord-stromal malignancies also have a favorable prognosis; because they are slow-growing, even those with metastatic disease can survive a decade or more.<ref name=Harrisons/> Low malignant potential tumors usually only have a bad prognosis when there are invasive tumor implants found in the peritoneal cavity.<ref name=Hoffman35/>\n\nComplications of ovarian cancer can include spread of the cancer to other organs, progressive function loss of various organs, ascites, and intestinal obstructions, which can be fatal. Intestinal obstructions in multiple sites are the most common proximate cause of death.<ref name=Jayson/> Intestinal obstruction in ovarian cancer can either be a true obstruction, where tumor blocks the [[intestinal lumen]], or a pseudo-obstruction, when tumor prevents normal [[peristalsis]].<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Gucalp |first1 = Rasim |last2 = Dutcher |first2 = Janice | name-list-format = vanc |chapter = Oncologic Emergencies |veditors = Longo DL, Kasper DL, Jameson JL, Fauci AS, Hauser SL, Loscalzo J |title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |publisher = McGraw-Hill |year = 2012 |edition = 18th |isbn = 978-0-07-174889-6|title-link = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine }}</ref> Continuous accumulation of ascites can be treated by placing a drain that can be self-drained.<ref name=Jayson/>\n\n=== Prognostic factors ===\nThere are a number of [[prognostic factor]]s in ovarian cancer. Positive prognostic factors - those indicating better chances of survival - include no residual disease after surgery (stage III/IV), complete macroscopic resection (stage IV), BRCA2 mutations, young age (under 45 years), nonserous type, low histologic grade, early stage, co-occurrence with endometrial cancer, and low CA-125 levels. There is conflicting evidence for BRCA1 as a prognostic factor. Conversely, negative prognostic factors - those that indicate a worse chance of survival - include rupture of the ovarian capsule during surgery, older age (over 45 years), mucinous type, stage IV, high histologic grade, clear cell type, upper abdominal involvement, high CA-125 levels, the presence of tumor cells in the blood, and elevated [[Cyclooxygenase 2|cyclooxygenase-2]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nExpression of various mRNAs can also be prognostic for ovarian cancer. High levels of [[Drosha]] and [[Dicer]] are associated with improved survival, whereas high levels of [[let-7b]], [[HIF1A]], [[EPH receptor A1|EphA1]], and [[Poly ADP ribose polymerase|poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase]] are associated with worse survival. Cancers that are positive for [[WT1]] carry a worse prognosis; estrogen-receptor positive cancers have a better prognosis.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Survival rates ===\nOverall five-year survival rates for all types of ovarian cancer are presented below by stage and histologic grade:<ref name=Harrisons/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: center; margin-right: 10px;\"\n!

Overall, in a 5-year period, 20% of stage I and II cancers recur. Most recurrences are in the abdomen.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> If a recurrence occurs in advanced disease, it typically occurs within 18 months of initial treatment (18 months [[progression-free survival]]). Recurrences can be treated, but the disease-free interval tends to shorten and chemoresistance increases with each recurrence.<ref name=Jayson/> When a dysgerminoma recurs, it is most likely to recur within a year of diagnosis, and other malignant germ cell tumors recur within 2 years 90% of the time. Germ cell tumors other than dysgerminomas have a poor prognosis when they relapse, with a 10% long-term survival rate.<ref name=\":8\"/> Low malignant potential tumors rarely relapse, even when fertility-sparing surgery is the treatment of choice. 15% of LMP tumors relapse after unilateral surgery in the previously unaffected ovary, and they are typically easily treated with surgery. More advanced tumors may take up to 20 years to relapse, if they relapse at all, and are only treated with surgery unless the tumor has changed its histological characteristics or grown very quickly. In these cases, and when there is significant ascites, chemotherapy may also be used. Relapse is usually indicated by rising CA-125 levels and then progresses to symptomatic relapse within 2\u20136 months.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Recurrent sex cord-stromal tumors are typically unresponsive to treatment but not aggressive.<ref name=\":8\"/>\n\nIt is the most deadly gynecologic cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\">{{cite book |chapter = Epithelial Ovarian Cancer |pages = 853\u2013878 |title = Williams Gynecology |edition = 2nd |publisher = McGraw Hill Medical |first1 = Barbara L. |last1 = Hoffman |first2 = John O. |last2 = Schorge |first3 = Joseph I. |last3 = Schaffer |first4 = Lisa M. |last4 = Halvorson |first5 = Karen D. |last5 = Bradshaw |first6 = F.

One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to stage III (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage III. Another problem is that screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery.<ref name=Jayson/> The ROCA method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable screening method. It is also being investigated in normal-risk women as it has shown promise in the wider population.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with BRCA mutations.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Prognosis research===\nResearch into various [[prognostic factor]]s for ovarian cancer is also going on. Recent research shows that [[thrombocytosis]] predicts lower survival and higher stage cancer.<ref name=Jayson/> Ongoing research is also investigating the benefits of surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Immunotherapy===\nWhile an active area of research, as of 2018 there is no goodevidence that [[immunotherapy]] is effective for ovarian cancer.<ref name=\"pmid30199097\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Paijens ST, Leffers N, Daemen T, Helfrich W, Boezen HM, Cohlen BJ, Melief CJ, de Bruyn M, Nijman HW | title = Antigen-specific active immunotherapy for ovarian cancer | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = CD007287 | date = September 2018 | pmid = 30199097 | pmc = 6513204 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007287.pub4 }}</ref> However, trials of the antibody and [[VEGF]] inhibitor [[bevacizumab]], which can slow the [[angiogenesis|growth of new blood vessels]] in the cancer, have shown promising results, especially in combination with [[pazopanib]], which also slows the process of blood vessel growth. Bevacizumab has been particularly effective in preliminary studies on stage-III and -IV cancer<ref name=Jayson/> and has been cited as having at least a 15% response rate.<ref name=Harrisons/> It is being investigated particularly in mucinous ovarian cancers.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Pharmacology===\n[[mTOR inhibitor]]s were a highly investigated potential treatment in the 2000s and 2010s, but the side effects of these drugs (particularly [[hyperglycemia]] and [[hyperlipidemia]]) were not well tolerated and the survival benefit not confirmed. PI3 kinase inhibitors have been of interest, but they tend to be highly toxic and cause [[diarrhea]]. Another investigated drug is [[selumetinib]], a [[MAPK]] inhibitor. It improved survival, but did not correlate with any mutations found in tumors.<ref name=Jayson/>\n\nBevacizumab can also be combined with platinum chemotherapy, a combination that has had positive preliminary results in PFS, but equivocal results regarding overall survival. One disadvantage to these treatments is the side effect profile, which includes [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and [[proteinuria]]. The drug can also exacerbate bowel disease, leading to [[fistula]]e or [[bowel perforation]]. [[Vintafolide]], which consists of an [[antifolate]] conjugated with [[vinblastine]], is also in clinical trials; it may prove beneficial because [[folate receptor]]s are overexpressed in many ovarian cancers.<ref name=Jayson/> Another potential immunotherapy is [[trastuzumab]], which is active against tumors positive for Her2/neu mutations.<ref name=Harrisons/> Other angiogenesis inhibitors are also being investigated as potential ovarian cancer treatments. [[Combretastatin]] and [[pazopanib]] are being researched in combination for recurrent ovarian cancer. [[Trebananib]] and [[tasquinimod]] are other angiogenesis inhibitors being investigated. The [[monoclonal antibody]] [[farletuzumab]] is being researched as an adjuvant to traditional chemotherapy. Another type of immunotherapy involves [[vaccines]], including [[TroVax]].<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAn alternative to BEP chemotherapy, a regimen of 3 cycles of [[carboplatin]] and [[etoposide]], is a current topic of research for germ cell malignancies.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n[[Intraperitoneal chemotherapy]] has also been under investigation during the 2000s and 2010s for its potential to deliver higher doses of cytotoxic agent to tumors. Preliminary trials with cisplatin and paclitaxel have shown it is not well tolerated, but does improve survival, and more tolerable regimens are being researched.<ref name=Jayson/> Cisplatin and paclitaxel are both being researched as intraperitoneal chemotherapy agents. A specific chemotherapy regimen for rare clear-cell cancers is also under investigation: [[irinotecan]] combined with cisplatin.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[PARP inhibitor]]s have also shown promise in early trials, particularly in people with ''BRCA'' gene mutations, since the BRCA protein interacts with the PARP pathway. It is also being studied in recurrent ovarian cancer in general, where preliminary studies have shown longer PFS. Specifically, [[olaparib]] has shown greater survival compared to doxorubicin, though this treatment is still being investigated. It is not clear yet which [[biomarker]]s are predictive of responsiveness to PARP inhibitors.<ref name=Jayson/> [[Rucaparib]] is another PARP inhibitor being researched in BRCA-positive and BRCA-negative recurrent advanced ovarian cancer. [[Niraparib]] is a PARP inhibitor being tested in BRCA-positive recurrent ovarian cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[Tyrosine kinase inhibitors]] are another investigational drug class that may have applications in ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors in the [[receptor tyrosine kinase]] inhibitor group, including [[pazopanib]], [[cediranib]], and [[nintedanib]], have also been shown to increase progression free survival (PFS), but their benefit for overall survival has not been investigated as of 2015.<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> Preliminary research showed that cediranib combined with platins in recurrent ovarian cancer increased the time to second recurrence by 3\u20134 months and increased survival by 3 months.<ref name=\":6\" /> [[MK-1775]] is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is being used in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in platinum-sensitive cancers with p53 mutations. [[Nintedanib]] is being researched as a potential therapy in combination with cyclophosphamide for people with recurrences.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[Histone deacetylase inhibitor]]s (HDACi) are another area of research.\n\n===Hormones and radiation===\nHormone therapies are a topic of current research in ovarian cancer, particularly, the value of certain medications used to treat breast cancer. These include [[tamoxifen]], [[letrozole]], and [[anastrozole]]. Preliminary studies have showed a benefit for tamoxifen in a small number of people with advanced ovarian cancer. Letrozole may help to slow or stop growth of [[estrogen receptor]] positive ovarian cancer. Anastrozole is being investigated in postmenopausal people with estrogen receptor-positive cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nResearch into mitigating side effects of ovarian cancer treatment is also ongoing. [[Radiation fibrosis]], the formation of scar tissue in an area treated with radiation, may be relieved with [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen therapy]], but research has not been completed in this area. Treatment of ovarian cancer may also cause people to experience psychiatric difficulties, including [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Research is ongoing to determine how counseling and psychotherapy can help people who have ovarian cancer during treatment.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Inflammation===\n\nThere are some indications that pelvic inflammatory disease may be associated with ovarian cancer, especially in non-western countries. It may be due to the inflammatory process present with pelvic inflammatory disease.<ref name=\"IngerslevHogdall2017\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ingerslev K, Hogdall E, Schnack TH, Skovrider-Ruminski W, Hogdall C, Blaakaer J | title = The potential role of infectious agents and pelvic inflammatory disease in ovarian carcinogenesis | journal = Infectious Agents and Cancer | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 25 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28529540 | pmc = 5437405 | doi = 10.1186/s13027-017-0134-9 }}</ref>\n\n===Clinical trials===\n[[Clinical trial]]s are monitored and funded by US governmental organizations to test treatment options to see if they are safe and effective.

Thus [[Nulliparity|not having children]] is a risk factor for ovarian cancer, likely because ovulation is suppressed via pregnancy.  During ovulation, cells are constantly stimulated to divide while ovulatory cycles continue. Therefore, [[Nulliparity|people who have not borne children]] are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.

The risk of developing ovarian cancer is reduced in women who have had [[tubal ligation]] (colloquially known as having one's \"tubes tied\"), both ovaries removed, or [[hysterectomy]] (an operation in which the uterus, and sometimes the cervix, is removed).<ref name=\"CDCsep2016\" /> Age is also a risk factor.<ref name = Harrisons/><ref name=\"Gib2016\"/>\n\n=== Hormones ===\nUse of fertility medication may contribute to ovarian [[borderline tumor]] formation, but the link between the two is disputed and difficult to study.<ref name=Jayson/> Fertility drugs may be associated with a higher risk of borderline tumors.<ref name=\":7\" /> Those who have been treated for infertility but remain nulliparous are at higher risk for epithelial ovarian cancer; however, those who are successfully treated for infertility and subsequently give birth are at no higher risk.

People with [[hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer]] (Lynch syndrome), and those with BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genetic abnormalities are at increased risk.\n\nThe major genetic risk factor for ovarian cancer is a mutation in ''BRCA1'' or ''BRCA2'' genes, or in [[DNA mismatch repair]] genes, which is present in 10% of ovarian cancer cases. Only one [[allele]] need be mutated to place a person at high risk. The gene can be inherited through either the maternal or paternal line, but has variable [[penetrance]].<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Hoffman35/> Though mutations in these genes are usually associated with increased risk of breast cancer, they also carry a substantial lifetime risk of ovarian cancer, a risk that peaks in a person's 40s and 50s.

Usually, when cells grow old or get damaged, they [[apoptosis|die]], and new cells take their place. Cancer starts when new cells form unneeded, and old or damaged cells do not die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called an [[ovarian tumor]] or growth. These abnormal cancer cells have many [[genetic mutation|genetic abnormalities]] that cause them to grow excessively.<ref name=NCIGenetics>{{cite web |url = http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/genetics/breast-and-ovarian/HealthProfessional |title = Genetics of Breast and Ovarian Cancer (PDQ\u00ae) |date = 2 October 2014 |accessdate = 27 October 2014 |publisher = National Cancer Institute |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141022060353/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/genetics/breast-and-ovarian/HealthProfessional |archivedate = 22 October 2014 }}</ref> When an ovary [[ovulation|releases an egg]], the [[Ovarian follicle|egg follicle]] bursts open and becomes the [[corpus luteum]]. This structure needs to be repaired by dividing cells in the ovary.<ref name=CRUKRisks/> Continuous ovulation for a long time means more repair of the ovary by dividing cells, which can acquire mutations in each division.<ref name=Hoffman35/>\n\nOverall, the most common gene mutations in ovarian cancer occur in ''[[nuclear factor 1|NF1]], BRCA1, BRCA2, ''and ''[[CDK12]]''. Type I ovarian cancers, which tend to be less aggressive, tend to have [[microsatellite instability]] in several genes, including both oncogenes (most notably ''[[BRAF (gene)|BRAF]]''  and ''[[KRAS]]'') and tumor suppressors (most notably ''[[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]]'').<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> The most common mutations in Type I cancers are ''KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, PTEN, PIK3CA,'' and ''ARID1A.''<ref name=\":7\" /> Type II cancers, the more aggressive type, have different genes mutated, including ''[[p53]], BRCA1'', and ''BRCA2''.<ref name=Jayson/> Low-grade cancers tend to have mutations in KRAS, whereas cancers of any grade that develop from low malignant potential tumors tend to have mutations in p53.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Type I cancers tend to develop from precursor lesions, whereas Type II cancers can develop from a [[serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma]].<ref name=\":7\" /> [[Serous cancer]]s that have BRCA mutations also inevitably have p53 mutations, indicating that the removal of both functional genes is important for cancer to develop.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nIn 50% of high-grade serous cancers, homologous recombination DNA repair is dysfunctional, as are the [[notch signaling pathway|notch]] and [[FOXM1]] signaling pathways. They also almost always have p53 mutations. Other than this, mutations in high-grade serous carcinoma are hard to characterize beyond their high degree of [[genomic instability]]. ''BRCA1'' and ''BRCA2'' are essential for homologous recombination DNA repair, and [[germline mutation]]s in these genes are found in about 15% of people with ovarian cancer.<ref name=Jayson/> The most common mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the [[frameshift mutations]] that originated in a small [[founder effect|founding population]] of Ashkenazi Jews.<ref name=Hoffman35/>\n\nAlmost 100% of rare mucinous carcinomas have mutations in ''KRAS'' and amplifications of ''ERBB2'' (also known as ''Her2/neu'').<ref name=Jayson/> Overall, 20% of ovarian cancers have mutations in ''Her2/neu''.<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nSerous carcinomas may develop from [[serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma]], rather than developing spontaneously from ovarian tissue.

However, it may not detect smaller tumors. Sometimes, a [[Chest radiograph|chest x-ray]] is used to detect metastases in the chest or [[pleural effusion]]. Another test for metastatic disease, though it is infrequently used, is a [[barium enema]], which can show if the rectosigmoid colon is involved in the disease. [[Positron emission tomography]], [[bone scan]]s, and [[paracentesis]] are of limited use; in fact, paracentesis can cause metastases to form at the needle insertion site and may not provide useful results.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> However, paracentesis can be used in cases where there is no pelvic mass and ascites is still present.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> A physician suspecting ovarian cancer may also perform [[mammography]] or an [[endometrial biopsy]] (in the case of abnormal bleeding) to assess the possibility of breast malignancies and endometrial malignancy, respectively. [[Vaginal ultrasonography]] is often the first-line imaging study performed when an adnexal mass is found. Several characteristics of an adnexal mass indicate ovarian malignancy; they usually are solid, irregular, multilocular, and/or large; and they typically have papillary features, central vessels, and/or irregular internal septations.<ref name=\":7\" /> However, SCST has no definitive characteristics on radiographic study.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nTo definitively diagnose ovarian cancer, a surgical procedure to inspect the abdomen is required. This can be an open procedure ([[laparotomy]], incision through the [[abdominal wall]]) or [[keyhole surgery]] ([[laparoscopy]]). During this procedure, suspicious tissue is removed and sent for [[Histopathology|microscopic analysis]]. Usually, this includes a unilateral [[salpingo-oophorectomy]], removal of a single affected ovary and Fallopian tube. Fluid from the abdominal cavity can also be analyzed for cancerous [[Cell (biology)|cells]].

Sex cord-stromal tumors are the main hormone-producing ovarian tumors.<ref name=\":8\">{{harvnb|Williams Gynecology|2012}}</ref>\n\nSeveral different cells from the [[mesenchyme]] can give rise to sex-cord or stromal tumors. These include [[fibroblast]]s and endocrine cells. The symptoms of a sex-cord or stromal ovarian tumor can differ from other types of ovarian cancer. Common signs and symptoms include [[ovarian torsion]], [[hemorrhage]] from or rupture of the tumor, an abdominal mass, and hormonal disruption. In children, [[precocious puberty#Isosexual and heterosexual|isosexual precocious pseudopuberty]] may occur with granulosa cell tumors since they produce estrogen. These tumors cause abnormalities in menstruation ([[menometrorrhagia|excessive bleeding]], [[oligomenorrhea|infrequent menstruation]], or [[amenorrhea|no menstruation]]) or postmenopausal bleeding. Because these tumors produce estrogen, they can cause or occur at the same time as [[endometrial cancer]] or [[breast cancer]]. Other sex-cord/stromal tumors present with distinct symptoms. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors cause [[virilization]] and [[hirsutism|excessive hair growth]] due to the production of [[testosterone]] and [[androstenedione]], which can also cause [[Cushing's syndrome]] in rare cases. Also, sex-cord stromal tumors occur that do not cause a hormonal imbalance, including benign fibromas, which cause ascites and [[hydrothorax]].<ref name=Harrisons/> With germ cell tumors, sex cord-stromal tumors are the most common ovarian cancer diagnosed in women under 20.<ref name=\":8\"/>\n\n===== Granulosa cell tumor =====\nGranulosa cell tumors are the most common sex-cord stromal tumors, making up 70% of cases, and are divided into two histologic subtypes: adult granulosa cell tumors, which develop in women over 50, and juvenile granulosa tumors, which develop before puberty or before the age of 30. Both develop in the [[ovarian follicle]] from a population of cells that surrounds [[germinal cell]]s.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n====== Adult granulosa cell tumor ======\nAdult granulosa cell tumors are characterized by later onset (30+ years, 50 on average). These tumors produce high levels of estrogen, which causes its characteristic symptoms: [[menometrorrhagia]]; [[endometrial hyperplasia]]; [[Breast pain|tender]], [[Breast enlargement|enlarged breasts]]; [[Vaginal bleeding|postmenopausal bleeding]]; and [[Amenorrhoea|secondary amenorrhea]]. The mass of the tumor can cause other symptoms, including abdominal pain and distension, or symptoms similar to an [[ectopic pregnancy]] if the tumor bleeds and ruptures.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n====== Juvenile granulosa cell tumor ======\n\n===== Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor =====\nSertoli-Leydig tumors are most common in women before the age of 30, and particularly common before puberty.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Sclerosing stromal tumors =====\nSclerosing stromal tumors  typically occur in girls before puberty or women before the age of 30.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Germ cell tumor ====\n{{Main|Ovarian germ cell tumors}}\nGerm cell tumors of the ovary develop from the ovarian [[germ cells]].<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Germ cell tumor]] accounts for about 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 5% of ovarian cancers, because most germ-cell tumors are [[teratoma]]s and most teratomas are benign. Malignant teratomas tend to occur in older women, when one of the germ layers in the tumor develops into a [[squamous cell carcinoma]].<ref name=Harrisons/> Germ-cell tumors tend to occur in young women (20s\u201330s) and girls, making up 70% of the ovarian cancer seen in that age group.<ref name=Current>{{cite book |chapter = Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology |title = Current Diagnosis & Treatment Obstetrics & Gynecology |isbn = 978-0071638562  |edition = 11th |year = 2012 |first1 = Alan |last1 = DeCherney |first2 = Lauren |last2 = Nathan  |first3 = T.

Some germ-cell tumors have an [[isochromosome]] 12, where one arm of chromosome 12 is deleted and replaced with a duplicate of the other.<ref name=Harrisons/> Most germ-cell cancers have a better prognosis than other subtypes and are more sensitive to chemotherapy. They are more likely to be stage I at diagnosis.<ref name=\":8\" /> Overall, they metastasize more frequently than epithelial ovarian cancers. In addition, the cancer markers used vary with tumor type: [[choriocarcinomas]] are monitored with [[beta-HCG]] and endodermal sinus tumors with [[alpha-fetoprotein]].<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nGerm-cell tumors are typically discovered when they become large, palpable masses. However, like sex cord tumors, they can cause ovarian torsion or hemorrhage and, in children, isosexual precocious puberty. They frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes, especially para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes.<ref name=Harrisons/> The most common symptom of germ cell tumors is [[Abdominal pain|subacute abdominal pain]] caused by the tumor bleeding, [[Necrosis|necrotizing]], or stretching the [[ovarian capsule]]. If the tumor ruptures, causes significant bleeding, or torses the ovary, it can cause [[Acute abdomen|acute abdominal pain]], which occurs in less than 10% of those with germ-cell tumors. They can also secrete hormones which change the [[menstrual cycle]]. In 25% of germ-cell tumors, the cancer is discovered during a [[Well-woman examination|routine examination]] and does not cause symptoms.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nDiagnosing germ cell tumors may be difficult because the normal menstrual cycle and [[puberty]] can cause pain and pelvic symptoms, and a young woman may even believe these symptoms to be those of pregnancy, and not seek treatment due to the stigma of [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]]. Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, [[karyotype]], human chorionic gonadotropin, and liver function are used to diagnose germ cell tumor and potential co-occurring gonadal dysgenesis. A germ cell tumor may be initially mistaken for a benign [[ovarian cyst]].<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Dysgerminoma =====\n{{Main|Dysgerminoma}}\nDysgerminoma accounts for 35% of ovarian cancer in young women and is the most likely germ cell tumor to metastasize to the lymph nodes; nodal metastases occur in 25\u201330% of cases.<ref name=Current/><ref name=\":8\" /> These tumors may have mutations in [[CD117|the ''KIT'' gene]], a mutation known for its role in [[gastrointestinal stromal tumor]]. [[Swyer syndrome|People with an XY karyotype and ovaries]] ([[gonadal dysgenesis]]) or an X,0 karyotype and ovaries ([[Turner syndrome]]) who develop a unilateral dysgerminoma are at risk for a [[gonadoblastoma]] in the other ovary, and in this case, both ovaries are usually removed when a unilateral dysgerminoma is discovered to avoid the risk of another malignant tumor. Gonadoblastomas in people with Swyer or Turner syndrome become malignant in approximately 40% of cases. However, in general, dysgerminomas are bilateral 10\u201320% of the time.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThey are composed of cells that cannot [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] further and develop directly from germ cells or from gonadoblastomas. Dysgerminomas contain [[syncytiotrophoblast]]s in approximately 5% of cases, and can therefore cause elevated hCG levels. On gross appearance, dysgerminomas are typically pink to tan-colored, have multiple lobes, and are solid. Microscopically, they appear identical to [[seminoma]]s and very close to [[Embryonic germ cell|embryonic primordial germ cells]], having large, polyhedral, rounded [[clear cell]]s. The nuclei are uniform and round or square with prominent [[Nucleolus|nucleoli]] and the [[cytoplasm]] has high levels of [[glycogen]]. Inflammation is another prominent histologic feature of dysgerminomas.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Choriocarcinoma =====\n{{Main|Choriocarcinoma}}\nChoriocarcinoma can occur as a primary ovarian tumor developing from a germ cell, though it is usually a gestational disease that metastasizes to the ovary. Primary ovarian choriocarcinoma has  a poor prognosis and can occur without a pregnancy. They produce high levels of hCG and can cause [[Precocious puberty|early puberty]] in children or [[menometrorrhagia]] (irregular, heavy menstruation) after menarche.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Immature (solid) teratoma =====\n{{Main|Immature teratoma}}Immature, or solid, teratomas are the most common type of ovarian germ cell tumor, making up 40\u201350% of cases. Teratomas are characterized by the presence of disorganized tissues arising from all three embryonic [[germ layer]]s: [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]], and [[endoderm]]; immature teratomas also have undifferentiated [[stem cell]]s that make them more malignant than mature teratomas (dermoid cysts). The different tissues are visible on gross pathology and often include bone, cartilage, hair, [[mucus]], or [[Sebaceous gland|sebum]], but these tissues are not visible from the outside, which appears to be a solid mass with lobes and cysts. Histologically, they have large amounts of [[neuroectoderm]] organized into sheets and tubules along with [[Neuroglia|glia]]; the amount of neural tissue determines the histologic grade. Immature teratomas usually only affect one ovary (10% co-occur with dermoid cysts) and usually metastasize throughout the peritoneum. They can also cause mature teratoma implants to grow throughout the abdomen in a disease called [[growing teratoma syndrome]]; these are usually benign but will continue to grow during chemotherapy, and often necessitate further surgery. Unlike mature teratomas, immature teratomas form many [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]], making them less likely to cause ovarian torsion. There is no specific marker for immature teratomas, but [[carcinoembryonic antigen]] (CEA), CA-125, CA19-9, or AFP can sometimes indicate an immature teratoma.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nStage I teratomas make up the majority (75%) of cases and have the best prognosis, with 98% of patients surviving 5 years; if a Stage I tumor is also grade 1, it can be treated with unilateral surgery only. Stage II though IV tumors make up the remaining quarter of cases and have a worse prognosis,  with 73\u201388% of patients surviving 5 years.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Mature teratoma (dermoid cyst) =====\n{{Main|Dermoid cyst}}\nMature teratomas, or dermoid cysts, are rare tumors consisting of mostly benign tissue that develop after menopause. The tumors consist of disorganized tissue with nodules of malignant tissue, which can be of various types. The most common malignancy is [[Squamous-cell carcinoma|squamous cell carcinoma]], but [[adenocarcinoma]], [[basal-cell carcinoma]], [[Carcinoid|carcinoid tumor]], [[neuroectodermal tumor]], [[Melanoma|malignant melanoma]], [[sarcoma]], [[Sebaceous carcinoma|sebaceous tumor]], and [[struma ovarii]] can also be part of the dermoid cyst. They are treated with surgery and adjuvant platinum chemotherapy or radiation.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Yolk sac tumor/endodermal sinus tumor =====\n{{Main|Yolk sac tumor}}\n[[Yolk sac]] tumors, formerly called endodermal sinus tumors, make up approximately 10\u201320% of ovarian germ cell malignancies, and have the worst prognosis of all [[ovarian germ cell tumors]]. They occur both before menarche (in one-third of cases) and after menarche (the remaining two-thirds of cases). Half of the people with yolk sac tumors are diagnosed in stage I. Typically, they are unilateral until metastasis, which occurs within the peritoneal cavity and via the bloodstream to the lungs. Yolk sac tumors grow quickly and recur easily, and are not easily treatable once they have recurred. Stage I yolk sac tumors are highly treatable, with a 5-year disease-free survival rate of 93%, but stage II-IV tumors are less treatable, with survival rates of 64\u201391%.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nTheir gross appearance is solid, friable, and yellow, with necrotic and hemorrhagic areas. They also often contain cysts that can degenerate or rupture. Histologically, yolk sac tumors are characterized by the presence of [[Schiller\u2013Duval body|Schiller-Duval bodies]] (which are pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors) and a reticular pattern. Yolk sac tumors commonly secrete [[alpha-fetoprotein]] and can be [[Immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemically]] stained for its presence; the level of alpha-fetoprotein in the blood is a useful marker of recurrence.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Embryonal carcinoma =====\n{{Main|Embryonal carcinoma}}\nEmbryonal carcinomas, a rare tumor type usually found in mixed tumors, develop directly from germ cells but are not terminally differentiated; in rare cases they may develop in dysgenetic gonads. They can develop further into a variety of other neoplasms, including choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma. They occur in younger people, with an average age at diagnosis of 14, and secrete both alpha-fetoprotein (in 75% of cases) and hCG.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nHistologically, embryonal carcinoma appears similar to the [[embryonic disc]], made up of epithelial, [[Anaplasia|anaplastic]] cells in disorganized sheets, with gland-like spaces and papillary structures.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Polyembryoma =====\n{{Main|Polyembryoma}}\nPolyembryomas, the most immature form of teratoma and very rare ovarian tumors, are histologically characterized by having several [[embryo]]-like bodies with structures resembling a [[germ disk]], [[yolk sac]], and [[amniotic sac]]. [[Syncytiotrophoblast|Syncytiotrophoblast giant cells]] also occur in polyembryomas.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Squamous cell carcinoma ====\nPrimary ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are rare and have a poor prognosis when advanced. More typically, ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are cervical metastases, areas of differentiation in an endometrioid tumor, or derived from a mature teratoma.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n==== Mixed tumors ====\nMixed tumors contain elements of more than one of the above classes of tumor histology. To be classed as a mixed tumor, the minor type must make up more than 10% of the tumor.<ref name=\":7\" /> Though mixed carcinomas can have any combination of cell types, mixed ovarian cancers are typically serous/endometrioid or clear cell/endometrioid.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> Mixed germ cell tumors make up approximately 25\u201330% of all germ cell ovarian cancers, with combinations of dysgerminoma, yolk sac tumor, and/or immature teratoma. The prognosis and treatment vary based on the component cell types.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Secondary ovarian cancer ====\nOvarian cancer can also be a secondary cancer, the result of [[metastasis]] from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body.<ref name=Harrisons/> About 7% of ovarian cancers are due to metastases, while the rest are primary cancers.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Common primary cancers are [[breast cancer]], [[colon cancer]], [[appendiceal cancer]], and [[stomach cancer]] (primary gastric cancers that metastasize to the ovary are called [[Krukenberg tumor]]s).<ref name=Harrisons/> Krukenberg tumors have signet ring cells and mucinous cells.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> Endometrial cancer and lymphomas can also metastasize to the ovary.<ref name=Levy>{{Cite book|title = Premalignant & Malignant Disorders of the Ovaries & Oviducts|last = Levy|first = Gary | name-list-format = vanc |publisher = McGraw-Hill|year = 2013|last2 = Purcell|last3 = Karen|work = CURRENT Diagnosis & Treatment: Obstetrics & Gynecology, 11e| veditors = DeCherney AH, Nathan L, Laufer N, Roman AS |url = http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=498&sectionid=41008645|isbn = 978-0-07-163856-2|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170910175639/http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=498&sectionid=41008645|archivedate = 2017-09-10}}</ref>\n\n==== Borderline tumors====\nOvarian [[borderline tumor]]s, sometimes called low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, have some benign and some malignant features.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> LMP tumors make up approximately 10%-15% of all ovarian tumors.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> They develop earlier than epithelial ovarian cancer, around the age of 40\u201349. They typically do not have extensive invasion; 10% of LMP tumors have areas of stromal microinvasion (<3mm, <5% of tumor). LMP tumors have other abnormal features, including increased mitosis, [[pleomorphism (cytology)|changes in cell size or nucleus size]], [[nuclear atypia|abnormal nuclei]], cell stratification, and [[papillary projections|small projections on cells]] (papillary projections). Serous and/or mucinous characteristics can be seen on histological examination, and serous histology makes up the overwhelming majority of advanced LMP tumors. More than 80% of LMP tumors are Stage I; 15% are stage II and III and less than 5% are stage IV.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Implants of LMP tumors are often non-invasive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Staging ===\nOvarian cancer is staged using the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics|FIGO]] staging system and uses information obtained after surgery, which can include a total [[Hysterectomy|abdominal hysterectomy]] via [[Laparotomy|midline laparotomy]], [[Salpingoophorectomy|removal of (usually) both ovaries and Fallopian tubes]], [[Omentectomy|(usually) the omentum]], [[pelvic washing|pelvic (peritoneal) washing]]s, assessment of [[Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection|retroperitoneal lymph nodes]] (including the [[Pelvic lymph nodes|pelvic]] and [[Paraaortic lymph node|para-aortic lymph nodes]]), [[appendectomy]] in suspected mucinous tumors, and pelvic/peritoneal biopsies for [[cytopathology]].<ref name=Jayson/><ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=SGO/> Around 30% of ovarian cancers that appear confined to the ovary have metastasized microscopically, which is why even stage-I cancers must be staged completely.<ref name=Harrisons/> 22% of cancers presumed to be stage I are observed to have lymphatic metastases.<ref name=\":7\" /> The AJCC stage is the same as the FIGO stage.

Ovarian cancer metastases usually grow on the surface of organs rather than the inside; they are also common on the omentum and the peritoneal lining. Cancer cells can also travel through the [[lymphatic system]] and metastasize to lymph nodes connected to the ovaries via blood vessels; i.e. the lymph nodes along the [[Suspensory ligament of ovary|infundibulopelvic ligament]], the [[Broad ligament of the uterus|broad ligament]], and the [[Round ligament of uterus|round ligament]]. The most commonly affected groups include the [[paraaortic lymph node|paraaortic]], [[hypogastric lymph node|hypogastric]], [[external iliac lymph nodes|external iliac]], [[obturator lymph nodes|obturator]], and [[inguinal lymph node]]s. Usually, ovarian cancer does not metastasize to the liver, lung, brain, or kidneys unless it is recurrent disease; this differentiates ovarian cancer from many other forms of cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n== Screening ==\nThere is no simple and reliable way to test for ovarian cancer in women who do not have any signs or symptoms. Screening is not recommended in women who are at average risk, as evidence does not support a reduction in death and the high rate of false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery, which is accompanied by its own risks.<ref name=Gros2018/> The [[Pap test]] does not screen for ovarian cancer.<ref name = CDCsep2016/>\n\nOvarian cancer is usually only palpable in advanced stages.<ref name=Hoffman35/>  Screening is not recommended using [[CA-125]] measurements, [[HE4]] levels, ultrasound, or adnexal palpation in women who are at average risk. Risk of developing ovarian cancer in those with genetic factors can be reduced. Those with a genetic predisposition may benefit from screening. This high risk group has benefited with earlier detection.<ref name=Jayson/><ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Harrisons82>{{cite book |last1 = Croswell |first1 = Jennifer M. |last2 = Brawley |first2 = Otis W. |last3 = Kramer |first3 = Barnett S. | name-list-format = vanc |chapter = Prevention and Early Detection of Cancer |veditors = Longo DL, Kasper DL, Jameson JL, Fauci AS, Hauser SL, Loscalzo J |title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |publisher = McGraw-Hill |year = 2012 |edition = 18th |isbn = 978-0-07-174889-6|title-link = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine }}</ref>\n\nOvarian cancer has low prevalence, even in the high-risk group of women from the ages of 50 to 60 (about one in 2000), and screening of women with average risk is more likely to give ambiguous results than detect a problem which requires treatment. Because ambiguous results are more likely than detection of a treatable problem, and because the usual response to ambiguous results is invasive interventions, in women of average risk, the potential harms of having screening without an indication outweigh the potential benefits. The purpose of screening is to diagnose ovarian cancer at an early stage, when it is more likely to be treated successfully.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Harrisons82/>\n\nScreening with [[transvaginal ultrasound]], pelvic examination, and CA-125 levels can be used instead of preventive surgery in women who have BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. This strategy has shown some success.<ref name=Hoffman35/>\n\n== Prevention==\nPeople with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure.

The surgery depends upon the extent of nearby invasion of other tissues by the cancer when it is diagnosed. This extent of the cancer is described by assigning it a stage, the presumed type, and the grade of cancer. The gynecological surgeon may  remove one (unilateral oophorectomy) or both ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy). The Fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), uterus (hysterectomy), and the [[Greater omentum|omentum]] (omentectomy) may also be removed. Typically, all of these organs are removed.<ref name=\"CanadianCS2017\" />\n\nFor low-grade, unilateral stage-IA cancers, only the involved ovary (which must be unruptured) and Fallopian tube will be removed. This can be done especially in young people who wish to preserve their fertility. However, a risk of microscopic metastases exists and staging must be completed.<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> If any metastases are found, a second surgery to remove the remaining ovary and uterus is needed.<ref name=\":2\" /> [[Tranexamic acid]] can be administered prior to surgery to reduce the need for blood transfusions due to blood loss during the surgery.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIf a tumor in a premenopausal woman is determined to be a low malignant potential tumor during surgery, and it is clearly stage I cancer, only the affected ovary is removed. For postmenopausal women with low malignant potential tumors, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is still the preferred option. During staging, the appendix can be examined or removed. This is particularly important with mucinous tumors.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> In children or adolescents with ovarian cancer, surgeons typically attempt to preserve one ovary to allow for the completion of [[puberty]], but if the cancer has spread, this is not always possible. Dysgerminomas, in particular, tend to affect both ovaries: 8\u201315% of dysgerminomas are present in both ovaries.<ref name=\"Current\" /> People with low-grade (well-differentiated) tumors are typically treated only with surgery,<ref name=\"Harrisons\" /> which is often curative.<ref name=\":1\" /> In general, germ cell tumors can be treated with unilateral surgery unless the cancer is widespread or fertility is not a factor.<ref name=\":8\" /> In women with surgically staged advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (stages III and IV), studies suggest all attempts should be made to reach complete cytoreduction (surgical efforts to remove the bulk of the tumor).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Elattar|first=Ahmed|last2=Bryant|first2=Andrew|last3=Winter-Roach|first3=Brett A|last4=Hatem|first4=Mohamed|last5=Naik|first5=Raj|date=2011-08-10|title=Optimal primary surgical treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=8|pages=CD007565|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd007565.pub2|issn=1465-1858|pmc=6457688|pmid=21833960}}</ref>\n\nIn advanced cancers, where complete removal is not an option, as much tumor as possible is removed in a procedure called [[debulking]] surgery.

For stage I and II cancer, laparascopic (keyhole) surgery can be used, but metastases may not be found. For advanced cancer, laparoscopy is not used, since debulking metastases requires access to the entire peritoneal cavity. Depending on the extent of the cancer, procedures may include a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, biopsies throughout the peritoneum and abdominal lymphatic system, [[omentectomy]], [[splenectomy]], [[bowel resection]], [[Diaphragm resection|diaphragm stripping or resection]], [[appendectomy]], or even a posterior [[pelvic exenteration]].<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nTo fully stage ovarian cancer, [[lymphadenectomy]] can be included in the surgery, but a significant survival benefit to this practice may not happen.<ref name=Jayson/> This is particularly important in germ cell tumors because they frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes.<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nIf ovarian cancer recurs, secondary surgery is sometimes a treatment option.

Interventions are available to help with the needs and social support. Many ovarian cancer survivors report a good quality of life and [[optimism]]. Others reported a \"spiritual change\" that helped them find [[Meaning of life|meaning]] during their experience. Others have described their loss of faith after their diagnosis with ovarian cancer.

It is disproportionately deadly because it lacks any clear early detection or screening test, meaning most cases are not diagnosed until they have reached advanced stages.<ref name=\"SGOfive\"/><ref name=Jayson/>\n\nOvarian cancer metastasizes early in its development, often before it has been diagnosed. High-grade tumors metastasize more readily than low-grade tumors. Typically, tumor cells begin to metastasize by growing in the peritoneal cavity.<ref name=Harrisons/> More than 60% of women presenting with ovarian cancer have stage-III or stage-IV cancer, when it has already spread beyond the ovaries. Ovarian cancers shed cells into the naturally occurring fluid within the abdominal cavity. These cells can then implant on other abdominal (peritoneal) structures, including the uterus, [[urinary bladder]], [[bowel]],  [[mesentery|lining of the bowel wall]], and [[Greater omentum|omentum]], forming new tumor growths before cancer is even suspected.\n\nThe five-year survival rate for all stages of ovarian cancer is 46%; the one-year survival rate is 72% and the ten-year survival rate is 35%.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Statistics and outlook for ovarian cancer|url = http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/treatment/statistics-and-outlook-for-ovarian-cancer|website = www.cancerresearchuk.org|accessdate = 2015-05-16|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150518192429/http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/treatment/statistics-and-outlook-for-ovarian-cancer|archivedate = 2015-05-18}}</ref> For cases where a diagnosis is made early in the disease, when the cancer is still confined to the primary site, the five-year survival rate is 92.7%.<ref name=\"SEER\">Survival rates based on SEER incidence and NCHS mortality statistics, as cited by the National Cancer Institute in [http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/ovary.html SEER Stat Fact Sheets&nbsp;\u2014 Cancer of the Ovary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706145616/http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/ovary.html |date=2014-07-06 }}</ref> About 70% of women with advanced disease respond to initial treatment, most of whom attain complete remission, but half of these women experience a recurrence 1\u20134 years after treatment.<ref name=Harrisons/> [[Brain metastasis]] is more common in stage III/IV cancer but can still occur in cancers staged at I/II. People with brain metastases survive a median of 8.2 months, though surgery, chemotherapy, and [[Whole brain radiotherapy|whole brain radiation therapy]] can improve survival.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nOvarian cancer survival varies significantly with subtype. Dysgerminomas have a very favorable prognosis. In early stages, they have a five-year survival rate of 96.9%.<ref name=Current/> Around two-thirds of dysgerminomas are diagnosed at stage I.<ref name=\":8\" /> Stage-III dysgerminomas have a five-year survival of 61%; when treated with BEP chemotherapy after incomplete surgical removal, dysgerminomas have a 95% two-year survival rate. Sex-cord-stromal malignancies also have a favorable prognosis; because they are slow-growing, even those with metastatic disease can survive a decade or more.<ref name=Harrisons/> Low malignant potential tumors usually only have a bad prognosis when there are invasive tumor implants found in the peritoneal cavity.<ref name=Hoffman35/>\n\nComplications of ovarian cancer can include spread of the cancer to other organs, progressive function loss of various organs, ascites, and intestinal obstructions, which can be fatal. Intestinal obstructions in multiple sites are the most common proximate cause of death.<ref name=Jayson/> Intestinal obstruction in ovarian cancer can either be a true obstruction, where tumor blocks the [[intestinal lumen]], or a pseudo-obstruction, when tumor prevents normal [[peristalsis]].<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Gucalp |first1 = Rasim |last2 = Dutcher |first2 = Janice | name-list-format = vanc |chapter = Oncologic Emergencies |veditors = Longo DL, Kasper DL, Jameson JL, Fauci AS, Hauser SL, Loscalzo J |title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |publisher = McGraw-Hill |year = 2012 |edition = 18th |isbn = 978-0-07-174889-6|title-link = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine }}</ref> Continuous accumulation of ascites can be treated by placing a drain that can be self-drained.<ref name=Jayson/>\n\n=== Prognostic factors ===\nThere are a number of [[prognostic factor]]s in ovarian cancer. Positive prognostic factors - those indicating better chances of survival - include no residual disease after surgery (stage III/IV), complete macroscopic resection (stage IV), BRCA2 mutations, young age (under 45 years), nonserous type, low histologic grade, early stage, co-occurrence with endometrial cancer, and low CA-125 levels. There is conflicting evidence for BRCA1 as a prognostic factor. Conversely, negative prognostic factors - those that indicate a worse chance of survival - include rupture of the ovarian capsule during surgery, older age (over 45 years), mucinous type, stage IV, high histologic grade, clear cell type, upper abdominal involvement, high CA-125 levels, the presence of tumor cells in the blood, and elevated [[Cyclooxygenase 2|cyclooxygenase-2]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nExpression of various mRNAs can also be prognostic for ovarian cancer. High levels of [[Drosha]] and [[Dicer]] are associated with improved survival, whereas high levels of [[let-7b]], [[HIF1A]], [[EPH receptor A1|EphA1]], and [[Poly ADP ribose polymerase|poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase]] are associated with worse survival. Cancers that are positive for [[WT1]] carry a worse prognosis; estrogen-receptor positive cancers have a better prognosis.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Survival rates ===\nOverall five-year survival rates for all types of ovarian cancer are presented below by stage and histologic grade:<ref name=Harrisons/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: center; margin-right: 10px;\"\n!

Overall, in a 5-year period, 20% of stage I and II cancers recur. Most recurrences are in the abdomen.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> If a recurrence occurs in advanced disease, it typically occurs within 18 months of initial treatment (18 months [[progression-free survival]]). Recurrences can be treated, but the disease-free interval tends to shorten and chemoresistance increases with each recurrence.<ref name=Jayson/> When a dysgerminoma recurs, it is most likely to recur within a year of diagnosis, and other malignant germ cell tumors recur within 2 years 90% of the time. Germ cell tumors other than dysgerminomas have a poor prognosis when they relapse, with a 10% long-term survival rate.<ref name=\":8\"/> Low malignant potential tumors rarely relapse, even when fertility-sparing surgery is the treatment of choice. 15% of LMP tumors relapse after unilateral surgery in the previously unaffected ovary, and they are typically easily treated with surgery. More advanced tumors may take up to 20 years to relapse, if they relapse at all, and are only treated with surgery unless the tumor has changed its histological characteristics or grown very quickly. In these cases, and when there is significant ascites, chemotherapy may also be used. Relapse is usually indicated by rising CA-125 levels and then progresses to symptomatic relapse within 2\u20136 months.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Recurrent sex cord-stromal tumors are typically unresponsive to treatment but not aggressive.<ref name=\":8\"/>\n\nIt is the most deadly gynecologic cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\">{{cite book |chapter = Epithelial Ovarian Cancer |pages = 853\u2013878 |title = Williams Gynecology |edition = 2nd |publisher = McGraw Hill Medical |first1 = Barbara L. |last1 = Hoffman |first2 = John O. |last2 = Schorge |first3 = Joseph I. |last3 = Schaffer |first4 = Lisa M. |last4 = Halvorson |first5 = Karen D. |last5 = Bradshaw |first6 = F.

One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to stage III (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage III. Another problem is that screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery.<ref name=Jayson/> The ROCA method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable screening method.

Recent research shows that [[thrombocytosis]] predicts lower survival and higher stage cancer.<ref name=Jayson/> Ongoing research is also investigating the benefits of surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Immunotherapy===\nWhile an active area of research, as of 2018 there is no goodevidence that [[immunotherapy]] is effective for ovarian cancer.<ref name=\"pmid30199097\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Paijens ST, Leffers N, Daemen T, Helfrich W, Boezen HM, Cohlen BJ, Melief CJ, de Bruyn M, Nijman HW | title = Antigen-specific active immunotherapy for ovarian cancer | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = CD007287 | date = September 2018 | pmid = 30199097 | pmc = 6513204 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007287.pub4 }}</ref> However, trials of the antibody and [[VEGF]] inhibitor [[bevacizumab]], which can slow the [[angiogenesis|growth of new blood vessels]] in the cancer, have shown promising results, especially in combination with [[pazopanib]], which also slows the process of blood vessel growth. Bevacizumab has been particularly effective in preliminary studies on stage-III and -IV cancer<ref name=Jayson/> and has been cited as having at least a 15% response rate.<ref name=Harrisons/> It is being investigated particularly in mucinous ovarian cancers.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Pharmacology===\n[[mTOR inhibitor]]s were a highly investigated potential treatment in the 2000s and 2010s, but the side effects of these drugs (particularly [[hyperglycemia]] and [[hyperlipidemia]]) were not well tolerated and the survival benefit not confirmed. PI3 kinase inhibitors have been of interest, but they tend to be highly toxic and cause [[diarrhea]]. Another investigated drug is [[selumetinib]], a [[MAPK]] inhibitor. It improved survival, but did not correlate with any mutations found in tumors.<ref name=Jayson/>\n\nBevacizumab can also be combined with platinum chemotherapy, a combination that has had positive preliminary results in PFS, but equivocal results regarding overall survival. One disadvantage to these treatments is the side effect profile, which includes [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and [[proteinuria]]. The drug can also exacerbate bowel disease, leading to [[fistula]]e or [[bowel perforation]]. [[Vintafolide]], which consists of an [[antifolate]] conjugated with [[vinblastine]], is also in clinical trials; it may prove beneficial because [[folate receptor]]s are overexpressed in many ovarian cancers.<ref name=Jayson/> Another potential immunotherapy is [[trastuzumab]], which is active against tumors positive for Her2/neu mutations.<ref name=Harrisons/> Other angiogenesis inhibitors are also being investigated as potential ovarian cancer treatments. [[Combretastatin]] and [[pazopanib]] are being researched in combination for recurrent ovarian cancer. [[Trebananib]] and [[tasquinimod]] are other angiogenesis inhibitors being investigated. The [[monoclonal antibody]] [[farletuzumab]] is being researched as an adjuvant to traditional chemotherapy. Another type of immunotherapy involves [[vaccines]], including [[TroVax]].<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAn alternative to BEP chemotherapy, a regimen of 3 cycles of [[carboplatin]] and [[etoposide]], is a current topic of research for germ cell malignancies.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n[[Intraperitoneal chemotherapy]] has also been under investigation during the 2000s and 2010s for its potential to deliver higher doses of cytotoxic agent to tumors. Preliminary trials with cisplatin and paclitaxel have shown it is not well tolerated, but does improve survival, and more tolerable regimens are being researched.<ref name=Jayson/> Cisplatin and paclitaxel are both being researched as intraperitoneal chemotherapy agents. A specific chemotherapy regimen for rare clear-cell cancers is also under investigation: [[irinotecan]] combined with cisplatin.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[PARP inhibitor]]s have also shown promise in early trials, particularly in people with ''BRCA'' gene mutations, since the BRCA protein interacts with the PARP pathway. It is also being studied in recurrent ovarian cancer in general, where preliminary studies have shown longer PFS. Specifically, [[olaparib]] has shown greater survival compared to doxorubicin, though this treatment is still being investigated. It is not clear yet which [[biomarker]]s are predictive of responsiveness to PARP inhibitors.<ref name=Jayson/> [[Rucaparib]] is another PARP inhibitor being researched in BRCA-positive and BRCA-negative recurrent advanced ovarian cancer. [[Niraparib]] is a PARP inhibitor being tested in BRCA-positive recurrent ovarian cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[Tyrosine kinase inhibitors]] are another investigational drug class that may have applications in ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors in the [[receptor tyrosine kinase]] inhibitor group, including [[pazopanib]], [[cediranib]], and [[nintedanib]], have also been shown to increase progression free survival (PFS), but their benefit for overall survival has not been investigated as of 2015.<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> Preliminary research showed that cediranib combined with platins in recurrent ovarian cancer increased the time to second recurrence by 3\u20134 months and increased survival by 3 months.<ref name=\":6\" /> [[MK-1775]] is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is being used in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in platinum-sensitive cancers with p53 mutations. [[Nintedanib]] is being researched as a potential therapy in combination with cyclophosphamide for people with recurrences.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[Histone deacetylase inhibitor]]s (HDACi) are another area of research.\n\n===Hormones and radiation===\nHormone therapies are a topic of current research in ovarian cancer, particularly, the value of certain medications used to treat breast cancer. These include [[tamoxifen]], [[letrozole]], and [[anastrozole]]. Preliminary studies have showed a benefit for tamoxifen in a small number of people with advanced ovarian cancer. Letrozole may help to slow or stop growth of [[estrogen receptor]] positive ovarian cancer. Anastrozole is being investigated in postmenopausal people with estrogen receptor-positive cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nResearch into mitigating side effects of ovarian cancer treatment is also ongoing. [[Radiation fibrosis]], the formation of scar tissue in an area treated with radiation, may be relieved with [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen therapy]], but research has not been completed in this area. Treatment of ovarian cancer may also cause people to experience psychiatric difficulties, including [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Research is ongoing to determine how counseling and psychotherapy can help people who have ovarian cancer during treatment.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Inflammation===\n\nThere are some indications that pelvic inflammatory disease may be associated with ovarian cancer, especially in non-western countries.

Lawyer with a BA in [[law]] from the [[Federal University of Bahia]] in 1955 and a Doctor of Law from the [[University of Paris]] in 1957, he was a professor at the institution where he graduated. A civil construction and communications entrepreneur, he joined ARENA<ref>National Renovating Alliance</ref> and was elected [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|federal deputy]] in 1966; however, little exercised his mandate for having assumed the Secretariat of Municipal Affairs and Urban Services when his father ruled Bahia (1967\u20131971). Director of the Bank of the State of Bahia in the first government [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Magalh\u00e3es]] was elected federal deputy in 1974 and was chosen vice-governor of the state when Magalh\u00e3es returned to the Palace of Ondina on the [[Recommendation]] of President [[Ernesto Geisel]] in 1978.
