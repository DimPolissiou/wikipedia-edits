In 1754, when control of the area was still in dispute between France and Great Britain, 22-year-old [[George Washington]] fought against the [[France|French]] at the [[Battle of Jumonville Glen]] and [[Fort Necessity]]. British forces under Washington and General [[Edward Braddock]] improved roads throughout the region, making the future Fayette County an important supply route.\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], Fayette County was plagued by attacks from British-allied Indians and remained isolated as a frontier region. Also retarding settlement was a border dispute with Virginia; Virginia's [[District of West Augusta]] and Pennsylvania's [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]] both claimed the area. In 1780 the dispute was settled by the federal government in favor of Pennsylvania, and Fayette County was formed from Westmoreland County in 1783.\n\nFayette County settlers provided the new United States government with an early test of authority in the 1793 [[Whiskey Rebellion]], when farmers rebelled against tax collectors to protest a new liquor tax. President George Washington called out the militias to restore order. However, they were talked out of any violent action by owner of [[Friendship Hill]] and future Secretary of the Treasury, [[Albert Gallatin]]. Fayette County continued to be important to travelers in the early 1800s. The [[National Road]] provided a route through the mountains of the county for settlers heading west. The shipyards in [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania|Brownsville]] on the [[Monongahela River]] built ships for both the domestic and international trade.\n\nAs [[Pittsburgh]] developed its industries in the mid-19th century, Fayette County become a center of [[coal mining]] and [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] production. From the 1880s to the early 1900s, the area's great expansion in [[steel]] production became nationally important, and labor unions shaped national policies. Both new European immigrants and [[African Americans]] in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the rural South were attracted to the Pittsburgh area for industrial jobs. The historic Scottish and German farming communities established in the earlier 19th century were soon overshadowed by the wave of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. The region's wealth has been concentrated largely among the old English and Scottish families who had established businesses and political power in Pittsburgh prior to and in the advent of industrialization, often building the new manufacturing concerns, as did [[Andrew Carnegie]].\n\nBy [[World War II]], Fayette County had a new unionized working class that enjoyed increased prosperity. In the 1950s, however, the coal industry fell into decline. In the 1970s, the restructuring and collapse of American steel resulted in a massive loss of industrial jobs and hard times in the area. The population has declined since the peak in 1940, as residents have had to move elsewhere for work. The loss of union jobs caused many working families to drop out of the middle class. Only a few mines are being worked in the 21st century, but natural resources remain crucial to the local economy. The region is slowly transitioning toward the service sector, with an increase in jobs in fields such as telemarketing.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|798|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|790|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|8.0|sqmi}} (1.0%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_42.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=March 5, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref> The western portion of the county contains rolling foothills and two valleys along the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] and [[Youghiogheny River|Youghiogheny]] rivers.

In 1754, when control of the area was still in dispute between France and Great Britain, 22-year-old [[George Washington]] fought against the [[France|French]] at the [[Battle of Jumonville Glen]] and [[Fort Necessity]]. British forces under Washington and General [[Edward Braddock]] improved roads throughout the region, making the future Fayette County an important supply route.\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], Fayette County was plagued by attacks from British-allied Indians and remained isolated as a frontier region. Also retarding settlement was a border dispute with Virginia; Virginia's [[District of West Augusta]] and Pennsylvania's [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]] both claimed the area. In 1780 the dispute was settled by the federal government in favor of Pennsylvania, and Fayette County was formed from Westmoreland County in 1783.\n\nFayette County settlers provided the new United States government with an early test of authority in the 1793 [[Whiskey Rebellion]], when farmers rebelled against tax collectors to protest a new liquor tax. President George Washington called out the militias to restore order. However, they were talked out of any violent action by owner of [[Friendship Hill]] and future Secretary of the Treasury, [[Albert Gallatin]]. Fayette County continued to be important to travelers in the early 1800s. The [[National Road]] provided a route through the mountains of the county for settlers heading west. The shipyards in [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania|Brownsville]] on the [[Monongahela River]] built ships for both the domestic and international trade.\n\nAs [[Pittsburgh]] developed its industries in the mid-19th century, Fayette County become a center of [[coal mining]] and [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] production. From the 1880s to the early 1900s, the area's great expansion in [[steel]] production became nationally important, and labor unions shaped national policies. Both new European immigrants and [[African Americans]] in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the rural South were attracted to the Pittsburgh area for industrial jobs. The historic Scottish and German farming communities established in the earlier 19th century were soon overshadowed by the wave of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. The region's wealth has been concentrated largely among the old English and Scottish families who had established businesses and political power in Pittsburgh prior to and in the advent of industrialization, often building the new manufacturing concerns, as did [[Andrew Carnegie]].\n\nBy [[World War II]], Fayette County had a new unionized working class that enjoyed increased prosperity. In the 1950s, however, the coal industry fell into decline. In the 1970s, the restructuring and collapse of American steel resulted in a massive loss of industrial jobs and hard times in the area. The population has declined since the peak in 1940, as residents have had to move elsewhere for work. The loss of union jobs caused many working families to drop out of the middle class. Only a few mines are being worked in the 21st century, but natural resources remain crucial to the local economy. The region is slowly transitioning toward the service sector, with an increase in jobs in fields such as telemarketing.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|798|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|790|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|8.0|sqmi}} (1.0%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_42.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=March 5, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref> The western portion of the county contains rolling foothills and two valleys along the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] and [[Youghiogheny River|Youghiogheny]] rivers.

{"title_page": "Digital divide by country", "text_new": "{{Internet|expanded=General}}\nThe '''[[digital divide]]''' is an [[economic inequality|economic]] and [[social inequality]] with regard to access to, use of, or impact of [[information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICT).<ref name=\"NTIA95\">U.S. Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). (1995). ''Falling through the net: A survey of the ''have nots'' in rural and urban America''. Retrieved from, http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fallingthru.html.</ref> Factors causing the divide can vary depending on the country and culture, as can the potential solutions for minimizing or closing the divide.\n\nThe following is a list of countries that have a digital divide along with contributing factors and steps the country is taking to resolve the issue.\n\n== Argentina ==\n{{see also|Internet in Argentina}}\n\nThe availability and access to the Internet in Argentina shows how the trends of a digital divide stay constant, even across different countries and cultures. Age is one of the main factors, and Argentina's statistics show a common disparity between ages. According to TNS Infratest, the age group with the highest rate of daily internet users in 2016 were users under 25. 91% of that age demographic were polled as being daily internet users. In contrast, the age group with the lowest rate were users over 55, with only 68% of that demographic being daily internet users.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/339986/daily-internet-usage-age-group-argentina/|title=Daily internet usage in Argentina by age group 2016 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}</ref> The older one is, the less likely they are to use Internet, and these statistics reflect that. The way that users are able to access the Internet can also show the status of Internet and how easily one can utilize it. In Argentina, 48% of users preferred to use a smartphone or tablet to a computer, 29% used them equally, and 16% preferred a computer to a smartphone or tablet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/370255/preferred-devices-for-internet-access-argentina/|title=Preferred devices for internet access in Argentina 2016 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}</ref>\n\n===Education ===\nThe quality of life in Argentina is one of the highest in South and Latin America, according to InterNations. The children are well educated in school, and they are given numerous opportunities to pursue afterwards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.internations.org/argentina-expats/guide/living-in-argentina-15328/education-in-argentina-3|title=Education in Argentina|website=www.internations.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-06}}</ref> The Government created a project named \"Conectar Igualdad\" (Connecting Equality) where they distribute netbooks to students and teachers in primary school, special needs schools, and state institutes. Since the project began nearly 4,000,000 netbooks have been dispersed amongst them to 400 different schools and 7,500 different teachers. The program works in three parts: an internet connection to Wi-Fi, an established internet connection through a reliable network (giving students Internet access anywhere, even at home), and making use of a syntonizer for Digital TV, allowing students access to interactive live programs. In 2011, the Government launched another program named \"Escuelas de Innovacion\" (Schools of Innovation). The main goal is to guarantee students better access to education and technology.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://globalstatement.wordpress.com/2014/09/22/argentina-projects-encouraging-digital-education/|title=Argentina: Projects encouraging digital education|date=2014-09-22|work=Global Statement: A blog of the Swiss ERI-Network|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}</ref> The Government of Argentina creates new and innovative projects each year for students and teachers to have greater access to the Internet. It plays an important role in their education and is a great opportunity for students and teachers to close the gap in the digital divide.\n\n== Africa ==\nThe digital divide is generally wider in Sub-Saharan Africa, as those countries experience widespread poverty. There are reportedly only 7% of the continent's inhabitants that are online. However, mobile phone usage is shockingly high at 72%. Only 18% of these phones are smartphones. The lack of Internet usage can partially be attributed to the fact that the most common language used on the Internet is English. However, it can also be attributed to the fact that the literacy rate in African countries is not very high.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jan/24/digital-divide-access-to-information-africa|title=Access to information: Bridging the digital divide in Africa|last1=Treisman|first1=Loren|date=2014-01-24|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> To combat the digital divide in Africa, economists have suggested stimulating the economy of the region. Bridging the digital divide was a major concern of those at the [[International Telecommunication Union]] Telecoms World conference in Durban, South Africa. The forum stressed the need for African governments to key into ITU's initiative for Africa, which emphasized infrastructure, investment, innovation and inclusivity. Furthermore, entrepreneurs were encouraged to address the specific challenges that Africans face in regards to accessing the Internet.\n\nIn a study conducted in 2011, they estimate that internet access is only available to roughly fourteen percent of the African population.<sup>[[Internet in Africa#cite note-8|[2]]]</sup> This means that while the world's population is only composed of fifteen percent of Africans, around six percent of that subscribe to the internet. <sup>[[Internet in Africa#cite note-WorldStats-9|[3]]]</sup>\n\n=== Poverty and Poor Infrastructure in Africa ===\nEven though technology has become more and more affordable, there is still a disparage between poor people's access to Internet and wealthy people's access to Internet. This becomes an issue once children begin school, as kids who are in low income school systems do not have access to technology in which they are not granted technical skills to develop to continue their education and later translate those skills to the workplace.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalresponsibility.org/digital-divide-the-technology-gap-between-rich-and-poor/|title=Digital Divide: The Technology Gap between the Rich and Poor}}</ref> This low level of computer literacy can be attributed to poor infrastructure and high costs to stay connected. In 2000, the entirety of Sub Saharan Africa had less telephone lines than Manhattan as a whole.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe poor infrastructure in Africa makes it much more difficult for economic development because countries are unable to develop technologically. Particularly, landlocked countries face major difficulties due to the fact that there are rarely any port cities in these countries, not giving them much trade power. It is estimated that investment in better roads increased investment in telecommunications would help further develop the infrastructure in the continent. Furthermore, the differentiating languages between the existing countries and pre-existing differences between different cultures provides a barrier to Inter-Continental development.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n=== Internet Access ===\nAccording to 2011 estimates, about 13.5% of the African population has Internet access [[Internet in Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Africa accounts for 15% of the World population, but only 6.2% of the world's population is African.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} However, these statistics are skewed due to the fact that most of these Internet users come from South Africa, a country that has a much better infrastructure than the rest of the continent. The rest is mainly distributed among Morocco and Egypt, both countries that have better infrastructures than the majority of the countries in Africa, yet not as strong as that of South Africa. There have been many initiatives in the U.S. to push for better infrastructure which would eventually lead to better Internet access in Africa.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n== Bangladesh ==\n{{see also|Internet in Bangladesh}}\n\nThe digital divide in Bangladesh is a gap in the population of Arshads who can access [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] ([[Information and communications technology|ICTs]]) and those without proper access or skills.<ref name=\"Rahman\">{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Anisur|date=Fall 2017|title=Access to Global Information - A case of Digital Divide in Bangladesh|url=http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1819&context=iatul|journal=Information Development|volume= 32| issue = 1|pages= 5\u201319|via=EBSCOhost|doi=10.1177/0266666913518445}}</ref>\n\n=== Government and Community ===\n{{Main|Government of Bangladesh}}\n\nInformation and communication technologies use in Bangladesh began to grow in 2005 with the introduction of [[Free trade|market liberalization]].<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Rashid|first=Ahmed Tareq|date=Winter 2017|title=Inclusive Capitalism and Development: Case Studies of Telecenters Fostering Inclusion through ICTs in Bangladesh|url=http://www.itidjournal.org/index.php/itid/article/view/1427|journal=Information Technologies & International Development|volume= 13|pages= 14|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref>\n\nThe government has been trying to help increase ICT availability to all Bangladeshis by reducing taxes on the [[Very-small-aperture terminal|VSAT]] and creating special projects to support the spread of ICTs.<ref name=\"Rahman\" /> In 2006 the largest mobile phone company in Bangladesh, GrameenPhone Ltd, introduced Community Information Centers (CICs), which are each equipped with two computers, printers, digital cameras and web cameras that can be used by the community.<ref name=\":4\" /> \"There are over 500 CICs operating in 450 subdistricts in Bangladesh\".<ref name=\":4\" /> Within the community, there is research suggesting that men benefit more from ICTs than women due to Bangladesh's gender discrimination.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Hossain|first=Sarah|last2=Beresford|first2=Melanie|date=Winter 2012|title=Paving the pathway for women's empowerment?

The main lapse of technology and information lies in the physical access realm of things, where it is lacking tremendously. Though Internet in Colombia has made progress compared to recent years, the scholary part of how ICTs are used are still in question. With this being said, government officials have made certain that access to ICTs be a priority in their country. In addition to physical access, literature review and types of internet use have also been main points of focus in regards to a solution for digital divide in Colombia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Velasquez|first1=Alcides|title=Digital Divide in Colombia: The Role of Motivational and Material Access in the Use and Types of Use of ICTs|journal=International Journal of Communication|date=2013|volume=7|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/download/2180/969|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Types of Internet Use (ICT) ===\nThere is a difference between material or physical access and actual use of ICTs. \"According to Hargittai (2008),\ndifferences in the uses of ICTs have important implications for life outcomes\". \"Rojas and Puig-i-abril (2009) found that the most prevalent activities of Internet users in Colombia were checking e-mail, consuming entertainment content, chatting with friends, and consuming news and information.\" There are different levels of \"use\" including, non-use, low use, and frequent use while also taking into consideration the opportunities taken by the users. There is a difference in those who go online just for fun and those who use the internet for the improvement of themselves. \n(International Journal of Communication (19328036)) (Digital Divide in Colombia: The Role of Motivational and Material Access in the Use and Types of Use of ICTs).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Velasquez|first1=Alcides|date=2013|title=Digital Divide in Colombia: The Role of Motivational and Material Access in the Use and Types of Use of ICTs|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=6&sid=f151dc7b-5ad1-4f82-9162-8ebbbbc6f443%40sessionmgr101&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=ufh&AN=99140318|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=7|pages=1768\u20131783}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical Access ===\nOne digital divide study displayed physical access as \"having\"/\"not having\" access to the internet. Those who are less fortunate have been shown to lack educational advantage, due to the fact of not having access to internet as common as those who are more fortunate in wealth. Communities that are more technological advanced offers their communities to expand their knowledge and be able to communicate with other worlds. The intellectual advantage is common for countries, such as Colombia, where the poor communities are lacking the opportunities offered to those who are on the other side of town with more advantage. Poor communities are focusing on trying to make ends meet, and working hard labor without being offered to make a change to better themselves. The internet plays an important role in this, due to the fact that the internet provides opportunities to explore new jobs and to widen individuals' knowledge. In certain areas where the communities are wealthy, the internet is provided at the access of their hands. Being able to access the internet so easily, gives privileged individuals the chance to go beyond their expectations and get their point out into the world.\n\n=== Causes of the Digital Divide in Colombia ===\nThere is no singular cause of the Digital Divide in Colombia. A number of different factors each contribute to the variance of access to technology within Colombia. These factors include location, economic class, education, and others.\n\nIn Colombia, those located in large cities are 69% more likely to use the Internet.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Velasquez|first=Alcides|date=January 2013|title=Digital Divide in Colombia|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=6&sid=aa35d002-0e64-4818-aae4-32e576e1d4cb@sessionmgr4007|journal=International Journal of Communication (19328036)|volume=1768|pages=1772\u20131776|via=Discovery}}</ref> The high correlation between the use of ICTs and location in large industrial cities is one of the most visible examples of digital divide in Colombia. People located in rural parts of Colombia are significantly less likely to use ICTs and the internet regularly for various reasons. One leading cause is simply because people living in rural parts of the country tend to be less educated which is negatively correlated with technology use. The pastoral parts of Colombia are often much less developed than the large cities. Often, these rustic areas lack the technology and internet providers needed to further bridge the digital divide between large and small cities. A study of the Digital Divide in Colombia concerning residency included a population in which 21.6% of respondents lived in a small or medium-sized city (<1,000,000 inhabitants), while 78.4% lived in larger urban centers. This study showed that the vast majority of ICT usage occurred in large urban areas.\n\n==== Technology Amongst Different Ideals and its Effect on the Economy====\nThe importance of technology and its relationship with economic development was synthesized by Solow (1987a) when he stated that \u201ctechnology remains the dominant engine of growth, with human capital investment in second place.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Solow|first1=R.M.|title=Growth Theory and After|publisher=Stockholm|url=http://content.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=96960681&S=R&D=zbh&EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeqLY4zOX0OLCmr0%2BeqLBSrq24S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGuslGvr7VMuePfgeyx43zxo%2Bt55%2BQA}}</ref>\u201d Concerning economic development and moves to improve it, it is an understood phenomena that countries with the highest availability and use of technology are the countries with the best economies. Technology has not advanced in all societies as far as many thought it would be according to today's societal expectations. This lack of advancement mainly occurs in communities or organizations whose organizational context differentiates from a more skillful and high value profile to a context of autonomy. \u201cIn non-industrial contexts, non-computerized societies and organizations maintain more traditional routines, because they simultaneously face the absorption of techniques and instruments, while copying their preexisting idiosyncrasies, environments, and routines. In these cases change is perceived as expensive, time consuming and risky, producing sentiments that facilitate phobic, indifferent or stereotyped attitudes towards technology\u201d.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|last1=Zapata|first1=Cristian|title=The Digital Divide in the University: The Appropriation of ICT in Higher Education Students from Bogota, Colombia|url=http://content.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=96960681&S=R&D=zbh&EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeqLY4zOX0OLCmr0%2BeqLBSrq24S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGuslGvr7VMuePfgeyx43zxo%2Bt55%2BQA|website=Media Educacion Research|publisher=Comunicar|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref> These preconceptions towards technology play a small role in the digital divide in Colombia. Among society's who are not on the same accord in regards to technology and its benefits, attitudes towards technology show a distinct display of the amount of technological dependence a community has.\n\n====Cultural Preservation vs. Cultural Modernization====\nThe two ideas of cultural preservation and cultural modernization create a divide amongst the world of industry and the world of agriculture. The industry field often involves research and development. Societies involving research and development often require skill in many different areas with products that's value is highly regarded. Both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the products creates a need for enhanced work material, which oftentimes is the latest and fastest technology. Industrially, in Colombia this is understood and industries strive, strengthening the different industries and corporations all over Colombia. Colombia's somewhat, partial digital divide stems from areas of Colombia where locals are resistant to change. In 2003, Avgerou found this resistance to change to be due to the uncertainties of technology among the rural population. Gille referred to what was called the Technological System. This idea of Gilles suggested that technology would eventually transform social life all together by connecting technologies and everyday productive routines. Communities often adopt things that are for the betterment of the entire community. Rural populations and communities are often close knit and every one often shares the same views. The idea of technology is not necessarily one that everyone is going to agree with, especially when a community has done with out considerable updates to their prior owned technology for a long period of time. People admire their culture and want to see that it stay the same, with no flaws or inconsistencies. If the technological system adopted by the community is inconsistent or non-competitive, the host is limited by these gaps and builds and inefficient technical rationality.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The combination of reverence of community and culture, and possibilities of technological gaps delays technological advancement into many developing communities and this creates a digital divide. While information technology is thriving in the developed parts of Colombia with industries and corporations using it to their economic advantage, the rural and developing side of Colombia still has some ground to cover. This delayed progress of information technology can be mended through information technology programs that teach and enable developing communities how to use technology. Progress can also be made through built trust and reassurance through the government about modernized technology.\n\n====Information Technology in Education====\nEducation is oftentimes viewed as the most important aspect of a society. The relationship between quantitative and qualitative productions of learning and the effort invested in the process, measured with respect to the goals set by the educative institution, the available resources and the needs from the environment, educational productivity is defined. Though education levels tend to depend largely on strength of the governments economy, other factors, including educational programs and community involvement can have an impactful effect. The country of Colombia is primarily rural and is mainly represented by remote areas. The general population of Colombia perceives the Internet as not useful and the purchasing power of Colombians is limited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GITR/2013/GITR_Chapter2.1_2013.pdf|title=Colombia's Digital Agenda: Successes and the Challenges Ahead|last1=Vega|first1=Diego|publisher=Ministry of Information and Communication Technologies of Colombia}}</ref> This displays that access to technology is not necessarily essential and, or available. Communities from developing territories end up producing superficial changes in their tortuous transition to the new ICT paradigm, unable to keep up the pace in developing computer skills. The problem is not just the access to tools; it includes the construction of a compatible social, cultural and economic logic (Avgerou, 2003), that, due to the resistance to change from some of the local stakeholders, turns into a complex and slow process.<ref name=\"Information Systems Journal\">{{cite journal|title=The Significance of Context in Information Systems and Organizational Change|journal=Information Systems Journal|volume=11|pages=43\u201363|last1=Avgerou|first1=C.|publisher=Springer|doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2575.2001.00095.x|year=2001|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2570/1/SignifiganceofcontextPDF.pdf}}</ref> It involves sacrificing some of the distinctive particularities of the community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=96960681&S=R&D=zbh&EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeqLY4zOX0OLCmr0%2BeqLBSrq24S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGuslGvr7VMuePfgeyx43zxo%2Bt55%2BQA|title=The Digital Divide in the University: The Appropriation of ICT in Higher Education Students from Bogota, Colombia|last1=Zapata|first1=Cristian|website=Media Educaci\u00f3n Research Journal|publisher=Comunicar|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Solutions to Digital Divide in Education ====\nThe CPE (Country Program Evaluation) allows the transfer of technology to rural areas to be a much smoother one by training teachers to properly use technological information. This knowledge is taken by teachers and aimed to increase levels of incorporation, adaptation, and integration of technologies as required for achievement of sustainable growth in Colombia, ensuring increased productivity and competitiveness while consolidating the quality of the Colombian educational system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GITR/2013/GITR_Chapter2.1_2013.pdf|title=Colombia's Digital Agenda: Successes and the Challengers Ahead|last1=Vega|first1=Diego|publisher=Ministry of Information and Communication Technologies of Colombia|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> Overall, Colombia's information technology presence in public schools are relatively normal. Areas of Colombia where poor educational infrastructure is combined with an economy focused on natural resources and its exploitation, are areas with school systems that focus on technical training concerning the production of basic goods rather than long term knowledge and innovation skills. In regards to higher education and universities in Colombia information technology infrastructure is growing at an alarming rate. From possessing updated technology in the classroom to technological information possessed by those in charge, ICT's (Information Communication Technology) in the Colombian school system is currently at paramount.\n\n=== Bridging The Digital Divide ===\n\n====Government Involvement====\nIn 2010, President Juan Manuel Santos launched ''Vive Digital,'' a government initiative aimed to create jobs, improve economic growth and development, and\u2014most importantly\u2014reduce poverty. ''Vive Digital'' does this all through the embracing of financial opportunities rooted in the production and utilization of technology. Within the past four years, Vive Digital has changed the digital landscape in Colombia. The largest impact has been on the poorest citizens. Colombia has gone from 3.1 million Internet broadband connections in 2010 to 9.9 million in mid-2014, and Internet penetration for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) increased from 7 percent in 2010 to more than 60 percent in 2014. Another initiative the Colombian government has served the people of Colombia with is the National Broadband Policy of the Ministerio de Tecnolog\u00edas de la Informaci\u00f3n y las Comunicaciones (Ministry of Information Technology and Communications) which has increased the percentage of Colombian municipalities connected to the Internet from 17 percent in 2010 to 96 percent today.<ref name=\"America's Quarterly\">{{cite web|last1=Vega|first1=Diego Molano|title=Colombia's Internet Advantage|url=http://www.americasquarterly.org/content/colombias-internet-advantage|website=America's Quarterly|publisher=AMERICAS SOCIETY/ COUNCIL OF THE AMERICAS|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n\"By 2018, the government hopes to have 63 percent of the country connected to broadband. And according to 2013 GSMA mobile economy figures, there are already 43.9 million mobile connections and 24 million mobile users in a country whose 47 million people give it the third largest population in Latin America and third largest Spanish-speaking population in the world.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Egusa|first1=Conrad|title=Colombia Is One Of Latin America's Most Promising New Tech Hubs|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/22/an-overview-of-colombia-one-of-latin-americas-most-promising-new-tech-hubs/|website=techcrunch.com|publisher=tech crunch|accessdate=13 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2014, Hughes Network Systems LLC, one of the leading broadband solutions and providing services in the world, was granted a contract for an HX broadband satellite system and terminals by HISPASAT Colombia. This contract came as the result of the ''Vive Digital'' government initiative.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=6&sid=a0e98037-65de-45ec-a7c0-8757ca242454@sessionmgr4010&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=14E01172442C11C8&db=edsnbk|title=United States : Hughes Technology Selected by HISPASAT to Bridge Digital Di...: Discovery|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref> Hughes Network's increased presence within Colombia has exponentially increased the use of information and communication technologies in Colombia.\n\nThere are two main issues with the digital divide in Colombia that is being researched on. Those two are: how the information is being delivered and, how the information that is being delivered throughout the academic community is working and communicating. The solutions to these issues is getting everyone to focus on the main idea that the way they are communicating with the community is important and vital to civilization. It is important to send out accurate information, and not inform the community with false accusations. Research has shown that the delivery of information has become a vital aspect to Colombia and it includes the way everyone lives their daily lives. Researchers are focusing on the wide spectrum of how information is being spread, whether it is via internet, digital broadcast, mobile communication, or social media networks. With all of the research, it has also been noted to inform the community with the production of interpersonal communication and improvement in technological developments. The goal of the research is to improve the digital divide for Colombia's community to provide an adequate form of communication via the participating communities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gronemeyer|first=M.E.|last2=Condeza|first2=Rayen|date=2013|title=Latin America: A Diversity of Approaches to Explore, Share and Discuss|url=|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=7|pages=1892\u20131895|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Dubai ==\nThe gender digital divide in Middle Eastern countries causes women to have far less access to the internet than men.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1119690.stm|title=Dubai worried about 'digital divide'|date=2001|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-GB}}</ref> Statistically, women are held at lower standards in the Middle East, which is a reason for this digital division.

Between intense government regulation as well as economic factors, it is nearly impossible for the average person to access the internet. With such a gross lack of access to technology and the internet, education is stunted and children are forced to rely on archaic, biased, and often unreliable sources of information.&nbsp;\n\nThe CIA notes that only 15% of the Ethiopian population is connected to the Internet placing the country at 107 of the 217 countries ranked in the study.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2153rank.html#et|title=The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\nIn 2016, the Ethiopian government blocked all social media sites after an anonymous user posted copies of university entrance exams online. In an interview with Reuters News Agency, Mohammed Seid at the Office for Government Communications Affairs, said only social media sites were blocked but BBC News received conflicting reports from Ethiopian citizens who claimed that they experienced problems with both mobile networks and fixed line Internet services.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40118378|title=Ethiopia blocks internet during exams|date=2017-06-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nRoughly 40% of schools in Ethiopia have computers. Of that 40% most of the schools are located in Ethiopia'a capital, Addis Ababa. This in turn has created a divide between schools in urban cities like Addis Ababa and schools in rural areas. Most schools that are connected to the Internet have limited access and only use it for email that's solely for administrators. Many universities and higher learning institutions in Ethiopia have computers but the average ratio of students to computer is about 10:1. Only 15% of private universities in Ethiopia participate in Electronic Distance Education which is also known as online school. For many students, online education is a more convenient alternative to pursuing higher education because of their location.<ref name=\"Ethiopian\">{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/995541468256142802/pdf/463910BRI0Box31ia010ICTed0Survey111.pdf|title=ICT in Education in Ethiopia|last=Hare|first=Harry|date=June 2007|website=World Bank|access-date=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere are two major initiatives aimed at bridging the digital divide gap. SchoolNet Ethiopia is a joint initiative between Ministry of Education and the United Nations Development Programme that has equipped 181 schools with 15 networked computer labs. The Distance Learning initiative backed by The Ministry of Education has been working with the Indira Gandhi National Open University in India to provide master's degrees to students from the University of Addis Adaba in Ethiopia.<ref name=\"Ethiopian\" />\n\n=== Effects ===\nIn a world almost completely reliant on technology and access to the internet, the [[digital divide]] in [[Ethiopia]] poses a major problem for its citizens and the effects are nearly detrimental in the current global economy. Without access to the internet, Ethiopia cannot compete with the rest of the world and this has caused many gradual effects. These include lack of education, continued economic depression, and a gross lack of transparency in the Ethiopian government, as well as many other smaller, trickle down effects.&nbsp;\n\nOne of the greatest effects the digital divide has one Ethiopia is the lack of education. Approximately 39% of adult Ethiopians can read and a mere 98% of school aged children actually attend school full-time. With an essentially&nbsp;non-existent public education system in this poverty stricken country, the current lack of digital access does not help this matter. An improved access to the internet could help better educate Ethiopian children and with decreased costs as well.\n\nAnother effect of the gross disparity in digital access is the economic impact on [[Economy of Ethiopia|Ethiopia's economy]]. Ethiopia is currently one of 19 remaining countries on earth without a true stock exchange. Without access to capital and investments, Ethiopia's economy is growing at a snail pace of 5.4% in 2017. The digital divide plays a major factor in this because without access to technology the economy cannot keep up with the rest of the world. &nbsp;\n\nThe [[Government of Ethiopia|Ethiopian government]] has a very well established reputation of being suppressive and corrupt throughout the world, and the digital divide also impact this. The few citizens with access to the internet who participate in the media are often heavily censored. With access to the internet, freedom of speech would be more easily accessible and less censored. The Ethiopian government would benefit from this because with more fair media coverage there would be less government corruption thus making Ethiopia a more stable country to invest in.\n\n=== Gender ===\nEthiopian women experience more barriers to overcoming this digital divide than men, resulting in a gender gap. Many of these barriers are socially constructed through discriminating gender roles. Women's time and mobility are restricted by the expectation placed on them to bear the most household chores and management, keeping them too busy for educational or leisurely use of technology. Technological devices such as radios or movie showings are gendered as masculine tools and toys that are unfit for women. The restriction on time and mobility placed on women to work at home also cuts down on female participation in education, making them less comfortable with the idea of using computers and mobile phones because they believe themselves to not be educated enough to understand the devices or software. The risks of exploitation or exposure to pornography or harassment online also discourage the use of technology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cipesa.org/2017/03/gender-digital-divide-persists-in-africa/|title=Gender Digital Divide Persists in Africa|website=cipesa.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://itidjournal.org/itid/article/viewFile/792/333|title=Earphones Are Not for Women: Gendered ICT Use Among Youths in Ethiopia and Malawi|last=Geldof|first=Marije|date=Winter 2011|website=|access-date=October 10, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"SOAWR\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.soawr.org/resources/women_and_ICTs.pdf|title=Bridging the Digital Gender Divide in Africa|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWomen could benefit from measures to increase their access to technology and close the digital divide between the genders.

Currently, in most countries, the digital divide is becoming notably less wide due to an increase in availability of affordable electronic devices capable of accessing the internet and has led to an extraordinary increase in competition amongst technological markets. An increase in competition has resulted in increased exposure to new technology with internet access in even the lowest income areas. Despite the increased exposure to technology, there are still other elements of technological access that contribute to the gap. These disparities continue to contribute to the gap that divides nations and prevents historically underprivileged groups from meeting the societal standards that will allow them to thrive in current society.<ref name=Renahy2008/>\n\nThe three digital divides in France are characterized as generational, social and cultural differences, according to a report released by the Center for Strategic Analysis in the French government. The generational gap generally affects the elderly since they are the most unfamiliar with newer technologies. The social divide affects the poor since they are less likely to have the budget for technological devices. The cultural divide affects the least educated of the French since they have fewer opportunities for properly utilizing technology.<ref name=\"LeMonde\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2011/04/20/un-rapport-decrit-les-trois-fosses-numeriques-en-france_1510566_651865.html|title=A report describes the three \"digital divides\" in France|last=Checola|first=Laurent|date=2011-04-20|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|access-date=2017-10-23}}</ref>\n\nA survey released by the centre de recherche pour l'\u00e9tude et l'observation des conditions de vie reported that 17% of the people in France do not have a home computer, 19% do not have any access to the internet, and 23% have no internet access at home.

Those younger than 30 have been recorded to have the highest access to internet. French students retain the highest accessibility. After 30 years of age, accessibility declines. French 59 years and older retain the lowest internet accessibility.<ref name=Renahy2008/>\n\nLess than 17% of people over the age of 75 have a computer at their home. In comparison, more than 90% of people aged 15 to 24 have a home computer. This is quite a large divide with senior citizens who make up about 20% of the population.<ref name=\"LeMonde\" />\n\n==== Education ====\nHigher education correlates to increasing internet accessibility. There is a sharp division between primary and secondary education. [[Secondary education]] graduates have four times the accessibility to internet versus those with only [[primary education]]. [[Post-secondary education]] degrees continue to show an exponential increase in internet accessibility.<ref name=Renahy2008/>\n\n==== Income ====\nHouseholds with higher income levels reflect an increased internet accessibility. Residents with higher salaries are more likely to be able to afford internet connection. The trend persists between employed and unemployed residents. The employed population is 40% more likely to have access to internet.<ref name=Renahy2008/>\n\nOf the individuals with lowest incomes in France only 34% have a home computer and only 28% have internet connection.

This is where there is no broadband access for even a single household within the district. This means Japanese citizens cannot get broadband even if they wanted to because there is no broadband infrastructure in their neighborhood. For some territorial divisions the coverage is up to 99.8% of the people in this area have access to broadband. This leads to a digital divide, but the divide is more drastic at the ends of the curve depending on where you{{Who|date=January 2018}} live.\n\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is aiming to improve broadband penetration in remote areas of Japan, but businesses aren't exactly queuing up to provide expensive infrastructure to hook up remote islands and mountain villages. Japan has more than 4000 islands, 260 of which are inhabited. Japan's land is also 73% mountainous or hilly, and whilst the population is concentrated mainly in the alluvial plains and coastal areas, there are significant populations living in remote valleys deep in the mountains mainly engaged in agriculture or forestry. It is difficult to justify building out a fiber-based infrastructure to a remote island, or to a dead end mountain ravine community miles from anywhere.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fukumimi.wordpress.com/2006/06/28/the-digital-divide-in-japan/|title=The Digital Divide in Japan|date=28 June 2006|website=Wordpress.com|access-date=6 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Possible solutions ===\nThe internet users in Japan are increasing at an exponential rate but there are still areas demographically do not receive optimal broadband satellite [[communications in Japan]].

People with lower education are less likely to access technology or further their professionalism in the [[information technology]] field. Moroccan women can often find that they do not have the same sort of opportunities to technology professions and internet usage. The [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM) was formed to increase opportunities for women and a project called \"Achieving E-Quality in the IT Sector in Morocco\" has been set up for women to be presented with, increasing their professionalism.

Those aged 14\u201325 tend to be more familiar with the different social trends and access them much faster than the older generations. A large attribution to this is the lack of literacy in many adults.

While children able to go to school are learning to read, write and use various forms of technology; many of their parents do not have access to these same resources and may not have had access while they were growing up. The largest city of Morocco, [[Casablanca]], has a population of 3,544,498 as of 2016.

In 2014, there were 2 million internet users in Myanmar. That number, however, increased to 39 million users by 2016. The cause of this drastic increase in internet users was caused mainly by the massive increase in [[Subscriber identity module|SIM card]] sales recorded through May 2016. This combined with a more aggressive network roll-out by mobile providers to other regions, a decline in SIM card prices, the lowered prices of voice and data plans, and the lowered cost of mobile phones all led to this major increase in mobile sales and subscriptions over that two-year period. Because this market is beginning to reach its maturity stage, significant slowdown is predicted to occur by 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/4500253015/Myanmar-internet-gets-boost-with-content-delivery-network|title=Myanmar internet gets boost with content delivery network|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.budde.com.au/Research/Myanmar-Burma-Telecoms-Mobile-Broadband-and-Digital-Media-Statistics-and-Analyses|title=Myanmar (Burma) - Telecoms, Mobile, Broadband and Digital Media - Statistics and Analyses - BuddeComm|website=www.budde.com.au}}</ref>\n\n=== Gender digital divide ===\nNearly 30% of women are less likely to have access to a mobile device in Myanmar.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Irex|first1=Irex|title=Ending the Gender Digital Divide in Myanmar|url=https://www.irex.org/sites/default/files/node/resource/overview-gender-digital-divide-myanmar-assessment.pdf|website=Irex.org|publisher=IREX|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref> The cell phone is the main source of internet access in the country.

Internet access in Pakistan began in the 1990s and has continued to grow over the past decades. In fact, Pakistan has about 32 million internet users. However, according to data collected by the World Bank, Pakistan has an overall population of about 193 million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=PK|title=Population, total - Data|website=data.WorldBank.org|access-date=6 January 2018}}</ref> In addition, Pakistan also has about 15 million people who access the internet from their mobile devices. Pakistan has 5 broadband internet providers and 10 DSL. Broadband use through computers is the number one way that people access the internet in Pakistan. The second most popular way that people of Pakistan access the internet is through their cellular devices. Even though there are about 32 million internet user compared to a large population, [[Internet in Pakistan#cite note-1|Internet in Pakistan]] is ranked 20th in the world.\n\n===Cell phone coverage===\nPakistan has five major cell phone providers. The five are (in order from most to fewest subscribers): [[Jazz (mobile network)|Jazz]] 51.88 million; Telenor 39.37 million; Zong 27.71 million; Ufone 18.46 million; and Warid 12 million.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Recently in May 2017, the Pakistani government decided to lower tariffs and taxes on cellular services as well as on mobile phones. The reasons for this decision included years of pressure from the nation's top mobile operators and a [[World Bank]] report pointing out [[Pakistan]]'s high taxing of telecom services in the region.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mobileworldlive.com/asia/asia-news/pakistan-to-cut-taxes-on-mobile-services-handsets/|title=Pakistan to cut taxes on mobile services, handsets - Mobile World Live|date=2017-05-29|work=Mobile World Live|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n===Gender and caste===\nIn rural Pakistan, cell service use is divided along gender lines. Karin Astrid Siegmann pointed out this disparity; 40 percent of female users have to ask permission from the male owners to make calls. Cell phones being in the hands of females is viewed unfavorably in Pakistani culture.

Newer castes rank much more highly on the [[Digital Access Index]] (DAI) than do the older castes. The same study compared two political parties. One political party, called the [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf|PTI]] ([[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]]), was composed of newer castes [[Khan (caste)|(Khan]], [[Hashmi]], [[Alvi]], and [[Qureshi]]). The [[Muslim League (Pakistan)|Muslim League]] is composed of older castes. The PTI outperformed the Pakistan Muslim League in number of foreign visitors to its web site, with a combined percentage of 12.7%, and in websites linking to it with 450, compared to the Muslim League's 168 (See Table 6 page 354). Ahsan Abdullah elaborates the important background of these findings: \"Members of the new caste traditionally have not been farmers; for example, members of the [[Sheikh caste|Sheikh]] caste are traditionally traders, and members of the [[Syed]] caste traditionally hold religious offices, and hence they have to be better educated as compared to the old caste members. The old caste members, who are traditionally farmers, require tacit knowledge more than education to be successful. This observation is supported by the higher literacy rate in new castes as compared to the old caste members, with [[Pathan]], Sheikh, and Syed being the top three educated castes among the 12 castes considered.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=15&sid=a768fe68-af9d-44eb-af35-d77ac5d19ee3%40sessionmgr103|title=Digital Divide and Caste in Rural Pakistan|last=Abdullah|first=Ahsan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105095431/http://libezp.lib.lsu.edu/login?url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=15&sid=a768fe68-af9d-44eb-af35-d77ac5d19ee3@sessionmgr103|archive-date=2020-01-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Solutions===\nBesides Private efforts, Public efforts put forth by the Pakistani government would help bridge the digital divide.

This prompted major school reforms and in 2012, a K-12 school curriculum was introduced which included a year of kindergarten and two senior school years. The Department of Education in the Philippines (DepEd) goal for students who graduate from the K-12 curriculum is for these students to understand technology works and how they can benefit from it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wenr.wes.org/2015/06/education-philippines|title=Education in the Philippines|last1=Clark|first1=Nick|website=World Education News & Reviews|accessdate=12 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe curriculum of this program focuses on developing students to be comfortable with using computers and technology. Some examples are that in grade 4 students will learn how to use the basic functions of the computer, including the use of the internet and emailing, in safe ways. In grade 6, students will begin taking art classes to learn how to use technology for digital paintings and graphic designs. In grade 7, students will begin learning how to academically use the internet for journals and searching for academic sources for essays and other similar assignments. In the higher upper level grades, the curriculum will include schools that specialize in computer education as well as science and technology. The Philippines being able to close in on the technology gap after being so behind in the 1990s and early 2000s is going to very much improve the graduation rate of the students now that they can study at home and use their sources to their advantage through tablets and computers instead of only being able to access their school work in the classroom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/education-and-home/2015/07/30/1482483/technology-k-12|title=Technology in K to 12|last1=Cruz|first1=Isagani|website=Philippine Star|accessdate=12 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Saudi Arabia ==\nThe digital divide in Saudi Arabia is seen through their Internet usage statistics 47.5% of Saudi Arabians use the internet compared to 78.2% of the United States.

The lack of adaptation to the [[informatization]] of social services, such as administration and welfare, results in limited opportunities for basic daily life and social participation. South Korea's information gap was initially due to economic reasons and the difference in the initial cost for using the Internet or PC, but recently there has been a gap between the users of the information according to the degree of utilization of information.<ref>{{cite web|title=\uc815\ubcf4\uaca9\ucc28(Digital Divide)|url=http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&MAS_IDX=101013000769848|website=DooSan Dictionary|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref> As the information society rapidly developed, the distribution of the Internet quickly accelerated in Korea, dividing people into two groups, people who are well adapted to the changes and those who are more familiar with the previous media.

Age is one of the main factors, and Argentina's statistics show a common disparity between ages. According to TNS Infratest, the age group with the highest rate of daily internet users in 2016 were users under 25. 91% of that age demographic were polled as being daily internet users. In contrast, the age group with the lowest rate were users over 55, with only 68% of that demographic being daily internet users.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/339986/daily-internet-usage-age-group-argentina/|title=Daily internet usage in Argentina by age group 2016 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}</ref> The older one is, the less likely they are to use Internet, and these statistics reflect that. The way that users are able to access the Internet can also show the status of Internet and how easily one can utilize it.

The children are well educated in school, and they are given numerous opportunities to pursue afterwards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.internations.org/argentina-expats/guide/living-in-argentina-15328/education-in-argentina-3|title=Education in Argentina|website=www.internations.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-06}}</ref> The Government created a project named \"Conectar Igualdad\" (Connecting Equality) where they distribute netbooks to students and teachers in primary school, special needs schools, and state institutes. Since the project began nearly 4,000,000 netbooks have been dispersed amongst them to 400 different schools and 7,500 different teachers. The program works in three parts: an internet connection to Wi-Fi, an established internet connection through a reliable network (giving students Internet access anywhere, even at home), and making use of a syntonizer for Digital TV, allowing students access to interactive live programs. In 2011, the Government launched another program named \"Escuelas de Innovacion\" (Schools of Innovation). The main goal is to guarantee students better access to education and technology.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://globalstatement.wordpress.com/2014/09/22/argentina-projects-encouraging-digital-education/|title=Argentina: Projects encouraging digital education|date=2014-09-22|work=Global Statement: A blog of the Swiss ERI-Network|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}</ref> The Government of Argentina creates new and innovative projects each year for students and teachers to have greater access to the Internet. It plays an important role in their education and is a great opportunity for students and teachers to close the gap in the digital divide.\n\n== Africa ==\nThe digital divide is generally wider in Sub-Saharan Africa, as those countries experience widespread poverty. There are reportedly only 7% of the continent's inhabitants that are online. However, mobile phone usage is shockingly high at 72%. Only 18% of these phones are smartphones. The lack of Internet usage can partially be attributed to the fact that the most common language used on the Internet is English. However, it can also be attributed to the fact that the literacy rate in African countries is not very high.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jan/24/digital-divide-access-to-information-africa|title=Access to information: Bridging the digital divide in Africa|last1=Treisman|first1=Loren|date=2014-01-24|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> To combat the digital divide in Africa, economists have suggested stimulating the economy of the region. Bridging the digital divide was a major concern of those at the [[International Telecommunication Union]] Telecoms World conference in Durban, South Africa. The forum stressed the need for African governments to key into ITU's initiative for Africa, which emphasized infrastructure, investment, innovation and inclusivity. Furthermore, entrepreneurs were encouraged to address the specific challenges that Africans face in regards to accessing the Internet.\n\nIn a study conducted in 2011, they estimate that internet access is only available to roughly fourteen percent of the African population.<sup>[[Internet in Africa#cite note-8|[2]]]</sup> This means that while the world's population is only composed of fifteen percent of Africans, around six percent of that subscribe to the internet. <sup>[[Internet in Africa#cite note-WorldStats-9|[3]]]</sup>\n\n=== Poverty and Poor Infrastructure in Africa ===\nEven though technology has become more and more affordable, there is still a disparage between poor people's access to Internet and wealthy people's access to Internet. This becomes an issue once children begin school, as kids who are in low income school systems do not have access to technology in which they are not granted technical skills to develop to continue their education and later translate those skills to the workplace.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalresponsibility.org/digital-divide-the-technology-gap-between-rich-and-poor/|title=Digital Divide: The Technology Gap between the Rich and Poor}}</ref> This low level of computer literacy can be attributed to poor infrastructure and high costs to stay connected. In 2000, the entirety of Sub Saharan Africa had less telephone lines than Manhattan as a whole.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe poor infrastructure in Africa makes it much more difficult for economic development because countries are unable to develop technologically. Particularly, landlocked countries face major difficulties due to the fact that there are rarely any port cities in these countries, not giving them much trade power. It is estimated that investment in better roads increased investment in telecommunications would help further develop the infrastructure in the continent. Furthermore, the differentiating languages between the existing countries and pre-existing differences between different cultures provides a barrier to Inter-Continental development.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n=== Internet Access ===\nAccording to 2011 estimates, about 13.5% of the African population has Internet access [[Internet in Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Africa accounts for 15% of the World population, but only 6.2% of the world's population is African.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} However, these statistics are skewed due to the fact that most of these Internet users come from South Africa, a country that has a much better infrastructure than the rest of the continent. The rest is mainly distributed among Morocco and Egypt, both countries that have better infrastructures than the majority of the countries in Africa, yet not as strong as that of South Africa. There have been many initiatives in the U.S. to push for better infrastructure which would eventually lead to better Internet access in Africa.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n== Bangladesh ==\n{{see also|Internet in Bangladesh}}\n\nThe digital divide in Bangladesh is a gap in the population of Arshads who can access [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] ([[Information and communications technology|ICTs]]) and those without proper access or skills.<ref name=\"Rahman\">{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Anisur|date=Fall 2017|title=Access to Global Information - A case of Digital Divide in Bangladesh|url=http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1819&context=iatul|journal=Information Development|volume= 32| issue = 1|pages= 5\u201319|via=EBSCOhost|doi=10.1177/0266666913518445}}</ref>\n\n=== Government and Community ===\n{{Main|Government of Bangladesh}}\n\nInformation and communication technologies use in Bangladesh began to grow in 2005 with the introduction of [[Free trade|market liberalization]].<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Rashid|first=Ahmed Tareq|date=Winter 2017|title=Inclusive Capitalism and Development: Case Studies of Telecenters Fostering Inclusion through ICTs in Bangladesh|url=http://www.itidjournal.org/index.php/itid/article/view/1427|journal=Information Technologies & International Development|volume= 13|pages= 14|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref>\n\nThe government has been trying to help increase ICT availability to all Bangladeshis by reducing taxes on the [[Very-small-aperture terminal|VSAT]] and creating special projects to support the spread of ICTs.<ref name=\"Rahman\" /> In 2006 the largest mobile phone company in Bangladesh, GrameenPhone Ltd, introduced Community Information Centers (CICs), which are each equipped with two computers, printers, digital cameras and web cameras that can be used by the community.<ref name=\":4\" /> \"There are over 500 CICs operating in 450 subdistricts in Bangladesh\".<ref name=\":4\" /> Within the community, there is research suggesting that men benefit more from ICTs than women due to Bangladesh's gender discrimination.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Hossain|first=Sarah|last2=Beresford|first2=Melanie|date=Winter 2012|title=Paving the pathway for women's empowerment?

In addition to physical access, literature review and types of internet use have also been main points of focus in regards to a solution for digital divide in Colombia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Velasquez|first1=Alcides|title=Digital Divide in Colombia: The Role of Motivational and Material Access in the Use and Types of Use of ICTs|journal=International Journal of Communication|date=2013|volume=7|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/download/2180/969|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Types of Internet Use (ICT) ===\nThere is a difference between material or physical access and actual use of ICTs. \"According to Hargittai (2008),\ndifferences in the uses of ICTs have important implications for life outcomes\". \"Rojas and Puig-i-abril (2009) found that the most prevalent activities of Internet users in Colombia were checking e-mail, consuming entertainment content, chatting with friends, and consuming news and information.\" There are different levels of \"use\" including, non-use, low use, and frequent use while also taking into consideration the opportunities taken by the users. There is a difference in those who go online just for fun and those who use the internet for the improvement of themselves. \n(International Journal of Communication (19328036)) (Digital Divide in Colombia: The Role of Motivational and Material Access in the Use and Types of Use of ICTs).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Velasquez|first1=Alcides|date=2013|title=Digital Divide in Colombia: The Role of Motivational and Material Access in the Use and Types of Use of ICTs|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=6&sid=f151dc7b-5ad1-4f82-9162-8ebbbbc6f443%40sessionmgr101&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=ufh&AN=99140318|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=7|pages=1768\u20131783}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical Access ===\nOne digital divide study displayed physical access as \"having\"/\"not having\" access to the internet. Those who are less fortunate have been shown to lack educational advantage, due to the fact of not having access to internet as common as those who are more fortunate in wealth. Communities that are more technological advanced offers their communities to expand their knowledge and be able to communicate with other worlds. The intellectual advantage is common for countries, such as Colombia, where the poor communities are lacking the opportunities offered to those who are on the other side of town with more advantage. Poor communities are focusing on trying to make ends meet, and working hard labor without being offered to make a change to better themselves. The internet plays an important role in this, due to the fact that the internet provides opportunities to explore new jobs and to widen individuals' knowledge. In certain areas where the communities are wealthy, the internet is provided at the access of their hands. Being able to access the internet so easily, gives privileged individuals the chance to go beyond their expectations and get their point out into the world.\n\n=== Causes of the Digital Divide in Colombia ===\nThere is no singular cause of the Digital Divide in Colombia. A number of different factors each contribute to the variance of access to technology within Colombia. These factors include location, economic class, education, and others.\n\nIn Colombia, those located in large cities are 69% more likely to use the Internet.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Velasquez|first=Alcides|date=January 2013|title=Digital Divide in Colombia|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=6&sid=aa35d002-0e64-4818-aae4-32e576e1d4cb@sessionmgr4007|journal=International Journal of Communication (19328036)|volume=1768|pages=1772\u20131776|via=Discovery}}</ref> The high correlation between the use of ICTs and location in large industrial cities is one of the most visible examples of digital divide in Colombia. People located in rural parts of Colombia are significantly less likely to use ICTs and the internet regularly for various reasons. One leading cause is simply because people living in rural parts of the country tend to be less educated which is negatively correlated with technology use. The pastoral parts of Colombia are often much less developed than the large cities. Often, these rustic areas lack the technology and internet providers needed to further bridge the digital divide between large and small cities. A study of the Digital Divide in Colombia concerning residency included a population in which 21.6% of respondents lived in a small or medium-sized city (<1,000,000 inhabitants), while 78.4% lived in larger urban centers. This study showed that the vast majority of ICT usage occurred in large urban areas.\n\n==== Technology Amongst Different Ideals and its Effect on the Economy====\nThe importance of technology and its relationship with economic development was synthesized by Solow (1987a) when he stated that \u201ctechnology remains the dominant engine of growth, with human capital investment in second place.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Solow|first1=R.M.|title=Growth Theory and After|publisher=Stockholm|url=http://content.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=96960681&S=R&D=zbh&EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeqLY4zOX0OLCmr0%2BeqLBSrq24S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGuslGvr7VMuePfgeyx43zxo%2Bt55%2BQA}}</ref>\u201d Concerning economic development and moves to improve it, it is an understood phenomena that countries with the highest availability and use of technology are the countries with the best economies. Technology has not advanced in all societies as far as many thought it would be according to today's societal expectations. This lack of advancement mainly occurs in communities or organizations whose organizational context differentiates from a more skillful and high value profile to a context of autonomy. \u201cIn non-industrial contexts, non-computerized societies and organizations maintain more traditional routines, because they simultaneously face the absorption of techniques and instruments, while copying their preexisting idiosyncrasies, environments, and routines. In these cases change is perceived as expensive, time consuming and risky, producing sentiments that facilitate phobic, indifferent or stereotyped attitudes towards technology\u201d.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|last1=Zapata|first1=Cristian|title=The Digital Divide in the University: The Appropriation of ICT in Higher Education Students from Bogota, Colombia|url=http://content.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=96960681&S=R&D=zbh&EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeqLY4zOX0OLCmr0%2BeqLBSrq24S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGuslGvr7VMuePfgeyx43zxo%2Bt55%2BQA|website=Media Educacion Research|publisher=Comunicar|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref> These preconceptions towards technology play a small role in the digital divide in Colombia. Among society's who are not on the same accord in regards to technology and its benefits, attitudes towards technology show a distinct display of the amount of technological dependence a community has.\n\n====Cultural Preservation vs. Cultural Modernization====\nThe two ideas of cultural preservation and cultural modernization create a divide amongst the world of industry and the world of agriculture. The industry field often involves research and development. Societies involving research and development often require skill in many different areas with products that's value is highly regarded. Both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the products creates a need for enhanced work material, which oftentimes is the latest and fastest technology. Industrially, in Colombia this is understood and industries strive, strengthening the different industries and corporations all over Colombia. Colombia's somewhat, partial digital divide stems from areas of Colombia where locals are resistant to change. In 2003, Avgerou found this resistance to change to be due to the uncertainties of technology among the rural population. Gille referred to what was called the Technological System. This idea of Gilles suggested that technology would eventually transform social life all together by connecting technologies and everyday productive routines. Communities often adopt things that are for the betterment of the entire community. Rural populations and communities are often close knit and every one often shares the same views. The idea of technology is not necessarily one that everyone is going to agree with, especially when a community has done with out considerable updates to their prior owned technology for a long period of time. People admire their culture and want to see that it stay the same, with no flaws or inconsistencies. If the technological system adopted by the community is inconsistent or non-competitive, the host is limited by these gaps and builds and inefficient technical rationality.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The combination of reverence of community and culture, and possibilities of technological gaps delays technological advancement into many developing communities and this creates a digital divide. While information technology is thriving in the developed parts of Colombia with industries and corporations using it to their economic advantage, the rural and developing side of Colombia still has some ground to cover. This delayed progress of information technology can be mended through information technology programs that teach and enable developing communities how to use technology. Progress can also be made through built trust and reassurance through the government about modernized technology.\n\n====Information Technology in Education====\nEducation is oftentimes viewed as the most important aspect of a society. The relationship between quantitative and qualitative productions of learning and the effort invested in the process, measured with respect to the goals set by the educative institution, the available resources and the needs from the environment, educational productivity is defined. Though education levels tend to depend largely on strength of the governments economy, other factors, including educational programs and community involvement can have an impactful effect. The country of Colombia is primarily rural and is mainly represented by remote areas. The general population of Colombia perceives the Internet as not useful and the purchasing power of Colombians is limited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GITR/2013/GITR_Chapter2.1_2013.pdf|title=Colombia's Digital Agenda: Successes and the Challenges Ahead|last1=Vega|first1=Diego|publisher=Ministry of Information and Communication Technologies of Colombia}}</ref> This displays that access to technology is not necessarily essential and, or available. Communities from developing territories end up producing superficial changes in their tortuous transition to the new ICT paradigm, unable to keep up the pace in developing computer skills. The problem is not just the access to tools; it includes the construction of a compatible social, cultural and economic logic (Avgerou, 2003), that, due to the resistance to change from some of the local stakeholders, turns into a complex and slow process.<ref name=\"Information Systems Journal\">{{cite journal|title=The Significance of Context in Information Systems and Organizational Change|journal=Information Systems Journal|volume=11|pages=43\u201363|last1=Avgerou|first1=C.|publisher=Springer|doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2575.2001.00095.x|year=2001|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2570/1/SignifiganceofcontextPDF.pdf}}</ref> It involves sacrificing some of the distinctive particularities of the community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=96960681&S=R&D=zbh&EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeqLY4zOX0OLCmr0%2BeqLBSrq24S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGuslGvr7VMuePfgeyx43zxo%2Bt55%2BQA|title=The Digital Divide in the University: The Appropriation of ICT in Higher Education Students from Bogota, Colombia|last1=Zapata|first1=Cristian|website=Media Educaci\u00f3n Research Journal|publisher=Comunicar|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Solutions to Digital Divide in Education ====\nThe CPE (Country Program Evaluation) allows the transfer of technology to rural areas to be a much smoother one by training teachers to properly use technological information. This knowledge is taken by teachers and aimed to increase levels of incorporation, adaptation, and integration of technologies as required for achievement of sustainable growth in Colombia, ensuring increased productivity and competitiveness while consolidating the quality of the Colombian educational system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GITR/2013/GITR_Chapter2.1_2013.pdf|title=Colombia's Digital Agenda: Successes and the Challengers Ahead|last1=Vega|first1=Diego|publisher=Ministry of Information and Communication Technologies of Colombia|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> Overall, Colombia's information technology presence in public schools are relatively normal. Areas of Colombia where poor educational infrastructure is combined with an economy focused on natural resources and its exploitation, are areas with school systems that focus on technical training concerning the production of basic goods rather than long term knowledge and innovation skills. In regards to higher education and universities in Colombia information technology infrastructure is growing at an alarming rate. From possessing updated technology in the classroom to technological information possessed by those in charge, ICT's (Information Communication Technology) in the Colombian school system is currently at paramount.\n\n=== Bridging The Digital Divide ===\n\n====Government Involvement====\nIn 2010, President Juan Manuel Santos launched ''Vive Digital,'' a government initiative aimed to create jobs, improve economic growth and development, and\u2014most importantly\u2014reduce poverty. ''Vive Digital'' does this all through the embracing of financial opportunities rooted in the production and utilization of technology. Within the past four years, Vive Digital has changed the digital landscape in Colombia. The largest impact has been on the poorest citizens. Colombia has gone from 3.1 million Internet broadband connections in 2010 to 9.9 million in mid-2014, and Internet penetration for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) increased from 7 percent in 2010 to more than 60 percent in 2014. Another initiative the Colombian government has served the people of Colombia with is the National Broadband Policy of the Ministerio de Tecnolog\u00edas de la Informaci\u00f3n y las Comunicaciones (Ministry of Information Technology and Communications) which has increased the percentage of Colombian municipalities connected to the Internet from 17 percent in 2010 to 96 percent today.<ref name=\"America's Quarterly\">{{cite web|last1=Vega|first1=Diego Molano|title=Colombia's Internet Advantage|url=http://www.americasquarterly.org/content/colombias-internet-advantage|website=America's Quarterly|publisher=AMERICAS SOCIETY/ COUNCIL OF THE AMERICAS|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n\"By 2018, the government hopes to have 63 percent of the country connected to broadband. And according to 2013 GSMA mobile economy figures, there are already 43.9 million mobile connections and 24 million mobile users in a country whose 47 million people give it the third largest population in Latin America and third largest Spanish-speaking population in the world.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Egusa|first1=Conrad|title=Colombia Is One Of Latin America's Most Promising New Tech Hubs|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/22/an-overview-of-colombia-one-of-latin-americas-most-promising-new-tech-hubs/|website=techcrunch.com|publisher=tech crunch|accessdate=13 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2014, Hughes Network Systems LLC, one of the leading broadband solutions and providing services in the world, was granted a contract for an HX broadband satellite system and terminals by HISPASAT Colombia. This contract came as the result of the ''Vive Digital'' government initiative.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=6&sid=a0e98037-65de-45ec-a7c0-8757ca242454@sessionmgr4010&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=14E01172442C11C8&db=edsnbk|title=United States : Hughes Technology Selected by HISPASAT to Bridge Digital Di...: Discovery|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref> Hughes Network's increased presence within Colombia has exponentially increased the use of information and communication technologies in Colombia.\n\nThere are two main issues with the digital divide in Colombia that is being researched on. Those two are: how the information is being delivered and, how the information that is being delivered throughout the academic community is working and communicating. The solutions to these issues is getting everyone to focus on the main idea that the way they are communicating with the community is important and vital to civilization. It is important to send out accurate information, and not inform the community with false accusations. Research has shown that the delivery of information has become a vital aspect to Colombia and it includes the way everyone lives their daily lives. Researchers are focusing on the wide spectrum of how information is being spread, whether it is via internet, digital broadcast, mobile communication, or social media networks. With all of the research, it has also been noted to inform the community with the production of interpersonal communication and improvement in technological developments. The goal of the research is to improve the digital divide for Colombia's community to provide an adequate form of communication via the participating communities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gronemeyer|first=M.E.|last2=Condeza|first2=Rayen|date=2013|title=Latin America: A Diversity of Approaches to Explore, Share and Discuss|url=|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=7|pages=1892\u20131895|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Dubai ==\nThe gender digital divide in Middle Eastern countries causes women to have far less access to the internet than men.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1119690.stm|title=Dubai worried about 'digital divide'|date=2001|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-GB}}</ref> Statistically, women are held at lower standards in the Middle East, which is a reason for this digital division.

Between intense government regulation as well as economic factors, it is nearly impossible for the average person to access the internet. With such a gross lack of access to technology and the internet, education is stunted and children are forced to rely on archaic, biased, and often unreliable sources of information.&nbsp;\n\nThe CIA notes that only 15% of the Ethiopian population is connected to the Internet placing the country at 107 of the 217 countries ranked in the study.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2153rank.html#et|title=The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\nIn 2016, the Ethiopian government blocked all social media sites after an anonymous user posted copies of university entrance exams online. In an interview with Reuters News Agency, Mohammed Seid at the Office for Government Communications Affairs, said only social media sites were blocked but BBC News received conflicting reports from Ethiopian citizens who claimed that they experienced problems with both mobile networks and fixed line Internet services.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40118378|title=Ethiopia blocks internet during exams|date=2017-06-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nRoughly 40% of schools in Ethiopia have computers. Of that 40% most of the schools are located in Ethiopia'a capital, Addis Ababa. This in turn has created a divide between schools in urban cities like Addis Ababa and schools in rural areas. Most schools that are connected to the Internet have limited access and only use it for email that's solely for administrators. Many universities and higher learning institutions in Ethiopia have computers but the average ratio of students to computer is about 10:1. Only 15% of private universities in Ethiopia participate in Electronic Distance Education which is also known as online school. For many students, online education is a more convenient alternative to pursuing higher education because of their location.<ref name=\"Ethiopian\">{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/995541468256142802/pdf/463910BRI0Box31ia010ICTed0Survey111.pdf|title=ICT in Education in Ethiopia|last=Hare|first=Harry|date=June 2007|website=World Bank|access-date=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere are two major initiatives aimed at bridging the digital divide gap. SchoolNet Ethiopia is a joint initiative between Ministry of Education and the United Nations Development Programme that has equipped 181 schools with 15 networked computer labs. The Distance Learning initiative backed by The Ministry of Education has been working with the Indira Gandhi National Open University in India to provide master's degrees to students from the University of Addis Adaba in Ethiopia.<ref name=\"Ethiopian\" />\n\n=== Effects ===\nIn a world almost completely reliant on technology and access to the internet, the [[digital divide]] in [[Ethiopia]] poses a major problem for its citizens and the effects are nearly detrimental in the current global economy. Without access to the internet, Ethiopia cannot compete with the rest of the world and this has caused many gradual effects. These include lack of education, continued economic depression, and a gross lack of transparency in the Ethiopian government, as well as many other smaller, trickle down effects.&nbsp;\n\nOne of the greatest effects the digital divide has one Ethiopia is the lack of education. Approximately 39% of adult Ethiopians can read and a mere 98% of school aged children actually attend school full-time. With an essentially&nbsp;non-existent public education system in this poverty stricken country, the current lack of digital access does not help this matter. An improved access to the internet could help better educate Ethiopian children and with decreased costs as well.\n\nAnother effect of the gross disparity in digital access is the economic impact on [[Economy of Ethiopia|Ethiopia's economy]]. Ethiopia is currently one of 19 remaining countries on earth without a true stock exchange. Without access to capital and investments, Ethiopia's economy is growing at a snail pace of 5.4% in 2017. The digital divide plays a major factor in this because without access to technology the economy cannot keep up with the rest of the world. &nbsp;\n\nThe [[Government of Ethiopia|Ethiopian government]] has a very well established reputation of being suppressive and corrupt throughout the world, and the digital divide also impact this. The few citizens with access to the internet who participate in the media are often heavily censored. With access to the internet, freedom of speech would be more easily accessible and less censored. The Ethiopian government would benefit from this because with more fair media coverage there would be less government corruption thus making Ethiopia a more stable country to invest in.\n\n=== Gender ===\nEthiopian women experience more barriers to overcoming this digital divide than men, resulting in a gender gap. Many of these barriers are socially constructed through discriminating gender roles. Women's time and mobility are restricted by the expectation placed on them to bear the most household chores and management, keeping them too busy for educational or leisurely use of technology. Technological devices such as radios or movie showings are gendered as masculine tools and toys that are unfit for women. The restriction on time and mobility placed on women to work at home also cuts down on female participation in education, making them less comfortable with the idea of using computers and mobile phones because they believe themselves to not be educated enough to understand the devices or software. The risks of exploitation or exposure to pornography or harassment online also discourage the use of technology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cipesa.org/2017/03/gender-digital-divide-persists-in-africa/|title=Gender Digital Divide Persists in Africa|website=cipesa.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://itidjournal.org/itid/article/viewFile/792/333|title=Earphones Are Not for Women: Gendered ICT Use Among Youths in Ethiopia and Malawi|last=Geldof|first=Marije|date=Winter 2011|website=|access-date=October 10, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"SOAWR\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.soawr.org/resources/women_and_ICTs.pdf|title=Bridging the Digital Gender Divide in Africa|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWomen could benefit from measures to increase their access to technology and close the digital divide between the genders.

This gap leads to a decrease in the standard of living for those without access to technology while the standard of living for those who do have access to technology increases exponentially.<ref name=\"PRCFrance\">{{cite web|last1=Poushter|first1=Jacob|title=Not everyone in advanced economies is using social media|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/20/not-everyone-in-advanced-economies-is-using-social-media/|website=Pew Research Center|accessdate=25 November 2017}}</ref> The global digital divide has been an issue for hundreds of years and is far from a new phenomenon. Currently, in most countries, the digital divide is becoming notably less wide due to an increase in availability of affordable electronic devices capable of accessing the internet and has led to an extraordinary increase in competition amongst technological markets. An increase in competition has resulted in increased exposure to new technology with internet access in even the lowest income areas. Despite the increased exposure to technology, there are still other elements of technological access that contribute to the gap. These disparities continue to contribute to the gap that divides nations and prevents historically underprivileged groups from meeting the societal standards that will allow them to thrive in current society.<ref name=Renahy2008/>\n\nThe three digital divides in France are characterized as generational, social and cultural differences, according to a report released by the Center for Strategic Analysis in the French government. The generational gap generally affects the elderly since they are the most unfamiliar with newer technologies. The social divide affects the poor since they are less likely to have the budget for technological devices. The cultural divide affects the least educated of the French since they have fewer opportunities for properly utilizing technology.<ref name=\"LeMonde\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2011/04/20/un-rapport-decrit-les-trois-fosses-numeriques-en-france_1510566_651865.html|title=A report describes the three \"digital divides\" in France|last=Checola|first=Laurent|date=2011-04-20|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|access-date=2017-10-23}}</ref>\n\nA survey released by the centre de recherche pour l'\u00e9tude et l'observation des conditions de vie reported that 17% of the people in France do not have a home computer, 19% do not have any access to the internet, and 23% have no internet access at home. They also reported that only 1 in 3 people aged 70 or older can be considered internet users.\n\n=== Internet Accessibility ===\nIn France, internet accessibility is not equally distributed among the entire population.<ref name=\"PRCFrance\" /> Factors that determine internet accessibility in the French community are age, education, and income. Higher internet availability was found among French residents younger than 30 years of age, completed some level of higher education, and are currently employed or in school.<ref name=Renahy2008>{{cite journal|last1=Renahy|first1=Emilie|title=Health information seeking on the Internet: a double divide?

Those younger than 30 have been recorded to have the highest access to internet. French students retain the highest accessibility. After 30 years of age, accessibility declines. French 59 years and older retain the lowest internet accessibility.<ref name=Renahy2008/>\n\nLess than 17% of people over the age of 75 have a computer at their home. In comparison, more than 90% of people aged 15 to 24 have a home computer. This is quite a large divide with senior citizens who make up about 20% of the population.<ref name=\"LeMonde\" />\n\n==== Education ====\nHigher education correlates to increasing internet accessibility. There is a sharp division between primary and secondary education. [[Secondary education]] graduates have four times the accessibility to internet versus those with only [[primary education]]. [[Post-secondary education]] degrees continue to show an exponential increase in internet accessibility.<ref name=Renahy2008/>\n\n==== Income ====\nHouseholds with higher income levels reflect an increased internet accessibility. Residents with higher salaries are more likely to be able to afford internet connection. The trend persists between employed and unemployed residents. The employed population is 40% more likely to have access to internet.<ref name=Renahy2008/>\n\nOf the individuals with lowest incomes in France only 34% have a home computer and only 28% have internet connection.

This is where there is no broadband access for even a single household within the district. This means Japanese citizens cannot get broadband even if they wanted to because there is no broadband infrastructure in their neighborhood. For some territorial divisions the coverage is up to 99.8% of the people in this area have access to broadband. This leads to a digital divide, but the divide is more drastic at the ends of the curve depending on where you{{Who|date=January 2018}} live.\n\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is aiming to improve broadband penetration in remote areas of Japan, but businesses aren't exactly queuing up to provide expensive infrastructure to hook up remote islands and mountain villages. Japan has more than 4000 islands, 260 of which are inhabited. Japan's land is also 73% mountainous or hilly, and whilst the population is concentrated mainly in the alluvial plains and coastal areas, there are significant populations living in remote valleys deep in the mountains mainly engaged in agriculture or forestry.

Moroccan women can often find that they do not have the same sort of opportunities to technology professions and internet usage. The [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM) was formed to increase opportunities for women and a project called \"Achieving E-Quality in the IT Sector in Morocco\" has been set up for women to be presented with, increasing their professionalism.

While children able to go to school are learning to read, write and use various forms of technology; many of their parents do not have access to these same resources and may not have had access while they were growing up. The largest city of Morocco, [[Casablanca]], has a population of 3,544,498 as of 2016.

In 2014, there were 2 million internet users in Myanmar. That number, however, increased to 39 million users by 2016. The cause of this drastic increase in internet users was caused mainly by the massive increase in [[Subscriber identity module|SIM card]] sales recorded through May 2016. This combined with a more aggressive network roll-out by mobile providers to other regions, a decline in SIM card prices, the lowered prices of voice and data plans, and the lowered cost of mobile phones all led to this major increase in mobile sales and subscriptions over that two-year period. Because this market is beginning to reach its maturity stage, significant slowdown is predicted to occur by 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/4500253015/Myanmar-internet-gets-boost-with-content-delivery-network|title=Myanmar internet gets boost with content delivery network|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.budde.com.au/Research/Myanmar-Burma-Telecoms-Mobile-Broadband-and-Digital-Media-Statistics-and-Analyses|title=Myanmar (Burma) - Telecoms, Mobile, Broadband and Digital Media - Statistics and Analyses - BuddeComm|website=www.budde.com.au}}</ref>\n\n=== Gender digital divide ===\nNearly 30% of women are less likely to have access to a mobile device in Myanmar.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Irex|first1=Irex|title=Ending the Gender Digital Divide in Myanmar|url=https://www.irex.org/sites/default/files/node/resource/overview-gender-digital-divide-myanmar-assessment.pdf|website=Irex.org|publisher=IREX|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref> The cell phone is the main source of internet access in the country.

Internet access in Pakistan began in the 1990s and has continued to grow over the past decades. In fact, Pakistan has about 32 million internet users. However, according to data collected by the World Bank, Pakistan has an overall population of about 193 million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=PK|title=Population, total - Data|website=data.WorldBank.org|access-date=6 January 2018}}</ref> In addition, Pakistan also has about 15 million people who access the internet from their mobile devices. Pakistan has 5 broadband internet providers and 10 DSL. Broadband use through computers is the number one way that people access the internet in Pakistan. The second most popular way that people of Pakistan access the internet is through their cellular devices. Even though there are about 32 million internet user compared to a large population, [[Internet in Pakistan#cite note-1|Internet in Pakistan]] is ranked 20th in the world.\n\n===Cell phone coverage===\nPakistan has five major cell phone providers. The five are (in order from most to fewest subscribers): [[Jazz (mobile network)|Jazz]] 51.88 million; Telenor 39.37 million; Zong 27.71 million; Ufone 18.46 million; and Warid 12 million.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Recently in May 2017, the Pakistani government decided to lower tariffs and taxes on cellular services as well as on mobile phones. The reasons for this decision included years of pressure from the nation's top mobile operators and a [[World Bank]] report pointing out [[Pakistan]]'s high taxing of telecom services in the region.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mobileworldlive.com/asia/asia-news/pakistan-to-cut-taxes-on-mobile-services-handsets/|title=Pakistan to cut taxes on mobile services, handsets - Mobile World Live|date=2017-05-29|work=Mobile World Live|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n===Gender and caste===\nIn rural Pakistan, cell service use is divided along gender lines. Karin Astrid Siegmann pointed out this disparity; 40 percent of female users have to ask permission from the male owners to make calls. Cell phones being in the hands of females is viewed unfavorably in Pakistani culture. According to one participant in the study, from the [[Muzaffargarh|Muzzafargarh]] district in rural Pakistan, \"Women don't even know how to dial a number.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan038260.pdf|title=The Gender Digital Divide in Rural Pakistan: How wide is it & how to bridge it?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Additionally, the percentage of women owning a cell phone is 36% compared to men at 78% overall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gallup.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Weekend-Read-42-Mobile-Phone-Usage-and-Access-in-Pakistan-by-Abdullah-Waqar-Tajwar2.pdf|title=Gallup Pakistan History Project's Weekend Read 42: Mobile Phone Usage and Access in Pakistan: An Analysis of Trends in 2015 and 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBesides gender, there is a distinct divide among [[caste]]s. Newer castes rank much more highly on the [[Digital Access Index]] (DAI) than do the older castes. The same study compared two political parties. One political party, called the [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf|PTI]] ([[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]]), was composed of newer castes [[Khan (caste)|(Khan]], [[Hashmi]], [[Alvi]], and [[Qureshi]]). The [[Muslim League (Pakistan)|Muslim League]] is composed of older castes. The PTI outperformed the Pakistan Muslim League in number of foreign visitors to its web site, with a combined percentage of 12.7%, and in websites linking to it with 450, compared to the Muslim League's 168 (See Table 6 page 354). Ahsan Abdullah elaborates the important background of these findings: \"Members of the new caste traditionally have not been farmers; for example, members of the [[Sheikh caste|Sheikh]] caste are traditionally traders, and members of the [[Syed]] caste traditionally hold religious offices, and hence they have to be better educated as compared to the old caste members. The old caste members, who are traditionally farmers, require tacit knowledge more than education to be successful. This observation is supported by the higher literacy rate in new castes as compared to the old caste members, with [[Pathan]], Sheikh, and Syed being the top three educated castes among the 12 castes considered.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=15&sid=a768fe68-af9d-44eb-af35-d77ac5d19ee3%40sessionmgr103|title=Digital Divide and Caste in Rural Pakistan|last=Abdullah|first=Ahsan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105095431/http://libezp.lib.lsu.edu/login?url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=15&sid=a768fe68-af9d-44eb-af35-d77ac5d19ee3@sessionmgr103|archive-date=2020-01-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Solutions===\nBesides Private efforts, Public efforts put forth by the Pakistani government would help bridge the digital divide.

This prompted major school reforms and in 2012, a K-12 school curriculum was introduced which included a year of kindergarten and two senior school years. The Department of Education in the Philippines (DepEd) goal for students who graduate from the K-12 curriculum is for these students to understand technology works and how they can benefit from it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wenr.wes.org/2015/06/education-philippines|title=Education in the Philippines|last1=Clark|first1=Nick|website=World Education News & Reviews|accessdate=12 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe curriculum of this program focuses on developing students to be comfortable with using computers and technology. Some examples are that in grade 4 students will learn how to use the basic functions of the computer, including the use of the internet and emailing, in safe ways. In grade 6, students will begin taking art classes to learn how to use technology for digital paintings and graphic designs. In grade 7, students will begin learning how to academically use the internet for journals and searching for academic sources for essays and other similar assignments. In the higher upper level grades, the curriculum will include schools that specialize in computer education as well as science and technology. The Philippines being able to close in on the technology gap after being so behind in the 1990s and early 2000s is going to very much improve the graduation rate of the students now that they can study at home and use their sources to their advantage through tablets and computers instead of only being able to access their school work in the classroom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/education-and-home/2015/07/30/1482483/technology-k-12|title=Technology in K to 12|last1=Cruz|first1=Isagani|website=Philippine Star|accessdate=12 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Saudi Arabia ==\nThe digital divide in Saudi Arabia is seen through their Internet usage statistics 47.5% of Saudi Arabians use the internet compared to 78.2% of the United States.

Their Facebook keeps people up to date with computer related news and other helpful programs in South Africa.\n\n== South Korea ==\n{{see also|Internet in South Korea}}\nThe digital divide in South Korea is mainly caused by the unevenness of economic, regional, physical, or social opportunities, leading to marginalized persons not receiving the benefits that technology can bring. The lack of adaptation to the [[informatization]] of social services, such as administration and welfare, results in limited opportunities for basic daily life and social participation. South Korea's information gap was initially due to economic reasons and the difference in the initial cost for using the Internet or PC, but recently there has been a gap between the users of the information according to the degree of utilization of information.<ref>{{cite web|title=\uc815\ubcf4\uaca9\ucc28(Digital Divide)|url=http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&MAS_IDX=101013000769848|website=DooSan Dictionary|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref> As the information society rapidly developed, the distribution of the Internet quickly accelerated in Korea, dividing people into two groups, people who are well adapted to the changes and those who are more familiar with the previous media.

It is the tenth installment in the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' film series]]. It introduces his futuristic counterpart, Uber Jason.\n\nConceived by Todd Farmer as the only pitch he gave to the studio, suggesting sending Jason into space as a means to advance the film series.<ref name=\"Bryan Cairns\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/04/23/an-interview-with-jason-x-writer-todd-farmer|title=An Interview with Jason X Writer Todd Farmer|author=Cairns|first=Bryan|website=[[IGN]]|url-status=live|accessdate=April 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''Jason X'' was theatrically released in the U.S. on April 26, 2002, grossing $17 million on a budget of $11\u201314 million and received negative reviews from critics. It is followed by ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'', a crossover with the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' film series]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the year 2010, [[Jason Voorhees]] ([[Kane Hodder]]) is captured by the United States government and held at the Crystal Lake Research Facility. Government scientist [[Rowan LaFontaine]] ([[Lexa Doig]]) decides to place Jason in frozen stasis after several failed attempts to kill him. While Pvt. Samuel Johnson (Jeff Geddis) places a blanket on Jason, Dr. Wimmer ([[David Cronenberg]]), Sgt. Marcus (Markus Parilo), and a few soldiers hope to further research Jason's rapid cellular regeneration and try to take Jason. They pull off the blanket covering his body, but find Johnson dead, instead. Having broken free of his restraints, Jason kills the soldiers and Wimmer. Rowan lures Jason into a cryogenic pod and activates it. Jason then ruptures the pod with his machete and stabs Rowan in the abdomen, spilling cryogenic fluid into the sealed room and freezing them both.\n\n445 years later (2455), Earth has become too polluted to support life and humans have moved to a new planet, Earth Two. Three students, Tsunaron ([[Chuck Campbell]]), Janessa ([[Melyssa Ade]]), and Azrael ([[Dov Tiefenbach]]), are on a field trip led by Prof. Braithwaite Lowe ([[Jonathan Potts]]), who is accompanied by an [[Android (robot)|android]], KM-14 ([[Lisa Ryder]]). They enter the Crystal Lake facility and find the still-frozen Jason and Rowan, whom they bring to their spaceship, the ''Grendel''. Also on the ship are Lowe's remaining students, Kinsa (Melody Johnson), Waylander (Derwin Jordan), and Stoney ([[Yani Gellman]]). They reanimate Rowan while Jason is pronounced dead and left in the morgue. Lowe's intern, Adrienne ([[Kristi Angus]]), is ordered to [[Dissection|dissect]] Jason's body. Lowe, who is in serious debt, calls his financial backer Dieter Perez ([[Robert A. Silverman]]), of the ''Solaris'', who recognizes Jason's name and notes that Jason's body could be worth a substantial amount to a collector.\n\nWhile Stoney and Kinsa are having sex, Jason thaws out and attacks Adrienne, then freezes her face with [[liquid nitrogen]] before smashing her head to pieces on a counter. Jason takes a machete-shaped surgical tool and makes his way through the ship. He stabs Stoney in the chest and drags him to his death, to Kinsa's horror. Sgt. Brodski ([[Peter Mensah]]) leads a group of soldiers to attack Jason. Meanwhile, Jason attacks and kills Dallas by bashing his skull against the wall after breaking Azrael's back. He then tries to attack Crutch, but Brodski and his soldiers save him. Jason disappears; after Brodski splits up his team, Jason kills them one by one.\n\nLowe orders pilot Lou ([[Boyd Banks]]) to dock in on ''Solaris'', a nearby [[space station]]. As he is talking with the ''Solaris'' engineer, he is hacked apart by Jason. With no pilot, the ship crashes through ''Solaris'', destroying it, and killing Dieter Perez and everyone else on the ''Solaris''. The crash damages one of the Grendel's pontoon sections. Jason breaks into the lab, reclaims his machete and [[Decapitation|decapitates]] Lowe.\n\nWith the ship badly damaged, the remaining survivors head for ''Grendel''{{'}}s shuttle, while Tsunaron heads elsewhere with KM-14. After finding Lou's remains, Crutch (Philip Williams) and Waylander prepare the shuttle. Rowan finds Brodski, but he is too heavy for her to carry, so she leaves to get help. Waylander leaves to help with him, while Crutch prepares the shuttle. Jason kills Crutch by electrocution. On board the shuttle, Kinsa hears of Crutch's death and has a [[panic attack]]. She attempts to escape alone and leave everyone else for dead by launching the shuttle but forgets to release the fuel line, causing it to crash into the ship's hull and explode, killing her. Tsunaron reappears with an upgraded KM-14, complete with an array of weapons and new combat skills. KM-14 cartwheels and fights Jason off and seemingly kills him, knocking him into a [[Nanotechnology|nanite]]-equipped medical station and blasting off his right arm, left leg, right rib cage, and, finally, part of his head. The survivors send a distress call and receive a reply from a patrol shuttle.\n\nThe survivors set explosive charges to separate the remaining pontoon from the main drive section. As they work, Jason is accidentally brought back to life by the damaged medical station, rebuilt as an even more powerful [[cyborg]]. Jason easily defeats KM-14 by punching her head off. As Tsunaron picks up her still-functioning head, Jason attacks them but is stopped by Waylander, who sacrifices himself by setting off the charges while the others escape. Jason survives and is blown back onto the shuttle. He punches a hole through the hull, [[Space exposure|blowing out]] Janessa. A power failure with the docking door forces Brodski to go [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] to fix it.\n\nMeanwhile, a hard light [[Virtual reality|holographic simulation]] of Crystal Lake is created to distract Jason, along with two virtual teenagers to distract him, which works at first but he sees through the deception just as the door is fixed. Brodski confronts Jason so that the rest can escape. As they leave, the pontoon explodes, propelling Jason at high speed towards the survivors; however, Brodski intercepts Jason in mid-flight and maneuvers them both into the atmosphere of Earth Two, [[Atmospheric re-entry|incinerating]] them. Tsunaron, Rowan, and KM-14 celebrate having escaped successfully, and Tsunaron assures KM-14 that he will build a new body for her.\n\nOn Earth Two, a pair of teenagers beside a lake see what they believe is a [[Meteor|falling star]] as Jason's charred mask sinks to the bottom of the lake. The teenagers go to investigate.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kane Hodder]] as [[Jason Voorhees|Jason Voorhees/Uber Jason]]\n* [[Lexa Doig]] as [[Rowan LaFontaine]]\n* [[Lisa Ryder]] as KM-14\n* [[Chuck Campbell]] as Tsunaron Peyton\n* [[Melyssa Ade]] as Janessa Zachary\n* [[Peter Mensah]] as Sgt.

It is followed by ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'', a crossover with the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' film series]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the year 2010, [[Jason Voorhees]] ([[Kane Hodder]]) is captured by the United States government and held at the Crystal Lake Research Facility. Government scientist [[Rowan LaFontaine]] ([[Lexa Doig]]) decides to place Jason in frozen stasis after several failed attempts to kill him. While Private Samuel Johnson (Jeff Geddis) places a blanket on Jason, Dr. Wimmer ([[David Cronenberg]]), Sergeant Marcus (Markus Parilo), and a few soldiers hope to further research Jason's rapid cellular regeneration and try to take Jason. They pull off the blanket covering his body, but find Johnson dead, instead. Having broken free of his restraints, Jason kills the soldiers and Wimmer. Rowan lures Jason into a cryogenic pod and activates it. Jason then ruptures the pod with his machete and stabs Rowan in the abdomen, spilling cryogenic fluid into the sealed room and freezing them both.\n\n445 years later (2455), Earth has become too polluted to support life and humans have moved to a new planet, Earth Two. Three students, Tsunaron ([[Chuck Campbell]]), Janessa ([[Melyssa Ade]]), and Azrael ([[Dov Tiefenbach]]), are on a field trip led by Professor Braithwaite Lowe ([[Jonathan Potts]]), who is accompanied by an [[Android (robot)|android]], KM-14 ([[Lisa Ryder]]). They enter the Crystal Lake facility and find the still-frozen Jason and Rowan, whom they bring to their spaceship, the ''Grendel''. Also on the ship are Lowe's remaining students, Kinsa (Melody Johnson), Waylander (Derwin Jordan), and Stoney ([[Yani Gellman]]). They reanimate Rowan while Jason is pronounced dead and left in the morgue. Lowe's intern, Adrienne Thomas ([[Kristi Angus]]), is ordered to [[Dissection|dissect]] Jason's body. Lowe, who is in serious debt, calls his financial backer Dieter Perez ([[Robert A. Silverman]]), of the ''Solaris'', who recognizes Jason's name and notes that Jason's body could be worth a substantial amount to a collector.\n\nWhile Stoney and Kinsa are having sex, Jason thaws out and attacks Adrienne, then freezes her face with [[liquid nitrogen]] before smashing her head to pieces on a counter. Jason takes a machete-shaped surgical tool and makes his way through the ship. He stabs Stoney in the chest and drags him to his death, to Kinsa's horror. Sergeant Brodski ([[Peter Mensah]]) leads a group of soldiers to attack Jason. Meanwhile, Jason attacks and kills Dallas by bashing his skull against the wall after breaking Azrael's back. He then tries to attack Crutch, but Brodski and his soldiers save him. Jason disappears; after Brodski splits up his team, Jason kills them one by one.\n\nLowe orders Pilot Lou ([[Boyd Banks]]) to dock in on ''Solaris'', a nearby [[space station]]. As he is talking with the ''Solaris'' engineer, he is hacked apart by Jason. With no pilot, the ship crashes through ''Solaris'', destroying it, and killing Dieter Perez and everyone else on the ''Solaris''. The crash damages one of the Grendel's pontoon sections. Jason breaks into the lab, reclaims his machete and [[Decapitation|decapitates]] Lowe.\n\nWith the ship badly damaged, the remaining survivors head for ''Grendel''{{'}}s shuttle, while Tsunaron heads elsewhere with KM-14. After finding Lou's remains, Crutch (Philip Williams) and Waylander prepare the shuttle. Rowan finds Brodski, but he is too heavy for her to carry, so she leaves to get help. Waylander leaves to help with him, while Crutch prepares the shuttle. Jason kills Crutch by electrocution. On board the shuttle, Kinsa hears of Crutch's death and has a [[panic attack]]. She attempts to escape alone and leave everyone else for dead by launching the shuttle but forgets to release the fuel line, causing it to crash into the ship's hull and explode, killing her. Tsunaron reappears with an upgraded KM-14, complete with an array of weapons and new combat skills. KM-14 cartwheels and fights Jason off and seemingly kills him, knocking him into a [[Nanotechnology|nanite]]-equipped medical station and blasting off his right arm, left leg, right rib cage, and, finally, part of his head. The survivors send a distress call and receive a reply from a patrol shuttle.\n\nThe survivors set explosive charges to separate the remaining pontoon from the main drive section. As they work, Jason is accidentally brought back to life by the damaged medical station, rebuilt as an even more powerful [[cyborg]]. Jason easily defeats KM-14 by punching her head off. As Tsunaron picks up her still-functioning head, Jason attacks them but is stopped by Waylander, who sacrifices himself by setting off the charges while the others escape. Jason survives and is blown back onto the shuttle. He punches a hole through the hull, [[Space exposure|blowing out]] Janessa. A power failure with the docking door forces Brodski to go [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] to fix it.\n\nMeanwhile, a hard light [[Virtual reality|holographic simulation]] of Crystal Lake is created to distract Jason, along with two virtual teenagers to distract him, which works at first but he sees through the deception just as the door is fixed. Brodski confronts Jason so that the rest can escape. As they leave, the pontoon explodes, propelling Jason at high speed towards the survivors; however, Brodski intercepts Jason in mid-flight and maneuvers them both into the atmosphere of Earth Two, [[Atmospheric re-entry|incinerating]] them. Tsunaron, Rowan, and KM-14 celebrate having escaped successfully, and Tsunaron assures KM-14 that he will build a new body for her.\n\nOn Earth Two, a pair of teenagers beside a lake see what they believe is a [[Meteor|falling star]] as Jason's charred mask sinks to the bottom of the lake. The teenagers go to investigate.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kane Hodder]] as [[Jason Voorhees|Jason Voorhees / Uber Jason]]\n* [[Lexa Doig]] as [[Rowan LaFontaine]]\n* [[Lisa Ryder]] as Kay-Em 14\n* [[Chuck Campbell]] as Tsunaron\n* [[Melyssa Ade]] as Janessa\n* [[Peter Mensah]] as Sergeant Brodski\n* Melody Johnson as Kinsa\n* Derwin Jordan as Waylander\n* [[Jonathan Potts]] as Professor Brandon Lowe\n* Phillip Williams as Crutch\n* [[Dov Tiefenbach]] as Azrael\n* [[Kristi Angus]] as Adrienne Thomas\n* Dylan Bierk as Briggs\n* [[Amanda Brugel]] as Geko\n* [[Yani Gellman]] as Stoney\n* [[Todd Farmer]] as Dallas\n* [[David Cronenberg]] as Dr. Wimmer\n* [[Robert A.
