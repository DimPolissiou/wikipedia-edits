It served in the eastern theater, predominantly in the [[VI Corps (ACW)|VI Corps]], [[Army of the Potomac]], from July 1861 to July 1865. It was a member of the [[Vermont Brigade]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Colonel Breed Noyes Hyde (1831-1918) of the 3rd Vermont Infantry.jpg|thumb|Colonel Breed Noyes Hyde of the 3rd Vermont Infantry]]\nIn July 1861, the [[United States Congress]] authorized President [[Abraham Lincoln]] to call out 500,000 men, to serve for three years unless sooner discharged. The 3rd Vermont Infantry was the second of the three years regiments from the state placed in the field as a result of this call. It was organized from militia companies from [[Springfield, Vermont|Springfield]], [[Coventry, Vermont|Coventry]], [[Newbury (town), Vermont|Newbury (Wells River)]], [[Charleston, Vermont|Charleston]], [[Johnson, Vermont|Johnson]], [[Hartford, Vermont|Hartford]], [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|St.Johnsbury]], [[St. Albans (city), Vermont|St. Albans]], [[Guildhall, Vermont|Guidhall]], and [[East Montpelier, Vermont|East Montpelier]] and [[Calais, Vermont|Calais]].\n\nGovernor [[Erastus Fairbanks]]' first choices to command the regiment were Colonel [[John W. Phelps]], soon to relinquish his command of the [[1st Vermont Infantry]], Captain [[Truman Seymour]], 4th U.S. Artillery, a native Vermonter who had been present at the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]], and Captain A. V. Colburn, U.S. Army, who later became Assistant Adjutant General of the [[Army of the Potomac]] under General [[George B. McClellan]]. Phelps, however, was serving as commandant of the post at [[Newport News, Virginia]], and the offers to Seymour and Colburn were declined.\n\nThe regiment rendezvoused at St. Johnsbury, on the ground of the [[Caledonia County]] Agricultural Society at \"Camp Baxter,\" named in honor of Adjutant and Inspector General [[H. Henry Baxter]]. The regiment mustered into United States service on July 16, 1861, and departed for [[Washington, D.C.]] on July 24, under the temporary command of Lieutenant Colonel [[Breed N. Hyde]]. At [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the regiment's commander, Colonel [[William Farrar Smith]], joined them.\n\nThe regiment arrived in Washington, D.C. on July 25, 1861, and on July 27, marched up the Potomac to the [[Chain Bridge (Potomac River)|Chain Bridge]], where they built \"[[Fort Lyon (Virginia)|Camp Lyon]].\" They joined at that site the [[6th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|6th Maine Infantry]], [[Mott's Battery]] and a company of cavalry. By August 12, the [[2nd Vermont Infantry]] and the [[33rd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|33rd New York Infantry]] had joined them. \n\nMajor [[Walter W. Cochran]], of [[Bellows Falls]], resigned his commission on August 6 due to a severe attack of fever and ague. Captain [[Wheelock G. Veazey]], of Company A, replaced him. On August 13, Colonel Smith was appointed [[brigadier general]] of volunteers, and Hyde replaced him, now as a full colonel. Veazey was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and Captain [[Thomas O. Seaver]], of Company F, was promoted to major. \n\n[[File:William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel).jpg|thumb|Private [[William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel)|William Scott]] of Groton, Vt., better known as [[The Sleeping Sentinel]].]]\nIt was also here that Private [[William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel)|William Scott]], known to history as [[the Sleeping Sentinel]], was found asleep at his post on August 31, court-martialed, and sentenced to be executed.  President Lincoln heard about the case, pardoned Scott, and returned him to his unit. William Scott was actually standing before a firing squad when the death sentence and pardon were both read, however no one had told him that he had been pardoned prior to being sent to the firing squad.  Scott later was killed in action at the [[Battle of Lee's Mills]].\n\nOn September 3, the units crossed the Chain Bridge, and occupied \"Camp Advance,\" {{convert|1|mi}} in advance of the bridge.  On September 9, Private Scott was scheduled to be executed, but during the proceedings, after the death sentence had been read, a pardon was read, sparing his life. In 1997, the original court-martial and pardon papers were discovered, and authenticated, bringing to an end the controversy over whether President Lincoln had personally signed the pardon, which it turned out he did.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/10/news/asleep-at-his-post-to-be-shot.html]</ref> Scott served faithfully with his regiment until the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], where he was mortally wounded, and was buried in the [[Colonial National Historical Park|national cemetery at Yorktown]].\n\nOn September 11, the regiment participated in a reconnaissance to and beyond [[Lewinsville, Virginia]], where it engaged Confederate skirmishers. Returning to the camp, the regiment came under fire from Rosser's battery. A shell fell within the ranks of Company C, killing Private Amos Meserve, mortally wounding William H. Colburn, and injuring five others. On September 25, the regiment participated in another reconnaissance to Lewinsville, but suffered no casualties. Quartermaster [[Redfield Proctor]] resigned from the regiment on this date to accept appointment as Major of the [[5th Vermont Infantry]].\n\nDuring the next two weeks, the 4th and 5th Vermont regiments joined Smith's division. On October 9, the Vermont regiments moved to Camp Griffin, about four miles from Chain Bridge. Here, on October 24, the [[6th Vermont Infantry]] arrived, completing the initial organization of the \"Old [[Vermont Brigade]].\" \n\nThe history of the regiment from this point on is essentially that of the [[Vermont Brigade]].\n\nThe original members of the regiment, who did not reenlist, were mustered out of the service on July 27, 1864. Veterans and recruits were consolidated into six companies, July 25, 1864. One year recruits and others whose term of service was due to expire prior to October 1, 1865, were mustered out on June 19, 1865. The remaining officers and men mustered out of service on July 11.\n\n==Medal of Honor==\n\nSix members of the regiment were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].\n\n* Alexander M. Beattie, Captain, Co. F, \" removed, under a hot fire, a wounded member of his command to a place of safety,\" at the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]], June 5, 1864.\n* Gardner C. Hawkins, 1st Lieutenant, Co.

Its home games are played at [[Modern Woodmen Park]] (formerly John O'Donnell Stadium) in [[Davenport, Iowa]], one of the [[Quad Cities]].\n\n==History==\nBeginning in 1879, Quad City area professional baseball has a history that includes three teams.  Davenport, Moline ([[Moline Plowboys]]) and Rock Island ([[Rock Island Islanders]]) all have hosted [[minor league baseball]] teams. A fourth area team played in nearby [[Kewanee, Illinois]]. The 1879 Davenport Brown Stockings, with [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Bid McPhee]],  finished 5-15 in the Northwestern League. The Brown Stockings played with the Dubuque Red Stockings, Omaha Green Stockings and Rockford White Stockings, before the Northwestern League folded after one season. The Davenport Onion Weeders (1888), Davenport Hawkeyes (1889) and Davenport Pilgrims (1891) played before the turn of the 20th century in the [[Western Association]] (1888), [[Central Interstate League]] (1889) and the [[Illinois-Iowa League]] (1891).<ref name=\"baseball-reference\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/ |title=Minor League Baseball History |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/league.cgi?id=9db35b65|title=1879 Northwestern League|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/minorbaseball/l-NWES1/y-1879|title=1879 Northwestern League (NL) on StatsCrew.com|website=www.statscrew.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Northwestern_League|title=Northwestern League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Western_Association|title=Western Association - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1901, the [[Illinois\u2013Indiana\u2013Iowa League]] or \"Three-I League\" was founded, with the Davenport River Rats and Rock Island Islanders as charter members. This Davenport team set the foundation of the franchise that exists today. Other charter members of the 1901 Three-I League were the [[Bloomington Blues]], [[Cedar Rapids Rabbits]], [[Decatur Commodores]], [[Evansville River Rats]], Rockford Red Sox and [[Terre Haute Hottentots]]. The Davenport franchise changed monikers frequently in the early years, playing as the Davenport River Rats (1901\u201304), Davenport Riversides (1905), Davenport  Knickerbockers (1906), Davenport  Prodigals (1909\u201312) and [[Davenport Blue Sox]] (1913\u20131916). The Davenport Blue Sox won the 1914 Three-I League Championship.\n<ref name=\"baseball-reference\" />\n\nThe third Quad City area team was added In July, 1914. The [[Danville Speakers]] of the Three-I League relocated to Moline and the [[Moline Plowboys]] were established. The Moline Plowboys won Three-I League Championships in 1915, 1921 and 1937. A fourth area team, the nearby [[Kewanee Boilermakers]], were members of the Class C [[Central Association]] (1908-1913 and 1948-1949). Kewanee won the 1949 Central Association Championship as the Kewanee A's, affiliates of the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] (1948-1949) after Moline relocated to Kewanee in mid-season 1948. The Moline Plowboys/Moline A's were affiliates of the [[Detroit Tigers]] (1922), [[St Louis Browns]] (1931\u201332), [[Chicago Cubs]] (1937\u201340) and the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] (1947\u201348).

Rock Island won the 1932 Championship in six games. Davenport defeated the Islanders to win the 1933 Championship in the final season of the Mississippi Valley League. The 1933 Blue Sox were led by Ed Hall's 151 RBI and [[Como Cotelle]]'s .407 average. The 1936 Blue Sox continued the strong decade, winning the 1936 [[Western League (1900\u20131958)|Western League]] Championship.<ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=fitzpa002joh John Fitzpatrick Minor League Statistics & History] Baseball-Reference.com</ref>\n\nThe 1933 Davenport Blue Sox were ranked in [[The National Baseball Association's top 100 minor league teams]] (#58).

The Davenport Cubs (1946-1947) rejoined the Class B [[Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League]] (Three-I League) as an affiliate of the [[Chicago Cubs]].

[[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Jim Bunning]] pitched for the 1951 Davenport Tigers and [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] announcer [[Milo Hamilton]] was the Tigers' announcer on radio. [[Harvey Kuenn]] played for the 1952 tigers, hitting .340. Kuehn was called up to the Detroit Tigers after the 1952 Davenport season ended.

They were replaced by the [[Peoria Chiefs]] in the 1953 Three-I League. Davenport remained without a team for four seasons. The 1957 Davenport DavSox (1957-1958) rejoined the Three-I League as an affiliate of the [[Chicago White Sox]] (1957-1958). The 1958 DavSox advanced to the Three-I Championship series, where they were defeated by the [[Cedar Rapids Braves]] 3  games to 2. The 1958 season would be the last for Davenport in the Three-I League.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/league.cgi?id=6003a38a |title=1959 Illinois\u2013Indiana\u2013Iowa League Statistics |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Three-I_League|title=Three-I League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Davenport_DavSox|title=Davenport DavSox - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\n===Midwest League:1960\u2013present===\nDespite finishing third in the league in attendance (61,522), the DavSox moved to [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] after the 1958 season to become the [[Lincoln Chiefs]] (who drew 44,783 in the 1959 Three-I League) . This left Davenport without a team for the 1959 season. As a result, local businessman Hugo \"Hooks\" Kohn started a drive to bring a new team to Davenport. Hooks Kohn was a local baseball enthusiast and a leading pioneer/player of \"Diamond Ball\", a Davenport game that evolved into today's [[softball]]. With Kohn heading the '''Quad City Baseball Fans Association''', a team was secured for the 1960 season as a [[Milwaukee Braves]] affiliate, with [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Travis Jackson]] to serve as the 1960 Manager. The Quad City Baseball Fans Association would oversee operation of the Davenport franchise from 1960 through 1986.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=https://qctimes.com/news/a-field-of-history/article_1f510730-2029-5b92-b576-1befeb2c0e36.html|title=A field of history|first=John Willard / QUAD-CITY|last=TIMES|website=The Quad-City Times}}</ref><ref>http://qctimes.com/sports/baseball/professional/minor/midwest-league/article_776f9300-55a4-11df-99bc-001cc4c03286.html Q-C reaches 50 years in the Midwest League]</ref><ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nThe 1960 [[Davenport Braves]] became a member of the fledgling [[Midwest League]], a partnership that has continued without interruption in seven decades.

The creation of the [[Midwest League]] essentially ended the Three-I, which folded after the 1961 season. In its long history, the Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League hosted teams in 31 cities.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/league.cgi?id=373abb77 1960 Midwest League Statistics] Baseball-Reference.com</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qctimes.com/sports/baseball/professional/minor/midwest-league/era-comes-to-close-for-q-c-minor-league-baseball/article_6bb44a98-44f1-11de-b57e-001cc4c002e0.html|title=Era comes to close for Q-C minor league baseball|first=Steve|last=Batterson|website=The Quad-City Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 1961, the franchise permanently dropped \"Davenport\" and became the \"Quad City\" Braves. In 1962, The Quad City Angels became an affiliate of the expansion [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles Angels]]. The affiliate change was occurred because Cedar Rapids, also a Braves affiliate, was one of six former Three-I teams that joined the Midwest League in 1962 when the Three-I folded. Thus began a lengthy frnchise affiliation with the Angels. The Quad City Angels of 1963 and 1964 were managed by [[Chuck Tanner]] and the 1964 Angels became the first Midwest League franchise to draw more than 100,000 fans in a season.

The franchise generally used the nickname of its major-league affiliate from 1946 through the 1991 season. This changed in 1992, when the team created its own nickname in a \"name the team' contest. The contest winning name was: \"Quad City River Bandits\" and from 1992 through the 2003 the team kept this name. On October 20, 2003, the team was renamed the \"Swing of the Quad Cities\"; after another \"name the team\" contest was held. However, On December 13, 2007, returned to the \"Quad Cities River Bandits\" after voters in a third contest chose the River Bandits name over \"The Swing\" and four other finalists: \"Channel Cats\", \"The Current\",  \"River Eagles\", and \"Talons.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Quad Cities River Bandits (press release)|title=The Fans Have Spoken: 'River Bandits' Returns to the Quad Cities|url=http://www.swingbaseball.com/news/story/4317/|date=2007-12-13}}</ref>\n\nThe renaming of the Bandits has proven to be one of sports\u2019 most successful rebranding campaigns \u2013 merchandise sales after the 2008 rebranding increased more than 400% (and were up an additional 34% in 2009), sponsorships jumped more than 64% in the first season, and CNBC named the team's logo one of the top eight in minor league baseball.\n\n[[File:Modern Woodmen Park 2.jpg|left|thumb|Modern Woodmen Park 2]]\n\n===History of franchise ownership===\nAfter success in securing a Midwest League Franchise for Davenport beginning with the 1960 season, the non-profit Quad City Baseball Fans Association continued to operate the franchise from 1960 to 1986. In 1986 [[Chicago]] businessman [[Harry H. Semrow]] purchased the team from the association for $350,000, but Semrow was forced to sell after the 1987 season due to poor health. \n\nRichard Holtzman, another Chicago businessman who owned as many as five minor league teams, purchased the franchise from Semrow and remained as owner from 1987 until 1998. In 1998, Holtzman sold the team to Seventh Inning Stretch, a company owned by Kevin Krause, a businessman out of [[Mason City, Iowa]], and son of [[Kum & Go]] co-founder William Krause.\n\nOn December 28, 2006, Krause agreed to sell the team to [[Florida]]-based Main Street Baseball for an undisclosed price; the sale was completed on November 29, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Batterson|title=Florida Group Buys Swing of Q-C|url=http://www.qctimes.com/articles/2006/12/29/news/local/doc4594b96650622371753668.txt|work=[[Quad-City Times]]|date=2006-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Swing of the Quad Cities (press release)|title=It's official: Main Street Iowa completes purchase of Swing|url=http://www.swingbaseball.com/news/story/4313/|date=2007-11-29}}</ref>\n\nUnder Main Street Baseball's ownership, led by Dave Heller and Bob Herrfeldt, the River Bandits sparked a stunning resurgence of baseball in the Quad Cities, winning league championships in 2011 and 2013, setting new attendance records and capturing numerous awards for their innovative promotions.<ref name=\"milb.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20071220&content_id=41529816&sid=t565&vkey=team4|title=Dave Heller's Bio &#124; Quad Cities River Bandits About<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>\n\nSince Heller and Herrfeldt took over the Bandits, sponsorship sales, suite sales, ticket sales, and concession sales have all seen annual increases. The team's average attendance in its first year under Main Street rose by more than 56%, the largest such increase in baseball, and has climbed to nearly 3,700 fans per game. The Bandits have also led one of sports' most successful rebranding campaigns \u2013 merchandise sales after the 2008 rebranding increased more than 400% (and were up an additional 34% in 2009!), sponsorships jumped more than 64% in the first season, and CNBC named the team's logo one of the top eight in minor league baseball.\n\nMain Street Baseball has also been a trail-blazer, having hired the Midwest League's only female general manager (Stefanie Brown) then hiring the only African-American GM in minor league baseball. The River Bandits have also consistently had more women in leadership positions than most any team in baseball, and are the only minor league club to have won back-to-back Diversity Economic Impact Engagement (DEIE) Scholarships from major league baseball since MLB started awarding them in 2012.\n\nThe River Bandits have been voted Best Family Entertainment by the Quad-City Times for each of the past five years and were recently voted by the River Cities Reader as \"The Best Place for An Inexpensive Date that Doesn't Look Like It.\" The team won the prestigious \"Golden Bobblehead\" award in 2013 for best charitable promotion in Minor League Baseball for its innovative \"Photo Jersey Auction\" to benefit Autism Awareness. It also won a \"Veeckie Award\" from ESPN in 2009 for best minor league promotion (\"Tattoo Night\") and the \"Promotion of the Year\" Award from Ballpark Digest the same year for the team's \"Mega-Candy Drop\", as well as a Gold Award from the U.S. Army for its community service. The team has also won repeated awards for Heller's creative TV and radio ads, which have repeatedly been recognized as among the best in the industry.<ref name=\"milb.com\"/>\n\n==The ballparks==\nEarly Davenport teams played Sunday games on Sullivan Island outside of town, presumably to avoid Sunday activity laws.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/venues/v-675|title=Fairgrounds Park in Davenport, IA history and teams on StatsCrew.com|website=www.statscrew.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Davenport teams of 1901\u20131916, ending with the Davenport Blue Sox, played at '''Davenport Base Ball Park'''.

The city preferred a [[Mississippi River]] riverfront location near downtown and a lighted stadium. Subsequently, the Davenport Levee Commission proposed a new, lighted, brick stadium along the Davenport riverfront.<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\"/><ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nOn May 26, 1931, the new Municipal Stadium opened. It is still the franchise ballpark today. With a site on the banks of the [[Mississippi River]], the new stadium was constructed entirely with local labor for a total construction cost $165,000. It had light towers (first night game was June 4, 1931) with the grandstand facing the Mississippi River. Municipal Stadium was fondly nicknamed \"The Muny.\" In 1971, Municipal Stadium was renamed '''John O'Donnell Stadium''' after the longtime sports editor of the ''[[Quad-City Times]]''. Over time, the ballpark has shown its unique view, versatility and staying power, continuing to host baseball today as [[Modern Woodmen Park]].<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\"/><ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mwlguide.com/cities/davenport/park.html |title=Davenport's Modern Woodmen Park |publisher=MWLguide.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.delcotimes.com/news/hallowed-grounds-top-classic-minor-league-ballparks/article_d088d232-1d57-5f3f-8ef9-d7c98e1712d3.html|title=Hallowed grounds: Top 10 classic minor league ballparks|first=The|last=Highwayman|website=The Delaware County Daily Times}}</ref>\n\nMany baseball events have been held at the Stadium through the years.

Pictures of the flooded stadium are plentiful in the news media. The [[Great Flood of 1993]] was especially damaging to the facility.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://qctimes.com/sports/baseball/professional/minor/floods-are-big-part-of-ballpark-s-legacy/article_97e8b50f-2990-5a31-be66-5d1190ec0f3c.html|title=Floods are big part of ballpark's legacy|first=Don|last=Doxsie|website=The Quad-City Times}}</ref>\n\nDesigned to combat the recurring and costly toll of flooding, a project was undertaken in 2004 to modernize and protect the facility in a joint effort of The River Bandits and the City of Davenport. The result was a massive redesign of the field and grounds at [[Modern Woodmen Park]]. The entire structure and field of the original 1931 stadium were redone. Only the exterior fa\u00e7ade of the old stadium remained, with concessions, concourses, level loge boxes, and seating areas being reconstructed. The improvements essentially created a new ballpark within the shell of the old park. The resulting 2004 renovations included a raised playing field; a slight shift of the playing field to better face the river; removal of the drive behind the outfield fence; the addition of a berm in the outfield and the addition of exterior brick/metal columns, put in place for decoration and also to hold portable flood walls to be inserted outside the stadium. The new protections secured and protected the facility during other major [[Mississippi River floods]] in 2008, 2011 and 2013. Before the 2004 renovations, flooding created financial and logistical problems, as the team was regularly forced to move \"home\" games to local facilities or other MWL venues such as [[Clinton, Iowa]], [[North Scott High School]], Brady Street Stadium or [[Black Hawk College]].<ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe ballpark has incorporated modern and creative features.

plays in the [[Midwest League]]. Its home games are played at [[Modern Woodmen Park]] (formerly John O'Donnell Stadium) in [[Davenport, Iowa]], one of the [[Quad Cities]].\n\n==History==\nBeginning in 1879, Quad City area professional baseball has a history that includes three teams.  Davenport, Moline ([[Moline Plowboys]]) and Rock Island ([[Rock Island Islanders]]) all have hosted [[minor league baseball]] teams. A fourth area team played in nearby [[Kewanee, Illinois]]. The 1879 Davenport Brown Stockings, with [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Bid McPhee]],  finished 5-15 in the Northwestern League. The Brown Stockings played with the Dubuque Red Stockings, Omaha Green Stockings and Rockford White Stockings, before the Northwestern League folded after one season. The Davenport Onion Weeders (1888), Davenport Hawkeyes (1889) and Davenport Pilgrims (1891) played before the turn of the 20th century in the [[Western Association]] (1888), [[Central Interstate League]] (1889) and the [[Illinois-Iowa League]] (1891).<ref name=\"baseball-reference\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/ |title=Minor League Baseball History |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/league.cgi?id=9db35b65|title=1879 Northwestern League|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/minorbaseball/l-NWES1/y-1879|title=1879 Northwestern League (NL) on StatsCrew.com|website=www.statscrew.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Northwestern_League|title=Northwestern League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Western_Association|title=Western Association - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1901, the [[Illinois\u2013Indiana\u2013Iowa League]] or \"Three-I League\" was founded, with the Davenport River Rats and Rock Island Islanders as charter members. This Davenport team set the foundation of the franchise that exists today. Other charter members of the 1901 Three-I League were the [[Bloomington Blues]], [[Cedar Rapids Rabbits]], [[Decatur Commodores]], [[Evansville River Rats]], Rockford Red Sox and [[Terre Haute Hottentots]]. The Davenport franchise changed monikers frequently in the early years, playing as the Davenport River Rats (1901\u201304), Davenport Riversides (1905), Davenport  Knickerbockers (1906), Davenport  Prodigals (1909\u201312) and [[Davenport Blue Sox]] (1913\u20131916). The Davenport Blue Sox won the 1914 Three-I League Championship.\n<ref name=\"baseball-reference\" />\n\nThe third Quad City area team was added In July, 1914. The [[Danville Speakers]] of the Three-I League relocated to Moline and the [[Moline Plowboys]] were established. The Moline Plowboys won Three-I League Championships in 1915, 1921 and 1937. A fourth area team, the nearby [[Kewanee Boilermakers]], were members of the Class C [[Central Association]] (1908-1913 and 1948-1949). Kewanee won the 1949 Central Association Championship as the Kewanee A's, affiliates of the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] (1948-1949) after Moline relocated to Kewanee in mid-season 1948. The Moline Plowboys/Moline A's were affiliates of the [[Detroit Tigers]] (1922), [[St Louis Browns]] (1931\u201332), [[Chicago Cubs]] (1937\u201340) and the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] (1947\u201348). The Rock Island Islanders were affiliates of the [[St. Louis Browns]] (1932) and [[Cincinnati Reds]] (1933).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Kewanee,_IL|title=Kewanee, IL - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Moline,_IL|title=Moline, IL - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Rock_Island_Islanders|title=Rock Island Islanders - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter folding in 1916, the Davenport Blue Sox resumed play in 1929. On May 26, 1931, the Davenport Blue Sox moved into newly built Municipal Stadium, nicknamed the \"Muny.\" The Davenport Blue Sox played in the [[Mississippi Valley League]] (1929\u20131933) and [[Western League (1900\u20131958)|Western League]] (1934\u20131937). The Blue Sox were an affiliate of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] (1936-1937).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Davenport_Blue_Sox|title=Davenport Blue Sox - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Rock Island Islanders and Davenport Blue Sox faced each other in the Mississippi Valley League Championship series in both 1932 and 1933. Rock Island won the 1932 Championship in six games. Davenport defeated the Islanders to win the 1933 Championship in the final season of the Mississippi Valley League. The 1933 Blue Sox were led by Ed Hall's 151 RBI and [[Como Cotelle]]'s .407 average. The 1936 Blue Sox continued the strong decade, winning the 1936 [[Western League (1900\u20131958)|Western League]] Championship.<ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=fitzpa002joh John Fitzpatrick Minor League Statistics & History] Baseball-Reference.com</ref>\n\nThe 1933 Davenport Blue Sox were ranked in the [[The National Baseball Association's top 100 minor league teams]] (#58).

The Rock Island Islanders franchise folded on July 7 1937. The Western League itself then folded after the season, leaving Davenport without a team until 1946. The Rock Island Islanders franchise never played again. The Moline A's (1947-1948) moved to become the [[Kewanee A's]] (1948-1949), who folded permanently along with the Central Association in 1949. Moline played home games at [[Browning Field]] and Rock Island at [[Douglas Park (Rock Island)|Douglas Park]].

This left Davenport without a team for the 1959 season. As a result, local businessman Hugo \"Hooks\" Kohn started a drive to bring a new team to Davenport. Hooks Kohn was a local baseball enthusiast and a leading pioneer/player of \"Diamond Ball\", a Davenport game that evolved into today's [[softball]].

In 1962, The Quad City Angels became an affiliate of the expansion [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles Angels]]. The affiliate change was occurred because Cedar Rapids, also a Braves affiliate, was one of six former Three-I teams that joined the Midwest League in 1962 when the Three-I folded. Thus began a lengthy frnchise affiliation with the Angels. The Quad City Angels of 1963 and 1964 were managed by [[Chuck Tanner]] and the 1964 Angels became the first Midwest League franchise to draw more than 100,000 fans in a season.

The contest winning name was: \"Quad City River Bandits\" and from 1992 through the 2003 the team kept this name. On October 20, 2003, the team was renamed the \"Swing of the Quad Cities\"; after another \"name the team\" contest was held. However, On December 13, 2007, returned to the \"Quad Cities River Bandits\" after voters in a third contest chose the River Bandits name over \"The Swing\" and four other finalists: \"Channel Cats\", \"The Current\",  \"River Eagles\", and \"Talons.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Quad Cities River Bandits (press release)|title=The Fans Have Spoken: 'River Bandits' Returns to the Quad Cities|url=http://www.swingbaseball.com/news/story/4317/|date=2007-12-13}}</ref>\n\nThe renaming of the Bandits has proven to be one of sports\u2019 most successful rebranding campaigns \u2013 merchandise sales after the 2008 rebranding increased more than 400% (and were up an additional 34% in 2009), sponsorships jumped more than 64% in the first season, and CNBC named the team's logo one of the top eight in minor league baseball.\n\n[[File:Modern Woodmen Park 2.jpg|left|thumb|Modern Woodmen Park 2]]\n\n===History of franchise ownership===\nAfter success in securing a Midwest League Franchise for Davenport beginning with the 1960 season, the non-profit Quad City Baseball Fans Association continued to operate the franchise from 1960 to 1986. In 1986 [[Chicago]] businessman [[Harry H. Semrow]] purchased the team from the association for $350,000, but Semrow was forced to sell after the 1987 season due to poor health. \n\nRichard Holtzman, another Chicago businessman who owned as many as five minor league teams, purchased the franchise from Semrow and remained as owner from 1987 until 1998. In 1998, Holtzman sold the team to Seventh Inning Stretch, a company owned by Kevin Krause, a businessman out of [[Mason City, Iowa]], and son of [[Kum & Go]] co-founder William Krause.\n\nOn December 28, 2006, Krause agreed to sell the team to [[Florida]]-based Main Street Baseball for an undisclosed price; the sale was completed on November 29, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Batterson|title=Florida Group Buys Swing of Q-C|url=http://www.qctimes.com/articles/2006/12/29/news/local/doc4594b96650622371753668.txt|work=[[Quad-City Times]]|date=2006-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Swing of the Quad Cities (press release)|title=It's official: Main Street Iowa completes purchase of Swing|url=http://www.swingbaseball.com/news/story/4313/|date=2007-11-29}}</ref>\n\nUnder Main Street Baseball's ownership, led by Dave Heller and Bob Herrfeldt, the River Bandits sparked a stunning resurgence of baseball in the Quad Cities, winning league championships in 2011 and 2013, setting new attendance records and capturing numerous awards for their innovative promotions.<ref name=\"milb.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20071220&content_id=41529816&sid=t565&vkey=team4|title=Dave Heller's Bio &#124; Quad Cities River Bandits About<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>\n\nSince Heller and Herrfeldt took over the Bandits, sponsorship sales, suite sales, ticket sales, and concession sales have all seen annual increases. The team's average attendance in its first year under Main Street rose by more than 56%, the largest such increase in baseball, and has climbed to nearly 3,700 fans per game. The Bandits have also led one of sports' most successful rebranding campaigns \u2013 merchandise sales after the 2008 rebranding increased more than 400% (and were up an additional 34% in 2009!), sponsorships jumped more than 64% in the first season, and CNBC named the team's logo one of the top eight in minor league baseball.\n\nMain Street Baseball has also been a trail-blazer, having hired the Midwest League's only female general manager (Stefanie Brown) then hiring the only African-American GM in minor league baseball. The River Bandits have also consistently had more women in leadership positions than most any team in baseball, and are the only minor league club to have won back-to-back Diversity Economic Impact Engagement (DEIE) Scholarships from major league baseball since MLB started awarding them in 2012.\n\nThe River Bandits have been voted Best Family Entertainment by the Quad-City Times for each of the past five years and were recently voted by the River Cities Reader as \"The Best Place for An Inexpensive Date that Doesn't Look Like It.\" The team won the prestigious \"Golden Bobblehead\" award in 2013 for best charitable promotion in Minor League Baseball for its innovative \"Photo Jersey Auction\" to benefit Autism Awareness. It also won a \"Veeckie Award\" from ESPN in 2009 for best minor league promotion (\"Tattoo Night\") and the \"Promotion of the Year\" Award from Ballpark Digest the same year for the team's \"Mega-Candy Drop\", as well as a Gold Award from the U.S. Army for its community service.

Subsequently, the Davenport Levee Commission proposed a new, lighted, brick stadium along the Davenport riverfront.<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\"/><ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nOn May 26, 1931, the new Municipal Stadium opened. It is still the franchise ballpark today. With a site on the banks of the [[Mississippi River]], the new stadium was constructed entirely with local labor for a total construction cost $165,000. It had light towers (first night game was June 4, 1931) with the grandstand facing the Mississippi River. Municipal Stadium was fondly nicknamed \"The Muny.\" In 1971, Municipal Stadium was renamed '''John O'Donnell Stadium''' after the longtime sports editor of the ''[[Quad-City Times]]''. Over time, the ballpark has shown its unique view, versatility and staying power, continuing to host baseball today as [[Modern Woodmen Park]].<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\"/><ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mwlguide.com/cities/davenport/park.html |title=Davenport's Modern Woodmen Park |publisher=MWLguide.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.delcotimes.com/news/hallowed-grounds-top-classic-minor-league-ballparks/article_d088d232-1d57-5f3f-8ef9-d7c98e1712d3.html|title=Hallowed grounds: Top 10 classic minor league ballparks|first=The|last=Highwayman|website=The Delaware County Daily Times}}</ref>\n\nMany baseball events have been held at the Stadium through the years.

The result was a massive redesign of the field and grounds at [[Modern Woodmen Park]]. The entire structure and field of the original 1931 stadium were redone. Only the exterior fa\u00e7ade of the old stadium remained, with concessions, concourses, level loge boxes, and seating areas being reconstructed. The improvements essentially created a new ballpark within the shell of the old park. The resulting 2004 renovations included a raised playing field; a slight shift of the playing field to better face the river; removal of the drive behind the outfield fence; the addition of a berm in the outfield and the addition of exterior brick/metal columns, put in place for decoration and also to hold portable flood walls to be inserted outside the stadium. The new protections secured and protected the facility during other major [[Mississippi River floods]] in 2008, 2011 and 2013. Before the 2004 renovations, flooding created financial and logistical problems, as the team was regularly forced to move \"home\" games to local facilities or other MWL venues such as [[Clinton, Iowa]], [[North Scott High School]], Brady Street Stadium or [[Black Hawk College]].<ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe ballpark has incorporated modern and creative features.

It was held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] on 12 August 1989. The match was contested by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], champions of the [[1988\u201389 Football League]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], who beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[1989 FA Cup Final|final]] of the [[1988\u201389 FA Cup]]. Watched by a crowd of 63,149, Liverpool won the match 1\u20130.\n\nThis was Arsenal's 10th Shield appearance and Liverpool's 14th. The two clubs had met in the [[Liverpool 0\u20132 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|last game of the previous season]], in a title decider at [[Anfield]] which Arsenal won 2\u20130 with a late goal from [[Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)|Michael Thomas]]. Both clubs also faced each other in the [[Makita International Tournament]] at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] the previous month; [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] won the match 1\u20130. Journalists previewing the game argued this year's Shield had lost its spectacle given Liverpool's recent successes in the event as well as the prospect of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] beating Liverpool for a third time.\n\nNew signing [[Glenn Hys\u00e9n]] made his competitive debut for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Ian Rush]] started ahead of fellow striker [[John Aldridge]]. For [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Gus Caesar]] replaced [[Steve Bould]] in the starting team. The only goal of the match came in the first half \u2013 a long ball from [[Barry Venison]] floated around the [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] defence and found [[Peter Beardsley]] in the penalty area to score. Afterwards [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] manager [[Kenny Dalglish]] spoke of his delight at his team's performance and the [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] was complimentary of his opponents.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]] was founded in 1908 as a successor to the [[Sheriff of London Charity Shield]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Abandonment of the Sheriff Shield |page=11 |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |date=19 April 1908}}</ref> It was a contest between the respective champions of the [[The Football League|Football League]] and [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], which then became an event for select teams of amateur and professional players by 1913.<ref>{{cite news |title=The F.A.

It was held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] on 12 August 1989. The match was contested by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], champions of the [[1988\u201389 Football League]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], who beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[1989 FA Cup Final|final]] of the [[1988\u201389 FA Cup]]. Watched by a crowd of 63,149, Liverpool won the match 1\u20130.\n\nThis was Arsenal's 10th Shield appearance and Liverpool's 14th. The two clubs had met in the [[Liverpool 0\u20132 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|last game of the previous season]], in a title decider at [[Anfield]] which Arsenal won 2\u20130 with a late goal from [[Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)|Michael Thomas]]. Both clubs also faced each other in the [[Makita International Tournament]] at Wembley the previous month; Arsenal won the match 1\u20130. Journalists previewing the game argued this year's Shield had lost its spectacle given Liverpool's recent successes in the event as well as the prospect of Arsenal beating Liverpool for a third time.\n\nNew signing [[Glenn Hys\u00e9n]] made his competitive debut for Liverpool and [[Ian Rush]] started ahead of fellow striker [[John Aldridge]]. For Arsenal, [[Gus Caesar]] replaced [[Steve Bould]] in the starting team. The only goal of the match came in the first half \u2013 a long ball from [[Barry Venison]] floated around the Arsenal defence and found [[Peter Beardsley]] in the penalty area to score. Afterwards Liverpool manager [[Kenny Dalglish]] spoke of his delight at his team's performance and the Arsenal manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] was complimentary of his opponents.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]] was founded in 1908 as a successor to the [[Sheriff of London Charity Shield]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Abandonment of the Sheriff Shield |page=11 |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |date=19 April 1908}}</ref> It was a contest between the respective champions of the [[The Football League|Football League]] and [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], which then became an event for select teams of amateur and professional players by 1913.<ref>{{cite news |title=The F.A.

{"title_page": "Computer forensics", "text_new": "{{ForensicScience|digital|image=Hard disk.jpg}}\n[[File:PersonalStorageDevices.agr.jpg|thumb|Computer forensics analysis is not limited only to computer media]]\n\n'''Computer forensics''' (also known as '''computer forensic science'''<ref name=\"noblett\"/>) is a branch of [[digital forensics|digital forensic science]] pertaining to evidence found in computers and digital [[storage media]]. The goal of computer forensics is to examine digital media in a forensically sound manner with the aim of identifying, preserving, recovering, analyzing and presenting facts and opinions about the digital information.\n\nAlthough it is most often associated  with the investigation of a wide variety of [[computer crime]], computer forensics may also be used in civil proceedings. The discipline involves similar techniques and principles to [[data recovery]], but with additional guidelines and practices designed to create a legal [[audit trail]].\n\nEvidence from computer forensics investigations is usually subjected to the same guidelines and practices of other digital evidence. It has been used in a number of high-profile cases and is becoming widely accepted as reliable within U.S. and European court systems.\n\n==Overview==\nIn the early 1980s personal computers became more accessible to consumers, leading to their increased use in criminal activity (for example, to help commit [[fraud]]). At the same time, several new \"computer crimes\" were recognized (such as [[Software cracking|cracking]]). The discipline of computer forensics emerged during this time as a method to recover and investigate [[digital evidence]] for use in court. Since then computer crime and computer related crime has grown, and has jumped 67% between 2002 and 2003.<ref name=leigland />  Today it is used to investigate a wide variety of crime, including [[child pornography]], fraud, [[espionage]], [[cyberstalking]], murder and rape. The discipline also features in civil proceedings as a form of information gathering (for example, [[Electronic discovery]])\n\nForensic techniques and expert knowledge are used to explain the current state of a ''digital artifact'', such as a computer system, storage medium (e.g. [[hard disk drive|hard disk]] or [[CD-ROM]]), or an [[electronic document]] (e.g. an email message or JPEG image).<ref name=\"cf-education\"/> The scope of a forensic analysis can vary from simple [[information retrieval]] to reconstructing a series of events. In a 2002 book, ''Computer Forensics'', authors Kruse and Heiser define computer forensics as involving \"the preservation, identification, extraction, documentation and interpretation of computer data\".<ref name=\"kruse\" /> They go on to describe the discipline as \"more of an art than a science\", indicating that forensic methodology is backed by flexibility and extensive domain knowledge. However, while several methods can be used to extract evidence from a given computer the strategies used by law enforcement are fairly rigid and lack the flexibility found in the civilian world.<ref name=gunsch />\n\n==Use as evidence==\nIn court, computer forensic evidence is subject to the usual requirements for [[digital evidence]]. This requires that information be authentic, reliably obtained, and admissible.<ref name=\"theadam\" /> Different countries have specific guidelines and practices for evidence recovery. In the [[United Kingdom]], examiners often follow [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] guidelines that help ensure the authenticity and integrity of evidence. While voluntary, the guidelines are widely accepted in British courts.\n\nComputer forensics has been used as evidence in [[criminal law]] since the mid-1980s, some notable examples include:<ref name=\"casey\" />\n* BTK Killer: [[Dennis Rader]] was convicted of a string of serial killings that occurred over a period of sixteen years. Towards the end of this period, Rader sent letters to the police on a floppy disk. [[Metadata]] within the documents implicated an author named \"Dennis\" at \"Christ Lutheran Church\"; this evidence helped lead to Rader's arrest.\n* [[Joseph E. Duncan III]]: A spreadsheet recovered from Duncan's computer contained evidence that showed him planning his crimes. Prosecutors used this to show [[Premeditated murder|premeditation]] and secure the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].<ref name=\"handbook\" />\n* [[Sharon Lopatka]]: Hundreds of emails on Lopatka's computer lead investigators to her killer, Robert Glass.<ref name=\"casey\" />\n* [[Einstein and Boyd v 357 LLC and the Corcoran Group, et al.|Corcoran Group]]: This case confirmed parties' duties to preserve [[digital evidence]] when [[litigation]] has commenced or is reasonably anticipated. Hard drives were analyzed by a computer forensics expert who could not find relevant emails the Defendants should have had.  Though the expert found no evidence of deletion on the hard drives, evidence came out that the defendants were found to have intentionally destroyed emails, and misled and failed to disclose material facts to the plaintiffs and the court.\n* [[Dr. Conrad Murray]]: Dr. Conrad Murray, the doctor of the deceased [[Michael Jackson]], was convicted partially by digital evidence on his computer.  This evidence included medical documentation showing lethal amounts of [[propofol]].\n\n==Forensic process==\n{{Main article|Digital forensic process}}\n[[File:Portable forensic tableau.JPG|thumb|A portable Tableau write blocker attached to a [[Hard Drive]]]]\n\nComputer forensic investigations usually follow the standard digital forensic process or phases which are acquisition, examination, analysis and reporting. Investigations are performed on static data (i.e. [[Disk imaging#Hard drive imaging|acquired images]]) rather than \"live\" systems. This is a change from early forensic practices where a lack of specialist tools led to investigators commonly working on live data.\n\n===Techniques===\nA number of techniques are used during computer forensics investigations and much has been written on the many techniques used by law enforcement in particular.\n\n;Cross-drive analysis\n: A forensic technique that correlates information found on multiple [[hard drive]]s. The process, still being researched, can be used to identify [[social networks]] and to perform [[anomaly detection]].<ref name=\"garfinkel\" /><ref name=\"nsf\" />\n\n;Live analysis{{anchor|Live analysis}}\n: The examination of computers from within the operating system using custom forensics or existing [[sysadmin tools]] to extract evidence. The practice is useful when dealing with [[Encrypting File System]]s, for example, where the encryption keys may be collected and, in some instances, the logical hard drive volume may be imaged (known as a live acquisition) before the computer is shut down.\n\n;Deleted files\n: A common technique used in computer forensics is the recovery of deleted files. Modern forensic software have their own tools for recovering or carving out deleted data.<ref name=\"exposed\" /> Most [[operating system]]s and [[file system]]s do not always erase physical file data, allowing investigators to reconstruct it from the physical [[disk sector]]s. [[File carving]] involves searching for known file headers within the disk image and reconstructing deleted materials.\n\n;[[Stochastic forensics]]\n:A method which uses [[stochastic]] properties of the computer system to investigate activities lacking digital artifacts. Its chief use is to investigate [[data theft]].\n\n;[[Steganography]]\n: One of the techniques used to hide data is via steganography, the process of hiding data inside of a picture or digital image. An example would be to hide [[child porn|pornographic images of children]] or other information that a given criminal does not want to have discovered. Computer forensics professionals can fight this by looking at the hash of the file and comparing it to the original image (if available.) While the image appears exactly the same, the hash changes as the data changes.<ref name=dunbar />\n\n===Volatile data===\nWhen seizing evidence, if the machine is still active, any information stored solely in [[Random access memory|RAM]] that is not recovered before powering down may be lost.<ref name=\"handbook\" /> One application of \"live analysis\" is to recover RAM data (for example, using Microsoft's [[COFEE]] tool, WinDD, [[WindowsSCOPE]]) prior to removing an exhibit.  CaptureGUARD Gateway bypasses Windows login for locked computers, allowing for the analysis and acquisition of physical memory on a locked computer.\n\nRAM can be analyzed for prior content after power loss, because the electrical charge stored in the memory cells takes time to dissipate, an effect exploited by the [[cold boot attack]]. The length of time that data is recoverable is increased by low temperatures and higher cell voltages. Holding unpowered RAM below \u221260&nbsp;\u00b0C helps preserve residual data by an order of magnitude, improving the chances of successful recovery. However, it can be impractical to do this during a field examination.<ref name=\"ColdBoot\" />\n\nSome of the tools needed to extract volatile data, however, require that a computer be in a forensic lab, both to maintain a legitimate chain of evidence, and to facilitate work on the machine. If necessary, law enforcement applies techniques to move a live, running desktop computer.  These include a [[mouse jiggler]], which moves the mouse rapidly in small movements and prevents the computer from going to sleep accidentally.  Usually, an [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) provides power during transit.\n\nHowever, one of the easiest ways to capture data is by actually saving the RAM data to disk.  Various file systems that have journaling features such as [[NTFS]] and [[ReiserFS]] keep a large portion of the RAM data on the main storage media during operation, and these page files can be reassembled to reconstruct what was in RAM at that time.<ref name=geiger />\n\n===Analysis tools===\n{{see also|List of digital forensics tools}}\n\nA number of open source and commercial tools exist for computer forensics investigation. Typical forensic analysis includes a manual review of material on the media, reviewing the Windows registry for suspect information, discovering and cracking passwords, keyword searches for topics related to the crime, and extracting e-mail and pictures for review.<ref name=\"casey\" />\n\n==Certifications==\nThere are several computer forensics certifications available, such as the ISFCE Certified Computer Examiner, Digital Forensics Investigation Professional (DFIP) and IACRB Certified Computer Forensics Examiner.\n\nThe top ''vendor independent'' certification (especially within EU) is considered the ['''CCFP''' - Certified Cyber Forensics Professional [https://www.isc2.org/ccfp/default.aspx]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/ccfp.do |title=CCFP Salaries surveys |publisher=ITJobsWatch |date= |accessdate=2017-06-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119005256/http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/ccfp.do |archive-date=2017-01-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOthers, worth to mention for USA or APAC are the:\nThe International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists) offers the [[Certified Computer Examiner]] program.\n\nThe International Society of Forensic Computer Examiners offers the [[Certified Computer Examiner]] program.\n\nAsian School of Cyber Laws offers international level certifications in Digital Evidence Analysis and in Digital Forensic Investigation.

This evidence included medical documentation showing lethal amounts of [[propofol]].\n\n==Forensic process==\n{{Main article|Digital forensic process}}\n[[File:Portable forensic tableau.JPG|thumb|A portable Tableau write blocker attached to a [[Hard Drive]]]]\n\nComputer forensic investigations usually follow the standard digital forensic process or phases which are acquisition, examination, analysis and reporting. Investigations are performed on static data (i.e. [[Disk imaging#Hard drive imaging|acquired images]]) rather than \"live\" systems. This is a change from early forensic practices where a lack of specialist tools led to investigators commonly working on live data.\n\n===Techniques===\nA number of techniques are used during computer forensics investigations and much has been written on the many techniques used by law enforcement in particular.\n\n;Cross-drive analysis\n: A forensic technique that correlates information found on multiple [[hard drive]]s. The process, still being researched, can be used to identify [[social networks]] and to perform [[anomaly detection]].<ref name=\"garfinkel\" /><ref name=\"nsf\" />\n\n;Live analysis{{anchor|Live analysis}}\n: The examination of computers from within the operating system using custom forensics or existing [[sysadmin tools]] to extract evidence. The practice is useful when dealing with [[Encrypting File System]]s, for example, where the encryption keys may be collected and, in some instances, the logical hard drive volume may be imaged (known as a live acquisition) before the computer is shut down.\n\n;Deleted files\n: A common technique used in computer forensics is the recovery of deleted files. Modern forensic software have their own tools for recovering or carving out deleted data.<ref name=\"exposed\" /> Most [[operating system]]s and [[file system]]s do not always erase physical file data, allowing investigators to reconstruct it from the physical [[disk sector]]s. [[File carving]] involves searching for known file headers within the disk image and reconstructing deleted materials.\n\n;[[Stochastic forensics]]\n:A method which uses [[stochastic]] properties of the computer system to investigate activities lacking digital artifacts. Its chief use is to investigate [[data theft]].\n\n;[[Steganography]]\n: One of the techniques used to hide data is via steganography, the process of hiding data inside of a picture or digital image. An example would be to hide [[child porn|pornographic images of children]] or other information that a given criminal does not want to have discovered. Computer forensics professionals can fight this by looking at the hash of the file and comparing it to the original image (if available.) While the image appears exactly the same, the hash changes as the data changes.<ref name=dunbar />\n\n===Volatile data===\nWhen seizing evidence, if the machine is still active, any information stored solely in [[Random access memory|RAM]] that is not recovered before powering down may be lost.<ref name=\"handbook\" /> One application of \"live analysis\" is to recover RAM data (for example, using Microsoft's [[COFEE]] tool, WinDD, [[WindowsSCOPE]]) prior to removing an exhibit.  CaptureGUARD Gateway bypasses Windows login for locked computers, allowing for the analysis and acquisition of physical memory on a locked computer.\n\nRAM can be analyzed for prior content after power loss, because the electrical charge stored in the memory cells takes time to dissipate, an effect exploited by the [[cold boot attack]]. The length of time that data is recoverable is increased by low temperatures and higher cell voltages. Holding unpowered RAM below \u221260&nbsp;\u00b0C helps preserve residual data by an order of magnitude, improving the chances of successful recovery. However, it can be impractical to do this during a field examination.<ref name=\"ColdBoot\" />\n\nSome of the tools needed to extract volatile data, however, require that a computer be in a forensic lab, both to maintain a legitimate chain of evidence, and to facilitate work on the machine. If necessary, law enforcement applies techniques to move a live, running desktop computer.  These include a [[mouse jiggler]], which moves the mouse rapidly in small movements and prevents the computer from going to sleep accidentally.  Usually, an [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) provides power during transit.\n\nHowever, one of the easiest ways to capture data is by actually saving the RAM data to disk.  Various file systems that have journaling features such as [[NTFS]] and [[ReiserFS]] keep a large portion of the RAM data on the main storage media during operation, and these page files can be reassembled to reconstruct what was in RAM at that time.<ref name=geiger />\n\n===Analysis tools===\n{{see also|List of digital forensics tools}}\n\nA number of open source and commercial tools exist for computer forensics investigation. Typical forensic analysis includes a manual review of material on the media, reviewing the Windows registry for suspect information, discovering and cracking passwords, keyword searches for topics related to the crime, and extracting e-mail and pictures for review.<ref name=\"casey\" />\n\n==Certifications==\nThere are several computer forensics certifications available, such as the ISFCE Certified Computer Examiner, Digital Forensics Investigation Professional (DFIP) and IACRB Certified Computer Forensics Examiner.\n\nThe top ''vendor independent'' certification (especially within EU) is considered the ['''CCFP''' - Certified Cyber Forensics Professional [https://www.isc2.org/ccfp/default.aspx]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/ccfp.do |title=CCFP Salaries surveys |publisher=ITJobsWatch |date= |accessdate=2017-06-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119005256/http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/ccfp.do |archive-date=2017-01-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOthers, worth to mention for USA or APAC are the:\nIACIS (the International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists) offers the [[Certified Computer Examiner|Certified Computer Forensic Examiner (CFCE)]] program.\n\nISFCS (the The International Society of Forensic Computer Examiners\u00ae) offers the [[Certified Computer Examiner|Certified Computer Examiner (CCE)]] program.\n\nAsian School of Cyber Laws offers international level certifications in Digital Evidence Analysis and in Digital Forensic Investigation.

It is a [[remake]] of the 1998 [[Japanese horror]] film ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]'', based on [[Ring (Suzuki novel)|the novel of the same name]] by [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|Koji Suzuki]]. Watts portrays a journalist who investigates a cursed videotape that seemingly kills the viewer seven days after watching it.\n\n''The Ring'' was released theatrically on October 18, 2002, and received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the atmosphere and Watts's performance. The film grossed over $249 million worldwide on a $48 million production budget, making it one of the highest-grossing horror remakes. It is the first installment of the [[The Ring (franchise)#American films|American ''Ring'' series]], and is followed by ''[[The Ring Two]]'' and ''[[Rings (2017 film)|Rings]]'', which were released in 2005 and 2017, respectively.\n\n''The Ring'' paved the way for English-language remakes of Asian horror films, such as ''[[The Grudge (2004 film)|The Grudge]]'', ''[[Dark Water (2005 film)|Dark Water]]'', ''[[Pulse (2006 film)|Pulse]]'', ''[[One Missed Call (2008 film)|One Missed Call]]'', ''[[The Eye (2008 film)|The Eye]]'', ''[[Shutter (2008 film)|Shutter]]'', ''[[Mirrors (2008 film)|Mirrors]]'', ''[[The Echo (2008 film)|The Echo]]'' and ''[[The Uninvited (2009 film)|The Uninvited]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Seattle]], teenagers Katie Embry and Becca Kotler discuss the legend of a cursed videotape; whoever watches it dies seven days later. Katie claims she watched the tape with three friends a week ago. Minutes later, Katie is killed by an unseen force, and Becca is institutionalized after witnessing it.\n\nAt Katie's funeral, her mother, Ruth, urges her sister Rachel Keller, a journalist, to investigate her daughter's death. Rachel lives with her young son Aidan, who possesses a degree of [[mediumship]]. Rachel learns Katie's friends all died on the same night, sporting disfigured appearances. Rachel travels to Shelter Mountain Inn where Katie stayed, discovering the rumoured cursed videotape. Renting the same cabin as Katie, Rachel watches the tape, which contains disturbing, gruesome imagery. Once the tape ends, Rachel receives a phone call from an unknown caller who whispers \u201cseven days\u201d.\n\nRachel recruits Noah Clay, her ex-boyfriend and Aidan's father, to study the tape, making a copy after he watches the original. Rachel begins to suffer supernatural symptoms as the week passes, haunted by a young girl with soaking wet hair. Investigation into the tape's imagery leads Rachel to Anna Morgan, a [[horse breeding|horse breeder]] from Moesko Island, who committed suicide after her prize-winning horses drowned themselves. Rachel catches Aidan watching the tape, and discovers Noah is suffering similar symptoms.\n\nLeaving Aidan in Ruth's care, Rachel travels to Moesko Island to speak to Anna's widower Richard. On the ferry journey, a horse is spooked by Rachel's presence, leaping to its death. Noah goes to Eola Psychiatric Hospital to view Anna's medical files. Both separately discover Anna had an adopted daughter, [[Sadako Yamamura|Samara]], who possessed an ability to [[thoughtography|psychically etch mental images]] onto surfaces and into minds, driving her parents mad. Rachel tries to speak with Richard about Samara, but he denies her existence.\n\nRachel speaks with Dr. Grasnik, the island's GP, who explains Samara was adopted due to Anna's [[infertility]], recommending them to admit her to Eola, assuming Samara is still there. Rachel sneaks into the Morgan farmhouse, watching a videotape of Samara in a psychotherapy session, who claims she has no control over her abilities. Rachel confronts Richard, who electrocutes himself in a bathtub with a [[bridle|horse bridle]] upon learning Samara's powers are still at large. Noah arrives, he and Rachel go to the barn, where Samara was isolated in the loft. They find a burnt image of a tree, Rachel recognizing it from Shelter Mountain.\n\nThey return to the cabin, locating a stone [[water well|well]] hidden under the floorboards; the final image on the tape. Rachel falls in the well, experiencing a vision of Anna suffocating Samara and throwing her down the well, sealing her in, where she drowned seven days later. Samara's corpse surfaces after Noah tells Rachel that the seven day deadline has passed.\n\nThe next day, Aidan tells Rachel that it was a mistake to help Samara, revealing he is still cursed. In his apartment, Noah encounters the [[vengeful ghost]] of Samara emerge from his television, murdering him. Rachel, upon finding his disfigured corpse, returns home and destroys the original tape in a furious rage, asking why Noah was killed but she was not. She realizes that the difference is that she made a copy of the tape, which Aidan watched, thereby continuing the cycle that Samara wants to spread of duplicating the video and showing it to someone else to save oneself.\n\nRachel shows Aidan how to make his own copy. He remarks that the curse will never stop and asks what will happen to the person who watches the new tape, to which Rachel does not answer.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Naomi Watts]] as [[Rachel Keller]]\n*[[David Dorfman]] as Aidan Keller\n*[[Martin Henderson]] as Noah Clay\n*[[Daveigh Chase]] as [[Samara Morgan]]\n*[[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Richard Morgan\n*[[Shannon Cochran]] as Anna Morgan\n*[[Jane Alexander]] as Dr. Grasnik\n*[[Lindsay Frost]] as Ruth Embry\n*[[Amber Tamblyn]] as Katherine \"Katie\" Embry\n*[[Rachael Bella]] as Rebecca \"Becca\" Kotler\n*[[Richard Lineback]] as Innkeeper\n*[[Pauley Perrette]] as Beth\n*[[Sara Rue]] as Babysitter\n*[[Sasha Barrese]] as Girl Teen #1\n*Tess Hall as Girl Teen #2\n*[[Adam Brody]] as Kellen (Male Teen)\n*[[Michael Spound]] as Dave Embry\n*[[Chris Cooper]] as a child murderer (uncredited)\n*[[Joe Chrest]] as Dr. Scott (uncredited)\n*[[Maury Ginsberg]] as a video store clerk (DVD deleted scenes) (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''The Ring'' went into production without a completed script.<ref name=iwgv>{{cite web|url=http://www.curseofthering.com/gore.php|title=Interview with Gore Verbinski|date=2002|publisher=curseofthering.com|accessdate=March 2, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302113145/http://www.curseofthering.com/gore.php|archivedate=March 2, 2017}}</ref> [[Ehren Kruger]] wrote three drafts of the screenplay before [[Scott Frank]] came on to do an uncredited rewrite. Verbinski was initially inspired to do a remake of ''Ringu'' after [[Walter F. Parkes]] sent him a VHS copy of the original Japanese film, which he describes as \"intriguing\", \"Pulp\" and \"avant-garde\".\n\nProducer [[Neal Edelstein]] offered the remake to David Lynch to direct, but he turned it down. The original WGA-approved credits listed Hiroshi Takahashi (writer of the original 1998 screenplay for ''[[Ring (1998 film)|Ring]]'') but his name is absent from the final print.\n\nThe film also sought to retain the minimalism that was prevalent throughout ''Ringu'' and was decidedly set in [[Seattle]], due to its \"wet and isolated\" atmosphere. Verbinski also admitted to not wanting to cast \"big stars\" as he wanted his film to be \"discovered\" and describes the wave of harsh criticism from hardcore fans of the original Japanese film as \"inevitable\" although he expressed desire for hardcore fans of the original to find the remake as equally compelling.<ref name=iwgv/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n[[File:Theringtheme.ogg|thumb|right|The main theme of the film from the track ''The Well'', which is also known as \"Samara's Song\".]]\nThe film features an original score composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] (who would later collaborate on Gore Verbinski's other works).

It is a [[remake]] of the 1998 [[Japanese horror]] film ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]'', based on [[Ring (Suzuki novel)|the novel of the same name]] by [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|Koji Suzuki]]. Watts portrays a journalist who investigates a cursed videotape that seemingly kills the viewer seven days after watching it.\n\n''The Ring'' was released theatrically on October 18, 2002, and received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the atmosphere and Watts's performance. The film grossed over $249 million worldwide on a $48 million production budget, making it one of the highest-grossing horror remakes. It is the first installment of the [[The Ring (franchise)#American films|American ''Ring'' series]], and is followed by ''[[The Ring Two]]'' and ''[[Rings (2017 film)|Rings]]'', which were released in 2005 and 2017, respectively.\n\n''The Ring'' paved the way for English-language remakes of Asian horror films, such as ''[[The Grudge (2004 film)|The Grudge]]'', ''[[Dark Water (2005 film)|Dark Water]]'', ''[[Pulse (2006 film)|Pulse]]'', ''[[One Missed Call (2008 film)|One Missed Call]]'', ''[[The Eye (2008 film)|The Eye]]'', ''[[Shutter (2008 film)|Shutter]]'', ''[[Mirrors (2008 film)|Mirrors]]'', ''[[The Echo (2008 film)|The Echo]]'' and ''[[The Uninvited (2009 film)|The Uninvited]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Seattle]], teenagers Katie Embry and Becca Kotler discuss the legend of a cursed videotape; whoever watches it dies seven days later. Katie claims she watched the tape with three friends a week ago. Minutes later, Katie is killed by an unseen force, and Becca is institutionalized after witnessing it.\n\nAt Katie's funeral, her mother, Ruth, urges her sister Rachel Keller, a journalist, to investigate her daughter's death. Rachel lives with her young son Aidan, who possesses a degree of [[mediumship]]. Rachel learns Katie's friends all died on the same night, sporting disfigured appearances. Rachel travels to Shelter Mountain Inn where Katie stayed, discovering the rumoured cursed videotape. Renting the same cabin as Katie, Rachel watches the tape, which contains disturbing, gruesome imagery. Once the tape ends, Rachel receives a phone call from an unknown caller who whispers \u201cseven days\u201d.\n\nRachel recruits Noah Clay, her ex-boyfriend and Aidan's father, to study the tape, making a copy after he watches the original. Rachel begins to suffer supernatural symptoms as the week passes, haunted by a young girl with soaking wet hair. Investigation into the tape's imagery leads Rachel to Anna Morgan, a [[horse breeding|horse breeder]] from Moesko Island, who committed suicide after her prize-winning horses drowned themselves. Rachel catches Aidan watching the tape, and discovers Noah is suffering similar symptoms.\n\nLeaving Aidan in Ruth's care, Rachel travels to Moesko Island to speak to Anna's widower Richard. On the ferry journey, a horse is spooked by Rachel's presence, leaping to its death. Noah goes to Eola Psychiatric Hospital to view Anna's medical files. Both separately discover Anna had an adopted daughter, [[Sadako Yamamura|Samara]], who possessed an ability to [[thoughtography|psychically etch mental images]] onto surfaces and into minds, driving her parents mad. Rachel tries to speak with Richard about Samara, but he denies her existence.\n\nRachel speaks with Dr. Grasnik, the island's GP, who explains Samara was adopted due to Anna's [[infertility]], recommending them to admit her to Eola, assuming Samara is still there. Rachel sneaks into the Morgan farmhouse, watching a videotape of Samara in a psychotherapy session, who claims she has no control over her abilities. Rachel confronts Richard, who electrocutes himself in a bathtub with a [[bridle|horse bridle]] upon learning Samara's powers are still at large. Noah arrives, he and Rachel go to the barn, where Samara was isolated in the loft. They find a burnt image of a tree, Rachel recognizing it from Shelter Mountain.\n\nThey return to the cabin, locating a stone [[water well|well]] hidden under the floorboards; the final image on the tape. Rachel falls in the well, experiencing a vision of Anna suffocating Samara and throwing her down the well, sealing her in, where she drowned seven days later. Samara's corpse surfaces after Noah tells Rachel that the seven day deadline has passed.\n\nThe next day, Aidan tells Rachel that it was a mistake to help Samara, revealing he is still cursed. In his apartment, Noah encounters the [[vengeful ghost]] of Samara emerge from his television, murdering him. Rachel, upon finding his disfigured corpse, returns home and destroys the original tape in a furious rage, asking why Noah was killed but she was not. She realizes that the difference is that she made a copy of the tape, which Aidan watched, thereby continuing the cycle that Samara wants to spread of duplicating the video and showing it to someone else to save oneself.\n\nRachel shows Aidan how to make his own copy. He remarks that the curse will never stop and asks what will happen to the person who watches the new tape, to which Rachel does not answer.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Naomi Watts]] as [[Rachel Keller]]\n*[[David Dorfman]] as Aidan Keller\n*[[Martin Henderson]] as Noah Clay\n*[[Daveigh Chase]] as [[Samara Morgan]]\n*[[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Richard Morgan\n*[[Shannon Cochran]] as Anna Morgan\n*[[Jane Alexander]] as Dr. Grasnik\n*[[Lindsay Frost]] as Ruth Embry\n*[[Amber Tamblyn]] as Katherine \"Katie\" Embry\n*[[Rachael Bella]] as Rebecca \"Becca\" Kotler\n*[[Richard Lineback]] as Innkeeper\n*[[Pauley Perrette]] as Beth\n*[[Sara Rue]] as Babysitter\n*[[Sasha Barrese]] as Girl Teen #1\n*Tess Hall as Girl Teen #2\n*[[Adam Brody]] as Kellen (Male Teen)\n*[[Michael Spound]] as Dave Embry\n*[[Chris Cooper]] as a child murderer (uncredited)\n*[[Joe Chrest]] as Dr. Scott (uncredited)\n*[[Maury Ginsberg]] as a video store clerk (DVD deleted scenes) (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''The Ring'' went into production without a completed script.<ref name=iwgv>{{cite web|url=http://www.curseofthering.com/gore.php|title=Interview with Gore Verbinski|date=2002|publisher=curseofthering.com|accessdate=March 2, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302113145/http://www.curseofthering.com/gore.php|archivedate=March 2, 2017}}</ref> [[Ehren Kruger]] wrote three drafts of the screenplay before [[Scott Frank]] came on to do an uncredited rewrite. Verbinski was initially inspired to do a remake of ''Ringu'' after [[Walter F.

Verbinski also admitted to not wanting to cast \"big stars\" as he wanted his film to be \"discovered\" and describes the wave of harsh criticism from hardcore fans of the original Japanese film as \"inevitable\" although he expressed desire for hardcore fans of the original to find the remake as equally compelling.<ref name=iwgv/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n[[File:Theringtheme.ogg|thumb|right|The main theme of the film from the track ''The Well'', which is also known as \"Samara's Song\".]]\nThe film features an original score composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] (who would later collaborate on Gore Verbinski's other works).

Led by Sheikh [[Abdul Qadir Mumin]], the group is estimated to have up to 300 active fighters. Since its formation, ISS probably managed to take control of a small, sparsely populated territory in northern Somalia's mountainous hinterland, though it was not acknowledged as [[ISIL territorial claims|official province]] (\"Wilayat\") by ISIL's central leadership until December 2017. Since then, it has sometimes been called '''Somalia Province''' (\"Wilayat al Somal\") by pro-ISIL media. ISS is also the declared enemy of [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]], which considers the Islamic State a significant threat to its own predominance among Jihadist factions in Somalia.\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins and formation ===\n[[File:LocationPuntland3.png|thumb|left|Location of [[Puntland]] (blue) in [[Somalia]] ]]\n\nThe origins of the Islamic State in Somalia trace back to 2012, when [[Abdul Qadir Mumin]] was sent by the al-Shabaab leadership to its remote outpost in Puntland, far from the insurgent group's primary areas of operation in southern Somalia. As cleric with little military experience, Mumin's role in Puntland was originally to attract recruits for the numerical small and militarily weak local al-Shabaab group, which was led by [[Mohamed Said Atom]] at the time. In course of the [[Galgala campaign]] in 2014, however, Atom defected to the government, and Mumin was forced to take control of the Puntland group. Isolated in the remote north and feeling increasingly distanced from al-Shabaab, Mumin began to consider himself more and more independent.{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}}\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant had launched a propaganda campaign to convince al-Shabaab to join to them, which was \"angrily refused\" by al-Shabaab's central leadership.{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}} Despite this, several groups of al-Shabaab members found ISIL's ideology attractive or saw this new Jihadist organization as a way to challenge al-Shabaab's leadership at the time. Thus, several small pro-ISIL groups emerged in southern Somalia. This was however not tolerated by the Somali organization, which released statements condemning dissenters{{efn|name=fn1|Al-Shabaab radio stations for example declared in November 2015: \"If anyone says he belongs to another Islamic movement [other than that of al-Qa'ida], kill him on the spot ... we will cut the throat of anyone ... if they undermine unity.\" Al-Shabaab spokesman Ali Mahmud Rage similarly claimed that dissenters in the organization were \"infidels\" who would be \"burnt in hell\".{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=28}} }} and ordered its internal security service Amniyat to arrest or kill pro-ISIL elements such as Hussein Abdi Gedi's faction in [[Middle Juba]].{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=29}}\n\nMumin, however, long dissatisfied with his situation, pledged ''[[bay'ah]]'' to [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]] and the Islamic State in October 2015. This caused a violent split within Puntland's al-Shabaab, as only 20 of the 300 local Islamist fighters joined Mumin,{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}}<ref name=\"port town\">{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/10/islamic-state-in-somalia-claims-capture-of-port-town.php|title=Islamic State in Somalia claims capture of port town|author=Caleb Weiss|publisher=[[Long War Journal]]|date=26 October 2016|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref> while the al-Shabaab loyalists attempted to kill these defectors.

In two notable incidents in November and December 2015, al-Shabaab attacked and destroyed two of the most important southern ISIL cells, namely the ones of Bashir Abu Numan and Mohammad Makkawi Ibrahim. Pro-government forces such as the [[Somali Armed Forces]] and [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]] also claimed to have targeted southern ISIL groups. As result, ISIL forces in southern Somialia remained very weak,{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|pp=28, 29}} and those that survived appear to have accepted Mumin's authority over time, formally becoming part of ISS.{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|pp=27, 28}} As result, the \"disparate clump of pro-Islamic State cells\" in Somalia transformed into an \"organized group\".{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=29}}\n\n=== Rise in power and Qandala campaign ===\n{{further|Qandala campaign}}\n[[File:Variant flag of the Islamic State.svg|thumb|right|A variant of the Islamic State in Somalia's usual [[Black Standard|black flag]], which is also sometimes used by the group.<ref name=\"camp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/04/islamic-state-highlights-first-camp-of-the-caliphate-in-somalia.php|title=Islamic State highlights \u2018first camp of the Caliphate in Somalia\u2019|author1=Bill Roggio|author2=Caleb Weiss|publisher=[[Long War Journal]]|date=25 April 2016|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>]]\n\nIn March 2016, an ISS cell in southern Puntland was pursued by al-Shabaab fighters into [[Mudug]]; the pursuers were however attacked and completely defeated by the [[Puntland Dervish Force]] and [[Military of Galmudug|Galmudug soldiers]], thus unintentionally allowing the Islamic State militants to escape into safety.<ref name=\"puntland state\">{{cite web|url=https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/horn-africa/somalia/islamic-state-threat-somalias-puntland-state|title=The Islamic State Threat in Somalia\u2019s Puntland State |author1=Zakaria Yusuf |author2=Abdul Khalif |work=[[International Crisis Group]] |date=17 November 2016|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref> From this point onwards, ISS and al-Shabaab temporarily ceased fighting each other with the exception of some isolated incidents.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}} Over the following months Mumin's followers built up their strength, and by April 2016 they had set up a temporary training camp named after Bashir Abu Numan, the ISIL follower mentioned above who had been killed by al-Shabaab in November 2015.<ref name=\"camp\" />{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=29}} In one of the group's propaganda videos, Mumin blessed the makeshift base as the \"first camp of the Caliphate in Somalia\".

On 26 October, the group eventually launched their first major operation by [[Qandala campaign|targeting]] the major port town of [[Qandala]].

At the time of the Qandala campaign, a former [[Puntland Intelligence Agency]] official argued that ISS counted 200 to 300 militants. Following its defeat at Qandala, local observers judged that the group declined to just 70\u2013150 members by June 2017.{{sfnp|Warner|Hulme|2018|p=24}} The Islamic State in Somalia subsequently recruited new fighters to alleviate its manpower shortage, though Somali journalists gave widely different accounts on the success of this recruitment drive.

Peripheral areas are thus mostly ignored by the security forces and instead run by rebellious and infighting tribal militias. As result, local clans (including Mumin's own, the [[Majeerteen]] Ali Saleban) are aggrieved by their perceived marginalisation by the government and in some cases ready to support ISS. Such dissatisfied elements are the ones from which ISS receives supplies and recruits new members.<ref name=\"puntland state\" /><ref name=\"growing threat\" />{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}} There have also been accounts, however, that ISS raids those communities which do not supply it with food and other necessities,<ref name=\"surrender\" /> and to kidnap children in order to indoctrinate and train them as child soldiers.<ref name=\"list global\" /> The group is also known to collect taxes in areas which it controls or at least influences.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}}\n\nThe group is also directly supported by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Yemen Province]], which is known to have sent experts, trainers, money, weapons and other materials to ISS.<ref name=\"vow\" /> The [[United Nations]] also claimed in November 2017 that ISS receives direct assistance from ISIL officials in [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]].{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=30}}<ref name=\"footprint\" /> In smuggling fighters and supplies across the [[Gulf of Aden]], ISS works closely with [[Piracy off the coast of Somalia|Somali pirates]], namely Mohamed Garfanje's Hobyo-Haradhere Piracy Network and another unidentified group that is based in Qandala.

Led by Sheikh [[Abdul Qadir Mumin]], the group is estimated to have up to 300 active fighters. Since its formation, ISS probably managed to take control of a small, sparsely populated territory in northern Somalia's mountainous hinterland, though it was not acknowledged as [[ISIL territorial claims|official province]] (\"Wilayat\") by ISIL's central leadership until December 2017. Since then, it has sometimes been called '''Somalia Province''' (\"Wilayat al Somal\") by pro-ISIL media. ISS is also the declared enemy of [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]], which considers the Islamic State a significant threat to its own predominance among Jihadist factions in Somalia.\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins and formation ===\n[[File:LocationPuntland3.png|thumb|left|Location of [[Puntland]] (blue) in [[Somalia]] ]]\n\nThe origins of the Islamic State in Somalia trace back to 2012, when [[Abdul Qadir Mumin]] was sent by the al-Shabaab leadership to its remote outpost in Puntland, far from the insurgent group's primary areas of operation in southern Somalia. As cleric with little military experience, Mumin's role in Puntland was originally to attract recruits for the numerical small and militarily weak local al-Shabaab group, which was led by [[Mohamed Said Atom]] at the time. In course of the [[Galgala campaign]] in 2014, however, Atom defected to the government, and Mumin was forced to take control of the Puntland group. Isolated in the remote north and feeling increasingly distanced from al-Shabaab, Mumin began to consider himself more and more independent.{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}}\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant had launched a propaganda campaign to convince al-Shabaab to join to them, which was \"angrily refused\" by al-Shabaab's central leadership.{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}} Despite this, several groups of al-Shabaab members found ISIL's ideology attractive or saw this new Jihadist organization as a way to challenge al-Shabaab's leadership at the time. Thus, several small pro-ISIL groups emerged in southern Somalia. This was however not tolerated by the Somali organization, which released statements condemning dissenters{{efn|name=fn1|Al-Shabaab radio stations for example declared in November 2015: \"If anyone says he belongs to another Islamic movement [other than that of al-Qa'ida], kill him on the spot ... we will cut the throat of anyone ... if they undermine unity.\" Al-Shabaab spokesman Ali Mahmud Rage similarly claimed that dissenters in the organization were \"infidels\" who would be \"burnt in hell\".{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=28}} }} and ordered its internal security service Amniyat to arrest or kill pro-ISIL elements such as Hussein Abdi Gedi's faction in [[Middle Juba]].{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=29}}\n\nMumin, however, long dissatisfied with his situation, pledged ''[[bay'ah]]'' to [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]] and the Islamic State in October 2015. This caused a violent split within Puntland's al-Shabaab, as only 20 of the 300 local Islamist fighters joined Mumin,{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}}<ref name=\"port town\">{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/10/islamic-state-in-somalia-claims-capture-of-port-town.php|title=Islamic State in Somalia claims capture of port town|author=Caleb Weiss|publisher=[[Long War Journal]]|date=26 October 2016|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref> while the al-Shabaab loyalists attempted to kill these defectors.

In two notable incidents in November and December 2015, al-Shabaab attacked and destroyed two of the most important southern ISIL cells, namely the ones of Bashir Abu Numan and Mohammad Makkawi Ibrahim. Pro-government forces such as the [[Somali Armed Forces]] and [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]] also claimed to have targeted southern ISIL groups. As result, ISIL forces in southern Somialia remained very weak,{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|pp=28, 29}} and those that survived appear to have accepted Mumin's authority over time, formally becoming part of ISS.{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|pp=27, 28}} As result, the \"disparate clump of pro-Islamic State cells\" in Somalia transformed into an \"organized group\".{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=29}}\n\n=== Rise in power and Qandala campaign ===\n{{further|Qandala campaign}}\n[[File:Variant flag of the Islamic State.svg|thumb|right|A variant of the Islamic State in Somalia's usual [[Black Standard|black flag]], which is also sometimes used by the group.<ref name=\"camp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/04/islamic-state-highlights-first-camp-of-the-caliphate-in-somalia.php|title=Islamic State highlights \u2018first camp of the Caliphate in Somalia\u2019|author1=Bill Roggio|author2=Caleb Weiss|publisher=[[Long War Journal]]|date=25 April 2016|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>]]\n\nIn March 2016, an ISS cell in southern Puntland was pursued by al-Shabaab fighters into [[Mudug]]; the pursuers were however attacked and completely defeated by the [[Puntland Dervish Force]] and [[Military of Galmudug|Galmudug soldiers]], thus unintentionally allowing the Islamic State militants to escape into safety.<ref name=\"puntland state\">{{cite web|url=https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/horn-africa/somalia/islamic-state-threat-somalias-puntland-state|title=The Islamic State Threat in Somalia\u2019s Puntland State |author1=Zakaria Yusuf |author2=Abdul Khalif |work=[[International Crisis Group]] |date=17 November 2016|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref> From this point onwards, ISS and al-Shabaab temporarily ceased fighting each other with the exception of some isolated incidents.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}} Over the following months Mumin's followers built up their strength, and by April 2016 they had set up a temporary training camp named after Bashir Abu Numan, the ISIL follower mentioned above who had been killed by al-Shabaab in November 2015.<ref name=\"camp\" />{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=29}} In one of the group's propaganda videos, Mumin blessed the makeshift base as the \"first camp of the Caliphate in Somalia\".

On 26 October, the group eventually launched their first major operation by [[Qandala campaign|targeting]] the major port town of [[Qandala]].

Mumin's initial cell was estimated at about 20 members, growing to less than 100 by August 2016. At the time of the Qandala campaign, a former [[Puntland Intelligence Agency]] official argued that ISS counted 200 to 300 militants. Following its defeat at Qandala, local observers judged that the group declined to just 70\u2013150 members by June 2017.{{sfnp|Warner|Hulme|2018|p=24}} The Islamic State in Somalia subsequently recruited new fighters to alleviate its manpower shortage, though Somali journalists gave widely different accounts on the success of this recruitment drive. Accordingly, ISS was believed to be between 100 and 300 militants strong by mid-2018.{{sfnp|Warner|Hulme|2018|pp=24\u201325}} The vast majority of ISS members are Somalis, with only a few [[Mujahideen#Somalia|foreign mujahideen]] fighting for the group, including Sudanese, a Yemenis,{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=30}}<ref name=\"footprint\" /> Ethiopians,<ref name=\"holidays\"/> and Egyptians.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=31}}\n\n=== Propaganda ===\nThe propaganda of ISS is generally extremely inferior compared to its direct rival al-Shabaab. The Islamic State in Somalia initially had no media wing of its own and also has not organized a \"robust informal media presence\".{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=31}} Instead, it mostly relies on the existing propaganda channels of ISIL, such as the [[Amaq News Agency]],{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=31}} the Al Naba newsletter ,{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=31}} the ''Global Front to Support the Islamic State'', and the media arms of other ISIL branches in [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Yemen]], [[Egypt]], and [[Libya]].{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=29}} The propaganda video of December 2017 that declared ISS a province, however, also claimed to have been produced by the \"Media Office of Wilayat al Somal\".<ref name=\"holidays\"/> In late 2019, ISS began releasing propaganda in [[Amharic]], a language widely spoken in Ethiopia, in an attempt to attract new recruits there.{{sfnp|West|2020|p=6}}\n\n== Supply, support and allies ==\n{{further|Piracy off the coast of Somalia}}\nIn its endeavor to build up its military strength, the Islamic State in Somalia is aided by the fact that Puntland's government has only limited control over its hinterland while its military is overstrechted. Peripheral areas are thus mostly ignored by the security forces and instead run by rebellious and infighting tribal militias. As result, local clans (including Mumin's own, the [[Majeerteen]] Ali Saleban) are aggrieved by their perceived marginalisation by the government and in some cases ready to support ISS. Such dissatisfied elements are the ones from which ISS receives supplies and recruits new members.<ref name=\"puntland state\" /><ref name=\"growing threat\" />{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}} There have also been accounts, however, that ISS raids those communities which do not supply it with food and other necessities,<ref name=\"surrender\" /> and to kidnap children in order to indoctrinate and train them as child soldiers.<ref name=\"list global\" /> The group is also known to collect taxes in areas which it controls or at least influences.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}}\n\nThe group is also directly supported by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Yemen Province]], which is known to have sent experts, trainers, money, weapons and other materials to ISS.<ref name=\"vow\" /> The [[United Nations]] also claimed in November 2017 that ISS receives direct assistance from ISIL officials in [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]].{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=30}}<ref name=\"footprint\" /> In smuggling fighters and supplies across the [[Gulf of Aden]], ISS works closely with [[Piracy off the coast of Somalia|Somali pirates]], namely Mohamed Garfanje's Hobyo-Haradhere Piracy Network and another unidentified group that is based in Qandala. These pirates do, however, also supply ISS' rival in Puntland, al-Shabaab, with weapons and other materials.<ref name=\"pirate kings\" />\n\nFurthermore, ISS has been supported by \"financial operative\" Mohamed Mire Ali Yusuf (often simply called Mire Ali) who provided the group with money and supplies through two companies, both located in Bosaso by 2016: Liibaan Trading, a [[Animal husbandry|livestock trading]] business, and Al-Mutafaq Commercial Company.
