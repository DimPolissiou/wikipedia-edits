It is among the longest operas commonly performed, usually taking around four and a half hours. It was first performed at the [[National Theatre Munich|K\u00f6nigliches Hof- und National-Theater]], today the home of the [[Bavarian State Opera]], in Munich, on 21 June 1868. The conductor at the premiere was [[Hans von B\u00fclow]].\n\nThe story is set in [[Nuremberg]] in the mid-16th century. At the time, Nuremberg was a [[free imperial city]] and one of the centers of the [[Renaissance]] in Northern Europe. The story revolves around the city's [[guild]] of ''[[Meistersinger]]'' (Master Singers), an association of amateur poets and musicians who were primarily [[Master craftsman|master craftsmen]] of various trades. The master singers had developed a craftsmanlike approach to music-making, with an intricate system of rules for composing and performing songs. The work draws much of its atmosphere from its depiction of the Nuremberg of the era and the traditions of the master-singer guild. One of the main characters, the cobbler-poet Hans Sachs, is based on a historical figure, [[Hans Sachs]] (1494\u20131576), the most famous of the master-singers.\n\n''Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg'' occupies a unique place in Wagner's oeuvre. It is the only comedy among his mature operas (he had come to reject his early ''[[Das Liebesverbot]]'') and is also unusual among his works in being set in a historically well-defined time and place rather than in a mythical or legendary setting. It is the only mature Wagner opera based on an entirely original story, devised by Wagner himself, and in which no supernatural or magical powers or events are in evidence. It incorporates many of the operatic conventions that Wagner had railed against in his essays on the theory of opera: rhymed verse, [[aria]]s, [[Choir|chorus]]es, a [[quintet]], and even a [[ballet]].\n\n==Composition history==\nWagner's autobiography {{Lang|de|[[Mein Leben (Wagner)|Mein Leben]]}} (''My Life'') described the genesis of {{Lang|de|Die Meistersinger}}.{{sfn|Warrack|1994|p={{page needed|date=March 2020}}}} [[Spa town|Taking the waters]] at [[Marienbad]] in 1845 he began reading [[Georg Gottfried Gervinus]]' ''Geschichte der deutschen Dichtung'' (History of German Poetry). This work included chapters on mastersong and on Hans Sachs.<blockquote>\nI had formed a particularly vivid picture of Hans Sachs and the mastersingers of Nuremberg. I was especially intrigued by the institution of the Marker and his function in rating master-songs ... I conceived during a walk a comic scene in which the popular artisan-poet, by hammering upon his cobbler's last, gives the Marker, who is obliged by circumstances to sing in his presence, his come-uppance for previous pedantic misdeeds during official singing contests, by inflicting upon him a lesson of his own.<ref name=Gray>Wagner, Richard, tr. Andrew Gray (1992)</ref></blockquote>\n\nGervinus' book also mentions a poem by the real-life Hans Sachs on the subject of Protestant reformer [[Martin Luther]], called ''Die Wittenbergisch Nachtigall'' (The Wittenberg Nightingale). The opening lines for this poem, addressing the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], were later used by Wagner in act 3 scene 5 when the crowd acclaims Sachs: ''Wacht auf, es nahet gen den Tag; ich h\u00f6r' singen im gr\u00fcnen Hag ein wonnigliche Nachtigall.'' (Awake, the dawn is drawing near; I hear, singing in the green grove, a blissful nightingale)\n\nIn addition to this, Wagner added a scene drawn from his own life, in which a case of mistaken identity led to a near-riot: this was to be the basis for the finale of act 2.\n<blockquote>Out of this situation evolved an uproar, which through the shouting and clamour and an inexplicable growth in the number of participants in the struggle soon assumed a truly demoniacal character. It looked to me as if the whole town would break out into a riot...Then suddenly I heard a heavy thump, and as if by magic the whole crowd dispersed in every direction...One of the regular patrons had felled one of the noisiest rioters ... And it was the effect of this which had scattered everybody so suddenly.<ref name=Gray /></blockquote>\n\nThis first draft of the story was dated \"Marienbad 16 July 1845\". Wagner later said, in ''Eine Mitteilung an meine Freunde'' (1851) (A Communication to my Friends)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.belgacom.net/wagnerlibrary/prose/wagcomm.htm|title=A Communication to my Friends|first=Richard|last=Wagner|website=Users.belgacom.net|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref> that {{Lang|de|Meistersinger}} was to be a comic opera to follow a tragic opera, i.e. ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]''. Just as the [[Athenians]] had followed a tragedy with a comic [[satyr play]], so Wagner would follow {{Lang|de|Tannh\u00e4user}} with {{Lang|de|Meistersinger}}: the link being that both operas included song-contests.\n\n===Influence of Schopenhauer===\nIn 1854, Wagner first read [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], and was struck by the philosopher's theories on [[aesthetics]].<ref>[[Schopenhauer's aesthetics]]</ref> In this philosophy, art is a means for escaping from the sufferings of the world, and music is the highest of the arts since it is the only one not involved in representation of the world (i.e. it is abstract). It is for this reason that music can communicate emotion without the need for words. In his earlier essay ''Oper und Drama'' (Opera and Drama) (1850\u20131)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.belgacom.net/wagnerlibrary/prose/wlpr0063.htm|title=Opera and Drama|first=Richard|last=Wagner|website=Users.belgacom.net|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref> Wagner had derided staples of operatic construction: arias, choruses, duets, trios, recitatives, etc. As a result of reading Schopenhauer's ideas about the role of music, Wagner re-evaluated his prescription for opera, and included many of these elements in {{Lang|de|Die Meistersinger}}.\n\nAlthough {{Lang|de|Die Meistersinger}} is a comedy, it also elucidates Wagner's ideas on the place of music in society, on renunciation of  ''Wille'' ([[Will (philosophy)|Will]]), and on the solace that music can bring in a world full of {{Lang|de|Wahn}} (delusion, folly, self-deception). It is {{Lang|de|Wahn}} which causes the riot in act 2 \u2013 a sequence of events arising from a case of mistaken identity, which can be seen as a form of self-delusion. Commentators have observed that in his famous act 3 monologue {{Lang|de|Wahn, Wahn, \u00fcberall Wahn}} (Madness! Madness!, Everywhere madness!), Sachs paraphrases Schopenhauer's description of the way that {{Lang|de|Wahn}} drives a person to behave in ways that are self-destructive:<ref>Magee, Bryan (2002). ''The Tristan Chord''. Owl Books, New York. {{ISBN|0-8050-7189-X}}. (UK title: ''Wagner and Philosophy'', Penguin Books Ltd, {{ISBN|0-14-029519-4}})</ref>\n<poem lang=\"de\" style=\"margin-left:1em; float:left;\">in Flucht geschlagen, w\u00e4hnt er zu jagen; h\u00f6rt nicht sein eigen Schmerzgekreisch,\nwenn er sich w\u00fchlt ins eig'ne Fleisch, w\u00e4hnt Lust sich zu erzeigen!</poem>\n<poem style=\"margin-left:1em; float:left;\">driven into flight he believes he is hunting, and does not hear his own cry of pain:\nwhen he tears into his own flesh, he imagines he is giving himself pleasure!</poem>{{clear|left}}\n\nFollowing the completion of ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', Wagner resumed work on {{Lang|de|Die Meistersinger}} in 1861 with a quite different philosophical outlook from that which he held when he developed his first draft. The character of Hans Sachs became one of the most Schopenhauerian of Wagner's creations. Wagner scholar Lucy Beckett{{sfn|Warrack|1994|loc=chapter 4}} has noted the remarkable similarity between Wagner's Sachs and Schopenhauer's description of the noble man:\n\n<blockquote>We always picture a very noble character to ourselves as having a certain trace of silent sadness... It is a consciousness that has resulted from knowledge of the vanity of all achievements and of the suffering of all life, not merely of one's own. (Schopenhauer: ''Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung'' \u2013 The World as Will and Representation)</blockquote>\n\nThe other distinctive manifestation of Sachs's character \u2013 his calm renunciation of the prospect of becoming a suitor for Eva's love \u2013 is also deeply Schopenhauerian.<ref>Magee, Bryan (2002). ''The Tristan Chord''. Chapter 14</ref> Sachs here denies the [[Will (philosophy)|Will]] in its supposedly most insistent form, that of sexual love. Wagner marks this moment with a direct musical and textual reference to ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'': {{Lang|de|Mein Kind, von Tristan und Isolde kenn' ich ein traurig St\u00fcck. Hans Sachs war klug und wollte nichts von Herrn Markes Gl\u00fcck.}} (\"My child, I know a sad tale of Tristan and Isolde. Hans Sachs was clever and did not want anything of King Marke's lot.\")\n\n===Completion and premiere===\nHaving completed the [[scenario]], Wagner began writing the [[libretto]] while living in Paris in 1862, and followed this by composing the [[overture]]. The overture was publicly performed in [[Leipzig]] on 2 November 1862, conducted by the composer.<ref>Richard Sternfeld, preface to the complete vocal and orchestral score, Dover Publications, 1976</ref> Composition of act 1 was begun in spring of 1863 in the Viennese suburb of [[Penzing (Vienna)|Penzing]], but the opera in its entirety was not finished until October 1867, when Wagner was living at [[Tribschen]] near [[Lucerne]]. These years were some of Wagner's most difficult: the 1861 Paris production of [[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|''Tannh\u00e4user'']] was a fiasco, Wagner gave up hope of completing ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', the 1864 Vienna production of ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' was abandoned after 77 rehearsals, and finally in 1866 Wagner's first wife, [[Minna Planer|Minna]], died. [[Cosima Wagner]] was later to write: \"When future generations seek refreshment in this unique work, may they spare a thought for the tears from which the smiles arose.\"\n\nThe premiere was given at the [[National Theatre Munich|K\u00f6nigliches Hof- und National-Theater]], Munich, on 21 June 1868. The production was sponsored by [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] and the conductor was [[Hans von B\u00fclow]]. [[Franz Strauss]], the father of the composer [[Richard Strauss]], played the [[French horn]] at the premiere, despite his often-expressed dislike of Wagner, who was present at many of the rehearsals. Wagner's frequent interruptions and digressions made rehearsals a very long-winded affair. After one 5 hour rehearsal, Franz Strauss led a strike by the orchestra, saying that he could not play any more. Despite these problems, the premiere was a triumph, and the opera was hailed as one of Wagner's most successful works. At the end of the first performance, the audience called for Wagner, who appeared at the front of the Royal box, which he had been sharing with King Ludwig. Wagner bowed to the crowd, breaking court protocol, which dictated that only the monarch could address an audience from the box.<ref>Gregor-Dellin, Martin (1983) ''Richard Wagner: his life, his work, his Century''.

Eva and Walther have fallen in love at first sight, but she informs him that her father, the goldsmith and mastersinger Veit Pogner, has arranged to give her hand in marriage to the winner of the guild's song contest on St. John's Day ([[Midsummer|Midsummer's Day]]), tomorrow. Eva's maid, Magdalena, gets David, Hans Sachs's apprentice, to tell Walther about the mastersingers' art. The hope is for Walther to qualify as a mastersinger during the guild meeting, traditionally held in the church after Mass, and thus earn a place in the song contest despite his utter ignorance of the master-guild's rules and conventions.\n\n''Scene 2''\n\nAs the other apprentices set up the church for the meeting, David warns Walther that it is not easy to become a mastersinger; it takes many years of learning and practice. David gives a confusing lecture on the mastersingers' rules for composing and singing. (Many of the tunes he describes were real master-tunes from the period.) Walther is confused by the complicated rules, but is determined to try for a place in the guild anyway.\n\n''Scene 3''\n\nThe first mastersingers file into the church, including Eva's wealthy father Veit Pogner and the town clerk Beckmesser. Beckmesser, a clever technical singer who was expecting to win the contest without opposition, is distressed to see that Walther is Pogner's guest and intends to enter the contest. Meanwhile, Pogner introduces Walther to the other mastersingers as they arrive. Fritz Kothner the baker, serving as chairman of this meeting, calls the roll. Pogner, addressing the assembly, announces his offer of his daughter's hand for the winner of the song contest. When Hans Sachs argues that Eva ought to have a say in the matter, Pogner agrees that Eva may refuse the winner of the contest, but she must still marry a mastersinger. Another suggestion by Sachs, that the townspeople, rather than the masters, should be called upon to judge the winner of the contest, is rejected by the other masters. Pogner formally introduces Walther as a candidate for admission into the masterguild. Questioned by Kothner about his background, Walther states that his teacher in poetry was [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] whose works he studied in his own private library in Franconia, and his teachers in music were the birds and nature itself. Reluctantly the masters agree to admit him, provided he can perform a master-song of his own composition. Walther chooses love as the topic for his song and therefore is to be judged by Beckmesser alone, the \"Marker\" of the guild for [[Profanum|worldly]] matters.  At the signal to begin (''Fanget an!''), Walther launches into a novel free-form tune (''So rief der Lenz in den Wald''), breaking all the mastersingers' rules, and his song is constantly interrupted by the scratch of Beckmesser's chalk on his [[chalkboard]], maliciously noting one violation after another. When Beckmesser has completely covered the slate with symbols of Walther's errors, he interrupts the song and argues that there is no point in finishing it. Sachs tries to convince the masters to let Walther continue, but Beckmesser sarcastically tells Sachs to stop trying to set policy and instead, to finish making his (Beckmesser's) new shoes, which are overdue. Raising his voice over the masters' argument, Walther finishes his song, but the masters reject him and he rushes out of the church.\n\n===Act 2===\n''Scene 1: Evening in a Nuremberg street, at the corner between Pogner's house and Hans Sachs's house, opposite. A lime tree stands outside Pogner's house, an elder outside Sachs's. The apprentices are closing the shutters''\n\nDavid informs Magdalena of Walther's failure. In her disappointment, Magdalena leaves without giving David the food she had brought for him. This arouses the derision of the other apprentices, and David is about to turn on them when Sachs arrives and hustles his apprentice into the workshop.\n\n''Scene 2''\n\nPogner arrives with Eva, engaging in a roundabout conversation: Eva is hesitant to ask about the outcome of Walther's application, and Pogner has private doubts about whether it was wise to offer his daughter's hand in marriage for the song contest. As they enter their house, Magdalena appears and tells Eva about the rumours of Walther's failure. Eva decides to ask Sachs about the matter.\n\n''Scene 3''\n\nAs twilight falls, Hans Sachs takes a seat in front of his house, to work on a new pair of shoes for Beckmesser. He muses on Walther's song, which has made a deep impression on him.  (\"''Was duftet doch der Flieder''\", often called \"the ''Fliedermonolog''\")\n\n''Scene 4''\n\nEva approaches Sachs, and they discuss tomorrow's song contest. Eva is unenthusiastic about Beckmesser, who appears to be the only eligible contestant. She hints that she would not mind if Sachs, a widower, were to win the contest. Though touched, Sachs protests that he would be too old a husband for her. Upon further prompting, Sachs describes Walther's failure at the guild meeting. This causes Eva to storm off angrily, confirming Sachs's suspicion that she has fallen in love with Walther. Eva is intercepted by Magdalena, who informs her that Beckmesser is coming to [[serenade]] her. Eva, determined to search for Walther, tells Magdalena to pose as her (Eva) at the bedroom window.\n\n''Scene 5''\n\nJust as Eva is about to leave, Walther appears. He tells her that he has been rejected by the mastersingers, and the two prepare to elope. However, Sachs has overheard their plans. As they are passing by, he illuminates the street with his lantern, forcing them to hide in the shadow of Pogner's house. Walther makes up his mind to confront Sachs, but is interrupted by the arrival of Beckmesser.\n\n''Scene 6''\n\nAs Eva and Walther retreat further into the shadows, Beckmesser begins his serenade. Sachs interrupts him by launching into a full-bellied cobbling song, and hammering the soles of the half-made shoes. Annoyed, Beckmesser tells Sachs to stop, but the cobbler replies that he has to finish tempering the soles of the shoes, whose lateness Beckmesser had publicly complained about (in act 1). Sachs offers a compromise: he will be quiet and let Beckmesser sing, but he (Sachs) will be Beckmesser's \"marker\", and mark each of Beckmesser's musical/poetical errors by striking one of the soles with his hammer. Beckmesser, who has spotted someone at Eva's window (Magdalena in disguise), has no time to argue. He tries to sing his serenade, but he makes so many mistakes (his tune repeatedly places accents on the wrong syllables of the words) that from the repeated knocks Sachs finishes the shoes. David wakes up and sees Beckmesser apparently serenading Magdalena. He attacks Beckmesser in a fit of jealous rage. The entire  neighborhood is awakened by the noise. The other apprentices rush into the fray, and the situation degenerates into a full-blown riot. In the confusion, Walther tries to escape with Eva, but Sachs pushes Eva into her home and drags Walther into his own workshop. Quiet is restored as abruptly as it was broken. A lone figure walks through the street \u2013 the nightwatchman, calling out the hour.\n\n===Act 3, scenes 1\u20134===\n''Prelude (Vorspiel)'', a meditative orchestral introduction using music from two key episodes to be heard in act 3: Sachs's scene 1 monologue \"Wahn! Wahn!\" and the \"Wittenburg Nightingale\" quasi-chorale sung by the townspeople to greet Sachs in scene 5.\n[[File:Meistersinger.jpg|thumb|Act 3, painting by [[Ferdinand Leeke]]]]\n\n''Scene 1: Sachs's workshop''\n\nAs morning dawns, Sachs is reading a large book. Lost in thought, he does not respond as David returns from delivering Beckmesser's shoes. David finally manages to attract his master's attention, and they discuss the upcoming festivities \u2013 it is St. John's day, Hans Sachs's [[name day]]. David recites his verses for Sachs, and leaves to prepare for the festival. Alone, Sachs ponders last night's riot. \"Madness! Madness! Everywhere madness!\" (''Wahn! Wahn! \u00dcberall Wahn!'') His attempt to prevent an elopement had ended in shocking violence. Nevertheless, he is resolved to make madness work for him today.\n\n''Scene 2''\n\nSachs gives Walther an interactive lesson on the history and philosophy of music and mastersinging, and teaches him to moderate his singing according to the spirit (if not the strict letter) of the masters' rules. Walther demonstrates his understanding by composing two sections of a new Prize Song in a more acceptable style than his previous effort from act 1. Sachs writes down the new verses as Walther sings them. A final section remains to be composed, but Walther postpones the task. The two men leave the room to dress for the festival.\n\n''Scene 3''\n\nBeckmesser, still sore from his drubbing the night before, enters the workshop. He spots the verses of the Prize Song, written in Sachs's handwriting, and infers (erroneously) that Sachs is secretly planning to enter the contest for Eva's hand. The cobbler re-enters the room and Beckmesser confronts him with the verses and asks if he wrote them. Sachs confirms that the handwriting is his, but does not clarify that he was not the author but merely served as scribe.  However, he goes on to say that he has no intention of wooing Eva or entering the contest, and he presents the manuscript to Beckmesser as a gift. He promises never to claim the song for his own, and warns Beckmesser that it is a very difficult song to interpret and sing. Beckmesser, his confidence restored by the prospect of using verses written by the famous Hans Sachs, ignores the warning and rushes off to prepare for the song contest. Sachs smiles at Beckmesser's foolishness but expresses hope that Beckmesser will learn to be better in the future.\n\n''Scene 4''\n\nEva arrives at the workshop. She is looking for Walther, but pretends to have complaints about a shoe that Sachs made for her. Sachs realizes that the shoe is a perfect fit, but pretends to set about altering the stitching. As he works, he tells Eva that he has just heard a beautiful song, lacking only an ending. Eva cries out as Walther enters the room, splendidly attired for the festival, and sings the third and final section of the Prize Song. The couple are overwhelmed with gratitude for Sachs, and Eva asks Sachs to forgive her for having manipulated his feelings. The cobbler brushes them off with bantering complaints about his lot as a shoemaker, poet, and widower. At last, however, he admits to Eva that, despite his feelings for her, he is resolved to avoid the fate of [[Mark of Cornwall|King Marke]] (a reference to the subject of another Wagner opera, ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', in which an old man tries to marry a much-younger woman), thus conferring his blessing upon the lovers. David and Magdalena appear. Sachs announces to the group that a new master-song has been born, which, following the rules of the mastersingers, is to be [[baptized]]. As an apprentice cannot serve as a witness for the baptism, he promotes David to the rank of [[journeyman]] with the traditional cuff on the ear (and by this also \"promoting\" him as a groom and Magdalena as a bride). He then christens the Prize Song the ''Morning Dream Song'' (''Selige Morgentraumdeut-Weise''). After celebrating their good fortune with an extended quintet ''(Selig, wie die Sonne meines Gl\u00fcckes lacht)'' \u2013 musically capping the first four scenes of act 3 \u2013 the group departs for the festival.\n\n===Act 3, Scene 5===\nAlmost an act in itself, this scene occupies about 45 minutes of the two hours of act 3 and is separated from the preceding four scenes by a ''Verwandlungsmusik'', a transforming Interlude. ''Meadow on the [[Pegnitz River]]''. It is the [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist|Feast of St. John]].\n\nVarious guilds enter boasting of their contributions to N\u00fcrnberg's success as a city. Wagner depicts three: the Cobblers, whose chorus, ''Sankt Krispin, lobet ihn!'', uses the signature cry ''streck! streck! streck!''; the Tailors, who sing the chorus ''Als N\u00fcrnberg belagert war'' with the goat cry ''meck! meck! meck!''; and the Bakers, who cut the tailors off with ''Hungersnot! Hungersnot!'', or ''Famine, famine!'', and its ''beck! beck! beck!'', or ''bake, bake, bake!''\n\nThis sequence leads into the well-known ''Tanz der Lehrbuben'', or Dance of the Apprentices. The mastersingers themselves then arrive grandly in a section usually referred to as the \u201cProcession of the Masters.\u201d The crowd sings the praises of Hans Sachs, the most beloved and famous of the mastersingers. Here Wagner provides a rousing chorus, ''Wach\u2019 auf, es nahet gen den Tag'', using words written by the historical Sachs himself and musically relates it to the \u201cWittenberg Nightingale.\u201d\n\nThe prize contest begins. Beckmesser attempts to sing the verses that he had obtained from Sachs. However, he garbles the words ''(Morgen ich leuchte)'' and fails to fit them to an appropriate melody, and ends up singing so clumsily that the crowd laughs him off. Before storming off in anger, he yells that the song was not even his: Hans Sachs tricked him into singing it. The crowd is confused. How could the great Hans Sachs have written such a bad song? Sachs tells them that the song is not his own, and also that it is in fact a beautiful song which the masters will love when they hear it sung correctly. To prove this, he calls a witness: Walther. The people are so curious about the song (correctly worded as ''Morgenlich leuchtend im rosigen Schein'') that they allow Walther to sing it, and everyone is won over in spite of its novelty.{{Listen|type=music|filename=Richard Wagner - Preisleid from Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg sung by Leo_Slezak 3.ogg\n|title=\"Morgenlich leuchtend im rosigen Schein\" (Walther's Prize song)|description=Sung by [[Leo Slezak]] in 1910 for [[Edison Records]]}}\n\nThey declare Walther the winner, and the mastersingers want to make him a member of their guild on the spot. At first Walther is tempted to reject their offer, but Sachs intervenes once more and explains that art, even ground-breaking, contrary art like Walther's, can only exist within a cultural tradition, which tradition the art sustains and improves. Walther is convinced; he agrees to join. Pogner places the symbolic master-hood medal around his neck, Eva takes his hand, and the people sing once more the praises of Hans Sachs, the beloved mastersinger of Nuremberg.\n\n==Interpretation of the character and role of Beckmesser==\nThe Wagner scholar [[Barry Millington]] has advanced the idea that Beckmesser represents a [[Stereotypes of Jews|Jewish stereotype]], whose humiliation by the [[Aryan race|Aryan]] Walther is an onstage representation of Wagner's [[antisemitism]].<ref>Millington, Barry (Ed.)

It is among the longest operas commonly performed, usually taking around four and a half hours. It was first performed at the [[National Theatre Munich|K\u00f6nigliches Hof- und National-Theater]], today the home of the [[Bavarian State Opera]], in Munich, on 21 June 1868. The conductor at the premiere was [[Hans von B\u00fclow]].\n\nThe story is set in [[Nuremberg]] in the mid-16th century. At the time, Nuremberg was a [[free imperial city]] and one of the centers of the [[Renaissance]] in Northern Europe. The story revolves around the city's [[guild]] of ''[[Meistersinger]]'' (Master Singers), an association of amateur poets and musicians who were primarily [[Master craftsman|master craftsmen]] of various trades. The master singers had developed a craftsmanlike approach to music-making, with an intricate system of rules for composing and performing songs. The work draws much of its atmosphere from its depiction of the Nuremberg of the era and the traditions of the master-singer guild. One of the main characters, the cobbler-poet Hans Sachs, is based on a historical figure, [[Hans Sachs]] (1494\u20131576), the most famous of the master-singers.\n\n''Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg'' occupies a unique place in Wagner's oeuvre. It is the only comedy among his mature operas (he had come to reject his early ''[[Das Liebesverbot]]''), and is also unusual among his works in being set in a historically well-defined time and place rather than in a mythical or legendary setting. It is the only mature Wagner opera based on an entirely original story, devised by Wagner himself, and in which no supernatural or magical powers or events are in evidence. It incorporates many of the operatic conventions that Wagner had railed against in his essays on the theory of opera: rhymed verse, [[aria]]s, [[Choir|chorus]]es, a [[quintet]], and even a [[ballet]].\n\n==Composition history==\nWagner's autobiography {{Lang|de|[[Mein Leben (Wagner)|Mein Leben]]}} (''My Life'') described the genesis of {{Lang|de|Die Meistersinger}}.{{sfn|Warrack|1994|p={{page needed|date=March 2020}}}} [[Spa town|Taking the waters]] at [[Marienbad]] in 1845 he began reading [[Georg Gottfried Gervinus]]' ''Geschichte der deutschen Dichtung'' (History of German Poetry). This work included chapters on mastersong and on Hans Sachs.<blockquote>\nI had formed a particularly vivid picture of Hans Sachs and the mastersingers of Nuremberg. I was especially intrigued by the institution of the Marker and his function in rating master-songs ... I conceived during a walk a comic scene in which the popular artisan-poet, by hammering upon his cobbler's last, gives the Marker, who is obliged by circumstances to sing in his presence, his come-uppance for previous pedantic misdeeds during official singing contests, by inflicting upon him a lesson of his own.<ref name=Gray>Wagner, Richard, tr. Andrew Gray (1992)</ref></blockquote>\n\nGervinus' book also mentions a poem by the real-life Hans Sachs on the subject of Protestant reformer [[Martin Luther]], called ''Die Wittenbergisch Nachtigall'' (The Wittenberg Nightingale). The opening lines for this poem, addressing the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], were later used by Wagner in act 3 scene 5 when the crowd acclaims Sachs: ''Wacht auf, es nahet gen den Tag; ich h\u00f6r' singen im gr\u00fcnen Hag ein wonnigliche Nachtigall.'' (Awake, the dawn is drawing near; I hear, singing in the green grove, a blissful nightingale)\n\nIn addition to this, Wagner added a scene drawn from his own life, in which a case of mistaken identity led to a near-riot: this was to be the basis for the finale of act 2.\n<blockquote>Out of this situation evolved an uproar, which through the shouting and clamour and an inexplicable growth in the number of participants in the struggle soon assumed a truly demoniacal character. It looked to me as if the whole town would break out into a riot...Then suddenly I heard a heavy thump, and as if by magic the whole crowd dispersed in every direction...One of the regular patrons had felled one of the noisiest rioters ... And it was the effect of this which had scattered everybody so suddenly.<ref name=Gray /></blockquote>\n\nThis first draft of the story was dated \"Marienbad 16 July 1845\". Wagner later said, in ''Eine Mitteilung an meine Freunde'' (1851) (A Communication to my Friends)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.belgacom.net/wagnerlibrary/prose/wagcomm.htm|title=A Communication to my Friends|first=Richard|last=Wagner|website=Users.belgacom.net|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref> that {{Lang|de|Meistersinger}} was to be a comic opera to follow a tragic opera, i.e. ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]''. Just as the [[Athenians]] had followed a tragedy with a comic [[satyr play]], so Wagner would follow {{Lang|de|Tannh\u00e4user}} with {{Lang|de|Meistersinger}}: the link being that both operas included song-contests.\n\n===Influence of Schopenhauer===\nIn 1854, Wagner first read [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], and was struck by the philosopher's theories on [[aesthetics]].<ref>[[Schopenhauer's aesthetics]]</ref> In this philosophy, art is a means for escaping from the sufferings of the world, and music is the highest of the arts since it is the only one not involved in representation of the world (i.e. it is abstract). It is for this reason that music can communicate emotion without the need for words. In his earlier essay ''Oper und Drama'' (Opera and Drama) (1850\u20131)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.belgacom.net/wagnerlibrary/prose/wlpr0063.htm|title=Opera and Drama|first=Richard|last=Wagner|website=Users.belgacom.net|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref> Wagner had derided staples of operatic construction: arias, choruses, duets, trios, recitatives, etc. As a result of reading Schopenhauer's ideas about the role of music, Wagner re-evaluated his prescription for opera, and included many of these elements in {{Lang|de|Die Meistersinger}}.\n\nAlthough {{Lang|de|Die Meistersinger}} is a comedy, it also elucidates Wagner's ideas on the place of music in society, on renunciation of  ''Wille'' ([[Will (philosophy)|Will]]), and on the solace that music can bring in a world full of {{Lang|de|Wahn}} (delusion, folly, self-deception). It is {{Lang|de|Wahn}} which causes the riot in act 2 \u2013 a sequence of events arising from a case of mistaken identity, which can be seen as a form of self-delusion. Commentators have observed that in his famous act 3 monologue {{Lang|de|Wahn, Wahn, \u00fcberall Wahn}} (Madness! Madness!, Everywhere madness!), Sachs paraphrases Schopenhauer's description of the way that {{Lang|de|Wahn}} drives a person to behave in ways that are self-destructive:<ref>Magee, Bryan (2002). ''The Tristan Chord''. Owl Books, New York. {{ISBN|0-8050-7189-X}}.

The character of Hans Sachs became one of the most Schopenhauerian of Wagner's creations. Wagner scholar Lucy Beckett{{sfn|Warrack|1994|loc=chapter 4}} has noted the remarkable similarity between Wagner's Sachs and Schopenhauer's description of the noble man:\n\n<blockquote>We always picture a very noble character to ourselves as having a certain trace of silent sadness... It is a consciousness that has resulted from knowledge of the vanity of all achievements and of the suffering of all life, not merely of one's own. (Schopenhauer: ''Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung'' \u2013 The World as Will and Representation)</blockquote>\n\nThe other distinctive manifestation of Sachs's character \u2013 his calm renunciation of the prospect of becoming a suitor for Eva's love \u2013 is also deeply Schopenhauerian.<ref>Magee, Bryan (2002). ''The Tristan Chord''. Chapter 14</ref> Sachs here denies the [[Will (philosophy)|Will]] in its supposedly most insistent form, that of sexual love. Wagner marks this moment with a direct musical and textual reference to ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'': {{Lang|de|Mein Kind, von Tristan und Isolde kenn' ich ein traurig St\u00fcck. Hans Sachs war klug und wollte nichts von Herrn Markes Gl\u00fcck.}} (\"My child, I know a sad tale of Tristan and Isolde. Hans Sachs was clever and did not want anything of King Marke's lot.\")\n\n===Completion and premiere===\nHaving completed the [[scenario]], Wagner began writing the [[libretto]] while living in Paris in 1862, and followed this by composing the [[overture]]. The overture was publicly performed in [[Leipzig]] on 2 November 1862, conducted by the composer.<ref>Richard Sternfeld, preface to the complete vocal and orchestral score, Dover Publications, 1976</ref> Composition of act 1 was begun in spring of 1863 in the Viennese suburb of [[Penzing (Vienna)|Penzing]], but the opera in its entirety was not finished until October 1867, when Wagner was living at [[Tribschen]] near [[Lucerne]]. These years were some of Wagner's most difficult: the 1861 Paris production of [[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|''Tannh\u00e4user'']] was a fiasco, Wagner gave up hope of completing ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', the 1864 Vienna production of ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' was abandoned after 77 rehearsals, and finally in 1866 Wagner's first wife, [[Minna Planer|Minna]], died. [[Cosima Wagner]] was later to write: \"When future generations seek refreshment in this unique work, may they spare a thought for the tears from which the smiles arose.\"\n\nThe premiere was given at the [[National Theatre Munich|K\u00f6nigliches Hof- und National-Theater]], Munich, on 21 June 1868. The production was sponsored by [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] and the conductor was [[Hans von B\u00fclow]]. [[Franz Strauss]], the father of the composer [[Richard Strauss]], played the [[French horn]] at the premiere, despite his often-expressed dislike of Wagner, who was present at many of the rehearsals. Wagner's frequent interruptions and digressions made rehearsals a very long-winded affair. After one 5 hour rehearsal, Franz Strauss led a strike by the orchestra, saying that he could not play any more. Despite these problems, the premiere was a triumph, and the opera was hailed as one of Wagner's most successful works. At the end of the first performance, the audience called for Wagner, who appeared at the front of the Royal box, which he had been sharing with King Ludwig. Wagner bowed to the crowd, breaking court protocol, which dictated that only the monarch could address an audience from the box.<ref>Gregor-Dellin, Martin (1983) ''Richard Wagner: his life, his work, his Century''.

Eva and Walther have fallen in love at first sight, but she informs him that her father, the goldsmith and mastersinger Veit Pogner, has arranged to give her hand in marriage to the winner of the guild's song contest on St. John's Day ([[Midsummer|Midsummer's Day]]), tomorrow. Eva's maid, Magdalena, gets David, Hans Sachs's apprentice, to tell Walther about the mastersingers' art. The hope is for Walther to qualify as a mastersinger during the guild meeting, traditionally held in the church after Mass, and thus earn a place in the song contest despite his utter ignorance of the master-guild's rules and conventions.\n\n''Scene 2''\n\nAs the other apprentices set up the church for the meeting, David warns Walther that it is not easy to become a mastersinger; it takes many years of learning and practice. David gives a confusing lecture on the mastersingers' rules for composing and singing. (Many of the tunes he describes were real master-tunes from the period.) Walther is confused by the complicated rules, but is determined to try for a place in the guild anyway.\n\n''Scene 3''\n\nThe first mastersingers file into the church, including Eva's wealthy father Veit Pogner and the town clerk Beckmesser. Beckmesser, a clever technical singer who was expecting to win the contest without opposition, is distressed to see that Walther is Pogner's guest and intends to enter the contest. Meanwhile, Pogner introduces Walther to the other mastersingers as they arrive. Fritz Kothner the baker, serving as chairman of this meeting, calls the roll. Pogner, addressing the assembly, announces his offer of his daughter's hand for the winner of the song contest. When Hans Sachs argues that Eva ought to have a say in the matter, Pogner agrees that Eva may refuse the winner of the contest, but she must still marry a mastersinger. Another suggestion by Sachs, that the townspeople, rather than the masters, should be called upon to judge the winner of the contest, is rejected by the other masters. Pogner formally introduces Walther as a candidate for admission into the masterguild. Questioned by Kothner about his background, Walther states that his teacher in poetry was [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] whose works he studied in his own private library in Franconia, and his teachers in music were the birds and nature itself. Reluctantly the masters agree to admit him, provided he can perform a master-song of his own composition. Walther chooses love as the topic for his song and therefore is to be judged by Beckmesser alone, the \"Marker\" of the guild for [[Profanum|worldly]] matters.  At the signal to begin (''Fanget an!''), Walther launches into a novel free-form tune (''So rief der Lenz in den Wald''), breaking all the mastersingers' rules, and his song is constantly interrupted by the scratch of Beckmesser's chalk on his [[chalkboard]], maliciously noting one violation after another. When Beckmesser has completely covered the slate with symbols of Walther's errors, he interrupts the song and argues that there is no point in finishing it. Sachs tries to convince the masters to let Walther continue, but Beckmesser sarcastically tells Sachs to stop trying to set policy and instead, to finish making his (Beckmesser's) new shoes, which are overdue. Raising his voice over the masters' argument, Walther finishes his song, but the masters reject him and he rushes out of the church.\n\n===Act 2===\n''Scene 1: Evening in a Nuremberg street, at the corner between Pogner's house and Hans Sachs's house, opposite. A lime tree stands outside Pogner's house, an elder outside Sachs's. The apprentices are closing the shutters''\n\nDavid informs Magdalena of Walther's failure. In her disappointment, Magdalena leaves without giving David the food she had brought for him. This arouses the derision of the other apprentices, and David is about to turn on them when Sachs arrives and hustles his apprentice into the workshop.\n\n''Scene 2''\n\nPogner arrives with Eva, engaging in a roundabout conversation: Eva is hesitant to ask about the outcome of Walther's application, and Pogner has private doubts about whether it was wise to offer his daughter's hand in marriage for the song contest. As they enter their house, Magdalena appears and tells Eva about the rumours of Walther's failure. Eva decides to ask Sachs about the matter.\n\n''Scene 3''\n\nAs twilight falls, Hans Sachs takes a seat in front of his house, to work on a new pair of shoes for Beckmesser. He muses on Walther's song, which has made a deep impression on him.  (\"''Was duftet doch der Flieder''\", often called \"the ''Fliedermonolog''\")\n\n''Scene 4''\n\nEva approaches Sachs, and they discuss tomorrow's song contest. Eva is unenthusiastic about Beckmesser, who appears to be the only eligible contestant. She hints that she would not mind if Sachs, a widower, were to win the contest. Though touched, Sachs protests that he would be too old a husband for her. Upon further prompting, Sachs describes Walther's failure at the guild meeting. This causes Eva to storm off angrily, confirming Sachs's suspicion that she has fallen in love with Walther. Eva is intercepted by Magdalena, who informs her that Beckmesser is coming to [[serenade]] her. Eva, determined to search for Walther, tells Magdalena to pose as her (Eva) at the bedroom window.\n\n''Scene 5''\n\nJust as Eva is about to leave, Walther appears. He tells her that he has been rejected by the mastersingers, and the two prepare to elope. However, Sachs has overheard their plans. As they are passing by, he illuminates the street with his lantern, forcing them to hide in the shadow of Pogner's house. Walther makes up his mind to confront Sachs, but is interrupted by the arrival of Beckmesser.\n\n''Scene 6''\n\nAs Eva and Walther retreat further into the shadows, Beckmesser begins his serenade. Sachs interrupts him by launching into a full-bellied cobbling song, and hammering the soles of the half-made shoes. Annoyed, Beckmesser tells Sachs to stop, but the cobbler replies that he has to finish tempering the soles of the shoes, whose lateness Beckmesser had publicly complained about (in act 1). Sachs offers a compromise: he will be quiet and let Beckmesser sing, but he (Sachs) will be Beckmesser's \"marker\", and mark each of Beckmesser's musical/poetical errors by striking one of the soles with his hammer. Beckmesser, who has spotted someone at Eva's window (Magdalena in disguise), has no time to argue. He tries to sing his serenade, but he makes so many mistakes (his tune repeatedly places accents on the wrong syllables of the words) that from the repeated knocks Sachs finishes the shoes. David wakes up and sees Beckmesser apparently serenading Magdalena. He attacks Beckmesser in a fit of jealous rage. The entire  neighborhood is awakened by the noise. The other apprentices rush into the fray, and the situation degenerates into a full-blown riot. In the confusion, Walther tries to escape with Eva, but Sachs pushes Eva into her home and drags Walther into his own workshop. Quiet is restored as abruptly as it was broken. A lone figure walks through the street \u2013 the nightwatchman, calling out the hour.\n\n===Act 3, scenes 1\u20134===\n''Prelude (Vorspiel)'', a meditative orchestral introduction using music from two key episodes to be heard in act 3: Sachs's scene 1 monologue \"Wahn! Wahn!\" and the \"Wittenburg Nightingale\" quasi-chorale sung by the townspeople to greet Sachs in scene 5.\n[[File:Meistersinger.jpg|thumb|Act 3, painting by [[Ferdinand Leeke]]]]\n\n''Scene 1: Sachs's workshop''\n\nAs morning dawns, Sachs is reading a large book. Lost in thought, he does not respond as David returns from delivering Beckmesser's shoes. David finally manages to attract his master's attention, and they discuss the upcoming festivities \u2013 it is St. John's day, Hans Sachs's [[name day]]. David recites his verses for Sachs, and leaves to prepare for the festival. Alone, Sachs ponders last night's riot. \"Madness! Madness! Everywhere madness!\" (''Wahn! Wahn! \u00dcberall Wahn!'') His attempt to prevent an elopement had ended in shocking violence. Nevertheless, he is resolved to make madness work for him today.\n\n''Scene 2''\n\nSachs gives Walther an interactive lesson on the history and philosophy of music and mastersinging, and teaches him to moderate his singing according to the spirit (if not the strict letter) of the masters' rules. Walther demonstrates his understanding by composing two sections of a new Prize Song in a more acceptable style than his previous effort from act 1. Sachs writes down the new verses as Walther sings them. A final section remains to be composed, but Walther postpones the task. The two men leave the room to dress for the festival.\n\n''Scene 3''\n\nBeckmesser, still sore from his drubbing the night before, enters the workshop. He spots the verses of the Prize Song, written in Sachs's handwriting, and infers (erroneously) that Sachs is secretly planning to enter the contest for Eva's hand. The cobbler re-enters the room and Beckmesser confronts him with the verses and asks if he wrote them. Sachs confirms that the handwriting is his, but does not clarify that he was not the author but merely served as scribe.  However, he goes on to say that he has no intention of wooing Eva or entering the contest, and he presents the manuscript to Beckmesser as a gift. He promises never to claim the song for his own, and warns Beckmesser that it is a very difficult song to interpret and sing. Beckmesser, his confidence restored by the prospect of using verses written by the famous Hans Sachs, ignores the warning and rushes off to prepare for the song contest. Sachs smiles at Beckmesser's foolishness but expresses hope that Beckmesser will learn to be better in the future.\n\n''Scene 4''\n\nEva arrives at the workshop. She is looking for Walther, but pretends to have complaints about a shoe that Sachs made for her. Sachs realizes that the shoe is a perfect fit, but pretends to set about altering the stitching. As he works, he tells Eva that he has just heard a beautiful song, lacking only an ending. Eva cries out as Walther enters the room, splendidly attired for the festival, and sings the third and final section of the Prize Song. The couple are overwhelmed with gratitude for Sachs, and Eva asks Sachs to forgive her for having manipulated his feelings. The cobbler brushes them off with bantering complaints about his lot as a shoemaker, poet, and widower. At last, however, he admits to Eva that, despite his feelings for her, he is resolved to avoid the fate of [[Mark of Cornwall|King Marke]] (a reference to the subject of another Wagner opera, ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', in which an old man tries to marry a much-younger woman), thus conferring his blessing upon the lovers. David and Magdalena appear. Sachs announces to the group that a new master-song has been born, which, following the rules of the mastersingers, is to be [[baptized]]. As an apprentice cannot serve as a witness for the baptism, he promotes David to the rank of [[journeyman]] with the traditional cuff on the ear (and by this also \"promoting\" him as a groom and Magdalena as a bride). He then christens the Prize Song the ''Morning Dream Song'' (''Selige Morgentraumdeut-Weise''). After celebrating their good fortune with an extended quintet ''(Selig, wie die Sonne meines Gl\u00fcckes lacht)'' \u2013 musically capping the first four scenes of act 3 \u2013 the group departs for the festival.\n\n===Act 3, Scene 5===\nAlmost an act in itself, this scene occupies about 45 minutes of the two hours of act 3 and is separated from the preceding four scenes by a ''Verwandlungsmusik'', a transforming Interlude. ''Meadow on the [[Pegnitz River]]''. It is the [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist|Feast of St. John]].\n\nVarious guilds enter boasting of their contributions to N\u00fcrnberg\u2019s success as a city. Wagner depicts three: the Cobblers, whose chorus, ''Sankt Krispin, lobet ihn!'', uses the signature cry ''streck! streck! streck!''; the Tailors, who sing the chorus ''Als N\u00fcrnberg belagert war'' with the goat cry ''meck! meck! meck!''; and the Bakers, who cut the tailors off with ''Hungersnot! Hungersnot!'', or ''Famine, famine!'', and its ''beck! beck! beck!'', or ''bake, bake, bake!''\n\nThis sequence leads into the well-known ''Tanz der Lehrbuben'', or Dance of the Apprentices. The mastersingers themselves then arrive grandly in a section usually referred to as the \u201cProcession of the Masters.\u201d The crowd sings the praises of Hans Sachs, the most beloved and famous of the mastersingers. Here Wagner provides a rousing chorus, ''Wach\u2019 auf, es nahet gen den Tag'', using words written by the historical Sachs himself and musically relates it to the \u201cWittenberg Nightingale.\u201d\n\nThe prize contest begins. Beckmesser attempts to sing the verses that he had obtained from Sachs. However, he garbles the words ''(Morgen ich leuchte)'' and fails to fit them to an appropriate melody, and ends up singing so clumsily that the crowd laughs him off. Before storming off in anger, he yells that the song was not even his: Hans Sachs tricked him into singing it. The crowd is confused. How could the great Hans Sachs have written such a bad song? Sachs tells them that the song is not his own, and also that it is in fact a beautiful song which the masters will love when they hear it sung correctly. To prove this, he calls a witness: Walther. The people are so curious about the song (correctly worded as ''Morgenlich leuchtend im rosigen Schein'') that they allow Walther to sing it, and everyone is won over in spite of its novelty.{{Listen|type=music|filename=Richard Wagner - Preisleid from Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg sung by Leo_Slezak 3.ogg\n|title=\"Morgenlich leuchtend im rosigen Schein\" (Walther's Prize song)|description=Sung by [[Leo Slezak]] in 1910 for [[Edison Records]]}}\n\nThey declare Walther the winner, and the mastersingers want to make him a member of their guild on the spot. At first Walther is tempted to reject their offer, but Sachs intervenes once more and explains that art, even ground-breaking, contrary art like Walther\u2019s, can only exist within a cultural tradition, which tradition the art sustains and improves. Walther is convinced; he agrees to join. Pogner places the symbolic master-hood medal around his neck, Eva takes his hand, and the people sing once more the praises of Hans Sachs, the beloved mastersinger of Nuremberg.\n\n==Interpretation of the character and role of Beckmesser==\nThe Wagner scholar [[Barry Millington]] has advanced the idea that Beckmesser represents a [[Stereotypes of Jews|Jewish stereotype]], whose humiliation by the [[Aryan race|Aryan]] Walther is an onstage representation of Wagner's [[antisemitism]].<ref>Millington, Barry (Ed.) (1992). ''The Wagner Compendium: A Guide to Wagner's Life and Music''. Thames and Hudson Ltd., London. {{ISBN|0-02-871359-1}} p. 304.</ref> Millington argued in his 1991 \"Nuremberg Trial: Is There Anti-Semitism in {{Lang|de|Die Meistersinger}}?\" that common antisemitic stereotypes prevalent in 19th-century Germany were a part of the \"ideological fabric\" of {{Lang|de|Die Meistersinger}} and that Beckmesser embodied these unmistakable antisemitic characteristics.<ref>Millington, Barry. \"Wagner Washed Whiter.\" ''[[The Musical Times]]'', Vol. 137, No. 1846 (December 1996), pp. 5\u20138.</ref> Millington's article spurred significant debate among Wagner scholars including [[Charles Rosen]],<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2544 \"Wagner's Anti-Semitism\"], ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''</ref> [[Hans Rudolph Vaget]],<ref>Vaget, Hans Rudolf. \"Wagner, Anti-Semitism, and Mr. Rose: Merkw\u00fcrd'ger Fall!\", ''The German Quarterly'', Vol. 66, No. 2 (Spring 1993). pp. 222\u2013236.</ref> [[Paul Lawrence Rose]],<ref>Rose, Paul Lawrence. \"The Wagner Problem in the History of German antisemitism.\" ''The German Quarterly''.

Her response was, \"With Beckmesser he probably did.\"<ref>Tenenbom, Tuvia. [http://www.zeit.de/2009/34/Bayreuth/komplettansicht \"{{Lang|de|Hallo, Herr Hitler!}}\"], ''[[Die Zeit]]'', August 13, 2009.</ref>\n\nScholars [[Dieter Borchmeyer]], [[Udo Bermbach]] and [[Hermann Danuser]] support the thesis that with the character of Beckmesser, Wagner did not intend to allude to Jewish stereotypes, but rather to criticize (academic) pedantism in general. They point out similarities to the figure of [[Malvolio]] in Shakespeare's comedy ''[[Twelfth Night]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bermbach|first=Udo |display-authors=etal |title=Wagnerspectrum: Schwerpunkt Wagner und das Komische|year=2007|publisher=K\u00f6nigshausen & Neumann|isbn=978-3-8260-3714-6|language=German}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the score calls for Beckmesser to rush off in a huff after his self-defeating attempt to sing Walther's song, in some productions he remains and listens to Walther's correct rendition of his song, and shakes hands with Sachs after the final monologue.<ref>Australian Opera, 1990, conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras, manufactured by Public Media Homevision.

We know that the original name of the Beckmesser character was \"Veit Hanslich,\" and we know that Wagner invited Hanslick to his initial reading of the libretto, though whether then the character still had the \"Hanslich\" name when Hanslick heard it is unclear.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EB9DeJkserYC&pg=PA171&lpg=PA171&dq=Veit+Hanslich#v=onepage&q=Veit+Hanslich&f=false|title=Wagner's Meistersinger: Performance, History, Representation|first=Nicholas|last=Vazsonyi|date=19 May 2018|publisher=University Rochester Press|accessdate=19 May 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9781580461689}}</ref>  This second interpretation of Beckmesser may dovetail with the antisemitism interpretation above, as Wagner attacked Hanslick as 'of gracefully concealed Jewish origin' in his revised edition of his essay [[Das Judenthum in der Musik|Jewishness in Music]].\n\n==Reception==\n{{Lang|de|Die Meistersinger}} was enthusiastically received at its premiere in 1868, and was judged to be Wagner's most immediately appealing work. [[Eduard Hanslick]] wrote in {{Lang|de|Die Neue Freie Presse}} after the premiere: \"Dazzling scenes of colour and splendour, ensembles full of life and character unfold before the spectator's eyes, hardly allowing him the leisure to weigh how much and how little of these effects is of musical origin.\"\n\nWithin a year of the premiere the opera was performed across Germany at [[Dresden]], [[Dessau]], [[Karlsruhe]], [[Mannheim]], [[Weimar]], [[Hanover]] and [[Vienna]] with [[Berlin]] following in 1870.<ref>Carnegy (1994) pp. 137\u2013138.</ref> It was one of the most popular and prominent German operas during the [[Unification of Germany]] in 1871, and in spite of the opera's overall warning against cultural self-centeredness, {{Lang|de|Die Meistersinger}} became a potent symbol of [[patriotism|patriotic]] German art.

They will then step to the side (and possibly slightly forward, in relation to the man) on the other foot, and conclude the figure by closing the first foot beside the second. Each step takes up a full beat of the music.\n\nA turn of up to 1/8 is optional.  There will be slight [[contra body movement]] (CBM) on 1, and [[sway (dance)|sway]] on 2,3.\n\n;Leader (man)\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\"\n|-style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!

Some of the better known dog training procedures include the Koehler method, clicker training, motivational training, electronic training, model-rival training, dominance-based training, and relationship-based training. The common characteristics of successful methods are knowing the animal's attributes and personality, accurate timing of reinforcement or punishment and consistent communication. The use of punishment is controversial with both the humaneness and effectiveness questioned by many behaviourists.\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Dog training.jpg|thumb|250px|Dog training using positive reinforcement, with the dog exhibiting the \"down\" position]]\nDog training is the act of teaching a dog particular skills or behaviours.

Two complementary motivations drive instrumental learning: the maximization of positive outcomes and minimization of aversive ones.<ref>Lindsay 2000, p. 247\u2013248</ref> There are two ways in which behavior is reinforced or strengthened: [[positive reinforcement]] occurs when a behavior is strengthened by producing some desirable consequence; negative reinforcement occurs when a behavior is strengthened by avoiding some undesirable consequence. There are two ways in which behavior is decreased or weakened: negative punishment occurs when a behavior is weakened by not producing a reinforcing consequence; and [[positive punishment]] occurs when a behavior is weakened by producing a consequence that is a disincentive. In combination, these basic reinforcing and punishing contingencies provide four ways for modifying behavior.<ref>Lindsay 2000, p. 246\u2013247.</ref> Reinforcement increases the relative probability or frequency of the behavior it follows, while punishment decreases the relative probability or frequency of the behaviour it follows.\n\nTypical positive reinforcement events will satisfy some [[Physiology|physiological]] or [[Psychology|psychological]] need, so it can be food, a game, or a demonstration of affection. Different dogs will find different things reinforcing. Negative reinforcement occurs when a dog discovers that a particular response ends the presentation of an aversive stimulus. An aversive is anything that the dog does not like, such as verbal admonishment, or a tightened choke chain.<ref>Lindsay 2000, p. 253.</ref>\n\nPunishment is operationally defined as an event that lowers the probability of the behavior that it follows. It is not \"punishment\" in the common sense of the word,<ref>Lindsay 2000, p. 251.</ref> and does not mean physical or psychological harm and most certainly does not mean abuse. Punishment simply involves the presentation of an undesired consequence ([[positive punishment]]) when the wrong behavior is performed, such as a snap of the leash, or the removal of a desired consequence ([[negative punishment]]) when the wrong behavior is performed, such as the trainer eating the cheese that would have been the reward.<ref name=\"Reid 1996, p. 108\">Reid 1996, p. 108.</ref> A behavior that has previously been developed may cease if reinforcement stops; this is called [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]].

Cognitive learning is a process wherein dogs acquire and process information, rather than develop conditioned responses to stimuli.\n\nOne example of cognitive learning in dogs is the [[fast mapping]] inferential reasoning demonstrated by [[Chaser (dog)|Chaser]]<ref>http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/spackled/2011readings/Pilley_Border%20collie%20verbal%20referents_2010.pdf</ref> and Rico in controlled research environments. Both Rico and Chaser demonstrated the ability to infer the names of objects without conditioning and remember them indefinitely.\n\n==Training methods==\n\n===Koehler method===\nStrictly following the model set out in the ''Koehler Method of Dog Training'', some 50 years later, the Koehler method continues to be taught in both class and private training formats. The method is based in the philosophy that a dog acts on its right to choose its actions. Koehler explained that a dog's learned behavior is an act of choice based on its own learning experience. When those choices are influenced by the expectation of reward, the behavior will most likely be repeated, and when those choices are influenced by the anticipation of punishment, they will most likely cease. Once the dog has learned that its choices result in comfort or discomfort it can be taught to make the correct decisions. Action\u2192Memory\u2192Desire encapsulates the learning pattern used by the method; the dog acts, remembers the consequences, and forms the desire to repeat or avoid those consequences. Adherents believe that once the behavior has been correctly taught, it should be performed, thus making any correction, fair, reasonable, and expected.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ancheta | first = Tony| title =Koehler Dog Training| url = http://www.koehlerdogtraining.com/home.html| accessdate = 2 December 2012}}</ref> While the model has been used consistently since 1962, some of the punishment procedures described in the book are now considered not necessary, humane, or appropriate by many trainers.<ref name=Burch/>\n\n===Motivational training===\nPurely positive or motivational training employs the use of rewards to reinforce good behavior, and ignores all bad behavior.<ref name=\"Marlo 1999, p. 101\">Marlo 1999, p. 101.</ref> It is based in [[Edward Thorndike|Thorndike's]] [[Law of effect|Law of Effect]], which says that actions that produce rewards tend to increase in frequency and actions that do not produce rewards decrease in frequency.<ref>Burch 1999, p. 4.</ref>\n\nMotivational training has its roots in captive animal training, where compulsion and corrections are both difficult and dangerous, and ignoring bad behavior is not problematic as the animal lives under controlled conditions. As a dog training strategy, purely positive training is feasible, but difficult, as it requires time and patience to control the rewards the dog receives for behavior. Some activities such as jumping up or chasing squirrels are intrinsically rewarding, the activity is its own reward, and with some activities the environment may provide reinforcement such as when the response from dog next door encourages barking.<ref name=\"Marlo 1999, p. 101\"/>\n\n===Clicker training===\n[[Image:Dog clicker training.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Clicker-training using a metal [[clicker|cricket]]]]\n{{main|Clicker training}}\n[[Clicker training]] is a nickname given to a positive reinforcement training system based on [[operant conditioning]]. Clicker training can also be referred to as marker training. The system uses conditioned reinforcers which are able to be delivered more quickly and more precisely than primary reinforcers such as food. The term 'clicker' comes from a small metal cricket adapted from a child's toy that the trainer uses to precisely mark the desired behavior; however, some trainers use a whistle, a word, or even a light as the conditioned reinforcer.<ref>Pryor 1999, p. 4.</ref> The trainer delivers a [[primary reinforcer]], such as a toy or treat, after the noise or signal. A common critique of clicker training is that it is prone to the [[overjustification effect]].<ref>Evaluations of the Overjustification Effect\nKerri P. Peters and Timothy R.

Common forms are collars which can be triggered remotely, or that are triggered by barking, fencing that delivers a shock when a dog wearing a special collar crosses a buried wire, and mats that can be placed on furniture to deliver a shock. Some aids deliver an aversive such as a spray of citronella when triggered.<ref>Burch 1999, p. 162.</ref> The use of electric shock aversives for training dogs is the subject of considerable controversy. Supporters claim that the use of electronic devices allows training at a distance and the potential to eliminate self-rewarding behaviour, and point out that properly used, they have less risk of stress and injury than mechanical devices, such as choke chains. Opponents cite the risks of physical and psychological trauma associated with incorrect or abusive use.<ref name=shock>{{cite journal | last = Schalke | first =E.|author2=J. Stichnoth|author3=S.

Group A received an electric shock when the dogs touched the prey (a rabbit dummy fixed to a motion device). Group H received a shock when they did not obey a previously trained recall command during hunting. Dogs in group R received the electric shock arbitrarily, i.e. the shock was administered unpredictably and out of context. Group A did not show a significant rise in salivary cortisol levels, while group R and group H did show a significant rise. This led to the conclusion that animals which were able to clearly associate the electric stimulus with their action, i.e. touching the prey, and consequently were able to predict and control the stressor, did not show considerable or persistent stress indicators, while animals that were not able to control the situation to avoid the shock did show significant stress.<ref name=shock/>\n\nIn 2004 a study was published that was based on the observation of a variety of breeds trained for protection work using shock collars, which showed that although electronically trained dogs can excel as guard dogs, their behavior toward humans and work circumstances changed, often indicating heightened uncertainty and reactivity.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Schilder | first = Matthijs B.H. | author2 = Joanne A.M. van der Borg | title = Training dogs with help of the shock collar: short and long term behavioral effects | journal =Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume =85 | issue =3 | pages =319\u2013334| year =2004 | doi = 10.1016/j.applanim.2003.10.004 }}</ref>\n\nLindsay says of this study, \"Schilder and Van der Borg (2004) have published a report of disturbing findings regarding the short-term and long- term effects of shock used in the context of working dogs that is destined to become a source of significant controversy&nbsp;...

The model-rival training involved an interaction between the trainer, the dog, and a person acting as a model-rival, that is, a model for desired behaviour and a rival for the trainer's attention. In view of the dog, a dialogue concerning a particular toy commenced between the trainer and the model-rival. The trainer praised or scolded the model-rival depending on whether the model-rival had named the toy correctly. It was found that the performance times for completion of the task were similar for dogs trained with either operant conditioning or the model rival method.

Building on a positive relationship between them, the method sets out to achieve results that benefit both the dog and the trainer, while at the same time enhancing and strengthening their relationship. The basic principles include ensuring that the dog's basic needs have been met before beginning a training session, finding out what motivates the dog and using it to elicit behaviours, interpreting the dog's body language to improve communication between dog and trainer, using positive reinforcement to encourage desired behavior, training incompatible behaviors to replace unwanted behaviours, and controlling the dog's environment to limit the possibility of unwanted behaviours.<ref>{{cite web | last = Woodard | first = Sherry | title = Why We Use Relationship-Based Training| date =15 April 2011 | url = http://www.atlantapetrescue.org/2011/04/why-we-use-relationship-based-training/| accessdate = 2 December 2012}}</ref> A relationship-based approach to dog training is not reliant on using particular training aids or treats, the relationship is always there, and the connection between dog and trainer is sufficiently powerful to achieve the training goals.<ref>{{cite web| last = Clothier| first = Suzanne| title = Relationship Based Approach to Training| year = 2009| url = https://suzanneclothier.com/article/relationship-centered-training/| accessdate = 14 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Factors ==\nTraining can take as many forms as there are trainers, however a detailed study of animal trainers found common characteristics of successful methods: thoughtful interpretation of what the animal does prior to training, accurate timing, and consistent communication.<ref>McGreevy 2011, p. 280.</ref>\n\n=== Communication ===\n{{Main|Dog communication}}\nDogs have become closely associated with humans through domestication and have also become sensitive to human communicative signals. Generally, they have a lot of exposure to human speech, especially during play, and are believed to have a good ability to recognize human speech.\nTwo studies investigated the ability of a single dog that was believed to be exceptional in its understanding of language. Both studies revealed the potential for at least some dogs to develop an understanding of a large number of simple commands on the basis of just the sounds emitted by their owners. However the studies suggested that visual cues from the owner may be important for the understanding of more complex spoken commands.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Fukuzawa | first = M.|author2=D. S.

For example, [[Labrador retriever]]s are the favoured breed for the detection of [[explosive]]s. This is because of a combination of factors including their food drive which enables them to keep focused on a task despite noise and other distractions. Most working breeds of dogs are able to be trained to find people with their sense of smell (as opposed to their sense of sight). [[Cocker Spaniel]]s are able to be trained as part of a [[termite]] detection team. Their relatively small size enables them to fit into small spaces, and their light weight allows them to walk on areas of ceiling which would be dangerous to anything heavier. In fact, although unusual, termite detection dogs are much more reliable at detecting termites than humans who rely on a basic system of tapping and listening. Because of their ability to learn signals by sight and for their energetic and athletic natures, [[German Shepherd]]s are able to be trained for work alongside search and rescue teams and human apprehension teams.<ref>McGreevy 2011, p. 116\u2013279.</ref>\n\n== Individualised or class training ==\nIndividualised training is used with dogs that have an urgent or unique training problem such as fear, hyperactivity, aggression (and other related problems), separation anxiety, biting, excessive barking, insecurity, destructive behaviors, walking difficulties, and inappropriate elimination.<ref>{{cite web|title=Management and Rehabilitation of Inter-Dog Aggression in Animal Shelters|url=http://www.landfood.ubc.ca/animalwelfare/publications/pdfs/theses/Orihel_MSc.pdf|author=Jane S.

Tug \"toys\" made of any combination of fleece, fur, and rubber are often used as motivators when training in dog sports such as [[dog agility]] and [[flyball]].\n|-\n| [[Training treats]]\n| Training treats may be used as rewards for completing the desired behavior by trainers who practice [[behaviorism]].\n|-\n| [[Dog Clicker]]\n| A clicker is a small instrument, usually made of plastic and containing a small strip of bent metal that makes a \"click\" noise when depressed.  The metal may be pressed directly with the thumb or by an external button.  Clickers are often used in reinforcement-based training (or \"Clicker training\") to indicate to the dog when it has completed the desired behavior.\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alpha roll]]\n* [[Bark (dog)]]\n* [[Conformation show]]ing\n* [[Dog agility]]\n* [[Dog sports]]\n* [[List of dog trainers]]\n* [[Dog bite prevention]]\n{{div col end}}\n'''General:'''\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Animal cognition]]\n* [[Animal training]]\n* [[Ethology]]\n* [[Operant conditioning]]\n* [[Classical conditioning]]\n* [[Punishment (psychology)]]\n* [[Reinforcement]]\n* [[Reward system]]\n* [[Dog behaviorist]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Arnold, Jennifer (2006).

Some of the better known dog training procedures include the Koehler method, clicker training, motivational training, electronic training, model-rival training, dominance-based training, and relationship-based training. The common characteristics of successful methods are knowing the animal's attributes and personality, accurate timing of reinforcement or punishment and consistent communication.

Two complementary motivations drive instrumental learning: the maximization of positive outcomes and minimization of aversive ones.<ref>Lindsay 2000, p. 247\u2013248</ref> There are two ways in which behavior is reinforced or strengthened: [[positive reinforcement]] occurs when a behavior is strengthened by producing some desirable consequence; negative reinforcement occurs when a behavior is strengthened by avoiding some undesirable consequence. There are two ways in which behavior is decreased or weakened: negative punishment occurs when a behavior is weakened by not producing a reinforcing consequence; and [[positive punishment]] occurs when a behavior is weakened by producing a consequence that is a disincentive. In combination, these basic reinforcing and punishing contingencies provide four ways for modifying behavior.<ref>Lindsay 2000, p. 246\u2013247.</ref> Reinforcement increases the relative probability or frequency of the behavior it follows, while punishment decreases the relative probability or frequency of the behaviour it follows.\n\nTypical positive reinforcement events will satisfy some [[Physiology|physiological]] or [[Psychology|psychological]] need, so it can be food, a game, or a demonstration of affection. Different dogs will find different things reinforcing. Negative reinforcement occurs when a dog discovers that a particular response ends the presentation of an aversive stimulus. An aversive is anything that the dog does not like, such as verbal admonishment, or a tightened choke chain.<ref>Lindsay 2000, p. 253.</ref>\n\nPunishment is operationally defined as an event that lowers the probability of the behavior that it follows. It is not \"punishment\" in the common sense of the word,<ref>Lindsay 2000, p. 251.</ref> and does not mean physical or psychological harm and most certainly does not mean abuse. Punishment simply involves the presentation of an undesired consequence ([[positive punishment]]) when the wrong behavior is performed, such as a snap of the leash, or the removal of a desired consequence ([[negative punishment]]) when the wrong behavior is performed, such as the trainer eating the cheese that would have been the reward.<ref name=\"Reid 1996, p. 108\">Reid 1996, p. 108.</ref> A behavior that has previously been developed may cease if reinforcement stops; this is called [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]].

Cognitive learning is a process wherein dogs acquire and process information, rather than develop conditioned responses to stimuli.\n\nOne example of cognitive learning in dogs is the [[fast mapping]] inferential reasoning demonstrated by [[Chaser (dog)|Chaser]]<ref>http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/spackled/2011readings/Pilley_Border%20collie%20verbal%20referents_2010.pdf</ref> and Rico in controlled research environments. Both Rico and Chaser demonstrated the ability to infer the names of objects without conditioning and remember them indefinitely.\n\n==Training methods==\n\n===Koehler method===\nStrictly following the model set out in the ''Koehler Method of Dog Training'', some 50 years later, the Koehler method continues to be taught in both class and private training formats. The method is based in the philosophy that a dog acts on its right to choose its actions. Koehler explained that a dog's learned behavior is an act of choice based on its own learning experience. When those choices are influenced by the expectation of reward, the behavior will most likely be repeated, and when those choices are influenced by the anticipation of punishment, they will most likely cease. Once the dog has learned that its choices result in comfort or discomfort it can be taught to make the correct decisions. Action\u2192Memory\u2192Desire encapsulates the learning pattern used by the method; the dog acts, remembers the consequences, and forms the desire to repeat or avoid those consequences. Adherents believe that once the behavior has been correctly taught, it should be performed, thus making any correction, fair, reasonable, and expected.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ancheta | first = Tony| title =Koehler Dog Training| url = http://www.koehlerdogtraining.com/home.html| accessdate = 2 December 2012}}</ref> While the model has been used consistently since 1962, some of the punishment procedures described in the book are now considered not necessary, humane, or appropriate by many trainers.<ref name=Burch/>\n\n===Motivational training===\nPurely positive or motivational training employs the use of rewards to reinforce good behavior, and ignores all bad behavior.<ref name=\"Marlo 1999, p. 101\">Marlo 1999, p. 101.</ref> It is based in [[Edward Thorndike|Thorndike's]] [[Law of effect|Law of Effect]], which says that actions that produce rewards tend to increase in frequency and actions that do not produce rewards decrease in frequency.<ref>Burch 1999, p. 4.</ref>\n\nMotivational training has its roots in captive animal training, where compulsion and corrections are both difficult and dangerous, and ignoring bad behavior is not problematic as the animal lives under controlled conditions. As a dog training strategy, purely positive training is feasible, but difficult, as it requires time and patience to control the rewards the dog receives for behavior. Some activities such as jumping up or chasing squirrels are intrinsically rewarding, the activity is its own reward, and with some activities the environment may provide reinforcement such as when the response from dog next door encourages barking.<ref name=\"Marlo 1999, p. 101\"/>\n\n===Clicker training===\n[[Image:Dog clicker training.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Clicker-training using a metal [[clicker|cricket]]]]\n{{main|Clicker training}}\n[[Clicker training]] is a nickname given to a positive reinforcement training system based on [[operant conditioning]]. Clicker training can also be referred to as marker training. The system uses conditioned reinforcers which are able to be delivered more quickly and more precisely than primary reinforcers such as food. The term 'clicker' comes from a small metal cricket adapted from a child's toy that the trainer uses to precisely mark the desired behavior; however, some trainers use a whistle, a word, or even a light as the conditioned reinforcer.<ref>Pryor 1999, p. 4.</ref> The trainer delivers a [[primary reinforcer]], such as a toy or treat, after the noise or signal. A common critique of clicker training is that it is prone to the [[overjustification effect]].<ref>Evaluations of the Overjustification Effect\nKerri P. Peters and Timothy R.

Common forms are collars which can be triggered remotely, or that are triggered by barking, fencing that delivers a shock when a dog wearing a special collar crosses a buried wire, and mats that can be placed on furniture to deliver a shock. Some aids deliver an aversive such as a spray of citronella when triggered.<ref>Burch 1999, p. 162.</ref> The use of electric shock aversives for training dogs is the subject of considerable controversy. Supporters claim that the use of electronic devices allows training at a distance and the potential to eliminate self-rewarding behaviour, and point out that properly used, they have less risk of stress and injury than mechanical devices, such as choke chains. Opponents cite the risks of physical and psychological trauma associated with incorrect or abusive use.<ref name=shock>{{cite journal | last = Schalke | first =E.|author2=J. Stichnoth|author3=S.

Group A received an electric shock when the dogs touched the prey (a rabbit dummy fixed to a motion device). Group H received a shock when they did not obey a previously trained recall command during hunting. Dogs in group R received the electric shock arbitrarily, i.e. the shock was administered unpredictably and out of context. Group A did not show a significant rise in salivary cortisol levels, while group R and group H did show a significant rise. This led to the conclusion that animals which were able to clearly associate the electric stimulus with their action, i.e. touching the prey, and consequently were able to predict and control the stressor, did not show considerable or persistent stress indicators, while animals that were not able to control the situation to avoid the shock did show significant stress.<ref name=shock/>\n\nIn 2004 a study was published that was based on the observation of a variety of breeds trained for protection work using shock collars, which showed that although electronically trained dogs can excel as guard dogs, their behavior toward humans and work circumstances changed, often indicating heightened uncertainty and reactivity.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Schilder | first = Matthijs B.H. | author2 = Joanne A.M. van der Borg | title = Training dogs with help of the shock collar: short and long term behavioral effects | journal =Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume =85 | issue =3 | pages =319\u2013334| year =2004 | doi = 10.1016/j.applanim.2003.10.004 }}</ref>\n\nLindsay says of this study, \"Schilder and Van der Borg (2004) have published a report of disturbing findings regarding the short-term and long- term effects of shock used in the context of working dogs that is destined to become a source of significant controversy&nbsp;...

McKinley and Young undertook a pilot study on the applicability of a modified version of the model-rival method to the training of domestic dogs, noting that the dog's origins as a member of large and complex social groups promote observational learning. The model-rival training involved an interaction between the trainer, the dog, and a person acting as a model-rival, that is, a model for desired behaviour and a rival for the trainer's attention. In view of the dog, a dialogue concerning a particular toy commenced between the trainer and the model-rival. The trainer praised or scolded the model-rival depending on whether the model-rival had named the toy correctly. It was found that the performance times for completion of the task were similar for dogs trained with either operant conditioning or the model rival method.

Building on a positive relationship between them, the method sets out to achieve results that benefit both the dog and the trainer, while at the same time enhancing and strengthening their relationship. The basic principles include ensuring that the dog's basic needs have been met before beginning a training session, finding out what motivates the dog and using it to elicit behaviours, interpreting the dog's body language to improve communication between dog and trainer, using positive reinforcement to encourage desired behavior, training incompatible behaviors to replace unwanted behaviours, and controlling the dog's environment to limit the possibility of unwanted behaviours.<ref>{{cite web | last = Woodard | first = Sherry | title = Why We Use Relationship-Based Training| date =15 April 2011 | url = http://www.atlantapetrescue.org/2011/04/why-we-use-relationship-based-training/| accessdate = 2 December 2012}}</ref> A relationship-based approach to dog training is not reliant on using particular training aids or treats, the relationship is always there, and the connection between dog and trainer is sufficiently powerful to achieve the training goals.<ref>{{cite web| last = Clothier| first = Suzanne| title = Relationship Based Approach to Training| year = 2009| url = https://suzanneclothier.com/article/relationship-centered-training/| accessdate = 14 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Factors ==\nTraining can take as many forms as there are trainers, however a detailed study of animal trainers found common characteristics of successful methods: thoughtful interpretation of what the animal does prior to training, accurate timing, and consistent communication.<ref>McGreevy 2011, p. 280.</ref>\n\n=== Communication ===\n{{Main|Dog communication}}\nDogs have become closely associated with humans through domestication and have also become sensitive to human communicative signals. Generally, they have a lot of exposure to human speech, especially during play, and are believed to have a good ability to recognize human speech.\nTwo studies investigated the ability of a single dog that was believed to be exceptional in its understanding of language. Both studies revealed the potential for at least some dogs to develop an understanding of a large number of simple commands on the basis of just the sounds emitted by their owners. However the studies suggested that visual cues from the owner may be important for the understanding of more complex spoken commands.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Fukuzawa | first = M.|author2=D. S.

For example, [[Labrador retriever]]s are the favoured breed for the detection of [[explosive]]s. This is because of a combination of factors including their food drive which enables them to keep focused on a task despite noise and other distractions. Most working breeds of dogs are able to be trained to find people with their sense of smell (as opposed to their sense of sight). [[Cocker Spaniel]]s are able to be trained as part of a [[termite]] detection team. Their relatively small size enables them to fit into small spaces, and their light weight allows them to walk on areas of ceiling which would be dangerous to anything heavier. In fact, although unusual, termite detection dogs are much more reliable at detecting termites than humans who rely on a basic system of tapping and listening. Because of their ability to learn signals by sight and for their energetic and athletic natures, [[German Shepherd]]s are able to be trained for work alongside search and rescue teams and human apprehension teams.<ref>McGreevy 2011, p. 116\u2013279.</ref>\n\n== Individualised or class training ==\nIndividualised training is used with dogs that have an urgent or unique training problem such as fear, hyperactivity, aggression (and other related problems), separation anxiety, biting, excessive barking, insecurity, destructive behaviors, walking difficulties, and inappropriate elimination.<ref>{{cite web|title=Management and Rehabilitation of Inter-Dog Aggression in Animal Shelters|url=http://www.landfood.ubc.ca/animalwelfare/publications/pdfs/theses/Orihel_MSc.pdf|author=Jane S.
