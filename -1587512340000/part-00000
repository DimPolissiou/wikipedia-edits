Taranagar was earlier known as '''Reni''', named for the lady Rinkali who came here to live from Vishalnagar Koyalapatan, currently Foga in Sardarshar (Rajasthan). Reni was the headquarters of the nizamat and the [[tehsil]] of the same name in the state of [[Bikaner]] in [[Rajputana]]. The nizamat consisted of five eastern tehsils of [[Bhadra, Rajasthan|Bhadra]], [[Churu (tehsil)|Churu]], [[Nohar]], [[Rajgarh, Churu|Rajgarh]] and Reni. In 1948, the town was renamed for King Tara Singh, who ruled it in the mid-18th century.\n\n== History ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}\nThe first king of Taranagar was Ranakpal. He lost the empire to Chayal Rajputs, who ruled it for more than 1000 years, then Rao Bikaji conquered it. Reni was part of [[Jangladesh]] and capital of the [[Jakhar (clan)|Jakhar]] [[gotra]] [[jat]], ruled prior to its annexation by the [[Rathore|Rathor]] rulers. The present name of the town is Taranagar. Taranagar is a very old village, famous for its temples, ancient [[haveli]]s, paintings inside them and [[chhatri]]s. Taranagar is surrounded by a number of small villages, inhabited mostly by farmers.\n\nTaranagar also has an old fort, locally known as Gadh, that is now is being used as the Tehsil headquarters and is surrounded by the market place. Taranagar is surrounded by a number of small villages, the residents of which trade in Taranagar. The house of the in-laws of Shivraj Kavia of [[Nimakidhani]] is located near Shri Karani mandir.\n\nGoga Medi in Degawas is also a famous temple built 50 years ago by Pujari Shree Bihari Lal Ji Sankholia, where a fair is held on the occasion of Goga Navmi.\n\n==Places of interest and importance==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}\nTaranagar is well known for its antiquity. It has a famous Jain temple built-in 942. It has very old statues of Jain [[Tirthankar]]s. The Chhatri of Anand Singhji and Tara Singhji, or saints' homes, are quite popular. These are 2&nbsp;km distant from the town.\n\nA temple, a little away from the town, is known as Shyam Pandia. It is said to be as old as Dwapar Yug. As the legend goes, it is believed that [[Bhima]] of [[The Mahabharata]] fame was sent here to call for the services or blessings of the then pujari of the temple, Saint Shyam Pandia, for the Tilak ceremony of [[Yudhishthira]] after the [[Battle of Kurukshetra]] was won by Pandavas.\n\nApart from private hospitals and practicing doctors, Taranagar has a referral hospital set up by late Onkar Mal Mintri and run by the state government where health care facilities are available for the general public and for the people from nearby villages. There is another hospital building that has been converted into a veterinary hospital catering to cattle.\n\nThough the town does not have a railway station, it is well connected by road. It is served by roadway organization of many states, private buses, and taxi operators. Gandhi Upwan, in the east of the town, close to the bus stand and police station, is a moderate garden maintained by the municipality. There is a rest-house used by visiting officials that is run by Rajasthan state PWD. The same locality houses the famous Govt. Higher Secondary School, Taranagar.\n\nA public library is almost in the middle of the Taranagar that also houses a free reading room, that over the decades has helped the growth of local intellect even if the facilities have been meager and maintenance falls short of needs; nonetheless, it has been providing a space for developing minds.\n\nSince last decade or so Taranagar has been emerging as a place counted in its vicinity of its surrounding villages &mdash; for providing facilities for children's education, selling their produce, shopping, trade, institutional interaction, etc. Besides the Main Bazar that is in the center of town, there are a number of shop-clusters or markets specializing in merchandise like footwear, vegetables and fruits, medicines etc. There are some trading firms, bank branches, organizations, government offices. Almost a dozen institutions impart graduate courses including an upcoming veterinary medical college providing the feel of a self-sufficient town. Taranagar boasts an industrial estate promoted by RIICO primarily for the manufacture of plaster of Paris.\n\n==Nearby cities and villages==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}\nSadulpur (also known as Rajgarh, its connecting railway station), a junction on the Northern Zone of Indian Railways is on east side at a distance of about 36&nbsp;km and Churu, the district city is on its south side at a distance of about 60&nbsp;km while Sardar Sahar is on its south-west side. Apart from these cities, the town is surrounded by a large number of villages (124 )on all sides that are populated by mostly by small to medium-sized land holders, farmers and artisans. The town of Taranagar is used by them as a Mandi for selling their agricultural product as also a center for education, health services and connectivity. The nearby villages include Dhani- kumharan, Satyu, Rajpura, Lunas, Gajuwas, Chalkoi, Kharatwas, Nethawa, Togawas, Bhaleri, Chalkoi, Bhanin, Kalwas, Dabri Chhoti, Dheerwas Bara, Sahwa, Bain, Buchawas, Dadrewa, Jigsana, Nyangli, Hadiyal, Dudhwa Khara, Bhamara etc. Brahmanwasi is an agricultural locality situated on the western side of the town. The main crops raised in the area are millets, bajra, guar, gram and lately even mustard. Historically, it was a zamindari that was initially vested in the Vyas family (Pushkarna Brahmins) by the late Raja Shri Joravar Singhji, the then ruler of a princely state of Bikaner. The current scion of the family Mool Raj holds the original handwritten document of transfer of Brahmanwasi. Vyas was further patronized by the vaishya community mainly Swetambar Jains, who held a prominent position in business and commerce. Goga Medi in Degawas Mohalla is also a famous temple built 50 years ago by  Pujari Shree Bihari Lal Ji Sankholia, where a fair is held on the occasion of Goga Navmi. More prominent of fairs held in the town include Ramdevji Ka Mela, where cattle are sold and the Gaur Magaria, a festival when a procession of Gaurajja is taken out with a lot of fanfare.\n\n\u0939\u092e \u0917\u093e\u0902\u0935\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u093e \u0907\u0924\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0938 \u0924\u0925\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0943\u0924 \u0935\u093f\u0935\u0930\u0923 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0938\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0935\u091c\u0928\u093f\u0915 \u092a\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0915\u093e\u0932\u092f \u0924\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0928\u0917\u0930 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u093f\u0924 \u0905\u0930\u094d\u091a\u0928\u093e \u092d\u093e\u0917 2 \u0938\u0947 \u092a\u0922\u093c \u0938\u0915\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u091c\u093f\u0938\u0947 \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0902\u0926 \u092a\u093e\u0930\u0940\u0915 \u0924\u0925\u093e \u0915\u093e\u0932\u0942\u0930\u093e\u092e \u092a\u0941\u0930\u094b\u0939\u093f\u0924 \u092c\u0941\u091a\u093e\u0935\u093e\u0938 \u0928\u0947 \u0938\u0902\u092a\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0924 \u090f\u0935\u0902 \u0938\u0902\u0915\u0932\u093f\u0924 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964\n\n==Geography==\nTaranagar is located at {{Coord|28.68|N|75.03|E|}}.<ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/24/Taranagar.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc \u2013 Taranagar]</ref> It has an average elevation of 232 meters (761 feet).

Taranagar was earlier known as '''Reni''', named for the lady Rinkali who came here to live from Vishalnagar Koyalapatan, currently Foga in Sardarshar (Rajasthan). Reni was the headquarters of the nizamat and the [[tehsil]] of the same name in the state of [[Bikaner]] in [[Rajputana]]. The nizamat consisted of five eastern tehsils of [[Bhadra, Rajasthan|Bhadra]], [[Churu]], [[Nohar]], [[Rajgarh, Churu|Rajgarh]] and Reni. In 1948, the town was renamed for King Tara Singh, who ruled it in the mid-18th century.\n\n== History ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}\nThe first king of Taranagar was Ranakpal. He lost the empire to Chayal Rajputs, who ruled it for more than 1000 years, then Rao Bikaji conquered it. Reni was part of [[Jangladesh]] and capital of the [[Jakhar (clan)|Jakhar]] [[gotra]] [[jat]], ruled prior to its annexation by the [[Rathore|Rathor]] rulers. The present name of the town is Taranagar. Taranagar is a very old village, famous for its temples, ancient [[haveli]]s, paintings inside them and [[chhatri]]s. Taranagar is surrounded by a number of small villages, inhabited mostly by farmers.\n\nTaranagar also has an old fort, locally known as Gadh, that is now is being used as the Tehsil headquarters and is surrounded by the market place.

It has a famous Jain temple built-in 942. It has very old statues of Jain [[Tirthankar]]s. The Chhatri of Anand Singhji and Tara Singhji, or saints' homes, are quite popular. These are 2&nbsp;km distant from the town.\n\nA temple, a little away from the town, is known as Shyam Pandia. It is said to be as old as Dwapar Yug. As the legend goes, it is believed that [[Bhima]] of [[The Mahabharata]] fame was sent here to call for the services or blessings of the then pujari of the temple, Saint Shyam Pandia, for the Tilak ceremony of [[Yudhishthira]] after the [[Battle of Kurukshetra]] was won by Pandavas.\n\nApart from private hospitals and practicing doctors, Taranagar has a referral hospital set up by late Onkar Mal Mintri and run by the state government where health care facilities are available for the general public and for the people from nearby villages. There is another hospital building that has been converted into a veterinary hospital catering to cattle.\n\nThough the town does not have a railway station, it is well connected by road. It is served by roadway organization of many states, private buses, and taxi operators. Gandhi Upwan, in the east of the town, close to the bus stand and police station, is a moderate garden maintained by the municipality. There is a rest-house used by visiting officials that is run by Rajasthan state PWD. The same locality houses the famous Govt. Higher Secondary School, Taranagar.\n\nA public library is almost in the middle of the Taranagar that also houses a free reading room, that over the decades has helped the growth of local intellect even if the facilities have been meager and maintenance falls short of needs; nonetheless, it has been providing a space for developing minds.\n\nSince last decade or so Taranagar has been emerging as a place counted in its vicinity of its surrounding villages &mdash; for providing facilities for children's education, selling their produce, shopping, trade, institutional interaction, etc. Besides the Main Bazar that is in the center of town, there are a number of shop-clusters or markets specializing in merchandise like footwear, vegetables and fruits, medicines etc. There are some trading firms, bank branches, organizations, government offices.
