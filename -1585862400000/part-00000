Her script for the film ''[[Hiroshima mon amour]]'' (1959) earned her a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] at the [[Academy Awards]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nDuras was born Marguerite Donnadieu on April 4, 1914, in Gia-Dinh<ref name=bnf>{{cite web|url=https://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb119013498.public|title=Bnf: Notice de personne: Duras, Marguerite ((1914-1996)|language=French|accessdate=18 September 2018}}</ref> (near to [[Saigon]]), [[French Cochinchina|Cochinchina]], [[French Indochina]] (now [[Vietnam]]); she was the only daughter of two teachers who had responded to a campaign by the French government encouraging French people to settle in the colony.<ref name=\"NYTObit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/04/nyregion/marguerite-duras-81-author-who-explored-love-and-sex.html|title=Marguerite Duras, 81, Author Who Explored Love and Sex|last1=Riding|first1=Alan|accessdate=14 April 2017|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nDuras's father fell ill soon after their arrival and returned to France, where he died. After his death, her mother remained in [[French Indochina|Indochina]] with her three children. The family lived in relative poverty after her mother made a bad investment in an isolated property and area of rice farmland in [[Cambodia]].<ref name=\"NYTObit\" /> See, e.g. ''[[The Sea Wall (novel)|Un Barrage contre le Pacifique]]''.\n\nAt 17, Duras went to France, her parents' native country, where she began studying for a degree in mathematics. She soon abandoned this to concentrate on [[political science]], then law.<ref name=\"NYTObit\" /> After completing her studies, through 1941, she worked for the French government in the Ministry of the Colonies;<ref name=\"NYTObit\" /> in the 1930s she also changed her name to Marguerite Duras. In 1939, she married the writer [[Robert Antelme]].<ref name=\"NYTObit\" />\n\nDuring World War II, from 1942 to 1944, Duras worked for the [[Vichy government]] in an office that allocated paper quotas to publishers and in the process operated a ''de facto'' book-censorship system. She also became an active member of the [[French Communist Party|PCF]] (the [[French Communist Party]])<ref name=\"NYTObit\" />  and a member of the [[French Resistance]] as a part of a small group that also included [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], who later became President of France and remained a lifelong friend of Duras.<ref name=\"NYTObit\" /> Her husband, [[Robert Antelme|Antelme]], was deported to [[Buchenwald]] in 1944<ref name=deport>{{cite web|language=French\n|url=http://www.bddm.org/liv/details.php?id=I.265.#ANTELME|title=Transport parti de Compi\u00e8gne le 17 ao\u00fbt 1944 (I.265.)|accessdate=31 July 2018}}</ref> for his involvement in the Resistance, and barely survived the experience (weighing on his release, according to Duras, just 38&nbsp;kg). She nursed him back to health, but they divorced once he recovered his health.\n\n==Career==\nDuras was the author of many novels, plays, films, interviews, essays, and works of short fiction, including her best-selling, highly fictionalized autobiographical work ''[[The Lover (1984 novel)|L'Amant]]'' (1984), translated into English as ''The Lover'', which describes her youthful affair with a Chinese man. It won the [[Prix Goncourt]] in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academie-goncourt.fr/?article=1229180042|title=Le Palmar\u00e8s|website=Acad\u00e9mie Goncourt}}</ref> The story of her adolescence also appears in three other books: ''The Sea Wall'', ''Eden Cinema'' and ''The North China Lover''. A [[The Lover (1992 film)|film version]] of ''The Lover'', produced by [[Claude Berri]] and directed by [[Jean-Jacques Annaud]], was released to great success in 1992. Duras's novel ''[[The Sea Wall (novel)|The Sea Wall]]'' was first adapted into the 1958 film ''[[This Angry Age]]'' by [[Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment]], and again in 2008 by Cambodian director [[Rithy Panh]] as ''[[The Sea Wall]]''.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}\n\nOther major works include ''[[Moderato Cantabile]]'' (1958), which was the basis of the 1960 film ''[[Seven Days... Seven Nights]]''; ''[[Le Ravissement de Lol V. Stein]]'' (1964); and her play ''India Song'', which Duras herself later directed as [[India Song|a film in 1975]]. She was also the screenwriter of the 1959 French film ''[[Hiroshima mon amour]]'', which was directed by [[Alain Resnais]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/217-hiroshima-mon-amour|title=The Criterion Collection \u2013 Hiroshima Mon Amour|website=The Criterion Collection}}</ref> Duras's early novels were fairly conventional in form, and were criticized for their \"romanticism\" by fellow writer [[Raymond Queneau]]; however, with ''Moderato Cantabile'', she became more experimental, paring down her texts to give ever-increasing importance to what was not said. She was associated with the ''[[nouveau roman]]'' French [[literary movement]], although she did not belong definitively to any one group. She was noted for her command of dialogue.<ref name=\"brit\">{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Marguerite Duras|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/174178/Marguerite-Duras|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online.

Her script for the film ''[[Hiroshima mon amour]]'' (1959) earned her a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] at the [[Academy Awards]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nDuras was born Marguerite Donnadieu on April 4, 1914, in Gia-Dinh<ref name=bnf>{{cite web|url=https://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb119013498.public|title=Bnf: Notice de personne: Duras, Marguerite ((1914-1996)|language=French|accessdate=18 September 2018}}</ref> (near to [[Saigon]]), [[French Cochinchina|Cochinchina]], [[French Indochina]] (now [[Vietnam]]); she was the only daughter of two teachers who had responded to a campaign by the French government encouraging French people to settle in the colony.<ref name=\"NYTObit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/04/nyregion/marguerite-duras-81-author-who-explored-love-and-sex.html|title=Marguerite Duras, 81, Author Who Explored Love and Sex|last1=Riding|first1=Alan|accessdate=14 April 2017|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nDuras's father fell ill soon after their arrival and returned to France, where he died. After his death, her mother remained in [[French Indochina|Indochina]] with her three children. The family lived in relative poverty after her mother made a bad investment in an isolated property and area of rice farmland in [[Cambodia]].<ref name=\"NYTObit\" /> See, e.g. ''[[The Sea Wall (novel)|Un Barrage contre le Pacifique]]''. \n\nAt 17, Duras went to France, her parents' native country, where she began studying for a degree in mathematics. She soon abandoned this to concentrate on [[political science]], then law.<ref name=\"NYTObit\" /> After completing her studies, through 1941, she worked for the French government in the Ministry of the Colonies;<ref name=\"NYTObit\" /> in the 1930s she also changed her name to Marguerite Duras. In 1939, she married the writer [[Robert Antelme]].<ref name=\"NYTObit\" />\n\nDuring World War II, from 1942 to 1944, Duras worked for the [[Vichy government]] in an office that allocated paper quotas to publishers and in the process operated a ''de facto'' book-censorship system. She also became an active member of the [[French Communist Party|PCF]] (the [[French Communist Party]])<ref name=\"NYTObit\" />  and a member of the [[French Resistance]] as a part of a small group that also included [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], who later became President of France and remained a lifelong friend of Duras.<ref name=\"NYTObit\" /> Her husband, [[Robert Antelme|Antelme]], was deported to [[Buchenwald]] in 1944<ref name=deport>{{cite web|language=French\n|url=http://www.bddm.org/liv/details.php?id=I.265.#ANTELME|title=Transport parti de Compi\u00e8gne le 17 ao\u00fbt 1944 (I.265.)|accessdate=31 July 2018}}</ref> for his involvement in the Resistance, and barely survived the experience (weighing on his release, according to Duras, just 38&nbsp;kg). She nursed him back to health, but they divorced once he recovered his health.\n\n==Career==\nDuras was the author of many novels, plays, films, interviews, essays, and works of short fiction, including her best-selling, highly fictionalized autobiographical work ''[[The Lover (1984 novel)|L'Amant]]'' (1984), translated into English as ''The Lover'', which describes her youthful affair with a Chinese man. It won the [[Prix Goncourt]] in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academie-goncourt.fr/?article=1229180042|title=Le Palmar\u00e8s|website=Acad\u00e9mie Goncourt}}</ref> The story of her adolescence also appears in three other books: ''The Sea Wall'', ''Eden Cinema'' and ''The North China Lover''. A [[The Lover (1992 film)|film version]] of ''The Lover'', produced by [[Claude Berri]] and directed by [[Jean-Jacques Annaud]], was released to great success in 1992. Duras's novel ''[[The Sea Wall (novel)|The Sea Wall]]'' was first adapted into the 1958 film ''[[This Angry Age]]'' by [[Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment]], and again in 2008 by Cambodian director [[Rithy Panh]] as ''[[The Sea Wall]]''.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}\n\nOther major works include ''[[Moderato Cantabile]]'' (1958), which was the basis of the 1960 film ''[[Seven Days... Seven Nights]]''; ''[[Le Ravissement de Lol V. Stein]]'' (1964); and her play ''India Song'', which Duras herself later directed as [[India Song|a film in 1975]]. She was also the screenwriter of the 1959 French film ''[[Hiroshima mon amour]]'', which was directed by [[Alain Resnais]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/217-hiroshima-mon-amour|title=The Criterion Collection \u2013 Hiroshima Mon Amour|website=The Criterion Collection}}</ref> Duras's early novels were fairly conventional in form, and were criticized for their \"romanticism\" by fellow writer [[Raymond Queneau]]; however, with ''Moderato Cantabile'', she became more experimental, paring down her texts to give ever-increasing importance to what was not said. She was associated with the ''[[nouveau roman]]'' French [[literary movement]], although she did not belong definitively to any one group. She was noted for her command of dialogue.<ref name=\"brit\">{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Marguerite Duras|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/174178/Marguerite-Duras|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online.

The game is set in Ireland and the [[Celtic Otherworld]] of [[Irish mythology]], centering on a young woman named Ellen, and a journalist named Keats, both playable characters who together unravel the mystery that the quaint village of [[Doolin]] hides, the mystery that can only be solved by seeking the memories of the dead in the dangerous, Folk-ridden Netherworld.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Folklore Screen.jpg|left|thumb|Ellen utilizing \"folk\" in combat]]\n\nFolklore is an [[action role-playing game]], where players control characters in a [[Virtual camera system|third-person]] view to both explore their surroundings and engage in combat. From the start, players have a choice to play the game as either of the two lead protagonists, the young woman Ellen or the journalist Keats, both having different yet intertwining plots and play styles. The game is split into two worlds, the real world set in the small sea-side Irish village of [[Doolin]] and the more fantastical Netherworld inhabited by folk creatures and spirits.\n\nIn Doolin, players lead their chosen character throughout the village and surrounding area. When in this state, characters are unable to engage in combat or utilize their abilities and instead will be limited to exploring the village's locations and interacting with its inhabitants, containing multiple search and slight puzzle-esque quests that progress the main story and eventually lead them to and from the Netherworld, acting as a hub between worlds and subsequent quests.\n\nWhen characters pass into the Netherworld, the gameplay shifts entirely towards the action-adventure side of its genre. Basic attack techniques are performed by utilizing \"folk\", various creatures and spirits that upon defeat can be absorbed for the player's use. When a folk is nearly defeated, its spirit will glow red, allowing players to absorb it by locking onto it and performing shaking and yanking motions with the [[Sixaxis]] motion control (rather than a conventional button interface) to reel in its energy for use. While the player can choose from nearly all folk encountered and absorbed, only four at a time can be mapped to the controller's main four interface/action buttons and used in quick succession for combat with different kinds of folk being better suited for certain situations and techniques such as close-combat, projectile attacks or magic. The two playable characters themselves also differ between play styles. While Ellen uses a variety of folk as basic strategy and favors a defensive stance with the ability to cloak herself with folk powers, Keats uses more straight up brute force attacks with usually all-round stronger folk along with the ability to release built-up energy to become invincible and perform stronger attacks for a period of time.\n\n==Plot==\nThe game takes place in the present day. A young university student by the name of Ellen ([[Lisa Hogg]]) is lured to the sea-side village of Doolin, in Ireland, led by a letter from her supposedly dead mother, telling her to meet her at the Cliff of Sidhe, Doolin. Meanwhile, Keats ([[Richard Coyle]]), a journalist from an occult magazine called ''Unknown Realms'', receives a telephone call from a woman in distress telling him to come to Doolin, and crying about Faerys who would kill her. Though he suspects it is a prank call, he pays a visit to Doolin Village.\n\nWhen Ellen arrives at the Cliff of Sidhe, she sees a cloaked figure resting at the edge. Thinking it is her mother, she calls out to the figure, but it does not reply. Keats arrives on the scene then, and asks Ellen if she was the one who called him. When she, surprised, says no, he wonders aloud if the figure at the cliff was the one who called him.\n\nA strong gust of wind suddenly blows across the cliff, and when it dies down, the figure has disappeared. Ellen, distraught, runs down to the beach to find the body and bumps into a girl from the village named Suzette. She questions Ellen, but she is so distressed that she faints. Keats arrives and, after questioning Suzette about Ellen, decides that the best thing would be to bring Ellen back into the village.\n\nSuzette brings Ellen to a small hut and Keats to a base on the edge of the village. That night, they are both visited by strange voices who invite them to the village pub, where they meet creatures they had never before thought existed, and are taken to a place that surpasses all imagination: the Netherworld, realm of the dead. Soon Keats and Ellen find themselves in a 17-year-old murder mystery, where the answers seem to only be found in the Netherworld, the land that can only be accessed from one place in the world, Doolin. To solve the crime and reveal Ellen's forgotten past, they will need to venture to the Netherworld as travelers, where Faerys and Folks alike await them.\n\nAlong the way they meet a variety of different characters, like Scarecrow and Belgae, who help out both of them in their quest. Throughout the game, players learn about the chaos the Netherworld was put into by a previous Netherworld traveller. The eventual goal is to reach the core of the Netherworld and \"fix\" it. The game takes two different perspectives in the story that shows the different views and opinions of many different characters. While traveling in the Netherworld, many mysterious murders start to occur in the village of Doolin after the appearance of \"The Hag.\" The people murdered are the only ones who knew the truth (or part of the truth) of Ellen's past.\n\n==Development==\n''Folklore'' was announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2006 which was said to be \"The next generation of dark fantasy.\" It was to be developed by [[Game Republic]], under [[Yoshiki Okamoto]], a video game designer who worked on popular games, including ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]''. The game was originally titled ''Monster Kingdom: Unknown Realms'', and was intended as a companion piece to [[Gaia (game company)|Gaia]]'s ''[[Monster Kingdom: Jewel Summoner]]''. However, disappointing sales of ''Jewel Summoner'' led to the game being retitled ''Folklore''. Gaia however would assist the development of Folklore, contributing monster designs. Numerous creatures appearing in ''Folklore'' would later appear in Gaia's [[PlayStation Portable]] game ''[[Coded Soul: Uketsugareshi Idea]]'' the following year, which also featured connectivity with ''Folklore''.\n\nA playable demo was first released on the Japanese [[PlayStation Network]] (PSN) on May 30, 2007. The demo features the two playable characters Keats and Ellen, with the ability to choose from either of them. The demo includes a series of short comic-style cutscenes, exploration of a sea-side village and a trek through a series of playable areas where a player is introduced to the gameplay basics (i.e. fighting, how to acquire new Ids, etc.). This demo was all in Japanese aside from the lines in English that both protagonists would occasionally exclaim during combat.\n\nAn English-speech demonstration was released on the European PSN on August 22, 2007; as a limited time offering, it was removed from the [[PlayStation Store]] on August 31. This demo was released to the North American PSN on August 23, 2007. An English/Traditional Chinese speech version demo was released on the Asian PSN on September 4, 2007. The original Japanese demo was released in English on European and US PlayStation Network Stores.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = FolksSoul: The Lost Folklore\n| type       = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist     = [[Kenji Kawai]], [[Shinji Hosoe]], Ayako Saso and Hiroto Saitoh, arranged by [[Kenji Kawai]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{start date|2007|06|27}} (Japan)\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Video game music|Video game soundtrack]]\n| length     = 172:40 (three CDs)\n| label      = Team Entertainment\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe official ''Folklore'' soundtrack was released on 3 discs on June 27, 2007 by TEAM Entertainment.

Ryan Clements of [[IGN]] was particularly impressed with the game's style over the actual technical graphics engine, noting that \"''Folklore'''s sheer visual beauty comes more from the stellar art direction and execution of the artistic design than the amount of processing power it requires,\u201d helped further by the soundtrack described as \"poignant and intrinsically atmospheric.\"<ref name=\"IGN review\"/> This view was further echoed by Gaming Target, summing up with \"technically the game looks great, with the realistic style of Doolin, mixed in with the colorful and absurdly Japanese stylings of the Netherworld levels,\" later including ''Folklore'' in their \"52 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2007.\" <ref>{{cite web |author=GT staff |date=December 31, 2007 |url=http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=8069 |title=52 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2007 |publisher=Gaming Target |accessdate=June 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe battle system where players would catch and utilize various \"folk\" was considered another positive aspect. [[GameSpy]] found that \"what makes the enormous library of monsters and moves work so well is that each is most useful in a particular situation\"<ref name=\"GameSpy review\"/> and while [[GameTrailers]] also praised the feature finding that \"switching folk in and out of your arsenal is easy thanks to well-organized menus,\" it also criticized brief loading times between shifting in and out of the menus that \"puts a damper on the game\u2019s flow.\"<ref name=\"GameTrailers review\"/> [[Eurogamer]] on the other hand felt that the basic level design was \"pretty standard dungeon crawling,\" if not \"bland\" at times. The use of the SIXAXIS motion control to reel in energy from downed folk was considered a better use of the feature compared to past games, with [[1UP.com]] calling it \"the most subtle and sensible use of the PS3's motion control yet.\"<ref name=\"Eurogamer review\"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Barnholt |first=Ray |date=October 9, 2007 |url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/folklore |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604003110/http://www.1up.com/reviews/folklore |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 4, 2011 |title=Folklore |website=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=October 23, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nWhile the narrative was considered a strong point, with GameZone calling it \"compelling,\" the method of telling much of the story in graphic-novel style still cutscenes however received a less than positive response.<ref name=\"GameZone review\"/> Kevin VanOrd of [[GameSpot]] felt that while \"an interesting design choice\" is, in the end \"weirdly flavorless.\"<ref name=\"Gamespot review\"/> Another issue found in this method was the lack of voice-work outside of the full CGI cutscenes with [[GamesRadar]] (in-house) finding it to hinder the delivery of the overall story.<ref>[http://www.gamesradar.com/us/ps3/game/reviews/article.jsp?articleId=2007092517183422088&sectionId=1000&pageId=20070925171854786003]{{Dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Cancelled sequel===\nThe now-defunct Game Republic was planning a [[PlayStation Portable]] or download only Move compatible ''Folklore'' sequel and had pitched the idea to Sony.

While the player can choose from nearly all folk encountered and absorbed, only four at a time can be mapped to the controller\u2019s main four interface/action buttons and used in quick succession for combat with different kinds of folk being better suited for certain situations and techniques such as close-combat, projectile attacks or magic. The two playable characters themselves also differ between play styles. While Ellen uses a variety of folk as basic strategy and favors a defensive stance with the ability to cloak herself with folk powers, Keats uses more straight up brute force attacks with usually all-round stronger folk along with the ability to release built-up energy to become invincible and perform stronger attacks for a period of time.\n\n==Plot==\nThe game takes place in the present day. A young university student by the name of Ellen ([[Lisa Hogg]]) is lured to the sea-side village of Doolin, in Ireland, led by a letter from her supposedly dead mother, telling her to meet her at the Cliff of Sidhe, Doolin. Meanwhile Keats ([[Richard Coyle]]), a journalist from an occult magazine called ''Unknown Realms'', receives a telephone call from a woman in distress telling him to come to Doolin, and crying about Faerys who would kill her. Though he suspects it is a prank call, he pays a visit to Doolin Village.\n\nWhen Ellen arrives at the Cliff of Sidhe, she sees a cloaked figure resting at the edge. Thinking it is her mother, she calls out to the figure, but it does not reply. Keats arrives on the scene then, and asks Ellen if she was the one who called him. When she, surprised, says no, he wonders aloud if the figure at the cliff was the one who called him.\n\nA strong gust of wind suddenly blows across the cliff, and when it dies down, the figure has disappeared. Ellen, distraught, runs down to the beach to find the body and bumps into a girl from the village named Suzette. She questions Ellen, but she is so distressed that she faints. Keats arrives and, after questioning Suzette about Ellen, decides that the best thing would be to bring Ellen back into the village.\n\nSuzette brings Ellen to a small hut and Keats to a base on the edge of the village. That night, they are both visited by strange voices who invite them to the village pub, where they meet creatures they had never before thought existed, and are taken to a place that surpasses all imagination: the Netherworld, realm of the dead. Soon Keats and Ellen find themselves in a 17-year-old murder mystery, where the answers seem to only be found in the Netherworld, the land that can only be accessed from one place in the world, Doolin. To solve the crime and reveal Ellen's forgotten past, they will need to venture to the Netherworld as travelers, where Faerys and Folks alike await them.\n\nAlong the way they meet a variety of different characters, like Scarecrow and Belgae, who help out both of them in their quest. Throughout the game, players learn about the chaos the Netherworld was put into by a previous Netherworld traveller. The eventual goal is to reach the core of the Netherworld and \"fix\" it. The game takes two different perspectives in the story that shows the different views and opinions of many different characters. While traveling in the Netherworld, many mysterious murders start to occur in the village of Doolin after the appearance of \"The Hag.\" The people murdered are the only ones who knew the truth (or part of the truth) of Ellen's past.\n\n==Development==\n''Folklore'' was announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2006 which was said to be \"The next generation of dark fantasy.\" It was to be developed by [[Game Republic]], under [[Yoshiki Okamoto]], a video game designer who worked on popular games, including ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]''. The game was originally titled ''Monster Kingdom: Unknown Realms'', and was intended as a companion piece to [[Gaia (game company)|Gaia]]'s ''[[Monster Kingdom: Jewel Summoner]]''. However, disappointing sales of ''Jewel Summoner'' led to the game being retitled ''Folklore''. Gaia however would assist the development of Folklore, contributing monster designs. Numerous creatures appearing in ''Folklore'' would later appear in Gaia's [[PlayStation Portable]] game ''[[Coded Soul: Uketsugareshi Idea]]'' the following year, which also featured connectivity with ''Folklore''.\n\nA playable demo was first released on the Japanese [[PlayStation Network]] (PSN) on May 30, 2007. The demo features the two playable characters Keats and Ellen, with the ability to choose from either of them. The demo includes a series of short comic-style cutscenes, exploration of a sea-side village and a trek through a series of playable areas where a player is introduced to the gameplay basics (i.e. fighting, how to acquire new Ids, etc.). This demo was all in Japanese aside from the lines in English that both protagonists would occasionally exclaim during combat.\n\nAn English-speech demonstration was released on the European PSN on August 22, 2007; as a limited time offering, it was removed from the [[PlayStation Store]] on August 31. This demo was released to the North American PSN on August 23, 2007. An English/Traditional Chinese speech version demo was released on the Asian PSN on September 4, 2007. The original Japanese demo was released in English on European and US PlayStation Network Stores.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = FolksSoul: The Lost Folklore\n| type       = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist     = [[Kenji Kawai]], [[Shinji Hosoe]], Ayako Saso and Hiroto Saitoh, arranged by [[Kenji Kawai]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{start date|2007|06|27}} (Japan)\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Video game music|Video game soundtrack]]\n| length     = 172:40 (three CDs)\n| label      = Team Entertainment\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe official ''Folklore'' soundtrack was released on 3 discs on June 27, 2007 by TEAM Entertainment.

Ryan Clements of [[IGN]] was particularly impressed with the game\u2019s style over the actual technical graphics engine, noting that \"''Folklore'''s sheer visual beauty comes more from the stellar art direction and execution of the artistic design than the amount of processing power it requires,\u201d helped further by the soundtrack described as \"poignant and intrinsically atmospheric.\"<ref name=\"IGN review\"/> This view was further echoed by Gaming Target, summing up with \"technically the game looks great, with the realistic style of Doolin, mixed in with the colorful and absurdly Japanese stylings of the Netherworld levels,\" later including ''Folklore'' in their \"52 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2007.\" <ref>{{cite web |author=GT staff |date=December 31, 2007 |url=http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=8069 |title=52 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2007 |publisher=Gaming Target |accessdate=June 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe battle system where players would catch and utilize various \"folk\" was considered another positive aspect. [[GameSpy]] found that \"what makes the enormous library of monsters and moves work so well is that each is most useful in a particular situation\"<ref name=\"GameSpy review\"/> and while [[GameTrailers]] also praised the feature finding that \"switching folk in and out of your arsenal is easy thanks to well-organized menus,\" it also criticized brief loading times between shifting in and out of the menus that \"puts a damper on the game\u2019s flow.\"<ref name=\"GameTrailers review\"/> [[Eurogamer]] on the other hand felt that the basic level design was \"pretty standard dungeon crawling,\" if not \"bland\" at times. The use of the SIXAXIS motion control to reel in energy from downed folk was considered a better use of the feature compared to past games, with [[1UP.com]] calling it \"the most subtle and sensible use of the PS3's motion control yet.\"<ref name=\"Eurogamer review\"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Barnholt |first=Ray |date=October 9, 2007 |url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/folklore |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604003110/http://www.1up.com/reviews/folklore |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 4, 2011 |title=Folklore |website=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=October 23, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nWhile the narrative was considered a strong point, with GameZone calling it \"compelling,\" the method of telling much of the story in graphic-novel style still cutscenes however received a less than positive response.<ref name=\"GameZone review\"/> Kevin VanOrd of [[GameSpot]] felt that while \"an interesting design choice\" is, in the end \"weirdly flavorless.\"<ref name=\"Gamespot review\"/> Another issue found in this method was the lack of voice-work outside of the full CGI cutscenes with [[GamesRadar]] (in-house) finding it to hinder the delivery of the overall story.<ref>[http://www.gamesradar.com/us/ps3/game/reviews/article.jsp?articleId=2007092517183422088&sectionId=1000&pageId=20070925171854786003]{{Dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Cancelled sequel===\nThe now-defunct Game Republic was planning a [[PlayStation Portable]] or download only Move compatible ''Folklore'' sequel and had pitched the idea to Sony.

Set in 1890, it stars Gyro Zeppeli, a disgraced former executioner, and Johnny Joestar, a former star jockey who was shot and lost the use of his legs, as well as his fame and fortune. They, along with others, compete in the titular cross-continental race for $50 million, but the race has a hidden agenda behind it.\n\nOriginally the first 23 chapters (4 volumes) were serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' in 2004 simply under the title ''Steel Ball Run''. Although the character's names are obviously related to the series, it was unclear if the story was a part of ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure''. However, when the series moved to ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005, it was officially announced as part 7 of ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'', but in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]], like the following and current arc, ''[[JoJolion]]''.\n\nThe 95 chapters were combined into 24 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes (volumes 81\u2013104 of the entire series), following the trend set by the previous part, ''[[Stone Ocean]]'', of starting over the volume count. A couple of chapters were adapted into a \"Vomic\" series, which has voice actors act over the manga pages as they are shown on screen.\n\n==Plot==\nThe series is set in 1890 in an alternate reality from previous ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' parts, where racing jockeys from all over the world flock to the United States to take part in the Steel Ball Run \u2014 a cross-country horse race from San Diego to New York City with a prize of fifty million dollars. Johnny Joestar, a former jockey who fell from glory after a shooting paralyzed him from the waist down, enters the race after meeting the mysterious Gyro Zeppeli to learn the secrets of the man's Spin technique which temporarily restored his mobility. While beginning as rivals, Johnny and Gyro become friends as they travel through the wilderness while fending off violent competitors.\n\nAs Gyro begins teaching Johnny the secrets of the Spin, his own background is explored through flashbacks. He is a former executioner from [[Naples]] who is competing in the Steel Ball Run not for his own gain, but to win the favor of the Neapolitan royalty and thus prevent the unjust execution of a young boy, Marco, who has been falsely accused of treason. The two continue their progression through the race, all the while being attacked by various assassins, terrorists, and outlaws.\n\nAlthough the Steel Ball Run is organized by the eccentric oil tycoon Stephen Steel, it is revealed that the race is backed by the United States government. Steel is unaware of the actual agenda of US President Funny Valentine: the race is a means for Valentine to collect the scattered pieces of a two-thousand-year-old corpse known as the Saint's Corpse (implied to be the body of [[Jesus Christ]], brought to America by [[Joseph of Arimathea]]) so he can use the reassembled body to achieve incredible power. Stephen's wife Lucy discovers this plot and finds out that Valentine already possesses one part of the Corpse, the heart.\n\nAfter Johnny and Gyro encounter another piece of the Saint's Corpse, it is absorbed into Johnny's body and he develops the Stand Tusk, allowing him to fend off one of Valentine's minions. Later, they meet the mysterious racer Diego Brando (a counterpart to the character Dio Brando, a major antagonist in previous installments of the series), who obtains one of two Corpse eyes, while Gyro gains the other.\n\nLucy intercepts a message to Valentine about the Corpse parts, making her a target for his men. She is able to escape him and with Johnny and Gyro's help she finds one of the parts. With the information provided by Lucy, Johnny and Gyro decide to search for the next three Corpse parts while sending Lucy, with the advantage of Gyro's Corpse eye, to take the Heart from Valentine himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Diego makes a deal with Valentine to help him deal with the traitor (who Valentine does not know is Lucy). Partnered with another racer, Diego attacks Johnny and Gyro. Gyro teaches Johnny how to use the [[Golden Ratio]] found in nature to amplify the power of the Spin, which evolves his Stand and allows him to defeat the other racer with this technique, but Diego escapes and all but one of the Corpse parts are stolen by another racer, Hot Pants.\n\nJohnny and Gyro are next forced to deal with a Stand based on the fable of [[The Honest Woodman]] by [[Aesop]], which grants them a considerable fortune alongside another Corpse part but forces them to get rid of both before sunrise or else they will be trapped within an ancient tree forever and become the new users of the Stand, making the same deal with passersby. The duo spend the money hiring a mercenary force to fend off Valentine's henchmen, but Gyro is nearly lost forever until Johnny trades away the Corpse parts to the last survivor of Valentine's forces, saving Gyro's life but leaving them with nothing.\n\nLucy uses Hot Pants' Stand to disguise herself as Valentine's wife Scarlet, while Hot Pants steals several Corpse parts from Valentine, including the Heart.\n\nJohnny and Gyro are led to a garbage dump by Hot Pants, only for all three to be nearly defeated by one of Valentine's men, who takes all of the parts they have collected. With the help of a vision of the Saint, Johnny's Stand develops new powers in combination with the Spin. Before he can win the battle, however, Valentine arrives and kills his own minion, then leaves along with all the Corpse parts except for the undiscovered head and the eyes possessed by Diego and Lucy. Upon returning to the [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]], Valentine uncovers Lucy's disguise and takes her captive after she fuses with the Corpse and seemingly becomes pregnant with the Corpse's head.\n\nLucy escapes from captivity, only to be lured into Valentine's clutches once again. Diego and Hot Pants ally against Valentine, chasing him and Lucy to a trainyard while being followed themselves by Johnny and Gyro. Diego and Hot Pants fight Valentine on the moving train but his Stand \u201cD4C\u201d (Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap) allows for multiple universes to exist simultaneously. Valentine's stand ability proves to be far too dangerous as Diego is lured to his death after Valentine pulls him under the moving train, bisecting him. Hot Pants is killed when space time distortions cause multiple solid objects to converge with her heart, instantly killing her. Lucy begins to metamorphose into a being resembling the Saint's Corpse. This grants Valentine even further powers in the form of an ability for D4C called Love Train, a dimensional wall of light that redirects all harm away from Valentine and randomly redistributes it as misfortune across the world. \n\nJohnny and Gyro arrive and attempt to battle the seemingly invulnerable Valentine. Johnny is momentarily incapacitated as Gyro and Valentine take their fight towards the Atlantic Ocean, with Gyro unlocking his stand \u201cBall Breaker\u201d utilizing the Golden Spin and the Steel Balls.  Gyro is able to pass Johnny a cryptic hint regarding The Golden Spin, a form of spin utilizing gravity. Although Ball Breaker is able to pass through Love Train and greatly damage Valentine, he unexpectedly survives Ball Breakers second attack however, and kills Gyro after multiple wounds travel towards his heart. At the last possible second, Johnny understands Gyros hint and is able to achieve the Golden Spin with Tusk, unlocking ACT 4, which allows Johnny to mark objects or beings with infinite rotation. Valentine is horrified as Tusk ACT 4's attack is able to breach his dimensional wall and mark D4C with infinite rotation. Pursued by infinite rotation regardless of which dimension he travels to, Valentine is forced to surrender and attempts to make a deal with Johnny, offering to resurrect Gyro by finding a version of him in another universe in exchange for the Corpse. Johnny nearly agrees but realizes that this is a trick after he notices Valentine holding a gun taken from another universe, which he intended to kill Johnny with if he let his guard down. Johnny kills Valentine in a fierce standoff, but realizes somebody else has taken the Corpse, now separate from Lucy.\n\nPursuing this unknown enemy into the final stage of the Steel Ball Run, Johnny is shocked to find that it is an alternate version Diego Brando, taken from a different universe by Valentine and entrusted with the Corpse. Unlike the previous Diego, this one possesses the time-stopping Stand of Dio Brando, THE WORLD. A flashback reveals that Valentine has educated the alternate Diego on the dangers of Tusk ACT 4 and a battle on the streets of New York begins. The new Diego is able to stop time for Johnny utilizing THE WORLD, however, Tusk ACT 4 is shown to be able to slightly mitigate the time stop by the use of gravity. Diego eventually outsmarts Johnny by weaponizing Tusk ACT 4's own Golden Spin against it. THE WORLD is attacked by ACT 4, but Diego uses his stand to sever his leg which was attacked by the infinite rotation and redirects it at Johnny. Overwhelmed by his own stand ability, Johnny begins to die. Diego then goes on to win the race in first place. He brings the Corpse to Trinity Church, where Valentine intended to lock it in a vault so that its powers would protect America forever. At the last moment, Lucy arrives with the severed head of the previous Diego. Terrified, Diego stops time with THE WORLD, but is unable to crawl up the stairs with his missing leg and accidentally comes into contact with the root world Diegos head. Since parallel instances of the same person cannot come into contact without destroying each other, Alternate Diego fuses with the original Diego's head, instantly killing him and his stand. \n\nWith Diego missing, first place is awarded to the carefree Pocoloco, who had slept through the start of the race and only caught up by sheer luck. Stephen Steel arrives to save Johnny, who is able to reverse his own spin with his stand after being assisted onto a horse. Valentine's death is covered up as a retirement from public life, with concerns over the race placated by the donation of the prize money to charitable causes. Johnny, having regained his ability to walk through the power of his Stand and the Spin, leaves America to return Gyro's body to his family. On the boat he meets the Japanese racer Norisuke Higashikata, whose daughter Rina he later marries, leading to the events of Part 8, ''[[JoJolion]]''.\n\n==Characters==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters#Part 7: Steel Ball Run}}\n* '''{{visible anchor|Johnny Joestar}}'''{{efn|{{nihongo|Johnny Joestar|\u30b8\u30e7\u30cb\u30a3\u30fb\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Jon\u012b J\u014dsut\u0101}}}} is a former horse racer from Kentucky, who is paralyzed from the waist down.

He uses the Stand Tusk,{{efn|{{nihongo|Tusk|{{ruby-ja|\u7259|\u30bf\u30b9\u30af}}|Tasuku}}}} which allows him to shoot his finger nails as bullets.

recommended ''Steel Ball Run'' as a good place to start for people who have not read previous parts, due to how it serves as a reboot of the ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' series, and appreciated how its move to the monthly ''seinen'' magazine ''Ultra Jump'' enabled Araki to write longer stories and depict things that would have been difficult to do in a ''[[sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]]'' magazine.<ref name=\"kono manga\"/> Erkael of ''Manga-News'' called the manga one of the best in the series, and said that it does not disappoint the reader at any point.<ref name=\"manga-news series review\"/> ''[[Anime News Network]]'' called ''Steel Ball Run'' an interesting take on the battle manga genre due to its positive portrayal of a hero with a disability, and found it, along with ''[[JoJolion]]'', to represent a big shift in the evolution of Araki's art, following his earlier shift from muscle men to thinner characters and fashion.<ref name=\"ann interview 2017-06\"/>\n\nK. Thor Jensen of ''[[Geek.com]]'' called the portrayal of Johnny and Gyro's relationship one of the best platonic friendships in comics, citing their transition from rivals to close allies who make sacrifices for one another and help each other with their respective abilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geek.com/comics/the-11-best-bromances-in-comics-1708153/ |title=The 11 Best Bromances In Comics |author=Jensen, K.

They wrote that the lack of Stands early in the story, with Gyro instead using steel balls, was surprising but refreshing, and reminiscent of the ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure#Hamon|hamon]]'' abilities featured in the first part in the ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]''; they still enjoyed the shift in focus to Stand abilities later in the story, calling them \"original and surprising\".<ref name=\"manga-news series review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.manga-news.com/index.php/serie/critique/Jojos-bizarre-adventure-Steel-Ball-Run |title=Critique de la s\u00e9rie Jojo's bizarre adventure - Saison 7 - Steel Ball Run |language=French |author=Erkael |date=October 8, 2016 |website=Manga-News |access-date=August 19, 2017 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20170819151754/http://www.manga-news.com/index.php/serie/critique/Jojos-bizarre-adventure-Steel-Ball-Run |archive-date=August 19, 2017 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> ''Kono Manga ga Sugoi!'' liked the depiction of the landscapes Johnny and Gyro travel through, calling them \"beautiful\".<ref name=\"kono manga\">{{cite web |url=http://konomanga.jp/guide/100109-2 |title=\u300eSTEEL BALL RUN\u300f \u7b2c1\u5dfb \u8352\u6728\u98db\u5442\u5f66 \u3010\u65e5\u520a\u30de\u30f3\u30ac\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u3011 |language=Japanese |date=March 18, 2017 |website=Kono Manga ga Sugoi! |publisher=[[Takarajimasha]] |access-date=August 19, 2017 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20170819142112/http://konomanga.jp/guide/100109-2 |archive-date=August 19, 2017 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://annex.s-manga.net/sbr/ Official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130717123147/http://vomic.shueisha.co.jp/sbr/ Official Vomic page]\n* {{ann|manga|5564}}\n{{JoJo's Bizarre Adventure}}\n{{Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump - 2000\u20132009}}\n{{Ultra Jump}}\n\n[[Category:Alternate history manga]]\n[[Category:JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]\n[[Category:Seinen manga]]\n[[Category:Sh\u014dnen manga]]\n[[Category:Shueisha manga]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|The seventh story arc of the Japanese manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Steel Ball Run\n| image           = Steel Ball issue.jpg\n| caption         = Cover art of ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' issue ''Steel Ball Run'' debuted in, featuring Gyro Zeppeli.\n| ja_kanji        = \u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3\n| ja_romaji       = Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran\n| genre           = <!-- Note: Use and cite reliable sources to identify genre/s, not personal interpretation.

Set in 1890, it stars Gyro Zeppeli, a disgraced former executioner, and Johnny Joestar, a former star jockey who was shot and lost the use of his legs, as well as his fame and fortune. They, along with others, compete in the titular cross-continental race for $50 million, but the race has a hidden agenda behind it.\n\nOriginally the first 23 chapters (4 volumes) were serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' in 2004 simply under the title ''Steel Ball Run''. Although the character's names are obviously related to the series, it was unclear if the story was a part of ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure''. However, when the series moved to ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005, it was officially announced as part 7 of ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'', but in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]], like the following and current arc, ''[[JoJolion]]''.\n\nThe 95 chapters were combined into 24 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes (volumes 81\u2013104 of the entire series), following the trend set by the previous part, ''[[Stone Ocean]]'', of starting over the volume count. A couple of chapters were adapted into a \"Vomic\" series, which has voice actors act over the manga pages as they are shown on screen.\n\n==Plot==\nThe series is set in 1890 in an alternate reality from previous ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' parts, where racing jockeys from all over the world flock to the United States to take part in the Steel Ball Run \u2014 a cross-country horse race from San Diego to New York City with a prize of fifty million dollars. Johnny Joestar, a former jockey who fell from glory after a shooting paralyzed him from the waist down, enters the race after meeting the mysterious Gyro Zeppeli to learn the secrets of the man's Spin technique which temporarily restored his mobility. While beginning as rivals, Johnny and Gyro become friends as they travel through the wilderness while fending off violent competitors.\n\nAs Gyro begins teaching Johnny the secrets of the Spin, his own background is explored through flashbacks. He is a former executioner from [[Naples]] who is competing in the Steel Ball Run not for his own gain, but to win the favor of the Neapolitan royalty and thus prevent the unjust execution of a young boy, Marco, who has been falsely accused of treason. The two continue their progression through the race, all the while being attacked by various assassins, terrorists, and outlaws.\n\nAlthough the Steel Ball Run is organized by the eccentric oil tycoon Stephen Steel, it is revealed that the race is backed by the United States government. Steel is unaware of the actual agenda of US President Funny Valentine: the race is a means for Valentine to collect the scattered pieces of a two-thousand-year-old corpse known as the Saint's Corpse (implied to be the body of [[Jesus Christ]], brought to America by [[Joseph of Arimathea]]) so he can use the reassembled body to achieve incredible power. Stephen's wife Lucy discovers this plot and finds out that Valentine already possesses one part of the Corpse, the heart.\n\nAfter Johnny and Gyro encounter another piece of the Saint's Corpse, it is absorbed into Johnny's body and he develops the Stand Tusk, allowing him to fend off one of Valentine's minions. Later, they meet the mysterious racer Diego Brando (a counterpart to the character Dio Brando, a major antagonist in previous installments of the series), who obtains one of two Corpse eyes, while Gyro gains the other.\n\nLucy intercepts a message to Valentine about the Corpse parts, making her a target for his men. She is able to escape him and with Johnny and Gyro's help she finds one of the parts. With the information provided by Lucy, Johnny and Gyro decide to search for the next three Corpse parts while sending Lucy, with the advantage of Gyro's Corpse eye, to take the Heart from Valentine himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Diego makes a deal with Valentine to help him deal with the traitor (who Valentine does not know is Lucy). Partnered with another racer, Diego attacks Johnny and Gyro. Gyro teaches Johnny how to use the [[Golden Ratio]] found in nature to amplify the power of the Spin, which evolves his Stand and allows him to defeat the other racer with this technique, but Diego escapes and all but one of the Corpse parts are stolen by another racer, Hot Pants.\n\nJohnny and Gyro are next forced to deal with a Stand based on the fable of [[The Honest Woodman]] by [[Aesop]], which grants them a considerable fortune alongside another Corpse part but forces them to get rid of both before sunrise or else they will be trapped within an ancient tree forever and become the new users of the Stand, making the same deal with passersby. The duo spend the money hiring a mercenary force to fend off Valentine's henchmen, but Gyro is nearly lost forever until Johnny trades away the Corpse parts to the last survivor of Valentine's forces, saving Gyro's life but leaving them with nothing.\n\nLucy uses Hot Pants' Stand to disguise herself as Valentine's wife Scarlet, while Hot Pants steals several Corpse parts from Valentine, including the Heart.\n\nJohnny and Gyro are led to a garbage dump by Hot Pants, only for all three to be nearly defeated by one of Valentine's men, who takes all of the parts they have collected. With the help of a vision of the Saint, Johnny's Stand develops new powers in combination with the Spin. Before he can win the battle, however, Valentine arrives and kills his own minion, then leaves along with all the Corpse parts except for the undiscovered head and the eyes possessed by Diego and Lucy. Upon returning to the [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]], Valentine uncovers Lucy's disguise and takes her captive after she fuses with the Corpse and seemingly becomes pregnant with the Corpse's head.\n\nLucy escapes from captivity, only to be lured into Valentine's clutches once again. Diego and Hot Pants ally against Valentine, chasing him and Lucy to a trainyard while being followed themselves by Johnny and Gyro. Diego and Hot Pants fight Valentine on the moving train but his Stand \u201cD4C\u201d (Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap) allows for multiple universes to exist simultaneously. Valentine\u2019s stand ability proves to be far too dangerous as Diego is lured to his death after Valentine pulls him under the moving train, bisecting him. Hot Pants is killed when space time distortions cause multiple solid objects to converge with her heart, instantly killing her. Lucy begins to metamorphose into a being resembling the Saint's Corpse. This grants Valentine even further powers in the form of an ability for D4C called Love Train, a dimensional wall of light that redirects all harm away from Valentine and randomly redistributes it as misfortune across the world. \n\nJohnny and Gyro arrive and attempt to battle the seemingly invulnerable Valentine. Johnny is momentarily incapacitated as Gyro and Valentine take their fight towards the Atlantic Ocean, with Gyro unlocking his stand \u201cBall Breaker\u201d utilizing the Golden Spin and the Steel Balls.  Gyro is able to pass Johnny a cryptic hint regarding The Golden Spin, a form of spin utilizing gravity. Although Ball Breaker is able to pass through Love Train and greatly damage Valentine, he unexpectedly survives Ball Breakers second attack however, and kills Gyro after multiple wounds travel towards his heart. At the last possible second, Johnny understands Gyros hint and is able to achieve the Golden Spin with Tusk, unlocking ACT 4, which allows Johnny to mark objects or beings with infinite rotation. Valentine is horrified as Tusk ACT 4\u2019s attack is able to breach his dimensional wall and mark D4C with infinite rotation. Pursued by infinite rotation regardless of which dimension he travels to, Valentine is forced to surrender and attempts to make a deal with Johnny, offering to resurrect Gyro by finding a version of him in another universe in exchange for the Corpse. Johnny nearly agrees but realizes that this is a trick after he notices Valentine holding a gun taken from another universe, which he intended to kill Johnny with if he let his guard down. Johnny kills Valentine in a fierce standoff, but realizes somebody else has taken the Corpse, now separate from Lucy.\n\nPursuing this unknown enemy into the final stage of the Steel Ball Run, Johnny is shocked to find that it is an alternate version Diego Brando, taken from a different universe by Valentine and entrusted with the Corpse. Unlike the previous Diego, this one possesses the time-stopping Stand of Dio Brando, THE WORLD. A flashback reveals that Valentine has educated the alternate Diego on the dangers of Tusk ACT 4 and a battle on the streets of New York begins. The new Diego is able to stop time for Johnny utilizing THE WORLD, however, Tusk ACT 4 is shown to be able to slightly mitigate the time stop by the use of gravity. Diego eventually outsmarts Johnny by weaponizing Tusk ACT 4\u2019s own Golden Spin against it. THE WORLD is attacked by ACT 4, but Diego uses his stand to sever his leg which was attacked by the infinite rotation and redirects it at Johnny. Overwhelmed by his own stand ability, Johnny begins to die. Diego then goes on to win the race in first place. He brings the Corpse to Trinity Church, where Valentine intended to lock it in a vault so that its powers would protect America forever. At the last moment, Lucy arrives with the severed head of the previous Diego. Terrified, Diego stops time with THE WORLD, but is unable to crawl up the stairs with his missing leg and accidentally comes into contact with the root world Diegos head. Since parallel instances of the same person cannot come into contact without destroying each other, Alternate Diego fuses with the original Diego\u2019s head, instantly killing him and his stand. \n\nWith Diego missing, first place is awarded to the carefree Pocoloco, who had slept through the start of the race and only caught up by sheer luck. Stephen Steel arrives to save Johnny, who is able to reverse his own spin with his stand after being assisted onto a horse. Valentine's death is covered up as a retirement from public life, with concerns over the race placated by the donation of the prize money to charitable causes. Johnny, having regained his ability to walk through the power of his Stand and the Spin, leaves America to return Gyro's body to his family. On the boat he meets the Japanese racer Norisuke Higashikata, whose daughter Rina he later marries, leading to the events of Part 8, ''[[JoJolion]]''.\n\n==Characters==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters#Part 7: Steel Ball Run}}\n* '''{{visible anchor|Johnny Joestar}}'''{{efn|{{nihongo|Johnny Joestar|\u30b8\u30e7\u30cb\u30a3\u30fb\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Jon\u012b J\u014dsut\u0101}}}} is a former horse racer from Kentucky, who is paralyzed from the waist down.

He uses the Stand Tusk,{{efn|{{nihongo|Tusk|{{ruby-ja|\u7259|\u30bf\u30b9\u30af}}|Tasuku}}}} which allows him to shoot his finger nails as bullets.

recommended ''Steel Ball Run'' as a good place to start for people who have not read previous parts, due to how it serves as a reboot of the ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' series, and appreciated how its move to the monthly ''seinen'' magazine ''Ultra Jump'' enabled Araki to write longer stories and depict things that would have been difficult to do in a ''[[sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]]'' magazine.<ref name=\"kono manga\"/> Erkael of ''Manga-News'' called the manga one of the best in the series, and said that it does not disappoint the reader at any point.<ref name=\"manga-news series review\"/> ''[[Anime News Network]]'' called ''Steel Ball Run'' an interesting take on the battle manga genre due to its positive portrayal of a hero with a disability, and found it, along with ''[[JoJolion]]'', to represent a big shift in the evolution of Araki's art, following his earlier shift from muscle men to thinner characters and fashion.<ref name=\"ann interview 2017-06\"/>\n\nK. Thor Jensen of ''[[Geek.com]]'' called the portrayal of Johnny and Gyro's relationship one of the best platonic friendships in comics, citing their transition from rivals to close allies who make sacrifices for one another and help each other with their respective abilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geek.com/comics/the-11-best-bromances-in-comics-1708153/ |title=The 11 Best Bromances In Comics |author=Jensen, K.

They wrote that the lack of Stands early in the story, with Gyro instead using steel balls, was surprising but refreshing, and reminiscent of the ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure#Hamon|hamon]]'' abilities featured in the first part in the ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]''; they still enjoyed the shift in focus to Stand abilities later in the story, calling them \"original and surprising\".<ref name=\"manga-news series review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.manga-news.com/index.php/serie/critique/Jojos-bizarre-adventure-Steel-Ball-Run |title=Critique de la s\u00e9rie Jojo's bizarre adventure - Saison 7 - Steel Ball Run |language=French |author=Erkael |date=October 8, 2016 |website=Manga-News |access-date=August 19, 2017 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20170819151754/http://www.manga-news.com/index.php/serie/critique/Jojos-bizarre-adventure-Steel-Ball-Run |archive-date=August 19, 2017 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> ''Kono Manga ga Sugoi!'' liked the depiction of the landscapes Johnny and Gyro travel through, calling them \"beautiful\".<ref name=\"kono manga\">{{cite web |url=http://konomanga.jp/guide/100109-2 |title=\u300eSTEEL BALL RUN\u300f \u7b2c1\u5dfb \u8352\u6728\u98db\u5442\u5f66 \u3010\u65e5\u520a\u30de\u30f3\u30ac\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u3011 |language=Japanese |date=March 18, 2017 |website=Kono Manga ga Sugoi! |publisher=[[Takarajimasha]] |access-date=August 19, 2017 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20170819142112/http://konomanga.jp/guide/100109-2 |archive-date=August 19, 2017 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://annex.s-manga.net/sbr/ Official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130717123147/http://vomic.shueisha.co.jp/sbr/ Official Vomic page]\n* {{ann|manga|5564}}\n{{JoJo's Bizarre Adventure}}\n{{Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump - 2000\u20132009}}\n{{Ultra Jump}}\n\n[[Category:Alternate history manga]]\n[[Category:JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]\n[[Category:Seinen manga]]\n[[Category:Sh\u014dnen manga]]\n[[Category:Shueisha manga]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: , \u2192 , , \u2019s \u2192 's (6)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Ball_Run"}

It was serialized by [[Kodansha]] in the manga anthology magazine ''[[Weekly Morning]]'' from 1994 to 2005. After Hagin Yi died of cancer in September 1998, King Gonta picked up the story himself. A total of 409 chapters were published and compiled into 36 separate books. In 1998, it won the 22nd [[Kodansha Manga Award]] in the general category.\n\nIn Japan, ''S\u014dten K\u014dro'' was advertised by its publisher as {{nihongo|\"Neo-Sangokushi\"|\u30cd\u30aa\u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7}}, which may be translated as \"Neo Romance of the Three Kingdoms\".\n\n== Story ==\n\nS\u014dten K\u014dro's story is based loosely on the events taking place in [[Three Kingdoms]] period of China during the life of the last Chancellor of the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]], [[Cao Cao]] (155 \u2013 March 15, 220), who also serves as the main character.\n\nThe Three Kingdoms period has been a popular theme in Japanese manga for decades, but ''S\u014dten K\u014dro'' differs greatly from most of the others on several points.  One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th-century version, ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' by [[Luo Guanzhong]].  Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, ''[[Records of Three Kingdoms]]'' by [[Chen Shou]], as a reference rather than the aforementioned ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' novel.  By this, the traditional hero of ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'', [[Liu Bei]], takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light.  Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as [[Diao Chan]], as well as anachronistic weapons such as [[Guan Yu]]\u2019s [[Green Dragon Crescent Blade]] and [[Zhang Fei]]\u2019s Viper Spear.\n\nA consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals.  This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of [[Confucianism]] and those that support them.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|[[Cao Cao]]|\u66f9\u64cd|S\u014d S\u014d}}\n:{{Anime voice|[[Mamoru Miyano]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|[[Liu Bei]]|\u5289\u5099|Ry\u016b Bi}}\n:{{Anime voice|[[Tomokazu Seki]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|[[Xiahou Dun]]|\u590f\u4faf\u60c7|Kak\u014d Ton}}\n:{{Anime voice|[[Takeshi Kusao]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|[[Xiahou Yuan]]|\u590f\u4faf\u6df5|Kak\u014d En}}\n:{{Anime voice|[[Tetsu Inada]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|[[Cao Ren]]|\u66f9\u4ec1|S\u014d Jin}}\n:{{Anime voice|[[Isshin Chiba]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|[[Cao Hong]]|\u66f9\u6d2a|S\u014d K\u014d}}\n:{{Anime voice|[[Hisao Egawa]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|[[Yuan Shao]]|\u8881\u7d39|En Sh\u014d}}\n:{{Anime voice|[[Masaki Terasoma]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|[[Guan Yu]]|\u95a2\u7fbd|Kan U}}\n:{{Anime voice|[[Ken'ichi Morozumi]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|[[Zhang Fei]]|\u5f35\u98db|Ch\u014d Hi}}\n:{{Anime voice|[[Takaaki Seki]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|[[Cao Teng]]|\u66f9\u9a30|S\u014d T\u014d}}\n:{{Anime voice|[[Nachi Nozawa]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|[[Cao Song]]|\u66f9\u5d69|S\u014d S\u016b}}\n:{{Anime voice|[[Hiroshi Yanaka]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|[[Dong Zhuo]]|\u8463\u5353|T\u014d Taku}}\n:{{Anime voice|[[H\u014dch\u016b \u014ctsuka]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|[[Zhang Rang]]|\u5f35\u8b72|Ch\u014d J\u014d}}\n:{{Anime voice|[[Kinry\u016b Arimoto]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|[[Emperor Ling of Han]]|\u970a\u5e1d|Reitei}}\n:{{Anime voice|[[Nozomu Sasaki]]}}\n\n==Media==\n\n=== Manga ===\n{{Main|List of S\u014dten K\u014dro chapters}}\n\nThe Japanese [[manga]] series ''S\u014dten K\u014dro'' is written by [[King Gonta]], adapted from an original story by Hagin Yi.
