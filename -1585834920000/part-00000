He is most notable for winning the 1969 [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award]] as a member of the [[New York Mets]]\n\n==Early life==\nSix months after Clendenon was born in [[Neosho, Missouri]], his father, Claude, died from [[leukemia]]. Claude Clendenon was a [[mathematics]] and [[psychology]] [[professor]] and chairman of the mathematics department at [[Langston University]], an all-black school in [[Langston, Oklahoma]].

Williams served as a coach on nearly every baseball team that Clendenon played on, including his college team at Atlanta's [[Morehouse College]], and his semi-pro career with the [[Atlanta Black Crackers]]. Along with Williams, Clendenon received pointers from some of the players Williams knew from the Negro Leagues, including [[Jackie Robinson]], [[Satchel Paige]], [[Roy Campanella]] and [[Don Newcombe]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Morehouse College==\nClendenon graduated as a letterman in nine sports at [[Washington High School (Atlanta, Georgia)|Booker T.

He was prepared to attend [[UCLA]] on a scholarship until some coaches from [[Morehouse College]] in Atlanta visited his mother, and convinced her that he should attend a school closer to home.\n\nMorehouse College was and is one of the premier academic institutions for young [[African-American]] men. Just before Clendenon arrived in {{by|1952}}, the freshman class were assigned \"Big Brothers\" to help the students acclimate themselves to Morehouse and college life.

Clendenon, however, decided he wanted to teach, and began teaching fourth grade upon graduation. Williams convinced Clendenon to attend a [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] try-out camp in {{by|1957}}, and he signed with the team as an amateur [[free agent]] shortly afterwards.\n\n==Major League Baseball career==\n[[File:Donn Clendenon 1965.jpg|thumb|Clendenon in 1965]]\n\n===Pittsburgh Pirates===\nAfter five seasons in the minor leagues, Clendenon made his major league debut with Pittsburgh in {{by|1961}} as a September call-up.

He also earned a reputation as a \"free swinger\" as he led the league in [[strikeouts]] in {{by|1963}} and {{by|1968}}, and finished second in 1966 and third in 1965.\n\n===1968 expansion draft===\nWith first base prospect [[Al Oliver]] waiting in the wings, the Pirates left Clendenon unprotected for the [[1968 Major League Baseball expansion draft]], and he was selected by the [[Montreal Expos]]. On January 22, {{by|1969}}, the Expos traded Clendenon and [[Jes\u00fas Alou]] to the [[Houston Astros]] for [[Rusty Staub]]; however, Clendenon refused to report to the Astros.

Mets manager [[Gil Hodges]] emerged from the dugout to argue, and showed DiMuro a shoe-polish smudge on the ball. DiMuro reversed his call, and awarded Jones first base.

Clendenon batted .288 with 22 home runs for the season, and set the Mets' single season RBI record with 97.\n\nAfter having been demoted to the [[Tidewater Tides]] in 1970, Ed Kranepool enjoyed a career year with the Mets in {{by|1971}}. With first base prospects [[Mike Jorgensen]] and [[John Milner]] also both waiting in the wings, Clendenon became the odd man out, and was released by the Mets at the end of the 1971 season.\n\nClendenon caught on with the St. Louis Cardinals for the {{by|1972}} season, but saw very limited playing time behind [[Matty Alou]]. He was released on August 7 with a .191 batting average, four home runs and just nine RBIs. Three weeks after Clendenon's release, the Cardinals dealt Alou to the [[Oakland Athletics]], and spent the rest of the season with a revolving door at first base.\n<div>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Seasons\n|Games\n|[[at-bats|AB]]\n|Runs\n|Hits\n|2B\n|3B\n|HR\n|RBI\n|[[stolen base|SB]]\n|[[walk (baseball)|BB]]\n|SO\n|[[hit by pitch|HBP]]\n|Avg.\n|[[Slugging percentage|Slg.]]\n|[[On-base percentage|OBP]]\n|[[Fielding percentage|Fld%]]\n|-\n|12\n|1362\n|4648\n|594\n|1273\n|192\n|57\n|159\n|682\n|90\n|379\n|1140\n|21\n|.274\n|.442\n|.328\n|.987\n|}\n</div>\n\n==Post-baseball==\nAfter retiring, Clendenon returned to Pittsburgh and earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[Duquesne University]] in {{by|1978}}, then began practicing law in [[Dayton, Ohio]].

The Mets eventually won the game, 5\u20133, to complete their improbable World Series victory over the heavily-favored Orioles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYN/NYN196910160.shtml|title=1969 World Series Game Five|publisher=Baseball-reference.com|date=1969-10-16}}</ref>\n\nFor the series, Clendenon batted .357 (5 for 14) with three home runs and four RBI, and was named [[World Series MVP]]. His three home runs remain tied for most home runs in a five-game Series, with [[Ryan Howard]] equaling it in the [[2008 World Series]].\n\n===Retirement===\nOn July 28, {{by|1970}}, Clendenon set a Mets record by driving in seven runs with a pair of three-run homers and a [[sacrifice fly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYN/NYN197007280.shtml|title=New York Mets 12, San Francisco Giants 2|publisher=Baseball-reference.com|date=1970-07-28}}</ref> The Mets were in second place, one game back of the Pirates at the end of play that day. However, they sputtered from there, ending the season in third place, six games back of the division winning Pirates. Clendenon batted .288 with 22 home runs for the season, and set the Mets' single season RBI record with 97.\n\nAfter having been demoted to the [[Tidewater Tides]] in 1970, Ed Kranepool enjoyed a career year with the Mets in {{by|1971}}. With first base prospects [[Mike Jorgensen]] and [[John Milner]] also both waiting in the wings, Clendenon became the odd man out, and was released by the Mets at the end of the 1971 season.\n\nClendenon caught on with the St. Louis Cardinals for the {{by|1972}} season, but saw very limited playing time behind [[Matty Alou]]. He was released on August 7 with a .191 batting average, four home runs and just nine RBIs. Three weeks after Clendenon's release, the Cardinals dealt Alou to the [[Oakland Athletics]], and spent the rest of the season with a revolving door at first base.\n<div>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Seasons\n|Games\n|[[at-bats|AB]]\n|Runs\n|Hits\n|2B\n|3B\n|HR\n|RBI\n|[[stolen base|SB]]\n|[[walk (baseball)|BB]]\n|SO\n|[[hit by pitch|HBP]]\n|Avg.\n|[[Slugging percentage|Slg.]]\n|[[On-base percentage|OBP]]\n|[[Fielding percentage|Fld%]]\n|-\n|12\n|1362\n|4648\n|594\n|1273\n|192\n|57\n|159\n|682\n|90\n|379\n|1140\n|21\n|.274\n|.442\n|.328\n|.987\n|}\n</div>\n\n==Post-baseball==\nAfter retiring, Clendenon returned to Pittsburgh and earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[Duquesne University]] in {{by|1978}}, then began practicing law in [[Dayton, Ohio]].

After the swayamvara,  she accompanies her husband to his kingdom, but later chooses to accompany her husband, along with her brother-in-law [[Lakshmana]], in his exile. While in exile, the trio settles in the [[Dandaka]] forest from where she is abducted by [[Ravana]], the [[Rakshasa]] king of [[Lanka]]. She is imprisoned in [[Ashoka Vatika]] in Lanka until she is rescued by Rama, who slays her captor. After the war, in some versions of the epic, Rama asks Sita to undergo Agni Pariksha (an [[Trial by ordeal#By fire|ordeal of fire]]) by which she proves her purity before she is accepted by Rama, which for the first time makes his brother Lakshmana get angry at him.\n\nIn some versions of the epic, the fire-god&nbsp;[[Agni]]&nbsp;creates [[Maya Sita]], who takes Sita's place and is abducted by Ravana and suffers his captivity, while the real Sita hides in the fire. During the Agni Pariksha, Maya Sita and the real Sita exchange places again. While some texts say that Maya Sita is destroyed in the flames of Agni Pariksha, others narrate how she is blessed and reborn as the epic heroine&nbsp;[[Draupadi]]&nbsp;or the goddess&nbsp;[[Alamelu|Padmavati]]. Some scriptures also mention her previous birth being&nbsp;[[Vedavati]], a woman Ravana tries to molest. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} After proving her purity, Rama and Sita return to Ayodhya, where they are crowned as king and queen. After a few months, Sita becomes pregnant, to which a washerman makes insensitive comments on Sita to his wife, which Rama in disguise hears. Rama then sends Sita away on exile. Lakshmana is the one who leaves Sita in the forests near sage&nbsp;[[Valmiki]]'s ashram. Years later, Sita returns to the womb of her mother, the Earth, for release from a cruel world as a testimony of her purity after she reunites her two sons [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]] and [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]] with their father Rama.<ref>{{cite book|title=India through the ages|url=https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= [https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada/page/78 78]|editor=K.S.

The word ''S\u012bta'' was a poetic term, its imagery redolent of fecundity and the many blessings coming from settled agriculture. The Sita of the ''Ramayana'' may have been named after a more ancient [[Rigvedic deities|Vedic goddess]] Sita, who is mentioned once in the [[Rigveda]] as an earth goddess who blesses the land with good crops. In the [[Vedic period]], she was one of the goddesses associated with fertility. A Vedic hymn ([[s:The Rig Veda/Mandala 4/Hymn 57|Rig Veda 4:57]]) recites:\n{{cquote|''Auspicious Sita, come thou near;''\n''We venerate and worship thee'' <br />\n''That thou mayst bless and prosper us'' <br />\n''And bring us fruits abundantly.'' <br /> ''}}\n\nIn ''[[Harivamsa]]'', Sita is invoked as one of the names of the goddess Arya:\n{{cquote|''O goddess, you are the altar's center in the sacrifice,'' <br />\n''The priest's fee'' <br />\n''Sita to those who hold the plough'' <br />\n''And Earth to all living being.

Later, the story of Sita miraculously appearing in a furrow was inserted in ''Valmiki Ramayana''.<ref name=\"Singaravelu 235\" />\n* ''Reincarnation of [[Vedavati]]'': Some versions of the ''Ramayana'' suggest that Sita was a reincarnation of Vedavati.

Manivati is later reborn as the daughter of Ravana and [[Mandodari]]. But astrologers predicted the ruin of Ravana because of this child. So, Ravana orders to kill the child.

Thus, Ravana abandons her and orders the infant to be buried in a distant land where she is later discovered and adopted by Janaka.<ref name=\"Singaravelu 235\" />\n\n===Marriage===\n[[File:Rama breaking the bow to win Sita as wife.jpg|thumb|Rama breaks the bow to win Sita as wife.]]\nWhen Sita reaches adulthood, [[Janaka]] organizes a [[Swayamvara]] in [[Janakpurdham]] with the condition that Sita would marry only that person who would be able to string ''Pinaka'', the bow of the god [[Shiva]]. Janaka knew that the bow of Shiva was not even liftable, let alone stringable for ordinary mortals, and for selfish people it was not even approachable. Thus, Janaka tries to find the best husband for Sita.\n\nAt this time, [[Vishvamitra]] had brought Rama and his brother Lakshmana to the forest for the protection of sacrifice. Hearing about this ''swayamvara'', Vishvamitra asks Rama to participate in it and takes Rama and Lakshmana to the palace of Janaka in [[Janakpur]]. Janaka is greatly pleased to learn that Rama and Lakshmana are sons of Dasharatha. Next morning, in the middle of the hall, Rama lifts up the bow of Shiva with his left hand, fastens the string taut and breaks the bow in the process. However, another avatar of Vishnu, [[Parashurama]], became really angry as the bow of Shiva was broken. However, he does not realize that Rama is also an avatar of Vishnu, therefore after being informed of this, he apologizes for getting angry. Thus, Rama fulfills Janaka's condition to marry Sita. Later on [[Vivaha Panchami]], a marriage ceremony is conducted under the guidance of Satananda. Rama marries Sita, Bharata marries Mandavi, Lakshmana marries Urmila and Shatrughna marries Shrutakirti.<ref name=Parmeshwaranand />\n\n===Exile and abduction===\n[[File:Ravi Varma-Ravana Sita Jathayu.jpg|thumb|upright|Ravana cuts off Jatayu's wing while abducting Sita]]\nSome time after the wedding, [[Kaikeyi]], Rama's stepmother, compelled Dasharatha to make Bharata king, prompted by the coaxing of her maid [[Manthara]], and forced Rama to leave Ayodhya and spend a period of exile in the forests of [[Dandaka]] and later Panchavati. Sita and Lakshmana willingly renounced the comforts of the palace and joined Rama in exile. The Panchavati forest became the scene for Sita's abduction by Ravana, King of Lanka. Ravana kidnapped Sita, disguising himself as a mendicant, while Rama was away fetching a [[Maricha|golden deer]] to please her. Some versions of the ''Ramayana'' describe Sita taking refuge with the fire-god [[Agni]], while [[Maya Sita]], her illusionary double, is kidnapped by the demon-king. [[Jatayu (Ramayana)|Jatayu]], the vulture-king, tried to protect Sita but Ravana chopped off his wings.

During her captivity for a year in Lanka, Ravana expressed his desire for her; however, Sita refused his advances and struggled to maintain her chastity. [[Hanuman]] was sent by Rama to seek Sita and eventually succeeded in discovering Sita's whereabouts. Sita gave Hanuman her jewellery and asked him to give it to her husband. Hanuman returned across the sea to Rama.<ref name=\"Mani720\"/>\n\nSita was finally rescued by Rama, who waged a war to defeat Ravana. Upon rescue, Rama makes Sita undergo a trial by fire to prove her chastity. In some versions of ''Ramayana'', during this test the fire-god Agni appears in front of Rama and attests to Sita's purity, or hands over to him the real Sita and declares it was Maya Sita who was abducted by Ravana.<ref name=\"Mani720\"/> The Thai version of the Ramayana, however, tells of Sita walking on the fire, of her own accord, to feel clean, as opposed to jumping in it. She is not burnt, and the coals turn to lotuses.After proving that Sita is still pure, she returns to Ayodhya. But the citizens of Ayodhaya don't accept Sita and says that she is impure, and ram has to forcefully sent Sita against his wish.

During Rama's period of rule, an intemperate [[Dhobi|washerman]], while berating his wayward wife, declared that he was \"no pusillanimous Rama who would take his wife back after she had lived in the house of another man\". This statement was reported back to Rama, who knew that the accusation against Sita was baseless. Nevertheless, he would not let [[slander]] undermine his rule, so he sent Sita away.\n\nThus Sita was forced into exile a second time. Sita, who was pregnant, was given refuge in the hermitage of [[Valmiki]], where she delivered twin sons named [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]] and [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]].<ref name=Parmeshwaranand /> In the hermitage, Sita raised her sons alone, as a single mother.<ref name=\"Contemporary Influence of Sita by\">{{cite web|last=Bhargava|first=Anju P.|title=Contemporary Influence of Sita by|url=http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITsitaframeset.htm|publisher=The Infinity Foundation|accessdate=31 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713001426/http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITsitaframeset.htm|archivedate=13 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They grew up to be valiant and intelligent and were eventually united with their father.

Janaka knew that the bow of Shiva was not even liftable, let alone stringable for ordinary mortals, and for selfish people it was not even approachable. Thus, Janaka tries to find the best husband for Sita.\n\nAt this time, [[Vishvamitra]] had brought Rama and his brother Lakshmana to the forest for the protection of sacrifice. Hearing about this ''swayamvara'', Vishvamitra asks Rama to participate in it and takes Rama and Lakshmana to the palace of Janaka in [[Janakpur]]. Janaka is greatly pleased to learn that Rama and Lakshmana are sons of Dasharatha. Next morning, in the middle of the hall, Rama lifts up the bow of Shiva with his left hand, fastens the string taut and breaks the bow in the process. However, another avatar of Vishnu, [[Parashurama]], became really angry as the bow of Shiva was broken. However, he does not realize that Rama is also an avatar of Vishnu, therefore after being informed of this, he apologizes for getting angry. Thus, Rama fulfills Janaka's condition to marry Sita. Later on [[Vivaha Panchami]], a marriage ceremony is conducted under the guidance of Satananda. Rama marries Sita, Bharata marries Mandavi, Lakshmana marries Urmila and Shatrughna marries Shrutakirti.<ref name=Parmeshwaranand />\n\n===Exile and abduction===\n[[File:Ravi Varma-Ravana Sita Jathayu.jpg|thumb|upright|Ravana cuts off Jatayu's wing while abducting Sita]]\nSome time after the wedding, [[Kaikeyi]], Rama's stepmother, compelled Dasharatha to make Bharata king, prompted by the coaxing of her maid [[Manthara]], and forced Rama to leave Ayodhya and spend a period of exile in the forests of [[Dandaka]] and later Panchavati. Sita and Lakshmana willingly renounced the comforts of the palace and joined Rama in exile. The Panchavati forest became the scene for Sita's abduction by Ravana, King of Lanka. Ravana kidnapped Sita, disguising himself as a mendicant, while Rama was away fetching a [[Maricha|golden deer]] to please her. Some versions of the ''Ramayana'' describe Sita taking refuge with the fire-god [[Agni]], while [[Maya Sita]], her illusionary double, is kidnapped by the demon-king. [[Jatayu (Ramayana)|Jatayu]], the vulture-king, tried to protect Sita but Ravana chopped off his wings. Jatayu survived long enough to inform Rama of what had happened.<ref name=\"Mani720\">Mani pp. 720-3; {{cite book | last = Mani | first = Vettam | title = Puranic Encyclopaedia: a Comprehensive Dictionary with Special Reference to the Epic and Puranic Literature | url = https://archive.org/details/puranicencyclopa00maniuoft | publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publishers | year = 1975 <!-- | location = Delhi --> | isbn = 978-0-8426-0822-0 | authorlink = Vettam Mani }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hanuman Encounters Sita in Ashokavana.jpg|thumb|left|Hanuman finds Sita in Ashokavana]]\nRavana took her back to his kingdom in Lanka and Sita was held as a prisoner in one of his palaces. During her captivity for a year in Lanka, Ravana expressed his desire for her; however, Sita refused his advances and struggled to maintain her chastity. [[Hanuman]] was sent by Rama to seek Sita and eventually succeeded in discovering Sita's whereabouts. Sita gave Hanuman her jewellery and asked him to give it to her husband. Hanuman returned across the sea to Rama.<ref name=\"Mani720\"/>\n\nSita was finally rescued by Rama, who waged a war to defeat Ravana. Upon rescue, Rama makes Sita undergo a trial by fire to prove her chastity. In some versions of ''Ramayana'', during this test the fire-god Agni appears in front of Rama and attests to Sita's purity, or hands over to him the real Sita and declares it was Maya Sita who was abducted by Ravana.<ref name=\"Mani720\"/> The Thai version of the Ramayana, however, tells of Sita walking on the fire, of her own accord, to feel clean, as opposed to jumping in it. She is not burnt, and the coals turn to lotuses.After proving that Sita is still pure, she returns to Ayodhya. But the citizens of Ayodhaya don't accept Sita and says that she is impure, and ram has to forcefully sent Sita against his wish. After 12 yrs he go backs to Sita and asks her to come back to Ayodhya. But Sita denies and says bhumi to take her inside herself.. Sita goes inside the earth and gives her sons to Rama....\n\n=The life of Sita, after exiling again and the reason of exiling according to mythology=\nThe couple came back to Ayodhya, where Rama was crowned king with Sita by his side.\n\nWhile Rama's trust and affection for Sita never wavered, it soon became evident that some people in Ayodhya could not accept Sita's long captivity under Ravana. During Rama's period of rule, an intemperate [[Dhobi|washerman]], while berating his wayward wife, declared that he was \"no pusillanimous Rama who would take his wife back after she had lived in the house of another man\". This statement was reported back to Rama, who knew that the accusation against Sita was baseless. Nevertheless, he would not let [[slander]] undermine his rule, so he sent Sita away.\n\nThus Sita was forced into exile a second time. Sita, who was pregnant, was given refuge in the hermitage of [[Valmiki]], where she delivered twin sons named [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]] and [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]].<ref name=Parmeshwaranand /> In the hermitage, Sita raised her sons alone, as a single mother.<ref name=\"Contemporary Influence of Sita by\">{{cite web|last=Bhargava|first=Anju P.|title=Contemporary Influence of Sita by|url=http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITsitaframeset.htm|publisher=The Infinity Foundation|accessdate=31 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713001426/http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITsitaframeset.htm|archivedate=13 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They grew up to be valiant and intelligent and were eventually united with their father. Once she had witnessed the acceptance of her children by Rama, Sita sought final refuge in the arms of her mother [[Bh\u016bmi]]. Hearing her plea for release from an unjust world and from a life that had rarely been happy, the Earth dramatically split open; Bh\u016bmi appeared and took Sita away.(Abounding of Devi S\u012bta appears in Uttara K\u0101nda which is considered by some people as later added kanda).\n\nSita's exile during her pregnancy was because of a curse during her childhood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vedpuran.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/padam-puran.pdf|title=Padma-puran pdf file|date=1 October 2018|access-date=1 October 2018}}</ref> According to [[Padma Purana|Padma-puran]], Sita had caught a pair of divine parrots which were from Valmiki's ashram when she was young. The birds were talking about story of Sri Ram heard in [[Valmiki]] ashram which intrigued Sita. She has the ability to talk with animals. The female bird was pregnant at that time. She requested Sita to let them go and return from Valmiki's Ashram as they knew only up to their marriage but Sita only allowed her male companion to fly away but female parrot died because of separation from her companion. As a result, the male bird cursed Sita that she would suffer a similar fate of being separated from her husband during pregnancy. The male bird was reborn as the washerman.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nSita test fires.png|Sita's fire test\nSita Bhum Pravesh.jpg|Sita returns to her mother, the Earth, as Sri Rama, her sons, and the sages watch in astonishment.\nRama and sita in pavilion.jpg|Rama and Sita from Uttara-Kanda.\n</gallery>\n\n==Speeches in the ''Ramayana''==\n[[File:Ramayana - Marriage of Rama Bharata Lakshmana and Shatrughna.jpg|thumb|250px|The marriage of the four sons of Dasharatha with the four daughters of Siradhvaja and Kushadhvaja Janakas.

The first time is in the town of [[Chitrakoot Dham (Karwi)|Chitrakuta]] where she narrates an ancient story to Rama, whereby Rama promises to Sita that he will never kill anybody without provocation.\n\nThe second time Sita is shown talking prominently is when she speaks to Ravana. Ravana has come to her in the form of a mendicant and Sita tells him that he does not look like one.\n\nSome of her most prominent speeches are with Hanuman when he reaches Lanka. Hanuman wants an immediate union of Rama and Sita and thus he proposes to Sita to ride on his back. Sita refuses as she does not want to run away like a thief; instead she wants her husband Rama to come and defeat Ravana to save her.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Valmiki |first1=Ramayana |title=Sundarkanda, sarga 37 |url=https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=5&language=dv&field_sarga_value=37 |website=www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in |publisher=IIT Kanpur}}</ref>\n\n==Jain version==\n{{main|Rama in Jainism}}\n[[File:Hanuman before Rama.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Rama seated with Sita, fanned by [[Lakshmana]], while [[Hanuman]] pays his respects]]\nSita is said to be the daughter of [[Ravana]]'s queen [[Mandodari]]. It was predicted that the first child of Mandodari would bring annihilation to the family. Hence, Ravana deserted the child when she was born. The minister who was responsible for this took her in a pearl-box, placed her near a plough and told King [[Janaka]] of [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]] that the girl had been born from the furrow. Janaka's queen Sunaina became Sita's foster mother.\n\nThere is also a narration about Sita's brother Bhamandala. He did not know that Sita was his sister and wanted to marry her. He even wanted to abduct her.

According to ''Ramayana'', Sita was discovered in a furrow when Janaka was ploughing. Since Janaka was a king, it is likely that ploughing was part of a royal ritual to ensure fertility of the land. Sita is considered to be a child of Mother Earth, produced by union between the king and the land.

The sub-themes of an IWOTA workshop and the lecturers are chosen by the local organizing committee after hearing the steering committee's board. The board consists of its vice presidents: Joseph A. Ball, J. William Helton (Chair), M. A. Kaashoek, Igor Klep, [[Christiane Tretter]], Victor Vinnikov and Hugo J. Woerdeman. In addition, past chief organizers who remain active in IWOTA are members of the steering committee. The board governs IWOTA with consultation and the consent of the full steering committee. Honorary members of the steering committee, elected in 2016, are: Israel Gohberg (deceased), Leiba Rodman (deceased), Tsuyoshi Ando, Harry Dym,  Ciprian Foia\u015f (deceased), Heinz Langer, Nikolai Nikolski.\n\n==Future IWOTA Meetings==\n* IWOTA 2020 will be held at [[Lancaster University]] in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[United Kingdom]].

Main organizers are Marek Ptak and Micha\u0142 Wojtylak. Dates are September 6-10, 2022\n\n==Israel Gohberg ILAS-IWOTA Lecture==\n\nThe Israel Gohberg ILAS-IWOTA Lecture was introduced in August 2016 and honors the legacy of Israel Gohberg, whose research crossed borders between operator theory, linear algebra, and related fields. This lecture is in collaboration with the [[International Linear Algebra Society]] (ILAS).<ref>{{cite web | title = International Linear Algebra Society (ILAS)| url = http://www.ilasic.org}}</ref> This series of lectures will be delivered at IWOTA and ILAS Conferences, in different years, in the approximate ratio two-thirds at IWOTA and one-third at ILAS. The first three lectures will take place at IWOTA 2020, ILAS 2022, and IWOTA 2024. Donations for the Israel Gohberg ILAS-IWOTA Lecture Fund are most welcome and can be submitted via the ILAS donation form.<ref>{{cite web | title = International Linear Algebra Society (ILAS) donation form | url = http://ilasic.org/misc/donationform.html}}</ref> Donations are tax deductible in the United States.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.springer.com/series/4850 Operator Theory: Advances and Applications Series on Springer website]\n* [http://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~iwota/ IWOTA 2000 - Bordeaux, France]\n* [http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/workshop/iwota2006/ IWOTA 2006 - Seoul, Korea]\n* [http://www.puk.ac.za/fakulteite/natuur/bwi-nav/iwota/ IWOTA 2007 - Potchefstroom, South Africa]\n* [http://www.math.wm.edu/~vladi/IWOTA/IWOTA2008.htm IWOTA 2008 - Williamsburg, Virginia, U.S.A]\n* [https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/numerik/iwota_2010/ IWOTA 2010 - Berlin, Germany]\n* [http://congreso.us.es/iwota2011/ IWOTA 2011 - Seville, Spain]\n* [http://conferences.science.unsw.edu.au/IWOTA2012/ IWOTA 2012 - Sydney, Australia]\n* [http://math.iisc.ernet.in/~iwota2013/ IWOTA 2013 - Bangalore, India]\n* [http://www.math.vu.nl/~ran/iwota2014/ IWOTA 2014 - Amsterdam, Netherlands]\n* [http://www.gmu.ge/iwota2015/ IWOTA 2015 - Tbilisi, Georgia]\n* [http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/iwota2016/ IWOTA 2016 - St. Louis, Missouri, USA]\n* [https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/mathematik/iwota2017/ IWOTA 2017 - Chemnitz, Germany]\n* [https://iwota2019.math.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/home IWOTA 2019 - Lisbon, Portugal]\n* [https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/iwota2020/ IWOTA 2020 - Lancaster, United Kingdom]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:International Workshop on Operator Theory and its Applications (IWOTA)}}\n[[Category:Mathematics conferences]]\n[[Category:Operator theory]]\n[[Category:Functional analysis]]\n[[Category:Mathematical analysis]]\n", "text_old": "'''International Workshop on Operator Theory and its Applications (IWOTA)''' was started in 1981<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news | author = J.

While [[engineering]] conference [[proceedings]] often are handed to participants as they arrive and contain short papers on each conference talk, the IWOTA [[proceedings]] follow [[Academic conference|mathematics conference]] tradition and contain a modest number of papers and are published several years after the conference.\n\n===Funding Sources===\nIWOTA has received support from many sources, including the [[National Science Foundation]]<ref name=\"NSF0126746\" /><ref name=\"NSF0536873\" /><ref>{{cite web | title = Travel Support for IWOTA 2004 | url = https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0422952&HistoricalAwards=false}}</ref>\n<ref name = \"NSF0757364\">{{cite web | title = NSF Award | series=Nineteenth International Workshop on Operator Theory and Applications | place = Williamsburg, Virginia | year=2008 | publisher = [[National Science Foundation]] | url = https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0757364&HistoricalAwards=false}}</ref>\n,<ref>{{cite web | title = Travel Support for IWOTA 2009 | url = https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0902270&HistoricalAwards=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Travel Support for IWOTA 2012 | url = https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1240475&HistoricalAwards=false}}</ref> the [[London Mathematical Society]],<ref name = \"newcastle\">{{Cite web | title = IWOTA 2004 | url = http://conferences.ncl.ac.uk/iwota/ | website = www.ncl.ac.uk | accessdate = 2015-11-24}}</ref> the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]],<ref name = \"newcastle\" /> [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = IWOTA 2010|url = http://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/numerik/iwota_2010/|website = www3.math.tu-berlin.de|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}</ref> Secretar\u00eda de Estado de Investigaci\u00f3n, Desarrollo e Innovaci\u00f3n (Spain),<ref>{{Cite web | title = IWOTA 2011|url = http://congreso.us.es/iwota2011/ | website = www.us.es | accessdate = 2015-11-24}}</ref> [[Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute]],<ref>{{cite web | title = AMSI Annual Report 2012-2013 | url = http://amsi.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AMSI_annual_report2012-13.pdf | page = 24}}</ref> [[National Board for Higher Mathematics]],<ref name = \"india\">{{Cite web | title = IWOTA 2013 | url = http://math.iisc.ernet.in/~iwota2013/ | website = www.iisc.ernet.in | accessdate = 2015-11-24}}</ref> [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]],<ref name = \"southafrica\">{{cite book | editor-last = Grobler | editor-first = J.J. | editor2-last = Labuschagne | editor2-first = L.E. | editor3-last = M\u00f6ller | editor3-first = M. | title = Operator Algebras, Operator Theory and Applications | series = Operator Theory: Advances and Applications | volume = 195 | edition = 1 | publisher = [[Birkh\u00e4user | Birkh\u00e4user Verlag]] | location = Basel | page = vii | date = 2010 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-0346-0174-0 | isbn = 978-3-0346-0173-3 | issn = 0255-0156 | url = https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783034601733}}</ref> [[Indian Statistical Institute]],<ref name=\"image\" /> [[Korea Research Foundation]],<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Ando | editor-first = T. | editor2-last = Curto | editor2-first = R.E. | editor3-last = Jung | editor3-first = I.B. |display-editors = 3 | editor4-last = Lee | editor4-first = W.Y. | title = Recent Advances in Operator Theory and Applications | series = Operator Theory: Advances and Applications | volume = 187 | edition = 1 | publisher = [[Birkh\u00e4user | Birkh\u00e4user Verlag]] | location = Basel | page = viii | date = 2009 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-7643-8893-5 | isbn = 978-3-7643-8892-8 | issn = 0255-0156 | url = https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783764388928}}</ref> [[United States-India Science & Technology Endowment Fund]],<ref name = \"india\" /> [[Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek]],<ref name=\"netherlands\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.vu.nl/~ran/iwota2014/|title=IWOTA 2014|website=www.math.vu.nl|accessdate=2015-11-22}}</ref> the Commission for Developing Countries of the [[International Mathematical Union]],<ref name = \"program\" /><ref name = \"southafrica\" /> Stichting Advancement of Mathematics (Netherlands),<ref name = \"program\" /> the [[National Research Foundation of South Africa]],<ref name = \"southafrica\" /> and [[Birkh\u00e4user | Birkh\u00e4user Publishing Ltd]].\n\n==The IWOTA Steering Committee==\nIWOTA is directed by a steering committee<ref>{{cite web | title = International Workshop on Operator Theory and its Applications (IWOTA)| url = http://math.wustl.edu/~iwota}}</ref> which chooses the site for the next meeting, elects the chief local organizer(s) and insures the appearance of the enduring themes of IWOTA. The sub-themes of an IWOTA workshop and the lecturers are chosen by the local organizing committee after hearing the steering committee's board. The board consists of its vice presidents: Joseph A. Ball, J. William Helton (Chair), M. A. Kaashoek, Igor Klep, [[Christiane Tretter]], Victor Vinnikov and Hugo J. Woerdeman. In addition, past chief organizers who remain active in IWOTA are members of the steering committee. The board governs IWOTA with consultation and the consent of the full steering committee. Honorary members of the steering committee, elected in 2016, are: Israel Gohberg (deceased), Leiba Rodman (deceased), Tsuyoshi Ando, Harry Dym,  Ciprian Foia\u015f (deceased), Heinz Langer, Nikolai Nikolski.\n\n==Future IWOTA Meetings==\n* IWOTA 2020 will be held at [[Lancaster University]] in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[United Kingdom]]. Main organizer is Gordon Blower. Dates are August 17\u201321, 2020\n* IWOTA 2021 will be held at [[Chapman University]] in [[Orange, California]], [[United States]]. Main organizers are Daniel Alpay and Mihaela Vajiac. Dates are August 9-13, 2021\n* IWOTA 2022 will be held at [[Agricultural University of Krak\u00f3w]], [[Jagiellonian University]] and [[AGH University of Science and Technology]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]]. Main organizers are Marek Ptak and Micha\u0142 Wojtylak. Dates are September 6-10, 2022\n\n==Israel Gohberg ILAS-IWOTA Lecture==\n\nThe Israel Gohberg ILAS-IWOTA Lecture was introduced in August 2016 and honors the legacy of Israel Gohberg, whose research crossed borders between operator theory, linear algebra, and related fields. This lecture is in collaboration with the International Linear Algebra Society (ILAS).<ref>{{cite web | title = International Linear Algebra Society (ILAS)| url = http://www.ilasic.org}}</ref> This series of lectures will be delivered at IWOTA and ILAS Conferences, in different years, in the approximate ratio two-thirds at IWOTA and one-third at ILAS. The first three lectures will take place at IWOTA 2020, ILAS 2022, and IWOTA 2024. Donations for the Israel Gohberg ILAS-IWOTA Lecture Fund are most welcome and can be submitted via the ILAS donation form.<ref>{{cite web | title = International Linear Algebra Society (ILAS) donation form | url = http://ilasic.org/misc/donationform.html}}</ref> Donations are tax deductible in the United States.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.springer.com/series/4850 Operator Theory: Advances and Applications Series on Springer website]\n* [http://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~iwota/ IWOTA 2000 - Bordeaux, France]\n* [http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/workshop/iwota2006/ IWOTA 2006 - Seoul, Korea]\n* [http://www.puk.ac.za/fakulteite/natuur/bwi-nav/iwota/ IWOTA 2007 - Potchefstroom, South Africa]\n* [http://www.math.wm.edu/~vladi/IWOTA/IWOTA2008.htm IWOTA 2008 - Williamsburg, Virginia, U.S.A]\n* [https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/numerik/iwota_2010/ IWOTA 2010 - Berlin, Germany]\n* [http://congreso.us.es/iwota2011/ IWOTA 2011 - Seville, Spain]\n* [http://conferences.science.unsw.edu.au/IWOTA2012/ IWOTA 2012 - Sydney, Australia]\n* [http://math.iisc.ernet.in/~iwota2013/ IWOTA 2013 - Bangalore, India]\n* [http://www.math.vu.nl/~ran/iwota2014/ IWOTA 2014 - Amsterdam, Netherlands]\n* [http://www.gmu.ge/iwota2015/ IWOTA 2015 - Tbilisi, Georgia]\n* [http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/iwota2016/ IWOTA 2016 - St. Louis, Missouri, USA]\n* [https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/mathematik/iwota2017/ IWOTA 2017 - Chemnitz, Germany]\n* [https://iwota2019.math.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/home IWOTA 2019 - Lisbon, Portugal]\n* [https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/iwota2020/ IWOTA 2020 - Lancaster, United Kingdom]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:International Workshop on Operator Theory and its Applications (IWOTA)}}\n[[Category:Mathematics conferences]]\n[[Category:Operator theory]]\n[[Category:Functional analysis]]\n[[Category:Mathematical analysis]]\n", "name_user": "SignPattern", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workshop_on_Operator_Theory_and_its_Applications"}
