It was built in very large numbers and production continued for many years after the end of the war.\n\nApart from its widespread usage, the Br\u00e9guet 14 is known for being the first mass-produced aircraft to use large amounts of metal, rather than wood, in its structure. This allowed the [[airframe]] to be lighter than a wooden airframe of the same strength, in turn making the aircraft relatively fast and agile for its size; in combat it was able to outrun many contemporary [[fighter aircraft|fighters]]. The Br\u00e9guet 14's strong construction allowed it to sustain considerable damage, in addition to being easy to handle and possessing favourable performance. The type has often been considered to have been one of the best aircraft of the war.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\nThe Br\u00e9guet 14 was designed by aviation pioneer and [[aeronautical engineer]] [[Louis Br\u00e9guet]].<ref name = \"bru noe 3\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 3.</ref> Br\u00e9guet had already built a reputation for producing capable aircraft and advanced aerodynamic test apparatus, including the [[Br\u00e9guet-Richet Gyroplane]], which held the distinction of being the first direct-lift aircraft in the world. Br\u00e9guet had been a pioneer in the field of all-metal construction, which he had employed on a successful series of [[biplane]]s during the pre-war years; these principles were used in the design of the Br\u00e9guet 14.<ref name = \"bru noe 3 4\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 3\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 quickly led to large numbers of Br\u00e9guet-built aircraft being inducted into the military air services of several nations, including many of the nations in the [[Triple Entente]].<ref name = \"bru noe 4\"/> Br\u00e9guet flew as a military pilot early on in the war and soon recognised there was demand for aircraft fitted with more powerful engines to carry worthwhile payloads over anything beyond short distances. For his next design, he opted to abandon his favoured [[tractor configuration]] in favour of a [[pusher configuration]] to better satisfy the inflexible requirements issued by the French general staff, which sought an unobstructed frontal view to benefit the observer.<ref name = \"bru noe 4\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 4.</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 1915, the French Ministry of War held a competition, seeking to determine the most suitable type of aircraft to carry a bombload of 300 lb at a speed of 120 km/h over a minimum distance of 600 km.<ref name = \"bru noe 4\"/> Following an extensive evaluation, Br\u00e9guet's submission to the contest, [[Br\u00e9guet Bre.4|SN-3]]; reportedly, a major reason for its selection over more powerful rivals was its use of the desired pusher configuration. The SN-3 would be developed into the [[Br\u00e9guet Type IV]], V, and VI, which would be built in large quantities for military use.<ref name = \"bru noe 4\"/>\n\n===Origins===\nIn spite of the preference of French officials for the pusher configuration, Br\u00e9guet remained a proponent of tractor aircraft.<ref name = \"bru noe 4 5\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> During June 1916, he decided to initiate work on a new design for a military two-seater aircraft, the Br\u00e9guet AV Type XIV. According to aviation authors J. M. Bruce and Jean Noel, the [[French Army]]'s ''Section Technique de l' A\u00e9ronautique'' (S.T.A\u00e9.) received early information on the design and recommended that Br\u00e9guet power it using a 200 hp engine by [[Hispano-Suiza]].<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> Br\u00e9guet found that the engine would be incapable of delivering the desired performance, instead insisting on the adoption of a 12-cylinder [[Renault]]-built engine that had powered the previous Br\u00e9guet Type V.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe Br\u00e9guet Type XIV was both a practical and aesthetically pleasing design.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> A distinctive characteristic of the Type XIV was its rectangular frontal radiator, as well as the shape of is cowling and the negative-stagger of its mainplanes.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> It possessed a sturdy [[landing gear|undercarriage]], along with two-part [[aileron]]s on the upper wing only. On the prototype, the lower wing reportedly featured [[flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] along the [[trailing edge]]s, that partly emulated the manner of operation of [[Aileron#Single acting ailerons|\"single-acting ailerons\"]] in only \"coming up\" from their \"down\" position at rest, as the aircraft accelerated during takeoff; these possessed a limited angle of depression and were not directly controlled by the pilot, instead being actuated by a set of 12 adjustable [[rubber]] [[bungee cord|bungee]] cords.<ref name = \"bru noe 5 6\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 5\u20136.</ref>\n\nThe airframe was composed primarily of [[duralumin]], invented in Germany by [[Alfred Wilm]] a decade earlier; many sections, such as the duralumin [[longeron]]s and spacers, were attached using [[welding|welded]] [[steel]]-tube fittings and braced using [[piano]] wire. The wing's main [[spar (aeronautics)|spar]] was of rectangular duralumin tubes complete with either [[oak]] or [[ash]] lining-pieces at the attachment points and sheet steel sheaths around the spars.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> The box-unit wooden [[rib]]s had fretted [[plywood]] webs and ash flanges. The surfaces of the tail unit used welded steel tube structures; while the elevators featured horn balances.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> During its design phase, French officials were wary of the Type XIV's structure, having made such an extensive use of the relatively new metal duralumin that it was claimed to be the first aircraft in the world to combine extensive use of the metal with oxy-welded joints.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/>\n\n===Into flight===\nOn 21 November 1916, the first [[prototype]] conducted its [[maiden flight]], flown by Br\u00e9guet.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 6.</ref> The first flight had confirmed Br\u00e9guet's opinion that the Renault engine was more suitable for the type; on 30 November 1916, he informed the S.T.A\u00e9 of this determination and of the comparably worse performance of their recommended engine.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> On 11 January 1917, Br\u00e9guet informed the S.T.A\u00e9 that the prototype had reached the point where he considered it to be representative of production-standard aircraft. Later that month, it participated in further trials and by 7 February 1917, the S.T.A\u00e9 had issued a report declaring that the prototype had attained an air speed of 172 km/h at an altitude of 2,000 meters.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/>\n\nDuring November 1916, the S.T.A\u00e9. had issued its requirements for four new aircraft types. Br\u00e9guet submitted his new design for two of those categories - [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] and [[medium bomber|bomber]]. Following its evaluation during February 1917, the Br\u00e9guet 14 had been accepted to perform both roles. On 22 February 1917, Br\u00e9guet pressed the S.T.A\u00e9 for a production order to be issued for the type; on 2 March, he declared that production [[jig (tool)|jigs]] had been prepared for quantity production of the type.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> On 6 March 1917, the first official production order was received by Br\u00e9guet, calling for 150  ''Br\u00e9guet 14 A.2''; a follow-on order for a further 100 aircraft was received on 4 April.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/>\n\n===Mass production and further development===\nBy March 1917, several orders had been placed, calling for a combined 150 reconnaissance aircraft and 100 bombers \"Br\u00e9guet 14 A.2\" and \"14 B.2\" respectively (in 1918, it was written as ''Br\u00e9guet XIV A2/B2''). The A.2 variant was equipped with an array of [[camera]]s, while some were also provisioned with [[radio]]s, while the lower wing of the 14 B.2 was modified to accommodate bomb racks (built by [[Michelin]]), capable of housing up to thirty-two 115 mm bombs.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> To avoid the bomb racks conflicting with operation of the flaps, a small forward extension of the wings was added; another modification was the installation of transparent panels to the sides of the observer's cockpit to aid in the operation of the [[bomb sight]].<ref name = \"bru noe 7\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 7.</ref>\n\nBy mid-1917, French authorities had expressed a high level of confidence in the type in the form of a substantial expansion of the type's production.<ref name = \"bru noe 6 7\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> Various other companies were contracted to manufacture the type.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> On 25 April, French aviation company [[Darracq]] was requested to manufacture 330 aircraft. On 8 June, another 50 were ordered from [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des avions Henri & Maurice Farman]]; on 18 June, [[Paul Schmitt]] was issued a contract to produce 200 aircraft.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> Some of the contractors were unable to commence quantity production of the Br\u00e9guet 14 until 1918.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> Following the war, a handful of aircraft were constructed in French military-owned workshops in [[Indo-China]], albeit these are likely to have been reliant on spare parts.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\"/>\n\nAs an insurance against engine shortages, alternative engines to use in place of the standard Renault powerplant were fitted on some aircraft, both for experimental purposes and in production quantities.<ref name = \"bru noe 8\"/> An improved model of the standard engine, referred to as the Renault 12Ff, appeared in Summer 1918 and was used on some later-built aircraft.<ref name = \"bru noe 8\"/> Another engine adopted was built by French automotive company [[Lorraine-Dietrich]], which was lighter but produced less power than the Renault unit. A number of [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[United States|American]] Br\u00e9guet 14s were outfitted with the [[Fiat A.12]] engine.<ref name = \"bru noe 8 9\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> A number of later-built B2 models were equipped with the U.S.-built [[Liberty engine]]; to distinguish these aircraft, they were denoted as the ''Br\u00e9guet 14 B2 Ls''.<ref name = \"bru noe 9\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 9.</ref>\n\nOther minor variants of the Br\u00e9guet 14 were flown in small numbers during the Great War; these included the 14 B.1 long-range single-seat bomber, the 14 GR.2 long-range reconnaissance, the 14 H [[floatplane]], the 14 S [[air ambulance]] and the 14 Et.2 [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]].<ref name = \"bru noe 10\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 10.</ref> Later variants, such as the 14bis A2 and 14bis B2, featured improved wings. An improved variant equipped with enlarged wings was produced as the [[Br\u00e9guet 16|16]]. Further derivatives of the aircraft included the two-seat fighter [[Br\u00e9guet 17|17]], which would only be built in small numbers due to its late arrival.<ref name = \"bru noe 8\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 8.</ref> Production of the base Br\u00e9guet 14 continued long after the end of the war, finally ending in 1926.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 12.</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Breguet 14 - Front.jpg|thumb|Br\u00e9guet 14 at the Air Service, United States Army Air Service Production Center No. 2, Romorantin Aerodrome, France, 1918]]\nThe Br\u00e9guet 14 was taken on in quantity by the French Air Force. At its peak, the type equipped at least 71 escadrilles of the service, and was deployed on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], where it participated in number major actions in which it typically acquitted itself well.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> For its actions during the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of the Lys]], the ''Section Artillerie Lourde'', equipped with the type, received a [[citation]] and was further lauded for its actions during the Allied counter-attack to the German [[Spring Offensive]]. Om 9 July 1918, Capitaine Paul-Louise Weiller shot down two enemy aircraft during one sortie flying the type.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> Many 14A2 and 14B2s were used in the conflict and were subject to considerable modification, particularly to respond to increasing German opposition to Allied Air operations.<ref name = \"bru noe 7 8\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 7-8.</ref>\n\nFollowing its introduction by the French, during 1918, the Br\u00e9guet 14 was also ordered in quantity by the [[Belgian Army]] (40 aircraft) and the [[United States Army Air Service]] (over 600 aircraft).<ref name = \"bru noe 10 11\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 10-11.</ref> Around half the Belgian and U.S. aircraft were fitted with [[Fiat A.12]] engines due to shortages of the original [[Renault 12F]]. Prior to the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], the Br\u00e9guet 14 was typically assigned to serve in both reconnaissance and bombing roles. By the end of the conflict, the type had reportedly been responsible for dropping a combined total of 1,887,600 kg (or 1,854 tons) of bombs.<ref name = \"bru noe 11\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 11.</ref>\n\nIn one of its more atypical deployments, a Br\u00e9guet 14 played a role in one of the last actions of the war. During November 1918, the aircraft was used to transport a German military officer, Major von Geyer, from [[Tergnier]] and [[Spa]]; it was covered in larger white flags of truce to avoid being engaged.<ref name = \"bru noe 11\"/>\n\nThe type continued to be widely used after the war, equipping the French occupation forces in Germany and being deployed to support French troops in the colonies.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\"/> A special version was developed for the harsh conditions encountered overseas, designated \"14 TOE\" (''Th\u00e9atres des Operations Ext\u00e9rieures''). These saw service in putting down uprisings in [[Syria]] and [[Morocco]], in [[Vietnam]] and in the French intervention in the [[Russian Civil War]]. The last trainer examples were not withdrawn from French military service until 1932.\n\nOther air arms using the type included [[Brazilian Air Force|Brazil]] (30), [[Republic of China Air Force|China]] (70), [[Czech Air Force|Czechoslovakia]] (10), [[Danish Air Force|Denmark]], [[Finnish Air Force|Finland]] (38), [[Greek Air Force|Greece]], [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force|Japan]], the [[Thailand|Siamese Air Force]], Uruguay (9) and [[Spanish Air Force|Spain]]. The [[Polish Air Force]] used 158 Br\u00e9guet 14s, about 70 of them being used in combat in the [[Polish-Soviet war]]. In Japan, Br\u00e9guet 14s were licence-built by [[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]]. The type was also heavily used in various internal wars in China during the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\"/>\n\nWeeks after the signing of the Armistic, the Br\u00e9guet 14 was used to conduct several long distance flights to demonstrate its capabilities.<ref name = \"bru noe 13\"/> On 26 January 1919, a double-crossing of the [[Mediterranean]] was flown using the type by Lt Roget and Captaine Coli. On 5 April, Roget flew from [[Lyon]] to [[Rome]] and then to [[Nice]].<ref name = \"bru noe 13\"/> Roget and Coli later establish a new French long-distance record flying the Br\u00e9guet 14, flying from [[Paris]] to [[Kenitra]], [[Morocco]], a distance of 1,900 km, in 11 hours 15 minutes. Aviation pioneer [[Pierre-Georges Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re]] had one example of the type converted to conduct experimental [[in-flight refuelling]] operations.<ref name = \"bru noe 13 14\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 13-14.</ref>\n[[File:Breguet 14T bis ambulance L'A\u00e9ronautique October 1921.jpg|thumb|Br\u00e9guet 14T bis Sanitaire photo from L'A\u00e9ronautique October 1921]]\nDuring the postwar years, Br\u00e9guet decided to commence manufacture of dedicated civil versions of the Br\u00e9guet 14. The 14 T.2 Salon carried two passengers in a specially modified fuselage. An improved version of this was the 14 Tbis, manufactured as both a land-plane and [[seaplane]].<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200780.html \"1921 Paris Air Salon: Br\u00e9guet 14Tbis.\"] ''Flight'', 24 November 1921.</ref> The 14 Tbis also formed the basis of the improved 14 Tbis Sanitaire air ambulance version, and 100 [[mail plane]]s custom-built for Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re's fledgling airline, [[Lignes Aeriennes Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re]].<ref name = \"bru noe 13\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 13.</ref> After changing its name to \"CGEA\", the airline used, among others, 106 Br\u00e9guet 14s for flights over the [[Sahara]] Desert. The 18 T was a single 14 T re-engined with a [[Renault J]]a engine and equipped to carry four passengers.<ref name = \"bru noe 13\"/> When production finally ceased in 1928, the total of all versions built had reached 7,800 (according to other sources, 8,000 or even 8,370).\n\n==Variants==\nData from:<ref name=\"Davilla\">{{cite book |last1=Davilla |first1=Dr. James J. |last2=Soltan |first2=Arthur M. |title=French aircraft of the First World War |publisher=Flying Machines Press |isbn=1891268090 |pages=101-126}}</ref>\n;Br\u00e9guet AV 1:(Given the STAe designation '''Br\u00e9guet 13''') Company designation of the first aircraft of the Br\u00e9guet 13 / 14 family.

It was built in very large numbers and production continued for many years after the end of the war.\n\nApart from its widespread usage, the Br\u00e9guet 14 is known for being the first mass-produced aircraft to use large amounts of metal, rather than wood, in its structure. This allowed the [[airframe]] to be lighter than a wooden airframe of the same strength, in turn making the aircraft relatively fast and agile for its size; in combat it was able to outrun many contemporary [[fighter aircraft|fighters]]. The Br\u00e9guet 14's strong construction allowed it to sustain considerable damage, in addition to being easy to handle and possessing favourable performance. The type has often been considered to have been one of the best aircraft of the war.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\nThe Br\u00e9guet 14 was designed by aviation pioneer and [[aeronautical engineer]] [[Louis Br\u00e9guet]].<ref name = \"bru noe 3\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 3.</ref> Br\u00e9guet had already built a reputation for producing capable aircraft and advanced aerodynamic test apparatus, including the [[Br\u00e9guet-Richet Gyroplane]], which held the distinction of being the first direct-lift aircraft in the world. Br\u00e9guet had been a pioneer in the field of all-metal construction, which he had employed on a successful series of [[biplane]]s during the pre-war years; these principles were used in the design of the Br\u00e9guet 14.<ref name = \"bru noe 3 4\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 3-4.</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 quickly led to large numbers of Br\u00e9guet-built aircraft being inducted into the military air services of several nations, including many of the nations in the [[Triple Entente]].<ref name = \"bru noe 4\"/> Br\u00e9guet flew as a military pilot early on in the war and soon recognised there was demand for aircraft fitted with more powerful engines to carry worthwhile payloads over anything beyond short distances. For his next design, he opted to abandon his favoured [[tractor configuration]] in favour of a [[pusher configuration]] to better satisfy the inflexible requirements issued by the French general staff, which sought an unobstructed frontal view to benefit the observer.<ref name = \"bru noe 4\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 4.</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 1915, the French Ministry of War held a competition, seeking to determine the most suitable type of aircraft to carry a bombload of 300 lb at a speed of 120 km/h over a minimum distance of 600 km.<ref name = \"bru noe 4\"/> Following an extensive evaluation, Br\u00e9guet's submission to the contest, [[Br\u00e9guet Bre.4|SN-3]]; reportedly, a major reason for its selection over more powerful rivals was its use of the desired pusher configuration. The SN-3 would be developed into the [[Br\u00e9guet Type IV]], V, and VI, which would be built in large quantities for military use.<ref name = \"bru noe 4\"/>\n\n===Origins===\nIn spite of the preference of French officials for the pusher configuration, Br\u00e9guet remained a proponent of tractor aircraft.<ref name = \"bru noe 4 5\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 4-5.</ref> During June 1916, he decided to initiate work on a new design for a military two-seater aircraft, the Br\u00e9guet AV Type XIV. According to aviation authors J. M. Bruce and Jean Noel, the [[French Army]]'s ''Section Technique de l' A\u00e9ronautique'' (S.T.A\u00e9.) received early information on the design and recommended that Br\u00e9guet power it using a 200 hp engine by [[Hispano-Suiza]].<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> Br\u00e9guet found that the engine would be incapable of delivering the desired performance, instead insisting on the adoption of a 12-cylinder [[Renault]]-built engine that had powered the previous Br\u00e9guet Type V.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe Br\u00e9guet Type XIV was both a practical and aesthetically pleasing design.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> A distinctive characteristic of the Type XIV was its rectangular frontal radiator, as well as the shape of is cowling and the negative-stagger of its mainplanes.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> It possessed a sturdy [[landing gear|undercarriage]], along with two-part [[aileron]]s on the upper wing only. On the prototype, the lower wing reportedly featured [[flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] along the [[trailing edge]]s, that partly emulated the manner of operation of [[Aileron#Single acting ailerons|\"single-acting ailerons\"]] in only \"coming up\" from their \"down\" position at rest, as the aircraft accelerated during takeoff; these possessed a limited angle of depression and were not directly controlled by the pilot, instead being actuated by a set of 12 adjustable [[rubber]] [[bungee cord|bungee]] cords.<ref name = \"bru noe 5 6\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 5-6.</ref>\n\nThe airframe was composed primarily of [[duralumin]], invented in Germany by [[Alfred Wilm]] a decade earlier; many sections, such as the duralumin [[longeron]]s and spacers, were attached using [[welding|welded]] [[steel]]-tube fittings and braced using [[piano]] wire. The wing's main [[spar (aeronautics)|spar]] was of rectangular duralumin tubes complete with either [[oak]] or [[ash]] lining-pieces at the attachment points and sheet steel sheaths around the spars.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> The box-unit wooden [[rib]]s had fretted [[plywood]] webs and ash flanges. The surfaces of the tail unit used welded steel tube structures; while the elevators featured horn balances.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> During its design phase, French officials were wary of the Type XIV's structure, having made such an extensive use of the relatively new metal duralumin that it was claimed to be the first aircraft in the world to combine extensive use of the metal with oxy-welded joints.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/>\n\n===Into flight===\nOn 21 November 1916, the first [[prototype]] conducted its [[maiden flight]], flown by Br\u00e9guet.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 6.</ref> The first flight had confirmed Br\u00e9guet's opinion that the Renault engine was more suitable for the type; on 30 November 1916, he informed the S.T.A\u00e9 of this determination and of the comparably worse performance of their recommended engine.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> On 11 January 1917, Br\u00e9guet informed the S.T.A\u00e9 that the prototype had reached the point where he considered it to be representative of production-standard aircraft. Later that month, it participated in further trials and by 7 February 1917, the S.T.A\u00e9 had issued a report declaring that the prototype had attained an air speed of 172 km/h at an altitude of 2,000 meters.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/>\n\nDuring November 1916, the S.T.A\u00e9. had issued its requirements for four new aircraft types. Br\u00e9guet submitted his new design for two of those categories - [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] and [[medium bomber|bomber]]. Following its evaluation during February 1917, the Br\u00e9guet 14 had been accepted to perform both roles. On 22 February 1917, Br\u00e9guet pressed the S.T.A\u00e9 for a production order to be issued for the type; on 2 March, he declared that production [[jig (tool)|jigs]] had been prepared for quantity production of the type.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> On 6 March 1917, the first official production order was received by Br\u00e9guet, calling for 150  ''Br\u00e9guet 14 A.2''; a follow-on order for a further 100 aircraft was received on 4 April.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/>\n\n===Mass production and further development===\nBy March 1917, several orders had been placed, calling for a combined 150 reconnaissance aircraft and 100 bombers \"Br\u00e9guet 14 A.2\" and \"14 B.2\" respectively (in 1918, it was written as ''Br\u00e9guet XIV A2/B2''). The A.2 variant was equipped with an array of [[camera]]s, while some were also provisioned with [[radio]]s, while the lower wing of the 14 B.2 was modified to accommodate bomb racks (built by [[Michelin]]), capable of housing up to thirty-two 115 mm bombs.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> To avoid the bomb racks conflicting with operation of the flaps, a small forward extension of the wings was added; another modification was the installation of transparent panels to the sides of the observer's cockpit to aid in the operation of the [[bomb sight]].<ref name = \"bru noe 7\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 7.</ref>\n\nBy mid-1917, French authorities had expressed a high level of confidence in the type in the form of a substantial expansion of the type's production.<ref name = \"bru noe 6 7\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 6-7.</ref> Various other companies were contracted to manufacture the type.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> On 25 April, French aviation company [[Darracq]] was requested to manufacture 330 aircraft. On 8 June, another 50 were ordered from [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des avions Henri & Maurice Farman]]; on 18 June, [[Paul Schmitt]] was issued a contract to produce 200 aircraft.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> Some of the contractors were unable to commence quantity production of the Br\u00e9guet 14 until 1918.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> Following the war, a handful of aircraft were constructed in French military-owned workshops in [[Indo-China]], albeit these are likely to have been reliant on spare parts.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\"/>\n\nAs an insurance against engine shortages, alternative engines to use in place of the standard Renault powerplant were fitted on some aircraft, both for experimental purposes and in production quantities.<ref name = \"bru noe 8\"/> An improved model of the standard engine, referred to as the Renault 12Ff, appeared in Summer 1918 and was used on some later-built aircraft.<ref name = \"bru noe 8\"/> Another engine adopted was built by French automotive company [[Lorraine-Dietrich]], which was lighter but produced less power than the Renault unit. A number of [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[United States|American]] Br\u00e9guet 14s were outfitted with the [[Fiat A.12]] engine.<ref name = \"bru noe 8 9\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 8-9.</ref> A number of later-built B2 models were equipped with the U.S.-built [[Liberty engine]]; to distinguish these aircraft, they were denoted as the ''Br\u00e9guet 14 B2 Ls''.<ref name = \"bru noe 9\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 9.</ref>\n\nOther minor variants of the Br\u00e9guet 14 were flown in small numbers during the Great War; these included the 14 B.1 long-range single-seat bomber, the 14 GR.2 long-range reconnaissance, the 14 H [[floatplane]], the 14 S [[air ambulance]] and the 14 Et.2 [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]].<ref name = \"bru noe 10\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 10.</ref> Later variants, such as the 14bis A2 and 14bis B2, featured improved wings. An improved variant equipped with enlarged wings was produced as the [[Br\u00e9guet 16|16]]. Further derivatives of the aircraft included the two-seat fighter [[Br\u00e9guet 17|17]], which would only be built in small numbers due to its late arrival.<ref name = \"bru noe 8\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 8.</ref> Production of the base Br\u00e9guet 14 continued long after the end of the war, finally ending in 1926.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 12.</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Breguet 14 - Front.jpg|thumb|Br\u00e9guet 14 at the Air Service, United States Army Air Service Production Center No. 2, Romorantin Aerodrome, France, 1918]]\nThe Br\u00e9guet 14 was taken on in quantity by the French Air Force. At its peak, the type equipped at least 71 escadrilles of the service, and was deployed on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], where it participated in number major actions in which it typically acquitted itself well.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> For its actions during the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of the Lys]], the ''Section Artillerie Lourde'', equipped with the type, received a [[citation]] and was further lauded for its actions during the Allied counter-attack to the German [[Spring Offensive]]. Om 9 July 1918, Capitaine Paul-Louise Weiller shot down two enemy aircraft during one sortie flying the type.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> Many 14A2 and 14B2s were used in the conflict and were subject to considerable modification, particularly to respond to increasing German opposition to Allied Air operations.<ref name = \"bru noe 7 8\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 7-8.</ref>\n\nFollowing its introduction by the French, during 1918, the Br\u00e9guet 14 was also ordered in quantity by the [[Belgian Army]] (40 aircraft) and the [[United States Army Air Service]] (over 600 aircraft).<ref name = \"bru noe 10 11\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 10-11.</ref> Around half the Belgian and U.S. aircraft were fitted with [[Fiat A.12]] engines due to shortages of the original [[Renault 12F]]. Prior to the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], the Br\u00e9guet 14 was typically assigned to serve in both reconnaissance and bombing roles. By the end of the conflict, the type had reportedly been responsible for dropping a combined total of 1,887,600 kg (or 1,854 tons) of bombs.<ref name = \"bru noe 11\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 11.</ref>\n\nIn one of its more atypical deployments, a Br\u00e9guet 14 played a role in one of the last actions of the war. During November 1918, the aircraft was used to transport a German military officer, Major von Geyer, from [[Tergnier]] and [[Spa]]; it was covered in larger white flags of truce to avoid being engaged.<ref name = \"bru noe 11\"/>\n\nThe type continued to be widely used after the war, equipping the French occupation forces in Germany and being deployed to support French troops in the colonies.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\"/> A special version was developed for the harsh conditions encountered overseas, designated \"14 TOE\" (''Th\u00e9atres des Operations Ext\u00e9rieures''). These saw service in putting down uprisings in [[Syria]] and [[Morocco]], in [[Vietnam]] and in the French intervention in the [[Russian Civil War]]. The last trainer examples were not withdrawn from French military service until 1932.\n\nOther air arms using the type included [[Brazilian Air Force|Brazil]] (30), [[Republic of China Air Force|China]] (70), [[Czech Air Force|Czechoslovakia]] (10), [[Danish Air Force|Denmark]], [[Finnish Air Force|Finland]] (38), [[Greek Air Force|Greece]], [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force|Japan]], the [[Thailand|Siamese Air Force]], Uruguay (9) and [[Spanish Air Force|Spain]]. The [[Polish Air Force]] used 158 Br\u00e9guet 14s, about 70 of them being used in combat in the [[Polish-Soviet war]]. In Japan, Br\u00e9guet 14s were licence-built by [[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]]. The type was also heavily used in various internal wars in China during the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\"/>\n\nWeeks after the signing of the Armistic, the Br\u00e9guet 14 was used to conduct several long distance flights to demonstrate its capabilities.<ref name = \"bru noe 13\"/> On 26 January 1919, a double-crossing of the [[Mediterranean]] was flown using the type by Lt Roget and Captaine Coli. On 5 April, Roget flew from [[Lyon]] to [[Rome]] and then to [[Nice]].<ref name = \"bru noe 13\"/> Roget and Coli later establish a new French long-distance record flying the Br\u00e9guet 14, flying from [[Paris]] to [[Kenitra]], [[Morocco]], a distance of 1,900 km, in 11 hours 15 minutes. Aviation pioneer [[Pierre-Georges Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re]] had one example of the type converted to conduct experimental [[in-flight refuelling]] operations.<ref name = \"bru noe 13 14\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 13-14.</ref>\n[[File:Breguet 14T bis ambulance L'A\u00e9ronautique October 1921.jpg|thumb|Br\u00e9guet 14T bis Sanitaire photo from L'A\u00e9ronautique October 1921]]\nDuring the postwar years, Br\u00e9guet decided to commence manufacture of dedicated civil versions of the Br\u00e9guet 14. The 14 T.2 Salon carried two passengers in a specially modified fuselage. An improved version of this was the 14 Tbis, manufactured as both a land-plane and [[seaplane]].<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200780.html \"1921 Paris Air Salon: Br\u00e9guet 14Tbis.\"] ''Flight'', 24 November 1921.</ref> The 14 Tbis also formed the basis of the improved 14 Tbis Sanitaire air ambulance version, and 100 [[mail plane]]s custom-built for Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re's fledgling airline, [[Lignes Aeriennes Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re]].<ref name = \"bru noe 13\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 13.</ref> After changing its name to \"CGEA\", the airline used, among others, 106 Br\u00e9guet 14s for flights over the [[Sahara]] Desert. The 18 T was a single 14 T re-engined with a [[Renault J]]a engine and equipped to carry four passengers.<ref name = \"bru noe 13\"/> When production finally ceased in 1928, the total of all versions built had reached 7,800 (according to other sources, 8,000 or even 8,370).\n\n==Variants==\nData from:<ref name=\"Davilla\">{{cite book |last1=Davilla |first1=Dr. James J. |last2=Soltan |first2=Arthur M. |title=French aircraft of the First World War |publisher=Flying Machines Press |isbn=1891268090 |pages=101-126}}</ref>\n;Br\u00e9guet AV 1:(Given the STAe designation '''Br\u00e9guet 13''') Company designation of the first aircraft of the Br\u00e9guet 13 / 14 family.

Cal Poly had a junior college division from 1927 to 1932.  Miramonte College of Atascadero filled the void as a private institution from 1933 to 1936. The county's second public junior college was formed in 1936 as a part of San Luis Obispo High School District, but ceased operation in June 1959.  On April 16, 1963, voters in SLO County agreed to form a community college district, forming the San Luis Obispo County Junior College District.  In 1964, a limited evening division began at [[Camp San Luis Obispo]], a [[California National Guard]] facility located between San Luis Obispo and [[Morro Bay, CA|Morro Bay]].  On October 4, 1965, the college was officially named Cuesta College.  In 1970, Cuesta broke ground on its current campus west of [[Camp San Luis Obispo]].\n\n== Campus ==\nLocated on [[California State Route 1|State Route 1]], the Cuesta campus is {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} from the beaches of the [[Pacific Ocean]] and {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} from San Luis Obispo (SLO). Cuesta College also has a satellite campus, known as 'North County Campus', located in [[Paso Robles]], which is {{convert|29|mi|km|spell=in}} to the northeast of the main campus near [[San Luis Obispo]]. Limited course offerings are also available at two other sites within the county operated by Cuesta College, one located at Arroyo Grande High School in [[Arroyo Grande]], and the other located at Nipomo High School in [[Nipomo]].\n\n== Organization and administration ==\nCuesta College is the only college in the San Luis Obispo County Community College District (or SLOCCCD, part of the California Community College system) and is accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]]. The district is governed by an elected five-member Board of Trustees.\n\nDr. Jill Stearns, the current president, began her presidency in July 2018 after Dr. [[Gilbert H. Stork]] retired. The gymnasium was renamed Gilbert H. Stork Gymansium in his honor in August 2018.\n\n== Academic profile ==\nThe college offers 76 [[Associate's degree]] programs and 96 certificate programs.  A number of Cuesta students transfer to the public [[California State University]] and [[University of California]] systems, including the nearby [[California Polytechnic State University|Cal Poly SLO]] campus, as well as private colleges and universities.\n\nIn 2012, Cuesta College's regional accreditor [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] placed the college on \"show cause\" status, warning the college that its accreditation might not be renewed.\n\nA year later, the college's accreditation was renewed and its status upgraded to \"on warning.\"  [[The Tribune (San Luis Obispo)|The Tribune]], the local newspaper of San Luis Obispo, described this as the result of a \"years-long struggle to fix several deficiencies identified by the commission <nowiki>[that]</nowiki> came at a cost: lower enrollment, difficulty recruiting applicants and damaged morale.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2013/02/14/2393955/cuesta-college-accreditation.html |title=Cuesta College retains accreditation, officials announce |author=Tonya Strickland |publisher=[[The Tribune (San Luis Obispo)|The Tribune]] |date=February 14, 2013 |accessdate=February 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2014, it was announced that Cuesta's \"on warning\" status was removed, and that the school meets all standards for accreditation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2014/02/10/2918229/cuesta-college-accreditation.html |title=Cuesta College's accreditation is reaffirmed, sanctions dropped |author=AnnMarie Cornejo |publisher=[[The Tribune (San Luis Obispo)|The Tribune]] |date=February 10, 2014 |accessdate=December 15, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Athletics ==\nThe college's athletic teams are known as the Cougars and the school colors are green and white.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}.

accessible to users with any level of expertise, the seamless integration of SkyDrive Pro into the Office 2013 desktop applications, and the service as a whole for being suitable in small business environments, while still offering \"powerful\" options for use in larger companies (such as [[Data loss prevention software|data loss protection]] and the ability to integrate with a local [[Active Directory]] instance). However, the service was severely criticized for how it handled its 2013 update for existing users, and its lack of integration with services such as [[Skype]] and [[Yammer]].<ref

An Office 365 Group can be organized in Outlook, SharePoint Online, Yammer, Microsoft Teams and other collaboration tools to diversify the native collaboration capabilities of these applications. For example, if a team collaborates in a Group in Yammer, its members automatically get a team calendar, a shared Outlook inbox, a SharePoint library, a SharePoint team site, a shared OneNote notebook and Planner.\n\n===Updates===\nThe Office 365 platform uses a [[rolling release]] model; updates to the online components of the service are provided once per quarter.

accessible to users with any level of expertise, the seamless integration of SkyDrive Pro into the Office 2013 desktop applications, and the service as a whole for being suitable in small business environments, while still offering \"powerful\" options for use in larger companies (such as [[Data loss prevention software|data loss protection]] and the ability to integrate with a local [[Active Directory]] instance). However, the service was severely criticized for how it handled its 2013 update for existing users, and its lack of integration with services such as [[Skype]] and [[Yammer]].<ref name=techradar-365review/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2010/oct10/10-19Office365.mspx\n  |title = Microsoft Announces Office 365\n  |work = Microsoft News Center\n  |publisher = [[Microsoft Corporation]]\n  |date = October 19, 2010\n  |accessdate =October 25, 2010\n  |location = Redmond, WA\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20020029-56.html\n  |title = Microsoft Office 365 bets on the cloud\n  |work = [[CNET News]]\n  |publisher = [[CBS Interactive]]\n  |date = October 19, 2010\n  |accessdate =October 25, 2010\n  |first = Ina\n  |last = Fried\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.cloudhypermarket.com/services/productivity/microsoft-office-365\n  |title = Microsoft unveils Microsoft Office 365\n  |work = Cloud Hypermarket\n  |publisher = Hypermarket Ventures Ltd.\n  |date = October 19, 2010\n  |accessdate =January 24, 2011\n  |first = Andrew\n  |last = Gradwell\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.infoworld.com/t/desktop-productivity/what-office-365-says-about-microsoft-736\n  |title = What Office 365 says about Microsoft\n  |work = [[InfoWorld]]\n  |publisher = Infoworld, Inc.\n  |date = October 25, 2010\n  |accessdate =October 25, 2010\n  |first = Eric\n  |last = Knor\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.infoworld.com/d/applications/microsoft-unveils-office-365-cloud-platform-146\n  |title = Microsoft unveils Office 365 cloud platform\n  |work = [[InfoWorld]]\n  |publisher = Infoworld, Inc.\n  |date = October 19, 2010\n  |accessdate =October 25, 2010\n  |first = Paul\n  |last = Krill\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Cloud-Computing/Microsoft-Office-365-Profiled-at-Gartner-Conference-776455/\n  |title = Microsoft Office 365 Profiled at Gartner Conference\n  |work = [[eWeek]]\n  |publisher = Ziff Davis Enterprise Holdings Inc.\n  |date = October 20, 2010\n  |accessdate =October 25, 2010\n  |first = Nicholas\n  |last = Kolakowski\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Windows/Office-365-Ozzie-Departure-Ballmer-Tablet-Talk-Marked-Microsoft-Week-224674/\n  |title = Office 365, Ozzie Departure, Ballmer Tablet Talk Marked Microsoft Week\n  |work = [[eWeek]]\n  |publisher = Ziff Davis Enterprise Holdings Inc.\n  |date = October 24, 2010\n  |accessdate =October 25, 2010\n  |first = Nicholas\n  |last = Kolakowski\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9191783/Microsoft_launches_Office_365_makes_cloud_move?source=rss_news\n  |title = Microsoft launches Office 365, makes cloud move\n  |work = [[Computerworld]]\n  |publisher = Computerworld Inc.\n  |date = October 19, 2010\n  |accessdate =October 25, 2010\n  |first = Juan Carlos\n  |last = Perez\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/19/microsoft-rolls-up-cloud-services-into-office-365-takes-aim-at-google-apps/\n  |title = Microsoft Rolls Up Cloud Services Into Office 365, Takes Aim At Google Apps\n  |work = [[TechCrunch]]\n  |date = October 19, 2010\n  |accessdate =October 25, 2010\n  |first = Jason\n  |last = Kincaid\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.zdnet.com/blog/igeneration/microsoft-admits-patriot-act-can-access-eu-based-cloud-data/11225\n  |title = Microsoft admits Patriot Act can access EU-based cloud data\n  |work = ZDNet\n  |date = June 28, 2011\n  |accessdate =August 15, 2011\n  |first = Zack\n  |last = Whittaker\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.netzwelt.de/news/87930-anleitung-eigene-domain-microsoft-office-365-konfigurieren.html\n  |title = Adding Domains in Microsoft Office 365\n  |work = Netzwelt\n  |date = August 17, 2011\n  |accessdate =September 12, 2011\n  |first = Markus\n  |last = Franz\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://onlinehelp.microsoft.com/office365-enterprises/ff652556.aspx \n  |title = Prepare for email migration or Exchange hybrid deployment in office 365\n  |work = Netzwelt\n  |date = August 17, 2011\n  |accessdate =September 12, 2011\n  |first = Markus\n  |last = Franz\n  }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website}}\n\n{{Microsoft}}\n{{Microsoft Office}}\n\n[[Category:Microsoft cloud services]]\n[[Category:Microsoft Office|365]]\n[[Category:Office 365| ]]\n[[Category:Subscription services]]\n", "name_user": "SanyaDuggal", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added most recent information", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_365"}

{"title_page": "87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), CEF", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n{{No footnotes|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n[[File:87th Battalion Distinguishing patches.gif|thumb|87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) Distinguishing patches for 4th Division, 11th Brigade CEF.]]\nThe '''87th Battalion ([[The Canadian Grenadier Guards|Canadian Grenadier Guards]]), CEF''' was a Household Foot Guards Infantry unit in the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] during the [[World War I|First World War]]. Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized on September 15, 1915, as an exclusively Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began on October 23, 1915.   \n  \nMore than 4,213 men served in the 87th Battalion, representing all regions of Canada, but predominantly Ontario, until&nbsp; the last few months of the&nbsp; war&nbsp; when the balance was furnished by soldiers from Quebec (included the need to form a&nbsp; francophone coy.) The Battalion earned 17  Battle Honours at a cost&nbsp; of 886 dead & 2,246 wounded, many of them wounded multiple times.  \n[[File:87th Battalion badges.jpg|thumb|Badges of the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF - Hayes-Rivet (MHR) collection]]\n\n== Unit distinctions & achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n* CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.\n* The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada. The other 2 were the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].\n* The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War. The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77th Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF. The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4th and 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF, but these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.\n* Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by [[King George V]] in 1919 as a permanent distinction in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n* 87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918. Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced and indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning August 18, 1916 in the Ypres area. Their first casualties, two wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 36 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n===  Battle of the Somme ===\nOn 10 October, 1916, the 87th Battalion was relocated to Albert area along the Ancre area and on the 21 October, attacked and took a section of Regina Trench. The first gallantry awards earned by the 87th Battalion were awarded to four members for the attack on Regina Trench, CSM W. Blaney, Sgt. J.C. Noon, Ptes J.E. Blaney, and J.D. Hunter. After some routine activities and tours along the front, on November 18, the 87th Battalion was assigned to capture a section of Desire Trench, as well as its support systems. The attack was launched from Regina Trench. It succeeded well beyond expectations, and in addition to capturing Desire, Major Franklin Hall, with 41 volunteers, with only their rifles, bayonets, grenades and 2 Lewis Guns advanced a further 500 yards and captured part of Grandcourt Trench, including taking 115 prisoners. 80 of these were taken unaided by four privates; Roy, Thompson, Garneau and Winke.  \n[[File:Plan of Attack Vimy Ridge.jpg|thumb|87th Battalion was to advance as part of the 11th Brigage, 4th Division. (2nd from top) Plan of Attack for Vimy Ridge 9 April 1917]]\n\n=== Battle of Vimy Ridge ===\nThe Battle of Vimy Ridge was a terrible tragedy for the battalion. Progress on the right was slow because, for a time and in part, the centre had practically collapsed.The 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) were in the first wave but for some reason, a section of enemy trench barely a hundred metres in front of them had been left untouched by the artillery bombardment. (it has been suggested that the 87th Battalion commanding officer, Major Harold Leroy Shaw wanted to use it as a first-aid station and battalion headquarters later on.) Subsequently,the company assaulting it was virtually wiped out in just six minutes, and \u2018sixty per cent of its strength lay dead on the ground.\u2019It was not a good beginning, delaying the other guardsmen so that they lost the barrage, and those who tried to continue the advance were cut down by German machine gunners firing from positions of relative safety in the untouched trenches.   \n\nThe 87th Battalion War diaries reports that six of the seven officers leading the 87th into battle were killed or wounded within the first hours. \"Word had been received that Captain Harry Sare, (Officer Commanding the Assault), had been shot through the head with a bullet and could no longer carry on. Lieutenant Yonkles had also been hit in the left arm, Majors Joy and Ross and Lieut. Savage had been killed, and Lieut. Sinclair badly wounded, leaving Lieutenant Hannaford the only available officer of those who went over.\" The 87th diary names 11 officers killed or wounded and notes 110 other ranks killed, 157 wounded and 25 missing.    \n\n==Officers Commanding==\n*Lieut.-Col.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized on September 15, 1915, as an exclusively Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began on October 23, 1915.   \n  \nMore than 4,213 men served in the 87th Battalion, representing all regions of Canada, but predominantly Ontario, until&nbsp; the last few months of the&nbsp; war&nbsp; when the balance was furnished by soldiers from Quebec (included the need to form a&nbsp; francophone coy.) The Battalion earned 17  Battle Honours at a cost&nbsp; of 886 dead & 2,246 wounded, many of them wounded multiple times.  \n[[File:87th Battalion badges.jpg|thumb|Badges of the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF - Hayes-Rivet (MHR) collection]]\n\n== Unit distinctions & achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n* CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.\n* The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada. The other 2 were the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].\n* The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War. The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77th Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF. The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4th and 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF, but these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.\n* Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by [[King George V]] in 1919 as a permanent distinction in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n* 87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918. Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced and indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning August 18, 1916 in the Ypres area. Their first casualties, two wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 36 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n===  Battle of the Somme ===\nOn 10 October, 1916, the 87th Battalion was relocated to Albert area along the Ancre area and on the 21 October, attacked and took a section of Regina Trench. The first gallantry awards earned by the 87th Battalion were awarded to four members for the attack on Regina Trench, CSM W. Blaney, Sgt. J.C. Noon, Ptes J.E. Blaney, and J.D. Hunter. After some routine activities and tours along the front, on November 18, the 87th Battalion was assigned to capture a section of Desire Trench, as well as its support systems. The attack was launched from Regina Trench. It succeeded well beyond expectations, and in addition to capturing Desire, Major Franklin Hall, with 41 volunteers, with only their rifles, bayonets, grenades and 2 Lewis Guns advanced a further 500 yards and captured part of Grandcourt Trench, including taking 115 prisoners. 80 of these were taken unaided by four privates; Roy, Thompson, Garneau and Winke.  \n[[File:Plan of Attack Vimy Ridge.jpg|thumb|87th Battalion was to advance as part of the 11th Brigage, 4th Division. (2nd from top) Plan of Attack for Vimy Ridge 9 April 1917]]\n\n=== Battle of Vimy Ridge ===\nThe Battle of Vimy Ridge was a terrible tragedy for the battalion. Progress on the right was slow because, for a time and in part, the centre had practically collapsed.The 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) were in the first wave but for some reason, a section of enemy trench barely a hundred metres in front of them had been left untouched by the artillery bombardment. (it has been suggested that the 87th Battalion commanding officer, Major Harold Leroy Shaw wanted to use it as a first-aid station and battalion headquarters later on.) Subsequently,the company assaulting it was virtually wiped out in just six minutes, and \u2018sixty per cent of its strength lay dead on the ground.\u2019It was not a good beginning, delaying the other guardsmen so that they lost the barrage, and those who tried to continue the advance were cut down by German machine gunners firing from positions of relative safety in the untouched trenches.   \n\nThe 87th Battalion War diaries reports that six of the seven officers leading the 87th into battle were killed or wounded within the first hours. \"Word had been received that Captain Harry Sare, (Officer Commanding the Assault), had been shot through the head with a bullet and could no longer carry on. Lieutenant Yonkles had also been hit in the left arm, Majors Joy and Ross and Lieut. Savage had been killed, and Lieut. Sinclair badly wounded, leaving Lieutenant Hannaford the only available officer of those who went over.\" The 87th diary names 11 officers killed or wounded and notes 110 other ranks killed, 157 wounded and 25 missing.    \n\n==Officers Commanding==\n*Lieut.-Col.
