These were not exclusive schools, and temples were apt to have scholars versed in several of the schools. It has been suggested that they can best be thought of as \"study groups\". The Buddhism of these periods, known as the [[Asuka period]] and [[Nara period]] \u2013 was not a practical religion, being more the domain of learned priests whose official function was to pray for the peace and prosperity of the state and imperial house. This kind of Buddhism had little to offer to the illiterate and uneducated masses and led to the growth of \"people\u2019s priests\" who were not ordained and had no formal Buddhist training. Their practice was a combination of Buddhist and [[Taoism|Daoist]] elements and the incorporation of [[shamanism|shamanistic]] features of indigenous practices. Some of these figures became immensely popular and were a source of criticism towards the sophisticated academic and bureaucratic Buddhism of the capital.\n\n====Tangmi====\nThe Late Nara period saw the introduction of [[Tangmi]] ([[Vajrayana|Esoteric Buddhism]], Japanese ''mikky\u014d'') to Japan from China by [[K\u016bkai]] and [[Saich\u014d]], who founded [[Shingon Buddhism]] and the [[Tendai]] school, respectively.\n\n===Heian Period (794 to 1185)===\n[[File:Byodo-in Uji01pbs2640.jpg|thumb|250px|[[By\u014dd\u014d-in]] (Pure Land sect), located in [[Uji, Kyoto]]]]\nDuring the Heian period the capital was shifted from Nara to Kyoto.

In 1185 the [[Kamakura shogunate]] was established at [[Kamakura]].{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=181}}\n\nThis period saw the introduction of the two schools that had perhaps the greatest impact on the country: the schools of [[Pure Land Buddhism]], promulgated by evangelists such as [[Genshin]] and articulated by monks such as [[H\u014dnen]], which emphasize salvation through faith in [[Amit\u0101bha]] and remain the largest Buddhist sect in Japan (and throughout Asia); and [[Zen]], promulgated by monks such as [[Eisai]] and [[D\u014dgen]], which emphasize liberation through the insight of meditation, which were equally rapidly adopted by the upper classes and had a profound impact on the [[culture of Japan]].\n\nAdditionally, it was during the Kamakura period that the influential monk [[Nichiren]] began teaching devotion to the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]''. Eventually, his disciples formed their own school of [[Nichiren Buddhism]], which includes various sects that have their own interpretations of Nichiren's teachings. Nichiren Buddhism established the foundation of Japanese Buddhism in the thirteenth century. The school is known for its sociopolitical activism and looks to reform society through faith.<ref>Cathy Cantwell and Hiroko Kawanami, \"Buddhism.\" Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations, Third Edition.

The only exception was the [[\u014cbaku]] lineage, which was introduced in the 17th century during the [[Edo period]] by [[Ingen]], a Chinese monk. Ingen had been a member of the [[Linji school]], the Chinese equivalent of Rinzai, which had developed separately from the Japanese branch for hundreds of years. Thus, when Ingen journeyed to Japan following the fall of the [[Ming dynasty]] to the [[Manchu people]], his teachings were seen as a separate school. The \u014cbaku school was named after [[Mount Huangbo]] ({{cjkv|c=\u9ec4\u6a97\u5c71|p=Hu\u00e1ngb\u00f2 sh\u0101n|r=\u014cbaku san}}), which had been Ingen's home in China.

Madhyamaka is one of the two most important [[Mahayana]] philosophies, and reemphasizes the original Buddhist teachings that phenomena are neither truly existent or absolutely non-existent, but are characterized by impermanence and insubstantiality.\n\n====Kegon====\n[[File:Todaiji18s3200.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[T\u014ddai-ji]], the head temple of the Kegon school]]\n736: [[Bodhisena]] introduces the Kegon (Huayan or Avata\u1e43saka) school to Japan. The Kegon school was founded by {{nihongo|[[Dushun]]|\u675c\u9806|Dojun}} c. 600 and was introduced to Japan by the Indian monk [[Bodhisena]] in 736. The ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra]]'' (''Kegon-ky\u014d'' \u83ef\u53b3\u7d4c) is the central text for the Kegon school. The ''[[Shin'yaku Kegonky\u014d Ongi Shiki]]'' is an early Japanese annotation of this s\u016btra.\n\n====Rissh\u016b====\n753: [[Jianzhen]]  ({{zh|c=\u9451\u771f}}) introduces the [[Rissh\u016b (Buddhism)|Rissh\u016b]] (Ritsu or [[vinaya]] school) to Japan.\nFounded by [[Daoxuan]] (\u9053\u5ba3, Jp. ''Dosen''), China, c. 650 <br />\nFirst Introduction to Japan: Jianzhen, 753. The Ritsu school specialized in the Vinaya (the monastic rules in the Tripitaka). They used the Dharmagupta version of the vinaya which is known in Japanese as ''Shibunritsu'' (\u56db\u5206\u5f8b)\n\n====Kusha-sh\u016b====\nThe {{nihongo|Kusha-sh\u016b|{{linktext|\u5036|\u820e|\u5b97}}}} was one of the six schools of Buddhism introduced to Japan during the [[Asuka period|Asuka]] and [[Nara period]]s.{{sfn|Lopez|2013|p=574}} Along with the {{nihongo|[[Tattvasiddhi]] school| |J\u014djitsu-sh\u016b}} and the [[Rissh\u016b (Buddhism)|Rissh\u016b]], it is a school of [[Nikaya Buddhism]], which is sometimes derisively known to [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] as \"the [[Hinayana]]\".\n\nA [[Sarvastivada]] school,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/325472/Kusha|title=Kusha|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> Kusha-sh\u016b focussed on [[abhidharma]] analysis based on the {{nihongo|\"Commentary on the ''[[Abhidharmako\u015bak\u0101rik\u0101|Abhidharmako\u015babha\u1e63ya]]''\"|\u5036\u820e\u8ad6}} by the fourth-century [[Gandhara]]n philosopher [[Vasubandhu]]. The school takes its name from that authoritative text.{{sfn|Lopez|2013|p=574}}\n\n===Esoteric Schools===\n====Tendai====\n807: [[Saich\u014d]] introduces the [[Tendai]] ([[Tiantai]]) school to Japan.\nKnown as [[Tiantai]] (\u5929\u53f0) in China, the Tendai school was founded by [[Zhiyi]] (\u667a\u9857, Jp ''Chigi'') in China, c. 550. In 804 [[Saich\u014d]] (\u6700\u6f84) traveled to China to study at the Tiantai teachings, at Mount Tiantai. However, before his return he also studied, and was initiated into, the practice of the Vajrayana, with emphasis on the Mahavairocana Sutra. The primary text of Tiantai is Lotus Sutra (''Hokke-ky\u014d'' \u6cd5\u83ef\u7d4c), but when Saich\u014d established his school in Japan he incorporated the study and practice of Vajrayana as well. Although the studies of the Lotus Sutra and Mahayana Nirvana Sutra where also very vital to the schools as well.  These schools developed in the Middle Ages and were influenced by the Tientai, Chinese schools of the sixth century.\n<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Woodhead |editor1-first=Linda |editor2-last=Partridge |editor2-first=Christopher |editor3-last=Kawanami |editor3-first=Hiroko |title=Religion in the Modern World |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge Taylor and Francis Group |pages=82}}</ref>\n\n====Shingon Buddhism====\n816: [[K\u016bkai]] founds {{Nihongo|[[Shingon Buddhism]]|\u771f\u8a00\u5b97|Shingon-sh\u016b}}. One of the major schools of Buddhism in Japan today and one of the few surviving [[Vajrayana]] lineages in East Asia, it originally spread from India to China through traveling monks such as [[Vajrabodhi]] and [[Amoghavajra]]. Known in Chinese as the [[Tangmi]], these esoteric teachings would flourish in Japan under the auspices of a [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] named {{nihongo|[[K\u016bkai]]|\u7a7a\u6d77}}, who traveled to [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]] in 804 as part of the same expedition as Saich\u014d. In the capital he studied Tangmi and [[Sanskrit]] and received initiation from [[Huiguo]]. On returning to Japan, K\u016bkai eventually managed to establish Shingon as a school in its own right. K\u016bkai received two lineages of teaching\u2014one based on the {{nihongo|''[[Mahavairocana Tantra]]''|\u5927\u65e5\u7d4c|Dainichiky\u014d}} and the other based on the {{nihongo|''[[Vajrasekhara Sutra]]''|\u91d1\u525b\u9802\u7d4c|Kong\u014dch\u014dky\u014d}}.\n\nThe word \"Shingon\" is the [[Kan-on|Japanese pronunciation of]] ''Zh\u0113ny\u00e1n'' \"True Words\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Zh\u0113ny\u00e1n|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3424503431/zhenyan.html}}</ref> which in turn is the Chinese translation of the Sanskrit word \"[[mantra]]\".<ref name=\"Kiyota 1987\">{{cite journal|last=Kiyota |first=Minoru |title=Shingon Mikky\u014d's Twofold Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala: Paradoxes and Integration |journal=Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies |year=1987 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=91\u201392 |url=http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8710/2617 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125214858/http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8710/2617 |archivedate=January 25, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Kamakura Buddhism===\n====Amida (Pure Land) Schools====\n1175: [[H\u014dnen]] introduces [[Pure Land Buddhism]] to Japan.\n\n=====J\u014ddo-sh\u016b=====\n[[File:Chionin31n3200.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[Chion-in]], the highest temple of [[J\u014ddo-sh\u016b]].]]\n[[J\u014ddo-sh\u016b]] was founded by [[H\u014dnen]] (\u6cd5\u7136), 1175<br />\nJapanese name: \u6d44\u571f, \"Pure Land\"<br />\nMajor Influences: Chinese Jingtu Zong (\u51c0\u571f\u5b97 \"Pure Land school\"), Tendai<br />\nDoctrine: ''[[Nianfo]]''<br />\nPrimary Text: ''[[Longer Sukh\u0101vat\u012bvy\u016bha S\u016btra]]'' (''Mury\u014dju-ky\u014d'' \u7121\u91cf\u58fd\u7d4c)\n\n=====J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b=====\n[[J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b]] was founded by [[Shinran]] (\u89aa\u9e1e), 1224<br />\nJapanese name: \u6d44\u571f\u771f, \"True Pure Land\"<br />\nMajor Influences: [[J\u014ddo-sh\u016b]], Tendai<br />\nDoctrine: ''nembutsu no shinjin'' (\"nianfo of true entrusting\", that is, saying nianfo is a declaration of faith in Amida's salvation plan for the individual rather than a plan for salvation.)<br />\nPrimary Text: ''[[Longer Sukh\u0101vat\u012bvy\u016bha S\u016btra]]'' (''Mury\u014dju-ky\u014d'' \u7121\u91cf\u58fd\u7d4c)\n\n=====Ji-sh\u016b=====\n[[Buddhism in Japan#Ji-sh\u016b|Ji-sh\u016b]] was founded by [[Ippen]] (\u4e00\u904d), 1270<br />\nJapanese name: \u6642\u5b97 or \u6642\u8846, \"Time\"<br />\nMajor Influences: [[J\u014ddo-sh\u016b]]<br />\nDoctrine: [[nianfo|Nembutsu]]<br />\nPrimary Text:\n\n=====Y\u016bz\u016b-Nembutsu School=====\nThe [[Yuzu Nembutsu|Y\u016bz\u016b-Nembutsu]] school was founded by Ry\u014dnin (\u826f\u5fcd), 1117<br />\nJapanese name: \u878d\u901a\u5ff5\u4ecf<br />\nDoctrine: ''sokushitsu \u014dj\u014d'' (\u901f\u75be\u5f80\u751f,)<br />\nPrimary Text: ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra]]'' (''Kegon-ky\u014d'' \u83ef\u53b3\u7d4c)\u30fbLotus Sutra (''Hokke-ky\u014d'' \u6cd5\u83ef\u7d4c)\n\n====Zen Schools====\nSeveral variants of [[Zen]]'s practice and experiential wisdom (\u7985\u5b97) were separately brought to Japan.

The [[Fuju-fuse|Nichiren Fuju-fuse-ha]] sub-sect of Nichiren Buddhism was abolished in 1669 and legalised again in 1876.<br/>\nToday's Nichiren Buddhism is represented by traditional-oriented schools such as [[Honmon Butsury\u016b-sh\u016b]], [[Nichiren-sh\u016b]] and [[Nichiren Sh\u014dsh\u016b]] and more recent movements like the [[Soka Gakkai]], [[Rissh\u014d K\u014dsei Kai]], [[Reiy\u016bkai]] and [[Nipponzan-My\u014dh\u014dji-Daisanga]].

Buddhist institutions were used by the shogunate to control the country. During the Edo (1600\u20131868) this power was constricted, to be followed by persecutions at the beginning of the [[Meiji restoration]] (1868\u20131912).{{sfn|Snelling|1987}} Buddhist temples played a major administrative role during the Edo period, through the [[Danka system|Danka]] or ''terauke'' system. In this, Japanese citizens were required to register at their local Buddhist temples and obtain a certification (''terauke''), which became necessary to function in society. At first, this system was put into place to suppress Christianity, but over time it took on the larger role of census and population control.\n\n===Artistic influence===\n[[File:WindGods.JPG|thumb|350px|Iconographical evolution of the Wind God.<br/>\nLeft: Greek wind god from [[Hadda, Afghanistan]], second century.<br />\nMiddle: wind god from [[Kizil Caves]], [[Tarim Basin]], 7th century.<br />\nRight: Japanese wind god [[F\u016bjin]], 17th century.]]\nIn Japan, Buddhist art started to develop as the country converted to Buddhism in 548. Some tiles from the [[Asuka period]] (shown above), the first period following the conversion of the country to Buddhism, display a strikingly classical style, with ample Hellenistic dress and realistically rendered body shape characteristic of [[Greco-Buddhist art]].\n\nBuddhist art became extremely varied in its expression. Many elements of Greco-Buddhist art remain to this day however, such as the [[Hercules]] inspiration behind the [[Nio]] guardian deities in front of Japanese Buddhist temples, or representations of the Buddha reminiscent of Greek art such as the Buddha in [[Kamakura]].{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Katsumi Tanabe: \"Needless to say, the influence of Greek art on Japanese Buddhist art, via the Buddhist art of Gandhara and India, was already partly known in, for example, the comparison of the wavy drapery of the Buddha images, in what was, originally, a typical Greek style\" (Katsumi Tanabe, \"Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan\", p. 19)}}\n\n====Deities====\n[[File:Heracles-Shukongoshin.JPG|thumb|350px|Iconographical evolution from the Greek god [[Heracles]] to the Japanese god Shukong\u014dshin. From left to right:<br />\n1) Heracles (Louvre Museum).<br />\n2) Heracles on coin of [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius I]].<br />\n3) [[Vajrapani]], the protector of the Buddha, depicted as Heracles in the Greco-Buddhist art of [[Gandhara]].<br />\n4) [[Nio|Shukong\u014dshin]], manifestation of [[Vajrapani]], as protector deity of Buddhist temples in Japan.]]\nVarious other Greco-Buddhist artistic influences can be found in the Japanese Buddhist pantheon, the most striking being that of the Japanese wind god [[F\u016bjin]]. In consistency with Greek iconography for the wind god [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]], the Japanese wind god holds above his head with his two hands a draping or \"wind bag\" in the same general attitude.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|>Katusmi Tanabe: \"The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins. (...) One of the characteristics of these Far Eastern wind god images is the wind bag held by this god with both hands, the origin of which can be traced back to the shawl or mantle worn by [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]/ Oado.\" (Katsumi Tanabe, \"Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan\", p. 21)}} The abundance of hair has been kept in the Japanese rendering, as well as exaggerated facial features.\n\nAnother Buddhist deity, Shukong\u014dshin, one of the wrath-filled protector deities of Buddhist temples in Japan, is also an interesting case of transmission of the image of the famous Greek god Heracles to East Asia along the [[Silk Road]]. Heracles was used in Greco-Buddhist art to represent [[Vajrapani]], the protector of the Buddha, and his representation was then used in China and Japan to depict the protector gods of Buddhist temples.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Katsumi Tanabe: \"The origin of the image of Vajrapani should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modelled after that of Hercules. (...) The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterwards transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardian Deities ([[Nio]]).\" (Katsumi Tanabe, \"Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan\", p. 23)}}\n\n====Artistic motifs====\n[[File:NaraVines&Grapes.JPG|thumb|200px|Vine and grape scrolls from Nara, 7th century.]]\nThe artistic inspiration from Greek floral scrolls is found quite literally in the decoration of Japanese roof tiles, one of the only remaining element of wooden architecture throughout centuries. The clearest ones are from the 7th century Nara temple building tiles, some of them exactly depicting vines and grapes. These motifs have evolved towards more symbolic representations, but essentially remain to this day in many Japanese traditional buildings.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The transmission of the floral scroll pattern from West to East is presented in the regular exhibition of Ancient Japanese Art, at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].}}\n\n===Temples===\n{{main|List of National Treasures of Japan (temples)}}\n[[Soga no Umako]] built H\u014dk\u014d-ji, the first temple in Japan, between 588 to 596. It was later renamed as [[Asuka-dera]] for [[Asuka, Yamato|Asuka]], the name of the capital where it was located. Unlike early [[Shinto shrine]]s, early [[Buddhist temple]]s were highly ornamental and strictly symmetrical. The early [[Heian period]] (9th\u201310th century) saw an evolution of style based on the [[mikky\u014d]] sects Tendai and [[Shingon Buddhism]]. The [[Daibutsuy\u014d]] style and the [[Zensh\u016by\u014d]] style emerged in the late 12th or early 13th century.\n\n==Buddhist holidays==\n\n===Obon (\u304a\u76c6)===\nAlthough its date and practices vary region to region, the [[Bon Festival]] is celebrated primarily in Japan and in communities with large Japanese diaspora communities. It is believed that the spirits of the dead return to earth for three days and visit the family shrines or graves. It is customary to clean the graves and to hold [[family reunion]]s.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Buddhist deities]]\n*[[Buddhist modernism]]\n*[[Buddhist philosophy]]\n*[[History of Buddhism]]\n*[[Ichibata Yakushi Kyodan]]\n* [[Japanese Buddhist pantheon]]\n*[[Kaich\u014d]]\n*[[Kanjin]]\n*[[Nara National Museum]]\n*[[Religion in Japan]]\n*[[Shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d]]\n*''[[Zen at War]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert|authorlink1=Robert Buswell Jr.|last2=Lopez|first2=Donald S.|authorlink2=Donald S.

These contacts occurred with the opening of the [[Silk Road]] in the 2nd century BCE, following the travels of [[Zhang Qian]] between 138 and 126 BCE. These contacts culminated with the official introduction of Buddhism in China in 67 CE.

As time progressed and the number of Buddhist clergy increased, the offices of ''S\u014dj\u014d'' (archbishop) and ''S\u014dzu'' (bishop) were created. By 627, there were 46 Buddhist temples, 816 Buddhist priests, and 569 Buddhist nuns in Japan.\n\n====Six sects====\nThe initial period saw the six great Chinese schools, called {{nihongo|Nanto Rokush\u016b|\u5357\u90fd\u516d\u5b97|lit. the Six Nara Sects}} in Japanese were introduced to the [[Japanese archipelago]]:\n# ''[[Rissh\u016b (Buddhism)|Ritsu]]'' ([[Vinaya]]-focused [[Nikaya Buddhism]])\n# ''J\u014djitsu'' ([[Tattvasiddhi]], a sect of Nikaya Buddhism)\n# ''[[Kusha-sh\u016b]]'' ([[Abhidharma]]-focused Nikaya Buddhism)\n# ''Sanronsh\u016b'' ([[East Asian M\u0101dhyamaka]])\n# ''Hoss\u014d'' ([[East Asian Yog\u0101c\u0101ra]])\n# ''[[Kegon]]'' ([[Huayan]])<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| last = Powers| first = John| title = Japanese Buddhism| encyclopedia = A Concise Encyclopedia of Buddhism| volume = 1| pages = 103\u2013107| publisher = Oneworld Publications| location = Oxford| year = 2000}}</ref>\n\nThese schools were centered around the ancient capitals of [[Asuka, Nara|Asuka]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], where great temples such as the [[Asuka-dera]] and [[T\u014ddai-ji]] were erected respectively. These were not exclusive schools, and temples were apt to have scholars versed in several of the schools. It has been suggested that they can best be thought of as \"study groups\". The Buddhism of these periods, known as the [[Asuka period]] and [[Nara period]] \u2013 was not a practical religion, being more the domain of learned priests whose official function was to pray for the peace and prosperity of the state and imperial house. This kind of Buddhism had little to offer to the illiterate and uneducated masses and led to the growth of \"people\u2019s priests\" who were not ordained and had no formal Buddhist training. Their practice was a combination of Buddhist and [[Taoism|Daoist]] elements and the incorporation of [[shamanism|shamanistic]] features of indigenous practices. Some of these figures became immensely popular and were a source of criticism towards the sophisticated academic and bureaucratic Buddhism of the capital.\n\n====Tangmi====\nThe Late Nara period saw the introduction of [[Tangmi]] ([[Vajrayana|Esoteric Buddhism]], Japanese ''mikky\u014d'') to Japan from China by [[K\u016bkai]] and [[Saich\u014d]], who founded [[Shingon Buddhism]] and the [[Tendai]] school, respectively.\n\n===Heian Period (794 to 1185)===\n[[File:Byodo-in Uji01pbs2640.jpg|thumb|250px|[[By\u014dd\u014d-in]] (Pure Land sect), located in [[Uji, Kyoto]]]]\nDuring the Heian period the capital was shifted from Nara to Kyoto.

In 1185 the [[Kamakura shogunate]] was established at [[Kamakura]].{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=181}}\n\nThis period saw the introduction of the two schools that had perhaps the greatest impact on the country: the schools of [[Pure Land Buddhism]], promulgated by evangelists such as [[Genshin]] and articulated by monks such as [[H\u014dnen]], which emphasize salvation through faith in [[Amit\u0101bha]] and remain the largest Buddhist sect in Japan (and throughout Asia); and [[Zen]], promulgated by monks such as [[Eisai]] and [[D\u014dgen]], which emphasize liberation through the insight of meditation, which were equally rapidly adopted by the upper classes and had a profound impact on the [[culture of Japan]].\n\nAdditionally, it was during the Kamakura period that the influential monk [[Nichiren]] began teaching devotion to the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]''. Eventually, his disciples formed their own school of [[Nichiren Buddhism]], which includes various sects that have their own interpretations of Nichiren's teachings. Nichiren Buddhism established the foundation of Japanese Buddhism in the thirteenth century. The school is known for its sociopolitical activism and looks to reform society through faith.<ref>Cathy Cantwell and Hiroko Kawanami, \"Buddhism.\" Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations, Third Edition.

The only exception was the [[\u014cbaku]] lineage, which was introduced in the 17th century during the [[Edo period]] by [[Ingen]], a Chinese monk. Ingen had been a member of the [[Linji school]], the Chinese equivalent of Rinzai, which had developed separately from the Japanese branch for hundreds of years. Thus, when Ingen journeyed to Japan following the fall of the [[Ming dynasty]] to the [[Manchu people]], his teachings were seen as a separate school. The \u014cbaku school was named after [[Mount Huangbo]] ({{cjkv|c=\u9ec4\u6a97\u5c71|p=Hu\u00e1ngb\u00f2 sh\u0101n|r=\u014cbaku san}}), which had been Ingen's home in China. Also notable during the period was the publication of an exceptionally high quality reprint of the Ming-era ''[[Tripi\u1e6daka]]'' by [[Tetsugen Doko]], a renowned master of the \u014cbaku school.<ref name=\"Buddhanet\"/>\n\n===Meiji Restoration (1868\u20131912)===\nWith the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, the new government adopted a strong anti-Buddhist attitude, and [[Haibutsu kishaku|a movement to eradicate Buddhism]] and bring Shinto to ascendancy arose throughout the country due to the strong connections of Buddhism to the Sh\u014dguns.\n\nDuring the [[Meiji period]] (1868\u20131912), after a coup in 1868, Japan abandoned its feudal system and opened up to Western modernism.  Shinto became the state religion.

However, in comparison to Chinese or Korean Buddhist schools that are generally more united and less sectarian in their groupings, Buddhist denominations in Japan have developed into independent sects with autonomous organizations that have differing emphases on the doctrine and separate lay followings.\" (Authors: Kawananami, Partridge, and Woodhead  p. 82.)\n\nIn the post-Meiji, pre-WWII period, there were officially 13 schools and 56 branches of traditional Buddhism (i.e., those not established in modern times). The official schools included three from the Nara period, two from the Heian period (Tendai and Shingon), four Pure Land schools, three Zen schools (Rinzai, S\u014dt\u014d and \u014cbaku), and Nichiren. During the war, this was halved to 28 branches, but the law enforcing this was repealed following the end of the war, allowing former branches to return.

However, before his return he also studied, and was initiated into, the practice of the Vajrayana, with emphasis on the Mahavairocana Sutra. The primary text of Tiantai is Lotus Sutra (''Hokke-ky\u014d'' \u6cd5\u83ef\u7d4c), but when Saich\u014d established his school in Japan he incorporated the study and practice of Vajrayana as well.

In consistency with Greek iconography for the wind god [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]], the Japanese wind god holds above his head with his two hands a draping or \"wind bag\" in the same general attitude.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|>Katusmi Tanabe: \"The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins. (...) One of the characteristics of these Far Eastern wind god images is the wind bag held by this god with both hands, the origin of which can be traced back to the shawl or mantle worn by [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]/ Oado.\" (Katsumi Tanabe, \"Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan\", p. 21)}} The abundance of hair has been kept in the Japanese rendering, as well as exaggerated facial features.\n\nAnother Buddhist deity, Shukong\u014dshin, one of the wrath-filled protector deities of Buddhist temples in Japan, is also an interesting case of transmission of the image of the famous Greek god Heracles to East Asia along the [[Silk Road]]. Heracles was used in Greco-Buddhist art to represent [[Vajrapani]], the protector of the Buddha, and his representation was then used in China and Japan to depict the protector gods of Buddhist temples.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Katsumi Tanabe: \"The origin of the image of Vajrapani should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modelled after that of Hercules. (...) The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterwards transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardian Deities ([[Nio]]).\" (Katsumi Tanabe, \"Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan\", p. 23)}}\n\n====Artistic motifs====\n[[File:NaraVines&Grapes.JPG|thumb|200px|Vine and grape scrolls from Nara, 7th century.]]\nThe artistic inspiration from Greek floral scrolls is found quite literally in the decoration of Japanese roof tiles, one of the only remaining element of wooden architecture throughout centuries. The clearest ones are from the 7th century Nara temple building tiles, some of them exactly depicting vines and grapes. These motifs have evolved towards more symbolic representations, but essentially remain to this day in many Japanese traditional buildings.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The transmission of the floral scroll pattern from West to East is presented in the regular exhibition of Ancient Japanese Art, at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].}}\n\n===Temples===\n{{main|List of National Treasures of Japan (temples)}}\n[[Soga no Umako]] built H\u014dk\u014d-ji, the first temple in Japan, between 588 to 596. It was later renamed as [[Asuka-dera]] for [[Asuka, Yamato|Asuka]], the name of the capital where it was located. Unlike early [[Shinto shrine]]s, early [[Buddhist temple]]s were highly ornamental and strictly symmetrical. The early [[Heian period]] (9th\u201310th century) saw an evolution of style based on the [[mikky\u014d]] sects Tendai and [[Shingon Buddhism]]. The [[Daibutsuy\u014d]] style and the [[Zensh\u016by\u014d]] style emerged in the late 12th or early 13th century.\n\n==Buddhist holidays==\n\n===Obon (\u304a\u76c6)===\nAlthough its date and practices vary region to region, the [[Bon Festival]] is celebrated primarily in Japan and in communities with large Japanese diaspora communities. It is believed that the spirits of the dead return to earth for three days and visit the family shrines or graves. It is customary to clean the graves and to hold [[family reunion]]s.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Buddhist deities]]\n*[[Buddhist modernism]]\n*[[Buddhist philosophy]]\n*[[History of Buddhism]]\n*[[Ichibata Yakushi Kyodan]]\n* [[Japanese Buddhist pantheon]]\n*[[Kaich\u014d]]\n*[[Kanjin]]\n*[[Nara National Museum]]\n*[[Religion in Japan]]\n*[[Shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d]]\n*''[[Zen at War]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert|authorlink1=Robert Buswell Jr.|last2=Lopez|first2=Donald S.|authorlink2=Donald S.

The channel launched on 10 October 2005.<ref name=\"Channel 4's More4 makes its debut\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4325828.stm|title=Channel 4's More4 makes its debut|publisher=BBC News|date=10 October 2005}}</ref>\n\n== Content ==\nWhen the channel first launched in 2005, it mostly focused on US dramas and repeats of Channel 4 programmes.\n\nHaving shown all five weekday editions of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' since More4's launch, in January 2011 the channel scaled back its commitment to one episode a week in order to increase investment in its arts programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/20/more4-daily-show-stewart|title=More4 cuts back The Daily Show to one episode a week|publisher=The Guardian|date=20 December 2010|accessdate=18 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 January 2012, More4 refocused towards more lifestyle based content.<ref name=\"More4 is evolving\">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/more4-is-evolving|title=More4 is evolving|publisher=Channel 4|date=3 November 2011}}</ref> Documentaries which previously aired on the channel moved to its parent station Channel 4.\n\n==Branding==\n{{update section|date=January 2019}}\n===2005\u20132012===\n[[File:More4 share of viewing.png|thumbnail|Right|225px|More4 share of viewing 2005-2007 BARB figures]]\nIn September 2005, Channel 4 began running teaser trailers for the new station (although the name was neither mentioned nor seen in the adverts).<ref name=\"Channel 4's More4 makes its debut\" /> Showing neon lettering, the teasers hinted at \"adult entertainment\". Some people may have been confused by the deliberate double-meaning of these trailers and mistakenly presumed the new channel would be of a [[pornography|pornographic]] nature.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4395500.stm|title=Do we need any more digital TV channels?|publisher=BBC News|date=1 November 2005}}</ref> The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' refused to accept launch advertising for the channel on these grounds. Advertisements starting at the end of September made it much clearer that the \"adult entertainment\" being offered was the 'intelligent and insightful' programming. Viewing figures for the launch date gave More4 an average figure of 269,000 viewers, compared to [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]]'s 296,000. The original More4 branding was designed by Spin and animated by DBLG.\n\n===2012\u20132018===\nOn 23 January 2012, More4 adopted a new logo and on-air branding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainment-iuk.com/2012/01/13/more-4-rebrand-coming-23rd-january/|title=More 4 rebrand coming 23rd January|publisher=Entertainment Interactive|date=13 January 2012}}</ref> The logo and channel idents were designed by [[London]]-based design and motion company ManvsMachine and Channel 4's in-house agency, 4Creative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2012/january/more4-identity-man-machine|title=A new identity for More4|publisher=Creative Review|date=24 January 2011}}</ref> The repositioning of the brand coincided with the channel's move towards more lifestyle content and a move away from documentaries and arts. The idents focus on moving mechanical \"scrapbooks\" which also refers to the Digital Scrapbook platform.<ref>[http://manvsmachine.co.uk/projects/project/more4_rebrand ManvsMachine - More4 Rebrand 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330075948/http://manvsmachine.co.uk/projects/project/more4_rebrand |date=30 March 2012 }}</ref>\n=== 2018-present ===\n{{expand section|date=January 2019}}\nA new logo and branding was introduced in 2018.<ref>https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logos_for_all_channel_4_by_4creative_and_manvsmachine.php</ref>\n\nThe branding was not major, the idents stayed the same but the logo was changed. This was part of the [[Channel 4]] major rebranding across all their channels.\n\n== Availability ==\nSpace was reserved on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] multiplex C for the channel. However, despite Channel 4 saying that the channel would appear on multiplex C, the channel appeared on multiplex 2. A place holder appeared on the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] [[Electronic program guide|EPG]] at number 13 on 13 September and after a time, ran a looping teaser trailer. More4 +1 became available on the [[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]] platform on 14 December 2005. It was removed on 18 May 2006, to make way for live coverage of ''[[Big Brother UK series 7|Big Brother]]'', and the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] launch of [[Film4]] later in the year.\n\nWhile More4 is available on most [[cable television|cable]] platforms, More4 +1 was available on [[Virgin Media]] until 20 August 2007 when it was replaced by Channel 4 +1 across the digital television network. It was re-added on 15 January 2013.\n\nDespite initial advertising and official internet communication that it would be [[free-to-air]] on satellite television, More4 was encrypted under Sky's [[pay TV]] scheme until 6 May 2008 when it dropped its [[NDS Group|NDS]] encryption and went free-to-air. It joined the BBC and ITV's new satellite platform, [[Freesat]] on the same day.\n\nMore4 is available outside the UK where it is available to viewers in Ireland via Sky and [[Virgin Media Ireland]]'s digital service. This led to further speculation that Channel 4 would eventually launch on Sky in Ireland, which it did in December 2006. Channel 4 has already made its other flagship channels: [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]], E4 +1, [[Film4]] and Film4 +1 available in Ireland via Sky, [[Virgin Media Ireland]] digital TV providers.

The channel launched on 10 October 2005.<ref name=\"Channel 4's More4 makes its debut\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4325828.stm|title=Channel 4's More4 makes its debut|publisher=BBC News|date=10 October 2005}}</ref>\n\n== Content ==\nWhen the channel first launched in 2005, it mostly focused on US dramas and repeats of Channel 4 programmes.\n\nHaving shown all five weekday editions of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' since More4's launch, in January 2011 the channel scaled back its commitment to one episode a week in order to increase investment in its arts programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/20/more4-daily-show-stewart|title=More4 cuts back The Daily Show to one episode a week|publisher=The Guardian|date=20 December 2010|accessdate=18 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 January 2012, More4 refocused towards more lifestyle based content.<ref name=\"More4 is evolving\">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/more4-is-evolving|title=More4 is evolving|publisher=Channel 4|date=3 November 2011}}</ref> Documentaries which previously aired on the channel moved to its parent station Channel 4.\n\n==Branding==\n{{update section|date=January 2019}}\n===2005\u20132012===\n[[File:More4 share of viewing.png|thumbnail|Right|225px|More4 share of viewing 2005-2007 BARB figures]]\nIn September 2005, Channel 4 began running teaser trailers for the new station (although the name was neither mentioned nor seen in the adverts).<ref name=\"Channel 4's More4 makes its debut\" /> Showing neon lettering, the teasers hinted at \"adult entertainment\". Some people may have been confused by the deliberate double-meaning of these trailers and mistakenly presumed the new channel would be of a [[pornography|pornographic]] nature.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4395500.stm|title=Do we need any more digital TV channels?|publisher=BBC News|date=1 November 2005}}</ref> The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' refused to accept launch advertising for the channel on these grounds. Advertisements starting at the end of September made it much clearer that the \"adult entertainment\" being offered was the 'intelligent and insightful' programming. Viewing figures for the launch date gave More4 an average figure of 269,000 viewers, compared to [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]]'s 296,000. The original More4 branding was designed by Spin and animated by DBLG.\n\n===2012\u20132018===\nOn 23 January 2012, More4 adopted a new logo and on-air branding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainment-iuk.com/2012/01/13/more-4-rebrand-coming-23rd-january/|title=More 4 rebrand coming 23rd January|publisher=Entertainment Interactive|date=13 January 2012}}</ref> The logo and channel idents were designed by [[London]]-based design and motion company ManvsMachine and Channel 4's in-house agency, 4Creative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2012/january/more4-identity-man-machine|title=A new identity for More4|publisher=Creative Review|date=24 January 2011}}</ref> The repositioning of the brand coincided with the channel's move towards more lifestyle content and a move away from documentaries and arts. The idents focus on moving mechanical \"scrapbooks\" which also refers to the Digital Scrapbook platform.<ref>[http://manvsmachine.co.uk/projects/project/more4_rebrand ManvsMachine - More4 Rebrand 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330075948/http://manvsmachine.co.uk/projects/project/more4_rebrand |date=30 March 2012 }}</ref>\n=== 2018-present ===\n{{expand section|date=January 2019}}\nA new logo and branding was introduced in 2018.<ref>https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logos_for_all_channel_4_by_4creative_and_manvsmachine.php</ref>\n\nThe branding was not major, the idents stayed the same but the logo was changed. This was part of the [[Channel 4]] major rebranding across all their channels.\n\n== Availability ==\nSpace was reserved on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] multiplex C for the channel. However, despite Channel 4 saying that the channel would appear on multiplex C, the channel appeared on multiplex 2. A place holder appeared on the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] [[Electronic program guide|EPG]] at number 13 on 13 September and after a time, ran a looping teaser trailer. More4 +1 became available on the [[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]] platform on 14 December 2005. It was removed on 18 May 2006, to make way for live coverage of ''[[Big Brother UK series 7|Big Brother]]'', and the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] launch of [[Film4]] later in the year.\n\nWhile More4 is available on most [[cable television|cable]] platforms, More4 +1 was available on [[Virgin Media]] until 20 August 2007 when it was replaced by Channel 4 +1 across the digital television network. It was re-added on 15 January 2013.\n\nDespite initial advertising and official internet communication that it would be [[free-to-air]] on satellite television, More4 was encrypted under Sky's [[pay TV]] scheme until 6 May 2008 when it dropped its [[NDS Group|NDS]] encryption and went free-to-air. It joined the BBC and ITV's new satellite platform, [[Freesat]] on the same day.\n\nMore4 is available outside the UK where it is available to viewers in Ireland via Sky and [[Virgin Media Ireland]]'s digital service. This led to further speculation that Channel 4 would eventually launch on Sky in Ireland, which it did in December 2006. Channel 4 has already made its other flagship channels: [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]], E4 +1, [[Film4]] and Film4 +1 available in Ireland via Sky, [[Virgin Media Ireland]] digital TV providers. Channel 4 itself is available on almost all Irish cable and [[MMDS]] systems (in some cases Channel 4 is replaced with S4C).

They began using the pointed arch to create the [[rib vault]], which they used to cover the naves of abbeys and Cathedrals. The first Gothic rib vault was built at [[Durham Cathedral]] in England in 1093.{{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|page=10}}  Others appeared in the desrmbulatory of The [[Abbey of Saint Denis]] in Paris (1140-1144), [[Lessay Abbey]] in Normandy (1064-1178), [[Cefalu Cathedral]] in Sicily, (1131-1240). and the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]].\n\nThe rib vault quickly replaced the Romanesque [[barrel vault]] in he construction of cathedrals, palaces  and other large structures.  In a barrel vault, the rounded arch over the nave pressed down directly onto the walls, which had to be very thick, with few windows, to support the weight.  In the rib vault, the thin stone ribs of the pointed arches distributed the weight outwards and downwards to the rows of pillars  below. The result was that the walls could be thinner and higher, and they could have large windows between the columns. With the addition of the [[flying buttress]], the weight could be supported by curving columns outside the building, which meant that the Cathedrals could be even taller, with immense  stained glass windows. {{Sfn|Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006)|page=34-35}} \n\n\nThe rib vault quickly replaced the Romanesque [[barrel vault]] in he construction of cathedrals, palaces  and other large structures.

It could only cross a limited amount of space, and required a system of alternating columns and pillars.  This type was used in [[Sens Cathedral]] and [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. A new version was soon introduced, which reduced the number of compartments from six to four, distributed the weight equally to four pillars, eliminating the need for alternating columns and pillars, and allowed the vault to span a wider space. This quadripartite vault was used at [[Amiens Cathedral]], [[Chartres Cathedral]], and [[Reims Cathedral]], and gave these structures unprecedented height. {{Sfn|Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006)|page=34-35}}\n\n=== Portals ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Catedral de Toledo Puerta de los Leones.JPG|Portal of [[Toledo Cathedral]], the \"Door of the Lions\"  (1226-1493)\nFile:Reims Cathedral west portals.JPG|West portal of [[Reims Cathedral]] (1211-1345)\nFile:Chartres - portail royal, tympan central.jpg|Central portal of [[Chartres Cathedral]] (1194-1220)\n</gallery>\nPortals of Cathedrals in the Gothic period were usually in the form of a pointed arch, surrounded by sculpture, often symbolizing the entrance to heaven.\n\n===As a window===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Abad\u00eda de Aulne 06.jpg|Ruin of [[Aulne Abbey]] in Belgium  (1214-1247)\nFile:High Altar - geograph.org.uk - 1428606.jpg|Lancet windows \nFile:Double-Lancet Window MET DP102909.jpg|A Double-Lancet Window (about 1330) (Metropolitan Museum of Art) \nFile:Interior of Sainte Chapelle, Vincennes 140308 1.jpg|Pointed windows of the nave of [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] occupy near all the walls. (1379-1480)\n</gallery>\n\nThe window in the form of a pointed arch is a common characteristic of the Gothic style. Windows sometimes were constructed in the classical form of a pointed arch, which is denominated an \"equilateral arch\", while others had more imaginative forms that combined various geometric forms. One common form was the [[lancet window]], a tall and slender window with a pointed arch, which took its name from the [[lance]]. Lancet windows were often grouped into sets, with two or three adjacent windows.\n\nThe late Gothic, also known as the [[Flamboyant Gothic]], had windows with pointed arches that occupied nearly all the space of the walls. Notable examples are the windows of [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] (1379\u20131480)\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Paris Sainte Chapelle du Chateau de Vincennes ancienne demeure royale Vers le Bois de Vincennes en France angle 3.JPG|Multiple arches of the [[Flamboyant]] Gothic at [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]].  \nFile:Spitzbogen.png|Varieties of Gothic pointed arches \nFile:Great Gate, Trinity College, Cambridge (inside).jpg|The Great Gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, an example of a [[Tudor Arch]] or [[Four-centred arch]] \n</gallery>\n\n=== Forms ===\nThe form of the Gothic pointed arch in windows and arches was typically based upon an [[equilateral triangle]], in which the three sides have an equal length.  This had the great advantage of simplicity. Stone cutters, or hewers, could precisely draw the arc on the stone with a cord and a marker. This allowed arch stones to be cut at the quarry in quantity with great precision, then delivered and assembled at the site, where the layers put them together, with the assurance that they would fit.  The use of the equilateral triangle was given a theological explanation - the three sides represented the [[Holy Trinity]]. {{Sfn|Bechmann (2011), pp. 207-215}}\n\nIn the later years of the [[flamboyant Gothic]] the arches and windows often took on more elaborate forms, with tracery circles and multiple forms within forms.  Some used a modification of the [[horseshoe arch]], borrowed from [[Islamic architecture]]. \n\nThe [[Tudor Arch]] of the Late Gothic style was a variation of the Islamic [[Four-centred arch]].  A four-centred arch is a low, wide type of arch with a pointed apex. Its structure is achieved by drafting two arcs which rise steeply from each springing point on a small radius, and then turning into two arches with a wide radius and much lower springing point. It is a pointed sub-type of the general flattened depressed arch. Two of the most notable types are known as the Persian arch, which is moderately \"depressed\",<ref name=\"autogenerated25\"/>  \n\nThe Tudor arch, which is flatter than the Persian Arch, was widely used in [[English architecture]], particularly during the [[Tudor dynasty]] (1485\u20131603), <ref>[[Augustus Pugin]], ''Specimens of Gothic Architecture: Selected from Various Ancient Edifices in England'', 1821, Volumes 1-2, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oFVDAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA3 google books]</ref>\n\n== Revival of pointed arch ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Strawberry Hill House 01.jpg|[[Strawberry Hill House]], residence of [[Horace Walpole]] (1749 onward)\nFile:Houses of Parliament, Entrance to Victoria's Tower (3611642058).jpg|Entrance to Victoria's Tower of the [[Houses of Parliament]], London  (1840-1876)\nFile:\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f \u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0444 -1.jpg|Peterhof Railway station, [[Petergof|Peterhof]], Russia (1857) \nFile:Grace Cathedral 07.JPG|Interior of [[Grace Cathedral, San Francisco|Grace Cathedral]] in [[San Francisco]] (1910-1964) \n</gallery>\nThough the Gothic pointed arch was largely abandoned during the [[Renaissance]], replaced by more classical forms, it reappeared in the 18th and 19th century, [[Gothic Revival architecture]].  It was used in [[Strawberry Hill House]], the residence in [[Twickenham]], London built by [[Horace Walpole]] (1717\u20131797) from 1749 onward. It was usually used in churches and chapels, and later in the British  [[Houses of Parliament]] in London, (1840-1876) rebuilt after the earlier building was destroyed by a fire. In the 19th century, pointed arches appeared in varied structures, including the Gothic train station in [[Peterhof]], Russia (1857).\n\n==Notes and Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Bechmann|first=Roland|title=Les Racines des Cath\u00e9drales|date=2017|publisher=Payot|language=fr|isbn=978-2-228-90651-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bony|first=Jean|year=1983|title=French Gothic Architecture of the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries|publisher=[[University of California]] [[University of California Press|Press]]|isbn=978-0-520-02831-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k7ytJ-gXonMC&printsec=frontcover|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Ducher|first=Robert|title=Caract\u00e9ristique des Styles|year=1988|language=fr|publisher=Flammarion|isbn=978-2-08-011539-3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Mignon|first=Olivier|title=Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques|date=2015|publisher=\u00c9ditions Ouest-France|language=fr|isbn=978-2-7373-6535-5|ref=harv}}\n* Viollet-Le-Duc, Eugene  \"\"Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 de l\u2019architecture fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVIe si\u00e8cle\"'\n[[Category:Arches and vaults]]\n[[Category:Gothic architecture]]\n", "text_old": "{{see also|Gothic architecture|Islamic architecture}}\n[[File:Worcester cathedral 010.JPG|thumb|Pointed arches form the [[rib vault]]s of [[Worcester Cathedral]] (1084-1504)]]\nThe pointed arch (arc bris\u00e9 in French) is an arch with a pointed crown, whose two curving sides meet at a relatively sharp angle at the top of the arch. <ref>Bechmann, Roland, ''Les Racines des cath\u00e9drales'' (pg. 322) </ref> This architectural element was particularly important in [[Gothic architecture]].

They began using the pointed arch to create the [[rib vault]], which they used to cover the naves of abbeys and Cathedrals. The first Gothic rib vault was built at [[Durham Cathedral]] in England in 1093.{{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|page=10}}  Others appeared in the desrmbulatory of The [[Abbey of Saint Denis]] in Paris (1140-1144), [[Lessay Abbey]] in Normandy (1064-1178), [[Cefalu Cathedral]] in Sicily, (1131-1240). and the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]].\n\nThe rib vault quickly replaced the Romanesque [[barrel vault]] in he construction of cathedrals, palaces  and other large structures.  In a barrel vault, the rounded arch over the nave pressed down directly onto the walls, which had to be very thick, with few windows, to support the weight.  In the rib vault, the thin stone ribs of the pointed arches distributed the weight outwards and downwards to the rows of pillars  below. The result was that the walls could be thinner and higher, and they could have large windows between the columns. With the addition of the [[flying buttress]], the weight could be supported by curving columns outside the building, which meant that the Cathedrals could be even taller, with immense  stained glass windows. {{Sfn|Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006)|page=34-35}} \n\n\nThe rib vault quickly replaced the Romanesque [[barrel vault]] in he construction of cathedrals, palaces  and other large structures.

It could only cross a limited amount of space, and required a system of alternating columns and pillars.  This type was used in [[Sens Cathedral]] and [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. A new version was soon introduced, which reduced the number of compartments from six to four, distributed the weight equally to four pillars, eliminating the need for alternating columns and pillars, and allowed the vault to span a wider space. This quadripartite vault was used at [[Amiens Cathedral]], [[Chartres Cathedral]], and [[Reims Cathedral]], and gave these structures unprecedented height. {{Sfn|Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006)|page=34-35}}\n\n=== Portals ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Catedral de Toledo Puerta de los Leones.JPG|Portal of [[Toledo Cathedral]], the \"Door of the Lions\"  (1226-1493)\nFile:Reims Cathedral west portals.JPG|West portal of [[Reims Cathedral]] (1211-1345)\nFile:Chartres - portail royal, tympan central.jpg|Central portal of [[Chartres Cathedral]] (1194-1220)\n</gallery>\nPortals of Cathedrals in the Gothic period were usually in the form of a pointed arch, surrounded by sculpture, often symbolizing the entrance to heaven.\n\n===THe Gothic window===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Abad\u00eda de Aulne 06.jpg|Ruin of [[Aulne Abbey]] in Belgium  (1214-1247)\nFile:High Altar - geograph.org.uk - 1428606.jpg|Lancet windows \nFile:Double-Lancet Window MET DP102909.jpg|A Double-Lancet Window (about 1330) (Metropolitan Museum of Art) \nFile:Interior of Sainte Chapelle, Vincennes 140308 1.jpg|Pointed windows of the nave of [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] occupy near all the walls. (1379-1480)\n</gallery>\n\n\nThe window in the form of a pointed arch is a common characteristic of the Gothic style.  Windows sometimes used the classical form of a pointed arch, with the base and the height being the same, while others took more imaginative forms, combining various geometric forms. \n\nOne common form was the [[lancet window]], a tall, slender window with a pointed arch at the top, which took its name from the lance, or spear.  Lancet windows were often grouped into sets, with two or three windows side by side.\n\nThe late Gothic, also known as the [[Flamboyant Gothic]], saw windows with pointed arches that occupied nearly all the space of the walls.  A particularly notable example is [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] (1379-1480)\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Paris Sainte Chapelle du Chateau de Vincennes ancienne demeure royale Vers le Bois de Vincennes en France angle 3.JPG|Multiple arches of the [[Flamboyant]] Gothic at [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]].  \nFile:Spitzbogen.png|Varieties of Gothic pointed arches \nFile:Great Gate, Trinity College, Cambridge (inside).jpg|The Great Gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, an example of a [[Tudor Arch]] or [[Four-centred arch]] \n</gallery>\n\n=== Forms ===\nThe form of the Gothic pointed arch in windows and arches was typically based upon an [[equilateral triangle]], in which the three sides have an equal length.  This had the great advantage of simplicity. Stone cutters, or hewers, could precisely draw the arc on the stone with a cord and a marker. This allowed arch stones to be cut at the quarry in quantity with great precision, then delivered and assembled at the site, where the layers put them together, with the assurance that they would fit.  The use of the equilateral triangle was given a theological explanation - the three sides represented the [[Holy Trinity]]. {{Sfn|Bechmann (2011), pp. 207-215}}\n\nIn the later years of the [[flamboyant Gothic]] the arches and windows often took on more elaborate forms, with tracery circles and multiple forms within forms.  Some used a modification of the [[horseshoe arch]], borrowed from [[Islamic architecture]]. \n\nThe [[Tudor Arch]] of the Late Gothic style was a variation of the Islamic [[Four-centred arch]].  A four-centred arch is a low, wide type of arch with a pointed apex. Its structure is achieved by drafting two arcs which rise steeply from each springing point on a small radius, and then turning into two arches with a wide radius and much lower springing point. It is a pointed sub-type of the general flattened depressed arch. Two of the most notable types are known as the Persian arch, which is moderately \"depressed\",<ref name=\"autogenerated25\"/>  \n\nThe Tudor arch, which is flatter than the Persian Arch, was widely used in [[English architecture]], particularly during the [[Tudor dynasty]] (1485\u20131603), <ref>[[Augustus Pugin]], ''Specimens of Gothic Architecture: Selected from Various Ancient Edifices in England'', 1821, Volumes 1-2, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oFVDAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA3 google books]</ref>\n\n== Revival of pointed arch ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Strawberry Hill House 01.jpg|[[Strawberry Hill House]], residence of [[Horace Walpole]] (1749 onward)\nFile:Houses of Parliament, Entrance to Victoria's Tower (3611642058).jpg|Entrance to Victoria's Tower of the [[Houses of Parliament]], London  (1840-1876)\nFile:\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f \u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0444 -1.jpg|Peterhof Railway station, [[Petergof|Peterhof]], Russia (1857) \nFile:Grace Cathedral 07.JPG|Interior of [[Grace Cathedral, San Francisco|Grace Cathedral]] in [[San Francisco]] (1910-1964) \n</gallery>\nThough the Gothic pointed arch was largely abandoned during the [[Renaissance]], replaced by more classical forms, it reappeared in the 18th and 19th century, [[Gothic Revival architecture]].  It was used in [[Strawberry Hill House]], the residence in [[Twickenham]], London built by [[Horace Walpole]] (1717\u20131797) from 1749 onward. It was usually used in churches and chapels, and later in the British  [[Houses of Parliament]] in London, (1840-1876) rebuilt after the earlier building was destroyed by a fire. In the 19th century, pointed arches appeared in varied structures, including the Gothic train station in [[Peterhof]], Russia (1857).\n\n==Notes and Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Bechmann|first=Roland|title=Les Racines des Cath\u00e9drales|date=2017|publisher=Payot|language=fr|isbn=978-2-228-90651-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bony|first=Jean|year=1983|title=French Gothic Architecture of the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries|publisher=[[University of California]] [[University of California Press|Press]]|isbn=978-0-520-02831-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k7ytJ-gXonMC&printsec=frontcover|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Ducher|first=Robert|title=Caract\u00e9ristique des Styles|year=1988|language=fr|publisher=Flammarion|isbn=978-2-08-011539-3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Mignon|first=Olivier|title=Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques|date=2015|publisher=\u00c9ditions Ouest-France|language=fr|isbn=978-2-7373-6535-5|ref=harv}}\n* Viollet-Le-Duc, Eugene  \"\"Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 de l\u2019architecture fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVIe si\u00e8cle\"'\n[[Category:Arches and vaults]]\n[[Category:Gothic architecture]]\n", "name_user": "Prestinius", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTHe Gothic window:improved wording and corrected typo.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointed_arch_(architecture)"}

The goal is to identify infants at risk for these conditions early enough to confirm the diagnosis and provide intervention that will alter the clinical course of the disease and prevent or ameliorate the clinical manifestations.  NBS started with the discovery that the amino acid disorder [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU) could be treated by dietary adjustment, and that early intervention was required for the best outcome.  Infants with PKU appear normal at birth, but are unable to metabolize the essential amino acid [[phenylalanine]], resulting in irreversible [[intellectual disability]].  In the 1960s, [[Robert Guthrie]] developed a simple method using a bacterial inhibition assay that could detect high levels of phenylalanine in blood shortly after a baby was born. Guthrie also pioneered the collection of blood on [[filter paper]] which could be easily transported, recognizing the need for a simple system if the screening was going to be done on a large scale. Newborn screening around the world is still done using similar filter paper.  NBS was first introduced as a public health program in the [[United States]] in the early 1960s, and has expanded to countries around the world.\n\nScreening programs are often run by state or national governing bodies with the goal of screening all infants born in the jurisdiction for a defined panel of treatable disorders. The number of diseases screened for is set by each jurisdiction, and can vary greatly. Most NBS tests are done by measuring metabolites or [[enzyme]] activity in [[whole blood]] samples collected on filter paper. Bedside tests for [[hearing loss]] using automated auditory brainstem response and [[congenital heart defects]] using [[pulse oximetry]] are included in some NBS programs. Infants who screen positive undergo further testing to determine if they are truly affected with a disease or if the test result was a [[false positive]]. Follow-up testing is typically coordinated between [[geneticists]] and the infant's [[pediatrician]] or [[primary care physician]].\n\n==History==\n[[Robert Guthrie]] is given much of the credit for pioneering the earliest screening for [[phenylketonuria]] in the late 1960s using a bacterial inhibition assay (BIA) to measure phenylalanine levels in [[blood]] samples obtained by pricking a newborn baby's heel on the second day of life on [[filter paper]].<ref name=\"pmid11728413\">{{cite journal| author = Clague A| author2 = Thomas A| title = Neonatal biochemical screening for disease| journal = Clin.

They also developed an evidence-based review process for the addition of conditions in the future.  The implementation of this panel across the United States meant all babies born would be screened for the same number of conditions. This recommendation is not binding for individual states, and some states may screen for disorders that are not included on this list of recommended disorders. Prior to this, babies born in different states had received different levels of screening.  On April 24, 2008, President George W. Bush signed into law the [[Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2007]]. This act was enacted to increase awareness among parents, health professionals, and the public on testing newborns to identify certain disorders. It also sought to improve, expand, and enhance current newborn screening programs at the state level.\n\n==Inclusion of disorders==\nNewborn screening programs initially used [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] criteria based largely on criteria established by JMG Wilson and F. Jungner in 1968.<ref name=wilsonjungner>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Jungner | first2 = Y.

Newborn screening programs are administered in each jurisdiction, with additions and removals from the panel typically reviewed by a panel of experts.  The four criteria from the publication that were relied upon when making decisions for early newborn screening programs were: \n# having an acceptable treatment protocol in place that changes the outcome for patients diagnosed early with the disease\n# an understanding of the condition's natural history\n# an understanding about who will be treated as a patient\n# a screening test that is reliable for both affected and unaffected patients and is acceptable to the public<ref name=screeningduchenne>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = L.

An Australian study found a 74% reduction in episodes of severe metabolic decompensation or death among individuals identified by newborn screening as having MCADD versus those who presented clinically prior to screening.  Studies in the Netherlands and United Kingdom found improvements in outcome at a reduced cost when infants were identified before presenting clinically.<ref name=faoreview />\n\nNewborn screening programs have also expanded the information base available about some rare conditions.  Prior to its inclusion in newborn screening, [[short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency]] (SCADD) was thought to be life-threatening.  Most patients identified via newborn screening as having this enzyme deficiency were [[asymptomatic]], to the extent that SCADD was removed from screening panels in a number of regions.  Without the cohort of patients identified by newborn screening, this clinical phenotype would likely not have been identified.<ref name=faoreview />\n\n===Endocrinopathies===\nThe most commonly included disorders of the [[endocrine system]] are [[congenital hypothyroidism]] (CH) and [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH).<ref name=endocrinopathies>{{Cite journal | last1 = Pass | first1 = K.

Screening for CH is done by measuring [[thyroxin]] (T4), [[thyrotropin]] (TSH) or a combination of both analytes.  Elevated [[17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone]] (17\u03b1-OHP) is the primary marker used when screening for CAH, most commonly done using [[ELISA|enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays]], with many programs using a second tier [[tandem mass spectrometry]] test to reduce the number of [[false positive]] results.<ref name=endocrinopathies />  Careful analysis of screening results for CAH may also identify cases of [[congenital adrenal hypoplasia]], which presents with extremely low levels of 17\u03b1-OHP.<ref name=endocrinopathies />\n\nCH was added to many newborn screening programs in the 1970s, often as the second condition included after PKU.  The most common cause of CH is dysgenesis of the [[thyroid gland]]  After many years of newborn screening, the incidence of CH worldwide had been estimated at 1:3600 births, with no obvious increases in specific ethnic groups.  Recent data from certain regions have shown an increase, with New York reporting an incidence of 1:1700.  Reasons for the apparent increase in incidence have been studied, but no explanation has been found.<ref name=endocrinopathies />\n\nClassic CAH, the disorder targeted by newborn screening programs, is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme [[steroid 21-hydroxylase]] and comes in two forms \u2013 simple virilizing and a salt-wasting form.  The incidence of CAH can vary greatly between populations.  The highest reported incidence rates are among the Yupic Eskimos of Alaska (1:280) and on the French island of [[R\u00e9union]] (1:2100).<ref name=endocrinopathies />\n\n===Hemoglobinopathies===\n[[File:Sickle cells.jpg|thumb|Sickle cells in human blood: both normal red blood cells and sickle-shaped cells are present]] \nAny condition that results in the production of abnormal [[hemoglobin]] is included under the broad category of [[hemoglobinopathies]].

As a group, they are heterogenous, with screening only being feasible for a small fraction of the approximately 40 identified disorders.

Early identification allows these patients and their families to access the necessary resources to help them maximize their developmental outcomes.<ref name=hearingreview />\n\nNewborn hearing testing is done at the bedside using transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions, automated auditory brainstem responses, or a combination of both techniques.  Hearing screening programs have found the initial testing to cost between $10.20 and $23.37 per baby, depending on the technology used.<ref name=hearingreview />  As these are screening tests only, [[false positive]] results will occur. False positive results could be due to user error, a fussy baby, environmental noise in the testing room, or fluid or congestion in the outer/middle ear of the baby.

The highest overall incidence of hearing loss detection was 0.517%.<ref name=hearingreview />  A significant proportion of screen positive infants were [[lost to follow-up]] before a diagnosis could be confirmed or ruled out in all screening programs.<ref name=hearingreview />\n\n===Congenital heart defects===\nIn some cases, critical [[congenital heart defect]]s (CCHD) are not identified by prenatal ultrasound or postnatal physical examination. [[Pulse oximetry]] has been recently added as a bedside screening test for CCHD<ref name=pulseoxreview /> at 24 to 48 hours after birth. However, not all heart problems can be detected by this method, which relies only on blood oxygen levels.\n\nWhen a baby tests positive, urgent subsequent examination, such as [[echocardiography]], is undergone to determine the cause of low oxygen levels. Babies diagnosed with CCHD are then seen by [[cardiologist]]s.\n\n===Severe combined immunodeficiency===\n[[Severe combined immunodeficiency]] (SCID) caused by [[T-cell]] deficiency is a disorder that was recently added to newborn screening programs in some regions of the United States.  Wisconsin was the first state to add SCID to their mandatory screening panel in 2008, and it was recommended for inclusion in all states' panels in 2010.

It requires technology that is not currently used in most newborn screening labs, as PCR is not used for any other assays included in screening programs.

Many jurisdictions around the world have screened for, or attempted to screen for DMD using elevated levels of [[creatine kinase]] measured in dried blood spots.  Because universal newborn screening for DMD has not been undertaken, affected individuals often have a significant delay in diagnosis.  As treatment options for DMD become more and more effective, interest in adding a newborn screening test increases.  At various times since 1978, DMD has been included (often as a pilot study on a small subset of the population) in newborn screening programs in [[Edinburgh]], [[Germany]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Wales]], [[Cyprus]], [[Belgium]] and the [[United States]].

The filter paper is often attached to a form containing required information about the infant and parents.  This includes date and time of birth, date and time of sample collection, the infant's weight and gestational age.  The form will also have information about whether the baby has had a blood transfusion and any additional nutrition the baby may have received ([[total parenteral nutrition]]).  Most newborn screening cards also include contact information for the infant's physician in cases where follow up screening or treatment is needed.  The Canadian province of [[Quebec]] performs newborn screening on whole blood samples collected as in most other jurisdictions, and also runs a voluntary [[urine]] screening program where parents collect a sample at 21 days of age and submit it to a provincial laboratory for an additional panel of conditions.<ref name=quebecblood>{{cite web|title=Newborn blood screening|url=http://www4.gouv.qc.ca/EN/Portail/Citoyens/Evenements/DevenirParent/Pages/progr_depst_neont_sangn.aspx |publisher=Government of Quebec|accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref><ref name=quebecurine>{{cite web|title=Newborn urine screening|url=http://www4.gouv.qc.ca/EN/Portail/Citoyens/Evenements/DevenirParent/Pages/progr_depst_neont_urinr.aspx#|publisher=Government of Quebec|accessdate=2012-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114080750/http://www4.gouv.qc.ca/EN/portail/citoyens/evenements/devenirparent/pages/progr_depst_neont_urinr.aspx|archive-date=2012-01-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nNewborn screening samples are collected from the infant between 24 hours and 7 days after birth, and it is recommended that the infant has fed at least once.  Individual jurisdictions will often have more specific requirements, with some states accepting samples collected at 12 hours, and others recommending to wait until 48 hours of life or later.  Each laboratory will have its own criteria on when a sample is acceptable, or if another would need to be collected.  Samples can be collected at the hospital, or by [[midwife|midwives]].  Samples are transported daily to the laboratory responsible for testing.  In the United States and Canada, newborn screening is mandatory, with an option for parents to opt out of the screening in writing if they desire.

As [[mass spectrometry]] became more widely available, the technology allowed rapid determination of a number of acylcarnitines and [[amino acid]]s from a single dried blood spot.  This increased the number of conditions that could be detected by newborn screening.  Enzyme assays are used to screen for [[galactosemia]] and [[biotinidase deficiency]].  Immunoassays measure [[thyroid hormones]] for the diagnosis of [[congenital hypothyroidism]] and [[17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone]] for the diagnosis of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]].  Molecular techniques are used for the diagnosis of [[cystic fibrosis]] and [[severe combined immunodeficiency]].\n\n===Reporting results===\nThe goal is to report the results within a short period of time. If screens are normal, a paper report is sent to the submitting hospital and parents rarely hear about it.  If an abnormality is detected, employees of the agency, usually nurses, begin to try to reach the physician, hospital, and/or nursery by telephone. They are persistent until they can arrange an evaluation of the infant by an appropriate specialist physician (depending on the disease). The specialist will attempt to confirm the diagnosis by repeating the tests by a different method or laboratory, or by performing other corroboratory or disproving tests. The confirmatory test varies depending on the positive results on the initial screen. Confirmatory testing can include analyte specific assays to confirm any elevations detected, functional studies to determine enzyme activity, and genetic testing to identify disease-causing mutations.  In some cases, a positive newborn screen can also trigger testing on other family members, such as siblings who did not undergo newborn screening for the same condition or the baby's mother, as some maternal conditions can be identified through results on the baby's newborn screen.  Depending on the likelihood of the diagnosis and the risk of delay, the specialist will initiate treatment and provide information to the family.

Lawsuits, media attention, and advocacy groups have surfaced a number of different, and possibly countervailing, positions on the use of screening tests.  Some have asked for government mandates to widen the extent of the screening to find detectable and treatable birth defects.  Others have opposed mandatory screening concerned that effective follow-up and treatment may not be available, or that [[false positive]] screening tests may cause harm to infants and their families.  Others have learned that government agencies were often secretly storing the results in databases for future genetic research, often without consent of the parents nor limits on how the data could be used in the future.\n\n==== Increasing mandatory tests in California ====\nMany rare diseases have not historically been tested for or testing that has been available has not been mandatory.  One such disease is [[Glutaric aciduria type 1|glutaric acidemia type I]], a neurometabolic disease present in approximately 1 out of every 100,000 live births.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hoffmann |first1=Georg |title=Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency |url=https://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/Disease_Search.php?lng=EN&data_id=3564&Disease_Disease_Search_diseaseGroup=231670&Disease_Disease_Search_diseaseType=MIM&Disease%28s%29/group%20of%20diseases=Glutaric-aciduria-type-1&title=Glutaric-aciduria-type-1&searc |website=Orphanet |publisher=The portal for rare diseases and orphan drugs |accessdate=21 December 2019}}</ref> A short-term California testing pilot project in 2003 and 2004 demonstrated the cost of forgoing rare disease testing on newborns.

When states choose to run their own programs the initial costs for equipment, training and new staff can be significant. Moreover, MS/MS gives only the screening result and not the confirmatory result. The same has to be further done by higher technologies or procedure like GC/MS{{clarify|perhaps just expand the esoteric acronym|date=December 2019}}, Enzyme Assays or DNA Tests. This in effect adds more cost burden and makes physicians lose precious time.{{according to whom|date=December 2019}} To avoid at least a portion of the up front costs, some states such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20080907092110/http://www.savebabies.org/states/mississippi.php Mississippi] have chosen to contract with private labs for expanded screening.  Others have chosen to form [https://web.archive.org/web/20080808121643/http://www.umassmed.edu/nbs Regional Partnerships] sharing both costs and resources.\n\nBut for many states, screening has become an integrated part of the department of health which can not or will not be easily replaced.  Thus the initial expenditures can be difficult for states with tight budgets to justify.  Screening fees have also increased in recent years as health care costs rise and as more states add MS/MS screening to their programs.

The goal is to identify infants at risk for these conditions early enough to confirm the diagnosis and provide intervention that will alter the clinical course of the disease and prevent or ameliorate the clinical manifestations.  NBS started with the discovery that the amino acid disorder [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU) could be treated by dietary adjustment, and that early intervention was required for the best outcome.  Infants with PKU appear normal at birth, but are unable to metabolize the essential amino acid [[phenylalanine]], resulting in irreversible [[intellectual disability]].  In the 1960s, [[Robert Guthrie]] developed a simple method using a bacterial inhibition assay that could detect high levels of phenylalanine in blood shortly after a baby was born. Guthrie also pioneered the collection of blood on [[filter paper]] which could be easily transported, recognizing the need for a simple system if the screening was going to be done on a large scale. Newborn screening around the world is still done using similar filter paper.  NBS was first introduced as a public health program in the [[United States]] in the early 1960s, and has expanded to countries around the world.\n\nScreening programs are often run by state or national governing bodies with the goal of screening all infants born in the jurisdiction for a defined panel of treatable disorders. The number of diseases screened for is set by each jurisdiction, and can vary greatly. Most NBS tests are done by measuring metabolites or [[enzyme]] activity in [[whole blood]] samples collected on filter paper. Bedside tests for [[hearing loss]] using automated auditory brainstem response and [[congenital heart defects]] using [[pulse oximetry]] are included in some NBS programs. Infants who screen positive undergo further testing to determine if they are truly affected with a disease or if the test result was a [[false positive]]. Follow-up testing is typically coordinated between [[geneticists]] and the infant's [[pediatrician]] or [[primary care physician]].\n\n==History==\n[[Robert Guthrie]] is given much of the credit for pioneering the earliest screening for [[phenylketonuria]] in the late 1960s using a bacterial inhibition assay (BIA) to measure phenylalanine levels in [[blood]] samples obtained by pricking a newborn baby's heel on the second day of life on [[filter paper]].<ref name=\"pmid11728413\">{{cite journal| author = Clague A| author2 = Thomas A| title = Neonatal biochemical screening for disease| journal = Clin.

They also developed an evidence-based review process for the addition of conditions in the future.  The implementation of this panel across the United States meant all babies born would be screened for the same number of conditions. This recommendation is not binding for individual states, and some states may screen for disorders that are not included on this list of recommended disorders. Prior to this, babies born in different states had received different levels of screening.  On April 24, 2008, President George W. Bush signed into law the [[Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2007]]. This act was enacted to increase awareness among parents, health professionals, and the public on testing newborns to identify certain disorders. It also sought to improve, expand, and enhance current newborn screening programs at the state level.\n\n==Inclusion of disorders==\nNewborn screening programs initially used [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] criteria based largely on criteria established by JMG Wilson and F.

The four criteria from the publication that were relied upon when making decisions for early newborn screening programs were: \n# having an acceptable treatment protocol in place that changes the outcome for patients diagnosed early with the disease\n# an understanding of the condition's natural history\n# an understanding about who will be treated as a patient\n# a screening test that is reliable for both affected and unaffected patients and is acceptable to the public<ref name=screeningduchenne>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = L.

An Australian study found a 74% reduction in episodes of severe metabolic decompensation or death among individuals identified by newborn screening as having MCADD versus those who presented clinically prior to screening.  Studies in the Netherlands and United Kingdom found improvements in outcome at a reduced cost when infants were identified before presenting clinically.<ref name=faoreview />\n\nNewborn screening programs have also expanded the information base available about some rare conditions.  Prior to its inclusion in newborn screening, [[short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency]] (SCADD) was thought to be life-threatening.

Screening for CH is done by measuring [[thyroxin]] (T4), [[thyrotropin]] (TSH) or a combination of both analytes.  Elevated [[17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone]] (17\u03b1-OHP) is the primary marker used when screening for CAH, most commonly done using [[ELISA|enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays]], with many programs using a second tier [[tandem mass spectrometry]] test to reduce the number of [[false positive]] results.<ref name=endocrinopathies />  Careful analysis of screening results for CAH may also identify cases of [[congenital adrenal hypoplasia]], which presents with extremely low levels of 17\u03b1-OHP.<ref name=endocrinopathies />\n\nCH was added to many newborn screening programs in the 1970s, often as the second condition included after PKU.  The most common cause of CH is dysgenesis of the [[thyroid gland]]  After many years of newborn screening, the incidence of CH worldwide had been estimated at 1:3600 births, with no obvious increases in specific ethnic groups.  Recent data from certain regions have shown an increase, with New York reporting an incidence of 1:1700.  Reasons for the apparent increase in incidence have been studied, but no explanation has been found.<ref name=endocrinopathies />\n\nClassic CAH, the disorder targeted by newborn screening programs, is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme [[steroid 21-hydroxylase]] and comes in two forms \u2013 simple virilizing and a salt-wasting form.  The incidence of CAH can vary greatly between populations.  The highest reported incidence rates are among the Yupic Eskimos of Alaska (1:280) and on the French island of [[R\u00e9union]] (1:2100).<ref name=endocrinopathies />\n\n===Hemoglobinopathies===\n[[File:Sickle cells.jpg|thumb|Sickle cells in human blood: both normal red blood cells and sickle-shaped cells are present]] \nAny condition that results in the production of abnormal [[hemoglobin]] is included under the broad category of [[hemoglobinopathies]].

As a group, they are heterogenous, with screening only being feasible for a small fraction of the approximately 40 identified disorders.

Early identification allows these patients and their families to access the necessary resources to help them maximize their developmental outcomes.<ref name=hearingreview />\n\nNewborn hearing testing is done at the bedside using transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions, automated auditory brainstem responses, or a combination of both techniques.  Hearing screening programs have found the initial testing to cost between $10.20 and $23.37 per baby, depending on the technology used.<ref name=hearingreview />  As these are screening tests only, [[false positive]] results will occur. False positive results could be due to user error, a fussy baby, environmental noise in the testing room, or fluid or congestion in the outer/middle ear of the baby.  A review of hearing screening programs found varied initial referral rates (screen positive results) from 0.6% to 16.7%.  The highest overall incidence of hearing loss detection was 0.517%.<ref name=hearingreview />  A significant proportion of screen positive infants were [[lost to follow-up]] before a diagnosis could be confirmed or ruled out in all screening programs.<ref name=hearingreview />\n\n===Congenital heart defects===\nIn some cases, critical [[congenital heart defect]]s (CCHD) are not identified by prenatal ultrasound or postnatal physical examination. [[Pulse oximetry]] has been recently added as a bedside screening test for CCHD<ref name=pulseoxreview /> at 24 to 48 hours after birth. However, not all heart problems can be detected by this method, which relies only on blood oxygen levels.\n\nWhen a baby tests positive, urgent subsequent examination, such as [[echocardiography]], is undergone to determine the cause of low oxygen levels. Babies diagnosed with CCHD are then seen by [[cardiologist]]s.\n\n===Severe combined immunodeficiency===\n[[Severe combined immunodeficiency]] (SCID) caused by [[T-cell]] deficiency is a disorder that was recently added to newborn screening programs in some regions of the United States.

Many jurisdictions around the world have screened for, or attempted to screen for DMD using elevated levels of [[creatine kinase]] measured in dried blood spots.  Because universal newborn screening for DMD has not been undertaken, affected individuals often have a significant delay in diagnosis.  As treatment options for DMD become more and more effective, interest in adding a newborn screening test increases.  At various times since 1978, DMD has been included (often as a pilot study on a small subset of the population) in newborn screening programs in [[Edinburgh]], [[Germany]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Wales]], [[Cyprus]], [[Belgium]] and the [[United States]].

This includes date and time of birth, date and time of sample collection, the infant's weight and gestational age.  The form will also have information about whether the baby has had a blood transfusion and any additional nutrition the baby may have received ([[total parenteral nutrition]]).  Most newborn screening cards also include contact information for the infant's physician in cases where follow up screening or treatment is needed.  The Canadian province of [[Quebec]] performs newborn screening on whole blood samples collected as in most other jurisdictions, and also runs a voluntary [[urine]] screening program where parents collect a sample at 21 days of age and submit it to a provincial laboratory for an additional panel of conditions.<ref name=quebecblood>{{cite web|title=Newborn blood screening|url=http://www4.gouv.qc.ca/EN/Portail/Citoyens/Evenements/DevenirParent/Pages/progr_depst_neont_sangn.aspx |publisher=Government of Quebec|accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref><ref name=quebecurine>{{cite web|title=Newborn urine screening|url=http://www4.gouv.qc.ca/EN/Portail/Citoyens/Evenements/DevenirParent/Pages/progr_depst_neont_urinr.aspx#|publisher=Government of Quebec|accessdate=2012-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114080750/http://www4.gouv.qc.ca/EN/portail/citoyens/evenements/devenirparent/pages/progr_depst_neont_urinr.aspx|archive-date=2012-01-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nNewborn screening samples are collected from the infant between 24 hours and 7 days after birth, and it is recommended that the infant has fed at least once.  Individual jurisdictions will often have more specific requirements, with some states accepting samples collected at 12 hours, and others recommending to wait until 48 hours of life or later.  Each laboratory will have its own criteria on when a sample is acceptable, or if another would need to be collected.  Samples can be collected at the hospital, or by [[midwife|midwives]].  Samples are transported daily to the laboratory responsible for testing.  In the United States and Canada, newborn screening is mandatory, with an option for parents to opt out of the screening in writing if they desire.  In many regions, NBS is mandatory, with an option for parents to opt out in writing if they choose not to have their infant screened.<ref name=spotoftrouble>{{Cite journal | last1 = Carmichael | first1 = M. | title = Newborn screening: A spot of trouble | doi = 10.1038/475156a | journal = Nature | volume = 475 | issue = 7355 | pages = 156\u2013158 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21753828 | pmc = }}</ref>  In most of Europe, newborn screening is done with the consent of the parents.

As [[mass spectrometry]] became more widely available, the technology allowed rapid determination of a number of acylcarnitines and [[amino acid]]s from a single dried blood spot.  This increased the number of conditions that could be detected by newborn screening.  Enzyme assays are used to screen for [[galactosemia]] and [[biotinidase deficiency]].  Immunoassays measure [[thyroid hormones]] for the diagnosis of [[congenital hypothyroidism]] and [[17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone]] for the diagnosis of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]].  Molecular techniques are used for the diagnosis of [[cystic fibrosis]] and [[severe combined immunodeficiency]].\n\n===Reporting results===\nThe goal is to report the results within a short period of time. If screens are normal, a paper report is sent to the submitting hospital and parents rarely hear about it.  If an abnormality is detected, employees of the agency, usually nurses, begin to try to reach the physician, hospital, and/or nursery by telephone. They are persistent until they can arrange an evaluation of the infant by an appropriate specialist physician (depending on the disease). The specialist will attempt to confirm the diagnosis by repeating the tests by a different method or laboratory, or by performing other corroboratory or disproving tests. The confirmatory test varies depending on the positive results on the initial screen. Confirmatory testing can include analyte specific assays to confirm any elevations detected, functional studies to determine enzyme activity, and genetic testing to identify disease-causing mutations.  In some cases, a positive newborn screen can also trigger testing on other family members, such as siblings who did not undergo newborn screening for the same condition or the baby's mother, as some maternal conditions can be identified through results on the baby's newborn screen.  Depending on the likelihood of the diagnosis and the risk of delay, the specialist will initiate treatment and provide information to the family. Performance of the program is reviewed regularly and strenuous efforts are made to maintain a system that catches every infant with these diagnoses.  Guidelines for newborn screening and follow up have been published by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = | year = 2008 | title = Newborn Screening Expands: Recommendations for Pediatricians and Medical Homes-Implications for the | url = http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2007-3021 | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 121 | issue = 1| pages = 192\u2013217 }}</ref> and the [[American College of Medical Genetics]].<ref name=acmgactsheets>{{cite web|title=ACMG NBS ACT Sheets|url= http://www.acmg.net/AM/Template.cfm?Section=NBS_ACT_Sheets_and_Algorithms_Table&Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&ContentID=7090|publisher=[[American College of Medical Genetics]]|accessdate=2012-08-12}}</ref>\n\n==Laboratory performance==\nNewborn screening programs participate in [[quality control]] programs as in any other laboratory, with some notable exceptions.  Much of the success of newborn screening programs is dependent on the filter paper used for the collection of the samples.  Initial studies using Robert Guthrie's test for PKU reported high false positive rates that were attributed to a poorly selected type of filter paper.<ref name=qualitycontrol>{{Cite journal | last1 = De Jes\u00fas | first1 = V.

In most regions, the newborn screening card (which contains demographic information as well as attached filter paper for blood collection) is supplied by the organization carrying out the testing, to remove variations from this source.<ref name=qualitycontrol />\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===Controversy===\nNewborn screening tests have become a subject of political controversy in the last decade.  Lawsuits, media attention, and advocacy groups have surfaced a number of different, and possibly countervailing, positions on the use of screening tests.  Some have asked for government mandates to widen the extent of the screening to find detectable and treatable birth defects.  Others have opposed mandatory screening concerned that effective follow-up and treatment may not be available, or that [[false positive]] screening tests may cause harm to infants and their families.  Others have learned that government agencies were often secretly storing the results in databases for future genetic research, often without consent of the parents nor limits on how the data could be used in the future.\n\n==== Increasing mandatory tests in California ====\nMany rare diseases have not historically been tested for or testing that has been available has not been mandatory.  One such disease is [[Glutaric aciduria type 1|glutaric acidemia type I]], a neurometabolic disease present in approximately 1 out of every 100,000 live births.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hoffmann |first1=Georg |title=Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency |url=https://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/Disease_Search.php?lng=EN&data_id=3564&Disease_Disease_Search_diseaseGroup=231670&Disease_Disease_Search_diseaseType=MIM&Disease%28s%29/group%20of%20diseases=Glutaric-aciduria-type-1&title=Glutaric-aciduria-type-1&searc |website=Orphanet |publisher=The portal for rare diseases and orphan drugs |accessdate=21 December 2019}}</ref> A short-term California testing pilot project in 2003 and 2004 demonstrated the cost of forgoing rare disease testing on newborns.  While both Zachary Wyvill and Zachary Black were both born with the same disease during the pilot program, Wyvill's birth hospital tested only for four state-mandated diseases while Black was born at a hospital participating in the pilot program.  Wyvill's disease went undetected for over six months during which irreversible damage occurred but Black's disease was treated with diet and vitamin supplements.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Waldholz |first1=Michael |title=Testing Fate: A Drop of Blood Saves One Baby; Another Falls Ill; |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB108741631056839034 |accessdate=21 December 2019 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=17 June 2004}}</ref>  Both sets of parents became advocates for expanded neonatal testing and testified in favor of expanding [[tandem mass spectrometry]] (MS/MS) testing of newborns for rare diseases.

When states choose to run their own programs the initial costs for equipment, training and new staff can be significant. Moreover, MS/MS gives only the screening result and not the confirmatory result. The same has to be further done by higher technologies or procedure like GC/MS{{clarify|perhaps just expand the esoteric acronym|date=December 2019}}, Enzyme Assays or DNA Tests. This in effect adds more cost burden and makes physicians lose precious time.{{according to whom|date=December 2019}} To avoid at least a portion of the up front costs, some states such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20080907092110/http://www.savebabies.org/states/mississippi.php Mississippi] have chosen to contract with private labs for expanded screening.  Others have chosen to form [https://web.archive.org/web/20080808121643/http://www.umassmed.edu/nbs Regional Partnerships] sharing both costs and resources.\n\nBut for many states, screening has become an integrated part of the department of health which can not or will not be easily replaced.  Thus the initial expenditures can be difficult for states with tight budgets to justify.  Screening fees have also increased in recent years as health care costs rise and as more states add MS/MS screening to their programs.
