Through her work she creates what she calls \"anthropomorphic individuals.\" Although abstract and formal, she feels they have human-like aspects within their minimal state, made of simple line and gesture. In reference to her minimalist paintings, Louden has been called \"the Robert Ryman of the 21st century.\"<ref>https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E6DD123EF931A25751C0A9609C8B63</ref>\n\nLouden has become known for her large-scale installations using aluminum in both public and museum forums. Upon completion of an exhibition of suspended aluminum in early 2017 entitled, \"Windows,\" at the [[Tweed Museum of Art]],<ref>http://www.d.umn.edu/tma/exhibitions/Sharon_Louden_2015/index.html</ref> she was commissioned for a permanent installation using suspended aluminum in the lobby of a public building in Houston, TX. In October 2011, Louden's installation ''Merge'' opened at the [[Weisman Art Museum]] in Minneapolis, Minnesota.<ref>http://weisman.umn.edu/event/sympathies</ref> ''Merge'' was created in dialogue with the Frank Gehry designed new addition to the Weisman Art Museum in Minneapolis, MN.

Of ''Merge'', Janet Koplos of ''Art in America'' writes \"...the energetic ''Merge'', perhaps Louden\u2019s best work to date, clearly succeeds on its own merits and would be satisfying anywhere.\"<ref>http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/reviews/sharon-louden/</ref>\n\nLouden's work is held in major public and private collections including the Whitney Museum of American Art, National Gallery of Art, Neuberger Museum of Art, Arkansas Arts Center, Yale University Art Gallery, Weatherspoon Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, among others.

Inspired by many artists, including Shel Silverstein, animation has become an important aspect to the development of Louden's overall visual language.\n\nHer first series of animations were included in a 2006 solo exhibition entitled \"Character,\" which was a survey of paintings, drawings, installation, prints and animation at the Neuberger Museum of Art, curated by Dede Young. Also in 2006, \"Pool\" was included in the Art Video Lounge exhibition curated by Michael Rush for the Art Basel Miami Art Fair. Since then, Louden has continued making animations, including her latest - \"Untitled (in dialogue with Len Lye, \"Free Radicals\")\" completed in 2017.\n\nMany of her animations were surveyed in various children's film festivals in the US in 2008-2009. In particular, \"The Bridge,\" completed in 2008, was shown at the Birmingham Museum of Art, Weatherspoon Art Museum, Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University and Gallery Joe in Philadelphia, PA. It was also screened at the Queens International Film Festival and the New York Downtown Film Festival Audience Choice Screening in 2009. Because of positive audience response at the screening, \"The Bridge\" was selected for inclusion in the New York Downtown Film Festival in 2010. Her animations have also been shown in many more film festivals nationally and abroad, including the Athens International Film and Video Festival in Athens, OH and the Honolulu International Film Festival, where she received an award for Excellence in Filmmaking in 2009. In 2010, Louden was the recipient of the Bronze Palm Award from the Mexico International Film Festival for \"The Bridge.\"\n\nBetween 2011 and 2017, Louden was commissioned by the [[National Gallery of Art]] to both create new animations and to help curate three film screenings of abstract animation: ''Cin\u00e9-Concert: Art in Motion!'' (2011), ''Cin\u00e9-Concert: Abstract Film Since 1970'' (2013), and ''Cin\u00e9-Concert: Contemporary Experiments in Animation'' (2017).

Through her work she creates what she calls \"anthropomorphic individuals.\" Although abstract and formal, she feels they have human-like aspects within their minimal state, made of simple line and gesture. In reference to her minimalist paintings, Louden has been called \"the Robert Ryman of the 21st century.\"<ref>https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E6DD123EF931A25751C0A9609C8B63</ref>\n\nLouden has become known for her large-scale installations using aluminum in both public and museum forums.

Inspired by many artists, including Shel Silverstein, animation has become an important aspect to the development of Louden's overall visual language.\n\nHer first series of animations were included in a 2006 solo exhibition entitled \"Character,\" which was a survey of paintings, drawings, installation, prints and animation at the Neuberger Museum of Art, curated by Dede Young. Also in 2006, \"Pool\" was included in the Art Video Lounge exhibition curated by Michael Rush for the Art Basel Miami Art Fair. Since then, Louden has continued making animations, including her latest - \"Untitled (in dialogue with Len Lye, \"Free Radicals\")\" completed in 2017.\n\nMany of her animations were surveyed in various children's film festivals in the US in 2008-2009. In particular, \"The Bridge,\" completed in 2008, was shown at the Birmingham Museum of Art, Weatherspoon Art Museum, Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University and Gallery Joe in Philadelphia, PA. It was also screened at the Queens International Film Festival and the New York Downtown Film Festival Audience Choice Screening in 2009. Because of positive audience response at the screening, \"The Bridge\" was selected for inclusion in the New York Downtown Film Festival in 2010. Her animations have also been shown in many more film festivals nationally and abroad, including the Athens International Film and Video Festival in Athens, OH and the Honolulu International Film Festival, where she received an award for Excellence in Filmmaking in 2009.

He began to produce works which emphasized the picture-as-object, rather than the picture as a representation of something, be it something in the physical world, or something in the artist's emotional world. Stella married [[Barbara Rose]], later a well-known art critic, in 1961. Around this time he said that a picture was \"a flat surface with paint on it \u2013 nothing more\". This was a departure from the technique of creating a painting by first making a sketch. Many of the works are created by simply using the path of the brush stroke, very often using common house paint.\n\nThis new aesthetic found expression in a series of new paintings, the Black Paintings (1959) in which regular bands of black paint were separated by very thin pinstripes of unpainted canvas. ''[[Die Fahne Hoch! (Frank Stella)|Die Fahne Hoch!]]'' (1959) is one such painting. It takes its name (\"The Raised Banner\" in English) from the first line of the [[Horst-Wessel-Lied]], the anthem of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]], and Stella pointed out that it is in the same proportions as banners used by that organization. It has been suggested that the title has a double meaning, referring also to Jasper Johns' paintings of flags. In any case, its emotional coolness belies the contentiousness its title might suggest, reflecting this new direction in Stella's work. Stella's art was recognized for its innovations before he was twenty-five. In 1959, several of his paintings were included in \"Three Young Americans\" at the [[Allen Memorial Art Museum]] at [[Oberlin College]], as well as in \"Sixteen Americans\" at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York (60).\n\nFrom 1960 Stella began to produce paintings in aluminium and copper paint which, in their presentation of regular lines of color separated by pinstripes, are similar to his black paintings. However they use a wider range of colors, and are his first works using [[shaped canvas]]es (canvases in a shape other than the traditional rectangle or square), often being in L, N, U or T-shapes. These later developed into more elaborate designs, in the ''Irregular Polygon'' series (67), for example.\n\nAlso in the 1960s, Stella began to use a wider range of colors, typically arranged in straight or curved lines. Later he began his ''Protractor Series'' (71) of paintings, in which [[circle|arcs]], sometimes overlapping, within square borders are arranged side-by-side to produce full and half circles painted in rings of concentric color. These paintings are named after circular cities he had visited while in the Middle East earlier in the 1960s. The Irregular Polygon canvases and Protractor series further extended the concept of the [[shaped canvas]].\n\n===Late 1960s and early 1970s===\n[[File:Frank Stella's 'Harran II', 1967.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Frank Stella ''Harran II'', 1967]]\nStella began his extended engagement with printmaking in the mid-1960s, working first with master printer Kenneth Tyler at Gemini G.E.L. Stella produced a series of prints during the late 1960s starting with a print called ''Quathlamba I'' in 1968. Stella's abstract prints used [[lithography]], [[screenprinting]], [[etching]] and [[offset lithography]].\n\nIn 1967, he designed the set and costumes for Scramble, a dance piece by [[Merce Cunningham]]. The [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York presented a retrospective of Stella's work in 1970, making him the youngest artist to receive one.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} During the following decade, Stella introduced relief into his art, which he came to call \"maximalist\" painting for its [[Sculpture|sculptural]] qualities. The shaped canvases took on even less regular forms in the ''Eccentric Polygon'' series, and elements of [[collage]] were introduced, pieces of canvas being pasted onto [[plywood]], for example. His work also became more three-dimensional to the point where he started producing large, free-standing metal pieces, which, although they are painted upon, might well be considered sculpture. After introducing wood and other materials in the Polish Village series (73), created in high relief, he began to use aluminum as the primary support for his paintings. As the 1970s and 1980s progressed, these became more elaborate and exuberant. Indeed, his earlier Minimalism [more] became baroque, marked by curving forms, [[Day-Glo]] colors, and scrawled brushstrokes. Similarly, his prints of these decades combined various printmaking and drawing techniques. In 1973, he had a print studio installed in his New York house. In 1976, Stella was commissioned by [[BMW]] to paint a [[BMW 3.0 CSL]] for the second installment in the [[BMW Art Car]] Project. He has said of this project, \"The starting point for the art cars was racing livery. In the old days there used to be a tradition of identifying a car with its country by color. Now they get a number and they get advertising. It's a paint job, one way or another. The idea for mine was that it's from a drawing on graph paper. The graph paper is what it is, a graph, but when it's morphed over the car's forms it becomes interesting, and adapting the drawing to the racing car's forms is interesting. Theoretically it's like painting on a shaped canvas.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn 1969, Stella was commissioned to create a logo for the [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial]]. Medals incorporating the design were struck to mark the occasion.<ref>[http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Trescher_Centennial_records_b18234550.pdf Finding aid for the George Trescher records related to The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial, 1949, 1960\u20131971 (bulk 1967\u20131970)].

Guggenheim Museum]], New York.</ref> During this time, the increasingly deep relief of Stella's paintings gave way to full three-dimensionality, with sculptural forms derived from cones, pillars, French curves, waves, and decorative architectural elements. To create these works, the artist used collages or maquettes that were then enlarged and re-created with the aids of assistants, industrial metal cutters, and digital technologies.<ref name=\"Frank Stella\"/>  ''La scienza della pigrizia'' (''The Science of Laziness''), from 1984, is an example of Stella's transition from two-dimensionality to three-dimensionality.

His 1993 proposal for a [[Kunsthalle]] and garden in Dresden did not come to fruition.

He began to produce works which emphasized the picture-as-object, rather than the picture as a representation of something, be it something in the physical world, or something in the artist's emotional world. Stella married [[Barbara Rose]], later a well-known art critic, in 1961. Around this time he said that a picture was \"a flat surface with paint on it \u2013 nothing more\". This was a departure from the technique of creating a painting by first making a sketch. Many of the works are created by simply using the path of the brush stroke, very often using common house paint.\n\nThis new aesthetic found expression in a series of new paintings, the Black Paintings (1959) in which regular bands of black paint were separated by very thin pinstripes of unpainted canvas. ''[[Die Fahne Hoch! (Frank Stella)|Die Fahne Hoch!]]'' (1959) is one such painting. It takes its name (\"The Raised Banner\" in English) from the first line of the [[Horst-Wessel-Lied]], the anthem of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]], and Stella pointed out that it is in the same proportions as banners used by that organization. It has been suggested that the title has a double meaning, referring also to Jasper Johns' paintings of flags. In any case, its emotional coolness belies the contentiousness its title might suggest, reflecting this new direction in Stella's work. Stella's art was recognized for its innovations before he was twenty-five. In 1959, several of his paintings were included in \"Three Young Americans\" at the [[Allen Memorial Art Museum]] at [[Oberlin College]], as well as in \"Sixteen Americans\" at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York (60).\n\nFrom 1960 Stella began to produce paintings in aluminium and copper paint which, in their presentation of regular lines of color separated by pinstripes, are similar to his black paintings. However they use a wider range of colors, and are his first works using [[shaped canvas]]es (canvases in a shape other than the traditional rectangle or square), often being in L, N, U or T-shapes. These later developed into more elaborate designs, in the ''Irregular Polygon'' series (67), for example.\n\nAlso in the 1960s, Stella began to use a wider range of colors, typically arranged in straight or curved lines. Later he began his ''Protractor Series'' (71) of paintings, in which [[circle|arcs]], sometimes overlapping, within square borders are arranged side-by-side to produce full and half circles painted in rings of concentric color. These paintings are named after circular cities he had visited while in the Middle East earlier in the 1960s. The Irregular Polygon canvases and Protractor series further extended the concept of the [[shaped canvas]].\n\n===Late 1960s and early 1970s===\n[[File:Frank Stella's 'Harran II', 1967.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Frank Stella ''Harran II'', 1967]]\nStella began his extended engagement with printmaking in the mid-1960s, working first with master printer Kenneth Tyler at Gemini G.E.L. Stella produced a series of prints during the late 1960s starting with a print called ''Quathlamba I'' in 1968. Stella's abstract prints used [[lithography]], [[screenprinting]], [[etching]] and [[offset lithography]].\n\nIn 1967, he designed the set and costumes for Scramble, a dance piece by [[Merce Cunningham]]. The [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York presented a retrospective of Stella's work in 1970, making him the youngest artist to receive one.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} During the following decade, Stella introduced relief into his art, which he came to call \"maximalist\" painting for its [[Sculpture|sculptural]] qualities. The shaped canvases took on even less regular forms in the ''Eccentric Polygon'' series, and elements of [[collage]] were introduced, pieces of canvas being pasted onto [[plywood]], for example. His work also became more three-dimensional to the point where he started producing large, free-standing metal pieces, which, although they are painted upon, might well be considered sculpture. After introducing wood and other materials in the Polish Village series (73), created in high relief, he began to use aluminum as the primary support for his paintings. As the 1970s and 1980s progressed, these became more elaborate and exuberant. Indeed, his earlier Minimalism [more] became baroque, marked by curving forms, [[Day-Glo]] colors, and scrawled brushstrokes. Similarly, his prints of these decades combined various printmaking and drawing techniques. In 1973, he had a print studio installed in his New York house. In 1976, Stella was commissioned by [[BMW]] to paint a [[BMW 3.0 CSL]] for the second installment in the [[BMW Art Car]] Project. He has said of this project, \"The starting point for the art cars was racing livery. In the old days there used to be a tradition of identifying a car with its country by color. Now they get a number and they get advertising. It's a paint job, one way or another. The idea for mine was that it's from a drawing on graph paper. The graph paper is what it is, a graph, but when it's morphed over the car's forms it becomes interesting, and adapting the drawing to the racing car's forms is interesting. Theoretically it's like painting on a shaped canvas.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn 1969, Stella was commissioned to create a logo for the [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial]]. Medals incorporating the design were struck to mark the occasion.<ref>[http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Trescher_Centennial_records_b18234550.pdf Finding aid for the George Trescher records related to The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial, 1949, 1960\u20131971 (bulk 1967\u20131970)].

Guggenheim Museum]], New York.</ref> During this time, the increasingly deep relief of Stella's paintings gave way to full three-dimensionality, with sculptural forms derived from cones, pillars, French curves, waves, and decorative architectural elements. To create these works, the artist used collages or maquettes that were then enlarged and re-created with the aids of assistants, industrial metal cutters, and digital technologies.<ref name=\"Frank Stella\"/>  ''La scienza della pigrizia'' (''The Science of Laziness''), from 1984, is an example of Stella's transition from two-dimensionality to three-dimensionality.

In 1993, for example, he created the entire decorative scheme for [[Toronto]]\u2019s [[Princess of Wales Theatre]], which includes a 10,000-square-foot [[mural]]. His 1993 proposal for a [[Kunsthalle]] and garden in Dresden did not come to fruition. In 1997, he painted and oversaw the installation of the 5,000-square-foot \"Stella Project\" which serves as the centerpiece of the theater and lobby of the Moores Opera House located at the [[Rebecca and John J.

Bad faith can be shown only if a rights holder finds out about the infringement and then goes to federal court to determine whether the infringer has failed to conduct an adequate search. Few artists can afford the costs of federal litigation: attorneys\u2019 fees in our country vastly exceed the licensing fee for a typical painting or drawing.\n\nThe Copyright Office proposal would have a disproportionately negative, even catastrophic, impact on the ability of painters and illustrators to make a living from selling copies of their work...

Steadward helped organize the first Canadian wheelchair sport national championships in 1968, and later coached Canada in [[wheelchair basketball]] at the [[Summer Paralympics]]. He became a professor at the [[University of Alberta]] in 1971, later served as chairman of the Department of Athletics, and published more than 150 papers about disability sport. He was the founding president of the Alberta Wheelchair Sports Association in 1971, founded the Research and Training Centre for Athletes with Disabilities in 1978, served as president of the [[Canadian Paralympic Committee]] from 1984 to 1990, and later became a member of the [[Canadian Olympic Committee]].\n\nSteadward became the first president of the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) in 1989, after a successful campaign to consolidate international disability sport organizations. He signed a memorandum of understanding with [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] of the [[International Olympic Committee]] during the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] which united the Paralympic movement with the [[Olympic Games]] movement, and saw one city host both events. During his tenure as president of the IPC, the organization grew from 37 to 172 national federations, and the [[Paralympic Games]] grew in popularity. The [[Commonwealth Games]] subsequently integrated disabled sports into its program, as a result of his efforts. His career has been recognized with the [[Order of Canada]], the [[Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal]], and the [[Alberta Order of Excellence]]. He has also been inducted into the [[Alberta Sports Hall of Fame]], the [[Canadian Disability Hall of Fame]], and [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nSteadward was born on born May 26, 1946, in [[Eston, Saskatchewan]].<ref name=\"LGofA\">{{cite web |title=Robert D.

Steadward helped organize the first Canadian wheelchair sport national championships in 1968, and later coached Canada in [[wheelchair basketball]] at the [[Summer Paralympics]]. He became a professor at the [[University of Alberta]] in 1971, later served as chairman of the Department of Athletics, and published more than 150 papers about disability sport. He was the founding president of the Alberta Wheelchair Sports Association in 1971, founded the Research and Training Centre for Athletes with Disabilities in 1978, served as president of the [[Canadian Paralympic Committee]] from 1984 to 1990, and later became a member of the [[Canadian Olympic Committee]].\n\nSteadward became the first president of the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) in 1989, after a successful campaign to consolidate international disability sport organizations. He signed a memorandum of understanding with [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] of the [[International Olympic Committee]] during the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] which united the Paralympic movement with the [[Olympic Games]] movement, and saw one city host both events. During his tenure as president of the IPC, the organization grew from 37 to 172 national federations, and the [[Paralympic Games]] grew in popularity. The [[Commonwealth Games]] subsequently integrated disabled sports into its program, as a result of his efforts. His career has been recognized with the [[Order of Canada]], the [[Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal]], and the [[Alberta Order of Excellence]]. He has also been inducted into the [[Alberta Sports Hall of Fame]], the [[Canadian Disability Hall of Fame]], and [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nSteadward was born on born May 26, 1946, in [[Eston, Saskatchewan]].<ref name=\"LGofA\">{{cite web |title=Robert D.

''Tucker''{{'}}s [[main battery]] consisted of five [[Dual-purpose gun|dual-purpose]] [[38 caliber 5-inch (127 mm) guns]].\n\nFirst assigned to the [[United States Battle Fleet]] in San Diego, California, ''Tucker'' operated along the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. After participating in [[naval exercise]]s in the [[Caribbean Sea]], she returned to duty in [[Territory of Hawaii|Hawaii]]. She then went on a goodwill tour to New Zealand, returning to Hawaii and docking at [[Pearl Harbor]]. When the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7{{nbsp}}December 1941, ''Tucker'' was undergoing an overhaul but sustained no damage. Soon afterward, she  began escorting convoys between the West Coast and Hawaii. ''Tucker'' was then tasked with escort duty to islands in the [[South Pacific Ocean|Sourth Pacific]].\n\n''Tucker'' steamed out of port on 1 August 1942, escorting a cargo ship to [[Espiritu Santo]]. They entered its harbor on 4 August, where they had, unknowingly, moved into a [[minefield]] laid by the US Navy. ''Tucker'' struck at least one [[Naval mine|mine]] and was torn almost in two, killing three sailors. The rest of the crew survived but the destroyer sank. ''Tucker'' had not been informed of the minefield. \n\n==Design==\n\n===General characteristics===  \n''Tucker'' [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|1500|LT|t|0|lk=on}}\nat [[standard load]] and {{convert|1725|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship's [[length overall|overall length]] was {{convert|341|ft|m|1}}, her [[beam (nautical)|beam]] was {{convert|35|ft|6|in|m|1}}, and her [[draft (hull)|draft]] was {{convert|10|ft|7|in|m|1}}. Her peace-time complement was 158 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Friedman|2004|pp=465\u2013466}}\n\nShe had a [[Tripod mast|tripod]] [[foremast]] and a pole mainmast. To improve the [[antiaircraft]] [[field of fire (weaponry)|field of fire]], her [[tripod]] foremast was constructed without nautical [[rigging]].{{sfn|Friedman|2004|p=88}} The destroyer was fitted with emergency [[diesel generators]], replacing the storage batteries of earlier destroyers. Gun crew shelters were also built fore and aft for the superimposed guns. A third set of quadruple [[torpedo tubes]] was added, with one mounted on the [[centerline]] and two in the side positions.{{sfn |Friedman|2004|p=88}}\n\n===Machinery and armament===\n''Tucker'' was fitted with four [[water-tube boiler]]s built by either [[Babcock & Wilcox]] or [[Foster Wheeler]]. They generated the steam that propelled the two [[General Electric]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, developing {{convert|46,000|shp|abbr=on|lk=on}} for a maximum speed of {{convert|37|kn|lk=in}}. ''Tucker'' carried a maximum of {{convert|523|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]], with a trial range of {{convert|7300|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn|lk=in}}. The ship's\nwartime ranges were {{convert|6940|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn|lk=in}} and {{convert|4360|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|20|kn|lk=in}}.\nThe ship's design incorporated a new generation of land-based propulsion machinery. The boilers were capable of reaching {{convert|650\u2013700|F|C|sigfig=2}}, powering the high-pressure turbines with [[double reduction gearing|double reduction gears]] that enabled the turbines to run faster and more efficiently than in previous destroyer designs.{{sfn|Friedman|2004|p=88}}\n\n''Tucker''{{'}}s [[main battery]] consisted of five [[Dual-purpose gun|dual-purpose]] [[38 caliber 5-inch (127 mm) guns]], equipped with the MK{{nbsp}}33 gun [[fire-control system]].{{sfn|Friedman|2004|p=465}} Each gun was configured for surface and aerial targets.{{sfn |Friedman|2004| p=88}} The ship's antiaircraft battery had four water-cooled [[.50 caliber machine gun]]s (12.7&nbsp;mm).{{sfn|Hodges|Friedman|1979|p=111}} The ship was fitted with three quadruple torpedo-tube mounts for twelve {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo]]es, guided by the Mark{{nbsp}}27 torpedo fire-control system.{{sfn|Friedman|2004|p=465}} She was rigged for two [[depth charge]] roll-off racks and for depth charge projectors (K-guns).{{sfn|Friedman|2004|p=86}} In early 1942, the Navy began to refit the ''Mahan''-class destroyers with new antiaircraft armament, although most of the class was not refitted until sometime in 1944.{{sfn|Hodges|Friedman|1979|p=145}}\n\n==Construction and service history==\n\n''Tucker'' was one of eighteen [[Mahan-class destroyer|Mahan-class destroyers]] and was built at the [[Norfolk Navy Yard]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia]].{{sfn|Conway's|1980|pp=125\u2013126}} She was the second vessel to be named for [[Samuel Tucker]], who had been an officer in the [[Continental Navy]] and the United States Navy.{{sfn|Parkin|1996|p=67}} ''Tucker''{{'}}s [[keel]] was laid down on 15{{nbsp}}August 1934. She was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 26{{nbsp}}February 1936 and [[Christening|christened]] by a third cousin of Tucker. The ship was commissioned in the United States Navy on 23{{nbsp}}July, with [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] George T. Howard in command.{{sfn|Parkin|1996|p=68-69}}\n\n[[File:USS Tucker.jpg|thumb|alt=Naval warship rigged with sails|''Tucker'' rigged with sails, June 1940]]\nAfter her [[shakedown cruise]], she joined destroyer forces attached to the United States Battle Fleet in [[San Diego]], [[California]]. She operated with them along the West Coast and in the Hawaiian islands as part of Destroyer Squadron{{nbsp}}3 of the Destroyer Division.\nIn February 1939, she took part in [[Fleet Problem&nbsp;XX]], a naval exercise held in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean and observed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. As tensions with Japan increased, the fleet was ordered to return to Hawaiian waters.{{sfn|NHHC}}\n\nIn June 1940, ''Tucker'' steamed from Hawaii to a location east of [[Wake Island]] for fleet exercises. In ''United States Navy Destroyers of World War II,'' John Reilly, Jr. described the uncommon method used to power the vessel on its return to Hawaii: {{blockquote|... Tucker stretched her fuel supply by rigging Sails. Her homemade [[foresail]] and [[mainsail]] moved Tucker at an estimated 3.4 knots, letting her maintain [[Glossary of nautical terms#steerageway|steerageway]] as she loitered on station several days.{{sfn|Reilly|1983|p=30}}}}\n\n''Tucker'' continued operating between Hawaii and the West Coast into February 1941. She then set course for New Zealand on a goodwill tour, arriving in [[Auckland]] on 17 March. Returning to Pearl Harbor, she took part in routine exercises at sea before returning to her homeport of San Diego on 19{{nbsp}}September. After a short stay, ''Tucker'' steamed to Hawaii in November as part of Task Force{{nbsp}}19, operating again in the Hawaiian Islands. Shortly afterward, she put into Pearl Harbor for an overhaul by a [[destroyer tender]].{{sfn|NHHC}}\n\nWhen the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, ''Tucker'' was one of five destroyers moored at berth X\u20139, East Loch, alongside the destroyer tender {{USS|Whitney|AD-4|2}}.{{sfn|Roscoe|1953|pp=47\u201348}} Even before ''Tucker''{{'}}s [[general quarters]] alarm could be sounded, one of her on-deck sailors began firing a 50-caliber machine gun at the first wave of Japanese aircraft. When the second wave attacked, every ship that could opened fire. ''Tucker''{{'}}s gunners scored hits on at least two aircraft: one crashed in a cane field, another in flames disappeared over a mountaintop. Because ''Tucker'' was at Pearl Harbor for overhaul, much of her machinery had been torn down for repairs; despite the crew's efforts, they were unable to get the ship underway until that evening.{{sfn|Parkin|1996|p=68}}\n\nAfter her overhaul, ''Tucker'' patrolled off Pearl Harbor and spent several months escorting convoys between Hawaii and the West Coast. With new orders, she steamed to the South Pacific for convoy duty. ''Tucker'' then escorted the auxiliary ship {{USS|Wright|AV-1|2}} to [[Tutuila]], [[American Samoa]], as part of the drive to fortify outposts. She then escorted her charge to [[Suva]], [[British Fiji|Fiji]], and proceeded to [[Noumea]], [[New Caledonia]]. Steaming on for Australia, she arrived at [[Sydney]] on 27{{nbsp}}April. After taking on fuel, she visited [[Melbourne]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] before steaming back to Sydney. ''Tucker'' and  ''Wright'' returned to Suva, arriving on 3{{nbsp}}June 1942. For the remainder of June and into the first week of July, ''Tucker'' operated out of Suva before relieving the cruiser {{USS|Boise|CL-47|2}} of convoy escort duties on 10{{nbsp}}July. On{{nbsp}}30 July, the ship arrived at Auckland and the following day started back for Suva.{{sfn|NHHC}}\n\n==Fate==\n[[Image:DD-374 sunk 5Aug1942 EspirituSanto NAN09-10-86.jpg|thumb|alt=Naval ship struck by a mine and sinking|USS ''Tucker'' (D-374) sinking south of Espiritu Santo,  5 August 1942]]\n\nOn 1{{nbsp}}August 1942 ''Tucker'' left Suva, escorting the cargo ship SS ''Nira Luckenbach'' to [[Espiritu Santo]], [[New Hebrides]].{{sfn|NHHC}} On 4{{nbsp}}August ''Tucker'' led the cargo ship into the harbor at Espiritu Santo, as she headed into the western entrance, she struck at least one [[Naval mine|mine]]. The explosion tore her hull nearly in two at the [[Funnel (ship)|No.{{nbsp}}1 stack]], killing all three crew members on watch in the forward [[fire room]]. The rest of the ship's company survived.\n''Nira Luckenbach'' and other vessels rescued sailors from their sinking ship. ''Tucker''{{'}}s [[stern]] sank the following morning; a diving party scuttled and sank her [[bow (ship)|bow]].{{sfn|Roscoe|1953|p=165}} The ship had steamed into the [[Segond Channel]] unaware that the minelayers {{USS|Gamble|DD-123|2}}, {{USS|Breese|DD-122|2}}, and {{USS|Tracy|DD-214|2}} had laid mines at its western entrance. An investigation revealed that ''Tucker's'' captain had not been informed of the minefield.{{sfn|Rohwer|2005|p=184}} She was stricken from the ''[[Naval Vessel Register]]'' on 2{{nbsp}}December 1944.{{sfn|NHHC}} ''Tucker''{{'}}s loss was a setback to the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]], which was trying to assemble every available ship for the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]].{{sfn|Roscoe|1953|p=165}}\n\nThree days after ''Tucker'' sank, the seagoing tugboat {{USS|Navajo|AT-64|2}} arrived on site with divers, [[marine salvage|salvaging]] her guns, turbines, anchors and chains. During the remainder of the war, the Navy used the wreckage site for diver training; they did not undertake further salvaging. \nSettling in just {{convert|60|ft}} of water, the ship was easily accessible to private salvors, who harvested anything of value, ransacking and further scattering ''Tucker''{{'}}s remains. Sport divers also had a destructive effect on the site, which by 1997 resembled an \"underwater junkyard\".{{sfn|Stone|1997|pp=78\u201379}} Mike Gerken, an underwater photojournalist, dove the ''Tucker'' wreckage site several times; in 2013 he eulogized ''Tucker'' and other sunken ships:\n\n{{quote\n|text=To see a ship with a distinguished record as the ''Tucker'' in such a poor state gave me pause for thought.

''Tucker''{{'}}s [[main battery]] consisted of five [[Dual-purpose gun|dual-purpose]] [[38 caliber 5-inch (127 mm) guns]].\n\nFirst assigned to the [[United States Battle Fleet]] in San Diego, California, ''Tucker'' operated along the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. After participating in [[naval exercise]]s in the [[Caribbean Sea]], she returned to duty in [[Territory of Hawaii|Hawaii]]. She then went on a goodwill tour to New Zealand, returning to Hawaii and docking at [[Pearl Harbor]]. When the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7{{nbsp}}December 1941, ''Tucker'' was undergoing an overhaul but sustained no damage. Soon afterward, she  began escorting convoys between the West Coast and Hawaii. ''Tucker'' was then tasked with escort duty to islands in the [[South Pacific Ocean|Sourth Pacific]].\n\n''Tucker'' steamed out of port on 1 August 1942, escorting a cargo ship to [[Espiritu Santo]]. They entered its harbor on 4 August, where they had, unknowingly, moved into a [[minefield]] laid by the US Navy. ''Tucker'' struck at least one [[Naval mine|mine]] and was torn almost in two, killing three sailors. The rest of the crew survived but the destroyer sank. ''Tucker'' had not been informed of the minefield. \n\n==Design==\n\n===General characteristics===  \n''Tucker'' [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|1500|LT|t|0|lk=on}}\nat [[standard load]] and {{convert|1725|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship's [[length overall|overall length]] was {{convert|341|ft|m|1}}, her [[beam (nautical)|beam]] was {{convert|35|ft|6|in|m|1}}, and her [[draft (hull)|draft]] was {{convert|10|ft|7|in|m|1}}. Her peace-time complement was 158 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Friedman|2004|pp=465\u2013466}}\n\nShe had a [[Tripod mast|tripod]] [[foremast]] and a pole mainmast. To improve the [[antiaircraft]] [[field of fire (weaponry)|field of fire]], her [[tripod]] foremast was constructed without nautical [[rigging]].{{sfn|Friedman|2004|p=88}} The destroyer was fitted with emergency [[diesel generators]], replacing the storage batteries of earlier destroyers. Gun crew shelters were also built fore and aft for the superimposed guns. A third set of quadruple [[torpedo tubes]] was added, with one mounted on the [[centerline]] and two in the side positions.{{sfn |Friedman|2004|p=88}}\n\n===Machinery and armament===\n''Tucker'' was fitted with four [[water-tube boiler]]s built by either [[Babcock & Wilcox]] or [[Foster Wheeler]]. They generated the steam that propelled the two [[General Electric]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, developing {{convert|46,000|shp|abbr=on|lk=on}} for a maximum speed of {{convert|37|kn|lk=in}}. ''Tucker'' carried a maximum of {{convert|523|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]], with a trial range of {{convert|7300|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn|lk=in}}. The ship's\nwartime ranges were {{convert|6940|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn|lk=in}} and {{convert|4360|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|20|kn|lk=in}}.\nThe ship's design incorporated a new generation of land-based propulsion machinery. The boilers were capable of reaching {{convert|650\u2013700|F|C|sigfig=2}}, powering the high-pressure turbines with [[double reduction gearing|double reduction gears]] that enabled the turbines to run faster and more efficiently than in previous destroyer designs.{{sfn|Friedman|2004|p=88}}\n\n''Tucker''{{'}}s [[main battery]] consisted of five [[Dual-purpose gun|dual-purpose]] [[38 caliber 5-inch (127 mm) guns]], equipped with the MK{{nbsp}}33 gun [[fire-control system]].{{sfn|Friedman|2004|p=465}} Each gun was configured for surface and aerial targets.{{sfn |Friedman|2004| p=88}} The ship's antiaircraft battery had four water-cooled [[.50 caliber machine gun]]s (12.7&nbsp;mm).{{sfn|Hodges|Friedman|1979|p=111}} The ship was fitted with three quadruple torpedo-tube mounts for twelve {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo]]es, guided by the Mark{{nbsp}}27 torpedo fire-control system.{{sfn|Friedman|2004|p=465}} She was rigged for two [[depth charge]] roll-off racks and for depth charge projectors (K-guns).{{sfn|Friedman|2004|p=86}} In early 1942, the Navy began to refit the ''Mahan''-class destroyers with new antiaircraft armament, although most of the class was not refitted until sometime in 1944.{{sfn|Hodges|Friedman|1979|p=145}}\n\n==Construction and service history==\n\n''Tucker'' was one of eighteen [[Mahan-class destroyer|Mahan-class destroyers]] and was built at the [[Norfolk Navy Yard]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia]].{{sfn|Conway's|1980|pp=125\u2013126}} She was the second vessel to be named for [[Samuel Tucker]], who had been an officer in the [[Continental Navy]] and the United States Navy.{{sfn|Parkin|1996|p=67}} ''Tucker''{{'}}s [[keel]] was laid down on 15{{nbsp}}August 1934. She was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 26{{nbsp}}February 1936 and [[Christening|christened]] by a third cousin of Tucker. The ship was commissioned in the United States Navy on 23{{nbsp}}July, with [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] George T. Howard in command.{{sfn|Parkin|1996|p=68-69}}\n\n[[File:USS Tucker.jpg|thumb|alt=Naval warship rigged with sails|''Tucker'' rigged with sails, June 1940]]\nAfter her [[shakedown cruise]], she joined destroyer forces attached to the United States Battle Fleet in [[San Diego]], [[California]]. She operated with them along the West Coast and in the Hawaiian islands as part of Destroyer Squadron{{nbsp}}3 of the Destroyer Division.\nIn February 1939, she took part in [[Fleet Problem&nbsp;XX]], a naval exercise held in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean and observed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. As tensions with Japan increased, the fleet was ordered to return to Hawaiian waters.{{sfn|NHHC}}\n\nIn June 1940, ''Tucker'' steamed from Hawaii to a location east of [[Wake Island]] for fleet exercises. In ''United States Navy Destroyers of World War II,'' John Reilly, Jr. described the uncommon method used to power the vessel on its return to Hawaii: {{blockquote|... Tucker stretched her fuel supply by rigging Sails. Her homemade [[foresail]] and [[mainsail]] moved Tucker at an estimated 3.4 knots, letting her maintain [[Glossary of nautical terms#steerageway|steerageway]] as she loitered on station several days.{{sfn|Reilly|1983|p=30}}}}\n\n''Tucker'' continued operating between Hawaii and the West Coast into February 1941. She then set course for New Zealand on a goodwill tour, arriving in [[Auckland]] on 17 March. Returning to Pearl Harbor, she took part in routine exercises at sea before returning to her homeport of San Diego on 19{{nbsp}}September. After a short stay, ''Tucker'' steamed to Hawaii in November as part of Task Force{{nbsp}}19, operating again in the Hawaiian Islands. Shortly afterward, she put into Pearl Harbor for an overhaul by a [[destroyer tender]].{{sfn|NHHC}}\n\nWhen the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, ''Tucker'' was one of five destroyers moored at berth X\u20139, East Loch, alongside the destroyer tender {{USS|Whitney|AD-4|2}}.{{sfn|Roscoe|1953|pp=47\u201348}} Even before ''Tucker''{{'}}s [[general quarters]] alarm could be sounded, one of her on-deck sailors began firing a 50-caliber machine gun at the first wave of Japanese aircraft. When the second wave attacked, every ship that could opened fire. ''Tucker''{{'}}s gunners scored hits on at least two aircraft: one crashed in a cane field, another in flames disappeared over a mountaintop. Because ''Tucker'' was at Pearl Harbor for overhaul, much of her machinery had been torn down for repairs; despite the crew's efforts, they were unable to get the ship underway until that evening.{{sfn|Parkin|1996|p=68}}\n\nAfter her overhaul, ''Tucker'' patrolled off Pearl Harbor and spent several months escorting convoys between Hawaii and the West Coast. With new orders, she steamed to the South Pacific for convoy duty. ''Tucker'' then escorted the auxiliary ship {{USS|Wright|AV-1|2}} to [[Tutuila]], [[American Samoa]], as part of the drive to fortify outposts. She then escorted her charge to [[Suva]], [[British Fiji|Fiji]], and proceeded to [[Noumea]], [[New Caledonia]]. Steaming on for Australia, she arrived at [[Sydney]] on 27{{nbsp}}April. After taking on fuel, she visited [[Melbourne]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] before steaming back to Sydney. ''Tucker'' and  ''Wright'' returned to Suva, arriving on 3{{nbsp}}June 1942. For the remainder of June and into the first week of July, ''Tucker'' operated out of Suva before relieving the cruiser {{USS|Boise|CL-47|2}} of convoy escort duties on 10{{nbsp}}July. On{{nbsp}}30 July, the ship arrived at Auckland and the following day started back for Suva.{{sfn|NHHC}}\n\n==Fate==\n[[Image:DD-374 sunk 5Aug1942 EspirituSanto NAN09-10-86.jpg|thumb|alt=Naval ship struck by a mine and sinking|USS ''Tucker'' (D-374) sinking south of Espiritu Santo,  5 August 1942]]\n\nOn 1{{nbsp}}August 1942 ''Tucker'' left Suva, escorting the cargo ship SS ''Nira Luckenbach'' to [[Espiritu Santo]], [[New Hebrides]].{{sfn|NHHC}} On 4{{nbsp}}August ''Tucker'' led the cargo ship into the harbor at Espiritu Santo, as she headed into the western entrance, she struck at least one [[Naval mine|mine]]. The explosion tore her hull nearly in two at the [[Funnel (ship)|No.{{nbsp}}1 stack]], killing all three crew members on watch in the forward [[fire room]]. The rest of the ship's company survived.\n''Nira Luckenbach'' and other vessels rescued sailors from their sinking ship. ''Tucker''{{'}}s [[stern]] sank the following morning; a diving party scuttled and sank her [[bow (ship)|bow]].{{sfn|Roscoe|1953|p=165}} The ship had steamed into the [[Segond Channel]] unaware that the minelayers {{USS|Gamble|DD-123|2}}, {{USS|Breese|DD-122|2}}, and {{USS|Tracy|DD-214|2}} had laid mines at its western entrance. An investigation revealed that ''Tucker's'' captain had not been informed of the minefield.{{sfn|Rohwer|2005|p=184}} She was stricken from the ''[[Naval Vessel Register]]'' on 2{{nbsp}}December 1944.{{sfn|NHHC}} ''Tucker''{{'}}s loss was a setback to the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]], which was trying to assemble every available ship for the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]].{{sfn|Roscoe|1953|p=165}}\n\nThree days after ''Tucker'' sank, the seagoing tugboat {{USS|Navajo|AT-64|2}} arrived on site with divers, [[marine salvage|salvaging]] her guns, turbines, anchors and chains. During the remainder of the war, the Navy used the wreckage site for diver training; they did not undertake further salvaging. \nSettling in just {{convert|60|ft}} of water, the ship was easily accessible to private salvors, who harvested anything of value, ransacking and further scattering ''Tucker''{{'}}s remains. Sport divers also had a destructive effect on the site, which by 1997 resembled an \"underwater junkyard\".{{sfn|Stone|1997|pp=78\u201379}} Mike Gerken, an underwater photojournalist, dove the ''Tucker'' wreckage site several times; in 2013 he eulogized ''Tucker'' and other sunken ships:\n\n{{quote\n|text=To see a ship with a distinguished record as the ''Tucker'' in such a poor state gave me pause for thought.
