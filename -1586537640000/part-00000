The first [[Daytime television|daytime show]] featured [[Gore Vidal]], [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Angela Lansbury]]. ABC pressured Cavett to get prominent celebrities on the show, although subsequent shows without them got higher ratings and more critical acclaim.\n[[File:Anthony Quinn The Dick Cavett Show 1971.JPG|thumb|Cavett with guest [[Anthony Quinn]] (1971)]]\nA well-received summer replacement prime-time series that aired three times per week led to the memorable [[late-night talk show]] that ran from December 29, 1969 to January 1, 1975  opposite [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. Cavett took the time slot over from ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (talk show)|The Joey Bishop Show]]''. In addition to his usual monologue, Cavett opened each show reading selected questions written by audience members, to which he would respond with witty rejoinders. (\"What makes New York so crummy these days?\" \"Tourists.\")\n\nWhile Cavett and Carson shared many of the same guests, Cavett was receptive to [[rock and roll]] artists to a degree unusual at the time, as well as to authors, politicians and other personalities outside the entertainment field. The wide variety of guests, combined with Cavett's literate and intelligent approach to comedy, appealed to a significant enough number of viewers to keep the show running for several years despite the competition from Carson's show.\n\nThe late-night show's 45-minute midpoint would always be signaled by the musical piece \"Glitter and Be Gay\" from [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[Candide (musical)|Candide]].'' The ''Candide'' snippet became Cavett's theme song and was used as the introduction to his later PBS series, and was played by the house band on his various talk show appearances.\n\nTypically each show had several guests, but occasionally Cavett would devote an entire show to a single guest. Among those receiving such special treatment (some more than once) were [[Groucho Marx]],<ref name=\"Cavett19690613\"/> [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Katharine Hepburn]] (without an audience), [[Bette Davis]], [[Orson Welles]], [[No\u00ebl Coward]] (who appeared on the same show with [[Alfred Lunt]], [[Lynn Fontanne]], [[Tammy Grimes]] and [[Brian Bedford]]), [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Lucille Ball]], [[Zero Mostel]] (\"on some shows I've had just one guest, but tonight I have Zero\"), [[Bob Hope]] and [[David Bowie]]. These shows helped showcase Cavett's skills as a host who could attract guests that otherwise might not do interviews, at the expense of some of the excitement that might ensue from the multiple-guest format.\n[[File:Paar and cavett 1973.JPG|thumb|left|Dick Cavett and [[Jack Paar]]]]\nIn January 1973, despite a vociferous letter campaign, ratings forced the show to be cut back to occasional status, airing one week a month under the umbrella title ''[[ABC's Wide World of Entertainment]]''. [[Jack Paar]], whom ABC had tried to recruit as Cavett's successor, insisted that both he and Cavett would be given at least one week per month as a sign of respect for Cavett. By the end of 1974, Cavett's show was airing only twice per month.\n\nThe PBS series featured single guests in a half-hour format and was produced by [[Christopher Porterfield]], a former roommate of Cavett's at [[Yale University]] who had coauthored the book ''Cavett'' that was published in August 1974. The show remained on the PBS lineup until affiliates voted it off the schedule in 1982.\n\nOn all three of the early ABC shows, the bandleader was [[Bobby Rosengarden]] and the announcer was [[Fred Foy]] of ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' fame. The morning show was produced by Woody Fraser. Tony Converse was the producer of the 1969 ABC prime-time show and the original producer of the ABC late-night show, succeeded by  John Gilroy. Cavett's writer was [[David Lloyd (writer)|Dave Lloyd]].\n\n''The Dick Cavett Show'' was also the name of a short-lived radio show.\n\n===Notable moments===\n\n====March 4, 1968: The premiere of ''This Morning''====\nIn the first broadcast of his 90-minute morning show, Cavett had as his first guest engineer, designer and futurist [[Buckminster Fuller]]. The two discussed how politicians would eventually become obsolete through technological advances, and the wide-ranging discussion included a comment from Fuller that a woman is a baby factory and that a man's role is to simply press the right button. Later on in the program, Cavett chatted with actress [[Patricia Neal]], who discussed her long rehabilitation from a near-fatal [[stroke]] in 1965.\n\n====March 27, 1968: Christine Jorgensen walks off the show====\nDuring an interview with [[Christine Jorgensen]], the first widely known [[trans woman]] to have [[sex reassignment surgery]] (in this case a complete male-to-female [[vaginoplasty]]), Jorgensen walked off the show when she felt offended after Cavett asked her about the status of her romantic life with her \"wife\"; because Jorgensen was the only scheduled guest, Cavett spent the rest of that show talking about how he had not meant to offend her.\n\n==== June 6, 1968: Robert F. Kennedy assassination====\nAs a result of continuing coverage of the [[Robert F. Kennedy assassination]] that took place earlier that morning, Cavett's show didn't begin until 11 a.m., and was interrupted at 11:20 for 30 minutes of further updates on the unfolding tragedy. At 11:50, Cavett's show returned for its final 10 minutes. The assassination was the lone topic discussed during the 30 minutes of the show. On the following two mornings, the show began at its regular time of 10:30&nbsp;a.m., and was once again devoted exclusively to assassination coverage, and presented without commercial interruption.\n\n====June 13, 1969: Groucho Marx's one-man show====\nBecause of conflicting network broadcasts, Cavett pre-taped a one-man, 60-minute episode with Groucho Marx.<ref name=\"Cavett19690613\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0880018/ The Dick Cavett Show: Season 3, Episode 9 Groucho Marx (13 Jun. 1969) - imdb] q.v.: [[YouTube]]</ref>\n\n====July 7, 1969: Jimi Hendrix====\nIn the July 7, 1969 interview, rock star [[Jimi Hendrix]] modestly downplayed his abilities and displayed his sense of humor. Perhaps most importantly, he revealed some of his aesthetic ideals and the purpose of his music when he discussed his concept of the \u201cElectric Church\u201d:\n\n''[Music] is getting to be more spiritual than anything now. Pretty soon I believe that they are going to have to rely on music to get some kind of peace of mind or satisfaction\u2014direction, actually\u2014more so than politics, because politics is really on an ego scene\u2026[Politics] is the art of words, which means nothing. So, therefore you have to rely on more of an earthier substance like music or the arts, theater, acting, painting, whatever\u2026[The Electric Church] is a belief that I have. We do use electric guitars. Everything is electrified nowadays. So, therefore the belief comes through electricity to people. That\u2019s why we play so loud. Because it doesn\u2019t actually hit through the eardrums like most groups do nowadays. They say \u2018Well, we\u2019re going to play loud too, because they\u2019re playing loud.\u2019 And they\u2019ve got this real shrill sound that\u2019s really hard. We plan for our sound to go inside the soul of the person\u2026and see if they can awaken some sort of thing in their minds, because there are so many sleeping people.''\n\nHendrix then performed [[Hear My Train A Comin'|\"Hear My Train A Comin']]\" with the house band and played the guitar with his teeth at the end of the song.\n\n====August 19, 1969: The Woodstock Show====\nOn Tuesday, August 19, 1969, [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[David Crosby]] and [[Stephen Stills]] (of [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]]) all appeared on the show. The episode is now often referred to as \"The [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] Show\", as many of the performers, and Cavett's audience, came directly from the concert for the taping the afternoon before the show aired. Stills pointed out the mud from the concert venue still on his pants. Jefferson Airplane's performance of \"[[We Can Be Together]]\" marked the first time the word \"fuck\" was uttered on television in the US (the actual line is \"In order to survive we steal, cheat, lie, forge, fuck, hide and deal\". Another line with the forbidden word was \"Up against the wall, [[Up Against the Wall Motherfucker|Up against the wall, motherfucker]]\".). Mitchell sang \"[[Chelsea Morning]]\", \"Willy\" and \"For Free\". [[Grace Slick]] purposefully called Cavett \"Jim\" and briefly talked about her school days at [[Finch College]]. Stephen Stills performed \"4 + 20\".  Joni Mitchell sang \"[[The Fiddle and the Drum]]\" [[a cappella]]. Jefferson Airplane (with Crosby) then launched into \"[[Somebody to Love (Jefferson Airplane song)|Somebody to Love]]\". The credits rolled as the musicians, without Mitchell, engaged in an instrumental jam as the audience danced.\n\nJimi Hendrix was scheduled to join the others, but was unable to appear at the afternoon taping that occurred only a few hours after he had performed at the late-running festival. Mitchell's manager, apparently fearing a similar situation that may have prevented her from appearing on the show, did not allow her to perform at Woodstock. He considered the ''Dick Cavett Show'' too important for her career for her to risk missing the taping.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Dick Cavett Show: Rock Icons (DVD liner notes)|url= |quote= |publisher=[[Daphne Productions]] |year=2005 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nMitchell wrote the song \"[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]\" based on descriptions by [[Graham Nash]] and from the images she saw on television, as she could not be there in person. The most famous version of the song is by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, who recorded it for their ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'' album (1970). It appears in the film ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' during the closing credits. Mitchell recorded it for ''[[Ladies of the Canyon (album)|Ladies of the Canyon]]'' (1970).\n\n====September 5, 1969: Groucho Marx====\n[[Groucho Marx]] remarked about the [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', which had just opened and was notorious for its ground-breaking use of explicit nudity: \"I was going to go, but I saw myself in the mirror one morning, and I figured, why waste five and a half dollars?\"\n\n====September 9, 1969: Jimi Hendrix====\nIn an interview with Jimi Hendrix, Cavett spoke about Hendrix's performance of the \"[[Star Spangled Banner]]\" at Woodstock, and called the style \"unorthodox\". Jimi commented that the song was \"not unorthodox\" and that what he played was beautiful. The audience clapped, and Dick blushed.\n\nHendrix performed \"Izabella\" & \"[[Machine Gun (Jimi Hendrix song)|Machine Gun]]\" with his band, [[Billy Cox]], [[Mitch Mitchell]] and [[Juma Sultan]].\n\n====February 4, 1970: Judy Collins====\nDuring an interview with singer [[Judy Collins]] in which Cavett and Collins discussed her experiences as a defense witness at the [[Chicago Seven]] trial, several of Collins' comments were censored at the direction of the ABC legal department. Collins wrote a protest letter to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), claiming a violation of her free-speech rights and the network license granted to ABC by the FCC. Her protest was denied, with the FCC ruling that a television network could, at its discretion, delete or edit remarks on its programs. [[Elton Rule]], president of ABC Television, noted that in the network's judgment, \"her remarks ... were not within the bounds of fair comment.\"\n\n====February 5, 1970: Eric Clapton====\nBlues guitarist [[Eric Clapton]] appeared on the show with a new group called [[Delaney & Bonnie & Friends]], which was Clapton's first attempt to break from his lead role and operate as an anonymous sideman. This was also possibly the first time Clapton had appeared on American television with a [[Fender Stratocaster]]; up to that time, he was famous for only playing [[Gibson]] guitars. Cavett briefly interviewed the band but the shy Clapton did not have much to say.\n\n====February 19, 1970: No\u00ebl Coward, Alfred Lunt, Lynn Fontanne, Tammy Grimes and Brian Bedford====\nTo honor [[No\u00ebl Coward]] on the occasion of his knighthood, Cavett interviewed Coward and his close friends, the Lunts. Tammy Grimes and Brian Bedford, who were appearing on Broadway in a revival of Coward's classic play ''[[Private Lives]]'', performed a medley of Coward's most popular songs. At one point during the interview, Cavett asked Coward, \"What is the word for when one has terrific, prolific qualities?\" to which Coward answered in a deadpan manner, \"Talent\", drawing a great amount of laughter.\n\n====April 6, 1970: Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin====\nActors [[Mark Frechette]] and [[Daria Halprin]] appeared together with movie producer [[Mel Brooks]] and movie critic [[Rex Reed]]. The interview went poorly from the outset, with Frechette giving abrupt, non-conversational answers and Halprin staying silent. Cavett apparently believed that they lived in a [[commune]], when they in fact were followers of cult leader [[Mel Lyman]]. When Cavett asked about the \"commune\" where they lived, Frechette denied that it was a commune and said that \"The community is for one purpose, and that's to serve Mel Lyman, who's the leader and founder of that community.\" At that point, Halprin finally tried to speak, but Cavett went to commercial. When the show returned, the next guest, Dr. Aaron Stern, a Beverly Hills psychiatrist and director of the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]]'s [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|code and rating administration]], was brought out, and Frechette and Halprin were not interviewed further.\n\n====July 27, 1970: Orson Welles====\nAround halfway through Cavett's [[Orson Welles]] interview, Welles reversed the roles and began asking Cavett questions about his life and career. This impromptu interview was well-received by the audience and, among other things, humorously acknowledged Cavett's talk-show competitors such as [[Johnny Carson]] and [[Merv Griffin]].\n\n====September 18, 1970: John Cassavetes, Peter Falk and Ben Gazzara====\nDirector [[John Cassavetes]] and actors [[Peter Falk]] and [[Ben Gazzara]] appeared on the show to promote the movie ''[[Husbands (film)|Husbands]]''. All three guests were highly intoxicated, and \"for thirty-five minutes they smoked, flopped around on the floor, and generally tormented Cavett, whose questions they\u2019d planned to ignore.\"<ref name=\"newyorker.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/dick-cavetts-worst-show|title=Dick Cavett\u2019s Worst Show|first=Elon|last=Green|website=The New Yorker}}</ref> Dick Cavett pronounced it \"one of the most interesting evenings of my life.\"<ref name=\"newyorker.com\"/>\n\n====December 18, 1970: Lester Maddox walks off the show====\nFormer Georgia governor [[Lester Maddox]], appearing in a panel discussion with author [[Truman Capote]] and football great [[Jim Brown]], walked off the show in the middle of a conversation about [[Racial segregation|segregation]]. Cavett had made a reference to the \"bigots\" who had elected Maddox. Following a give-and-take about how insulting the remark might have been and Maddox's demand for an apology, Cavett finally apologized to those Georgians who had supported Maddox that might not be bigots. Not satisfied, Maddox left the studio. During the hastily called commercial break, Cavett tried to coax Maddox back to no avail. Cavett suspected that the behavior was mere showmanship and a calculated [[publicity stunt]]. The incident was reported on the news before it aired that night, increasing viewership. In [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], the hometown of Cavett's wife [[Carrie Nye]], the guests at a [[country club]] dance abandoned the dance floor to watch the show on the TV in the lounge. In [[Atlanta]], then-ABC affiliate WQXI-TV (now [[WXIA]]) led with the story on its 11 p.m. newscast, but as it was a Friday night, when the station normally aired movies and delayed Cavett's Friday show to Sunday, Atlanta viewers had to wait until Sunday night to see the incident.\n\nCapote, after watching Maddox walk offstage, paused and quipped, \"I've been to his restaurant and his chicken isn't that [[KFC|finger lickin' good]].\" Years later, Cavett said he got more comments about the show (including some 6,000 pieces of [[hate mail]]) than any other he had done.<ref>http://www.onthemedia.org/2003/jun/27/governor-leaves-the-stage/transcript/</ref>\n\nMaddox later returned for another appearance, and this time Cavett walked off as a joke. Left alone on stage, Maddox cued the band and began singing \"I Don't Know Why I Love You Like I Do\" as Cavett reappeared in the wings to join in.\n\nThe walk-off incident is mentioned at the beginning of the [[Randy Newman]] song \"[[Rednecks (song)|Rednecks]].\"\n\n====February 11, 1971: Salvador Dal\u00ed, Lillian Gish and Satchel Paige====\nSurrealist artist [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] appeared on the show with silent-screen star [[Lillian Gish]] and baseball legend [[Satchel Paige]]. Dal\u00ed brought an anteater on a leash with him when he came on stage, and he tossed it in Gish's lap, much to her consternation.\n\nCavett asked Dal\u00ed why he had once arrived to give a lecture at the [[Sorbonne]] in an open limousine filled with heads of cauliflower. Dal\u00ed responded with a barely coherent discourse regarding the similarity of the cauliflower head to the \"mathematical problem discovered by [[Michelangelo]] in the rhinoceros' horn.\"\n\nCavett interrupted him by waving his hands in Dal\u00ed's face, exclaiming \"Boogie boogie boogie!\" (imitating [[Groucho Marx]] in the film ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]''). The audience broke up, and Dal\u00ed appeared at a loss.\n\n====April 29, 1971: Robert Mitchum interview====\nActor [[Robert Mitchum]], known for avoiding public appearances, gave a rare interview as the sole guest. Mitchum talked about his childhood, Hollywood, his disdain for politics and politicians and his 1948 arrest. The show featured film clips from ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955).\n\n====June 7, 1971: J. I. Rodale's on-stage death====\nAs noted in Cavett's autobiography (p.&nbsp;321-323), on June 7, 1971 publisher [[J. I. Rodale]], an advocate of organic farming, died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] during taping. Cavett was speaking with journalist [[Pete Hamill]] when Rodale began to make a snoring noise. Cavett's reaction to this is contested: he claims that both he and Hamill realized immediately that something was wrong, while other accounts have him addressing the unconscious man with \"Are we boring you, Mr. Rodale?\" The audience did not realize anything was seriously wrong until Cavett asked (avoiding the clich\u00e9), \"Is there a doctor...''in the audience?''\"\n\nThe program was never aired and a rerun was shown in its place.<ref>{{cite news |first= Dick|last= Cavett|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=When That Guy Died on My Show |url=http://cavett.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/when-that-guy-died-on-my-show/ |quote=I brought out the next guest, Pete Hamill, whose column ran in The New York Post. Rodale moved \u201cdown one\u201d to the couch. As Pete and I began to chat, Mr. Rodale suddenly made a snoring sound, which got a laugh. Comics would sometimes do that for a laugh while another comic was talking, pretending boredom. His head tilted to the side as Pete, in close-up as it happened, whispered audibly, \"This looks bad.\" The audience laughed at that. I didn\u2019t, because I knew Rodale was dead. To this day, I don\u2019t know how I knew. I thought, \"Good God, I\u2019m in charge here. What do I do?\" Next thing I knew I was holding his wrist, thinking, I don\u2019t know anything about what a wrist is supposed to feel like. |publisher=New York Times |date=May 3, 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}</ref> On the following night's program, Cavett discussed the previous night's event in depth.\n\n====June 1971: Vietnam War debate with John Kerry====\nDuring a debate about the Vietnam War, Cavett had two veterans debating on the show. The anti-war side was led by a young [[John Kerry]] and the pro-war side by [[John E. O'Neill]], later the founder of [[Swift Vets and POWs for Truth|Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]]. It was later revealed through then-President [[Richard Nixon]]'s secret [[White House]] tapes that Nixon wanted to \"get rid\" of Cavett because of this debate.\n\n====August 2, 1971: Ingmar Bergman====\nDirector [[Ingmar Bergman]] appeared for the first time on a US talk show, one of the few television interviews he ever granted.\n\n====November 24, 1971: Danny Kaye====\nActor/singer [[Danny Kaye]] appeared for the entire show with film clips, performing and promoting [[UNICEF]].\n\n====December 15, 1971: Norman Mailer vs. Gore Vidal====\nMoments before the episode with [[Gore Vidal]], [[Norman Mailer]] and [[Janet Flanner]], Mailer, annoyed with Vidal's less-than-stellar review of ''Prisoner of Sex'', headbutted Vidal and traded insults with him backstage.<ref name=cavettshow>{{cite web|title=The Guest From Hell: Savoring Norman Mailer's legendary appearance on The Dick Cavett Show |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2007/08/the_guest_from_hell.single.html |publisher=Slate.com |accessdate=April 13, 2012}}</ref> As the show began taping, a visibly belligerent Mailer, who admitted he had been drinking,<ref name=cavettshow/> goaded Vidal and Cavett into trading insults with him on air and continually referred to his \"greater intellect\". He openly taunted and mocked Vidal (who responded in kind), finally earning the ire of Flanner, who announced that she had become \"very, very bored\" with the discussion, telling Mailer \"You act as if you're the only people here.\" Mailer moved his chair away from the other guests and Cavett joked that \"perhaps you'd like two more chairs to contain your giant intellect?\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8150850263045831787&#29m10s|title=Google video titled \"Charlie Rose - Dick Cavett, 57 min - Mar 5, 2001.\"}}</ref><ref name=\"YouTube\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8m9vDRe8fw|title=4-minute YouTube excerpt from Norman Mailer - Gore Vidal show}}</ref> Mailer replied \"I'll take the two chairs if you'll all accept [[finger bowl]]s.\" As Cavett professed to not understand Mailer's \"finger bowl\" comment and made further jokes, Mailer stated \"Why don't you look at your question sheet and ask your question?\", to which Cavett responded \"Why don't you fold it five ways and put it where the moon don't shine?\"<ref name=cavettshow/><ref name=\"YouTube\" />\n\nA long laugh by the audience ensued, after which Mailer asked Cavett if he had \"come up with that line himself\". Cavett replied, \"I have to tell you a quote from [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]?\"\n\nThe headbutting and later on-air altercation was described by Mailer in his short book ''Of a Small and Modest Malignancy, Wicked and Bristling with Dots'', including a description that does not jibe with the videotape and which was disputed by Cavett decades later in his [[New York Times|''New York Times'']] online column.<ref name=cavettcolumn>{{cite news| url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/when-they-told-me-norman-wrote-a-book/ | work=The New York Times | first=Dick | last=Cavett | title=When They Told Me Norman Wrote a Book\u2026 | date=November 25, 2007}}</ref> Cavett noted that Mailer said that he received more mail about this episode than for anything else in his career.<ref name=cavettcolumnmailer>{{cite news| url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/in-this-corner-norman-mailer/?ref=opinion# | work=The New York Times | first=Dick | last=Cavett | title=In This Corner, Norman Mailer | date=November 14, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====1971: John Simon vs. Mort Sahl====\nCritic [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] revealed on the air that during the most recent commercial break, fellow guest [[Mort Sahl]] had threatened to punch him in the mouth.\n\n====1971: The pornography episodes====\nCavett did a two-part show on [[pornography]]; both parts were taped the same day and shown on two nights. During the first part, he discussed the depiction of oral sex in movies and made a parenthetical utterance: \"oral-genital sex...mouth on sex organs.\" A flap ensued when executives demanded that the censor cut the second phrase.\n\nAn angry Cavett described the ongoing situation at the beginning of the second part, reusing the phrase. One of the guests, legal scholar [[Alexander Bickel]], sided with Cavett. The result was that the show aired with the phrase cut the first night but intact for the second night.\n\n====March 31, 1972: Chad Everett vs. Lily Tomlin====\nDuring the taping of this episode, actor [[Chad Everett]] had a much-publicized argument with [[feminist]] actress/comedian [[Lily Tomlin]]. Tomlin became so enraged when Everett referred to his wife as \"my property\" that she stormed off the set and refused to return.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914863-6,00.html|title=Lily Tomlin Biography - Time Magazine}}</ref>\n\n====June 27, 1972: Angela Davis====\n[[Angela Davis]], an activist who was associated with the [[Black Panther Party]] in the 1960s and 1970s, cancelled a scheduled appearance on June 27, 1972. The basis for the controversy was the continuing debate over the SST ([[supersonic transport]]) system. ABC had insisted on inviting either [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] or [[William Rusher]] of the conservative ''[[National Review]]'' magazine to have a balanced viewpoint, but Davis declined.\n\n====1972: Rogers Morton====\nA show with [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Rogers Morton]] resulted in nine animals being added to the endangered species list after Cavett commented on them.\n\n====June 12, 1973: Marlon Brando====\n[[Marlon Brando]], who just months earlier had rejected his Academy Award for ''The Godfather'' to protest the plight of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]], appeared on the show with representatives of the [[Cheyenne]], [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] and [[Lummi]] tribes to promote his views.<ref>{{cite news|last=Flynn|first=Betty|newspaper=The Minneapolis Star|date=13 June 1973|page=15A|title=Brando, nervous Cavett spar|agency=Chicago Daily News Service}}</ref> After the program ended, Brando assaulted photographer [[Ron Galella]], who ended up in the hospital after being punched in the face.\n\n====October 1973: Katharine Hepburn two-hour interview====\nDuring a two-part interview with [[Katharine Hepburn]], Hepburn got up and left at the end of the first half of the interview, thinking her job was done. Cavett apologized to the audience, promising that she would be back the next evening (she was).

The first [[Daytime television|daytime show]] featured [[Gore Vidal]], [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Angela Lansbury]]. ABC pressured Cavett to get prominent celebrities on the show, although subsequent shows without them got higher ratings and more critical acclaim.\n[[File:Anthony Quinn The Dick Cavett Show 1971.JPG|thumb|Cavett with guest [[Anthony Quinn]] (1971)]]\nA well-received summer replacement prime-time series that aired three times per week led to the memorable [[late-night talk show]] that ran from December 29, 1969 to January 1, 1975  opposite [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. Cavett took the time slot over from ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (talk show)|The Joey Bishop Show]]''. In addition to his usual monologue, Cavett opened each show reading selected questions written by audience members, to which he would respond with witty rejoinders. (\"What makes New York so crummy these days?\" \"Tourists.\")\n\nWhile Cavett and Carson shared many of the same guests, Cavett was receptive to [[rock and roll]] artists to a degree unusual at the time, as well as to authors, politicians and other personalities outside the entertainment field. The wide variety of guests, combined with Cavett's literate and intelligent approach to comedy, appealed to a significant enough number of viewers to keep the show running for several years despite the competition from Carson's show.\n\nThe late-night show's 45-minute midpoint would always be signaled by the musical piece \"Glitter and Be Gay\" from [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[Candide (musical)|Candide]].'' The ''Candide'' snippet became Cavett's theme song and was used as the introduction to his later PBS series, and was played by the house band on his various talk show appearances.\n\nTypically each show had several guests, but occasionally Cavett would devote an entire show to a single guest. Among those receiving such special treatment (some more than once) were [[Groucho Marx]],<ref name=\"Cavett19690613\"/> [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Katharine Hepburn]] (without an audience), [[Bette Davis]], [[Orson Welles]], [[No\u00ebl Coward]] (who appeared on the same show with [[Alfred Lunt]], [[Lynn Fontanne]], [[Tammy Grimes]] and [[Brian Bedford]]), [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Lucille Ball]], [[Zero Mostel]] (\"on some shows I've had just one guest, but tonight I have Zero\"), [[Bob Hope]] and [[David Bowie]]. These shows helped showcase Cavett's skills as a host who could attract guests that otherwise might not do interviews, at the expense of some of the excitement that might ensue from the multiple-guest format.\n[[File:Paar and cavett 1973.JPG|thumb|left|Dick Cavett and [[Jack Paar]]]]\nIn January 1973, despite a vociferous letter campaign, ratings forced the show to be cut back to occasional status, airing one week a month under the umbrella title ''[[ABC's Wide World of Entertainment]]''. [[Jack Paar]], whom ABC had tried to recruit as Cavett's successor, insisted that both he and Cavett would be given at least one week per month as a sign of respect for Cavett. By the end of 1974, Cavett's show was airing only twice per month.\n\nThe PBS series featured single guests in a half-hour format and was produced by [[Christopher Porterfield]], a former roommate of Cavett's at [[Yale University]] who had coauthored the book ''Cavett'' that was published in August 1974. The show remained on the PBS lineup until affiliates voted it off the schedule in 1982.\n\nOn all three of the early ABC shows, the bandleader was [[Bobby Rosengarden]] and the announcer was [[Fred Foy]] of ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' fame. The morning show was produced by Woody Fraser. Tony Converse was the producer of the 1969 ABC prime-time show and the original producer of the ABC late-night show, succeeded by  John Gilroy. Cavett's writer was [[David Lloyd (writer)|Dave Lloyd]].\n\n''The Dick Cavett Show'' was also the name of a short-lived radio show.\n\n===Notable moments===\n\n====March 4, 1968: The premiere of ''This Morning''====\nIn the first broadcast of his 90-minute morning show, Cavett had as his first guest engineer, designer and futurist [[Buckminster Fuller]]. The two discussed how politicians would eventually become obsolete through technological advances, and the wide-ranging discussion included a comment from Fuller that a woman is a baby factory and that a man's role is to simply press the right button. Later on in the program, Cavett chatted with actress [[Patricia Neal]], who discussed her long rehabilitation from a near-fatal [[stroke]] in 1965.\n\n====March 27, 1968: Christine Jorgensen walks off the show====\nDuring an interview with [[Christine Jorgensen]], the first widely known [[trans woman]] to have [[sex reassignment surgery]] (in this case a complete male-to-female [[vaginoplasty]]), Jorgensen walked off the show when she felt offended after Cavett asked her about the status of her romantic life with her \"wife\"; because Jorgensen was the only scheduled guest, Cavett spent the rest of that show talking about how he had not meant to offend her.\n\n==== June 6, 1968: Robert F. Kennedy assassination====\nAs a result of continuing coverage of the [[Robert F. Kennedy assassination]] that took place earlier that morning, Cavett's show didn't begin until 11 a.m., and was interrupted at 11:20 for 30 minutes of further updates on the unfolding tragedy. At 11:50, Cavett's show returned for its final 10 minutes. The assassination was the lone topic discussed during the 30 minutes of the show. On the following two mornings, the show began at its regular time of 10:30&nbsp;a.m., and was once again devoted exclusively to assassination coverage, and presented without commercial interruption.\n\n====June 13, 1969: Groucho Marx's one-man show====\nBecause of conflicting network broadcasts, Cavett pre-taped a one-man, 60-minute episode with Groucho Marx.<ref name=\"Cavett19690613\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0880018/ The Dick Cavett Show: Season 3, Episode 9 Groucho Marx (13 Jun. 1969) - imdb] q.v.: [[YouTube]]</ref>\n\n====July 7, 1969: Jimi Hendrix====\nIn the July 7, 1969 interview, rock star [[Jimi Hendrix]] modestly downplayed his abilities and displayed his sense of humor. Perhaps most importantly, he revealed some of his aesthetic ideals and the purpose of his music when he discussed his concept of the \u201cElectric Church\u201d:\n\n''[Music] is getting to be more spiritual than anything now. Pretty soon I believe that they are going to have to rely on music to get some kind of peace of mind or satisfaction\u2014direction, actually\u2014more so than politics, because politics is really on an ego scene\u2026[Politics] is the art of words, which means nothing. So, therefore you have to rely on more of an earthier substance like music or the arts, theater, acting, painting, whatever\u2026[The Electric Church] is a belief that I have. We do use electric guitars. Everything is electrified nowadays. So, therefore the belief comes through electricity to people. That\u2019s why we play so loud. Because it doesn\u2019t actually hit through the eardrums like most groups do nowadays. They say \u2018Well, we\u2019re going to play loud too, because they\u2019re playing loud.\u2019 And they\u2019ve got this real shrill sound that\u2019s really hard. We plan for our sound to go inside the soul of the person\u2026and see if they can awaken some sort of thing in their minds, because there are so many sleeping people.''\n\nHendrix then performed [[Hear My Train A Comin'|\"Hear My Train A Comin']]\" with the house band and played the guitar with his teeth at the end of the song.\n\n====August 19, 1969: The Woodstock Show====\nOn Tuesday, August 19, 1969, [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[David Crosby]] and [[Stephen Stills]] (of [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]]) all appeared on the show. The episode is now often referred to as \"The [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] Show\", as many of the performers, and Cavett's audience, came directly from the concert for the taping the afternoon before the show aired. Stills pointed out the mud from the concert venue still on his pants. Jefferson Airplane's performance of \"[[We Can Be Together]]\" marked the first time the word \"fuck\" was uttered on television in the US (the actual line is \"In order to survive we steal, cheat, lie, forge, fuck, hide and deal\". Another line with the forbidden word was \"Up against the wall, [[Up Against the Wall Motherfucker|Up against the wall, motherfucker]]\".). Mitchell sang \"[[Chelsea Morning]]\", \"Willy\" and \"For Free\". [[Grace Slick]] purposefully called Cavett \"Jim\" and briefly talked about her school days at [[Finch College]]. Stephen Stills performed \"4 + 20\".  Joni Mitchell sang \"[[The Fiddle and the Drum]]\" [[a cappella]]. Jefferson Airplane (with Crosby) then launched into \"[[Somebody to Love (Jefferson Airplane song)|Somebody to Love]]\". The credits rolled as the musicians, without Mitchell, engaged in an instrumental jam as the audience danced.\n\nJimi Hendrix was scheduled to join the others, but was unable to appear at the afternoon taping that occurred only a few hours after he had performed at the late-running festival. Mitchell's manager, apparently fearing a similar situation that may have prevented her from appearing on the show, did not allow her to perform at Woodstock. He considered the ''Dick Cavett Show'' too important for her career for her to risk missing the taping.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Dick Cavett Show: Rock Icons (DVD liner notes)|url= |quote= |publisher=[[Daphne Productions]] |year=2005 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nMitchell wrote the song \"[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]\" based on descriptions by [[Graham Nash]] and from the images she saw on television, as she could not be there in person. The most famous version of the song is by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, who recorded it for their ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'' album (1970). It appears in the film ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' during the closing credits. Mitchell recorded it for ''[[Ladies of the Canyon (album)|Ladies of the Canyon]]'' (1970).\n\n====September 5, 1969: Groucho Marx====\n[[Groucho Marx]] remarked about the [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', which had just opened and was notorious for its ground-breaking use of explicit nudity: \"I was going to go, but I saw myself in the mirror one morning, and I figured, why waste five and a half dollars?\"\n\n====September 9, 1969: Jimi Hendrix====\nIn an interview with Jimi Hendrix, Cavett spoke about Hendrix's performance of the \"[[Star Spangled Banner]]\" at Woodstock, and called the style \"unorthodox\". Jimi commented that the song was \"not unorthodox\" and that what he played was beautiful. The audience clapped, and Dick blushed.\n\nHendrix performed \"Izabella\" & \"[[Machine Gun (Jimi Hendrix song)|Machine Gun]]\" with his band, [[Billy Cox]], [[Mitch Mitchell]] and [[Juma Sultan]].\n\n====February 4, 1970: Judy Collins====\nDuring an interview with singer [[Judy Collins]] in which Cavett and Collins discussed her experiences as a defense witness at the [[Chicago Seven]] trial, several of Collins' comments were censored at the direction of the ABC legal department. Collins wrote a protest letter to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), claiming a violation of her free-speech rights and the network license granted to ABC by the FCC. Her protest was denied, with the FCC ruling that a television network could, at its discretion, delete or edit remarks on its programs. [[Elton Rule]], president of ABC Television, noted that in the network's judgment, \"her remarks ... were not within the bounds of fair comment.\"\n\n====February 5, 1970: Eric Clapton====\nBlues guitarist [[Eric Clapton]] appeared on the show with a new group called [[Delaney & Bonnie & Friends]], which was Clapton's first attempt to break from his lead role and operate as an anonymous sideman. This was also possibly the first time Clapton had appeared on American television with a [[Fender Stratocaster]]; up to that time, he was famous for only playing [[Gibson]] guitars. Cavett briefly interviewed the band but the shy Clapton did not have much to say.\n\n====February 19, 1970: No\u00ebl Coward, Alfred Lunt, Lynn Fontanne, Tammy Grimes and Brian Bedford====\nTo honor [[No\u00ebl Coward]] on the occasion of his knighthood, Cavett interviewed Coward and his close friends, the Lunts. Tammy Grimes and Brian Bedford, who were appearing on Broadway in a revival of Coward's classic play ''[[Private Lives]]'', performed a medley of Coward's most popular songs. At one point during the interview, Cavett asked Coward, \"What is the word for when one has terrific, prolific qualities?\" to which Coward answered in a deadpan manner, \"Talent\", drawing a great amount of laughter.\n\n====April 6, 1970: Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin====\nActors [[Mark Frechette]] and [[Daria Halprin]] appeared together with movie producer [[Mel Brooks]] and movie critic [[Rex Reed]]. The interview went poorly from the outset, with Frechette giving abrupt, non-conversational answers and Halprin staying silent. Cavett apparently believed that they lived in a [[commune]], when they in fact were followers of cult leader [[Mel Lyman]]. When Cavett asked about the \"commune\" where they lived, Frechette denied that it was a commune and said that \"The community is for one purpose, and that's to serve Mel Lyman, who's the leader and founder of that community.\" At that point, Halprin finally tried to speak, but Cavett went to commercial. When the show returned, the next guest, Dr. Aaron Stern, a Beverly Hills psychiatrist and director of the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]]'s [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|code and rating administration]], was brought out, and Frechette and Halprin were not interviewed further.\n\n====July 27, 1970: Orson Welles====\nAround halfway through Cavett's [[Orson Welles]] interview, Welles reversed the roles and began asking Cavett questions about his life and career. This impromptu interview was well-received by the audience and, among other things, humorously acknowledged Cavett's talk-show competitors such as [[Johnny Carson]] and [[Merv Griffin]].\n\n====September 18, 1970: John Cassavetes, Peter Falk and Ben Gazzara====\nDirector [[John Cassavetes]] and actors [[Peter Falk]] and [[Ben Gazzara]] appeared on the show to promote the movie ''[[Husbands (film)|Husbands]]''. All three guests were highly intoxicated, and \"for thirty-five minutes they smoked, flopped around on the floor, and generally tormented Cavett, whose questions they\u2019d planned to ignore.\"<ref name=\"newyorker.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/dick-cavetts-worst-show|title=Dick Cavett\u2019s Worst Show|first=Elon|last=Green|website=The New Yorker}}</ref> Dick Cavett pronounced it \"one of the most interesting evenings of my life.\"<ref name=\"newyorker.com\"/>\n\n====December 18, 1970: Lester Maddox walks off the show====\nFormer Georgia governor [[Lester Maddox]], appearing in a panel discussion with author [[Truman Capote]] and football great [[Jim Brown]], walked off the show in the middle of a conversation about [[Racial segregation|segregation]]. Cavett had made a reference to the \"bigots\" who had elected Maddox. Following a give-and-take about how insulting the remark might have been and Maddox's demand for an apology, Cavett finally apologized to those Georgians who had supported Maddox that might not be bigots. Not satisfied, Maddox left the studio. During the hastily called commercial break, Cavett tried to coax Maddox back to no avail. Cavett suspected that the behavior was mere showmanship and a calculated [[publicity stunt]]. The incident was reported on the news before it aired that night, increasing viewership. In [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], the hometown of Cavett's wife [[Carrie Nye]], the guests at a [[country club]] dance abandoned the dance floor to watch the show on the TV in the lounge. In [[Atlanta]], then-ABC affiliate WQXI-TV (now [[WXIA]]) led with the story on its 11 p.m. newscast, but as it was a Friday night, when the station normally aired movies and delayed Cavett's Friday show to Sunday, Atlanta viewers had to wait until Sunday night to see the incident.\n\nCapote, after watching Maddox walk offstage, paused and quipped, \"I've been to his restaurant and his chicken isn't that [[KFC|finger lickin' good]].\" Years later, Cavett said he got more comments about the show (including some 6,000 pieces of [[hate mail]]) than any other he had done.<ref>http://www.onthemedia.org/2003/jun/27/governor-leaves-the-stage/transcript/</ref>\n\nMaddox later returned for another appearance, and this time Cavett walked off as a joke. Left alone on stage, Maddox cued the band and began singing \"I Don't Know Why I Love You Like I Do\" as Cavett reappeared in the wings to join in.\n\nThe walk-off incident is mentioned at the beginning of the [[Randy Newman]] song \"[[Rednecks (song)|Rednecks]].\"\n\n====February 11, 1971: Salvador Dal\u00ed, Lillian Gish and Satchel Paige====\nSurrealist artist [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] appeared on the show with silent-screen star [[Lillian Gish]] and baseball legend [[Satchel Paige]]. Dal\u00ed brought an anteater on a leash with him when he came on stage, and he tossed it in Gish's lap, much to her consternation.\n\nCavett asked Dal\u00ed why he had once arrived to give a lecture at the [[Sorbonne]] in an open limousine filled with heads of cauliflower. Dal\u00ed responded with a barely coherent discourse regarding the similarity of the cauliflower head to the \"mathematical problem discovered by [[Michelangelo]] in the rhinoceros' horn.\"\n\nCavett interrupted him by waving his hands in Dal\u00ed's face, exclaiming \"Boogie boogie boogie!\" (imitating [[Groucho Marx]] in the film ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]''). The audience broke up, and Dal\u00ed appeared at a loss.\n\n====April 29, 1971: Robert Mitchum interview====\nActor [[Robert Mitchum]], known for avoiding public appearances, gave a rare interview as the sole guest. Mitchum talked about his childhood, Hollywood, his disdain for politics and politicians and his 1948 arrest. The show featured film clips from ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955).\n\n====June 7, 1971: J. I. Rodale's on-stage death====\nAs noted in Cavett's autobiography (p.&nbsp;321-323), on June 7, 1971 publisher [[J. I. Rodale]], an advocate of organic farming, died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] during taping. Cavett was speaking with journalist [[Pete Hamill]] when Rodale began to make a snoring noise. Cavett's reaction to this is contested: he claims that both he and Hamill realized immediately that something was wrong, while other accounts have him addressing the unconscious man with \"Are we boring you, Mr. Rodale?\" The audience did not realize anything was seriously wrong until Cavett asked (avoiding the clich\u00e9), \"Is there a doctor...''in the audience?''\"\n\nThe program was never aired and a rerun was shown in its place.<ref>{{cite news |first= Dick|last= Cavett|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=When That Guy Died on My Show |url=http://cavett.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/when-that-guy-died-on-my-show/ |quote=I brought out the next guest, Pete Hamill, whose column ran in The New York Post. Rodale moved \u201cdown one\u201d to the couch. As Pete and I began to chat, Mr. Rodale suddenly made a snoring sound, which got a laugh.

The anti-war side was led by a young [[John Kerry]] and the pro-war side by [[John E. O'Neill]], later the founder of [[Swift Vets and POWs for Truth|Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]].

The album was released on October 12, 2004. It is the band's last album to feature the full classic lineup, as lead guitarist [[Dave Baksh]] left Sum 41 on May 11, 2006 to pursue his career with his own band [[Brown Brigade]], but returned in 2015. ''Chuck'' peaked at No. 2 on the [[Canadian Albums Chart]] and No. 10 on the [[Billboard 200|US Billboard 200]], making it the band's highest-charting album until it would be surpassed by ''[[Underclass Hero]]'' in 2007.\n\nThe album's title is named after a [[UN]] peacekeeper named Chuck Pelletier who was in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] where Sum 41 was filming a documentary for [[War Child Canada]]. Fighting broke out during production and Chuck helped the band evacuate their hotel during the fighting; Chuck was also staying at that same hotel at the time. \n\nThe album's lyrical content has been described as darker and more mature than the band's previous work. It also had a slightly different sound, mixing in their [[punk rock]] influence with [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[adult contemporary music|adult alternative]]. The album proved to be a success, receiving acclaim from both critics and fans, as well as selling over 5 million copies. Singles such as \"We're All To Blame\" and \"Pieces\" gained success on the Canadian and American charts, and the album won a [[Juno Award]] for \"Rock Album of the Year\" in 2005.\n\n==Background==\nThe band's previous album ''[[Does This Look Infected]]'' became a commercial and critical success, and the band went on a tour in the album's support. In mid-2004, the band took a break from touring and filmed a documentary for [[War Child (charity)|War Child Canada]] in the Congo. The film was called ''[[Rocked: Sum 41 in Congo]]'' and was released in 2005 by [[MTV]]. However, fighting broke out during the filming while the band was staying in a hotel.\n\n\"The shooting was all around us, and all these people were waiting, probably to die,\" said drummer [[Steve Jocz]], reflecting on the experience. \"Two UN people arrived at the scene and gave a speech about how everything would be fine,\" bassist [[Jason McCaslin]] mentioned. \"And then after they left, things just went crazy\".\n\nVocalist/guitarist [[Deryck Whibley]] mentioned that he thought that a day after the UN gave an update about safety, he was expecting they would be able to evacuate. The next day, the band members woke up at 5:00 in the morning when two gunshots were fired. \"We went to the hotel's restaurant to get some breakfast, when the gunfire just got closer to us,\" said guitarist [[Dave Baksh]]. A U.N. peacekeeper named Charles \"Chuck\" Pelletier instructed the residents of the hotel to leave the restaurant (Pelletier was staying in the same hotel during that time). Whibley recalled, \"We all just went into McCaslin's room, where there was around 43 other people there. We were all hiding in the bathroom and hiding on the floor.\" Baksh added, \"Our U.N. peacekeeper was armed with a club, a new club because the price tag was still on it, but they were armed with guns\".\n\nPelletier continued to reassure the band and others at the hotel that everything would be okay. After the crowd was in hiding, Pelletier left to get help. The U.N. continued trying to find out as much information on the gunfire as possible, but updates were few. \"After a while, the gunfire seemed to start dying down, and then people started to go outside and they started talking. We seemed to be feeling pretty good, but then out of nowhere, the huge gunfire just went off,\" stated Whibley. \"This war was so unpredictable. At one point, it sounded like it was far away, and at another point, it sounded like it was right outside the door. Then Chuck came in and told everyone to wait for the APC's to arrive. That was probably the scariest part, when we were waiting to get into the APC's.\" Baksh recalled, \"I remember just waiting there and just wondering what the fuck was gonna happen.\"\n\nPelletier called for armored carriers to take the hotel's occupants out of the hot zone. \"By then, I  just kept thinking about everything we did as a band and everything I've done as a person, and I thought, 'This is it. This is how we're gonna die,'\" Whibley said. After nearly six hours, the carriers arrived, and the band and the forty other civilians were taken to safety. In honor of Pelletier, the band decided to name their next album after him.\n\n==Recording==\n\nWhen the band arrived back, the band members found themselves very depressed after what happened in the Congo. By spring of 2003, the band members went back to start practising parts for a new album on their own before going into a studio. \"The music's better, the songwriting's better, and there's more musical elements in this album,\" Jocz stated. \"We put more elements in this time around, and it feels like the next logical step in what we want our band to sound like\".\n\n\"We never wanted to make the same album over and over again. We've decided we wanted to do something different every time,\" said McCaslin. \"We started practicing on our own, and then we just put all of our parts together.\" The album was also mentioned to having a lot of heavy metal influences on it, with [[Metallica]] and [[Iron Maiden]] being main inspirations for the album's style. \"Dave was raised on a lot of heavy metal and grunge,\" McCaslin noted. \"Deryck and I were raised more on California punk rock music,\" said Jocz. \"When we started the band, we were mainly inspired by bands such as [[NOFX]] and [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]], but when you get older, your brain starts branching off and you start listening to other music.\"\n\nThe recording for the album went from spring 2003 to summer of 2004, and was released on October 12, 2004.\n\n==Composition==\n\n===Music and style===\n\nChuck has been described as [[alternative metal]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.banquetrecords.com/sum-41/underclass-hero/SRC093-sum41|title=Sum 41 - Underclass Hero|via=www.banquetrecords.com}}</ref> [[thrash metal]],<ref name=\"Toilet of Hell - Chuck\">{{Cite web|url=https://toiletovhell.com/sum-41-wrote-a-thrash-metal-album-when-you-werent-looking/|title=SUM 41 Wrote A Thrash Metal Album When You Weren\u2019t Looking|date=October 1, 2014}}</ref> [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]<ref name=\"Music OMH - Chuck\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/sum-41-chuck|title=Sum 41 - Chuck &#124; Albums|date=October 10, 2004}}</ref> and [[punk rock]];<ref name=theguardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/oct/08/popandrock.shopping4|title=CD: Sum 41, Chuck|author=Dave Simpson|work=the Guardian|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}</ref> by merging elements of [[hardcore punk]] and melodic hardcore with heavy metal.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Loftus |first1=Johnny |title=Sum 41 Chuck |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/chuck-mw0000301542 |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=October 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sum 41 Biography |url=https://www.hitthelights.co.uk/artist-directory/sum-41/ |accessdate=October 27, 2018}}</ref> On the sound of the album, the band have cited [[Metallica]] and [[Refused]] as major influences.<ref name=\"Guitar World\" />\n\nMichael Endelman of [[Entertainment Weekly]] described it as \"a meeting of two worlds \u2014 extreme metal and pop-savvy punk \u2014 that rarely pass each other in the halls, let alone hang out after school.\"<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\">{{cite web |last1=Endelman |first1=Michael |title=Chuck (2007-2012) |url=https://ew.com/article/2004/10/04/chuck/ |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=October 27, 2018}}</ref>\nDave Simpson at ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated \"The spiky quartet furnish their usual shouty vocals with grinding riffola and twiddly guitar solos, just as the rest of the post-Linkin Park world are realizing nu metal wasn't such a good idea.\"<ref name=theguardian/> Sum 41 abandoned the pop punk style with this album, according to Andrew Blackie of [[PopMatters]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/sum-41-underclass-hero/ |title=Sum 41: Underclass Hero |magazine=[[PopMatters]] |author=Andrew Blackie |date=August 21, 2007}}</ref> Alan di Perna of [[Guitar World]] magazine called it \"their heaviest album yet\", and as going from \"flirt[ing] with metal on both [prior] albums, but with Chuck they\u2019ve fully embraced it.\"<ref name=\"Guitar World\">{{cite journal |last1=di Perna |first1=Alan |title=Sum 41: Blow Up |journal=[[Guitar World]] |date=December 2004|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/features/sum-41-blow}}</ref>\nThe fifth and eleventh tracks on the album, [[Some Say]] and [[Pieces (Sum 41 song)|Pieces]] respectively, has been described as [[alternative rock]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Porter |first1=Brittany |title=The top ten best Sum 41 songs |url=https://www.axs.com/the-top-ten-best-sum-41-songs-103070 |website=[[AXS (company)|AXS]] |accessdate=November 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]] |date=December 2004 |page=142 |title=\"Sum 41 - Chuck\"}}</ref>\n\n===Lyrics===\n{{unsourced-section|date=May 2019}}\nThe album's lyrics have been described as being darker and more mature. Several songs focus on darker subject matters. Most of the lyrics on the album focus on politics and are influenced by the band's experience at the Congo. The album also focuses on other themes such as death (\"The Bitter End\"), depression (\"Slipping Away\"), anarchy in the world (\"I'm Not The One\"), and drug addiction (\"Angels With Dirty Faces\").\nThe band has mentioned that \"We're All To Blame\" is about the \"state of the world due to war, people dying, people living in fear, and the power of corporations, amongst other concerns.\" The band said \"Pieces\" \"is about a relationship, but not necessarily one with a girl. \"Maybe you're better left alone \u2014 fuck everybody else.\"\n\n==Commercial performance==\n\n''Chuck'' was a commercial success, selling over 5,000,000 copies worldwide. The album won [[Juno Awards of 2005|a Juno Award in 2005]] for ''Best Rock Album of the Year''. The album was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] in Japan, [[Music recording sales certification|double platinum]] in Canada and gold in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cria.ca/gold/1005_g.php |title=Gold & Platinum Certification \u2013 October 2005 |publisher=[[Canadian Recording Industry Association]] |accessdate=May 11, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122131024/http://cria.ca/gold/1005_g.php |archivedate=November 22, 2010 }}</ref><ref name=\"riaa\">[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH \"RIAA Database Search for Sum 41\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626000000/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |date=June 26, 2007 }} ''[[Recording Industry Association of America]]''.

[[Allmusic]] gave the album a positive review, saying \"''Chuck'' is a concise album that clocks in at just over a half-hour, with a basic understanding that fast and loud is what the band does best.\" [[Entertainment Weekly]] said that \"It may sound heinous on paper, but trust us, the first single, \"We're All To Blame,\" is far better than it has a right to be.\" E! Online said that \"But whether they're being snotty or serious, there is a constant thread at work: those catchy melodies.\" Music OMH said that ''Chuck'' \"isn't perfect\" but also added that \"Sum 41 have certainly added a heck of a lot more colour to their previously, partially monochrome musical output.\" Lane Devis of 411mania.com compared the album to [[Blink-182]]'s 2003 [[Blink-182 (album)|self-titled album]], [[Green Day]]'s ''[[American Idiot]]'', and [[Good Charlotte]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Life and Death]]'', saying \"The lyrics are serious in this album are far cries from the immature lyrics and antics that have become almost trademark for Sum 41.\" Common sense media gave it four stars out of five, saying \"Rugged intensity makes up for the diminished playfulness. Lyrics are clean but somber. You don't like your life, politics, or the world we live in? You might not be able to do much about it, but perhaps \u2013 following the example of Sum 41 \u2013 you can write some interesting, lyrical songs about the stuff that drives you crazy\", and also called it \"socially conscious punk rock\".\n\nDecoy Music said \"for the most part, it's obvious the band has grown up. There are some slower songs and some acoustic guitars and some ballads and all that good stuff. But the band still rocks hard 95% of the time and the fact they've gotten heavier actually accentuates their poppyness better than the punk aspect. The songs are still fast and guitar-driven, the drums are still extremely random and manic and awesome\u2014all in all, this is still a Sum 41 record. But it's just a better one.\" Stuart Green of exclaim.ca said \"Musically the band has never sounded more determined or cohesive (the notable exceptions being the Oasis sound-alike \"Some Say\" and the power mellower \"Slipping Away and Pieces\"). Lyrically the album also advances the case for these guys as strong songwriters.\" Diamond in the Rock said \"Although some hail Chuck as a complete departure from the band's enjoyable punk style, this album adds diversity to Sum 41's discography as the hardcore rock vibes lend to an engaging, albeit satisfactorily brief, sound.\" However, not all reviews were positive. Punknews.org was somewhat disappointed with the album, saying \"No one can deny the band's musical talent, and the more serious lyrical themes are a definite improvement, but the lack of consistency kills this album. The highlight of Sum 41's discography is going to come when they fully embrace their metal influences and make a straight-up metal album, and sadly Chuck misses the mark\", but also added \"If you are still under the impression that Sum 41 is a joke band or a [[Beastie Boys]]-wannabe, give some of these songs a try, and you may be pleasantly surprised.\"\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n|

The album was released on October 12, 2004. It is the band's last album to feature the full classic lineup, as lead guitarist [[Dave Baksh]] left Sum 41 on May 11, 2006 to pursue his career with his own band [[Brown Brigade]], but returned in 2015. ''Chuck'' peaked at No. 2 on the [[Canadian Albums Chart]] and No. 10 on the [[Billboard 200|US Billboard 200]], making it the band's highest-charting album until it would be surpassed by ''[[Underclass Hero]]'' in 2007.\n\nThe album's title is named after a [[UN]] peacekeeper named Chuck Pelletier who was in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] where Sum 41 was filming a documentary for [[War Child Canada]]. Fighting broke out during production and Chuck helped the band evacuate their hotel during the fighting; Chuck was also staying at that same hotel at the time. \n\nThe album\u2019s lyrical content has been described as darker and more mature than the band\u2019s previous work. It also had a slightly different sound, mixing in their [[punk rock]] influence with [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[adult contemporary music|adult alternative]]. The album proved to be a success, receiving acclaim from both critics and fans, as well as selling over 5 million copies. Singles such as \"We're All To Blame\" and \"Pieces\" gained success on the Canadian and American charts, and the album won a [[Juno Award]] for \"Rock Album of the Year\" in 2005.\n\n==Background==\nThe band's previous album ''[[Does This Look Infected]]'' became a commercial and critical success, and the band went on a tour in the album's support. In mid-2004, the band took a break from touring and filmed a documentary for [[War Child (charity)|War Child Canada]] in the Congo. The film was called ''[[Rocked: Sum 41 in Congo]]'' and was released in 2005 by [[MTV]]. However, fighting broke out during the filming while the band was staying in a hotel.\n\n\"The shooting was all around us, and all these people were waiting, probably to die,\" said drummer [[Steve Jocz]], reflecting on the experience. \"Two UN people arrived at the scene and gave a speech about how everything would be fine,\" bassist [[Jason McCaslin]] mentioned. \"And then after they left, things just went crazy\".\n\nVocalist/guitarist [[Deryck Whibley]] mentioned that he thought that a day after the UN gave an update about safety, he was expecting they would be able to evacuate. The next day, the band members woke up at 5:00 in the morning when two gunshots were fired. \"We went to the hotel's restaurant to get some breakfast, when the gunfire just got closer to us,\" said guitarist [[Dave Baksh]]. A U.N. peacekeeper named Charles \"Chuck\" Pelletier instructed the residents of the hotel to leave the restaurant (Pelletier was staying in the same hotel during that time). Whibley recalled, \"We all just went into McCaslin's room, where there was around 43 other people there. We were all hiding in the bathroom and hiding on the floor.\" Baksh added, \"Our U.N. peacekeeper was armed with a club, a new club because the price tag was still on it, but they were armed with guns\".\n\nPelletier continued to reassure the band and others at the hotel that everything would be okay. After the crowd was in hiding, Pelletier left to get help. The U.N. continued trying to find out as much information on the gunfire as possible, but updates were few. \"After a while, the gunfire seemed to start dying down, and then people started to go outside and they started talking. We seemed to be feeling pretty good, but then out of nowhere, the huge gunfire just went off,\" stated Whibley. \"This war was so unpredictable. At one point, it sounded like it was far away, and at another point, it sounded like it was right outside the door. Then Chuck came in and told everyone to wait for the APC's to arrive. That was probably the scariest part, when we were waiting to get into the APC's.\" Baksh recalled, \"I remember just waiting there and just wondering what the fuck was gonna happen.\"\n\nPelletier called for armored carriers to take the hotel's occupants out of the hot zone. \"By then, I  just kept thinking about everything we did as a band and everything I've done as a person, and I thought, 'This is it. This is how we're gonna die,'\" Whibley said. After nearly six hours, the carriers arrived, and the band and the forty other civilians were taken to safety. In honor of Pelletier, the band decided to name their next album after him.\n\n==Recording==\n\nWhen the band arrived back, the band members found themselves very depressed after what happened in the Congo. By spring of 2003, the band members went back to start practising parts for a new album on their own before going into a studio. \"The music's better, the songwriting's better, and there's more musical elements in this album,\" Jocz stated. \"We put more elements in this time around, and it feels like the next logical step in what we want our band to sound like\".\n\n\"We never wanted to make the same album over and over again. We've decided we wanted to do something different every time,\" said McCaslin. \"We started practicing on our own, and then we just put all of our parts together.\" The album was also mentioned to having a lot of heavy metal influences on it, with [[Metallica]] and [[Iron Maiden]] being main inspirations for the album's style. \"Dave was raised on a lot of heavy metal and grunge,\" McCaslin noted. \"Deryck and I were raised more on California punk rock music,\" said Jocz. \"When we started the band, we were mainly inspired by bands such as [[NOFX]] and [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]], but when you get older, your brain starts branching off and you start listening to other music.\"\n\nThe recording for the album went from spring 2003 to summer of 2004, and was released on October 12, 2004.\n\n==Composition==\n\n===Music and style===\n\nChuck has been described as [[alternative metal]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.banquetrecords.com/sum-41/underclass-hero/SRC093-sum41|title=Sum 41 - Underclass Hero|via=www.banquetrecords.com}}</ref> [[thrash metal]],<ref name=\"Toilet of Hell - Chuck\">{{Cite web|url=https://toiletovhell.com/sum-41-wrote-a-thrash-metal-album-when-you-werent-looking/|title=SUM 41 Wrote A Thrash Metal Album When You Weren\u2019t Looking|date=October 1, 2014}}</ref> [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]<ref name=\"Music OMH - Chuck\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/sum-41-chuck|title=Sum 41 - Chuck &#124; Albums|date=October 10, 2004}}</ref> and [[punk rock]];<ref name=theguardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/oct/08/popandrock.shopping4|title=CD: Sum 41, Chuck|author=Dave Simpson|work=the Guardian|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}</ref> by merging elements of [[hardcore punk]] and melodic hardcore with heavy metal.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Loftus |first1=Johnny |title=Sum 41 Chuck |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/chuck-mw0000301542 |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=October 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sum 41 Biography |url=https://www.hitthelights.co.uk/artist-directory/sum-41/ |accessdate=October 27, 2018}}</ref> On the sound of the album, the band have cited [[Metallica]] and [[Refused]] as major influences.<ref name=\"Guitar World\" />\n\nMichael Endelman of [[Entertainment Weekly]] described it as \"a meeting of two worlds \u2014 extreme metal and pop-savvy punk \u2014 that rarely pass each other in the halls, let alone hang out after school.\"<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\">{{cite web |last1=Endelman |first1=Michael |title=Chuck (2007-2012) |url=https://ew.com/article/2004/10/04/chuck/ |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=October 27, 2018}}</ref>\nDave Simpson at ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated \"The spiky quartet furnish their usual shouty vocals with grinding riffola and twiddly guitar solos, just as the rest of the post-Linkin Park world are realizing nu metal wasn't such a good idea.\"<ref name=theguardian/> Sum 41 abandoned the pop punk style with this album, according to Andrew Blackie of [[PopMatters]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/sum-41-underclass-hero/ |title=Sum 41: Underclass Hero |magazine=[[PopMatters]] |author=Andrew Blackie |date=August 21, 2007}}</ref> Alan di Perna of [[Guitar World]] magazine called it \"their heaviest album yet\", and as going from \"flirt[ing] with metal on both [prior] albums, but with Chuck they\u2019ve fully embraced it.\"<ref name=\"Guitar World\">{{cite journal |last1=di Perna |first1=Alan |title=Sum 41: Blow Up |journal=[[Guitar World]] |date=December 2004|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/features/sum-41-blow}}</ref>\nThe fifth and eleventh tracks on the album, [[Some Say]] and [[Pieces (Sum 41 song)|Pieces]] respectively, has been described as [[alternative rock]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Porter |first1=Brittany |title=The top ten best Sum 41 songs |url=https://www.axs.com/the-top-ten-best-sum-41-songs-103070 |website=[[AXS (company)|AXS]] |accessdate=November 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]] |date=December 2004 |page=142 |title=\"Sum 41 - Chuck\"}}</ref>\n\n===Lyrics===\n{{unsourced-section|date=May 2019}}\nThe album's lyrics have been described as being darker and more mature. Several songs focus on darker subject matters. Most of the lyrics on the album focus on politics and are influenced by the band's experience at the Congo. The album also focuses on other themes such as death (\"The Bitter End\"), depression (\"Slipping Away\"), anarchy in the world (\"I'm Not The One\"), and drug addiction (\"Angels With Dirty Faces\").\nThe band has mentioned that \"We're All To Blame\" is about the \"state of the world due to war, people dying, people living in fear, and the power of corporations, amongst other concerns.\" The band said \"Pieces\" \"is about a relationship, but not necessarily one with a girl. \"Maybe you're better left alone \u2014 fuck everybody else.\"\n\n==Commercial performance==\n\n''Chuck'' was a commercial success, selling over 5,000,000 copies worldwide. The album won [[Juno Awards of 2005|a Juno Award in 2005]] for ''Best Rock Album of the Year''.

[[Allmusic]] gave the album a positive review, saying \"''Chuck'' is a concise album that clocks in at just over a half-hour, with a basic understanding that fast and loud is what the band does best.\" [[Entertainment Weekly]] said that \"It may sound heinous on paper, but trust us, the first single, \"We're All To Blame,\" is far better than it has a right to be.\" E! Online said that \"But whether they're being snotty or serious, there is a constant thread at work: those catchy melodies.\" Music OMH said that ''Chuck'' \"isn't perfect\" but also added that \"Sum 41 have certainly added a heck of a lot more colour to their previously, partially monochrome musical output.\" Lane Devis of 411mania.com compared the album to [[Blink-182]]'s 2003 [[Blink-182 (album)|self-titled album]], [[Green Day]]'s ''[[American Idiot]]'', and [[Good Charlotte]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Life and Death]]'', saying \"The lyrics are serious in this album are far cries from the immature lyrics and antics that have become almost trademark for Sum 41.\" Common sense media gave it four stars out of five, saying \"Rugged intensity makes up for the diminished playfulness. Lyrics are clean but somber. You don't like your life, politics, or the world we live in? You might not be able to do much about it, but perhaps \u2013 following the example of Sum 41 \u2013 you can write some interesting, lyrical songs about the stuff that drives you crazy\", and also called it \"socially conscious punk rock\".\n\nDecoy Music said \"for the most part, it's obvious the band has grown up. There are some slower songs and some acoustic guitars and some ballads and all that good stuff. But the band still rocks hard 95% of the time and the fact they've gotten heavier actually accentuates their poppyness better than the punk aspect. The songs are still fast and guitar-driven, the drums are still extremely random and manic and awesome\u2014all in all, this is still a Sum 41 record. But it's just a better one.\" Stuart Green of exclaim.ca said \"Musically the band has never sounded more determined or cohesive (the notable exceptions being the Oasis sound-alike \"Some Say\" and the power mellower \"Slipping Away and Pieces\"). Lyrically the album also advances the case for these guys as strong songwriters.\" Diamond in the Rock said \"Although some hail Chuck as a complete departure from the band's enjoyable punk style, this album adds diversity to Sum 41's discography as the hardcore rock vibes lend to an engaging, albeit satisfactorily brief, sound.\" However, not all reviews were positive. Punknews.org was somewhat disappointed with the album, saying \"No one can deny the band's musical talent, and the more serious lyrical themes are a definite improvement, but the lack of consistency kills this album. The highlight of Sum 41's discography is going to come when they fully embrace their metal influences and make a straight-up metal album, and sadly Chuck misses the mark\", but also added \"If you are still under the impression that Sum 41 is a joke band or a [[Beastie Boys]]-wannabe, give some of these songs a try, and you may be pleasantly surprised.\"\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n|

He is contacted by the widow of an old friend, Elie Khoury. They had met ten years previously, in 1946, in [[Port Said]] after he had been thrown from a horse in front of the Khoury's [[beach hut]]. Mrs Khoury wants Townrow to go to see her in Cairo because she believes her husband was murdered.\n\nAfter thinking it through, Townrow accepts Mrs Khoury's offer of a plane ticket to Cairo. He stops over in [[Rome]] where he argues with two men, defending the British Government from its involvement in [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Final Solution]] campaign. The discussion ends on a friendly note.\n\nIn [[Cairo]], Townrow makes a joke about marrying Mrs Khoury for her money to an immigration officer, which leads to him being interrogated. He is kept in a cell and is released once his train has departed. Townrow doesn't go straightaway to see Mrs Khoury when he arrives in Port Said, instead opting to stay in a hotel. Here he considers having no one who really cares about him in his life.\n\nTownrow visits a bar he used to frequent while serving here as a sergeant. The owner of the bar, Christous, recognises him and kicks out his clientele for some privacy. Townrow asks about Elie's death.

He is contacted by the widow of an old friend, Elie Khoury. They had met ten years previously, in 1946, in [[Port Said]] after he had been thrown from a horse in front of the Khoury's [[beach hut]]. Mrs Khoury wants Townrow to go to see her in Cairo because she believes her husband was murdered.\n\nAfter thinking it through, Townrow accepts Mrs Khoury's offer of a plane ticket to Cairo. He stops over in [[Rome]] where he argues with two men, defending the British Government from its involvement in [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Final Solution]] campaign. The discussion ends on a friendly note.\n\nIn [[Cairo]], Townrow makes a joke about marrying Mrs Khoury for her money to an immigration officer, which leads to him being interrogated. He is kept in a cell and is released once his train has departed. Townrow doesn't go straightaway to see Mrs Khoury when he arrives in Port Said, instead opting to stay in a hotel. Here he considers having no one who really cares about him in his life.\n\nTownrow visits a bar he used to frequent while serving here as a sergeant. The owner of the bar, Christous, recognises him and kicks out his clientele for some privacy. Townrow asks about Elie's death. Christous tells him that Mrs Khoury, with great difficulty, took her husband's body back to [[Lebanon]] to be buried. Because of her actions, [[Colonel Nasser]] took the [[Suez Canal]] as [[Egypt]]'s.  Townrow is not sure whether to believe any of this and gets so drunk he blacks out.  He awakens naked and alone, and is attacked by a passing camel-driver, causing his head and one eye to be bandaged for most of the remainder of the novel.\n\nAfter the discussion with Christous and Townrow's subsequent blackout, the novel becomes much more dream-like and at times surreal, with Townrow a very unreliable narrator who cannot remember his nationality (though he asserts that he is Irish as part of a scam he tries to run on Mrs Khoury) nor whether his mother is alive.

He believed that there was serious market opportunity for [[Value investing|value investors]] in the coming months and after the collapse of [[American International Group|AIG]] and [[Lehman Brothers]], he invested heavily in the equity markets, sometimes throwing $100 million into stocks a day. While the market was down due to the aftermath of the crisis he purchased many distressed securities and bonds. By early 2009, after [[JPMorgan Chase]] acquired [[Washington Mutual]] as a part of their deal with the [[United States Department of the Treasury]], [[Sallie Mae]] bonds were returning double digit figures for Baupost. Overall, Klarman's bond position appreciated 25%, however, during the financial crisis, his fund returned -7% to -13%. Although many hedge funds faced negative returns and low performance during the crisis and its aftermath, Klarman saw increased equity positions and described it as a \"fortuitous time\" for the fund's [[capital gain]]s.<ref name=value/> The same year he would go on to buy a minority share in the [[Boston Red Sox]], via a stake in Ed Eskandarian.<ref name=value/>\n\nIn 2009, Klarman began buying distressed credits in the wake of the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]]. He purchased the bonds of [[CIT Group]], a financial holding company based in New York City at 65 cents on the dollar with a yield rate of 15%. After the company went into prepared bankruptcy, as Baupost began lending it money via a loan, [[Carl Icahn]] gave a loan of $6 billion to the CIT Group but backed out of the deal a week later. This caused the bonds to speed into prepared bankruptcy and gave the Baupost group securities valued at 80 cents to the dollar for their debt in CIT Group.<ref name=value/> Shortly after the CIT deal was finalized, Klarman amassed a stake in a new bio-tech company called FacetBiotech, at an average cost of $9 a share. At the time, FacetBiotech had $17 a share in net cash. Klarman noted that when stocks are spun off of their larger parent companies they become \"cheap and ignored.\"<ref name=value/> When [[Biogen]] eventually tried a [[Takeover|hostile takeover]] of the company bidding up the price to $14 a share, [[Abbott Laboratories]] asked for a $27 per share settlement for acquisition.

During an interview at [[Harvard Business School]], he stated: \"It turns out that value investing is something that is in your blood. There are people who just don't have the patience and discipline to do it, and there are people who do. So it leads me to think it's genetic.\"<ref name=alumni/>\n\nWhen asked what drives his fund's overall investment strategy and how value investing fits into the [[capital market]]s he replied:\n\n<blockquote>Firstly, Value investing is intellectually elegant. You're basically buying bargains. It also appeals because all the studies demonstrate that it works. People who chase growth, who chase high fliers, inevitably lose because they paid a premium price. They lose to the people who have more patience and more discipline. Third, it's easy to talk in the abstract, but in real life you see situations that are just plain mispriced, where an ignored, neglected, or abhorred company may be just as attractive as others in the same industry. In time, the discount will be corrected, and you will have the wind at your back as a holder of the stock.<ref name=alumni/></blockquote>\n\nKlarman has been an avid supporter of the teachings of [[Benjamin Graham]], and during the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]] criticized the short-term thinking of other fund managers, he believes that the \"this-time-is-different\" mindset will give a false sense of security to investors and they ought to look at the bigger picture. He stresses the [[utility]] in the economy's [[business cycle]]s and their predestined and perpetual self-corrective tendency.<ref name=alumni/> Klarman is known to sit on 30% to 50% of his funds in cash as to avoid unfavorable market conditions and only buys stocks he thinks have a suitable mispricing.<ref name=value/>\n\nHe makes unusual investments, buying unpopular assets while they are undervalued, using complex [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], and buying [[put option]]s. During his first years running Baupost, he made it a point to only invest in companies that were not widely accepted by the [[Wall Street]] community; he stressed managing risk and using the [[Margin of safety (financial)|margin of safety]].<ref name=value/> He is a very conservative investor, and often holds a significant amount of cash in his investment portfolios, sometimes in excess of 50% of the total.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.gurufocus.com/news/757717/seth-klarman-why-you-need-to-get-used-to-holding-cash | title=Seth Klarman: Why You Need to Get Used to Holding Cash | first=Rupert | last=Hargreaves | work=Guru Focus | date=October 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.valuewalk.com/2014/01/klarman-returns-cash/ | title=Klarman returns cash | first=Sheeraz | last=Raza | work=Value Walk | date=January 29, 2014}}</ref> Despite his unconventional strategies, he has consistently achieved high returns.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1815559420100518 Baupost's Klarman sees poor outlook for stocks] [[Reuters]], Aaron Pressman and Matthew Lewis.

He believed that there was serious market opportunity for [[Value investing|value investors]] in the coming months and after the collapse of [[American International Group|AIG]] and [[Lehman Brothers]], he invested heavily in the equity markets, sometimes throwing $100 million into stocks a day.

Overall, Klarman's bond position appreciated 25%, however, during the financial crisis, his fund returned -7% to -13%.

After the company went into prepared bankruptcy, as Baupost began lending it money via a loan, [[Carl Icahn]] gave a loan of $6 billion to the CIT Group but backed out of the deal a week later. This caused the bonds to speed into prepared bankruptcy and gave the Baupost group securities valued at 80 cents to the dollar for their debt in CIT Group.<ref name=value/> Shortly after the CIT deal was finalized, Klarman amassed a stake in a new bio-tech company called FacetBiotech, at an average cost of $9 a share.

During an interview at [[Harvard Business School]], he stated: \"It turns out that value investing is something that is in your blood. There are people who just don't have the patience and discipline to do it, and there are people who do. So it leads me to think it's genetic.\"<ref name=alumni/>\n\nWhen asked what drives his fund's overall investment strategy and how value investing fits into the [[capital market]]s he replied:\n\n<blockquote>Firstly, Value investing is intellectually elegant. You're basically buying bargains. It also appeals because all the studies demonstrate that it works. People who chase growth, who chase high fliers, inevitably lose because they paid a premium price. They lose to the people who have more patience and more discipline. Third, it's easy to talk in the abstract, but in real life you see situations that are just plain mispriced, where an ignored, neglected, or abhorred company may be just as attractive as others in the same industry. In time, the discount will be corrected, and you will have the wind at your back as a holder of the stock.<ref name=alumni/></blockquote>\n\nKlarman has been an avid supporter of the teachings of [[Benjamin Graham]], and during the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]] criticized the short-term thinking of other fund managers, he believes that the \"this-time-is-different\" mindset will give a false sense of security to investors and they ought to look at the bigger picture. He stresses the [[utility]] in the economy's [[business cycle]]s and their predestined and perpetual self-corrective tendency.<ref name=alumni/> Klarman is known to sit on 30% to 50% of his funds in cash as to avoid unfavorable market conditions and only buys stocks he thinks have a suitable mispricing.<ref name=value/>\n\nHe makes unusual investments, buying unpopular assets while they are undervalued, using complex [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], and buying [[put option]]s.

The first available evidence is of the [[Neolithic]].\nIn the early and middle [[Bronze Age]] the settlement came under [[Minoans|Minoan]] influence. Legend has it that an influx of Cretans occurred displacing the indigenous [[Leleges]]. The site was renamed Miletus after a place in [[Crete]].\n\nThe [[Late Bronze Age]], 13th century BC, saw the arrival of [[Luwian language]] speakers from south central Anatolia calling themselves the [[Carians]]. Later in that century other Greeks arrived. The city at that time rebelled against the [[Hittite Empire]]. After the fall of that empire the city was destroyed in the 12th century BC and starting about 1000&nbsp;BC was resettled extensively by the [[Ionians|Ionian Greeks]]. Legend offers an Ionian foundation event sponsored by a founder named Neleus from the [[Peloponnesus]].\n\nThe [[Greek Dark Ages]] were a time of Ionian settlement and consolidation in an alliance called the [[Ionian League]]. The [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]] of Greece began with a sudden and brilliant flash of art and philosophy on the coast of [[Anatolia]]. In the 6th century BC, Miletus was the site of origin of the Greek philosophical (and scientific) tradition, when [[Thales]], followed by [[Anaximander]] and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] (known collectively, to modern scholars, as the [[Milesian School]]) began to speculate about the material constitution of the world, and to propose speculative naturalistic (as opposed to traditional, supernatural) explanations for various natural phenomena.\n\nMiletus is the birthplace of the [[Hagia Sophia]]'s architect (and inventor of the [[flying buttress]]) [[Isidore of Miletus]] and [[Thales]], a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher (and one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]) in c. 624&nbsp;BC.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:DSC04508_Istanbul_-_Museo_archeol._-_Apollo_citaredo,_sec._II_dC_-_da_Mileto_-_Foto_G._Dall'Orto_28-5-2006.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Apollo statue from Miletus in [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]].]]\n[[File:MiletusIonicStoa.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Ionic Stoa on the Sacred Way]]\n[[File:MiletusTheater6August2005.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The Ionic Stoa on the Sacred Way]]\n\n=== Neolithic ===\nThe earliest available archaeological evidence indicates that the islands on which Miletus was originally placed were inhabited by a [[Neolithic]] population in 3500\u20133000&nbsp;BC.<ref name=crouch183>Crouch (2004) page 183.</ref> Pollen in core samples from Lake Bafa in the [[Latmus#Prehistory|Latmus]] region inland of Miletus suggests that a lightly grazed climax forest prevailed in the [[Maeander]] valley, otherwise untenanted. Sparse Neolithic settlements were made at [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]], numerous and sometimes [[geothermal]] in this karst, rift valley topography. The islands offshore were settled perhaps for their strategic significance at the mouth of the Maeander, a route inland protected by [[escarpment]]s. The [[Pastoralism|graziers]] in the valley may have belonged to them, but the location looked to the sea.\n\n=== Middle Bronze Age ===\nThe prehistoric archaeology of the Early and Middle Bronze Age portrays a city heavily influenced by society and events elsewhere in the Aegean, rather than inland.\n\n====Minoan period====\nBeginning at about 1900&nbsp;BC artifacts of the [[Minoan civilization]] acquired by trade arrived at Miletus.<ref name=crouch183/> For some centuries the location received a strong impulse from that civilization, an archaeological fact that tends to support but not necessarily confirm the founding legend\u2014that is, a population influx, from [[Crete]]. According to [[Strabo]]:<ref>Book 14 Section 1.6.</ref><blockquote>Ephorus says: Miletus was first founded and fortified above the sea by Cretans, where the Miletus of olden times is now situated, being settled by Sarpedon, who brought colonists from the Cretan Miletus and named the city after that Miletus, the place formerly being in possession of the [[Leleges]].</blockquote>The legends recounted as history by the ancient historians and geographers are perhaps the strongest; the late mythographers have nothing historically significant to relate.<ref>The late fantasy fiction of [[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses'' XXX 1\u20132 after Nicander, can be safely disregarded as being in any way history. His entertaining tales have the imaginary character named [[Miletus (hero)|Miletus]] fleeing [[Crete]] to avoid being forced to become the [[eromenos]] of King [[Minos]]. He founds the city only after slaying a giant named Asterius, son of Anax, after whom the region known as Miletus was called 'Anactoria', \"place of Anax.\" Anax in Greek means \"the king\" and Asterius is \"starry.\"</ref>\n\n=== Late Bronze Age ===\n[[File:Illustrerad_Verldshistoria_band_I_Ill_107.jpg|left|thumb|Miletus is the birthplace of [[Thales]], a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher (and one of the Seven Sages of Greece) in c. 624 BC.]]\n\n[[File:IONIA, Miletos.

[[Mur\u0161ili II|Mur\u0161ili]] ordered his generals [[Mala-Ziti]] and [[Gulla]] to raid Millawanda, and they proceeded to burn parts of it; damage from [[Helladic period|LHIIIA]] found on-site has been associated with this raid.<ref>Christopher Mee, ''Anatolia and the Aegean in the Late Bronze Age'', p.&nbsp;142</ref> In addition the town was fortified according to a Hittite plan.<ref>Mee, ''Anatolia and the Aegean'', p.&nbsp;139</ref>\n\nMiletus is then mentioned in the \"[[Tawagalawa letter]]\", part of a series including the [[Manapa-Tarhunta letter]] and the [[Milawata letter]], all of which are less securely dated. The Tawagalawa letter notes that Milawata had a governor, [[Atpa]], who was under the jurisdiction of ''[[Achaeans (Homer)#Hittite documents|Ahhiyawa]]'' (a growing state probably in [[Helladic period|LHIIIB]] [[Mycenaean Greece]]); and that the town of [[Atriya]] was under Milesian jurisdiction. The Manapa-Tarhunta letter also mentions Atpa. Together the two letters tell that the adventurer [[Piyama-Radu]] had humiliated Manapa-Tarhunta before Atpa (in addition to other misadventures); a Hittite king then chased Piyama-Radu into Millawanda and, in the Tawagalawa letter, requested Piyama-Radu's extradition to [[Hittite empire|Hatti]].\n\nThe Milawata letter mentions a joint expedition by the Hittite king and a [[Luwiyan]] vassal (probably [[Kupanta-Kurunta]] of Mira) against Miletus, and notes that the city (together with Atriya) was now under Hittite control.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n[[Homer]] mentions that during the time of the [[Trojan War]], Miletus was an ally of Troy and was city of the [[Carian]]s, under Nestor and [[Amphimachus]].<ref>''[[Iliad]]'', book II</ref>\n\nIn the last stage of LHIIIB, the citadel of bronze age [[Pylos]] counted among its female slaves a '' mi-ra-ti-ja'', [[Mycenaean Greek]] for \"women from Miletus\", written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.<ref>[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&wid=329 Palaeolexicon], Word study tool of ancient languages</ref> \n\n====Fall of Miletus====\nDuring the collapse of Bronze Age civilization, Miletus was burnt again, presumably by the [[Sea Peoples]].\n\n===Dark Age===\nMythographers told that Neleus, a son of [[Codrus]] the last [[King of Athens]], had come to Miletus after the \"[[Return of the Heraclids]]\" (so, during the [[Greek Dark Ages]]). The Ionians killed the men of Miletus and married their widows. This is the mythical commencement of the enduring alliance between Athens and Miletus, which played an important role in the subsequent [[Persian Wars]].\n\n===Archaic period===\n[[File:Map_of_Lydia_ancient_times-es.svg|thumb|Map of Miletus and other cities within the Lydian Empire]]\nThe city of Miletus became one of the [[Ionian League|twelve]] [[Ionia]]n cities of [[Asia Minor]].\n\nMiletus was one of the cities involved in the [[Lelantine War]] of the 8th century BC.\n\n====Ties with Megara====\nMiletus is known to have early ties with [[Megara]] in Greece. According to some scholars, these two cities had built up a \u201ccolonisation alliance\u201d.

Also, there are many parallels in the political organisation of both cities.<ref name=\"Alexander Herda research\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], the Megarians said that their town owed its origin to [[Car (Greek mythology)|Car]], the son of [[Phoroneus]], who built the city citadel called 'Caria'.<ref>Paus. i. 39. \u00a7 5, i. 40. \u00a7 6</ref> This 'Car of Megara' may or may not be one and the same as the 'Car of the Carians', also known as [[Car (King of Caria)]].\n\nIn the late 7th century BC, the tyrant [[Thrasybulus (tyrant)|Thrasybulus]] preserved the independence of Miletus during a 12-year war fought against the [[Lydian Empire]].<ref>''Miletos, the ornament of Ionia: history of the city to 400&nbsp;BCE'' by Vanessa B. Gorman (University of Michigan Press) 2001 \u2013 pg 123</ref> Thrasybulus was an ally of the famous [[Corinth]]ian tyrant [[Periander]].\n\nMiletus was an important center of philosophy and science, producing such men as [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]] and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]. Referring to this period, [[religious studies]] professor [[F. E. Peters]] described ''[[pan-deism]]'' as \"the legacy of the Milesians.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|title= Greek Philosophical Terms: A Historical Lexicon\n|url= https://archive.org/details/greekphilosophic0000pete\n|url-access= registration\n|author = [[Francis Edward Peters]]\n|year = 1967\n|ISBN = 0814765521\n|publisher = NYU Press\n|page = [https://archive.org/details/greekphilosophic0000pete/page/169 169]\n}}</ref>  \n\nBy the 6th century BC, Miletus had earned a maritime empire with many colonies, but brushed up against powerful [[Lydia]] at home, and the tyrant [[Polycrates]] of its neighbor to the west, [[Samos]].\n\n===First Achaemenid period===\nWhen [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] of Persia defeated [[Croesus]] of Lydia in the middle of the 6th century BC, Miletus fell under [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] rule. In 499 BC Miletus's [[tyrant]] [[Aristagoras]] became the leader of the [[Ionian Revolt]] against the Persians under [[Darius the Great]], who quashed this rebellion and punished Miletus by selling all of the women and children into slavery, killing the men, and expelling all of the young men as eunuchs, thereby assuring that no Miletus citizen would ever be born again. A year afterward, [[Phrynichus (tragic poet)|Phrynicus]] produced the tragedy ''The Capture of Miletus'' in Athens. The Athenians fined him for reminding them of their loss.\n\n===Classical Greek period===\n[[File:Miletos stadsplan 400.jpg|thumb|right|The plan of Milet in the Classical period]]\n[[File:Markttor_von_Milet.jpg|thumb|left|[[Market Gate of Miletus]]]]\n[[File:Market_building_of_Miletus_-_Pergamonmuseum_-_Berlin_-_Germany_2017.jpg|thumb|left|Miletus Agora door.]]\n\nIn 479 BC the Greeks decisively defeated the Persians on the Greek mainland at the [[Battle of Plataea]], and Miletus was freed of Persian rule. During this time several other cities were formed by [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesian]] settlers, spanning across what is now Turkey and even as far as [[Crimea]]. The city's gridlike layout became famous, serving as the basic layout for [[ancient Rome|Roman]] cities.\n\n===Second Achaemenid period===\n\nIn 387 BC the [[Peace of Antalcidas]] gave the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] under king [[Artaxerxes II]] control of the Greek city-states of [[Ionia]], including Miletus.\n\nIn 358 BC Artaxerxes II died and was succeeded by his son [[Artaxerxes III]], who in 355 BC forced Athens to conclude a peace which required its forces to leave Asia Minor (Anatolia) and acknowledge the independence of its rebellious allies.\n\n===Macedonian period===\n\nIn 334 BC the [[Siege of Miletus]] by the forces of [[Alexander the Great]] of Macedonia liberated the city from Persian rule, soon followed by most of Asia Minor. In this period the city reached its greatest extent, occupying  within its walls an area of approximately {{convert|90|ha}}.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Chant|editor1-first=Colin|editor2-last=Goodman|editor2-first=David|last=Chant|first=Colin|title=Pre-industrial Cities and Technology|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415200752|page=61|chapter=Greece|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MAhVazSIKM8C&pg=PA61}}</ref>\n\nWhen Alexander died in 323 BC, Miletus came under the control of Ptolemy, governor of [[Caria]] and his satrap of Lydia [[Asander]], who had become autonomous.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0dsLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA89 'The Life of Alexander the Great' by John Williams, Henry Ketcham, p. 89]</ref> In 312 BC, Macedonian general [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus]] sent Docimus and Medeius to free the city and grant autonomy, restoring the democratic patrimonial regime. In 301 BC, after Antigonus I was killed in the [[Battle of Ipsus]]  by the coalition of [[Lysimachus]], [[Cassander]], and [[Seleucus I Nicator]], founder of the [[Seleucid Empire]], Miletus maintained good relations with all the successors after Seleucus I Nicator made substantial donations to the sanctuary of Didyma and returned the statue of Apollo that had been stolen by the Persians in 494 BC.\n\nIn 295 BC Antigonus I's son [[Demetrius Poliorcetes]] was the eponymous archon (stephanephorus) in the city, which allied with [[Ptolemy I Soter]] of Egypt, while Lysimachus assumed power in the region, enforcing a strict policy towards the Greek cities by imposing high taxes, forcing Miletus to resort to lending.\n\n===Seleucid period===\nAround 287/286 BC Demetrius Poliorcetes returned, but failed to maintain his possessions and was imprisoned in Syria. Nicocles of Sidon, the commander of  Demetrius' fleet surrendered the city. Lysimachus dominated until 281 BC, when he was defeated by the Seleucids at the [[Battle of Corupedium]]. In 280/279 BC the Milesians adopted a new chronological system based on the Seleucids.\n\n===Egyptian period===\n[[File:Mosque_Ilyas_Bey_exterior.JPG|thumb|left|300px|An ottoman mosque from the Turkish period in Miletus site.]]\n\nIn 279 BC the city was taken from Seleucid king [[Antiochus II]] by Egyptian king [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], who donated a large area of land to cement their friendship, and it remained under Egyptian sway until the end of the century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhw.gr/choros/miletus/en/elinistiki.php?menu_id=5 |title=Hellenistic Period |website=www.fhw.gr |author=Foundation of the Hellenic World}}{{unreliable source|date=May 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Aristides of Miletus]], founder of the bawdy [[Milesian tale|Miletian school of literature]] flourished in the 2nd century BC.\n\n===Roman period===\nThe [[New Testament]] mentions Miletus as the site where the Apostle [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] in AD 57 met the elders of the [[Ecclesia (church)|church]] of [[Ephesus]] near the close of his Third Missionary Journey, as recorded in [[Acts of the Apostles]] (Acts 20:15\u201338). It is believed that Paul stopped by the Great Harbour Monument and sat on its steps. He might have met the Ephesian elders there and then bade them farewell on the nearby beach. Miletus is also the city where Paul left [[Trophimus]], one of his travelling companions, to recover from an illness ([[2 Timothy]] 4:20). Because this cannot be the same visit as Acts 20 (in which Trophimus accompanied Paul all the way to Jerusalem, according to Acts 21:29), Paul must have made at least one additional visit to Miletus, perhaps as late as AD 65 or 66. Paul's previous successful three-year ministry in nearby [[Ephesus]] resulted in the evangelization of the entire province of Asia (see Acts 19:10, 20; [[1 Corinthians]] 16:9). It is safe to assume that at least by the time of the apostle's second visit to Miletus, a fledgling Christian community was established in Miletus.\n\n===Byzantine period===\nDuring the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] age the [[see of Miletus]] was raised to an archbishopric and later a [[metropolitan bishopric]]. The small Byzantine castle called Palation located on the hill beside the city, was built at this time. Miletus was headed by a [[Curator bonis|curator]].<ref>The Byzantine aristocracy and its military function, Volume 859 of the Variorum collected studies series, Jean-Claude Cheynet, Ashgate Pub., 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-5902-0}}</ref><ref>Studies in Byzantine Sigillography, Volume 10, Jean-Claude Cheynet, Claudia Sode, published by Walter de Gruyter, 2010. {{ISBN|978-3-11-022704-8}}</ref>\n\n===Turkish rule===\n[[File:Miletus, Illustration for La Terre-Sainte et les lieux illustr\u00e9s par les ap\u00f4tres, by Adrien Egron, 1837 (39).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Illustration of Miletus]]\n[[Seljuk Turks]] conquered the city in the 14th century and used Miletus as a port to trade with [[Venice]].\n\nIn the 15th century the [[Ottomans]] utilized the city as a harbour during their rule in [[Anatolia]]. As the harbour became silted up, the city was abandoned. Due to ancient and subsequent [[deforestation]], overgrazing (mostly by goat herds), [[erosion]] and [[soil degradation]] the ruins of the city lie some {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the sea with [[sediment]]s filling the plain and bare hill ridges without soils and trees, a [[maquis shrubland]] remaining.\n\nThe [[\u0130lyas Bey Mosque|Ilyas Bey Complex]] from 1403 with its mosque is a [[Europa Nostra]] awarded cultural heritage site in Miletus.\n\n=== Archaeological excavations ===\nThe first excavations in Miletus were conducted by the French archaeologist [[Olivier Rayet]] in 1873, followed by the German archaeologists [[Julius H\u00fclsen]] and [[Theodor Wiegand]]<ref>Olivier Rayet and Thomas, Milet Et Le Golfe Latmique, Fouilles Et Explorations Archeologiques Publ, 1877 (reprint Nabu Press 2010 {{ISBN|1-141-62992-5}}</ref><ref>Theodor Wiegand and Julius H\u00fclsen [Das Nymphaeum von Milet, Museen zu Berlin 1919] and Kurt Krausem, Die Milesische Landschaft, Milet II, vol. 2, Schoetz, 1929</ref><ref>Theodor Wiegand et al., Der Latmos, Milet III, vol. 1, G.

It is currently exhibited at the [[Pergamon museum]] in [[Berlin]]. The main collection of artifacts resides in the ''Miletus Museum'' in [[Didim]], [[Ayd\u0131n]], serving since 1973.\n\n{{wide image|The_Theater_of_Miletus.jpg|549px|The theater of Miletus}}\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Miletus Bay silting evolution map-en.svg|thumb|right|250px|Location of Miletus at the [[B\u00fcy\u00fck Menderes River|Maeander River]]'s mouth]]\n\nThe ruins appear on satellite maps at 37\u00b031.8'N 27\u00b016.7'E, about 3&nbsp;km north of [[Balat, Didim|Balat]] and 3&nbsp;km east of [[Bat\u0131k\u00f6y, Didim|Bat\u0131k\u00f6y]] in [[Ayd\u0131n Province]], [[Turkey]].\n\nIn antiquity the city possessed a [[Harbor]] at the southern entry of a large bay, on which two more of the traditional twelve Ionian cities stood: [[Priene]] and [[Myus]]. The harbor of Miletus was additionally protected by the nearby small island of Lade. Over the centuries the gulf silted up with [[alluvium]] carried by the [[B\u00fcy\u00fck Menderes River|Meander]] River. Priene and Myus had lost their harbors by the Roman era, and Miletus itself became an inland town in the early Christian era; all three were abandoned to ruin as their economies were strangled by the lack of access to the sea. There is a Great Harbor Monument where, according to the New Testament account, the apostle Paul stopped on his way back to Jerusalem by boat. He met the Ephesian Elders and then headed out to the beach to bid them farewell, recorded in the book of Acts 20:17-38.\n\n=== Geology ===\nDuring the [[Pleistocene]] epoch the Miletus region was submerged in the [[Aegean Sea]]. It subsequently emerged slowly, the sea reaching a low level of about {{convert|130|m|sp=us}} below present level at about 18,000&nbsp;[[Before Present|BP]]. The site of Miletus was part of the mainland.\n\nA gradual rise brought a level of about {{convert|1.75|m|sp=us}} below present at about 5500&nbsp;BP, creating several [[karst]] block islands of limestone, the location of the first settlements at Miletus. At about 1500&nbsp;BC the karst shifted due to small crustal movements and the islands consolidated into a peninsula. Since then the sea has risen 1.75&nbsp;m but the peninsula has been surrounded by sediment from the [[Maeander]] river and is now land-locked. Sedimentation of the harbor began at about 1000&nbsp;BC, and by AD&nbsp;300 [[Lake Bafa]] had been created.<ref>Crouch (2004) page 180.</ref>\n\n== Colonies ==\n[[File:Colonies of Miletus.svg|360px|thumb|Map of the Black Sea, featuring the chronological phasing of major Milesian colonial foundations.]]\nMiletus became known for the great number of colonies it founded.

Graham page 98\n\u201cJudged by the number of its colonies Miletus was the most prolific of the Greek mother cities.

The first available evidence is of the [[Neolithic]].\nIn the early and middle [[Bronze Age]] the settlement came under [[Minoans|Minoan]] influence. Legend has it that an influx of Cretans occurred displacing the indigenous [[Leleges]]. The site was renamed Miletus after a place in [[Crete]].\n\nThe [[Late Bronze Age]], 13th century BC, saw the arrival of [[Luwian language]] speakers from south central Anatolia calling themselves the [[Carians]]. Later in that century other Greeks arrived. The city at that time rebelled against the [[Hittite Empire]]. After the fall of that empire the city was destroyed in the 12th century BC and starting about 1000&nbsp;BC was resettled extensively by the [[Ionians|Ionian Greeks]].

In the 6th century BC, Miletus was the site of origin of the Greek philosophical (and scientific) tradition, when [[Thales]], followed by [[Anaximander]] and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] (known collectively, to modern scholars, as the [[Milesian School]]) began to speculate about the material constitution of the world, and to propose speculative naturalistic (as opposed to traditional, supernatural) explanations for various natural phenomena.\n\nMiletus is the birthplace of the [[Hagia Sophia]]'s architect (and inventor of the [[flying buttress]]) [[Isidore of Miletus]] and [[Thales]], a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher (and one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]) in c. 624&nbsp;BC.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:DSC04508_Istanbul_-_Museo_archeol._-_Apollo_citaredo,_sec._II_dC_-_da_Mileto_-_Foto_G._Dall'Orto_28-5-2006.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Apollo statue from Miletus in [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]].]]\n[[File:MiletusIonicStoa.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Ionic Stoa on the Sacred Way]]\n[[File:MiletusTheater6August2005.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The Ionic Stoa on the Sacred Way]]\n\n=== Neolithic ===\nThe earliest available archaeological evidence indicates that the islands on which Miletus was originally placed were inhabited by a [[Neolithic]] population in 3500\u20133000&nbsp;BC.<ref name=crouch183>Crouch (2004) page 183.</ref> Pollen in core samples from Lake Bafa in the [[Latmus#Prehistory|Latmus]] region inland of Miletus suggests that a lightly grazed climax forest prevailed in the [[Maeander]] valley, otherwise untenanted. Sparse Neolithic settlements were made at [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]], numerous and sometimes [[geothermal]] in this karst, rift valley topography. The islands offshore were settled perhaps for their strategic significance at the mouth of the Maeander, a route inland protected by [[escarpment]]s. The [[Pastoralism|graziers]] in the valley may have belonged to them, but the location looked to the sea.\n\n=== Middle Bronze Age ===\nThe prehistoric archaeology of the Early and Middle Bronze Age portrays a city heavily influenced by society and events elsewhere in the Aegean, rather than inland.\n\n====Minoan period====\nBeginning at about 1900&nbsp;BC artifacts of the [[Minoan civilization]] acquired by trade arrived at Miletus.<ref name=crouch183/> For some centuries the location received a strong impulse from that civilization, an archaeological fact that tends to support but not necessarily confirm the founding legend\u2014that is, a population influx, from [[Crete]]. According to [[Strabo]]:<ref>Book 14 Section 1.6.</ref><blockquote>Ephorus says: Miletus was first founded and fortified above the sea by Cretans, where the Miletus of olden times is now situated, being settled by Sarpedon, who brought colonists from the Cretan Miletus and named the city after that Miletus, the place formerly being in possession of the [[Leleges]].</blockquote>The legends recounted as history by the ancient historians and geographers are perhaps the strongest; the late mythographers have nothing historically significant to relate.<ref>The late fantasy fiction of [[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses'' XXX 1\u20132 after Nicander, can be safely disregarded as being in any way history. His entertaining tales have the imaginary character named [[Miletus (hero)|Miletus]] fleeing [[Crete]] to avoid being forced to become the [[eromenos]] of King [[Minos]]. He founds the city only after slaying a giant named Asterius, son of Anax, after whom the region known as Miletus was called 'Anactoria', \"place of Anax.\" Anax in Greek means \"the king\" and Asterius is \"starry.\"</ref>\n\n=== Late Bronze Age ===\n[[File:Illustrerad_Verldshistoria_band_I_Ill_107.jpg|left|thumb|Miletus is the birthplace of [[Thales]], a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher (and one of the Seven Sages of Greece) in c. 624 BC.]]\n\n[[File:IONIA, Miletos.

The Tawagalawa letter notes that Milawata had a governor, [[Atpa]], who was under the jurisdiction of ''[[Achaeans (Homer)#Hittite documents|Ahhiyawa]]'' (a growing state probably in [[Helladic period|LHIIIB]] [[Mycenaean Greece]]); and that the town of [[Atriya]] was under Milesian jurisdiction. The Manapa-Tarhunta letter also mentions Atpa. Together the two letters tell that the adventurer [[Piyama-Radu]] had humiliated Manapa-Tarhunta before Atpa (in addition to other misadventures); a Hittite king then chased Piyama-Radu into Millawanda and, in the Tawagalawa letter, requested Piyama-Radu's extradition to [[Hittite empire|Hatti]].\n\nThe Milawata letter mentions a joint expedition by the Hittite king and a [[Luwiyan]] vassal (probably [[Kupanta-Kurunta]] of Mira) against Miletus, and notes that the city (together with Atriya) was now under Hittite control.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n[[Homer]] mentions that during the time of the [[Trojan War]], Miletus was an ally of Troy and was city of the [[Carian]]s, under Nestor and [[Amphimachus]].<ref>''[[Iliad]]'', book II</ref>\n\nIn the last stage of LHIIIB, the citadel of bronze age [[Pylos]] counted among its female slaves a '' mi-ra-ti-ja'', [[Mycenaean Greek]] for \"women from Miletus\", written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.<ref>[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&wid=329 Palaeolexicon], Word study tool of ancient languages</ref> \n\n====Fall of Miletus====\nDuring the collapse of Bronze Age civilization, Miletus was burnt again, presumably by the [[Sea Peoples]].\n\n===Dark Age===\nMythographers told that Neleus, a son of [[Codrus]] the last [[King of Athens]], had come to Miletus after the \"[[Return of the Heraclids]]\" (so, during the [[Greek Dark Ages]]).

Also, there are many parallels in the political organisation of both cities.<ref name=\"Alexander Herda research\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], the Megarians said that their town owed its origin to [[Car (Greek mythology)|Car]], the son of [[Phoroneus]], who built the city citadel called 'Caria'.<ref>Paus. i. 39. \u00a7 5, i. 40. \u00a7 6</ref> This 'Car of Megara' may or may not be one and the same as the 'Car of the Carians', also known as [[Car (King of Caria)]].\n\nIn the late 7th century BC, the tyrant [[Thrasybulus (tyrant)|Thrasybulus]] preserved the independence of Miletus during a 12-year war fought against the [[Lydian Empire]].<ref>''Miletos, the ornament of Ionia: history of the city to 400&nbsp;BCE'' by Vanessa B.

In 499 BC Miletus's [[tyrant]] [[Aristagoras]] became the leader of the [[Ionian Revolt]] against the Persians under [[Darius the Great]], who quashed this rebellion and punished Miletus by selling all of the women and children into slavery, killing the men, and expelling all of the young men as eunuchs, thereby assuring that no Miletus citizen would ever be born again. A year afterward, [[Phrynichus (tragic poet)|Phrynicus]] produced the tragedy ''The Capture of Miletus'' in Athens. The Athenians fined him for reminding them of their loss.\n\n===Classical Greek period===\n[[File:Miletos stadsplan 400.jpg|thumb|right|The plan of Milet in the Classical period]]\n[[File:Markttor_von_Milet.jpg|thumb|left|Market gate of Miletus]]\n[[File:Market_building_of_Miletus_-_Pergamonmuseum_-_Berlin_-_Germany_2017.jpg|thumb|left|Miletus Agora door.]]\n\nIn 479 BC the Greeks decisively defeated the Persians on the Greek mainland at the [[Battle of Plataea]], and Miletus was freed of Persian rule. During this time several other cities were formed by [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesian]] settlers, spanning across what is now Turkey and even as far as [[Crimea]]. The city's gridlike layout became famous, serving as the basic layout for [[ancient Rome|Roman]] cities.\n\n===Second Achaemenid period===\n\nIn 387 BC the [[Peace of Antalcidas]] gave the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] under king [[Artaxerxes II]] control of the Greek city-states of [[Ionia]], including Miletus.\n\nIn 358 BC Artaxerxes II died and was succeeded by his son [[Artaxerxes III]], who in 355 BC forced Athens to conclude a peace which required its forces to leave Asia Minor (Anatolia) and acknowledge the independence of its rebellious allies.\n\n===Macedonian period===\n\nIn 334 BC the [[Siege of Miletus]] by the forces of [[Alexander the Great]] of Macedonia liberated the city from Persian rule, soon followed by most of Asia Minor.

In 301 BC, after Antigonus I was killed in the [[Battle of Ipsus]]  by the coalition of [[Lysimachus]], [[Cassander]], and [[Seleucus I Nicator]], founder of the [[Seleucid Empire]], Miletus maintained good relations with all the successors after Seleucus I Nicator made substantial donations to the sanctuary of Didyma and returned the statue of Apollo that had been stolen by the Persians in 494 BC.\n\nIn 295 BC Antigonus I's son [[Demetrius Poliorcetes]] was the eponymous archon (stephanephorus) in the city, which allied with [[Ptolemy I Soter]] of Egypt, while Lysimachus assumed power in the region, enforcing a strict policy towards the Greek cities by imposing high taxes, forcing Miletus to resort to lending.\n\n===Seleucid period===\nAround 287/286 BC Demetrius Poliorcetes returned, but failed to maintain his possessions and was imprisoned in Syria. Nicocles of Sidon, the commander of  Demetrius' fleet surrendered the city. Lysimachus dominated until 281 BC, when he was defeated by the Seleucids at the [[Battle of Corupedium]]. In 280/279 BC the Milesians adopted a new chronological system based on the Seleucids.\n\n===Egyptian period===\n[[File:Mosque_Ilyas_Bey_exterior.JPG|thumb|left|300px|An ottoman mosque from the Turkish period in Miletus site.]]\n\nIn 279 BC the city was taken from Seleucid king [[Antiochus II]] by Egyptian king [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], who donated a large area of land to cement their friendship, and it remained under Egyptian sway until the end of the century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhw.gr/choros/miletus/en/elinistiki.php?menu_id=5 |title=Hellenistic Period |website=www.fhw.gr |author=Foundation of the Hellenic World}}{{unreliable source|date=May 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Aristides of Miletus]], founder of the bawdy [[Milesian tale|Miletian school of literature]] flourished in the 2nd century BC.\n\n===Roman period===\nThe [[New Testament]] mentions Miletus as the site where the Apostle [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] in AD 57 met the elders of the [[Ecclesia (church)|church]] of [[Ephesus]] near the close of his Third Missionary Journey, as recorded in [[Acts of the Apostles]] (Acts 20:15\u201338). It is believed that Paul stopped by the Great Harbour Monument and sat on its steps. He might have met the Ephesian elders there and then bade them farewell on the nearby beach. Miletus is also the city where Paul left [[Trophimus]], one of his travelling companions, to recover from an illness ([[2 Timothy]] 4:20). Because this cannot be the same visit as Acts 20 (in which Trophimus accompanied Paul all the way to Jerusalem, according to Acts 21:29), Paul must have made at least one additional visit to Miletus, perhaps as late as AD 65 or 66. Paul's previous successful three-year ministry in nearby [[Ephesus]] resulted in the evangelization of the entire province of Asia (see Acts 19:10, 20; [[1 Corinthians]] 16:9). It is safe to assume that at least by the time of the apostle's second visit to Miletus, a fledgling Christian community was established in Miletus.\n\n===Byzantine period===\nDuring the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] age the [[see of Miletus]] was raised to an archbishopric and later a [[metropolitan bishopric]]. The small Byzantine castle called Palation located on the hill beside the city, was built at this time.

The harbor of Miletus was additionally protected by the nearby small island of Lade. Over the centuries the gulf silted up with [[alluvium]] carried by the [[B\u00fcy\u00fck Menderes River|Meander]] River. Priene and Myus had lost their harbors by the Roman era, and Miletus itself became an inland town in the early Christian era; all three were abandoned to ruin as their economies were strangled by the lack of access to the sea. There is a Great Harbor Monument where, according to the New Testament account, the apostle Paul stopped on his way back to Jerusalem by boat. He met the Ephesian Elders and then headed out to the beach to bid them farewell, recorded in the book of Acts 20:17-38.\n\n=== Geology ===\nDuring the [[Pleistocene]] epoch the Miletus region was submerged in the [[Aegean Sea]]. It subsequently emerged slowly, the sea reaching a low level of about {{convert|130|m|sp=us}} below present level at about 18,000&nbsp;[[Before Present|BP]]. The site of Miletus was part of the mainland.\n\nA gradual rise brought a level of about {{convert|1.75|m|sp=us}} below present at about 5500&nbsp;BP, creating several [[karst]] block islands of limestone, the location of the first settlements at Miletus. At about 1500&nbsp;BC the karst shifted due to small crustal movements and the islands consolidated into a peninsula. Since then the sea has risen 1.75&nbsp;m but the peninsula has been surrounded by sediment from the [[Maeander]] river and is now land-locked. Sedimentation of the harbor began at about 1000&nbsp;BC, and by AD&nbsp;300 [[Lake Bafa]] had been created.<ref>Crouch (2004) page 180.</ref>\n\n== Colonies ==\n[[File:Colonies of Miletus.svg|360px|thumb|Map of the Black Sea, featuring the chronological phasing of major Milesian colonial foundations.]]\nMiletus became known for the great number of colonies it founded.

But Biafra wasn't interested in recycling old ideas and he suggested a song called \"Biotech Is Godzilla\", that he had written during his visit to Eco '92, a world conference about ecology organized in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. \"Jello spent ten minutes explaining me his crazy theories\", said Max to Anamaria G. of ''Bizz'' magazine, \"he said that [[George H.

It was an entirely acoustic track, with [[Andreas Kisser]] and [[Max Cavalera]] on the guitars and brother-drummer [[Igor Cavalera]] and bassist [[Paulo Jr.]] handling the percussion duties. When they recorded \"Kaiowas\", the quartet never even considered playing the track live, because they thought it would be too difficult to recreate the drumming on stage. They changed their minds after seeing a video of the American band [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]]: \"We saw in that live video that the Neurosis guys put down their guitars and everybody started to play the drums on stage\", lead guitarist Andreas remembers. \"We decided to try the same thing.

Max had called Biafra asking him to contribute to the album with a song about the growing neo-Nazi movement. \"I asked for something like 'Nazi Punks Fuck Off - Part 2'\", remembers Max, referring to the anti-Nazi song \"[[Nazi Punks Fuck Off]]\" by the [[Dead Kennedys]]. But Biafra wasn't interested in recycling old ideas and he suggested a song called \"Biotech Is Godzilla\", that he had written during his visit to Eco '92, a world conference about ecology organized in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. \"Jello spent ten minutes explaining me his crazy theories\", said Max to Anamaria G. of ''Bizz'' magazine, \"he said that [[George H. W. Bush|George Bush]] had sent a group of scientists to [[Brazil]] to test germs and bacteria on human beings and use them as guinea pigs. The lyrics claim that [[biotechnology]] created [[AIDS]].
