The third scene features Bedingfield at a [[nightclub]] flirting with yet another man, before they are shown together at his home. In the final scene, she meets a man working at a coffee shop. They are shown in a play room with multiple babies. The video ends with Bedingfield hugging the coffee shop worker, who appears to unfortunately not to be deterred by her thoughts about having babies. \n\n[[Nadine Coyle]], member of the pop group [[Girls Aloud]], makes a [[cameo appearance]] in the nightclub scene. The complete version of \"I Wanna Have Your Babies\" featured in the music video has been released commercially through [[CD single]]s and [[music download|digital download]]s, and some include remixes by Snowflakers. The video debuted on Bedingfield's official [[Bebo]] website on 6 March 2007. On 21 May 2007, the video debuted in North America on Bedingfield's official U.S. website under the title \"Babies\". The music video for \"I Wanna Have Your Babies\" was mocked in an article written by Anna Pickard and published in ''[[The Guardian]]''. Pickard made fun of Bedingfield's \"clean-cut, straight-toothed, good [[Christians|Christian]] girl\" image, writing that the video was an effort by Bedingfield and her management to be provocative to sell more records.<ref>Anna Pickard.

He introduced a policy initiative to this effect at a press conference in late 2000, in which he dramatically cast a box of [[syringe]]s onto the floor and said that his department planned to \"stop people from shooting their welfare cheque up their arm, and to help them shoot up the ladder of success\".

The Energy ministry came under intense media scrutiny in late 2002 after hydro rates increased significantly in many parts of the province. Critics argued that the Progressive Conservative government's price deregulation policy (implemented before Baird became Energy Minister) was responsible. Baird suggested that the rate increases resulted from an unusually hot summer.<ref>Chinta Puxley and Fred Vallance-Jones, \"High bills shock consumers\", ''Hamilton Spectator'', September 25, 2002, pg.

The energy policies of the Eves government were controversial, but opposition criticism was often directed at the premier rather than at Baird. Eves took a prominent interest in the Energy portfolio, and sometimes relegated Baird to a secondary role in policy announcements.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/ontariovotes2003/features/cabinet_100103.html \"Ontario Votes 2003\"], CBC; accessed September 6, 2015.</ref> In November 2002, however, he was followed around the province by \"Hydrozilla\", a man in a giant lizard suit sent by the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] as a stunt to show that deregulating electricity rates would create an 'economic monster' for consumers.<ref>Robert Benzie and Graham Richardson, \"They're calling it 'Electrocution Week'\", ''National Post'', November 18, 2002, pg.

The ''[[Federal Accountability Act|Accountability Act]]'' promised significant reform to the structure of Canadian politics and government. Prime Minister Harper said that it would \"put an end to the influence of money\" in the Canadian government. The ''Accountability Act'' restricted the ability of former politicians and bureaucrats to become lobbyists, provided protection to whistle-blowers in the civil service and gave the [[Auditor General of Canada]] new powers of oversight. It limited individual donations to political parties and candidates to $1,100 per year (down from $5,200), created nine new or revised positions to oversee the activities of public officials and placed [[Crown corporation#Commonwealth|crown corporations]] such as the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] under [[Access to Information Act|access-to-information legislation]].<ref>Allan Woods, \"No more 'entitlements': PM\", ''National Post'', April 12, 2006, pg.

The plan calls for Canada to begin cutting its existing rate of greenhouse gas emissions by 2010 and for cuts to reach 20% by 2020. Under this plan, Canada will reach its Kyoto targets between 2020 and 2025, taking an additional eight to thirteen years longer than Kyoto. The government plan uses production intensity targets instead of hard caps. Baird said that the \"plan strikes a balance between the perfection some environmentalists may be seeking and the status quo that some in industry seek to protect.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/baird-s-real-emissions-plan-misses-kyoto-deadline-by-years-1.642692 |title=Baird's 'real' emissions plan misses Kyoto deadline by years |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2007-04-26 |accessdate=2014-04-12}}</ref> In December 2007, Baird revealed in a plan that over 700 big-polluter companies, including oil and gas, pulp and paper, electricity and iron and steel companies, must cut greenhouse emissions by six percent between 2008 and 2010.

During a parliamentary debate, Baird defended his government's environmental record by quoting Gore as saying that Canada was \"showing moral authority to the rest of the world\" in its policies on [[climate change]]. Gore responded that his comments were made to encourage the Harper government to participate in the Kyoto process, and said that Baird had \"mischaracterized\" his words by presenting them out of context.

In direct defiance of this international legal obligation, in March 2007, Baird indicated that he wanted Canadian companies to be banned, or at least severely restricted, from participating in the international carbon market. Several European countries had already set up a trading system to allow companies that reduce their emission levels below government targets to sell \"credits\" on an international market. Many industry leaders argued that Canada should adopt a similar policy. Then-opposition leader [[St\u00e9phane Dion]] argued that participation will allow Canadian firms to make \"megatonnes of money\".

The contract, signed when [[Janet Ecker]] was Community and Social Services minister, entrusted Andersen with providing technological upgrades to the province's welfare management system.

The ''[[Federal Accountability Act|Accountability Act]]'' promised significant reform to the structure of Canadian politics and government. Prime Minister Harper said that it would \"put an end to the influence of money\" in the Canadian government. The ''Accountability Act'' restricted the ability of former politicians and bureaucrats to become lobbyists, provided protection to whistle-blowers in the civil service and gave the [[Auditor General of Canada]] new powers of oversight. It limited individual donations to political parties and candidates to $1,100 per year (down from $5,200), created nine new or revised positions to oversee the activities of public officials and placed [[Crown corporation#Commonwealth|crown corporations]] such as the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] under [[Access to Information Act|access-to-information legislation]].<ref>Allan Woods, \"No more 'entitlements': PM\", ''National Post'', April 12, 2006, pg.

Under this plan, Canada will reach its Kyoto targets between 2020 and 2025, taking an additional eight to thirteen years longer than Kyoto.

Several European countries had already set up a trading system to allow companies that reduce their emission levels below government targets to sell \"credits\" on an international market. Many industry leaders argued that Canada should adopt a similar policy. Then-opposition leader [[St\u00e9phane Dion]] argued that participation will allow Canadian firms to make \"megatonnes of money\". Baird however described some carbon markets as \"shaky,\" and argued that trade should be restricted to within Canada, or perhaps within North America.<ref>Bill Curry and Gloria Galloway, \"Baird wants ban or limits on carbon market\", ''Globe and Mail'', March 23, 2007, pg.

He was raised by his grandparents, James Macansh (also a flax heckler) and Mary Spittal Macansh. His grandfather died in 1805. \nMacansh's memories of his early life are all of his grandmother, whom he memorialized in the following poem.<ref>Poem ''Mary Spittal Macansh''  from ''Working Man's Bye Hours''  by Alexander Macansh, published Dunfermline 1866, p 37</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n<blockquote><poem>\nWell I remember all her homely ways\nHer cup of tea at early morning tide.\nWhen, creeping from our curtained sleeping place\nI nestled down, half naked, at her side.\nReceiving from her kind, ungrudging hand\nThe other crust and, with the other crust,\nSome fondling token of maternal trust.\nWell I remember how each Sabbath morn\nShe dressed and trimmed me out, and led me down\nTo the small village kirk, so old and worn\nI firmly holding by her mourning gown\nDressed in my Highland kilt and milk-white hose\nShe in her widow weeds and high-heeled shoon,\nAbove her tremulous head and shoulders rose.\n</poem></blockquote>\nMacansh started his education at the village school at the age of five or six.  He remembered the habit of Mr Young, the domini, of dismissing his pupils at the end of each day with a Latin quotation.<ref>''Dunfermline Men of Mark''  by JD Mackie published Dunfermline 1906. Vol 3 p 75</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}  At age 11, Macansh was apprenticed to a flax dresser in Dunfermline. In his poem he remembered\n<blockquote><poem>\n....that dark winter morn when Mary stood -\nstood with me in the lamp-light at her door.\nHer withered cheek o'er glistening with the dew\nOf farewell sorrow; for she inly knew\nWe were about to part for evermore -\nShe to the skies, and I to wander forth,\nOur ways divided wide as heaven and earth.\n</poem></blockquote>\nIn 1814, Macansh started his apprenticeship in a 'sale shop',  In this shop, a few men manually prepared [[flax]] for women working at their spinning wheels in their own homes.<ref>''Working Man's Bye-hours'' p 57</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}} The final process in the preparation of flax for spinning was the combing out of the fibres with an implement called a heckle and the men who did the work were called either 'hecklers' or, more often, flax dressers.  \n\nIn 1816 Andrew Rutherford opened a further mill at Harribrae, Dunfermline, manufacturing white and coloured yarns for table linen, [[ticking]], [[Sheeting|sheetings]], [[Terrycloth|towellings]] and shirting,<ref>''The History of Dunfermline'' by Andrew Mercer published Dunfermline 1828, p 162</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}} Macansh's father was an overseer at Rutherford's mill and probably got his son a job in 1819 in one of the heckling shops,.  \n\nMacansh worked at the mill until it closed in 1852.<ref>''Working Man's Bye Hours'' p 87</ref> \n== The Heckling Shop ==\nMacansh described his time in Rutherford's in an article called 'The Politics of the Workshop'.  It was published in instalments in 1854 in ''The Northern Warder and General Advertiser for the Counties of Fife, Perth, and Forfar.''  Macansh later updated the article for his [[anthology]] ''Working Man's Bye Hours,'' published in 1866.  \n\n'The Politics of the Workshop' described the political discussions of his fellow workers and  their working conditions. <blockquote>The shop in which I wrought thirty years ago\u2026.held a dozen of us, six on each side with a window between every two. The centre of this window was a glazed fixture, the upper and under parts of this were hinged wooden blinds that could be lifted up or lowered down for the admission of fresh air or the emission of dust. In the winter months, November and December especially, this dust, the exhalation of a decayed vegetation, hung over our heads in a cloud so dense that one of my shopmates used to say, playfully, that he could write his name on it This was not the most Arcadian atmosphere for men to labour in from six in the morning till eight at night and not alone for days but for months and years. Many of the men were asthmatic and all were affected more or less with shortness of breath. Out of the dozen in our shop and six in another close by belonging to the same employers, are all dead with the exception of myself and another man.<ref>''Working Man's Bye Hours'' p 95</ref></blockquote>At age 16, according to Macansh, he was 'attacked with severe pains in his limbs, which, accompanied with a series of cruel accidents reduced him ere he attained his twenty-first year \"to a state of dwarfish deformity\".  This disability exposed him to 'the constant taunts and jeers of his rougher fellow-workmen and the still more torturing expressions of pity from the more kindly-hearted'..<ref>''Dunfermline Men of Mark''  Vol 3 p 73</ref> <blockquote>\u2018The trade at which the writer was employed for thirty-eight years \u2013 that of a flax dresser \u2013 was of that kind with permits conversation during working hours. The noise is not such as to drown the sound of the voice, but in a large shop, in which a dozen, or perhaps a score of heckles, are ringing, it is so great as to require the voice to be pitched on a rather high key, that the words may be heard and understood. Hecklers, for this reason, have a rather disagreeable habit of talking and reading in the octave key, even in a private room where there is not necessity for any particular elevation of voice.'<ref>''Working Man's Bye Hours'' p 55</ref></blockquote>Macansh also described a pet bird in the shop and the hecklers' excursions into the countryside with a donkey they had adopted.<blockquote>....we had a shop bird \u2013 indeed we almost always had a bird of some sort \u2013 a blackbird, a mavis (song thrush) or a linnet\u2026.The bird in question was a green linnet, a fine, strong chap with the closest and glossiest plumage. Dick would feed from the hand, perch upon a shoulder and, above everything in the world, delight in a fight. He would stand in the door of his cage and bending cock-fashion, unshuffled his tippet and attack the finger\u2026.We always left his cage door open and gave him full liberty of wing and Dick would suddenly bolt out of his wired domicile and disappearing in the wood behind the shop or west in the fields, be absent for hours amusing himself, how or where no-one could say. Then, all at once, he would dive in through one of the windows and, after taking a sweep two or three times round, would again enter his cage and be tail-up in his seed box ere one could count two. One day when the shopmates were in a very disagreeable mood, launching uncourteous epithets at each other, Dick suddenly swooped in through an open window from one of his excursions and circling round overhead, made a salute at every paper cap as he passed. The effect was electric. A good-humoured laugh took the place of angry invectives and a harmonious conversation followed.<ref>''Working Man's Bye Hours'' p 102</ref></blockquote>In Macansh's article, he described the lifestyles that produced differing political opinions, beginning with the aristocrat, followed by the middle class merchant and ending with the workman.<blockquote>The poor workman, again, standing at the foot of the social ladder is by position a Radical - a Chartist. He says, \"It is no fault of mine that I am poor, but because I am poor I am disenfranchised, am I? My father, like myself, was a hard working man, with a numerous family and he might have been, in the opinion of these two gentlemen up the trap, not very intelligent. I got little or no schooling. How could I? My mother set me down at the pirn wheel when I was nine years of age. Thence I was sent to the loom when I was eleven. Unfit to pace the treadles from the brevity of my yet ungrown limbs, they had at first to nail bars to enable me to work them with success. I wrought at the trade of making table covers for the more fortunate portions of society for many years, giving my earnings to my parents to enable them to live and bring up the rest and I arrived at manhood with one suit of clothes and my brain as unfurnished as my back with anything more substantial than politics.<ref>''Working Man's Bye Hours'' p 50</ref></blockquote>It was the custom of the men in the heckling shop to buy various newspapers and they took turns at reading them out loud while the work went on. <blockquote>We had two newspapers and a weekly political pamphlet. One of them was the ''Scotsman'', not generally liked by our Radical shopmates, for it was then, thirty-five years ago, now forty-seven, wholly literary and political and the tone of its articles, though the most liberal in Scotland at that period, did not come up to our men's ideas of the true Radical standard. The favourites were ''Wooler's Gazette''  and his ''Black Dwarf'', the former long since defunct - a firebrand and, like all its class, as stupid as it was violent. The latter a firebrand also....We read by turns, column about, commencing with the editor's commentary, then the Parliamentary debates, then the miscellaneous matter - a murder or a horrible accident always having the preference.<ref>''Working Man's Bye Hours'' p 55</ref></blockquote>\n== Scholar, Poet, Journalist and Lecturer ==\nAfter working a 14-hour day in the mill,  Macansh would eat supper and then start studying.<blockquote>In his humble abode in one of the closes off the High Street of Dunfermline, he held championship with the greatest and brightest of intellects. He resumed the Latin studies which fascinated him in his early boyhood at Doune, when old Mr Young, the village schoolmaster, was wont to dismiss his scholars with a classical phrase and caused a far-sounding shout of Ad scholam to be piped when the hour for opening the school approached. He also taught himself French and two or three other Continental languages, without, of course, becoming scholastically proficient; and I think he also knew a little Greek and Hebrew, on which he occasionally held consultations with his friend the Rev. James Mackenzie of the Free Abbey Church. He kept well abreast, too, with modern science and literature, as his published essays and lectures show. He was held in respect by the most cultured men in the town.<ref>''Dunfermline Men of Mark'' Vol 3 p 75</ref></blockquote>In 1850, Macansh's anthology ''The Social Curse (or Intemperance): A Rhyme and Other Pieces'' was published in Edinburgh. The 'Rhyme' of the title extended to fifty-three pages and was accompanied by fifty-three 'Other Pieces'.<ref>''The Annals of Dunfermline'' p 663</ref> Several of his poems had already been published in [[The Scotsman|the ''Scotsman'']] in 1828 and 1830, ''[[Tait's Magazine]]''<ref>''Dunfermline Men of Mark'' p 69</ref> and ''The Edinburgh Literary Journal''.<ref>''The Dunfermline Saturday Press'' 24 November 1866.

The minimum option period for position players remains 10 days. \n* Teams must designate players as either \"position players\" or \"pitchers\" before the start of the season.\n** Only players designated as pitchers will be allowed to pitch in any regular-season or postseason game, with limited exceptions (such as one team leading by at least seven runs, or the game going into [[extra innings]]).\n** Once a player has pitched at least 20 innings ''and'' made at least three plate appearances as a position player or designated hitter in each of 20 games, he earns the status of \"two-way player\" for the remainder of the season plus all of the next season. Players with this status may pitch at any time during a game. For this season only, any player who met the above requirements in either the 2018 or 2019 season qualifies for two-way status.\n** Players designated as pitchers, if placed on the [[injured list]], must spend a minimum of 15 days on the IL prior to being eligible for activation. Position players may be activated after a minimum of 10 days on the IL. Two-way players are subject to the rules for pitchers. The 7-day minimum on the IL for concussions remains unchanged.\n* A pitcher must face at least three batters, unless the inning ends or the pitcher is injured.\n* Managers now have up to 20 seconds to challenge a play (reduced from 30 seconds).\n<!--\n==Milestones==\n-->\n\n==Uniforms==\nOn January 25, 2019, it was announced that [[Nike Inc.]] would become the new exclusive uniform supplier for all MLB teams, under a 10-year deal beginning in the 2020 season.

Other versions of the game were met with a similarly positive response from reviewers. Its critical success would prompt the development of a sequel eight months later; ''[[Switchblade II]]'', which was created by a new team at Gremlin Graphics without the involvement of Phipps and garnered a positive reception from the public as with the original title upon its release on Amiga, however it was not widely ported to the other platforms.<ref name=\"SBIf\">{{cite magazine|last=Slingsby|first=Dan|url=https://archive.org/details/cuamiga-magazine-014/page/n61|title=Screenscene - Switchblade II|magazine=[[Commodore User#CU Amiga|CU Amiga]]|issue=14|publisher=[[EMAP]]|date=April 1991|pages=63\u201364}}</ref><ref name=\"SBIg\">{{cite web|last=Driscoll|first=Paul|url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games90/switchblade-2/|title=Switchblade 2|publisher=[[Retro Gamer]]|date=8 August 2009|access-date=1 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910180340/http://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games90/switchblade-2/|archive-date=10 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ST Switchblade.gif|thumb|left|Atari ST version screenshot.]]\n''Switchblade'' is a side-scrolling action-platform game with run and gun elements where players assume the role of Hiro on his quest through a subterranean labyrinth in Undercity, fighting against enemies and avoiding hazards in order to reunite 16 scattered fragments of the sacred Fireblade [[sword]] and use it against Havok, an evil entity who broke free from his imprisonment.<ref name=\"SBIa\"/><ref name=\"SBImanual\">''Switchblade'' manual (Amstrad GX4000, EU)</ref>\n\nThe player guides Hiro in a [[flip-screen]] environment, where unexplored areas of the screen are obscured from view until the player character enters them. Depending on the level of charge, Hiro can use melee attacks against enemies and he can also use weapons that are found in either crates, hidden on certain rooms or suddenly appearing in the area, which are equipped into his cybernetic arm.<ref name=\"SBIa\"/><ref name=\"SBImanual\"/>\n\nThe player also fights [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]]es that are blocking the current path in order to progress further. Players can also collect letters spelling bonus and extra, which grants points and an extra life respectively. All of the actions in the game are performed different depending on the version, with one button and a joystick in the home computer versions, while the [[d-pad]] and two buttons are used in the GX4000 version. Losing a life gives Hiro a brief period of invincibility but once all lives are lost in the playthrough, the [[Game over|game is over]], forcing players to restart from the beginning.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n''Switchblade'' takes place in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] future where the Undercity in the Cyberworld of Traxx has been submerged into chaos and slaughtering with the awakening of Havok from his 10,000 year slumber, an evil entity who broke free from his imprisonment once the sacred Fireblade and its power vanished after being shattered into pieces, along with the death of the Blade Knights order. Hiro, the last of the deceased knight order, embarks on a quest to restore the Fireblade and defeat Havok to end his evil regime.<ref name=\"SBImanual\"/>\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:Atari 1040STf.jpg|thumb|right|''Switchblade'' was Simon Phipps' first written title for the Atari ST, inspired by Japanese and Western pop culture.]]\n''Switchblade'' was solely created by Core Design co-founder Simon Phipps in his spare time and became the first title he wrote for the Atari ST, however due to the nature of its development process, it took approximately eighteen months in reaching completion while he began and finished various other projects at his company, most notably ''Rick Dangerous'', with Phipps stating he desired producing a project that felt similar to [[Arcade game|arcade]] and home console titles during this era due to his fascination with Japanese artwork.<ref name=\"SBIb\"/><ref name=\"TOSTsbI\"/><ref name=\"ZAmigaSTsbI\"/><ref name=\"RG70sb\"/>\n\nSeveral pieces of media from both Japanese and Western pop culture served as sources of inspiration for the project such as ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[Cities of the Red Night]]'', ''[[Mad Max]]'' and ''[[The Wild Boys (song)#Music video|The Wild Boys]]'' [[music video]], as well as video games like ''[[Bubble Bobble]]'', ''[[Ranarama]]'' and ''[[Underwurlde]]'', which would influence various gameplay mechanics in the final product, in addition to disadvantages with the ST hardware that also affected its design structure.<ref name=\"SBIb\"/><ref name=\"TOSTsbI\"/> Phipps stated that he enjoyed making the game, as he did not face deadlines and pressure, citing his then-artistic and technical abilities as the project's only limitations.<ref name=\"SBIb\"/><ref name=\"ZAmigaSTsbI\"/> However, Phipps stated on his [[personal web page]] about the game's development cycle that due to his constantly improving programming experience while working on other titles at Core Design, he regressed back to previously written code for improvement, referring it as the only negative of the project.<ref name=\"SBIb\"/> The music was composed by [[Ben Daglish]].<ref name=\"SBIb\"/>\n\n== Release ==\n''Switchblade'' was first released for the Atari ST and later the Amiga in Europe in December 1989, with minimal differences between each one.<ref name=\"SBIa\"/><ref name=\"SBIb\"/> In [[1990 in video gaming|1990]], an enhanced [[Video game conversion|conversion]] of the game was published by Gremlin Graphics for the Amstrad GX4000 and made use of the system's Mode 1, which allowed a 320x200 resolution display and more [[color]]s on-screen.<ref name=\"SBIe\"/> It was also ported to the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum by Gremlin as well in [[1991 in video gaming|1991]].<ref name=\"SBIa\"/><ref name=\"SBIb\"/> Almost all versions of the game would later be re-released as budget titles by GBH, GBH Gold and [[U.S. Gold|Kixx]] respectively.

Its critical success would prompt the development of a sequel eight months later; ''[[Switchblade II]]'', which was created by a new team at Gremlin Graphics without the involvement of Phipps and garnered a positive reception from the public as with the original title upon its release on Amiga, however it was not widely ported to the other platforms.<ref name=\"SBIf\">{{cite magazine|last=Slingsby|first=Dan|url=https://archive.org/details/cuamiga-magazine-014/page/n61|title=Screenscene - Switchblade II|magazine=[[Commodore User#CU Amiga|CU Amiga]]|issue=14|publisher=[[EMAP]]|date=April 1991|pages=63\u201364}}</ref><ref name=\"SBIg\">{{cite web|last=Driscoll|first=Paul|url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games90/switchblade-2/|title=Switchblade 2|publisher=[[Retro Gamer]]|date=8 August 2009|access-date=1 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910180340/http://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games90/switchblade-2/|archive-date=10 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ST Switchblade.gif|thumb|left|Atari ST version screenshot.]]\n''Switchblade'' is a side-scrolling action-platform game with run and gun elements where players assume the role of Hiro on his quest through a subterranean labyrinth in Undercity, fighting against enemies and avoiding hazards in order to reunite 16 scattered fragments of the sacred Fireblade [[sword]] and use it against Havok, an evil entity who broke free from his imprisonment.<ref name=\"SBIa\"/><ref name=\"SBImanual\">''Switchblade'' manual (Amstrad GX4000, EU)</ref>\n\nThe player guides Hiro in a [[flip-screen]] environment, where unexplored areas of the screen are obscured from view until the player character enters them. Depending on the level of charge, Hiro can use melee attacks against enemies and he can also use weapons that are found in either crates, hidden on certain rooms or suddenly appearing in the area, which are equipped into his cybernetic arm.<ref name=\"SBIa\"/><ref name=\"SBImanual\"/>\n\nThe player also fights [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]]es that are blocking the current path in order to progress further. Players can also collect letters spelling bonus and extra, which grants points and an extra life respectively. All of the actions in the game are performed different depending on the version, with one button and a joystick in the home computer versions, while the [[d-pad]] and two buttons are used in the GX4000 version. Losing a life gives Hiro a brief period of invincibility but once all lives are lost in the playthrough, the [[Game over|game is over]], forcing players to restart from the beginning.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n''Switchblade'' takes place in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] future where the Undercity in the Cyberworld of Traxx has been submerged into chaos and slaughtering with the awakening of Havok from his 10,000 year slumber, an evil entity who broke free from his imprisonment once the sacred Fireblade and its power vanished after being shattered into pieces, along with the death of the Blade Knights order. Hiro, the last of the deceased knight order, embarks on a quest to restore the Fireblade and defeat Havok to end his evil regime.<ref name=\"SBImanual\"/>\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:Atari 1040STf.jpg|thumb|right|''Switchblade'' was Simon Phipps' first written title for the Atari ST, inspired by Japanese and Western pop culture.]]\n''Switchblade'' was solely created by Core Design co-founder Simon Phipps in his spare time and became the first title he wrote for the Atari ST, however due to the nature of its development process, it took approximately eighteen months in reaching completion while he began and finished various other projects at his company, most notably ''Rick Dangerous'', with Phipps stating he desired producing a project that felt similar to [[Arcade game|arcade]] and home console titles during this era due to his fascination with Japanese artwork.<ref name=\"SBIb\"/><ref name=\"TOSTsbI\"/><ref name=\"ZAmigaSTsbI\"/>\n\nSeveral pieces of media from both Japanese and Western pop culture served as sources of inspiration for the project such as ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[Cities of the Red Night]]'', ''[[Mad Max]]'' and ''[[The Wild Boys (song)#Music video|The Wild Boys]]'' [[music video]], as well as video games like ''[[Bubble Bobble]]'', ''[[Ranarama]]'' and ''[[Underwurlde]]'', which would influence various gameplay mechanics in the final product, in addition to disadvantages with the ST hardware that also affected its design structure.<ref name=\"SBIb\"/><ref name=\"TOSTsbI\"/> Phipps stated that he enjoyed making the game, as he did not face deadlines and pressure, citing his then-artistic and technical abilities as the project's only limitations.<ref name=\"SBIb\"/><ref name=\"ZAmigaSTsbI\"/> However, Phipps stated on his [[personal web page]] about the game's development cycle that due to his constantly improving programming experience while working on other titles at Core Design, he regressed back to previously written code for improvement, referring it as the only negative of the project.<ref name=\"SBIb\"/> The music was composed by [[Ben Daglish]].<ref name=\"SBIb\"/>\n\n== Release ==\n''Switchblade'' was first released for the Atari ST and later the Amiga in Europe in December 1989, with minimal differences between each one.<ref name=\"SBIa\"/><ref name=\"SBIb\"/> In [[1990 in video gaming|1990]], an enhanced [[Video game conversion|conversion]] of the game was published by Gremlin Graphics for the Amstrad GX4000 and made use of the system's Mode 1, which allowed a 320x200 resolution display and more [[color]]s on-screen.<ref name=\"SBIe\"/> It was also ported to the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum by Gremlin as well in [[1991 in video gaming|1991]].<ref name=\"SBIa\"/><ref name=\"SBIb\"/> Almost all versions of the game would later be re-released as budget titles by GBH, GBH Gold and [[U.S. Gold|Kixx]] respectively.
