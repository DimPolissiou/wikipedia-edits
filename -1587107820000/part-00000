Failing to prevent the joining of French Admiral [[Pierre Charles Silvestre de Villeneuve|Pierre de Villeneuve's]] fleet to the squadron of [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] and to strike the shattering blow that would have freed Great Britain from the danger<ref name=\"Brytant p. 154\"/> of an invasion, Calder was later court-martialled and severely reprimanded for his failure and for avoiding the renewal of the engagement on 23 and 24 July. At the same time, in the aftermath Villeneuve elected not to continue on to [[Brest, France|Brest]], where his fleet could have joined with other French ships to clear the [[English Channel]] for an invasion of Great Britain.\n\n== Strategic background ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\n{{main|Trafalgar Campaign}}\nThe fragile [[Peace of Amiens]] of 1802 had come to an end when Napoleon formally annexed the Italian state of [[Piedmont]] and on 18 May 1803 Britain was once again at war with France.\n\n[[Napoleon]] planned to end the British blockade by invading and conquering Britain. By 1805 his ''[[Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre]]'' was 150,000 strong and encamped at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]]. If this army could cross the English Channel, victory over the poorly trained and equipped militias was very likely. The plan was that the French navy would escape from the British blockades of [[Toulon]] and Brest and threaten to attack the [[West Indies]], thus drawing off the British defence of the [[Western Approaches]]. The combined fleets would rendezvous at [[Martinique]] and then double back to Europe, land troops in Ireland to raise a rebellion, defeat the weakened British patrols in the Channel, and help transport the Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre across the [[Straits of Dover]].\n\nVilleneuve sailed from Toulon on 29 March 1805 with eleven [[ships of the line]], six [[frigate]]s and two [[brig]]s. He evaded Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]]'s blockading fleet and passed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] on 8 April. At [[C\u00e1diz]] he drove off the British blockading squadron and was joined by six Spanish ships of the line. The combined fleet sailed for the West Indies, reaching Martinique on 12 May.\n\nNelson was kept in the Mediterranean by westerly winds and did not pass the Strait until 7 May 1805. The British fleet of ten ships reached [[Antigua]] on 4 June.\n\nVilleneuve waited at Martinique for Admiral [[Honor\u00e9 Joseph Antoine Ganteaume|Ganteaume]]'s Brest fleet to join him, but it remained blockaded in port and did not appear. Pleas from French army officers for Villeneuve to attack British colonies went unheeded &mdash; except for the recapture of the island fort of [[Diamond Rock]] &mdash; until 4 June when he set out from Martinique. On 7 June he learned from a captured British merchantman that Nelson had arrived at Antigua, and on 11 June Villeneuve left for Europe, having failed to achieve any of his objectives in the Caribbean.\n\nWhile in the [[Antilles]], the Franco-Spanish fleet ran into a British convoy worth 5 million [[franc]]s escorted by the frigate ''Barbadoes'', 28 guns, and [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] ''Netley''. Villeneuve hoisted general chase and two French frigates with the Spanish ship ''Argonauta'', 80 guns, captured all the ships but one escort.\n\nOn 30 June the combined squadron captured and burned an English 14-gun [[privateer]]. On 3 July the fleet recaptured Spanish galleon ''Matilda'', which carried an estimated 15 million franc treasure, from English privateer ''Mars'', from Liverpool, which was towing ''Matilda'' to an English harbour. The privateer was burned and the merchant was taken in tow by the {{ship|French frigate|Sir\u00e8ne|1795|2|up=yes}}.\n\nThe fleet sailed back to Europe, and on 9 July the French ship ''Indomptable'' lost its main spar in a gale that damaged some other vessels slightly. The Atlantic crossings had been very difficult according to Spanish Admiral [[Federico Carlos Gravina y N\u00e1poli|Gravina]] who had crossed the Atlantic eleven times. So with some ships in bad condition, tired crews and scarce victuals, the combined fleet sighted land near Cape Finisterre on 22 July.\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:Battle of Cape Finisterre.jpg|thumb|The fleets line up for battle, painting by [[William Anderson (artist)|William Anderson]]]]\n[[File:Calder's Action.jpg|thumb|''Defiance'', ''Windsor Castle'', ''Prince of Wales'', ''Repulse'', ''Raisonable'', and ''Glory'', an engraving after [[Thomas Whitcombe]]]]\n[[File:Admiral Sir Robert Calder&#039;s Action off Cape Finisterre, 23 July 1805 RMG BHC0540.tiff|thumb|Calder\u2019s ship the \u2018'Prince of Wales\u2019' in the foreground, his fleet subdued in the patchy fog, by William Anderson]]\nNews of the returning French fleet reached Vice Admiral [[Robert Calder]] on 19 July. He was ordered to lift his blockade of the ports of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] and [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] and sail for Cape Finisterre to intercept Villeneuve.<ref>[http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/Navy_List_1805/Ship_Duties/Off_Port.html]</ref> The fleets sighted each other at about 11:00 on 22 July.\n\nAfter several hours of manoeuvring to the south-west, the action began at about 17:15 as the British fleet, with ''Hero'' (Captain [[Alan Gardner, 2nd Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]]) in the vanguard, bore down on the Franco-Spanish line of battle. In poor visibility, the battle became a confused melee. ''Malta'' formed the rear-most ship in the British line in the approach to the battle, but as the fleets became confused in the failing light and thick patchy fog, the commander of ''Malta'' [[Sir Edward Buller, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Buller]] found that he was surrounded by five Spanish ships.<ref name=\"Adkin56\">{{cite book |last=Adkin |title=The Trafalgar Companion |page=56}}</ref><ref name=\"Tracy66\">{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=66}}</ref> After a fierce engagement in which ''Malta'' suffered five killed and forty wounded the British ship battled it out, sending out devastating broadsides from both port and starboard. At about 20:00 Buller forced the Spanish 80-gun ''San Rafael'' to strike, and afterwards sent the ''Malta''{{'}}s boats to take possession of the Spanish 74-gun ''Firme''.<ref name=\"Tracy66\"/><ref name=\"ABO72\">{{cite book| title=The Annual Biography and Obituary|year=1825|page=72}}</ref><ref name=\"GM760\">{{cite book| title=[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]|year=1805|page=760}}</ref> Calder signalled to break-off the action at 20:25, aiming to continue the battle the next day. In the failing light and general confusion some ships continued to fire for another hour.\n\nDaybreak on 23 July found the fleets {{convert|27|km|mi}} apart. Calder was unwilling to attack a second time against superior odds, he had to protect the damaged ''Windsor Castle'' and ''Malta'' with her large captured Spanish prizes and he had to consider the possibility that the previously blockaded fleets at Rochefort and Ferrol might put to sea and effect a junction with Villeneuve's combined fleet. Accordingly, he declined to attack and headed northeast with his prizes.\n\nVilleneuve's report claims that at first he intended to attack, but in the very light breezes it took all day to come up to the British and he decided not to risk combat late in the day. On 24 July a change in the wind put the Franco-Spanish fleet to the windward of the British &mdash; the ideal position for an attack &mdash; but instead of attacking, Villeneuve turned away to the south. When he arrived at [[A Coru\u00f1a]] on 1 August he received orders from Napoleon to proceed immediately to Brest and Boulogne, but perhaps believing a false report of a superior British fleet in the Bay of Biscay, he returned to [[C\u00e1diz]], reaching that port on 21 August.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe battle was inconclusive and both admirals, Villeneuve and Calder, claimed victory.<ref>Brytant p. 153</ref> The British human losses were 39 officers and men killed and 159 wounded; the Franco-Spanish losses 476 officers and men killed and wounded, with a further 800 ill.<ref>Weighly 1991, p. 343: Villeneuve reported to Paris on the day of the battle that he had 800 of his fleet \"sick\", and that everything capable of going wrong was doing so.</ref> Calder was relieved of his command, court-martialled, and sentenced to be severely reprimanded for his failure to renew the battle on 23 and 24 July.  He never served at sea again. Villeneuve failed to push on Brest, retired to refit at Vigo, then slipped into Coru\u00f1a, and on 15 August decided to make for Cadiz.\nThe direction of Villeneuve on Cadiz ruined all hopes of Napoleon to make an invasion and landing on England, thus Napoleon, frustrated by Villeneuve's lack of \u00e9lan, was forced to abandon his plan of invading Britain. Instead, the ''Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre'', renamed the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', left Boulogne on 27 August to counter the threat from Austria and Russia. A few weeks after the battle he wrote: \"[[Federico Carlos Gravina y N\u00e1poli|Gravina]] is all genius and decision in combat. If Villeneuve had had those qualities, the battle of Finisterre would have been a complete victory.\"\n\nVilleneuve and the combined fleets remained at C\u00e1diz until they came out to their destruction at the [[battle of Trafalgar]] on 21 October.\n\n{{cquote|\"If Admiral Villeneuve, instead of entering Ferrol, had contented himself with rallying at the Spanish squadron, and had sailed for Brest to join Admiral [[Honor\u00e9 Joseph Antoine Ganteaume|Gantheaume]], my army would have landed; it would have been all over with England.\"|20|20|General [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], 8th Sept, 1815.<ref>The London literary gazette and journal of belles lettres, arts, sciences... p. 706</ref>}}\n\n==Order of battle==\n===British fleet===\n*Calder had fifteen ships of the line ({{HMS|Prince of Wales|1794|2}}, {{HMS|Glory|1788|2}}, {{HMS|Barfleur|1768|2}}, {{HMS|Windsor Castle|1790|2}}, {{HMS|Malta|1800|2}}, {{HMS|Thunderer|1783|2}}, {{HMS|Hero|1803|2}}, {{HMS|Repulse|1803|2}}, {{HMS|Defiance|1783|2}}, {{HMS|Ajax|1798|2}}, {{HMS|Warrior|1781|2}}, {{HMS|Dragon|1798|2}}, {{HMS|Triumph|1764|2}}, {{HMS|Agamemnon|1781|2}}, and {{HMS|Raisonnable|1768|2}}), two frigates ({{ship|French frigate|Egyptienne|1799|2}} and {{HMS|Sirius|1797|2}}), and two smaller vessels.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 |Ship\n! colspan=2 |Casualties\n! colspan=3 |Damage\n|-\n!<small>Dead</small>\n!<small>Wounded</small>\n!Rigging\n!Masts and spars\n!Hull and others\n|-\n|{{HMS|Hero|1803|2}} (74), Capt.

Failing to prevent the joining of French Admiral [[Pierre Charles Silvestre de Villeneuve|Pierre de Villeneuve's]] fleet to the squadron of [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] and to strike the shattering blow that would have freed Great Britain from the danger<ref name=\"Brytant p. 154\"/> of an invasion, Calder was later court-martialled and severely reprimanded for his failure and for avoiding the renewal of the engagement on 23 and 24 July. At the same time, in the aftermath Villeneuve elected not to continue on to [[Brest, France|Brest]], where his fleet could have joined with other French ships to clear the [[English Channel]] for an invasion of Great Britain.\n\n== Strategic background ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\n{{main|Trafalgar Campaign}}\nThe fragile [[Peace of Amiens]] of 1802 had come to an end when Napoleon formally annexed the Italian state of [[Piedmont]] and on 18 May 1803 Britain was once again at war with France.\n\n[[Napoleon]] planned to end the British blockade by invading and conquering Britain. By 1805 his ''[[Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre]]'' was 150,000 strong and encamped at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]]. If this army could cross the English Channel, victory over the poorly trained and equipped militias was very likely. The plan was that the French navy would escape from the British blockades of [[Toulon]] and Brest and threaten to attack the [[West Indies]], thus drawing off the British defence of the [[Western Approaches]]. The combined fleets would rendezvous at [[Martinique]] and then double back to Europe, land troops in Ireland to raise a rebellion, defeat the weakened British patrols in the Channel, and help transport the Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre across the [[Straits of Dover]].\n\nVilleneuve sailed from Toulon on 29 March 1805 with eleven [[ships of the line]], six [[frigate]]s and two [[brig]]s. He evaded Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]]'s blockading fleet and passed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] on 8 April. At [[C\u00e1diz]] he drove off the British blockading squadron and was joined by six Spanish ships of the line. The combined fleet sailed for the West Indies, reaching Martinique on 12 May.\n\nNelson was kept in the Mediterranean by westerly winds and did not pass the Strait until 7 May 1805. The British fleet of ten ships reached [[Antigua]] on 4 June.\n\nVilleneuve waited at Martinique for Admiral [[Honor\u00e9 Joseph Antoine Ganteaume|Ganteaume]]'s Brest fleet to join him, but it remained blockaded in port and did not appear. Pleas from French army officers for Villeneuve to attack British colonies went unheeded &mdash; except for the recapture of the island fort of [[Diamond Rock]] &mdash; until 4 June when he set out from Martinique. On 7 June he learned from a captured British merchantman that Nelson had arrived at Antigua, and on 11 June Villeneuve left for Europe, having failed to achieve any of his objectives in the Caribbean.\n\nWhile in the [[Antilles]], the Franco-Spanish fleet ran into a British convoy worth 5 million [[franc]]s escorted by the frigate ''Barbadoes'', 28 guns, and [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] ''Netley''. Villeneuve hoisted general chase and two French frigates with the Spanish ship ''Argonauta'', 80 guns, captured all the ships but one escort.\n\nOn 30 June the combined squadron captured and burned an English 14-gun [[privateer]]. On 3 July the fleet recaptured Spanish galleon ''Matilda'', which carried an estimated 15 million franc treasure, from English privateer ''Mars'', from Liverpool, which was towing ''Matilda'' to an English harbour. The privateer was burned and the merchant was taken in tow by the {{ship|French frigate|Sir\u00e8ne|1795|2|up=yes}}.\n\nThe fleet sailed back to Europe, and on 9 July the French ship ''Indomptable'' lost its main spar in a gale that damaged some other vessels slightly. The Atlantic crossings had been very difficult according to Spanish Admiral [[Federico Carlos Gravina y N\u00e1poli|Gravina]] who had crossed the Atlantic eleven times. So with some ships in bad condition, tired crews and scarce victuals, the combined fleet sighted land near Cape Finisterre on 22 July.\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:Battle of Cape Finisterre.jpg|thumb|The fleets line up for battle, painting by [[William Anderson (artist)|William Anderson]]]]\n[[File:Calder's Action.jpg|thumb|''Defiance'', ''Windsor Castle'', ''Prince of Wales'', ''Repulse'', ''Raisonable'', and ''Glory'', an engraving after [[Thomas Whitcombe]]]]\n[[File:Admiral Sir Robert Calder&#039;s Action off Cape Finisterre, 23 July 1805 RMG BHC0540.tiff|thumb|Calder\u2019s ship the \u2018'Prince of Wales\u2019' in the foreground, his fleet subdued in the patchy fog, by William Anderson]]\nNews of the returning French fleet reached Vice Admiral [[Robert Calder]] on 19 July. He was ordered to lift his blockade of the ports of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] and [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] and sail for Cape Finisterre to intercept Villeneuve.<ref>[http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/Navy_List_1805/Ship_Duties/Off_Port.html]</ref> The fleets sighted each other at about 11:00 on 22 July.\n\nAfter several hours of manoeuvring to the south-west, the action began at about 17:15 as the British fleet, with ''Hero'' (Captain [[Alan Gardner, 2nd Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]]) in the vanguard, bore down on the Franco-Spanish line of battle. In poor visibility, the battle became a confused melee. ''Malta'' formed the rear-most ship in the British line in the approach to the battle, but as the fleets became confused in the failing light and thick patchy fog, the commander of ''Malta'' [[Sir Edward Buller, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Buller]] found that he was surrounded by five Spanish ships.<ref name=\"Adkin56\">{{cite book |last=Adkin |title=The Trafalgar Companion |page=56}}</ref><ref name=\"Tracy66\">{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=66}}</ref> After a fierce engagement in which ''Malta'' suffered five killed and forty wounded the British ship battled it out, sending out devastating broadsides from both port and starboard. At about 20:00 Buller forced the Spanish 80-gun ''San Rafael'' to strike, and afterwards sent the ''Malta''{{'}}s boats to take possession of the Spanish 74-gun ''Firme''.<ref name=\"Tracy66\"/><ref name=\"ABO72\">{{cite book| title=The Annual Biography and Obituary|year=1825|page=72}}</ref><ref name=\"GM760\">{{cite book| title=[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]|year=1805|page=760}}</ref> Calder signalled to break-off the action at 20:25, aiming to continue the battle the next day. In the failing light and general confusion some ships continued to fire for another hour.\n\nDaybreak on 23 July found the fleets {{convert|27|km|mi}} apart. Calder was unwilling to attack a second time against superior odds, he had to protect the damaged ''Windsor Castle'' and ''Malta'' with her large captured Spanish prizes and he had to consider the possibility that the previously blockaded fleets at Rochefort and Ferrol might put to sea and effect a junction with Villeneuve's combined fleet. Accordingly, he declined to attack and headed northeast with his prizes.\n\nVilleneuve's report claims that at first he intended to attack, but in the very light breezes it took all day to come up to the British and he decided not to risk combat late in the day. On 24 July a change in the wind put the Franco-Spanish fleet to the windward of the British &mdash; the ideal position for an attack &mdash; but instead of attacking, Villeneuve turned away to the south. When he arrived at [[A Coru\u00f1a]] on 1 August he received orders from Napoleon to proceed immediately to Brest and Boulogne, but perhaps believing a false report of a superior British fleet in the Bay of Biscay, he returned to [[C\u00e1diz]], reaching that port on 21 August.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe battle was inconclusive and both admirals, Villeneuve and Calder, claimed victory.<ref>Brytant p. 153</ref> The British human losses were 39 officers and men killed and 159 wounded; the Franco-Spanish losses 476 officers and men killed and wounded, with a further 800 ill.<ref>Weighly 1991, p. 343: Villeneuve reported to Paris on the day of the battle that he had 800 of his fleet \"sick\", and that everything capable of going wrong was doing so.</ref> Calder was relieved of his command, court-martialled, and sentenced to be severely reprimanded for his failure to renew the battle on 23 and 24 July.  He never served at sea again. Villeneuve failed to push on Brest, retired to refit at Vigo, then slipped into Coru\u00f1a, and on 15 August decided to make for Cadiz.\nThe direction of Villeneuve on Cadiz ruined all hopes of Napoleon to make an invasion and landing on England, thus Napoleon, frustrated by Villeneuve's lack of \u00e9lan, was forced to abandon his plan of invading Britain. Instead, the ''Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre'', renamed the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', left Boulogne on 27 August to counter the threat from Austria and Russia. A few weeks after the battle he wrote: \"[[Federico Carlos Gravina y N\u00e1poli|Gravina]] is all genius and decision in combat. If Villeneuve had had those qualities, the battle of Finisterre would have been a complete victory.\"\n\nVilleneuve and the combined fleets remained at C\u00e1diz until they came out to their destruction at the [[battle of Trafalgar]] on 21 October.\n\n{{cquote|\"If Admiral Villeneuve, instead of entering Ferrol, had contented himself with rallying at the Spanish squadron, and had sailed for Brest to join Admiral [[Honor\u00e9 Joseph Antoine Ganteaume|Gantheaume]], my army would have landed; it would have been all over with England.\"|20|20|General [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], 8th Sept, 1815.<ref>The London literary gazette and journal of belles lettres, arts, sciences... p. 706</ref>}}\n\n==Order of battle==\n===British fleet===\n*Calder had fifteen ships of the line ({{HMS|Prince of Wales|1794|2}}, {{HMS|Glory|1788|2}}, {{HMS|Barfleur|1768|2}}, {{HMS|Windsor Castle|1790|2}}, {{HMS|Malta|1800|2}}, {{HMS|Thunderer|1783|2}}, {{HMS|Hero|1803|2}}, {{HMS|Repulse|1803|2}}, {{HMS|Defiance|1783|2}}, {{HMS|Ajax|1798|2}}, {{HMS|Warrior|1781|2}}, {{HMS|Dragon|1798|2}}, {{HMS|Triumph|1764|2}}, {{HMS|Agamemnon|1781|2}}, and {{HMS|Raisonnable|1768|2}}), two frigates ({{ship|French frigate|Egyptienne|1799|2}} and {{HMS|Sirius|1797|2}}), and two smaller vessels.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 |Ship\n! colspan=2 |Casualties\n! colspan=3 |Damage\n|-\n!<small>Dead</small>\n!<small>Wounded</small>\n!Rigging\n!Masts and spars\n!Hull and others\n|-\n|{{HMS|Hero|1803|2}} (74), Capt.

There are many digital art [[graphics software|programs]] and devices.\n\nA drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark. The most common support for drawing is [[paper]], although other materials, such as [[Paperboard|cardboard]], [[wood]], plastic, [[leather]], [[canvas]], and [[Lumber|board]], may be used. Temporary drawings may be made on a [[blackboard]] or [[whiteboard]] or indeed almost anything. The medium has been a popular and fundamental means of public expression throughout human history. It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating visual ideas.<ref name=SBTCModule6>{{cite web|last=www.sbctc.edu (adapted)|title=Module 6: Media for 2-D Art|url=http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Module-6.pdf|publisher=Saylor.org|accessdate=2 April 2012}}</ref> The wide availability of drawing instruments makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities.\n\nIn addition to its more artistic forms, drawing is frequently used in commercial [[illustration]], [[Traditional animation|animation]], [[Architectural drawing|architecture]], [[Engineering drawing|engineering]] and [[technical drawing]]. A quick, freehand drawing, usually not intended as a finished work, is sometimes called a [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]]. An [[artist]] who practices or works in technical drawing may be called a [[drafter]], draftsman or a draughtsman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/draftsman|title=the definition of draftsman|publisher=|accessdate=1 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Galileo moon phases.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Galileo Galilei]], ''Phases of the Moon'', 1616.]]\n\nDrawing is one of the oldest forms of human expression within the visual arts.

In Western terminology, drawing is distinct from painting, even though similar [[List of artistic mediums#Drawing|media]] often are employed in both tasks. Dry media, normally associated with drawing, such as chalk, may be used in [[pastel]] paintings. Drawing may be done with a liquid medium, applied with brushes or pens. Similar supports likewise can serve both: painting generally involves the application of liquid paint onto prepared canvas or panels, but sometimes an [[underdrawing]] is drawn first on that same support.\nDrawing is often exploratory, with considerable emphasis on observation, problem-solving and composition. Drawing is also regularly used in preparation for a painting, further obfuscating their distinction. Drawings created for these purposes are called studies.[[File:Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec - Madame Palmyre with Her Dog, 1897.jpg|thumb|upright|''Madame Palmyre with Her Dog'', 1897. [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]]]There are several categories of drawing, including [[figure drawing]], [[cartooning]], [[doodling]], and [[wikt:freehand|freehand]].

Schongauer came from Alsace, and was born into a family of goldsmiths.

Accessed 20 February 2016</ref>\n\nOld Master Drawings often reflect the history of the country in which they were produced, and the fundamental characteristics of a nation at that time. In 17th-century Holland, a Protestant country, there were almost no religious artworks, and, with no King or court, most art was bought privately. Drawings of landscapes or genre scenes were often viewed not as sketches but as highly finished works of art. Italian drawings, however, show the influence of Catholicism and the Church, which played a major role in artistic patronage. The same is often true of French drawings, although in the 17th century the disciplines of French Classicism meant drawings were less Baroque than the more free Italian counterparts, which conveyed a greater sense of movement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.christies.com/features/Old-Master-Drawings-Collecting-Guide-7455-1.aspx|title=Old Master drawings {{!}} Christie's|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-04-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century [[Modernism]] encouraged \"imaginative originality\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Drawing \u2013 The Process|last1=Duff|first1=L|author2=Davies, J|publisher=Intellect Books|year=2005|location=Bristol}}</ref> and some artists' approach to drawing became less literal, more abstract.

Most drawing media are either dry (e.g. [[graphite]], [[charcoal]], [[pastels]], [[Cont\u00e9]], [[silverpoint]]), or use a fluid solvent or carrier ([[Marker pen|marker]], [[pen and ink]]). Watercolor pencils can be used dry like ordinary pencils, then moistened with a wet brush to get various painterly effects. Very rarely, artists have drawn with (usually decoded) [[invisible ink]]. Metalpoint drawing usually employs either of two metals: silver or lead.<ref>lara Broecke, ''Cennino Cennini's ''Il Libro dell'Arte'': a new English Translation and Commentary with Italian Transcription'', Archetype 2015</ref> More rarely used are gold, platinum, copper, brass, bronze, and tinpoint.\n\nPaper comes in a variety of different sizes and qualities, ranging from newspaper grade up to high quality and relatively expensive paper sold as individual sheets.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mayer |first=Ralph |title=The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques |publisher=Viking |isbn=978-0-670-83701-4 |year=1991 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/artistshandbooko00maye_0 }}</ref> Papers vary in texture, hue, acidity, and strength when wet. Smooth paper is good for rendering fine detail, but a more \"toothy\" paper holds the drawing material better. Thus a coarser material is useful for producing deeper contrast.\n\nNewsprint and typing paper may be useful for practice and rough [[sketch (drawing)|sketches]]. [[Tracing paper]] is used to experiment over a half-finished drawing, and to transfer a design from one sheet to another. [[Cartridge paper]] is the basic type of drawing paper sold in pads. [[Bristol board]] and even heavier acid-free boards, frequently with smooth finishes, are used for drawing fine detail and do not distort when wet media (ink, washes) are applied. Vellum is extremely smooth and suitable for very fine detail. Coldpressed watercolor paper may be favored for ink drawing due to its texture.\n\nAcid-free, archival quality paper keeps its color and texture far longer than [[wood pulp]] based paper such as [[newsprint]], which turns yellow and becomes brittle much sooner.\n\nThe basic tools are a [[drawing board]] or table, [[pencil sharpener]] and [[eraser]], and for ink drawing, [[blotting paper]]. Other tools used are [[circle compass]], [[ruler]], and [[set square]]. [[Fixative (drawing)|Fixative]] is used to prevent pencil and crayon marks from smudging. [[Drafting tape]] is used to secure paper to drawing surface, and also to mask an area to keep it free of accidental marks, such as sprayed or spattered materials and washes. An easel or slanted table is used to keep the drawing surface in a suitable position, which is generally more horizontal than the position used in painting.\n\n==Technique==\n[[File:Rapha\u00ebl - \u00c9tude Madone d'Albe 1.jpg|thumb|[[Raphael]], study for what became the ''[[Alba Madonna]]'', with other sketches]]\n[[File:Watteau jeune fille.jpg|thumb|left|[[Antoine Watteau]], ''[[trois crayons]]'' technique]]\nAlmost all draftsmen use their hands and fingers to apply the media, with the exception of some handicapped individuals who draw with their mouth or feet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/03/the-amazing-art-of-disabled-artists/|title=The Amazing Art of Disabled Artists |publisher= Webdesigner Depot|date=16 March 2010|accessdate=1 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nPrior to working on an image, the artist typically explores how various media work. They may try different drawing implements on practice sheets to determine value and texture, and how to apply the implement to produce various effects.\n\nThe artist's choice of drawing strokes affects the appearance of the image. Pen and ink drawings often use [[hatching]] \u2013 groups of parallel lines.<ref>This is unrelated to the [[hatching system]] in heraldry that indicates [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] (i.e., the color of arms depicted in monochrome.)</ref> Cross-hatching uses hatching in two or more different directions to create a darker tone. Broken hatching, or lines with intermittent breaks, form lighter tones \u2013  and controlling the density of the breaks achieves a gradation of tone. [[stipple|Stippling]] uses dots to produce tone, [[Texture (visual arts)|texture]] and [[shading|shade]]. Different textures can be achieved depending on the method used to build tone.<ref>{{cite book|last=Guptill|first=Arthur L.|title=Drawing with Pen and Ink|year=1930|publisher=Reinhold Publishing Corporation|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nDrawings in dry media often use similar techniques, though pencils and drawing sticks can achieve continuous variations in tone. Typically a drawing is filled in based on which hand the artist favors. A right-handed artist draws from left to right to avoid smearing the image. [[Erasers]] can remove unwanted lines, lighten tones, and clean up stray marks. In a sketch or outline drawing, lines drawn often follow the contour of the subject, creating depth by looking like shadows cast from a light in the artist's position.\n\nSometimes the artist leaves a section of the image untouched while filling in the remainder. The shape of the area to preserve can be painted with [[Masking (in art)|masking fluid]] or cut out of a [[frisket]] and applied to the drawing surface, protecting the surface from stray marks until the mask is removed.\n\nAnother method to preserve a section of the image is to apply a spray-on ''fixative'' to the surface. This holds loose material more firmly to the sheet and prevents it from smearing. However the fixative spray typically uses chemicals that can harm the respiratory system, so it should be employed in a well-ventilated area such as outdoors.\n\nAnother technique is [[subtractive drawing]] in which the drawing surface is covered with graphite or charcoal and then erased to make the image.<ref>South, Helen, ''The Everything Drawing Book'', Adams Media, Avon, MA, 2004, pp. 152\u201353, {{ISBN|1-59337-213-2}}</ref>\n\n==Tone==\n[[File:Edward Law. Pencil drawing by H. M. Raeburn, 1909. Wellcome V0003431.jpg|thumb|A pencil drawing with hatching and shading]]\nShading is the technique of varying the tonal values on the paper to represent the shade of the material as well as the placement of the shadows. Careful attention to reflected light, shadows and highlights can result in a very realistic rendition of the image.\n\nBlending uses an implement to soften or spread the original drawing strokes. Blending is most easily done with a medium that does not immediately [[Fixative (drawing)|fix]] itself, such as graphite, chalk, or charcoal, although freshly applied ink can be smudged, wet or dry, for some effects. For shading and blending, the artist can use a [[Tortillon|blending stump]], [[Facial tissue|tissue]], a [[kneaded eraser]], a fingertip, or any combination of them. A piece of [[Chamois leather|chamois]] is useful for creating smooth textures, and for removing material to lighten the tone. Continuous tone can be achieved with graphite on a smooth surface without blending, but the technique is laborious, involving small circular or oval strokes with a somewhat blunt point.\n\nShading techniques that also introduce texture to the drawing include [[hatching]] and [[stippling]]. A number of other methods produce texture. In addition to the choice of paper, drawing material and technique affect texture. Texture can be made to appear more realistic when it is drawn next to a contrasting texture; a coarse texture is more obvious when placed next to a smoothly blended area. A similar effect can be achieved by drawing different tones close together. A light edge next to a dark background stands out to the eye, and almost appears to float above the surface.\n\n==Form and proportion==\n[[File:Human body proportions2.svg|thumb|left|Proportions of the human body]]\nMeasuring the dimensions of a subject while blocking in the drawing is an important step in producing a realistic rendition of the subject. Tools such as a [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] can be used to measure the angles of different sides. These angles can be reproduced on the drawing surface and then rechecked to make sure they are accurate. Another form of measurement is to compare the relative sizes of different parts of the subject with each other. A finger placed at a point along the drawing implement can be used to compare that dimension with other parts of the image. A [[ruler]] can be used both as a [[straightedge]] and a device to compute proportions.\n\n[[File:Male anatomical figure, showing proportions - child to man. Wellcome M0000430.jpg|thumb|upright=.4|Variation of proportion with age]]\n\nWhen attempting to draw a complicated shape such as a human figure, it is helpful at first to represent the form with a set of primitive volumes. Almost any form can be represented by some combination of the cube, sphere, cylinder, and cone. Once these basic volumes have been assembled into a likeness, then the drawing can be refined into a more accurate and polished form. The lines of the primitive volumes are removed and replaced by the final likeness. Drawing the underlying construction is a fundamental skill for representational art, and is taught in many books and schools. Its correct application resolves most uncertainties about smaller details, and makes the final image look consistent.<ref name=drawinghale>{{cite book|last=Hale|first=Robert Beverly|title=Drawing Lessons from the Great Masters|url=https://archive.org/details/drawinglessonsfr0000hale|url-access=registration|year=1964|publication-date=2009|edition=45th Anniversary|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|isbn=978-0-8230-1401-9}}</ref>\n\nA more refined art of [[figure drawing]] relies upon the artist possessing a deep understanding of anatomy and the human proportions. A trained artist is familiar with the skeleton structure, joint location, muscle placement, tendon movement, and how the different parts work together during movement. This allows the artist to render more natural poses that do not appear artificially stiff. The artist is also familiar with how the proportions vary depending on the age of the subject, particularly when drawing a portrait.\n\n[[File:2-punktperspektive.svg|thumb|left|Two-point [[perspective drawing]]]]\n\n==Perspective==\n{{Main|Perspective (graphical)|l1=Perspective}}[[File:Joeri Van Royen.jpg|Joeri Van Royen|right|thumb|upright|An artist [[figure_drawing|drawing a figure]] from [[worm's-eye view|worm's-eye perspective]]]]\n\nLinear perspective is a method of portraying objects on a flat surface so that the dimensions shrink with distance. Each set of parallel, straight edges of any object, whether a building or a table, follows lines that eventually converge at a vanishing point. Typically this convergence point is somewhere along the horizon, as buildings are built level with the flat surface. When multiple structures are aligned with each other, such as buildings along a street, the horizontal tops and bottoms of the structures typically converge at a vanishing point.\n\nWhen both the fronts and sides of a building are drawn, then the parallel lines forming a side converge at a second point along the horizon (which may be off the drawing paper.) This is a two-point perspective.<ref>{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Ernest W.|title=Course in Pencil Sketching: Four Books in One|year=1978|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-442-29229-4|pages=167\u201375}}</ref> Converging the vertical lines to a third point above or below the horizon then produces a three-point perspective.\n\nDepth can also be portrayed by several techniques in addition to the perspective approach above. Objects of similar '''size''' should appear ever smaller the further they are from the viewer. Thus the back wheel of a cart appears slightly smaller than the front wheel. Depth can be portrayed through the use of '''texture'''. As the texture of an object gets further away it becomes more compressed and busy, taking on an entirely different character than if it was close. Depth can also be portrayed by reducing the contrast in more distant objects, and by making their colors less saturated. This reproduces the effect of '''atmospheric''' haze, and cause the eye to focus primarily on objects drawn in the foreground.\n\n[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Study of a Seated Veiled Female Figure (19th Century).png|left|thumb|upright|[[Chiaroscuro]] [[Study (drawing)|study drawing]] by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]]]\n\n==Artistry==\n\nThe [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of the image is an important element in producing an interesting work of [[artistic merit]]. The artist plans element placement in the art to communicate ideas and feelings with the viewer. The composition can determine the focus of the art, and result in a harmonious whole that is aesthetically appealing and stimulating.\n\nThe [[illumination (image)|illumination]] of the subject is also a key element in creating an artistic piece, and the interplay of [[Chiaroscuro|light and shadow]] is a valuable method in the artist's toolbox. The [[Three-point lighting|placement of the light sources]] can make a considerable difference in the type of message that is being presented. Multiple light sources can wash out any wrinkles in a person's face, for instance, and give a more youthful appearance. In contrast, a single light source, such as harsh daylight, can serve to highlight any texture or interesting features.\n\nWhen drawing an object or figure, the skilled artist pays attention to both the area within the silhouette and what lies outside. The exterior is termed the [[negative space]], and can be as important in the representation as the figure. Objects placed in the background of the figure should appear properly placed wherever they can be viewed.\n\nA [[Study (drawing)|study]] is a draft drawing that is made in preparation for a planned final image. Studies can be used to determine the appearances of specific parts of the completed image, or for experimenting with the best approach for accomplishing the end goal. However a well-crafted study can be a piece of art in its own right, and many hours of careful work can go into completing a study.\n\n==Process==\n[[File:Munich - Two young women drawing - 5814.jpg|thumb|350px|A person drawing the [[Barberini Faun]] in [[Munich]]]]Individuals display differences in their ability to produce visually accurate drawings.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ostrofsky|first=J|title=A Multi-Stage Attention Hypothesis of Drawing Ability|url=http://ttd2011.pressible.org/files/2012/05/Thinking-through-Drawing_Practice-into-Knowledge.pdf|year=2011|access-date=2014-03-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317224618/http://ttd2011.pressible.org/files/2012/05/Thinking-through-Drawing_Practice-into-Knowledge.pdf|archive-date=2014-03-17|url-status=dead}}</ref> A visually accurate drawing is described as being \"recognized as a particular object at a particular time and in a particular space, rendered with little addition of visual detail that can not be seen in the object represented or with little deletion of visual detail\u201d.<ref name=\"Cohen 1997 609\u2013621\">{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=D.

Instruments include [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[pen and ink]], various kinds of [[paint]]s, [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, [[colored pencil]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal (art)|charcoal]], [[sidewalk chalk|chalk]], [[pastel]]s, various kinds of [[erasers]], [[Marker pen|markers]], [[stylus]]es, and various metals (such as [[silverpoint]]). Digital drawing is the act of using a [[computer]] to draw. Common methods of digital drawing include a stylus or finger on a [[touchscreen]] device, [[stylus]]- or finger-to-[[touchpad]], or in some cases, a [[Computer mouse|mouse]]. There are many digital art [[graphics software|programs]] and devices.\n\nA drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark. The most common support for drawing is [[paper]], although other materials, such as [[Paperboard|cardboard]], [[wood]], plastic, [[leather]], [[canvas]], and [[Lumber|board]], may be used. Temporary drawings may be made on a [[blackboard]] or [[whiteboard]] or indeed almost anything. The medium has been a popular and fundamental means of public expression throughout human history. It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating visual ideas.<ref name=SBTCModule6>{{cite web|last=www.sbctc.edu (adapted)|title=Module 6: Media for 2-D Art|url=http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Module-6.pdf|publisher=Saylor.org|accessdate=2 April 2012}}</ref> The wide availability of drawing instruments makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities.\n\nIn addition to its more artistic forms, drawing is frequently used in commercial [[illustration]], [[Traditional animation|animation]], [[Architectural drawing|architecture]], [[Engineering drawing|engineering]] and [[technical drawing]].

In Western terminology, drawing is distinct from painting, even though similar [[List of artistic mediums#Drawing|media]] often are employed in both tasks. Dry media, normally associated with drawing, such as chalk, may be used in [[pastel]] paintings. Drawing may be done with a liquid medium, applied with brushes or pens. Similar supports likewise can serve both: painting generally involves the application of liquid paint onto prepared canvas or panels, but sometimes an [[underdrawing]] is drawn first on that same support.\nDrawing is often exploratory, with considerable emphasis on observation, problem-solving and composition. Drawing is also regularly used in preparation for a painting, further obfuscating their distinction. Drawings created for these purposes are called studies.[[File:Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec - Madame Palmyre with Her Dog, 1897.jpg|thumb|upright|''Madame Palmyre with Her Dog'', 1897.

Schongauer came from Alsace, and was born into a family of goldsmiths. Albrecht D\u00fcrer, a master of the next generation, was also the son of a goldsmith.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.christies.com/features/Old-Master-Prints-Collecting-Guide-8021-1.aspx|title=Old Master prints and engravings {{!}} Christie's|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-04-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|language=en}}</ref><ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/7%20German%20Draughtsmanship%20in%20the%20Ages%20of%20Durer%20and%20Goethe.pdf Hinrich Sieveking, \"German Draughtsmanship in the Ages of D\u00fcrer and Goethe\", British Museum]. Accessed 20 February 2016</ref>\n\nOld Master Drawings often reflect the history of the country in which they were produced, and the fundamental characteristics of a nation at that time. In 17th-century Holland, a Protestant country, there were almost no religious artworks, and, with no King or court, most art was bought privately. Drawings of landscapes or genre scenes were often viewed not as sketches but as highly finished works of art. Italian drawings, however, show the influence of Catholicism and the Church, which played a major role in artistic patronage. The same is often true of French drawings, although in the 17th century the disciplines of French Classicism meant drawings were less Baroque than the more free Italian counterparts, which conveyed a greater sense of movement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.christies.com/features/Old-Master-Drawings-Collecting-Guide-7455-1.aspx|title=Old Master drawings {{!}} Christie's|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-04-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century [[Modernism]] encouraged \"imaginative originality\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Drawing \u2013 The Process|last1=Duff|first1=L|author2=Davies, J|publisher=Intellect Books|year=2005|location=Bristol}}</ref> and some artists' approach to drawing became less literal, more abstract.

Most drawing media are either dry (e.g. [[graphite]], [[charcoal]], [[pastels]], [[Cont\u00e9]], [[silverpoint]]), or use a fluid solvent or carrier ([[Marker pen|marker]], [[pen and ink]]). Watercolor pencils can be used dry like ordinary pencils, then moistened with a wet brush to get various painterly effects. Very rarely, artists have drawn with (usually decoded) [[invisible ink]]. Metalpoint drawing usually employs either of two metals: silver or lead.<ref>lara Broecke, ''Cennino Cennini's ''Il Libro dell'Arte'': a new English Translation and Commentary with Italian Transcription'', Archetype 2015</ref> More rarely used are gold, platinum, copper, brass, bronze, and tinpoint.\n\nPaper comes in a variety of different sizes and qualities, ranging from newspaper grade up to high quality and relatively expensive paper sold as individual sheets.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mayer |first=Ralph |title=The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques |publisher=Viking |isbn=978-0-670-83701-4 |year=1991 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/artistshandbooko00maye_0 }}</ref> Papers vary in texture, hue, acidity, and strength when wet. Smooth paper is good for rendering fine detail, but a more \"toothy\" paper holds the drawing material better. Thus a coarser material is useful for producing deeper contrast.\n\nNewsprint and typing paper may be useful for practice and rough [[sketch (drawing)|sketches]]. [[Tracing paper]] is used to experiment over a half-finished drawing, and to transfer a design from one sheet to another. [[Cartridge paper]] is the basic type of drawing paper sold in pads. [[Bristol board]] and even heavier acid-free boards, frequently with smooth finishes, are used for drawing fine detail and do not distort when wet media (ink, washes) are applied. Vellum is extremely smooth and suitable for very fine detail. Coldpressed watercolor paper may be favored for ink drawing due to its texture.\n\nAcid-free, archival quality paper keeps its color and texture far longer than [[wood pulp]] based paper such as [[newsprint]], which turns yellow and becomes brittle much sooner.\n\nThe basic tools are a [[drawing board]] or table, [[pencil sharpener]] and [[eraser]], and for ink drawing, [[blotting paper]]. Other tools used are [[circle compass]], [[ruler]], and [[set square]]. [[Fixative (drawing)|Fixative]] is used to prevent pencil and crayon marks from smudging. [[Drafting tape]] is used to secure paper to drawing surface, and also to mask an area to keep it free of accidental marks, such as sprayed or spattered materials and washes. An easel or slanted table is used to keep the drawing surface in a suitable position, which is generally more horizontal than the position used in painting.\n\n==Technique==\n[[File:Rapha\u00ebl - \u00c9tude Madone d'Albe 1.jpg|thumb|[[Raphael]], study for what became the ''[[Alba Madonna]]'', with other sketches]]\n[[File:Watteau jeune fille.jpg|thumb|left|[[Antoine Watteau]], ''[[trois crayons]]'' technique]]\nAlmost all draftsmen use their hands and fingers to apply the media, with the exception of some handicapped individuals who draw with their mouth or feet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/03/the-amazing-art-of-disabled-artists/|title=The Amazing Art of Disabled Artists |publisher= Webdesigner Depot|date=16 March 2010|accessdate=1 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nPrior to working on an image, the artist typically explores how various media work. They may try different drawing implements on practice sheets to determine value and texture, and how to apply the implement to produce various effects.\n\nThe artist's choice of drawing strokes affects the appearance of the image. Pen and ink drawings often use [[hatching]] \u2013 groups of parallel lines.<ref>This is unrelated to the [[hatching system]] in heraldry that indicates [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] (i.e., the color of arms depicted in monochrome.)</ref> Cross-hatching uses hatching in two or more different directions to create a darker tone. Broken hatching, or lines with intermittent breaks, form lighter tones \u2013  and controlling the density of the breaks achieves a gradation of tone. [[stipple|Stippling]] uses dots to produce tone, [[Texture (visual arts)|texture]] and [[shading|shade]]. Different textures can be achieved depending on the method used to build tone.<ref>{{cite book|last=Guptill|first=Arthur L.|title=Drawing with Pen and Ink|year=1930|publisher=Reinhold Publishing Corporation|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nDrawings in dry media often use similar techniques, though pencils and drawing sticks can achieve continuous variations in tone. Typically a drawing is filled in based on which hand the artist favors. A right-handed artist draws from left to right to avoid smearing the image. [[Erasers]] can remove unwanted lines, lighten tones, and clean up stray marks. In a sketch or outline drawing, lines drawn often follow the contour of the subject, creating depth by looking like shadows cast from a light in the artist's position.\n\nSometimes the artist leaves a section of the image untouched while filling in the remainder. The shape of the area to preserve can be painted with [[Masking (in art)|masking fluid]] or cut out of a [[frisket]] and applied to the drawing surface, protecting the surface from stray marks until the mask is removed.\n\nAnother method to preserve a section of the image is to apply a spray-on ''fixative'' to the surface. This holds loose material more firmly to the sheet and prevents it from smearing. However the fixative spray typically uses chemicals that can harm the respiratory system, so it should be employed in a well-ventilated area such as outdoors.\n\nAnother technique is [[subtractive drawing]] in which the drawing surface is covered with graphite or charcoal and then erased to make the image.<ref>South, Helen, ''The Everything Drawing Book'', Adams Media, Avon, MA, 2004, pp. 152\u201353, {{ISBN|1-59337-213-2}}</ref>\n\n==Tone==\n[[File:Edward Law. Pencil drawing by H. M. Raeburn, 1909. Wellcome V0003431.jpg|thumb|A pencil drawing with hatching and shading]]\nShading is the technique of varying the tonal values on the paper to represent the shade of the material as well as the placement of the shadows. Careful attention to reflected light, shadows and highlights can result in a very realistic rendition of the image.\n\nBlending uses an implement to soften or spread the original drawing strokes. Blending is most easily done with a medium that does not immediately [[Fixative (drawing)|fix]] itself, such as graphite, chalk, or charcoal, although freshly applied ink can be smudged, wet or dry, for some effects. For shading and blending, the artist can use a [[Tortillon|blending stump]], [[Facial tissue|tissue]], a [[kneaded eraser]], a fingertip, or any combination of them. A piece of [[Chamois leather|chamois]] is useful for creating smooth textures, and for removing material to lighten the tone. Continuous tone can be achieved with graphite on a smooth surface without blending, but the technique is laborious, involving small circular or oval strokes with a somewhat blunt point.\n\nShading techniques that also introduce texture to the drawing include [[hatching]] and [[stippling]]. A number of other methods produce texture. In addition to the choice of paper, drawing material and technique affect texture. Texture can be made to appear more realistic when it is drawn next to a contrasting texture; a coarse texture is more obvious when placed next to a smoothly blended area. A similar effect can be achieved by drawing different tones close together. A light edge next to a dark background stands out to the eye, and almost appears to float above the surface.\n\n==Form and proportion==\n[[File:Human body proportions2.svg|thumb|left|Proportions of the human body]]\nMeasuring the dimensions of a subject while blocking in the drawing is an important step in producing a realistic rendition of the subject. Tools such as a [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] can be used to measure the angles of different sides. These angles can be reproduced on the drawing surface and then rechecked to make sure they are accurate. Another form of measurement is to compare the relative sizes of different parts of the subject with each other. A finger placed at a point along the drawing implement can be used to compare that dimension with other parts of the image. A [[ruler]] can be used both as a [[straightedge]] and a device to compute proportions.\n\n[[File:Male anatomical figure, showing proportions - child to man. Wellcome M0000430.jpg|thumb|upright=.4|Variation of proportion with age]]\n\nWhen attempting to draw a complicated shape such as a human figure, it is helpful at first to represent the form with a set of primitive volumes. Almost any form can be represented by some combination of the cube, sphere, cylinder, and cone. Once these basic volumes have been assembled into a likeness, then the drawing can be refined into a more accurate and polished form. The lines of the primitive volumes are removed and replaced by the final likeness. Drawing the underlying construction is a fundamental skill for representational art, and is taught in many books and schools. Its correct application resolves most uncertainties about smaller details, and makes the final image look consistent.<ref name=drawinghale>{{cite book|last=Hale|first=Robert Beverly|title=Drawing Lessons from the Great Masters|url=https://archive.org/details/drawinglessonsfr0000hale|url-access=registration|year=1964|publication-date=2009|edition=45th Anniversary|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|isbn=978-0-8230-1401-9}}</ref>\n\nA more refined art of [[figure drawing]] relies upon the artist possessing a deep understanding of anatomy and the human proportions. A trained artist is familiar with the skeleton structure, joint location, muscle placement, tendon movement, and how the different parts work together during movement. This allows the artist to render more natural poses that do not appear artificially stiff. The artist is also familiar with how the proportions vary depending on the age of the subject, particularly when drawing a portrait.\n\n[[File:2-punktperspektive.svg|thumb|left|Two-point [[perspective drawing]]]]\n\n==Perspective==\n{{Main|Perspective (graphical)|l1=Perspective}}[[File:Joeri Van Royen.jpg|Joeri Van Royen|right|thumb|upright|An artist [[figure_drawing|drawing a figure]] from [[worm's-eye view|worm's-eye perspective]]]]\n\nLinear perspective is a method of portraying objects on a flat surface so that the dimensions shrink with distance. Each set of parallel, straight edges of any object, whether a building or a table, follows lines that eventually converge at a vanishing point. Typically this convergence point is somewhere along the horizon, as buildings are built level with the flat surface. When multiple structures are aligned with each other, such as buildings along a street, the horizontal tops and bottoms of the structures typically converge at a vanishing point.\n\nWhen both the fronts and sides of a building are drawn, then the parallel lines forming a side converge at a second point along the horizon (which may be off the drawing paper.) This is a two-point perspective.<ref>{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Ernest W.|title=Course in Pencil Sketching: Four Books in One|year=1978|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-442-29229-4|pages=167\u201375}}</ref> Converging the vertical lines to a third point above or below the horizon then produces a three-point perspective.\n\nDepth can also be portrayed by several techniques in addition to the perspective approach above. Objects of similar '''size''' should appear ever smaller the further they are from the viewer. Thus the back wheel of a cart appears slightly smaller than the front wheel. Depth can be portrayed through the use of '''texture'''. As the texture of an object gets further away it becomes more compressed and busy, taking on an entirely different character than if it was close. Depth can also be portrayed by reducing the contrast in more distant objects, and by making their colors less saturated. This reproduces the effect of '''atmospheric''' haze, and cause the eye to focus primarily on objects drawn in the foreground.\n\n[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Study of a Seated Veiled Female Figure (19th Century).png|left|thumb|upright|[[Chiaroscuro]] [[Study (drawing)|study drawing]] by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]]]\n\n==Artistry==\n\nThe [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of the image is an important element in producing an interesting work of [[artistic merit]]. The artist plans element placement in the art to communicate ideas and feelings with the viewer. The composition can determine the focus of the art, and result in a harmonious whole that is aesthetically appealing and stimulating.\n\nThe [[illumination (image)|illumination]] of the subject is also a key element in creating an artistic piece, and the interplay of [[Chiaroscuro|light and shadow]] is a valuable method in the artist's toolbox. The [[Three-point lighting|placement of the light sources]] can make a considerable difference in the type of message that is being presented. Multiple light sources can wash out any wrinkles in a person's face, for instance, and give a more youthful appearance. In contrast, a single light source, such as harsh daylight, can serve to highlight any texture or interesting features.\n\nWhen drawing an object or figure, the skilled artist pays attention to both the area within the silhouette and what lies outside. The exterior is termed the [[negative space]], and can be as important in the representation as the figure. Objects placed in the background of the figure should appear properly placed wherever they can be viewed.\n\nA [[Study (drawing)|study]] is a draft drawing that is made in preparation for a planned final image. Studies can be used to determine the appearances of specific parts of the completed image, or for experimenting with the best approach for accomplishing the end goal. However a well-crafted study can be a piece of art in its own right, and many hours of careful work can go into completing a study.\n\n==Process==\n[[File:Munich - Two young women drawing - 5814.jpg|thumb|350px|A person drawing the [[Barberini Faun]] in [[Munich]]]]Individuals display differences in their ability to produce visually accurate drawings.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ostrofsky|first=J|title=A Multi-Stage Attention Hypothesis of Drawing Ability|url=http://ttd2011.pressible.org/files/2012/05/Thinking-through-Drawing_Practice-into-Knowledge.pdf|year=2011|access-date=2014-03-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317224618/http://ttd2011.pressible.org/files/2012/05/Thinking-through-Drawing_Practice-into-Knowledge.pdf|archive-date=2014-03-17|url-status=dead}}</ref> A visually accurate drawing is described as being \"recognized as a particular object at a particular time and in a particular space, rendered with little addition of visual detail that can not be seen in the object represented or with little deletion of visual detail\u201d.<ref name=\"Cohen 1997 609\u2013621\">{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=D.
