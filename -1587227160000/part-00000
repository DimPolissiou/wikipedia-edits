The follow-up to his most commercially successful album ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' (1983), it was written and recorded in mid-1984 at [[Le Studio]] in [[Morin-Heights]], Quebec, Canada following the conclusion of the [[Serious Moonlight Tour]]. Much of the album's sound is the same as its predecessor's, due to Bowie's effort to retain the new audience that he had recently acquired. \n\nThe album was produced by Bowie, Derek Bramble and [[Hugh Padgham]]. Much of Bowie's creative process was the exact same as ''Let's Dance''. Like its predecessor, Bowie played no instruments on ''Tonight'', instead offering little creative input to the musicians during the sessions. He also recorded multiple demos of the tracks beforehand, something collaborator [[Carlos Alomar]] recalled that he rarely did previously. Three songs, including the [[Tonight (Iggy Pop song)|title track]], were covers of [[Iggy Pop]] songs, who was present during most of the sessions and co-writer on multiple tracks. The title track features singer [[Tina Turner]].\n\nSupported by the singles \"[[Loving the Alien]]\", \"[[Blue Jean]]\" and the title track, ''Tonight'' was a commercial success, reaching number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It was eventually certified [[Platinum record|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)]] and [[Gold disc|gold]] by the [[British Phonographic Industry|British Phonographic Industry (BPI)]]. However, it received mostly poor reviews from music critics, with most noting its lack of creativity. Bowie would express dissatisfaction with it in later years, calling it not one of his stronger efforts. Bowie did not tour in support of the album, and only performed \"Loving the Alien\" and \"Blue Jean\" on subsequent tours. The album was remastered in 2018 as part of the box set ''[[Loving the Alien (1983\u20131988)]]''.\n\n==Production==\nDavid Bowie worked on ''Tonight'' after completing his [[Serious Moonlight Tour]] in support of his previous album ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]''.<ref name=RSMag84 /> He did not have much luck writing while on tour, so he described the process of recording the album ''Tonight'' this way:\n{{quote|It was rushed. The ''process'' wasn't rushed; we actually took our time recording the thing; ''Let's Dance'' was done in three weeks, ''Tonight'' took five weeks or something, which for me is a really long time. I like to work fast in the studio. There wasn't much of my writing on it 'cause I can't write on tour and I hadn't assembled anything to put out. But I thought it a kind of violent effort at a kind of ''[[Pin Ups]]''.<ref name=MMReview>{{citation |last=Isler |first=Scott |title=David Bowie Opens Up - A Little |journal=Musician |issue=106 |date=August 1987 |pages=60\u201373}}</ref>}}\n\nBowie purposefully sought to keep the sound of the band he had used on the previous album and tour, feeling that the new fans he had accumulated would expect to hear the same thing on the new album that they'd heard before, hence the inclusion of the \"Borneo Horns\" players on the album.<ref name=MM74>{{citation |last=Fricke |first=David |title=David Bowie Interview |journal=[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]] |issue=74 |date=December 1984 |pages=46\u201356}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen |title=Tonight |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tonight-mw0000189205 |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=24 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nLike ''Let's Dance'', but unlike most previous Bowie albums, Bowie played no instruments on the record, and in fact he delegated almost all responsibility for the music played to his musicians, only occasionally offering critical input.<ref name=MM74 />\n\nBowie brought in Derek Bramble and [[Hugh Padgham]] to produce the record, the former receiving the nod from Bowie due to some of the demos he'd recently produced for English female singer [[Jaki Graham]]. As with ''Let's Dance'', Bowie prepared for the album by recording some demos beforehand, this time showing up with 8 of the 9 songs that would appear on the album. This surprised collaborator [[Carlos Alomar]], who said \"it was the first time in the eleven years that I've been with the damn man that he's brought in anything.\"<ref name=MM74 />\n\n[[Iggy Pop]] spent a good deal of time in the studio with Bowie and the band while the album was being recorded, stating \"I worked extensively on that album. There's a lot more work there than is reflected in just the simple co-writing credit for two songs and some of the old stuff.\" When asked why Bowie included so much Pop-written material on the album, Pop could only guess. \"I think he just wanted the songs heard more,\"<ref name=MM74 /> a sentiment Bowie would mirror when covering Pop's \"[[Bang Bang (Iggy Pop song)|Bang Bang]]\" on his next album, ''[[Never Let Me Down]]''.<ref name=AmsterdamPress>Amsterdam Glass Spider Press Conference, 30 March 1987</ref>\n\n===Track production===\nSome of the demo tracks were not yet named, but they were numbered, called simply \"1,\" \"2\" and \"3.\" \"1\" would turn into the \"irreligious\" album track \"[[Loving the Alien]]\". Bowie described \"Loving the Alien\" as a very personal bit of writing that he did not feel fit in with the rest of the album because it is such a dark song amidst lighter fare. He said, \"\"Alien\" came about because of my feeling that so much history is wrong - as is being rediscovered all the time - and that we base so much on the wrong knowledge that we've gleaned.\"<ref name=RSMag84 /> Bowie cut the demo for the song in [[Montreux]], Switzerland, with a guitarist and a drummer he had drafted from a local Swiss band.<ref name=MM74 />\n\nDemo songs \"2\" and \"3\" were not finished for the album, much to Padgham's regret. He said:\n\n{{quote|They were really just jams. David had some riffs on a tape, in his head, and the band would jam on them and we'd make a bit of a song out of it. But they were quite raunchy songs. At one point, David asked me what my least favourite song out of the eleven or twelve we had was, and I said 'Blue Jean.' I thought it was a bit lightweight. I would have rather had \"2\" in its place. I couldn't tell you why he didn't put them on the album. But I would have loved to have finished them.<ref name=MM74 />}}\n\nThree songs were covers of older Iggy Pop songs: \"Don't Look Down\", \"[[Tonight (Iggy Pop song)|Tonight]]\" and \"Neighborhood Threat\", the latter of which stands out as a track Bowie wished he had not done, with him later calling it \"disastrous\". \"That's one I wish I'd never touched, or at least touched it differently. It went totally wrong. It sounded so tight and compromised, and it was such a gas doing it. It was the wrong band to do it with -- wonderful band, but it wasn't quite right for that song.\"<ref name=MMReview />\n\n\"Tumble and Twirl\", co-written with Pop, recounts the pair's exploits while vacationing in the Indonesian islands [[Bali]] and [[Java]] after Bowie's previous tour had ended.<ref name=RSMag84 /><ref name=MM74 />\n\n\"Don't Look Down\", which was one of Bowie's returns to a [[reggae]]-style track (after ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'''s \"[[Yassassin]]\"), perplexed Bowie: \"I tried it every which way. I tried it [[jazz-rock]], I tried it as a [[March (music)|march]], and then I just hit on an old [[ska]]-sounding beat, and it picked up life. Taking energy away from the musical side reinforced the lyrics and gave them their own energy. I think working with Derek Bramble helped because he played propper reggae bass lines.\"\n\nFor \"[[Tonight (Iggy Pop song)|Tonight]]\", the title track and the other reggae-style track on the album, Bowie eliminated Pop's original spoken word introduction, calling it an \"idiosyncratic thing\" of Pop's that \"seemed not part of my vocabulary. ... I guess [removing the spoken introduction] changed the whole sentiment around. It still has that same barren feeling, but it's out of that specific area that I'm not at home in.\"<ref name=RSMag84 /> Pop approved of Bowie's changes. For the vocals to the song, Bowie and [[Tina Turner]] sang face-to-face, although Bowie went back and re-recorded the first verse after deciding to sing his part in a higher octave.<ref name=MM74 />\n\n\"Dancing with the Big Boys\", which Bowie also co-wrote with Pop, was written and recorded in eight hours as they egged each other on. In what was described as an \"exhilarating rush\", Bowie and Pop \"went in [to the studio] with a few bottles of beer and would virtually bellow out anything that came into their heads,\" said Padgham. \"And I just recorded it all.\" The song is about the \"little guy\" being crushed by \"oppressive corporate structures.\" The lyrics were taken from a backlog of unused lyrics; the line \"this dot marks your location\" was a reference to a \"lengthy irritating stay\" at a New York Hotel (Bowie had been looking at the hotel room's fire escape map), and \"Your family is a football team\" was a reference to the immigrant families working in New York; \"the whole family [has] to work together for survival.\"<ref name=MM74 /> The track elicited this from Bowie:\n{{quote|There's a particular sound I'm after that I haven't really got yet; I'll either crack it on the next album or retire from it. I think I got quite close to it on \"Dancing with the Big Boys.\" ... I got very ''musical'' over the last couple of years - trying to write musically and develop things the way people used to write in the Fifties. I stayed away from experimentation. Now, I think I should be a bit more adventurous. And in \"Big Boys,\" Iggy and I broke away from all that for one track, and it came nearer to the sound I was looking for than anything else.<ref name=RSMag84 />}}\n\n==Singles and videos==\nThree singles were released from the album: \"[[Tonight (David Bowie song)|Tonight]]\", \"[[Blue Jean (song)|Blue Jean]]\" and \"[[Loving the Alien]]\". \"Blue Jean\" in turn spawned several videos, including an \"elaborate\" 20-minute-long collaboration with [[Julien Temple]] which was described as more of a \"minifilm\" than a video, and represented Bowie's interest in making actual movies.<ref name=RSMag84 />\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r714078|pure_url=yes}}</ref>\n| rev2      = [[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]\n| rev2score = {{Rating|1|5}}<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |edition=5th concise |year=2011 |last=Larkin |first=Colin |authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer) }}</ref>\n| rev3      = [[MusicHound]]\n| rev3Score = 1/5<ref>{{cite book|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|last2=Durchholz|first2=Daniel (eds)|title=MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide|publisher=Visible Ink Press|location=Farmington Hills, MI|year=1999|isbn=1-57859-061-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590612/page/151 151]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590612/page/151}}</ref>\n| rev4      = ''[[Pitchfork (magazine)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev4Score = 4.3/10<ref>{{cite web|last=O\u2019Leary|first=Chris|title=David Bowie: Loving the Alien|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/david-bowie-loving-the-alien-1983-1988/|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=20 October 2018|accessdate=20 October 2018}}</ref>\n| rev5      = [[Robert Christgau]]\n| rev5Score = {{Rating-Christgau|C}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=david+bowie |title=CG: david bowie |publisher=Robert Christgau |accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref>\n| rev6      = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev6Score = {{Rating|1|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/david-bowie/albumguide |title=David Bowie: Album Guide |publisher=[[Rolling Stone|rollingstone.com]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530073307/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/david-bowie/albumguide |archivedate=30 May 2011 |accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref>\n}}\nDespite some positive reviews of the album,<ref name=MM74Review>\"Learning to love the Alien: Bowie haunts a calculated, kaleidoscopic seance\" by Timothy White, Musician magazine, December 1984, pages 98-99</ref> other reviewers criticised it for lacking creativity.<ref name=RSMag84 /> Padgham, who co-produced the album, also said that it was less innovative than other Bowie albums.<ref name=MM74 />\n\nAn article for ''[[Melody Maker]]'' later dismissed ''Tonight'' as \"rotten\".<ref name=MM90>\"Bowie: Boys Keep Swinging,\" Melody Maker magazine, 24 March 1990, pp 24-26</ref> [[AllMusic]] critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] called it \"one of the weakest albums Bowie ever recorded\" and wrote that \"none of the material equals the songs on ''Let's Dance''\", although he made an exception for \"Blue Jean\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' described ''Tonight'' as \"an expensive quickie padded with lame covers\".<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Nathan Brackett|editor2=Christian Hoard|title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide|year=2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/99 99]|publisher=Simon & Schuster Ltd|isbn=978-0743201698|url=https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/99}}</ref> [[Alexis Petridis]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated in a retrospective of Bowie's career in 2016: \"''Let\u2019s Dance''... had its moments ...

released on 29 September 1984 by [[EMI America Records]]. The follow-up to his most commercially successful album ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' (1983), it was written and recorded in mid-1984 at [[Le Studio]] in [[Morin-Heights]], Quebec, Canada following the conclusion of the [[Serious Moonlight Tour]]. Much of the album's sound is the same as its predecessor's, due to Bowie's effort to retain the new audience that he had recently acquired. \n\nThe album was produced by Bowie, Derek Bramble and [[Hugh Padgham]]. Much of Bowie's creative process was the exact same as ''Let's Dance''. Like its predecessor, Bowie played no instruments on ''Tonight'', instead offering little creative input to the musicians during the sessions. He also recorded multiple demos of the tracks beforehand, something collaborator [[Carlos Alomar]] recalled that he rarely did previously. Three songs, including the [[Tonight (Iggy Pop song)|title track]], were covers of [[Iggy Pop]] songs, who was present during most of the sessions and co-writer on multiple tracks. The title track features singer [[Tina Turner]].\n\nSupported by the singles \"[[Loving the Alien]]\", \"[[Blue Jean]]\" and the title track, ''Tonight'' was a commercial success, reaching number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It was eventually certified [[Platinum record|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)]] and [[Gold disc|gold]] by the [[British Phonographic Industry|British Phonographic Industry (BPI)]]. However, it received mostly poor reviews from music critics, with most noting its lack of creativity. Bowie would express dissatisfaction with it in later years, calling it not one of his stronger efforts. Bowie did not tour in support for the album, and only performed \"Loving the Alien\" and \"Blue Jean\" on subsequent tours. The album was re-mastered in 2018 and included in the box set ''[[Loving the Alien (1983\u20131988)]]''.\n\n==Production==\nDavid Bowie worked on ''Tonight'' after completing his [[Serious Moonlight Tour]] in support of his previous album ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]''.<ref name=RSMag84 /> He did not have much luck writing while on tour, so he described the process of recording the album ''Tonight'' this way:\n{{quote|It was rushed. The ''process'' wasn't rushed; we actually took our time recording the thing; ''Let's Dance'' was done in three weeks, ''Tonight'' took five weeks or something, which for me is a really long time. I like to work fast in the studio. There wasn't much of my writing on it 'cause I can't write on tour and I hadn't assembled anything to put out. But I thought it a kind of violent effort at a kind of ''[[Pin Ups]]''.<ref name=MMReview>{{citation |last=Isler |first=Scott |title=David Bowie Opens Up - A Little |journal=Musician |issue=106 |date=August 1987 |pages=60\u201373}}</ref>}}\n\nBowie purposefully sought to keep the sound of the band he had used on the previous album and tour, feeling that the new fans he had accumulated would expect to hear the same thing on the new album that they'd heard before, hence the inclusion of the \"Borneo Horns\" players on the album.<ref name=MM74>{{citation |last=Fricke |first=David |title=David Bowie Interview |journal=[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]] |issue=74 |date=December 1984 |pages=46\u201356}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen |title=Tonight |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tonight-mw0000189205 |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=24 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nLike ''Let's Dance'', but unlike most previous Bowie albums, Bowie played no instruments on the record, and in fact he delegated almost all responsibility for the music played to his musicians, only occasionally offering critical input.<ref name=MM74 />\n\nBowie brought in Derek Bramble and [[Hugh Padgham]] to produce the record, the former receiving the nod from Bowie due to some of the demos he'd recently produced for English female singer [[Jaki Graham]]. As with ''Let's Dance'', Bowie prepared for the album by recording some demos beforehand, this time showing up with 8 of the 9 songs that would appear on the album. This surprised collaborator [[Carlos Alomar]], who said \"it was the first time in the eleven years that I've been with the damn man that he's brought in anything.\"<ref name=MM74 />\n\n[[Iggy Pop]] spent a good deal of time in the studio with Bowie and the band while the album was being recorded, stating \"I worked extensively on that album. There's a lot more work there than is reflected in just the simple co-writing credit for two songs and some of the old stuff.\" When asked why Bowie included so much Pop-written material on the album, Pop could only guess. \"I think he just wanted the songs heard more,\"<ref name=MM74 /> a sentiment Bowie would mirror when covering Pop's \"[[Bang Bang (Iggy Pop song)|Bang Bang]]\" on his next album, ''[[Never Let Me Down]]''.<ref name=AmsterdamPress>Amsterdam Glass Spider Press Conference, 30 March 1987</ref>\n\n===Track production===\nSome of the demo tracks were not yet named, but they were numbered, called simply \"1,\" \"2\" and \"3.\" \"1\" would turn into the \"irreligious\" album track \"[[Loving the Alien]]\". Bowie described \"Loving the Alien\" as a very personal bit of writing that he did not feel fit in with the rest of the album because it is such a dark song amidst lighter fare. He said, \"\"Alien\" came about because of my feeling that so much history is wrong - as is being rediscovered all the time - and that we base so much on the wrong knowledge that we've gleaned.\"<ref name=RSMag84 /> Bowie cut the demo for the song in [[Montreux]], Switzerland, with a guitarist and a drummer he had drafted from a local Swiss band.<ref name=MM74 />\n\nDemo songs \"2\" and \"3\" were not finished for the album, much to Padgham's regret. He said:\n\n{{quote|They were really just jams. David had some riffs on a tape, in his head, and the band would jam on them and we'd make a bit of a song out of it. But they were quite raunchy songs. At one point, David asked me what my least favourite song out of the eleven or twelve we had was, and I said 'Blue Jean.' I thought it was a bit lightweight. I would have rather had \"2\" in its place. I couldn't tell you why he didn't put them on the album. But I would have loved to have finished them.<ref name=MM74 />}}\n\nThree songs were covers of older Iggy Pop songs: \"Don't Look Down\", \"[[Tonight (Iggy Pop song)|Tonight]]\" and \"Neighborhood Threat\", the latter of which stands out as a track Bowie wished he had not done, with him later calling it \"disastrous\". \"That's one I wish I'd never touched, or at least touched it differently. It went totally wrong. It sounded so tight and compromised, and it was such a gas doing it. It was the wrong band to do it with -- wonderful band, but it wasn't quite right for that song.\"<ref name=MMReview />\n\n\"Tumble and Twirl\", co-written with Pop, recounts the pair's exploits while vacationing in the Indonesian islands [[Bali]] and [[Java]] after Bowie's previous tour had ended.<ref name=RSMag84 /><ref name=MM74 />\n\n\"Don't Look Down\", which was one of Bowie's returns to a [[reggae]]-style track (after ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'''s \"[[Yassassin]]\"), perplexed Bowie: \"I tried it every which way. I tried it [[jazz-rock]], I tried it as a [[March (music)|march]], and then I just hit on an old [[ska]]-sounding beat, and it picked up life. Taking energy away from the musical side reinforced the lyrics and gave them their own energy. I think working with Derek Bramble helped because he played propper reggae bass lines.\"\n\nFor \"[[Tonight (Iggy Pop song)|Tonight]]\", the title track and the other reggae-style track on the album, Bowie eliminated Pop's original spoken word introduction, calling it an \"idiosyncratic thing\" of Pop's that \"seemed not part of my vocabulary. ... I guess [removing the spoken introduction] changed the whole sentiment around. It still has that same barren feeling, but it's out of that specific area that I'm not at home in.\"<ref name=RSMag84 /> Pop approved of Bowie's changes. For the vocals to the song, Bowie and [[Tina Turner]] sang face-to-face, although Bowie went back and re-recorded the first verse after deciding to sing his part in a higher octave.<ref name=MM74 />\n\n\"Dancing with the Big Boys\", which Bowie also co-wrote with Pop, was written and recorded in eight hours as they egged each other on. In what was described as an \"exhilarating rush\", Bowie and Pop \"went in [to the studio] with a few bottles of beer and would virtually bellow out anything that came into their heads,\" said Padgham. \"And I just recorded it all.\" The song is about the \"little guy\" being crushed by \"oppressive corporate structures.\" The lyrics were taken from a backlog of unused lyrics; the line \"this dot marks your location\" was a reference to a \"lengthy irritating stay\" at a New York Hotel (Bowie had been looking at the hotel room's fire escape map), and \"Your family is a football team\" was a reference to the immigrant families working in New York; \"the whole family [has] to work together for survival.\"<ref name=MM74 /> The track elicited this from Bowie:\n{{quote|There's a particular sound I'm after that I haven't really got yet; I'll either crack it on the next album or retire from it. I think I got quite close to it on \"Dancing with the Big Boys.\" ... I got very ''musical'' over the last couple of years - trying to write musically and develop things the way people used to write in the Fifties. I stayed away from experimentation. Now, I think I should be a bit more adventurous. And in \"Big Boys,\" Iggy and I broke away from all that for one track, and it came nearer to the sound I was looking for than anything else.<ref name=RSMag84 />}}\n\n==Singles and videos==\nThree singles were released from the album: \"[[Tonight (David Bowie song)|Tonight]]\", \"[[Blue Jean (song)|Blue Jean]]\" and \"[[Loving the Alien]]\". \"Blue Jean\" in turn spawned several videos, including an \"elaborate\" 20-minute-long collaboration with [[Julien Temple]] which was described as more of a \"minifilm\" than a video, and represented Bowie's interest in making actual movies.<ref name=RSMag84 />\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r714078|pure_url=yes}}</ref>\n| rev2      = [[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]\n| rev2score = {{Rating|1|5}}<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |edition=5th concise |year=2011 |last=Larkin |first=Colin |authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer) }}</ref>\n| rev3      = [[MusicHound]]\n| rev3Score = 1/5<ref>{{cite book|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|last2=Durchholz|first2=Daniel (eds)|title=MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide|publisher=Visible Ink Press|location=Farmington Hills, MI|year=1999|isbn=1-57859-061-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590612/page/151 151]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590612/page/151}}</ref>\n| rev4      = ''[[Pitchfork (magazine)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev4Score = 4.3/10<ref>{{cite web|last=O\u2019Leary|first=Chris|title=David Bowie: Loving the Alien|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/david-bowie-loving-the-alien-1983-1988/|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=20 October 2018|accessdate=20 October 2018}}</ref>\n| rev5      = [[Robert Christgau]]\n| rev5Score = {{Rating-Christgau|C}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=david+bowie |title=CG: david bowie |publisher=Robert Christgau |accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref>\n| rev6      = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev6Score = {{Rating|1|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/david-bowie/albumguide |title=David Bowie: Album Guide |publisher=[[Rolling Stone|rollingstone.com]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530073307/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/david-bowie/albumguide |archivedate=30 May 2011 |accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref>\n}}\nDespite some positive reviews of the album,<ref name=MM74Review>\"Learning to love the Alien: Bowie haunts a calculated, kaleidoscopic seance\" by Timothy White, Musician magazine, December 1984, pages 98-99</ref> other reviewers criticised it for lacking creativity.<ref name=RSMag84 /> Padgham, who co-produced the album, also said that it was less innovative than other Bowie albums.<ref name=MM74 />\n\nAn article for ''[[Melody Maker]]'' later dismissed ''Tonight'' as \"rotten\".<ref name=MM90>\"Bowie: Boys Keep Swinging,\" Melody Maker magazine, 24 March 1990, pp 24-26</ref> [[AllMusic]] critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] called it \"one of the weakest albums Bowie ever recorded\" and wrote that \"none of the material equals the songs on ''Let's Dance''\", although he made an exception for \"Blue Jean\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' described ''Tonight'' as \"an expensive quickie padded with lame covers\".<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Nathan Brackett|editor2=Christian Hoard|title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide|year=2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/99 99]|publisher=Simon & Schuster Ltd|isbn=978-0743201698|url=https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/99}}</ref> [[Alexis Petridis]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated in a retrospective of Bowie's career in 2016: \"''Let\u2019s Dance''... had its moments ...

Bowie\u2019s made some subpar records, but this isn't one of them\u2014and frankly, even its failures aren't boring, because, well, it\u2019s an '80s Bowie album, from a decade in which he was wildly inconsistent, but also never dull.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/david-bowie-tonight.htm|title=David Bowie - Tonight - On Second Thought - Stylus Magazine|website=www.stylusmagazine.com}}</ref> In 2016, [[Yo Zushi]] of the ''[[New Statesman]]'' also defended the album, writing \"no album that begins with the seven-minute masterpiece 'Loving the Alien' and contains the rocking 'Blue Jean' should have received the drubbing it got\". He also argued \"the TV-special-style cover of [[the Beach Boys]]' '[[God Only Knows]]' is as stirring, in its cold, almost [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] way, as ''[[Station to Station]]'''s '[[Wild Is the Wind (song)|Wild Is the Wind]]' \u2013 it's like watching [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] in [[Las Vegas|[Las] Vegas]] through a sheet of ice.\"<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2016/01/defence-bad-bowie-why-his-least-acclaimed-album-my-favourite | title= In defence of \"bad\" Bowie: why his least acclaimed album is my favourite | work=New Statesman | first=Yo | last=Zushi | date=18 January 2016 | accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Live performances==\nBowie did not tour for the ''Tonight'' album, though tracks from this album were performed on later tours. \"Loving the Alien\" was performed live during Bowie's 1987 [[Glass Spider Tour]] and 2003\u20132004 [[A Reality Tour]]. \"Blue Jean\" was performed live during the Glass Spider Tour, 1990 [[Sound+Vision Tour]], and A Reality Tour. Bowie also performed \"Dancing with the Big Boys\" during the 1987 Glass Spider Tour, and thought he might perform \"Don't Look Down\" during that tour as well, but that song never made it to the rehearsal stage.<ref name=MusicianMag>{{Citation | last=Isler | first=Scott | title=David Bowie Opens Up \u2013 A Little | journal=[[Musician (magazine)|Musician magazine]] |date=August 1987 | pages=60\u201373}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n===LP: EMI DB 1 (UK)===\n{{Track listing\n| headline     = Side one\n| extra_column = Originally by\n| title1       = [[Loving the Alien]]\n| writer1      = [[David Bowie]]\n| length1      = 7:11\n| title2       = Don't Look Down\n| writer2      = {{hlist|[[Iggy Pop]]|[[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]]}}\n| extra2       = Iggy Pop, from ''[[New Values]]'', 1979\n| length2      = 4:11\n| title3       = [[God Only Knows]]\n| writer3      = {{hlist|[[Brian Wilson]]|[[Tony Asher]]}}\n| extra3       = [[The Beach Boys]], from ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', 1966\n| length3      = 3:08\n| title4       = [[Tonight (Iggy Pop song)|Tonight]]\n| note4        = with [[Tina Turner]]\n| writer4      = {{hlist|Bowie|Pop}}\n| extra4       = Iggy Pop, from ''[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop album)|Lust for Life]]'', 1977\n| length4      = 3:46\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline     = Side two\n| extra_column = Originally by\n| title1       = Neighborhood Threat\n| writer1      = {{hlist|Bowie|Pop|[[Ricky Gardiner]]}}\n| extra1       = Iggy Pop, from ''Lust for Life'', 1977\n| length1      = 3:12\n| title2       = [[Blue Jean]]\n| writer2      = Bowie\n| length2      = 3:11\n| title3       = Tumble and Twirl\n| writer3      = {{hlist|Bowie|Pop}}\n| length3      = 5:00\n| title4       = [[I Keep Forgettin'|I Keep Forgettin{{'-}}]]\n| writer4      = {{hlist|[[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller|Jerry Leiber \u2022 Mike Stoller]]|Gil Garfield<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/release/3800026 Discogs - Chuck Jackson ''Any Day Now'' - 1962 vinyl_LP; Wand / Reo (654)(RLP-652) Canada]</ref><ref>[https://www.discogs.com/release/2384527-I-Keep-Forgettin-Whos-Gonna-Pick-Up-The-Pieces/images Discogs - Chuck Jackson ''I Keep Forgettin' / Who's Gonna Pick Up the Pieces'' (images) - 1962 vinyl_7\"; Wand (126) US]</ref>}}\n| extra4       = [[Chuck Jackson]], from ''Any Day Now'', 1962\n| length4      = 2:34\n| title5       = Dancing with the Big Boys\n| note5        = with Iggy Pop\n| writer5      = {{hlist|Bowie|Pop|[[Carlos Alomar]]}}\n| length5      = 3:34\n| total_length = 35:47\n}}\n\n* Sides one and two were combined as tracks 1\u20139 on CD reissues.\n\n===Reissues===\nIn 1995, [[Virgin Records]] rereleased the album on CD with three bonus tracks, all of them singles from [[soundtrack]]s Bowie contributed to in the years immediately following the album's release.
