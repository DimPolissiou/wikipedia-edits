A large number of nations came under the influence of the [[Indosphere]] becoming a part of [[Greater India]], the cultural expansion caused the [[Sanskritization]] of [[South East Asia]], the rise of [[Indianized kingdoms]], spread of [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia]] and the [[Silk road transmission of Buddhism]].

The [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]], both historical (PIO or Person of Indian-Origin) and current (NRI or Non-Resident Indian), play an ongoing key role in the region in terms of geopolitical, strategic, trade, cultural traditions, and economic aspects, with most Southeast Asian countries having sizable Indian communities alongside often much larger [[Chinese in Southeast Asia|ethnic Chinese minorities]].\n\n==The spread of Indianisation==\n{{See also|Austronesian maritime trade network|Spice trade|Maritime Silk Road}}\n[[File:Hinduism Expansion in Asia.svg|thumb|300px|Expansion of Hinduism in Southeast Asia.]]\nThere are many different theories for how Indianization spread throughout insular and mainland Southeast Asia. These differing theories each argue for a different caste of Indians as being the main propagator of Indian language and culture into Southeast Asia.\n\n===Theory of the Vaishya traders===\nThe first of these theories focuses on the caste of [[Vaishya]] traders, and their role for bringing Indian traditions into Southeast Asia through trade. Southeast Asia was rich in resources that were desired in the Indian sub-continent, the most important of which being gold.<ref name=lukas>{{cite journal|last1=Lukas|first1=Helmut|title=1 THEORIES OF INDIANIZATIONExemplified by Selected Case Studies from Indonesia (Insular Southeast Asia)|journal=International SanskritConference|date=May 21\u201323, 2001|url=https://www.academia.edu/4803585}}</ref>\nDuring the 4th century c.e. the Indian subcontinent was at a deficiency for gold due to extensive control of overland trade routes by the [[Roman Empire]], and this period is when we see the first evidence of Indian trade in Southeast Asia. Vaishya traders had turned to maritime trade to acquire gold, and they set their sails for Southeast Asia. However, the conclusion that Indianization was just spread through trade is insufficient, as Indianization permeated through all classes of Southeast Asian society, not just the merchant classes<ref>{{cite book|last1=Krom|first1=N.J.|title=Barabudur, Archeological Description|date=1927|publisher=The Hague}}</ref>{{reliable|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Theory of the Kshatriya warriors===\nAnother theory states that Indianization spread through the [[Kshatriya]] class of warriors. This hypothesis does a good job at explaining state formation in Southeast Asia, as these warriors came with the intention of conquering the local peoples and establishing their own political power in the region. However, this theory has not attracted much interest from historians as there is very little literary evidence to support it.<ref name=\"lukas\" />\n\n===Theory of the Brahmins===\nThe most widely accepted theory for the spread of Indianization into Southeast Asia is through the class of [[Brahmin]] scholars. These Brahmins used the maritime routes established by the Vaishya traders, and brought with them many of the [[Hindu]] religious and philosophical traditions to spread to the elite classes of Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"lukas\" /> Once these traditions were adopted into the elite classes, it disseminated throughout all the lower classes, thus explaining the Indianization present in all classes of Southeast Asian society. Brahmins had influence beyond just the fields of religion and philosophy however, and soon Southeast Asia had adopted many Indian influenced codes of law and architecture.\n\nA combination of all three theories can explain the Indianization of Southeast Asia, rather than just choosing one. There was an extensive maritime trade network, which allowed for traders to extract gold and spices from Southeast Asia.<ref name=smith>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Monica L.|authorlink1=Monica L.

Finally, these extensive trade networks also allowed for the influx of Brahmin scholars, who impressed many Southeast Asian elites with their knowledge of law, arts, philosophy.<ref name=\"smith\"/> Thus through the Brahmin scholars many of these Indian and Hindu practices were propagated throughout all social classes Southeast Asia.\n\n==Literature==\n\nScripts in Sanskrit discovered during the early centuries of the Common Era are the earliest known forms of writing to have extended all the way to Southeast Asia. Its gradual impact ultimately resulted in its widespread domain as a means of dialect which evident in regions, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand and additionally a few of the larger Indonesian islands. In addition, alphabets from languages spoken in Burmese, Thai, Laos and Cambodia are a variations formed off of Indian ideals that have localized the language.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nThe utilization of Sanskrit has been prevalent in all aspects of life including legal purposes.  Sanskrit terminology and vernacular appears in ancient courts to establish procedures that have been structured by Indian models such as a system composed of a code of laws.<ref name=\"smith\"/> The concept of legislation demonstrated through codes of law and organizations particularly the idea of \"God King\" was embraced by numerous rulers of Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"coedes\"/> The rulers amid this time, for example, the Lin-I Dynasty of Vietnam once embraced the Sanskrit dialect and devoted sanctuaries to the Indian divinity Shiva. Many rulers following even viewed themselves as \u201creincarnations or descendants\u201d of the Hindu gods. However once Buddhism began entering the nations, this practiced view was eventually altered.<ref name=\"coedes\"/>\n\n==Religion==\n\nThe effects of Hinduism and Buddhism applied a tremendous impact on the many civilizations inhabiting Southeast Asia which significantly provided some structure to the composition of written traditions. An essential factor for the spread and adaptation of these religions originated from trading systems of the third and fourth century.<ref name=\"smith\" /> In order to spread the message of these religions Buddhist monks and Hindu priests joined mercantile classes in the quest to share their religious and cultural values and beliefs. Along the Mekong delta, evidence of Indianized religious models can be observed in communities labeled Funan. There can be found the earliest records engraved on a rock in Vocanh.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kleinmeyer|first1=Cindy|title=Religions of Southeast Asia|url=https://www.niu.edu/cseas/_pdf/lesson-plans/k-12/origins-religion.pdf|website=niu.edu|publisher=Northern Illinois University|accessdate=June 2004}}</ref> The engravings consist of Buddhist archives and a south Indian scripts written in Sanskrit that have been dated to belong to the early half of the third century. Indian religion was profoundly absorbed by local cultures that formed their own distinctive variations of these structures in order to reflect their own ideals.\n\n===The Mandala===\nThe [[Mandala]] is a religious symbol representing the universe and is also involved in the political system of Southeast Asia. The center of the Mandala is considered to contain the power while the power then spreads outwards. This replicates the how the political system within Southeast Asia has a powerful center of administration. The Mandala, just like a political system, changes from empire to empire with its relation to the King and the empire.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n==Caste System==\nThe caste system divides Hindus into a hierarchical groups based on their work (karma) and duty (dharma).The caste system, defined by authoritative book on Hindu law wrote that the system is a basis of order and regularity of society. Once born into a group, one can not move into different levels. Lower castes are never able to climb higher within the caste system, limiting the economies progress from growing. The system divides Hindus into four categories - Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and the Shudras. Brahmins consist of those who teach and educate such as priest and teachers. Kshatriyas include those who maintain law and order. Vaishyas consist of businessmen, craftsmen  and merchants. Shudras consist of skilled and unskilled labourers and farmers.<ref>{{cite news|title=What Is India's Caste System?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35650616|publisher=BBC News|date=20 July 2017}}</ref>{{reliable|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe Brahmins from the Indian culture spread their religion to southeast Asia. By traveling to these countries they were able to inform others on their beliefs and spark the beginning of the Hindu and Buddhist cultures in Southeast Asia. These Brahmins introduced the caste system to all the countries; however, more so in Java, Bali, Madura, and Sumatra. Unlike India the caste system was not as strict.<ref name=\"coedes\" /> As a result of all these different writings, there are big speculations that the Brahmins has a big role on their religion. There are multiple similarities between the two caste systems such that both state that no one is equal within society and that everyone has their own place. It also promoted the upbringing of highly organized central states. Although they have some similarities, Southeast Asians did not use the Hindu system enitirely and adjusted what they did use to their local context. The Brahmins were still able to implement their religion, political ideas, literature, mythology, and art<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n==Historiography of South East Asia==\nThe history of [[South East Asia]] was mostly always written from  the perspective of external civilizations that influenced the region.The prevalent interpretation caused mainly because of the ontological differences, fundamentally dichotomous histories of Europe and pre colonial Asia, was apparently that the despotism, obscurantism, servile equality of Asian societies along with innovation becoming prey to tyranny had rendered history cyclical, immobile and non-linear.\n \nThe belief in the idea that South East Asia had never engendered its own civilization, and of indigenous incapacity or external benefaction  gained additional support, such was the tremendous evidence of Indian architectural and religious influence in South East Asia and we're fundamentally identified as being derivative and thus [[Indosphere|Indianization]] was perceived as occurring more so due to the Indian initiatives rather than the indigenous initiatives of South East Asia.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-01JisWpJbEC&q=Indian#v=snippet&q=Indian&f=false |title = Strange Parallels: Volume 1, Integration on the Mainland: Southeast Asia in Global Context, c.800\u20131830|isbn = 9781139437622|last1 = Lieberman|first1 = Victor|date = 2003-05-26}}</ref>\n\n===Development of caste system===\nAnother main concern for indianization was the understanding and development of caste systems. The debate was often whether or not the caste systems were seen as an elite process or just the process of picking up the Indian culture and calling it their own in each region. This had showed that the Southeast Asian countries were civilized and able to flourish their own interests. For example, Cambodia's caste system is based on people in society. However, in India, the caste system was based on which class they belonged to when they were born. Based on the evidence of the caste system in Southeast Asia, shows that they were applying Indian culture to their own, also known/seen as indianization.\n\nSimilar to the caste systems, the cultures were a huge part of determining the legitimacy of indianization. Many argue that only writing could really date the culture and prove indianization. The lives of rulers, daily lives of people, rituals of funeral, weddings and specific customs were a few that helped anthropologists date the indianization of countries. The religions found in India and Southeast Asian countries was another piece of evidence that led anthropologists to understand where the cultures and customs were adopted from.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n==Decline of Indianization==\n===Rise of Islam===\nIslamic control took over as well in the midst of the thirteenth century to trump the Hinduist kingdoms. In the process of Islamism coming to the traditional Hinduism kingdoms, trade was heavily practiced and the now Islamic Indians started becoming merchants all over Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"coedes\" /> Moreover, as trade became more saturated in the Southeast Asian regions wherein Indianization once persisted, the regions had become more Muslim populated. This so-called Islamic control has spanned to many of the trading centers across the regions of Southeast Asia, including one of the most dominant centers, Malacca, and has therefore stressed a widespread rise of Islamization.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n==Distinction from colonialism==\nAmitav Acharya<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amitavacharya.com|title=Amitav Acharya|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>{{reliable|date=November 2019}} argues that \"Indianization is different from traditional [[colonialism]]\" due to the fact that \"it doesn\u2019t involve strangers coming in and taking over an unknown land.\"\n\nInstead, Indian influence from trade routes and language use slowly permeated through [[Southeast Asia]], making the traditions a part of the region.The interactions between India and Southeast Asia were marked by waves of influence and dominance. At some points the Indian culture solely found its way into the region, and at other points the influence was used to take over. Indianization and its influence was seen in nearly all aspects of Southeast Asian society and history. Before the rise of Indianisation, influence of Indian culture, and the introduction of Islam the history of Southeast Asia and its people was unrecorded.

Jews living in the United Kingdom at this time experienced religious discrimination and it is thought that the [[blood libel]] which accused Jews of ritual murder originated in Northern England, leading to [[York Massacre|massacres]] and increasing discrimination.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-2|[2]]]</sup> The Jewish presence continued until [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]'s [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1290.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-3|[3]]]</sup>\n\nJews were readmitted to the United Kingdom by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1655, though it is believed that [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]] lived in England during the expulsion.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-4|[4]]]</sup> Jews were regularly subjected to discrimination and humiliation which waxed and waned over the centuries, gradually declining.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-5|[5]]]</sup>\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the number of Jews in Britain greatly increased due to the exodus of Jews from [[Russia]], which resulted in a large community of Jews forming in the [[East End of London]].<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-6|[6]]]</sup> Popular sentiment against immigration was used by the [[British Union of Fascists]] to incite hatred against Jews, leading to the [[Battle of Cable Street]] in 1936, when the fascists were forced to abandon their march through an area with a large Jewish population when the police clearing the way were unable to remove barricades defended by trade unionists, left wing groups and residents.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-7|[7]]]</sup>\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Holocaust]], undisguised racial hatred of [[Jews]] became unacceptable in [[British society]]. Outbursts of antisemitism emanating from [[Far right in the United Kingdom|far right groups]] continued, however, leading to the formation of the [[43 Group]] led by Jewish ex-servicemen which broke up fascist meetings from 1945 to early 1950.\n\nThe Communal Security Trust (CST) was formed in 1994 to \"[protect] British Jews from antisemitism and related threats\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cst.org.uk/about-cst|title=About CST \u2013 CST \u2013 Protecting Our Jewish Community|website=cst.org.uk|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref> It works in conjunction with the police and other authorities to protect Jewish schools, Synagogues, and other community institutions.\n\nWhile records of antisemitic incidents have been compiled since 1984, changing reporting practices and levels of reporting make comparison over time difficult.\n\n==Communal institutions==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2017}}\n<!--more specific inclusion criteria useful: include only Jewish orgs based in UK that have articles (no redlinks or EXT), sorted alphabetically, these can be found in [[Category:Jewish organisations based in the United Kingdom]] (and sub cats), and other cats-->\nBritish Jewish communal organisations include:\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Anglo-Jewish Association]]\n* [[Association of Jewish Refugees]]\n* [[Board of Deputies of British Jews|Board of Deputies]] (1760)\n* [[CCJO Ren\u00e9 Cassin]]\n* [[Community Security Trust]]\n* [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]]\n* [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]]\n* [[Jewish Book Week|Jewish Book Council]]\n* [[Jewish Care]]\n* [[Jewish Council for Racial Equality]]\n* [[Jewish Genealogical Society of Great Britain]]\n* [[Jewish Leadership Council]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejlc.org/members|title=Members|publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[JW3]] \u2013 a London venue\n* [[Kisharon]]\n* [[League of British Jews]]\n* [[League of Jewish Women]]\n* [[Leo Baeck Institute London]]\n* [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal Judaism]]\n* [[Limmud]]\n* [[London Jewish Forum]]\n* [[London Jewish Cultural Centre]]\n* [[Maccabaeans]]\n* [[Mitzvah Day International]]\n* [[Movement for Reform Judaism]]\n* [[Norwood (charity)|Norwood]]\n* [[The S&P Sephardi Community]]\n* [[Scottish Council of Jewish Communities]]\n* [[Tzelem]]\n* [[UCL Institute of Jewish Studies]]\n* [[UK Jewish Film Festival]]\n* [[Union of Jewish Students]]\n* [[United Restitution Organization]]\n* [[United Synagogue]]\n* [[Union of Jewish Women]]\n* [[World Jewish Relief]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|Judaism}}\n* [[List of British Jews]]\n* [[List of Jewish communities in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[History of the Jews in England]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Scotland]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Ireland]]\n* [[History of the Jews in the Isle of Man]]\n* [[Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group= n}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/All-Party-Parliamentary-Inquiry-into-Antisemitism-REPORT.pdf |title= Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130822190807/http://www.antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/All-Party-Parliamentary-Inquiry-into-Antisemitism-REPORT.pdf |archivedate= 22 August 2013 }}&nbsp;{{small|(430&nbsp;KB)}}.

The series deals with the life of a small city woman, Vidya, who reaches [[Delhi]] after marrying Sagar, a rich businessman.\n\n\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Season 1===\n<!--Per [[WP:TVPLOT]], this section should not exceed 500 words and should present a general overview of the series, not episode-by-episode plot details and twists.-->\nThe story is about a beautiful, simple and loyal woman named Vidya ([[Divyanka Tripathi]]) from [[Benaras]]. She does all the work in her household and her uncle, aunt, and cousin torture her. They don't allow Vidya to get an education, leaving her illiterate. Soon, Rajendra Pratap Singh (the local Thakur) comes to Benaras to find a wife for his son Sagar. When Sagar's father sees Vidya, he decides that she will be his daughter-in-law. On the day of her marriage day, Vidya finds out that Sagar is mentally unstable, having the mind of a child due to the car accident that happened six months ago and almost claimed his life. Sagar does not realize he is married so he and Vidya get off to a rocky start. Sindoora, Sagar's evil stepsister wants the Thakur property to herself and will go to any heights to gain it. She caused the deadly car accident to kill Sagar but was unsuccessful. Chandra and Mahua are Sindoora's younger sisters and do whatever Sindoora tells them to and continually harass Vidya. Sindoora attempts to put much blame on Vidya to kick her out of the house. But, her generous ex-husband Aniket and son Bharat do not take her opinion in which they lend a helping hand to Vidya. Aniket and Bharat both want to see Sagar and Vidya be together. With all of this trouble on her shoulder, she completes all of her duties and makes the room for herself in the other family member's hearts, even Sagar's. Vidya finds out that doctor from Singapore can cure Sagar back to normal, so she and Sagar both go there. Sindoora finds out and then plans multiple attacks on Sagar and Vidya but Sagar's operation went successfully. But, he doesn't remember anything before his car accident and so doesn't remember Vidya. Sindoora then takes advantage of this and tries to poison Sagar's mind against Vidya, but Sagar and Vidya later get married. Sindoora tries again to kill Sagar but Aniket gets paralyzed while trying to protect Sagar. Gayatri, Sagar's paternal aunt arrives and knows that Sindoora is trying to kill Sagar. So she teams up with Vidya to get rid of Sindoora. They try their best to expose Sindoora but Sagar doesn't listen to their arguments. Vidya then pretends to be pregnant for Sagar under Gayatri's orders but fails to hide the truth from him. Sindoora plots and manages to send her ex-husband Aniket to jail. Sindoora then plots and pays a man to run over Gayatri. She doesn't die but went into a coma. She again plans an attack on Sagar in Benares which makes him not just mentally normal, but also remember multiple occasions when Sindoora had tried to kill him. He plots with Vidya and his friend Chinu to get proof against her but Sindoora identifies his plans and attacks the couple again. Later, Sindoora corners Sagar and Vidya on the edge of the cliff of Kailashpati Shankar Mandir (Lord Shiva) and she kills both of them by shooting them with her gun.\n\n===Season 2===\n===21 years later===\nSagar and Vidya were reborn as Amar and Divya on the night of their death. Divya is a modern rich girl from London and Amar is a spontaneous tour guide from Benaras. Amar and Divya both meet there, Divya gets strange flashbacks of her previous birth time which she does not remember immediately but later recalls. It takes time for Amar to remember but he finally does and they both work to get their [[revenge]] on Sindoora with the help of Bharat who kills her the first time but she returns twice. Sindoora's own grown son Bharat helps them. Sindoora again tries her best to keep them apart as their union will mean a threat to her life. In an attempt to separate them, Sindoora wants Divya to marry Samrat who is the fake son of Rajiv and Mahua (as Rajiv swooped Amar and Samrat at the birth time)  and the biological son of Amar's parents. Meanwhile, Amar searches for Divya but undergoes several hardships in the process. Sindoora creates a rift between Amar and Bharat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeetv.com/shows/banoo-main-teri-dulhann/|title=Banoo Main Teri Dulhann - Zee TV - Watch Banoo Main Teri Dulhann TV Serial Online for Free - Ozee|website=www.ZeeTV.com|access-date=9 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508090841/http://www.zeetv.com/shows/banoo-main-teri-dulhann/|archive-date=8 May 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://divyaa.sunphoto.ro/|title=divyaa|website=SunPhoto|access-date=9 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014035055/https://divyaa.sunphoto.ro/|archive-date=14 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n* [[Divyanka Tripathi]] as Vidya Pratap Singh / Divya \u2013 Sagar's wife, Kaushalya's daughter.\n* [[Sharad Malhotra]] as Sagar Pratap Singh / Amar Shivdhar Upadhay / Amar Singh \u2013 Vidya's husband, Son of Rajendra Pratap Singh and Uma Pratap Singh (season 1) / Rajeev and Mahua (season 2) \n* [[Rajendra Gupta]] as Rajendra Pratap Singh\u2013 Sagar, Sindoora, Mahua and Chandra's father.Uma's husband, died of heart attack.

Soon, Rajendra Pratap Singh (the local Thakur) comes to Benaras to find a wife for his son Sagar. When Sagar's father sees Vidya, he decides that she will be his daughter-in-law. On the day of her marriage day, Vidya finds out that Sagar is mentally unstable, having the mind of a child due to the car accident that happened six months ago and almost claimed his life. Sagar does not realize he is married so he and Vidya get off to a rocky start. Sindoora, Sagar's evil stepsister wants the Thakur property to herself and will go to any heights to gain it. She caused the deadly car accident to kill Sagar but was unsuccessful. Chandra and Mahua are Sindoora's younger sisters and do whatever Sindoora tells them to and continually harass Vidya. Sindoora attempts to put much blame on Vidya to kick her out of the house. But, her generous ex-husband Aniket and son Bharat do not take her opinion in which they lend a helping hand to Vidya. Aniket and Bharat both want to see Sagar and Vidya be together. With all of this trouble on her shoulder, she completes all of her duties and makes the room for herself in the other family member's hearts, even Sagar's. Vidya finds out that doctor from Singapore can cure Sagar back to normal, so she and Sagar both go there. Sindoora finds out and then plans multiple attacks on Sagar and Vidya but Sagar's operation went successfully. But, he doesn't remember anything before his car accident and so doesn't remember Vidya. Sindoora then takes advantage of this and tries to poison Sagar's mind against Vidya, but Sagar and Vidya later get married. Sindoora tries again to kill Sagar but Aniket gets paralyzed while trying to protect Sagar. Gayatri, Sagar's paternal aunt arrives and knows that Sindoora is trying to kill Sagar. So she teams up with Vidya to get rid of Sindoora. They try their best to expose Sindoora but Sagar doesn't listen to their arguments. Vidya then pretends to be pregnant for Sagar under Gayatri's orders but fails to hide the truth from him. Sindoora plots and manages to send her ex-husband Aniket to jail. Sindoora then plots and pays a man to run over Gayatri. She doesn't die but went into a coma. She again plans an attack on Sagar in Benares which makes him not just mentally normal, but also remember multiple occasions when Sindoora had tried to kill him. He plots with Vidya and his friend Chinu to get proof against her but Sindoora identifies his plans and attacks the couple again. Later, Sindoora corners Sagar and Vidya on the edge of the cliff of Kailashpati Shankar Mandir (Lord Shiva) and she kills both of them by shooting them with her gun.\n\n===Season 2===\n===21 years later===\nSagar and Vidya were reborn as Amar and Divya on the night of their death. Divya is a modern rich girl from London and Amar is a spontaneous tour guide from Benaras. Amar and Divya both meet there, Divya gets strange flashbacks of her previous birth time which she does not remember immediately but later recalls. It takes time for Amar to remember but he finally does and they both work to get their [[revenge]] on Sindoora with the help of Bharat who kills her the first time but she returns twice. Sindoora's own grown son Bharat helps them. Sindoora again tries her best to keep them apart as their union will mean a threat to her life. In an attempt to separate them, Sindoora wants Divya to marry Samrat who is the fake son of Rajiv and Mahua (as Rajiv swooped Amar and Samrat at the birth time)  and the biological son of Amar's parents. Meanwhile, Amar searches for Divya but undergoes several hardships in the process. Sindoora creates a rift between Amar and Bharat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeetv.com/shows/banoo-main-teri-dulhann/|title=Banoo Main Teri Dulhann - Zee TV - Watch Banoo Main Teri Dulhann TV Serial Online for Free - Ozee|website=www.ZeeTV.com|access-date=9 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508090841/http://www.zeetv.com/shows/banoo-main-teri-dulhann/|archive-date=8 May 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://divyaa.sunphoto.ro/|title=divyaa|website=SunPhoto|access-date=9 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014035055/https://divyaa.sunphoto.ro/|archive-date=14 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n* [[Divyanka Tripathi]] as Vidya Pratap Singh / Divya \u2013 Sagar's wife, Kaushalya's daughter.\n* [[Sharad Malhotra]] as Sagar Pratap Singh / Amar Shivdhar Upadhay / Amar Singh \u2013 Vidya's husband, Son of Rajendra Pratap Singh and Uma Pratap Singh (season 1) / Rajeev and Mahua (season 2) \n* [[Rajendra Gupta]] as Rajendra Pratap Singh\u2013 Sagar, Sindoora, Mahua and Chandra's father.Uma's husband, died of heart attack.

Livestock manure helps maintain the fertility of grazing lands. Manure is commonly collected from barns and feeding areas to fertilize cropland.  In some places, animal manure is used as fuel,  either directly (as in some developing countries), or indirectly (as a source of methane for heating or for generating electricity).

For many abattoirs, very little animal biomass may be wasted at slaughter.  Even intestinal contents removed at slaughter may be recovered for use as fertilizer. Livestock manure helps maintain the fertility of grazing lands. Manure is commonly collected from barns and feeding areas to fertilize cropland.  In some places, animal manure is used as fuel,  either directly (as in some developing countries), or indirectly (as a source of methane for heating or for generating electricity).  In regions where machine power is limited, some classes of livestock are used as draft stock, not only for [[tillage]] and other on-farm use, but also for transport of people and goods.

In one of several varying Muslim traditions, it is the site where the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]] tied his winged steed, al-[[Buraq]], on his [[night journey|Isra and Mi'raj]] to Jerusalem before ascending to paradise, and constitutes the eastern border of ''al-Haram al-Sharif'', the Noble Sanctuary of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].\n\nThe Western Wall's holiness in Judaism is a result of its proximity to the Temple Mount. Because of the [[Temple Mount entry restrictions]], the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, though the [[Foundation Stone|holiest site in the Jewish faith]] lies behind it. The original, natural, and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by Herod, who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support the Temple platform and using extensive substructures and earth fills in order to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved platform which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one is considered to be closest to the former [[Holy of Holies]], which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount platform.\n\nJust over half the wall's total height, including its 17 [[course (architecture)|courses]] located below street level, dates from the end of the [[Second Temple]] period, and is commonly believed to have been built by Herod the Great starting in 19 BCE, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad period]], while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.\n\nThe term Western Wall and its variations are mostly used in a narrow sense for the section traditionally used by Jews for prayer; it has also been called the \"Wailing Wall\", referring to the practice of Jews weeping at the site over the destruction of the Temples. During the period of [[Byzantine Empire|Christian Roman rule]] over Jerusalem (ca. 324\u2013638), Jews were completely barred from Jerusalem except to attend [[Tisha B'Av]], the day of national mourning for the Temples, and on this day the Jews would weep at their holy places. The term \"Wailing Wall\" was thus almost exclusively used by Christians, and was revived in the period of non-Jewish control between the establishment of [[Mandatory Palestine|British Rule]] in 1920 and the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. The term \"Wailing Wall\" is not used by religious Jews, and increasingly not by many others who consider it derogatory.<ref name=\"Halkin01\">{{harvnb|Halkin|2001}}</ref>\n\nIn a broader sense, \"Western Wall\" can refer to the entire {{convert|488|m|ft}}-long retaining wall on the western side of the Temple Mount. The classic portion now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, while the rest of the wall is concealed behind structures in the [[Muslim Quarter]], with the small exception of a {{convert|8|m|ft}} section, the so-called [[Little Western Wall]]. The segment of the western retaining wall traditionally used for Jewish liturgy, known as the \"Western Wall\" or \"Wailing Wall\", derives its particular importance to it having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings, and displaying much more of the original Herodian [[stonework]] than the \"Little Western Wall\". In religious terms, the \"Little Western Wall\" is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the \"presence of God\" ([[Shechina]]), and the [[Western Wall Tunnel|underground]] [[Warren's Gate]], which has been out of reach for Jews from the 12th century till its partial excavation in the 20th century, even more so.\n\nWhilst the wall was considered Muslim property as an integral part of the [[Haram esh-Sharif]] and [[waqf]] property of the [[Moroccan Quarter]], a right of Jewish prayer and [[pilgrimage]] existed as part of the [[Status Quo (Jerusalem and Bethlehem)|Status Quo]].<ref>{{cite book |title=United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine Working Paper on the Holy Places|date=1949|author=UN Conciliation Commission|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_Nations_Conciliation_Commission_for_Palestine_Working_Paper_on_the_Holy_Places.djvu|pages=26|quote=The Palestine Administration interpreted the Status Quo in respect of the Wailing Wall as being that the Jewish Community had a right of access to the pavement in front of the Wall for their devotions, but that the Wall itself, the pavement in front of it and the adjacent Moroccan Quarter, were legally Moslem property. The Jews might bring to the Wall only those appurtenances of worship that were allowed under the Ottoman regime. This position was in general reaffirmed by the International Commission appointed by the British Government in 1930, with the approval of the Council of the League of Nations, to enquire into conflicting rights and claims concerning the Wailing Wall. The International Commission further ruled that although the Jews enjoyed no sort of proprietary rights to the Wall or the adjacent pavement, they should have free access to them at all times, subject to certain stipulations. The placing of benches and screens against the Wall was prohibited; the Moslems were similarly forbidden to carry out the Zikr ceremony during the progress of Jewish devotions or to cause annoyance to the Jews in any other way; no political speeches or demonstrations near the Wall were to be allowed; the Moslems' right to repair the pavement was affirmed, and if any repairs were not carried out by them in due time, the work was to be undertaken by the Government. The maintenance of the Wall itself was entrusted to the Government, but it was understood that repairs to it should be carried out only after consultation with the Supreme Moslem Council and the Chief Rabbinate.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Status Quo in the Holy Places|date=1929|first=L.

Some of the dwellings are entered from the space in front of the Wall. The wall separating the garden to the north from the Wailing Wall was rebuilt without incident in 1929. The wall overlooking the Wailing Wall by the Bab-al-Mughrabi was also rebuilt at the same time. The Moslems wanted to erect a low wall, but it was ruled, to preserve the Status Quo, that the wall must be rebuilt to its former height. The Wailing Wall, as being one of the few relics of the Temple of Herod of undisputed authenticity, is held in very great veneration by the Jews. Jewish writers refer to it as \"the Holiest possession of the fifteen millions of Jews throughout the world which they have not forgotten for one moment since the Dispersion.\" On Sabbaths and other Holy Days the Wall is thronged with worshippers, the American and European Jew mixing with the Orthodox Jew in his caftan and the Bokharan in his gorgeous silks. The Jewish custom of praying here is of considerable antiquity, being mentioned by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela and has now become an established right. This right to pray has, however, become linked with the claim to the actual ownership of the Wall. The Moslems resist this on the ground that the Wall is an integral part of the enclosure wall of the Haram al Sharif, and that the space in front of it is a public way, and part of the premises of the Abu Midian Waqf. For this reason the Moslems have always protested against the placing of benches or chairs in front of the Wall by the Jews as causing an obstruction in this public way and implying possessory rights. Though benches have certainly from time to time been introduced, there is extant a resolution taken by the Administrative Council and confirmed by the Mutasarrif in 1912 that chairs or tents or curtains (to divide the women from the men) are not to be allowed. This is still enforced, but portable camp-stools or boxes or tins with cushions are permitted for the convenience of worshippers. This ruling was notified to the Jewish religious authorities and the Police by the District Governor in 1922, and confirmed in 1926 after a rather serious dispute had arisen on account of the introduction of some benches on the previous Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).}}</ref><ref name=\"Reiter2017\">{{cite book |author=Yitzhak Reiter|title=Contested Holy Places in Israel\u2013Palestine: Sharing and Conflict Resolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ieyfDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT26|date=7 April 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-99884-0|pages=26\u2013}}</ref> This position was confirmed in a [[1930 Western Wall Commission|1930 international commission]] during the British Mandate period.\n\nThe earliest source mentioning this specific site as a place of Jewish worship is from the 17th century.<ref name=\"Goren\">{{cite book |first= Amnon |last= Ramon  |title= Delicate balances at the Temple Mount, 1967-1999  |work= Jerusalem: A City and Its Future |editors= Marshall J.

From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence at the foot of the wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly [[1929 Palestine riots|riot in 1929]] in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] the eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]], and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the [[Six-Day War]]. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site, the [[Moroccan Quarter]] was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.<ref>{{harvnb|Peters|1984}} \"One of the best documented endowments, one that embraced the entire quarter of Western Muslims or Maghrebis\".</ref>\n\n[[File:Jerusalem Western Wall stones.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Herodian ashlars of the Western Wall]]\n\n==Etymology==\n===Western Wall===\nEarly Jewish texts referred to a \"western wall of the Temple\",<ref name=SSR>[[Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah]], ch. 2\u20138</ref> but there is doubt whether the texts were referring to the outer, retaining wall called today \"the Western Wall\", or to the western wall of the actual Temple.<ref name=\"Halkin01\"/> The earliest Jewish use of the Hebrew term \"ha-kotel ha-ma'aravi\", \"the Western Wall\", as referring to the wall visible today, was by the 11th-century poet [[Ahimaaz ben Paltiel]].<ref name=\"Halkin01\"/>\n\n===Wailing Wall===\nThe name \"Wailing Wall\", and descriptions such as \"wailing place\", appeared regularly in English literature during the 19th century.<ref>\"Wailing Wall\" appears, for example, in J.J.

The Orthodox held that services at the Wall should follow traditional Jewish law for segregated seating followed in synagogues, while the non-Orthodox perspective was that \"the Wall is a shrine of all Jews, not one particular branch of Judaism.\"<ref name=\"jta.org\">[http://www.jta.org/2015/04/24/news-opinion/the-telegraph/from-the-archive-when-the-western-wall-battles-began From the Archive: First rumblings in the battle for pluralism at the Western Wall] JTA, April 24, 2015.</ref>\n\n==Wilson's Arch area==\n[[File:Jerusalem Western Wall BW 2.JPG|thumb|right|Torah Ark inside men's section of Wilson's Arch]]\n{{Main|Wilson's Arch (Jerusalem)}}\n\n===Transformation into worship area===\nIn 2005, the [[Western Wall Heritage Foundation]] initiated a major renovation effort under Rabbi-of-the-Wall [[Shmuel Rabinovitch]].

According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by [[Kareth]]. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the [[Dome of the Rock]] is the Foundation Stone,<ref>[[Radbaz]] [[Responsa]] 691: \"Under the [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] on the Temple Mount, which the Arabs call El-Sakhrah, without a doubt, is the location of the Foundation Stone.\"; Ya'ari, Avraham: ''Igrot Eretz Yisrael'' by [[Obadiah ben Abraham]], [[Ramat Gan]] 1971: \"I sought the place of the Foundation Stone where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was placed, and many people told me it is under a tall and beautiful [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] which the Arabs built in the Temple precinct.\"</ref> some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain.<ref>[[Moishe Sternbuch|Sternbuch, Moishe]] ''Teshuvos Ve-hanhagos'' Vol. 3, Ch. 39: \"In truth they have erred, thinking that the stone upon they built their dome was in fact the Foundation Stone, however, most possibly, the Stone is located further to the south in the open space opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall.\"</ref> This spot was the site of the [[Kodesh Hakodashim|Holy of Holies]] when the Temple stood.\n\n===Part of the Temple proper===\nRabbinic tradition teaches that the western wall was built upon foundations laid by the biblical [[King Solomon]] from the time of the [[First Temple]].<ref name=KHB>Frishman, Avraham; ''Kum Hisalech Be\u2019aretz'', [[Jerusalem]] 2004</ref>\n\nSome medieval rabbis claimed that today's Western Wall is a surviving wall of the Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest they enter the Temple precincts in a state of impurity.<ref>See Radvaz 692</ref> Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness.<ref name=AH>{{cite book\n| last= Horovitz |first= Ahron |title= Jerusalem: Footsteps Through Time |year= 2001\n| publisher= [[Feldheim Publishers|Feldheim]] |location= [[Jerusalem]] |chapter =\n| quote= However, today there is no doubt that the wall is the western retaining wall of the Temple Mount and the Midrash refers to the Temple in its broader sense, that is, the Temple Mount.}}</ref>\n\n===Divine custody===\nA [[Midrash]] compiled in [[Late Antiquity]] refers to a western wall of the Temple which \"would never be destroyed\",<ref name=SSR/> and [[Lamentations Rabbah]] mentions how [[Roman Empire|Rome]] was unable to topple the western wall due to the Divine oath promising its eternal survival.<ref>[[Lamentations Rabbah]] 1:32</ref>\n\n===Divine Presence===\nAnother Midrash quotes a 4th-century scholar: \"Rav Acha said that the Divine Presence has never departed from the Western Wall\",<ref>[[Exodus Rabbah]] 2:2</ref> and the [[Zohar]] similarly writes that \"the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]] rests upon the Western Wall\".<ref>[[Zohar]] [[Mishpatim]] 116</ref>\n\nEighteenth-century scholar [[Jonathan Eybeschutz]] writes that \"after the destruction of the Temple, God removed His Presence from His sanctuary and placed it upon the Western Wall where it remains in its holiness and honour\".<ref>''[[Jonathan Eybeschutz#Works|Ya'arot Devash]]'' Vol. 1, Ch. 4</ref> It is told that great Jewish sages, including [[Isaac Luria]] and the [[Radvaz]], experienced a revelation of the Divine Presence at the wall.<ref>See also ''[[Kav ha-Yashar]]'' Ch. 93 and ''[[Chaim Joseph David Azulai#His Shem ha-Gedolim|Shem Ha-gedolim]]'' for a similar account with Rabbi Avraham Ha-levi of Safed.</ref>\n\n===Kabbalah of the word ''kotel''===\nRabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Kaindenover]] discusses the mystical aspect of the Hebrew word ''kotel'' when discussing the significance of praying against a wall.

It is a relatively small segment of a far longer ancient retaining wall, known also in its entirety as the \"Western Wall\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Complete visual compendium of Western Wall|url=https://madainproject.com/western_wall_(temple_mount)|website=Madain Project|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref> The wall was originally erected as part of the expansion of the [[Second Jewish Temple]] begun by [[Herod the Great]], which resulted in the encasement of the natural, steep hill known to Jews and Christians as the [[Temple Mount]], in a huge rectangular structure topped by a flat platform, thus creating more space for the Temple itself, its auxiliary buildings, and crowds of worshippers and visitors. In one of several varying Muslim traditions, it is the site where the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]] tied his winged steed, al-[[Buraq]], on his [[night journey|Isra and Mi'raj]] to Jerusalem before ascending to paradise, and constitutes the eastern border of ''al-Haram al-Sharif'', the Noble Sanctuary of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].\n\nThe Western Wall's holiness in Judaism is a result of its proximity to the Temple Mount. Because of the [[Temple Mount entry restrictions]], the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, though the [[Foundation Stone|holiest site in the Jewish faith]] lies behind it. The original, natural, and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by Herod, who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support the Temple platform and using extensive substructures and earth fills in order to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved platform which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one is considered to be closest to the former [[Holy of Holies]], which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount platform.\n\nJust over half the wall's total height, including its 17 [[course (architecture)|courses]] located below street level, dates from the end of the [[Second Temple]] period, and is commonly believed to have been built by Herod the Great starting in 19 BCE, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad period]], while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.\n\nThe term Western Wall and its variations are mostly used in a narrow sense for the section traditionally used by Jews for prayer; it has also been called the \"Wailing Wall\", referring to the practice of Jews weeping at the site over the destruction of the Temples. During the period of [[Byzantine Empire|Christian Roman rule]] over Jerusalem (ca. 324\u2013638), Jews were completely barred from Jerusalem except to attend [[Tisha B'Av]], the day of national mourning for the Temples, and on this day the Jews would weep at their holy places. The term \"Wailing Wall\" was thus almost exclusively used by Christians, and was revived in the period of non-Jewish control between the establishment of [[Mandatory Palestine|British Rule]] in 1920 and the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. The term \"Wailing Wall\" is not used by religious Jews, and increasingly not by many others who consider it derogatory.<ref name=\"Halkin01\">{{harvnb|Halkin|2001}}</ref>\n\nIn a broader sense, \"Western Wall\" can refer to the entire {{convert|488|m|ft}}-long retaining wall on the western side of the Temple Mount. The classic portion now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, while the rest of the wall is concealed behind structures in the [[Muslim Quarter]], with the small exception of a {{convert|8|m|ft}} section, the so-called [[Little Western Wall]]. The segment of the western retaining wall traditionally used for Jewish liturgy, known as the \"Western Wall\" or \"Wailing Wall\", derives its particular importance to it having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings, and displaying much more of the original Herodian [[stonework]] than the \"Little Western Wall\". In religious terms, the \"Little Western Wall\" is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the \"presence of God\" ([[Shechina]]), and the [[Western Wall Tunnel|underground]] [[Warren's Gate]], which has been out of reach for Jews from the 12th century till its partial excavation in the 20th century, even more so.\n\nWhilst the wall was considered Muslim property as an integral part of the [[Haram esh-Sharif]] and [[waqf]] property of the [[Moroccan Quarter]], a right of Jewish prayer and [[pilgrimage]] existed as part of the [[Status Quo (Jerusalem and Bethlehem)|Status Quo]].<ref>{{cite book |title=United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine Working Paper on the Holy Places|date=1949|author=UN Conciliation Commission|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_Nations_Conciliation_Commission_for_Palestine_Working_Paper_on_the_Holy_Places.djvu|pages=26|quote=The Palestine Administration interpreted the Status Quo in respect of the Wailing Wall as being that the Jewish Community had a right of access to the pavement in front of the Wall for their devotions, but that the Wall itself, the pavement in front of it and the adjacent Moroccan Quarter, were legally Moslem property. The Jews might bring to the Wall only those appurtenances of worship that were allowed under the Ottoman regime. This position was in general reaffirmed by the International Commission appointed by the British Government in 1930, with the approval of the Council of the League of Nations, to enquire into conflicting rights and claims concerning the Wailing Wall. The International Commission further ruled that although the Jews enjoyed no sort of proprietary rights to the Wall or the adjacent pavement, they should have free access to them at all times, subject to certain stipulations. The placing of benches and screens against the Wall was prohibited; the Moslems were similarly forbidden to carry out the Zikr ceremony during the progress of Jewish devotions or to cause annoyance to the Jews in any other way; no political speeches or demonstrations near the Wall were to be allowed; the Moslems' right to repair the pavement was affirmed, and if any repairs were not carried out by them in due time, the work was to be undertaken by the Government. The maintenance of the Wall itself was entrusted to the Government, but it was understood that repairs to it should be carried out only after consultation with the Supreme Moslem Council and the Chief Rabbinate.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Status Quo in the Holy Places|date=1929|first=L.

Some of the dwellings are entered from the space in front of the Wall. The wall separating the garden to the north from the Wailing Wall was rebuilt without incident in 1929. The wall overlooking the Wailing Wall by the Bab-al-Mughrabi was also rebuilt at the same time. The Moslems wanted to erect a low wall, but it was ruled, to preserve the Status Quo, that the wall must be rebuilt to its former height. The Wailing Wall, as being one of the few relics of the Temple of Herod of undisputed authenticity, is held in very great veneration by the Jews. Jewish writers refer to it as \"the Holiest possession of the fifteen millions of Jews throughout the world which they have not forgotten for one moment since the Dispersion.\" On Sabbaths and other Holy Days the Wall is thronged with worshippers, the American and European Jew mixing with the Orthodox Jew in his caftan and the Bokharan in his gorgeous silks. The Jewish custom of praying here is of considerable antiquity, being mentioned by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela and has now become an established right. This right to pray has, however, become linked with the claim to the actual ownership of the Wall. The Moslems resist this on the ground that the Wall is an integral part of the enclosure wall of the Haram al Sharif, and that the space in front of it is a public way, and part of the premises of the Abu Midian Waqf. For this reason the Moslems have always protested against the placing of benches or chairs in front of the Wall by the Jews as causing an obstruction in this public way and implying possessory rights. Though benches have certainly from time to time been introduced, there is extant a resolution taken by the Administrative Council and confirmed by the Mutasarrif in 1912 that chairs or tents or curtains (to divide the women from the men) are not to be allowed. This is still enforced, but portable camp-stools or boxes or tins with cushions are permitted for the convenience of worshippers. This ruling was notified to the Jewish religious authorities and the Police by the District Governor in 1922, and confirmed in 1926 after a rather serious dispute had arisen on account of the introduction of some benches on the previous Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).}}</ref><ref name=\"Reiter2017\">{{cite book |author=Yitzhak Reiter|title=Contested Holy Places in Israel\u2013Palestine: Sharing and Conflict Resolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ieyfDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT26|date=7 April 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-99884-0|pages=26\u2013}}</ref> This position was confirmed in a [[1930 Western Wall Commission|1930 international commission]] during the British Mandate period.\n\nThe earliest source mentioning this specific site as a place of Jewish worship is from the 17th century.<ref name=\"Goren\">{{cite book |first= Amnon |last= Ramon  |title= Delicate balances at the Temple Mount, 1967-1999  |work= Jerusalem: A City and Its Future |editors= Marshall J.

From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence at the foot of the wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly [[1929 Palestine riots|riot in 1929]] in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] the eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the [[Jewish Quarter]], and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the [[Six-Day War]]. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site, the [[Moroccan Quarter]] was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.<ref>{{harvnb|Peters|1984}} \"One of the best documented endowments, one that embraced the entire quarter of Western Muslims or Maghrebis\".</ref>\n\n[[File:Jerusalem Western Wall stones.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Herodian ashlars of the Western Wall]]\n\n==Etymology==\n===Western Wall===\nEarly Jewish texts referred to a \"western wall of the Temple\",<ref name=SSR>[[Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah]], ch. 2\u20138</ref> but there is doubt whether the texts were referring to the outer, retaining wall called today \"the Western Wall\", or to the western wall of the actual Temple.<ref name=\"Halkin01\"/> The earliest Jewish use of the Hebrew term \"ha-kotel ha-ma'aravi\", \"the Western Wall\", as referring to the wall visible today, was by the 11th-century poet [[Ahimaaz ben Paltiel]].<ref name=\"Halkin01\"/>\n\n===Wailing Wall===\nThe name \"Wailing Wall\", and descriptions such as \"wailing place\", appeared regularly in English literature during the 19th century.<ref>\"Wailing Wall\" appears, for example, in J.J.

Today's Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform. In 2011, Israeli archaeologists announced the surprising discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod's death, found under the foundation stones of the wall.

Also surprising was the fact that the usually very thorough Herodian builders had cut corners by filling in the ritual bath, rather than placing the foundation course directly onto the much firmer bedrock.

Later visiting rabbis (12th-15th centuries) also refer to the walls of the Temple Mount, but they too, are not specific in terms of a gathering spot for Jewish worship along the Western Wall. The Western Wall is not mentioned at all by Nahmanides (13th century) in his detailed account of the Temple site in 1267 nor in the report of [[Ishtori Haparchi|Estori ha-Parhi]] (14th century). It does not figure even in descriptions of Jerusalem in Jewish sources of the 15th century (e.g., Meshullam of Volterra, [[Obadiah ben Abraham|Obadiah of Bertinoro]], etc.). The name Western Wall, used by Obadiah, refers - as can be inferred from the context - to the southwestern corner of the wall, and there is no hint that there was a place of Jewish worship there.

However, Jews had the right to \"free access to the Western Wall for the purpose of devotions at all times\", subject to some stipulations that limited which objects could be brought to the Wall and forbade the blowing of the [[shofar]], which was made illegal.

It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, as it is the closest permitted accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the ''Even ha-shetiya'' or [[Foundation Stone]], which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by [[Kareth]]. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the [[Dome of the Rock]] is the Foundation Stone,<ref>[[Radbaz]] [[Responsa]] 691: \"Under the [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] on the Temple Mount, which the Arabs call El-Sakhrah, without a doubt, is the location of the Foundation Stone.\"; Ya'ari, Avraham: ''Igrot Eretz Yisrael'' by [[Obadiah ben Abraham]], [[Ramat Gan]] 1971: \"I sought the place of the Foundation Stone where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was placed, and many people told me it is under a tall and beautiful [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] which the Arabs built in the Temple precinct.\"</ref> some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain.<ref>[[Moishe Sternbuch|Sternbuch, Moishe]] ''Teshuvos Ve-hanhagos'' Vol. 3, Ch. 39: \"In truth they have erred, thinking that the stone upon they built their dome was in fact the Foundation Stone, however, most possibly, the Stone is located further to the south in the open space opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall.\"</ref> This spot was the site of the [[Kodesh Hakodashim|Holy of Holies]] when the Temple stood.\n\n===Part of the Temple proper===\nRabbinic tradition teaches that the western wall was built upon foundations laid by the biblical [[King Solomon]] from the time of the [[First Temple]].<ref name=KHB>Frishman, Avraham; ''Kum Hisalech Be\u2019aretz'', [[Jerusalem]] 2004</ref>\n\nSome medieval rabbis claimed that today's Western Wall is a surviving wall of the Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest they enter the Temple precincts in a state of impurity.<ref>See Radvaz 692</ref> Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness.<ref name=AH>{{cite book\n| last= Horovitz |first= Ahron |title= Jerusalem: Footsteps Through Time |year= 2001\n| publisher= [[Feldheim Publishers|Feldheim]] |location= [[Jerusalem]] |chapter =\n| quote= However, today there is no doubt that the wall is the western retaining wall of the Temple Mount and the Midrash refers to the Temple in its broader sense, that is, the Temple Mount.}}</ref>\n\n===Divine custody===\nA [[Midrash]] compiled in [[Late Antiquity]] refers to a western wall of the Temple which \"would never be destroyed\",<ref name=SSR/> and [[Lamentations Rabbah]] mentions how [[Roman Empire|Rome]] was unable to topple the western wall due to the Divine oath promising its eternal survival.<ref>[[Lamentations Rabbah]] 1:32</ref>\n\n===Divine Presence===\nAnother Midrash quotes a 4th-century scholar: \"Rav Acha said that the Divine Presence has never departed from the Western Wall\",<ref>[[Exodus Rabbah]] 2:2</ref> and the [[Zohar]] similarly writes that \"the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]] rests upon the Western Wall\".<ref>[[Zohar]] [[Mishpatim]] 116</ref>\n\nEighteenth-century scholar [[Jonathan Eybeschutz]] writes that \"after the destruction of the Temple, God removed His Presence from His sanctuary and placed it upon the Western Wall where it remains in its holiness and honour\".<ref>''[[Jonathan Eybeschutz#Works|Ya'arot Devash]]'' Vol. 1, Ch. 4</ref> It is told that great Jewish sages, including [[Isaac Luria]] and the [[Radvaz]], experienced a revelation of the Divine Presence at the wall.<ref>See also ''[[Kav ha-Yashar]]'' Ch. 93 and ''[[Chaim Joseph David Azulai#His Shem ha-Gedolim|Shem Ha-gedolim]]'' for a similar account with Rabbi Avraham Ha-levi of Safed.</ref>\n\n===Kabbalah of the word ''kotel''===\nRabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Kaindenover]] discusses the mystical aspect of the Hebrew word ''kotel'' when discussing the significance of praying against a wall.

These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised the sanctity of the Wall.<ref name=SLC/> Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long [[responsa]] appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper ''[[Israel Dov Frumkin#Havatzelet|Havatzelet]]'' in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration.<ref name=SLC/> More recently the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness.<ref name=YY>{{cite book\n| last= Yosef\n| first= Ovadia\n| authorlink= Ovadia Yosef\n| title= ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]''\n| year= 1990\n| location= [[Jerusalem]]\n| volume= 2, Laws of Kotel HaMa'aravi\n| pages= 278\u2013282\n| nopp= true\n}}</ref> Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a [[halachic]] point of view.

Others disagree, pointing to the fact that the Temple Mount is controlled by the Muslim ''waqf'' and that the mosques which sit upon the Temple site should increase feelings of distress.

BIW has built private, commercial, and military vessels, most of which have been ordered by the United States Navy.  The shipyard has built and sometimes designed battleships, frigates, cruisers, and destroyers, including the {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|4}} which are currently among the world's most advanced surface warships.\n\nSince 1995, Bath Iron Works has been a subsidiary of [[General Dynamics]], the fifth-largest defense contractor in the world as of 2008. During [[World War II]], ships built at BIW were considered to be of superior toughness by sailors and Navy officials, giving rise to the phrase \"Bath-built is best-built.\"<ref>See Peniston, Sanders, Snow.</ref>\n\n== History ==\nBath Iron Works was incorporated in 1884 by General [[Thomas W. Hyde]], a native of Bath who served in the [[American Civil War]]. After the war, he bought a shop that made windlasses and other iron hardware for the wooden ships built in Bath's many shipyards. He expanded the business by improving its practices, entering new markets, and acquiring other local businesses. By 1882, Hyde Windlass was eyeing the new and growing business of iron shipbuilding, and it incorporated as Bath Iron Works in 1884. On February 28, 1890, BIW won its first contract for complete vessels: two iron gunboats for the Navy. One of these {{convert|190|ft|m|adj=on}} ships was the {{USS|Machias|PG-5|2}}, the first ship launched by the company. In 1892, the yard won its first commercial contract for the 2,500-ton steel passenger steamer {{ship|SS|City of Lowell||2}}. In the 1890s, the company built several yachts for wealthy sailors.\n\nIn 1899, Hyde was suffering from [[Bright's Disease]] and resigned from management of the shipyard, leaving his sons Edward and John in charge. The shipyard began construction of {{USS|Georgia|BB-15|2}} that same year, the only battleship ever built in Bath. It dominated the yard for five years until its launching in 1904, and was at times the only ship under construction. The yard faced numerous challenges because of the weight of armor and weapons. In sea trials, ''Georgia'' averaged {{convert|19.26|kn|lk=in}} for four hours, making her the fastest ship in her class and the fastest battleship in the United States Navy at the time. The company continued to rely on Navy contracts, which provided 86-percent of the value of new contracts between 1905 and 1917. The yard also produced fishing trawlers, freighters, and yachts throughout the first half of the century. These included ''Vanda'', ''Hi-Esmaro'', ''Aras I'' and ''Aras II'', ''Caroline'', and ''Corsair IV'', which later served as a cruise ship before sinking off [[Acapulco]], Mexico in 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandmonthly.com/portmag/2017/09/end-games/|title=End Games \u2013 PORTLAND MAGAZINE|author=|date=|website=www.portlandmonthly.com}}</ref> The shipyard was at peak production during World War II (1943\u20131944) and launched a destroyer every 17 days. Bath Iron Works ranked 50th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.<ref>{{citation |last=Peck |first=Merton J. |authorlink2=Frederic M.

Roberts|FFG-58|6}} on July 31, 1988]]\n\n{{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|FFG-58|6}} was commissioned at Bath in 1986, and it survived a mine explosion which tore a hole in its engine room and flooded two compartments. Over the next two years, BIW repaired the ship in unique fashion. The [[guided missile frigate]] was towed to the company's dry dock in [[Portland, Maine]], and put up on blocks, where the damaged engine room was cut out of the ship. Meanwhile, workers in Bath built a 315-ton replacement, and the module was floated south to Portland, placed on the dry dock, slid into place under the frigate, jacked up, and welded into place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navybook.com/nohigherhonor/pic-ffg58repair.shtml|title=FFG 58: Repair at Bath Iron Works|author=|date=5 February 2013|website=navybook.com}}</ref> \nIn 1995, Bath Iron Works was bought by General Dynamics. In 2001, the company wrapped up a four-year effort to build the Land Level Transfer Facility, an enormous concrete platform for final assembly of its ships, instead of building them on a sloping way so that they could slide into the Kennebec at launch. Hulls are now moved by rail from the platform horizontally onto a moveable dry dock, which greatly reduced the work involved in building and launching the ships.<ref>[http://www.gdbiw.com/company_overview/history/default.htm GDBIW.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928143414/http://www.gdbiw.com/company_overview/history/default.htm |date=2007-09-28 }}</ref> The {{convert|750|ft|m|adj=on}}, 28,000-ton dry dock was built by China's Jiangdu Yuchai Shipbuilding Company for $27 million.<ref name=\"UPI\">{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Bath Iron Works picks Chinese firm | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = United Press International | date = 1998-09-14 | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-17538952.html | accessdate = 2008-10-18}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Bath Iron Works signed a contract with US Navy for new destroyers, [[littoral combat ship]]s, and new landing craft.

BIW has built private, commercial, and military vessels, most of which have been ordered by the United States Navy.  The shipyard has built and sometimes designed battleships, frigates, cruisers, and destroyers, including the {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|4}} which are currently among the world's most advanced surface warships.\n\nSince 1995, Bath Iron Works has been a subsidiary of [[General Dynamics]], the fifth-largest defense contractor in the world as of 2008. During [[World War II]], ships built at BIW were considered to be of superior toughness by sailors and Navy officials, giving rise to the phrase \"Bath-built is best-built.\"<ref>See Peniston, Sanders, Snow.</ref>\n\n== History ==\nBath Iron Works was incorporated in 1884 by General [[Thomas W. Hyde]], a native of Bath who served in the [[American Civil War]]. After the war, he bought a shop that made windlasses and other iron hardware for the wooden ships built in Bath's many shipyards. He expanded the business by improving its practices, entering new markets, and acquiring other local businesses. By 1882, Hyde Windlass was eyeing the new and growing business of iron shipbuilding, and it incorporated as Bath Iron Works in 1884. On February 28, 1890, BIW won its first contract for complete vessels: two iron gunboats for the Navy. One of these {{convert|190|ft|m|adj=on}} ships was the {{USS|Machias|PG-5|2}}, the first ship launched by the company. In 1892, the yard won its first commercial contract for the 2,500-ton steel passenger steamer {{ship|SS|City of Lowell||2}}. In the 1890s, the company built several yachts for wealthy sailors.\n\nIn 1899, Hyde was suffering from [[Bright's Disease]] and resigned from management of the shipyard, leaving his sons Edward and John in charge. The shipyard began construction of {{USS|Georgia|BB-15|2}} that same year, the only battleship ever built in Bath. It dominated the yard for five years until its launching in 1904, and was at times the only ship under construction. The yard faced numerous challenges because of the weight of armor and weapons. In sea trials, ''Georgia'' averaged {{convert|19.26|kn|lk=in}} for four hours, making her the fastest ship in her class and the fastest battleship in the United States Navy at the time. The company continued to rely on Navy contracts, which provided 86-percent of the value of new contracts between 1905 and 1917. The yard also produced fishing trawlers, freighters, and yachts throughout the first half of the century. These included ''Vanda'', ''Hi-Esmaro'', ''Aras I'' and ''Aras II'', ''Caroline'', and ''Corsair IV'', which later served as a cruise ship before sinking off [[Acapulco]], Mexico in 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandmonthly.com/portmag/2017/09/end-games/|title=End Games \u2013 PORTLAND MAGAZINE|author=|date=|website=www.portlandmonthly.com}}</ref> The shipyard was at peak production during World War II (1943\u20131944) and launched a destroyer every 17 days. Bath Iron Works ranked 50th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.<ref>{{citation |last=Peck |first=Merton J. |authorlink2=Frederic M.

Roberts|FFG-58|6}} on July 31, 1988]]\n\n{{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|FFG-58|6}} was commissioned at Bath in 1986, and it survived a mine explosion which tore a hole in its engine room and flooded two compartments. Over the next two years, BIW repaired the ship in unique fashion. The [[guided missile frigate]] was towed to the company's dry dock in [[Portland, Maine]], and put up on blocks, where the damaged engine room was cut out of the ship. Meanwhile, workers in Bath built a 315-ton replacement, and the module was floated south to Portland, placed on the dry dock, slid into place under the frigate, jacked up, and welded into place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navybook.com/nohigherhonor/pic-ffg58repair.shtml|title=FFG 58: Repair at Bath Iron Works|author=|date=5 February 2013|website=navybook.com}}</ref> \nIn 1995, Bath Iron Works was bought by General Dynamics. In 2001, the company wrapped up a four-year effort to build the Land Level Transfer Facility, an enormous concrete platform for final assembly of its ships, instead of building them on a sloping way so that they could slide into the Kennebec at launch. Hulls are now moved by rail from the platform horizontally onto a moveable dry dock, which greatly reduced the work involved in building and launching the ships.<ref>[http://www.gdbiw.com/company_overview/history/default.htm GDBIW.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928143414/http://www.gdbiw.com/company_overview/history/default.htm |date=2007-09-28 }}</ref> The {{convert|750|ft|m|adj=on}}, 28,000-ton dry dock was built by China's Jiangdu Yuchai Shipbuilding Company for $27 million.<ref name=\"UPI\">{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Bath Iron Works picks Chinese firm | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = United Press International | date = 1998-09-14 | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-17538952.html | accessdate = 2008-10-18}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Bath Iron Works signed a contract with US Navy for new destroyers, [[littoral combat ship]]s, and new landing craft.

The victims were five children\u2014Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans\u2014aged between 10 and 17, at least four of whom were [[Sexual assault|sexually assaulted]].  Two of the victims were discovered in graves dug on [[Saddleworth Moor]]; a third grave was discovered there in 1987, more than twenty years after Brady and Hindley's trial.  Bennett's body is also thought to be buried there, but despite repeated searches it remains undiscovered.\n\nThe pair were charged only in the deaths of Kilbride, Downey and Evans, and received life sentences.  The investigation was reopened in 1985, after Brady was reported as having confessed to the murders of Reade and Bennett.  After confessing to these additional murders, Brady and Hindley were taken separately to Saddleworth Moor to assist in the search for the graves.\n\nCharacterised by the press as \"the most evil woman in Britain\",<ref>{{cite news|title=Hindley: I wish I'd been hanged|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/661139.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|date=29 February 2000 |access-date=11 August 2009}}</ref>  Hindley made several appeals against her life sentence, claiming she was a reformed woman and no longer a danger to society, but was never released.  She died in 2002, aged 60.  Brady was diagnosed as a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]] in 1985 and confined in the high-security [[Ashworth Hospital]].  He made it clear that he never wished to be released, and repeatedly asked to be allowed to die.  He died in 2017, at Ashworth, aged 79.\n\nThe murders were the result of what Malcolm MacCulloch, professor of [[forensic psychiatry]] at [[Cardiff University]], called a \"concatenation of circumstances\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=294|ps=none}}  The trial judge, Mr Justice [[Fenton Atkinson]], described Brady and Hindley in his closing remarks as \"two sadistic killers of the utmost depravity\".{{sfnp|Carmichael|2003|p=2|ps=none}} Their crimes were the subject of extensive worldwide media coverage.\n\n==Murders==\n[[File:Yeoman hey and dovestones from hollin brown knoll.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Saddleworth Moor]], viewed from Hollin Brown Knoll.  The bodies of three of the victims were found in this area.|alt=Rolling hills covered in grass]]\n\n===Pauline Reade===\n\nOn 12 July 1963, Brady told Hindley that he wanted to commit a \"perfect murder\".  After work he instructed her to drive a borrowed van around while he followed on his motorcycle; when he spotted a likely victim he would flash his headlight.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=82\u201385|ps=none}}\n\nDriving down Gorton Lane, Brady saw a young girl and signalled Hindley, who did not stop because she recognised the girl as an 8-year-old neighbour of her mother.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=112|ps=none}}  Sometime after 7:30 pm,{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=43|ps=none}} on Froxmer Street, Brady signalled Hindley to stop for 16-year-old Pauline Reade, a schoolmate of Myra's sister Maureen on her way to a dance; Hindley offered Reade a lift.  At various times Hindley gave conflicting statements about the extent to which she, versus Brady, was responsible for Reade being selected as their first victim,{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=110\u201313|ps=none}} but said she felt that there would be less attention given to the disappearance of a teenager than to a missing 8-year-old.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=83|ps=none}}\n\nOnce Reade was in the van, Hindley asked her help in searching Saddleworth Moor for an expensive lost glove; Reade agreed and they drove there.  When Brady arrived on his motorcycle, Hindley told Reade he would be helping in the search.  Hindley later claimed that she waited in the van while Brady took Reade onto the moor.  Brady returned alone after about 30 minutes, and took Hindley to the spot where Reade lay dying; Reade's clothes were in disarray and she had been nearly decapitated{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=114\u201316|ps=none}} by two cuts to the throat, including a four-inch incision across her voice box \"inflicted with considerable force\" and into which the collar of her coat and a throat chain had been pushed.<ref>{{citation|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19880413&id=vThAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=N1kMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4902,3144112|title=Coroner commends police after Moors verdict|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] \u2013 Google News Archive Search|date=13 April 1988|access-date=17 October 2016}}</ref>  When Hindley asked Brady whether he had raped Reade, Brady replied, \"Of course I did.\"  Hindley stayed with Reade while Brady retrieved a spade he had hidden nearby on a previous visit, then returned to the van while Brady buried Reade.  In Brady's account, Hindley was not only present for the attack, but participated in the sexual assault.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|p=115\u201316|ps=none}}\n\n===John Kilbride===\nIn the early evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], Brady and Hindley offered 12-year-old John Kilbride a lift home, saying his parents might worry that he was out so late; they also promised him a bottle of sherry.  Once Kilbride was inside Hindley's hired [[Ford Anglia]] car, Brady said they would have to make a detour to their home for the sherry.  En route he suggested another detour, this time to search for a glove Hindley had lost on the moor.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=130\u2013135|ps=none}}  When they reached the moor Brady took Kilbride with him while Hindley waited in the car; Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and tried to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before strangling him with a shoelace or string.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=90\u201392|ps=none}}\n\n===Keith Bennett===\n[[File:Keith bennett.jpg|right|upright=0.55|thumb|alt=Head and shoulders monochrome photograph of a smiling short-haired young boy wearing spectacles.|Keith Bennett]]\n\nEarly in the evening of 16 June 1964, Hindley asked twelve-year-old Keith Bennett, who was on his way to his grandmother's house in [[Longsight]], Manchester,{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=144\u2013146|ps=none}} for help in loading some boxes into her [[Mini#Variants|Mini Pick-up]], after which she said she would drive him home.  Brady was in the back of the van.  She drove to a [[rest area#United Kingdom|lay-by]] on Saddleworth Moor and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove.  After about 30&nbsp;minutes Brady returned alone, carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier, and, in response to Hindley's questions, said that he had sexually assaulted Bennett and strangled him with a piece of string.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=95\u201396|ps=none}}\n\n===Lesley Ann Downey===\nBrady and Hindley visited a fairground on 26 December 1964 and noticed that 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey was apparently alone.  They approached her and deliberately dropped some shopping they were carrying, then asked her help in taking the packages to their car, and then to their home.  At the house Downey was undressed, gagged, and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string.  Hindley later maintained that she went to fill a bath for Downey and found her dead when she returned; Brady claimed that Hindley killed Downey.  The following morning Brady and Hindley drove Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor,{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=106|ps=none}} and buried her{{mdashb}}naked with her clothes at her feet{{mdashb}}in a shallow grave.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=34|ps=none}}\n\n===Edward Evans===\n[[File:16 wardle brook avenue.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A roadside view of several 20th-century British houses.  The houses are set high above the roadside.  A grass slope is visible to the lower left of the image, and a tall brick wall to the lower right.  A gap in the centre of the image indicates the absence of a single house|The empty plot where 16 Wardle Brook Avenue in [[Hattersley]] once stood.  Manchester City Council decided in 1987 to demolish the house.]]\n\nOn the evening of 6 October 1965, Hindley drove Brady to [[Manchester Central railway station]], where she waited outside in the car whilst he selected a victim.  After a few minutes Brady reappeared in the company of 17-year-old Edward Evans, an apprentice engineer who lived in [[Ardwick]], to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister.  They drove to Brady and Hindley's home at 16 Wardle Brook Avenue, [[Hattersley]], [[Cheshire]], where they relaxed over a bottle of wine.\n\nAt some point Brady sent Hindley to fetch David Smith, the husband of Hindley's younger sister Maureen.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=184\u2013186|ps=none}} The Hindley family had not approved of Maureen's marriage to Smith, who had several criminal convictions, including [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|actual bodily harm]] and housebreaking, the first of which, wounding with intent, occurred when he was 11.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=22|ps=none}}  Throughout the previous year Brady had been cultivating a friendship with Smith, who had become \"in awe\" of Brady, something that increasingly worried Hindley, as she felt it compromised their safety.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=183\u2013184|ps=none}}\n\nHindley returned with Smith and told him to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light.  When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for \"the miniature wine bottles\",{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=184\u2013186|ps=none}} and left him in the kitchen saying that he was going to collect the wine.  Smith later told the police:\n\n{{Quote| I waited about a minute or two then suddenly I heard a hell of a scream; it sounded like a woman, really high-pitched.  Then the screams carried on, one after another really loud.  Then I heard Myra shout, \"Dave, help him,\" very loud.  When I ran in I just stood inside the living room and I saw a young lad.  He was lying with his head and shoulders on the couch and his legs were on the floor.  He was facing upwards.  Ian was standing over him, facing him, with his legs on either side of the young lad's legs.  The lad was still screaming&nbsp;... Ian had a hatchet in his hand&nbsp;... he was holding it above his head and he hit the lad on the left side of his head with the hatchet. I heard the blow, it was a terrible hard blow, it sounded horrible.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=78|ps=none}}}}\n\nSmith then watched Brady throttle Evans with a length of electrical cord.{{sfnp|Williams|1992|p=266|ps=none}}  Brady sprained his ankle in the struggle, and Evans's body was too heavy for Smith to carry to the car on his own, so they wrapped it in plastic sheeting and put it in the spare bedroom.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=186|ps=none}}\n\n==Arrest==\nSmith agreed to return the following morning with his baby\u2019s [[baby transport|pram]], for use in transporting Evans\u2019s body to the car before disposing of it on the moors. He arrived home around 3{{nbsp}}am and asked his wife to make a cup of tea, which he drank before vomiting and telling her what he had witnessed. At 6:10{{nbsp}}am, having waited for daylight and armed himself with a screwdriver and bread knife{{snd}}in case Brady was planning to intercept him{{snd}}Smith called police from a [[phone booth]] on the estate. He was picked up by a police car from the booth and taken to Hyde police station, where he told officers what he had witnessed in the night.{{sfnp|Benfield|1968|pp=150\u20131|ps=none}}\n\nSuperintendent Bob Talbot of the [[Stalybridge]] police division went to 16&nbsp;Wardle Brook Avenue, accompanied by a detective sergeant. Wearing a bread deliveryman's overall on top of his uniform, he asked Myra Hindley at the back door if her husband was home. When she denied that she had a husband or that a man was in the house, Talbot identified himself. Hindley led him into the living room, where Brady was lying on a divan, writing to his employer about his ankle injury.{{sfnp|Benfield|1968|p=151}} Talbot explained that he was investigating \"an act of violence involving guns\" that was reported to have taken place the previous evening.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=120\u2013121|ps=none}}\n\nHindley denied there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house.  When police asked for the key to the locked spare bedroom, Hindley said it was at her workplace; but after police offered to take her to retrieve it, Brady told her to hand it over.  When police returned to the living room they arrested Brady on suspicion of murder.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=120\u2013121|ps=none}}  As Brady was getting dressed, he said \"Eddie and I had a row and the situation got out of hand.\"{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=85|ps=none}}\n\n==Initial investigation==\nThough Hindley was not initially arrested, she demanded to go with Brady to the police station, taking her dog.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=193\u2013194|ps=none}}  She refused to make any statement about Evans's death beyond claiming it had been an accident, and was allowed to go home on the condition that she return the next day.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=122\u2013124|ps=none}} Over the next four days Hindley visited her employer and asked to be dismissed so that she would be eligible for [[unemployment benefits]].  On one of these occasions, Hindley found an envelope belonging to Brady which she burned in an ashtray; she claimed she did not open it but believed it contained plans for bank robberies. On 11 October, she too was arrested and taken into custody, being charged as an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] to the murder of Edward Evans and was remanded at [[Risley (HM Prison)|Risley]].{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=122\u2013124|ps=none}}\n\nPolice searching the house at Wardle Brook Avenue found an old exercise book with the name \"John Kilbride\", which made them suspect that Brady and Hindley had been involved in the disappearances of other youngsters.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=33|ps=none}} Brady told police that he and Evans had fought, but insisted that he and Smith had murdered Evans and that Hindley had \"only done what she had been told\".{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=122|ps=none}} Smith said that Brady had asked him to return anything incriminating, such as \"dodgy books\", which Brady then packed into suitcases; he had no idea what else the suitcases contained or where they might be, though he mentioned that Brady \"had a thing about railway stations\". A search of left-luggage offices turned up the suitcases at [[Manchester Central railway station]] on 15 October;{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=234\u2013235|ps=none}} the claim ticket was later found in Hindley's prayer book.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=107|ps=none}}\n\nInside one of the cases were\u2014among an assortment of costumes, notes, photographs and negatives\u2014nine pornographic photographs taken of Lesley Ann Downey, naked and with a scarf tied across her mouth, and a 16-minute audiotape recording of a girl screaming and pleading for help.{{sfnp|Goodman|1973|p=28|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=35|ps=none}} Downey's mother later confirmed that the recording, too, was of her daughter.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=35\u201336|ps=none}}\n\nOfficers making inquiries at neighbouring houses spoke to 12-year-old Pat Hodges, who had on several occasions been taken to [[Saddleworth Moor]] by Brady and Hindley, and was able to point out their favourite sites along the [[A635 road]].{{sfnp|Goodman|1973|p=27|ps=none}} Police immediately began to search the area, and on 16 October found an arm bone protruding from the peat, which was presumed at first to be Kilbride's, but which the next day was identified as that of Lesley Ann Downey, whose body was still visually identifiable; her mother was able to identify the clothing which had also been buried in the grave.<ref name=\"Times ears covered\">{{citation |title=Two women at 'bodies on moors' trial cover their ears |newspaper=[[The Times]] |url=https://gdc.gale.com/gdc/artemis/NewspapersDetailsPage/NewspapersDetailsWindow?documentId=GALE%7CCS151743131 |publisher=Times Digital Archive |date=27 April 1966 |page=9 |issue=56616 |access-date=12 September 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Myra at John Kilbride's grave.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|alt=A crouched blonde woman in thick jacket, trousers, and boots, holding a small dog.|In this photograph taken by Brady in November 1963, Hindley crouches over John Kilbride's grave on Saddleworth Moor with her dog, Puppet.]]\n\nAlso among the photographs in the suitcase were a number of scenes of the moors. Smith had told police that Brady had boasted of \"photographic proof\" of multiple murders, and officers, struck by Brady's decision to remove the apparently innocent landscapes from the house, appealed to locals for assistance finding locations to match the photographs. On 21 October they found the \"badly decomposed\" body of Kilbride, which had to be identified by clothing.{{sfnp|Goodman|1973|p=28-29|ps=none}} That same day, already being held for the murder of Evans, Brady and Hindley appeared at Hyde Magistrates' Court charged with Downey's murder.

He was regarded by his colleagues as a quiet, punctual, but short-tempered young man. He read books including ''Teach Yourself German'' and ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', as well as works on [[Nazi]] atrocities.

Her parents, Nellie and Bob Hindley (the latter an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]]), beat her regularly when she was a young child.  The family house was in a poor condition and Hindley was forced to sleep in a single bed next to her parents' double.  Their living situation deteriorated further when Hindley's sister, Maureen, was born in August 1946, and about a year later Hindley, then 5, was sent to live with a grandmother nearby.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=39\u201346|ps=none}}\n\nHindley's father had served with the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] and had been stationed in North Africa, Cyprus and Italy during the [[Second World War]].{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=38|ps=none}}  He had been known in the army as a \"hard man\" and he expected his daughter to be equally tough; he taught her to fight and insisted that she \"stick up for herself\".  When Hindley was 8, a local boy scratched her cheeks, drawing blood.  She burst into tears and ran to her father, who threatened to \"leather\" her if she did not retaliate; Hindley found the boy and knocked him down with a series of punches.  As she wrote later, \"at eight years old I'd scored my first victory\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=49\u201350|ps=none}}\nMalcolm MacCulloch, professor of [[forensic psychiatry]] at [[Cardiff University]], has written that Hindley's \"<!--The -->relationship with her father brutalised her&nbsp;...

In 1957, he invited her to go swimming with friends at a local disused reservoir, but Hindley instead went out with another friend; Higgins drowned in the reservoir. Hindley{{mdashb}}a good swimmer{{mdashb}}was deeply upset and blamed herself. She collected for a wreath, and his funeral at [[Gorton Monastery|St Francis's Monastery]] in Gorton Lane\u2014where Hindley had been baptised a Catholic in 1942\u2014had a lasting effect on her.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=7|ps=none}} Hindley's mother had agreed to her father's insistence that Hindley be [[Baptism|baptised]] a Catholic, but only on the condition that she not be sent to a Catholic school; her mother believed that \"all the monks taught was [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|the catechism]]\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=36|ps=none}} Hindley was increasingly drawn to the Catholic Church after she started at Ryder Brow Secondary Modern, and began taking instruction for formal reception into the Church soon after Higgins's funeral. She took the [[confirmation]] name of Veronica<!--Staff page 80 gives the name Therese-->, and received her first [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] in November 1958.\n\nHindley's first job was as a junior clerk at a local electrical engineering firm.

Hindley befriended George Clitheroe, the President of the Cheadle Rifle Club, and on several occasions visited two local shooting ranges. Clitheroe, although puzzled by her interest, arranged for her to buy a .22 rifle from a gun merchant in Manchester. She also asked to join a pistol club, but she was a poor shot and allegedly often bad-tempered, so Clitheroe told her that she was unsuitable; she did though manage to purchase a [[Webley & Scott|Webley]] .45 and a [[Smith & Wesson]] .38 from other members of the club.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=37\u201340|ps=none}} Brady and Hindley's plans for robbery came to nothing, but they became interested in photography. Brady already owned a [[Brownie (camera)|Box Brownie]], which he used to take photographs of Hindley and her dog, Puppet, but he upgraded to a more sophisticated model, and also purchased lights and [[darkroom]] equipment. The pair took photographs of each other that, for the time, would have been considered explicit.

The story tells a fictionalised account of the [[Leopold and Loeb]] case, two young men from well-to-do families who attempt to commit the perfect murder of a 12-year-old boy, and escape the [[death penalty]] because of their age.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=80|ps=none}}\n\nBy June 1963, Brady had moved in with Hindley at her grandmother's house in Bannock Street, and on 12 July 1963, the two murdered their first victim, Reade, who had attended school with Hindley's younger sister, Maureen, and had also been in a short relationship with David Smith, a local boy with three criminal convictions for minor crimes.  Police found no one who had seen Reade before her disappearance, and although the 15-year-old Smith was questioned by police, he was cleared of any involvement in her death.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=41\u201345|ps=none}}  Their next victim, Kilbride, was killed on 23 November 1963.  A huge search was undertaken, with over 700&nbsp;statements taken, and 500&nbsp;\"missing\" posters printed.  Eight days after he failed to return home, 2,000&nbsp;volunteers scoured waste ground and derelict buildings.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=46\u201347|ps=none}}\n\nHindley hired a vehicle a week after Kilbride went missing, and again on 21 December 1963, apparently to make sure the burial sites had not been disturbed.  In February 1964, she bought a second-hand [[Austin Motor Company|Austin Traveller]], but soon after traded it for a [[Mini]] van.  Bennett disappeared on 16 June 1964.  His stepfather, Jimmy Johnson, became a suspect; in the two years following Bennett's disappearance, Johnson was taken for questioning on four occasions.  Detectives searched under the floorboards of the Johnsons' house, and on discovering that the houses in the row were connected, extended the search to the entire street.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=50\u201355|ps=none}}\n\n[[File:David and maureen smith nee hindley.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A young man and woman, in 1960s fashion, stand for a monochrome photograph.

The newlyweds moved into Smith's father's house.  The next day, Brady suggested that the four take a day-trip to [[Windermere]].  This was the first time Brady and Smith had met properly, and Brady was apparently impressed by Smith's demeanour.  The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth, and the possibility of robbing a bank.  The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day had paid for his food and wine.  The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings.  Hindley was apparently jealous of their relationship, but became closer to her sister.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=56\u201358|ps=none}}\n\nIn 1964, Hindley, her grandmother, and Brady were rehoused as part of the post-war slum clearances in Manchester, to 16&nbsp;Wardle Brook Avenue in the new overspill estate of Hattersley.  Brady and Hindley became friendly with Patricia Hodges, an 11-year-old girl who lived at 12&nbsp;Wardle Brook Avenue.  Hodges accompanied the two on their trips to [[Saddleworth Moor]] to collect [[peat]], something that many householders on the new estate did to improve the soil in their gardens, which were full of clay and builder's rubble.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=137|ps=none}}  She remained unharmed; living only a few doors away, her disappearance would have been easily solved.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=62\u201365|ps=none}}\n\nEarly on [[Boxing Day]] 1964, Hindley left her grandmother at a relative's house and refused to allow her back to Wardle Brook Avenue that night.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=65|ps=none}}  On the same day, Downey disappeared from a [[funfair]] in [[Ancoats]].{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=67|ps=none}}  Despite a huge search, she was not found.

The victims were five children\u2014Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans\u2014aged between 10 and 17, at least four of whom were [[Sexual assault|sexually assaulted]].  Two of the victims were discovered in graves dug on [[Saddleworth Moor]]; a third grave was discovered there in 1987, more than twenty years after Brady and Hindley's trial.  Bennett's body is also thought to be buried there, but despite repeated searches it remains undiscovered.\n\nThe pair were charged only in the deaths of Kilbride, Downey and Evans, and received life sentences.  The investigation was reopened in 1985, after Brady was reported as having confessed to the murders of Reade and Bennett.  After confessing to these additional murders, Brady and Hindley were taken separately to Saddleworth Moor to assist in the search for the graves.\n\nCharacterised by the press as \"the most evil woman in Britain\",<ref>{{cite news|title=Hindley: I wish I'd been hanged|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/661139.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|date=29 February 2000 |access-date=11 August 2009}}</ref>  Hindley made several appeals against her life sentence, claiming she was a reformed woman and no longer a danger to society, but was never released.  She died in 2002, aged 60.  Brady was diagnosed as a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]] in 1985 and confined in the high-security [[Ashworth Hospital]].  He made it clear that he never wished to be released, and repeatedly asked to be allowed to die.  He died in 2017, at Ashworth, aged 79.\n\nThe murders were the result of what Malcolm MacCulloch, professor of [[forensic psychiatry]] at [[Cardiff University]], called a \"concatenation of circumstances\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=294|ps=none}}  The trial judge, Mr Justice [[Fenton Atkinson]], described Brady and Hindley in his closing remarks as \"two sadistic killers of the utmost depravity\".{{sfnp|Carmichael|2003|p=2|ps=none}} Their crimes were the subject of extensive worldwide media coverage.\n\n==Murders==\n[[File:Yeoman hey and dovestones from hollin brown knoll.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Saddleworth Moor]], viewed from Hollin Brown Knoll.  The bodies of three of the victims were found in this area.|alt=Rolling hills covered in grass]]\n\n===Pauline Reade===\n\nOn 12 July 1963, Brady told Hindley that he wanted to commit a \"perfect murder\".  After work he instructed her to drive a borrowed van around while he followed on his motorcycle; when he spotted a likely victim he would flash his headlight.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=82\u201385|ps=none}}\n\nDriving down Gorton Lane, Brady saw a young girl and signalled Hindley, who did not stop because she recognised the girl as an 8-year-old neighbour of her mother.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=112|ps=none}}  Sometime after 7:30 pm,{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=43|ps=none}} on Froxmer Street, Brady signalled Hindley to stop for 16-year-old Pauline Reade, a schoolmate of Myra's sister Maureen on her way to a dance; Hindley offered Reade a lift.  At various times Hindley gave conflicting statements about the extent to which she, versus Brady, was responsible for Reade being selected as their first victim,{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=110\u201313|ps=none}} but said she felt that there would be less attention given to the disappearance of a teenager than to a missing 8-year-old.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=83|ps=none}}\n\nOnce Reade was in the van, Hindley asked her help in searching Saddleworth Moor for an expensive lost glove; Reade agreed and they drove there.  When Brady arrived on his motorcycle, Hindley told Reade he would be helping in the search.  Hindley later claimed that she waited in the van while Brady took Reade onto the moor.  Brady returned alone after about 30 minutes, and took Hindley to the spot where Reade lay dying; Reade's clothes were in disarray and she had been nearly decapitated{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=114\u201316|ps=none}} by two cuts to the throat, including a four-inch incision across her voice box \"inflicted with considerable force\" and into which the collar of her coat and a throat chain had been pushed.<ref>{{citation|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19880413&id=vThAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=N1kMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4902,3144112|title=Coroner commends police after Moors verdict|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] \u2013 Google News Archive Search|date=13 April 1988|access-date=17 October 2016}}</ref>  When Hindley asked Brady whether he had raped Reade, Brady replied, \"Of course I did.\"  Hindley stayed with Reade while Brady retrieved a spade he had hidden nearby on a previous visit, then returned to the van while Brady buried Reade.  In Brady's account, Hindley was not only present for the attack, but participated in the sexual assault.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|p=115\u201316|ps=none}}\n\n===John Kilbride===\nIn the early evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], Brady and Hindley offered 12-year-old John Kilbride a lift home, saying his parents might worry that he was out so late; they also promised him a bottle of sherry.  Once Kilbride was inside Hindley's hired [[Ford Anglia]] car, Brady said they would have to make a detour to their home for the sherry.  En route he suggested another detour, this time to search for a glove Hindley had lost on the moor.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=130\u2013135|ps=none}}  When they reached the moor Brady took Kilbride with him while Hindley waited in the car; Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and tried to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before strangling him with a shoelace or string.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=90\u201392|ps=none}}\n\n===Keith Bennett===\n[[File:Keith bennett.jpg|right|upright=0.55|thumb|alt=Head and shoulders monochrome photograph of a smiling short-haired young boy wearing spectacles.|Keith Bennett]]\n\nEarly in the evening of 16 June 1964, Hindley asked twelve-year-old Keith Bennett, who was on his way to his grandmother's house in [[Longsight]], Manchester,{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=144\u2013146|ps=none}} for help in loading some boxes into her [[Mini#Variants|Mini Pick-up]], after which she said she would drive him home.  Brady was in the back of the van.  She drove to a [[rest area#United Kingdom|lay-by]] on Saddleworth Moor and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove.  After about 30&nbsp;minutes Brady returned alone, carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier, and, in response to Hindley's questions, said that he had sexually assaulted Bennett and strangled him with a piece of string.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=95\u201396|ps=none}}\n\n===Lesley Ann Downey===\nBrady and Hindley visited a fairground on 26 December 1964 and noticed that 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey was apparently alone.  They approached her and deliberately dropped some shopping they were carrying, then asked her help in taking the packages to their car, and then to their home.  At the house Downey was undressed, gagged, and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string.  Hindley later maintained that she went to fill a bath for Downey and found her dead when she returned; Brady claimed that Hindley killed Downey.  The following morning Brady and Hindley drove Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor,{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=106|ps=none}} and buried her{{mdashb}}naked with her clothes at her feet{{mdashb}}in a shallow grave.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=34|ps=none}}\n\n===Edward Evans===\n[[File:16 wardle brook avenue.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A roadside view of several 20th-century British houses.

A gap in the centre of the image indicates the absence of a single house|The empty plot where 16 Wardle Brook Avenue in [[Hattersley]] once stood.  Manchester City Council decided in 1987 to demolish the house.]]\n\nOn the evening of 6 October 1965, Hindley drove Brady to [[Manchester Central railway station]], where she waited outside in the car whilst he selected a victim.  After a few minutes Brady reappeared in the company of 17-year-old Edward Evans, an apprentice engineer who lived in [[Ardwick]], to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister.  They drove to Brady and Hindley's home at 16 Wardle Brook Avenue, [[Hattersley]], [[Cheshire]], where they relaxed over a bottle of wine.\n\nAt some point Brady sent Hindley to fetch David Smith, the husband of Hindley's younger sister Maureen.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=184\u2013186|ps=none}} The Hindley family had not approved of Maureen's marriage to Smith, who had several criminal convictions, including [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|actual bodily harm]] and housebreaking, the first of which, wounding with intent, occurred when he was 11.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=22|ps=none}}  Throughout the previous year Brady had been cultivating a friendship with Smith, who had become \"in awe\" of Brady, something that increasingly worried Hindley, as she felt it compromised their safety.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=183\u2013184|ps=none}}\n\nHindley returned with Smith and told him to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light.  When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for \"the miniature wine bottles\",{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=184\u2013186|ps=none}} and left him in the kitchen saying that he was going to collect the wine.  Smith later told the police:\n\n{{Quote| I waited about a minute or two then suddenly I heard a hell of a scream; it sounded like a woman, really high-pitched.  Then the screams carried on, one after another really loud.  Then I heard Myra shout, \"Dave, help him,\" very loud.  When I ran in I just stood inside the living room and I saw a young lad.  He was lying with his head and shoulders on the couch and his legs were on the floor.  He was facing upwards.  Ian was standing over him, facing him, with his legs on either side of the young lad's legs.  The lad was still screaming&nbsp;... Ian had a hatchet in his hand&nbsp;... he was holding it above his head and he hit the lad on the left side of his head with the hatchet. I heard the blow, it was a terrible hard blow, it sounded horrible.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=78|ps=none}}}}\n\nSmith then watched Brady throttle Evans with a length of electrical cord.{{sfnp|Williams|1992|p=266|ps=none}}  Brady sprained his ankle in the struggle, and Evans's body was too heavy for Smith to carry to the car on his own, so they wrapped it in plastic sheeting and put it in the spare bedroom.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=186|ps=none}}\n\n==Arrest==\nSmith agreed to return the following morning with his baby\u2019s [[baby transport|pram]], for use in transporting Evans\u2019s body to the car before disposing of it on the moors. He arrived home around 3{{nbsp}}am and asked his wife to make a cup of tea, which he drank before vomiting and telling her what he had witnessed. At 6:10{{nbsp}}am, having waited for daylight and armed himself with a screwdriver and bread knife{{snd}}in case Brady was planning to intercept him{{snd}}Smith called police from a [[phone booth]] on the estate. He was picked up by a police car from the booth and taken to Hyde police station, where he told officers what he had witnessed in the night.{{sfnp|Benfield|1968|pp=150\u20131|ps=none}}\n\nSuperintendent Bob Talbot of the [[Stalybridge]] police division went to 16&nbsp;Wardle Brook Avenue, accompanied by a detective sergeant. Wearing a bread deliveryman's overall on top of his uniform, he asked Myra Hindley at the back door if her husband was home. When she denied that she had a husband or that a man was in the house, Talbot identified himself. Hindley led him into the living room, where Brady was lying on a divan, writing to his employer about his ankle injury.{{sfnp|Benfield|1968|p=151}} Talbot explained that he was investigating \"an act of violence involving guns\" that was reported to have taken place the previous evening.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=120\u2013121|ps=none}}\n\nHindley denied there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house.  When police asked for the key to the locked spare bedroom, Hindley said it was at her workplace; but after police offered to take her to retrieve it, Brady told her to hand it over.  When police returned to the living room they arrested Brady on suspicion of murder.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=120\u2013121|ps=none}}  As Brady was getting dressed, he said \"Eddie and I had a row and the situation got out of hand.\"{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=85|ps=none}}\n\n==Initial investigation==\nThough Hindley was not initially arrested, she demanded to go with Brady to the police station, taking her dog.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=193\u2013194|ps=none}}  She refused to make any statement about Evans's death beyond claiming it had been an accident, and was allowed to go home on the condition that she return the next day.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=122\u2013124|ps=none}} Over the next four days Hindley visited her employer and asked to be dismissed so that she would be eligible for [[unemployment benefits]].

Stewart had little support, and after a few months was forced to give her son into the care of Mary and John Sloan, a local couple with four children of their own. Brady took their name, and became known as Ian Sloan. His mother continued to visit him throughout his childhood.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=17\u201319|ps=none}}  Various authors have stated that he [[zoosadism|tortured animals]], although Brady objected to such accusations.{{sfnp|Cowley|2011|p=28|ps=none}}  Aged nine, he visited [[Loch Lomond]] with his family, where he reportedly discovered an affinity for the outdoors, and a few months later the family moved to a new [[council house]] on an [[overspill estate]] at [[Pollok]].  He was accepted for [[Shawlands Academy]], a school for above-average pupils.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=19\u201320|ps=none}}\n\nAt Shawlands his behaviour worsened; as a teenager he twice appeared before a juvenile court for housebreaking. He left the academy aged 15, and took a job as a tea boy at a [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyard in [[Govan]]. Nine months later, he began working as a butcher's messenger boy. He had a girlfriend, Evelyn Grant, but their relationship ended when he threatened her with a [[flick knife]] after she visited a dance with another boy. He again appeared before the court, this time with nine charges against him,{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=20\u201321|ps=none}} and shortly before his 17th birthday he was placed on probation, on condition that he live with his mother.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=24|ps=none}} By then, she had moved to Manchester and married an Irish fruit merchant named Patrick Brady; Patrick Brady got Ian a job as a fruit porter at Smithfield Market, and Ian took Patrick Brady's surname.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=122|ps=none}}\n\nWithin a year of moving to Manchester, Brady was caught with a sack full of lead seals he had stolen and was trying to smuggle out of the market.

He was regarded by his colleagues as a quiet, punctual, but short-tempered young man. He read books including ''Teach Yourself German'' and ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', as well as works on [[Nazi]] atrocities.

Her parents, Nellie and Bob Hindley (the latter an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]]), beat her regularly when she was a young child.  The family house was in a poor condition and Hindley was forced to sleep in a single bed next to her parents' double.  Their living situation deteriorated further when Hindley's sister, Maureen, was born in August 1946, and about a year later Hindley, then 5, was sent to live with a grandmother nearby.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=39\u201346|ps=none}}\n\nHindley's father had served with the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] and had been stationed in North Africa, Cyprus and Italy during the [[Second World War]].{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=38|ps=none}}  He had been known in the army as a \"hard man\" and he expected his daughter to be equally tough; he taught her to fight and insisted that she \"stick up for herself\".  When Hindley was 8, a local boy scratched her cheeks, drawing blood.  She burst into tears and ran to her father, who threatened to \"leather\" her if she did not retaliate; Hindley found the boy and knocked him down with a series of punches.  As she wrote later, \"at eight years old I'd scored my first victory\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=49\u201350|ps=none}}\nMalcolm MacCulloch, professor of [[forensic psychiatry]] at [[Cardiff University]], has written that Hindley's \"<!--The -->relationship with her father brutalised her&nbsp;...

In 1957, he invited her to go swimming with friends at a local disused reservoir, but Hindley instead went out with another friend; Higgins drowned in the reservoir. Hindley{{mdashb}}a good swimmer{{mdashb}}was deeply upset and blamed herself. She collected for a wreath, and his funeral at [[Gorton Monastery|St Francis's Monastery]] in Gorton Lane\u2014where Hindley had been baptised a Catholic in 1942\u2014had a lasting effect on her.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=7|ps=none}} Hindley's mother had agreed to her father's insistence that Hindley be [[Baptism|baptised]] a Catholic, but only on the condition that she not be sent to a Catholic school; her mother believed that \"all the monks taught was [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|the catechism]]\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=36|ps=none}} Hindley was increasingly drawn to the Catholic Church after she started at Ryder Brow Secondary Modern, and began taking instruction for formal reception into the Church soon after Higgins's funeral. She took the [[confirmation]] name of Veronica<!--Staff page 80 gives the name Therese-->, and received her first [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] in November 1958.\n\nHindley's first job was as a junior clerk at a local electrical engineering firm. She ran errands, made tea, and typed, and was well liked enough that when she lost her first week's wage packet the other girls took up a collection to replace it.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=8|ps=none}} At 17 she became engaged after a short courtship, but called it off several months later after deciding the young man was immature and unable to provide her with the life she wanted.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=12\u201313|ps=none}} She took weekly [[judo]] lessons at a local school but found partners reluctant to train with her, as she was often slow to release her grip.

Hindley befriended George Clitheroe, the President of the Cheadle Rifle Club, and on several occasions visited two local shooting ranges. Clitheroe, although puzzled by her interest, arranged for her to buy a .22 rifle from a gun merchant in Manchester. She also asked to join a pistol club, but she was a poor shot and allegedly often bad-tempered, so Clitheroe told her that she was unsuitable; she did though manage to purchase a [[Webley & Scott|Webley]] .45 and a [[Smith & Wesson]] .38 from other members of the club.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=37\u201340|ps=none}} Brady and Hindley's plans for robbery came to nothing, but they became interested in photography. Brady already owned a [[Brownie (camera)|Box Brownie]], which he used to take photographs of Hindley and her dog, Puppet, but he upgraded to a more sophisticated model, and also purchased lights and [[darkroom]] equipment. The pair took photographs of each other that, for the time, would have been considered explicit.

The story tells a fictionalised account of the [[Leopold and Loeb]] case, two young men from well-to-do families who attempt to commit the perfect murder of a 12-year-old boy, and escape the [[death penalty]] because of their age.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=80|ps=none}}\n\nBy June 1963, Brady had moved in with Hindley at her grandmother's house in Bannock Street, and on 12 July 1963, the two murdered their first victim, Reade, who had attended school with Hindley's younger sister, Maureen, and had also been in a short relationship with David Smith, a local boy with three criminal convictions for minor crimes.  Police found no one who had seen Reade before her disappearance, and although the 15-year-old Smith was questioned by police, he was cleared of any involvement in her death.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=41\u201345|ps=none}}  Their next victim, Kilbride, was killed on 23 November 1963.  A huge search was undertaken, with over 700&nbsp;statements taken, and 500&nbsp;\"missing\" posters printed.  Eight days after he failed to return home, 2,000&nbsp;volunteers scoured waste ground and derelict buildings.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=46\u201347|ps=none}}\n\nHindley hired a vehicle a week after Kilbride went missing, and again on 21 December 1963, apparently to make sure the burial sites had not been disturbed.  In February 1964, she bought a second-hand [[Austin Motor Company|Austin Traveller]], but soon after traded it for a [[Mini]] van.  Bennett disappeared on 16 June 1964.  His stepfather, Jimmy Johnson, became a suspect; in the two years following Bennett's disappearance, Johnson was taken for questioning on four occasions.  Detectives searched under the floorboards of the Johnsons' house, and on discovering that the houses in the row were connected, extended the search to the entire street.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=50\u201355|ps=none}}\n\n[[File:David and maureen smith nee hindley.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A young man and woman, in 1960s fashion, stand for a monochrome photograph.

None of Hindley's relatives attended; Myra did not approve of the marriage, and her mother was too embarrassed\u2014Maureen was seven months pregnant.  The newlyweds moved into Smith's father's house.  The next day, Brady suggested that the four take a day-trip to [[Windermere]].  This was the first time Brady and Smith had met properly, and Brady was apparently impressed by Smith's demeanour.  The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth, and the possibility of robbing a bank.  The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day had paid for his food and wine.  The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings.  Hindley was apparently jealous of their relationship, but became closer to her sister.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=56\u201358|ps=none}}\n\nIn 1964, Hindley, her grandmother, and Brady were rehoused as part of the post-war slum clearances in Manchester, to 16&nbsp;Wardle Brook Avenue in the new overspill estate of Hattersley.  Brady and Hindley became friendly with Patricia Hodges, an 11-year-old girl who lived at 12&nbsp;Wardle Brook Avenue.  Hodges accompanied the two on their trips to [[Saddleworth Moor]] to collect [[peat]], something that many householders on the new estate did to improve the soil in their gardens, which were full of clay and builder's rubble.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=137|ps=none}}  She remained unharmed; living only a few doors away, her disappearance would have been easily solved.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=62\u201365|ps=none}}\n\nEarly on [[Boxing Day]] 1964, Hindley left her grandmother at a relative's house and refused to allow her back to Wardle Brook Avenue that night.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=65|ps=none}}  On the same day, Downey disappeared from a [[funfair]] in [[Ancoats]].{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=67|ps=none}}  Despite a huge search, she was not found.
