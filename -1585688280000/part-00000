The dynasty was founded by [[Emperor Taizu of Song]] following his usurpation of the throne of the [[Later Zhou]], ending the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. The Song often came into conflict with the contemporaneous [[Liao dynasty|Liao]], [[Western Xia]] and [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] dynasties to its north. It was eventually conquered by the [[Mongols|Mongol]]-led [[Yuan dynasty]]. The Song government was the first in world history to issue [[banknote]]s or true paper money nationally and the first Chinese government to establish [[Naval history of China|a permanent standing navy]]. This dynasty also saw the first known use of [[gunpowder]], as well as the first discernment of [[true north]] using a [[compass]].\n\nThe Song dynasty is divided into two distinct periods: Northern Song and Southern Song. During the [[#Northern Song, 960\u20131127|Northern Song]] ({{zh |c = \u5317\u5b8b}}; 960\u20131127), the Song capital was in the northern city of [[Kaifeng|Bianjing]] (now [[Kaifeng]]) and the dynasty controlled most of what is now Eastern China. The [[#Southern Song, 1127\u20131279|Southern Song]] ({{zh |c = \u5357\u5b8b}}; 1127\u20131279) refers to the period after the Song lost control of its northern half to the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-led Jin dynasty in the [[Jin\u2013Song Wars]]. During this time, the Song court retreated south of the [[Yangtze]] and established its capital at Lin'an (now [[Hangzhou]]). Although the Song dynasty had lost control of the traditional \"birthplace of Chinese civilization\" along the [[Yellow River]], the Song economy was still strong, as the Southern Song empire contained a large population and productive agricultural land. The Southern Song dynasty considerably bolstered its naval strength to defend its waters and land borders and to conduct [[Ancient maritime history#China|maritime]] missions abroad. To repel the Jin, and later the Mongols, the Song developed revolutionary new military technology augmented by the use of gunpowder. In 1234, the Jin dynasty was conquered by the Mongols, who took control of northern China, maintaining uneasy relations with the Southern Song. [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]], the fourth [[Khagan|Great Khan]] of the [[Mongol Empire]], died in 1259 while besieging the mountain castle [[Diaoyucheng]], [[Chongqing]]. His younger brother [[Kublai Khan]] was proclaimed the new Great Khan, though his claim was only partially recognized by the Mongols in the west. In 1271, Kublai Khan proclaimed himself [[Emperor of China]] and established the Yuan dynasty.{{sfn|Rossabi|1988|p=115}} After two decades of sporadic warfare, Kublai Khan's armies [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|conquered the Song dynasty]] in 1279, after the Southern Song suffered military defeat in the [[Battle of Yamen]]. The [[Mongol invasion of China|Mongol invasion]] eventually led to a Chinese reunification under the Yuan dynasty.{{sfn|Rossabi|1988|p=76}}\n\nThe population of China doubled in size during the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries. This growth was made possible by expanded rice cultivation in central and southern Song, the use of early-ripening rice from south-east and southern Asia, and the production of widespread food surpluses.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=156}}{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=96}} The Northern Song census recorded 20 million households, double of the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties.

The expansion of the population, growth of cities, and the emergence of a national economy led to the gradual withdrawal of the central government from direct involvement in economic affairs. The [[Chinese gentry|lower gentry]] assumed a larger role in grassroots administration and local affairs. Appointed officials in county and provincial centers relied upon the scholarly gentry for their services, sponsorship, and local supervision.\n\nSocial life during the Song was vibrant. Citizens gathered to view and trade precious artworks, the populace intermingled at public festivals and private clubs, and cities had lively entertainment quarters. The spread of literature and knowledge was enhanced by the rapid expansion of [[woodblock printing]] and the 11th-century invention of [[movable type|movable-type]] printing. Technology, science, philosophy, mathematics, and engineering flourished over the course of the Song. Philosophers such as [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] and [[Zhu Xi]] reinvigorated [[Confucianism]] with new commentary, infused with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ideals, and emphasized a new organization of classic texts that brought out the core doctrine of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. Although the institution of the [[Imperial examination|civil service examinations]] had existed since the [[Sui dynasty]], it became much more prominent in the Song period. The officials who gained power by succeeding in the imperial examination became a leading factor in the shift from a [[Chinese nobility|military-aristocratic]] elite to a [[scholar-official|scholar-bureaucratic]] elite.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Song dynasty}}\n{{Further|List of emperors of the Song dynasty}}\n\n=== Northern Song, 960\u20131127 ===\n{{Main|Northern Song Dynasty}}\n\n[[File:Song Taizu.jpg|alt=Painted image of a portly man sitting in a red throne-chair with dragon-head decorations, wearing white silk robes, black shoes, and a black hat, and sporting a black moustache and goatee.|thumb|left|upright|[[Emperor Taizu of Song]] (r.&nbsp;960\u2013976), a court portrait painting]]\n\nAfter usurping the throne of the [[Later Zhou dynasty]], [[Emperor Taizu of Song]] (r. 960\u2013976) spent sixteen years [[History of the Song dynasty|conquering the rest of China]], reuniting much of the territory that had once belonged to the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] empires and ending the upheaval of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]].{{sfn|Lorge|2015|pp=4\u20135}} In [[Kaifeng]], he established a strong central government over the great empire.

From its inception under Taizu, the Song dynasty alternated between warfare and diplomacy with the ethnic [[Khitan people|Khitans]] of the [[Liao dynasty]] in the northeast and with the [[Tangut people|Tanguts]] of the [[Western Xia]] in the northwest. The Song dynasty used military force in an attempt to quell the Liao dynasty and to recapture the [[Sixteen Prefectures]], a territory under Khitan control since 938 that was traditionally considered to be part of [[China proper]] (Most parts of today's [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]]).{{sfn|Mote|1999|p=69}} Song forces were repulsed by the Liao forces, who engaged in aggressive yearly campaigns into Northern Song territory until 1005, when the signing of the [[Shanyuan Treaty]] ended these northern border clashes. The Song were forced to provide tribute to the Khitans, although this did little damage to the Song economy since the Khitans were economically dependent upon importing massive amounts of goods from the Song.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=154}} More significantly, the Song state recognized the Liao state as its diplomatic equal.{{sfn|Mote|1999|pp=70\u201371}} The Song created an extensive defensive forest along the Song-Liao border to thwart potential Khitan cavalry attacks.{{sfn|Chen|2018}}\n\n[[File:Taizong of Song.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=A man in heavy white robes, wearing a black hat with long horizontal protrusions coming from the bottom of the hat.|A portrait of [[Emperor Taizong of Song]] (r.&nbsp;976\u2013997), [[National Palace Museum]], Taipei]]\nThe Song dynasty managed to win several military victories over the Tanguts in the early 11th century, culminating in a campaign led by the polymath scientist, general, and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] (1031\u20131095).{{sfn|Sivin|1995|p=8}} However, this campaign was ultimately a failure due to a rival military officer of Shen disobeying direct orders, and the territory gained from the Western Xia was eventually lost.{{sfn|Sivin|1995|p=9}} There was also a [[L\u00fd\u2013Song War|significant war]] fought against the [[L\u00fd dynasty]] of [[Vietnam]] from 1075 to 1077 over a border dispute and the Song's severing of commercial relations with the [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]] kingdom.{{sfn|Anderson|2008|p=207}} After L\u00fd forces inflicted heavy damages in a raid on [[Guangxi]], the Song commander Guo Kui (1022\u20131088) penetrated as far as Th\u0103ng Long (modern [[Hanoi]]).{{sfn|Anderson|2008|p=208}} Heavy losses on both sides prompted the L\u00fd commander Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t (1019\u20131105) to make peace overtures, allowing both sides to withdraw from the war effort; captured territories held by both Song and L\u00fd were mutually exchanged in 1082, along with prisoners of war.{{sfn|Anderson|2008|pp=208\u2013209}}\n\n[[File:Song-Bodhisattva1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|A wooden Bodhisattva from the Song dynasty (960\u20131279).]]\nDuring the 11th century, political rivalries divided members of the court due to the ministers' differing approaches, opinions, and policies regarding the handling of the Song's complex society and thriving economy. The idealist [[Chancellor (China)|Chancellor]], [[Fan Zhongyan]] (989\u20131052), was the first to receive a heated political backlash when he attempted to institute the [[Qingli Reforms]], which included measures such as improving the recruitment system of officials, increasing the salaries for minor officials, and establishing sponsorship programs to allow a wider range of people to be well educated and eligible for state service.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=163}}\n\nAfter Fan was forced to step down from his office, [[Wang Anshi]] (1021\u20131086) became Chancellor of the imperial court. With the backing of [[Emperor Shenzong of Song|Emperor Shenzong]] (1067\u20131085), Wang Anshi severely criticized the educational system and state bureaucracy. Seeking to resolve what he saw as state corruption and negligence, Wang implemented a series of reforms called the [[New Policies (Song dynasty)|New Policies]]. These involved [[land value tax]] reform, the establishment of several government [[monopoly|monopolies]], the support of local [[militia]]s, and the creation of higher standards for the Imperial examination to make it more practical for men skilled in statecraft to pass.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=164}}\n\nThe reforms created political factions in the court. Wang Anshi's \"New Policies Group\" (''Xin Fa''), also known as the \"Reformers\", were opposed by the ministers in the \"Conservative\" faction led by the historian and Chancellor [[Sima Guang]] (1019\u20131086).{{sfn|Sivin|1995|pp=3\u20134}} As one faction supplanted another in the majority position of the court ministers, it would demote rival officials and exile them to govern remote frontier regions of the empire.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=164}} One of the prominent victims of the political rivalry, the famous poet and statesman [[Su Shi]] (1037\u20131101), was jailed and eventually exiled for criticizing Wang's reforms.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=164}}\n\nWhile the central Song court remained politically divided and focused upon its internal affairs, alarming new events to the north in the Liao state finally came to its attention. The [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]], a subject tribe of the Liao, rebelled against them and formed their own state, the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=165}} The Song official [[Tong Guan]] (1054\u20131126) advised [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Huizong]] (1100\u20131125) to form an alliance with the Jurchens, and the joint military campaign under this [[Alliance Conducted at Sea]] toppled and completely conquered the Liao dynasty by 1125. During the joint attack, the Song's northern expedition army removed the defensive forest along the Song-Liao border.{{sfn|Chen|2018}}\n\n[[Image:Liao Dynasty - Guan Yin statue.jpg|alt=A wooden carving of a sitting Buddhist figure in loose fitting, painted robes.|thumb|left|upright=0.7|A [[Liao dynasty]] [[polychrome]] wood-carved [[statue]] of [[Guan Yin]], [[Shanxi Province]], China, (907\u20131125)]]\nHowever, the poor performance and military weakness of the Song army was observed by the Jurchens, who immediately broke the alliance, beginning the [[Jin\u2013Song Wars]] of 1125 and 1127. Because of the removal of the previous defensive forest, the Jin army marched quickly across the North China Plain to Kaifeng.{{sfn|Chen|2018}} In the [[Jingkang Incident]] during the latter invasion, the Jurchens captured not only the capital, but the retired emperor Huizong, his successor [[Emperor Qinzong of Song|Emperor Qinzong]], and most of the Imperial court.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=165}}\n\nThe remaining Song forces regrouped under the self-proclaimed [[Emperor Gaozong of Song]] (1127\u20131162) and withdrew south of the [[Yangtze]] to establish a new capital at Lin'an (modern [[Hangzhou]]). The Jurchen conquest of [[North China]] and shift of capitals from Kaifeng to Lin'an was the dividing line between the Northern and [[#Southern Song, 1127\u20131279|Southern Song]] dynasties.\n\nAfter their fall to the Jin, the Song lost control of North China. Now occupying what has been traditionally known as \"China Proper,\" the Jin regarded themselves the rightful rulers of China. The Jin later chose earth as their dynastic element and yellow as their royal color. According to the theory of the [[Wu Xing|Five Elements]] (wuxing), the earth element follows the fire, the dynastic element of the Song, in the sequence of elemental creation. Therefore, their ideological move showed that the Jin considered Song reign in China complete, with the Jin replacing the Song as the rightful rulers of China Proper.{{sfn|Chen|2014}}\n\n===Southern Song, 1127\u20131279===\n[[File:Gaozong Of Song.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=A man in heavy white robes, wearing a black hat with long horizontal protrusions coming from the bottom of the hat.|A portrait of [[Emperor Gaozong of Song]] (r.&nbsp;1127\u20131162), [[National Palace Museum]], Taipei]]\n[[File:China - Southern Song Dynasty-en.svg|left|upright=1.15|thumb|Southern Song in 1142.

Selecting men for office through proven merit [[Xiaolian|was an ancient idea in China]]. The civil service system became institutionalized on a small scale during the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties, but by the Song period it became virtually the only means for drafting officials into the government.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|pp=145\u2013146}} The advent of widespread [[printing]] helped to widely circulate Confucian teachings and to educate more and more eligible candidates for the exams.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=147}} This can be seen in the number of exam takers for the low-level prefectural exams rising from 30,000 annual candidates in the early 11th century to 400,000 candidates by the late 13th century.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=147}} The civil service and examination system allowed for greater [[meritocracy]], [[social mobility]], and equality in competition for those wishing to attain an official seat in government.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=162}} Using statistics gathered by the Song state, Edward A.

Yet Su was a product of his times, as the identity, habits, and attitudes of the [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-official]] had become less [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]ic and more [[bureaucrat]]ic with the transition of the periods from Tang to Song.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=159}} At the beginning of the dynasty, government posts were disproportionately held by two elite social groups: a founding elite who had ties with the founding emperor and a semi-hereditary professional elite who used long-held clan status, [[Chinese kinship|family connections]], and marriage alliances to secure appointments.{{sfn|Hartwell|1982|pp=405\u2013413}} By the late 11th century, the founding elite became obsolete, while political partisanship and factionalism at court undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which dissolved as a distinguishable social group and was replaced by a multitude of gentry families.{{sfn|Hartwell|1982|pp=416\u2013420}}\n\n[[File:Wuxi Donglin Shuyuan 2015.04.24 16-10-51.jpg|thumb|The [[Donglin Academy]], an educational institution equivalent to modern-day college.

The imperial army was divided among three marshals, each independently responsible to the Emperor. Since the Emperor rarely led campaigns personally, Song forces lacked unity of command.{{sfn|Bai|2002|pp=239}} The imperial court often believed that successful generals endangered royal authority, and relieved or even executed them (notably Li Gang,{{sfn|Bai|2002|pp=250}} [[Yue Fei]], and [[Han Shizhong]]{{sfn|Bai|2002|p=254}}).\n[[File:Northern song Cavalry.jpg|thumb|Armoured Song cavalry]]\n\nAlthough the scholar-officials viewed [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|military soldiers]] as lower members in the hierarchic social order,{{sfn|Graff|Higham|2002|pp=25\u201326}} a person could gain status and prestige in society by becoming a high-ranking military officer with a record of victorious battles.{{sfn|Lorge|2005|p=43}} At its height, the Song military had one million soldiers{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=164}} divided into [[platoon]]s of 50 troops, companies made of two platoons, battalions composed of 500 soldiers.{{sfn|Lorge|2005|p=45}}{{sfn|Peers|2006|p=130}} [[Crossbow]]men were separated from the regular infantry and placed in their own units as they were prized combatants, providing effective missile fire against cavalry charges.{{sfn|Peers|2006|p=130}} The government was eager to sponsor new crossbow designs that could shoot at longer ranges, while crossbowmen were also valuable when employed as long-range [[sniper]]s.{{sfn|Peers|2006|pp=130\u2013131}} Song cavalry employed a slew of different weapons, including halberds, swords, bows, spears, and '[[fire lance]]s' that discharged a gunpowder blast of flame and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]].{{sfn|Peers|2006|p=131}} The Song dynasty did not possess much in the way of warhorses.

To supplement their cavalry, the Song bought every year ten to forty thousand horses from the northwest and southwest borderlands.{{sfn|Chaffee|2015|p=235}}\nDue to the lack of their own cavalry forces, the Song army usually had to rely on anti-cavalry infantry equipped with \"horse-butchering sabres\", large axes, and crossbows to overcome the [[Khitans]] and [[Jurchens]].{{sfn|Chaffee|2015|p=242}}\n\n[[File:Dingzhou Liaodi Pagoda 4.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Liaodi Pagoda]], the tallest pre-modern [[Chinese pagoda]], built in 1055; it was intended as a [[Buddhist architecture|Buddhist religious structure]], yet served a military purpose as a [[watchtower]] for [[reconnaissance]].{{sfn|Cai|2011|pp=81\u201382}}]]\n\nMilitary strategy and military training were treated as sciences that could be studied and perfected; soldiers were tested in their skills of using weaponry and in their athletic ability.{{sfn|Peers|2006|p=129}} The troops were trained to follow signal standards to advance at the waving of banners and to halt at the sound of bells and drums.{{sfn|Peers|2006|p=130}}\n\nThe Song navy was of great importance during the consolidation of the empire in the 10th century; during the war against the [[Southern Tang]] state the Song navy employed tactics such as defending large floating [[pontoon bridge]]s across the [[Yangtze River]] in order to secure movements of troops and supplies.{{sfn|Graff|Higham|2002|p=87}} There were large ships in the Song navy that could carry 1,000 soldiers aboard their decks,{{sfn|Graff|Higham|2002|pp=86\u201387}} while the swift-moving [[Paddle steamer|paddle-wheel craft]] were viewed as essential fighting ships in any successful naval battle.{{sfn|Graff|Higham|2002|pp=86\u201387}}{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=422}}\n\nIn a battle on January 23, 971, massive arrow fire from Song dynasty crossbowmen decimated the [[war elephant]] corps of the [[Southern Han]] army.{{sfn|Schafer|1957|p=291}} This defeat not only marked the eventual submission of the Southern Han to the Song dynasty, but also the last instance where a war elephant corps was employed as a regular division within a Chinese army.{{sfn|Schafer|1957|p=291}}\n\nThere was a total of 347 military treatises written during the Song period, as listed by the history text of the ''Song Shi'' (compiled in 1345).{{sfn|Needham|1986e|p=19}} However, only a handful of these military treatises have survived, which includes the ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' written in 1044.

Although his writings were not accepted by his contemporary peers, Zhu's commentary and emphasis upon the Confucian classics of the [[Four Books]] as an introductory corpus to Confucian learning formed the basis of the Neo-Confucian doctrine. By the year 1241, under the sponsorship of [[Emperor Lizong of Song|Emperor Lizong]], Zhu Xi's Four Books and his commentary on them became standard requirements of study for students attempting to pass the civil service examinations.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=169}} The East Asian countries of [[Japan]] and [[Korea]] also adopted Zhu Xi's teaching, known as the Shushigaku (\u6731\u5b50\u5b78, School of Zhu Xi) of Japan, and in Korea the Jujahak (\uc8fc\uc790\ud559). Buddhism's continuing influence can be seen in painted artwork such as [[Lin Tinggui]]'s ''[[Arhat|Luohan]] Laundering''. However, the ideology was highly criticized and even scorned by some. The statesman and historian [[Ouyang Xiu]] (1007\u20131072) called the religion a \"curse\" that could only be remedied by uprooting it from [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]] and replacing it with Confucian discourse.{{sfn|Wright|1959|pp=88\u201389}} A true revival of Buddhism in Chinese society would not occur until the Mongol rule of the Yuan dynasty, with Kublai Khan's sponsorship of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Drog\u00f6n Ch\u00f6gyal Phagpa]] as the leading [[lama]].

Acceptable apparel for scholar-officials was rigidly defined by social ranking system. However, as time went on this rule of rank-graded apparel for officials was not as strictly enforced. Each official was able to display his awarded status by wearing different-coloured traditional [[Han Chinese clothing|silken robes]] that hung to the ground around his feet, specific types of headgear, and even specific styles of girdles that displayed his graded-rank of officialdom.{{sfn|Gernet|1962|pp=127\u201330}}\n\nWomen wore long dresses, blouses that came down to the knee, skirts and jackets with long or short sleeves, while women from wealthy families could wear purple scarves around their shoulders.

The [[Chinese cartography|earliest extant Chinese maps]] date to the 4th century BCE,{{sfn|Hsu|1993|pp=90\u201393}} yet it was not until the time of [[Pei Xiu]] (224\u2013271) that topographical [[elevation]], a formal [[Grid reference|rectangular grid]] system, and use of a standard graduated scale of distances was applied to terrain maps.{{sfn|Hsu|1993|pp=96\u201397}}{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=538\u2013540}} [[List of Chinese inventions#R|Following a long tradition]], Shen Kuo created a [[raised-relief map]], while his other maps featured a uniform graduated scale of 1:900,000.{{sfn|Sivin|1995|p=22}}{{sfn|Temple|1986|p=179}} A {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} squared map of 1137\u2014carved into a stone block\u2014followed a uniform grid scale of 100 li for each gridded square, and accurately mapped the outline of the coasts and river systems of China, extending all the way to India.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|loc=pp. 547\u2013549, Plate LXXXI}} Furthermore, the world's oldest known terrain map in printed form comes from the edited encyclopedia of Yang Jia in 1155, which displayed western China without the formal grid system that was characteristic of more professionally made Chinese maps.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|loc=p. 549, Plate LXXXII}} Although [[gazetteer]]s had existed since 52 CE during the Han dynasty and gazetteers accompanied by illustrative maps (Chinese: {{transl|zho|tujing}}) since the Sui dynasty, the illustrated gazetteer became much more common in the Song dynasty, when the foremost concern was for illustrative gazetteers to serve political, administrative, and military purposes.{{sfn|Hargett|1996|pp=406, 409\u2013412}}\n\n=== Movable type printing ===\n{{Further|History of printing in East Asia}}\n\nThe innovation of [[movable type]] printing was made by the artisan [[Bi Sheng]] (990\u20131051), first described by the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' of 1088.{{sfn|Needham|1986e|pp=201\u2013203}}{{sfn|Sivin|1995|p=27}} The collection of Bi Sheng's original clay-fired [[typeface]] was passed on to one of Shen Kuo's nephews, and was carefully preserved.{{sfn|Sivin|1995|p=27}}{{sfn|Needham|1986c|p=33}} Movable type enhanced the already widespread use of [[woodblock printing|woodblock methods of printing]] thousands of documents and volumes of written literature, consumed eagerly by an increasingly literate public. The advancement of printing deeply affected education and the scholar-official class, since more books could be made faster while mass-produced, printed books were cheaper in comparison to laborious handwritten copies.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=147}}{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=159}} The enhancement of widespread printing and [[print culture]] in the Song period was thus a direct [[catalyst]] in the rise of [[social mobility]] and expansion of the educated class of scholar elites, the latter which expanded dramatically in size from the 11th to 13th centuries.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=147}}{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp=159\u2013160}}\n\nThe movable type invented by Bi Sheng was ultimately trumped by the use of woodblock printing due to the limitations of the enormous [[Chinese character]] writing system, yet movable type printing continued to be used and was improved in later periods. The [[Yuan dynasty]] scholar-official [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1290\u20131333) implemented a faster typesetting process, improved Bi's baked-clay movable type character set with a wooden one, and experimented with tin-metal movable type.{{sfn|Needham|1986e|pp=206\u2013208, 217}} The wealthy printing patron [[Hua Sui]] (1439\u20131513) of the [[Ming dynasty]] established China's first metal movable type (using bronze) in 1490.{{sfn|Needham|1986e|pp=212\u2013213}} In 1638 the [[Beijing]] [[Gazette]] switched their printing process from woodblock to movable type printing.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=xxi}} Yet it was during the [[Qing dynasty]] that massive printing projects began to employ movable type printing. This includes the printing of sixty-six copies of a 5,020 volume long encyclopedia in 1725, the ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' (''Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times''), which necessitated the crafting of 250,000 movable type characters cast in bronze.{{sfn|Needham|1986e|pp=215\u2013216}} By the 19th century the European style [[printing press]] replaced the old Chinese methods of movable type, while traditional woodblock printing in modern East Asia is used sparsely and for aesthetic reasons.\n\n=== Hydraulic and nautical engineering ===\n{{main|Science and technology of the Song dynasty}}\nThe most important nautical innovation of the Song period seems to have been the introduction of the [[magnetism|magnetic]] mariner's [[compass]], which permitted accurate [[navigation]] on the open sea regardless of the weather.{{sfn|Sivin|1995|p=22}} The magnetized compass needle {{ndash}} known in Chinese as the \"south-pointing needle\" {{ndash}} was first described by [[Shen Kuo]] in his 1088 ''Dream Pool Essays'' and first mentioned in active use by sailors in [[Zhu Yu (author)|Zhu Yu]]'s 1119 ''Pingzhou Table Talks''.\n\n[[File:Canal lock.svg|alt=A diagram of the pound lock system, from a bird's eye perspective and from a side perspective.

The 10th-century invention of the [[pound lock]] for canal systems allowed different water levels to be raised and lowered for separated segments of a canal, which significantly aided the safety of canal traffic and allowed for larger barges.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|pp=350\u2013351}} There was the Song-era innovation of [[Bulkhead (partition)|watertight bulkhead compartments]] that allowed damage to [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]s without sinking the ships.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=159}}{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=463}} If ships were damaged, the Chinese of the 11th century employed [[drydock]]s to repair them while suspended out of the water.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=660}} The Song used crossbeams to brace the ribs of ships in order to strengthen them in a skeletal-like structure.{{sfn|Graff|Higham|2002|p=86}} [[Stern]]-mounted [[rudder]]s had been mounted on Chinese ships since the 1st century, as evidenced with a preserved Han tomb model of a ship. In the Song period, the Chinese devised a way to mechanically raise and lower rudders in order for ships to travel in a wider range of water depths.{{sfn|Graff|Higham|2002|p=86}} The Song arranged the protruding teeth of anchors in a circular pattern instead of in one direction.{{sfn|Graff|Higham|2002|p=86}} David Graff and Robin Higham state that this arrangement \"[made] them more reliable\" for anchoring ships.{{sfn|Graff|Higham|2002|p=86}}\n\n=== Structural engineering and architecture ===\n{{main|Architecture of the Song dynasty}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left|\n | total_width = 320\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = \u5f00\u5c01\u94c1\u5854.jpg\n | alt1 = A thin, thirteen story brick building with small, slightly curved eaves between each story.

Authors such as [[Yu Hao]] and [[Shen Kuo]] wrote books outlining the field of architectural layouts, craftsmanship, and [[structural engineering]] in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively. Shen Kuo preserved the written dialogues of Yu Hao when describing technical issues such as slanting [[strut]]s built into pagoda towers for diagonal wind bracing.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=141}} Shen Kuo also preserved Yu's specified dimensions and units of measurement for various building types.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|pp=82\u201384}} The architect [[Architecture of the Song dynasty#Treatise of Li Jie|Li Jie]] (1065\u20131110), who published the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'' ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') in 1103, greatly expanded upon the works of Yu Hao and compiled the standard building codes used by the central government agencies and by craftsmen throughout the empire.{{sfn|Guo|1998|pp=4\u20136}} He addressed the standard methods of construction, design, and applications of moats and fortifications, stonework, greater woodwork, lesser woodwork, wood-carving, turning and drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, painting and decoration, brickwork, glazed tile making, and provided proportions for [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] formulas in [[masonry]].{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=85}}{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=5}} In his book, Li provided detailed and vivid illustrations of architectural components and cross-sections of buildings.

Many of the pagoda towers built during the Song period were erected at heights that exceeded ten stories. Some of the most famous are the [[Iron Pagoda]] built in 1049 during the Northern Song and the [[Liuhe Pagoda]] built in 1165 during the Southern Song, although [[:Category:Chinese pagodas|there were many others]]. The tallest is the [[Liaodi Pagoda]] of [[Hebei]] built in 1055, towering {{convert|84|m|ft|abbr=on}} in total height. Some of the bridges reached lengths of {{convert|1220|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with many being wide enough to allow two lanes of cart traffic simultaneously over a waterway or ravine.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|pp=151\u2013153}} The government also oversaw construction of their own administrative offices, palace apartments, city fortifications, ancestral temples, and Buddhist temples.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=84}}\n\nThe professions of the architect, craftsman, carpenter, and structural engineer were not seen as professionally equal to that of a Confucian scholar-official. Architectural knowledge had been passed down orally for thousands of years in China, in many cases from a father craftsman to his son. Structural engineering and architecture schools were known to have existed during the Song period; one prestigious engineering school was headed by the renowned bridge-builder [[Cai Xiang]] (1012\u20131067) in medieval [[Fujian]] province.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=153}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | total_width = 350\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = Goddess Temple Jinsi.JPG\n | alt1 = Goddess Temple Jinsi\n | caption1 = Temple of the Saintly Mother, [[Jinci|Jin Temple]], Taiyuan, built in 1032\n | image2 = Yingzao Fashi 1 desmear.JPG\n | alt2 = Yingzao Fashi 1 desmear\n | caption2 = [[Bracket (architecture)|Bracket]] arm clusters containing [[cantilever]]s, from [[Architecture of the Song dynasty#Literature|Li Jie's]] building manual ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'', printed in 1103.\n}}\n\nBesides existing buildings and technical literature of building manuals, [[Architecture of the Song dynasty#Architecture in Song artwork|Song dynasty artwork]] portraying [[cityscape]]s and other buildings aid modern-day scholars in their attempts to reconstruct and realize the nuances of Song architecture. Song dynasty artists such as [[Li Cheng (painter)|Li Cheng]], [[Fan Kuan]], [[Guo Xi]], [[Zhang Zeduan]], [[Emperor Huizong of Song]], and Ma Lin painted close-up depictions of buildings as well as large expanses of cityscapes featuring [[Arch bridge|arched bridges]], halls and [[Chinese pavilion|pavilions]], [[Pagoda|pagoda towers]], and distinct [[Chinese city wall]]s. The scientist and statesman Shen Kuo was known for his [[Art criticism|criticism of artwork]] relating to architecture, saying that it was more important for an artist to capture a holistic view of a landscape than it was to focus on the angles and corners of buildings.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=115}} For example, Shen criticized the work of the painter Li Cheng for failing to observe the principle of \"seeing the small from the viewpoint of the large\" in portraying buildings.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=115}}\n\nThere were also pyramidal tomb structures in the Song era, such as the Song imperial tombs located in Gongxian, [[Henan]] province.{{sfn|Steinhardt|1993|p=375}} About {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Gongxian is another Song dynasty tomb at Baisha, which features \"elaborate facsimiles in brick of Chinese timber frame construction, from door lintels to pillars and pedestals to bracket sets, that adorn interior walls.\"{{sfn|Steinhardt|1993|p=375}} The two large chambers of the Baisha tomb also feature conical-shaped roofs.{{sfn|Steinhardt|1993|p=376}} Flanking the avenues leading to these tombs [[:File:Songling2.jpg|are lines of Song dynasty stone statues]] of officials, tomb guardians, [[animal]]s, and [[legendary creature]]s.\n\n=== Archaeology ===\n{{Further|History of Chinese archaeology}}\n[[File:Liu Ding.jpg|alt=A heavily tarnished bronze bowl adorned with several carvings of squares that curl in on themselves at the bottom.

Shen objected to the idea of his peers that ancient relics were products created by famous \"sages\" in lore or the [[Four occupations|ancient aristocratic class]]; Shen rightfully attributed the discovered handicrafts and vessels from ancient times as the work of artisans and commoners from previous eras.{{sfn|Fraser|Haber|1986|p=227}} He also disapproved of his peers' pursuit of archaeology simply to enhance state ritual, since Shen not only took an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] approach with the study of archaeology, but he also emphasized the study of functionality and investigating what was the ancient relics' original processes of manufacture.{{sfn|Fraser|Haber|1986|p=227}} Shen used ancient texts and existing models of [[armillary sphere]]s to create one based on ancient standards; Shen described ancient weaponry such as the use of a [[Sight (device)|scaled sighting device]] on crossbows; while experimenting with [[Bar (music)|ancient musical measures]], Shen suggested hanging [[Bianzhong|an ancient bell]] by using a hollow handle.{{sfn|Fraser|Haber|1986|p=227}}\n\nDespite the gentry's overriding interest in archaeology simply for reviving ancient state rituals, some of Shen's peers took a similar approach to the study of archaeology. His contemporary [[Ouyang Xiu]] (1007\u20131072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze which pioneered ideas in early [[epigraphy]] and archaeology.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=148}} During the 11th century, Song scholars discovered the ancient shrine of Wu Liang (78\u2013151 CE), a scholar of the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BCE \u2013 220 CE); they produced rubbings of the carvings and [[bas-relief]]s decorating the walls of his tomb so that they could be analyzed elsewhere.{{sfn|Hansen|2000|p=142}} On the unreliability of historical works written after the fact, scholar-official [[Zhao Mingcheng]] (1081\u20131129) stated \"... the inscriptions on stone and bronze are made at the time the events took place and can be trusted without reservation, and thus discrepancies may be discovered.\"{{sfn|Rudolph|1963|p=170}} Historian R.C.

The dynasty was founded by [[Emperor Taizu of Song]] following his usurpation of the throne of the [[Later Zhou]], ending the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. The Song often came into conflict with the contemporaneous [[Liao dynasty|Liao]], [[Western Xia]] and [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] dynasties to its north. It was eventually conquered by the [[Mongols|Mongol]]-led [[Yuan dynasty]]. The Song government was the first in world history to issue [[banknote]]s or true paper money nationally and the first Chinese government to establish [[Naval history of China|a permanent standing navy]]. This dynasty also saw the first known use of [[gunpowder]], as well as the first discernment of [[true north]] using a [[compass]].\n\nThe Song dynasty is divided into two distinct periods: Northern Song and Southern Song. During the [[#Northern Song, 960\u20131127|Northern Song]] ({{zh |c = \u5317\u5b8b}}; 960\u20131127), the Song capital was in the northern city of [[Kaifeng|Bianjing]] (now [[Kaifeng]]) and the dynasty controlled most of what is now Eastern China. The [[#Southern Song, 1127\u20131279|Southern Song]] ({{zh |c = \u5357\u5b8b}}; 1127\u20131279) refers to the period after the Song lost control of its northern half to the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-led Jin dynasty in the [[Jin\u2013Song Wars]]. During this time, the Song court retreated south of the [[Yangtze]] and established its capital at Lin'an (now [[Hangzhou]]). Although the Song dynasty had lost control of the traditional \"birthplace of Chinese civilization\" along the [[Yellow River]], the Song economy was still strong, as the Southern Song empire contained a large population and productive agricultural land. The Southern Song dynasty considerably bolstered its naval strength to defend its waters and land borders and to conduct [[Ancient maritime history#China|maritime]] missions abroad. To repel the Jin, and later the Mongols, the Song developed revolutionary new military technology augmented by the use of gunpowder. In 1234, the Jin dynasty was conquered by the Mongols, who took control of northern China, maintaining uneasy relations with the Southern Song. [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]], the fourth [[Khagan|Great Khan]] of the [[Mongol Empire]], died in 1259 while besieging the mountain castle [[Diaoyucheng]], [[Chongqing]]. His younger brother [[Kublai Khan]] was proclaimed the new Great Khan, though his claim was only partially recognized by the Mongols in the west. In 1271, Kublai Khan proclaimed himself [[Emperor of China]] and established the Yuan dynasty.{{sfn|Rossabi|1988|p=115}} After two decades of sporadic warfare, Kublai Khan's armies [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|conquered the Song dynasty]] in 1279, after the Southern Song suffered military defeat in the [[Battle of Yamen]]. The [[Mongol invasion of China|Mongol invasion]] eventually led to a Chinese reunification under the Yuan dynasty.{{sfn|Rossabi|1988|p=76}}\n\nThe population of China doubled in size during the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries. This growth was made possible by expanded rice cultivation in central and southern Song, the use of early-ripening rice from south-east and southern Asia, and the production of widespread food surpluses.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=156}}{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=96}} The Northern Song census recorded 20 million households, double of the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties. It is estimated that the Northern Song had a population of 90 million people,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Durand|first=John|date=1960|title=The Population Statistics of China, A.D. 2-1953|url=|journal=Population Studies|volume= 13|issue=3|pages=209\u2013256|doi=10.2307/2172247|jstor=2172247}}</ref> and 200 million by the time of the [[Ming dynasty]].{{sfn|Veeck|Pannell|Smith|Huang|2007|pp=103\u2013104}} This dramatic increase of population fomented an [[Economy of the Song dynasty|economic revolution in pre-modern China]]. The expansion of the population, growth of cities, and the emergence of a national economy led to the gradual withdrawal of the central government from direct involvement in economic affairs. The [[Chinese gentry|lower gentry]] assumed a larger role in grassroots administration and local affairs. Appointed officials in county and provincial centers relied upon the scholarly gentry for their services, sponsorship, and local supervision.\n\nSocial life during the Song was vibrant. Citizens gathered to view and trade precious artworks, the populace intermingled at public festivals and private clubs, and cities had lively entertainment quarters. The spread of literature and knowledge was enhanced by the rapid expansion of [[woodblock printing]] and the 11th-century invention of [[movable type|movable-type]] printing. Technology, science, philosophy, mathematics, and engineering flourished over the course of the Song.

Although the institution of the [[Imperial examination|civil service examinations]] had existed since the [[Sui dynasty]], it became much more prominent in the Song period.

From its inception under Taizu, the Song dynasty alternated between warfare and diplomacy with the ethnic [[Khitan people|Khitans]] of the [[Liao dynasty]] in the northeast and with the [[Tangut people|Tanguts]] of the [[Western Xia]] in the northwest. The Song dynasty used military force in an attempt to quell the Liao dynasty and to recapture the [[Sixteen Prefectures]], a territory under Khitan control since 938 that was traditionally considered to be part of [[China proper]] (Most parts of today's [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]]).{{sfn|Mote|1999|p=69}} Song forces were repulsed by the Liao forces, who engaged in aggressive yearly campaigns into Northern Song territory until 1005, when the signing of the [[Shanyuan Treaty]] ended these northern border clashes. The Song were forced to provide tribute to the Khitans, although this did little damage to the Song economy since the Khitans were economically dependent upon importing massive amounts of goods from the Song.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=154}} More significantly, the Song state recognized the Liao state as its diplomatic equal.{{sfn|Mote|1999|pp=70\u201371}} The Song created an extensive defensive forest along the Song-Liao border to thwart potential Khitan cavalry attacks.{{sfn|Chen|2018}}\n\n[[File:Taizong of Song.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=A man in heavy white robes, wearing a black hat with long horizontal protrusions coming from the bottom of the hat.|A portrait of [[Emperor Taizong of Song]] (r.&nbsp;976\u2013997), [[National Palace Museum]], Taipei]]\nThe Song dynasty managed to win several military victories over the Tanguts in the early 11th century, culminating in a campaign led by the polymath scientist, general, and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] (1031\u20131095).{{sfn|Sivin|1995|p=8}} However, this campaign was ultimately a failure due to a rival military officer of Shen disobeying direct orders, and the territory gained from the Western Xia was eventually lost.{{sfn|Sivin|1995|p=9}} There was also a [[L\u00fd\u2013Song War|significant war]] fought against the [[L\u00fd dynasty]] of [[Vietnam]] from 1075 to 1077 over a border dispute and the Song's severing of commercial relations with the [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]] kingdom.{{sfn|Anderson|2008|p=207}} After L\u00fd forces inflicted heavy damages in a raid on [[Guangxi]], the Song commander Guo Kui (1022\u20131088) penetrated as far as Th\u0103ng Long (modern [[Hanoi]]).{{sfn|Anderson|2008|p=208}} Heavy losses on both sides prompted the L\u00fd commander Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t (1019\u20131105) to make peace overtures, allowing both sides to withdraw from the war effort; captured territories held by both Song and L\u00fd were mutually exchanged in 1082, along with prisoners of war.{{sfn|Anderson|2008|pp=208\u2013209}}\n\n[[File:Song-Bodhisattva1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|A wooden Bodhisattva from the Song dynasty (960\u20131279).]]\nDuring the 11th century, political rivalries divided members of the court due to the ministers' differing approaches, opinions, and policies regarding the handling of the Song's complex society and thriving economy. The idealist [[Chancellor (China)|Chancellor]], [[Fan Zhongyan]] (989\u20131052), was the first to receive a heated political backlash when he attempted to institute the [[Qingli Reforms]], which included measures such as improving the recruitment system of officials, increasing the salaries for minor officials, and establishing sponsorship programs to allow a wider range of people to be well educated and eligible for state service.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=163}}\n\nAfter Fan was forced to step down from his office, [[Wang Anshi]] (1021\u20131086) became Chancellor of the imperial court. With the backing of [[Emperor Shenzong of Song|Emperor Shenzong]] (1067\u20131085), Wang Anshi severely criticized the educational system and state bureaucracy. Seeking to resolve what he saw as state corruption and negligence, Wang implemented a series of reforms called the [[New Policies (Song dynasty)|New Policies]]. These involved [[land value tax]] reform, the establishment of several government [[monopoly|monopolies]], the support of local [[militia]]s, and the creation of higher standards for the Imperial examination to make it more practical for men skilled in statecraft to pass.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=164}}\n\nThe reforms created political factions in the court. Wang Anshi's \"New Policies Group\" (''Xin Fa''), also known as the \"Reformers\", were opposed by the ministers in the \"Conservative\" faction led by the historian and Chancellor [[Sima Guang]] (1019\u20131086).{{sfn|Sivin|1995|pp=3\u20134}} As one faction supplanted another in the majority position of the court ministers, it would demote rival officials and exile them to govern remote frontier regions of the empire.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=164}} One of the prominent victims of the political rivalry, the famous poet and statesman [[Su Shi]] (1037\u20131101), was jailed and eventually exiled for criticizing Wang's reforms.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=164}}\n\nWhile the central Song court remained politically divided and focused upon its internal affairs, alarming new events to the north in the Liao state finally came to its attention. The [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]], a subject tribe of the Liao, rebelled against them and formed their own state, the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=165}} The Song official [[Tong Guan]] (1054\u20131126) advised [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Huizong]] (1100\u20131125) to form an alliance with the Jurchens, and the joint military campaign under this [[Alliance Conducted at Sea]] toppled and completely conquered the Liao dynasty by 1125. During the joint attack, the Song's northern expedition army removed the defensive forest along the Song-Liao border.{{sfn|Chen|2018}}\n\n[[Image:Liao Dynasty - Guan Yin statue.jpg|alt=A wooden carving of a sitting Buddhist figure in loose fitting, painted robes.|thumb|left|upright=0.7|A [[Liao dynasty]] [[polychrome]] wood-carved [[statue]] of [[Guan Yin]], [[Shanxi Province]], China, (907\u20131125)]]\nHowever, the poor performance and military weakness of the Song army was observed by the Jurchens, who immediately broke the alliance, beginning the [[Jin\u2013Song Wars]] of 1125 and 1127. Because of the removal of the previous defensive forest, the Jin army marched quickly across the North China Plain to Kaifeng.{{sfn|Chen|2018}} In the [[Jingkang Incident]] during the latter invasion, the Jurchens captured not only the capital, but the retired emperor Huizong, his successor [[Emperor Qinzong of Song|Emperor Qinzong]], and most of the Imperial court.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=165}}\n\nThe remaining Song forces regrouped under the self-proclaimed [[Emperor Gaozong of Song]] (1127\u20131162) and withdrew south of the [[Yangtze]] to establish a new capital at Lin'an (modern [[Hangzhou]]). The Jurchen conquest of [[North China]] and shift of capitals from Kaifeng to Lin'an was the dividing line between the Northern and [[#Southern Song, 1127\u20131279|Southern Song]] dynasties.\n\nAfter their fall to the Jin, the Song lost control of North China. Now occupying what has been traditionally known as \"China Proper,\" the Jin regarded themselves the rightful rulers of China. The Jin later chose earth as their dynastic element and yellow as their royal color. According to the theory of the [[Wu Xing|Five Elements]] (wuxing), the earth element follows the fire, the dynastic element of the Song, in the sequence of elemental creation. Therefore, their ideological move showed that the Jin considered Song reign in China complete, with the Jin replacing the Song as the rightful rulers of China Proper.{{sfn|Chen|2014}}\n\n===Southern Song, 1127\u20131279===\n[[File:Gaozong Of Song.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=A man in heavy white robes, wearing a black hat with long horizontal protrusions coming from the bottom of the hat.|A portrait of [[Emperor Gaozong of Song]] (r.&nbsp;1127\u20131162), [[National Palace Museum]], Taipei]]\n[[File:China - Southern Song Dynasty-en.svg|left|upright=1.15|thumb|Southern Song in 1142.

Selecting men for office through proven merit [[Xiaolian|was an ancient idea in China]]. The civil service system became institutionalized on a small scale during the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties, but by the Song period it became virtually the only means for drafting officials into the government.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|pp=145\u2013146}} The advent of widespread [[printing]] helped to widely circulate Confucian teachings and to educate more and more eligible candidates for the exams.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=147}} This can be seen in the number of exam takers for the low-level prefectural exams rising from 30,000 annual candidates in the early 11th century to 400,000 candidates by the late 13th century.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=147}} The civil service and examination system allowed for greater [[meritocracy]], [[social mobility]], and equality in competition for those wishing to attain an official seat in government.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=162}} Using statistics gathered by the Song state, Edward A.

Northern Song's Military Council operated under a Chancellor, who had no control over the imperial army. The imperial army was divided among three marshals, each independently responsible to the Emperor. Since the Emperor rarely led campaigns personally, Song forces lacked unity of command.{{sfn|Bai|2002|pp=239}} The imperial court often believed that successful generals endangered royal authority, and relieved or even executed them (notably Li Gang,{{sfn|Bai|2002|pp=250}} [[Yue Fei]], and [[Han Shizhong]]{{sfn|Bai|2002|p=254}}).\n[[File:Northern song Cavalry.jpg|thumb|Armoured Song cavalry]]\n\nAlthough the scholar-officials viewed [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|military soldiers]] as lower members in the hierarchic social order,{{sfn|Graff|Higham|2002|pp=25\u201326}} a person could gain status and prestige in society by becoming a high-ranking military officer with a record of victorious battles.{{sfn|Lorge|2005|p=43}} At its height, the Song military had one million soldiers{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=164}} divided into [[platoon]]s of 50 troops, companies made of two platoons, battalions composed of 500 soldiers.{{sfn|Lorge|2005|p=45}}{{sfn|Peers|2006|p=130}} [[Crossbow]]men were separated from the regular infantry and placed in their own units as they were prized combatants, providing effective missile fire against cavalry charges.{{sfn|Peers|2006|p=130}} The government was eager to sponsor new crossbow designs that could shoot at longer ranges, while crossbowmen were also valuable when employed as long-range [[sniper]]s.{{sfn|Peers|2006|pp=130\u2013131}} Song cavalry employed a slew of different weapons, including halberds, swords, bows, spears, and '[[fire lance]]s' that discharged a gunpowder blast of flame and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]].{{sfn|Peers|2006|p=131}} The Song dynasty did not possess much in the way of warhorses.

To supplement their cavalry, the Song bought every year ten to forty thousand horses from the northwest and southwest borderlands.{{sfn|Chaffee|2015|p=235}}\nDue to the lack of their own cavalry forces, the Song army usually had to rely on anti-cavalry infantry equipped with \"horse-butchering sabres\", large axes, and crossbows to overcome the [[Khitans]] and [[Jurchens]].{{sfn|Chaffee|2015|p=242}}\n\n[[File:Dingzhou Liaodi Pagoda 4.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Liaodi Pagoda]], the tallest pre-modern [[Chinese pagoda]], built in 1055; it was intended as a [[Buddhist architecture|Buddhist religious structure]], yet served a military purpose as a [[watchtower]] for [[reconnaissance]].{{sfn|Cai|2011|pp=81\u201382}}]]\n\nMilitary strategy and military training were treated as sciences that could be studied and perfected; soldiers were tested in their skills of using weaponry and in their athletic ability.{{sfn|Peers|2006|p=129}} The troops were trained to follow signal standards to advance at the waving of banners and to halt at the sound of bells and drums.{{sfn|Peers|2006|p=130}}\n\nThe Song navy was of great importance during the consolidation of the empire in the 10th century; during the war against the [[Southern Tang]] state the Song navy employed tactics such as defending large floating [[pontoon bridge]]s across the [[Yangtze River]] in order to secure movements of troops and supplies.{{sfn|Graff|Higham|2002|p=87}} There were large ships in the Song navy that could carry 1,000 soldiers aboard their decks,{{sfn|Graff|Higham|2002|pp=86\u201387}} while the swift-moving [[Paddle steamer|paddle-wheel craft]] were viewed as essential fighting ships in any successful naval battle.{{sfn|Graff|Higham|2002|pp=86\u201387}}{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=422}}\n\nIn a battle on January 23, 971, massive arrow fire from Song dynasty crossbowmen decimated the [[war elephant]] corps of the [[Southern Han]] army.{{sfn|Schafer|1957|p=291}} This defeat not only marked the eventual submission of the Southern Han to the Song dynasty, but also the last instance where a war elephant corps was employed as a regular division within a Chinese army.{{sfn|Schafer|1957|p=291}}\n\nThere was a total of 347 military treatises written during the Song period, as listed by the history text of the ''Song Shi'' (compiled in 1345).{{sfn|Needham|1986e|p=19}} However, only a handful of these military treatises have survived, which includes the ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' written in 1044.

The genre of Chinese [[travel literature]] also became popular with the writings of the geographer [[Fan Chengda]] (1126\u20131193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the 'daytrip essay' known as ''[[Su Shi#Travel record literature|Record of Stone Bell Mountain]]'' that used [[persuasive writing]] to argue for a philosophical point.{{sfn|Hargett|1985|pp=74\u201376}} Although an early form of the local geographic [[gazetteer]] existed in China since the 1st century, the matured form known as \"treatise on a place\", or ''fangzhi'', replaced the old \"map guide\", or {{trans|zho|tujing}}, during the Song dynasty.{{sfn|Bol|2001|p=44}}\n\nThe imperial courts of the emperor's palace were filled with his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers.

Buddhism's continuing influence can be seen in painted artwork such as [[Lin Tinggui]]'s ''[[Arhat|Luohan]] Laundering''. However, the ideology was highly criticized and even scorned by some.

Many of the pagoda towers built during the Song period were erected at heights that exceeded ten stories. Some of the most famous are the [[Iron Pagoda]] built in 1049 during the Northern Song and the [[Liuhe Pagoda]] built in 1165 during the Southern Song, although [[:Category:Chinese pagodas|there were many others]]. The tallest is the [[Liaodi Pagoda]] of [[Hebei]] built in 1055, towering {{convert|84|m|ft|abbr=on}} in total height. Some of the bridges reached lengths of {{convert|1220|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with many being wide enough to allow two lanes of cart traffic simultaneously over a waterway or ravine.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|pp=151\u2013153}} The government also oversaw construction of their own administrative offices, palace apartments, city fortifications, ancestral temples, and Buddhist temples.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=84}}\n\nThe professions of the architect, craftsman, carpenter, and structural engineer were not seen as professionally equal to that of a Confucian scholar-official. Architectural knowledge had been passed down orally for thousands of years in China, in many cases from a father craftsman to his son. Structural engineering and architecture schools were known to have existed during the Song period; one prestigious engineering school was headed by the renowned bridge-builder [[Cai Xiang]] (1012\u20131067) in medieval [[Fujian]] province.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=153}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | total_width = 350\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = Goddess Temple Jinsi.JPG\n | alt1 = Goddess Temple Jinsi\n | caption1 = Temple of the Saintly Mother, [[Jinci|Jin Temple]], Taiyuan, built in 1032\n | image2 = Yingzao Fashi 1 desmear.JPG\n | alt2 = Yingzao Fashi 1 desmear\n | caption2 = [[Bracket (architecture)|Bracket]] arm clusters containing [[cantilever]]s, from [[Architecture of the Song dynasty#Literature|Li Jie's]] building manual ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'', printed in 1103.\n}}\n\nBesides existing buildings and technical literature of building manuals, [[Architecture of the Song dynasty#Architecture in Song artwork|Song dynasty artwork]] portraying [[cityscape]]s and other buildings aid modern-day scholars in their attempts to reconstruct and realize the nuances of Song architecture. Song dynasty artists such as [[Li Cheng (painter)|Li Cheng]], [[Fan Kuan]], [[Guo Xi]], [[Zhang Zeduan]], [[Emperor Huizong of Song]], and Ma Lin painted close-up depictions of buildings as well as large expanses of cityscapes featuring [[Arch bridge|arched bridges]], halls and [[Chinese pavilion|pavilions]], [[Pagoda|pagoda towers]], and distinct [[Chinese city wall]]s. The scientist and statesman Shen Kuo was known for his [[Art criticism|criticism of artwork]] relating to architecture, saying that it was more important for an artist to capture a holistic view of a landscape than it was to focus on the angles and corners of buildings.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=115}} For example, Shen criticized the work of the painter Li Cheng for failing to observe the principle of \"seeing the small from the viewpoint of the large\" in portraying buildings.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=115}}\n\nThere were also pyramidal tomb structures in the Song era, such as the Song imperial tombs located in Gongxian, [[Henan]] province.{{sfn|Steinhardt|1993|p=375}} About {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Gongxian is another Song dynasty tomb at Baisha, which features \"elaborate facsimiles in brick of Chinese timber frame construction, from door lintels to pillars and pedestals to bracket sets, that adorn interior walls.\"{{sfn|Steinhardt|1993|p=375}} The two large chambers of the Baisha tomb also feature conical-shaped roofs.{{sfn|Steinhardt|1993|p=376}} Flanking the avenues leading to these tombs [[:File:Songling2.jpg|are lines of Song dynasty stone statues]] of officials, tomb guardians, [[animal]]s, and [[legendary creature]]s.\n\n=== Archaeology ===\n{{Further|History of Chinese archaeology}}\n[[File:Liu Ding.jpg|alt=A heavily tarnished bronze bowl adorned with several carvings of squares that curl in on themselves at the bottom.

Shen objected to the idea of his peers that ancient relics were products created by famous \"sages\" in lore or the [[Four occupations|ancient aristocratic class]]; Shen rightfully attributed the discovered handicrafts and vessels from ancient times as the work of artisans and commoners from previous eras.{{sfn|Fraser|Haber|1986|p=227}} He also disapproved of his peers' pursuit of archaeology simply to enhance state ritual, since Shen not only took an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] approach with the study of archaeology, but he also emphasized the study of functionality and investigating what was the ancient relics' original processes of manufacture.{{sfn|Fraser|Haber|1986|p=227}} Shen used ancient texts and existing models of [[armillary sphere]]s to create one based on ancient standards; Shen described ancient weaponry such as the use of a [[Sight (device)|scaled sighting device]] on crossbows; while experimenting with [[Bar (music)|ancient musical measures]], Shen suggested hanging [[Bianzhong|an ancient bell]] by using a hollow handle.{{sfn|Fraser|Haber|1986|p=227}}\n\nDespite the gentry's overriding interest in archaeology simply for reviving ancient state rituals, some of Shen's peers took a similar approach to the study of archaeology. His contemporary [[Ouyang Xiu]] (1007\u20131072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze which pioneered ideas in early [[epigraphy]] and archaeology.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=148}} During the 11th century, Song scholars discovered the ancient shrine of Wu Liang (78\u2013151 CE), a scholar of the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BCE \u2013 220 CE); they produced rubbings of the carvings and [[bas-relief]]s decorating the walls of his tomb so that they could be analyzed elsewhere.{{sfn|Hansen|2000|p=142}} On the unreliability of historical works written after the fact, scholar-official [[Zhao Mingcheng]] (1081\u20131129) stated \"... the inscriptions on stone and bronze are made at the time the events took place and can be trusted without reservation, and thus discrepancies may be discovered.\"{{sfn|Rudolph|1963|p=170}} Historian R.C.

Several amendments were proposed, but were not adopted at the time the Constitution was ratified.

The Massachusetts convention also ratified the Constitution with an attached list of proposed amendments.

Ultimately, the Catholic [[James II of England|James&nbsp;II]] was overthrown in the [[Glorious Revolution]], and his successors, the Protestants [[William III of England|William&nbsp;III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary&nbsp;II]], accepted the conditions that were codified in the Bill. One of the issues the Bill resolved was the authority of the King to disarm his subjects, after King Charles II and James&nbsp;II had disarmed many Protestants that were \"suspected or knowne\" of disliking the government,<ref>Bogus, Carl T. \"The Hidden History of the Second Amendment.\" https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/davlr31&id=319&men_tab=srchresults.</ref> and had argued with Parliament over his desire to maintain a standing (or permanent) army.<ref group=lower-alpha>From the [[English Civil War]] until the [[Glorious Revolution]] militias occasionally disarmed Catholics, and the King, without Parliament's consent, likewise occasionally disarmed Protestants. Malcolm, \"The Role of the Militia,\" pp.&nbsp;139\u201351.</ref> The bill states that it is acting to restore \"ancient rights\" trampled upon by James&nbsp;II, though some have argued that the English Bill of Rights created a new right to have arms, which developed out of a duty to have arms.<ref>Joyce Lee Malcolm, ''To Keep and Bear Arms''.</ref> In ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' (2008), the Supreme Court did not accept this view, remarking that the English right at the time of the passing of the English Bill of Rights was \"clearly an individual right, having nothing whatsoever to do with service in the militia\" and that it was a right not to be disarmed by the Crown and was not the granting of a new right to have arms.<ref>\"They accordingly obtained an assurance from William and Mary, in the ... (Bill of Rights), that Protestants would never be disarmed: ... This right has long been understood to be the predecessor to our Second Amendment&nbsp;...&nbsp;.

In its full context it is clear that the bill was asserting the right of Protestant citizens not to be disarmed by the King without the consent of Parliament and was merely restoring rights to Protestants that the previous King briefly and unlawfully had removed. In its full context it reads:\n\n<blockquote>Whereas the late King James the Second by the Assistance of diverse evill Councellors Judges and Ministers imployed by him did endeavour to subvert and extirpate the Protestant Religion and the Lawes and Liberties of this Kingdome ''(list of grievances including)'' ... by causing severall good Subjects being Protestants to be disarmed at the same time when Papists were both Armed and Imployed contrary to Law, ''(Recital regarding the change of monarch)'' ... thereupon the said Lords Spirituall and Temporall and Commons pursuant to their respective Letters and Elections being now assembled in a full and free Representative of this Nation takeing into their most serious Consideration the best meanes for attaining the Ends aforesaid Doe in the first place (as their Auncestors in like Case have usually done) for the Vindicating and Asserting their ancient Rights and Liberties, Declare ''(list of rights including)'' ... That the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law.<ref name=\"c21WillMarSess2\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe historical link between the English Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment, which both codify an existing right and do not create a new one, has been acknowledged by the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref group=lower-alpha>\"This meaning is strongly confirmed by the historical background of the Second Amendment. We look to this because it has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amendments, codified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it \"shall not be infringed.\" As we (the United States Supreme Court) said in ''United States v. Cruikshank'', {{ussc |92 |542 |pin= 553 |1876}}, \"[t]his is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The Second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed&nbsp;...\". Between the Restoration and the Glorious Revolution, the Stuart Kings Charles&nbsp;II and James&nbsp;II succeeded in using select militias loyal to them to suppress political dissidents, in part by disarming their opponents. See J.&nbsp;Malcolm, ''To Keep and Bear Arms'' 31\u201353 (1994) (hereinafter Malcolm); L. Schwoerer, ''The Declaration of Rights'', 1689, p.&nbsp;76 (1981). Under the auspices of the 1671 Game Act, for example, the Catholic James&nbsp;II had ordered general disarmaments of regions home to his Protestant enemies. See Malcolm 103\u2013106. These experiences caused Englishmen to be extremely wary of concentrated military forces run by the state and to be jealous of their arms. They accordingly obtained an assurance from William and Mary, in the ''Declaration of Right'' (which was codified as the ''English Bill of Rights''), that Protestants would never be disarmed: \"That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law.\" 1 W. & M., c. 2, \u00a77, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 441 (1689). This right has long been understood to be the predecessor to our Second Amendment. See E. Dumbauld, ''The Bill of Rights and What It Means Today'' 51 (1957); W.

The following year, at [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|a meeting]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], 12 delegates from five states ([[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], and [[Virginia]]) met and drew up a list of problems with the current government model. At its conclusion, the delegates scheduled a follow-up meeting in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania for May 1787 to present solutions to these problems, such as the absence of:<ref>Vile, p.&nbsp;19.</ref><ref name=\"Schmidt39\">Schmidt et al., p.&nbsp;39.</ref>\n* interstate arbitration processes to handle quarrels between states;\n* sufficiently trained and armed intrastate security forces to suppress insurrection;\n* a national militia to repel foreign invaders.\n\nIt quickly became apparent that the solution to all three of these problems required shifting control of the states' militias to the federal Congress and giving that congress the power to raise a standing army.<ref name=\"isbn0-300-09562-7\">Williams, pp.&nbsp;41\u201344.</ref> [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article 1, Section 8]] of the Constitution codified these changes by allowing the Congress to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States by doing the following:<ref>{{cite web |last=Story |first=Joseph |title=Commentaries on the Constitution |at=2:\u00a7\u00a7 904\u201425, 927\u201430, 946\u201452, 954\u201470, 972\u201476, 988 |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_1s28.html |work=The Founders Constitution |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309235955/http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_1s28.html |archivedate=March 9, 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years;\n* provide and maintain a navy;\n* make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces;\n* provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;\n* provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.\n\nSome representatives mistrusted proposals to enlarge federal powers, because they were concerned about the inherent risks of centralizing power.

Many Anti-federalists feared the new federal government would choose to disarm state militias. Federalists countered that in listing only certain rights, unlisted rights might lose protection. The Federalists realized there was insufficient support to ratify the Constitution without a bill of rights and so they promised to support amending the Constitution to add a bill of rights following the Constitution's adoption. This [[Massachusetts Compromise|compromise]] persuaded enough Anti-federalists to vote for the Constitution, allowing for ratification.<ref>Foner and Garraty, p.&nbsp;914. \"The Massachusetts compromise determined the fate of the Constitution, as it permitted delegates with doubts to vote for it in the hope that it would be amended.\"</ref> The Constitution was declared ratified on June&nbsp;21, 1788, when nine of the original thirteen states had ratified it.

This created a fear that the federal government, by neglecting the upkeep of the militia, could have overwhelming military force at its disposal through its power to maintain a standing army and navy, leading to a confrontation with the states, encroaching on the states' reserved powers and even engaging in a military takeover. [[Articles of Confederation#Article summaries|Article VI of the Articles of Confederation]] states:\n\n<blockquote>No vessel of war shall be kept up in time of peace by any State, except such number only, as shall be deemed necessary by the united States in congress assembled, for the defense of such State, or its trade; nor shall any body of forces be kept up by any State in time of peace, except such number only, as in the judgement of the united States, in congress assembled, shall be deemed requisite to garrison the forts necessary for the defense of such State; but every State shall always keep up a well-regulated and disciplined militia, sufficiently armed and accoutered, and shall provide and constantly have ready for use, in public stores, a due number of field pieces and tents, and a proper quantity of arms, ammunition and camp equipage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/articles.html |title=Articles of Confederation |publisher=Usconstitution.net |date=May 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826032645/http://www.usconstitution.net/articles.html |archivedate=August 26, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbpe&fileName=rbpe17/rbpe178/17802600/rbpe17802600.db&recNum=1&itemLink=r?ammem/rbpebib:@field(NUMBER+@band(rbpe+17802600))&linkText=0 |title=US Library of Congress, repro of original text |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319133805/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbpe&fileName=rbpe17%2Frbpe178%2F17802600%2Frbpe17802600.db&recNum=1&itemLink=r%3Fammem%2Frbpebib%3A%40field%28NUMBER+%40band%28rbpe+17802600%29%29&linkText=0 |archivedate=March 19, 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn contrast, [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8, Clause 16]] of the U.S. Constitution states:\n\n<blockquote>To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html |title=US Constitution |publisher=US Constitution |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830022842/http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Government tyranny===\nA foundation of American political thought during the Revolutionary period was concerned about political corruption and governmental tyranny. Even the federalists, fending off their opponents who accused them of creating an oppressive regime, were careful to acknowledge the risks of tyranny. Against that backdrop, the framers saw the personal right to bear arms as a potential check against tyranny. [[Theodore Sedgwick]] of Massachusetts expressed this sentiment by declaring that it is \"a chimerical idea to suppose that a country like this could ever be enslaved ... Is it possible ... that an army could be raised for the purpose of enslaving themselves or their brethren? Or, if raised whether they could subdue a nation of freemen, who know how to prize liberty and who have arms in their hands?\"<ref>{{cite book |volume=2 |author=Elliot, Jonathan |title=The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution |at=97 |edition=2d |year=1863}}</ref> [[Noah Webster]] similarly argued:\n\n<blockquote>Before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe.

They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers.\" Because all were members of the militia, all enjoyed the right to individually bear arms to serve therein.<ref name=\"emerson\"/><ref>{{cite book |volume=3 |author=Elliot, Jonathan |title=The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution |at=425 |edition=3d |year=1937}}</ref>\n\nWriting after the ratification of the Constitution, but before the election of the first Congress, [[James Monroe]] included \"the right to keep and bear arms\" in a list of basic \"human rights\", which he proposed to be added to the Constitution.<ref>{{cite book |series=James Monroe Papers |publisher=New York Public Library |title=Miscellaneous Papers of James Monroe |author-link=James Monroe |author=Monroe, James }}</ref>\n\n[[Patrick Henry]] argued in the Virginia ratification convention on June 5, 1788, for the dual rights to arms and resistance to oppression:\n\n<blockquote>Guard with jealous attention the public liberty.

These debates revolved primarily around risk of \"mal-administration of the government\" using the \"religiously scrupulous\" clause to destroy the militia as Great Britain had attempted to destroy the militia at the commencement of the [[American Revolution]]. These concerns were addressed by modifying the final clause, and on August 24, the House sent the following version to the Senate:\n\n{{quote |A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; but no one religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.}}\n\nThe next day, August 25, the Senate received the amendment from the House and entered it into the Senate Journal.

Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any colour or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. In England, the people have been disarmed, generally, under the specious pretext of preserving the game : a never failing lure to bring over the landed aristocracy to support any measure, under that mask, though calculated for very different purposes. True it is, their bill of rights seems at first view to counteract this policy: but the right of bearing arms is confined to protestants, and the words suitable to their condition and degree, have been interpreted to authorise the prohibition of keeping a gun or other engine for the destruction of game, to any farmer, or inferior tradesman, or other person not qualified to kill game.

Art. 4, and this without any qualification as to their condition or degree, as is the case in the British government\" and \"whoever examines the forest, and game laws in the British code, will readily perceive that the right of keeping arms is effectually taken away from the people of England.\" Blackstone himself also commented on English game laws, Vol. II, p.&nbsp;412, \"that the prevention of popular insurrections and resistance to government by disarming the bulk of the people, is a reason oftener meant than avowed by the makers of the forest and game laws.\"<ref name=\"tucker\"/> Blackstone discussed the right of [[self-defense]] in a separate section of his treatise on the common law of crimes.

The militia, as has been elsewhere explained, consists of those persons who, under the law, are liable to the performance of military duty, and are officered and enrolled for service when called upon. But the law may make provision for the enrolment of all who are fit to perform military duty, or of a small number only, or it may wholly omit to make any provision at all; and if the right were limited to those enrolled, the purpose of this guaranty might be defeated altogether by the action or neglect to act of the government it was meant to hold in check. The meaning of the provision undoubtedly is, that the people, from whom the militia must be taken, shall have the right to keep and bear arms; and they need no permission or regulation of law for the purpose. But this enables the government to have a well-regulated militia; for to bear arms implies something more than the mere keeping; it implies the learning to handle and use them in a way that makes those who keep them ready for their efficient use; in other words, it implies the right to meet for voluntary discipline in arms, observing in doing so the laws of public order.<ref name=\"Cooley1880\">{{cite book |last=Cooley |first=Thomas McIntyre |title=The General Principles of Constitutional Law in the United States of America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bU4oAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA271 |year=1880 |publisher=F.B.

Thus, the most natural reading of \"keep Arms\" in the Second Amendment is to \"have weapons.\" At the time of the founding, as now, to \"bear\" meant to \"carry.\" In numerous instances, \"bear arms\" was unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of an organized militia. Nine state constitutional provisions written in the 18th century or the first two decades of the 19th, which enshrined a right of citizens \"bear arms in defense of themselves and the state\" again, in the most analogous linguistic context \u2013 that \"bear arms\" was not limited to the carrying of arms in a militia. The phrase \"bear Arms\" also had at the time of the founding an idiomatic meaning that was significantly different from its natural meaning: \"to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight\" or \"to wage war.\" But it unequivocally bore that idiomatic meaning only when followed by the preposition \"against.\" Every example given by petitioners' amici for the idiomatic meaning of \"bear arms\" from the founding period either includes the preposition \"against\" or is not clearly idiomatic. In any event, the meaning of \"bear arms\" that petitioners and Justice Stevens propose is not even the (sometimes) idiomatic meaning. Rather, they manufacture a hybrid definition, whereby \"bear arms\" connotes the actual carrying of arms (and therefore is not really an idiom) but only in the service of an organized militia. No dictionary has ever adopted that definition, and we have been apprised of no source that indicates that it carried that meaning at the time of the founding. Worse still, the phrase \"keep and bear Arms\" would be incoherent.

The \"collective rights\" model has been rejected by the Supreme Court, in favor of the individual rights model.\n\nThe Supreme Court's primary Second Amendment cases include ''United States v. Miller'', (1939); ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' (2008); and ''McDonald v. Chicago'' (2010).\n\n''Heller'' and ''McDonald'' supported the individual rights model, under which the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms much as the First Amendment protects the right to free speech. Under this model, the militia is composed of members who supply their own arms and ammunition. This is generally recognized as the method by which militias have historically been armed, as the Supreme Court in ''Miller'' said:<blockquote>The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.' And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/307/174/case.html |title=''United States v.

If \"bear arms\" means, as we think, simply the carrying of arms, a modifier can limit the purpose of the carriage (\"for the purpose of self-defense\" or \"to make war against the King\"). But if \"bear arms\" means, as the petitioners and the dissent think, the carrying of arms only for military purposes, one simply cannot add \"for the purpose of killing game.\" The right \"to carry arms in the militia for the purpose of killing game\" is worthy of the [[The Hatter|mad hatter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/554/07-290/opinion.html |title=''District of Columbia v.

The \"militia\" comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens' militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens' militia would be preserved. pp.&nbsp;22\u201328.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n::(c) The Court's interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. pp.&nbsp;28\u201330.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n::(d) The Second Amendment's drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. pp.&nbsp;30\u201332.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n::(e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court's conclusion. pp.&nbsp;32\u201347.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n::(f) None of the Court's precedents forecloses the Court's interpretation. Neither ''United States v. Cruikshank'', 92 U.S. 542, nor ''Presser v. Illinois'', 116 U.S. 252, refutes the individual-rights interpretation. ''United States v. Miller'', 307 U.S. 174, does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes. pp.&nbsp;47\u201354.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n:2. Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court's opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. ''Miller''{{'}}s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those \"in common use at the time\" finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. pp.&nbsp;54\u201356.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n:3. The handgun ban and the trigger-lock requirement (as applied to self-defense) violate the Second Amendment. The District's total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of \"arms\" that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition \u2013 in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute \u2013 would fail constitutional muster. Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional. Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D. C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and does not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home. pp.&nbsp;56\u201364.<ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n\nThe Supreme Court also defined the term arms used in the Second Amendment. \u201cArms\u201d covered by the Second Amendment were defined in ''[[District of Columbia v.

These three ordinances were a ban on handgun registration, a requirement that all firearms in a home be either disassembled or have a trigger lock, and licensing requirement that prohibits carrying an unlicensed firearm in the home, such as from one room to another.\n\n<blockquote>Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition \u2013 in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute \u2013 would fail constitutional muster. ... Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the District's licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumed that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and did not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.\"<ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Justice Ginsburg]] has been a vocal critic of ''Heller''. Speaking in an interview on public radio station [[WNYC]], she called the Second Amendment \"outdated,\" saying:\n\n{{quote |When we no longer need people to keep muskets in their home, then the Second Amendment has no function ... If the Court had properly interpreted the Second Amendment, the Court would have said that amendment was very important when the nation was new; it gave a qualified right to keep and bear arms, but it was for one purpose only \u2013 and that was the purpose of having militiamen who were able to fight to preserve the nation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/second-amendment-outdated-justice-ginsburg-says |title=Justice Ginsburg Part II: Gender, the Second Amendment, Immigration & More |publisher=wnyc.org |accessdate=June 29, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418062107/http://www.wnyc.org/story/second-amendment-outdated-justice-ginsburg-says/ |archivedate=April 18, 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n\n===''McDonald v.

Thus all rights enumerated in a Constitution are thus auxiliary in the eyes of Sir William Blackstone because all rights are only as good as the extent they are exercised in fact.\n\nWhile both [[James Monroe]] and [[John Adams]] supported the Constitution being ratified, its most influential framer was [[James Madison]]. In [[Federalist No. 46]], Madison wrote how a federal army could be kept in check by state militias, \"a standing army ... would be opposed [by] a militia.\" He argued that state militias \"would be able to repel the danger\" of a federal army, \"It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops.\" He contrasted the federal government of the United States to the European kingdoms, which he described as \"afraid to trust the people with arms,\" and assured that \"the existence of subordinate governments ... forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition\".<ref name=\"emerson\">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/emerson.html|title=United States of America v.

Several amendments were proposed, but were not adopted at the time the Constitution was ratified. For example, the Pennsylvania convention debated fifteen amendments, one of which concerned the right of the people to be armed, another with the militia. The Massachusetts convention also ratified the Constitution with an attached list of proposed amendments. In the end, the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention|ratification convention]] was so evenly divided between those for and against the Constitution that the [[Federalist Party|federalists]] agreed to the Bill of Rights to assure ratification. <!-- Removed Quote of a rejected resolution of the Massachusetts Convention falsely attributed to Samuel Adams.\nSource: https://archive.org/details/debatesandproce00peirgoog\n''Debates and Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Held in the year 1788 And which finally ratified the Constitution of the United States.''

Ultimately, the Catholic [[James II of England|James&nbsp;II]] was overthrown in the [[Glorious Revolution]], and his successors, the Protestants [[William III of England|William&nbsp;III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary&nbsp;II]], accepted the conditions that were codified in the Bill. One of the issues the Bill resolved was the authority of the King to disarm his subjects, after King Charles II and James&nbsp;II had disarmed many Protestants that were \"suspected or knowne\" of disliking the government,<ref>Bogus, Carl T. \"The Hidden History of the Second Amendment.\" https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/davlr31&id=319&men_tab=srchresults.</ref> and had argued with Parliament over his desire to maintain a standing (or permanent) army.<ref group=lower-alpha>From the [[English Civil War]] until the [[Glorious Revolution]] militias occasionally disarmed Catholics, and the King, without Parliament's consent, likewise occasionally disarmed Protestants. Malcolm, \"The Role of the Militia,\" pp.&nbsp;139\u201351.</ref> The bill states that it is acting to restore \"ancient rights\" trampled upon by James&nbsp;II, though some have argued that the English Bill of Rights created a new right to have arms, which developed out of a duty to have arms.<ref>Joyce Lee Malcolm, ''To Keep and Bear Arms''.</ref> In ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' (2008), the Supreme Court did not accept this view, remarking that the English right at the time of the passing of the English Bill of Rights was \"clearly an individual right, having nothing whatsoever to do with service in the militia\" and that it was a right not to be disarmed by the Crown and was not the granting of a new right to have arms.<ref>\"They accordingly obtained an assurance from William and Mary, in the ... (Bill of Rights), that Protestants would never be disarmed: ... This right has long been understood to be the predecessor to our Second Amendment&nbsp;...&nbsp;. It was clearly an individual right, having nothing whatever to do with service in a militia.

In its full context it is clear that the bill was asserting the right of Protestant citizens not to be disarmed by the King without the consent of Parliament and was merely restoring rights to Protestants that the previous King briefly and unlawfully had removed. In its full context it reads:\n\n<blockquote>Whereas the late King James the Second by the Assistance of diverse evill Councellors Judges and Ministers imployed by him did endeavour to subvert and extirpate the Protestant Religion and the Lawes and Liberties of this Kingdome ''(list of grievances including)'' ... by causing severall good Subjects being Protestants to be disarmed at the same time when Papists were both Armed and Imployed contrary to Law, ''(Recital regarding the change of monarch)'' ... thereupon the said Lords Spirituall and Temporall and Commons pursuant to their respective Letters and Elections being now assembled in a full and free Representative of this Nation takeing into their most serious Consideration the best meanes for attaining the Ends aforesaid Doe in the first place (as their Auncestors in like Case have usually done) for the Vindicating and Asserting their ancient Rights and Liberties, Declare ''(list of rights including)'' ... That the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law.<ref name=\"c21WillMarSess2\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe historical link between the English Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment, which both codify an existing right and do not create a new one, has been acknowledged by the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref group=lower-alpha>\"This meaning is strongly confirmed by the historical background of the Second Amendment. We look to this because it has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amendments, codified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it \"shall not be infringed.\" As we (the United States Supreme Court) said in ''United States v. Cruikshank'', {{ussc |92 |542 |pin= 553 |1876}}, \"[t]his is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The Second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed&nbsp;...\". Between the Restoration and the Glorious Revolution, the Stuart Kings Charles&nbsp;II and James&nbsp;II succeeded in using select militias loyal to them to suppress political dissidents, in part by disarming their opponents. See J.&nbsp;Malcolm, ''To Keep and Bear Arms'' 31\u201353 (1994) (hereinafter Malcolm); L. Schwoerer, ''The Declaration of Rights'', 1689, p.&nbsp;76 (1981). Under the auspices of the 1671 Game Act, for example, the Catholic James&nbsp;II had ordered general disarmaments of regions home to his Protestant enemies. See Malcolm 103\u2013106. These experiences caused Englishmen to be extremely wary of concentrated military forces run by the state and to be jealous of their arms. They accordingly obtained an assurance from William and Mary, in the ''Declaration of Right'' (which was codified as the ''English Bill of Rights''), that Protestants would never be disarmed: \"That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law.\" 1 W. & M., c. 2, \u00a77, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 441 (1689). This right has long been understood to be the predecessor to our Second Amendment. See E. Dumbauld, ''The Bill of Rights and What It Means Today'' 51 (1957); W.

Mark Thompson wrote that, apart from determining the succession, the English Bill of Rights did \"little more than set forth certain points of existing laws and simply secured to Englishmen the rights of which they were already posessed {{sic}}.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Constitutional History of England |last=Thompson |first=Mark |year=1938}} qtd. in Maer and Gay, p. 4.</ref> Before and after the English Bill of Rights, the government could always disarm any individual or class of individuals it considered dangerous to the peace of the realm.<ref name=\"isbn0-674-89307-7\">Malcolm, ''To Keep and Bear Arms'', p.&nbsp;51.</ref> In 1765, [[William Blackstone]] wrote the ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' describing the right to have arms in England during the 18th century as a subordinate auxiliary right of the subject that was \"also declared\" in the English Bill of Rights.<ref name=\"Bodenahamer\">Ely and Bodenhamer, pp.&nbsp;89\u201391.</ref><ref name=\"HeymanChigagoKent\">Heyman, pp. 253\u201359. \"Finally, we should note that (contrary to Kates's assertion), Blackstone nowhere suggests that the right to arms derives from \"the common law.\" Instead, this is a right that is secured by \"the constitution,\" and in particular by the Bill of Rights.\"</ref>\n\n{{quote |The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I shall at present mention, is that of having arms for their defence, suitable to their condition and degree, and such as are allowed by law.

Some in the United States have preferred the \"rights\" argument arguing that the English Bill of Rights had granted a right. The need to have arms for self-defence was not really in question.

The following year, at [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|a meeting]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], 12 delegates from five states ([[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], and [[Virginia]]) met and drew up a list of problems with the current government model. At its conclusion, the delegates scheduled a follow-up meeting in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania for May 1787 to present solutions to these problems, such as the absence of:<ref>Vile, p.&nbsp;19.</ref><ref name=\"Schmidt39\">Schmidt et al., p.&nbsp;39.</ref>\n* interstate arbitration processes to handle quarrels between states;\n* sufficiently trained and armed intrastate security forces to suppress insurrection;\n* a national militia to repel foreign invaders.\n\nIt quickly became apparent that the solution to all three of these problems required shifting control of the states' militias to the federal Congress and giving that congress the power to raise a standing army.<ref name=\"isbn0-300-09562-7\">Williams, pp.&nbsp;41\u201344.</ref> [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article 1, Section 8]] of the Constitution codified these changes by allowing the Congress to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States by doing the following:<ref>{{cite web |last=Story |first=Joseph |title=Commentaries on the Constitution |at=2:\u00a7\u00a7 904\u201425, 927\u201430, 946\u201452, 954\u201470, 972\u201476, 988 |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_1s28.html |work=The Founders Constitution |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309235955/http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_1s28.html |archivedate=March 9, 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years;\n* provide and maintain a navy;\n* make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces;\n* provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;\n* provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.\n\nSome representatives mistrusted proposals to enlarge federal powers, because they were concerned about the inherent risks of centralizing power.

Many Anti-federalists feared the new federal government would choose to disarm state militias. Federalists countered that in listing only certain rights, unlisted rights might lose protection. The Federalists realized there was insufficient support to ratify the Constitution without a bill of rights and so they promised to support amending the Constitution to add a bill of rights following the Constitution's adoption. This [[Massachusetts Compromise|compromise]] persuaded enough Anti-federalists to vote for the Constitution, allowing for ratification.<ref>Foner and Garraty, p.&nbsp;914. \"The Massachusetts compromise determined the fate of the Constitution, as it permitted delegates with doubts to vote for it in the hope that it would be amended.\"</ref> The Constitution was declared ratified on June&nbsp;21, 1788, when nine of the original thirteen states had ratified it.

This created a fear that the federal government, by neglecting the upkeep of the militia, could have overwhelming military force at its disposal through its power to maintain a standing army and navy, leading to a confrontation with the states, encroaching on the states' reserved powers and even engaging in a military takeover. [[Articles of Confederation#Article summaries|Article VI of the Articles of Confederation]] states:\n\n<blockquote>No vessel of war shall be kept up in time of peace by any State, except such number only, as shall be deemed necessary by the united States in congress assembled, for the defense of such State, or its trade; nor shall any body of forces be kept up by any State in time of peace, except such number only, as in the judgement of the united States, in congress assembled, shall be deemed requisite to garrison the forts necessary for the defense of such State; but every State shall always keep up a well-regulated and disciplined militia, sufficiently armed and accoutered, and shall provide and constantly have ready for use, in public stores, a due number of field pieces and tents, and a proper quantity of arms, ammunition and camp equipage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/articles.html |title=Articles of Confederation |publisher=Usconstitution.net |date=May 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826032645/http://www.usconstitution.net/articles.html |archivedate=August 26, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbpe&fileName=rbpe17/rbpe178/17802600/rbpe17802600.db&recNum=1&itemLink=r?ammem/rbpebib:@field(NUMBER+@band(rbpe+17802600))&linkText=0 |title=US Library of Congress, repro of original text |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319133805/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbpe&fileName=rbpe17%2Frbpe178%2F17802600%2Frbpe17802600.db&recNum=1&itemLink=r%3Fammem%2Frbpebib%3A%40field%28NUMBER+%40band%28rbpe+17802600%29%29&linkText=0 |archivedate=March 19, 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn contrast, [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8, Clause 16]] of the U.S. Constitution states:\n\n<blockquote>To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html |title=US Constitution |publisher=US Constitution |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830022842/http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Government tyranny===\nA foundation of American political thought during the Revolutionary period was concerned about political corruption and governmental tyranny. Even the federalists, fending off their opponents who accused them of creating an oppressive regime, were careful to acknowledge the risks of tyranny. Against that backdrop, the framers saw the personal right to bear arms as a potential check against tyranny. [[Theodore Sedgwick]] of Massachusetts expressed this sentiment by declaring that it is \"a chimerical idea to suppose that a country like this could ever be enslaved ... Is it possible ... that an army could be raised for the purpose of enslaving themselves or their brethren? Or, if raised whether they could subdue a nation of freemen, who know how to prize liberty and who have arms in their hands?\"<ref>{{cite book |volume=2 |author=Elliot, Jonathan |title=The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution |at=97 |edition=2d |year=1863}}</ref> [[Noah Webster]] similarly argued:\n\n<blockquote>Before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe.

They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers.\" Because all were members of the militia, all enjoyed the right to individually bear arms to serve therein.<ref name=\"emerson\"/><ref>{{cite book |volume=3 |author=Elliot, Jonathan |title=The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution |at=425 |edition=3d |year=1937}}</ref>\n\nWriting after the ratification of the Constitution, but before the election of the first Congress, [[James Monroe]] included \"the right to keep and bear arms\" in a list of basic \"human rights\", which he proposed to be added to the Constitution.<ref>{{cite book |series=James Monroe Papers |publisher=New York Public Library |title=Miscellaneous Papers of James Monroe |author-link=James Monroe |author=Monroe, James }}</ref>\n\n[[Patrick Henry]] argued in the Virginia ratification convention on June 5, 1788, for the dual rights to arms and resistance to oppression:\n\n<blockquote>Guard with jealous attention the public liberty.

These concerns were addressed by modifying the final clause, and on August 24, the House sent the following version to the Senate:\n\n{{quote |A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; but no one religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.}}\n\nThe next day, August 25, the Senate received the amendment from the House and entered it into the Senate Journal.

Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any colour or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. In England, the people have been disarmed, generally, under the specious pretext of preserving the game : a never failing lure to bring over the landed aristocracy to support any measure, under that mask, though calculated for very different purposes. True it is, their bill of rights seems at first view to counteract this policy: but the right of bearing arms is confined to protestants, and the words suitable to their condition and degree, have been interpreted to authorise the prohibition of keeping a gun or other engine for the destruction of game, to any farmer, or inferior tradesman, or other person not qualified to kill game.

Amendments to C. U. S. Art. 4, and this without any qualification as to their condition or degree, as is the case in the British government\" and \"whoever examines the forest, and game laws in the British code, will readily perceive that the right of keeping arms is effectually taken away from the people of England.\" Blackstone himself also commented on English game laws, Vol. II, p.&nbsp;412, \"that the prevention of popular insurrections and resistance to government by disarming the bulk of the people, is a reason oftener meant than avowed by the makers of the forest and game laws.\"<ref name=\"tucker\"/> Blackstone discussed the right of [[self-defense]] in a separate section of his treatise on the common law of crimes.

The militia, as has been elsewhere explained, consists of those persons who, under the law, are liable to the performance of military duty, and are officered and enrolled for service when called upon. But the law may make provision for the enrolment of all who are fit to perform military duty, or of a small number only, or it may wholly omit to make any provision at all; and if the right were limited to those enrolled, the purpose of this guaranty might be defeated altogether by the action or neglect to act of the government it was meant to hold in check. The meaning of the provision undoubtedly is, that the people, from whom the militia must be taken, shall have the right to keep and bear arms; and they need no permission or regulation of law for the purpose. But this enables the government to have a well-regulated militia; for to bear arms implies something more than the mere keeping; it implies the learning to handle and use them in a way that makes those who keep them ready for their efficient use; in other words, it implies the right to meet for voluntary discipline in arms, observing in doing so the laws of public order.<ref name=\"Cooley1880\">{{cite book |last=Cooley |first=Thomas McIntyre |title=The General Principles of Constitutional Law in the United States of America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bU4oAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA271 |year=1880 |publisher=F.B.

Thus, the most natural reading of \"keep Arms\" in the Second Amendment is to \"have weapons.\" At the time of the founding, as now, to \"bear\" meant to \"carry.\" In numerous instances, \"bear arms\" was unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of an organized militia. Nine state constitutional provisions written in the 18th century or the first two decades of the 19th, which enshrined a right of citizens \"bear arms in defense of themselves and the state\" again, in the most analogous linguistic context \u2013 that \"bear arms\" was not limited to the carrying of arms in a militia. The phrase \"bear Arms\" also had at the time of the founding an idiomatic meaning that was significantly different from its natural meaning: \"to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight\" or \"to wage war.\" But it unequivocally bore that idiomatic meaning only when followed by the preposition \"against.\" Every example given by petitioners' amici for the idiomatic meaning of \"bear arms\" from the founding period either includes the preposition \"against\" or is not clearly idiomatic. In any event, the meaning of \"bear arms\" that petitioners and Justice Stevens propose is not even the (sometimes) idiomatic meaning. Rather, they manufacture a hybrid definition, whereby \"bear arms\" connotes the actual carrying of arms (and therefore is not really an idiom) but only in the service of an organized militia. No dictionary has ever adopted that definition, and we have been apprised of no source that indicates that it carried that meaning at the time of the founding. Worse still, the phrase \"keep and bear Arms\" would be incoherent. The word \"Arms\" would have two different meanings at once: \"weapons\" (as the object of \"keep\") and (as the object of \"bear\") one-half of an idiom.

The \"collective rights\" model has been rejected by the Supreme Court, in favor of the individual rights model.\n\nThe Supreme Court's primary Second Amendment cases include ''United States v. Miller'', (1939); ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' (2008); and ''McDonald v. Chicago'' (2010).\n\n''Heller'' and ''McDonald'' supported the individual rights model, under which the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms much as the First Amendment protects the right to free speech. Under this model, the militia is composed of members who supply their own arms and ammunition. This is generally recognized as the method by which militias have historically been armed, as the Supreme Court in ''Miller'' said:<blockquote>The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.' And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/307/174/case.html |title=''United States v.

If \"bear arms\" means, as we think, simply the carrying of arms, a modifier can limit the purpose of the carriage (\"for the purpose of self-defense\" or \"to make war against the King\"). But if \"bear arms\" means, as the petitioners and the dissent think, the carrying of arms only for military purposes, one simply cannot add \"for the purpose of killing game.\" The right \"to carry arms in the militia for the purpose of killing game\" is worthy of the [[The Hatter|mad hatter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/554/07-290/opinion.html |title=''District of Columbia v.

The \"militia\" comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens' militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens' militia would be preserved. pp.&nbsp;22\u201328.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n::(c) The Court's interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. pp.&nbsp;28\u201330.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n::(d) The Second Amendment's drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. pp.&nbsp;30\u201332.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n::(e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court's conclusion. pp.&nbsp;32\u201347.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n::(f) None of the Court's precedents forecloses the Court's interpretation. Neither ''United States v. Cruikshank'', 92 U.S. 542, nor ''Presser v. Illinois'', 116 U.S. 252, refutes the individual-rights interpretation. ''United States v. Miller'', 307 U.S. 174, does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes. pp.&nbsp;47\u201354.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n:2. Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court's opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. ''Miller''{{'}}s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those \"in common use at the time\" finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. pp.&nbsp;54\u201356.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n:3. The handgun ban and the trigger-lock requirement (as applied to self-defense) violate the Second Amendment. The District's total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of \"arms\" that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition \u2013 in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute \u2013 would fail constitutional muster. Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional. Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D. C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and does not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home. pp.&nbsp;56\u201364.<ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n\nThe Supreme Court also defined the term arms used in the Second Amendment. \u201cArms\u201d covered by the Second Amendment were defined in ''[[District of Columbia v.

The majority opinion, authored by Justice Scalia, gives explanation of the majority legal reasoning behind this decision.<ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/> The majority opinion made clear that the recent ruling did not foreclose the Court's prior interpretations given in ''United States v. Cruikshank'', ''Presser v. Illinois'', and ''United States v. Miller'' though these earlier rulings did not limit the right to keep and bear arms solely to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia (i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes).<ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n\n''Heller'' pertained to three District of Columbia ordinances involving restrictions on firearms amounting to a total ban. These three ordinances were a ban on handgun registration, a requirement that all firearms in a home be either disassembled or have a trigger lock, and licensing requirement that prohibits carrying an unlicensed firearm in the home, such as from one room to another.\n\n<blockquote>Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition \u2013 in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute \u2013 would fail constitutional muster. ... Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the District's licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumed that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and did not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.\"<ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Justice Ginsburg]] has been a vocal critic of ''Heller''. Speaking in an interview on public radio station [[WNYC]], she called the Second Amendment \"outdated,\" saying:\n\n{{quote |When we no longer need people to keep muskets in their home, then the Second Amendment has no function ... If the Court had properly interpreted the Second Amendment, the Court would have said that amendment was very important when the nation was new; it gave a qualified right to keep and bear arms, but it was for one purpose only \u2013 and that was the purpose of having militiamen who were able to fight to preserve the nation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/second-amendment-outdated-justice-ginsburg-says |title=Justice Ginsburg Part II: Gender, the Second Amendment, Immigration & More |publisher=wnyc.org |accessdate=June 29, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418062107/http://www.wnyc.org/story/second-amendment-outdated-justice-ginsburg-says/ |archivedate=April 18, 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n\n===''McDonald v.

The company was founded by [[Tim Bevan]] and [[Sarah Radclyffe]] in 1983. It produces feature films and several television productions. [[Eric Fellner]] and Tim Bevan are now the co chairmen of the company.\n\n==Company==\nWorking Title Films was co founded by producers Tim Bevan and Sarah Radclyffe in 1983. In 1992, [[PolyGram]] became the company's corporate backer. Radclyffe left Working Title, and [[Eric Fellner]], a fellow [[independent film]] producer, joined the company.<ref name=\"The producers\">{{cite news|title=Interview: Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan, co-chairmen Working Title Films|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/apr/16/business.hayfilmfestival2005|location=London|author=Higgins, Charlotte|date=16 April 2005|accessdate=31 July 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe company produced a variety of films for [[PolyGram]]'s London based production company, [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]]. An [[United Kingdom|Anglo]]-Dutch [[film studio]], PolyGram Films became a major Hollywood competitor. In 1998, [[Seagram]] sold the bulk of its library of PolyGram films released up until March 31, 1996 to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. \n\nIn 1999, PolyGram was sold to the Seagram company and merged with [[MCA Records|MCA Music Entertainment]], to form [[Universal Music Group]]. PolyGram Films was sold and folded into [[Universal Pictures]] in 1999. Although contractually allowed to produce any film with a budget of up to $35 million, on a practical basis, Bevan and Fellner consult with studio executives at Working Title's parent company [[NBCUniversal]].<ref name=skillset>{{Cite web|authorlink=http://www.skillset.org|title=Working Title \u2013 Skillset|work=The Guardian|url=http://www.skillset.org/film/stories/production/article_3457_1.asp}}</ref> \n\nWorking Title is headquartered in [[London]], and has an office in [[Los Angeles]], which is headed by producer [[Liza Chasin]].\n\n===WT<sup>2</sup> Productions===\nIn 1999, Bevan and Fellner launched a subsidiary company named Working Title 2 Productions, commonly known as WT<sup>2</sup>.

owned by [[Universal Pictures]]. The company was founded by [[Tim Bevan]] and [[Sarah Radclyffe]] in 1983. It produces feature films and several television productions. [[Eric Fellner]] and Tim Bevan are now the co chairmen of the company.\n\n==Company==\nWorking Title Films was co founded by producers Tim Bevan and Sarah Radclyffe in 1983. In 1992, [[PolyGram]] became the company's corporate backer. Radclyffe left Working Title, and [[Eric Fellner]], a fellow [[independent film]] producer, joined the company.<ref name=\"The producers\">{{cite news|title=Interview: Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan, co-chairmen Working Title Films|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/apr/16/business.hayfilmfestival2005|location=London|author=Higgins, Charlotte|date=16 April 2005|accessdate=31 July 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe company produced a variety of films for [[PolyGram]]'s London based production company, [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]]. An [[United Kingdom|Anglo]]-Dutch [[film studio]], PolyGram Films became a major Hollywood competitor. In 1998, [[Seagram]] sold the bulk of its library of PolyGram films released up until March 31, 1996 to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. \n\nIn 1999, PolyGram was sold to the Seagram company and merged with [[MCA Records|MCA Music Entertainment]], to form [[Universal Music Group]]. PolyGram Films was sold and folded into [[Universal Pictures]] in 1999. Although contractually allowed to produce any film with a budget of up to $35 million, on a practical basis, Bevan and Fellner consult with studio executives at Working Title's parent company [[NBCUniversal]].<ref name=skillset>{{Cite web|authorlink=http://www.skillset.org|title=Working Title \u2013 Skillset|work=The Guardian|url=http://www.skillset.org/film/stories/production/article_3457_1.asp}}</ref> \n\nWorking Title is headquartered in [[London]], and has an office in [[Los Angeles]], which is headed by producer [[Liza Chasin]].\n\n===WT<sup>2</sup> Productions===\nIn 1999, Bevan and Fellner launched a subsidiary company named Working Title 2 Productions, commonly known as WT<sup>2</sup>.
