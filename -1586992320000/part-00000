The clip was directed by Grady Hall ([[Beck]], [[Modest Mouse]]). In the video, the song fuels a mash-up of the past 100 years of dance, presided over by the band at the newly restored Los Angeles Theater in downtown [[Los Angeles]]. The video featured work from [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]-nominated choreographer Mandy Moore. The video was nominated for two 2013 MTV Video Music Awards: Best Art Direction and Best Visual Effects.

The video features appearances from [[Darren Criss]], Shannon Woodward, and Channing Holmes. The story tells of a zebra (Merchant), who has been forbidden from a club called The Kangaroo Court. Attempting entry disguised as a horse, he falls for a lapdog (Woodward). Her date that night, a bulldog (Criss), becomes jealous and reveals the zebra for who he actually is. The zebra is placed under arrest for his crime and sent to court to face a kangaroo judge (Holmes). He is found guilty immediately and is executed by lion (Simonian).\n\nThe band was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Music Video.\n\nCapital Cities joined [[Katy Perry]] on the North American leg of her [[Prismatic World Tour]].\n\nIn April and May 2016, nearly three years after the release of the band's debut album, the official Capital Cities Facebook page made two posts strongly suggesting that new music was in the works.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eh-hem!

The clip was directed by Grady Hall ([[Beck]], [[Modest Mouse]]). In the video, the song fuels a mash-up of the past 100 years of dance, presided over by the band at the newly restored Los Angeles Theater in downtown [[Los Angeles]]. The video featured work from [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]-nominated choreographer Mandy Moore. The video was nominated for two 2013 MTV Video Music Awards: Best Art Direction and Best Visual Effects.

The video features appearances from [[Darren Criss]], Shannon Woodward, and Channing Holmes. The story tells of a zebra (Merchant), who has been forbidden from a club called The Kangaroo Court. Attempting entry disguised as a horse, he falls for a lapdog (Woodward). Her date that night, a bulldog (Criss), becomes jealous and reveals the zebra for who he actually is. The zebra is placed under arrest for his crime and sent to court to face a kangaroo judge (Holmes). He is found guilty immediately and is executed by lion (Simonian).\n\nThe band was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Music Video.\n\nCapital Cities joined [[Katy Perry]] on the North American leg of her [[Prismatic World Tour]].\n\nIn April and May 2016, nearly three years after the release of the band's debut album, the official Capital Cities Facebook page made two posts strongly suggesting that new music was in the works.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eh-hem!

Again, it performed very well in the counter-insurgency operations that have kept the Indian Army busy ever since independence.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n<ref>http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india</ref>\n\n==Battle cry==\nThe battle cry, adopted in 1955, in [[Hindi]], is ''\u091c\u093e\u091f \u092c\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0928, \u091c\u092f \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928'' ([[IAST]]: J\u0101t Balw\u0101n, Jai Bhagw\u0101n), which means ''\"The Jat is Powerful, Victory Be to God!\"''.\n\n==Regimental Battalions==\n[[Image:Jat Regiment Stamp.jpg|right|thumb|[[Commemorative stamp]] on [[envelope]] celebrating the Jat Regiment in [[uniform|army uniform]]s of the regiment, past and present.]]\n\nCurrently{{when|date=May 2012}} the regiment has 23 regular battalions, 4 Rastriya Rifles Battalions and 2 reserve battalions\n* 1st Battalion (now 2nd MECH)\n* 2nd Battalion (former 15th Jat)\n* 3rd Battalion (former [[10th Jats]]) (Battle of Dogri)\n* 4th Battalion\n* 5th Battalion (Phillora Captors)\n* 6th Battalion\n* 7th Battalion (former 11th Jat)\n* 8th Battalion\n* 9th Battalion\n* 11th Battalion\n* 12th Battalion \n* 14th Battalion\n* 15th Battalion \n* 16th Battalion\n* 17th Battalion (Kargil)\n* 18th Battalion\n* 19th Battalion\n* 20th Battalion\n* 21st Battalion\n* 22nd Battalion\n* 23rd Battalion\n* 5th  Battalion of the Rastriya Rifles\n* 34th Battalion of the Rastriya Rifles\n* 45th Battalion of the Rastriya Rifles\n* 61st Battalion of the Rastriya Rifles\n* 114 Infantry Battalion (TA) Jat\n* 151 Infantry Battalion (TA) Jat\n\n\nIn 1979 the 1st Battalion was converted to the 2nd Battalion [[Mechanised Infantry Regiment]]\n\n==Gallantry awards==\n\n===Battle honours===\n\n'''Pre-1947'''\n\n*[[Nagpur]] & [[Afghanistan]], 1839\n*Ghuznee ([[Ghazni]], [[Ali Masjid]] & [[Kandahar]]), 1842\n*Cabool ([[Kabul]]), 1842\n*[[Maharajpore]], [[Sobraon]], [[Mooltan]], Goojrat ([[Gujarat]]), [[Punjab]] & [[China]], 1858\u201359\n*Kandahar 1880\n*[[Burma]] 1885\u201387\n*Afghanistan 1879\u201380\n*China 1900\n*La Bass\u00e9e 1914\n*[[Festubert]] 1914\u201315\n*[[Shaiba]], [[Ctesiphon]], [[Khan al Baghdadi]] & [[Kut al Amara]], 1915\n*[[Neuve-Chapelle]], [[France]] & [[Flanders]], 1914\u201315\n*Kut al Amara 1916\n*[[Mesopotamia]] 1914\u201318\n*[[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u201355)|North-West Frontier Province]] 1914\u201315 & 1917\n*Afghanistan 1919\n*Razabil & Burma, 1942\u201345\n*[[Jitra]], Kanglatongbi & Malaya, 1941\u201342\n*Ninshigum, the Muars & North Africa, 1940\u201343\n\n'''Post-1947'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianarmy.nic.in/Site/FormTemplete/frmTemp1P2C_1.aspx?MnId=49NLYACokE9IvWgtpZnxLA==&ParentID=PLgHlC1zCW5u9Blp1rRWrA==|title=Official Website of Indian Army|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Zoji La]] & [[Rajauri]], 1947\n*[[Jammu and Kashmir]] 1947-48\n*Phillora & Dograi 1965\n*Jammu and Kashmir & [[East Pakistan]] 1971\n\n===Unit Citations===\nWhen a unit is decorated for counter-insurgency operations, unit citations are given instead of battle or theatre honours.\n\n*4th battalion, [[Nagaland]] 1995\n*7th battalion, J&K 1997, J&K 2003 & Operation Rhino 2016\n*11th battalion, [[Indian Army operations in Jammu and Kashmir#Operation Rakshak|Operation Rakshak]] 2011\n*34th battalion [[Rashtriya Rifles]], J&K 1997\n*17th battalion, [[Operation Vijay (1999)|Operation Vijay]] 1999\n*16th battalion, Operation Rakshak 2005 & 2011\n*21st battalion, Operation Rhino 2009\n*22nd Battalion (JAGUARS), Operation Rakshak 2018\n\n===Victoria Cross===\n*[[Risaldar]] [[Badlu Singh]], [[14th Murray's Jat Lancers]] attached to [[9th Deccan Horse|29th Lancers (Deccan Horse)]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] 1918.<ref name=\"wewerethere.defencedynamics.mod.uk\"/><ref>[http://faculty.winthrop.edu/haynese/india/medals/VC/1BSingh.html Risaldar Badlu Singh, VC<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711133342/http://faculty.winthrop.edu/haynese/india/medals/VC/1BSingh.html |date=July 11, 2007 }}</ref>\n*[[Havildar]] [[Abdul Hafiz, VC|Abdul Hafiz]], [[9th Jat Regiment]], [[Imphal]] 1944.<ref name=\"wewerethere.defencedynamics.mod.uk\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.wewerethere.defencedynamics.mod.uk/wewerethere_old/vcwin.html |title=We Were There - Medals and Awards - Victoria Cross Winners<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002102633/http://www.wewerethere.defencedynamics.mod.uk/wewerethere_old/vcwin.html |archive-date=2008-10-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Maha Vir Chakra===\n* [[Brig.]] (later Lt.

Dietz resigned after the 1976 championship and allowed Mike Kelly to take over. Kelly kept the team performing at a high level but finished runner up two years running before reclaiming the title in 1979. Canisius join a new conference the following year and after claiming the championship, their fourth in a six-year span, the program was elevated to [[Varsity team|varsity status]].\n\nWith a new division to play in Canisius also received a new coach in [[Brian Cavanaugh (ice hockey)|Brian Cavanaugh]]. Their first two seasons in [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] went well for the Golden Griffins but when Cavanaugh took a year off in 1982 the program slumped to single-digit wins before rebounding after the coach's return. During Cavanaugh's tenure he kept the team mostly above .500 and aside from a dip in the early 1990s Canisius was a contender for the [[ECAC West]] crown most years.<ref name = results>{{cite web |url=https://www.uscho.com/stats/history/canisius/mens-hockey/|title=Canisius Men's Hockey Team History|publisher=USCHO.com|accessdate=September 10, 2018}}</ref> Canisius was able to reach two ECAC West title game in the '90s but lost both contests by one goal.\n\n===Division I===\nWhen the [[Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference|MAAC]] announced it was forming an ice hockey division in 1997 only three member teams had extant programs, one of those was Canisius who became a founding member of the league that began play in [[1998\u201399 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season|1998\u201399]]. The Golden Griffins played well in their first season, finishing with a winning record, but it was their play in the conference tournament, allowing them to reach the title match, that made Canisius stand out. Unfortunately that was the height of Canisius' time in the MAAC. Despite a 20-win season the following year the Griffs were bounced in the first round and won only one MAAC playoff game after their inaugural year in D-I.\n\nWhen two of the MAAC's teams ended their ice hockey sponsorship in 2003 the conference was able to end its support for the hockey division. The remaining nine schools simply reformed into a new conference called [[Atlantic Hockey]] and continued on without much trouble. Canisius' trouble in the conference tournament continued throughout the decade and saw them win two out of their first ten games. During that streak, however, the Canisius program went through some upheaval. Long-time coach Brian Cavanaugh came under fire for his conduct through complaints from his players. In December of 2004 he was fired when players threatened to sit out a game and he was soon replaced by assistant [[Clancy Seymour]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Cavanaugh Out at Canisius|url=http://www.uscho.com/2004/12/10/cavanaugh-out-at-canisius/|publisher=USCHO.com|date=2004-12-10|accessdate=2014-08-14}}</ref> The following season began with yet a third coach, [[Dave Smith (ice hockey)|Dave Smith]] and it took the new bench boss a few years to repair the program.\n\nIn [[2009\u201310 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season|2009\u201310]] Canisius posted its first winning season in nine years and reach the conference semifinal. After a couple of modest seasons the Golden Griffins shocked Atlantic Hockey by winning the [[2013 Atlantic Hockey Tournament|2013 Tournament]] as a 7th-seed and made its first appearance in the [[2013 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. The Golden Griffins played well but bowed out in their first game against top-seeded [[Quinnipiac Bobcats men's ice hockey|Quinnipiac]].

(NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[college ice hockey]] program that represents [[Canisius College]]. The Golden Griffins are a member of [[Atlantic Hockey]]. They play at the [[LECOM Harborcenter]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] across the street from [[KeyBank Center]], home of the [[Buffalo Sabres]] of the [[National Hockey League]].<ref>{{cite web|work=U.S. College Hockey Online|url=http://www.uscho.com/team/canisius/mens-hockey/|title=Canisius Golden Griffins Men's Hockey|accessdate=April 10, 2011}}</ref> Canisius won an automatic bid to the 2013 NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship after winning the Atlantic Hockey title in the conference playoffs, but lost in the first round to top-ranked Quinnipiac.<ref>http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/9116119/quinnipiac-rallies-canisius-east-regional-semifinals</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nCanisius founded their hockey team, then known as the Ice Griffs, in the fall of 1971 as a [[College club sports in the United States|club sport]] led by Dr. David Dietz.<ref name = guide>{{cite web |url=https://issuu.com/canisius_athletics/docs/1112canisiushockeymediaguide|title=Canisius Men's Hockey 2010-11 Media Guide|publisher=Canisius Golden Griffins|accessdate=September 10, 2018}}</ref> Two years later they joined their first conference and by 1976 had claimed two conference titles. Dietz resigned after the 1976 championship and allowed Mike Kelly to take over. Kelly kept the team performing at a high level but finished runner up two years running before reclaiming the title in 1979. Canisius join a new conference the following year and after claiming the championship, their fourth in a six-year span, the program was elevated to [[Varsity team|varsity status]].\n\nWith a new division to play in Canisius also received a new coach in [[Brian Cavanaugh (ice hockey)|Brian Cavanaugh]]. Their first two seasons in [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] went well for the Golden Griffins but when Cavanaugh took a year off in 1982 the program slumped to single-digit wins before rebounding after the coach's return. During Cavanaugh's tenure he kept the team mostly above .500 and aside from a dip in the early 1990s Canisius was a contender for the [[ECAC West]] crown most years.<ref name = results>{{cite web |url=https://www.uscho.com/stats/history/canisius/mens-hockey/|title=Canisius Men's Hockey Team History|publisher=USCHO.com|accessdate=September 10, 2018}}</ref> Canisius was able to reach two ECAC West title game in the '90s but lost both contests by one goal.\n\n===Division I===\nWhen the [[Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference|MAAC]] announced it was forming an ice hockey division in 1997 only three member teams had extant programs, one of those was Canisius who became a founding member of the league that began play in [[1998\u201399 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season|1998\u201399]]. The Golden Griffins played well in their first season, finishing with a winning record, but it was their play in the conference tournament, allowing them to reach the title match, that made Canisius stand out. Unfortunately that was the height of Canisius' time in the MAAC. Despite a 20-win season the following year the Griffs were bounced in the first round and won only one MAAC playoff game after their inaugural year in D-I.\n\nWhen two of the MAAC's teams ended their ice hockey sponsorship in 2003 the conference was able to end its support for the hockey division. The remaining nine schools simply reformed into a new conference called [[Atlantic Hockey]] and continued on without much trouble. Canisius' trouble in the conference tournament continued throughout the decade and saw them win two out of their first ten games. During that streak, however, the Canisius program went through some upheaval. Long-time coach Brian Cavanaugh came under fire for his conduct through complaints from his players. In December of 2004 he was fired when players threatened to sit out a game and he was soon replaced by assistant [[Clancy Seymour]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Cavanaugh Out at Canisius|url=http://www.uscho.com/2004/12/10/cavanaugh-out-at-canisius/|publisher=USCHO.com|date=2004-12-10|accessdate=2014-08-14}}</ref>. The following season began with yet a third coach, [[Dave Smith (ice hockey)|Dave Smith]] and it took the new bench boss a few years to repair the program.\n\nIn [[2009\u201310 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season|2009\u201310]] Canisius posted its first winning season in nine years and reach the conference semifinal. After a couple of modest seasons the Golden Griffins shocked Atlantic Hockey by winning the [[2013 Atlantic Hockey Tournament|2013 Tournament]] as a 7th-seed and made its first appearance in the [[2013 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. The Golden Griffins played well but bowed out in their first game against top-seeded [[Quinnipiac Bobcats men's ice hockey|Quinnipiac]]. Over the next few years Smith pushed the program to better results, culminating in their first conference title in [[2016\u201317 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season|2017]]. Smith was hired away by [[RPI Engineers men's ice hockey|Rensselaer]] soon after<ref>{{cite news|title=Rensselaer Unveils Canisius Smith As Head Coach|url=http://www.uscho.com/2017/04/06/rensselaer-unveils-canisius-smith-as-head-coach/|publisher=USCHO.com|date=2017-04-06|accessdate=2018-09-11}}</ref> but the Golden Griffins continue to perform well under new coach [[Trevor Large]].\n\n==Season-by-season results<ref name = results></ref>==\n\n{{Main article|List of Canisius Golden Griffins men's ice hockey seasons}}\n\n==Awards and honors<ref name = awards>{{cite web |url= https://s3.amazonaws.com/sidearm.sites/canisius.sidearmsports.com/documents/2018/7/11/2017_18_Hockey_Record_Book_Awards_pages.pdf|title = Canisius Golden Griffins Awards |publisher = Canisius Golden Griffins | accessdate =2018-09-13}}</ref>==\n\n===NCAA===\n'''[[List of Division I AHCA All-American Teams|AHCA First Team All-Americans]]'''\n*2016-17: [[Charles Williams (ice hockey)|Charles Williams]], G\n\n\n===MAAC===\n====Individual Awards====\n'''[[List of MAAC Goaltender of the Year|MAAC Goaltender of the Year]]'''\n*[[Sean Weaver]]: 2000\n\n====All-Conference Teams====\n'''[[List of MAAC Awards|First Team All-MAAC]]'''\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*1998\u201399: [[Derek Gilham]], D\n*1999\u201300: [[Sean Weaver]], G\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''[[List of MAAC Awards|Second Team All-MAAC]]'''\n*1998\u201399: [[David Deeves]], F\n\n'''[[List of MAAC Awards|MAAC All-Rookie Team]]'''\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*1998\u201399:[[Joel Tarvudd]], D;

These medications, including [[fluconazole]] and [[ketoconazole]], are \"not effective in 15\u201320% of cases\"<ref name=\":0\" /> against ''C. glabrata''.  It is still highly vulnerable to polyene medications such as [[amphotericin B]] and [[nystatin]], along with variable vulnerability to [[flucytosine]] and [[caspofungin]]. However, intravenous amphotericin B is a medication of last resort, causing among other side effects, chronic [[kidney failure]].  Amphotericin B vaginal suppositories are used as an effective form of treatment in combination with boric acid capsules as they are not absorbed into the bloodstream.\n\nA first-line treatment for vaginal infections may be the use of [[terconazole]] 7-day cream. Several courses may be needed. The cure-rate for this treatment is approximately 40%. Recurrences are common, causing chronic infections and spread to other areas such as skin and scalp. Blood infections might be best assessed per symptoms if other areas are involved.\n\nAn experimental, but effective second-line treatment for chronic infections, is the use of [[boric acid]]. Compounding pharmacies can create [[boric acid]] vaginal suppositories. Use of [[Vitamin E]] oil may be used in conjunction to combat irritation. [[Amphotericin B]] vaginal suppositories have also been used in case studies to treat chronic infections, both symptomatic and asymptomatic. [[Borax]] and [[boric acid]] may be used for persistent scalp and skin infections.\n\n== Phylogenetic relationship ==\n\nThe currently assigned genus name of ''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida]]'' can lead to confusion. Compared with other potential pathogens of the genus (such as ''[[Candida albicans|C. albicans]]'' or ''[[Candida auris|C. auris]]''), ''C. glabrata'' is more closely related to ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]].'' In fact, ''C. glabrata'' belongs to the group of ''[[Nakaseomyces]]'' inside the [[Paleopolyploidy|whole genome duplication]] clade within [[Saccharomycetaceae]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gabald\u00f3n |first=Toni |last2=Martin |first2=Tiphaine |last3=Marcet-Houben |first3=Marina |last4=Durrens |first4=Pascal |last5=Bolotin-Fukuhara |first5=Monique |last6=Lespinet |first6=Olivier |last7=Arnaise |first7=Sylvie |last8=Boisnard |first8=St\u00e9phanie |last9=Aguileta |first9=Gabriela |last10=Atanasova |first10=Ralitsa |last11=Bouchier |first11=Christiane |date=2013-09-14 |title=Comparative genomics of emerging pathogens in the Candida glabrata clade |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=623 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-14-623 |issn=1471-2164 |pmc=3847288 |pmid=24034898}}</ref> The whole genome duplication event occurred about 90 million years ago, whereas phylogenetic studies indicate that the common ancestor between ''C. glabrata'' and ''C. albicans'' is dated between 200 and 300 million years ago.

These medications, including [[fluconazole]] and [[ketoconazole]], are \"not effective in 15\u201320% of cases\"<ref name=\":0\" /> against ''C. glabrata''.  It is still highly vulnerable to polyene medications such as [[amphotericin B]] and [[nystatin]], along with variable vulnerability to [[flucytosine]] and [[caspofungin]]. However, intravenous amphotericin B is a medication of last resort, causing among other side effects, chronic [[kidney failure]].  Amphotericin B vaginal suppositories are used as an effective form of treatment in combination with boric acid capsules as they are not absorbed into the bloodstream.\n\nA first-line treatment for vaginal infections may be the use of [[terconazole]] 7-day cream. Several courses may be needed. The cure-rate for this treatment is approximately 40%. Recurrences are common, causing chronic infections and spread to other areas such as skin and scalp. Blood infections might be best assessed per symptoms if other areas are involved.\n\nAn experimental, but effective second-line treatment for chronic infections, is the use of [[boric acid]]. Compounding pharmacies can create [[boric acid]] vaginal suppositories. Use of [[Vitamin E]] oil may be used in conjunction to combat irritation. [[Amphotericin B]] vaginal suppositories have also been used in case studies to treat chronic infections, both symptomatic and asymptomatic. [[Borax]] and [[boric acid]] may be used for persistent scalp and skin infections.\n\n== Phylogenetic relationship ==\n\nThe currently assigned genus name of ''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida]]'' can lead to confusion. Compared with other potential pathogens of the genus (such as ''[[Candida albicans|C. albicans]]'' or ''[[Candida auris|C. auris]]''), ''C. glabrata'' is more closely related to ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]].'' In fact, ''C. glabrata'' belongs to the group of ''[[Nakaseomyces]]'' inside the [[Paleopolyploidy|whole genome duplication]] clade within [[Saccharomycetaceae]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gabald\u00f3n |first=Toni |last2=Martin |first2=Tiphaine |last3=Marcet-Houben |first3=Marina |last4=Durrens |first4=Pascal |last5=Bolotin-Fukuhara |first5=Monique |last6=Lespinet |first6=Olivier |last7=Arnaise |first7=Sylvie |last8=Boisnard |first8=St\u00e9phanie |last9=Aguileta |first9=Gabriela |last10=Atanasova |first10=Ralitsa |last11=Bouchier |first11=Christiane |date=2013-09-14 |title=Comparative genomics of emerging pathogens in the Candida glabrata clade |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=623 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-14-623 |issn=1471-2164 |pmc=3847288 |pmid=24034898}}</ref>. The whole genome duplication event occurred about 90 million years ago, whereas phylogenetic studies indicate that the common ancestor between ''C. glabrata'' and ''C. albicans'' is dated between 200 and 300 million years ago. The largest phylogenetic study to date about ''[[Saccharomycotina]],'' also known as budding yeasts, indicated in 2018 that the (currently construed) genus ''Candida'' is found in [[Pichiaceae]], CUG-Ser1 clade, Phaffomycetaceae and [[Saccharomycetaceae]]. Consequently, despite that the name ''Candida'' evokes a unitary notion of [[candidiasis]], the pathogenic power of some budding yeasts is a [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] trait shared by several subphyla with different kinds of metabolism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shen|first=Xing-Xing|last2=Opulente|first2=Dana A.|last3=Kominek|first3=Jacek|last4=Zhou|first4=Xiaofan|last5=Steenwyk|first5=Jacob L.|last6=Buh|first6=Kelly V.|last7=Haase|first7=Max A.

Cancellations come in a huge variety of designs, shapes, sizes and colors. Modern cancellations commonly include the date and post office location where the stamps were mailed, in addition to lines or bars designed to cover the stamp itself.  The term \"postal marking\" sometimes is used to refer specifically to the part that contains the date and posting location, although the term often is used interchangeably with \"cancellation.\"<ref>L.N. Williams, ''Fundamentals of Philately'' (American Philatelic Society, State College, PA rev. ed. 1990) p. 20.</ref>  The portion of a cancellation that is designed to deface the stamp and does not contain writing is also called the \"'''obliteration'''\"<ref name=\"scott1\">[[#Scott US|Scott US]] p. 30A.</ref>  or '''[[Killer (philately)|killer]]'''. Some stamps are issued  '''pre-cancelled''' with a printed or stamped cancellation and do not need to have a cancellation added.  Cancellations can affect the value of stamps to collectors, positively or negatively. The cancellations of some countries have been extensively studied by [[philatelists]] and many stamp collectors and postal history collectors collect cancellations in addition to the stamps themselves.\n\n==History==\nThe first adhesive [[postage stamp]] was the [[Penny Black]], issued in 1840 by [[Postage stamps and postal history of Great Britain|Great Britain]].  The postal authorities recognized there must be a method for preventing reuse of the stamps and simultaneously issued handstamps for use to apply cancellations to the stamps on the envelopes as they passed through the postal system.<ref name=\"sg_p42\">[[#Stanley Gibbons|Stanley Gibbons]], p. 42.</ref>  The cancels were handmade and depicted a [[Maltese cross]] design.  Initially, the ink used was red, but it was found that this could be cleaned off and the stamps reused, and so after a series of experiments, early in 1841 black cancelling ink was used, which was more permanent. The color of the stamps was also changed to red-brown so as to ensure that the cancellation showed clearly.<ref name=\"sg_p42\"/>\n\nBritain soon abandoned the Maltese crosses and in 1844 began to employ cancellations displaying numbers which referred to the location of mailing.<ref>[[#Stanley Gibbons|Stanley Gibbons]], pp. 51-55.</ref>  A similar scheme was used for British stamps used abroad in its colonies and foreign postal services, with locations being assigned a specific letter followed by a number, such as A01 used in Kingston, Jamaica, or D22 for Venezuela.<ref>Stanely Gibbons, ''Stamp Catalogue, Part 1, British Commonwealth 1987'', London & Ringwood (89th ed. 1986), pp. GB65-GB72.</ref>\n\n[[File:US stamp 1851 3c Washington.jpg|upright|thumb|An 1851 U.S. stamp with a [[pen cancel]]lation.]]\nEarly cancellations were all applied by hand, commonly using hand stamps.  Where hand stamps were not available, stamps often were cancelled by marking over the stamp with pen, such as writing an \"x\".  Pen cancellations were used in the United States into the 1880s,<ref name=\"scott2\">[[#Scott US|Scott US]] p. 29A.</ref>  and in a sense continue to this day, when a postal clerk notices a stamp has escaped cancellation and marks it with a ball point pen or [[marker pen|marker]].\n\n[[File:Sicily13.JPG|thumb|upright|1859 stamp of Sicily with deferential cancellation designed not to deface the \"sacred image\" of [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand II]]<ref>Franco Filanci, ''Lettera & Francobollo: Raccontiamola giusta'' Reggiani, Italy 2008, p. 16.</ref>]]\n\nIn the early period of the issuance of postage stamps in the United States a number of [[patent]]s were issued for cancelling devices or machines that increased (or were purported to increase) the difficulty of washing off and reusing postage stamps.  These methods generally involved the scraping or cutting-away of part of the stamp, or perhaps punching a hole through its middle.  (These forms of cancellation must be distinguished from [[perfins]], a series of small holes punched in stamps, typically by private companies as an anti-theft device.)\n\nHigh speed cancellation machines were first used in Boston between 1880\u20131890 and subsequently throughout the country.<ref name=\"scott2\"/>\n\nToday, cancellations may either be applied by hand or machine.  Hand cancellation is often used when sending unusually shaped mail or formal mail (e.g., wedding invitations) to avoid damage caused by machine cancellation.\n\nPostal meter stamps and similar modern printed to order stamps are not ordinarily cancelled by postal authorities because such stamps bear the date produced and can not readily be re-used.\n\n==Types of cancellations==\n* '''[[Socked on the nose|Bullseye cancellation]]''' also called \"Socked on the nose\" or SOTN, is a stamp collector's term for a cancellation, typically of circular design, centered on the postage stamp. Such cancellations are popular with some stamp collectors because of their neatness and the fact that the time, date, and location where the stamp was used may be readily seen. The prevalence of bulls-eye cancellations varies considerably by country and time period.\n* '''[[Cancelled-to-order]]'''.  Cancelled-to-order stamps, also known as CTOs, are stamps that have been cancelled by a postal authority, but were never used to transmit mail. CTOs are created by postal authorities to sell the stamps cheaply to stamp collectors.  Many Eastern European countries and others sold great numbers of CTOs to collectors in the 1950s - 1990s strictly for revenue.  CTOs often may be identified as the stamps still retain their original gum.  Some authorities use the same canceller for all CTOs, and apply it very neatly in the corner of four stamps at one time. In some instances, the \"cancellations\" are actually printed as part of the stamp itself.\n* '''Deferential cancellation''' is a cancellation designed so as not to deface the image of the ruler or regent on the stamp.<ref>[http://www.askphil.org/b25d.htm Glossary of Stamp Collecting Terms] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412204318/http://127.0.0.1/ |date=2012-04-12 }}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Canada37.jpg|upright|thumb|Fancy cancel on 1872 Canada stamp]]\n* A '''[[duplex cancel]]''' includes a postmark as well as the cancellation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://glossary.usstamps.org/glossary5.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913192456/http://glossary.usstamps.org/glossary5.html |archivedate=2007-09-13 }}</ref>\n* '''[[Fancy cancels]]'''.  In the second half of the 19th century, many postmasters in the United States and Canada cut their own cancelers from [[Cork (material)|cork]] or wood in a great variety of designs such as stars, circles, flags, chickens, etc.  These are known as fancy cancels and have been heavily studied by philatelists and collectors.<ref name=\"scott2\"/>  One of the most famous is the \"kicking mule\" used in the 1880s.<ref>Lee Henry Cornell, ''The tale of the kicking mule; a handbook dealing with the famous kicking mule cancellation used in several western towns in the \"eighties\"'' (Printcraft Shop, Wichita 1949).</ref>\n* '''[[First day of issue]]''' are special cancellations with the date the stamp was first issued for sale and the words \"first day of issue.\"\n* '''Flag cancellations''' are a type of machine cancellation incorporating  a design of the United States flag with the stripes serving as the \"killer\".  The first machine flag cancel (preceded by fancy cancels of flags) was used in Boston in November\u2013December 1894.<ref name=\"scott2\"/>\n* '''Handstamped cancellations''' are cancellations added by means of a hand stamping device.\n* '''Highway post office cancels''' refers to cancels added in transit by portable mail-handling equipment for sorting mail in trucks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.linns.com/insights/glossary-of-philatelic-terms.html|title=Glossary of Stamp-Collecting Terms For New Collectors - Linns.com|website=Linn's Stamp News}}</ref>\n* '''[[Machine postmark|Machine cancellations]]''' are automatically added by machines that rapidly process large numbers of envelopes.

For the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], which started using numerals in 1844, the shape of bars indicate the actual country of use. Numerals were also used in combination with a datestamp in duplex cancellations.\n* '''[[Pen cancel]]s''' refer to the use of a writing [[pen]] to deface the stamp, and were more common in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n* '''Pictorial cancellations''' include images associated with the commemoration of some event or anniversary.

In this way, the corporation can automatically print promotional messages on each envelope while simultaneously cancelling the piece of mail. Messages change throughout the year, and include seasonal messages (\"Merry Christmas / Joyeux Noel\") and promotional messages (such as Canada Post's web address).\n\nOther post offices such as the [[Isle of Man Post|Isle of Man Philatelic Bureau]] also create special pictorial cancellations as they did in 1985 to mark the anniversary of the aircraft Douglas [[DC-3]].  A special handstamp was created <ref name=LS-13-12-1985 >Top-flight honour for schoolboy - Front Page - Lincolnshire Standard - 13 December 1985</ref> depicting a Dakota flying \"free\" and not \"boxed in\".<ref>Special Dakota Cover Inside Information Card - [[Isle of Man Post|Isle of Man Philatelic Bureau]] - 17 December 1985</ref>\n\n==Collectors==\nGeneralist stamp collectors usually prefer '''lightly cancelled''' stamps which have the postmark on a corner or small portion of the stamp without obscuring the stamp itself, which ordinarily are more valuable than '''heavily-cancelled stamps'''.<ref>See, e.g., [[Scott Catalogue]], note preceding Great Britain listings.</ref>  In order to get the postal clerk to cancel the stamps lightly, collectors may rubber-stamp or write \"philatelic mail\" on the envelope.\n\nCancellations may significantly affect the value of the stamps.  Many stamps are rarer, and consequently much more expensive, in unused condition, such as the Penny Black, which in 1999, catalogued for $1,900 mint and $110 used.<ref>[[Scott Catalogue]], Great Britain, no. 1.</ref>  The reverse is true for some stamps, such as the hyperinflation stamps of [[Postage stamps and postal history of Germany|Germany]], which may be worth many times more if genuinely postally used.<ref name=\"catalogue1\">[[Scott Catalogue]], Germany, no. 161-321 and note preceding no.161.</ref>  Where stamps are much more valuable in used condition than unused, it may be advisable to  have such stamps [[Expertization|expertised]] to confirm that the cancellation is genuine and contemporary.<ref name=\"catalogue1\"/>\n\nSome stamp collectors are interested in the cancellations themselves, on or off cover, of a particular country or issue, or collect a specific type of cancellation, such as fancy cancels. Birth date cancels are also collected.<ref>See External Links: Other, below</ref> There have been many published studies of the cancellations of many countries, some of which are listed below.  Collectors who are interested in the cancellations themselves prefer bold, readable cancellations.  Cancellations also are an integral part of the collection of [[postal history]]. \n\nHistorically, collectors disliked pen cancels and removed many of them, making the stamp appear unused or to add a fake cancellation.<ref name=\"scott2\"/>  Today, early United States pen cancelled stamps still are worth considerably less than examples with  hand stamped cancels.<ref>See, e.g, [[#Scott US|Scott US]] values for nos. 1-39.</ref>\n\nCollectors generally view modern cancelled-to-order stamps or CTOs as philatelic junk, and they rarely have any significant value.<ref>{{cite web |title=Postmarks |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url=http://www.linns.com/reference/postmark/basic_postmarks.aspx |accessdate=June 26, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318065946/http://www.linns.com/reference/postmark/basic_postmarks.aspx |archivedate=March 18, 2015}}</ref>  Stamp catalogs commonly state whether their values for used stamps are for CTOs or for postally used examples.  For example, the Scott Catalog used value listings for the German Democratic Republic are for CTOs from 1950 through mid-1990, over 2700 stamps.<ref>''Scott 1999 Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue, Vol. 3'' Germany listings, note preceding no. 68.</ref>\n\n==Forgeries==\n{{main|Philatelic fakes and forgeries}}\nForgers have not only manufactured stamps for the philatelic market, they have added forged cancellations to those stamps.  This was especially common in the late 19th century and early 20th century, when huge numbers of inexpensive stamps were forged for the packet trade.<ref>See generally, [[Robert Brisco Ear\u00e9e|R.B. Ear\u00e9e]], ''Album Weeds; How to Detect Forged Stamps'' (3d Ed. reprint, Manuka-Ainslie Press, Acton, Canberra n.d.).</ref>\n\nForged cancellations have also been applied to genuine stamps, in cases where the stamps are worth much more postally used.  In addition, where rare cancellations are desired by collectors, those cancellations have also been forged.\n\nCancellations may also be used to prove that certain philatelic items are genuine.  For example, forgers have fabricated many supposedly valuable postal covers by adding genuine stamps and forged postal markings to pre-stamp covers.<ref>See, e.g., Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Brun, ''Out-Foxing the Fakers'' (American Philatelic Society, State College, PA 1993), Chapter 6.</ref>  A cover can be shown to be genuine if a genuine cancellation \"ties\" the stamp or stamps to the cover; that is, if a genuine cancellation runs continuously over the stamp and adjacent portion of the envelope, although one still may need to rule out the possibility that the cancellation was added later.  Similarly, stamps that were cut in parts and used for a portion of the full value as [[Bisects and splits (philately)|splits]] can only be shown to have been so used if a genuine cancel ties the stamp to the cover or piece of cover.\n\n==Studies of cancellations==\n'''Great Britain, Ireland & Commonwealth'''\n* R.C.

Cancellations come in a huge variety of designs, shapes, sizes and colors. Modern cancellations commonly include the date and post office location where the stamps were mailed, in addition to lines or bars designed to cover the stamp itself.  The term \"postal marking\" sometimes is used to refer specifically to the part that contains the date and posting location, although the term often is used interchangeably with \"cancellation.\"<ref>L.N. Williams, ''Fundamentals of Philately'' (American Philatelic Society, State College, PA rev. ed. 1990) p. 20.</ref>  The portion of a cancellation that is designed to deface the stamp and does not contain writing is also called the \"'''obliteration'''\"<ref name=\"scott1\">[[#Scott US|Scott US]] p. 30A.</ref>  or '''[[Killer (philately)|killer]]'''. Some stamps are issued  '''pre-cancelled''' with a printed or stamped cancellation and do not need to have a cancellation added.  Cancellations can affect the value of stamps to collectors, positively or negatively. The cancellations of some countries have been extensively studied by [[philatelists]] and many stamp collectors and postal history collectors collect cancellations in addition to the stamps themselves.\n\n==History==\nThe first adhesive [[postage stamp]] was the [[Penny Black]], issued in 1840 by [[Postage stamps and postal history of Great Britain|Great Britain]].  The postal authorities recognized there must be a method for preventing reuse of the stamps and simultaneously issued handstamps for use to apply cancellations to the stamps on the envelopes as they passed through the postal system.<ref name=\"sg_p42\">[[#Stanley Gibbons|Stanley Gibbons]], p. 42.</ref>  The cancels were handmade and depicted a [[Maltese cross]] design.  Initially, the ink used was red, but it was found that this could be cleaned off and the stamps reused, and so after a series of experiments, early in 1841 black cancelling ink was used, which was more permanent. The color of the stamps was also changed to red-brown so as to ensure that the cancellation showed clearly.<ref name=\"sg_p42\"/>\n\nBritain soon abandoned the Maltese crosses and in 1844 began to employ cancellations displaying numbers which referred to the location of mailing.<ref>[[#Stanley Gibbons|Stanley Gibbons]], pp. 51-55.</ref>  A similar scheme was used for British stamps used abroad in its colonies and foreign postal services, with locations being assigned a specific letter followed by a number, such as A01 used in Kingston, Jamaica, or D22 for Venezuela.<ref>Stanely Gibbons, ''Stamp Catalogue, Part 1, British Commonwealth 1987'', London & Ringwood (89th ed. 1986), pp. GB65-GB72.</ref>\n\n[[File:US stamp 1851 3c Washington.jpg|upright|thumb|An 1851 U.S. stamp with a [[pen cancel]]lation.]]\nEarly cancellations were all applied by hand, commonly using hand stamps.  Where hand stamps were not available, stamps often were cancelled by marking over the stamp with pen, such as writing an \"x\".  Pen cancellations were used in the United States into the 1880s,<ref name=\"scott2\">[[#Scott US|Scott US]] p. 29A.</ref>  and in a sense continue to this day, when a postal clerk notices a stamp has escaped cancellation and marks it with a ball point pen or [[marker pen|marker]].\n\n[[File:Sicily13.JPG|thumb|upright|1859 stamp of Sicily with deferential cancellation designed not to deface the \"sacred image\" of [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand II]]<ref>Franco Filanci, ''Lettera & Francobollo: Raccontiamola giusta'' Reggiani, Italy 2008, p. 16.</ref>]]\n\nIn the early period of the issuance of postage stamps in the United States a number of [[patent]]s were issued for cancelling devices or machines that increased (or were purported to increase) the difficulty of washing off and reusing postage stamps.  These methods generally involved the scraping or cutting-away of part of the stamp, or perhaps punching a hole through its middle.  (These forms of cancellation must be distinguished from [[perfins]], a series of small holes punched in stamps, typically by private companies as an anti-theft device.)\n\nHigh speed cancellation machines were first used in Boston between 1880\u20131890 and subsequently throughout the country.<ref name=\"scott2\"/>\n\nToday, cancellations may either be applied by hand or machine.  Hand cancellation is often used when sending unusually shaped mail or formal mail (e.g., wedding invitations) to avoid damage caused by machine cancellation.\n\nPostal meter stamps and similar modern printed to order stamps are not ordinarily cancelled by postal authorities because such stamps bear the date produced and can not readily be re-used.\n\n==Types of cancellations==\n* '''[[Socked on the nose|Bullseye cancellation]]''' also called \"Socked on the nose\" or SOTN, is a stamp collector's term for a cancellation, typically of circular design, centered on the postage stamp. Such cancellations are popular with some stamp collectors because of their neatness and the fact that the time, date, and location where the stamp was used may be readily seen. The prevalence of bulls-eye cancellations varies considerably by country and time period.\n* '''[[Cancelled-to-order]]'''.  Cancelled-to-order stamps, also known as CTOs, are stamps that have been cancelled by a postal authority, but were never used to transmit mail. CTOs are created by postal authorities to sell the stamps cheaply to stamp collectors.  Many Eastern European countries and others sold great numbers of CTOs to collectors in the 1950s - 1990s strictly for revenue.  CTOs often may be identified as the stamps still retain their original gum.  Some authorities use the same canceller for all CTOs, and apply it very neatly in the corner of four stamps at one time. In some instances, the \"cancellations\" are actually printed as part of the stamp itself.\n* '''Deferential cancellation''' is a cancellation designed so as not to deface the image of the ruler or regent on the stamp.<ref>[http://www.askphil.org/b25d.htm Glossary of Stamp Collecting Terms] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412204318/http://127.0.0.1/ |date=2012-04-12 }}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Canada37.jpg|upright|thumb|Fancy cancel on 1872 Canada stamp]]\n* A '''[[duplex cancel]]''' includes a postmark as well as the cancellation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://glossary.usstamps.org/glossary5.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913192456/http://glossary.usstamps.org/glossary5.html |archivedate=2007-09-13 }}</ref>\n* '''[[Fancy cancels]]'''.  In the second half of the 19th century, many postmasters in the United States and Canada cut their own cancelers from [[Cork (material)|cork]] or wood in a great variety of designs such as stars, circles, flags, chickens, etc.  These are known as fancy cancels and have been heavily studied by philatelists and collectors.<ref name=\"scott2\"/>  One of the most famous is the \"kicking mule\" used in the 1880s.<ref>Lee Henry Cornell, ''The tale of the kicking mule; a handbook dealing with the famous kicking mule cancellation used in several western towns in the \"eighties\"'' (Printcraft Shop, Wichita 1949).</ref>\n* '''[[First day of issue]]''' are special cancellations with the date the stamp was first issued for sale and the words \"first day of issue.\"\n* '''Flag cancellations''' are a type of machine cancellation incorporating  a design of the United States flag with the stripes serving as the \"killer\".  The first machine flag cancel (preceded by fancy cancels of flags) was used in Boston in November\u2013December 1894.<ref name=\"scott2\"/>\n* '''Handstamped cancellations''' are cancellations added by means of a hand stamping device.\n* '''Highway post office cancels''' refers to cancels added in transit by portable mail-handling equipment for sorting mail in trucks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.linns.com/insights/glossary-of-philatelic-terms.html|title=Glossary of Stamp-Collecting Terms For New Collectors - Linns.com|website=Linn's Stamp News}}</ref>\n* '''[[Machine postmark|Machine cancellations]]''' are automatically added by machines that rapidly process large numbers of envelopes.  A 1903 silent film of an operating cancelling machine may be seen [http://memory.loc.gov/mbrs/awal/0870.mpg here].\n* '''Mute cancel''' refers to a cancellation that includes no writing and thus \"does not speak.\"\n* '''Numeral cancels''' are cancels whereby number were used to identify specific post offices. For the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], which started using numerals in 1844, the shape of bars indicate the actual country of use. Numerals were also used in combination with a datestamp in duplex cancellations.\n* '''[[Pen cancel]]s''' refer to the use of a writing [[pen]] to deface the stamp, and were more common in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n* '''Pictorial cancellations''' include images associated with the commemoration of some event or anniversary.  Some people attempt to use stamps relating to the theme of a pictorial cancellation on the envelope.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcgees.org/postalcancel/postalcancelintro.shtml|title=Postal Cancel Art|website=www.mcgees.org}}</ref>  See further below.\n\n[[File:Stamp US 1938 2c precancel.jpg|upright|thumb|U.S.1938 precancelled stamp]]\n* '''[[Precancel]]s''' are stamps that have been issued with printed cancellations on them, typically to mass mailers.

In this way, the corporation can automatically print promotional messages on each envelope while simultaneously cancelling the piece of mail. Messages change throughout the year, and include seasonal messages (\"Merry Christmas / Joyeux Noel\") and promotional messages (such as Canada Post's web address).\n\nOther post offices such as the [[Isle of Man Post|Isle of Man Philatelic Bureau]] also create special pictorial cancellations as they did in 1985 to mark the anniversary of the aircraft Douglas [[DC-3]].  A special handstamp was created <ref name=LS-13-12-1985 >Top-flight honour for schoolboy - Front Page - Lincolnshire Standard - 13 December 1985</ref> depicting a Dakota flying \"free\" and not \"boxed in\".<ref>Special Dakota Cover Inside Information Card - [[Isle of Man Post|Isle of Man Philatelic Bureau]] - 17 December 1985</ref>\n\n==Collectors==\nGeneralist stamp collectors usually prefer '''lightly cancelled''' stamps which have the postmark on a corner or small portion of the stamp without obscuring the stamp itself, which ordinarily are more valuable than '''heavily-cancelled stamps'''.<ref>See, e.g., [[Scott Catalogue]], note preceding Great Britain listings.</ref>  In order to get the postal clerk to cancel the stamps lightly, collectors may rubber-stamp or write \"philatelic mail\" on the envelope.\n\nCancellations may significantly affect the value of the stamps.  Many stamps are rarer, and consequently much more expensive, in unused condition, such as the Penny Black, which in 1999, catalogued for $1,900 mint and $110 used.<ref>[[Scott Catalogue]], Great Britain, no. 1.</ref>  The reverse is true for some stamps, such as the hyperinflation stamps of [[Postage stamps and postal history of Germany|Germany]], which may be worth many times more if genuinely postally used.<ref name=\"catalogue1\">[[Scott Catalogue]], Germany, no. 161-321 and note preceding no.161.</ref>  Where stamps are much more valuable in used condition than unused, it may be advisable to  have such stamps [[Expertization|expertised]] to confirm that the cancellation is genuine and contemporary.<ref name=\"catalogue1\"/>\n\nSome stamp collectors are interested in the cancellations themselves, on or off cover, of a particular country or issue, or collect a specific type of cancellation, such as fancy cancels. Birth date cancels are also collected<ref>See External Links: Other, below</ref>. There have been many published studies of the cancellations of many countries, some of which are listed below.  Collectors who are interested in the cancellations themselves prefer bold, readable cancellations.  Cancellations also are an integral part of the collection of [[postal history]]. \n\nHistorically, collectors disliked pen cancels and removed many of them, making the stamp appear unused or to add a fake cancellation.<ref name=\"scott2\"/>  Today, early United States pen cancelled stamps still are worth considerably less than examples with  hand stamped cancels.<ref>See, e.g, [[#Scott US|Scott US]] values for nos. 1-39.</ref>\n\nCollectors generally view modern cancelled-to-order stamps or CTOs as philatelic junk, and they rarely have any significant value.<ref>{{cite web |title=Postmarks |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url=http://www.linns.com/reference/postmark/basic_postmarks.aspx |accessdate=June 26, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318065946/http://www.linns.com/reference/postmark/basic_postmarks.aspx |archivedate=March 18, 2015}}</ref>  Stamp catalogs commonly state whether their values for used stamps are for CTOs or for postally used examples.  For example, the Scott Catalog used value listings for the German Democratic Republic are for CTOs from 1950 through mid-1990, over 2700 stamps.<ref>''Scott 1999 Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue, Vol. 3'' Germany listings, note preceding no. 68.</ref>\n\n==Forgeries==\n{{main|Philatelic fakes and forgeries}}\nForgers have not only manufactured stamps for the philatelic market, they have added forged cancellations to those stamps.  This was especially common in the late 19th century and early 20th century, when huge numbers of inexpensive stamps were forged for the packet trade.<ref>See generally, [[Robert Brisco Ear\u00e9e|R.B. Ear\u00e9e]], ''Album Weeds; How to Detect Forged Stamps'' (3d Ed. reprint, Manuka-Ainslie Press, Acton, Canberra n.d.).</ref>\n\nForged cancellations have also been applied to genuine stamps, in cases where the stamps are worth much more postally used.  In addition, where rare cancellations are desired by collectors, those cancellations have also been forged.\n\nCancellations may also be used to prove that certain philatelic items are genuine.  For example, forgers have fabricated many supposedly valuable postal covers by adding genuine stamps and forged postal markings to pre-stamp covers.<ref>See, e.g., Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Brun, ''Out-Foxing the Fakers'' (American Philatelic Society, State College, PA 1993), Chapter 6.</ref>  A cover can be shown to be genuine if a genuine cancellation \"ties\" the stamp or stamps to the cover; that is, if a genuine cancellation runs continuously over the stamp and adjacent portion of the envelope, although one still may need to rule out the possibility that the cancellation was added later.  Similarly, stamps that were cut in parts and used for a portion of the full value as [[Bisects and splits (philately)|splits]] can only be shown to have been so used if a genuine cancel ties the stamp to the cover or piece of cover.\n\n==Studies of cancellations==\n'''Great Britain, Ireland & Commonwealth'''\n* R.C.

Types of securities sold by the government include treasury bills, notes, bonds, Real Return Bonds, Canada Savings Bonds, and provincial government securities.\n\nThe annual government \"deficit\" is the difference between government receipts and spending which derives from the [[Canadian federal budget]]. If the spending is higher than receipts, the Canadian government debt will increase, otherwise it will decrease.\n\n== Revenue and spending ==\n{{Main|Taxation in Canada|Canadian federal budget}}\nThe [[2019 Canadian federal budget]] was presented on March 19, 2019 with a total projected revenue of $338.8 billion and projected expenditures of $355.6 billion, resulting in a projected deficit of $19.8 billion (ca. 0.9% of GDP). \n\n==History==\nCanada's federal debt grew steadily between 5% and 10% per year until 1975. For the next 12 years it grew on average over 20% per year.  It surpassed $100 billion in 1981, $200 billion in 1985, $300 billion in 1988, $400 billion in 1992, and $500 billion in 1994. It peaked at $563 billion in 1997, before then declining to $458 billion by 2008.\n\nWith a recession, and an increase in federal spending from 2008, the federal debt grew by $5.8 billion in 2008\u201309. Large annual deficits from 2008 to 2013 has Canadian debt surpassing the $600 billion mark by November 2012, making it larger than the 1997 peak in absolute dollars (although far smaller in comparison to GDP).  \n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n!

New York: Routledge, 1973. 12.</ref>\n\nFrom 2009\u20132010 to 2013\u20132014, the amount of the Canadian's debt held by foreign investors passed from 15% to 27% with a peak at 30% in 2012\u20132013.

Indeed, between 2008 and 2015, federal debt increased by about 34% whereas the provincial debt increased by almost 87%. \n\nAt the provincial level, progress on fiscal consolidation has been mixed and contingent liabilities loom on the horizon. Quebec and BC have made tangible progress in generating a surplus operating balance to reduce net debt. Ontario recently achieved a balanced operating budget, but announced in its 2018 Budget its intention to run a deficit of \u00be percent of Ontario GDP over the next three years. Alberta is running a sizable operating deficit (about 2\u00be percent of Alberta GDP) and its net debt has increased rapidly, albeit from a very low base.\n\nThe current account balance narrowed to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2017 (from 3.2 percent of GDP in 2016), driven by an improvement in the energy trade balance. The current account deficit has been largely financed by portfolio inflows. Overall, despite its current account deficit and rising external debt, Canada remains a net creditor to the rest of the world. The market value of the net international investment position was $400 billion at the end of 2017, almost doubling over the year as external assets showed significant valuation gains.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ledevoir.com/politique/canada/539474/deficit-stable-mais-dette-en-hausse-pour-le-gouvernement-federal|title=D\u00e9ficit stable, mais dette en hausse pour le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral|website=Le Devoir|language=fr|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\nWith higher revenue collections and lower transfers to households, the federal government anticipated a reduction in the cumulative fiscal deficit over the next five years (FY2017/18 - FY2021/22) from 5 percent to 2\u00bc percent of GDP. \n\nThis implies a windfall gain of about 2\u00be percent of GDP that can be used for new discretionary measures. With the output gap closing, the federal government has decided not to spend all the windfall gain, choosing instead to allocate half of the gain for new measures and the remainder to be used to gradually reduce the federal debt-to-GDP ratio from 30.4 percent of GDP in FY2017/18 to 28.4 percent of GDP in FY2022/23.\n<br />\n\nActual January 2020 debt levels were reported  by the [[Fraser Institute]] <ref>{{Citation\n | last =Fuss\n | first =Jake\n | last2 =Palacios\n | first2 =Milagros \n | title =The Growing Debt Burden for Canadians \n | publisher =Fraser Institute\n | series =Fraser Institute Research Bulletins\n | date =January 2020\n | pages =11\n | url =https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/growing-debt-burden-for-canadians.pdf\n | issn =2291-8620}}</ref>\n\n== Government objectives to reduce provinces' debt ==\n\n\nAccording to an IMF report, BC and Quebec should continue to comply with their current balanced operating budget rule. Ontario and Alberta should explore alternative operational rules to replace or support their existing operating budget rules to enhance the credibility of debt reduction as a medium-term fiscal objective. Such options should consider specific sources of fiscal imbalance and public investment plans in each province.\n\nMoreover, provinces with high deficits or debt will pursue fiscal consolidation more forcefully. The authorities note that the medium-term federal fiscal plan appropriately balances the need to consolidate against the government's growth objectives.\n\nCanada's government announced that provinces with high deficits or with debt, will restore fiscal discipline and take the lead in implementing more ambitious fiscal adjustments. At the federal level, the overall size of the planned adjustment seems to be appropriate. Nonetheless, if the economy over-performs, a larger portion of windfall gains could be used for deficit and debt reduction. A blogger on the Fraser Institute website advises promoting growth and reducing income inequalities to reduce the budget deficit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/blogs/government-debt-a-snapshot-of-each-province|title=BLOG: Government debt\u2014a snapshot of each province|date=2018-10-29|website=Fraser Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\n== Risks that can impact national debt ==\n\n\nFirst, a deterioration in the primary balance by about one percent of GDP would raise the gross debt-to-GDP ratio by about 2 percentage points over the projection period. The sovereign risk premium is assumed to increase by 25 basis points for each one percent of GDP deterioration in the primary balance, resulting in higher gross financing needs of 1-2 percentage points of GDP compared to the baseline.\n\nGrowth shock. A one standard deviation shock to growth in 2019 and 2020 will reduce real GDP growth rates to about 0-0.2 percent. This would lead to a deterioration in the primary balance, with the deficit peaking at 2.3 percent in 2020. The gross debt-to-GDP ratio will revert to nearly 90 percent of GDP in 2019, but would return to a downward path over the projection period, as GDP growth recovers. Gross financing needs will also rise faster until 2020, about 2-3 percentage points higher than the baseline. \n\nA devaluation of the Canadian dollars can lead to increasing of the debt. However, given that about 90 percent of general government outstanding marketable debt instruments are in Canadian dollars, the fiscal impact of an exchange rate shock is minimal, even with a substantial exchange rate depreciation of about 23 percent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2018/07/16/Canada-2018-Article-IV-Consultation-Press-Release-Staff-Report-and-Statement-by-the-46084|title=Canada : 2018 Article IV Consultation-Press-Release; Staff Report; and Statement by the Executive Director for Canada|website=IMF|language=en|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n<br />\n\n== Debt comparison with other countries ==\n[[File:Government debt gdp.png|thumb|250px|[[Government debt]] as a percent of GDP by IMF (2018)]]\nCanada has some fiscal space, general government gross debt is high compared to its triple A-rated peers (in average 40%). \n\nCanada's general government gross debt is 89.7 percent of GDP. If accounts payable are excluded to make it internationally comparable, gross debt falls to just below 70 percent of GDP, but this is still high among economies with AAA ratings. Nonetheless, the general government holds sizeable financial assets (about 62 percent of GDP), which includes a broad range of assets (currency and deposits, debt securities, loans, equity and investment fund shares, and accounts receivable), and net debt stood at 27.8 percent of GDP in 2017. At the federal level, gross debt is considerably lower at 38 percent of GDP.\n\nThere are also accounting issues for international comparisons. Indeed, Canada's general government debt includes sizeable accounts payable, which many advanced economies do not report. If accounts payable were excluded, general government debt would be about 69 percent of GDP in 2017. \n\nPublic debt increased in recent years, reflecting the government's policy to fund public sector employee pension plans by issuing new debt. General government debt as reported here does not include unfunded pension liabilities. Many advanced economies do not report unfunded pension liabilities and as such they are excluded from measures of public sector debt to allow for consistent international comparison. General government debt, including unfunded pension liabilities, would be about 105 percent of GDP on a gross basis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/finance/debt.html|title=Debt and borrowing|last=Canada|first=Service|date=2016-08-30|website=aem|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n<br />\n\n== Future expectations of the debt ==\n\nCanadian's government announced an increase of the fiscal pressure over the long term. Especially a growth of health care spending to accelerate from 3% to 4.5 % within a 10-20-year time-frame. As a result, net debt to GDP ratios are expected to start accelerating by the mid-2020s.\n\n\nInterest rate and growth differentials are expected to be favorable in the near term, with real GDP growth exceeding real interest rates until 2021, contributing to a reduction in the gross debt to GDP ratio. However, from 2022 onward, real interest rates are expected to exceed real GDP growth, putting upward pressure on debt dynamics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2018/07/16/Canada-2018-Article-IV-Consultation-Press-Release-Staff-Report-and-Statement-by-the-46084|title=Canada : 2018 Article IV Consultation-Press-Release; Staff Report; and Statement by the Executive Director for Canada|website=IMF|language=en|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\n== Debt held by Canadian governments ==\nThe [[Royal Bank of Canada]] publishes records of federal and provincial debt figures going back to 1981.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =http://www.rbc.com/economics/economic-reports/pdf/provincial-forecasts/prov_fiscal.pdf\n | title =Canadian Federal and Provincial Fiscal Tables\n | last =\n | first =\n | date =\n | website =Economic Reports\n | publisher =Royal Bank of Canada\n | access-date =17 March 2018\n | quote =\n | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20171117224349/http://www.rbc.com/economics/economic-reports/pdf/provincial-forecasts/prov_fiscal.pdf\n | archive-date =17 November 2017\n | url-status =dead\n }}</ref>\n\nA comparison of the change in [[debt-to-GDP ratio]]s of the provinces over a nine-year period, as reported by the [[Fraser Institute]].<ref>{{Citation\n | last =Lammam\n | first =Charles\n | last2 =MacIntyre\n | first2 =Hugh\n | last3 =Ren\n | first3 =Feixue\n | last4 =Hasan\n | first4 =Sazid\n | title =The Cost of Government Debt in Canada, 2017\n | publisher =Fraser Institute\n | series =Fraser Institute Research Bulletins\n | date =January 2017\n | pages =16\n | url =https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/cost-of-government-debt-in-canada-2017.pdf\n | issn =2291-8620}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- valign=bottom\n!

Types of securities sold by the government include treasury bills, notes, bonds, Real Return Bonds, Canada Savings Bonds, and provincial government securities.\n\nThe annual government \"deficit\" is the difference between government receipts and spending which derives from the [[Canadian federal budget]]. If the spending is higher than receipts, the Canadian government debt will increase, otherwise it will decrease.\n\n== Revenue and spending ==\n{{Main|Taxation in Canada|Canadian federal budget}}\nThe [[2019 Canadian federal budget]] was presented on March 19, 2019 with a total projected revenue of $338.8 billion and projected expenditures of $355.6 billion, resulting in a projected deficit of $19.8 billion (ca. 0.9% of GDP). \n\n==History==\nCanada's federal debt grew steadily between 5% and 10% per year until 1975. For the next 12 years it grew on average over 20% per year.  It surpassed $100 billion in 1981, $200 billion in 1985, $300 billion in 1988, $400 billion in 1992, and $500 billion in 1994. It peaked at $563 billion in 1997, before then declining to $458 billion by 2008.\n\nWith a recession, and an increase in federal spending from 2008, the federal debt grew by $5.8 billion in 2008\u201309. Large annual deficits from 2008 to 2013 has Canadian debt surpassing the $600 billion mark by November 2012, making it larger than the 1997 peak in absolute dollars (although far smaller in comparison to GDP).  \n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n!

With the output gap closing, the federal government has decided not to spend all the windfall gain, choosing instead to allocate half of the gain for new measures and the remainder to be used to gradually reduce the federal debt-to-GDP ratio from 30.4 percent of GDP in FY2017/18 to 28.4 percent of GDP in FY2022/23.\n<br />\n\nActual January 2020 debt levels were reported  by the [[Fraser Institute]] <ref>{{Citation\n | last =Fuss\n | first =Jake\n | last2 =Palacios\n | first2 =Milagros \n | title =The Growing Debt Burden for Canadians \n | publisher =Fraser Institute\n | series =Fraser Institute Research Bulletins\n | date =January 2020\n | pages =11\n | url =https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/growing-debt-burden-for-canadians.pdf\n | issn =2291-8620}}</ref>\n\n== Government objectives to reduce provinces' debt ==\n\n\nAccording to an IMF report, BC and Quebec should continue to comply with their current balanced operating budget rule. Ontario and Alberta should explore alternative operational rules to replace or support their existing operating budget rules to enhance the credibility of debt reduction as a medium-term fiscal objective. Such options should consider specific sources of fiscal imbalance and public investment plans in each province.\n\nMoreover, provinces with high deficits or debt will pursue fiscal consolidation more forcefully. The authorities note that the medium-term federal fiscal plan appropriately balances the need to consolidate against the government's growth objectives.\n\nCanada's government announced that provinces with high deficits or with debt, will restore fiscal discipline and take the lead in implementing more ambitious fiscal adjustments. At the federal level, the overall size of the planned adjustment seems to be appropriate. Nonetheless, if the economy over-performs, a larger portion of windfall gains could be used for deficit and debt reduction. A blogger on the Fraser Institute website advises promoting growth and reducing income inequalities to reduce the budget deficit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/blogs/government-debt-a-snapshot-of-each-province|title=BLOG: Government debt\u2014a snapshot of each province|date=2018-10-29|website=Fraser Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\n== Risks that can impact national debt ==\n\n\nFirst, a deterioration in the primary balance by about one percent of GDP would raise the gross debt-to-GDP ratio by about 2 percentage points over the projection period. The sovereign risk premium is assumed to increase by 25 basis points for each one percent of GDP deterioration in the primary balance, resulting in higher gross financing needs of 1-2 percentage points of GDP compared to the baseline.\n\nGrowth shock. A one standard deviation shock to growth in 2019 and 2020 will reduce real GDP growth rates to about 0-0.2 percent. This would lead to a deterioration in the primary balance, with the deficit peaking at 2.3 percent in 2020. The gross debt-to-GDP ratio will revert to nearly 90 percent of GDP in 2019, but would return to a downward path over the projection period, as GDP growth recovers. Gross financing needs will also rise faster until 2020, about 2-3 percentage points higher than the baseline. \n\nA devaluation of the Canadian dollars can lead to increasing of the debt. However, given that about 90 percent of general government outstanding marketable debt instruments are in Canadian dollars, the fiscal impact of an exchange rate shock is minimal, even with a substantial exchange rate depreciation of about 23 percent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2018/07/16/Canada-2018-Article-IV-Consultation-Press-Release-Staff-Report-and-Statement-by-the-46084|title=Canada : 2018 Article IV Consultation-Press-Release; Staff Report; and Statement by the Executive Director for Canada|website=IMF|language=en|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n<br />\n\n== Debt comparison with other countries ==\n[[File:Government debt gdp.png|thumb|250px|[[Government debt]] as a percent of GDP by IMF (2018)]]\nCanada has some fiscal space, general government gross debt is high compared to its triple A-rated peers (in average 40%). \n\nCanada's general government gross debt is 89.7 percent of GDP. If accounts payable are excluded to make it internationally comparable, gross debt falls to just below 70 percent of GDP, but this is still high among economies with AAA ratings. Nonetheless, the general government holds sizeable financial assets (about 62 percent of GDP), which includes a broad range of assets (currency and deposits, debt securities, loans, equity and investment fund shares, and accounts receivable), and net debt stood at 27.8 percent of GDP in 2017. At the federal level, gross debt is considerably lower at 38 percent of GDP.\n\nThere are also accounting issues for international comparisons. Indeed, Canada's general government debt includes sizeable accounts payable, which many advanced economies do not report. If accounts payable were excluded, general government debt would be about 69 percent of GDP in 2017. \n\nPublic debt increased in recent years, reflecting the government's policy to fund public sector employee pension plans by issuing new debt. General government debt as reported here does not include unfunded pension liabilities. Many advanced economies do not report unfunded pension liabilities and as such they are excluded from measures of public sector debt to allow for consistent international comparison. General government debt, including unfunded pension liabilities, would be about 105 percent of GDP on a gross basis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/finance/debt.html|title=Debt and borrowing|last=Canada|first=Service|date=2016-08-30|website=aem|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n<br />\n\n== Future expectations of the debt ==\n\nCanadian's government announced an increase of the fiscal pressure over the long term. Especially a growth of health care spending to accelerate from 3% to 4.5 % within a 10-20-year time-frame. As a result, net debt to GDP ratios are expected to start accelerating by the mid-2020s.\n\n\nInterest rate and growth differentials are expected to be favorable in the near term, with real GDP growth exceeding real interest rates until 2021, contributing to a reduction in the gross debt to GDP ratio. However, from 2022 onward, real interest rates are expected to exceed real GDP growth, putting upward pressure on debt dynamics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2018/07/16/Canada-2018-Article-IV-Consultation-Press-Release-Staff-Report-and-Statement-by-the-46084|title=Canada : 2018 Article IV Consultation-Press-Release; Staff Report; and Statement by the Executive Director for Canada|website=IMF|language=en|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\n== Debt held by Canadian governments ==\nThe [[Royal Bank of Canada]] publishes records of federal and provincial debt figures going back to 1981.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =http://www.rbc.com/economics/economic-reports/pdf/provincial-forecasts/prov_fiscal.pdf\n | title =Canadian Federal and Provincial Fiscal Tables\n | last =\n | first =\n | date =\n | website =Economic Reports\n | publisher =Royal Bank of Canada\n | access-date =17 March 2018\n | quote =\n | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20171117224349/http://www.rbc.com/economics/economic-reports/pdf/provincial-forecasts/prov_fiscal.pdf\n | archive-date =17 November 2017\n | url-status =dead\n }}</ref>\n\nA comparison of the change in [[debt-to-GDP ratio]]s of the provinces over a nine-year period, as reported by the [[Fraser Institute]].<ref>{{Citation\n | last =Lammam\n | first =Charles\n | last2 =MacIntyre\n | first2 =Hugh\n | last3 =Ren\n | first3 =Feixue\n | last4 =Hasan\n | first4 =Sazid\n | title =The Cost of Government Debt in Canada, 2017\n | publisher =Fraser Institute\n | series =Fraser Institute Research Bulletins\n | date =January 2017\n | pages =16\n | url =https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/cost-of-government-debt-in-canada-2017.pdf\n | issn =2291-8620}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- valign=bottom\n!

Inspection.gc.ca. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.</ref> the CFIA works to protect Canadians from preventable health risks and provide a fair and effective food, animal and plant regulatory regime that supports competitive domestic and international markets.\n\nOne of the main acts and regulations that CFIA uses is the ''[[Food and Drugs Act]]'', which was last updated in 1985.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} There have been ongoing regulatory amendments brought forward with the most recent attempt at modernizing the Food and Drugs Act was the introduction of [[Food and Drugs Act#2008 Proposed Amendment|Bill C-51]].\n\nOther Acts and Regulations also specify inspection requirements and for certain trade requirements, the need to register with CFIA to conduct business. Such companies are termed \"registered establishments\" as opposed to those \"non-federally registered establishments\" that fall solely under the ''Food and Drugs Act''. While the ''Food and Drugs Act'' provide for core food safety standards, many companies opt to use third-party standards such as [[HACCP]] or [[ISO]] in order to meet client specified standards. These standards are closely observed by the food industry due to the potential loss of business.\n\nThe ''Food and Drugs Act'' does not have any requirements for domestic manufacturers to notify the agency of their existence but companies generally require provincial registrations or municipal licenses to operate. Provincial authorities and local public health units carry out inspections and work with the CFIA to manage food safety risks.\n\nThere is no requirement in the ''Food and Drugs Act'' for importers to directly notify the CFIA of their existence. Import notification is required for other commodities such as fish and meat. All commercial importers must have an import/export account with [[Canada Border Services Agency]] who refers food, animal and plant imports to the CFIA as required. Through various [[phytosanitary]] requirements, CBSA import controls often cause the CFIA to take notice.\n\nThe CFIA is responsible for monitoring pesticide residues in food.
