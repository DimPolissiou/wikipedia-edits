A principal achievement of these experiments (specifically of the LHC) is the discovery of a particle consistent with the Standard Model [[Higgs boson]], the particle resulting from the [[Higgs mechanism]], which provides an explanation for the masses of elementary particles.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Higgs Boson|url=http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/higgs-boson|website=CERN: Accelerating Science|publisher=CERN|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are still many questions that future collider experiments hope to answer.  These include uncertainties in the mathematical behaviour of the Standard Model at high energies, tests of proposed theories of [[dark matter]] (including [[supersymmetry]]), and the reasons for the [[CP Violation|imbalance]] of matter and antimatter observed in the Universe.\n\n==Physics goals==\n[[File:CERN LHC Compact Muon Solenoid - panorama.jpg|thumb|Panorama of CMS detector, 100m below the ground.]]\nThe main goals of the experiment are:\n* to explore physics at the [[TeV]] scale\n* to further study the properties of the [[Higgs boson]], already discovered by CMS and [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]]\n* to look for evidence of physics beyond the standard model, such as [[supersymmetry]], or [[extra dimensions]]\n* to study aspects of heavy ion collisions.\n\nThe [[ATLAS experiment]], at the other side of the LHC ring is designed with similar goals in mind, and the two experiments are designed to complement each other both to extend reach and to provide corroboration of findings. CMS and [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] uses different technical solutions and design of its detector magnet system to achieve the goals.\n\n==Detector summary==\nCMS is designed as a general-purpose detector, capable of studying many aspects of [[proton]] collisions at 0.9\u201313 [[TeV]], the [[Special relativity|center-of-mass]] energy of the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] particle accelerator.\n\nThe CMS detector is built around a huge solenoid magnet. This takes the form of a cylindrical coil of superconducting cable that generates a magnetic field of 4 teslas, about 100 000 times that of the Earth. The magnetic field is confined by a steel 'yoke' that forms the bulk of the detector's weight of 12 500 tonnes. An unusual feature of the CMS detector is that instead of being built in-situ underground, like the other giant detectors of the LHC experiments, it was constructed on the surface, before being lowered underground in 15 sections and reassembled.\n\nIt contains subsystems which are designed to measure the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of [[photons]], [[electrons]], [[muons]], and other products of the collisions.  The innermost layer is a silicon-based tracker.  Surrounding it is a [[Scintillation (physics)|scintillating]] [[stolzite|crystal]] electromagnetic [[calorimeter (particle physics)|calorimeter]], which is itself surrounded with a sampling calorimeter for hadrons.  The tracker and the calorimetry are compact enough to fit inside the CMS [[Solenoid]] which generates a powerful magnetic field of 3.8 [[tesla (unit)|T]].  Outside the magnet are the large muon detectors, which are inside the return yoke of the magnet.\n[[File:CMS 160312 06.png|thumb|none|400px|A cutaway diagram of the CMS detector]]\n\n==CMS by layers==\nFor full technical details about the CMS detector, please see the [http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/922757/files/lhcc-2006-001.pdf Technical Design Report].<ref>http://cds.cern.ch/record/922757</ref>\n\n===The interaction point===\nThis is the point in the centre of the detector at which [[proton]]-proton collisions occur between the two counter-rotating beams of the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]]. At each end of the detector magnets focus the beams into the interaction point. At collision each beam has a radius of 17&nbsp;\u03bcm and the crossing angle between the beams is 285&nbsp;\u03bcrad.\n\nAt full design [[Luminosity (scattering theory)|luminosity]] each of the two LHC beams will contain 2,808 bunches of {{val|1.15|e=11}} protons. The interval between crossings is 25&nbsp;ns, although the number of collisions per second is only 31.6 million due to gaps in the beam as injector magnets are activated and deactivated.\n\nAt full luminosity each collision will produce an average of 20 proton-proton interactions. The collisions occur at a centre of mass energy of 8&nbsp;TeV. But, it is worth noting that for studies of physics at the electroweak scale, the scattering events are initiated by a single quark or gluon from each proton, and so the actual energy involved in each collision will be lower as the total centre of mass energy is shared by these quarks and gluons (determined by the [[parton distribution functions]]).\n\nThe first test which ran in September 2008 was expected to operate at a lower collision energy of 10&nbsp;TeV but this was prevented by the 19 September 2008 shutdown. When at this target level, the LHC will have a significantly reduced luminosity, due to both fewer proton bunches in each beam and fewer protons per bunch. The reduced bunch frequency does allow the crossing angle to be reduced to zero however, as bunches are far enough spaced to prevent secondary collisions in the experimental beampipe.\n\n===Layer 1 \u2013 The tracker===\nMomentum of particles is crucial in helping us to build up a picture of events at the heart of the collision. One method to calculate the momentum of a particle is to track its path through a magnetic field; the more curved the path, the less momentum the particle had. The CMS tracker records the paths taken by charged particles by finding their positions at a number of key points.\n\nThe tracker can reconstruct the paths of high-energy muons, electrons and hadrons (particles made up of quarks) as well as see tracks coming from the decay of very short-lived particles such as beauty or \u201cb quarks\u201d that will be used to study the differences between matter and antimatter.\n\nThe tracker needs to record particle paths accurately yet be lightweight so as to disturb the particle as little as possible. It does this by taking position measurements so accurate that tracks can be reliably reconstructed using just a few measurement points. Each measurement is accurate to 10&nbsp;\u00b5m, a fraction of the width of a human hair. It is also the inner most layer of the detector and so receives the highest volume of particles: the construction materials were therefore carefully chosen to resist radiation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/tracker-detector|title=Tracker detector - CMS Experiment|website=cms.web.cern.ch|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe CMS tracker is made entirely of silicon: the pixels, at the very core of the detector and dealing with the highest intensity of particles, and the [[microstrip detector|silicon microstrip detectors]] that surround it. As particles travel through the tracker the pixels and microstrips produce tiny electric signals that are amplified and detected. The tracker employs sensors covering an area the size of a tennis court, with 75 million separate electronic read-out channels: in the pixel detector there are some 6,000 connections per square centimetre.\n\nThe CMS silicon tracker consists of 14 layers in the central region and 15 layers in the endcaps. The innermost four layers (up to 16&nbsp;cm radius) consist of 100 \u00d7 150 \u03bcm pixels, 124 million in total. The pixel detector was upgraded as a part of the CMS phase-1 upgrade in 2017, which added an additional layer to both the barrel and endcap, \nand shifted the innermost layer 1.5 cm closer to the beamline. <ref>{{Cite book |doi = 10.1109/NSSMIC.2016.8069719|isbn = 978-1-5090-1642-6|chapter = The phase-1 upgrade of the CMS pixel detector|title = 2016 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium, Medical Imaging Conference and Room-Temperature Semiconductor Detector Workshop (NSS/MIC/RTSD)|year = 2016|last1 = Weber|first1 = Hannsjorg|pages = 1\u20134}}</ref>\n\nThe next four layers (up to 55&nbsp;cm radius) consist of {{nowrap|10 cm \u00d7 180 \u03bcm}} silicon strips, followed by the remaining six layers of {{nowrap|25 cm \u00d7 180 \u03bcm}} strips, out to a radius of 1.1&nbsp;m. There are 9.6 million strip channels in total.\n\nDuring full luminosity collisions the occupancy of the pixel layers per event is expected to be 0.1%, and 1\u20132% in the strip layers. The expected [[High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider|HL-LHC]] upgrade will increase the number of interactions to the point where over-occupancy would significantly reduce trackfinding effectiveness. An upgrade is planned to increase the performance and the radiation tolerance of the tracker.\n\nThis part of the detector is the world's largest silicon detector. It has 205&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> of silicon sensors (approximately the area of a tennis court) comprising 76 million channels.<ref>[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/32915 CMS installs the world's largest silicon detector], CERN Courier, Feb 15, 2008</ref>\n\n===Layer 2 \u2013 The Electromagnetic Calorimeter===\nThe Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) is designed to measure with high accuracy the energies of [[electron]]s and [[photon]]s.\n\nThe ECAL is constructed from crystals of [[lead tungstate]], PbWO<sub>4</sub>. This is an extremely dense but optically clear material, ideal for stopping high energy particles. Lead tungstate crystal is made primarily of metal and is heavier than stainless steel, but with a touch of oxygen in this crystalline form it is highly transparent and [[Scintillator|scintillates]] when electrons and photons pass through it. This means it produces light in proportion to the particle's energy. These high-density crystals produce light in fast, short, well-defined photon bursts that allow for a precise, fast and fairly compact detector. It has a [[radiation length]] of \u03c7<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.89&nbsp;cm, and has a rapid light yield, with 80% of light yield within one crossing time (25&nbsp;ns). This is balanced however by a relatively low light yield of 30 photons per MeV of incident energy. The crystals used have a front size of 22&nbsp;mm&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;22&nbsp;mm and a depth of 230&nbsp;mm. They are set in a matrix of carbon fibre to keep them optically isolated, and backed by silicon [[avalanche photodiodes]] for readout.\n\nThe ECAL, made up of a barrel section and two \"endcaps\", forms a layer between the tracker and the HCAL. The cylindrical \"barrel\" consists of 61,200 crystals formed into 36 \"supermodules\", each weighing around three tonnes and containing 1,700 crystals. The flat ECAL endcaps seal off the barrel at either end and are made up of almost 15,000 further crystals.\n\nFor extra spatial precision, the ECAL also contains preshower detectors that sit in front of the endcaps. These allow CMS to distinguish between single high-energy photons (often signs of exciting physics) and the less interesting close pairs of low-energy photons.\n\nAt the endcaps the ECAL inner surface is covered by the preshower subdetector, consisting of two layers of [[lead]] interleaved with two layers of silicon strip detectors. Its purpose is to aid in pion-photon discrimination.\n\n===Layer 3 \u2013 The Hadronic Calorimeter===\n[[Image:CMS Hcal 26 01 2007.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Half of the Hadron Calorimeter]]\nThe Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) measures the energy of [[hadrons]], particles made of [[quarks]] and [[gluons]] (for example [[protons]], [[neutrons]], [[pions]] and [[kaons]]). Additionally it provides indirect measurement of the presence of non-interacting, uncharged particles such as [[neutrinos]].\n\nThe HCAL consists of layers of dense material ([[brass]] or [[steel]]) interleaved with tiles of plastic [[Scintillation (physics)|scintillators]], read out via wavelength-shifting fibres by [[hybrid photodiodes]]. This combination was determined to allow the maximum amount of absorbing material inside of the magnet coil.\n\nThe high [[pseudorapidity]] region <math>\\scriptstyle (3.0 \\;<\\; |\\eta| \\;<\\; 5.0)</math> is instrumented by the Hadronic Forward (HF) detector. Located 11&nbsp;m either side of the interaction point, this uses a slightly different technology of steel absorbers and quartz fibres for readout, designed to allow better separation of particles in the congested forward region.\nThe HF is also used  to measure the relative online luminosity system in CMS.\n\nAbout half of the brass used in the endcaps of the HCAL used to be Russian artillery shells.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/using-russian-navy-shells|title=Using Russian navy shells - CMS Experiment|website=cms.web.cern.ch|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Layer 4 \u2013 The magnet===\nThe CMS magnet is the central device around which the experiment is built, with a 4 Tesla magnetic field that is 100,000 times stronger than the Earth's. CMS has a large [[solenoid]] magnet.  This allows the charge/mass ratio of particles to be determined from the curved track that they follow in the magnetic field.  It is 13&nbsp;m long and 6&nbsp;m in diameter, and its refrigerated superconducting niobium-titanium coils were originally intended to produce a 4&nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|T]] magnetic field. The operating field was scaled down to 3.8&nbsp;T instead of the full design strength in order to maximize longevity.<ref>[http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-0221/5/03/T03021/pdf/1748-0221_5_03_T03021.pdf Precise mapping of the magnetic field in the CMS barrel yoke using cosmic rays]</ref>\n\nThe inductance of the magnet is 14&nbsp;[[henries|\u0397]] and the nominal current for 4&nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|T]] is 19,500&nbsp;[[ampere|A]], giving a total stored energy of 2.66&nbsp;[[gigajoule|GJ]], equivalent to about half-a-tonne of [[TNT equivalent|TNT]]. There are dump circuits to safely dissipate this energy should the magnet [[Superconducting magnet#Magnet quench|quench]].  The circuit resistance (essentially just the cables from the power converter to the [[cryostat]]) has a value of 0.1&nbsp;m\u03a9 which leads to a circuit time constant of nearly 39 hours.  This is the longest time constant of any circuit at CERN.  The operating current for 3.8&nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|T]] is 18,160&nbsp;[[ampere|A]], giving a stored energy of 2.3&nbsp;[[gigajoule|GJ]].\n\nThe job of the big magnet is to bend the paths of particles emerging from high-energy collisions in the LHC. The more momentum a particle has the less its path is curved by the magnetic field, so tracing its path gives a measure of momentum. CMS began with the aim of having the strongest magnet possible because a higher strength field bends paths more and, combined with high-precision position measurements in the tracker and muon detectors, this allows accurate measurement of the momentum of even high-energy particles.\n\nThe tracker and calorimeter detectors (ECAL and HCAL) fit snugly inside the magnet coil whilst the muon detectors are interleaved with a 12-sided iron structure that surrounds the magnet coils and contains and guides the field. Made up of three layers this \u201creturn yoke\u201d reaches out 14 metres in diameter and also acts as a filter, allowing through only muons and weakly interacting particles such as neutrinos. The enormous magnet also provides most of the experiment's structural support, and must be very strong itself to withstand the forces of its own magnetic field.\n\n===Layer 5 \u2013 The muon detectors and return yoke===\nAs the name \u201cCompact Muon Solenoid\u201d suggests, detecting [[muons]] is one of CMS's most important tasks. Muons are charged particles that are just like [[electrons]] and [[positrons]], but are 200 times more massive. We expect them to be produced in the decay of a number of potential new particles; for instance, one of the clearest \"signatures\" of the [[Higgs Boson]] is its decay into four muons.\n\nBecause muons can penetrate several metres of iron without interacting, unlike most particles they are not stopped by any of CMS's calorimeters. Therefore, chambers to detect muons are placed at the very edge of the experiment where they are the only particles likely to register a signal.\n\nTo identify [[muon]]s and measure their momenta, CMS uses three types of detector: [[wire chamber|drift tubes]] (DT), [[cathode strip chambers]] (CSC) and [[resistive plate chambers]] (RPC).  The DTs are used for precise trajectory measurements in the central ''barrel'' region, while the CSCs are used in the ''end caps''. The RPCs provide a fast signal when a muon passes through the muon detector, and are installed in both the barrel and the end caps.\n\nThe [[drift tube]] (DT) system measures [[muon]] positions in the barrel part of the detector. Each 4-cm-wide tube contains a stretched wire within a gas volume. When a muon or any charged particle passes through the volume it knocks electrons off the atoms of the gas. These follow the electric field ending up at the positively charged wire. By registering where along the wire electrons hit (in the diagram, the wires are going into the page) as well as by calculating the muon's original distance away from the wire (shown here as horizontal distance and calculated by multiplying the speed of an electron in the tube by the time taken) DTs give two coordinates for the muon's position. Each DT chamber, on average 2 m x 2.5 m in size, consists of 12 aluminium layers, arranged in three groups of four, each with up to 60 tubes: the middle group measures the coordinate along the direction parallel to the beam and the two outside groups measure the perpendicular coordinate.\n\n[[Cathode strip chambers]] (CSC) are used in the endcap disks where the magnetic field is uneven and particle rates are high. CSCs consist of arrays of positively charged \u201canode\u201d wires crossed with negatively charged copper \u201ccathode\u201d strips within a gas volume. When muons pass through, they knock electrons off the gas atoms, which flock to the anode wires creating an avalanche of electrons. Positive ions move away from the wire and towards the copper cathode, also inducing a charge pulse in the strips, at right angles to the wire direction. Because the strips and the wires are perpendicular, we get two position coordinates for each passing particle. In addition to providing precise space and time information, the closely spaced wires make the CSCs fast detectors suitable for triggering. Each CSC module contains six layers making it able to accurately identify muons and match their tracks to those in the tracker.\n\n[[Resistive plate chambers]] (RPC) are fast gaseous detectors that provide a muon trigger system parallel with those of the DTs and CSCs. RPCs consist of two parallel plates, a positively charged anode and a negatively charged cathode, both made of a very high resistivity plastic material and separated by a gas volume. When a muon passes through the chamber, electrons are knocked out of gas atoms. These electrons in turn hit other atoms causing an avalanche of electrons. The electrodes are transparent to the signal (the electrons), which are instead picked up by external metallic strips after a small but precise time delay. The pattern of hit strips gives a quick measure of the muon momentum, which is then used by the trigger to make immediate decisions about whether the data are worth keeping. RPCs combine a good spatial resolution with a time resolution of just one nanosecond (one billionth of a second).\n\n==Collecting and collating the data==\n\n===Pattern recognition===\nNew particles discovered in CMS will be typically [[Particle decay|unstable]] and rapidly transform into a cascade of lighter, more stable and better understood particles. Particles travelling through CMS leave behind characteristic patterns, or \u2018signatures\u2019, in the different layers, allowing them to be identified. The presence (or not) of any new particles can then be inferred.\n\n===Trigger system===\nTo have a good chance of producing a rare particle, such as a [[Higgs boson]], a very large number of collisions is required. Most collision events in the detector are \"soft\" and do not produce interesting effects. The amount of raw data from each crossing is approximately 1&nbsp;[[megabyte]], which at the 40&nbsp;MHz crossing rate would result in 40&nbsp;[[terabytes]] of data a second, an amount that the experiment cannot hope to store, let alone process properly. The full trigger system reduces the rate of interesting events down to a manageable 1,000 per second.\n\nTo accomplish this, a series of \"trigger\" stages are employed. All the data from each crossing is held in buffers within the detector while a small amount of key information is used to perform a fast, approximate calculation to identify features of interest such as high energy jets, muons or missing energy. This \"Level 1\" calculation is completed in around 1&nbsp;\u00b5s, and event rate is reduced by a factor of about 1,000 down to 50&nbsp;kHz. All these calculations are done on fast, custom hardware using reprogrammable [[field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGA).\n\nIf an event is passed by the Level 1 trigger all the data still buffered in the detector is sent over [[fibre-optic]] links to the \"High Level\" trigger, which is software (mainly written in [[C++]]) running on ordinary computer servers. The lower event rate in the High Level trigger allows time for much more detailed analysis of the event to be done than in the Level 1 trigger. The High Level trigger reduces the event rate by a further factor of 100 down to 1,000 events per second. These are then stored on tape for future analysis.\n\n===Data analysis===\nData that has passed the triggering stages and been stored on tape is duplicated using the [[LHC Computing Grid|Grid]] to additional sites around the world for easier access and redundancy. Physicists are then able to use the Grid to access and run their analyses on the data.\n\nThere are a huge range of analyses performed at CMS, including:\n* Performing precision measurements of Standard Model particles, which allows both for furthering the knowledge of these particles and also for the collaboration to calibrate the detector and measure the performance of various components.\n* Searching for events with large amounts of missing transverse energy, which implies the presence of particles that have passed through the detector without leaving a signature.

A principal achievement of these experiments (specifically of the LHC) is the discovery of a particle consistent with the Standard Model [[Higgs boson]], the particle resulting from the [[Higgs mechanism]], which provides an explanation for the masses of elementary particles.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Higgs Boson|url=http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/higgs-boson|website=CERN: Accelerating Science|publisher=CERN|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are still many questions that future collider experiments hope to answer.  These include uncertainties in the mathematical behaviour of the Standard Model at high energies, tests of proposed theories of [[dark matter]] (including [[supersymmetry]]), and the reasons for the [[CP Violation|imbalance]] of matter and antimatter observed in the Universe.\n\n==Physics goals==\n[[File:CERN LHC Compact Muon Solenoid - panorama.jpg|thumb|Panorama of CMS detector, 100m below the ground.]]\nThe main goals of the experiment are:\n* to explore physics at the [[TeV]] scale\n* to further study the properties of the [[Higgs boson]], already discovered by CMS and [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]]\n* to look for evidence of physics beyond the standard model, such as [[supersymmetry]], or [[extra dimensions]]\n* to study aspects of heavy ion collisions.\n\nThe [[ATLAS experiment]], at the other side of the LHC ring is designed with similar goals in mind, and the two experiments are designed to complement each other both to extend reach and to provide corroboration of findings. CMS and [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] uses different technical solutions and design of its detector magnet system to achieve the goals.\n\n==Detector summary==\nCMS is designed as a general-purpose detector, capable of studying many aspects of [[proton]] collisions at 0.9\u201313 [[TeV]], the [[Special relativity|center-of-mass]] energy of the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] particle accelerator.\n\nThe CMS detector is built around a huge solenoid magnet. This takes the form of a cylindrical coil of superconducting cable that generates a magnetic field of 4 teslas, about 100 000 times that of the Earth. The magnetic field is confined by a steel 'yoke' that forms the bulk of the detector's weight of 12 500 tonnes. An unusual feature of the CMS detector is that instead of being built in-situ underground, like the other giant detectors of the LHC experiments, it was constructed on the surface, before being lowered underground in 15 sections and reassembled.\n\nIt contains subsystems which are designed to measure the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of [[photons]], [[electrons]], [[muons]], and other products of the collisions.  The innermost layer is a silicon-based tracker.  Surrounding it is a [[Scintillation (physics)|scintillating]] [[stolzite|crystal]] electromagnetic [[calorimeter (particle physics)|calorimeter]], which is itself surrounded with a sampling calorimeter for hadrons.  The tracker and the calorimetry are compact enough to fit inside the CMS [[Solenoid]] which generates a powerful magnetic field of 3.8 [[tesla (unit)|T]].  Outside the magnet are the large muon detectors, which are inside the return yoke of the magnet.\n[[File:CMS 160312 06.png|thumb|none|400px|A cutaway diagram of the CMS detector]]\n\n==CMS by layers==\nFor full technical details about the CMS detector, please see the [http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/922757/files/lhcc-2006-001.pdf Technical Design Report].<ref>http://cds.cern.ch/record/922757</ref>\n\n===The interaction point===\nThis is the point in the centre of the detector at which [[proton]]-proton collisions occur between the two counter-rotating beams of the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]]. At each end of the detector magnets focus the beams into the interaction point. At collision each beam has a radius of 17&nbsp;\u03bcm and the crossing angle between the beams is 285&nbsp;\u03bcrad.\n\nAt full design [[Luminosity (scattering theory)|luminosity]] each of the two LHC beams will contain 2,808 bunches of {{val|1.15|e=11}} protons. The interval between crossings is 25&nbsp;ns, although the number of collisions per second is only 31.6 million due to gaps in the beam as injector magnets are activated and deactivated.\n\nAt full luminosity each collision will produce an average of 20 proton-proton interactions. The collisions occur at a centre of mass energy of 8&nbsp;TeV. But, it is worth noting that for studies of physics at the electroweak scale, the scattering events are initiated by a single quark or gluon from each proton, and so the actual energy involved in each collision will be lower as the total centre of mass energy is shared by these quarks and gluons (determined by the [[parton distribution functions]]).\n\nThe first test which ran in September 2008 was expected to operate at a lower collision energy of 10&nbsp;TeV but this was prevented by the 19 September 2008 shutdown. When at this target level, the LHC will have a significantly reduced luminosity, due to both fewer proton bunches in each beam and fewer protons per bunch. The reduced bunch frequency does allow the crossing angle to be reduced to zero however, as bunches are far enough spaced to prevent secondary collisions in the experimental beampipe.\n\n===Layer 1 \u2013 The tracker===\nMomentum of particles is crucial in helping us to build up a picture of events at the heart of the collision. One method to calculate the momentum of a particle is to track its path through a magnetic field; the more curved the path, the less momentum the particle had. The CMS tracker records the paths taken by charged particles by finding their positions at a number of key points.\n\nThe tracker can reconstruct the paths of high-energy muons, electrons and hadrons (particles made up of quarks) as well as see tracks coming from the decay of very short-lived particles such as beauty or \u201cb quarks\u201d that will be used to study the differences between matter and antimatter.\n\nThe tracker needs to record particle paths accurately yet be lightweight so as to disturb the particle as little as possible. It does this by taking position measurements so accurate that tracks can be reliably reconstructed using just a few measurement points. Each measurement is accurate to 10&nbsp;\u00b5m, a fraction of the width of a human hair. It is also the inner most layer of the detector and so receives the highest volume of particles: the construction materials were therefore carefully chosen to resist radiation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/tracker-detector|title=Tracker detector - CMS Experiment|website=cms.web.cern.ch|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe CMS tracker is made entirely of silicon: the pixels, at the very core of the detector and dealing with the highest intensity of particles, and the [[microstrip detector|silicon microstrip detectors]] that surround it. As particles travel through the tracker the pixels and microstrips produce tiny electric signals that are amplified and detected. The tracker employs sensors covering an area the size of a tennis court, with 75 million separate electronic read-out channels: in the pixel detector there are some 6,000 connections per square centimetre.\n\nThe CMS silicon tracker consists of 14 layers in the central region and 15 layers in the endcaps. The innermost four layers (up to 16&nbsp;cm radius) consist of 100 \u00d7 150 \u03bcm pixels, 124 million in total. The pixel detector was upgraded as a part of the CMS phase-1 upgrade in 2017, which added an additional layer to both the barrel and endcap, \nand shifted the innermost layer 1.5 cm closer to the beamline. <ref>{{Cite book |doi = 10.1109/NSSMIC.2016.8069719|isbn = 978-1-5090-1642-6|chapter = The phase-1 upgrade of the CMS pixel detector|title = 2016 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium, Medical Imaging Conference and Room-Temperature Semiconductor Detector Workshop (NSS/MIC/RTSD)|year = 2016|last1 = Weber|first1 = Hannsjorg|pages = 1\u20134}}</ref>\n\nThe next four layers (up to 55&nbsp;cm radius) consist of {{nowrap|10 cm \u00d7 180 \u03bcm}} silicon strips, followed by the remaining six layers of {{nowrap|25 cm \u00d7 180 \u03bcm}} strips, out to a radius of 1.1&nbsp;m. There are 9.6 million strip channels in total.\n\nDuring full luminosity collisions the occupancy of the pixel layers per event is expected to be 0.1%, and 1\u20132% in the strip layers. The expected [[High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider|HL-LHC]] upgrade will increase the number of interactions to the point where over-occupancy would significantly reduce trackfinding effectiveness. An upgrade is planned to increase the performance and the radiation tolerance of the tracker.\n\nThis part of the detector is the world's largest silicon detector. It has 205&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> of silicon sensors (approximately the area of a tennis court) comprising 76 million channels.<ref>[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/32915 CMS installs the world's largest silicon detector], CERN Courier, Feb 15, 2008</ref>\n\n===Layer 2 \u2013 The Electromagnetic Calorimeter===\nThe Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) is designed to measure with high accuracy the energies of [[electron]]s and [[photon]]s.\n\nThe ECAL is constructed from crystals of [[lead tungstate]], PbWO<sub>4</sub>. This is an extremely dense but optically clear material, ideal for stopping high energy particles. Lead tungstate crystal is made primarily of metal and is heavier than stainless steel, but with a touch of oxygen in this crystalline form it is highly transparent and [[Scintillator|scintillates]] when electrons and photons pass through it. This means it produces light in proportion to the particle\u2019s energy. These high-density crystals produce light in fast, short, well-defined photon bursts that allow for a precise, fast and fairly compact detector. It has a [[radiation length]] of \u03c7<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.89&nbsp;cm, and has a rapid light yield, with 80% of light yield within one crossing time (25&nbsp;ns). This is balanced however by a relatively low light yield of 30 photons per MeV of incident energy. The crystals used have a front size of 22&nbsp;mm&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;22&nbsp;mm and a depth of 230&nbsp;mm. They are set in a matrix of carbon fibre to keep them optically isolated, and backed by silicon [[avalanche photodiodes]] for readout.\n\nThe ECAL, made up of a barrel section and two \"endcaps\", forms a layer between the tracker and the HCAL. The cylindrical \"barrel\" consists of 61,200 crystals formed into 36 \"supermodules\", each weighing around three tonnes and containing 1,700 crystals. The flat ECAL endcaps seal off the barrel at either end and are made up of almost 15,000 further crystals.\n\nFor extra spatial precision, the ECAL also contains preshower detectors that sit in front of the endcaps. These allow CMS to distinguish between single high-energy photons (often signs of exciting physics) and the less interesting close pairs of low-energy photons.\n\nAt the endcaps the ECAL inner surface is covered by the preshower subdetector, consisting of two layers of [[lead]] interleaved with two layers of silicon strip detectors. Its purpose is to aid in pion-photon discrimination.\n\n===Layer 3 \u2013 The Hadronic Calorimeter===\n[[Image:CMS Hcal 26 01 2007.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Half of the Hadron Calorimeter]]\nThe Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) measures the energy of [[hadrons]], particles made of [[quarks]] and [[gluons]] (for example [[protons]], [[neutrons]], [[pions]] and [[kaons]]). Additionally it provides indirect measurement of the presence of non-interacting, uncharged particles such as [[neutrinos]].\n\nThe HCAL consists of layers of dense material ([[brass]] or [[steel]]) interleaved with tiles of plastic [[Scintillation (physics)|scintillators]], read out via wavelength-shifting fibres by [[hybrid photodiodes]]. This combination was determined to allow the maximum amount of absorbing material inside of the magnet coil.\n\nThe high [[pseudorapidity]] region <math>\\scriptstyle (3.0 \\;<\\; |\\eta| \\;<\\; 5.0)</math> is instrumented by the Hadronic Forward (HF) detector. Located 11&nbsp;m either side of the interaction point, this uses a slightly different technology of steel absorbers and quartz fibres for readout, designed to allow better separation of particles in the congested forward region.\nThe HF is also used  to measure the relative online luminosity system in CMS.\n\nAbout half of the brass used in the endcaps of the HCAL used to be Russian artillery shells.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/using-russian-navy-shells|title=Using Russian navy shells - CMS Experiment|website=cms.web.cern.ch|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Layer 4 \u2013 The magnet===\nThe CMS magnet is the central device around which the experiment is built, with a 4 Tesla magnetic field that is 100,000 times stronger than the Earth\u2019s. CMS has a large [[solenoid]] magnet.  This allows the charge/mass ratio of particles to be determined from the curved track that they follow in the magnetic field.  It is 13&nbsp;m long and 6&nbsp;m in diameter, and its refrigerated superconducting niobium-titanium coils were originally intended to produce a 4&nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|T]] magnetic field. The operating field was scaled down to 3.8&nbsp;T instead of the full design strength in order to maximize longevity.<ref>[http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-0221/5/03/T03021/pdf/1748-0221_5_03_T03021.pdf Precise mapping of the magnetic field in the CMS barrel yoke using cosmic rays]</ref>\n\nThe inductance of the magnet is 14&nbsp;[[henries|\u0397]] and the nominal current for 4&nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|T]] is 19,500&nbsp;[[ampere|A]], giving a total stored energy of 2.66&nbsp;[[gigajoule|GJ]], equivalent to about half-a-tonne of [[TNT equivalent|TNT]]. There are dump circuits to safely dissipate this energy should the magnet [[Superconducting magnet#Magnet quench|quench]].  The circuit resistance (essentially just the cables from the power converter to the [[cryostat]]) has a value of 0.1&nbsp;m\u03a9 which leads to a circuit time constant of nearly 39 hours.  This is the longest time constant of any circuit at CERN.  The operating current for 3.8&nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|T]] is 18,160&nbsp;[[ampere|A]], giving a stored energy of 2.3&nbsp;[[gigajoule|GJ]].\n\nThe job of the big magnet is to bend the paths of particles emerging from high-energy collisions in the LHC. The more momentum a particle has the less its path is curved by the magnetic field, so tracing its path gives a measure of momentum. CMS began with the aim of having the strongest magnet possible because a higher strength field bends paths more and, combined with high-precision position measurements in the tracker and muon detectors, this allows accurate measurement of the momentum of even high-energy particles.\n\nThe tracker and calorimeter detectors (ECAL and HCAL) fit snugly inside the magnet coil whilst the muon detectors are interleaved with a 12-sided iron structure that surrounds the magnet coils and contains and guides the field. Made up of three layers this \u201creturn yoke\u201d reaches out 14 metres in diameter and also acts as a filter, allowing through only muons and weakly interacting particles such as neutrinos. The enormous magnet also provides most of the experiment\u2019s structural support, and must be very strong itself to withstand the forces of its own magnetic field.\n\n===Layer 5 \u2013 The muon detectors and return yoke===\nAs the name \u201cCompact Muon Solenoid\u201d suggests, detecting [[muons]] is one of CMS\u2019s most important tasks. Muons are charged particles that are just like [[electrons]] and [[positrons]], but are 200 times more massive. We expect them to be produced in the decay of a number of potential new particles; for instance, one of the clearest \"signatures\" of the [[Higgs Boson]] is its decay into four muons.\n\nBecause muons can penetrate several metres of iron without interacting, unlike most particles they are not stopped by any of CMS's calorimeters. Therefore, chambers to detect muons are placed at the very edge of the experiment where they are the only particles likely to register a signal.\n\nTo identify [[muon]]s and measure their momenta, CMS uses three types of detector: [[wire chamber|drift tubes]] (DT), [[cathode strip chambers]] (CSC) and [[resistive plate chambers]] (RPC).  The DTs are used for precise trajectory measurements in the central ''barrel'' region, while the CSCs are used in the ''end caps''. The RPCs provide a fast signal when a muon passes through the muon detector, and are installed in both the barrel and the end caps.\n\nThe [[drift tube]] (DT) system measures [[muon]] positions in the barrel part of the detector. Each 4-cm-wide tube contains a stretched wire within a gas volume. When a muon or any charged particle passes through the volume it knocks electrons off the atoms of the gas. These follow the electric field ending up at the positively charged wire. By registering where along the wire electrons hit (in the diagram, the wires are going into the page) as well as by calculating the muon's original distance away from the wire (shown here as horizontal distance and calculated by multiplying the speed of an electron in the tube by the time taken) DTs give two coordinates for the muon\u2019s position. Each DT chamber, on average 2 m x 2.5 m in size, consists of 12 aluminium layers, arranged in three groups of four, each with up to 60 tubes: the middle group measures the coordinate along the direction parallel to the beam and the two outside groups measure the perpendicular coordinate.\n\n[[Cathode strip chambers]] (CSC) are used in the endcap disks where the magnetic field is uneven and particle rates are high. CSCs consist of arrays of positively charged \u201canode\u201d wires crossed with negatively charged copper \u201ccathode\u201d strips within a gas volume. When muons pass through, they knock electrons off the gas atoms, which flock to the anode wires creating an avalanche of electrons. Positive ions move away from the wire and towards the copper cathode, also inducing a charge pulse in the strips, at right angles to the wire direction. Because the strips and the wires are perpendicular, we get two position coordinates for each passing particle. In addition to providing precise space and time information, the closely spaced wires make the CSCs fast detectors suitable for triggering. Each CSC module contains six layers making it able to accurately identify muons and match their tracks to those in the tracker.\n\n[[Resistive plate chambers]] (RPC) are fast gaseous detectors that provide a muon trigger system parallel with those of the DTs and CSCs. RPCs consist of two parallel plates, a positively charged anode and a negatively charged cathode, both made of a very high resistivity plastic material and separated by a gas volume. When a muon passes through the chamber, electrons are knocked out of gas atoms. These electrons in turn hit other atoms causing an avalanche of electrons. The electrodes are transparent to the signal (the electrons), which are instead picked up by external metallic strips after a small but precise time delay. The pattern of hit strips gives a quick measure of the muon momentum, which is then used by the trigger to make immediate decisions about whether the data are worth keeping. RPCs combine a good spatial resolution with a time resolution of just one nanosecond (one billionth of a second).\n\n==Collecting and collating the data==\n\n===Pattern recognition===\nNew particles discovered in CMS will be typically [[Particle decay|unstable]] and rapidly transform into a cascade of lighter, more stable and better understood particles. Particles travelling through CMS leave behind characteristic patterns, or \u2018signatures\u2019, in the different layers, allowing them to be identified. The presence (or not) of any new particles can then be inferred.\n\n===Trigger system===\nTo have a good chance of producing a rare particle, such as a [[Higgs boson]], a very large number of collisions is required. Most collision events in the detector are \"soft\" and do not produce interesting effects. The amount of raw data from each crossing is approximately 1&nbsp;[[megabyte]], which at the 40&nbsp;MHz crossing rate would result in 40&nbsp;[[terabytes]] of data a second, an amount that the experiment cannot hope to store, let alone process properly. The full trigger system reduces the rate of interesting events down to a manageable 1,000 per second.\n\nTo accomplish this, a series of \"trigger\" stages are employed. All the data from each crossing is held in buffers within the detector while a small amount of key information is used to perform a fast, approximate calculation to identify features of interest such as high energy jets, muons or missing energy. This \"Level 1\" calculation is completed in around 1&nbsp;\u00b5s, and event rate is reduced by a factor of about 1,000 down to 50&nbsp;kHz. All these calculations are done on fast, custom hardware using reprogrammable [[field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGA).\n\nIf an event is passed by the Level 1 trigger all the data still buffered in the detector is sent over [[fibre-optic]] links to the \"High Level\" trigger, which is software (mainly written in [[C++]]) running on ordinary computer servers. The lower event rate in the High Level trigger allows time for much more detailed analysis of the event to be done than in the Level 1 trigger. The High Level trigger reduces the event rate by a further factor of 100 down to 1,000 events per second. These are then stored on tape for future analysis.\n\n===Data analysis===\nData that has passed the triggering stages and been stored on tape is duplicated using the [[LHC Computing Grid|Grid]] to additional sites around the world for easier access and redundancy. Physicists are then able to use the Grid to access and run their analyses on the data.\n\nThere are a huge range of analyses performed at CMS, including:\n* Performing precision measurements of Standard Model particles, which allows both for furthering the knowledge of these particles and also for the collaboration to calibrate the detector and measure the performance of various components.\n* Searching for events with large amounts of missing transverse energy, which implies the presence of particles that have passed through the detector without leaving a signature. In the [[Standard Model]] only [[neutrinos]] would traverse the detector without being detected but a wide range of [[Beyond the Standard Model]] theories contain new particles that would also result in missing transverse energy.\n* Studying the [[kinematics]] of pairs of particles produced by the decay of a parent, such as the [[Z boson]] decaying to a pair of electrons or the [[Higgs boson]] decaying to a pair of [[tau lepton]]s or [[photons]], to determine various properties and mass of the parent.\n* Looking at jets of particles to study the way the partons ([[quarks]] and [[gluons]]) in the collided protons have interacted, or to search for evidence of new physics that manifests in hadronic final states.\n* Searching for high particle multiplicity final states (predicted by many new physics theories) is an important strategy because common Standard Model particle decays very rarely contain a large number of particles, and those processes that do are well understood.\n\n==Milestones==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| 1998\n| Construction of surface buildings for CMS begins.\n|-\n| 2000\n| LEP shut down, construction of cavern begins.\n|-\n| 2004\n| Cavern completed.\n|-\n| 10 September 2008\n| First beam in CMS.\n|-\n| 23 November 2009\n| First collisions in CMS.\n|-\n| 30 March 2010\n| First 7 TeV proton-proton collisions in CMS.\n|-\n| 7 November 2010\n| First lead ion collisions in CMS.<ref>{{cite web|year=2010|title=First lead-ion collisions in the LHC|url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/breaking/2010/11/08/first-lead-ion-collisions-in-the-lhc|publisher=[[CERN]]|accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref>\n|-\n| 5 April 2012\n| First 8 TeV proton-proton collisions in CMS.<ref>{{cite web|year=2012|title=New world record - first pp collisions at 8 TeV|url=http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/new-world-record-first-pp-collisions-8-tev|publisher=[[CERN]]|accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref>\n|-\n| 29 April 2012\n| Announcement of the 2011 discovery of the first new particle generated here, the [[excited neutral Xi-b baryon]].\n|-\n| 4 July 2012\n| Spokesperson [[Joseph Incandela|Joe Incandela]] ([[UC Santa Barbara]]) announced evidence for a particle at about 125 GeV at a seminar and webcast.

It is not in the original text of the Creed, attributed to the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381), the [[second ecumenical council]], which says that the [[Holy Spirit]] proceeds \"from the Father\", without additions of any kind, such as \"and the Son\" or \"alone\".{{sfn|RCA|2002|p=70}}\n\nIn the late 6th century, some [[Latin Church]]es added the words \"and from the Son\" (''Filioque'') to the description of the procession of the Holy Spirit, in what many Eastern Orthodox Christians have at a later stage argued is a violation of Canon VII<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.x.html Canon VII]</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2020}} of the [[Council of Ephesus]], since the words were not included in the text by either the [[First Council of Nicaea]] or that of Constantinople.<ref>For a different view, see e.g. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.xi.html Excursus on the Words \u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f11\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd]</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2020}} This was incorporated into the liturgical practice of Rome in 1014,<ref name=\"Catholic Greek-Latin\" /> but was rejected by Eastern Christianity.\n\nWhether that term ''Filioque'' is included, as well as how it is translated and understood, can have important implications for how one understands the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], which is central to the majority of Christian churches. For some, the term implies a serious underestimation of [[God the Father]]'s role in the Trinity; for others, its denial implies a serious underestimation of the role of [[God the Son]] in the Trinity.\n\nThe term has been an ongoing source of conflict between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity, contributing, in major part, to the [[East\u2013West Schism]] of 1054 and proving to be an obstacle to attempts to reunify the two sides.{{sfnm|Congar|1959|1p=44|Meyendorff|1987|2p=181|NAOCTC|2003}} There have been attempts at resolving the conflict. Among the early attempts at harmonization are the works of [[Maximus the Confessor]], who notably was canonised independently by both Eastern and Western churches. Differences over this doctrine and the question of [[Primacy of the Bishop of Rome|papal primacy]] have been and remain primary causes of schism between the Eastern Orthodox and Western churches.{{sfn|Larchet|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|WCCFO|1979}}\n\n==Nicene Creed==\nThe Nicene Creed as amended by the Second Ecumenical Council held in Constantinople in 381 includes the section\n<blockquote><poem>''Et in Spiritum Sanctum, Dominum et vivificantem\n'''qui ex Patre procedit'''\n''qui cum Patre, et Filio simul adoratur, et cum glorificatur.''</poem></blockquote>\n\nTranslated in English:\n<blockquote><poem>''[I believe] in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,''\n'''who proceeds from the Father,'''\n''who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified.''{{refn|{{OED|filioque, n|70207}}}}</poem></blockquote>\n\nThe controversy arises from the insertion of the word ''Filioque'' (\"and the Son\") in the line:\n<blockquote><poem>...''qui ex Patre '''Filioque''' procedit''...\n\n...''who proceeds from the Father '''and the Son'''''...</poem></blockquote>\n\n==Controversy==\nThe controversy referring to the term ''Filioque'' involves four separate disagreements:\n* about the term itself\n* about the orthodoxy of the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son, to which the term refers\n* about the legitimacy of inserting the term into the  Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed,\n* about the authority of the Pope to define the orthodoxy of the doctrine or to insert the term into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. \n\nAlthough the disagreement about the doctrine preceded the disagreement about the insertion into the Creed, the two disagreements became linked to the third when the pope approved insertion of the term into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, in the 11th century. Anthony Siecienski writes that \"Ultimately what was at stake was not only God's trinitarian nature, but also the nature of the Church, its teaching authority and the distribution of power among its leaders.\"{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|pp=4\u20135}}\n\n[[Hubert Cunliffe-Jones]] identifies two opposing Eastern Orthodox opinions about the ''Filioque'', a \"liberal\" view and a \"rigorist\" view. The \"liberal\" view sees the controversy as being largely a matter of mutual miscommunication and misunderstanding. In this view, both East and West are at fault for failing to allow for a \"plurality of theologies\". Each side went astray in considering their theological framework as the only one that was doctrinally valid and applicable. Thus, neither side would accept that the dispute was not so much about conflicting dogmas as it was about different ''[[theologoumenon|theologoumena]]'' or theological perspectives. While all Christians must be in agreement on questions of [[dogma]], there is room for diversity in theological approaches.{{sfn|Cunliffe-Jones|2006|pp=208\u2013209}}\n\nThis view is vehemently opposed by those in Eastern Orthodox Church whom Cunliffe-Jones identifies as holding a \"rigorist\" view. According to standard Eastern Orthodox position, as pronounced by [[Photius]], [[Mark of Ephesus]] and 20th century Eastern Orthodox theologians such as [[Vladimir Lossky]], the ''Filioque'' question hinges on fundamental issues of dogma and cannot be dismissed as simply one of different ''theologoumena''. Many in the \"rigorist\" camp consider the ''Filioque'' to have resulted in the role of the Holy Spirit being underestimated by the Western Church and thus leading to serious doctrinal error.{{sfn|Cunliffe-Jones|2006|pp=208\u2013209}}\n\nIn a similar vein, Siecienski comments that, although it was common in the 20th century to view the ''Filioque'' as just another weapon in the power struggle between Rome and Constantinople and although this was occasionally the case, for many involved in the dispute, the theological issues outweighed by far the ecclesiological concerns. According to Siecienski, the deeper question was perhaps whether Eastern and Western Christianity had wound up developing \"differing and ultimately incompatible teachings about the nature of God\". Moreover, Siecienski asserts that the question of whether the teachings of East and West were truly incompatible became almost secondary to the fact that, starting around the 8th or 9th century, Christians on both sides of the dispute began to believe that the differences ''were'' irreconcilable.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|pp=4\u20136}}\n\nFrom the view of the West, the Eastern rejection of the ''Filioque'' denied the [[consubstantiality]] of the Father and the Son and was thus a form of crypto-[[Arianism]].

Among the Church leaders in Frankish Kingdom of that time a notion was developing that Filioque clause was in fact an authentic part of the original Creed.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=92}} Trying to deal with that problem and its potentially dangerous consequences, the Church of Rome found itself in the middle of a widening rift between its own Daughter-Church in Frankish Kingdom and Sister-Churches of the East. Popes of that time, [[Pope Hadrian I|Hadrian I]] and [[Pope Leo III|Leo III]], had to face various challenges while trying to find solutions that would preserve the unity of the Church.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1996|p=38}}\n\nFirst signs of the problems were starting to show by the end of the reign of Frankish king [[Pepin the Short]] (751-768). Use of the ''Filioque'' clause in the Frankish Kingdom led to controversy with envoys of the Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]] at the Synod of Gentilly (767).{{sfn|Maas|1909}}{{sfn|Hinson|1995|p=315}}{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=90}} As the practice of chanting the interpolated Latin ''{{lang|la|Credo}}'' at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] spread in the West, the ''Filioque'' became a part of the [[Latin Rite]] liturgy throughout the Frankish Kingdom. The practice of chanting the Creed was adopted in Charlemagne's court by the end of the 8th century and spread through all of his realms, including some northern parts of Italy, but not to Rome, where its use was not accepted until 1014.{{sfn|Dix|2005|pp=485\u2013488}}{{sfn|Louth|2007|p=142}}\n\nSerious problems erupted in 787 after the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] when Charlemagne accused the Patriarch [[Tarasios of Constantinople]] of infidelity to the faith of the First Council of Nicaea, allegedly because he had not professed the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father \"and the Son\", but only \"through the Son\". [[Pope Adrian I]] rejected those accusations and tried to explain to the Frankish king that pneumatology of Tarasios was in accordance with the teachings of the holy Fathers.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=91}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=237}}{{efn|Charlemagne's legates claimed that Tarasius, at his installation, did not follow the Nicene faith and profess that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, but confessed rather his procession from the Father ''through the Son'' (Mansi 13.760). The Pope strongly rejected Charlemagne's protest, showing at length that Tarasius and the Council, on this and other points, maintained the faith of the Fathers (ibid. 759\u2013810).}} Surprisingly, efforts of the pope had no effect.\n\nTrue scale of the problem became evident during the following years. The Frankish view of the ''Filioque'' was emphasized again in the ''[[Libri Carolini]]'', composed around 791\u2013793.{{efn|Following this exchange of letters with the pope, Charlemagne commissioned the ''Libri Carolini'' (791\u2013793) to challenge the positions both of the iconoclast council of 754 and of the Council of Nicaea of 787 on the veneration of icons. Again because of poor translations, the Carolingians misunderstood the actual decision of the latter Council.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}}} Openly arguing that the word ''Filioque'' was part of the Creed of 381, the authors of ''Libri Carolini'' demonstrated not only the surprising lack of basic knowledge but also the lack of will to receive right advice and council from the Mother-Church in Rome. Frankish theologians reaffirmed the notion that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, and rejected as inadequate the teaching that the Spirit proceeds from the Father ''through the Son''.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=91-93}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=237}} That claim was both erroneous and dangerous for the preservation of the unity of the Church.\n\nIn those days, another theological problem appeared to be closely connected with the use of Filioque in the West. In the late 8th century, a controversy arose between Bishop [[Elipandus of Toledo]] and [[Beatus of Li\u00e9bana]] over the former's teaching (which has been called [[Spanish Adoptionism]]) that Christ in his humanity was the adoptive son of God. Elipandus was supported by Bishop [[Felix of Urgel]]. In 785, Pope Hadrian I condemned the teaching of Elipandus. In 791, Felix appealed to Charlemagne in defense of the Spanish Adoptionist teaching, sending him a tract outlining it. He was condemned at the Synod of Regensburg (792) and was sent to Pope Hadrian in Rome, where he made of profession of orthodox faith, but returned to Spain and there reaffirmed Adoptionism. Elipandus wrote to the bishops of the territories controlled by Charlemagne in defence of his teaching, which was condemned at the [[Council of Frankfurt]] (794) and at the Synod of [[Friuli]] (796). The controversy encouraged those who rejected Adoptionism to introduce into the liturgy the use of the Creed, with the ''Filioque'', to profess belief that Christ was the Son from eternity, not adopted as a son at his baptism.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=93-94}}{{sfn|Dales|2013|pp=61\u201367}}\n\nAt the Synod of Friuli, [[Paulinus II of Aquileia]] stated that the insertion of ''Filioque'' in the 381 Creed of the [[First Council of Constantinople]] was no more a violation of the prohibition of new creeds than were the insertions into the 325 Creed of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] that were done by the First Council of Constantinople itself. What was forbidden, he said, was adding or removing something \"craftily ... contrary to the sacred intentions of the fathers\", not a council's addition that could be shown to be in line with the intentions of the Fathers and the faith of the ancient Church. Actions such as that of the First Council of Contantinople were sometimes called for in order to clarify the faith and do away with heresies that appear.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=93}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=238}}{{sfn|Kelly|2014|p=364}} The views of Paulinus show that some advocates of Filioque clause were quite aware of the fact that it actually was not part of the Creed.{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=238}}\n\nPolitical events that followed additionally complicated the issue. According to [[John Meyendorff]],{{sfn|Meyendorff|1996|pp=41\u201343, 195\u2013197}} and [[John Romanides]]<ref name=\"Romanides1\"/> the Frankish efforts to get new [[Pope Leo III]] to approve the addition of ''Filioque'' to the Creed were due to a desire of [[Charlemagne]], who in 800 had been crowned in Rome as Emperor, to find grounds for accusations of heresy against the East. The Pope's refusal to approve the interpolation of the ''Filioque'' into the Creed avoided arousing a conflict between East and West about this matter. During his reign ({{Reign|795|816|lk=abbr}}), and for another two centuries, there was no Creed at all in the [[Roman rite]] Mass.\n\nReasons for the continuing refusal of the Frankish Church to adopt the positions of the Church of Rome on necessity of leaving Filioque outside of Creed remained unknown. Faced with another endorsement of the Filioque clause at the Frankish [[Council of Aachen (809)]] pope Leo III denied his approval and publicly posted the Creed in Rome without the Filioque, written in Greek and Latin on two silver plaques, in defense of the Orthodox Faith (810) stating his opposition to the addition of the ''Filioque'' into the Creed.{{sfn|ODCC|2005|loc=\"Filioque\"}}{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=91-93}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=238-239}} Although Leo III did not disapprove the ''Filioque'' doctrine, the Pope strongly believed the clause should not be included into the Creed.{{sfn|Maas|1909}}{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}{{sfn|ODCC|2005|loc=\"Filioque\"}}{{efn|\"Leo III defended the Filioque outside the Creed.}} In spite of the efforts of the Church of Rome, the acceptance of the Filioque clause in the Creed of the Frankish Church proved to be irreversible.\n\nIn 808 or 809 apparent controversy arose in Jerusalem between the Greek monks of one monastery and the Frankish Benedictine monks of another: the Greeks reproached the latter for, among other things, singing the creed with the ''Filioque'' included.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}{{sfn|Schmaus|1975}}{{sfn|Harnack|1898|loc=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma5.ii.ii.i.vi.iv.html ch. 6 \u00a72]}} In response, the theology of the ''Filioque'' was expressed in the 809 local [[Council of Aachen (809)]].{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}{{sfn|Harnack|1898|loc=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma5.ii.ii.i.vi.iv.html ch. 6 \u00a72]}}{{sfn|Bray|1983|p=121}}\n\n===Photian controversy===\nAround 860 the controversy over the ''Filioque'' broke out in the course of the disputes between Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople]] and [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople]].

And this is so precisely because the Spirit is distinguished by two specific properties. Therefore He is inferior to the Son, Who in turn is of the same nature as the Father!

All the other divergences which, historically, accompanied or followed the first dogmatic controversy about the Filioque, in the measure in which they too had some dogmatic importance, are more or less dependent upon that original issue. ... If other questions have arisen and taken the first place in more recent inter-confessional debates, that is chiefly because the dogmatic plane on which the thought of theologians operates is no longer the same as it was in the medieval period.\"{{sfn|Lossky|2003|p=163}}}}\n\nWestern churches have arrived at the position that, although the ''Filioque'' is doctrinally sound, the way that it was inserted into the Nicene Creed has created an unnecessary obstacle to ecumenical dialogue. Thus, without abandoning the ''Filioque'', some Western churches have come to accept that it could be omitted from the Creed without violating any core theological principles. This accommodation on the part of Western Churches has the objective of allowing both East and West to once again to share a common understanding of the Creed as the traditional and fundamental statement of the Christian faith.<!-- hubpages.com is on the spam blacklist; need to get this page whitelisted before it can be included <ref name=MacKinlay>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=McKinlay |title=The Filioque in the Nicene Creed: a hindrance to Christian unity |url=http://brianmckinlay.hubpages.com/hub/The-Filioque-in-the-Nicene-Creed |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref> -->\n\n===Old Catholic Church===\nImmediately after the [[Old Catholic Church]] separated from the [[Catholic Church]] in 1871, its theologians initiated contact with the Orthodox Church.

The conferences discussed a number of issues including the filioque controversy. From the outset, Old Catholic theologians agreed with the Orthodox position that the ''Filioque'' had been introduced in the West in an unacceptably non-canonical way. It was at these Bonn conferences that the Old Catholics became the first Western church to omit the ''Filioque'' from the Nicene Creed.{{sfn|Guretzki|2009|p=11}}{{sfn|Moltmann|1993|pp=179\u2013180}}<ref name=\"ThomasWondra2002\">{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Owen C. |last2=Wondra|first2=Ellen K.|author-link2=Ellen Wondra |title=Introduction to theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dK4Ay-bhbcC&pg=PA221|accessdate=22 December 2011|date=1 July 2002|publisher=Church Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-8192-1897-1|page=221}}</ref>\n\n===Anglican Communion===\nThree [[Lambeth Conferences]] (1888, 1978 and 1988) have recommended that the ''Filioque'' be dropped from the Nicene Creed by churches that belong to the Anglican Communion.<!--<ref name=MacKinlay />-->\n\nThe 1930 Lambeth Conference initiated formal theological dialogue between representatives of the Anglican and Orthodox churches.<ref name=\"KennedyKennedy2008\">{{cite book|author1=David J.

In October 2003, the Consultation issued an agreed statement, ''The Filioque: a Church-dividing issue?'', which provides an extensive review of Scripture, history, and theology.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}} The recommendations include:\n\n#That all involved in such dialogue expressly recognize the limitations of our ability to make definitive assertions about the inner life of God.\n#That, in the future, because of the progress in mutual understanding that has come about in recent decades, Orthodox and Catholics refrain from labeling as heretical the traditions of the other side on the subject of the procession of the Holy Spirit.\n#That Orthodox and Catholic theologians distinguish more clearly between the divinity and hypostatic identity of the Holy Spirit (which is a received dogma of our Churches) and the manner of the Spirit's origin, which still awaits full and final ecumenical resolution.\n#That those engaged in dialogue on this issue distinguish, as far as possible, the theological issues of the origin of the Holy Spirit from the ecclesiological issues of primacy and doctrinal authority in the Church, even as we pursue both questions seriously, together.\n#That the theological dialogue between our Churches also give careful consideration to the status of later councils held in both our Churches after those seven generally received as ecumenical.\n#That the Catholic Church, as a consequence of the normative and irrevocable dogmatic value of the [[Nicene Creed#Niceno\u2013Constantinopolitan Creed|Creed of 381]], use the original Greek text alone in making translations of that Creed for catechetical and liturgical use.\n#That the Catholic Church, following a growing theological consensus, and in particular the statements made by [[Pope Paul VI]], declare that the condemnation made at the [[Second Council of Lyons]] (1274) of those \"who presume to deny that the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son\" is no longer applicable.\n\nIn the judgment of the consultation, the question of the ''Filioque'' is no longer a \"Church-dividing\" issue, which would impede full reconciliation and full communion. It is for the bishops of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches to review this work and to make whatever decisions would be appropriate.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}\n\n==Summary==\nWhile the Filioque doctrine was traditional in the West, being declared dogmatically in 447 by Pope Leo I, the Pope whose ''Tome'' was approved at the [[Council of Chalcedon]],{{refn|Leo I Letter 28 ''to Flavian'' ([[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume XIV/The Fourth Ecumenical Council/The Tome of St. Leo|NPNF2 14:254\u2013258]]); {{CCC|247}}.}} its inclusion in the Creed appeared in the [[Arian controversy|anti-Arian]] situation of [[History of Spain#Visigothic Hispania (5th\u20138th centuries)|7th-century Spain]]. However, this dogma was never accepted in the East.

It is not in the original text of the Creed, attributed to the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381), the [[second ecumenical council]], which says that the [[Holy Spirit]] proceeds \"from the Father\", without additions of any kind, such as \"and the Son\" or \"alone\".{{sfn|RCA|2002|p=70}}\n\nIn the late 6th century, some [[Latin Church]]es added the words \"and from the Son\" (''Filioque'') to the description of the procession of the Holy Spirit, in what many Eastern Orthodox Christians have at a later stage argued is a violation of Canon VII<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.x.html Canon VII]</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2020}} of the [[Council of Ephesus]], since the words were not included in the text by either the [[First Council of Nicaea]] or that of Constantinople.<ref>For a different view, see e.g. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.xi.html Excursus on the Words \u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f11\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd]</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2020}} This was incorporated into the liturgical practice of Rome in 1014,<ref name=\"Catholic Greek-Latin\" /> but was rejected by Eastern Christianity.\n\nWhether that term ''Filioque'' is included, as well as how it is translated and understood, can have important implications for how one understands the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], which is central to the majority of Christian churches. For some, the term implies a serious underestimation of [[God the Father]]'s role in the Trinity; for others, its denial implies a serious underestimation of the role of [[God the Son]] in the Trinity.\n\nThe term has been an ongoing source of conflict between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity, contributing, in major part, to the [[East\u2013West Schism]] of 1054 and proving to be an obstacle to attempts to reunify the two sides.{{sfnm|Congar|1959|1p=44|Meyendorff|1987|2p=181|NAOCTC|2003}} There have been attempts at resolving the conflict. Among the early attempts at harmonization are the works of [[Maximus the Confessor]], who notably was canonised independently by both Eastern and Western churches. Differences over this doctrine and the question of [[Primacy of the Bishop of Rome|papal primacy]] have been and remain primary causes of schism between the Eastern Orthodox and Western churches.{{sfn|Larchet|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|WCCFO|1979}}\n\n==Nicene Creed==\nThe Nicene Creed as amended by the Second Ecumenical Council held in Constantinople in 381 includes the section\n<blockquote><poem>''Et in Spiritum Sanctum, Dominum et vivificantem\n'''qui ex Patre procedit'''\n''qui cum Patre, et Filio simul adoratur, et cum glorificatur.''</poem></blockquote>\n\nTranslated in English:\n<blockquote><poem>''[I believe] in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,''\n'''who proceeds from the Father,'''\n''who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified.''{{refn|{{OED|filioque, n|70207}}}}</poem></blockquote>\n\nThe controversy arises from the insertion of the word ''Filioque'' (\"and the Son\") in the line:\n<blockquote><poem>...''qui ex Patre '''Filioque''' procedit''...\n\n...''who proceeds from the Father '''and the Son'''''...</poem></blockquote>\n\n==Controversy==\nThe controversy referring to the term ''Filioque'' involves four separate disagreements:\n* about the term itself\n* about the orthodoxy of the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son, to which the term refers\n* about the legitimacy of inserting the term into the  Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed,\n* about the authority of the Pope to define the orthodoxy of the doctrine or to insert the term into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. \n\nAlthough the disagreement about the doctrine preceded the disagreement about the insertion into the Creed, the two disagreements became linked to the third when the pope approved insertion of the term into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, in the 11th century. Anthony Siecienski writes that \"Ultimately what was at stake was not only God's trinitarian nature, but also the nature of the Church, its teaching authority and the distribution of power among its leaders.\"{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|pp=4\u20135}}\n\n[[Hubert Cunliffe-Jones]] identifies two opposing Eastern Orthodox opinions about the ''Filioque'', a \"liberal\" view and a \"rigorist\" view. The \"liberal\" view sees the controversy as being largely a matter of mutual miscommunication and misunderstanding. In this view, both East and West are at fault for failing to allow for a \"plurality of theologies\". Each side went astray in considering their theological framework as the only one that was doctrinally valid and applicable. Thus, neither side would accept that the dispute was not so much about conflicting dogmas as it was about different ''[[theologoumenon|theologoumena]]'' or theological perspectives. While all Christians must be in agreement on questions of [[dogma]], there is room for diversity in theological approaches.{{sfn|Cunliffe-Jones|2006|pp=208\u2013209}}\n\nThis view is vehemently opposed by those in Eastern Orthodox Church whom Cunliffe-Jones identifies as holding a \"rigorist\" view. According to standard Eastern Orthodox position, as pronounced by [[Photius]], [[Mark of Ephesus]] and 20th century Eastern Orthodox theologians such as [[Vladimir Lossky]], the ''Filioque'' question hinges on fundamental issues of dogma and cannot be dismissed as simply one of different ''theologoumena''. Many in the \"rigorist\" camp consider the ''Filioque'' to have resulted in the role of the Holy Spirit being underestimated by the Western Church and thus leading to serious doctrinal error.{{sfn|Cunliffe-Jones|2006|pp=208\u2013209}}\n\nIn a similar vein, Siecienski comments that, although it was common in the 20th century to view the ''Filioque'' as just another weapon in the power struggle between Rome and Constantinople and although this was occasionally the case, for many involved in the dispute, the theological issues outweighed by far the ecclesiological concerns. According to Siecienski, the deeper question was perhaps whether Eastern and Western Christianity had wound up developing \"differing and ultimately incompatible teachings about the nature of God\". Moreover, Siecienski asserts that the question of whether the teachings of East and West were truly incompatible became almost secondary to the fact that, starting around the 8th or 9th century, Christians on both sides of the dispute began to believe that the differences ''were'' irreconcilable.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|pp=4\u20136}}\n\nFrom the view of the West, the Eastern rejection of the ''Filioque'' denied the [[consubstantiality]] of the Father and the Son and was thus a form of crypto-[[Arianism]].

Among the Church leaders in Frankish Kingdom of that time a notion was developing that Filioque clause was in fact an authentic part of the original Creed.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=92}} Trying to deal with that problem and its potentially dangerous consequences, the Church of Rome found itself in the middle of a widening rift between its own Daughter-Church in Frankish Kingdom and Sister-Churches of the East. Popes of that time, [[Pope Hadrian I|Hadrian I]] and [[Pope Leo III|Leo III]], had to face various challenges while trying to find solutions that would preserve the unity of the Church.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1996|p=38}}\n\nFirst signs of the problems were starting to show by the end of the reign of Frankish king [[Pepin the Short]] (751-768). Use of the ''Filioque'' clause in the Frankish Kingdom led to controversy with envoys of the Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]] at the Synod of Gentilly (767).{{sfn|Maas|1909}}{{sfn|Hinson|1995|p=315}}{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=90}} As the practice of chanting the interpolated Latin ''{{lang|la|Credo}}'' at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] spread in the West, the ''Filioque'' became a part of the [[Latin Rite]] liturgy throughout the Frankish Kingdom. The practice of chanting the Creed was adopted in Charlemagne's court by the end of the 8th century and spread through all of his realms, including some northern parts of Italy, but not to Rome, where its use was not accepted until 1014.{{sfn|Dix|2005|pp=485\u2013488}}{{sfn|Louth|2007|p=142}}\n\nSerious problems erupted in 787 after the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] when Charlemagne accused the Patriarch [[Tarasios of Constantinople]] of infidelity to the faith of the First Council of Nicaea, allegedly because he had not professed the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father \"and the Son\", but only \"through the Son\". [[Pope Adrian I]] rejected those accusations and tried to explain to the Frankish king that pneumatology of Tarasios was in accordance with the teachings of the holy Fathers.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=91}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=237}}{{efn|Charlemagne's legates claimed that Tarasius, at his installation, did not follow the Nicene faith and profess that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, but confessed rather his procession from the Father ''through the Son'' (Mansi 13.760). The Pope strongly rejected Charlemagne's protest, showing at length that Tarasius and the Council, on this and other points, maintained the faith of the Fathers (ibid. 759\u2013810).}} Surprisingly, efforts of the pope had no effect.\n\nTrue scale of the problem became evident during the following years. The Frankish view of the ''Filioque'' was emphasized again in the ''[[Libri Carolini]]'', composed around 791\u2013793.{{efn|Following this exchange of letters with the pope, Charlemagne commissioned the ''Libri Carolini'' (791\u2013793) to challenge the positions both of the iconoclast council of 754 and of the Council of Nicaea of 787 on the veneration of icons. Again because of poor translations, the Carolingians misunderstood the actual decision of the latter Council.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}}} Openly arguing that the word ''Filioque'' was part of the Creed of 381, the authors of ''Libri Carolini'' demonstrated not only the surprising lack of basic knowledge but also the lack of will to receive right advice and council from the Mother-Church in Rome. Frankish theologians reaffirmed the notion that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, and rejected as inadequate the teaching that the Spirit proceeds from the Father ''through the Son''.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=91-93}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=237}} That claim was both erroneous and dangerous for the preservation of the unity of the Church.\n\nIn those days, another theological problem appeared to be closely connected with the use of Filioque in the West. In the late 8th century, a controversy arose between Bishop [[Elipandus of Toledo]] and [[Beatus of Li\u00e9bana]] over the former's teaching (which has been called [[Spanish Adoptionism]]) that Christ in his humanity was the adoptive son of God. Elipandus was supported by Bishop [[Felix of Urgel]]. In 785, Pope Hadrian I condemned the teaching of Elipandus. In 791, Felix appealed to Charlemagne in defense of the Spanish Adoptionist teaching, sending him a tract outlining it. He was condemned at the Synod of Regensburg (792) and was sent to Pope Hadrian in Rome, where he made of profession of orthodox faith, but returned to Spain and there reaffirmed Adoptionism. Elipandus wrote to the bishops of the territories controlled by Charlemagne in defence of his teaching, which was condemned at the [[Council of Frankfurt]] (794) and at the Synod of [[Friuli]] (796). The controversy encouraged those who rejected Adoptionism to introduce into the liturgy the use of the Creed, with the ''Filioque'', to profess belief that Christ was the Son from eternity, not adopted as a son at his baptism.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=93-94}}{{sfn|Dales|2013|pp=61\u201367}}\n\nAt the Synod of Friuli, [[Paulinus II of Aquileia]] stated that the insertion of ''Filioque'' in the 381 Creed of the [[First Council of Constantinople]] was no more a violation of the prohibition of new creeds than were the insertions into the 325 Creed of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] that were done by the First Council of Constantinople itself. What was forbidden, he said, was adding or removing something \"craftily ... contrary to the sacred intentions of the fathers\", not a council's addition that could be shown to be in line with the intentions of the Fathers and the faith of the ancient Church. Actions such as that of the First Council of Contantinople were sometimes called for in order to clarify the faith and do away with heresies that appear.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=93}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=238}}{{sfn|Kelly|2014|p=364}} The views of Paulinus show that some advocates of Filioque clause were quite aware of the fact that it actually was not part of the Creed.{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=238}}\n\nPolitical events that followed additionally complicated the issue. According to [[John Meyendorff]],{{sfn|Meyendorff|1996|pp=41\u201343, 195\u2013197}} and [[John Romanides]]<ref name=\"Romanides1\"/> the Frankish efforts to get new [[Pope Leo III]] to approve the addition of ''Filioque'' to the Creed were due to a desire of [[Charlemagne]], who in 800 had been crowned in Rome as Emperor, to find grounds for accusations of heresy against the East. The Pope's refusal to approve the interpolation of the ''Filioque'' into the Creed avoided arousing a conflict between East and West about this matter. During his reign ({{Reign|795|816|lk=abbr}}), and for another two centuries, there was no Creed at all in the [[Roman rite]] Mass.\n\nReasons for the continuing refusal of the Frankish Church to adopt the positions of the Church of Rome on necessity of leaving Filioque outside of Creed remained unknown. Faced with another endorsement of the Filioque clause at the Frankish [[Council of Aachen (809)]] pope Leo III denied his approval and publicly posted the Creed in Rome without the Filioque, written in Greek and Latin on two silver plaques, in defense of the Orthodox Faith (810) stating his opposition to the addition of the ''Filioque'' into the Creed.{{sfn|ODCC|2005|loc=\"Filioque\"}}{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=91-93}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=238-239}} Although Leo III did not disapprove the ''Filioque'' doctrine, the Pope strongly believed the clause should not be included into the Creed.{{sfn|Maas|1909}}{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}{{sfn|ODCC|2005|loc=\"Filioque\"}}{{efn|\"Leo III defended the Filioque outside the Creed.}} In spite of the efforts of the Church of Rome, the acceptance of the Filioque clause in the Creed of the Frankish Church proved to be irreversible.\n\nIn 808 or 809 apparent controversy arose in Jerusalem between the Greek monks of one monastery and the Frankish Benedictine monks of another: the Greeks reproached the latter for, among other things, singing the creed with the ''Filioque'' included.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}{{sfn|Schmaus|1975}}{{sfn|Harnack|1898|loc=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma5.ii.ii.i.vi.iv.html ch. 6 \u00a72]}} In response, the theology of the ''Filioque'' was expressed in the 809 local [[Council of Aachen (809)]].{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}{{sfn|Harnack|1898|loc=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma5.ii.ii.i.vi.iv.html ch. 6 \u00a72]}}{{sfn|Bray|1983|p=121}}\n\n===Photian controversy===\nAround 860 the controversy over the ''Filioque'' broke out in the course of the disputes between Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople]] and [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople]].

And this is so precisely because the Spirit is distinguished by two specific properties. Therefore He is inferior to the Son, Who in turn is of the same nature as the Father!

All the other divergences which, historically, accompanied or followed the first dogmatic controversy about the Filioque, in the measure in which they too had some dogmatic importance, are more or less dependent upon that original issue. ... If other questions have arisen and taken the first place in more recent inter-confessional debates, that is chiefly because the dogmatic plane on which the thought of theologians operates is no longer the same as it was in the medieval period.\"{{sfn|Lossky|2003|p=163}}}}\n\nWestern churches have arrived at the position that, although the ''Filioque'' is doctrinally sound, the way that it was inserted into the Nicene Creed has created an unnecessary obstacle to ecumenical dialogue. Thus, without abandoning the ''Filioque'', some Western churches have come to accept that it could be omitted from the Creed without violating any core theological principles. This accommodation on the part of Western Churches has the objective of allowing both East and West to once again to share a common understanding of the Creed as the traditional and fundamental statement of the Christian faith.<!-- hubpages.com is on the spam blacklist; need to get this page whitelisted before it can be included <ref name=MacKinlay>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=McKinlay |title=The Filioque in the Nicene Creed: a hindrance to Christian unity |url=http://brianmckinlay.hubpages.com/hub/The-Filioque-in-the-Nicene-Creed |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref> -->\n\n===Old Catholic Church===\nImmediately after the [[Old Catholic Church]] separated from the [[Catholic Church]] in 1871, its theologians initiated contact with the Orthodox Church.

The conferences discussed a number of issues including the filioque controversy. From the outset, Old Catholic theologians agreed with the Orthodox position that the ''Filioque'' had been introduced in the West in an unacceptably non-canonical way. It was at these Bonn conferences that the Old Catholics became the first Western church to omit the ''Filioque'' from the Nicene Creed.{{sfn|Guretzki|2009|p=11}}{{sfn|Moltmann|1993|pp=179\u2013180}}<ref name=\"ThomasWondra2002\">{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Owen C. |last2=Wondra|first2=Ellen K.|author-link2=Ellen Wondra |title=Introduction to theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dK4Ay-bhbcC&pg=PA221|accessdate=22 December 2011|date=1 July 2002|publisher=Church Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-8192-1897-1|page=221}}</ref>\n\n===Anglican Communion===\nThree [[Lambeth Conferences]] (1888, 1978 and 1988) have recommended that the ''Filioque'' be dropped from the Nicene Creed by churches that belong to the Anglican Communion.<!--<ref name=MacKinlay />-->\n\nThe 1930 Lambeth Conference initiated formal theological dialogue between representatives of the Anglican and Orthodox churches.<ref name=\"KennedyKennedy2008\">{{cite book|author1=David J.

In October 2003, the Consultation issued an agreed statement, ''The Filioque: a Church-dividing issue?'', which provides an extensive review of Scripture, history, and theology.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}} The recommendations include:\n\n#That all involved in such dialogue expressly recognize the limitations of our ability to make definitive assertions about the inner life of God.\n#That, in the future, because of the progress in mutual understanding that has come about in recent decades, Orthodox and Catholics refrain from labeling as heretical the traditions of the other side on the subject of the procession of the Holy Spirit.\n#That Orthodox and Catholic theologians distinguish more clearly between the divinity and hypostatic identity of the Holy Spirit (which is a received dogma of our Churches) and the manner of the Spirit's origin, which still awaits full and final ecumenical resolution.\n#That those engaged in dialogue on this issue distinguish, as far as possible, the theological issues of the origin of the Holy Spirit from the ecclesiological issues of primacy and doctrinal authority in the Church, even as we pursue both questions seriously, together.\n#That the theological dialogue between our Churches also give careful consideration to the status of later councils held in both our Churches after those seven generally received as ecumenical.\n#That the Catholic Church, as a consequence of the normative and irrevocable dogmatic value of the [[Nicene Creed#Niceno\u2013Constantinopolitan Creed|Creed of 381]], use the original Greek text alone in making translations of that Creed for catechetical and liturgical use.\n#That the Catholic Church, following a growing theological consensus, and in particular the statements made by [[Pope Paul VI]], declare that the condemnation made at the [[Second Council of Lyons]] (1274) of those \"who presume to deny that the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son\" is no longer applicable.\n\nIn the judgment of the consultation, the question of the ''Filioque'' is no longer a \"Church-dividing\" issue, which would impede full reconciliation and full communion. It is for the bishops of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches to review this work and to make whatever decisions would be appropriate.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}\n\n==Summary==\nWhile the Filioque doctrine was traditional in the West, being declared dogmatically in 447 by Pope Leo I, the Pope whose ''Tome'' was approved at the [[Council of Chalcedon]],{{refn|Leo I Letter 28 ''to Flavian'' ([[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume XIV/The Fourth Ecumenical Council/The Tome of St. Leo|NPNF2 14:254\u2013258]]); {{CCC|247}}.}} its inclusion in the Creed appeared in the [[Arian controversy|anti-Arian]] situation of [[History of Spain#Visigothic Hispania (5th\u20138th centuries)|7th-century Spain]]. However, this dogma was never accepted in the East.

It is in the southern part on the east coast of [[Streymoy]].

They are separated by the Sand\u00e1 River. The city itself has a population of 19,165 (2019), and the greater urban area has a population of 21,078.\n\nThe Norse established their parliament on the [[Tinganes]] peninsula in AD 850.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torshavn.fo/Default.aspx?pageid=620|title=T\u00f3rshavn Municipality|website=T\u00f3rshavn Municipality}}</ref> T\u00f3rshavn thus became the capital of the Faroe Islands and has remained so ever since. All through the [[Middle Ages]] the narrow peninsula jutting out into the sea made up the main part of T\u00f3rshavn. Early on, T\u00f3rshavn became the centre of the islands' trade monopoly, thereby being the only legal place for the islanders to sell and buy goods. In 1856, the trade monopoly was abolished and the islands were left open to free trade.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\nIt is not known whether the site of T\u00f3rshavn was of interest to the Celtic monks who were [[History of the Faroe Islands|probably the first settlers]] in the Faroes.  The Viking settlers in the 9th century established their own parliaments, called ''[[Thing (assembly)|tings]]'', in different parts of the islands, it being the tradition in each case to hold the ''ting'' at a neutral and thus uninhabited place, so no one location gave anyone an advantage.  The main ''ting'' for the islands was convoked in T\u00f3rshavn in 825, on [[Tinganes]], the [[peninsula]] that divides the harbour into two parts: ''Eystarav\u00e1g'' and ''Vestarav\u00e1g''. \n\nThe Vikings would thus meet on the flat rocks of Tinganes every summer, as the most central place on the islands, although there was no settlement at Tinganes at that time. The [[F\u00e6reyinga Saga]] says: \"the place of the ''ting'' of the Faroese was on Streymoy, and there is the harbour that is called T\u00f3rshavn\". The Viking age ended in 1035. The ''ting'' was followed by a market which gradually grew into a permanent trading area.\n\nAll through the [[Middle Ages]], the narrow peninsula jutting out into the sea made up the main part of T\u00f3rshavn. It belonged to the outfield of two farmers. Unlike other Faroese villages, T\u00f3rshavn was never a distinct farming community. During the 12th century, all trade between Norway and the Faroes, along with other tributary islands to the west, became centralised in [[Bergen]]. \n\nIn 1271, a royal trade monopoly was established in T\u00f3rshavn by the Norwegian Crown. According to a document from 1271, two ships would sail regularly to T\u00f3rshavn from Bergen with cargoes of salt, timber and cereal. T\u00f3rshavn therefore had more contact with the outside world than did the other villages.  Under the Norwegian, and then Danish rule, government officials made T\u00f3rshavn their home. All of these things, combined with the fact that T\u00f3rshavn was the seat of the ''ting'' of the islands, influenced the town's development.\n\n=== 1500\u20131800 ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\n[[File:T\u00f3rshavn skansin 8.jpg|thumb|[[Skansin]] fort has been rebuilt several times since it was first built in 1580. The current building dates back to 1790]]\n\nSources do not mention a built-up area in T\u00f3rshavn until after the Protestant reformation in 1539. In ca. 1580 a small fort, [[Skansin]], was built by the Faroese naval hero and trader [[Magnus Heinason]] at the north end of the harbour. Later small fortifications were built at Tinganes.\n\nIn 1584 T\u00f3rshavn had 101 inhabitants. The population was divided into three equally large groups made up of farmers, their families and servants, trade and government officials and people who owned no land and therefore not much else; this included the landless [[proletariat]] from the villages that during this period came to T\u00f3rshavn in search of work. They were set to guard duty on Skansin without pay, and for clothing and food they depended on the bounty of the farmers.\n\nIn 1655 king [[Frederick III of Denmark]] granted the Faroe Islands to his favourite statesman [[Kristoffer Gabel]], the rule of the von Gabel Family, 1655\u20131709, is known as ''Gablat\u00ed\u00f0in''. It is the darkest chapter in the history of T\u00f3rshavn. Gabel's administration suppressed the islanders in various ways. The trade monopoly was in the family's hands and it was not designed for the needs of the Faroese people. People across the country brought products into town and had to be satisfied with whatever price they were given. At the same time imported goods were limited and expensive. There came considerable complaints from the islands' inhabitants of unjust treatment by the civil administration in T\u00f3rshavn. These not only included the persons in charge of the monopoly trade, but also the [[bailiff]] and others. It was during this period, in 1673, that Tinganes was ravaged by a fire after a store of gunpowder kept at Tinganes had blown up. Many old houses burnt to the ground and old Faroese records were lost as were Gabel's documents.\n\nConditions improved in T\u00f3rshavn when the trade monopoly became a royal monopoly in 1709. The [[Danish Royal Trade Monopoly in the Faroe Islands|Danish royal trade monopoly]] was supplied with goods from [[Copenhagen]] three times a year. However, in 1709 T\u00f3rshavn was hit by a plague of smallpox, killing nearly the entire population. The town had by this time reached a population of 300 and 250 of the inhabitants died. Still, it was during the latter half of the 18th century that T\u00f3rshavn started to develop into a small town. This was while Niels Ryberg was in charge of the trade monopoly. From 1768 and during the next 20 years onwards Ryberg was allowed to carry on an entrepot trade which was mainly based on smuggling to England. Because of the French-British conflict there was room for this kind of operation. In T\u00f3rshavn his warehouses filled up with goods. Ryberg was the first person who thought of making a financial profit from fishing, which later became the most important economic factor to the islands. He experimented with salted cod and herring but at this point in time nothing much beyond this happened.\n\n[[T\u00f3rshavn Cathedral]] was first built in 1788 and partly rebuilt in 1865. Since 1990, it has been the seat of the Bishop of the Faroe Islands (in the [[Church of the Faroe Islands]]).\n\n=== 1800\u2013present ===\n[[File:Recherche Expedition 1839 T\u00f3rshavn.jpg|thumb|left|T\u00f3rshavn in 1839, by Barth\u00e9lemy Lauvergne]]\nOn 30 March 1808, during the Anglo-Danish [[Gunboat War]], the [[Cruizer class brig-sloop]] [[HMS Clio (1807)|HMS ''Clio'']] entered T\u00f3rshavn and briefly captured the fort at Skansin. The fort surrendered without firing a shot as the landing party approached. The ''Clio''s men [[Touch hole#Spiking the guns|spiked]] the fort's eight 18-pounder guns and took all the smaller guns and weapons before leaving. Shortly after 6 May a German privateer who had assumed the name \"Baron von Hompesch\" plundered the defenceless city and seized the property of the Danish Crown Monopoly. The Admiralty Prize Court, however, refused to condemn it as a lawful prize. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n[[File:Logting 1864, faroe islands.jpg|thumb|T\u00f3rshavn in 1864, the [[L\u00f8gting]] (parliament) is at top left]]\nIn 1856, free trade came to the Faroe Islands. By opening the islands to the world, it transformed the economy, with T\u00f3rshavn at its centre. The farming land was rented to townspeople who could later buy it if they wished.  These small plots of land enabled people to keep cows and sheep.  {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nIn 1866, T\u00f3rshavn's town council was founded. The town has been the capital of the Faroe Islands ever since. Later, in 1909, T\u00f3rshavn became a market town with the same municipal charter as Danish market towns. In 1913, the Danish [[Folketing]] granted DKK 810,000 to construction of a harbour in T\u00f3rshavn. Local waves are 3m, the waters are icefree and have a tidal variation of 0.3m, and storms from the west are mitigated by the gentle eastwards slope of the mountains. Other harbours were also benefitted with an 80% grant to a total build cost of DKK 1.6&nbsp;million.<ref name=ing1913>{{cite web |last1=Jagd |first1=N |url=http://www.e-pages.dk/ingarkiv/3131/15 |title=Havne paa F\u00e6r\u00f8erne |website=e-pages.dk |page=505\u2014513|publisher=[[Ingeni\u00f8ren]] |date=27 September 1913}}</ref> In 1927, T\u00f3rshavn had a modern harbour built.

All through the [[Middle Ages]] the narrow peninsula jutting out into the sea made up the main part of T\u00f3rshavn. Early on, T\u00f3rshavn became the centre of the islands' trade monopoly, thereby being the only legal place for the islanders to sell and buy goods. In 1856, the trade monopoly was abolished and the islands were left open to free trade.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\nIt is not known whether the site of T\u00f3rshavn was of interest to the Celtic monks who were [[History of the Faroe Islands|probably the first settlers]] in the Faroes.  The Viking settlers in the 9th century established their own parliaments, called ''[[Thing (assembly)|tings]]'', in different parts of the islands, it being the tradition in each case to hold the ''ting'' at a neutral and thus uninhabited place, so no one location gave anyone an advantage.  The main ''ting'' for the islands was convoked in T\u00f3rshavn in 825, on [[Tinganes]], the [[peninsula]] that divides the harbour into two parts: ''Eystarav\u00e1g'' and ''Vestarav\u00e1g''. \n\nThe Vikings would thus meet on the flat rocks of Tinganes every summer, as the most central place on the islands, although there was no settlement at Tinganes at that time. The [[F\u00e6reyinga Saga]] says: \"the place of the ''ting'' of the Faroese was on Streymoy, and there is the harbour that is called T\u00f3rshavn\". The Viking age ended in 1035. The ''ting'' was followed by a market which gradually grew into a permanent trading area.\n\nAll through the [[Middle Ages]], the narrow peninsula jutting out into the sea made up the main part of T\u00f3rshavn. It belonged to the outfield of two farmers. Unlike other Faroese villages, T\u00f3rshavn was never a distinct farming community. During the 12th century, all trade between Norway and the Faroes, along with other tributary islands to the west, became centralised in [[Bergen]]. \n\nIn 1271, a royal trade monopoly was established in T\u00f3rshavn by the Norwegian Crown. According to a document from 1271, two ships would sail regularly to T\u00f3rshavn from Bergen with cargoes of salt, timber and cereal. T\u00f3rshavn therefore had more contact with the outside world than did the other villages.  Under the Norwegian, and then Danish rule, government officials made T\u00f3rshavn their home. All of these things, combined with the fact that T\u00f3rshavn was the seat of the ''ting'' of the islands, influenced the town's development.\n\n=== 1500\u20131800 ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\n[[File:T\u00f3rshavn skansin 8.jpg|thumb|[[Skansin]] fort has been rebuilt several times since it was first built in 1580. The current building dates back to 1790]]\n\nSources do not mention a built-up area in T\u00f3rshavn until after the Protestant reformation in 1539. In ca. 1580 a small fort, [[Skansin]], was built by the Faroese naval hero and trader [[Magnus Heinason]] at the north end of the harbour. Later small fortifications were built at Tinganes.\n\nIn 1584 T\u00f3rshavn had 101 inhabitants. The population was divided into three equally large groups made up of farmers, their families and servants, trade and government officials and people who owned no land and therefore not much else; this included the landless [[proletariat]] from the villages that during this period came to T\u00f3rshavn in search of work. They were set to guard duty on Skansin without pay, and for clothing and food they depended on the bounty of the farmers.\n\nIn 1655 king [[Frederick III of Denmark]] granted the Faroe Islands to his favourite statesman [[Kristoffer Gabel]], the rule of the von Gabel Family, 1655\u20131709, is known as ''Gablat\u00ed\u00f0in''. It is the darkest chapter in the history of T\u00f3rshavn. Gabel's administration suppressed the islanders in various ways. The trade monopoly was in the family's hands and it was not designed for the needs of the Faroese people. People across the country brought products into town and had to be satisfied with whatever price they were given. At the same time imported goods were limited and expensive. There came considerable complaints from the islands' inhabitants of unjust treatment by the civil administration in T\u00f3rshavn. These not only included the persons in charge of the monopoly trade, but also the [[bailiff]] and others. It was during this period, in 1673, that Tinganes was ravaged by a fire after a store of gunpowder kept at Tinganes had blown up. Many old houses burnt to the ground and old Faroese records were lost as were Gabel's documents.\n\nConditions improved in T\u00f3rshavn when the trade monopoly became a royal monopoly in 1709. The [[Danish Royal Trade Monopoly in the Faroe Islands|Danish royal trade monopoly]] was supplied with goods from [[Copenhagen]] three times a year. However, in 1709 T\u00f3rshavn was hit by a plague of smallpox, killing nearly the entire population. The town had by this time reached a population of 300 and 250 of the inhabitants died. Still, it was during the latter half of the 18th century that T\u00f3rshavn started to develop into a small town. This was while Niels Ryberg was in charge of the trade monopoly. From 1768 and during the next 20 years onwards Ryberg was allowed to carry on an entrepot trade which was mainly based on smuggling to England. Because of the French-British conflict there was room for this kind of operation. In T\u00f3rshavn his warehouses filled up with goods. Ryberg was the first person who thought of making a financial profit from fishing, which later became the most important economic factor to the islands. He experimented with salted cod and herring but at this point in time nothing much beyond this happened.\n\n[[T\u00f3rshavn Cathedral]] was first built in 1788 and partly rebuilt in 1865. Since 1990, it has been the seat of the Bishop of the Faroe Islands (in the [[Church of the Faroe Islands]]).\n\n=== 1800\u2013present ===\n[[File:Recherche Expedition 1839 T\u00f3rshavn.jpg|thumb|left|T\u00f3rshavn in 1839, by Barth\u00e9lemy Lauvergne]]\nOn 30 March 1808, during the Anglo-Danish [[Gunboat War]], the [[Cruizer class brig-sloop]] [[HMS Clio (1807)|HMS ''Clio'']] entered T\u00f3rshavn and briefly captured the fort at Skansin. The fort surrendered without firing a shot as the landing party approached. The ''Clio''s men [[Touch hole#Spiking the guns|spiked]] the fort's eight 18-pounder guns and took all the smaller guns and weapons before leaving. Shortly after 6 May a German privateer who had assumed the name \"Baron von Hompesch\" plundered the defenceless city and seized the property of the Danish Crown Monopoly. The Admiralty Prize Court, however, refused to condemn it as a lawful prize. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n[[File:Logting 1864, faroe islands.jpg|thumb|T\u00f3rshavn in 1864, the [[L\u00f8gting]] (parliament) is at top left]]\nIn 1856, free trade came to the Faroe Islands. By opening the islands to the world, it transformed the economy, with T\u00f3rshavn at its centre. The farming land was rented to townspeople who could later buy it if they wished.  These small plots of land enabled people to keep cows and sheep.  {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nIn 1866, T\u00f3rshavn's town council was founded. The town has been the capital of the Faroe Islands ever since. Later, in 1909, T\u00f3rshavn became a market town with the same municipal charter as Danish market towns. In 1913, the Danish [[Folketing]] granted DKK 810,000 to construction of a harbour in T\u00f3rshavn. Local waves are 3m, the waters are icefree and have a tidal variation of 0.3m, and storms from the west are mitigated by the gentle eastwards slope of the mountains.

The temperature amplitude in the period from 1961 to 2010 is a mere {{convert|33|C-change}} between the absolute warmest and coldest temperatures.\n\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|location =

''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]''. He holds a doctorate in [[clinical psychology]]. However, he is not licensed to practice. McGraw first gained celebrity status with appearances on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in the late 1990s.\n\nRaised in the [[South Central United States]], McGraw played college football for the [[University of Tulsa]] and [[Midwestern State University]], where he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[psychology]]. He then earned his [[Master of Arts]] in [[experimental psychology]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[clinical psychology]] from the [[University of North Texas]]. He began working in private practice for several years while also holding large seminars for patients.\n\nMcGraw's fame began in 1998, when he began making weekly appearances on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show''. [[Oprah Winfrey]] then helped McGraw launch his own program, ''Dr. Phil'', in September 2002. The show is formatted as an advice show. In October 2003, he launched the Dr. Phil Foundation which is dedicated toward fighting [[childhood obesity]].\n\n==Early life==\nMcGraw was born in [[Vinita, Oklahoma|Vinita]], Oklahoma, on September 1, 1950, the son of Joseph J.

It was intended as a place from which to recruit Union sympathizers and Confederate [[Confederate States Army#Desertion|deserters]] and [[Confederate States of America#Conscription|conscription-evaders]] and to raid into the interior and interfere with Confederate efforts to round up cattle for supply to the Confederate Army. After some probes along the [[Peace River|Peace]] and [[Myakka River|Myakka]] rivers, which had mixed results, operations were moved to the mainland.{{sfn|Dillon|1984|pp=317\u201319, 324\u201325}} Troops from the [[47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment]] and the 2nd Regiment of Florida Rangers (later reorganized as the [[2nd Florida Cavalry Regiment (Union)]]) left [[Key West]] for Fort Myers early in January 1864. The Union soldiers reached Fort Myers quickly enough to capture three Confederate sympathizers before they could act on orders to burn the fort to keep it out of Union hands. Beyond the principal reason for occupying the fort of providing support for Union sympathizers and local residents disaffected with Confederate taxation and conscription, the fort provided access to the large cattle herds in southern Florida, support for the blockade of the southwest Florida coast being conducted by the U.S. Navy, and a haven for any escaped slaves in the area.{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=133, 134, 136}}\n\nIn April 1864, after the troops from the 47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment had been transferred to Louisiana, Companies D and I of the [[2nd United States Colored Infantry Regiment]] were transferred from Key West to Fort Myers, and remained at the fort until it was abandoned.{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=133\u201334}} Company G of the regiment had also been sent to Fort Myers by early May. {{sfn|Buker|1993|p=139}} Solomon argues that [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] Brigadier General [[Daniel Phineas Woodbury]], commandant of the District of Key West and the Tortugas, intended that action to be an irritant to the Confederacy. The presence of the black soldiers, who made up the majority of troops used in raids into Confederate territory, played on Confederate fears of armed blacks. It was reported that Woodbury took pleasure in placing a \"prickly pear cactus under the Confederate saddle\".{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=133\u201334, 143}}\n\nBy the spring of 1864, Fort Myers was protected by a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Breastwork (fortification)|breastwork]], {{convert|7|ft}} high and {{convert|15|ft}} wide, extending in an arc around the land side of the fort. The Seminole War-era blockhouse had been repaired and another two-story blockhouse built. The fort was soon harboring more than 400 civilians and Confederate army deserters. Many of the white men enlisted in the [[2nd Florida Cavalry Regiment (Union)|2nd Florida Union Cavalry]]. Although designated as cavalry, the members of the regiment stationed at Fort Myers were never mounted. Escaped slaves that came to the fort were recruited into the [[2nd United States Colored Infantry Regiment]].{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=136\u201337, 160}}\n\nThe Union achieved control of the full length of the Mississippi River after the [[Siege of Vicksburg|fall of Vicksburg]] in July 1863. The Confederate Army then became dependent on Florida for most of its supply of beef. By the end of 1863 between 1,000 and 2,000 head of cattle were being shipped to the Confederate Army from Florida every week.{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=140\u2013141}} As 1864 progressed, Union troops and sympathizers began driving cattle to Punta Rassa to supply Union ships on blockade duty and Union-held Key West, reducing the supply of cattle available to Confederate forces. The increased shipping from Punta Rassa led the Union Army to built a barracks and a wharf there.{{sfn|Dillon|1984|p=329}} By one Confederate estimate, the Union shipped 4,500 head of cattle from Punta Rassa.{{sfn|Buker|1993|p=160}}\n\nThe '''[[Battle of Fort Myers]]''' was fought on February 20, 1865, in [[Lee County, Florida]] during the last months of the American Civil War.

He traded tobacco, beads, and gunpowder, and sold otter, bobcat, and gator hide to the neighboring Seminole.<ref name=\"fortmyers-online.com\"/> A small community began to form around the trading post.\n\nIn the late 19th century, northerners began to travel to Florida in the winter. Some saw development opportunities. In 1881, the wealthy industrialist [[Hamilton Disston]] of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] came to the Caloosahatchee Valley. He planned to dredge and drain the [[Everglades]] for development. Diston connected [[Lake Okeechobee]] with the Caloosahatchee River; this allowed steamboats to run from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Okeechobee and up the [[Kissimmee River]].<ref name=\"fortmyers-online.com\"/>\n\nOn August 12, 1885, the small town of Fort Myers&mdash;all 349 residents&mdash;was incorporated. At that time, it was the second-largest town on Florida's Gulf Coast south of [[Cedar Key, Florida|Cedar Key]].<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=https://fortmyers.org/live-in-fort-myers/history-of-fort-myers/|title=The History of Fort Myers - Greater Fort Myers Chamber of Commerce|website=Fortmyers.org|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1885, inventor [[Thomas Alva Edison]] was cruising Florida's west coast and stopped to visit Fort Myers.<ref name=\"history\"/> He soon bought 13 acres along the Caloosahatchee River in town. There he built his home \"Seminole Lodge\", as a winter retreat. It included a laboratory for his continuing work. After the lodge was completed in 1886, Edison and his wife, Mina, spent many winters in Fort Myers. Edison also enjoyed local recreational fishing, for which Fort Myers had gained a national reputation.<ref name=\"myriver\">{{cite web|url=http://www.myriverdistrict.com/p/about/212|title=History of Ft Myers|website=Myriverdistrict.com|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1898, the Royal Palm Hotel was constructed.

This route provided Lee County both passenger and freight railroad service.<ref>Turner, Gregg M. ''A Journey Into Florida Railroad History''. University Press of Florida, p. 156. {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3233-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1908, the Arcade Theater was constructed in downtown Fort Myers. Originally a vaudeville house, Edison viewed films here for the first time with friends [[Henry Ford]] and [[Harvey Firestone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/10390|title=Arcade Theater in Fort Myers, FL - Cinema Treasures|website=cinematreasures.org|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref> With the growth of the film industry, the Arcade Theatre was converted into a full movie house. A wall divided the stage in order to form two screening rooms. Changes in moviegoing habits since the late 20th century have led to the renovation of the theater for use again in live performance. It is now host to the Florida Repertory Theatre, a performing arts hall.\n\nDuring World War I, Edison became concerned about America's reliance on foreign supplies of rubber. He partnered with tire producer Harvey Firestone, of the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]], and Henry Ford, of the [[Ford Motor Company]], to try to find a rubber tree or plant that could grow quickly in the United States. He sought one that would contain enough latex to support his research endeavor. In 1927, the three men contributed $25,000 each, and created the Edison Botanic Research Corporation in an attempt to find a solution to this problem.<ref name=\"history\"/> In 1928, the Edison Botanic Research Corporation laboratory was constructed. It was in Fort Myers that Edison conducted the majority of his research and planted exotic plants and trees. He sent results and sample rubber  residues to [[West Orange, New Jersey]], for further work at his large Thomas A. Edison \"Invention Factory\" (now preserved in the [[Thomas Edison National Historical Park]]). Through Edison's efforts, the [[Roystonea regia|royal palms]] lining Riverside Avenue (now McGregor Boulevard) were imported and planted. They inspired Fort Myers' nickname as \"City of Palms\".<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nAfter testing 17,000 plant samples, Edison eventually discovered a source in the plant [[Goldenrod]] (Solidago leavenworthii). The rubber project was transferred to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] five years later.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n[[Image:Fordwinterhome2006.jpg|thumb|right|The Mangoes: Henry Ford's winter home]]\nIn 1916, automobile magnate Ford purchased the home next to Edison's from Robert Smith of New York. Ford named his estate \"the Mangoes\". Ford's craftsman-style \"bungalow\" was built in 1911 by Smith. Ford, Firestone, and Edison were leaders in American industry and part of an exclusive group titled \"the Millionaires' Club\". The three men have been memorialized in statues in downtown Fort Myers' Centennial Park.\n\nIn 1924, with the beginning of construction of the [[Edison Bridge (Florida)|Edison Bridge]], named for Edison, the city's population steadily grew. The bridge was opened on February 11, 1931, the 84th birthday of its namesake. Edison dedicated the bridge, and was the first to drive across it.\n\n[[File:Fort Myers FL Downtown HD Kress bldg01.jpg|thumb|Architecture of Downtown Fort Myers]]\nIn the decade following the bridge's construction, the city had a real estate boom. Several new residential subdivisions were built beyond downtown, including Dean Park, Edison Park, and Seminole Park.<ref name=\"myriver\"/> Edison Park, located across McGregor Boulevard from the Edison and Ford properties, includes a number of Fort Myers' most stately homes. The historic development showcases a variety of architectural styles. In the 21st century, it is known for its community activities and strong neighborhood ties.<ref>[http://www.fortmyers-online.com/mcgregor-history.htm McGregor history], Fort Myers Online</ref>\n\nIn 1947, Mina Edison deeded Seminole Lodge to the city of Fort Myers, in memory of her late husband and for the enjoyment of the public. By 1988, the adjacent Henry Ford winter estate was purchased by the city and opened for public tours in 1990. The combined properties today are known as the [[Edison and Ford Winter Estates]].\n\n==Geography and climate==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|40.4|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|31.8|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|8.6|sqmi}} (21.25%) is water.\n\nFort Myers is on the border between a [[tropical savanna climate]] and a [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Randolph J.

It was intended as a place from which to recruit Union sympathizers and Confederate [[Confederate States Army#Desertion|deserters]] and [[Confederate States of America#Conscription|conscription-evaders]] and to raid into the interior and interfere with Confederate efforts to round up cattle for supply to the Confederate Army. After some probes along the [[Peace River|Peace]] and [[Myakka River|Myakka]] rivers, which had mixed results, operations were moved to the mainland.{{sfn|Dillon|1984|pp=317\u201319, 324\u201325}} Troops from the [[47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment]] and the 2nd Regiment of Florida Rangers (later reorganized as the [[2nd Florida Cavalry Regiment (Union)]]) left [[Key West]] for Fort Myers early in January 1864. The Union soldiers reached Fort Myers quickly enough to capture three Confederate sympathizers before they could act on orders to burn the fort to keep it out of Union hands. Beyond the principal reason for occupying the fort of providing support for Union sympathizers and local residents disaffected with Confederate taxation and conscription, the fort provided access to the large cattle herds in southern Florida, support for the blockade of the southwest Florida coast being conducted by the U.S. Navy, and a haven for any escaped slaves in the area.{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=133, 134, 136}}\n\nIn April 1864, after the troops from the 47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment had been transferred to Louisiana, Companies D and I of the [[2nd United States Colored Infantry Regiment]] were transferred from Key West to Fort Myers, and remained at the fort until it was abandoned.{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=133\u201334}} Company G of the regiment had also been sent to Fort Myers by early May. {{sfn|Buker|1993|p=139}} Solomon argues that [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] Brigadier General [[Daniel Phineas Woodbury]], commandant of the District of Key West and the Tortugas, intended that action to be an irritant to the Confederacy. The presence of the black soldiers, who made up the majority of troops used in raids into Confederate territory, played on Confederate fears of armed blacks. It was reported that Woodbury took pleasure in placing a \"prickly pear cactus under the Confederate saddle\".{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=133\u201334, 143}}\n\nBy the spring of 1864, Fort Myers was protected by a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Breastwork (fortification)|breastwork]], {{convert|7|ft}} high and {{convert|15|ft}} wide, extending in an arc around the land side of the fort. The Seminole War-era blockhouse had been repaired and another two-story blockhouse built. The fort was soon harboring more than 400 civilians and Confederate army deserters. Many of the white men enlisted in the [[2nd Florida Cavalry Regiment (Union)|2nd Florida Union Cavalry]]. Although designated as cavalry, the members of the regiment stationed at Fort Myers were never mounted. Escaped slaves that came to the fort were recruited into the [[2nd United States Colored Infantry Regiment]].{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=136\u201337, 160}}\n\nThe Union achieved control of the full length of the Mississippi River after the [[Siege of Vicksburg|fall of Vicksburg]] in July 1863. The Confederate Army then became dependent on Florida for most of its supply of beef. By the end of 1863 between 1,000 and 2,000 head of cattle were being shipped to the Confederate Army from Florida every week.{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=140\u2013141}} As 1864 progressed, Union troops and sympathizers began driving cattle to Punta Rassa to supply Union ships on blockade duty and Union-held Key West, reducing the supply of cattle available to Confederate forces. The increased shipping from Punta Rassa led the Union Army to built a barracks and a wharf there.{{sfn|Dillon|1984|p=329}} By one Confederate estimate, the Union shipped 4,500 head of cattle from Punta Rassa.{{sfn|Buker|1993|p=160}}\n\nThe '''[[Battle of Fort Myers]]''' was fought on February 20, 1865, in [[Lee County, Florida]] during the last months of the American Civil War.

He traded tobacco, beads, and gunpowder, and sold otter, bobcat, and gator hide to the neighboring Seminole.<ref name=\"fortmyers-online.com\"/> A small community began to form around the trading post.\n\nIn the late 19th century, northerners began to travel to Florida in the winter. Some saw development opportunities. In 1881, the wealthy industrialist [[Hamilton Disston]] of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] came to the Caloosahatchee Valley. He planned to dredge and drain the [[Everglades]] for development. Diston connected [[Lake Okeechobee]] with the Caloosahatchee River; this allowed steamboats to run from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Okeechobee and up the [[Kissimmee River]].<ref name=\"fortmyers-online.com\"/>\n\nOn August 12, 1885, the small town of Fort Myers&mdash;all 349 residents&mdash;was incorporated. At that time, it was the second-largest town on Florida's Gulf Coast south of [[Cedar Key, Florida|Cedar Key]].<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=https://fortmyers.org/live-in-fort-myers/history-of-fort-myers/|title=The History of Fort Myers - Greater Fort Myers Chamber of Commerce|website=Fortmyers.org|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1885, inventor [[Thomas Alva Edison]] was cruising Florida's west coast and stopped to visit Fort Myers.<ref name=\"history\"/> He soon bought 13 acres along the Caloosahatchee River in town. There he built his home \"Seminole Lodge\", as a winter retreat. It included a laboratory for his continuing work. After the lodge was completed in 1886, Edison and his wife, Mina, spent many winters in Fort Myers. Edison also enjoyed local recreational fishing, for which Fort Myers had gained a national reputation.<ref name=\"myriver\">{{cite web|url=http://www.myriverdistrict.com/p/about/212|title=History of Ft Myers|website=Myriverdistrict.com|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1898, the Royal Palm Hotel was constructed.

This route provided Lee County both passenger and freight railroad service.<ref>Turner, Gregg M. ''A Journey Into Florida Railroad History''. University Press of Florida, p. 156. {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3233-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1908, the Arcade Theater was constructed in downtown Fort Myers. Originally a vaudeville house, Edison viewed films here for the first time with friends [[Henry Ford]] and [[Harvey Firestone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/10390|title=Arcade Theater in Fort Myers, FL - Cinema Treasures|website=cinematreasures.org|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref> With the growth of the film industry, the Arcade Theatre was converted into a full movie house. A wall divided the stage in order to form two screening rooms. Changes in moviegoing habits since the late 20th century have led to the renovation of the theater for use again in live performance. It is now host to the Florida Repertory Theatre, a performing arts hall.\n\nDuring World War I, Edison became concerned about America's reliance on foreign supplies of rubber. He partnered with tire producer Harvey Firestone, of the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]], and Henry Ford, of the [[Ford Motor Company]], to try to find a rubber tree or plant that could grow quickly in the United States. He sought one that would contain enough latex to support his research endeavor. In 1927, the three men contributed $25,000 each, and created the Edison Botanic Research Corporation in an attempt to find a solution to this problem.<ref name=\"history\"/> In 1928, the Edison Botanic Research Corporation laboratory was constructed. It was in Fort Myers that Edison conducted the majority of his research and planted exotic plants and trees. He sent results and sample rubber  residues to [[West Orange, New Jersey]], for further work at his large Thomas A. Edison \"Invention Factory\" (now preserved in the [[Thomas Edison National Historical Park]]). Through Edison's efforts, the [[Roystonea regia|royal palms]] lining Riverside Avenue (now McGregor Boulevard) were imported and planted. They inspired Fort Myers' nickname as \"City of Palms\".<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nAfter testing 17,000 plant samples, Edison eventually discovered a source in the plant [[Goldenrod]] (Solidago leavenworthii). The rubber project was transferred to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] five years later.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n[[Image:Fordwinterhome2006.jpg|thumb|right|The Mangoes: Henry Ford's winter home]]\nIn 1916, automobile magnate Ford purchased the home next to Edison's from Robert Smith of New York. Ford named his estate \"the Mangoes\". Ford's craftsman-style \"bungalow\" was built in 1911 by Smith. Ford, Firestone, and Edison were leaders in American industry and part of an exclusive group titled \"the Millionaires' Club\". The three men have been memorialized in statues in downtown Fort Myers' Centennial Park.\n\nIn 1924, with the beginning of construction of the [[Edison Bridge (Florida)|Edison Bridge]], named for Edison, the city's population steadily grew. The bridge was opened on February 11, 1931, the 84th birthday of its namesake. Edison dedicated the bridge, and was the first to drive across it.\n\n[[File:Fort Myers FL Downtown HD Kress bldg01.jpg|thumb|Architecture of Downtown Fort Myers]]\nIn the decade following the bridge's construction, the city had a real estate boom. Several new residential subdivisions were built beyond downtown, including Dean Park, Edison Park, and Seminole Park.<ref name=\"myriver\"/> Edison Park, located across McGregor Boulevard from the Edison and Ford properties, includes a number of Fort Myers' most stately homes. The historic development showcases a variety of architectural styles. In the 21st century, it is known for its community activities and strong neighborhood ties.<ref>[http://www.fortmyers-online.com/mcgregor-history.htm McGregor history], Fort Myers Online</ref>\n\nIn 1947, Mina Edison deeded Seminole Lodge to the city of Fort Myers, in memory of her late husband and for the enjoyment of the public. By 1988, the adjacent Henry Ford winter estate was purchased by the city and opened for public tours in 1990. The combined properties today are known as the [[Edison and Ford Winter Estates]].\n\n==Geography and climate==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|40.4|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|31.8|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|8.6|sqmi}} (21.25%) is water.\n\nFort Myers is on the border between a [[tropical savanna climate]] and a [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Randolph J.

Psychology includes the study of [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] phenomena, as well as [[feeling]] and [[thought]]. It is an academic discipline of immense scope. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, and all the variety of phenomena linked to those emergent properties, joining this way the broader [[Neuroscience|neuroscientific]] group of researchers. As a social science it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases.<ref name=\"Fernald\">Fernald LD (2008).

Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and [[social behavior]], while also exploring the [[Physiology|physiological]] and [[neurobiology|biological]] processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.\n\n<!--Subjects and methods:-->\nPsychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[attention]], [[emotion]], [[intelligence]], [[phenomenology (psychology)|subjective experiences]], [[motivation]], [[Human brain#Functions|brain functioning]], and [[personality psychology|personality]].

Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind.<ref name =\"reference_name_A\">Although [[psychoanalysis]] and other forms of [[depth psychology]] are most typically associated with the unconscious mind, [[behaviorist]]s consider such phenomena as [[classical conditioning]] and [[operant conditioning]], while [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists]] explore [[implicit memory]], [[automaticity]], and [[subliminal message]]s, all of which are understood either to bypass or to occur outside of conscious effort or attention. Indeed, [[cognitive-behavioral therapist]]s counsel their clients to become aware of maladaptive thought patterns, the nature of which the clients previously had not been conscious.</ref> Psychologists employ [[empirical method]]s to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables.

This definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades. However, this meaning was contested, notably by radical behaviorists such as [[John B.

Also since James defined it, the term more strongly connotes techniques of [[scientific experimentation]].<ref>[[Derek Russell Davis]] (DRD), \"psychology\", in Richard L.

Westport, Connecticut: Praeger.</ref> As early as the 4th century BC, Greek physician [[Hippocrates]] theorized that [[mental disorder]]s had physical rather than supernatural causes.<ref>T.L. Brink.

This body of knowledge involves insights drawn from introspection and observation, as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting. It frames the universe as a division of, and interaction between, physical reality and mental reality, with an emphasis on purifying the mind in order to increase virtue and power. An ancient text known as ''[[Huangdi Neijing|The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine]]'' identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom and sensation, includes theories of personality based on [[Yin and yang|yin\u2013yang]] balance, and analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria. Chinese scholarship focused on the brain advanced in the [[Qing Dynasty]] with the work of Western-educated Fang Yizhi (1611\u20131671), [[Liu Zhi (scholar)|Liu Zhi]] (1660\u20131730), and Wang Qingren (1768\u20131831). Wang Qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system, linked mental disorder with brain diseases, investigated the causes of dreams and [[insomnia]], and advanced a theory of [[Lateralization of brain function|hemispheric lateralization]] in brain function.<ref name=HsuehGuo>Yeh Hsueh and Benyu Guo, \"China\", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref>\n\nDistinctions in types of awareness appear in the ancient thought of India, influenced by [[Hinduism]]. A central idea of the [[Upanishads]] is the distinction between a person's transient mundane self and their [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|eternal unchanging soul]]. Divergent Hindu doctrines, and Buddhism, have challenged this hierarchy of selves, but have all emphasized the importance of reaching higher awareness. [[Yoga]] is a range of techniques used in pursuit of this goal. Much of the [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit corpus]] was suppressed under the [[British East India Company]] followed by the [[British Raj]] in the 1800s. However, Indian doctrines influenced Western thinking via the [[Theosophical Society]], a [[New Age]] group which became popular among Euro-American intellectuals.<ref name=Paranjpe>Anand C. Paranjpe, \"From Tradition through Colonialism to Globalization: Reflections on the History of Psychology in India\", in Brock (ed.), ''Internationalizing the History of Psychology'' (2006).</ref>\n\nPsychology was a popular topic in [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] Europe. In Germany, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646\u20131716) applied his principles of calculus to the mind, arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuum\u2014most notably, that among an infinity of human perceptions and desires, the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness is only a matter of degree. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] identified psychology as its own science, writing ''Psychologia empirica'' in 1732 and ''Psychologia rationalis'' in 1734. This notion advanced further under [[Immanuel Kant]], who established the idea of [[History of anthropology|anthropology]], with psychology as an important subdivision. However, Kant explicitly and notoriously rejected the idea of [[experimental psychology]], writing that \"the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry even as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine, for in it the manifold of inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought, and cannot then be held separate and recombined at will (but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit our purpose), and even observation by itself already changes and displaces the state of the observed object.\" In 1783, [[Ferdinand Ueberwasser]] (1752-1812) designated himself ''Professor of Empirical Psychology and Logic'' and gave lectures on scientific psychology, though these developments were soon overshadowed by the [[Napoleonic Wars]], after which the Old University of M\u00fcnster was discontinued by Prussian authorities.<ref>Schwarz, K.

Theories of personality vary across different psychological schools and orientations. They carry different assumptions about such issues as the role of the unconscious and the importance of childhood experience. According to Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of the [[id, ego, and super-ego]].<ref>Carver, C., & Scheier, M. (2004). Perspectives on Personality (5th ed.).

Although the number of proposed traits has varied widely, an early biologically-based model proposed by Hans Eysenck, the 3rd mostly highly cited psychologist of the 20th Century (after Freud, and Piaget respectively), suggested that at least three major trait constructs are necessary to describe human personality structure: [[extraversion and introversion|extraversion\u2013introversion]], [[neuroticism]]-stability, and [[psychoticism]]-normality.

Cognitive psychologists have used a \"filter\" model of attention, according to which much information processing takes place below the threshold of consciousness, and only certain processes, limited by nature and by simultaneous quantity, make their way through the filter. Copious research has shown that subconscious ''[[priming (psychology)|priming]]'' of certain ideas can covertly influence thoughts and behavior.<ref name=Kihlstrom1999 /> A significant hurdle in this research is proving that a subject's conscious mind has not grasped a certain stimulus, due to the unreliability of self-reporting. For this reason, some psychologists prefer to distinguish between ''[[implicit memory|implicit]]'' and ''[[explicit memory|explicit]]'' memory. In another approach, one can also describe a [[subliminal stimulus]] as meeting an ''objective'' but not a ''subjective'' threshold.<ref name=BanksFarber>William P.

With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking, instinct also came to be seen as a primary source of motivation.<ref name=ForgasEtAl>Forgas, Williams, & Laham, \"Social Motivation: Introduction and Overview\", in Forgas, Williams, & Laham, ''Social Motivation'' (2005).</ref> According to [[drive theory]], the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence. Psychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as physical demands made by the organism on the nervous system. However, they believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche. Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the [[reality principle]], roughly corresponding to id and ego. Later, in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', Freud introduced the concept of the ''[[death drive]]'', a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and [[Repetition compulsion|psychic repetition of traumatic events]].<ref>Weiner, ''Human Motivation'' (2013), Chapter 2, \"The Psychoanalytic Theory of Motivation\" (pp. 9\u201384).</ref> Meanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking.<ref name=ForgasEtAl /><ref name=GodsilEtAl>Bill P.

Tory Higgins]], ''Beyond Pleasure and Pain: How Motivation Works''; Oxford University Press, 2012; {{ISBN|978-0-19-976582-9}}{{page needed|date=February 2019}}</ref><ref>Shah & Gardner, ''Handbook of Motivation Science'' (2008), entire volume.{{page needed|date=February 2019}}</ref>\n\nMotivation can be modulated or manipulated in many different ways. Researchers have found that [[eating]], for example, depends not only on the organism's fundamental need for [[homeostasis]]\u2014an important factor causing the experience of hunger\u2014but also on circadian rhythms, food availability, food palatability, and cost.<ref name=GodsilEtAl /> Abstract motivations are also malleable, as evidenced by such phenomena as ''goal contagion'': the adoption of goals, sometimes unconsciously, based on inferences about the goals of others.<ref>Hank Aarts, Ap Dijksterhuis, & Giel Dik, \"Goal Contagion: Inferring goals from others' actions\u2014and what it leads to\", in Shah & Gardner, ''Handbook of Motivation Science'' (2008). \"In short, then, the studies presented above indicate that humans are keen to act on the goals of other social beings that are implied in behavioral scenarios or scripts.\" Also see: {{cite journal | last1 = Aarts | last2 = Hassin | last3 = Gollwitzer | title = Goal Contagion: Perceiving is for Pursuing | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 87 | issue = 1| year = 2004 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.1.23 | pages=23\u201337 | pmid=15250790| citeseerx = 10.1.1.312.5507 }}</ref> Vohs and [[Roy Baumeister|Baumeister]] suggest that contrary to the need-desire-fulfilment cycle of animal instincts, human motivations sometimes obey a \"getting begets wanting\" rule: the more you get a reward such as self-esteem, love, drugs, or money, the more you want it.

This may focus on cognitive, affective, moral, social, or neural development. Researchers who study children use a number of unique research methods to make observations in natural settings or to engage them in experimental tasks. Such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically useful, and researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of infants. In addition to studying children, developmental psychologists also study aging and processes throughout the life span, especially at other times of rapid change (such as adolescence and old age). Developmental psychologists draw on the full range of psychological theories to inform their research.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n=== Genes and environment ===\n{{Main|Behavioral genetics}}\n\nAll researched psychological traits are influenced by both genes and environment, to varying degrees.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng.3285 |pmid=25985137 |title=Meta-analysis of the heritability of human traits based on fifty years of twin studies |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=702\u2013709 |year=2015 |last1=Polderman |first1=Tinca J C. |last2=Benyamin |first2=Beben |last3=De Leeuw |first3=Christiaan A. |last4=Sullivan |first4=Patrick F. |last5=Van Bochoven |first5=Arjen |last6=Visscher |first6=Peter M. |last7=Posthuma |first7=Danielle |url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:364460/UQ364460_OA.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00084 |title=Three Laws of Behavior Genetics and What They Mean |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=160\u2013164 |year=2000 |last1=Turkheimer |first1=Eric }}</ref> These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals or families. An example is the transmission of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] from a depressed mother to her offspring. Theory may hold that the offspring, by virtue of having a depressed mother in his or her (the offspring's) environment, is at risk for developing depression. However, risk for depression is also influenced to some extent by genes. The mother may both carry genes that contribute to her depression but will also have passed those genes on to her offspring thus increasing the offspring's risk for depression. Genes and environment in this simple transmission model are completely confounded. Experimental and quasi-experimental [[behavioral genetic]] research uses genetic methodologies to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior.<ref name=\"Behavior Genetics\" /> Traditionally this research has been conducted using [[twin studies]] and [[adoption study|adoption studies]], two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un-confounded. More recently, the availability of [[microarray]] [[molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] or [[genome sequencing]] technologies allows researchers to measure participant DNA variation directly, and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and [[psychopathology]] through methods including [[genome-wide association studies]]. One goal of such research is similar to that in [[positional cloning]] and its success in [[Huntington's]]: once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype.

Written exams began during the Han dynasty (202 BC \u2013 AD 200). By 1370, the Chinese system required a stratified series of tests, involving essay writing and knowledge of diverse topics. The system was ended in 1906.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 41\u201342.</ref> In Europe, mental assessment took a more physiological approach, with theories of [[physiognomy]]\u2014judgment of character based on the face\u2014described by Aristotle in 4th century BC Greece. Physiognomy remained current through the Enlightenment, and added the doctrine of phrenology: a study of mind and intelligence based on simple assessment of neuroanatomy.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 42\u201343.</ref>\n\nWhen experimental psychology came to Britain, Francis Galton was a leading practitioner, and, with his procedures for measuring reaction time and sensation, is considered an inventor of modern mental testing (also known as ''[[psychometrics]]'').<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 44\u201345.</ref> James McKeen Cattell, a student of Wundt and Galton, brought the concept to the United States, and in fact coined the term \"mental test\".<ref name=Gregory2011Pages45and46>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 45\u201346.</ref> In 1901, Cattell's student [[Clark Wissler]] published discouraging results, suggesting that mental testing of Columbia and Barnard students failed to predict their academic performance.<ref name=Gregory2011Pages45and46 /> In response to 1904 orders from the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Minister of Public Instruction]], French psychologists [[Alfred Binet]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Simon]] elaborated a new test of intelligence in 1905\u20131911, using a range of questions diverse in their nature and difficulty. Binet and Simon introduced the concept of [[mental age]] and referred to the lowest scorers on their test as ''[[idiot]]s''. [[Henry H. Goddard]] put the Binet-Simon scale to work and introduced classifications of mental level such as ''imbecile'' and ''feebleminded''. In 1916 (after Binet's death), Stanford professor [[Lewis M. Terman]] modified the Binet-Simon scale (renamed the [[Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales|Stanford\u2013Binet scale]]) and introduced the [[intelligence quotient]] as a score report.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), p. 50\u201356.</ref> From this test, Terman concluded that mental retardation \"represents the level of intelligence which is very, very common among Spanish-Indians and Mexican families of the Southwest and also among negroes. Their dullness seems to be racial.\"<ref name=Guthrie1998Chapter3>Guthrie, ''Even the Rat was White'' (1998), Chapter 3: \"Psychometric Scientism\" (pp. 55\u201387)</ref>\n\nFollowing the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests for soldiers in World War I, mental testing became popular in the US, where it was soon applied to school children. The federally created National Intelligence Test was administered to 7 million children in the 1920s, and in 1926 the [[College Entrance Examination Board]] created the [[Scholastic Aptitude Test]] to standardize college admissions.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), p. 61.</ref> The results of intelligence tests were used to argue for segregated schools and economic functions\u2014i.e. the preferential training of Black Americans for manual labor. These practices were criticized by black intellectuals such a [[Horace Mann Bond]] and [[Allison Davis]].<ref name=Guthrie1998Chapter3 /> Eugenicists used mental testing to justify and organize compulsory sterilization of individuals classified as mentally retarded.<ref name=GuthrieChapter4 /> In the United States, tens of thousands of men and women were sterilized. Setting a precedent which has never been overturned, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of this practice in the 1907 case ''[[Buck v.

[\u2026] Tests are used in almost every nation on earth for counseling, selection, and placement. Testing occurs in settings as diverse as schools, civil service, industry, medical clinics, and counseling centers. Most persons have taken dozens of tests and thought nothing of it. Yet, by the time the typical individual reaches retirement age, it is likely that psychological test results will have helped to shape his or her destiny.\"</ref> Modern testing aspires to criteria including standardization of procedure, [[reliability (psychometrics)|consistency of results]], output of an interpretable score, statistical norms describing population outcomes, and, ideally, [[test validity|effective prediction]] of behavior and life outcomes outside of testing situations.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 4\u20136.</ref>\n\n=== Mental health care ===\nThe provision of psychological health services is generally called ''clinical psychology'' in the U.S. The definitions of this term are various and may include school psychology and counseling psychology. Practitioners typically includes people who have graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychology but may also include others. In Canada, the above groups usually fall within the larger category of ''[[professional psychology]]''. In Canada and the US, practitioners get bachelor's degrees and doctorates, then spend one year in an internship and one year in postdoctoral education. In Mexico and most other Latin American and European countries, psychologists do not get bachelor's and doctorate degrees; instead, they take a three-year professional course following high school.<ref name=HallHurley /> Clinical psychology is at present the largest specialization within psychology.<ref name=StrickerWidiger /> It includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically based distress, dysfunction or [[mental illness]] and to promote subjective well-being and personal development. Central to its practice are psychological assessment and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.<ref name=\"brain\">Brain, Christine. (2002). ''Advanced psychology: applications, issues and perspectives.'' Cheltenham: Nelson Thornes. {{ISBN|0-17-490058-9}}</ref>\n\nCredit for the first psychology clinic in the United States typically goes to Lightner Witmer, who established his practice in Philadelphia in 1896. Another modern psychotherapist was [[Morton Prince]].<ref name=StrickerWidiger>George Stricker & Thomas A. Widiger, \"Volume Preface\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref> For the most part, in the first part of the twentieth century, most mental health care in the United States was performed by specialized medical doctors called psychiatrists. Psychology entered the field with its refinements of mental testing, which promised to improve diagnosis of mental problems. For their part, some psychiatrists became interested in using psychoanalysis and other forms of [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]] to understand and treat the mentally ill.<ref name=Tomes2008 /> In this type of treatment, a specially trained therapist develops a close relationship with the patient, who discusses wishes, dreams, social relationships, and other aspects of mental life. The therapist seeks to uncover repressed material and to understand why the patient creates defenses against certain thoughts and feelings. An important aspect of the therapeutic relationship is [[transference]], in which deep unconscious feelings in a patient reorient themselves and become manifest in relation to the therapist.<ref>[[Nancy McWilliams]] and Joel Weinberger, \"Psychodynamic Psychotherapy\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>\n\nPsychiatric psychotherapy blurred the distinction between psychiatry and psychology, and this trend continued with the rise of [[Community mental health service|community mental health facilities]] and [[behavioral therapy]], a thoroughly non-psychodynamic model which used behaviorist learning theory to change the actions of patients. A key aspect of behavior therapy is empirical evaluation of the treatment's effectiveness. In the 1970s, [[cognitive-behavior therapy]] arose, using similar methods and now including the cognitive constructs which had gained popularity in theoretical psychology. A key practice in behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy is exposing patients to things they fear, based on the premise that their responses (fear, panic, anxiety) can be deconditioned.<ref>W. Edward Craighead & Linda Wilcoxon Craighead, \"Behavioral and Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>\n\nMental health care today involves psychologists and [[social work]]ers in increasing numbers. In 1977, National Institute of Mental Health director [[Bertram Brown (physician)|Bertram Brown]] described this shift as a source of \"intense competition and role confusion\".<ref name=Tomes2008>Nancy Tomes, \"The Development of Clinical Psychology, Social Work, and Psychiatric Nursing: 1900\u20131980s\", in Wallace & Gach (eds.), ''History of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology'' (2008).</ref> Graduate programs issuing doctorates in psychology (PhD or PsyD) emerged in the 1950s and underwent rapid increase through the 1980s. This degree is intended to train practitioners who might conduct scientific research.<ref name=HallHurley />\n\nSome clinical psychologists may focus on the clinical management of patients with brain injury\u2014this area is known as clinical neuropsychology. In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession. The emerging field of ''disaster psychology'' (see [[crisis intervention]]) involves professionals who respond to large-scale traumatic events.<ref>Teri L. Elliott, \"Disaster Psychology: Keep Clients out of Your Office\u2014Get into the Field!\" in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005). \"...it is the disaster psychologist's role to utilize crisis intervention processes with the goal of preventing natural distress due to the critical event from developing into a more harmful, long-term psychological condition.\"</ref>\n\nThe work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client (usually an individual, couple, family, or small group). Typically, these approaches encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. Four major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, existential\u2013humanistic, and systems or family therapy. There has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture, gender, spirituality, and sexual orientation. With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is evidence that most of the major therapies have equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong [[therapeutic relationship|therapeutic alliance]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Leichsenring, Falk |author2=Leibing, Eric |year=2003 |title=The effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive behavior therapy in the treatment of personality disorders: A meta-analysis |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=7 |pages=1223\u20131233 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1223 |pmid=12832233}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Reisner, Andrew |year=2005 |title=The common factors, empirically validated treatments, and recovery models of therapeutic change |journal=The Psychological Record |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=377\u2013400|doi=10.1007/BF03395517 |url=https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1192&context=tpr }}</ref> Because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an [[Integrative Psychotherapy|eclectic therapeutic orientation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Jensen, J.P. |author2=Bergin, A.E. |author3=Greaves, D.W. |year=1990 |title=The meaning of eclecticism: New survey and analysis of components |journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=124\u2013130 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.21.2.124}}</ref><ref>Palmer, S.; Woolfe, R.

The work of child psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky, [[Jean Piaget]], and [[Jerome Bruner]] has been influential in creating teaching methods and educational practices. Educational psychology is often included in teacher education programs in places such as North America, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nSchool psychology combines principles from educational psychology and clinical psychology to understand and treat students with learning disabilities; to foster the intellectual growth of [[intellectual giftedness|gifted]] students; to facilitate [[prosocial behavior]]s in adolescents; and otherwise to promote safe, supportive, and effective learning environments. School psychologists are trained in educational and behavioral assessment, intervention, prevention, and consultation, and many have extensive training in research.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Association of School Psychologists |title=Who are school psychologists? |url=http://nasponline.org/about_sp/whatis.aspx |accessdate=1 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517055058/http://nasponline.org/about_sp/whatis.aspx |archivedate=17 May 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Work ===\n{{see also|Industrial and organizational psychology|Organizational behavior}}\nIndustrialists soon brought the nascent field of psychology to bear on the study of [[scientific management]] techniques for improving workplace efficiency.

Koppes, \"Industrial-Organizational Psychology\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 1: ''History of Psychology''.</ref> An important early study examined workers at Western Electric's Hawthorne plant in Cicero, Illinois from 1924\u20131932. With funding from the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Fund and guidance from Australian psychologist [[Elton Mayo]], Western Electric experimented on thousands of factory workers to assess their responses to illumination, breaks, food, and wages. The researchers came to focus on workers' responses to observation itself, and the term [[Hawthorne effect]] is now used to describe the fact that people work harder when they think they're being watched.<ref>Yeh Hsueh, \"The Hawthorne experiments and the introduction of Jean Piaget in American industrial psychology, 1929\u20131932\"; ''History of Psychology'' 5.2, May 2002.</ref>\n\nThe name industrial and organizational psychology (I\u2013O) arose in the 1960s and became enshrined as the [[Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology]], Division 14 of the American Psychological Association, in 1973.<ref name=Koppes /> The goal is to optimize human potential in the workplace. Personnel psychology, a subfield of I\u2013O psychology, applies the methods and principles of psychology in selecting and evaluating workers.

Psychological warfare chiefly involves the use of propaganda to influence enemy soldiers and civilians. In the case of so-called black propaganda the propaganda is designed to seem like it originates from a different source.<ref>[[Cordwainer Smith|Paul M.A. Linebarger]], ''Psychological Warfare''; Washington: Combat Forces Press, 1954.</ref> The [[CIA]]'s [[MKULTRA]] program involved more individualized efforts at [[mind control]], involving techniques such as hypnosis, torture, and covert involuntary administration of [[LSD]].<ref>See \"[https://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/13inmate_ProjectMKULTRA.pdf Project MKULTRA, the CIA's Program of Research in Behavioral Modification]\"; Joint Hearing before the Senate Committee on Intelligence and the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the Committee on Human Resources, United States Senate, Ninety Fifth Congress, First Session, 3 August 1997; and [[John D.

A prominent aspect of health psychology is the psychoeducation of patients: instructing them in how to follow a medical regimen. Health psychologists can also educate doctors and conduct research on patient compliance.<ref>Marilu Price Berry, \"Interdisciplinary Medical Setting: The Multiple Roles of a Health Psychologist\" in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005).</ref>\n\nPsychologists in the field of public health use a wide variety of interventions to influence human behavior. These range from public relations campaigns and outreach to governmental laws and policies. Psychologists study the composite influence of all these different tools in an effort to influence whole [[population]]s of people.<ref>Monica L. Baskin, \"Public Health: Career Opportunities for Psychologists in Public Health\", in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005). \"Prevention strategies of late have largely concentrated on community-based interventions, which have been shown to be effective in changing the health of large populations. Behavioral and social scientists, such as psychologists, are helpful in this arena as we are trained to view individuals as belonging to complex and dynamic social systems, including immediate and extended family systems, acquaintance and friendship networks, neighborhood and community systems, and cultural groups (Schneiderman & Spee4, 2001).\"</ref>\n\nBlack American psychologists [[Kenneth and Mamie Clark]] studied the psychological impact of segregation and testified with their findings in the desegregation case ''[[Brown v.

In 2010, ''Clinical Psychological Review'' published a special issue devoted to positive psychological interventions, such as [[gratitude journal]]ing and the physical expression of gratitude. Positive psychological interventions have been limited in scope, but their effects are thought to be superior to that of [[placebo]]s, especially with regard to helping people with body image problems.\n\n== Research methods ==\n{{Main|Psychological research|List of psychological research methods}}\n\n[[Quantitative psychological research]] lends itself to the statistical testing of hypotheses. Although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such research can only assess a limited range of short-term phenomena.

In an experiment, the researcher alters parameters of influence, called [[independent variable]]s, and measures resulting changes of interest, called [[dependent variable]]s. Prototypical experimental research is conducted in a laboratory with a carefully controlled environment.\n\n[[Repeated-measures experiment]]s are those which take place through intervention on multiple occasions. In research on the effectiveness of psychotherapy, experimenters often compare a given treatment with placebo treatments, or compare different treatments against each other. Treatment type is the independent variable. The dependent variables are outcomes, ideally assessed in several ways by different professionals.<ref>Evelyn S. Behar & Thomas D. Borkovec, \"Psychotherapy Outcome Research\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> Using [[crossover study|crossover design]], researchers can further increase the strength of their results by testing both of two treatments on two groups of subjects.\n\n[[Quasi-experimental design]] refers especially to situations precluding random assignment to different conditions. Researchers can use common sense to consider how much the nonrandom assignment threatens the study's [[Validity (logic)|validity]].<ref>Melvin M. Mark, \"Program Evaluation\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> For example, in research on the best way to affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school, school administrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms, in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments. Psychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes.\n\nExperimental researchers typically use a [[statistical hypothesis testing]] model which involves making predictions before conducting the experiment, then assessing how well the data supports the predictions. (These predictions may originate from a more abstract scientific [[hypothesis]] about how the phenomenon under study actually works.) Analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical techniques are used to distinguish unique results of the experiment from the [[null hypothesis]] that variations result from random fluctuations in data. In psychology, the widely used standard ascribes [[statistical significance]] to results which have less than 5% [[p-value|probability of being explained by random variation]].<ref>[[Roger E. Kirk]], \"Experimental Design\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>\n\n=== Other forms of statistical inference ===\n[[Statistical survey]]s are used in psychology for measuring attitudes and traits, monitoring changes in mood, checking the validity of experimental manipulations, and for other psychological topics. Most commonly, psychologists use paper-and-pencil surveys. However, surveys are also conducted over the phone or through e-mail. Web-based surveys are increasingly used to conveniently reach many subjects.\n\n[[Neuropsychological tests]], such as the [[David Wechsler|Wechsler scales]] and [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test]], are mostly questionnaires or simple tasks used which assess a specific type of mental function in the respondent. These can be used in experiments, as in the case of [[lesion]] experiments evaluating the results of damage to a specific part of the brain.<ref>Russell M. Bauer, Elizabeth C. Leritz, & Dawn Bowers, \"Neuropsychology\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>\n\n[[Observational studies]] analyze uncontrolled data in search of correlations; [[multivariate statistics]] are typically used to interpret the more complex situation. [[Cross-sectional studies|Cross-sectional]] observational studies use data from a single point in time, whereas [[longitudinal studies|longitudinal]] studies are used to study trends across the life span. Longitudinal studies track the same people, and therefore detect more individual, rather than cultural, differences. However, they suffer from lack of controls and from confounding factors such as ''selective attrition'' (the bias introduced when a certain type of subject disproportionately leaves a study).\n\n[[Exploratory data analysis]] refers to a variety of practices which researchers can use to visualize and analyze existing sets of data. In [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Modes of inference|Peirce's three modes of inference]], exploratory data analysis corresponds to [[abduction (logic)|abduction]], or hypothesis formation.<ref>John T. Behrens and Chong-Ho Yu, \"Exploratory Data Analysis\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> [[Meta-analysis]] is the technique of integrating the results from multiple studies and interpreting the statistical properties of the pooled dataset.<ref>Frank L. Schmidt and John E. Hunter, \"Meta-Analysis\", ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>\n\n=== Technological assays ===\n[[File:EEG cap.jpg|alt=|thumb|An EEG recording setup]]\nA classic and popular tool used to relate mental and neural activity is the [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG), a technique using amplified electrodes on a person's scalp to measure voltage changes in different parts of the brain. [[Hans Berger]], the first researcher to use EEG on an unopened skull, quickly found that brains exhibit signature \"brain waves\": electric oscillations which correspond to different states of consciousness. Researchers subsequently refined statistical methods for synthesizing the electrode data, and identified unique brain wave patterns such as the [[delta wave]] observed during non-REM sleep.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = R\u00f6sler | first1 = Frank | title = From Single-Channel Recordings to Brain-Mapping Devices: The Impact of Electroencephalography on Experimental Psychology | url = http://cognitrn.psych.indiana.edu/busey/eegseminar/pdfs/EEGHistoryImpact.pdf | journal = History of Psychology | volume = 8 | issue = 1| year = 2005 | doi=10.1037/1093-4510.8.1.95 | pmid = 16021767 | pages=95\u2013117}}</ref>\n\nNewer [[functional neuroimaging]] techniques include [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[positron emission tomography]], both of which track the flow of blood through the brain. These technologies provide more localized information about activity in the brain and create representations of the brain with widespread appeal. They also provide insight which avoids the classic problems of subjective self-reporting. It remains challenging to draw hard conclusions about where in the brain specific thoughts originate\u2014or even how usefully such localization corresponds with reality. However, neuroimaging has delivered unmistakable results showing the existence of correlations between mind and brain. Some of these draw on a systemic [[neural network]] model rather than a localized function model.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moran | first1 = Joseph M. | last2 = Zaki | first2 = Jamil | title = Functional Neuroimaging and Psychology: What Have You Done for Me Lately? | url = http://ssnl.stanford.edu/download/file/fid/518| journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 25 | issue = 6| year = 2013 | doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00380 | pages=834\u2013842 | pmid=23469884}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cacioppo | first1 = John T. | last2 = Berntson | first2 = Gary G. | last3 = Nusbaum | first3 = Howard C. | title = Neuroimaging as a New Tool in the Toolbox of Psychological Science | url = http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbn08.pdf | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00550.x | pages = 62\u201367 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141031185051/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbn08.pdf | archivedate = 31 October 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aue | first1 = Tatjana | last2 = Lavelle | first2 = Leah A. | last3 = Cacioppo | first3 = John T. | title = Great expectations: What can fMRI research tell us about psychological phenomena? | url = http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/alc09.pdf | journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.12.017 | pages = 10\u201316 | pmid = 19232374 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160109084331/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/alc09.pdf | archivedate = 9 January 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nPsychiatric interventions such as [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] and drugs also provide information about brain\u2013mind interactions. [[Psychopharmacology]] is the study of drug-induced mental effects.\n\n[[File:Multi-Layer Neural Network-Vector.svg|thumb|[[Artificial neural network]] with two layers, an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain.]]\n\n=== Computer simulation ===\n{{See also|Computational cognition}}\nComputational modeling is a tool used in [[mathematical psychology]] and cognitive psychology to simulate behavior.<ref>Ron Sun, (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. Cambridge University Press, New York. 2008.</ref> This method has several advantages. Since modern computers process information quickly, simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for high statistical power. Modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that couldn't be directly observed in a human. Computational neuroscience uses mathematical models to simulate the brain. Another method is symbolic modeling, which represents many mental objects using variables and rules. Other types of modeling include [[dynamic systems]] and [[stochastic process|stochastic]] modeling.\n\n=== Animal studies ===\n[[File:MorrisWaterMaze.jpg|right|thumb|A rat undergoing a [[Morris water navigation test]] used in [[behavioral neuroscience]] to study the role of the [[hippocampus]] in [[spatial learning]] and memory.]]\n\nAnimal experiments aid in investigating many aspects of human psychology, including perception, emotion, learning, memory, and thought, to name a few. In the 1890s, Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioning. Non-human primates, cats, dogs, pigeons, rats, and other rodents are often used in psychological experiments. Ideally, controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable at a time, in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables. These conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings. In contrast, human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely, and depend upon so many factors, that it is difficult to control important variables for human subjects. There are pitfalls in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ncabr.org/biomed/FAQ_animal/faq_animal_8.html |title= Ncabr.Org: About Biomedical Research: Faq |accessdate= 1 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080708190108/http://www.ncabr.org/biomed/FAQ_animal/faq_animal_8.html |archivedate= 8 July 2008 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nComparative psychology refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. Research in this area explores the behavior of many species, from insects to primates. It is closely related to other disciplines that study animal behavior such as [[ethology]].<ref>Shettleworth, S.J. (2010) Cognition, Evolution and Behavior (2nd Ed), New York: Oxford.</ref> Research in comparative psychology sometimes appears to shed light on human behavior, but some attempts to connect the two have been quite controversial, for example the [[Sociobiology]] of [[E.O. Wilson]].<ref>Wilson, E.O. (1978) ''On Human Nature'' p. x, Cambridge, Ma: Harvard</ref> Animal models are often used to study neural processes related to human behavior, e.g. in cognitive neuroscience.\n\n=== Qualitative and descriptive research ===\nResearch designed to answer questions about the current state of affairs such as the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals is known as ''descriptive research''. Descriptive research can be qualitative or quantitative in orientation. ''Qualitative research'' is descriptive research that is focused on observing and describing events as they occur, with the goal of capturing all of the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations have been made.\n\n[[Qualitative psychological research]] methods include interviews, first-hand observation, and participant observation. Creswell (2003) identifies five main possibilities for qualitative research, including narrative, phenomenology, [[ethnography]], [[case study]], and [[grounded theory]]. Qualitative researchers<ref>Glaser, B. & Strauss, A. (1967). ''The discovery of grounded theory: Strategies for qualitative research''. Chicago: Aldine.</ref> sometimes aim to enrich interpretations or [[critical theory|critiques]] of symbols, subjective experiences, or social structures. Sometimes hermeneutic and critical aims can give rise to quantitative research, as in Erich Fromm's study of [[Authoritarian personality|Nazi voting]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}<!--(suggesting the authoritarian personality thesis)--> or [[Stanley Milgram]]'s [[Milgram experiment|studies]] of [[obedience to authority]].\n\n[[File:Phineas gage - 1868 skull diagram.jpg|right|thumb|[[Phineas P. Gage]] survived an accident in which a large iron rod was driven completely through his head, destroying much of his brain's left frontal lobe, and is remembered for that injury's reported effects on his personality and behavior.<ref>[[Phineas Gage#References|Harlow (1868)]], Fig. 2, p. 347 Harlow, John Martyn (1868). \"Recovery from the Passage of an Iron Bar through the Head.\" Publications of the Massachusetts Medical Society 2:327\u2013347 (Republished in Macmillan 2000).</ref>]]\n\nJust as [[Jane Goodall]] studied chimpanzee social and family life by careful observation of chimpanzee behavior in the field, psychologists conduct [[naturalistic observation]] of ongoing human social, professional, and family life. Sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed, and other times the participants do not know they are being observed. Strict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation is being carried out.\n\n===Program Evaluation===\n[[Program Evaluation]] is a systematic method for collecting, analyzing, and using information to answer questions about projects, policies and programs,<ref>Administration for Children and Families (2010) ''[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/other_resrch/pm_guide_eval/index.html The Program Manager's Guide to Evaluation]. Chapter 2: What is program evaluation?''.</ref> particularly about their effectiveness and efficiency. In both the public and private sectors, stakeholders often want to know whether the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving or objecting to are producing the intended effect. While program evaluation first focuses around this definition, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, if there are unintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shackman|first=Gene|title=What Is Program Evaluation: A Beginner's Guide|publisher=The Global Social Change Research Project|ssrn=3060080|date=11 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Criticism}}Contemporary issues in methodology and practice ==\n=== Metascience ===\nThe field of [[metascience]] has revealed significant problems with the methodology of psychological research.

Some famous past studies are today considered unethical and in violation of [[Guidelines for human subject research#APA Ethics Code|established codes]] the Canadian Code of Conduct for Research Involving Humans, and the [[Belmont Report]]).\n\nThe most important contemporary standards are informed and voluntary consent. After World War II, the [[Nuremberg Code]] was established because of Nazi abuses of experimental subjects. Later, most countries (and scientific journals) adopted the [[Declaration of Helsinki]]. In the U.S., the [[National Institutes of Health]] established the [[Institutional Review Board]] in 1966, and in 1974 adopted the [[National Research Act]] (HR 7724). All of these measures encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studies. A number of influential studies led to the establishment of this rule; such studies included the [[MIT]] and Fernald School radioisotope studies, the [[Thalidomide scandal|Thalidomide tragedy]], the Willowbrook [[hepatitis]] study, and Stanley Milgram's studies of obedience to authority.\n\n=== Humans ===\nUniversity psychology departments have ethics committees dedicated to the rights and well-being of research subjects. Researchers in psychology must gain approval of their research projects before conducting any experiment to protect the interests of human participants and laboratory animals.<ref>The American Psychological Society: [http://www.apa.org/research/responsible/index.aspx Responsible Conduct of Research]</ref>\n\nThe ethics code of the American Psychological Association originated in 1951 as \"Ethical Standards of Psychologists\". This code has guided the formation of licensing laws in most American states. It has changed multiple times over the decades since its adoption. In 1989, the APA revised its policies on advertising and referral fees to negotiate the end of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. The 1992 incarnation was the first to distinguish between \"aspirational\" ethical standards and \"enforceable\" ones. Members of the public have a five-year window to file ethics complaints about APA members with the APA ethics committee; members of the APA have a three-year window.<ref name=HandbookJones>Stanley E. Jones, \"Ethical Issues in Clinical Psychology\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>\n\nSome of the ethical issues considered most important are the requirement to practice only within the area of competence, to maintain confidentiality with the patients, and to avoid sexual relations with them. Another important principle is [[informed consent]], the idea that a patient or research subject must understand and freely choose a procedure they are undergoing.<ref name=HandbookJones /> Some of the most common complaints against clinical psychologists include sexual misconduct, and involvement in child custody evaluations.<ref name=HandbookJones />\n\n=== Other animals ===\nCurrent ethical guidelines state that using non-human animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm (physical or psychological) done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sherwin | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Christionsen | first2 = S.B. | last3 = Duncan | first3 = I.J. | last4 = Erhard | first4 = H.W. | last5 = Lay Jr. | first5 = D.C. | last6 = Mench | first6 = J.A. | last7 = O'Connor | first7 = C.E. | last8 = Petherick | first8 = J.C. | year = 2003 | title = Guidelines for the Ethical use of animals in the applied ethology studies | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 81 | issue = 3| pages = 291\u2013305 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(02)00288-5}}</ref> Keeping this in mind, psychologists can use certain research techniques on animals that could not be used on humans.\n* An experiment by Stanley Milgram raised questions about the ethics of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress suffered by the participants.

Psychology includes the study of [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] phenomena, as well as [[feeling]] and [[thought]]. It is an academic discipline of immense scope. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, and all the variety of phenomena linked to those emergent properties, joining this way the broader [[Neuroscience|neuroscientific]] group of researchers. As a social science it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases.<ref name=\"Fernald\">Fernald LD (2008).

Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and [[social behavior]], while also exploring the [[Physiology|physiological]] and [[neurobiology|biological]] processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.\n\n<!--Subjects and methods:-->\nPsychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[attention]], [[emotion]], [[intelligence]], [[phenomenology (psychology)|subjective experiences]], [[motivation]], [[Human brain#Functions|brain functioning]], and [[personality psychology|personality]]. This extends to interaction between people, such as [[interpersonal relationship]]s, including [[psychological resilience]], [[family resilience]], and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind.<ref name =\"reference_name_A\">Although [[psychoanalysis]] and other forms of [[depth psychology]] are most typically associated with the unconscious mind, [[behaviorist]]s consider such phenomena as [[classical conditioning]] and [[operant conditioning]], while [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists]] explore [[implicit memory]], [[automaticity]], and [[subliminal message]]s, all of which are understood either to bypass or to occur outside of conscious effort or attention. Indeed, [[cognitive-behavioral therapist]]s counsel their clients to become aware of maladaptive thought patterns, the nature of which the clients previously had not been conscious.</ref> Psychologists employ [[empirical method]]s to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In [[eclecticism|addition]], or in [[antipositivism|opposition]], to employing empirical and deductive methods, some\u2014especially [[Clinical psychology|clinical]] and [[counseling psychology|counseling]] psychologists\u2014at times rely upon [[Hermeneutics#Psychology|symbolic interpretation]] and other [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] techniques. Psychology has been described as a \"hub science\" in that medicine tends to draw psychological research via neurology and [[psychiatry]], whereas social sciences most commonly draws directly from [[List of psychology disciplines|sub-disciplines within psychology]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2007/september-07/psychology-is-a-hub-science.html |title=Psychology is a Hub Science|journal=Aps Observer|volume=20|issue=8|quote=psychology is a hub discipline \u2014 that is, a discipline in which scientific research is cited by scientists in many other fields.

This definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades. However, this meaning was contested, notably by radical behaviorists such as [[John B.

Also since James defined it, the term more strongly connotes techniques of [[scientific experimentation]].<ref>[[Derek Russell Davis]] (DRD), \"psychology\", in Richard L.

Westport, Connecticut: Praeger.</ref> As early as the 4th century BC, Greek physician [[Hippocrates]] theorized that [[mental disorder]]s had physical rather than supernatural causes.<ref>T.L. Brink.

This body of knowledge involves insights drawn from introspection and observation, as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting. It frames the universe as a division of, and interaction between, physical reality and mental reality, with an emphasis on purifying the mind in order to increase virtue and power. An ancient text known as ''[[Huangdi Neijing|The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine]]'' identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom and sensation, includes theories of personality based on [[Yin and yang|yin\u2013yang]] balance, and analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria. Chinese scholarship focused on the brain advanced in the [[Qing Dynasty]] with the work of Western-educated Fang Yizhi (1611\u20131671), [[Liu Zhi (scholar)|Liu Zhi]] (1660\u20131730), and Wang Qingren (1768\u20131831). Wang Qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system, linked mental disorder with brain diseases, investigated the causes of dreams and [[insomnia]], and advanced a theory of [[Lateralization of brain function|hemispheric lateralization]] in brain function.<ref name=HsuehGuo>Yeh Hsueh and Benyu Guo, \"China\", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref>\n\nDistinctions in types of awareness appear in the ancient thought of India, influenced by [[Hinduism]]. A central idea of the [[Upanishads]] is the distinction between a person's transient mundane self and their [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|eternal unchanging soul]]. Divergent Hindu doctrines, and Buddhism, have challenged this hierarchy of selves, but have all emphasized the importance of reaching higher awareness. [[Yoga]] is a range of techniques used in pursuit of this goal. Much of the [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit corpus]] was suppressed under the [[British East India Company]] followed by the [[British Raj]] in the 1800s. However, Indian doctrines influenced Western thinking via the [[Theosophical Society]], a [[New Age]] group which became popular among Euro-American intellectuals.<ref name=Paranjpe>Anand C. Paranjpe, \"From Tradition through Colonialism to Globalization: Reflections on the History of Psychology in India\", in Brock (ed.), ''Internationalizing the History of Psychology'' (2006).</ref>\n\nPsychology was a popular topic in [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] Europe. In Germany, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646\u20131716) applied his principles of calculus to the mind, arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuum\u2014most notably, that among an infinity of human perceptions and desires, the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness is only a matter of degree. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] identified psychology as its own science, writing ''Psychologia empirica'' in 1732 and ''Psychologia rationalis'' in 1734. This notion advanced further under [[Immanuel Kant]], who established the idea of [[History of anthropology|anthropology]], with psychology as an important subdivision. However, Kant explicitly and notoriously rejected the idea of [[experimental psychology]], writing that \"the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry even as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine, for in it the manifold of inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought, and cannot then be held separate and recombined at will (but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit our purpose), and even observation by itself already changes and displaces the state of the observed object.\" In 1783, [[Ferdinand Ueberwasser]] (1752-1812) designated himself ''Professor of Empirical Psychology and Logic'' and gave lectures on scientific psychology, though these developments were soon overshadowed by the [[Napoleonic Wars]], after which the Old University of M\u00fcnster was discontinued by Prussian authorities.<ref>Schwarz, K. A., & Pfister, R.: ''Scientific psychology in the 18th century: a historical rediscovery.'' In: ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'', Nr. 11, p. 399-407.</ref> Having consulted philosophers [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]], however, in 1825 the [[Prussia]]n state established psychology as a mandatory discipline in its rapidly expanding and highly influential [[Prussian education system|educational system]]. However, this discipline did not yet embrace experimentation.<ref name=Horst>Horst U.K. Gundlach, \"Germany\", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref> In England, early psychology involved [[phrenology]] and the response to social problems including alcoholism, violence, and the country's well-populated mental asylums.<ref>Alan Collins, \"England\", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref>\n\n=== Beginning of experimental psychology ===\n[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|[[Wilhelm Wundt]] (seated) with colleagues in his psychological laboratory, the first of its kind.]]\n\n[[Gustav Fechner]] began conducting [[psychophysics]] research in [[Leipzig]] in the 1830s, articulating the principle ([[Weber\u2013Fechner law]]) that human perception of a stimulus varies [[logarithmically]] according to its intensity.<ref>Leahey, ''History of Modern Psychology'' (2001), p. 61.</ref> Fechner's 1860 ''Elements of Psychophysics'' challenged Kant's stricture against quantitative study of the mind.<ref>Fechner, G.

Wundt, in turn, came to Leipzig University, establishing the psychological [[laboratory]] which brought experimental psychology to the world.

It became very well known, largely because it tackled subjects such as [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[psychological repression|repression]], and the unconscious. These subjects were largely taboo at the time, and Freud provided a catalyst for their open discussion in polite society.<ref name=Kozulin1984Pages84to86 /> Clinically, Freud helped to pioneer the method of [[Free association (psychology)|free association]] and a therapeutic interest in [[dream interpretation]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Freud, S|year=1900|title=The Interpretation of Dreams|journal=|edition= 2nd|publisher=Hogarth Press, 1955|volume=IV and V|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Freud, S |title=The Unconscious |year=1915 |edition= 2nd |volume=XIV |publisher=Hogarth Press, 1955}}</ref>\n\nSwiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, influenced by Freud, elaborated a theory of the [[collective unconscious]]\u2014a primordial force present in all humans, featuring [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] which exerted a profound influence on the mind.

Cognitive psychologists have used a \"filter\" model of attention, according to which much information processing takes place below the threshold of consciousness, and only certain processes, limited by nature and by simultaneous quantity, make their way through the filter. Copious research has shown that subconscious ''[[priming (psychology)|priming]]'' of certain ideas can covertly influence thoughts and behavior.<ref name=Kihlstrom1999 /> A significant hurdle in this research is proving that a subject's conscious mind has not grasped a certain stimulus, due to the unreliability of self-reporting. For this reason, some psychologists prefer to distinguish between ''[[implicit memory|implicit]]'' and ''[[explicit memory|explicit]]'' memory. In another approach, one can also describe a [[subliminal stimulus]] as meeting an ''objective'' but not a ''subjective'' threshold.<ref name=BanksFarber>William P.

With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking, instinct also came to be seen as a primary source of motivation.<ref name=ForgasEtAl>Forgas, Williams, & Laham, \"Social Motivation: Introduction and Overview\", in Forgas, Williams, & Laham, ''Social Motivation'' (2005).</ref> According to [[drive theory]], the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence. Psychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as physical demands made by the organism on the nervous system. However, they believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche. Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the [[reality principle]], roughly corresponding to id and ego. Later, in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', Freud introduced the concept of the ''[[death drive]]'', a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and [[Repetition compulsion|psychic repetition of traumatic events]].<ref>Weiner, ''Human Motivation'' (2013), Chapter 2, \"The Psychoanalytic Theory of Motivation\" (pp. 9\u201384).</ref> Meanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking.<ref name=ForgasEtAl /><ref name=GodsilEtAl>Bill P. Godsil, Matthew R. Tinsley, & Michael S. Fanselow, \"Motivation\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 4: ''Experimental Psychology''.</ref> [[Clark Hull]] formalized the latter idea with his [[Drive reduction theory (learning theory)|drive reduction]] model.<ref>Weiner, ''Human Motivation'' (2013), Chapter 3, \"Drive Theory\" (pp. 85\u2013138).</ref>\n\nHunger, thirst, fear, sexual desire, and thermoregulation all seem to constitute fundamental motivations for animals.<ref name=GodsilEtAl /> Humans also seem to exhibit a more complex set of motivations\u2014though theoretically these could be explained as resulting from primordial instincts\u2014including desires for belonging, self-image, self-consistency, truth, love, and control.<ref>[[E. Tory Higgins]], ''Beyond Pleasure and Pain: How Motivation Works''; Oxford University Press, 2012; {{ISBN|978-0-19-976582-9}}{{page needed|date=February 2019}}</ref><ref>Shah & Gardner, ''Handbook of Motivation Science'' (2008), entire volume.{{page needed|date=February 2019}}</ref>\n\nMotivation can be modulated or manipulated in many different ways. Researchers have found that [[eating]], for example, depends not only on the organism's fundamental need for [[homeostasis]]\u2014an important factor causing the experience of hunger\u2014but also on circadian rhythms, food availability, food palatability, and cost.<ref name=GodsilEtAl /> Abstract motivations are also malleable, as evidenced by such phenomena as ''goal contagion'': the adoption of goals, sometimes unconsciously, based on inferences about the goals of others.<ref>Hank Aarts, Ap Dijksterhuis, & Giel Dik, \"Goal Contagion: Inferring goals from others' actions\u2014and what it leads to\", in Shah & Gardner, ''Handbook of Motivation Science'' (2008). \"In short, then, the studies presented above indicate that humans are keen to act on the goals of other social beings that are implied in behavioral scenarios or scripts.\" Also see: {{cite journal | last1 = Aarts | last2 = Hassin | last3 = Gollwitzer | title = Goal Contagion: Perceiving is for Pursuing | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 87 | issue = 1| year = 2004 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.1.23 | pages=23\u201337 | pmid=15250790| citeseerx = 10.1.1.312.5507 }}</ref> Vohs and [[Roy Baumeister|Baumeister]] suggest that contrary to the need-desire-fulfilment cycle of animal instincts, human motivations sometimes obey a \"getting begets wanting\" rule: the more you get a reward such as self-esteem, love, drugs, or money, the more you want it. They suggest that this principle can even apply to food, drink, sex, and sleep.<ref>Kathleen D. Vohs & [[Roy F. Baumeister]], \"Can Satisfaction Reinforce Wanting?

This may focus on cognitive, affective, moral, social, or neural development. Researchers who study children use a number of unique research methods to make observations in natural settings or to engage them in experimental tasks. Such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically useful, and researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of infants. In addition to studying children, developmental psychologists also study aging and processes throughout the life span, especially at other times of rapid change (such as adolescence and old age). Developmental psychologists draw on the full range of psychological theories to inform their research.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n=== Genes and environment ===\n{{Main|Behavioral genetics}}\n\nAll researched psychological traits are influenced by both genes and environment, to varying degrees.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng.3285 |pmid=25985137 |title=Meta-analysis of the heritability of human traits based on fifty years of twin studies |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=702\u2013709 |year=2015 |last1=Polderman |first1=Tinca J C. |last2=Benyamin |first2=Beben |last3=De Leeuw |first3=Christiaan A. |last4=Sullivan |first4=Patrick F. |last5=Van Bochoven |first5=Arjen |last6=Visscher |first6=Peter M. |last7=Posthuma |first7=Danielle |url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:364460/UQ364460_OA.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00084 |title=Three Laws of Behavior Genetics and What They Mean |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=160\u2013164 |year=2000 |last1=Turkheimer |first1=Eric }}</ref> These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals or families. An example is the transmission of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] from a depressed mother to her offspring. Theory may hold that the offspring, by virtue of having a depressed mother in his or her (the offspring's) environment, is at risk for developing depression. However, risk for depression is also influenced to some extent by genes. The mother may both carry genes that contribute to her depression but will also have passed those genes on to her offspring thus increasing the offspring's risk for depression. Genes and environment in this simple transmission model are completely confounded. Experimental and quasi-experimental [[behavioral genetic]] research uses genetic methodologies to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior.<ref name=\"Behavior Genetics\" /> Traditionally this research has been conducted using [[twin studies]] and [[adoption study|adoption studies]], two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un-confounded. More recently, the availability of [[microarray]] [[molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] or [[genome sequencing]] technologies allows researchers to measure participant DNA variation directly, and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and [[psychopathology]] through methods including [[genome-wide association studies]]. One goal of such research is similar to that in [[positional cloning]] and its success in [[Huntington's]]: once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype. One major result of genetic association studies is the general finding that psychological traits and psychopathology, as well as complex medical diseases, are highly [[polygenic]],<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.11.029 |pmid=22243964 |pmc=3257326 |title=Five Years of GWAS Discovery |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201324 |year=2012 |last1=Visscher |first1=Peter\u00a0M. |last2=Brown |first2=Matthew\u00a0A. |last3=McCarthy |first3=Mark\u00a0I. |last4=Yang |first4=Jian }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature13595 |pmid=25056061 |pmc=4112379 |title=Biological insights from 108 schizophrenia-associated genetic loci |journal=Nature |volume=511 |issue=7510 |pages=421\u2013427 |year=2014 |bibcode=2014Natur.511..421S |last1=Ripke |first1=Stephan |last2=Neale |first2=Benjamin M. |last3=Corvin |first3=Aiden |last4=Walters |first4=James T.

Written exams began during the Han dynasty (202 BC \u2013 AD 200). By 1370, the Chinese system required a stratified series of tests, involving essay writing and knowledge of diverse topics. The system was ended in 1906.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 41\u201342.</ref> In Europe, mental assessment took a more physiological approach, with theories of [[physiognomy]]\u2014judgment of character based on the face\u2014described by Aristotle in 4th century BC Greece. Physiognomy remained current through the Enlightenment, and added the doctrine of phrenology: a study of mind and intelligence based on simple assessment of neuroanatomy.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 42\u201343.</ref>\n\nWhen experimental psychology came to Britain, Francis Galton was a leading practitioner, and, with his procedures for measuring reaction time and sensation, is considered an inventor of modern mental testing (also known as ''[[psychometrics]]'').<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 44\u201345.</ref> James McKeen Cattell, a student of Wundt and Galton, brought the concept to the United States, and in fact coined the term \"mental test\".<ref name=Gregory2011Pages45and46>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 45\u201346.</ref> In 1901, Cattell's student [[Clark Wissler]] published discouraging results, suggesting that mental testing of Columbia and Barnard students failed to predict their academic performance.<ref name=Gregory2011Pages45and46 /> In response to 1904 orders from the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Minister of Public Instruction]], French psychologists [[Alfred Binet]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Simon]] elaborated a new test of intelligence in 1905\u20131911, using a range of questions diverse in their nature and difficulty. Binet and Simon introduced the concept of [[mental age]] and referred to the lowest scorers on their test as ''[[idiot]]s''. [[Henry H. Goddard]] put the Binet-Simon scale to work and introduced classifications of mental level such as ''imbecile'' and ''feebleminded''. In 1916 (after Binet's death), Stanford professor [[Lewis M. Terman]] modified the Binet-Simon scale (renamed the [[Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales|Stanford\u2013Binet scale]]) and introduced the [[intelligence quotient]] as a score report.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), p. 50\u201356.</ref> From this test, Terman concluded that mental retardation \"represents the level of intelligence which is very, very common among Spanish-Indians and Mexican families of the Southwest and also among negroes.

Practitioners typically includes people who have graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychology but may also include others. In Canada, the above groups usually fall within the larger category of ''[[professional psychology]]''. In Canada and the US, practitioners get bachelor's degrees and doctorates, then spend one year in an internship and one year in postdoctoral education. In Mexico and most other Latin American and European countries, psychologists do not get bachelor's and doctorate degrees; instead, they take a three-year professional course following high school.<ref name=HallHurley /> Clinical psychology is at present the largest specialization within psychology.<ref name=StrickerWidiger /> It includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically based distress, dysfunction or [[mental illness]] and to promote subjective well-being and personal development. Central to its practice are psychological assessment and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.<ref name=\"brain\">Brain, Christine.

For their part, some psychiatrists became interested in using psychoanalysis and other forms of [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]] to understand and treat the mentally ill.<ref name=Tomes2008 /> In this type of treatment, a specially trained therapist develops a close relationship with the patient, who discusses wishes, dreams, social relationships, and other aspects of mental life. The therapist seeks to uncover repressed material and to understand why the patient creates defenses against certain thoughts and feelings. An important aspect of the therapeutic relationship is [[transference]], in which deep unconscious feelings in a patient reorient themselves and become manifest in relation to the therapist.<ref>[[Nancy McWilliams]] and Joel Weinberger, \"Psychodynamic Psychotherapy\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>\n\nPsychiatric psychotherapy blurred the distinction between psychiatry and psychology, and this trend continued with the rise of [[Community mental health service|community mental health facilities]] and [[behavioral therapy]], a thoroughly non-psychodynamic model which used behaviorist learning theory to change the actions of patients. A key aspect of behavior therapy is empirical evaluation of the treatment's effectiveness. In the 1970s, [[cognitive-behavior therapy]] arose, using similar methods and now including the cognitive constructs which had gained popularity in theoretical psychology. A key practice in behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy is exposing patients to things they fear, based on the premise that their responses (fear, panic, anxiety) can be deconditioned.<ref>W. Edward Craighead & Linda Wilcoxon Craighead, \"Behavioral and Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>\n\nMental health care today involves psychologists and [[social work]]ers in increasing numbers. In 1977, National Institute of Mental Health director [[Bertram Brown (physician)|Bertram Brown]] described this shift as a source of \"intense competition and role confusion\".<ref name=Tomes2008>Nancy Tomes, \"The Development of Clinical Psychology, Social Work, and Psychiatric Nursing: 1900\u20131980s\", in Wallace & Gach (eds.), ''History of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology'' (2008).</ref> Graduate programs issuing doctorates in psychology (PhD or PsyD) emerged in the 1950s and underwent rapid increase through the 1980s. This degree is intended to train practitioners who might conduct scientific research.<ref name=HallHurley />\n\nSome clinical psychologists may focus on the clinical management of patients with brain injury\u2014this area is known as clinical neuropsychology. In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession. The emerging field of ''disaster psychology'' (see [[crisis intervention]]) involves professionals who respond to large-scale traumatic events.<ref>Teri L. Elliott, \"Disaster Psychology: Keep Clients out of Your Office\u2014Get into the Field!\" in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005). \"...it is the disaster psychologist's role to utilize crisis intervention processes with the goal of preventing natural distress due to the critical event from developing into a more harmful, long-term psychological condition.\"</ref>\n\nThe work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client (usually an individual, couple, family, or small group). Typically, these approaches encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. Four major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, existential\u2013humanistic, and systems or family therapy. There has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture, gender, spirituality, and sexual orientation. With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is evidence that most of the major therapies have equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong [[therapeutic relationship|therapeutic alliance]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Leichsenring, Falk |author2=Leibing, Eric |year=2003 |title=The effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive behavior therapy in the treatment of personality disorders: A meta-analysis |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=7 |pages=1223\u20131233 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1223 |pmid=12832233}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Reisner, Andrew |year=2005 |title=The common factors, empirically validated treatments, and recovery models of therapeutic change |journal=The Psychological Record |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=377\u2013400|doi=10.1007/BF03395517 |url=https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1192&context=tpr }}</ref> Because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an [[Integrative Psychotherapy|eclectic therapeutic orientation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Jensen, J.P. |author2=Bergin, A.E. |author3=Greaves, D.W. |year=1990 |title=The meaning of eclecticism: New survey and analysis of components |journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=124\u2013130 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.21.2.124}}</ref><ref>Palmer, S.; Woolfe, R.

The work of child psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky, [[Jean Piaget]], and [[Jerome Bruner]] has been influential in creating teaching methods and educational practices. Educational psychology is often included in teacher education programs in places such as North America, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nSchool psychology combines principles from educational psychology and clinical psychology to understand and treat students with learning disabilities; to foster the intellectual growth of [[intellectual giftedness|gifted]] students; to facilitate [[prosocial behavior]]s in adolescents; and otherwise to promote safe, supportive, and effective learning environments.

With funding from the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Fund and guidance from Australian psychologist [[Elton Mayo]], Western Electric experimented on thousands of factory workers to assess their responses to illumination, breaks, food, and wages. The researchers came to focus on workers' responses to observation itself, and the term [[Hawthorne effect]] is now used to describe the fact that people work harder when they think they're being watched.<ref>Yeh Hsueh, \"The Hawthorne experiments and the introduction of Jean Piaget in American industrial psychology, 1929\u20131932\"; ''History of Psychology'' 5.2, May 2002.</ref>\n\nThe name industrial and organizational psychology (I\u2013O) arose in the 1960s and became enshrined as the [[Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology]], Division 14 of the American Psychological Association, in 1973.<ref name=Koppes /> The goal is to optimize human potential in the workplace. Personnel psychology, a subfield of I\u2013O psychology, applies the methods and principles of psychology in selecting and evaluating workers.

In the U.S., this function began during World War I, when Robert Yerkes established the School of Military Psychology at [[Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia|Fort Oglethorpe]] in Georgia, to provide psychological training for military staff military.<ref name=Tomes2008 /><ref>[[Robert M.

A prominent aspect of health psychology is the psychoeducation of patients: instructing them in how to follow a medical regimen. Health psychologists can also educate doctors and conduct research on patient compliance.<ref>Marilu Price Berry, \"Interdisciplinary Medical Setting: The Multiple Roles of a Health Psychologist\" in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005).</ref>\n\nPsychologists in the field of public health use a wide variety of interventions to influence human behavior. These range from public relations campaigns and outreach to governmental laws and policies.

Baskin, \"Public Health: Career Opportunities for Psychologists in Public Health\", in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005). \"Prevention strategies of late have largely concentrated on community-based interventions, which have been shown to be effective in changing the health of large populations. Behavioral and social scientists, such as psychologists, are helpful in this arena as we are trained to view individuals as belonging to complex and dynamic social systems, including immediate and extended family systems, acquaintance and friendship networks, neighborhood and community systems, and cultural groups (Schneiderman & Spee4, 2001).\"</ref>\n\nBlack American psychologists [[Kenneth and Mamie Clark]] studied the psychological impact of segregation and testified with their findings in the desegregation case ''[[Brown v.

In 2010, ''Clinical Psychological Review'' published a special issue devoted to positive psychological interventions, such as [[gratitude journal]]ing and the physical expression of gratitude. Positive psychological interventions have been limited in scope, but their effects are thought to be superior to that of [[placebo]]s, especially with regard to helping people with body image problems.\n\n== Research methods ==\n{{Main|Psychological research|List of psychological research methods}}\n\n[[Quantitative psychological research]] lends itself to the statistical testing of hypotheses. Although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such research can only assess a limited range of short-term phenomena. Thus, psychologists also rely on creative statistical methods to glean knowledge from clinical trials and population data.<ref>John A. Schinka & Wayne F. Velicer, \"Volume Preface\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> These include the [[Pearson product\u2013moment correlation coefficient]], the [[analysis of variance]], [[multiple linear regression]], [[logistic regression]], [[structural equation modeling]], and [[hierarchical linear modeling]].

In an experiment, the researcher alters parameters of influence, called [[independent variable]]s, and measures resulting changes of interest, called [[dependent variable]]s. Prototypical experimental research is conducted in a laboratory with a carefully controlled environment.\n\n[[Repeated-measures experiment]]s are those which take place through intervention on multiple occasions. In research on the effectiveness of psychotherapy, experimenters often compare a given treatment with placebo treatments, or compare different treatments against each other. Treatment type is the independent variable. The dependent variables are outcomes, ideally assessed in several ways by different professionals.<ref>Evelyn S. Behar & Thomas D. Borkovec, \"Psychotherapy Outcome Research\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> Using [[crossover study|crossover design]], researchers can further increase the strength of their results by testing both of two treatments on two groups of subjects.\n\n[[Quasi-experimental design]] refers especially to situations precluding random assignment to different conditions. Researchers can use common sense to consider how much the nonrandom assignment threatens the study's [[Validity (logic)|validity]].<ref>Melvin M. Mark, \"Program Evaluation\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> For example, in research on the best way to affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school, school administrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms, in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments. Psychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes.\n\nExperimental researchers typically use a [[statistical hypothesis testing]] model which involves making predictions before conducting the experiment, then assessing how well the data supports the predictions. (These predictions may originate from a more abstract scientific [[hypothesis]] about how the phenomenon under study actually works.) Analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical techniques are used to distinguish unique results of the experiment from the [[null hypothesis]] that variations result from random fluctuations in data. In psychology, the widely used standard ascribes [[statistical significance]] to results which have less than 5% [[p-value|probability of being explained by random variation]].<ref>[[Roger E. Kirk]], \"Experimental Design\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>\n\n=== Other forms of statistical inference ===\n[[Statistical survey]]s are used in psychology for measuring attitudes and traits, monitoring changes in mood, checking the validity of experimental manipulations, and for other psychological topics. Most commonly, psychologists use paper-and-pencil surveys. However, surveys are also conducted over the phone or through e-mail. Web-based surveys are increasingly used to conveniently reach many subjects.\n\n[[Neuropsychological tests]], such as the [[David Wechsler|Wechsler scales]] and [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test]], are mostly questionnaires or simple tasks used which assess a specific type of mental function in the respondent. These can be used in experiments, as in the case of [[lesion]] experiments evaluating the results of damage to a specific part of the brain.<ref>Russell M. Bauer, Elizabeth C. Leritz, & Dawn Bowers, \"Neuropsychology\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>\n\n[[Observational studies]] analyze uncontrolled data in search of correlations; [[multivariate statistics]] are typically used to interpret the more complex situation. [[Cross-sectional studies|Cross-sectional]] observational studies use data from a single point in time, whereas [[longitudinal studies|longitudinal]] studies are used to study trends across the life span. Longitudinal studies track the same people, and therefore detect more individual, rather than cultural, differences. However, they suffer from lack of controls and from confounding factors such as ''selective attrition'' (the bias introduced when a certain type of subject disproportionately leaves a study).\n\n[[Exploratory data analysis]] refers to a variety of practices which researchers can use to visualize and analyze existing sets of data. In [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Modes of inference|Peirce's three modes of inference]], exploratory data analysis corresponds to [[abduction (logic)|abduction]], or hypothesis formation.<ref>John T. Behrens and Chong-Ho Yu, \"Exploratory Data Analysis\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> [[Meta-analysis]] is the technique of integrating the results from multiple studies and interpreting the statistical properties of the pooled dataset.<ref>Frank L.

[[Hans Berger]], the first researcher to use EEG on an unopened skull, quickly found that brains exhibit signature \"brain waves\": electric oscillations which correspond to different states of consciousness. Researchers subsequently refined statistical methods for synthesizing the electrode data, and identified unique brain wave patterns such as the [[delta wave]] observed during non-REM sleep.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = R\u00f6sler | first1 = Frank | title = From Single-Channel Recordings to Brain-Mapping Devices: The Impact of Electroencephalography on Experimental Psychology | url = http://cognitrn.psych.indiana.edu/busey/eegseminar/pdfs/EEGHistoryImpact.pdf | journal = History of Psychology | volume = 8 | issue = 1| year = 2005 | doi=10.1037/1093-4510.8.1.95 | pmid = 16021767 | pages=95\u2013117}}</ref>\n\nNewer [[functional neuroimaging]] techniques include [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[positron emission tomography]], both of which track the flow of blood through the brain. These technologies provide more localized information about activity in the brain and create representations of the brain with widespread appeal. They also provide insight which avoids the classic problems of subjective self-reporting. It remains challenging to draw hard conclusions about where in the brain specific thoughts originate\u2014or even how usefully such localization corresponds with reality. However, neuroimaging has delivered unmistakable results showing the existence of correlations between mind and brain. Some of these draw on a systemic [[neural network]] model rather than a localized function model.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moran | first1 = Joseph M. | last2 = Zaki | first2 = Jamil | title = Functional Neuroimaging and Psychology: What Have You Done for Me Lately? | url = http://ssnl.stanford.edu/download/file/fid/518| journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 25 | issue = 6| year = 2013 | doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00380 | pages=834\u2013842 | pmid=23469884}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cacioppo | first1 = John T. | last2 = Berntson | first2 = Gary G. | last3 = Nusbaum | first3 = Howard C. | title = Neuroimaging as a New Tool in the Toolbox of Psychological Science | url = http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbn08.pdf | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00550.x | pages = 62\u201367 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141031185051/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbn08.pdf | archivedate = 31 October 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aue | first1 = Tatjana | last2 = Lavelle | first2 = Leah A. | last3 = Cacioppo | first3 = John T. | title = Great expectations: What can fMRI research tell us about psychological phenomena? | url = http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/alc09.pdf | journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.12.017 | pages = 10\u201316 | pmid = 19232374 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160109084331/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/alc09.pdf | archivedate = 9 January 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nPsychiatric interventions such as [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] and drugs also provide information about brain\u2013mind interactions. [[Psychopharmacology]] is the study of drug-induced mental effects.\n\n[[File:Multi-Layer Neural Network-Vector.svg|thumb|[[Artificial neural network]] with two layers, an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain.]]\n\n=== Computer simulation ===\n{{See also|Computational cognition}}\nComputational modeling is a tool used in [[mathematical psychology]] and cognitive psychology to simulate behavior.<ref>Ron Sun, (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. Cambridge University Press, New York. 2008.</ref> This method has several advantages. Since modern computers process information quickly, simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for high statistical power. Modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that couldn't be directly observed in a human. Computational neuroscience uses mathematical models to simulate the brain. Another method is symbolic modeling, which represents many mental objects using variables and rules. Other types of modeling include [[dynamic systems]] and [[stochastic process|stochastic]] modeling.\n\n=== Animal studies ===\n[[File:MorrisWaterMaze.jpg|right|thumb|A rat undergoing a [[Morris water navigation test]] used in [[behavioral neuroscience]] to study the role of the [[hippocampus]] in [[spatial learning]] and memory.]]\n\nAnimal experiments aid in investigating many aspects of human psychology, including perception, emotion, learning, memory, and thought, to name a few. In the 1890s, Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioning. Non-human primates, cats, dogs, pigeons, rats, and other rodents are often used in psychological experiments. Ideally, controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable at a time, in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables. These conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings. In contrast, human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely, and depend upon so many factors, that it is difficult to control important variables for human subjects. There are pitfalls in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ncabr.org/biomed/FAQ_animal/faq_animal_8.html |title= Ncabr.Org: About Biomedical Research: Faq |accessdate= 1 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080708190108/http://www.ncabr.org/biomed/FAQ_animal/faq_animal_8.html |archivedate= 8 July 2008 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nComparative psychology refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. Research in this area explores the behavior of many species, from insects to primates. It is closely related to other disciplines that study animal behavior such as [[ethology]].<ref>Shettleworth, S.J. (2010) Cognition, Evolution and Behavior (2nd Ed), New York: Oxford.</ref> Research in comparative psychology sometimes appears to shed light on human behavior, but some attempts to connect the two have been quite controversial, for example the [[Sociobiology]] of [[E.O. Wilson]].<ref>Wilson, E.O. (1978) ''On Human Nature'' p. x, Cambridge, Ma: Harvard</ref> Animal models are often used to study neural processes related to human behavior, e.g. in cognitive neuroscience.\n\n=== Qualitative and descriptive research ===\nResearch designed to answer questions about the current state of affairs such as the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals is known as ''descriptive research''. Descriptive research can be qualitative or quantitative in orientation. ''Qualitative research'' is descriptive research that is focused on observing and describing events as they occur, with the goal of capturing all of the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations have been made.\n\n[[Qualitative psychological research]] methods include interviews, first-hand observation, and participant observation. Creswell (2003) identifies five main possibilities for qualitative research, including narrative, phenomenology, [[ethnography]], [[case study]], and [[grounded theory]]. Qualitative researchers<ref>Glaser, B. & Strauss, A. (1967). ''The discovery of grounded theory: Strategies for qualitative research''. Chicago: Aldine.</ref> sometimes aim to enrich interpretations or [[critical theory|critiques]] of symbols, subjective experiences, or social structures. Sometimes hermeneutic and critical aims can give rise to quantitative research, as in Erich Fromm's study of [[Authoritarian personality|Nazi voting]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}<!--(suggesting the authoritarian personality thesis)--> or [[Stanley Milgram]]'s [[Milgram experiment|studies]] of [[obedience to authority]].\n\n[[File:Phineas gage - 1868 skull diagram.jpg|right|thumb|[[Phineas P.

Sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed, and other times the participants do not know they are being observed. Strict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation is being carried out.\n\n===Program Evaluation===\n[[Program Evaluation]] is a systematic method for collecting, analyzing, and using information to answer questions about projects, policies and programs,<ref>Administration for Children and Families (2010) ''[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/other_resrch/pm_guide_eval/index.html The Program Manager's Guide to Evaluation]. Chapter 2: What is program evaluation?''.</ref> particularly about their effectiveness and efficiency. In both the public and private sectors, stakeholders often want to know whether the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving or objecting to are producing the intended effect. While program evaluation first focuses around this definition, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, if there are unintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shackman|first=Gene|title=What Is Program Evaluation: A Beginner's Guide|publisher=The Global Social Change Research Project|ssrn=3060080|date=11 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Criticism}}Contemporary issues in methodology and practice ==\n=== Metascience ===\nThe field of [[metascience]] has revealed significant problems with the methodology of psychological research.

Some famous past studies are today considered unethical and in violation of [[Guidelines for human subject research#APA Ethics Code|established codes]] the Canadian Code of Conduct for Research Involving Humans, and the [[Belmont Report]]).\n\nThe most important contemporary standards are informed and voluntary consent. After World War II, the [[Nuremberg Code]] was established because of Nazi abuses of experimental subjects. Later, most countries (and scientific journals) adopted the [[Declaration of Helsinki]]. In the U.S., the [[National Institutes of Health]] established the [[Institutional Review Board]] in 1966, and in 1974 adopted the [[National Research Act]] (HR 7724). All of these measures encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studies. A number of influential studies led to the establishment of this rule; such studies included the [[MIT]] and Fernald School radioisotope studies, the [[Thalidomide scandal|Thalidomide tragedy]], the Willowbrook [[hepatitis]] study, and Stanley Milgram's studies of obedience to authority.\n\n=== Humans ===\nUniversity psychology departments have ethics committees dedicated to the rights and well-being of research subjects. Researchers in psychology must gain approval of their research projects before conducting any experiment to protect the interests of human participants and laboratory animals.<ref>The American Psychological Society: [http://www.apa.org/research/responsible/index.aspx Responsible Conduct of Research]</ref>\n\nThe ethics code of the American Psychological Association originated in 1951 as \"Ethical Standards of Psychologists\". This code has guided the formation of licensing laws in most American states. It has changed multiple times over the decades since its adoption. In 1989, the APA revised its policies on advertising and referral fees to negotiate the end of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. The 1992 incarnation was the first to distinguish between \"aspirational\" ethical standards and \"enforceable\" ones. Members of the public have a five-year window to file ethics complaints about APA members with the APA ethics committee; members of the APA have a three-year window.<ref name=HandbookJones>Stanley E. Jones, \"Ethical Issues in Clinical Psychology\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>\n\nSome of the ethical issues considered most important are the requirement to practice only within the area of competence, to maintain confidentiality with the patients, and to avoid sexual relations with them. Another important principle is [[informed consent]], the idea that a patient or research subject must understand and freely choose a procedure they are undergoing.<ref name=HandbookJones /> Some of the most common complaints against clinical psychologists include sexual misconduct, and involvement in child custody evaluations.<ref name=HandbookJones />\n\n=== Other animals ===\nCurrent ethical guidelines state that using non-human animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm (physical or psychological) done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sherwin | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Christionsen | first2 = S.B. | last3 = Duncan | first3 = I.J. | last4 = Erhard | first4 = H.W. | last5 = Lay Jr. | first5 = D.C. | last6 = Mench | first6 = J.A. | last7 = O'Connor | first7 = C.E. | last8 = Petherick | first8 = J.C. | year = 2003 | title = Guidelines for the Ethical use of animals in the applied ethology studies | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 81 | issue = 3| pages = 291\u2013305 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(02)00288-5}}</ref> Keeping this in mind, psychologists can use certain research techniques on animals that could not be used on humans.\n* An experiment by Stanley Milgram raised questions about the ethics of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress suffered by the participants. It measured the willingness of study participants to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts that conflicted with their personal conscience.<ref>Milgram, Stanley. (1974), Obedience to Authority; An Experimental View. Harpercollins ({{ISBN|0-06-131983-X}}).</ref>\n* Comparative psychologist [[Harry Harlow]] drew moral condemnation for [[pit of despair|isolation experiments]] on rhesus macaque monkeys at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] in the 1970s.<ref>Blum 1994, p. 95, Blum 2002, pp. 218\u2013219. Blum 1994, p. 95: \"... the most controversial experiment to come out of the Wisconsin laboratory, a device that Harlow insisted on calling the 'pit of despair.{{'\"}}</ref> The aim of the research was to produce an animal model of clinical depression. Harlow also devised what he called a \"rape rack\", to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture.<ref>Blum, Deborah. Love at Goon Park: Harry Harlow and the Science of Affection. Perseus Publishing, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7382-0278-9}}</ref> In 1974, American literary critic [[Wayne C. Booth]] wrote that, \"Harry Harlow and his colleagues go on torturing their nonhuman primates decade after decade, invariably proving what we all knew in advance\u2014that social creatures can be destroyed by destroying their social ties.\" He writes that Harlow made no mention of the criticism of the morality of his work.<ref>Booth, Wayne C. ''Modern Dogma and the Rhetoric of Assent'', Volume 5, of University of Notre Dame, Ward-Phillips lectures in English language and literature, University of Chicago Press, 1974, p. 114. Booth is explicitly discussing this experiment. His next sentence is, \"His most recent outrage consists of placing monkeys in 'solitary' for twenty days\u2014what he calls a 'vertical chamber apparatus .... designed on an intuitive basis' to produce 'a state of helplessness and hopelessness, sunken in a well of despair.{{'\"}}</ref>\n<!--\nOrphaned footnote:\n[[Gregg Henriques]] of [[James Madison University]], for example, published his [[Tree of Knowledge System]] in 2003 as a proposal for the theoretical unification of psychology.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Henriques, G.R. |year=2003 |title=The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology |url=http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=7 |pages=150\u2013182 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.7.2.150 |issue=2}}</ref> For a general discussion and critique, see also [[Mark Jarzombek]]'s book, ''The Psychologizing of Modernity''.<ref>Jarzombek, M.

The film is loosely based on the [[Howl's Moving Castle|1986 novel of the same name]] by British author [[Diana Wynne Jones]]. The film was produced by [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]], animated by [[Studio Ghibli]] and distributed by [[Toho]]. The Japanese voice cast featured [[Chieko Baisho]] and [[Takuya Kimura]], while the version dubbed in English starred [[Jean Simmons]], [[Emily Mortimer]], [[Lauren Bacall]], [[Christian Bale]] and [[Billy Crystal]].\n\nThe story is set in a fictional kingdom where both magic and early 20th-century technology are prevalent, against the backdrop of a war with another kingdom. The film tells the story of a young, content milliner named Sophie who is turned into an old woman by a witch who enters her shop and curses her. She encounters a wizard named Howl, and gets caught up in his resistance to fighting for the king.\n\nInfluenced by Miyazaki's opposition to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|United States' invasion of Iraq]] in 2003, the film contains strong [[Pacifism|anti-war]] themes. Miyazaki stated that he \"had a great deal of rage about [the Iraq war],\" which led him to make a film which he felt would be poorly received in the US.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} It also explores the theme of [[old age]], depicting age positively as something which grants the protagonist freedom. The film contains [[Feminism|feminist]] elements as well, and carries messages about the value of [[compassion]].\n\nIn 2013, Miyazaki said the film was his favorite creation, explaining \"I wanted to convey the message that life is worth living, and I don't think that's changed.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} The movie is thematically significantly different from the book; while the book focuses on challenging class and gender norms, the film focuses on love, and personal loyalty and the destructive effects of war.{{sfn|Levi|2008}}\n\n''Howl's Moving Castle'' had its [[Film premiere|world premiere]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] on 5 September 2004, and was theatrically released in Japan on 20 November 2004. It went on to gross $190 million in Japan and $236 million worldwide, making it one of the most financially successful Japanese films in history. The film received critical acclaim, particularly for its visuals and Miyazaki's presentation of the themes. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] at the [[78th Academy Awards]], but lost to ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', in 2006, and won several other awards, including four [[Tokyo Anime Award]]s and a [[Nebula Award for Best Script]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nSophie, a young [[milliner]], encounters a wizard named Howl on her way to visit her sister Lettie. Upon returning home, she meets the Witch of the Waste, who transforms her into a ninety-year-old woman. Seeking to break the curse, Sophie leaves home and sets off through the countryside. She meets a living scarecrow, whom she calls \"Turnip Head\". He leads her to Howl's moving castle, where she enters without invitation. She subsequently meets Howl's young apprentice Markl and a fire demon named Calcifer, who is the source of the castle's magic and movement. When Howl appears, Sophie announces that she has \"hired herself\" as a cleaning lady.\n\nMeanwhile, Sophie's nation is caught up in a war with a neighboring kingdom, who is searching for their missing prince. The King summons Howl to fight in the war. However, Howl decides to send Sophie to the King (under the pretense of being his mother) to tell him that Howl is too much of a coward to fight. Before leaving, he gives Sophie a charmed ring that leads her to Calcifer and guarantees her safety. Sophie meets Suliman, the king's advisor, and also the Witch of the Waste, whom Suliman punishes by draining all of her power, turning her into a harmless old woman. Suliman warns Sophie that Howl will meet the same fate if he does not fight and so Howl arrives to rescue Sophie. Suliman tries to trap him, but with Sophie's help they escape along with the former Witch of The Waste and Suliman's dog Heen.\n\nSophie learns that Howl's life is somehow bound to Calcifer's and that Howl has been transforming into a bird-like creature to interfere with both sides in the war, but each transformation makes it more difficult for him to return to human form. Howl then has the castle magically-linked to Sophie's home, parking the castle itself on the town's outskirts. A few days later, the town is bombed by enemy aircraft and Suliman's henchmen attack the house and Sophie's hat shop. Howl heads out to protect the group. Sophie then moves everyone out of the house and removes Calcifer from the fireplace, which collapses the castle. The Witch of The Waste realizes that Calcifer has Howl's heart and grabs the fire demon, setting herself on fire. Sophie panics and pours water onto the Witch, which douses Calcifer. The castle then splits in two; Sophie falls down a chasm and is separated from the group.\n\nFollowing the charmed ring, Sophie wanders into a scene from the past, where she sees a young Howl catch a falling star \u2013 Calcifer \u2013 and give him his heart. Sophie calls for them to find her in the future as she is teleported away. She returns to the present, finds Howl, and they reunite with the others. The Witch returns Howl's heart, and Sophie places it back inside Howl, reviving him and freeing Calcifer, though he decides to stay. Sophie's curse is broken, though her hair remains white. After she kisses Turnip Head on the cheek, he returns to human form, revealing himself to be Justin, the missing prince from the enemy kingdom, who promptly heads for home. Suliman, watching through a crystal globe, decides to end the war. As the bombers fly away, Sophie, Howl and the others travel high in the air in a new flying castle.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Chieko Baish\u014d at the Tokyo International Film Festival 2019 (49013476248) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Chieko Baisho]], who voiced Sophie in the Japanese version of the film]]\n[[File:Emily Mortimer 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Picture of Emily Mortimer dressed in white against a green background|[[Emily Mortimer]], who voiced the young Sophie in the version of the film dubbed into English]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

So [he] felt some hesitation about the award.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} Miyazaki identifies as a [[pacifist]].{{sfn|Gordon|2005}}{{sfn|Smith|2011}}{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} On the eve of the Iraq War, Miyazaki decided to make a film that he felt would be poorly received in the [[United States]]. Despite the film's success in that country, literary scholar Dani Cavallaro stated that Miyazaki was able to \"create a film which ought, in principle, to have caused a certain unease among American audiences.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} In the movie, Madame Suliman appears to have only sadistic motivations for creating conflict,{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} and despite being [[omniscient]], is unable to recognize the idiocy of the war until the very end of the story. This reflects Miyazaki's desire to show real-world conflicts as also being somewhat arbitrary and fueled by the desires of capricious people.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|p=8}} Cavallaro stated that the depiction of the war carried \"an unmistakable bitter taste.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}}\n\nThe universe of ''Howl's Moving Castle'' is depicted as not having clear-cut villains and heroes; instead, the characters are complex, and even those that are initially portrayed in a negative light, such as Howl, are shown as capable of change.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} Matt Kimmich has stated, however, that the simplistic message of the film is that \"war is bad.\"{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} A scene where Sophie is standing in a beautiful field of flowers is interrupted by a war machine, \"a finger accusing empire as the destroyer of peace.\"{{sfn|Lioi|2010}} This portrayal is in strong contrast to other Miyazaki films like ''Princess Mononoke'', which criticizes military conflict in a more nuanced manner.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} Andrew Osmond stated that \"Howl's pure-hearted anti-war stance is presented as nihilism with no alternative as he fights forces from each side and becomes the worst terror of all,\" in the form of the monstrous bird. By transforming into the bird, Howl risks losing his own humanity; Calcifer comments at one point that he will soon not be able to return to human form.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} In contrast, Ashitaka in ''Princess Mononoke'' fights the demonic sickness with which he is afflicted, and tries to negotiate a peace between the two sides.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} Osmond states that both films also point out the limits of [[masculinity]], as exemplified by Howl and Ashitaka.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\n===Flight and critique of modernity===\nLike several other Miyazaki films,{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} ''Howl's Moving Castle'' reflects the director's love of [[flight|flying]].{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Sequences in the film include both several aircraft of inventive design, as well as Howl transforming into a bird.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Miyazaki examines flight as a theme most directly in the later film ''[[The Wind Rises]]''.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Miyazaki stated that he was attracted to military aircraft as a child, but that he grew to detest them because of the destructive purpose for which they are created.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Thus ''Howl's Moving Castle'' contains images both of aircraft shown as harmless and beautiful, and large military craft depicted as ugly and destructive.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Cavallaro writes that Miyazaki wants to \"portray flight as an object of admiration and awe,\" but that he is not \"[blind] to its abuse by unscrupulous strategists and rulers.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}}\n\nThe nuanced view of flight is part of Miyazaki's broader critique of modern society and technology. Margaret Talbot writes that in person, Miyazaki exhibits \"a profound dissatisfaction with modern life,\"{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} particularly with the effects of technology and a disconnection from nature.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} Many of his films depict technological hubris as among the roots of evil.{{sfn|Scott|2005a}} The battleships which are seen moving over the landscape are depicted as \"gleaming with modernity and parading righteousness,\"{{sfn|Wilson|Wilson|2015}} but are then shown to be highly destructive.{{sfn|Wilson|Wilson|2015}} In contrast, the semi-organic castle demonstrates \"Miyazaki\u2019s Taoist presentation of industrialism needing to be aligned with nature\" according to Carl and Garrath Wilson.{{sfn|Wilson|Wilson|2015}} Antonio Lioi writes that Miyazaki often depicts beautiful scenes in contrast to those containing symbols of modernity, such as the scene where Sophie's reverie is interrupted by a war machine. This contrast is part of an [[Ecology|ecological]] criticism of modernity, but Miyazaki also offers an alternative, in the form of beautiful natural scenery.{{sfn|Lioi|2010}}\n\n===Old age and compassion===\nMiyazaki stated that an attractive aspect of the story of ''Howl's Moving Castle'' was the relatively positive light it shed on growing old.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} When Sophie becomes old as a result of the witch's spell, she also feels more able to speak her mind. According to Miyazaki, old women are only infrequently allowed to dominate the screen as in ''Howl's Moving Castle'', which made it a risky concept.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} Elizabeth Parsons stated that the film disrupts the stereotype of \"aged unattractiveness,\" when the artificially aged Sophie manages to rescue two attractive men (who come to love her) and to unintentionally end the war in her country.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} Sophie's actions are those usually associated with grandmothers, such as being kind and nurturing to those around her, and engaging in housework; however, these actions are depicted as being powerful and heroic.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} Sophie is one of several strong female protagonists in Miyazaki's films.{{sfn|Lioi|2010}} According to Parsons, this gives the film a feminist aspect as well.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} Additionally, even though Sophie manages to make her presence in the castle legitimate by claiming to be a cleaning lady, the film goes on to show that the housework is equitably distributed, strengthening its feminist aspect.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}}\n\nIn 2013, Miyazaki stated that ''Howl's Moving Castle'' was his favorite creation, and explained his choice by saying \"I wanted to convey the message that life is worth living, and I don't think that's changed.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} In the film, Sophie is shown to overcome extreme challenges by learning to put the well-being of those she cares about above her own self-interest, a quality which Miyazaki refers to as devotion.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} Several of the protagonists in Miyazaki's films, such as Ashitaka and San in ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' and Sheeta and Pazu in ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' learn to survive by learning the same lesson.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} Cavallaro states that Miyazaki spreads this moral through the entire film, to convey human beings' ability to be compassionate, such as when the scarecrow holds an umbrella over Sophie's head when it rains.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} Over the course of the film, Howl, its most vain and selfish character, also learns to put others before himself.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} When Madame Suliman returns the Witch of the Waste to her true form as a decrepit old woman, Sophie takes her in and cares for her, despite the witch being responsible for Sophie's curse, thus strongly demonstrating the idea of compassion.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} The witch then nearly destroys Howl through her selfish behavior, but also helps save the castle at the end. Parsons writes that \"In Miyazaki's balancing act, old women can be powerful and weak, positive and negative, nurturing and selfish, maligned and loved; in short, they can not be simply categorized or stereotyped, and they can not be dismissed as fantasy malefactors embodied by evil witches.\"{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} They are also given a lot of space in the film as active characters, something not commonly found in western movies.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header    = \n| width     = 220\n| image1    = HayaoMiyazakiCCJuly09.jpg\n|alt1            = Picture of Miyazaki holding a microphone \n| caption1  = Director and screenwriter [[Hayao Miyazaki]] in 2009\n| image2    = Toshio Suzuki, Howl's Moving Castle premiere.jpg\n|alt2            = refer to caption\n| caption2  = [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]], who produced the film, at its premiere\n}}\nIn September 2001, Studio Ghibli announced the production of two films.

Therefore, the studio chose to manually retouch the digitally altered images, recreating the \"feel\" of a hand-drawn image.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|p=137}}\n\nLike with the other Studio Ghibli movies, the film was co-produced with other companies, which were [[Tokuma Shoten]], the [[Nippon Television Network]], [[Dentsu]], [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]], [[Mitsubishi Corporation|Mitsubishi]] and [[Toho]].<ref>{{cite news|first=David|last=Rooney|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/awards/howl-s-moving-castle-1200531227/|title=Howl's Moving Castle|work=Variety|date=8 September 2004|accessdate=5 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305202742/http://variety.com/2004/film/awards/howl-s-moving-castle-1200531227/|archive-date=5 March 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Comparisons between film and novel==\nThe film has several differences from the novel, partly due to the different requirements of the two media. [[Diana Wynne Jones]]' novel has a very large cast of characters, and several plot threads that were too complex to be transferred into the film.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=127}} As a result, characters such as Sophie's second sister Martha are left out, as is the plot thread involving Markl (who is called Michael in the novel, and depicted as an adolescent, rather than as a young boy) courting her.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} Jones discussed the film with [[Studio Ghibli]] representatives, but did not have any input or involvement in the production of the film. Miyazaki traveled to England in the summer of 2004 to give Jones a private viewing of the finished film. She has been quoted as saying \"It's fantastic. No, I have no input\u2014I write books, not films. Yes, it will be ''different'' from the book\u2014in fact it's likely to be very different, but that's as it should be. It will still be a fantastic film.\"{{sfn|nausicaa1|2016}}\n\nThe novel depicts Howl's castle as a tall, dark and sinister wizard's tower, very different from the complex image in the film. The film's castle may be seen as a parody of the machines seen in the movie, driven both by steam-engines and by magic. In the film, it is a \"rotund collage of chimneys, roofs, steam pipes, and other odd appendages, borne along on mechanized bird legs\"{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} that is similar to [[Baba Yaga]]'s hut in the popular fairy tale. It is vaguely organic, and almost depicted as a life-form.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} Similarly, Calcifer is a demonic figure in the book, as compared to the \"endearing\" persona and image that he has in the film.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} Both film and novel try to render fantastic elements as mundane and ordinary things. Although they are set in a [[fantasy]] universe, the characters are often shown performing routine tasks, like cooking breakfast or washing up, in contrast to the heroic actions typical of a fantasy universe.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=129}} In the novel, Jones disrupts the fantasy-world setting by including scenes in which the characters travel to the real-world [[Wales]]. The movie, however, avoids this digression, and maintains a constant setting.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=129\u2013130}}\n\nMiyazaki's biggest addition to the plot of the book was the use of the war as a large part of the plot. In the book, the war is only tangentially referred to; the king orders Howl to find the king's missing brother Justin, because Justin's military skills are needed for a forthcoming war.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} Howl's frequent disappearances are because of his womanizing habits, which makes Sophie see him as a superficial and cowardly person.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} In the film, however, Howl disappears from the scene in order to transform into a giant bird and disrupt the battle plans of both armies.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}}\n\nThe roles of several characters also differ between novel and film due to this plot change. The Witch of the Waste is the chief antagonist of the book, whereas in the film she is reduced by Madame Suliman's magic to an ultimately harmless old woman who evokes sympathy in the audience and in Sophie.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} In contrast, the film conflates the novel's two characters of Mrs. Penstemmon and the wizard Suliman into Madame Suliman. Although Suliman comes closest to being a traditional villain in the film, she is shown as having ambiguous motivations, and reviewers have stated that the real villain is war itself.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} Howl loses the \"rakish\" womanizing aspect that was a significant part of his character in the novel.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} In contrast, Sophie becomes a more conventional figure in the film; she is less grumpy and outspoken, and demonstrates her love for Howl earlier and more explicitly.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} The storyline in the novel of Sophie being a powerful sorceress in her own right is muted in the film, although she is still shown to have control over her curse.{{sfn|Levi|2008}}\n\nThe thematic focus of the story also differs between the novel and the film. Reviewer Antonia Levi wrote that the experience of watching the film was similar to reading high quality [[fan fiction]]; although the characters and the setting were the same, the story was different.{{sfn|Levi|2008}} Although in both cases the story begins with Sophie being a prisoner of her circumstances and of social norms, the challenges she faces are slightly different. Levi said that \"Jones uses Sophie, Howl, and Calcifer in a fairytale format to tell a story about challenging class and gender expectations, Miyazaki uses the same characters to tell a story about personal loyalty, love, and war.\"{{sfn|Levi|2008}}\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Joe Hisaishi 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Hisaishi]], who composed and conducted the score, in 2011]]\nThe score was composed and conducted by [[Joe Hisaishi]], and performed by the [[New Japan Philharmonic]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/other/12911/music-in-the-movies-joe-hisaishi|title=Music in the movies: Joe Hisaishi|work=Den of Geek|access-date=14 December 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215001607/http://www.denofgeek.com/other/12911/music-in-the-movies-joe-hisaishi|archive-date=15 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Film soundtrack|soundtrack CD]] was first released on 19 November 2004 by Tokuma Japan Communications.

At its worst, it's the most amazing 12-course meal you can't bring yourself to finish.\"{{sfn|Burr|2005}} [[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"Admirers of [Hayao Miyazaki's] work, which is wildly imaginative, emotionally intense and surpassingly gentle, will find much to appreciate in this film because it demonstrates, once again, his visual ingenuity and his sensitivity as a storyteller.

The film is loosely based on the [[Howl's Moving Castle|1986 novel of the same name]] by British author [[Diana Wynne Jones]]. The film was produced by [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]], animated by [[Studio Ghibli]] and distributed by [[Toho]]. The Japanese voice cast featured [[Chieko Baisho]] and [[Takuya Kimura]], while the version dubbed in English starred [[Jean Simmons]], [[Emily Mortimer]], [[Lauren Bacall]], [[Christian Bale]] and [[Billy Crystal]].\n\nThe story is set in a fictional kingdom where both magic and early 20th-century technology are prevalent, against the backdrop of a war with another kingdom. The film tells the story of a young, content milliner named Sophie who is turned into an old woman by a witch who enters her shop and curses her. She encounters a wizard named Howl, and gets caught up in his resistance to fighting for the king.\n\nInfluenced by Miyazaki's opposition to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|United States' invasion of Iraq]] in 2003, the film contains strong [[Pacifism|anti-war]] themes. Miyazaki stated that he \"had a great deal of rage about [the Iraq war],\" which led him to make a film which he felt would be poorly received in the US.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} It also explores the theme of [[old age]], depicting age positively as something which grants the protagonist freedom. The film contains [[Feminism|feminist]] elements as well, and carries messages about the value of [[compassion]].\n\nIn 2013, Miyazaki said the film was his favorite creation, explaining \"I wanted to convey the message that life is worth living, and I don't think that's changed.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} The movie is thematically significantly different from the book; while the book focuses on challenging class and gender norms, the film focuses on love, and personal loyalty and the destructive effects of war.{{sfn|Levi|2008}}\n\n''Howl's Moving Castle'' had its [[Film premiere|world premiere]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] on 5 September 2004, and was theatrically released in Japan on 20 November 2004. It went on to gross $190 million in Japan and $236 million worldwide, making it one of the most financially successful Japanese films in history. The film received critical acclaim, particularly for its visuals and Miyazaki's presentation of the themes. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] at the [[78th Academy Awards]], but lost to ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', in 2006, and won several other awards, including four [[Tokyo Anime Award]]s and a [[Nebula Award for Best Script]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nSophie, a young [[milliner]], encounters a wizard named Howl on her way to visit her sister Lettie. Upon returning home, she meets the Witch of the Waste, who transforms her into a ninety-year-old woman. Seeking to break the curse, Sophie leaves home and sets off through the countryside. She meets a living scarecrow, whom she calls \"Turnip Head\". He leads her to Howl's moving castle, where she enters without invitation. She subsequently meets Howl's young apprentice Markl and a fire demon named Calcifer, who is the source of the castle's magic and movement. When Howl appears, Sophie announces that she has \"hired herself\" as a cleaning lady.\n\nMeanwhile, Sophie's nation is caught up in a war with a neighboring kingdom, who is searching for their missing prince. The King summons Howl to fight in the war. However, Howl decides to send Sophie to the King (under the pretense of being his mother) to tell him that Howl is too much of a coward to fight. Before leaving, he gives Sophie a charmed ring that leads her to Calcifer and guarantees her safety. Sophie meets Suliman, the king's advisor, and also the Witch of the Waste, whom Suliman punishes by draining all of her power, turning her into a harmless old woman. Suliman warns Sophie that Howl will meet the same fate if he does not fight and so Howl arrives to rescue Sophie. Suliman tries to trap him, but with Sophie's help they escape along with the former Witch of The Waste and Suliman's dog Heen.\n\nSophie learns that Howl's life is somehow bound to Calcifer's and that Howl has been transforming into a bird-like creature to interfere with both sides in the war, but each transformation makes it more difficult for him to return to human form. Howl then has the castle magically-linked to Sophie's home, parking the castle itself on the town's outskirts. A few days later, the town is bombed by enemy aircraft and Suliman's henchmen attack the house and Sophie's hat shop. Howl heads out to protect the group. Sophie then moves everyone out of the house and removes Calcifer from the fireplace, which collapses the castle. The Witch of The Waste realizes that Calcifer has Howl's heart and grabs the fire demon, setting herself on fire. Sophie panics and pours water onto the Witch, which douses Calcifer. The castle then splits in two; Sophie falls down a chasm and is separated from the group.\n\nFollowing the charmed ring, Sophie wanders into a scene from the past, where she sees a young Howl catch a falling star \u2013 Calcifer \u2013 and give him his heart. Sophie calls for them to find her in the future as she is teleported away. She returns to the present, finds Howl, and they reunite with the others. The Witch returns Howl's heart, and Sophie places it back inside Howl, reviving him and freeing Calcifer, though he decides to stay. Sophie's curse is broken, though her hair remains white. After she kisses Turnip Head on the cheek, he returns to human form, revealing himself to be Justin, the missing prince from the enemy kingdom, who promptly heads for home. Suliman, watching through a crystal globe, decides to end the war. As the bombers fly away, Sophie, Howl and the others travel high in the air in a new flying castle.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Chieko Baish\u014d at the Tokyo International Film Festival 2019 (49013476248) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Chieko Baisho]], who voiced Sophie in the Japanese version of the film]]\n[[File:Emily Mortimer 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Picture of Emily Mortimer dressed in white against a green background|[[Emily Mortimer]], who voiced the young Sophie in the version of the film dubbed into English]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Despite the film's success in that country, literary scholar Dani Cavallaro stated that Miyazaki was able to \"create a film which ought, in principle, to have caused a certain unease among American audiences.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} In the movie, Madame Suliman appears to have only sadistic motivations for creating conflict,{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} and despite being [[omniscient]], is unable to recognize the idiocy of the war until the very end of the story. This reflects Miyazaki's desire to show real-world conflicts as also being somewhat arbitrary and fueled by the desires of capricious people.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|p=8}} Cavallaro stated that the depiction of the war carried \"an unmistakable bitter taste.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}}\n\nThe universe of ''Howl's Moving Castle'' is depicted as not having clear-cut villains and heroes; instead, the characters are complex, and even those that are initially portrayed in a negative light, such as Howl, are shown as capable of change.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} Matt Kimmich has stated, however, that the simplistic message of the film is that \"war is bad.\"{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} A scene where Sophie is standing in a beautiful field of flowers is interrupted by a war machine, \"a finger accusing empire as the destroyer of peace.\"{{sfn|Lioi|2010}} This portrayal is in strong contrast to other Miyazaki films like ''Princess Mononoke'', which criticizes military conflict in a more nuanced manner.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} Andrew Osmond stated that \"Howl's pure-hearted anti-war stance is presented as nihilism with no alternative as he fights forces from each side and becomes the worst terror of all,\" in the form of the monstrous bird. By transforming into the bird, Howl risks losing his own humanity; Calcifer comments at one point that he will soon not be able to return to human form.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} In contrast, Ashitaka in ''Princess Mononoke'' fights the demonic sickness with which he is afflicted, and tries to negotiate a peace between the two sides.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} Osmond states that both films also point out the limits of [[masculinity]], as exemplified by Howl and Ashitaka.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\n===Flight and critique of modernity===\nLike several other Miyazaki films,{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} ''Howl's Moving Castle'' reflects the director's love of [[flight|flying]].{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Sequences in the film include both several aircraft of inventive design, as well as Howl transforming into a bird.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Miyazaki examines flight as a theme most directly in the later film ''[[The Wind Rises]]''.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Miyazaki stated that he was attracted to military aircraft as a child, but that he grew to detest them because of the destructive purpose for which they are created.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Thus ''Howl's Moving Castle'' contains images both of aircraft shown as harmless and beautiful, and large military craft depicted as ugly and destructive.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Cavallaro writes that Miyazaki wants to \"portray flight as an object of admiration and awe,\" but that he is not \"[blind] to its abuse by unscrupulous strategists and rulers.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}}\n\nThe nuanced view of flight is part of Miyazaki's broader critique of modern society and technology. Margaret Talbot writes that in person, Miyazaki exhibits \"a profound dissatisfaction with modern life,\"{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} particularly with the effects of technology and a disconnection from nature.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} Many of his films depict technological hubris as among the roots of evil.{{sfn|Scott|2005a}} The battleships which are seen moving over the landscape are depicted as \"gleaming with modernity and parading righteousness,\"{{sfn|Wilson|Wilson|2015}} but are then shown to be highly destructive.{{sfn|Wilson|Wilson|2015}} In contrast, the semi-organic castle demonstrates \"Miyazaki\u2019s Taoist presentation of industrialism needing to be aligned with nature\" according to Carl and Garrath Wilson.{{sfn|Wilson|Wilson|2015}} Antonio Lioi writes that Miyazaki often depicts beautiful scenes in contrast to those containing symbols of modernity, such as the scene where Sophie's reverie is interrupted by a war machine. This contrast is part of an [[Ecology|ecological]] criticism of modernity, but Miyazaki also offers an alternative, in the form of beautiful natural scenery.{{sfn|Lioi|2010}}\n\n===Old age and compassion===\nMiyazaki stated that an attractive aspect of the story of ''Howl's Moving Castle'' was the relatively positive light it shed on growing old.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} When Sophie becomes old as a result of the witch's spell, she also feels more able to speak her mind. According to Miyazaki, old women are only infrequently allowed to dominate the screen as in ''Howl's Moving Castle'', which made it a risky concept.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} Elizabeth Parsons stated that the film disrupts the stereotype of \"aged unattractiveness,\" when the artificially aged Sophie manages to rescue two attractive men (who come to love her) and to unintentionally end the war in her country.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} Sophie's actions are those usually associated with grandmothers, such as being kind and nurturing to those around her, and engaging in housework; however, these actions are depicted as being powerful and heroic.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} Sophie is one of several strong female protagonists in Miyazaki's films.{{sfn|Lioi|2010}} According to Parsons, this gives the film a feminist aspect as well.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} Additionally, even though Sophie manages to make her presence in the castle legitimate by claiming to be a cleaning lady, the film goes on to show that the housework is equitably distributed, strengthening its feminist aspect.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}}\n\nIn 2013, Miyazaki stated that ''Howl's Moving Castle'' was his favorite creation, and explained his choice by saying \"I wanted to convey the message that life is worth living, and I don't think that's changed.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} In the film, Sophie is shown to overcome extreme challenges by learning to put the well-being of those she cares about above her own self-interest, a quality which Miyazaki refers to as devotion.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} Several of the protagonists in Miyazaki's films, such as Ashitaka and San in ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' and Sheeta and Pazu in ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' learn to survive by learning the same lesson.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} Cavallaro states that Miyazaki spreads this moral through the entire film, to convey human beings' ability to be compassionate, such as when the scarecrow holds an umbrella over Sophie's head when it rains.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} Over the course of the film, Howl, its most vain and selfish character, also learns to put others before himself.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} When Madame Suliman returns the Witch of the Waste to her true form as a decrepit old woman, Sophie takes her in and cares for her, despite the witch being responsible for Sophie's curse, thus strongly demonstrating the idea of compassion.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} The witch then nearly destroys Howl through her selfish behavior, but also helps save the castle at the end. Parsons writes that \"In Miyazaki's balancing act, old women can be powerful and weak, positive and negative, nurturing and selfish, maligned and loved; in short, they can not be simply categorized or stereotyped, and they can not be dismissed as fantasy malefactors embodied by evil witches.\"{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} They are also given a lot of space in the film as active characters, something not commonly found in western movies.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header    = \n| width     = 220\n| image1    = HayaoMiyazakiCCJuly09.jpg\n|alt1            = Picture of Miyazaki holding a microphone \n| caption1  = Director and screenwriter [[Hayao Miyazaki]] in 2009\n| image2    = Toshio Suzuki, Howl's Moving Castle premiere.jpg\n|alt2            = refer to caption\n| caption2  = [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]], who produced the film, at its premiere\n}}\nIn September 2001, Studio Ghibli announced the production of two films. The first would become ''[[The Cat Returns]]'' and the second was an adaptation of [[Diana Wynne Jones]]' novel, ''[[Howl's Moving Castle]]''.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|pp=157\u2013171}} A rumor persists that Miyazaki had an idea to do ''Howl's Moving Castle'' during a visit to [[Christkindelsm\u00e4rik, Strasbourg|Strasbourg Christmas market]].{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|pp=157\u2013171}} [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]], who produced ''Howl's Moving Castle'', stated that Miyazaki was inspired to make the film when he read Jones' novel, and was struck by the image of a castle moving around the countryside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/film/japanese-walt-disney/2005/09/15/1126750075920.html|title=Japanese Walt Disney - Film - Entertainment - theage.com.au|website=www.theage.com.au|language=en|access-date=14 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014165105/http://www.theage.com.au/news/film/japanese-walt-disney/2005/09/15/1126750075920.html|archive-date=14 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all|date=2005-09-18}}</ref> The novel does not explain how the castle moved, and Miyazaki was interested in figuring out how the castle might move, which led to the image of a castle on chicken legs.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} The complex moving castle changes and rearranges itself several times throughout the movie in response to Howl's eccentricity and the various situations.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|pp=157\u2013171}} The basic structure of the castle consists of more than 80 elements including turrets, a wagging tongue, cogwheels and chicken legs, that were rendered as digital objects.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|pp=157\u2013171}}\n\n[[Mamoru Hosoda]] of [[Toei Animation]] was originally selected to direct the film, but quit the project after Studio Ghibli's executives rejected many of his concept ideas.{{sfn|Shilling|2002}} The film was shelved until Miyazaki took over.{{sfn|Shilling|2002}} The project resumed with production in February 2003.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|pp=157\u2013171}} It was scheduled to be completed in the spring of 2004, and released in the summer of that year.{{sfn|Shilling|2002}}\n\nMiyazaki went to [[Colmar]] and [[Riquewihr]] in [[Alsace]], France, to study the architecture and the surroundings for the setting of the film.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|pp=157\u2013171}} Additional inspiration came from the concepts of future technology in [[Albert Robida]]'s work.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|pp=157\u2013171}} Commentators have stated that Miyazaki's imagery was influenced by his fondness for the \"illusion art\" of 19th century Europe.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|p=145}} Suzuki stated that unlike many Western films, in which the imagery went \"from the general [to] the specific,\"{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} Miyazaki employed a uniquely Japanese approach, frequently beginning with a very specific image and moving from there.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} However, ''Howl's Moving Castle'', and Miyazaki films in general, have a focus on realistic imagery in a way that other [[anime]] films do not.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}}\n\nThe film was produced digitally, but the original backgrounds were drawn by hand and painted prior to being digitized, and the characters were also drawn by hand prior to scanning them into the computer.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|pp=157\u2013171}} The 1400 storyboard cuts for the film were completed on 16 January 2004.{{sfn|Schnell|2013|p=7}} On 25 June the in-between animation was completed and checking was completed on 26 June.{{sfn|Schnell|2013|p=23}} Studio Ghibli used digital technology to run many copies of the still portions of a scene, a process which avoids inconsistencies between various still frames, but can create an impression of artificiality. Therefore, the studio chose to manually retouch the digitally altered images, recreating the \"feel\" of a hand-drawn image.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|p=137}}\n\nLike with the other Studio Ghibli movies, the film was co-produced with other companies, which were [[Tokuma Shoten]], the [[Nippon Television Network]], [[Dentsu]], [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]], [[Mitsubishi Corporation|Mitsubishi]] and [[Toho]].<ref>{{cite news|first=David|last=Rooney|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/awards/howl-s-moving-castle-1200531227/|title=Howl's Moving Castle|work=Variety|date=8 September 2004|accessdate=5 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305202742/http://variety.com/2004/film/awards/howl-s-moving-castle-1200531227/|archive-date=5 March 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Comparisons between film and novel==\nThe film has several differences from the novel, partly due to the different requirements of the two media. [[Diana Wynne Jones]]' novel has a very large cast of characters, and several plot threads that were too complex to be transferred into the film.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=127}} As a result, characters such as Sophie's second sister Martha are left out, as is the plot thread involving Markl (who is called Michael in the novel, and depicted as an adolescent, rather than as a young boy) courting her.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} Jones discussed the film with [[Studio Ghibli]] representatives, but did not have any input or involvement in the production of the film. Miyazaki traveled to England in the summer of 2004 to give Jones a private viewing of the finished film. She has been quoted as saying \"It's fantastic. No, I have no input\u2014I write books, not films. Yes, it will be ''different'' from the book\u2014in fact it's likely to be very different, but that's as it should be. It will still be a fantastic film.\"{{sfn|nausicaa1|2016}}\n\nThe novel depicts Howl's castle as a tall, dark and sinister wizard's tower, very different from the complex image in the film. The film's castle may be seen as a parody of the machines seen in the movie, driven both by steam-engines and by magic. In the film, it is a \"rotund collage of chimneys, roofs, steam pipes, and other odd appendages, borne along on mechanized bird legs\"{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} that is similar to [[Baba Yaga]]'s hut in the popular fairy tale. It is vaguely organic, and almost depicted as a life-form.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} Similarly, Calcifer is a demonic figure in the book, as compared to the \"endearing\" persona and image that he has in the film.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} Both film and novel try to render fantastic elements as mundane and ordinary things. Although they are set in a [[fantasy]] universe, the characters are often shown performing routine tasks, like cooking breakfast or washing up, in contrast to the heroic actions typical of a fantasy universe.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=129}} In the novel, Jones disrupts the fantasy-world setting by including scenes in which the characters travel to the real-world [[Wales]]. The movie, however, avoids this digression, and maintains a constant setting.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=129\u2013130}}\n\nMiyazaki's biggest addition to the plot of the book was the use of the war as a large part of the plot. In the book, the war is only tangentially referred to; the king orders Howl to find the king's missing brother Justin, because Justin's military skills are needed for a forthcoming war.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} Howl's frequent disappearances are because of his womanizing habits, which makes Sophie see him as a superficial and cowardly person.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} In the film, however, Howl disappears from the scene in order to transform into a giant bird and disrupt the battle plans of both armies.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}}\n\nThe roles of several characters also differ between novel and film due to this plot change. The Witch of the Waste is the chief antagonist of the book, whereas in the film she is reduced by Madame Suliman's magic to an ultimately harmless old woman who evokes sympathy in the audience and in Sophie.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} In contrast, the film conflates the novel's two characters of Mrs. Penstemmon and the wizard Suliman into Madame Suliman. Although Suliman comes closest to being a traditional villain in the film, she is shown as having ambiguous motivations, and reviewers have stated that the real villain is war itself.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} Howl loses the \"rakish\" womanizing aspect that was a significant part of his character in the novel.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} In contrast, Sophie becomes a more conventional figure in the film; she is less grumpy and outspoken, and demonstrates her love for Howl earlier and more explicitly.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} The storyline in the novel of Sophie being a powerful sorceress in her own right is muted in the film, although she is still shown to have control over her curse.{{sfn|Levi|2008}}\n\nThe thematic focus of the story also differs between the novel and the film. Reviewer Antonia Levi wrote that the experience of watching the film was similar to reading high quality [[fan fiction]]; although the characters and the setting were the same, the story was different.{{sfn|Levi|2008}} Although in both cases the story begins with Sophie being a prisoner of her circumstances and of social norms, the challenges she faces are slightly different. Levi said that \"Jones uses Sophie, Howl, and Calcifer in a fairytale format to tell a story about challenging class and gender expectations, Miyazaki uses the same characters to tell a story about personal loyalty, love, and war.\"{{sfn|Levi|2008}}\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Joe Hisaishi 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Hisaishi]], who composed and conducted the score, in 2011]]\nThe score was composed and conducted by [[Joe Hisaishi]], and performed by the [[New Japan Philharmonic]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/other/12911/music-in-the-movies-joe-hisaishi|title=Music in the movies: Joe Hisaishi|work=Den of Geek|access-date=14 December 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215001607/http://www.denofgeek.com/other/12911/music-in-the-movies-joe-hisaishi|archive-date=15 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Film soundtrack|soundtrack CD]] was first released on 19 November 2004 by Tokuma Japan Communications.
