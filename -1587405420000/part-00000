Influenced by her [[Japanese-American]] family's [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment]], her association with [[Malcolm X]], and her [[Maoism|Maoist beliefs]], she advocated for many causes, including [[black separatism]], the [[anti-war movement]], reparations for Japanese-American internees, and the rights of people imprisoned by the U.S. government for violent offenses whom she considered to be \"political prisoners\". On May 19, 2016, which would have been her 95th birthday, she was featured on the U.S. [[Google Doodle]], sparking controversy over her past statements expressing admiration for figures such as [[Osama bin Laden]] and groups like [[Al-Qaeda]] and [[Shining Path]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nMary Yuriko Nakahara was born on May 19, 1921, in [[San Pedro, California]], to Japanese immigrants Seiichi Nakahara, a fish merchant entrepreneur, and Tsuyako (Sawaguchi) Nakahara, a college-educated homemaker and piano teacher. She had a twin brother, Peter, and an older brother, Arthur. Her family was relatively affluent and she grew up in a predominantly white neighborhood. In her youth she attended a Presbyterian church and taught Sunday school. Kochiyama attended [[San Pedro High School]], where she served as the first female student body officer, wrote for the school newspaper, and played on the tennis team. She graduated from high school in 1939. She attended [[Compton Junior College]], where she studied English, journalism, and art.

Yuri, her mother, and her brother were \"evacuated\" to a converted [[horse stable]] at the Santa Anita [[Internment of Japanese Americans#Civilian Assembly Centers|Assembly Center]] for several months and then moved again to the [[War Relocation Authority]] internment camp at [[Jerome War Relocation Center|Jerome, Arkansas]], where they lived for the next three years.

Vitruvius described the human figure as being like the principal source of proportion among the [[Classical orders]] of architecture. ]]\n\n'''Renaissance humanism''' was a revival in the study of [[classical antiquity]], at first [[Italian Renaissance|in Italy]] and then spreading across [[Western Europe]] in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries. Contemporary use of the term ''humanism'' is consistent with the historical use prominent in that period, while ''Renaissance humanism'' is a [[retronym]] used to distinguish it from later humanist developments.<ref>The term ''la rinascita'' (rebirth) first appeared, however, in its broad sense in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Vite de' pi\u00f9 eccellenti architetti, pittori, et scultori Italiani]]'' (The Lives of the Artists, 1550, revised 1568) [[Erwin Panofsky|Panofsky, Erwin]]. ''Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art'', New York: Harper and Row, 1960.\n\"The term ''umanista'' was used in fifteenth-century Italian academic slang to describe a teacher or student of classical literature and the arts associated with it, including that of rhetoric. The English equivalent 'humanist' makes its appearance in the late sixteenth century with similar meaning. Only in the nineteenth century, however, and probably for the first time in [[Humanism in Germany|Germany]] in 1809, is the attribute transformed into a substantive: ''humanism'', standing for devotion to the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and the humane values that may be derived from them\" Nicholas Mann \"The Origins of Humanism,\" ''Cambridge Companion to Humanism'', Jill Kraye, editor [Cambridge University Press, 1996], p. 1\u20132).  The term \"[[Middle Ages]]\" for the preceding period separating classical antiquity from its \"rebirth\" first appears in Latin in 1469 as ''media tempestas''.</ref>\n\nRenaissance humanism was a response to what came to be depicted by later [[whig historians]] as the \"narrow pedantry\" associated with medieval [[scholasticism]].<ref>, Craig W. Kallendorf, introduction to ''Humanist Educational Treatises'', edited and translated by Craig W. Kallendorf (Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London England: The I Tatti Renaissance Library, 2002) p. vii.</ref> Humanists sought to create a [[citizenship|citizenry]] able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging in the [[Civic engagement|civic life]] of their communities and persuading others to [[virtue|virtuous]] and [[prudence|prudent]] actions. This was to be accomplished through the study of the ''[[humanitas|studia humanitatis]]'', today known as the [[humanities]]: [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]], [[history]], [[poetry]], and [[ethics|moral philosophy]].\n\nHumanism was a pervasive cultural mode and not the program of a small elite, a program to revive the cultural legacy, literary legacy, and moral philosophy of classical antiquity. There were important centres of humanism in [[Florence]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], [[Genoa]], [[Mantua]], [[Ferrara]], and [[Urbino]].\n\nThe Renaissance humanism also awoke in man a love of learning and \"a true love for books...[where] humanists built book collections and university libraries developed.\" Humanists believed that the individual encompassed \"body, mind, and soul,\" and learning was very much a part of educating all aspects of the human. This love of and for learning would lead to a demand in the printed word, which in turn drove the invention of Gutenberg's printing press.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Murray, Stuart|title=Library, the : an illustrated history|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc|isbn=978-1-62873-322-8|location=|pages=58, 68|oclc=855503629}}</ref> \n\n==Definition==\nAccording to one scholar of the movement,\n<blockquote>Early Italian humanism, which in many respects continued the grammatical and rhetorical traditions of the Middle Ages, not merely provided the old [[Trivium]] with a new and more ambitious name (''Studia humanitatis''), but also increased its actual scope, content, and significance in the curriculum of the schools and universities and its extensive literary production. The ''studia humanitatis'' excluded logic, but they added to the traditional grammar and rhetoric not only history, [[Greek language|Greek]], and moral philosophy, but also made poetry, once a sequel of grammar and rhetoric, the most important member of the whole group.<ref>Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965), p. 178.

Reprinted in ''Renaissance Thought'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks), 1961.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Origin==\n{{Renaissance}}\nSome of the first humanists were great butt collectors of antique butts [[manuscript]]s, including [[Petrarch]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Coluccio Salutati]], and [[Poggio Bracciolini]]. Of the four, Petrarch was dubbed the \"Father of Humanism\" because of his devotion or loyalty to Greek and Roman scrolls. Many worked for the [[Catholic Church]] and were in [[Holy orders in the Catholic Church|holy orders]], like Petrarch. In contrast, others were [[lawyer]]s and [[chancellor]]s of Italian cities, and thus had access to book copying workshops, such as Petrarch's disciple [[Salutati]], the [[Chancellor of Florence]].\n\nIn Italy, the humanist educational program won rapid acceptance, and, by the mid-15th century, many of the [[upper class]]es had received humanist educations, possibly in addition to traditional [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] ones. Some of the highest officials of the Catholic Church were humanists with the resources to amass important libraries. Such was [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Basilios Bessarion]], a [[Religious conversion|convert]] to the Catholic Church from [[Greek Orthodoxy]], who was considered for the [[papacy]], and was one of the most learned scholars of his time. There were several 15th-century and early 16th-century humanist Popes<ref>They include [[Innocent VII]], [[Nicholas V]], [[Pius II]], [[Sixtus IV]], [[Alexander VI]], [[Julius II]] and [[Leo X]]. Innocent VII, a patron of Leonardo Bruni, is considered the first humanist Pope.

This volume (pp. 92\u2013125) contains an essay by [[Leonardo Bruni]], entitled \"The Study of Literature,\" on the education of girls.</ref> These subjects came to be known as the humanities, and the movement which they inspired is shown as humanism.\n\nThe migration waves of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Byzantine Greek scholars]] and \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the period following the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusader]] [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|sacking of Constantinople]] and the [[fall of Constantinople|end of the Byzantine Empire]] in 1453 greatly assisted the revival of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] literature and science via their greater familiarity with ancient languages and works.<ref>[http://www.the-orb.net/encyclop/late/laterbyz/harris-ren.html Byzantines in Renaissance Italy]</ref><ref>[http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/e/polyglots/greeks-in-italy.html Greeks in Italy]</ref> They included [[Gemistus Pletho]], [[George of Trebizond]], [[Theodorus Gaza]], and [[John Argyropoulos]].\n\nItalian humanism spread northward to [[Humanism in France|France]], [[Germany]], the [[Low Countries]], Poland-Lithuania, Hungary and [[England]] with the adoption of large-scale printing after 1500, and it became associated with the [[Reformation]]. In France, pre-eminent humanist [[Guillaume Bud\u00e9]] (1467\u20131540) applied the [[philology|philological]] methods of Italian humanism to the study of antique [[coin]]age and to [[legal history]], composing a detailed commentary on [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's Code]]. Bud\u00e9 was a [[Absolute monarchy|royal absolutist]] (and not a [[republicanism|republican]] like the early Italian ''umanisti'') who was active in civic life, serving as a [[diplomat]] for [[Fran\u00e7ois I]] and helping to found the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France|Coll\u00e8ge des Lecteurs Royaux]] (later the Coll\u00e8ge de France). Meanwhile, [[Marguerite de Navarre]], the sister of Fran\u00e7ois I, was a [[poet]], [[novelist]], and [[religious mystic]]<ref>She was the author of ''Miroir de l'ame pecheresse'' (''The Mirror of a Sinful Soul''), published after her death, among other devotional poetry.

Contemporary use of the term ''humanism'' is consistent with the historical use prominent in that period, while ''Renaissance humanism'' is a [[retronym]] used to distinguish it from later humanist developments.<ref>The term ''la rinascita'' (rebirth) first appeared, however, in its broad sense in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Vite de' pi\u00f9 eccellenti architetti, pittori, et scultori Italiani]]'' (The Lives of the Artists, 1550, revised 1568) [[Erwin Panofsky|Panofsky, Erwin]].

The English equivalent 'humanist' makes its appearance in the late sixteenth century with similar meaning. Only in the nineteenth century, however, and probably for the first time in [[Humanism in Germany|Germany]] in 1809, is the attribute transformed into a substantive: ''humanism'', standing for devotion to the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and the humane values that may be derived from them\" Nicholas Mann \"The Origins of Humanism,\" ''Cambridge Companion to Humanism'', Jill Kraye, editor [Cambridge University Press, 1996], p. 1\u20132).  The term \"[[Middle Ages]]\" for the preceding period separating classical antiquity from its \"rebirth\" first appears in Latin in 1469 as ''media tempestas''.</ref>\n\nRenaissance humanism was a response to what came to be depicted by later [[whig historians]] as the \"narrow pedantry\" associated with medieval [[scholasticism]].<ref>, Craig W. Kallendorf, introduction to ''Humanist Educational Treatises'', edited and translated by Craig W.

This was to be accomplished through the study of the ''[[humanitas|studia humanitatis]]'', today known as the [[humanities]]: [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]], [[history]], [[poetry]], and [[ethics|moral philosophy]].\n\nHumanism was a pervasive cultural mode and not the program of a small elite, a program to revive the cultural legacy, literary legacy, and moral philosophy of classical antiquity. There were important centres of humanism in [[Florence]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], [[Genoa]], [[Mantua]], [[Ferrara]], and [[Urbino]].\n\nThe Renaissance humanism also awoke in man a love of learning and \"a true love for books...[where] humanists built book collections and university libraries developed.\" Humanists believed that the individual encompassed \"body, mind, and soul,\" and learning was very much a part of educating all aspects of the human. This love of and for learning would lead to a demand in the printed word, which in turn drove the invention of Gutenberg's printing press.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Murray, Stuart|title=Library, the : an illustrated history|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc|isbn=978-1-62873-322-8|location=|pages=58, 68|oclc=855503629}}</ref> \n\n==Definition==\nAccording to one scholar of the movement,\n<blockquote>Early Italian humanism, which in many respects continued the grammatical and rhetorical traditions of the Middle Ages, not merely provided the old [[Trivium]] with a new and more ambitious name (''Studia humanitatis''), but also increased its actual scope, content, and significance in the curriculum of the schools and universities and its extensive literary production. The ''studia humanitatis'' excluded logic, but they added to the traditional grammar and rhetoric not only history, [[Greek language|Greek]], and moral philosophy, but also made poetry, once a sequel of grammar and rhetoric, the most important member of the whole group.<ref>Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965), p. 178.

Of the four, Petrarch was dubbed the \"Father of Humanism\" because of his devotion or loyalty to Greek and Roman scrolls. Many worked for the [[Catholic Church]] and were in [[Holy orders in the Catholic Church|holy orders]], like Petrarch. In contrast, others were [[lawyer]]s and [[chancellor]]s of Italian cities, and thus had access to book copying workshops, such as Petrarch's disciple [[Salutati]], the [[Chancellor of Florence]].\n\nIn Italy, the humanist educational program won rapid acceptance, and, by the mid-15th century, many of the [[upper class]]es had received humanist educations, possibly in addition to traditional [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] ones. Some of the highest officials of the Catholic Church were humanists with the resources to amass important libraries. Such was [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Basilios Bessarion]], a [[Religious conversion|convert]] to the Catholic Church from [[Greek Orthodoxy]], who was considered for the [[papacy]], and was one of the most learned scholars of his time. There were several 15th-century and early 16th-century humanist Popes<ref>They include [[Innocent VII]], [[Nicholas V]], [[Pius II]], [[Sixtus IV]], [[Alexander VI]], [[Julius II]] and [[Leo X]]. Innocent VII, a patron of Leonardo Bruni, is considered the first humanist Pope.

This volume (pp. 92\u2013125) contains an essay by [[Leonardo Bruni]], entitled \"The Study of Literature,\" on the education of girls.</ref> These subjects came to be known as the humanities, and the movement which they inspired is shown as humanism.\n\nThe migration waves of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Byzantine Greek scholars]] and \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the period following the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusader]] [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|sacking of Constantinople]] and the [[fall of Constantinople|end of the Byzantine Empire]] in 1453 greatly assisted the revival of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] literature and science via their greater familiarity with ancient languages and works.<ref>[http://www.the-orb.net/encyclop/late/laterbyz/harris-ren.html Byzantines in Renaissance Italy]</ref><ref>[http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/e/polyglots/greeks-in-italy.html Greeks in Italy]</ref> They included [[Gemistus Pletho]], [[George of Trebizond]], [[Theodorus Gaza]], and [[John Argyropoulos]].\n\nItalian humanism spread northward to [[Humanism in France|France]], [[Germany]], the [[Low Countries]], Poland-Lithuania, Hungary and [[England]] with the adoption of large-scale printing after 1500, and it became associated with the [[Reformation]]. In France, pre-eminent humanist [[Guillaume Bud\u00e9]] (1467\u20131540) applied the [[philology|philological]] methods of Italian humanism to the study of antique [[coin]]age and to [[legal history]], composing a detailed commentary on [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's Code]]. Bud\u00e9 was a [[Absolute monarchy|royal absolutist]] (and not a [[republicanism|republican]] like the early Italian ''umanisti'') who was active in civic life, serving as a [[diplomat]] for [[Fran\u00e7ois I]] and helping to found the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France|Coll\u00e8ge des Lecteurs Royaux]] (later the Coll\u00e8ge de France).
