{"title_page": "Hug", "text_new": "{{other uses}}\n{{Redirect|Cuddle}}\n\n[[File:Wedding hugs.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A joyful hug between two friends at a [[wedding]]]]\nA '''hug''' is a form of [[Affection|endearment]], universal in [[Communities|human communities]], in which two or more people put their [[arm]]s around the neck, back, or waist of one another and hold each other closely. If more than two people are involved, it may be referred to as a '''group hug'''.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe origins of the word are unknown, but two theories exist. The first is that the verb \"hug\" (first used in the 1560s) could be related to the [[Old Norse]] word ''hugga'', which meant to comfort.

The next most successful nation is Jamaica, which has won four gold medals in both the men's and women's events. Those two nations share the highest medal tally at eighteen. [[France at the World Championships in Athletics|France]] and [[Canada at the World Championships in Athletics|Canada]], with two golds each, are the only other nations to have won multiple titles. [[Great Britain at the World Championships in Athletics|Great Britain]] has the third highest medal tally in the event at nine medals.\n\nJamaica's [[Usain Bolt]] is the most successful athlete of the event, with four consecutive gold medals from 2009 to 2015 and a silver medal in 2007. His female compatriots [[Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce]] and [[Kerron Stewart]] are the next most successful, with three gold medals and two silver medals. Another Jamaican woman, [[Beverly McDonald]], has the highest number of medals in the event at six (although only one of them gold). [[Nesta Carter]] and [[Carl Lewis]] are the only other athletes to have won three gold medals in the relay event.\n\nThe United States has twice been stripped of the gold medal due to doping by athletes on the national team, having lost both men's and women's titles in 2001.\n\n==Age==\n*All information from IAAF{{sfn|Butler|2013|p=34\u20137}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Distinction\n!Male athlete\n!Age\n!Female athlete\n!Age\n|-\n!Youngest champion\n| [[Eddy De L\u00e9pine]]|| 21 years, 136 days\n| [[Silke Gladisch]]|| 19 years, 51 days\n|-\n!Youngest medalist\n| [[Darrel Brown]]|| 16 years, 305 days\n| [[Aleen Bailey]]|| 18 years, 277 days\n|-\n!Youngest participant\n| [[Yahya Al-Ghahes]]|| 15 years, 174 days\n| [[Elizabeth Wilson (athlete)|Elizabeth Wilson]]|| 16 years, 221 days{{ref label|nb1|nb1|nb1}}\n|-\n!Oldest champion\n| [[Justin Gatlin]]|| 37 years, 237 days\n| [[Patricia Girard]]|| 35 years, 144 days\n|-\n!Oldest medalist\n| [[Troy Douglas]]|| 40 years, 274 days\n| [[Chandra Sturrup]]|| 37 years, 344 days\n|-\n!Oldest participant\n| [[Troy Douglas]]|| 40 years, 274 days\n| [[Merlene Ottey]]|| 43 years, 111 days\n|}\n*{{note label|nb1|nb1|nb1}} Only the birth year is known for Ghana's Elizabeth Wilson, although calculating her age from 1 January that year still makes her the youngest female participant.{{sfn|Butler|2013|p=34\u20137}}\n\n==Doping==\nThe men's event was affected by doping in its debut tournament in 1983, with [[Ben Johnson (Canadian sprinter)|Ben Johnson]] running for Canada, although the team did not progress beyond the first round. Johnson's drug use was only self-admitted during this period and he did not fail a drug test that year. Johnson ran for the fourth-placed Canada team at the 1987 event. His Canadian team mate [[Angella Issajenko]] later became the first female relay athlete to be sanctioned \u2013 she helped Canada to fifth at the same edition.{{sfn|Butler|2013|p=67\u20139}}\n\nThe positive drug test for Nigeria's [[Innocent Asonze]] in 1999 marked the first instance where a medal-winning team was disqualified at the World Championships in Athletics. Brazil was elevated to the bronze medal as a result.{{sfn|Butler|2013|p=67\u20139}} Doping persisted two years later, as France's [[Christophe Cheval]] was disqualified after a positive test for [[nandrolone]] shortly before the event (the team were semi-finalists only).<ref>[http://www.b.dk/sport/sprinter-afsloeret-med-doping Sprinter afsl\u00f8ret med doping] {{in lang|da}}.

Brazil were elevated to silver and the Netherlands became the bronze medallists. The next doping disqualification to occur in the relay was in 2009, when Nigerian women's runner [[Toyin Augustus]] had her team's first round result annulled. A similar fate met [[Lim Hee-Nam]] and the South Korean men in 2011.{{sfn|Butler|2013|p=67\u20139}} The fourth-placed Trinidad and Tobago team had their result retrospectively disqualified due to [[Semoy Hackett]]'s failed doping test prior to the competition.<ref>[http://www.trackalerts.com/index.php/news/latest-stories/6535-tat-federation-to-confirm-hacketts-positive-test-on-monday T&T federation to confirm Hackett's positive test on Monday] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210201314/http://www.trackalerts.com/index.php/news/latest-stories/6535-tat-federation-to-confirm-hacketts-positive-test-on-monday |date=December 10, 2015 }}.
