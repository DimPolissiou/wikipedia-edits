Each character has special abilities called \"Skybound Arts,\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://versus.granbluefantasy.jp/?lang=en|title=Granblue Fantasy: Versus &#124; Cygames|website=Granblue Fantasy: Versus &#124; Cygames}}</ref> which correspond to skills that the character is able to use in the main [[Granblue Fantasy]] game.  In an attempt to make the game more accessible to new players, each Skybound Arts can be triggered with a simple button press, but the player will have to wait for a short [[cooldown]] period before they can use it again.  However, if the player uses a more advanced combination of movement and button presses to launch the attack, the cooldown time on the skill will be shortened.\n\nThe game also contains a story mode. Unlike the main fighting game mode, the story mode will be more of a side-scrolling, [[beat-'em up]], [[action role-playing game]]. The story mode is slated to include exclusive bosses and minions to battle, setting weapon grids, and a co-op mode.<ref name=\"Granblue Extra Fes 2019\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2019/jul/20/granblue-fantasy-versus-will-reportedly-receive-ton-new-information-granblue-extra-fes-2019-august-3/|title=Granblue Fantasy Versus will reportedly receive a ton of new information at Granblue Extra Fes 2019 on August 3|first=Dakota 'DarkHorse'|last=Hills|date=July 20, 2019|website=EventHubs}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n<!-- Do not add Erika Harlacher yet.

series.<ref>https://twitter.com/gbvs_official/status/1232968809314570241</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Granblue Fantasy Versus'' is mainly a fighting game where the goal is to eliminate the opponent by using a combination of attacks to empty their character's life bar enough times to win the match.  Each character has special abilities called \"Skybound Arts,\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://versus.granbluefantasy.jp/?lang=en|title=Granblue Fantasy: Versus &#124; Cygames|website=Granblue Fantasy: Versus &#124; Cygames}}</ref> which correspond to skills that the character is able to use in the main [[Granblue Fantasy]] game.  In an attempt to make the game more accessible to new players, each Skybound Arts can be triggered with a simple button press, but the player will have to wait for a short [[cooldown]] period before they can use it again.  However, if the player uses a more advanced combination of movement and button presses to launch the attack, the cooldown time on the skill will be shortened.\n\nThe game also contains a story mode. Unlike the main fighting game mode, the story mode will be more of a side-scrolling, [[beat-'em up]], [[action role-playing game]]. The story mode is slated to include exclusive bosses and minions to battle, setting weapon grids, and a co-op mode.<ref name=\"Granblue Extra Fes 2019\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2019/jul/20/granblue-fantasy-versus-will-reportedly-receive-ton-new-information-granblue-extra-fes-2019-august-3/|title=Granblue Fantasy Versus will reportedly receive a ton of new information at Granblue Extra Fes 2019 on August 3|first=Dakota 'DarkHorse'|last=Hills|date=July 20, 2019|website=EventHubs}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n<!-- Do not add Erika Harlacher yet.

[[World War I]] had severed many lines of scientific communication, and new developments in German science were not well known in England. He also conducted [[Eddington experiment|an expedition]] to observe the [[solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]] that provided one of the earliest confirmations of [[general relativity]], and he became known for his popular expositions and interpretations of the theory.\n\n==Early years==\nEddington was born 28 December 1882 in [[Kendal]], [[Westmorland]] (now [[Cumbria]]), England, the son of [[Quaker]] parents, Arthur Henry Eddington, headmaster of the Quaker School, and Sarah Ann Shout.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783\u20132002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref>\n\nHis father taught at a Quaker training college in Lancashire before moving to Kendal to become headmaster of Stramongate School. He died in the [[typhoid]] epidemic which swept England in 1884. His mother was left to bring up her two children with relatively little income. The family moved to [[Weston-super-Mare]] where at first Stanley (as his mother and sister always called Eddington) was educated at home before spending three years at a preparatory school.  The family lived at a house called Varzin, 42 Walliscote Road, Weston-super-Mare.  There is a commemorative plaque on the building explaining Sir Arthur's contribution to science.\n\nIn 1893 Eddington entered Brynmelyn School. He proved to be a most capable scholar, particularly in mathematics and English literature. His performance earned him a scholarship to Owens College, Manchester (what was later to become the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]]) in 1898, which he was able to attend, having turned 16 that year. He spent the first year in a general course, but turned to [[physics]] for the next three years. Eddington was greatly influenced by his physics and mathematics teachers, [[Arthur Schuster]] and [[Horace Lamb]]. At Manchester, Eddington lived at Dalton Hall, where he came under the lasting influence of the Quaker mathematician J. W. Graham. His progress was rapid, winning him several scholarships and he graduated with a BSc in physics with First Class Honours in 1902.\n\nBased on his performance at Owens College, he was awarded a scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1902. His tutor at Cambridge was [[Robert Alfred Herman]] and in 1904 Eddington became the first ever second-year student to be placed as [[Senior Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Senior Wrangler]].  After receiving his M.A. in 1905, he began research on [[thermionic emission]] in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]. This did not go well, and meanwhile he spent time teaching mathematics to first year engineering students. This hiatus was brief. Through a recommendation by [[E. T. Whittaker]], his senior colleague at Trinity College, he secured a position at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich where he was to embark on his career in astronomy, a career whose seeds had been sown even as a young child when he would often \"try to count the stars\".<ref name=Douglas1956 />\n[[File:Arthur Eddington.jpg|thumb|260x260px|Plaque at 42 Walliscote Road, Weston-super-Mare]]\n\n==Astronomy==\n\nIn January 1906, Eddington was nominated to the post of chief assistant to the [[Astronomer Royal]] at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]]. He left Cambridge for Greenwich the following month. He was put to work on a detailed analysis of the [[parallax]] of [[433 Eros]] on [[photographic plate]]s that had started in 1900. He developed a new statistical method based on the apparent drift of two background stars, winning him the [[Smith's Prize]] in 1907. The prize won him a Fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge. In December 1912 [[George Darwin]], son of [[Charles Darwin]], died suddenly and Eddington was promoted to his chair as the [[Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy]] in early 1913. Later that year, [[Robert Stawell Ball|Robert Ball]], holder of the theoretical [[Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry|Lowndean chair]] also died, and Eddington was named the director of the entire [[Cambridge Observatory]] the next year. In May 1914 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]: he was awarded the [[Royal Medal]] in 1928 and delivered the [[Bakerian Lecture]] in 1926.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27eddington%27%29| title = Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher = Royal Society| accessdate=29 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nEddington also investigated the interior of [[star]]s through theory, and developed the first true understanding of stellar processes. He began this in 1916 with investigations of possible physical explanations for [[Cepheid variables|Cepheid variable stars]].  He began by extending [[Karl Schwarzschild]]'s earlier work on radiation pressure in [[Lane-Emden equation|Emden polytropic models]]. These models treated a star as a sphere of gas held up against gravity by internal thermal pressure, and one of Eddington's chief additions was to show that radiation pressure was necessary to prevent collapse of the sphere. He developed his model despite knowingly lacking firm foundations for understanding opacity and energy generation in the stellar interior. However, his results allowed for calculation of temperature, [[density]] and [[pressure]] at all points inside a star (thermodynamic anisotropy), and Eddington argued that his theory was so useful for further astrophysical investigation that it should be retained despite not being based on completely accepted physics. [[James Jeans]] contributed the important suggestion that stellar matter would certainly be [[Ionization|ionized]], but that was the end of any collaboration between the pair, who became famous for their lively debates.\n\nEddington defended his method by pointing to the utility of his results, particularly his important [[mass-luminosity relation]]. This had the unexpected result of showing that virtually all stars, including giants and dwarfs, behaved as [[ideal gases]].  In the process of developing his stellar models, he sought to overturn current thinking about the sources of stellar energy. Jeans and others defended the [[Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz mechanism]], which was based on classical mechanics, while Eddington speculated broadly about the qualitative and quantitative consequences of possible proton-electron annihilation and nuclear fusion processes.\n\nAround 1920, he anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars, in his paper ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars''.<ref name=eddington/><ref name=eddington2/> At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to Einstein's equation ''E = mc<sup>2</sup>''. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even the fact that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered. Eddington's paper, based on knowledge at the time, reasoned that:\n\n:# The leading theory of stellar energy, the [[contraction hypothesis]], should cause stars' rotation to visibly speed up due to [[conservation of angular momentum]]. But observations of [[Cepheid]] variable stars showed this was not happening.\n:# The only other known plausible source of energy was conversion of matter to energy; Einstein had shown some years earlier that a small amount of matter was equivalent to a large amount of energy. \n:# [[Francis William Aston|Francis Aston]] had also recently shown that the mass of a [[helium]] atom was about 0.8% less than the mass of the four hydrogen atoms which would, combined, form a helium atom, suggesting that if such a combination could happen, it would release considerable energy as a byproduct.\n:# If a star contained just 5% of fusible hydrogen, it would suffice to explain how stars got their energy. (We now know that most 'ordinary' stars contain far more than 5% hydrogen)\n:# Further elements might also be fused, and other scientists had speculated that stars were the \"crucible\" in which light elements combined to create heavy elements, but without more accurate measurements of their [[atomic mass]]es nothing more could be said at the time.\n\nAll of these speculations were proven correct in the following decades.\n\nWith these assumptions, he demonstrated that the interior temperature of stars must be millions of degrees. In 1924, he discovered the [[Main sequence|mass-luminosity relation]] for [[star]]s (see Lecchini in [[#External links and references]] ).  Despite some disagreement, Eddington's models were eventually accepted as a powerful tool for further investigation, particularly in issues of stellar evolution.  The confirmation of his estimated stellar diameters by Michelson in 1920 proved crucial in convincing astronomers unused to Eddington's intuitive, exploratory style. Eddington's theory appeared in mature form in 1926 as ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars'', which became an important text for training an entire generation of astrophysicists.\n\nEddington's work in astrophysics in the late 1920s and the 1930s continued his work in stellar structure, and precipitated further clashes with Jeans and [[Edward Arthur Milne]]. An important topic was the extension of his models to take advantage of developments in [[quantum physics]], including the use of degeneracy physics in describing dwarf stars.\n\n===Dispute with Chandrasekhar on existence of black holes===\n\nThe topic of extension of his models precipitated his dispute with [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]], who was then a student at Cambridge. Chandrasekhar's work presaged the discovery of [[black hole]]s, which at the time seemed so absurdly non-physical that Eddington refused to believe that Chandrasekhar's purely mathematical derivation had consequences for the real world. Eddington was wrong and his motivation is controversial. Chandrasekhar's narrative of this incident, in which his work is harshly rejected, portrays Eddington as rather cruel, dogmatic, and racist.  Eddington's criticism seems to have been based on a suspicion that a purely mathematical derivation from relativity theory was not enough to explain the seemingly daunting physical paradoxes that were inherent to degenerate stars.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Padmanabhan | first1 = T.\n| title = The dark side of astronomy\n| doi = 10.1038/435020a\n| journal = Nature\n| volume = 435\n| issue = 7038\n| pages = 20\u201321\n| year = 2005\n|bibcode = 2005Natur.435...20P }}</ref>\n\n==Relativity==\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Eddington was Secretary of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]], which meant he was the first to receive a series of letters and papers from [[Willem de Sitter]] regarding Einstein's theory of general relativity.

He quickly became the chief supporter and expositor of relativity in Britain. He and [[Astronomer Royal]] [[Frank Watson Dyson]] organized [[Eddington experiment|two expeditions]] to observe a [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse in 1919]] to make the first empirical test of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory: the measurement of the deflection of light by the sun's gravitational field. In fact, Dyson's argument for the indispensability of Eddington's expertise in this test was what prevented Eddington from eventually having to enter military service.<ref name=Douglas1956 /><ref name=Chandrasekhar1983 />\n\nWhen conscription was introduced in Britain on 2 March 1916, Eddington intended to apply for an exemption as a [[conscientious objector]].<ref name=Douglas1956 /> Cambridge University authorities instead requested and were granted an exemption on the ground of Eddington's work being of national interest. In 1918, this was appealed against by the [[Ministry of National Service]]. Before the appeal tribunal in June, Eddington claimed conscientious objector status, which was not recognized and would have ended his exemption in August 1918. A further two hearings took place in June and July, respectively. Eddington's personal statement at the June hearing about his objection to war based on religious grounds is on record.<ref name=Douglas1956 /> [[Astronomer Royal]], [[Sir Frank Dyson]], supported Eddington at the July hearing with a written statement, emphasising Eddington's essential role in the [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse]] expedition to [[Pr\u00edncipe]] in May 1919. Eddington made clear his willingness to serve in the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]], under the jurisdiction of the British  [[Red Cross]], or as a harvest labourer. However, the tribunal's decision to grant a further twelve months exemption from military service was on condition of Eddington continuing his astronomy work, in particular in preparation for the Pr\u00edncipe expedition.<ref name=Douglas1956 /><ref name=Chandrasekhar1983 /> The war ended before the end of his exemption.\n\n[[File:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|260px|thumb|right|One of Eddington's photographs of the total [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]], presented in his 1920 paper announcing its success, confirming [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory that light \"bends\"]]\nAfter the war, Eddington travelled to the island of Pr\u00edncipe off the west coast of Africa to watch the [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]]. During the eclipse, he took pictures of the stars (several stars in the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades cluster]] include [[Kappa Tauri]] of the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]) in the region around the Sun.<ref name=\"Eddington1920\"/> According to the theory of [[general relativity]], stars with light rays that passed near the Sun would appear to have been slightly shifted because their light had been curved by its gravitational field. This effect is noticeable only during eclipses, since otherwise the Sun's brightness obscures the affected stars. Eddington showed that Newtonian gravitation could be interpreted to predict half the shift predicted by Einstein.\n\nEddington's observations published the next year<ref name=\"Eddington1920\">{{cite journal|last=Dyson|author2=Eddington, A.S.|author3=Davidson, C.R. |date=1920 |title=A Determination of the Deflection of Light by the Sun's Gravitational Field, from Observations Made at the Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|Phil.

The news was reported in newspapers all over the world as a major story. Afterward, Eddington embarked on a campaign to popularize relativity and the expedition as landmarks both in scientific development and international scientific relations.\n\nIt has been claimed that Eddington's observations were of poor quality, and he had unjustly discounted simultaneous observations at [[Sobral, Brazil]], which appeared closer to the Newtonian model, but a 1979 re-analysis with modern measuring equipment and contemporary software validated Eddington's results and conclusions.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Not Only Because of Theory: Dyson, Eddington and the Competing Myths of the 1919 Eclipse Expedition|first=Daniel|last=Kennefick|date=5 September 2007|doi=10.1016/j.shpsa.2012.07.010|arxiv=0709.0685|bibcode = 2007arXiv0709.0685K}}</ref> The quality of the 1919 results was indeed poor compared to later observations, but was sufficient to persuade contemporary astronomers.

They include the line \"A general discussion followed. The President remarked that the 83rd meeting was historic\".]]\n\nThroughout this period, Eddington lectured on relativity, and was particularly well known for his ability to explain the concepts in lay terms as well as scientific. He collected many of these into the ''Mathematical Theory of Relativity'' in 1923, which [[Albert Einstein]] suggested was \"the finest presentation of the subject in any language.\" He was an early advocate of Einstein's General Relativity, and an interesting anecdote well illustrates his humour and personal intellectual investment: [[Ludwik Silberstein]], a physicist who thought of himself as an expert on relativity, approached Eddington at the [[Royal Society]]'s (6 November) 1919 meeting where he had defended Einstein's Relativity with his Brazil-Pr\u00edncipe Solar Eclipse calculations with some degree of skepticism, and ruefully charged Arthur as one who claimed to be one of three men who actually understood the theory (Silberstein, of course, was including himself and Einstein as the other). When Eddington refrained from replying, he insisted Arthur not be \"so shy\", whereupon Eddington replied, \"Oh, no! I was wondering who the third one might be!\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">As related by Eddington to Chandrasekhar and quoted in Walter Isaacson \"Einstein: His Life and Universe\", page 262</ref>\n\n==Cosmology==\nEddington was also heavily involved with the development of the first generation of general relativistic cosmological models. He had been investigating the instability of the Einstein universe when he learned of both [[Georges Lema\u00eetre|Lema\u00eetre's]] 1927 paper postulating an expanding or contracting universe and Hubble's work on the recession of the spiral nebulae. He felt the [[cosmological constant]] must have played the crucial role in the universe's evolution from an Einsteinian steady state to its current expanding state, and most of his cosmological investigations focused on the constant's significance and characteristics.  In ''The Mathematical Theory of Relativity,'' Eddington interpreted the cosmological constant to mean that the universe is \"self-gauging\".\n\n==Fundamental theory and the Eddington number==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Chandrasekhar limit]] & redirect [[Fundamental theory (Eddington)]] -->\nDuring the 1920s until his death, Eddington increasingly concentrated on what he called \"[[Classical unified field theories#Eddington's affine geometry|fundamental theory]]\" which was intended to be a unification of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], [[theory of relativity|relativity]], cosmology, and [[gravitation]]. At first he progressed along \"traditional\" lines, but turned increasingly to an almost [[numerology|numerological]] analysis of the dimensionless ratios of fundamental constants.\n\nHis basic approach was to combine several fundamental constants in order to produce a dimensionless number. In many cases these would result in numbers close to 10<sup>40</sup>, its square, or its square root. He was convinced that the mass of the [[proton]] and the charge of the [[electron]] were a ''natural and complete specification for constructing a Universe'' and that their values were not accidental. One of the discoverers of quantum mechanics, [[Paul Dirac]], also pursued this line of investigation, which has become known as the [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis]], and some scientists even today believe it has something to it.{{Citation needed|reason=Which scientists? What is the 'something'?|date=December 2016}}\n\nA somewhat damaging statement in his defence of these concepts involved the [[fine structure constant]], \u03b1. At the time it was measured to be very close to 1/136, and he argued that the value should in fact be exactly 1/136 for epistemological reasons. Later measurements placed the value much closer to 1/137, at which point he switched his line of reasoning to argue that one more should be added to the [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], so that the value should in fact be exactly 1/137, the [[Eddington number]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Whittaker|first=Edmund|date=1945|title=Eddington's Theory of the Constants of Nature|journal=The Mathematical Gazette|volume=29|issue=286|pages=137\u2013144|doi=10.2307/3609461|jstor=3609461}}</ref> Wags at the time started calling him \"Arthur Adding-one\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Kean, Sam|title=The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements|year=2010|location=New York|publisher=Little, Brown and Co|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cky2x4wWvEUC&pg=PT241&lpg=PT241|isbn=9780316089081}}</ref> This change of stance detracted from Eddington's credibility in the physics community. The [http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?alphinv|search_for=fine+structure+constant current measured value] is estimated at 1/137.035 999 074(44).\n\nEddington believed he had identified an algebraic basis for fundamental physics, which he termed \"E-numbers\" (representing a certain [[group (mathematics)|group]]&nbsp;\u2013 a [[Clifford algebra]]). These in effect incorporated [[spacetime]] into a higher-dimensional structure. While his theory has long been neglected by the general physics community, similar algebraic notions underlie many modern attempts at a [[grand unified theory]]. Moreover, Eddington's emphasis on the values of the fundamental constants, and specifically upon dimensionless numbers derived from them, is nowadays a central concern of physics. In particular, he predicted a number of hydrogen atoms in the Universe 136 \u00d7 2<sup>256</sup>, or equivalently the half of the total number of particles protons + electrons.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barrow |first=J.

The Eddington number in the context of cycling is defined as the maximum number E such that the cyclist has cycled E miles on E days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://physicsworldarchive.iop.org/index.cfm?action=summary&doc=18/11/phwv18i11a30@pwa-xml&qt=|title=Physics World - IOPscience|website=physicsworldarchive.iop.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tlatet.blogspot.com/2008/03/eddington-number.html|title=Eddington number|date=16 March 2008}}</ref> For example, an Eddington number of 70 would imply that the cyclist has cycled at least 70 miles in a day on 70 occasions. Achieving a high Eddington number is difficult since moving from, say, 70 to 75 will probably require more than five new long distance rides, since any rides shorter than 75 miles will no longer be included in the reckoning. Eddington's own E-number was 84.<ref>Physics World (Institute of Physics) July 2012 page 15</ref>\n\nThe Eddington number for cycling is analogous to the [[h-index|''h''-index]] that quantifies both the actual scientific productivity and the apparent scientific impact of a scientist.\n\nThe Eddington Number for cycling involves units of both distance and time<!--(indeed applying it to any physical property will result in E having units)-->.  For example, an E of 62 means a cyclist has covered 62 or more miles on 62 or more days. 62 miles is the same distance as 100&nbsp;km. However, it is possible that the cyclist, while having covered 100&nbsp;km on 62 days or more, may '''not''' have covered 100&nbsp;km on 100 days or more. Thus the order of bicyclists may change depending on units used. Using the original miles, one cyclist may have an Eddington number of 60 \u2013 60 miles (97&nbsp;km) in 60 days, another of 50 (corresponding to 80&nbsp;km). However, the latter may be a regular on a distance like this and get a km-Eddington of 80, while the former only had those 60 days riding, and thus stays at a km-Eddington of 60.\n\n==Philosophy==\n\n===Idealism===\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2016}}\nEddington wrote in his book ''The Nature of the Physical World'' that  \"The stuff of the world is mind-stuff.\"\n{{quote|The mind-stuff of the world is, of course, something more general than our individual conscious minds ... The mind-stuff is not spread in space and time; these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it ... It is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed, has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness ... Consciousness is not sharply defined, but fades into subconsciousness; and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature ... It is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character. But no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience, and all else is remote inference.|Eddington, ''The Nature of the Physical World'', 276\u201381.}}\n\nThe [[idealist]] conclusion was not integral to his epistemology but was based on two main arguments.\n\nThe first derives directly from current physical theory. Briefly, mechanical theories of the ether and of the behaviour of fundamental particles have been discarded in both relativity and quantum physics. From this, Eddington inferred that a materialistic metaphysics was outmoded and that, in consequence, since the disjunction of materialism or idealism are assumed to be exhaustive, an idealistic metaphysics is required. The second, and more interesting argument, was based on Eddington's epistemology, and may be regarded as consisting of two parts. First, all we know of the objective world is its structure, and the structure of the objective world is precisely mirrored in our own consciousness. We therefore have no reason to doubt that the objective world too is \"mind-stuff\". Dualistic metaphysics, then, cannot be evidentially supported.\n\nBut, second, not only can we not know that the objective world is nonmentalistic, we also cannot intelligibly suppose that it could be material. To conceive of a dualism entails attributing material properties to the objective world. However, this presupposes that we could observe that the objective world has material properties. But this is absurd, for whatever is observed must ultimately be the content of our own consciousness, and consequently, nonmaterial.\n\n[[Ian Barbour]], in his book ''Issues in Science and Religion'' (1966), p.&nbsp;133, cites Eddington's ''The Nature of the Physical World'' (1928) for a text that argues the [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] [[Uncertainty principle|Uncertainty Principles]] provides a scientific basis for \"the defense of the idea of human freedom\" and his ''Science and the Unseen World'' (1929) for support of [[philosophical idealism]] \"the thesis that reality is basically mental\".\n\n[[Charles De Koninck]] points out that Eddington believed in objective reality existing apart from our minds, but was using the phrase \"mind-stuff\" to highlight the inherent [[intelligibility (philosophy)|intelligibility]] of the world: that our minds and the physical world are made of the same \"stuff\" and that our minds are the inescapable connection to the world.<ref name=\"de Koninck\">{{Cite book\n| publisher = University of Notre Dame Press\n| isbn = 978-0-268-02595-3\n| last = de Koninck\n| first = Charles\n| authorlink=Charles De Koninck\n| title = The writings of Charles de Koninck\n| location = Notre Dame, Ind.\n| date = 2008\n| oclc = 615199716\n| chapter = The philosophy of Sir Arthur Eddington and The problem of indeterminism\n}}</ref> As De Koninck quotes Eddington,\n\n{{quote|There is a doctrine well known to philosophers that the moon ceases to exist when no one is looking at it. I will not discuss the doctrine since I have not the least idea what is the meaning of the word existence when used in this connection. At any rate the science of astronomy has not been based on this spasmodic kind of moon. In the scientific world (which has to fulfill functions less vague than merely existing) there is a moon which appeared on the scene before the astronomer; it reflects sunlight when no one sees it; it has mass when no one is measuring the mass; it is distant 240,000 miles from the earth when no one is surveying the distance; and it will eclipse the sun in 1999 even if the human race has succeeded in killing itself off before that date.|Eddington, ''The Nature of the Physical World'', 226}}\n\n===Indeterminism===\n{{see also|Indeterminism|Indeterminism#Science|label 2=Indeterminism in science}}\nAgainst [[Albert Einstein]] and others who advocated [[determinism]], indeterminism\u2014championed by Eddington<ref name=\"de Koninck\"/>\u2014says that a physical object has an [[ontology|ontologically]] undetermined component that is not due to the [[epistemology|epistemological]] limitations of physicists' understanding. The [[uncertainty principle]] in [[quantum mechanics]], then, would not necessarily be due to [[Hidden variable theory|hidden variables]] but to an indeterminism in nature itself.\n\n==Popular and philosophical writings==\n\nEddington wrote a parody of ''[[The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'', recounting his 1919 solar eclipse experiment. It contained the following [[quatrain]]:<ref>{{cite book |title=The Life of Arthur Eddington |first=A.

Many of these were gathered into books, including ''The Nature of the Physical World'' and ''New Pathways in Science''. His use of literary allusions and humour helped make these difficult subjects more accessible.\n\nEddington's books and lectures were immensely popular with the public, not only because of his clear exposition, but also for his willingness to discuss the philosophical and religious implications of the new physics. He argued for a deeply rooted philosophical harmony between scientific investigation and religious mysticism, and also that the positivist nature of relativity and quantum physics provided new room for personal religious experience and free will. Unlike many other spiritual scientists, he rejected the idea that science could provide proof of religious propositions.\n\nHe is sometimes misunderstood{{by whom|date=August 2019}} as having promoted the [[infinite monkey theorem]] in his 1928 book ''The Nature of the Physical World'', with the phrase \"If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters, they might write all the books in the [[British Museum]]\". It is clear from the context that Eddington is not suggesting that the probability of this happening is worthy of serious consideration. On the contrary, it was a [[rhetorical]] illustration of the fact that below certain levels of probability, the term ''improbable'' is functionally equivalent to ''impossible''.\n\nHis popular writings made him a household name in Great Britain between the world wars.\n\n==Death==\nEddington died of cancer in the [[Nuffield Health Cambridge Hospital|Evelyn Nursing Home]], Cambridge, on 22 November 1944.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=okRzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT320&lpg=PT320&dq=Eddington+Evelyn+Nursing+Home,+Cambridge,+on+22+November+1944.#v=onepage&q=Eddington%20Evelyn%20Nursing%20Home%2C%20Cambridge%2C%20on%2022%20November%201944.&f=false |title=Proving Einstein Right: The Daring Expeditions that Changed How We Look at the Universe|first1= S.

[[World War I]] had severed many lines of scientific communication, and new developments in German science were not well known in England. He also conducted [[Eddington experiment|an expedition]] to observe the [[solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]] that provided one of the earliest confirmations of [[general relativity]], and he became known for his popular expositions and interpretations of the theory.\n\n==Early years==\nEddington was born 28 December 1882 in [[Kendal]], [[Westmorland]] (now [[Cumbria]]), England, the son of [[Quaker]] parents, Arthur Henry Eddington, headmaster of the Quaker School, and Sarah Ann Shout.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783\u20132002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref>\n\nHis father taught at a Quaker training college in Lancashire before moving to Kendal to become headmaster of Stramongate School. He died in the [[typhoid]] epidemic which swept England in 1884. His mother was left to bring up her two children with relatively little income. The family moved to [[Weston-super-Mare]] where at first Stanley (as his mother and sister always called Eddington) was educated at home before spending three years at a preparatory school.  The family lived at a house called Varzin, 42 Walliscote Road, Weston-super-Mare.  There is a commemorative plaque on the building explaining Sir Arthur's contribution to science.\n\nIn 1893 Eddington entered Brynmelyn School. He proved to be a most capable scholar, particularly in mathematics and English literature. His performance earned him a scholarship to Owens College, Manchester (what was later to become the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]]) in 1898, which he was able to attend, having turned 16 that year. He spent the first year in a general course, but turned to [[physics]] for the next three years. Eddington was greatly influenced by his physics and mathematics teachers, [[Arthur Schuster]] and [[Horace Lamb]]. At Manchester, Eddington lived at Dalton Hall, where he came under the lasting influence of the Quaker mathematician J. W. Graham. His progress was rapid, winning him several scholarships and he graduated with a BSc in physics with First Class Honours in 1902.\n\nBased on his performance at Owens College, he was awarded a scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1902. His tutor at Cambridge was [[Robert Alfred Herman]] and in 1904 Eddington became the first ever second-year student to be placed as [[Senior Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Senior Wrangler]].  After receiving his M.A. in 1905, he began research on [[thermionic emission]] in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]. This did not go well, and meanwhile he spent time teaching mathematics to first year engineering students. This hiatus was brief. Through a recommendation by [[E. T. Whittaker]], his senior colleague at Trinity College, he secured a position at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich where he was to embark on his career in astronomy, a career whose seeds had been sown even as a young child when he would often \"try to count the stars\".<ref name=Douglas1956 />\n[[File:Arthur Eddington.jpg|thumb|260x260px|Plaque at 42 Walliscote Road, Weston-super-Mare]]\n\n==Astronomy==\n\nIn January 1906, Eddington was nominated to the post of chief assistant to the [[Astronomer Royal]] at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]]. He left Cambridge for Greenwich the following month. He was put to work on a detailed analysis of the [[parallax]] of [[433 Eros]] on [[photographic plate]]s that had started in 1900. He developed a new statistical method based on the apparent drift of two background stars, winning him the [[Smith's Prize]] in 1907. The prize won him a Fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge. In December 1912 [[George Darwin]], son of [[Charles Darwin]], died suddenly and Eddington was promoted to his chair as the [[Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy]] in early 1913. Later that year, [[Robert Stawell Ball|Robert Ball]], holder of the theoretical [[Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry|Lowndean chair]] also died, and Eddington was named the director of the entire [[Cambridge Observatory]] the next year. In May 1914 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]: he was awarded the [[Royal Medal]] in 1928 and delivered the [[Bakerian Lecture]] in 1926.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27eddington%27%29| title = Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher = Royal Society| accessdate=29 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nEddington also investigated the interior of [[star]]s through theory, and developed the first true understanding of stellar processes. He began this in 1916 with investigations of possible physical explanations for [[Cepheid variables|Cepheid variable stars]].  He began by extending [[Karl Schwarzschild]]'s earlier work on radiation pressure in [[Lane-Emden equation|Emden polytropic models]]. These models treated a star as a sphere of gas held up against gravity by internal thermal pressure, and one of Eddington's chief additions was to show that radiation pressure was necessary to prevent collapse of the sphere. He developed his model despite knowingly lacking firm foundations for understanding opacity and energy generation in the stellar interior. However, his results allowed for calculation of temperature, [[density]] and [[pressure]] at all points inside a star (thermodynamic anisotropy), and Eddington argued that his theory was so useful for further astrophysical investigation that it should be retained despite not being based on completely accepted physics. [[James Jeans]] contributed the important suggestion that stellar matter would certainly be [[Ionization|ionized]], but that was the end of any collaboration between the pair, who became famous for their lively debates.\n\nEddington defended his method by pointing to the utility of his results, particularly his important [[mass-luminosity relation]]. This had the unexpected result of showing that virtually all stars, including giants and dwarfs, behaved as [[ideal gases]].  In the process of developing his stellar models, he sought to overturn current thinking about the sources of stellar energy. Jeans and others defended the [[Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz mechanism]], which was based on classical mechanics, while Eddington speculated broadly about the qualitative and quantitative consequences of possible proton-electron annihilation and nuclear fusion processes.\n\nAround 1920, he anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars, in his paper ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars''.<ref name=eddington/><ref name=eddington2/> At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to Einstein's equation ''E = mc<sup>2</sup>''. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even the fact that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered. Eddington's paper, based on knowledge at the time, reasoned that:\n\n:# The leading theory of stellar energy, the [[contraction hypothesis]], should cause stars' rotation to visibly speed up due to [[conservation of angular momentum]]. But observations of [[Cepheid]] variable stars showed this was not happening.\n:# The only other known plausible source of energy was conversion of matter to energy; Einstein had shown some years earlier that a small amount of matter was equivalent to a large amount of energy. \n:# [[Francis William Aston|Francis Aston]] had also recently shown that the mass of a [[helium]] atom was about 0.8% less than the mass of the four hydrogen atoms which would, combined, form a helium atom, suggesting that if such a combination could happen, it would release considerable energy as a byproduct.\n:# If a star contained just 5% of fusible hydrogen, it would suffice to explain how stars got their energy. (We now know that most 'ordinary' stars contain far more than 5% hydrogen)\n:# Further elements might also be fused, and other scientists had speculated that stars were the \"crucible\" in which light elements combined to create heavy elements, but without more accurate measurements of their [[atomic mass]]es nothing more could be said at the time.\n\nAll of these speculations were proven correct in the following decades.\n\nWith these assumptions, he demonstrated that the interior temperature of stars must be millions of degrees. In 1924, he discovered the [[Main sequence|mass-luminosity relation]] for [[star]]s (see Lecchini in [[#External links and references]] ).  Despite some disagreement, Eddington's models were eventually accepted as a powerful tool for further investigation, particularly in issues of stellar evolution.  The confirmation of his estimated stellar diameters by Michelson in 1920 proved crucial in convincing astronomers unused to Eddington's intuitive, exploratory style. Eddington's theory appeared in mature form in 1926 as ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars'', which became an important text for training an entire generation of astrophysicists.\n\nEddington's work in astrophysics in the late 1920s and the 1930s continued his work in stellar structure, and precipitated further clashes with Jeans and [[Edward Arthur Milne]]. An important topic was the extension of his models to take advantage of developments in [[quantum physics]], including the use of degeneracy physics in describing dwarf stars.\n\n===Dispute with Chandrasekhar on existence of black holes===\n\nThe topic of extension of his models precipitated his dispute with [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]], who was then a student at Cambridge. Chandrasekhar's work presaged the discovery of [[black hole]]s, which at the time seemed so absurdly non-physical that Eddington refused to believe that Chandrasekhar's purely mathematical derivation had consequences for the real world. Eddington was wrong and his motivation is controversial. Chandrasekhar's narrative of this incident, in which his work is harshly rejected, portrays Eddington as rather cruel, dogmatic, and racist.  Eddington's criticism seems to have been based on a suspicion that a purely mathematical derivation from relativity theory was not enough to explain the seemingly daunting physical paradoxes that were inherent to degenerate stars.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Padmanabhan | first1 = T.\n| title = The dark side of astronomy\n| doi = 10.1038/435020a\n| journal = Nature\n| volume = 435\n| issue = 7038\n| pages = 20\u201321\n| year = 2005\n|bibcode = 2005Natur.435...20P }}</ref>\n\n==Relativity==\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Eddington was Secretary of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]], which meant he was the first to receive a series of letters and papers from [[Willem de Sitter]] regarding Einstein's theory of general relativity.

He quickly became the chief supporter and expositor of relativity in Britain. He and [[Astronomer Royal]] [[Frank Watson Dyson]] organized [[Eddington experiment|two expeditions]] to observe a [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse in 1919]] to make the first empirical test of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory: the measurement of the deflection of light by the sun's gravitational field. In fact, Dyson's argument for the indispensability of Eddington's expertise in this test was what prevented Eddington from eventually having to enter military service.<ref name=Douglas1956 /><ref name=Chandrasekhar1983 />\n\nWhen conscription was introduced in Britain on 2 March 1916, Eddington intended to apply for an exemption as a [[conscientious objector]].<ref name=Douglas1956 /> Cambridge University authorities instead requested and were granted an exemption on the ground of Eddington's work being of national interest. In 1918, this was appealed against by the [[Ministry of National Service]]. Before the appeal tribunal in June, Eddington claimed conscientious objector status, which was not recognized and would have ended his exemption in August 1918. A further two hearings took place in June and July, respectively. Eddington's personal statement at the June hearing about his objection to war based on religious grounds is on record.<ref name=Douglas1956 /> [[Astronomer Royal]], [[Sir Frank Dyson]], supported Eddington at the July hearing with a written statement, emphasising Eddington's essential role in the [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse]] expedition to [[Pr\u00edncipe]] in May 1919. Eddington made clear his willingness to serve in the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]], under the jurisdiction of the British  [[Red Cross]], or as a harvest labourer. However, the tribunal's decision to grant a further twelve months exemption from military service was on condition of Eddington continuing his astronomy work, in particular in preparation for the Pr\u00edncipe expedition.<ref name=Douglas1956 /><ref name=Chandrasekhar1983 /> The war ended before the end of his exemption.\n\n[[File:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|260px|thumb|right|One of Eddington's photographs of the total [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]], presented in his 1920 paper announcing its success, confirming [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory that light \"bends\"]]\nAfter the war, Eddington travelled to the island of Pr\u00edncipe off the west coast of Africa to watch the [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]]. During the eclipse, he took pictures of the stars (several stars in the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades cluster]] include [[Kappa Tauri]] of the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]) in the region around the Sun.<ref name=\"Eddington1920\"/> According to the theory of [[general relativity]], stars with light rays that passed near the Sun would appear to have been slightly shifted because their light had been curved by its gravitational field. This effect is noticeable only during eclipses, since otherwise the Sun's brightness obscures the affected stars. Eddington showed that Newtonian gravitation could be interpreted to predict half the shift predicted by Einstein.\n\nEddington's observations published the next year<ref name=\"Eddington1920\">{{cite journal|last=Dyson|author2=Eddington, A.S.|author3=Davidson, C.R. |date=1920 |title=A Determination of the Deflection of Light by the Sun's Gravitational Field, from Observations Made at the Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|Phil.

They include the line \"A general discussion followed. The President remarked that the 83rd meeting was historic\".]]\n\nThroughout this period, Eddington lectured on relativity, and was particularly well known for his ability to explain the concepts in lay terms as well as scientific. He collected many of these into the ''Mathematical Theory of Relativity'' in 1923, which [[Albert Einstein]] suggested was \"the finest presentation of the subject in any language.\" He was an early advocate of Einstein's General Relativity, and an interesting anecdote well illustrates his humour and personal intellectual investment: [[Ludwik Silberstein]], a physicist who thought of himself as an expert on relativity, approached Eddington at the [[Royal Society]]'s (6 November) 1919 meeting where he had defended Einstein's Relativity with his Brazil-Pr\u00edncipe Solar Eclipse calculations with some degree of skepticism, and ruefully charged Arthur as one who claimed to be one of three men who actually understood the theory (Silberstein, of course, was including himself and Einstein as the other). When Eddington refrained from replying, he insisted Arthur not be \"so shy\", whereupon Eddington replied, \"Oh, no! I was wondering who the third one might be!\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">As related by Eddington to Chandrasekhar and quoted in Walter Isaacson \"Einstein: His Life and Universe\", page 262</ref>\n\n==Cosmology==\nEddington was also heavily involved with the development of the first generation of general relativistic cosmological models. He had been investigating the instability of the Einstein universe when he learned of both [[Georges Lema\u00eetre|Lema\u00eetre's]] 1927 paper postulating an expanding or contracting universe and Hubble's work on the recession of the spiral nebulae. He felt the [[cosmological constant]] must have played the crucial role in the universe's evolution from an Einsteinian steady state to its current expanding state, and most of his cosmological investigations focused on the constant's significance and characteristics.  In ''The Mathematical Theory of Relativity,'' Eddington interpreted the cosmological constant to mean that the universe is \"self-gauging\".\n\n==Fundamental theory and the Eddington number==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Chandrasekhar limit]] & redirect [[Fundamental theory (Eddington)]] -->\nDuring the 1920s until his death, Eddington increasingly concentrated on what he called \"[[Classical unified field theories#Eddington's affine geometry|fundamental theory]]\" which was intended to be a unification of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], [[theory of relativity|relativity]], cosmology, and [[gravitation]]. At first he progressed along \"traditional\" lines, but turned increasingly to an almost [[numerology|numerological]] analysis of the dimensionless ratios of fundamental constants.\n\nHis basic approach was to combine several fundamental constants in order to produce a dimensionless number. In many cases these would result in numbers close to 10<sup>40</sup>, its square, or its square root. He was convinced that the mass of the [[proton]] and the charge of the [[electron]] were a ''natural and complete specification for constructing a Universe'' and that their values were not accidental. One of the discoverers of quantum mechanics, [[Paul Dirac]], also pursued this line of investigation, which has become known as the [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis]], and some scientists even today believe it has something to it.{{Citation needed|reason=Which scientists? What is the 'something'?|date=December 2016}}\n\nA somewhat damaging statement in his defence of these concepts involved the [[fine structure constant]], \u03b1. At the time it was measured to be very close to 1/136, and he argued that the value should in fact be exactly 1/136 for epistemological reasons. Later measurements placed the value much closer to 1/137, at which point he switched his line of reasoning to argue that one more should be added to the [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], so that the value should in fact be exactly 1/137, the [[Eddington number]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Whittaker|first=Edmund|date=1945|title=Eddington's Theory of the Constants of Nature|journal=The Mathematical Gazette|volume=29|issue=286|pages=137\u2013144|doi=10.2307/3609461|jstor=3609461}}</ref> Wags at the time started calling him \"Arthur Adding-one\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Kean, Sam|title=The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements|year=2010|location=New York|publisher=Little, Brown and Co|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cky2x4wWvEUC&pg=PT241&lpg=PT241|isbn=9780316089081}}</ref> This change of stance detracted from Eddington's credibility in the physics community. The [http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?alphinv|search_for=fine+structure+constant current measured value] is estimated at 1/137.035 999 074(44).\n\nEddington believed he had identified an algebraic basis for fundamental physics, which he termed \"E-numbers\" (representing a certain [[group (mathematics)|group]]&nbsp;\u2013 a [[Clifford algebra]]). These in effect incorporated [[spacetime]] into a higher-dimensional structure. While his theory has long been neglected by the general physics community, similar algebraic notions underlie many modern attempts at a [[grand unified theory]]. Moreover, Eddington's emphasis on the values of the fundamental constants, and specifically upon dimensionless numbers derived from them, is nowadays a central concern of physics. In particular, he predicted a number of hydrogen atoms in the Universe 136 \u00d7 2<sup>256</sup>, or equivalently the half of the total number of particles protons + electrons.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barrow |first=J.

The Eddington number in the context of cycling is defined as the maximum number E such that the cyclist has cycled E miles on E days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://physicsworldarchive.iop.org/index.cfm?action=summary&doc=18/11/phwv18i11a30@pwa-xml&qt=|title=Physics World - IOPscience|website=physicsworldarchive.iop.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tlatet.blogspot.com/2008/03/eddington-number.html|title=Eddington number|date=16 March 2008}}</ref> For example, an Eddington number of 70 would imply that the cyclist has cycled at least 70 miles in a day on 70 occasions. Achieving a high Eddington number is difficult since moving from, say, 70 to 75 will probably require more than five new long distance rides, since any rides shorter than 75 miles will no longer be included in the reckoning. Eddington's own E-number was 84.<ref>Physics World (Institute of Physics) July 2012 page 15</ref>\n\nThe Eddington number for cycling is analogous to the [[h-index|''h''-index]] that quantifies both the actual scientific productivity and the apparent scientific impact of a scientist.\n\nThe Eddington Number for cycling involves units of both distance and time<!--(indeed applying it to any physical property will result in E having units)-->.  For example, an E of 62 means a cyclist has covered 62 or more miles on 62 or more days. 62 miles is the same distance as 100&nbsp;km. However, it is possible that the cyclist, while having covered 100&nbsp;km on 62 days or more, may '''not''' have covered 100&nbsp;km on 100 days or more. Thus the order of bicyclists may change depending on units used. Using the original miles, one cyclist may have an Eddington number of 60 \u2013 60 miles (97&nbsp;km) in 60 days, another of 50 (corresponding to 80&nbsp;km). However, the latter may be a regular on a distance like this and get a km-Eddington of 80, while the former only had those 60 days riding, and thus stays at a km-Eddington of 60.\n\n==Philosophy==\n\n===Idealism===\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2016}}\nEddington wrote in his book ''The Nature of the Physical World'' that  \"The stuff of the world is mind-stuff.\"\n{{quote|The mind-stuff of the world is, of course, something more general than our individual conscious minds ... The mind-stuff is not spread in space and time; these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it ... It is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed, has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness ... Consciousness is not sharply defined, but fades into subconsciousness; and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature ... It is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character. But no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience, and all else is remote inference.|Eddington, ''The Nature of the Physical World'', 276\u201381.}}\n\nThe [[idealist]] conclusion was not integral to his epistemology but was based on two main arguments.\n\nThe first derives directly from current physical theory. Briefly, mechanical theories of the ether and of the behaviour of fundamental particles have been discarded in both relativity and quantum physics. From this, Eddington inferred that a materialistic metaphysics was outmoded and that, in consequence, since the disjunction of materialism or idealism are assumed to be exhaustive, an idealistic metaphysics is required. The second, and more interesting argument, was based on Eddington's epistemology, and may be regarded as consisting of two parts. First, all we know of the objective world is its structure, and the structure of the objective world is precisely mirrored in our own consciousness. We therefore have no reason to doubt that the objective world too is \"mind-stuff\". Dualistic metaphysics, then, cannot be evidentially supported.\n\nBut, second, not only can we not know that the objective world is nonmentalistic, we also cannot intelligibly suppose that it could be material. To conceive of a dualism entails attributing material properties to the objective world. However, this presupposes that we could observe that the objective world has material properties. But this is absurd, for whatever is observed must ultimately be the content of our own consciousness, and consequently, nonmaterial.\n\n[[Ian Barbour]], in his book ''Issues in Science and Religion'' (1966), p.&nbsp;133, cites Eddington's ''The Nature of the Physical World'' (1928) for a text that argues the [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] [[Uncertainty principle|Uncertainty Principles]] provides a scientific basis for \"the defense of the idea of human freedom\" and his ''Science and the Unseen World'' (1929) for support of [[philosophical idealism]] \"the thesis that reality is basically mental\".\n\n[[Charles De Koninck]] points out that Eddington believed in objective reality existing apart from our minds, but was using the phrase \"mind-stuff\" to highlight the inherent [[intelligibility (philosophy)|intelligibility]] of the world: that our minds and the physical world are made of the same \"stuff\" and that our minds are the inescapable connection to the world.<ref name=\"de Koninck\">{{Cite book\n| publisher = University of Notre Dame Press\n| isbn = 978-0-268-02595-3\n| last = de Koninck\n| first = Charles\n| authorlink=Charles De Koninck\n| title = The writings of Charles de Koninck\n| location = Notre Dame, Ind.\n| date = 2008\n| oclc = 615199716\n| chapter = The philosophy of Sir Arthur Eddington and The problem of indeterminism\n}}</ref> As De Koninck quotes Eddington,\n\n{{quote|There is a doctrine well known to philosophers that the moon ceases to exist when no one is looking at it. I will not discuss the doctrine since I have not the least idea what is the meaning of the word existence when used in this connection. At any rate the science of astronomy has not been based on this spasmodic kind of moon. In the scientific world (which has to fulfill functions less vague than merely existing) there is a moon which appeared on the scene before the astronomer; it reflects sunlight when no one sees it; it has mass when no one is measuring the mass; it is distant 240,000 miles from the earth when no one is surveying the distance; and it will eclipse the sun in 1999 even if the human race has succeeded in killing itself off before that date.|Eddington, ''The Nature of the Physical World'', 226}}\n\n===Indeterminism===\n{{see also|Indeterminism|Indeterminism#Science|label 2=Indeterminism in science}}\nAgainst [[Albert Einstein]] and others who advocated [[determinism]], indeterminism\u2014championed by Eddington<ref name=\"de Koninck\"/>\u2014says that a physical object has an [[ontology|ontologically]] undetermined component that is not due to the [[epistemology|epistemological]] limitations of physicists' understanding. The [[uncertainty principle]] in [[quantum mechanics]], then, would not necessarily be due to [[Hidden variable theory|hidden variables]] but to an indeterminism in nature itself.\n\n==Popular and philosophical writings==\n\nEddington wrote a parody of ''[[The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'', recounting his 1919 solar eclipse experiment. It contained the following [[quatrain]]:<ref>{{cite book |title=The Life of Arthur Eddington |first=A. Vibert |last=Douglas |page=44 |publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons |year=1956 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bw0XAQAAMAAJ }}</ref>\n<center>\n{{poemquote|\nOh leave the Wise our measures to collate\n           One thing at least is certain, LIGHT has WEIGHT,\nOne thing is certain, and the rest debate\u2014\nLight-rays, when near the Sun, DO NOT GO STRAIGHT.}}\n</center>\nDuring the 1920s and 30s, Eddington gave numerous lectures, interviews, and radio broadcasts on relativity, in addition to his textbook ''[[List of publications in physics#The Mathematical Theory of Relativity|The Mathematical Theory of Relativity]]'', and later, quantum mechanics. Many of these were gathered into books, including ''The Nature of the Physical World'' and ''New Pathways in Science''. His use of literary allusions and humour helped make these difficult subjects more accessible.\n\nEddington's books and lectures were immensely popular with the public, not only because of his clear exposition, but also for his willingness to discuss the philosophical and religious implications of the new physics. He argued for a deeply rooted philosophical harmony between scientific investigation and religious mysticism, and also that the positivist nature of relativity and quantum physics provided new room for personal religious experience and free will. Unlike many other spiritual scientists, he rejected the idea that science could provide proof of religious propositions.\n\nHe is sometimes misunderstood{{by whom|date=August 2019}} as having promoted the [[infinite monkey theorem]] in his 1928 book ''The Nature of the Physical World'', with the phrase \"If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters, they might write all the books in the [[British Museum]]\". It is clear from the context that Eddington is not suggesting that the probability of this happening is worthy of serious consideration. On the contrary, it was a [[rhetorical]] illustration of the fact that below certain levels of probability, the term ''improbable'' is functionally equivalent to ''impossible''.\n\nHis popular writings made him a household name in Great Britain between the world wars.\n\n==Death==\nEddington died of cancer in the [[Nuffield Health Cambridge Hospital|Evelyn Nursing Home]], Cambridge, on 22 November 1944.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=okRzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT320&lpg=PT320&dq=Eddington+Evelyn+Nursing+Home,+Cambridge,+on+22+November+1944.#v=onepage&q=Eddington%20Evelyn%20Nursing%20Home%2C%20Cambridge%2C%20on%2022%20November%201944.&f=false |title=Proving Einstein Right: The Daring Expeditions that Changed How We Look at the Universe|first1= S.

She did her schooling at Sarada Ashrama Balika Bidyalaya, Kolkata, and completed her higher secondary from [[Sakhawat Memorial Govt. Girls High School]], Kolkata in 1992. With a strong passion and high proficiency for mathematics, she joined [[Bethune College]], [[University of Calcutta]] to obtain a Bachelor of Science with honours in Mathematics. Subsequently, she joined the prominent Applied Mathematics department of the [[Rajabazar Science College]], University of Calcutta, where she pursued her interests in quantum and statistical physics. She received her Masters degree in 1997, and after a short period of research work in India, moved to [[Gdansk]], [[Poland]] to work with [[Marek \u017bukowski]] at the [[University of Gdansk]], where she received her PhD in January 2004. Following her doctoral studies she moved to [[Hannover]], [[Germany]] as a [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation|Humboldt Research Fellow]] to work with [[Maciej Lewenstein]] at the [[Leibniz University]]. Thereafter, she joined [[ICFO - The Institute of Photonic Sciences]] at [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]] to continue her research on quantum information theory, condensed matter and statistical physics. She won the prestigious Ram\u00f3n y Cajal research fellowship during her time in Spain. Upon returning to [[India]] in 2008, she briefly joined the School of Physical Sciences at [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]] as an Assistant Professor in Physics, before moving to [[Harish-Chandra Research Institute]],  Allahabad in 2009, where she is currently a Professor in Physics<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hri.res.in/~aditi/res_exp.html|title=Aditi HomePage|website=www.hri.res.in}}</ref>. Aditi De has published more than 100 research articles in eminent peer-reviewed journals, and has also collaborated with several world-renowned physicists.\n\nShe is married to fellow physicist Ujjwal Sen, who is also a Professor of Physics at [[Harish-Chandra Research Institute]] in [[Allahabad]], [[India]].\n\n== Research ==\n\nDe started her research in the field of quantum information theory during her postgraduate studies in Kolkata, and went on obtain her doctorate in 2004 at the [[University of Gdansk]]. The field of quantum information and computation was still in its early days, and [[Gdansk]], [[Poland]] was one of the main research centres in the world, where important work on the theory of [[quantum entanglement]] was being done. In collaboration with her supervisor [[Marek \u017bukowski]], and other eminent physicists such as [[Ryszard Horodecki]], [[Pawe\u0142 Horodecki]], [[Micha\u0142 Horodecki]] and her husband, Ujjwal Sen, she worked on some fundamental problems on entanglement theory, quantum cryptography and quantum communication. After her stint in Gdansk, she joined the group of [[Maciej Lewenstein]] in Hannover, Germany and later in [[ICFO - The Institute of Photonic Sciences]] in Castelldefels near [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], where she spend a considerable period of her early research career. During this period, De consolidated her research on quantum information, while contributing heavily to new research directions that were opening in the interface of quantum information and many-body quantum physics. In particular, her research focused on the study of quantum phase transitions using entanglement as a key figure of merit. After a brief stint as a faculty member in [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]], De moved to [[Harish-Chandra Research Institute]] in [[Allahabad]], where along with physicists Ujjwal Sen and [[Arun K. Pati|Arun Kumar Pati]], she started the Quantum Information and Computation group<ref name=\"qic\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hri.res.in/~qic/|title=QIC group|website=www.hri.res.in}}</ref> in 2009, under the Physics Division at the institute. Over the last few years, several young researchers have completed their doctoral as well as postdoctoral research at the group, resulting in more than 50 publications in well-known journals in physics. The group has also hosted several conferences and workshops, with participants and speakers from all around the world.\n\nIn recent years, De has contributed significantly to the understanding of [[quantum information]] and communication, in particular the formulation of a [[Quantum entanglement|computable entanglement measure]] and a novel density-matrix recursion method.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ssbprize.gov.in/Content/Detail.aspx?AID=545|title=Awardee Details: Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize|website=ssbprize.gov.in|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref> Her work also involves understanding the theory of [[quantum channel]]s, the security of [[quantum cryptography]] and quantification of [[quantum correlation]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hri.res.in/~aditi/Research%20interest.html|title=Research Interests: Aditi Sen De}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nThe Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded her the [[Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize]], one of the highest Indian science awards in 2018.<ref name=\"Bhatnagar\"/> She is the first women recipient of this Prize in the Physical Science category<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/52016-thats-the-ratio-of-male-female-scientists-who-win-prizes-why-are-the-numbers-so-far-apart-2059227.html|title='I Was the Only Woman in the Room': The Difficulty in Being a Female Scientist in India|website=News18|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>.

She is known for her research on [[quantum information]] and computation, quantum communication, quantum cryptography and many-body physics. The [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]], the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded her the [[Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology]] for her contributions to physical sciences in 2018.<ref name=\"Bhatnagar\">{{Cite web |url=http://ssbprize.gov.in/Content/Detail.aspx?AID=545 |title=Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize (SSB) for Science and Technology 2018 :Brief Profile of the Awardee|date=2018-10-01 |publisher=Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize}}</ref>\nShe is the first female [[physicist]] to be given this honour.\n\n== Life and career == \n\nAditi Sen De was born in Kolkata, India to Lakshmi Dey, a school teacher and Ajit Kumar Dey, a state-government employee. She did her schooling at Sarada Ashrama Balika Bidyalaya, Kolkata, and completed her higher secondary from [[Sakhawat Memorial Govt. Girls High School]], Kolkata in 1992. With a strong passion and high proficiency for mathematics, she joined [[Bethune College]], [[University of Calcutta]] to obtain a Bachelor of Science with honours in Mathematics. Subsequently, she joined the prominent Applied Mathematics department of the [[Rajabazar Science College]], University of Calcutta, where she pursued her interests in quantum and statistical physics. She received her Masters degree in 1997, and after a short period of research work in India, moved to [[Gdansk]], [[Poland]] to work with [[Marek \u017bukowski]] at the [[University of Gdansk]], where she received her PhD in January 2004. Following her doctoral studies she moved to [[Hannover]], [[Germany]] as a [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation|Humboldt Research Fellow]] to work with [[Maciej Lewenstein]] at the [[Leibniz University]]. Thereafter, she joined [[ICFO - The Institute of Photonic Sciences]] at [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]] to continue her research on quantum information theory, condensed matter and statistical physics. She won the prestigious Ram\u00f3n y Cajal research fellowship during her time in Spain. Upon returning to [[India]] in 2008, she briefly joined the School of Physical Sciences at [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]] as an Assistant Professor in Physics, before moving to [[Harish-Chandra Research Institute]],  Allahabad in 2009, where she is currently a Professor in Physics<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hri.res.in/~aditi/res_exp.html|title=Aditi HomePage|website=www.hri.res.in}}</ref>. Aditi De has published more than 100 research articles in eminent peer-reviewed journals, and has also collaborated with several world-renowned physicists.\n\nShe is married to fellow physicist Ujjwal Sen, who is also a Professor of Physics at [[Harish-Chandra Research Institute]] in [[Allahabad]], [[India]].\n\n== Research ==\n\nDe started her research in the field of quantum information theory during her postgraduate studies in Kolkata, and went on obtain her doctorate in 2004 at the [[University of Gdansk]]. The field of quantum information and computation was still in its early days, and [[Gdansk]], [[Poland]] was one of the main research centres in the world, where important work on the theory of [[quantum entanglement]] was being done. In collaboration with her supervisor [[Marek \u017bukowski]], and other eminent physicists such as [[Ryszard Horodecki]], [[Pawe\u0142 Horodecki]], [[Micha\u0142 Horodecki]] and her husband, Ujjwal Sen, she worked on some fundamental problems on entanglement theory, quantum cryptography and quantum communication. After her stint in Gdansk, she joined the group of [[Maciej Lewenstein]] in Hannover, Germany and later in [[ICFO - The Institute of Photonic Sciences]] in Castelldefels near [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], where she spend a considerable period of her early research career. During this period, De consolidated her research on quantum information, while contributing heavily to new research directions that were opening in the interface of quantum information and many-body quantum physics. In particular, her research focused on the study of quantum phase transitions using entanglement as a key figure of merit. After a brief stint as a faculty member in [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]], De moved to [[Harish-Chandra Research Institute]] in [[Allahabad]], where along with physicists Ujjwal Sen and [[Arun K. Pati|Arun Kumar Pati]], she started the Quantum Information and Computation group<ref name=\"qic\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hri.res.in/~qic/|title=QIC group|website=www.hri.res.in}}</ref> in 2009, under the Physics Division at the institute. Over the last few years, several young researchers have completed their doctoral as well as postdoctoral research at the group, resulting in more than 50 publications in well-known journals in physics. The group has also hosted several conferences and workshops, with participants and speakers from all around the world.\n\nIn recent years, De has contributed significantly to the understanding of [[quantum information]] and communication, in particular the formulation of a [[Quantum entanglement|computable entanglement measure]] and a novel density-matrix recursion method.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ssbprize.gov.in/Content/Detail.aspx?AID=545|title=Awardee Details: Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize|website=ssbprize.gov.in|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref> Her work also involves understanding the theory of [[quantum channel]]s, the security of [[quantum cryptography]] and quantification of [[quantum correlation]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hri.res.in/~aditi/Research%20interest.html|title=Research Interests: Aditi Sen De}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nThe Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded her the [[Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize]], one of the highest Indian science awards in 2018.<ref name=\"Bhatnagar\"/> She is the first women recipient of this Prize in the Physical Science category<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/52016-thats-the-ratio-of-male-female-scientists-who-win-prizes-why-are-the-numbers-so-far-apart-2059227.html|title='I Was the Only Woman in the Room': The Difficulty in Being a Female Scientist in India|website=News18|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>.
