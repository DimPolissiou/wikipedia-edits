It is produced by [[Bhushan Kumar]], [[Krishan Kumar (actor)|Krishan Kumar]] and Lizelle D'Souza under the banners [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]] and Remo D'Souza Entertainment. The film stars [[Varun Dhawan]], [[Shraddha Kapoor]], [[Prabhu Deva]] and [[Nora Fatehi]]. Its music is composed by [[Sachin\u2013Jigar]], [[Tanishk Bagchi]], [[Badshah (rapper)|Badshah]], [[Guru Randhawa]], Gurinder Seagal and Harsh Upadhyay, and released under the banner T-Series. The story explores a dance competition between some [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] dancers.\n\nOriginally planned as a sequel to Disney's ''[[ABCD 2]]'' (2015), the film was taken off the title due to Disney's exit from Indian film production, and was instead renamed to its current title after Bhushan Kumar took over as producer. Filming commenced in February 2019 in [[Punjab]], later moved to [[London]] and was wrapped up in July 2019. It was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nInder Singh Narula ([[Punit Pathak]]) is a dancer who is part of a dance team named Street Dancer. Inder is dancing at the Ground Zero Battle with his brother Sahej Singh Narula ([[Varun Dhawan]]) cheering for him and while doing a flip stunt, he lands on his leg and injures it. After two years, he is healing, but cannot dance. Sahej forms Street Dancer again and converts it into a studio through money whose sources he is hesitant about revealing. Poddy ([[Raghav Juyal]]), is one of Sahej's close friends, along with D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Sushi (Sushant Pujari), who are all part of Street Dancer. While showing the dance studio to the Street Dancer team, they run into Inayat ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) and her team, the Rule Breakers, dance as well. Sahej and Inayat have always been at standstills against each other and they have a dance battle. The Rule Breakers beat Street Dancer, embarrassing Sahej in the process. Inayat's cousin, Zain ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]), takes her home. Their family is very orthodox and Inayat lies about her dancing, hiding the truth from them. \n\nSahej visits the Royals, an all time, record-holding dance group that always wins the Ground Zero Competition. His girlfriend, Mia ([[Nora Fatehi]]) is on the team, and she is an incredible dancer. They discuss on how irritated Sahej is by Inayat, and she calms him down. Mia trains the Street Dancer gang, giving them the spark they wanted. The two gangs meet up in a restaurant for a cricket match between India (Sahej's team) and Pakistan (Inayat's team). India wins and this leads to a dance battle where Mia shows her moves. The police and the restaurant manager, Ram Prasad a.k.a. Anna ([[Prabhu Deva]]) control the fight. As they leave, Inayat sees some homeless people entering the restaurant from the back door. She follows them and meets Ram. He explains to her that these are illegal immigrants, and he feeds them food that isn't used. He takes her to an area where many illegal immigrants reside. He tells her that they can't go back to their home as they have no money. She gets emotional and begins to help them.\n\nOne day when Poddy reaches the dance studio, he sees Sahej being interrogated by the cop. Sahej reveals that when he went to India for his cousin's marriage, he met Amrinder Mehrotra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and his three other friends playing drum in the marriage. He was impressed by their talent. They request Sahej to take them to London which he denies. After they offer a huge amount of 40 lakhs he agrees to take them to London. That's how he got the money to buy the dance studio. Poddy promises to not tell it to anyone.\n\nThe Ground Zero Battle returns. Inder asks Sahej to participate and win it. Inayat decides to participate so that they can use the money to help the illegal immigrants and Ram supports her. The two gangs meet and Ram says that if they become one they can easily win the competition. But both of them deny the offer. Sahej impresses the Royals with his dance at a nightclub. He, D, Poddy and Sushi are selected for the Royals. The two gangs meet in the restaurant again. They have an argument, which ends up with Ram dancing, showcasing his ability to Sahej. Sahej, blinded by his ego, turns down the opportunity. Poddy is in a relationship with Alisha, a girl from Inayat's gang. He realises that Inayat's gang are participating in the Ground Zero Battle so that they can retrieve them the prize money  which is a hundred thousand pounds to help illegal immigrants and tells Sahej about it at the Royals dance studio. Sahej does not believe Poddy and a fight ensues between the both of them. This causes Poddy to leave the Royals and he decides to join the Rule Breakers. Inayat accepts Poddy into the team and other members of the Street Dancer team also feel left out as Sahej spends his time with the Royals. \n\nThe first round of the competition is easily surpassed by both the Royals and the Rule Breakers. As Sahej, D and Shushi gets into a bus, they run into Amrinder. Amrinder tells Sahej that after he dropped them off, they went to a hostel. Over there, all illegal immigrants were staying and they were chased by the police. Leaving his identity as a Sikh and his passport, he and the three Punjabi drummers joined the homeless people. Inayat's gang were dancing to help them. He asks Sahej for help but he leaves saying he does not know him.\n\nBoth teams surpass the quarter finals and enter into semi finals. Later, the Royals and Sahej are walking in London. They run into the drummers where the leader of the Royals accidentally breaks his drums. After seeing them, Sahej feels guilty of his deeds. In the semi final round, Sahej leaves the Royals and helps Inayat's gang win the round. He then quits the Royals, breaking Mia\u2019s heart, and forms Street Dancer again.\n\nMany practices occur, and then Inayat's family finds out about her dancing actions. They ban her from dancing, shocking the team. Sahej and Zain go to her house, and convince her family to let her dance. A relationship blossoms between Sahej and Inayat as they prepare for the final round of the Ground Zero Battle. The Royals perform and amazes the crowd. Street Dancer performs and in the middle of their dance, a member of the Royals take off the music. The host tells them that if there is no music, they cannot dance. Amrinder then uses his drums with his friends to make music for them to dance to. The leader of the Royals finds out that his team member took off the music and he asks to puts it back in, since he did not want to cheat. At the end of their dance, Sahej does the flip stunt, which got his brother injured, flawlessly. Making his brother and his country proud, Sahej gets Street Dancer to defeat the Royals and wins the competition, also earning the Royals\u2019 respect. In the end, Sahej and Inayat begin a friendship as they help the immigrants.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Varun Dhawan]] as Sahej Singh Narula, an aspiring dancer who follows his brother's footsteps.

The story explores a dance competition between some [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] dancers.\n\nOriginally planned as a sequel to Disney's ''[[ABCD 2]]'' (2015), the film was taken off the title due to Disney's exit from Indian film production, and was instead renamed to its current title after Bhushan Kumar took over as producer. Filming commenced in February 2019 in [[Punjab]], later moved to [[London]] and was wrapped up in July 2019. It was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nInder Singh Narula ([[Punit Pathak]]) is a dancer who is part of a dance team named Street Dancer. Inder is dancing at the Ground Zero Battle with his brother Sahej Singh Narula ([[Varun Dhawan]]) cheering for him and while doing a flip stunt, he lands on his leg and injures it. After two years, he is healing, but cannot dance. Sahej forms Street Dancer again and converts it into a studio through money whose sources he is hesitant about revealing. Poddy ([[Raghav Juyal]]), is one of Sahej's close friends, along with D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Sushi (Sushant Pujari), who are all part of Street Dancer. While showing the dance studio to the Street Dancer team, they run into Inayat ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) and her team, the Rule Breakers, dance as well. Sahej and Inayat have always been at standstills against each other and they have a dance battle. The Rule Breakers beat Street Dancer, embarrassing Sahej in the process. Inayat's cousin, Zain ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]), takes her home. Their family is very orthodox and Inayat lies about her dancing, hiding the truth from them. \n\nSahej visits the Royals, an all time, record-holding dance group that always wins the Ground Zero Competition. His girlfriend, Mia ([[Nora Fatehi]]) is on the team, and she is an incredible dancer. They discuss on how irritated Sahej is by Inayat, and she calms him down. Mia trains the Street Dancer gang, giving them the spark they wanted. The two gangs meet up in a restaurant for a cricket match between India (Sahej's team) and Pakistan (Inayat's team). India wins and this leads to a dance battle where Mia shows her moves. The police and the restaurant manager, Ram Prasad a.k.a. Anna ([[Prabhu Deva]]) control the fight. As they leave, Inayat sees some homeless people entering the restaurant from the back door. She follows them and meets Ram. He explains to her that these are illegal immigrants, and he feeds them food that isn't used. He takes her to an area where many illegal immigrants reside. He tells her that they can't go back to their home as they have no money. She gets emotional and begins to help them.\n\nOne day when Poddy reaches the dance studio, he sees Sahej being interrogated by the cop. Sahej reveals that when he went to India for his cousin's marriage, he met Amrinder Mehrotra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and his three other friends playing drum in the marriage. He was impressed by their talent. They request Sahej to take them to London which he denies. After they offer a huge amount of 40 lakhs he agrees to take them to London. That's how he got the money to buy the dance studio. Poddy promises to not tell it to anyone.\n\nThe Ground Zero Battle returns. Inder asks Sahej to participate and win it. Inayat decides to participate so that they can use the money to help the illegal immigrants and Ram supports her. The two gangs meet and Ram says that if they become one they can easily win the competition. But both of them deny the offer. Sahej impresses the Royals with his dance at a nightclub. He, D, Poddy and Sushi are selected for the Royals. The two gangs meet in the restaurant again. They have an argument, which ends up with Ram dancing, showcasing his ability to Sahej. Sahej, blinded by his ego, turns down the opportunity. Poddy is in a relationship with Alisha, a girl from Inayat's gang. He realises that Inayat's gang are participating in the Ground Zero Battle so that they can retrieve them the prize money  which is a hundred thousand pounds to help illegal immigrants and tells Sahej about it at the Royals dance studio. Sahej does not believe Poddy and a fight ensues between the both of them. This causes Poddy to leave the Royals and he decides to join the Rule Breakers. Inayat accepts Poddy into the team and other members of the Street Dancer team also feel left out as Sahej spends his time with the Royals. \n\nThe first round of the competition is easily surpassed by both the Royals and the Rule Breakers. As Sahej, D and Shushi gets into a bus, they run into Amrinder. Amrinder tells Sahej that after he dropped them off, they went to a hostel. Over there, all illegal immigrants were staying and they were chased by the police. Leaving his identity as a Sikh and his passport, he and the three Punjabi drummers joined the homeless people. Inayat's gang were dancing to help them. He asks Sahej for help but he leaves saying he does not know him.\n\nBoth teams surpass the quarter finals and enter into semi finals. Later, the Royals and Sahej are walking in London. They run into the drummers where the leader of the Royals accidentally breaks his drums. After seeing them, Sahej feels guilty of his deeds. In the semi final round, Sahej leaves the Royals and helps Inayat's gang win the round. He then quits the Royals, breaking Mia\u2019s heart, and forms Street Dancer again.\n\nMany practices occur, and then Inayat's family finds out about her dancing actions. They ban her from dancing, shocking the team. Sahej and Zain go to her house, and convince her family to let her dance. A relationship blossoms between Sahej and Inayat as they prepare for the final round of the Ground Zero Battle. The Royals perform and amazes the crowd. Street Dancer performs and in the middle of their dance, a member of the Royals take off the music. The host tells them that if there is no music, they cannot dance. Amrinder then uses his drums with his friends to make music for them to dance to. The leader of the Royals finds out that his team member took off the music and he asks to puts it back in, since he did not want to cheat. At the end of their dance, Sahej does the flip stunt, which got his brother injured, flawlessly. Making his brother and his country proud, Sahej gets Street Dancer to defeat the Royals and wins the competition, also earning the Royals\u2019 respect. In the end, Sahej and Inayat begin a friendship as they help the immigrants.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Varun Dhawan]] as Sahej Singh Narula, an aspiring dancer who follows his brother's footsteps.

IPL's trading window was extended up to 29 February 2012 to allow the team to purchase players. Pune was also allowed the compensation of playing 5 foreign players in the squad, subject to the consent of the other 8 franchises.

But just like in 2011, the team could not maintain the initial momentum and again won only two more matches that season, against defending champions [[Chennai Super Kings]] at home and Delhi Daredevils away. Midway through the season, Ganguly was sacked as captain and was dropped from the team due to lack of results, but was retained as mentor.<ref name=\"dada\"/> However, this decision was later reversed and he returned to the team as captain. For the home match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, Ganguly rested himself, with Steve Smith taking up the captaincy, but still, the team lost by 35 runs. Pune finished last that season with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches.\n\n===2013 season===\n{{Main|2013 Indian Premier League}}\nFor the 2013 season, Pune Warriors India retained Steve Smith, Tamim Iqbal, Marlon Samuels and Luke Wright but released Clarke, James Hopes, Callum Ferguson, Alfonso Thomas, Murali Kartik and Jesse Ryder. Ganguly announced his retirement from all forms of cricket in October 2012,<ref name=\"bye dada\">[http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/1757445/report-sourav-ganguly-quits-ipl-retires-from-all-forms-of-cricket Ganguly retires]</ref> leaving the franchise without a captain.

The franchise also swapped a player with the Delhi Daredevils, trading Nehra for [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] batsman [[Ross Taylor]].<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/604641.html Delhi swap Taylor for Pune's Nehra]</ref> Yuvraj also returned to the team following his recovery from cancer. Unfortunately for the franchise, Clarke, who was the frontrunner to lead the team, was ruled out of the entire season with a recurring back and hamstring injury, which was aggravated during the [[Australian cricket team in India in 2012\u201313|Australian tour of India]] held earlier.<ref>[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/205416-michael-clarke-out-for-10-weeks-pune-warriors-have-to-hunt-for-new-captain Michael Clarke ruled out of IPL 6, Pune Warriors have to hunt for new captain]</ref> On 28 March 2013, the franchise named Sri Lankan Test and ODI captain and all-rounder Angelo Mathews as the captain for the 2013 season<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/627151.html Angelo Mathews named Pune Warriors' captain]</ref> and also signed Australian batsman [[Aaron Finch]] as a replacement for Clarke.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ipl-pune/content/story/627230.html Finch to replace Clarke for Pune Warriors]</ref>\n\nThe team's performance in the 2013 season was pathetic and mirrored its performance in 2012 with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches, finishing 8th and second-last in the league. The only matches the team won were against [[Rajasthan Royals]] (home), Chennai Super Kings (away), Kolkata Knight Riders (away) and Delhi Daredevils (home). The Warriors were thoroughly humiliated in their away match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, courtesy [[Chris Gayle]]'s 175 not out off only 66 balls and later became the first team in the 2013 season to be knocked out of contention for the playoffs after a loss to Chennai Super Kings at home. Like the previous seasons, the main cause for the team's poor performance was their constant squandering of winning chances and the lack of balance in the side, with more than 30 players being used during the season. The team was the only IPL franchise to use three captains that season. Mathews was sacked as captain following a poor start by the Warriors in the tournament and his own poor form and was replaced by Taylor for the away match against Chennai Super Kings. Following this match, Taylor was also sacked as captain due to his poor form, in spite of the team winning in Chennai, and was replaced by Finch, who captained the Warriors for the rest of the season.\n\n===Second and final withdrawal from IPL===\nOn 21 May 2013, just two days after finishing its league campaign, Sahara withdrew Pune Warriors India from the IPL for the second time in three years.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> The reason, according to BCCI, was the encashing of the team's bank guarantee after Sahara defaulted on paying the entire franchise fee.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> BCCI sources said that Sahara paid 20% of the franchise fee in January 2013 and had promised to pay the remaining amount by 19 May 2013 but they failed to do so.<ref name=\"pune gone\">[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/208101-ipl-6-bcci-encashes-bank-guarantee-after-pune-warriors-fail-to-pay-franchisee-fee BCCI encashes bank guarantee after Pune Warriors fail to pay franchisee fee]</ref> But Sahara blamed BCCI for the decision to pull out the Pune franchise from the IPL.

Only from the 2012 season onwards did the team actually begin to play their home matches in Pune at the Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium, named after the Chairman of Sahara India Pariwar.

It was one of two new franchises added to the IPL for the [[2011 Indian Premier League|2011 season]], alongside the also-defunct [[Kochi Tuskers Kerala]].

Ganguly had been discarded by his former team [[Kolkata Knight Riders]] prior to the 2011 IPL auction and was not bought by any of the teams in the auction.<ref name=\"auction\"/>\n\nThe Warriors got off to a successful start in the 2011 Indian Premier League by defeating [[Kings XI Punjab]] and Kochi Tuskers Kerala at home. Following this successful start, however, the team's performance went downhill and they only won another 2 matches that season, which were against Kings XI Punjab and [[Deccan Chargers]], both away. Their final match of the season against Delhi Daredevils away was abandoned due to rain.<ref>[http://www.rediff.com/cricket/report/ipl-2011-delhi-end-at-bottom-after-washed-out-tie/20110521.htm Delhi end at bottom after washed out tie]</ref> Pune finished 9th and second-last that season with 4 wins, 9 losses and 1 no-result in 14 matches.\n\n===First withdrawal from IPL and return===\nSahara withdrew Pune Warriors India from the IPL along with the sponsorship of the Indian cricket team just hours before the 2012 IPL auction was about to start, providing a major blow to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the IPL, which was already reeling after the disbanding of Kochi Tuskers Kerala in late 2011.<ref name=\"withdraw\">{{cite web|title=Sahara withdraws Indian cricket team sponsorship and Pune Warriors ownership|date=13 April 2013|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/top-stories/Sahara-withdraws-Indian-cricket-team-sponsorship-and-Pune-Warriors-ownership/articleshow/11751668.cms|publisher=TOI}}</ref> They also boycotted the auction held on 4 February 2012. The main reason for the withdrawal was due to a problem in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by the Pune team. Sahara insisted that it had bid a huge amount for the Pune franchise under the notion that there would be 94 matches in the 2011 IPL season. As the BCCI later reduced the number of IPL matches to 74, Sahara demanded for a reduction in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by them to maintain viable IPL proposition.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> Other reasons included disputes between Sahara and the BCCI regarding the IPL rules, such as player retention and the 4-foreign player rule and also the refusal on the part of the BCCI to allow Pune to add Yuvraj Singh's price to their auction purse so that they could buy another player as a replacement for Yuvraj. Yuvraj was set to miss the whole [[2012 Indian Premier League|2012 season]] as he was undergoing treatment for [[germ cell tumor|germ cell cancer]].<ref name=\"withdraw\"/> On 6 February 2012, [[Subrata Roy]], the chairman of Sahara India Pariwar, said that Sourav Ganguly will take a call on reconciliation.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ipl-schedule.net/sourav-ganguly-to-take-call-on-reconciliation-subroto-roy/|title=Sourav Ganguly to take call on reconciliation: Subroto Roy}}</ref> A week later, the BCCI announced that they have allowed Yuvraj Singh's replacement for Pune Warriors India for the 2012 season, though a deadlock still persisted between the two parties on long-term sponsorship.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/et-cetera/bcci-sahara-feud-unresolved-board-refuses-to-make-any-exceptions/articleshow/11872185.cms |title=BCCI-Sahara feud unresolved, Board refuses to make any exceptions \u2013 Economic Times |newspaper=The Economic Times |date=13 February 2012 |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 February 2012, the BCCI and Sahara ended their differences and announced that Pune Warriors India will play in IPL 5.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pune Warriors India to play in IPL 5|date=4 February 2012|url=http://www.ipl-schedule.net/pune-warriors-india-to-play-in-ipl-5/}}</ref> The BCCI agreed to give Sahara a total purse of $3.4 million, $1.6 million from the money that they had for the auction and $1.8 million as compensation due to the absence of Yuvraj. It was also decided that Pune could replace Yuvraj with one player, whose fees would be up to $1.8 million. IPL's trading window was extended up to 29 February 2012 to allow the team to purchase players. Pune was also allowed the compensation of playing 5 foreign players in the squad, subject to the consent of the other 8 franchises. The BCCI also allowed Sahara to have a strategic partner in the franchise. Pune's new stadium would be allowed to host one of the play-off matches, provided [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] gave consent, because according to a BCCI rule, the right to host the play-off matches is given to the finalist of the previous edition. (RCB were the runners-up in the previous tournament).<ref>{{cite news|title=Sahara stays sponsor, Pune will play IPL|newspaper=The Times of India}}</ref> BCCI agreed to negotiate with Sahara regarding the amount of franchise fee to be paid and also agreed to start arbitration proceedings for the same.<ref name=\"pune out\"/>\n\n===2012 season===\n[[File:PWI VS DD.jpg|thumb|right|Pune Warriors India in action against [[Delhi Daredevils]] at the [[Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium]]]]\n{{Main|2012 Indian Premier League}}\nThough Pune boycotted the IPL auction, they signed international cricketers outside the auction including [[Marlon Samuels]], [[Luke Wright]], [[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]], [[Tamim Iqbal]], [[James Hopes]] and [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]]. They also signed Indian players including [[Raiphi Gomez]], [[Ali Murtaza]], [[Ashok Dinda]], [[Anustup Majumdar]] and [[Mahesh Rawat]].

But just like in 2011, the team could not maintain the initial momentum and again won only two more matches that season, against defending champions [[Chennai Super Kings]] at home and Delhi Daredevils away. Midway through the season, Ganguly was sacked as captain and was dropped from the team due to lack of results, but was retained as mentor.<ref name=\"dada\"/> However, this decision was later reversed and he returned to the team as captain. For the home match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, Ganguly rested himself, with Steve Smith taking up the captaincy, but still, the team lost by 35 runs. Pune finished last that season with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches.\n\n===2013 season===\n{{Main|2013 Indian Premier League}}\nFor the 2013 season, Pune Warriors India retained Steve Smith, Tamim Iqbal, Marlon Samuels and Luke Wright but released Clarke, James Hopes, Callum Ferguson, Alfonso Thomas, Murali Kartik and Jesse Ryder. Ganguly announced his retirement from all forms of cricket in October 2012,<ref name=\"bye dada\">[http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/1757445/report-sourav-ganguly-quits-ipl-retires-from-all-forms-of-cricket Ganguly retires]</ref> leaving the franchise without a captain. In the auction which was held on 3 February 2013, Clarke was bought back by the franchise for $400,000.<ref name=\"mc\">[http://zeenews.india.com/sports/cricket/indian-premier-league-2013/clarke-could-be-paid-more-to-lead-pune-warriors-in-ipl-report_758541.html Clarke could be paid more to lead Pune Warriors in IPL: Report]</ref> The team also bought international players like [[Ajantha Mendis]] and [[Kane Richardson]] and signed domestic players like [[Abhishek Nayar]], [[Tirumalasetti Suman]], [[Ishwar Pandey]], [[Parvez Rasool]] and [[Udit Birla]] for the 2013 season. The franchise also swapped a player with the Delhi Daredevils, trading Nehra for [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] batsman [[Ross Taylor]].<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/604641.html Delhi swap Taylor for Pune's Nehra]</ref> Yuvraj also returned to the team following his recovery from cancer. Unfortunately for the franchise, Clarke, who was the frontrunner to lead the team, was ruled out of the entire season with a recurring back and hamstring injury, which was aggravated during the [[Australian cricket team in India in 2012\u201313|Australian tour of India]] held earlier.<ref>[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/205416-michael-clarke-out-for-10-weeks-pune-warriors-have-to-hunt-for-new-captain Michael Clarke ruled out of IPL 6, Pune Warriors have to hunt for new captain]</ref> On 28 March 2013, the franchise named Sri Lankan Test and ODI captain and all-rounder Angelo Mathews as the captain for the 2013 season<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/627151.html Angelo Mathews named Pune Warriors' captain]</ref> and also signed Australian batsman [[Aaron Finch]] as a replacement for Clarke.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ipl-pune/content/story/627230.html Finch to replace Clarke for Pune Warriors]</ref>\n\nThe team's performance in the 2013 season was pathetic and mirrored its performance in 2012 with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches, finishing 8th and second-last in the league. The only matches the team won were against [[Rajasthan Royals]] (home), Chennai Super Kings (away), Kolkata Knight Riders (away) and Delhi Daredevils (home). The Warriors were thoroughly humiliated in their away match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, courtesy [[Chris Gayle]]'s 175 not out off only 66 balls and later became the first team in the 2013 season to be knocked out of contention for the playoffs after a loss to Chennai Super Kings at home. Like the previous seasons, the main cause for the team's poor performance was their constant squandering of winning chances and the lack of balance in the side, with more than 30 players being used during the season. The team was the only IPL franchise to use three captains that season. Mathews was sacked as captain following a poor start by the Warriors in the tournament and his own poor form and was replaced by Taylor for the away match against Chennai Super Kings. Following this match, Taylor was also sacked as captain due to his poor form, in spite of the team winning in Chennai, and was replaced by Finch, who captained the Warriors for the rest of the season.\n\n===Second and final withdrawal from IPL===\nOn 21 May 2013, just two days after finishing its league campaign, Sahara withdrew Pune Warriors India from the IPL for the second time in three years.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> The reason, according to BCCI, was the encashing of the team's bank guarantee after Sahara defaulted on paying the entire franchise fee.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> BCCI sources said that Sahara paid 20% of the franchise fee in January 2013 and had promised to pay the remaining amount by 19 May 2013 but they failed to do so.<ref name=\"pune gone\">[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/208101-ipl-6-bcci-encashes-bank-guarantee-after-pune-warriors-fail-to-pay-franchisee-fee BCCI encashes bank guarantee after Pune Warriors fail to pay franchisee fee]</ref> But Sahara blamed BCCI for the decision to pull out the Pune franchise from the IPL.

Srinivasan]] towards Sahara and the Pune franchise was the main reason for the withdrawal of Sahara from IPL and Indian cricket and also added that Sahara would never be associated with Indian cricket as long as Srinivasan is at the helm of BCCI affairs.<ref>[http://www.financialexpress.com/news/sack-n-srinivasan-or-wont-sponsor-team-india-subrata-roy/1120155 Sack N Srinivasan or won't sponsor Team India: Subrata Roy]</ref>\n\nOn 26 October 2013, the BCCI officially terminated its agreement with the team, bringing an end to the team's IPL sojourn.<ref name=\"goodbye pwi\"/>\n\n==Home ground==\n\n[[File:DY Patil Stadium.jpg|thumb|left|[[DY Patil Stadium]], the initial \"home\" ground of Pune Warriors India]]\n[[File:Sahara Stadium Pune 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium]] at Gahunje, the home ground of Pune Warriors India from 2012\u20132013]]\nIn their inaugural season in 2011, the team played their home matches at the [[DY Patil Stadium]] at [[Navi Mumbai]], as their designated home venue, the [[Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium]], was still under construction. Only from the 2012 season onwards did the team actually begin to play their home matches in Pune at the Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium, named after the Chairman of Sahara India Pariwar. It is located at Gahunje, a village located about {{convert|23|km}} north-west of Pune on the [[Mumbai Pune Expressway]].<ref name=\"gahunje\"/> It has a seating capacity of 55,000 spectators.<ref name=\"stadium\">[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/ipl/venues/Subrata-Roy-Sahara-Stadium-Pune/iplvenueshow.cms Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Pune]</ref>\n\nThe stadium became a source of contention between Sahara India Pariwar and the [[Maharashtra Cricket Association]] (MCA).

The jersey also incorporated the attacking warrior logo in the top-left corner of the shirt. From the 2012 season onwards, the primary colour of the jersey was changed to [[Turquoise (color)#Turquoise Blue|turquoise blue]]. [[Adidas]] was the kit manufacturer for the first two seasons, but for the third season, T. K. Sportswear was the kit manufacturer.

The video of the song showed a warrior riding on a horse and inspiring the Pune residents to come to the stadium where they witnessed the team cricketers. Then the team cricketers as well as the residents performed the Sahara salute (putting the right hand over the heart and saying \"Jai Sahara\").\n\n===Indian cheerleaders===\nPune Warriors India was the only IPL franchise which used Indian [[cheerleading|cheerleaders]] unlike the other franchises which use foreign cheerleaders. Known as ''Cheer Queens'', these cheerleaders were dressed up in traditional Indian attire designed by famous [[Bollywood]] designer [[Neeta Lulla]] and performed traditional Indian dances choreographed by ace choreographers [[Ganesh Hegde]] and [[Tanusree Shankar]], not the traditional gymnastic routines which are usually associated with cheerleading.<ref name=\"cheerleaders\">[http://www.infrawindow.com/weekends/ipl-cheerleaders_10_13/ IPL cheerleaders]</ref> In the words of Subrata Roy-\n\n{{quote|With Pune Warriors India's ''Cheer Queens'', we intend to showcase and bring recognition to the rich and diverse culture of India at an international platform.
