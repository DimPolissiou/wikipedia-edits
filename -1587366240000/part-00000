The explosion killed Angela Taylor, the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty. The materials for the bomb were stolen from Tyrconnel Mine. Several men were arrested for suspected involvement with the bombing. Stanley Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing.  Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, which involved a shootout with police officers injuring himself and an officer. He was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\n==Explosion==\n[[File:1978-1980 Holden VB Commodore 01.jpg|thumb|left|A Holden Commodore, like the one used in the Russell Street bombing]]\nThe explosion was caused by a [[car bomb]] hidden in a stolen 1979 [[Holden Commodore]], (bearing Victoria [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | registration plate]]; AVQ-508). The explosion caused a massive amount of damage to the police station and surrounding buildings, estimated at more than A$1&nbsp;million.  ''[[The Age]]'' reported that the blast's impact was enhanced by the open-floor design of the offices, which had acted like a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]], sending more shrapnel as the blast ripped through the floors and adding more pressure to the blast as it followed its path. The blast seriously injured 21-year-old  [[Constable|Police Constable]] Angela Taylor, who died on 20 April, becoming the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/03/24/1143083990293.html|title=Remembering the day Russell Street shook|work=The Age|date=25 March 2006|accessdate=12 March 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-24/scars-still-felt-20-years-after-russell-street-bombing/7264058 Scars still felt 30 years after Russell Street bombing], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 24 March 2016</ref> 22 other people were injured.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Investigations==\nOn 7 October 1985, [[gelignite]] and [[detonator]]s were stolen from the Tyrconnel Mine at Blackwood.

They called Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact, Miller and Victoria's Premier[[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria) | John Cain]] announced the $500,000 as a reward. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old industrial chemist; Vladimir Rhychta who was arrested while calling Miller's office from a public phone box by a St. Kilda detective on 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect parking a Commodore identical to the bomb car in front of the Russell Street Police HQ at around 12:30pm on the day of the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> Crupi had left Melbourne shortly after bombing, in a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table, making him a prime suspect, He was later arrested in Sydney on 15 April 1986. Under police questioning, Crupi denied that he had any involvement in the bombing but admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street. Crupi also stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria |Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria |East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the driver wrecked the Daimler. The driver fled on foot into nearby [[St. Albans, Victoria |St. Albans]] where he had stolen another car from a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a backpack, containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria |Victorian number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997, came back to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK)#SS Group A |VK Commodore HDT]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in[[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at[[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number |VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed (born Peter Komiazyk). Reed was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided the house of Karl Zelinka; an associate of both Reed and the Minogue brothers in [[Nunawading, Victoria | Nunawading]]. Evidence recovered from the house matched as the source of the components used in the construction of the bomb including a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene and a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place. Under police questioning, Zelinka (who had no criminal record) admitted that he saw Craig Minogue drive a Commodore identical to the one used in the bombing into the garage of the Zelinka's home. Zelinka also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for Zelinka and his girlfriend to travel to Sydney for the Easter Holiday just before the bombing occurred with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. Zelinka then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney after the bombing, he saw the Minogue brothers filling up a small trailer and was told by Craig Minogue that he and his brother were moving out from Zelinka's home.\n\nZelinka then told the detectives that while the Minogue brothers were staying at his home, they were visited multiple on several occasions before the bombing by an associate known to Craig Minogue. Zelinka described the associate as a older male aged about 50 and was referred to as \"Stan the Man\", Zelinka's description of \"Stan the Man\" matched to armed robber; Stanley Brian Taylor. Stan Taylor had a extensive criminal record dating back to 1946 when at the age of 8, he was arrested for truancy and sent to Bayswater Boys Home at [[The Basin, Victoria | The Basin]] for two years. In 1949, he was arrested for fishing in prohibited area. During his young adult years, Taylor had been convicted of theft of motorcycles and burglary. In the early 1960s, Taylor was convicted of a armed robbery on a [[Milk bar | milk bar]] in [[Clayton, Victoria | Clayton]] and was sent to [[HM Prison Pentridge | Pentridge's]] notorious H Division where met [[Ronald Ryan]]; the last man hanged in Australia. Ryan had asked Taylor to accompanied him on his escape but Taylor refused. After Ryan was hanged, Taylor and another prisoner escaped from Pentridge, while on the run, Taylor committed seven bank robberies over a period of five days before being recaptured and sent back to prison.      \n\nWhile in prison, Taylor became a model prisoner and was released in 1978. After his release, Taylor became a social worker to help young men avoid a life of crime. Taylor was also a bit actor, in 1979, he starred in an episode of [[Prisoner (TV series) | Prisoner]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/russell-street-bomber-the-dying-embers-of-hate-20150611-ghlatl.html|title=Russell Street Bomber: the dying embers of hate|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2015-06-11|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDetectives arrested Taylor at his home in [[Birchip, Victoria | Birchip]] on the 30 May 1986. Under questioning, Taylor claimed that he had no involvement in the bombing and that knew Craig and Rodney Minogue through his job as a social worker and he met them to prevent them from getting involved in any crime, but admitted that both Craig and Ro.\n\nDetectives then ran a search for Craig and Rodney Minogue and found that they moved into a house within close distance of Taylor's home in Birchip, a raid on the house failed to locate the Minogue Brother but turned up evidence linking them to Russell Street Bombing. At the house, detectives recovered an large drill machine that matched to the drill marks on both the stolen silver Commodore and on the bomb car.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nProsecutors did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (i.e. never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced. Taylor died in prison at the age of 79.[https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/stanley-taylor-died-from-natural-causes-while-in-custody/news-story/fb57c49ed0d9e69c35c3a933bf5af30a] Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years.

Taylor was also a bit actor, in 1979, he starred in an episode of [[Prisoner (TV series) | Prisoner]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/russell-street-bomber-the-dying-embers-of-hate-20150611-ghlatl.html|title=Russell Street Bomber: the dying embers of hate|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2015-06-11|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDetectives arrested Taylor at his home in [[Birchip, Victoria | Birchip]] on the 30 May 1986. Under questioning, Taylor claimed that he had no involvement in the bombing and that knew Craig and Rodney Minogue through his job as a social worker and he met them to prevent them from getting involved in any crime, but admitted that both Craig and Ro.\n\nDetectives then ran a search for Craig and Rodney Minogue and found that they moved into a house within close distance of Taylor's home in Birchip, a raid on the house failed to locate the Minogue Brother but turned up evidence linking them to Russell Street Bombing. At the house, detectives recovered an large drill machine that matched to the drill marks on both the stolen silver Commodore and on the bomb car.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nProsecutors did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (i.e. never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced. Taylor died in prison at the age of 79.[https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/stanley-taylor-died-from-natural-causes-while-in-custody/news-story/fb57c49ed0d9e69c35c3a933bf5af30a] Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years.

Mouse''''' is an American [[surreal humour]] and [[psychological thriller]] [[Animated series#Television|animated television series]] created by [[Matt Maiellaro]] for [[Cartoon Network]]'s late-night programming block, [[Adult Swim]].<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=665}}</ref> The series revolves around Mouse Fitzgerald, nicknamed \"Fitz\" (voiced by Maiellaro), an alcoholic mouse who performs odd jobs so he can buy more beer. Together with his [[chinchilla]] companion Skillet, Fitz begins to recover [[memory inhibition|suppressed memories]] that he once had a wife and a child who have now vanished. This leads him to seek answers about his past and the shadowy forces that seem to be manipulating his world.\n\nIn producing the series, Maiellaro crudely designed the characters as a cost-cutting measure; the series is animated by [[Radical Axis (studio)|Radical Axis]]. He intended for the series to lack continuity starting from the pilot, but established a [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]] format after starting the second episode. He had constructed an ending for the series as well as a detailed map of characters; however, the series finale concluded differently from planned. Maiellaro cast people around his office for the characters, starring himself as the protagonist and [[Nine Pound Hammer]] vocalist Scott Luallen as the voice of Roostre; the band also performs the opening theme.\n\nThe [[pilot episode]] for ''12 oz. Mouse'', \"Hired\", premiered on June 19, 2005. The series became a regular staple of Adult Swim's lineup on October 23 of that year, and ended on December 17, 2006. Critical reception was polarized; some praised the series' experimental nature, while others felt confounded by it.\n\nThe June 14, 2018 episode of the Adult Swim streaming series ''Development Meeting'' featured a new clip from ''12 oz. Mouse'', which featured [[Seth Green]] as Fitz, hinting at a return to the series. It was later announced on September 18 of that year that the series would return for a half-hour special entitled \"Invictus\", which aired a month later on October 14. On the day of the special's airing, another announcement was made that the series will return for a 10-episode third season which will air in 2020.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157044251066833&id=717366832 | title=13 years ago I worked on a show for... \u2013 Brad Lee Zimmerman {{!}} Facebook | date=October 14, 2018 | accessdate=October 15, 2018 | author=Zimmerman, Brad Lee | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015195039/https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157044251066833&id=717366832 | archivedate=October 15, 2018}}</ref> On March 31, 2020, the third season premiere aired unannounced at 2:45 AM EST with many other new episodes from Adult Swim shows as part of Adult Swim's annual April Fools Prank.

The show employs a serial format, and its ongoing storyline developed from [[absurdism|absurdist]] comedy to include mystery and [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] elements.<ref name=\"Norman2007\">{{cite web | url=http://www.shriekingtree.com/12_oz_Mouse/ | title=''12 oz.

This leads him to seek answers about his past and the shadowy forces that seem to be manipulating his world.\n\nFitz suspects there is a sinister conspiracy which appears to revolve around fields of \"{{sic|aspr|ind}}\" pills beneath the city, and Shark ([[Adam Reed]]), Clock, and Rectangular Businessman's (Kurt Soccolich) attempts to control the nature of time and reality. Fitz and Skillet receive help from Liquor ([[Matt Harrigan]]), Roostre (Scott Luallen), Stoned Peanut Cop (Nick Weidenfeld) and others as they engage in gun battles, blow things up, and try to understand cryptic hints. The show also sometimes contains surreal \"subliminal\" images that flash across the screen during key plot moments, including [[skull]]s, [[mustache]]d snake beasts and people screaming.\n\nThe series concludes with the revelation that Fitz has been kidnapped and placed into a simulation by the Shadowy Figure. He is about to be killed by Shark and the Rectangular Businessman, in their true forms outside the simulation, when he is rescued by the true form of Peanut Cop and a nurse who works in the simulation chamber. They kill Shark and Rectangle Businessman, but it is unknown if they are truly dead because the simulation in which most of the show takes place is probably taking place in another simulation. One of the purposes of the simulation seen in most of the show was to extract information from Fitz. The conclusion to episode 20 is ambiguous as to whether or not it is actually the end of the series, as some aspects of the plot remain unresolved&nbsp;\u2013 Golden Joe says \"I thought this was done,\" to which Fitz replies, \"I thought so too. I guess we're not.\"<ref name=\"Prolegomenon\">{{cite episode | title=Prolegomenon | publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] | date=December 17, 2006 | series=12 oz.

Golden Joe is carried away by birds, while later one night, Peanut Cop mysteriously disappears. Fitz and Skillet later meet a woman, Lee, who turns out to be a werewolf. Their fate at the end of the episode was unknown.\n\nIn 2018, a half-hour special episode aired, which continued the story. Fitz, now with a mustache and suffering from amnesia, is shown to be living in a new city during an unspecified amount of time after the original finale. Shark and Square Guy have returned somehow, and are trying to kidnap Fitz so they can return to the \"real\" world with the help of exterminator bee, Buzby ([[Dana Snyder]]). Skillet, Roostre, Peanut Cop, Golden Joe, and The New Guy ([[Mike Lazzo]]) must find and escape the simulation with Fitz before Shark and Square Guy do. The story is to continue in the third season, which is set to air in 2020.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Production===\nAccording to Maiellaro, the series was pitched as a [[table read]] to the network. He jokingly stated that they accepted it after claiming that production costs would total \"five dollars and will take some of the paper sitting in the copier.\"<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> Maiellaro borrowed inspiration from [[surrealism]] and the films of [[David Lynch]].<ref name=\"Turner Content Solutions2009\">{{cite web | url=http://www.turnercontentsolutions.com/viewprogram/67C8C8C0-E415-4BA0-B99C-2E0662CD37E7 | title=''12 oz.

Mouse characters}}\n[[File:Matt Maiellaro nel 2010.jpg|thumb|right|Matt Maiellaro, pictured in 2010, created the series while providing the voice of Mouse.]]\nMaiellaro cast people around his office to voice the characters. He provides the voice of the protagonist, Mouse Fitzgerald. He originally only gave the scratch dialogue for the character during production of the pilot episode, but chose himself to voice Mouse regularly after hearing his lines assembled in the final cut. Kurt Soccolich was chosen by Maiellaro to voice Rectangular Businessman, who \"already had that sort of smooth arrogance in his voice\", making him a \"perfect\" fit for him.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> [[Matt Harrigan]] was selected to voice Liquor, who is \"always looking to make light of a situation\", according to Maiellaro.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/>\n\nNick Weidenfeld provides the voice of Peanut Cop; Melissa Warrenburg portrays an annoying woman in a green sweater, who Maiellaro dubs \"Robogirl\". Bonnie Rosmarin voices Man/Woman, picked for what Maiellaro stated is a \"pouty, stand-offish quality\" in her delivery.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> Nick Ingkatanuwat voices The Eye and Adam Reed plays Shark. Vocalist of [[Nine Pound Hammer]] Scott Luallen voices Roostre; the band also composed the opening theme song for the series. Golden Joe is voiced by Vishal Roney; after hearing his first take on the character, Maiellaro explained that he was left unable to write any of his lines. He proceeded to only provide the basic structure of his lines in the script, instructing him to [[retroscript]] the rest.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/>\n\n===Title sequence and music===\nMaiellaro spent three weeks working with Ingkatanuwat on putting together the set for the opening title sequence. The set was filmed with a [[Motion control photography|motion control camera]], and was inserted with miniature explosives and smoke bombs for [[special effect]]. Nine Pound Hammer composed the opening theme song; Maiellaro sought for a song representing the \"carefree\" lifestyle of Mouse who \"does things like drive drunk, film porno and shoot guns.\"<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> Maiellaro, who plays the [[electric guitar]] in his free time, also composed the song \"F-Off\", featured in both the first episode and in \"Auraphull\", which he wrote while working on ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast''.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> Swedish [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Amaranthe]] performed the credits theme song for the 2018 special, \"Invictus\".\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of 12 oz.

Mouse''''' is an American [[surreal humour]] and [[psychological thriller]] [[Animated series#Television|animated television series]] created by [[Matt Maiellaro]] for [[Cartoon Network]]'s late-night programming block, [[Adult Swim]].<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=665}}</ref> The series revolves around Mouse Fitzgerald, nicknamed \"Fitz\" (voiced by Maiellaro), an alcoholic mouse who performs odd jobs so he can buy more beer. Together with his [[chinchilla]] companion Skillet, Fitz begins to recover [[memory inhibition|suppressed memories]] that he once had a wife and a child who have now vanished. This leads him to seek answers about his past and the shadowy forces that seem to be manipulating his world.\n\nIn producing the series, Maiellaro crudely designed the characters as a cost-cutting measure; the series is animated by [[Radical Axis (studio)|Radical Axis]]. He intended for the series to lack continuity starting from the pilot, but established a [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]] format after starting the second episode. He had constructed an ending for the series as well as a detailed map of characters; however, the series finale concluded differently from planned. Maiellaro cast people around his office for the characters, starring himself as the protagonist and [[Nine Pound Hammer]] vocalist Scott Luallen as the voice of Roostre; the band also performs the opening theme.\n\nThe [[pilot episode]] for ''12 oz. Mouse'', \"Hired\", premiered on June 19, 2005. The series became a regular staple of Adult Swim's lineup on October 23 of that year, and ended on December 17, 2006. Critical reception was polarized; some praised the series' experimental nature, while others felt confounded by it.\n\nThe June 14, 2018 episode of the Adult Swim streaming series ''Development Meeting'' featured a new clip from ''12 oz. Mouse'', which featured [[Seth Green]] as Fitz, hinting at a return to the series. It was later announced on September 18 of that year that the series would return for a half-hour special entitled \"Invictus\", which aired a month later on October 14. On the day of the special's airing, another announcement was made that the series will return for a 10-episode third season which will air in 2020.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157044251066833&id=717366832 | title=13 years ago I worked on a show for... \u2013 Brad Lee Zimmerman {{!}} Facebook | date=October 14, 2018 | accessdate=October 15, 2018 | author=Zimmerman, Brad Lee | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015195039/https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157044251066833&id=717366832 | archivedate=October 15, 2018}}</ref> On March 31, 2020, the third season premiere aired unannounced at 2:45 AM EST with many other new episodes from Adult Swim shows as part of Adult Swim's annual April Fools Prank.

The show employs a serial format, and its ongoing storyline developed from [[absurdism|absurdist]] comedy to include mystery and [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] elements.<ref name=\"Norman2007\">{{cite web | url=http://www.shriekingtree.com/12_oz_Mouse/ | title=''12 oz.

This leads him to seek answers about his past and the shadowy forces that seem to be manipulating his world.\n\nFitz suspects there is a sinister conspiracy which appears to revolve around fields of \"{{sic|aspr|ind}}\" pills beneath the city, and Shark ([[Adam Reed]]), Clock, and Rectangular Businessman's (Kurt Soccolich) attempts to control the nature of time and reality. Fitz and Skillet receive help from Liquor ([[Matt Harrigan]]), Roostre (Scott Luallen), Stoned Peanut Cop (Nick Weidenfeld) and others as they engage in gun battles, blow things up, and try to understand cryptic hints. The show also sometimes contains surreal \"subliminal\" images that flash across the screen during key plot moments, including [[skull]]s, [[mustache]]d snake beasts and people screaming.\n\nThe series concludes with the revelation that Fitz has been kidnapped and placed into a simulation by the Shadowy Figure. He is about to be killed by Shark and the Rectangular Businessman, in their true forms outside the simulation, when he is rescued by the true form of Peanut Cop and a nurse who works in the simulation chamber. They kill Shark and Rectangle Businessman, but it is unknown if they are truly dead because the simulation in which most of the show takes place is probably taking place in another simulation. One of the purposes of the simulation seen in most of the show was to extract information from Fitz. The conclusion to episode 20 is ambiguous as to whether or not it is actually the end of the series, as some aspects of the plot remain unresolved&nbsp;\u2013 Golden Joe says \"I thought this was done,\" to which Fitz replies, \"I thought so too. I guess we're not.\"<ref name=\"Prolegomenon\">{{cite episode | title=Prolegomenon | publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] | date=December 17, 2006 | series=12 oz.

Golden Joe is carried away by birds, while later one night, Peanut Cop mysteriously disappears. Fitz and Skillet later meet a woman, Lee, who turns out to be a werewolf. Their fate at the end of the episode was unknown.\n\nIn 2018, a half-hour special episode aired, which continued the story. Fitz, now with a mustache and suffering from amnesia, is shown to be living in a new city during an unspecified amount of time after the original finale. Shark and Square Guy have returned somehow, and are trying to kidnap Fitz so they can return to the \"real\" world with the help of exterminator bee, Buzby ([[Dana Snyder]]). Skillet, Roostre, Peanut Cop, Golden Joe, and The New Guy ([[Mike Lazzo]]) must find and escape the simulation with Fitz before Shark and Square Guy do. The story is to continue in the third season, which is set to air in 2020.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Production===\nAccording to Maiellaro, the series was pitched as a [[table read]] to the network. He jokingly stated that they accepted it after claiming that production costs would total \"five dollars and will take some of the paper sitting in the copier.\"<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> Maiellaro borrowed inspiration from [[surrealism]] and the films of [[David Lynch]].<ref name=\"Turner Content Solutions2009\">{{cite web | url=http://www.turnercontentsolutions.com/viewprogram/67C8C8C0-E415-4BA0-B99C-2E0662CD37E7 | title=''12 oz.

He provides the voice of the protagonist, Mouse Fitzgerald. He originally only gave the scratch dialogue for the character during production of the pilot episode, but chose himself to voice Mouse regularly after hearing his lines assembled in the final cut. Kurt Soccolich was chosen by Maiellaro to voice Rectangular Businessman, who \"already had that sort of smooth arrogance in his voice\", making him a \"perfect\" fit for him.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> [[Matt Harrigan]] was selected to voice Liquor, who is \"always looking to make light of a situation\", according to Maiellaro.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/>\n\nNick Weidenfeld provides the voice of Peanut Cop; Melissa Warrenburg portrays an annoying woman in a green sweater, who Maiellaro dubs \"Robogirl\". Bonnie Rosmarin voices Man/Woman, picked for what Maiellaro stated is a \"pouty, stand-offish quality\" in her delivery.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> Nick Ingkatanuwat voices The Eye and Adam Reed plays Shark. Vocalist of [[Nine Pound Hammer]] Scott Luallen voices Roostre; the band also composed the opening theme song for the series. Golden Joe is voiced by Vishal Roney; after hearing his first take on the character, Maiellaro explained that he was left unable to write any of his lines. He proceeded to only provide the basic structure of his lines in the script, instructing him to [[retroscript]] the rest.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/>\n\n===Title sequence and music===\nMaiellaro spent three weeks working with Ingkatanuwat on putting together the set for the opening title sequence. The set was filmed with a [[Motion control photography|motion control camera]], and was inserted with miniature explosives and smoke bombs for [[special effect]]. Nine Pound Hammer composed the opening theme song; Maiellaro sought for a song representing the \"carefree\" lifestyle of Mouse who \"does things like drive drunk, film porno and shoot guns.\"<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> Maiellaro, who plays the [[electric guitar]] in his free time, also composed the song \"F-Off\", featured in both the first episode and in \"Auraphull\", which he wrote while working on ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast''.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> Swedish [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Amaranthe]] performed the credits theme song for the 2018 special, \"Invictus\".\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of 12 oz.

The club's chairman was [[Franz Rinderer]]. FC Basel played their home games in the [[Landhof]] in the district Wettstein in Kleinbasel.\n\n== Overview ==\nBasel played a total of 28 matches in the 1916\u201317 season. 12 of these were in the domestic league and 16 were friendly matches. Of these friendlies eight were won, three were drawn and five ended in a defeat. There were three home fixtures played in the [[Landhof]] and 13 away games. Four of these games were played in the Basel championship against the two other local teams [[BSC Old Boys|Old Boys]] and [[FC Nordstern Basel|Nordstern Basel]]. Due to the early date of the season the three teams decided to play the return matches of the Championship all on one day as a tournament and played shortened games, both halves each in 30 minutes. FC Basel won the Championship.\n\nThe [[1916\u201317 Swiss Serie A|domestic league, Swiss Serie A 1916\u201317]], was divided into three regional groups, East, Central and West. Basel and the two other Basel teams were allocated to the Central group which had only seven teams. The other teams playing in the Central group were [[FC Bern]], [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys Bern]], [[FC Biel-Bienne|Biel-Bienne]] and [[FC Aarau|Aarau]]. Basel played a good season, suffering only two defeats. They ended the season in second position with 15 points. In their 12 games Basel scored 31 goals and conceded 20.

The club's chairman was [[Franz Rinderer]]. FC Basel played their home games in the [[Landhof]] in the district Wettstein in Kleinbasel.\n\n== Overview ==\nBasel played a total of 28 matches in the 1916\u201317 season. 12 of these were in the domestic league and 16 were friendly matches. Of these friendlies eight were won, three were drawn and five ended in a defeat. There were three home fixtures played in the [[Landhof]] and 13 away games. Four of these games were played in the Basel championship against the two other local teams [[BSC Old Boys|Old Boys]] and [[FC Nordstern Basel|Nordstern Basel]]. Due to the early date of the season the three teams decided to play the return matches of the Championship all on one day as a tournament and played shortened games, both halves each in 30 minutes. FC Basel won the Championship.\n\nThe [[1916\u201317 Swiss Serie A|domestic league, Swiss Serie A 1916\u201317]], was divided into three regional groups, East, Central and West. Basel and the two other Basel teams were allocated to the Central group which had only seven teams. The other teams playing in the Central group were [[FC Bern]], [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys Bern]], [[FC Biel-Bienne|Biel-Bienne]] and [[FC Aarau|Aarau]]. Basel played a good season, suffering only two defeats. They ended the season in second position with 15 points. In their 12 games Basel scored 31 goals and conceded 20. [[Karl W\u00fcthrich]] was the team's best goal scorer, netting six times in 11 games. The Young Boys won the group and continued to the finals.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-1916/17\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/rangliste?saison=1916/17 | title = Rangliste Serie A - Zentralschweiz | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2018-11-16}}</ref> Here they played against [[FC La Chaux-de-Fonds|La Chaux-de-Fonds]] and [[FC Winterthur|VFC Winterthur-Veltheim]].
