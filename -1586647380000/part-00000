This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients.<ref>Jenkins (1986), p. 5.</ref> ''Amanita abrupta'' is widely distributed throughout eastern North America,<ref name=\"Metzler p64\"/> where it has been found as far north as [[Quebec, Canada]],<ref name=\"urlwww.mao-qc.ca\"/> and as far south as [[Mexico]].<ref name=\"Gu\u00eda 2001\"/> [[Orson K.

This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients.<ref>Jenkins (1986), p. 5.</ref> ''Amanita abrupta'' is widely distributed throughout eastern North America,<ref name=\"Metzler p64\"/> where it has been found as far north as [[Quebec, Canada]],<ref name=\"urlwww.mao-qc.ca\"/> and as far south as [[Mexico]].<ref name=\"Gu\u00eda 2001\"/> [[Orson K. Miller]] claims to have found it in the [[Dominican Republic]] where it appeared to be growing in a mycorrizhal association with [[pine]] trees.<ref name=\"Miller 2006\"/> Kuo also mentions a mycorrhizal relationship with both [[hardwood]]s and [[conifer]]s,<ref name=\"urlMushroomExpert: A. abrupta\"/> while Tulloss lists additional preferred tree hosts such as [[beech]], [[birch]], [[fir]], [[tsuga]], [[oak]], and [[Populus|poplar]].<ref name=\"urlAmanita abrupta Peck\"/> However, ''A.&nbsp;abrupta'' has been shown experimentally to not form mycorrhizae with [[Virginia Pine]].<ref name=\"Vozzo 1961\"/>\n\n==Pharmacology==\nAnimal test based studies ([[mice]]) with aqueous extracts of ''Amanita abrupta'' have demonstrated [[hepatotoxic]] potential.

Later it was moved to a site near the Grange Hall, on the north side of town. The school was located there until the \"new\" Junction School was built in 1960 on the south side of town.\n\nIn 1907 or thereabouts, Frank and Mary Love owned the Palo Cedro general store. The store was on the west side of the tracks and their house on the east.  A two-story house on the northeast corner of Deschutes Road and Old Forty-Four Drive may, at one time, have been a stopping place for stage drivers and travelers. Sarah Addington later owned the Palo Cedro store.  She was also the postmaster and handed the position down to her daughter, Mary Jones. She moved the post office next door into her home.\n\nJohn Gebauer has since owned the store. In the 1960s John moved to his new building on the south east side of Palo Cedro; it had several one-story spaces for commercial businesses. The largest business was the Palo Cedro Market. Gebauer's son John now operates it. The post office moved into a part of Gebauer's building. Mary Jones' assistants were her sisters. The next postmaster was Sylvia Metz. As she found the post office needed more space, it moved to a two-story building on the north side of Palo Cedro.\n\nThe first Grange Hall and Feed Store were constructed in the early 1930s, just off Deschutes Road on Old Highway 44.  The building was two stories with the meeting and/or dance hall upstairs. The dining room was downstairs in back and the feed store in front. This building burned down in the early 1940s and was quickly replaced with a one-story building, which is still in use in the 21st century. The feed store was built on the north side of Old Forty-Four Drive and is still there today.\n\nAs Palo Cedro continued to grow more services were needed, and the first independently owned pharmacy opened in August 1975.  Its first space was a remodelled auto body shop. To accommodate its growing business, it moved to the current location on the south side of Highway 44 off Deschutes Road. Palo Cedro Pharmacy has an eclectic mix of pictures, memorabilia, and antiques collected over the last 40 years showing how the town and pharmacy has changed over the years. The unannounced and unknown to the Community and self proclaimed current Mayor of Palo Cedro is Carlos Zapata.\n\n==Geography==\nPalo Cedro is located at {{Coord|40|33|4|N|122|14|3|W|type:city}} (40.551091, \u2212122.234255)<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> at an elevation of 465&nbsp;ft (143 m) above sea level.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|3.8|sqmi|km2}}, 98.00% of it land, and 2.00% of it water.\n\n===Climate===\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, Palo Cedro has a [[Mediterranean climate#Warm-summer Mediterranean climate|warm-summer Mediterranean climate]], abbreviated \"Csa\" on climate maps.<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=692740&cityname=Palo+Cedro%2C+California%2C+United+States+of+America&units= Climate Summary for Palo Cedro, California]</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0655296|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140715032244/http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0655296|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 15, 2014|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Palo Cedro CDP|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Palo Cedro had a population of 1,269.

Miners used this railroad, as did the Terry Lumber Company at Bella Vista.  The train delivered groceries and mail to the villages along its route. It also had a passenger car.\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\n{{see|History of California 1900 to present|California}}\nIn the early 1900s, the stage route went from [[Redding, California|Redding]] through Palo Cedro, [[Millville, California|Millville]], [[Oak Run, California|Oak Run]], and on to [[Fall River Mills, California|Fall River Mills]].\n\nPalo Cedro's first school house was located near the corner of Hillside Drive and Deschutes Road on the south side of town. Later it was moved to a site near the Grange Hall, on the north side of town. The school was located there until the \"new\" Junction School was built in 1960 on the south side of town.\n\nIn 1907 or thereabouts, Frank and Mary Love owned the Palo Cedro general store. The store was on the west side of the tracks and their house on the east.  A two-story house on the northeast corner of Deschutes Road and Old Forty-Four Drive may, at one time, have been a stopping place for stage drivers and travelers. Sarah Addington later owned the Palo Cedro store.  She was also the postmaster and handed the position down to her daughter, Mary Jones. She moved the post office next door into her home.\n\nJohn Gebauer has since owned the store. In the 1960s John moved to his new building on the south east side of Palo Cedro; it had several one-story spaces for commercial businesses. The largest business was the Palo Cedro Market. Gebauer's son John now operates it. The post office moved into a part of Gebauer's building. Mary Jones' assistants were her sisters. The next postmaster was Sylvia Metz. As she found the post office needed more space, it moved to a two-story building on the north side of Palo Cedro.\n\nThe first Grange Hall and Feed Store were constructed in the early 1930s, just off Deschutes Road on Old Highway 44.  The building was two stories with the meeting and/or dance hall upstairs. The dining room was downstairs in back and the feed store in front. This building burned down in the early 1940s and was quickly replaced with a one-story building, which is still in use in the 21st century. The feed store was built on the north side of Old Forty-Four Drive and is still there today.\n\nAs Palo Cedro continued to grow more services were needed, and the first independently owned pharmacy opened in August 1975.  Its first space was a remodelled auto body shop. To accommodate its growing business, it moved to the current location on the south side of Highway 44 off Deschutes Road. Palo Cedro Pharmacy has an eclectic mix of pictures, memorabilia, and antiques collected over the last 40 years showing how the town and pharmacy has changed over the years. The current Mayor of Palo Cedro is Carlos Zapata.\n\n==Geography==\nPalo Cedro is located at {{Coord|40|33|4|N|122|14|3|W|type:city}} (40.551091, \u2212122.234255)<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> at an elevation of 465&nbsp;ft (143 m) above sea level.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|3.8|sqmi|km2}}, 98.00% of it land, and 2.00% of it water.\n\n===Climate===\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, Palo Cedro has a [[Mediterranean climate#Warm-summer Mediterranean climate|warm-summer Mediterranean climate]], abbreviated \"Csa\" on climate maps.<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=692740&cityname=Palo+Cedro%2C+California%2C+United+States+of+America&units= Climate Summary for Palo Cedro, California]</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0655296|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140715032244/http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0655296|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 15, 2014|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Palo Cedro CDP|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Palo Cedro had a population of 1,269.

Widely regarded as the country's first president to come from its [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population,{{efn|Morales is described as the first indigenous president of Bolivia in academic studies of his presidency, such as those of Mu\u00f1oz-Pogossian,{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz-Pogossian|2008|p=180}} Webber,{{sfn|Webber|2011|p=1}} Philip and Panizza,{{sfn|Philip|Panizza|2011|p=57}} and Farthing and Kohl,{{sfn|Farthing|Kohl|2014|p=1}} as well as in press reports, such as those of [[BBC News]],<ref name=\"BBC bio\"/> However, there have been challenges to this claim by critics who have asserted that Morales probably has some European ancestry, and thus on genetic grounds is technically ''[[mestizo]]'' rather than solely indigenous.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=7}} Further, former president [[Enrique Pe\u00f1aranda]] was of substantially indigenous origin.

A [[socialist]], he is the head of the [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement for Socialism]] (MAS) party.\n\n<!--Early life and political activism-->\nBorn to an [[Aymara people|Aymara]] family of [[subsistence farmers]] in Isallawi, [[Orinoca Canton]], Morales undertook a basic education before mandatory military service, in 1978 moving to [[Chapare Province]]. Growing [[coca]] and becoming a trade unionist, he rose to prominence in the ''[[Unique Confederation of Rural Laborers of Bolivia|campesino]]'' (\"rural laborers\") union. In that capacity, he campaigned against U.S. and Bolivian attempts to [[coca eradication|eradicate coca]] as part of the [[War on Drugs]], denouncing these as an [[imperialist]] violation of indigenous Andean culture. His involvement in anti-government [[direct action]] protests resulted in multiple arrests. Morales entered electoral politics in 1995, became the leader of the MAS, and was elected to [[Bolivian National Congress, 1997\u20132002|Congress]] in 1997. Coupled with [[populist]] rhetoric, his campaign focused on issues affecting indigenous and poor communities, advocating land reform and the more equal redistribution of gas wealth. He gained increased visibility through the [[Cochabamba Water War]] and [[Bolivian gas conflict|gas conflict]]. In 2002, he was expelled from Congress for encouraging anti-government protesters, although he came second in [[2002 Bolivian general election|that year's presidential election]].\n\n<!--Presidency-->\n[[2005 Bolivian general election|Once elected in 2005]], Morales increased taxation on the hydrocarbon industry to bolster social spending and emphasized projects to combat illiteracy, poverty, racism, and sexism. Vocally criticizing [[neoliberalism]], Morales' government moved Bolivia towards a [[mixed economy]], reduced its dependence on the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]], and oversaw strong economic growth. Scaling back U.S. influence in the country, he built relationships with leftist governments in the Latin American [[pink tide]]\u2014especially [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]]'s Venezuela and [[Fidel Castro]]'s Cuba\u2014and signed Bolivia into the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]]. His administration opposed the right-wing autonomist demands of [[media luna|Bolivia's eastern provinces]], won [[2008 Bolivian vote of confidence referendum|a 2008 recall referendum]], and instituted a [[Constitution of Bolivia|new constitution]] that established Bolivia as a [[plurinationalism|plurinational state]]. [[2009 Bolivian general election|Re-elected in 2009]] and [[2014 Bolivian general election|2014]], he oversaw Bolivia's admission to the [[Bank of the South]] and [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]] although his popularity was dented by attempts to abolish presidential [[term limits]].

Many Bolivians hoped to set up farms where they could earn a living growing coca, which was experiencing a steady rise in price and which could be cultivated up to four times a year; a traditional medicinal and ritual substance in Andean culture, it was also sold abroad as the key ingredient in [[cocaine]].{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=39}} Morales joined the local soccer team, before founding his own team, New Horizon, which proved victorious at the August 2 Central Tournament.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=39}} The El Chapare region remained special to Morales for many years to come; during his presidency he often talked of it in speeches and regularly visited.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=39}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Folha de coca.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Mate de coca Peru.jpg\n| width2 = 198\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer =  Morales policy was \"Coca Yes, Cocaine No\".

Organizing soccer tournaments, among union members he earned the nickname of \"the young ball player\" because of his tendency to organize matches during meeting recesses.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=39}} Influenced in joining the union by wider events, in 1980 the far-right General [[Luis Garc\u00eda Meza]] had seized power in a military coup, banning other political parties and declaring himself president; for Morales, a \"foundational event in his relationship with politics\" occurred in 1981, when a ''campesino'' (coca grower) was accused of cocaine trafficking by soldiers, beaten up, and burned to death.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|pp=40\u201341}} In 1982 the leftist [[Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo]] and the [[Democratic and Popular Union]] (''Unidad Democr\u00e1tica y Popular'' \u2013 UDP) took power in [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] elections, before implementing [[neoliberalism|neoliberal capitalist]] reforms and privatizing much of the state sector with US support; hyperinflation came under control, but unemployment rose to 25%.{{sfnm|1a1=Sivak|1y=2010|1pp=40\u201341|2a1=Philip|2a2=Panizza|2y=2011|2pp=76&ndash;77}} Becoming increasingly active in the union, from 1982 to 1983, Morales served as the General Secretary of his local San Francisco syndicate.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=42}} However, in 1983, Morales's father Dionisio died, and although he missed the funeral he temporarily retreated from his union work to organize his father's affairs.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|pp=40\u201341, 57\u201358}}\n\nFighting their [[War on Drugs]], the U.S. government hoped to stem the cocaine trade by preventing the production of coca; they pressured the Bolivian government to eradicate it, sending troops to Bolivia to aid the operation.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=41}} Bolivian troops would burn coca crops and in many cases beat up coca growers who challenged them.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=109}} Angered by this, Morales returned to ''cocalero'' campaigning; like many of his comrades, he refused the US$2,500 compensation offered by the government for each acre of coca he eradicated. Deeply embedded in Bolivian culture, the ''campesinos'' had an ancestral relationship with coca and did not want to lose their most profitable means of subsistence. For them, it was an issue of national sovereignty, with the U.S. viewed as [[imperialism|imperalists]]; activists regularly proclaimed \"Long live coca! Death to the Yankees!\" (\"''Causachun coca!

He adopted a policy of \"[[Shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]\", implementing economic liberalization and widescale privatization of state-owned assets.{{sfn|Harten|2011|pp=97\u201399}} S\u00e1nchez also agreed with the U.S. DEA to relaunch its offensive against the Bolivian coca growers, committing Bolivia to eradicating {{convert|12500|acre|ha}} of coca by March 1994 in exchange for $20 million worth of US aid, something Morales claimed would be opposed by the cocalero movement.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nIn August 1994 Morales was arrested; reporters present at the scene witnessed him being beaten and accosted with racial slurs by civil agents. Accused of sedition, in jail he began a dry hunger strike to protest his arrest.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=45}} The following day, 3000 ''campesinos'' began a {{convert|360|mi|km|adj=on}} march from [[Villa Tunari]] to La Paz. Morales would be freed on September 7, and soon joined the march, which arrived at its destination on September 19, where they covered the city with political graffiti.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|pp=45\u201347}} He was again arrested in April 1995 during a sting operation that rounded up those at a meeting of the Andean Council of Coca Producers that he was chairing on the shores of Lake Titicaca. Accusing the group of plotting a coup with the aid of Colombia's [[FARC]] and Peru's [[Shining Path]], a number of his comrades were tortured, although no evidence of a coup was brought forth and he was freed within a week.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=47}} He proceeded to Argentina to attend a seminar on liberation struggles.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|pp=47\u201349}}\n\n==Political rise==\n===The ASP, IPSP, and MAS: 1995\u201399===\nMembers of the ''sindicato'' social movement first suggested a move into the political arena in 1986. This was controversial, with many fearing that politicians would co-opt the movement for personal gain.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=83}} Morales began supporting the formation of a political wing in 1989, although a consensus in favor of its formation only emerged in 1993.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=84}} On March 27, 1995, at the 7th Congress of the [[Unique Confederation of Rural Laborers of Bolivia]] (''Confederaci\u00f3n Sindical \u00danica de Trabajadores Campesinos de Bolivia'' \u2013 CSUTCB), a \"political instrument\" (a term employed over \"political party\") was formed, named the [[Assembly for the Sovereignty of the Peoples]] (''Asamblea por la Sobern\u00eda de los Pueblos'' \u2013 ASP).{{sfnm|1a1=Harten|1y=2011|1p=84|2a1=Webber|2y=2011|2p=60}} At the ASP's 1st Congress, the CSUTCB participated alongside three other Bolivian unions, representing miners, peasants and indigenous peoples.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=84}} In 1996, Morales was appointed chairman of the Committee of the Six Federations of the Tropics of Cochabamba, a position that he retained until 2006.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=79}}\n\nBolivia's [[National Electoral Court of Bolivia|National Electoral Court]] (''Corte Nacional Electoral'' \u2013 CNE) refused to recognize the ASP, citing minor procedural infringements.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=84}} The coca activists circumvented this problem by running under the banner of the [[United Left (Bolivia)|United Left]] (IU), a coalition of leftist parties headed by the [[Communist Party of Bolivia]] (''Partido Comunista Boliviano'' \u2013 PCB).{{sfnm|1a1=Mu\u00f1oz-Pogossian|1y=2008|1p=24|2a1=Sivak|2y=2010|2p=79|3a1=Harten|3y=2011|3p=84|4a1=Webber|4y=2011|4p=60}} They won landslide victories in those areas which were local strongholds of the movement, producing 11 mayors and 49 municipal councilors.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=84}} Morales was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the [[Plurinational Legislative Assembly|National Congress]] as a representative for El Chapare, having secured 70.1% of the local vote.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=79}} In the [[1997 Bolivian legislative election|national elections of 1997]], the IU/ASP gained four seats in Congress, obtaining 3.7% of the national vote, with this rising to 17.5% in the department of Cochabamba.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=85}} The election resulted in the establishment of a coalition government led by the right-wing [[Nationalist Democratic Action]] (''Acci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica Nacionalista'' \u2013 ADN), with [[Hugo Banzer]] as President; Morales lambasted him as \"the worst politician in Bolivian history\".{{sfn|Sivak|2010|pp=79\u201380}}\n\n[[File:MAS XVI Anniversary Celebration.jpg|thumb|MAS-IPSP partisans celebrate the 16th anniversary of the IPSP party's founding in [[Sacaba]], [[Cochabamba Department|Cochabamba]].]]\nRising electoral success was accompanied by factional in-fighting, with a leadership contest emerging in the ASP between the incumbent [[Alejo V\u00e9liz]] and Morales, who had the electoral backing of the social movement's bases.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=85}} The conflict led to a schism, with Morales and his supporters splitting to form their own party, the Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples (''Instrumento Pol\u00edtico por la Soberan\u00eda de los Pueblos'' \u2013 IPSP).{{sfnm|1a1=Harten|1y=2011|1p=85|2a1=Webber|2y=2011|2p=60}} The movement's bases defected ''en masse'' to the IPSP, leaving the ASP to crumble and V\u00e9liz to join the center-right [[New Republican Force]] (''Nueva Fuerza Republicana'' \u2013 NFR), for which Morales denounced him as a traitor to the ''cocalero'' cause.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=86}} Continuing his activism, in 1998 Morales led another ''cocalero'' march from El Chapare to la Paz,{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=81}} and came under increasing criticism from the government, who repeatedly accused him of being involved in the cocaine trade and mocked him for how he spoke and his lack of education.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nMorales came to an agreement with [[David A\u00f1ez Pedraza]], the leader of a defunct yet still registered party named the Movement for Socialism (MAS); under this agreement, Morales and the Six Federaci\u00f3nes could take over the party name, with Pendraza stipulating the condition that they must maintain its own acronym, name and colors.

the global imagination\".{{sfn|Pearce|2011|p=xv}} Morales's government has been seen as part of the [[pink tide]] of left-leaning Latin American governments, becoming particularly associated with the hard left current of Venezuela and Cuba.{{sfnm|1a1=Pearce|1y=2011|1p=xv|2a1=Webber|2y=2011|2p=1}} It has been praised for its pro-socialist stance among the international left,{{sfn|Webber|2011|p=154}} who have taken an interest in Bolivia under his leadership as a \"political laboratory\"{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz-Pogossian|2008|p=1}} or \"a living workshop\" for the development of an alternative to capitalism.{{sfn|Farthing|Kohl|2014|p=5}} Domestically, Morales's support base has been among Bolivia's poor and indigenous communities.<ref name=\"BBC bio\"/> For these communities, who had felt marginalized in Bolivian politics for decades, Morales \"invokes a sense of dignity and destiny\" in a way that no other contemporary politician has done.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=227}} He has received the support of many [[democratic socialism|democratic socialists]] and [[social democracy|social democrats]], as well as sectors of Bolivia's liberal movement, who have been critical of Morales but favored him over the right-wing opposition.{{sfn|Webber|2011|pp=157\u201358}}\n\nBased on interviews conducted among Bolivians in 2012, John Crabtree and Ann Chaplin described the previous years of Morales's rule with the observation that: \"for many\u2014perhaps most\u2014Bolivians, this was a period when ordinary people felt the benefits of policy in ways that had not been the case for decades, if ever.\"{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}} Crabtree and Chaplin added that Morales's administration had made \"important changes... that will probably be difficult to reverse\", including poverty reduction, the removal of some regional inequalities, and side-lining of some previously dominant political actors in favor of others who had been encouraged and enabled by his government.{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}}\n\nCritics, particularly in the U.S. government, have varyingly termed him \"a left-wing radical, a partner of narco-traffickers and a terrorist\".{{sfn|Sivak|2011|p=173}} Opposition to Morales's governance has centered in the wealthy eastern lowland province of Santa Cruz.<ref name=\"BBC bio\"/> His policies often antagonized middle-class Bolivians, who deemed them too radical and argued that they threatened private property.<ref name=\"BBC bio\"/> His most vociferous critics have been from Bolivia's conservative movement, although he has also received criticism from the country's far left, who believe his reformist policies have been insufficiently radical or socialist.{{sfn|Webber|2011|pp=157\u201358}} Many of these leftist critics were unhappy that Morales's government did not make a total break with global capitalism.{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}} His government has also faced many of the same complaints directed at previous Bolivian administrations, revolving around such issues as \"concentration of power, corruption, incompetent bureaucracies, and disrespect for civil liberties\".{{sfn|Farthing|Kohl|2014|p=144}}\n\nCrabtree and Chaplin's study led them to conclude that while Morales's initial election had brought \"huge expectations\" from many Bolivians, especially in the social movements, there had been \"inevitable frustrations\" at his administration's inability to deliver on everything that they had hoped.{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=vii}} They thought that the \"heady optimism\" that had characterized Morales's first term in office had given way to \"a climate of questioning and growing criticism of the government and its policies\".{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}} Although the Bolivian economy had grown, the material benefits had not been as high as many Bolivians had hoped.{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}} Crabtree and Chaplin argued that the experiences of his administration had \"drawn attention to the difficulties involved in bringing change in the patterns of development in one of Latin America's poorest and most unequal nations\".{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=vi}} Similarly, Harten thought that Morales's discourse of \"the people\" against the socio-economic elites has brought a spotlight on the deep social polarization in Bolivia.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=229}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Domestic policy of Evo Morales]]\n* [[Foreign policy of Evo

[[President of Bolivia]] from 2006 to 2019. Widely regarded as the country's first president to come from its [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population,{{efn|Morales is described as the first indigenous president of Bolivia in academic studies of his presidency, such as those of Mu\u00f1oz-Pogossian,{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz-Pogossian|2008|p=180}} Webber,{{sfn|Webber|2011|p=1}} Philip and Panizza,{{sfn|Philip|Panizza|2011|p=57}} and Farthing and Kohl,{{sfn|Farthing|Kohl|2014|p=1}} as well as in press reports, such as those of [[BBC News]],<ref name=\"BBC bio\"/> However, there have been challenges to this claim by critics who have asserted that Morales probably has some European ancestry, and thus on genetic grounds is technically ''[[mestizo]]'' rather than solely indigenous.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=7}} Further, former president [[Enrique Pe\u00f1aranda]] was of substantially indigenous origin. Harten asserted that this argument was \"misguided[,] wrong[... and] above all irrelevant\" because regardless of his genetic makeup, the majority of Bolivians perceive Morales as being the first indigenous president.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=7}} In Bolivian society, indigeneity is a fluid concept rooted in cultural identity;{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=7}} for instance, many indigenous individuals that have settled in urban areas and abandoned their traditional rural customs have come to identify as ''mestizo''.{{sfn|Farthing|Kohl|2014|p=22}} }} his administration focused on the implementation of [[leftist]] policies, poverty reduction, and combating the influence of the [[United States]] and multinational corporations in Bolivia. A [[socialist]], he is the head of the [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement for Socialism]] (MAS) party.\n\n<!--Early life and political activism-->\nBorn to an [[Aymara people|Aymara]] family of [[subsistence farmers]] in Isallawi, [[Orinoca Canton]], Morales undertook a basic education before mandatory military service, in 1978 moving to [[Chapare Province]]. Growing [[coca]] and becoming a trade unionist, he rose to prominence in the ''[[Unique Confederation of Rural Laborers of Bolivia|campesino]]'' (\"rural laborers\") union. In that capacity, he campaigned against U.S. and Bolivian attempts to [[coca eradication|eradicate coca]] as part of the [[War on Drugs]], denouncing these as an [[imperialist]] violation of indigenous Andean culture. His involvement in anti-government [[direct action]] protests resulted in multiple arrests. Morales entered electoral politics in 1995, became the leader of the MAS, and was elected to [[Bolivian National Congress, 1997\u20132002|Congress]] in 1997. Coupled with [[populist]] rhetoric, his campaign focused on issues affecting indigenous and poor communities, advocating land reform and the more equal redistribution of gas wealth. He gained increased visibility through the [[Cochabamba Water War]] and [[Bolivian gas conflict|gas conflict]]. In 2002, he was expelled from Congress for encouraging anti-government protesters, although he came second in [[2002 Bolivian general election|that year's presidential election]].\n\n<!--Presidency-->\n[[2005 Bolivian general election|Once elected in 2005]], Morales increased taxation on the hydrocarbon industry to bolster social spending and emphasized projects to combat illiteracy, poverty, racism, and sexism. Vocally criticizing [[neoliberalism]], Morales' government moved Bolivia towards a [[mixed economy]], reduced its dependence on the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]], and oversaw strong economic growth. Scaling back U.S. influence in the country, he built relationships with leftist governments in the Latin American [[pink tide]]\u2014especially [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]]'s Venezuela and [[Fidel Castro]]'s Cuba\u2014and signed Bolivia into the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]]. His administration opposed the right-wing autonomist demands of [[media luna|Bolivia's eastern provinces]], won [[2008 Bolivian vote of confidence referendum|a 2008 recall referendum]], and instituted a [[Constitution of Bolivia|new constitution]] that established Bolivia as a [[plurinationalism|plurinational state]]. [[2009 Bolivian general election|Re-elected in 2009]] and [[2014 Bolivian general election|2014]], he oversaw Bolivia's admission to the [[Bank of the South]] and [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]] although his popularity was dented by attempts to abolish presidential [[term limits]]. Following the disputed [[2019 Bolivian general election|2019 general election]] and [[2019 Bolivian protests|the ensuing unrest]], [[Evo Morales government resignation|Morales agreed to military calls for his resignation]], after which he was granted [[Right of asylum|political asylum]], first in Mexico, then in Argentina. \n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nMorales was decorated with various international awards and received praise both for overseeing economic growth and for significantly reducing poverty and illiteracy in Bolivia. His supporters lauded him as a champion of [[indigenous rights]], [[anti-imperialism]], and [[environmentalism]]. He faced accusations that his defence of coca contributed to illegal [[cocaine]] production and that his calls for domestic protest represented [[sedition]] and [[terrorism]].\n\n==Early life and activism==\n===Childhood, education, and military service: 1959\u201378===\n\nMorales was born in the small rural village of Isallawi in [[Orinoca Canton]], part of western Bolivia's [[Oruro Department]], on October 26, 1959 to a family from the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] [[Aymara people]].<ref name=oct17bbc />{{sfnm|1a1=Harten|1y=2011|1p=35|2a1=Webber|2y=2011|2p=62}} One of seven children born to Dionisio Morales Choque and his wife Mar\u00eda Ayma Mamani,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.paginasiete.bo/amp/entrega-modulo-educativo-maria-ayma-dice-nunca-influyo-nombramiento-obras-137307.html | title=Evo entrega modulo educativo \"Maria Ayma\" y dice que nunca influy\u00f3 en nombramiento de obras - Diario Pagina Siete | access-date=January 26, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904084711/https://www.paginasiete.bo/amp/entrega-modulo-educativo-maria-ayma-dice-nunca-influyo-nombramiento-obras-137307.html | archive-date=September 4, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref> only he and two siblings, Esther and Hugo, survived past childhood.{{sfnm|1a1=Gutsch|1y=2006|2a1=Sivak|2y=2010|2p=32|3a1=Harten|3y=2011|3p=35}} His mother almost died from a [[Postpartum hemorrhage|postpartum haemorrhage]] following his birth.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=35}} In keeping with Aymara custom, his father buried the [[placenta]] produced after his birth in a place specially chosen for the occasion.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=35}} His childhood home was a traditional [[adobe]] house,{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=33}} and he grew up speaking the [[Aymara language]], although later commentators would remark that by the time he had become president he was no longer an entirely fluent speaker.{{sfnm|1a1=Sivak|1y=2010|1p=33|2a1=Harten|2y=2011|2p=7|3a1=Webber|3y=2011|3p=63}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Aymara ceremony copacabana 4.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Fishing boat Lake Poopo.jpg\n| width2 = 198\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Aymara in traditional dress (left); [[Poop\u00f3 Lake]] was the dominant geographical feature around Morales's home village of Isallawi (right).{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=35}}\n}}\n\nMorales's family were farmers; from an early age, he helped them to plant and harvest crops and guard their herd of llamas and sheep, taking a homemade soccer ball to amuse himself.{{sfnm|1a1=Sivak|1y=2010|1p=32|2a1=Harten|2y=2011|2p=35}} As a toddler, he briefly attended Orinoca's preparatory school, and at five began schooling at the single-room primary school in Isallawi.{{sfnm|1a1=Sivak|1y=2010|1pp=33\u201334|2a1=Harten|2y=2011|2p=36}} Aged 6, he spent six months in northern Argentina with his sister and father.

the global imagination\".{{sfn|Pearce|2011|p=xv}} Morales's government has been seen as part of the [[pink tide]] of left-leaning Latin American governments, becoming particularly associated with the hard left current of Venezuela and Cuba.{{sfnm|1a1=Pearce|1y=2011|1p=xv|2a1=Webber|2y=2011|2p=1}} It has been praised for its pro-socialist stance among the international left,{{sfn|Webber|2011|p=154}} who have taken an interest in Bolivia under his leadership as a \"political laboratory\"{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz-Pogossian|2008|p=1}} or \"a living workshop\" for the development of an alternative to capitalism.{{sfn|Farthing|Kohl|2014|p=5}} Domestically, Morales's support base has been among Bolivia's poor and indigenous communities.<ref name=\"BBC bio\"/> For these communities, who had felt marginalized in Bolivian politics for decades, Morales \"invokes a sense of dignity and destiny\" in a way that no other contemporary politician has done.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=227}} He has received the support of many [[democratic socialism|democratic socialists]] and [[social democracy|social democrats]], as well as sectors of Bolivia's liberal movement, who have been critical of Morales but favoured him over the right-wing opposition.{{sfn|Webber|2011|pp=157\u201358}}\n\nBased on interviews conducted among Bolivians in 2012, John Crabtree and Ann Chaplin described the previous years of Morales's rule with the observation that: \"for many\u2014perhaps most\u2014Bolivians, this was a period when ordinary people felt the benefits of policy in ways that had not been the case for decades, if ever.\"{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}} Crabtree and Chaplin added that Morales's administration had made \"important changes... that will probably be difficult to reverse\", including poverty reduction, the removal of some regional inequalities, and side-lining of some previously dominant political actors in favor of others who had been encouraged and enabled by his government.{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}}\n\nCritics, particularly in the U.S. government, have varyingly termed him \"a left-wing radical, a partner of narco-traffickers and a terrorist\".{{sfn|Sivak|2011|p=173}} Opposition to Morales's governance has centered in the wealthy eastern lowland province of Santa Cruz.<ref name=\"BBC bio\"/> His policies often antagonized middle-class Bolivians, who deemed them too radical and argued that they threatened private property.<ref name=\"BBC bio\"/> His most vociferous critics have been from Bolivia's conservative movement, although he has also received criticism from the country's far left, who believe his reformist policies have been insufficiently radical or socialist.{{sfn|Webber|2011|pp=157\u201358}} Many of these leftist critics were unhappy that Morales's government did not make a total break with global capitalism.{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}} His government has also faced many of the same complaints directed at previous Bolivian administrations, revolving around such issues as \"concentration of power, corruption, incompetent bureaucracies, and disrespect for civil liberties\".{{sfn|Farthing|Kohl|2014|p=144}}\n\nCrabtree and Chaplin's study led them to conclude that while Morales's initial election had brought \"huge expectations\" from many Bolivians, especially in the social movements, there had been \"inevitable frustrations\" at his administration's inability to deliver on everything that they had hoped.{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=vii}} They thought that the \"heady optimism\" that had characterized Morales's first term in office had given way to \"a climate of questioning and growing criticism of the government and its policies\".{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}} Although the Bolivian economy had grown, the material benefits had not been as high as many Bolivians had hoped.{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}} Crabtree and Chaplin argued that the experiences of his administration had \"drawn attention to the difficulties involved in bringing change in the patterns of development in one of Latin America's poorest and most unequal nations\".{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=vi}} Similarly, Harten thought that Morales's discourse of \"the people\" against the socio-economic elites has brought a spotlight on the deep social polarization in Bolivia.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=229}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Domestic policy of Evo Morales]]\n* [[Foreign policy of Evo

Ranging from the [[Norte Chico civilization]] starting in 3500 BC, the oldest civilization in the Americas and one of the five [[cradles of civilization]], to the [[Inca Empire]], the largest state in [[pre-Columbian]] America, the territory now including Peru has one of the longest histories of civilization of any country, tracing its heritage back to the 4th millennia BCE.\n\nThe [[Spanish Empire]] conquered the region in the 16th century and [[Viceroyalty of Peru|established a viceroyalty]] that encompassed most of its South American territories, with its capital in [[Lima]]. Peru formally proclaimed independence in 1821, and following the foreign military campaigns of [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], and the decisive [[battle of Ayacucho]], Peru [[Peruvian War of Independence|completed its independence in 1824]]. In the ensuing years, the country enjoyed relative [[Guano Era|economic and political stability]], which ended shortly before the [[War of the Pacific]] with Chile. Throughout the 20th century, Peru endured armed territorial disputes, coups, social unrest, and [[Internal conflict in Peru|internal conflicts]], as well as periods of stability and economic upswing. [[Alberto Fujimori]] was elected to the presidency in 1990; his government was credited with economically stabilizing Peru and successfully ending the [[Shining Path]] insurgency, though he was widely accused of [[human rights violations]] and suppression of political dissent. Fujimori left the presidency in 2000 and was charged with human rights violations and imprisoned until his pardon by President [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]] in 2017. Even after the president's regime, Fujimori's followers, called ''[[Fujimorism|Fujimoristas]]'', have caused political turmoil for any opposing faction in power, even causing Pedro Pablo Kuczynski to resign in March 2018.\n\nThe [[sovereign state]] of Peru is a [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic divided into [[Administrative divisions of Peru|25 regions]].

The Spanish conquest of Peru was one of the most important campaigns in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. After years of preliminary exploration and military conflicts, it was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting but ended in Spanish victory and colonization of the region known as the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] with its capital at [[Lima]], which was then known as \"La Ciudad de los Reyes\" (The City of Kings). The conquest of Peru led to spin-off campaigns throughout the viceroyalty as well as expeditions towards the Amazon Basin as in the case of Spanish efforts to quell Amerindian resistance. The last Inca resistance was suppressed when the Spaniards annihilated the [[Neo-Inca State]] in [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]] in 1572.\n\nThe indigenous population dramatically collapsed overwhelmingly due to epidemic diseases introduced by the Spanish as well as exploitation and socioeconomic change.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1992.tb01968.x|jstor=2563354|author=Lovell, W.

However, the Criollo oligarchy in Peru enjoyed privileges and remained loyal to the Spanish Crown. The liberation movement started in [[Argentina]] where autonomous juntas were created as a result of the loss of authority of the Spanish government over its colonies.\n\nAfter fighting for the independence of the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata, [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] created the [[Army of the Andes]] and [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes in 21 days]].

Immediately on 26 October they took control of the town of [[Pisco, Peru|Pisco]]. San Martin settled in [[Huacho]] on 12 November, where he established his headquarters while Cochrane sailed north blockading the port of [[Callao]] in [[Lima]]. At the same time in the north, [[Guayaquil]] was occupied by rebel forces under the command of Gregorio Escobedo. Because Peru was the stronghold of the Spanish government in South America, San Martin's strategy to liberate Peru was to use diplomacy. He sent representatives to Lima urging the [[Viceroy]] that Peru be granted independence, however all negotiations proved unsuccessful.\n\n[[File:Congreso 1822.jpg|thumb|left|[[Constituent Congress of Peru, 1822|First Constituent Congress of Peru]] in the chapel of the [[National University of San Marcos]] on 22 September 1822]]\n\nThe Viceroy of Peru, [[Joaqu\u00edn de la Pezuela, 1st Marquess of Viluma|Joaqu\u00edn de la Pazuela]] named [[Jos\u00e9 de la Serna e Hinojosa|Jos\u00e9 de la Serna]] commander-in-chief of the loyalist army to protect Lima from the threatened invasion of San Martin. On 29 January, de la Serna organized a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] against de la Pazuela which was recognized by Spain and he was named Viceroy of Peru. This internal power struggle contributed to the success of the liberating army. In order to avoid a military confrontation San Martin met the newly appointed viceroy, Jos\u00e9 de la Serna, and proposed to create a [[constitutional monarchy]], a proposal that was turned down. De la Serna abandoned the city and on 12 July 1821 San Martin occupied Lima and declared Peruvian independence on 28 July 1821. He created the first Peruvian flag. [[Alto Peru]] (Bolivia) remained as a Spanish stronghold until the army of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] liberated it three years later. Jos\u00e9 de San Martin was declared Protector of Peru.

Almost five years of war ended with the loss of the [[Tarapac\u00e1 Department (Peru)|department of Tarapac\u00e1]] and the provinces of [[Tacna Province|Tacna]] and [[Arica Province (Peru)|Arica]], in the Atacama region. Two outstanding military leaders throughout the war were [[Francisco Bolognesi]] and [[Miguel Grau Seminario|Miguel Grau]]. Originally Chile committed to a referendum for the cities of Arica and Tacna to be held years later, in order to self determine their national affiliation. However, Chile refused to apply the Treaty, and neither of the countries could determine the statutory framework. After the War of the Pacific, an extraordinary effort of rebuilding began.

In a military coup on 29 October 1948, General [[Manuel A. Odr\u00eda]] became president. Odr\u00eda's presidency was known as the ''Ochenio''. Momentarily pleasing the oligarchy and all others on the right, but followed a [[Populism|populist]] course that won him great favor with the poor and lower classes. A thriving economy allowed him to indulge in expensive but crowd-pleasing social policies.

However, widespread allegations of fraud prompted the Peruvian military to depose Prado and install a military junta, led by [[Ricardo P\u00e9rez Godoy]]. Godoy ran a short transitional government and held new elections in 1963, which were won by [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]] who assumed presidency until 1968. Bela\u00fande was recognized for his commitment to the [[democracy|democratic]] process. In 1968, the Armed Forces, led by General [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], staged a coup against Bela\u00fande. Alvarado's regime undertook radical reforms aimed at fostering development, but failed to gain widespread support. In 1975, General [[Francisco Morales-Berm\u00fadez]] forcefully replaced Velasco, paralyzed reforms, and oversaw the reestablishment of democracy.\n\n[[File:Zonas donde se ha registrado actividad de Sendero Luminoso.png|thumb|left|Areas where the [[Shining Path]] was active in Peru]]\n\nPeru engaged in a brief successful conflict with Ecuador in the [[Paquisha War]] as a result of territorial dispute between the two countries. After the country experienced [[chronic inflation]], the Peruvian currency, the [[Peruvian sol (1863\u20131985)|sol]], was replaced by the ''[[Inti (currency)|Inti]]'' in mid-1985, which itself was replaced by the [[Peruvian nuevo sol|nuevo sol]] in July 1991, at which time the new sol had a cumulative value of one billion old soles. The per capita annual income of Peruvians fell to $720 (below the level of 1960) and Peru's [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] dropped 20% at which national reserves were a negative $900 million. The economic turbulence of the time acerbated social tensions in Peru and partly contributed to the rise of violent rebel rural insurgent movements, like [[Shining Path|Sendero Luminoso]] (Shining Path) and [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]], which caused [[Internal conflict in Peru|great havoc]] throughout the country. Concerned about the economy, the increasing terrorist threat from Sendero Luminoso and MRTA, and allegations of official corruption, [[Alberto Fujimori]] assumed presidency in 1990. Fujimori implemented drastic measures that caused inflation to drop from 7,650% in 1990 to 139% in 1991.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nFaced with opposition to his reform efforts, Fujimori dissolved Congress in the ''[[auto-golpe]]'' (\"self-coup\") of 5 April 1992. He then revised the constitution; called new congressional elections; and implemented substantial economic reform, including privatization of numerous state-owned companies, creation of an investment-friendly climate, and sound management of the economy. Fujimori's administration was dogged by [[Insurgency|insurgent]] groups, most notably the Sendero Luminoso, who carried out terrorist campaigns across the country throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Fujimori cracked down on the insurgents and was successful in largely quelling them by the late 1990s, but the fight was marred by atrocities committed by both the Peruvian security forces and the insurgents: the [[Barrios Altos massacre]] and [[La Cantuta massacre]] by Government paramilitary groups, and the bombings of [[Tarata bombing|Tarata]] and [[Frecuencia Latina bombing|Frecuencia Latina]] by Sendero Luminoso.

Amerindians who live in the Andean highlands speak Quechua and Aymara and are ethnically distinct from the diverse indigenous groups who live on the eastern side of the Andes and in the tropical lowlands adjacent to the [[Amazon basin]]. Peru's distinct geographical regions are mirrored in a language divide between the coast where Spanish is more predominant over the Amerindian languages, and the more diverse traditional Andean cultures of the mountains and highlands. The indigenous populations east of the Andes speak various languages and dialects. Some of these groups still adhere to traditional indigenous languages, while others have been almost completely assimilated into the Spanish language. There has been an increasing and organized effort to teach Quechua in public schools in the areas where Quechua is spoken.

[[Peruvian arts|Peruvian artistic traditions]] date back to the elaborate pottery, textiles, jewelry, and sculpture of [[Pre-Inca cultures]]. The Incas maintained these crafts and made [[Architecture of Peru|architectural]] achievements including the construction of [[Machu Picchu]]. [[Baroque]] dominated colonial art, though modified by native traditions.<ref>Bailey, pp. 72\u201374.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, most art focused on religious subjects; the numerous churches of the era and the paintings of the [[Cusco School]] are representative.<ref>Bailey, p. 263.</ref> Arts stagnated after independence until the emergence of ''[[Indigenismo]]'' in the early 20th century.<ref name=\"Lucie\" /> Since the 1950s, Peruvian art has been [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] and shaped by both foreign and local art currents.\n\n===Visual Arts===\n{{Main|Peruvian art}}\nPeruvian art has its origin in the [[Peruvian Ancient Cultures|Andean civilizations]]. These [[Peruvian Ancient Cultures|civilizations]] rose in the territory of modern Peru before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|arrival of the Spanish]]. Peruvian art incorporated European elements after the Spanish conquest and continued to evolve throughout the centuries up on to the modern day.\n\n==== Pre-Columbian art ====\n\n[[File:A detail of the Raimondi Stela.png|thumb|left|A detail of the [[Raimondi Stela]]. This stela was found out of its original placement at the ceremonial complex, Chav\u00edn de Huantar]]\n\n[[File:Nariguera Moche2.JPG|thumb|Moche ''Nariguera'' depicting the Decapitator, gold with turquoise and [[chrysocolla]] inlays. Museo Oro del Peru, Lima]]\n\nPeru's earliest artwork came from the [[Cupisnique]] culture, which was concentrated on the Pacific coast, and the Chav\u00edn culture, which was largely north of [[Lima]] between the Andean mountain ranges of the [[Cordillera Negra]] and the [[Cordillera Blanca]]. Decorative work from this era, approximately the 9th century BCE, was symbolic and religious in nature. The artists worked with gold, silver and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] to create a variety of sculpture and relief carvings. These civilizations were also known for their [[architecture]] and wood sculpture.\n\nBetween the 9th century BC and the 2nd century CE, the [[Paracas culture|Paracas]] Cavernas and Paracas [[Necropolis]] cultures developed on the south coast of Peru. Paracas Cavernas produced complex polychrome and monochrome ceramics with religious representations. Burials from the Paracas Necropolis also yielded [https://web.archive.org/web/20080120151305/http://exchanges.state.gov/culprop/1peru/sect1.htm complex textiles], many produced with sophisticated geometric patterns.\n\nThe 3rd century BCE saw the flowering of the urban culture, [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], in the [[Lambayeque (Department of Peru)|Lambayeque]] region. The Mochica culture produced impressive architectural works, such as the [[Huaca del Sol|Huacas del Sol y de la Luna]] and the [[Huaca Rajada]] of [[Sip\u00e1n]]. They were experts at [[Terrace (agriculture)|cultivation in terraces]] and [[hydraulic engineering]] and produced original ceramics, textiles, pictorial and sculptural works.\n\nAnother urban culture, the [[Huari Culture|Wari civilization]], flourished between the 8th and 12th centuries in [[Ayacucho (Department of Peru)|Ayacucho]]. Their centralized town planning was extended to other areas, such as [[Pachacamac]], [[Cajamarquilla]] and [[Wari Willka]].\n\n[[File:Inca Quipu.jpg|thumb|left|250px|'Quipus' were recording devices fashioned from [[String (structure)|strings]] historically used by a number of cultures in the region of [[Andes|Andean]] [[South America]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Neuman |first=William |title=Untangling an Accounting Tool and an Ancient Inca Mystery|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/world/americas/untangling-an-accounting-tool-and-an-ancient-incan-mystery.html |date=2 January 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=8 January 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nBetween the 9th and 13th centuries CE, the military urban [[Tiwanaku]] empire rose by the borders of [[Lake Titicaca]]. Centered around a city of the same name in modern-day Bolivia, the Tiwanaku introduced stone architecture and sculpture of a monumental type. These works of [[architecture]] and art were made possible by the Tiwanaku's developing [[bronze]], which enabled them to make the necessary tools.\n\nUrban architecture reached a new height between the 14th and 15th centuries in the [[Chim\u00fa Culture]]. The Chim\u00fa built the city of [[Chan Chan]] in the valley of the [[Moche River]], in [[La Libertad (Department of Peru)|La Libertad]]. The Chim\u00fa were skilled [[goldsmith]]s and created remarkable works of [[hydraulic engineering]].\n\nThe [[Inca Empire|Inca Civilization]], which united Peru under its hegemony in the centuries immediately preceding the Spanish conquest, incorporated into their own works a great part of the cultural legacy of the civilizations which preceded it. Important relics of their artwork and architecture can be seen in cities like [[Cusco (Department of Peru)|Cusco]], architectural remains like [[Sacsayhuam\u00e1n|Sacsahuam\u00e1n]] and [[Machu Picchu]] and stone pavements that united Cusco with the rest of the Inca Empire.\n\n==== Colonial art ====\n{{Main|Peruvian colonial architecture|Cusco School}}\n[[File:Anonymous, Cuzco School, Peru - The Virgin of the Pilgrims and Child - Google Art Project.jpg|upright|thumb|''The Virgin of the [[Christian pilgrimage|Pilgrims]] and Child'', Anonymous [[Cusco School|Colonial Cusco School]] painting, 18th century]]\nPeruvian [[sculpture]] and [[painting]] began to define themselves from the [[Studio|ateliers]] founded by [[monk]]s, who were strongly influenced by the Sevillian Baroque School. In this context, the stalls of the [[Lima Cathedral|Cathedral]] choir, the fountain of the Main Square of [[Lima District|Lima]] both by [[Pedro de Noguera]], and a great part of the colonial production were registered. The first center of art established by the Spanish was the [[Cuzco School]] that taught [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] artists European painting styles. [[Diego Quispe Tito]] (1611\u20131681) was one of the first members of the Cuzco school and [[Marcos Zapata]] (1710\u20131773) was one of the last.<ref name=\"Bayon\" />\n\nPainting of this time reflected a synthesis of European and indigenous influences, as is evident in the portrait of prisoner Atahualpa, by D. de Mora or in the canvases of the Italians [[Mateo P\u00e9rez de Alesio]] and Angelino Medoro, the Spaniards Francisco Bejarano and J. de Illescas and the Creole J.

Spaniards introduced writing in the 16th century; colonial literary expression included [[chronicle]]s and [[Christian literature|religious literature]]. After independence, [[Costumbrism]] and [[Romanticism]] became the most common literary genres, as exemplified in the works of [[Ricardo Palma]].<ref>Martin, \"Literature, music and the visual arts, c. 1820\u20131870\", pp. 37\u201339.</ref> The early 20th century's ''Indigenismo'' movement was led by such writers as [[Ciro Alegr\u00eda]]<ref>Martin, \"Narrative since c. 1920\", pp. 151\u2013152.</ref> and [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arguedas]].<ref>Martin, \"Narrative since c. 1920\", pp. 178\u2013179.</ref> [[C\u00e9sar Vallejo]] wrote modernist and often politically engaged verse.

Without the familiar ingredients from their home countries, immigrants modified their traditional cuisines by using ingredients available in Peru. The four traditional staples of Peruvian cuisine are [[Maize|corn]], [[potato]]es and other [[tuber]]s, [[Amaranthaceae]]s ([[quinoa]], [[ka\u00f1iwa]] and [[kiwicha]]) and [[legume]]s ([[beans]] and [[lupins]]). Staples brought by the Spanish include [[rice]], [[wheat]] and meats (beef, pork and chicken). Many traditional foods\u2014such as [[quinoa]], [[kiwicha]], [[chili pepper]]s, and several roots and [[tuber]]s have increased in popularity in recent decades, reflecting a revival of interest in native Peruvian foods and culinary techniques. Chef [[Gaston Acurio]] has become well known for raising awareness of local ingredients.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{main|Peruvian music}}\n[[File:Marinera Norte\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|[[Marinera]] Norte\u00f1a]]\nPeruvian music has [[Andean music|Andean]], [[Music of Spain|Spanish]], and [[African Music|African]] roots.<ref>Romero, Ra\u00fal (1999). \"Andean Peru\".

The charango is member of the [[lute]] family of instruments and was invented during [[Viceroyalty of Peru|colonial times]] by musicians imitating the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[vihuela]]. In the Canas and [[Titicaca]] regions, the charango is used in courtship rituals, symbolically invoking [[mermaid]]s with the instrument to lure the woman to the male performers. Until the 1960s, the charango was denigrated as an instrument of the rural poor. After the revolution in 1959, which built upon the [[Indigenismo]] movement (1910\u20131940), the charango was popularized among other performers. Variants include the [[walaycho]], [[chillador]], [[chinlili]], and the larger and lower-tuned [[charangon]].\n\nWhile the Spanish [[guitar]] is widely played, so too is the Spanish-in-origin [[bandurria]]. Unlike the guitar, it has been transformed by Peruvian players over the years, changing from a 12-string, 6-course instrument to one having 12 to 16 strings in a mere four courses. [[Violins]] and [[harps]], also of European origin, are also played.\n\n=== Cinema ===\nWhile the Peruvian film industry has not been nearly as prolific as that of some other Latin American countries, some Peruvian movies produced enjoyed regional success. Historically, the cinema of Peru [[Cinema of Iquitos|began in Iquitos]] in 1932 by Antonio Wong Rengifo (with a momentous, initial [[Movie theater|film billboard]] from 1900) because the [[rubber boom]] and the intense arrival of foreigners with technology to the city, and thus continued an extensive, unique filmography, with a different style than the films made in the capital, Lima.\n\nPeru also produced the first animated 3-D film in [[Latin America]], ''[[Piratas en el Callao]]''. This film is set in the historical port city of [[Callao]], which during colonial times had to defend itself against attacks by Dutch and British privateers seeking to undercut Spain's trade with its colonies. The film was produced by the [[Peruvians|Peruvian]] company Alpamayo Entertainment, which made a second 3-D film one year later: ''Dragones: Destino de Fuego''.\n\nIn February 2006, the film ''[[Madeinusa]]'', produced as a joint venture between Peru and Spain and directed by [[Claudia Llosa]], was set in an imaginary Andean village and describes the stagnating life of Madeinusa performed by [[Magaly Solier]] and the traumas of post-civil war Peru.\n\nLlosa, who shared elements of [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]]'s [[magic realism]], won an award at the [[Rotterdam Film Festival]]. Llosa's second feature, [[The Milk of Sorrow]] (\"La Teta Asustada\"), was nominated for the [[82nd Academy Awards]] for Best Foreign Language Picture, the first Peruvian film in the Academy's history to be nominated. [[The Milk of Sorrow]] (\"La Teta Asustada\"), won the Golden Bear award at the 2009 Berlinale.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Peru}}\n*[[Outline of Peru]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n;Notes\n{{notelist}}\n;Citations\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Altroy\">D'Altroy, Terence (2002).

The Spanish conquest of Peru was one of the most important campaigns in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. After years of preliminary exploration and military conflicts, it was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting but ended in Spanish victory and colonization of the region known as the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] with its capital at [[Lima]], which was then known as \"La Ciudad de los Reyes\" (The City of Kings). The conquest of Peru led to spin-off campaigns throughout the viceroyalty as well as expeditions towards the Amazon Basin as in the case of Spanish efforts to quell Amerindian resistance. The last Inca resistance was suppressed when the Spaniards annihilated the [[Neo-Inca State]] in [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]] in 1572.\n\nThe indigenous population dramatically collapsed overwhelmingly due to epidemic diseases introduced by the Spanish as well as exploitation and socioeconomic change.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1992.tb01968.x|jstor=2563354|author=Lovell, W.

The liberation movement started in [[Argentina]] where autonomous juntas were created as a result of the loss of authority of the Spanish government over its colonies.\n\nAfter fighting for the independence of the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata, [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] created the [[Army of the Andes]] and [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes in 21 days]]. Once in Chile he joined forces with Chilean army General [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] and liberated the country in the battles of [[Battle of Chacabuco|Chacabuco]] and [[Battle of Maip\u00fa|Maip\u00fa]] in 1818.<ref>Scheina, 2003, ''Latin America's Wars: The Age of the Caudillo, 1791\u20131899'', p. 58.</ref> On 7 September 1820, a fleet of eight warships arrived in the port of [[Paracas (municipality)|Paracas]] under the command of general Jos\u00e9 de San Martin and [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas Cochrane]], who was serving in the Chilean Navy. Immediately on 26 October they took control of the town of [[Pisco, Peru|Pisco]]. San Martin settled in [[Huacho]] on 12 November, where he established his headquarters while Cochrane sailed north blockading the port of [[Callao]] in [[Lima]]. At the same time in the north, [[Guayaquil]] was occupied by rebel forces under the command of Gregorio Escobedo. Because Peru was the stronghold of the Spanish government in South America, San Martin's strategy to liberate Peru was to use diplomacy. He sent representatives to Lima urging the [[Viceroy]] that Peru be granted independence, however all negotiations proved unsuccessful.\n\n[[File:Congreso 1822.jpg|thumb|left|[[Constituent Congress of Peru, 1822|First Constituent Congress of Peru]] in the chapel of the [[National University of San Marcos]] on 22 September 1822]]\n\nThe Viceroy of Peru, [[Joaqu\u00edn de la Pezuela, 1st Marquess of Viluma|Joaqu\u00edn de la Pazuela]] named [[Jos\u00e9 de la Serna e Hinojosa|Jos\u00e9 de la Serna]] commander-in-chief of the loyalist army to protect Lima from the threatened invasion of San Martin. On 29 January, de la Serna organized a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] against de la Pazuela which was recognized by Spain and he was named Viceroy of Peru. This internal power struggle contributed to the success of the liberating army. In order to avoid a military confrontation San Martin met the newly appointed viceroy, Jos\u00e9 de la Serna, and proposed to create a [[constitutional monarchy]], a proposal that was turned down. De la Serna abandoned the city and on 12 July 1821 San Martin occupied Lima and declared Peruvian independence on 28 July 1821. He created the first Peruvian flag. [[Alto Peru]] (Bolivia) remained as a Spanish stronghold until the army of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] liberated it three years later. Jos\u00e9 de San Martin was declared Protector of Peru. Peruvian national identity was forged during this period, as Bolivarian projects for a [[Congress of Panama|Latin American Confederation]] floundered and a [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation|union with Bolivia]] proved ephemeral.<ref>Gootenberg (1991) p. 12.</ref>\n\n[[File:La Independencia del Per\u00fa.jpg|thumb|San Mart\u00edn proclaiming the independence of Peru. Painting by [[Juan Lepiani]].|alt=|220x220px]]Simon Bolivar launched his campaign from the north liberating the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] in the Battles of [[Battle of Carabobo|Carabobo]] in 1821 and [[Battle of Pichincha|Pichincha]] a year later. In July 1822 Bolivar and San Martin gathered in the [[Guayaquil Conference]]. Bolivar was left in charge of fully liberating Peru while San Martin retired from politics after the first parliament was assembled. The newly founded [[Congress of the Republic of Peru|Peruvian Congress]] named Bolivar dictator of Peru giving him the power to organize the military.\n\nWith the help of [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] they defeated the larger Spanish army in the [[Battle of Jun\u00edn]] on 6 August 1824 and the decisive [[Battle of Ayacucho]] on 9 December of the same year, consolidating the independence of Peru and Alto Peru. Alto Peru was later established as [[Bolivia]]. During the early years of the Republic, endemic struggles for power between military leaders caused political instability.<ref>Discover Peru (Peru cultural society).

Bolivia invoked its alliance with Peru against Chile. The [[Peruvian Government]] tried to mediate the dispute by sending a diplomatic team to negotiate with the Chilean government, but the committee concluded that war was inevitable. Chile declared war on 5 April 1879. Almost five years of war ended with the loss of the [[Tarapac\u00e1 Department (Peru)|department of Tarapac\u00e1]] and the provinces of [[Tacna Province|Tacna]] and [[Arica Province (Peru)|Arica]], in the Atacama region. Two outstanding military leaders throughout the war were [[Francisco Bolognesi]] and [[Miguel Grau Seminario|Miguel Grau]]. Originally Chile committed to a referendum for the cities of Arica and Tacna to be held years later, in order to self determine their national affiliation. However, Chile refused to apply the Treaty, and neither of the countries could determine the statutory framework. After the War of the Pacific, an extraordinary effort of rebuilding began. The government started to initiate a number of social and economic reforms in order to recover from the damage of the war. Political stability was achieved only in the early 1900s.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[File:Protocolo de R\u00edo.jpg|thumb|The signing of the [[Rio Protocol]] in January 1942]]\nInternal struggles after the war were followed by a period of stability under the [[Civilista Party]], which lasted until the onset of the authoritarian regime of [[Augusto B. Legu\u00eda]]. The [[Great Depression]] caused the downfall of Legu\u00eda, renewed political turmoil, and the emergence of the [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] (APRA).<ref>Klar\u00e9n, Peter (2000). ''Peru: society and nationhood in the Andes''. New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 262\u2013276, {{ISBN|0195069285}}.</ref> The rivalry between this organization and a coalition of the elite and the military defined Peruvian politics for the following three decades. A final peace treaty in 1929, signed between Peru and Chile called the [[Treaty of Lima]], returned [[Tacna]] to Peru. Between 1932 and 1933, Peru was engulfed in a [[Leticia Incident|year-long war with Colombia]] over a territorial dispute involving the [[Amazonas department]] and its capital [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]].\n\nLater, in 1941, Peru and [[Ecuador]] fought the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]], after which the [[Rio Protocol]] sought to formalize the boundary between those two countries. In a military coup on 29 October 1948, General [[Manuel A. Odr\u00eda]] became president. Odr\u00eda's presidency was known as the ''Ochenio''. Momentarily pleasing the oligarchy and all others on the right, but followed a [[Populism|populist]] course that won him great favor with the poor and lower classes. A thriving economy allowed him to indulge in expensive but crowd-pleasing social policies. At the same time, however, [[civil rights]] were severely restricted and [[political corruption|corruption]] was rampant throughout his regime. Odr\u00eda was succeeded by [[Manuel Prado Ugarteche]]. However, widespread allegations of fraud prompted the Peruvian military to depose Prado and install a military junta, led by [[Ricardo P\u00e9rez Godoy]]. Godoy ran a short transitional government and held new elections in 1963, which were won by [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]] who assumed presidency until 1968. Bela\u00fande was recognized for his commitment to the [[democracy|democratic]] process. In 1968, the Armed Forces, led by General [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], staged a coup against Bela\u00fande. Alvarado's regime undertook radical reforms aimed at fostering development, but failed to gain widespread support. In 1975, General [[Francisco Morales-Berm\u00fadez]] forcefully replaced Velasco, paralyzed reforms, and oversaw the reestablishment of democracy.\n\n[[File:Zonas donde se ha registrado actividad de Sendero Luminoso.png|thumb|left|Areas where the [[Shining Path]] was active in Peru]]\n\nPeru engaged in a brief successful conflict with Ecuador in the [[Paquisha War]] as a result of territorial dispute between the two countries. After the country experienced [[chronic inflation]], the Peruvian currency, the [[Peruvian sol (1863\u20131985)|sol]], was replaced by the ''[[Inti (currency)|Inti]]'' in mid-1985, which itself was replaced by the [[Peruvian nuevo sol|nuevo sol]] in July 1991, at which time the new sol had a cumulative value of one billion old soles. The per capita annual income of Peruvians fell to $720 (below the level of 1960) and Peru's [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] dropped 20% at which national reserves were a negative $900 million. The economic turbulence of the time acerbated social tensions in Peru and partly contributed to the rise of violent rebel rural insurgent movements, like [[Shining Path|Sendero Luminoso]] (Shining Path) and [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]], which caused [[Internal conflict in Peru|great havoc]] throughout the country. Concerned about the economy, the increasing terrorist threat from Sendero Luminoso and MRTA, and allegations of official corruption, [[Alberto Fujimori]] assumed presidency in 1990. Fujimori implemented drastic measures that caused inflation to drop from 7,650% in 1990 to 139% in 1991.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nFaced with opposition to his reform efforts, Fujimori dissolved Congress in the ''[[auto-golpe]]'' (\"self-coup\") of 5 April 1992. He then revised the constitution; called new congressional elections; and implemented substantial economic reform, including privatization of numerous state-owned companies, creation of an investment-friendly climate, and sound management of the economy. Fujimori's administration was dogged by [[Insurgency|insurgent]] groups, most notably the Sendero Luminoso, who carried out terrorist campaigns across the country throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Fujimori cracked down on the insurgents and was successful in largely quelling them by the late 1990s, but the fight was marred by atrocities committed by both the Peruvian security forces and the insurgents: the [[Barrios Altos massacre]] and [[La Cantuta massacre]] by Government paramilitary groups, and the bombings of [[Tarata bombing|Tarata]] and [[Frecuencia Latina bombing|Frecuencia Latina]] by Sendero Luminoso. Those incidents subsequently came to symbolize the [[Human rights in Peru|human rights]] violations committed in the last years of violence.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDuring early 1995, once again Peru and Ecuador clashed in the [[Cenepa War]], but in 1998 the governments of both nations signed a peace treaty that clearly demarcated the international boundary between them. In November 2000, Fujimori resigned from office and went into a self-imposed [[exile]], avoiding prosecution for human rights violations and corruption charges by the new Peruvian authorities.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 21st century, Odebrecht Scandal, and political issues===\n{{Main|Operation Car Wash|2017-20 Peruvian political crisis|2019 Peruvian constitutional crisis}}\nSince the end of the Fujimori regime, Peru has tried to fight corruption while sustaining economic growth.<ref name=\":0\">''The Economist'' (17 October 2007), ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20080410185845/http://www.economist.com/research/backgrounders/displaybackgrounder.cfm?bg=709221 Peru].''</ref> In spite of human rights progress since the time of insurgency, many problems are still visible and show the continued marginalization of those who suffered through the violence of the Peruvian conflict.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=White |first=Gavin David |date=2009 |title=Displacement, decentralisation and reparation in post-conflict Peru |url=http://www.fmreview.org/protracted/white.html|journal=Forced Migration Review}}</ref> A caretaker government presided over by [[Valent\u00edn Paniagua]] took on the responsibility of conducting new presidential and congressional elections.

[[Baroque]] dominated colonial art, though modified by native traditions.<ref>Bailey, pp. 72\u201374.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, most art focused on religious subjects; the numerous churches of the era and the paintings of the [[Cusco School]] are representative.<ref>Bailey, p. 263.</ref> Arts stagnated after independence until the emergence of ''[[Indigenismo]]'' in the early 20th century.<ref name=\"Lucie\" /> Since the 1950s, Peruvian art has been [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] and shaped by both foreign and local art currents.\n\n===Visual Arts===\n{{Main|Peruvian art}}\nPeruvian art has its origin in the [[Peruvian Ancient Cultures|Andean civilizations]]. These [[Peruvian Ancient Cultures|civilizations]] rose in the territory of modern Peru before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|arrival of the Spanish]]. Peruvian art incorporated European elements after the Spanish conquest and continued to evolve throughout the centuries up on to the modern day.\n\n==== Pre-Columbian art ====\n\n[[File:A detail of the Raimondi Stela.png|thumb|left|A detail of the [[Raimondi Stela]]. This stela was found out of its original placement at the ceremonial complex, Chav\u00edn de Huantar]]\n\n[[File:Nariguera Moche2.JPG|thumb|Moche ''Nariguera'' depicting the Decapitator, gold with turquoise and [[chrysocolla]] inlays. Museo Oro del Peru, Lima]]\n\nPeru's earliest artwork came from the [[Cupisnique]] culture, which was concentrated on the Pacific coast, and the Chav\u00edn culture, which was largely north of [[Lima]] between the Andean mountain ranges of the [[Cordillera Negra]] and the [[Cordillera Blanca]]. Decorative work from this era, approximately the 9th century BCE, was symbolic and religious in nature. The artists worked with gold, silver and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] to create a variety of sculpture and relief carvings. These civilizations were also known for their [[architecture]] and wood sculpture.\n\nBetween the 9th century BC and the 2nd century CE, the [[Paracas culture|Paracas]] Cavernas and Paracas [[Necropolis]] cultures developed on the south coast of Peru. Paracas Cavernas produced complex polychrome and monochrome ceramics with religious representations. Burials from the Paracas Necropolis also yielded [https://web.archive.org/web/20080120151305/http://exchanges.state.gov/culprop/1peru/sect1.htm complex textiles], many produced with sophisticated geometric patterns.\n\nThe 3rd century BCE saw the flowering of the urban culture, [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], in the [[Lambayeque (Department of Peru)|Lambayeque]] region. The Mochica culture produced impressive architectural works, such as the [[Huaca del Sol|Huacas del Sol y de la Luna]] and the [[Huaca Rajada]] of [[Sip\u00e1n]]. They were experts at [[Terrace (agriculture)|cultivation in terraces]] and [[hydraulic engineering]] and produced original ceramics, textiles, pictorial and sculptural works.\n\nAnother urban culture, the [[Huari Culture|Wari civilization]], flourished between the 8th and 12th centuries in [[Ayacucho (Department of Peru)|Ayacucho]]. Their centralized town planning was extended to other areas, such as [[Pachacamac]], [[Cajamarquilla]] and [[Wari Willka]].\n\n[[File:Inca Quipu.jpg|thumb|left|250px|'Quipus' were recording devices fashioned from [[String (structure)|strings]] historically used by a number of cultures in the region of [[Andes|Andean]] [[South America]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Neuman |first=William |title=Untangling an Accounting Tool and an Ancient Inca Mystery|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/world/americas/untangling-an-accounting-tool-and-an-ancient-incan-mystery.html |date=2 January 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=8 January 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nBetween the 9th and 13th centuries CE, the military urban [[Tiwanaku]] empire rose by the borders of [[Lake Titicaca]]. Centered around a city of the same name in modern-day Bolivia, the Tiwanaku introduced stone architecture and sculpture of a monumental type. These works of [[architecture]] and art were made possible by the Tiwanaku's developing [[bronze]], which enabled them to make the necessary tools.\n\nUrban architecture reached a new height between the 14th and 15th centuries in the [[Chim\u00fa Culture]]. The Chim\u00fa built the city of [[Chan Chan]] in the valley of the [[Moche River]], in [[La Libertad (Department of Peru)|La Libertad]]. The Chim\u00fa were skilled [[goldsmith]]s and created remarkable works of [[hydraulic engineering]].\n\nThe [[Inca Empire|Inca Civilization]], which united Peru under its hegemony in the centuries immediately preceding the Spanish conquest, incorporated into their own works a great part of the cultural legacy of the civilizations which preceded it. Important relics of their artwork and architecture can be seen in cities like [[Cusco (Department of Peru)|Cusco]], architectural remains like [[Sacsayhuam\u00e1n|Sacsahuam\u00e1n]] and [[Machu Picchu]] and stone pavements that united Cusco with the rest of the Inca Empire.\n\n==== Colonial art ====\n{{Main|Peruvian colonial architecture|Cusco School}}\n[[File:Anonymous, Cuzco School, Peru - The Virgin of the Pilgrims and Child - Google Art Project.jpg|upright|thumb|''The Virgin of the [[Christian pilgrimage|Pilgrims]] and Child'', Anonymous [[Cusco School|Colonial Cusco School]] painting, 18th century]]\nPeruvian [[sculpture]] and [[painting]] began to define themselves from the [[Studio|ateliers]] founded by [[monk]]s, who were strongly influenced by the Sevillian Baroque School. In this context, the stalls of the [[Lima Cathedral|Cathedral]] choir, the fountain of the Main Square of [[Lima District|Lima]] both by [[Pedro de Noguera]], and a great part of the colonial production were registered. The first center of art established by the Spanish was the [[Cuzco School]] that taught [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] artists European painting styles. [[Diego Quispe Tito]] (1611\u20131681) was one of the first members of the Cuzco school and [[Marcos Zapata]] (1710\u20131773) was one of the last.<ref name=\"Bayon\" />\n\nPainting of this time reflected a synthesis of European and indigenous influences, as is evident in the portrait of prisoner Atahualpa, by D. de Mora or in the canvases of the Italians [[Mateo P\u00e9rez de Alesio]] and Angelino Medoro, the Spaniards Francisco Bejarano and J. de Illescas and the Creole J. Rodriguez.\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, the [[Baroque]] Style also dominated the field of [[plastic arts]].\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{main|Peruvian literature}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| total_width = 220\n| image1 = Mario Vargas Llosa (crop 2).jpg\n| caption1 = [[Mario Vargas Llosa]]\n| image2 = Retrato del Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (10949628505).jpg\n| caption2 = [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]]\n}}\nThe term Peruvian literature not only refers to literature produced in the independent Republic of Peru, but also to literature produced in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] during the country's colonial period, and to [[Oral tradition|oral]] artistic forms created by diverse ethnic groups that existed in the area during the [[Prehispanic#South America|prehispanic period]], such as the [[Quechua people|Quechua]], the [[Aymara people|Aymara]] and the [[Chanka]] people.\n\nPeruvian literature is rooted in the oral traditions of [[pre-Columbian]] civilizations. Spaniards introduced writing in the 16th century; colonial literary expression included [[chronicle]]s and [[Christian literature|religious literature]]. After independence, [[Costumbrism]] and [[Romanticism]] became the most common literary genres, as exemplified in the works of [[Ricardo Palma]].<ref>Martin, \"Literature, music and the visual arts, c. 1820\u20131870\", pp. 37\u201339.</ref> The early 20th century's ''Indigenismo'' movement was led by such writers as [[Ciro Alegr\u00eda]]<ref>Martin, \"Narrative since c. 1920\", pp. 151\u2013152.</ref> and [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arguedas]].<ref>Martin, \"Narrative since c. 1920\", pp. 178\u2013179.</ref> [[C\u00e9sar Vallejo]] wrote modernist and often politically engaged verse.

Modern indigenous Peruvian food mainly consists of corn, potatoes, and [[Chili pepper|chilies]]. There are now more than 3,000 kinds of potatoes grown on Peruvian terrain, according to Peru's Instituto Peruano de la Papa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://guide.michelin.com/sg/features/7-things-you-need-to-know-about-peruvian-cuisine/news|title=7 Things You Need to Know about Peruvian Cuisine|website=MICHELIN Guide}}</ref>\nModern [[Peruvian cuisine]] blends [[Native American cuisine#Native American cuisine of South America|Amerindian]] and [[Spanish food]] with strong influences from Chinese, African, Arab, Italian, and Japanese cooking.<ref>Custer, pp. 17\u201322.</ref> Common dishes include ''[[anticuchos]]'', ''[[ceviche]]'', and ''[[pachamanca]]''.

Without the familiar ingredients from their home countries, immigrants modified their traditional cuisines by using ingredients available in Peru. The four traditional staples of Peruvian cuisine are [[Maize|corn]], [[potato]]es and other [[tuber]]s, [[Amaranthaceae]]s ([[quinoa]], [[ka\u00f1iwa]] and [[kiwicha]]) and [[legume]]s ([[beans]] and [[lupins]]). Staples brought by the Spanish include [[rice]], [[wheat]] and meats (beef, pork and chicken). Many traditional foods\u2014such as [[quinoa]], [[kiwicha]], [[chili pepper]]s, and several roots and [[tuber]]s have increased in popularity in recent decades, reflecting a revival of interest in native Peruvian foods and culinary techniques. Chef [[Gaston Acurio]] has become well known for raising awareness of local ingredients.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{main|Peruvian music}}\n[[File:Marinera Norte\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|[[Marinera]] Norte\u00f1a]]\nPeruvian music has [[Andean music|Andean]], [[Music of Spain|Spanish]], and [[African Music|African]] roots.<ref>Romero, Ra\u00fal (1999). \"Andean Peru\". In: John Schechter (ed.), ''Music in Latin American culture: regional tradition''. New York: Schirmer Books, pp.&nbsp;385\u2013386.</ref> In pre-Hispanic times, musical expressions varied widely in each region; the ''[[quena]]'' and the ''[[tinya]]'' were two common instruments.<ref name=\"Olsen\" /> Spaniards introduced new instruments, such as the guitar and the harp, which led to the development of crossbred instruments like the ''[[charango]]''.<ref name=\"Turino\" /> African contributions to Peruvian music include its rhythms and the ''[[Cajon|caj\u00f3n]]'', a percussion instrument. [[Peruvian folk dances]] include [[marinera]], [[tondero]], [[zamacueca]], [[diablada]] and [[huayno]].<ref>Romero, Ra\u00fal (1985). \"La m\u00fasica tradicional y popular\". In: Patronato Popular y Porvenir, ''La m\u00fasica en el Per\u00fa''. Lima: Industrial Gr\u00e1fica, pp.&nbsp;pp. 243\u2013245, 261\u2013265.</ref>\n\nPeruvian music is dominated by the national [[Musical instrument|instrument]], the [[charango]]. The charango is member of the [[lute]] family of instruments and was invented during [[Viceroyalty of Peru|colonial times]] by musicians imitating the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[vihuela]]. In the Canas and [[Titicaca]] regions, the charango is used in courtship rituals, symbolically invoking [[mermaid]]s with the instrument to lure the woman to the male performers. Until the 1960s, the charango was denigrated as an instrument of the rural poor. After the revolution in 1959, which built upon the [[Indigenismo]] movement (1910\u20131940), the charango was popularized among other performers. Variants include the [[walaycho]], [[chillador]], [[chinlili]], and the larger and lower-tuned [[charangon]].\n\nWhile the Spanish [[guitar]] is widely played, so too is the Spanish-in-origin [[bandurria]]. Unlike the guitar, it has been transformed by Peruvian players over the years, changing from a 12-string, 6-course instrument to one having 12 to 16 strings in a mere four courses. [[Violins]] and [[harps]], also of European origin, are also played.\n\n=== Cinema ===\nWhile the Peruvian film industry has not been nearly as prolific as that of some other Latin American countries, some Peruvian movies produced enjoyed regional success. Historically, the cinema of Peru [[Cinema of Iquitos|began in Iquitos]] in 1932 by Antonio Wong Rengifo (with a momentous, initial [[Movie theater|film billboard]] from 1900) because the [[rubber boom]] and the intense arrival of foreigners with technology to the city, and thus continued an extensive, unique filmography, with a different style than the films made in the capital, Lima.\n\nPeru also produced the first animated 3-D film in [[Latin America]], ''[[Piratas en el Callao]]''. This film is set in the historical port city of [[Callao]], which during colonial times had to defend itself against attacks by Dutch and British privateers seeking to undercut Spain's trade with its colonies. The film was produced by the [[Peruvians|Peruvian]] company Alpamayo Entertainment, which made a second 3-D film one year later: ''Dragones: Destino de Fuego''.\n\nIn February 2006, the film ''[[Madeinusa]]'', produced as a joint venture between Peru and Spain and directed by [[Claudia Llosa]], was set in an imaginary Andean village and describes the stagnating life of Madeinusa performed by [[Magaly Solier]] and the traumas of post-civil war Peru.\n\nLlosa, who shared elements of [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]]'s [[magic realism]], won an award at the [[Rotterdam Film Festival]]. Llosa's second feature, [[The Milk of Sorrow]] (\"La Teta Asustada\"), was nominated for the [[82nd Academy Awards]] for Best Foreign Language Picture, the first Peruvian film in the Academy's history to be nominated. [[The Milk of Sorrow]] (\"La Teta Asustada\"), won the Golden Bear award at the 2009 Berlinale.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Peru}}\n*[[Outline of Peru]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n;Notes\n{{notelist}}\n;Citations\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Altroy\">D'Altroy, Terence (2002).

The university offers [[associate degree|associate]], [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[master's degree|master's]], and [[PhD]] degree programs in arts, sciences, aviation, business, and engineering.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University#History}}\nEmbry-Riddle began in 1925 as the '''Embry-Riddle Company''', an aircraft dealer and airmail provider, founded by [[Talton Higbee Embry]] and [[John Paul Riddle]] in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]. Embry-Riddle was eventually incorporated into what is now [[American Airlines]], before reforming during the buildup to [[World War II]] in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] as the '''Embry-Riddle School of Aviation''', and later, the '''Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Institute'''. Embry-Riddle moved to [[Daytona Beach]], [[Florida]] in 1965 and was renamed Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in 1970.\n\n==Campus==\n[[Image:ERAU WrightFlyer.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The Wright Flyer statue is the centerpiece of the Daytona Beach campus. The Jack. R. Hunt Memorial Library is visible in the background.]]\nThis 185 [[acre]] (748,671 m\u00b2) site has been the home to Embry-Riddle since 1965. Built adjacent to the [[Daytona Beach International Airport]], the campus has easy access for [[flight training]]. The main campus consists of an aviation complex, academic quad and residence halls surrounding the student center and Jack R. Hunt Aviator Park. Athletic facilities are located across Clyde Morris Blvd., anchored by the ICI Center.\n\nThe university owns {{convert|140|acre|km2}} directly south of the main campus that is developed into a research park. The cornerstone building, the John Mica Engineering and Aerospace Innovation Complex (MicaPlex) was opened in May 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.erau.edu/headlines/micaplex-debut-kicks-off-with-announcement-of-new-tenant-ready-to-hir-scholarship-endowment/|title=MicaPlex Debut Kicks Off with Announcement of New Tenant, Scholarship and Business Incubator|work=Embry-Riddle Newsroom|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-US}}</ref> An additional building for a subsonic [[wind tunnel]] is currently under construction at the same site.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.erau.edu/headlines/crews-break-ground-on-wind-tunnel-building-at-embry-riddle-research-park/|title=Crews Break Ground on Wind Tunnel Building at Embry-Riddle Research Park|work=Embry-Riddle Newsroom|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-US}}</ref> An upper classman residence, the Chanute Complex, is approximately two miles south of the main campus.\n\n===Academic buildings===\n;Lehman Engineering and Technology Center\n\nEngineering classes and facilities (such as the Thermojet solid model printer, the 3024-core [[Cray]] CS400 supercomputer \"Vega\" and [[wind tunnel]]s) are concentrated in the Lehman Engineering and Technology Center, built in 1995 to facilitate hands-on training in various engineering practices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://erau.edu/research/resources/high-performance-computing/|title=High Performance Computing {{!}} Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University|website=erau.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}</ref> The three-story facility also includes a number of classrooms and offices for departments within the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Engineering.

Opened in 2002, the building houses FAA testing facilities, a flight tutoring lab, weather labs, a [[spatial disorientation]] simulator, [[air safety]] lab, [[TRACON]] and en route air traffic control simulators as well as a [[control tower]] simulator.\n\nThe Flight Operations building is the home to the flight department. It houses flight dispatch, safety, records, scheduling, chief pilot's, team leaders, ip offices, oral and debrief rooms, and a classroom. It stands out from the rest of the campus because of its tower that houses the flight supervisors office and an interior observation deck.\n\nThe Emil Buehler College of Maintenance building is a new 3 story building that houses many maintenance labs and is located in-between the flight operations building and the AMS hangar complex.\n\nThe Advanced Flight Simulation Center houses 14 simulators: eight level-six Cessna 172 NAV III simulators, two Diamond DA42 Twinstar simulators, one [[Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet]] (CRJ) level-six simulator, and 2 Redbird Crosswind Trainers. The full-motion [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80/MD-90|MD-90]] simulator was recently sold and removed from the west sim bay. The simulation center also houses a number of classrooms and offices. This building was badly damaged in the Christmas Day Tornado of 2006 and became fully operational again in June 2007.\n\nThe completed complex includes a replacement for the hangar that was destroyed in the [[Tornadoes of 2006#December 25|tornado]] Christmas Day 2006.\n\n[[Image:ERAU CoB.png|thumb|right|David O'Maley College of Business]]\n;David O'Maley College of Business building\nThe David O'Maley College of Business building, located next to the College of Aviation building, houses the College of Business as well as the largest computer lab on campus and four relatively large classrooms.

There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the processing of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley County Borough|Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire.\n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established as an administrative and defensive unit in 918,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> to take into account the estates held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]] and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], London and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation. A second report known as the ''West Midlands General Review'' looked into the administrative authorities within the wider [[West Midlands (region)|region]], including the remainder of Worcestershire.<ref>Local Government Commission for England: Report No 2. West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 6). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled \"Hands off Halesowen\" orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the \"Halesowen Independence Committee\" helped stop the plans.<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk Black Country Bugle] [http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html Hands off Halesowen \u2013 Town's 1960 Campaign For Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814151133/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html |date=14 August 2014 }} \u2013 Retrieved 13 August 2014</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the second report into the West Midland General Review area was also delivered in July 1961 and a proposal for Worcester to lose its county borough status<ref>The British Medical Journal \u2013 Vol. 1, No. 5242, 24 June 1961 \"Local Government Commission's Reports on West Midlands\"</ref> was not implemented.<ref>\"How Local government Areas Stand Today\", The Times, 12 February 1966</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Order 1965===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 250\n| image1 = West_Midlands_Order_1965.png\n| caption1 =  Fig 7: The boundaries of South Staffordshire, West Warwickshire and North Worcestershire after the local government reorganisations of the 1960s.\n| image2 = Warley map.png\n| caption2 = The County Borough of Warley \u2013 Warley's boundaries are shown as blue.

There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the processing of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley County Borough|Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire.\n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established as an administrative and defensive unit in 918,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> to take into account the estates held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]] and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], London and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation. A second report known as the ''West Midlands General Review'' looked into the administrative authorities within the wider [[West Midlands (region)|region]], including the remainder of Worcestershire.<ref>Local Government Commission for England: Report No 2. West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 6). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled \"Hands off Halesowen\" orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the \"Halesowen Independence Committee\" helped stop the plans.<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk Black Country Bugle] [http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html Hands off Halesowen \u2013 Town's 1960 Campaign For Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814151133/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html |date=14 August 2014 }} \u2013 Retrieved 13 August 2014</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the second report into the West Midland General Review area was also delivered in July 1961 and a proposal for Worcester to lose its county borough status<ref>The British Medical Journal \u2013 Vol. 1, No. 5242, 24 June 1961 \"Local Government Commission's Reports on West Midlands\"</ref> was not implemented.<ref>\"How Local government Areas Stand Today\", The Times, 12 February 1966</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Order 1965===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 250\n| image1 = West_Midlands_Order_1965.png\n| caption1 =  Fig 7: The boundaries of South Staffordshire, West Warwickshire and North Worcestershire after the local government reorganisations of the 1960s.\n| image2 = Warley map.png\n| caption2 = The County Borough of Warley \u2013 Warley's boundaries are shown as blue.
