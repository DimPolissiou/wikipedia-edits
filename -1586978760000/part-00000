One day, Ray, a boy she has a crush on, asks her out. As Susie walks home through a cornfield, she runs into her neighbor, George Harvey, who coaxes her into an underground \"kid's hideout\" he has built. Inside, Susie grows uncomfortable and attempts to leave; George grabs her and the scene fades until she is seen rushing past her alarmed classmate Ruth Connors, seemingly fleeing Harvey's den.\n\nThe Salmons become worried when Susie fails to return home from school. Her father, Jack, searches for her, while her mother, Abigail, waits for the police. In town, Susie sees Jack, who does not respond to her when she calls. Susie runs home to find Harvey soaking in a bathtub. After seeing the bloody bathroom and her bracelet hanging on the sink faucet, Susie realizes she never escaped the underground den and Harvey murdered her. Screaming, she is pulled into the \"[[Limbo|In-Between]]\", that is neither Heaven nor Earth. From there, Susie watches over her loved ones, and resists her new afterlife friend Holly's urging her to let go.\n\nInvestigating Susie's disappearance with Detective Fenerman, Jack believes Susie was murdered by someone she knew. He researches neighbors and eventually suspects Harvey is the killer. Fenerman is unable to find proof, as Harvey has carefully concealed the evidence. Susie's sister, Lindsey, agrees with Jack's suspicions, but their casework takes a toll on Abigail. Abigail's alcoholic mother, Lynn, moves into the house. Feeling alienated from her husband, Abigail goes to California. Susie, in her afterlife, learns that Harvey, who has targeted Lindsey as his next victim, has murdered six other girls, including Holly, and that he stuffed Susie's body into a large safe in his basement.\n\nOne night, Jack, carrying a baseball bat, trails Harvey into the cornfield. However, Jack accidentally stumbles across a teen couple. The boy, thinking they will be assaulted, nearly bludgeons Jack to death as Harvey watches nearby. As Jack recuperates, Lindsey breaks into Harvey's house looking for evidence that he killed Susie. Upstairs, she finds a notebook containing a sketch of the underground den, a lock of Susie's hair, and news articles about Susie's disappearance. Harvey returns and almost catches Lindsey, but she escapes and rushes home to discover that her mother has returned. She gives the notebook to her grandmother, who contacts the police. Harvey has already fled his home &ndash; taking the safe containing Susie's body with him.\n\nSusie's afterlife begins expanding into a larger heaven, and she is greeted by Harvey's other victims&mdash;now showing nine, including Susie. She resists Holly urging her to enter Heaven along with the others, claiming she has one final thing to do. Meanwhile, Susie's classmates Ruth and Ray are present when Harvey drives up to dispose of the safe at a sinkhole dump site on the Conners' property. Susie returns to Earth and [[Spirit possession|enters Ruth's body]], causing Ruth to faint. Ray rushes to Ruth's aid only to realize she has become Susie. They kiss, completing Susie's last wish, and she returns to Heaven. Meanwhile, Harvey dumps the safe in the sinkhole, leaving it to disappear in the muddy water as he drives away.\n\nSometime later, Harvey meets a young woman outside a diner and offers her a ride, but she rebuffs him and leaves. A large icicle falls from an overhead branch, hitting Harvey's shoulder, causing him to fall backward over a steep cliff to his death. Time passes, and Susie sees that her family is healing, which Susie refers to as \"the lovely bones\" that grew around her absence. Susie finally enters Heaven, telling the audience: \"My name is Salmon, like the fish; first name Susie. I was 14 years old when I was murdered on December 6, 1973. I was here for a moment and then I was gone.

The screenplay by [[Fran Walsh]], [[Philippa Boyens]], and Jackson was based on [[Alice Sebold]]\u2019s award-winning and bestselling [[The Lovely Bones|2002 novel of the same name]].

One day, Ray, a boy she has a crush on, asks her out. As Susie walks home through a cornfield, she runs into her neighbor, George Harvey, who coaxes her into an underground \"kid's hideout\" he has built. Inside, Susie grows uncomfortable and attempts to leave; George grabs her and the scene fades until she is seen rushing past her alarmed classmate Ruth Connors, seemingly fleeing Harvey's den.\n\nThe Salmons become worried when Susie fails to return home from school. Her father, Jack, searches for her, while her mother, Abigail, waits for the police. In town, Susie sees Jack, who does not respond to her when she calls. Susie runs home to find Harvey soaking in a bathtub. After seeing the bloody bathroom and her bracelet hanging on the sink faucet, Susie realizes she never escaped the underground den and Harvey murdered her. Screaming, she is pulled into the \"[[Limbo|In-Between]]\", that is neither Heaven nor Earth. From there, Susie watches over her loved ones, and resists her new afterlife friend Holly's urging her to let go.\n\nInvestigating Susie's disappearance with Detective Fenerman, Jack believes Susie was murdered by someone she knew. He researches neighbors and eventually suspects Harvey is the killer. Fenerman is unable to find proof, as Harvey has carefully concealed the evidence. Susie's sister, Lindsey, agrees with Jack's suspicions, but their casework takes a toll on Abigail. Abigail's alcoholic mother, Lynn, moves into the house. Feeling alienated from her husband, Abigail goes to California. Susie, in her afterlife, learns that Harvey, who has targeted Lindsey as his next victim, has murdered six other girls, including Holly, and that he stuffed Susie's body into a large safe in his basement.\n\nOne night, Jack, carrying a baseball bat, trails Harvey into the cornfield. However, Jack accidentally stumbles across a teen couple. The boy, thinking they will be assaulted, nearly bludgeons Jack to death as Harvey watches nearby. As Jack recuperates, Lindsey breaks into Harvey's house looking for evidence that he killed Susie. Upstairs, she finds a notebook containing a sketch of the underground den, a lock of Susie's hair, and news articles about Susie's disappearance. Harvey returns and almost catches Lindsey, but she escapes and rushes home to discover that her mother has returned. She gives the notebook to her grandmother, who contacts the police. Harvey has already fled his home &ndash; taking the safe containing Susie's body with him.\n\nSusie's afterlife begins expanding into a larger heaven, and she is greeted by Harvey's other victims&mdash;now showing nine, including Susie. She resists Holly urging her to enter Heaven along with the others, claiming she has one final thing to do. Meanwhile, Susie's classmates Ruth and Ray are present when Harvey drives up to dispose of the safe at a sinkhole dump site on the Conners' property. Susie returns to Earth and [[Spirit possession|enters Ruth's body]], causing Ruth to faint. Ray rushes to Ruth's aid only to realize she has become Susie. They kiss, completing Susie's last wish, and she returns to Heaven. Meanwhile, Harvey dumps the safe in the sinkhole, leaving it to disappear in the muddy water as he drives away.\n\nSometime later, Harvey meets a young woman outside a diner and offers her a ride, but she rebuffs him and leaves. A large icicle falls from an overhead branch, hitting Harvey's shoulder, causing him to fall backward over a steep cliff to his death. Time passes, and Susie sees that her family is healing, which Susie refers to as \"the lovely bones\" that grew around her absence. Susie finally enters Heaven, telling the audience: \"My name is Salmon, like the fish; first name Susie. I was 14 years old when I was murdered on December 6, 1973. I was here for a moment and then I was gone. I wish you all a long and happy life.\"\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Saoirse Ronan]] as Susie Salmon, the main character and narrator.<ref name=\"weisz\"/> She is a 14-year-old girl who is killed by her neighbor.

The most common focus is on \"orientation\" and \"level of operation\". An NGO's orientation refers to the type of activities it takes on.

It includes NGOs with activities directed toward meeting the needs of the disadvantaged people/groups.\n* ''Service orientation'' includes NGOs with activities such as the provision of health, the family planning, or the education services. In these activities, the programme is held by the NGOs, and the people are expected to participate in it and to receive the service.\n* ''Participatory orientation'' is characterized by self-help projects where local people are involved particularly in the implementation of a project by contributing cash, tools, land, materials, labor, etc. In the classical community development project, participation begins with the definition of need and continues to the planning and the implementation stages.\n* ''Empowering orientation'' aims to help poor people develop a clearer understanding of the social, political and economic factors affecting their lives, and to strengthen their awareness of their own potential power to control their lives. There is maximum involvement of the beneficiaries with NGOs acting as facilitators.<ref name=\"Lawry 2009 29-30\">{{cite book |last=Lawry |first=Lynn |title=Guide to Nongovernmental Organizations for the Military |year=2009 |pages=29\u201330 |url=http://www.cdham.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Chapter-4.-NGO-Structure-Authority-and-Standards.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730130926/http://www.cdham.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Chapter-4.-NGO-Structure-Authority-and-Standards.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-30 }}</ref>\n\n=== By level of operation ===\n\n* ''Community-based organizations'' (CBOs) arise out of people's own initiatives.

Some state NGOs also work under the guidance of National and International NGOs.\n* ''National NGOs'' include national organizations such as the [[YMCA]]s/[[YWCA]]s, [[professional association]]s and similar groups. Some have state and city branches and assist local NGOs.\n* ''International NGOs'' range from secular agencies such as [[Save the Children]], to religiously motivated groups. They can be responsible for funding local NGOs, institutions and projects and implementing projects.<ref name=\"Lawry 2009 29-30\" />\n\nApart from \"NGO\", there are alternative or overlapping terms in use, including: [[Voluntary sector|third-sector]] organization (TSO), [[non-profit organization]] (NPO), voluntary organization (VO), [[civil society]] organization (CSO), [[grassroots]] organization (GO), [[social movement organization]] (SMO), private voluntary organization (PVO), [[self-help]] organization (SHO) and [[non-state actors]] (NSAs).\n\nIn Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian and other [[Romance languages]], the 'mirrored' abbreviation \"ONG\" is in use, which has the same meaning as \"NGO\" (for example ''Organisation non-nongovernmental'' in French, ''Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o N\u00e3o Governmental'' in Portuguese, ''Organizaci\u00f3n no gubernamental'' in Spanish, or ''Organizzazione non governativa'' in Italian).\n\nGovernmental-related organizations / non-governmental organizations are a heterogeneous group.

Unlike the Track, I diplomacy where government officials, diplomats, and elected leaders gather to talk about certain issues, Track II diplomacy consists of experts, scientists, professors and other figures that are not involved in government affairs. The members of Track II diplomacy can have more freedom to exchange ideas and come up with compromises on their own.\n\n== Activities ==\nThere are numerous classifications of NGOs. The typology the [[World Bank]] uses divides them into Operational and Advocacy.<ref name=\"definition\">[http://docs.lib.duke.edu/igo/guides/ngo/define.htm World Bank Criteria defining NGO] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621135344/http://docs.lib.duke.edu/igo/guides/ngo/define.htm |date=June 21, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nGenerally, NGOs act as implementers, catalysts, and partners. Firstly, NGOs act as implementers, because they mobilize resources in order to provide goods and services to people who are suffering, due to a man-made disaster or a natural disaster. Secondly, NGOs act as catalysts that drive change. They have the ability to \"''inspire, facilitate, or contribute to improved thinking and action to promote change''\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. Lastly, NGOs often act as partners alongside other organizations in order to tackle problems and address human needs more effectively.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Non-Governmental Organizations and Development|last=Lewis|first=David|last2=Kanji|first2=Nazneen|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=978-0415454308|location=Oxon|pages=12\u201313|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nNGOs vary in their methods. Some act primarily as lobbyists, while others primarily conduct programs and activities. For instance, an NGO such as [[Oxfam]], concerned with poverty alleviation, may provide needy people with the equipment and skills to find food and clean [[drinking water]], whereas an NGO like the [[FFDA]] helps through investigation and documentation of human rights{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} violations and provides legal assistance to victims of human rights abuses. Others, such as the [[Afghanistan Information Management Services]], provide specialized technical products and services to support development activities implemented on the ground by other organizations.\n\n=== Operational ===\nOperational NGOs seek to \"achieve small-scale change directly through projects\".<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> They mobilize financial resources, materials, and volunteers to create localized programs. They hold large-scale [[fundraising]] events and may apply to governments and organizations for grants or contracts to raise money for projects. They often operate in a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] structure; the main headquarters being staffed by professionals who plan projects, create budgets, keep accounts, and report and communicate with operational fieldworkers who work directly on projects.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> Operational NGOs deal with a wide range of issues but are most often associated with the delivery of services or environmental issues, emergency relief, and public welfare. Operational NGOs can be further categorized by the division into relief-oriented versus development-oriented organizations; according to whether they stress service delivery or participation; whether they are religious or secular; and whether they are more public- or private-oriented. Although operational NGOs can be community-based, many are national or international. The defining activity of operational NGOs is the implementation of projects.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\" />\n\n=== Campaigning ===\nCampaigning NGOs seek to \"''achieve large-scale change promoted indirectly through influence of the political system''\".<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> Campaigning NGOs need an efficient and effective group of professional members who are able to keep supporters informed, and motivated. They must plan and host demonstrations and events that will keep their cause in the media. They must maintain a large informed network of supporters who can be mobilized for events to garner media attention and influence policy changes. The defining activity of campaigning NGOs is holding demonstrations.<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> Campaigning NGOs often deal with issues relating to human rights, women's rights, and children's rights. The primary purpose of an Advocacy NGO is to defend or promote a specific cause. As opposed to operational project management, these organizations typically try to raise awareness, acceptance, and knowledge by lobbying, press work and activist event.<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" />\n\n=== Both operational and campaigning ===\nIt is not uncommon for NGOs to make use of both activities. Many times, operational NGOs will use campaigning techniques if they continually face the same issues in the field that could be remedied through policy changes. At the same time, Campaigning NGOs, like human rights organizations often have programs that assist the individual victims they are trying to help through their advocacy work.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\" />\n\n=== Public relations ===\nNon-governmental organizations need healthy relationships with the public to meet their goals. Foundations and charities use sophisticated public relations campaigns to raise funds and employ standard lobbying techniques with governments. Interest groups may be of political importance because of their ability to influence social and political outcomes. A [[Code of Ethics|code of ethics]] was established in 2002 by The World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wango.org/codeofethics.aspx|title=World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations - Code of Ethics and Conduct for NGOs|website=www.wango.org|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>.\n\n=== Project management ===\nThere is an increasing awareness that management techniques are crucial to project success in non-governmental organizations.<ref>[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/CCS/pdf/int-work-paper4.pdf 100 <!-- application/pdf, 102909 bytes [[Kibibyte|KiB] --> LSE.ac.uk], Mukasa, Sarah. ''Are expatriate staff necessary in international development NGOs? A case study of an international NGO in Uganda.'' Publication of the Centre for Civil Society at the London School of Economics. 2002, p. 11-13.</ref> Generally, private non-governmental organizations have either a community or environmental focus. They address varieties of issues such as religion, emergency aid, or humanitarian affairs. They mobilize public support and voluntary contributions for aid; they often have strong links with community groups in developing countries, and they often work in areas where government-to-government aid is not possible. NGOs are accepted as a part of the international relations landscape, and while they influence national and multilateral policy-making, increasingly they are more directly involved in local action.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Corporate structure ==\n\n=== Staffing ===\nSome NGOs are highly professionalized and rely mainly on paid staff. Others are based around voluntary labor and are less formalized. Not all people working for non-governmental organizations are [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s.\n\nMany NGOs are associated with the use of international staff working in developing countries, but there are many NGOs around the world that rely on local employees or volunteers. There is some dispute as to whether [[expatriate]]s should be sent to developing countries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Frequently this type of personnel is employed to satisfy a [[Donation|donor]] who wants to see the supported project managed by someone from an [[Developed country|industrialized country]]. However, the expertise of these employees or volunteers may be counterbalanced by a number of factors: the cost of [[Alien (law)|foreigners]] is typically higher, they have no [[grassroots democracy|grass-root connections]] in the country they are sent to, and local expertise is often undervalued.<ref name=\"definition\" />\n\nThe NGO sector is an essential employer in terms of numbers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} For example, by the end of 1995, [[Concern Worldwide|CONCERN worldwide]], an international Northern NGO working against poverty, employed 174 expatriates and just over 5,000 national staff working in ten developing countries in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], and in [[Haiti]].\n\n=== Funding ===\nMajor sources of NGO funding include membership dues, the sale of [[Product (business)|goods]] and services, grants from international institutions or national governments, and private [[donation]]s. \n\nMany NGOs depend heavily on governments for their funding, even though the term \"non-governmental organization\" implies [[independence]] from governments, <ref name=\"global\" /> A quarter of the US$162 million income in 1998 of the [[Famine relief|famine-relief]] organization [[Oxfam]] was donated by the British government and the EU. The Christian relief and development organization [[World Vision United States]] collected US$55 million worth of goods in 1998 from the American government. Several EU-grants provide funds accessible to NGOs.\n\nGovernment funding of NGOs is controversial since, according to David Rieff, writing in ''[[The New Republic]]'', \"the whole point of humanitarian intervention was precise that NGOs and civil society had both a right and an obligation to respond with acts of aid and solidarity to people in need or being subjected to repression or want by the forces that controlled them, whatever the governments concerned might think about the matter.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/world/75421/ng-uh-o?page=0,0 |title=NG-Uh-O \u2013 The trouble with humanitarianism |author=David Rieff |date=June 10, 2010 |newspaper=The New Republic}}</ref> Some NGOs, such as [[Greenpeace]] do not accept funding from governments or intergovernmental organizations.<ref name=\"HBS\">{{cite web |author=Sarah Jane Gilbert |url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5797.html |title=Harvard Business School, HBS Cases: The Value of Environmental Activists |publisher=Hbswk.hbs.edu |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}</ref><ref name=\"GP Annual report 2008\">{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/international-annualreport-2008.pdf |title=Greenpeace Annual Report 2008 |publisher=Greenpeace.org |year=2008 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}</ref>\n\nSome NGOs require sizeable funds to operate.

Funders generally require reporting and assessment, such information is not necessarily publicly available. There may also be associations and watchdog organizations that research and publish details on the actions of NGOs working in particular geographic or program areas.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nIn recent years, many large corporations have increased their [[corporate social responsibility]] departments in an attempt to preempt NGO campaigns against certain corporate practices. As the logic goes, if corporations work ''with'' NGOs, NGOs will not work ''against'' corporations. Greater collaboration between corporations and NGOs creates inherent risks of [[Co-option|co-optation]] for the weaker partner, typically the non-profit involved.<ref>{{cite journal |year=2012 |title=Corporations and NGOs: When Accountability Leads to Co-optation |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=9\u201321 |doi=10.1007/s10551-011-1057-9|last1=Baur |first1=Dorothea |last2=Schmitz |first2=Hans Peter |url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/312987/files/10551_2011_Article_1057.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2007, The United States Department of Defense Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) [[S.

Unlike the \"co-option\" strategy described for corporations, the OASD(HA) recognizes the neutrality of health as an essential service. International Health cultivates collaborative relationships with NGOs, albeit at arm's length, recognizing their traditional independence, expertise, and honest broker status. While the goals of DoD and NGOs may seem incongruent, the DoD's emphasis on stability and security to reduce and prevent conflict suggests, on careful analysis, important mutual interests.\n\n== History ==\nInternational non-governmental organizations have a history dating back to at least the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Thomas |title=NGOs: A New History of Transnational Civil Society |year=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-938753-3 |page=23 |url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ngos-9780199387533}}</ref><ref>Steve Charnovitz, \"Two Centuries of Participation: NGOs and International Governance, Michigan Journal of International Law, Winter 1997.</ref> It has been estimated that by 1914, there were 1083 NGOs.<ref>{{cite book |title=Subcontracting Peace \u2013 The Challenges of NGO Peacebuilding |editor1=Oliver P.

Many problems could not be solved within a nation. [[Treaty|International treaties]] and international organizations such as the [[World Trade Organization]] were centred mainly on the interests of capitalist enterprises. In an attempt to counterbalance this trend, NGOs have developed to emphasize [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian issues]], [[developmental aid]], and [[sustainable development]]. A prominent example of this is the [[World Social Forum]], which is a rival convention to the [[World Economic Forum]] held annually in January in [[Davos, Switzerland|Davos]], [[Switzerland]].

Shivji]] is one of Africa's leading experts on law and development issues as an author and academic. His criticism on NGOs is found in two essays: \"Silences in NGO discourse: The role and future of NGOs in Africa\" and \"Reflections on NGOs in Tanzania: What we are, what we are not and what we ought to be\". Shivji argues that despite the good intentions of NGO leaders and activists, he is critical of the \"objective effects of actions, regardless of their intentions\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Shivji |first=Issa G. |title=Silence in NGO discourse: the role and future of NGOs in Africa |year=2007 |publisher=Fahamu |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978-0-9545637-5-2 |page=84}}</ref> Shivji argues also that the sudden rise of NGOs is part of a [[neoliberal]] paradigm, rather than pure altruistic motivations. He is critical of the current manifestations of NGOs wanting to change the world without understanding it, and that the [[Imperialism|imperial]] relationship continues today with the rise of NGOs.\n\nJames Pfeiffer, in his case study of NGO involvement in Mozambique, speaks to the negative effects that NGOs have had on areas of health within the country. He argues that over the last decade, NGOs in Mozambique have \"fragmented the local health system, undermined local control of health programs, and contributed to growing local social inequality\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nHe notes further that NGOs can be uncoordinated, creating parallel projects among different organizations, that pull health service workers away from their routine duties in order to serve the interests of the NGOs. This ultimately undermines local primary health care efforts and takes away the governments' ability to maintain agency over their own health sector.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | last1 = Pfeiffer | first1 = J | year = 2003 | title = International NGOs and primary health care in Mozambique: the need for a new model of collaboration | url = | journal = Social Science & Medicine | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 725\u2013738 | doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(02)00068-0| pmid = 12560007 }}</ref> Pfeiffer suggested a new model of collaboration between the NGO and the DPS (the Mozambique Provincial Health Directorate). He mentioned the NGO should be 'formally held to standard and adherence within the host country', for example, reduce 'showcase' projects and parallel programs that prove to be unsustainable.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n[[Jessica Mathews]] wrote in [[Foreign Affairs]] in 1997: \"For all their strengths, NGOs are special interests.

Rather than operating through science to be rationally and effectively practical, NGOs have been accused of abusing the utilization of science to gain their own advantages. In the beginning, as Parr indicated, there was \"a tendency among our critics to say that science is the only decision-making tool \u2026 but political and commercial interests are using science as a cover for getting their way.\"<ref name = bond323>{{citation|last = Bond|first = Michael|title = The Backlash against NGOs|work = Prospect|date = April 2000|page =323|url = https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/thebacklashagainstngos}}</ref> At the same time, NGOs can appear to not be cooperative with other groups, according to the previous policy-maker for the German branch of [[Friends of the Earth]], Jens Katjek. \"If NGOs want the best for the environment\", he says, \"they have to learn to compromise.\"<ref name = bond323/>\n\nNGOs have also been questioned as being \"too much of a good thing\".<ref name = Werker>{{cite journal | last1 = Werker | first1 = Eric | last2 = Ahmed | first2 = Faisal Z. | year = 2008 | title = What Do Nongovernmental Organizations Do? | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 73\u201392 | doi=10.1257/jep.22.2.73}}</ref> Eric Werker and Faisal Ahmed bring up three potential critiques of the role of NGOs in developing nations: too many NGOs in a nation\u2014particularly one ruled by a warlord\u2014reduces the NGO's ability to establish a credible threat of removing humanitarian assistance since they can easily be replaced by another NGO; the frequent process of resource allocation and outsourcing to local organizations in international development projects results in high expenses for NGOs and rings into question how much of the resources and money actually goes to the intended beneficiaries at the end of the allocation process; and finally, NGO missions tend to be too paternalistic and expensive, though Werker and Ahmed propose that vouchers are a good way to overcome this obstacle.<ref name = Werker/>\n\n=== Challenges to legitimacy ===\nThe issue of the legitimacy of NGOs raises a series of important questions. Legitimacy is one of the most important assets possessed by an NGO and is gained due to them being perceived as an \"independent voice\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weber | first1 = N. | last2 = Christopherson | first2 = T. | year = 2002 | title = The influence of non-governmental organizations on the creation of Natura 2000 during the European policy process | url = | journal = Forest Policy and Economics | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 1\u201312 | doi=10.1016/s1389-9341(01)00070-3}}</ref><ref name=\"2002aHD\">Edwards, M. and Hulme, D.

Chapter 11.</ref> Their representation also emerges as an important question. Who bestows responsibilities to NGOs or INGOs and how do they gain the representation of citizens and civil society is still not scrutinized thoroughly. For instance, in the article, it is stated, \"To put the point starkly: are the citizens of countries of the South and their needs represented in global civil society, or are citizens as well as their needs constructed by practices of representation? And when we realize that INGOs hardly ever come face to face with the people whose interests and problems they represent, or that they are not accountable to the people they represent, matters become even more troublesome.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chandhoke | first1 = Neera | year = 2005 | title = How Global Is Global Civil Society? | url = | journal = Journal of World-Systems Research | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 326\u2013327 | doi = 10.5195/JWSR.2005.388 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nThe origin of funding can have serious implications for the legitimacy of NGOs. NGOs have increased their numbers and range of activities to a level where they have become increasingly dependent on a limited number of donors.<ref name=\"1996HD\">Edwards, M. and Hulme, D. (1996) Too Close for comfort? The impact of official aid on Non-Governmental Organisations. \"World Development.\" 24(6), pp. 961\u2013973.</ref> Consequently, competition has increased for funding, as have the expectations of the donors, who may add conditions that threaten the independence of NGOs.<ref>, Ebrahim, A. (2003) Accountability in practice: Mechanisms for NGOs. \"World Development.\" 31(5), pp.813\u2013829.</ref> An over-dependence on official aid may dilute \"the willingness of NGOs to speak out on issues which are unpopular with governments\".<ref name=2002aHD /> Some commentators have also argued that the changes in NGO funding sources have ultimately altered their functions.<ref name=2002aHD /><ref>[http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/05/17/mckibbens-divestment-tour/ Brought to You by Wall Street], CORY MORNINGSTAR, ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 2013.05.17</ref><ref>[http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/03/14/350-orgs-friends-on-wall-street/ The Climate Wealth Opportunists], CORY MORNINGSTAR, ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 2014.03.14</ref>\n\nNGOs have also been challenged on the grounds that they do not necessarily represent the needs of the developing world, through diminishing the so-called \u201cSouthern Voice\u201d. Some postulate that the [[North\u2013South divide]] exists in the arena of NGOs.<ref name=\"linden\">Lindenberg, M. and Bryant, C. (2001) Going Global: Transforming Relief and Development NGOs. Bloomfield: Kumarian Press.</ref> They question the equality of the relationships between Northern and Southern parts of the same NGOs as well as the relationships between Southern and Northern NGOs working in partnerships. This suggests a division of labor may develop, with the North taking the lead in advocacy and resource mobilization whilst the South engages in service delivery in the developing world.<ref name=linden /> The potential implications of this may mean the needs of the developing world are not addressed appropriately as Northern NGOs do not properly consult or participate in partnerships, such that they assign unrepresentative priorities.<ref>, Jenkins, R. (2001) Corporate Codes of Conduct: Self-Regulation in a Global Economy. \"Technology, Business and Society Programme Paper Number 2.\" United Nations Research Institute for Social Development.</ref>\n\nNGOs are also said to damage the public sector in target countries, e.g. accusations that NGO mismanagement has resulted in the breakdown of public health care systems. Instead of promoting equity and alleviating poverty, NGOs have been under scrutiny for contributing to socioeconomic inequality and dis-empowering services in the public sector of third world countries.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=Patrick-Cockburn>[http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/03/25/how-ngos-failed-afghanistan/ How NGOs Failed Afghanistan], [[Patrick Cockburn]], ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 2014.03.25</ref>\n\nThe scale and variety of activities in which NGOs participate have grown rapidly since 1980, particularly since 1990.<ref>Avina, J. (1993) The Evolutionary Life Cycles if Non-Governmental Development Organisations. \"Public Administration and Development.\" 13(5), pp. 453\u2013474.</ref> This has presented NGOs with a need to balance the pressures of centralization and decentralization. By centralizing NGOs, particularly those that operate at an international level, they can assign a common theme or set of goals. Conversely, it may also be advantageous to decentralize to increase the chances of an NGO responding more flexibly and effectively to localized issues by implementing projects, which are modest in scale, easily monitored, produce immediate benefits, and where all involved know that corruption will be punished.<ref name=Patrick-Cockburn /><ref>Anheier, H. and Themudo, N.

In some countries, the term NGO is applied to an organization that in another country would be called an [[Nonprofit organization|NPO]] (a non-profit organization), and vice versa. [[Political party|Political parties]] and [[Trade union|trade unions]] are considered NGOs only in some countries. There are many different classifications of NGOs in use. The most common focus is on \"orientation\" and \"level of operation\". An NGO's orientation refers to the type of activities it takes on. These activities might include human rights, environmental, improving health, or development work. An NGO's level of operation indicates the scale at which an organization works, such as local, regional, national, or international.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Vakil |first=Anna |title=Confronting the classification problem: Toward a taxonomy of NGOs |journal=World Development |date=December 1997 |volume=25 |issue=12 |pages=2057\u20132070 |doi=10.1016/S0305-750X(97)00098-3}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"''non-governmental organization''\" was first coined in 1945, when the [[United Nations]] (UN) was created.<ref>{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Thomas |title=NGOs: A New History of Transnational Civil Society |year=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-938753-3 |page=3 |url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ngos-9780199387533}}</ref> The UN, itself an [[intergovernmental organization]], made it possible for certain approved specialized international non-state agencies \u2014 ''i.e.'', non-governmental organizations \u2014 to be awarded observer status at its assemblies and some of its meetings. Later, the term became used more widely. Today, according to the UN, any kind of private organization that is independent of government control can be termed an \"NGO\", provided it is not-for-profit,  but not simply an opposition [[political party]].<ref>[https://www.apa.org/international/united-nations/acronyms.pdf UNITED NATIONS: DEFINITIONS AND TERMS]</ref>\n\nPublic surveys reveal that NGOs often enjoy a high degree of public trust, which can make them a useful \u2013 but not always sufficient \u2013 proxy for the concerns of society and stakeholders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iisd.org/business/ngo/roles.aspx |title=The rise and role of NGOs in sustainable development |publisher=Iisd.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nNGO types can be understood by their orientation and their level of operation.\n\n=== By orientation ===\n\n* ''Charitable orientation'' often involves a top-down effort with little participation or input by beneficiaries. It includes NGOs with activities directed toward meeting the needs of the disadvantaged people/groups.\n* ''Service orientation'' includes NGOs with activities such as the provision of health, the family planning, or the education services. In these activities, the programme is held by the NGOs, and the people are expected to participate in it and to receive the service.\n* ''Participatory orientation'' is characterized by self-help projects where local people are involved particularly in the implementation of a project by contributing cash, tools, land, materials, labor, etc. In the classical community development project, participation begins with the definition of need and continues to the planning and the implementation stages.\n* ''Empowering orientation'' aims to help poor people develop a clearer understanding of the social, political and economic factors affecting their lives, and to strengthen their awareness of their own potential power to control their lives. There is maximum involvement of the beneficiaries with NGOs acting as facilitators.<ref name=\"Lawry 2009 29-30\">{{cite book |last=Lawry |first=Lynn |title=Guide to Nongovernmental Organizations for the Military |year=2009 |pages=29\u201330 |url=http://www.cdham.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Chapter-4.-NGO-Structure-Authority-and-Standards.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730130926/http://www.cdham.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Chapter-4.-NGO-Structure-Authority-and-Standards.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-30 }}</ref>\n\n=== By level of operation ===\n\n* ''Community-based organizations'' (CBOs) arise out of people's own initiatives. They can be responsible for raising the consciousness of the urban poor, helping them  understand their rights in accessing required services and providing such services.\n* ''City-wide organizations'' include organizations such as chambers of commerce and industry, coalitions of business, ethnic or educational groups, and associations of community organizations.\n*''State NGOs'' include state-level organizations, associations and groups. Some state NGOs also work under the guidance of National and International NGOs.\n* ''National NGOs'' include national organizations such as the [[YMCA]]s/[[YWCA]]s, [[professional association]]s and similar groups. Some have state and city branches and assist local NGOs.\n* ''International NGOs'' range from secular agencies such as [[Save the Children]], to religiously motivated groups. They can be responsible for funding local NGOs, institutions and projects and implementing projects.<ref name=\"Lawry 2009 29-30\" />\n\nApart from \"NGO\", there are alternative or overlapping terms in use, including: [[Voluntary sector|third-sector]] organization (TSO), [[non-profit organization]] (NPO), voluntary organization (VO), [[civil society]] organization (CSO), [[grassroots]] organization (GO), [[social movement organization]] (SMO), private voluntary organization (PVO), [[self-help]] organization (SHO) and [[non-state actors]] (NSAs).\n\nIn Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian and other [[Romance languages]], the 'mirrored' abbreviation \"ONG\" is in use, which has the same meaning as \"NGO\" (for example ''Organisation non-nongovernmental'' in French, ''Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o N\u00e3o Governmental'' in Portuguese, ''Organizaci\u00f3n no gubernamental'' in Spanish, or ''Organizzazione non governativa'' in Italian).\n\nGovernmental-related organizations / non-governmental organizations are a heterogeneous group. As a result, a long list of additional acronyms has developed, including:\n* BINGO: 'Business-friendly international NGO' or 'Big international NGO'\n* SBO: 'Social Benefit Organization,' a positive, goal-oriented designation as a substitute for the negative, \"Non-\" designations\n* TANGO: 'Technical assistance NGO'\n* TSO: 'third-sector organization'\n* [[GONGO]]: 'government-organized non-governmental organization' or 'government-operated NGOs' (set up by governments to look like NGOs in order to qualify for outside aid or promote the interests of government)\n* DONGO: 'Donor-organized NGO'\n* [[International non-governmental organization|INGO]]: 'International NGO'\n* [[QUANGO]]: 'quasi-autonomous NGO,' or [[QUANGO]] refers to NGOs set up and funded by the government. The term is particularly prevalent within the UK (where there are more than 1,200 of them), the Republic of Ireland, and the Commonwealth. \n* National NGO: A non-governmental organization that exists only in one country. This term is rare due to the globalization of non-governmental organizations, which causes an NGO to exist in more than one country.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\">{{cite web |last=Willetts |first=Peter |title=What is a Non-Governmental Organization? |url=http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/p.willetts/CS-NTWKS/NGO-ART.HTM |encyclopedia=UNESCO Encyclopaedia of Life Support Systems |publisher=City University London |accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Civil society|CSO]]: 'Civil Society Organization'\n* [[ENGO]]: 'Environmental NGO,' such as [[Greenpeace]] and [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]\n* NNGO: 'Northern NGO'\n* PANGO: 'Party NGO,' set up by parties and disguised as NGOs to serve their political matters.\n* SNGO: 'Southern NGO'\n* SCO: 'Social change organization'\n* TNGO: 'Transnational NGO.'

Examples include improving the state of the [[natural environment]], encouraging the observance of [[human rights]], improving the welfare of the disadvantaged, or representing a corporate agenda. However, there are a huge number of such organizations and their goals cover a broad range of political and philosophical positions. This can also easily be applied to private schools and athletic organizations.\n\n=== Track II diplomacy ===\n{{Main article|Track II diplomacy}}\nTrack II dialogue, or Track II diplomacy, is transnational coordination that involves non-official members of the government including [[epistemic community|epistemic communities]] as well as former policy-makers or analysts. Track II diplomacy aims to get policymakers and policy analysts to come to a common solution through discussions by unofficial means. Unlike the Track, I diplomacy where government officials, diplomats, and elected leaders gather to talk about certain issues, Track II diplomacy consists of experts, scientists, professors and other figures that are not involved in government affairs. The members of Track II diplomacy can have more freedom to exchange ideas and come up with compromises on their own.\n\n== Activities ==\nThere are numerous classifications of NGOs. The typology the [[World Bank]] uses divides them into Operational and Advocacy.<ref name=\"definition\">[http://docs.lib.duke.edu/igo/guides/ngo/define.htm World Bank Criteria defining NGO] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621135344/http://docs.lib.duke.edu/igo/guides/ngo/define.htm |date=June 21, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nGenerally, NGOs act as implementers, catalysts, and partners. Firstly, NGOs act as implementers, because they mobilize resources in order to provide goods and services to people who are suffering, due to a man-made disaster or a natural disaster. Secondly, NGOs act as catalysts that drive change. They have the ability to \"''inspire, facilitate, or contribute to improved thinking and action to promote change''\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. Lastly, NGOs often act as partners alongside other organizations in order to tackle problems and address human needs more effectively.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Non-Governmental Organizations and Development|last=Lewis|first=David|last2=Kanji|first2=Nazneen|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=978-0415454308|location=Oxon|pages=12\u201313|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nNGOs vary in their methods. Some act primarily as lobbyists, while others primarily conduct programs and activities. For instance, an NGO such as [[Oxfam]], concerned with poverty alleviation, may provide needy people with the equipment and skills to find food and clean [[drinking water]], whereas an NGO like the [[FFDA]] helps through investigation and documentation of human rights{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} violations and provides legal assistance to victims of human rights abuses. Others, such as the [[Afghanistan Information Management Services]], provide specialized technical products and services to support development activities implemented on the ground by other organizations.\n\n=== Operational ===\nOperational NGOs seek to \"achieve small-scale change directly through projects\".<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> They mobilize financial resources, materials, and volunteers to create localized programs. They hold large-scale [[fundraising]] events and may apply to governments and organizations for grants or contracts to raise money for projects. They often operate in a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] structure; the main headquarters being staffed by professionals who plan projects, create budgets, keep accounts, and report and communicate with operational fieldworkers who work directly on projects.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> Operational NGOs deal with a wide range of issues but are most often associated with the delivery of services or environmental issues, emergency relief, and public welfare. Operational NGOs can be further categorized by the division into relief-oriented versus development-oriented organizations; according to whether they stress service delivery or participation; whether they are religious or secular; and whether they are more public- or private-oriented. Although operational NGOs can be community-based, many are national or international. The defining activity of operational NGOs is the implementation of projects.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\" />\n\n=== Campaigning ===\nCampaigning NGOs seek to \"''achieve large-scale change promoted indirectly through influence of the political system''\".<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> Campaigning NGOs need an efficient and effective group of professional members who are able to keep supporters informed, and motivated. They must plan and host demonstrations and events that will keep their cause in the media. They must maintain a large informed network of supporters who can be mobilized for events to garner media attention and influence policy changes. The defining activity of campaigning NGOs is holding demonstrations.<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> Campaigning NGOs often deal with issues relating to human rights, women's rights, and children's rights. The primary purpose of an Advocacy NGO is to defend or promote a specific cause. As opposed to operational project management, these organizations typically try to raise awareness, acceptance, and knowledge by lobbying, press work and activist event.<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" />\n\n=== Both operational and campaigning ===\nIt is not uncommon for NGOs to make use of both activities. Many times, operational NGOs will use campaigning techniques if they continually face the same issues in the field that could be remedied through policy changes. At the same time, Campaigning NGOs, like human rights organizations often have programs that assist the individual victims they are trying to help through their advocacy work.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\" />\n\n=== Public relations ===\nNon-governmental organizations need healthy relationships with the public to meet their goals. Foundations and charities use sophisticated public relations campaigns to raise funds and employ standard lobbying techniques with governments. Interest groups may be of political importance because of their ability to influence social and political outcomes. A [[Code of Ethics|code of ethics]] was established in 2002 by The World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wango.org/codeofethics.aspx|title=World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations - Code of Ethics and Conduct for NGOs|website=www.wango.org|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>.\n\n=== Project management ===\nThere is an increasing awareness that management techniques are crucial to project success in non-governmental organizations.<ref>[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/CCS/pdf/int-work-paper4.pdf 100 <!-- application/pdf, 102909 bytes [[Kibibyte|KiB] --> LSE.ac.uk], Mukasa, Sarah. ''Are expatriate staff necessary in international development NGOs? A case study of an international NGO in Uganda.'' Publication of the Centre for Civil Society at the London School of Economics. 2002, p. 11-13.</ref> Generally, private non-governmental organizations have either a community or environmental focus. They address varieties of issues such as religion, emergency aid, or humanitarian affairs. They mobilize public support and voluntary contributions for aid; they often have strong links with community groups in developing countries, and they often work in areas where government-to-government aid is not possible. NGOs are accepted as a part of the international relations landscape, and while they influence national and multilateral policy-making, increasingly they are more directly involved in local action.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Corporate structure ==\n\n=== Staffing ===\nSome NGOs are highly professionalized and rely mainly on paid staff. Others are based around voluntary labor and are less formalized. Not all people working for non-governmental organizations are [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s.\n\nMany NGOs are associated with the use of international staff working in developing countries, but there are many NGOs around the world that rely on local employees or volunteers. There is some dispute as to whether [[expatriate]]s should be sent to developing countries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Frequently this type of personnel is employed to satisfy a [[Donation|donor]] who wants to see the supported project managed by someone from an [[Developed country|industrialized country]]. However, the expertise of these employees or volunteers may be counterbalanced by a number of factors: the cost of [[Alien (law)|foreigners]] is typically higher, they have no [[grassroots democracy|grass-root connections]] in the country they are sent to, and local expertise is often undervalued.<ref name=\"definition\" />\n\nThe NGO sector is an essential employer in terms of numbers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} For example, by the end of 1995, [[Concern Worldwide|CONCERN worldwide]], an international Northern NGO working against poverty, employed 174 expatriates and just over 5,000 national staff working in ten developing countries in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], and in [[Haiti]].\n\n=== Funding ===\nMajor sources of NGO funding include membership dues, the sale of [[Product (business)|goods]] and services, grants from international institutions or national governments, and private [[donation]]s. \n\nMany NGOs depend heavily on governments for their funding, even though the term \"non-governmental organization\" implies [[independence]] from governments, <ref name=\"global\" /> A quarter of the US$162 million income in 1998 of the [[Famine relief|famine-relief]] organization [[Oxfam]] was donated by the British government and the EU. The Christian relief and development organization [[World Vision United States]] collected US$55 million worth of goods in 1998 from the American government. Several EU-grants provide funds accessible to NGOs.\n\nGovernment funding of NGOs is controversial since, according to David Rieff, writing in ''[[The New Republic]]'', \"the whole point of humanitarian intervention was precise that NGOs and civil society had both a right and an obligation to respond with acts of aid and solidarity to people in need or being subjected to repression or want by the forces that controlled them, whatever the governments concerned might think about the matter.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/world/75421/ng-uh-o?page=0,0 |title=NG-Uh-O \u2013 The trouble with humanitarianism |author=David Rieff |date=June 10, 2010 |newspaper=The New Republic}}</ref> Some NGOs, such as [[Greenpeace]] do not accept funding from governments or intergovernmental organizations.<ref name=\"HBS\">{{cite web |author=Sarah Jane Gilbert |url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5797.html |title=Harvard Business School, HBS Cases: The Value of Environmental Activists |publisher=Hbswk.hbs.edu |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}</ref><ref name=\"GP Annual report 2008\">{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/international-annualreport-2008.pdf |title=Greenpeace Annual Report 2008 |publisher=Greenpeace.org |year=2008 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}</ref>\n\nSome NGOs require sizeable funds to operate.

International Health cultivates collaborative relationships with NGOs, albeit at arm's length, recognizing their traditional independence, expertise, and honest broker status.

Many problems could not be solved within a nation. [[Treaty|International treaties]] and international organizations such as the [[World Trade Organization]] were centred mainly on the interests of capitalist enterprises. In an attempt to counterbalance this trend, NGOs have developed to emphasize [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian issues]], [[developmental aid]], and [[sustainable development]].

His criticism on NGOs is found in two essays: \"Silences in NGO discourse: The role and future of NGOs in Africa\" and \"Reflections on NGOs in Tanzania: What we are, what we are not and what we ought to be\".

He is critical of the current manifestations of NGOs wanting to change the world without understanding it, and that the [[Imperialism|imperial]] relationship continues today with the rise of NGOs.\n\nJames Pfeiffer, in his case study of NGO involvement in Mozambique, speaks to the negative effects that NGOs have had on areas of health within the country. He argues that over the last decade, NGOs in Mozambique have \"fragmented the local health system, undermined local control of health programs, and contributed to growing local social inequality\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nHe notes further that NGOs can be uncoordinated, creating parallel projects among different organizations, that pull health service workers away from their routine duties in order to serve the interests of the NGOs.

Rather than operating through science to be rationally and effectively practical, NGOs have been accused of abusing the utilization of science to gain their own advantages. In the beginning, as Parr indicated, there was \"a tendency among our critics to say that science is the only decision-making tool \u2026 but political and commercial interests are using science as a cover for getting their way.\"<ref name = bond323>{{citation|last = Bond|first = Michael|title = The Backlash against NGOs|work = Prospect|date = April 2000|page =323|url = https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/thebacklashagainstngos}}</ref> At the same time, NGOs can appear to not be cooperative with other groups, according to the previous policy-maker for the German branch of [[Friends of the Earth]], Jens Katjek. \"If NGOs want the best for the environment\", he says, \"they have to learn to compromise.\"<ref name = bond323/>\n\nNGOs have also been questioned as being \"too much of a good thing\".<ref name = Werker>{{cite journal | last1 = Werker | first1 = Eric | last2 = Ahmed | first2 = Faisal Z. | year = 2008 | title = What Do Nongovernmental Organizations Do? | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 73\u201392 | doi=10.1257/jep.22.2.73}}</ref> Eric Werker and Faisal Ahmed bring up three potential critiques of the role of NGOs in developing nations: too many NGOs in a nation\u2014particularly one ruled by a warlord\u2014reduces the NGO's ability to establish a credible threat of removing humanitarian assistance since they can easily be replaced by another NGO; the frequent process of resource allocation and outsourcing to local organizations in international development projects results in high expenses for NGOs and rings into question how much of the resources and money actually goes to the intended beneficiaries at the end of the allocation process; and finally, NGO missions tend to be too paternalistic and expensive, though Werker and Ahmed propose that vouchers are a good way to overcome this obstacle.<ref name = Werker/>\n\n=== Challenges to legitimacy ===\nThe issue of the legitimacy of NGOs raises a series of important questions. Legitimacy is one of the most important assets possessed by an NGO and is gained due to them being perceived as an \"independent voice\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weber | first1 = N. | last2 = Christopherson | first2 = T. | year = 2002 | title = The influence of non-governmental organizations on the creation of Natura 2000 during the European policy process | url = | journal = Forest Policy and Economics | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 1\u201312 | doi=10.1016/s1389-9341(01)00070-3}}</ref><ref name=\"2002aHD\">Edwards, M. and Hulme, D.

Chapter 11.</ref> Their representation also emerges as an important question. Who bestows responsibilities to NGOs or INGOs and how do they gain the representation of citizens and civil society is still not scrutinized thoroughly. For instance, in the article, it is stated, \"To put the point starkly: are the citizens of countries of the South and their needs represented in global civil society, or are citizens as well as their needs constructed by practices of representation? And when we realize that INGOs hardly ever come face to face with the people whose interests and problems they represent, or that they are not accountable to the people they represent, matters become even more troublesome.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chandhoke | first1 = Neera | year = 2005 | title = How Global Is Global Civil Society? | url = | journal = Journal of World-Systems Research | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 326\u2013327 | doi = 10.5195/JWSR.2005.388 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nThe origin of funding can have serious implications for the legitimacy of NGOs. NGOs have increased their numbers and range of activities to a level where they have become increasingly dependent on a limited number of donors.<ref name=\"1996HD\">Edwards, M. and Hulme, D. (1996) Too Close for comfort? The impact of official aid on Non-Governmental Organisations. \"World Development.\" 24(6), pp. 961\u2013973.</ref> Consequently, competition has increased for funding, as have the expectations of the donors, who may add conditions that threaten the independence of NGOs.<ref>, Ebrahim, A. (2003) Accountability in practice: Mechanisms for NGOs. \"World Development.\" 31(5), pp.813\u2013829.</ref> An over-dependence on official aid may dilute \"the willingness of NGOs to speak out on issues which are unpopular with governments\".<ref name=2002aHD /> Some commentators have also argued that the changes in NGO funding sources have ultimately altered their functions.<ref name=2002aHD /><ref>[http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/05/17/mckibbens-divestment-tour/ Brought to You by Wall Street], CORY MORNINGSTAR, ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 2013.05.17</ref><ref>[http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/03/14/350-orgs-friends-on-wall-street/ The Climate Wealth Opportunists], CORY MORNINGSTAR, ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 2014.03.14</ref>\n\nNGOs have also been challenged on the grounds that they do not necessarily represent the needs of the developing world, through diminishing the so-called \u201cSouthern Voice\u201d. Some postulate that the [[North\u2013South divide]] exists in the arena of NGOs.<ref name=\"linden\">Lindenberg, M. and Bryant, C. (2001) Going Global: Transforming Relief and Development NGOs. Bloomfield: Kumarian Press.</ref> They question the equality of the relationships between Northern and Southern parts of the same NGOs as well as the relationships between Southern and Northern NGOs working in partnerships. This suggests a division of labor may develop, with the North taking the lead in advocacy and resource mobilization whilst the South engages in service delivery in the developing world.<ref name=linden /> The potential implications of this may mean the needs of the developing world are not addressed appropriately as Northern NGOs do not properly consult or participate in partnerships, such that they assign unrepresentative priorities.<ref>, Jenkins, R. (2001) Corporate Codes of Conduct: Self-Regulation in a Global Economy. \"Technology, Business and Society Programme Paper Number 2.\" United Nations Research Institute for Social Development.</ref>\n\nNGOs are also said to damage the public sector in target countries, e.g. accusations that NGO mismanagement has resulted in the breakdown of public health care systems. Instead of promoting equity and alleviating poverty, NGOs have been under scrutiny for contributing to socioeconomic inequality and dis-empowering services in the public sector of third world countries.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=Patrick-Cockburn>[http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/03/25/how-ngos-failed-afghanistan/ How NGOs Failed Afghanistan], [[Patrick Cockburn]], ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 2014.03.25</ref>\n\nThe scale and variety of activities in which NGOs participate have grown rapidly since 1980, particularly since 1990.<ref>Avina, J. (1993) The Evolutionary Life Cycles if Non-Governmental Development Organisations. \"Public Administration and Development.\" 13(5), pp. 453\u2013474.</ref> This has presented NGOs with a need to balance the pressures of centralization and decentralization. By centralizing NGOs, particularly those that operate at an international level, they can assign a common theme or set of goals. Conversely, it may also be advantageous to decentralize to increase the chances of an NGO responding more flexibly and effectively to localized issues by implementing projects, which are modest in scale, easily monitored, produce immediate benefits, and where all involved know that corruption will be punished.<ref name=Patrick-Cockburn /><ref>Anheier, H. and Themudo, N.

''RIA'' means ''Russian Information Agency'' and ''Novosti'' means ''News'' in Russian. The common abbreviation in Russian is RIA.\n\n==History==\nRIA Novosti's history dates back to 24 June 1941, when by a resolution of the [[Government of the Soviet Union|USSR Council of People's Commissars]] and the Communist Party Central Committee, \"''On the Establishment and Tasks of the Soviet Information Bureau''\", the [[Soviet Information Bureau]] (Sovinformburo) was set up under the USSR Council of People's Commissars and the Central Committee. Its main task was to oversee work to cover international, military events and the events of the country's domestic life in periodicals and on the radio (from 14 October 1941, to 3 March 1942, was based in Kuibyshev \u2013 modern-day Samara).<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nThe bureau's main task was to compile reports on the situation on the frontline of the war, work on the home front, and the partisan movement for the radio, newspapers and magazines. Sovinformburo directed the activity of the All-Slavonic Committee, Anti-Nazi Committee of Soviet Women, Anti-Nazi Committee of the Soviet Youth, Anti-Nazi Committee of Soviet Scientists, and the Jewish Anti-Nazi Committee. In 1944, a special bureau on propaganda for foreign countries was set up as part of Sovinformburo.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nThrough 1,171 newspapers, 523 magazines and 18 radio stations in 23 countries, Soviet embassies abroad, friendship societies, trade unions, women's, youth and scientific organizations, Sovinformburo informed readers and listeners about the struggle of the Soviet people against Nazism and in the post-war years about the main areas of Soviet domestic and foreign policies.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nSovinformburo heads included [[Aleksandr Shcherbakov (politician)|A.S. Shcherbakov]] (1941\u201345), [[Solomon Lozovsky|S. A. Lozovsky]] (1945\u201348) and Y.S. Khavinson, D.A. Polikarpov.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\n[[File:Newspaper stall and women in East Berlin, with person in wheelchair, 1984.jpg|thumb|right|Novosti operated this East Berlin [[news stall]] in 1984.]]\nIn 1961, the Novosti Press Agency (APN) succeeded Sovinformburo. It became the leading information and press body of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] public organizations. The constituent conference was held on 21 February 1961. The conference of representatives of Soviet public organizations adopted a decision to create a press agency of public organizations named Novosti. The agency's guiding body was the Council of the Agency's Founders.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nThe APN founders were the USSR Journalists Union, USSR Writers Union, Union of Soviet Societies of Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the Znaniye Society. On 3 April 1961, the Agency charter was adopted. Under its charter, APN's aim was \"to contribute to mutual understanding, trust and friendship among peoples in every possible way by broadly publishing accurate information about the USSR abroad and familiarizing the Soviet public with the life of the peoples of foreign countries.\" APN's motto was \"Information for Peace, for the Friendship of Nations\". APN had bureaus in over 120 countries. The Agency published 60 illustrated newspapers and magazines in 45 languages with a one-time circulation of 4.3 million copies. With the Union of Soviet Friendship Societies, APN published the newspaper, ''Moscow News'', which in September 1990 became an independent publication. APN Publishing House put out over 200 books and booklets with a total annual circulation of 20 million copies. In 1989, a TV center opened in APN. Later, it was transformed into the TV-Novosti TV company.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nThe APN heads included Boris Burkov (1961\u201370), Ivan Udaltsov (1970\u201375), Lev Tolkunov (1975\u201383), Pavel Naumov (1983\u201386), [[Valentin Falin]] (1986\u201388), Albert Vlasov (1988\u201390).<ref name=\"about\"/>\n[[Image:Newsroom RIA Novosti, Moscow 2.jpg|right|thumb|240px|The newsroom of the agency, 2008]]\nBy a decree of USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev, \"On the Establishment of the Information Agency Novosti,\" the Information Agency Novosti (IAN) succeeded APN on 27 July 1990. \"To provide information support for the USSR's state domestic and foreign policies and proceeding from the interests of the democratization of the mass media,\" the Novosti Press Agency was renamed the Information Agency Novosti (IAN). IAN's tasks remained the same \u2013 preparing and publishing printed, TV and radio materials in the USSR and abroad; studying public opinion on Soviet foreign and domestic policies in the USSR and abroad.\" A computer databank was created in the Agency. Initially, it contained over 250,000 documents. In 1991, the Infonews hotline started operating in the Agency. IAN had bureaus in 120 countries. It published 13 illustrated magazines and newspapers.

By a [[Decree of the President of Russia|Presidential decree]] of the Russian president dated 22 August 1991, RIA Novosti was placed within the competence of the Press and Information Ministry. RIA Novosti had about 80 bureaus and news offices abroad, over 1,500 subscribers in CIS countries and about a hundred in non-CIS countries. A Presidential decree of the [[President of Russia|Russian president]] of 15 September 1993 \"''On the Russian Information Agency Novosti''\", transformed RIA Novosti to a state news-analytical agency. RIA Novosti's radio channel \u2013 RIA-Radio worked in 1996. In August 1997, the TV channel Kultura was set up on the basis of the RIA TV channel under the sponsorship of the [[VGTRK]] TV and radio broadcasting company. By a decree of the Russian president, \"On Improving the Work of the State Electronic Media,\" the VGTRK information holding was created in May 1998, which RIA Novosti joined.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nIn May 1998, the agency was renamed the Russian Information Agency Vesti. As a mass media body, it retained the name of RIA Novosti.<ref name=\"about\"/> In 2005, RIA Novosti launched [[RT (TV network)|RT]] (originally Russia Today) a global multilingual television news network, which is a government-funded but autonomous, [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]].

''RIA'' means ''Russian Information Agency'' and ''Novosti'' means ''News'' in Russian. The common abbreviation in Russian is RIA.\n\n==History==\nRIA Novosti's history dates back to 24 June 1941, when by a resolution of the [[Government of the Soviet Union|USSR Council of People's Commissars]] and the Communist Party Central Committee, \"''On the Establishment and Tasks of the Soviet Information Bureau''\", the [[Soviet Information Bureau]] (Sovinformburo) was set up under the USSR Council of People's Commissars and the Central Committee. Its main task was to oversee work to cover international, military events and the events of the country's domestic life in periodicals and on the radio (from 14 October 1941, to 3 March 1942, was based in Kuibyshev \u2013 modern-day Samara).<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nThe bureau's main task was to compile reports on the situation on the frontline of the war, work on the home front, and the partisan movement for the radio, newspapers and magazines. Sovinformburo directed the activity of the All-Slavonic Committee, Anti-Nazi Committee of Soviet Women, Anti-Nazi Committee of the Soviet Youth, Anti-Nazi Committee of Soviet Scientists, and the Jewish Anti-Nazi Committee. In 1944, a special bureau on propaganda for foreign countries was set up as part of Sovinformburo.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nThrough 1,171 newspapers, 523 magazines and 18 radio stations in 23 countries, Soviet embassies abroad, friendship societies, trade unions, women's, youth and scientific organizations, Sovinformburo informed readers and listeners about the struggle of the Soviet people against Nazism and in the post-war years about the main areas of Soviet domestic and foreign policies.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nSovinformburo heads included [[Aleksandr Shcherbakov (politician)|A.S. Shcherbakov]] (1941\u201345), [[Solomon Lozovsky|S. A. Lozovsky]] (1945\u201348) and Y.S. Khavinson, D.A. Polikarpov.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\n[[File:Newspaper stall and women in East Berlin, with person in wheelchair, 1984.jpg|thumb|right|Novosti operated this East Berlin [[news stall]] in 1984.]]\nIn 1961, the Novosti Press Agency (APN) succeeded Sovinformburo. It became the leading information and press body of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] public organizations. The constituent conference was held on 21 February 1961. The conference of representatives of Soviet public organizations adopted a decision to create a press agency of public organizations named Novosti. The agency's guiding body was the Council of the Agency's Founders.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nThe APN founders were the USSR Journalists Union, USSR Writers Union, Union of Soviet Societies of Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the Znaniye Society. On 3 April 1961, the Agency charter was adopted. Under its charter, APN's aim was \"to contribute to mutual understanding, trust and friendship among peoples in every possible way by broadly publishing accurate information about the USSR abroad and familiarizing the Soviet public with the life of the peoples of foreign countries.\" APN's motto was \"Information for Peace, for the Friendship of Nations\". APN had bureaus in over 120 countries. The Agency published 60 illustrated newspapers and magazines in 45 languages with a one-time circulation of 4.3 million copies. With the Union of Soviet Friendship Societies, APN published the newspaper, ''Moscow News'', which in September 1990 became an independent publication. APN Publishing House put out over 200 books and booklets with a total annual circulation of 20 million copies. In 1989, a TV center opened in APN. Later, it was transformed into the TV-Novosti TV company.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nThe APN heads included Boris Burkov (1961\u201370), Ivan Udaltsov (1970\u201375), Lev Tolkunov (1975\u201383), Pavel Naumov (1983\u201386), [[Valentin Falin]] (1986\u201388), Albert Vlasov (1988\u201390).<ref name=\"about\"/>\n[[Image:Newsroom RIA Novosti, Moscow 2.jpg|right|thumb|240px|The newsroom of the agency, 2008]]\nBy a decree of USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev, \"On the Establishment of the Information Agency Novosti,\" the Information Agency Novosti (IAN) succeeded APN on 27 July 1990. \"To provide information support for the USSR's state domestic and foreign policies and proceeding from the interests of the democratization of the mass media,\" the Novosti Press Agency was renamed the Information Agency Novosti (IAN). IAN's tasks remained the same \u2013 preparing and publishing printed, TV and radio materials in the USSR and abroad; studying public opinion on Soviet foreign and domestic policies in the USSR and abroad.\" A computer databank was created in the Agency. Initially, it contained over 250,000 documents. In 1991, the Infonews hotline started operating in the Agency. IAN had bureaus in 120 countries. It published 13 illustrated magazines and newspapers.

By a [[Decree of the President of Russia|Presidential decree]] of the Russian president dated 22 August 1991, RIA Novosti was placed within the competence of the Press and Information Ministry. RIA Novosti had about 80 bureaus and news offices abroad, over 1,500 subscribers in CIS countries and about a hundred in non-CIS countries. A Presidential decree of the [[President of Russia|Russian president]] of 15 September 1993 \"''On the Russian Information Agency Novosti''\", transformed RIA Novosti to a state news-analytical agency. RIA Novosti's radio channel \u2013 RIA-Radio worked in 1996. In August 1997, the TV channel Kultura was set up on the basis of the RIA TV channel under the sponsorship of the [[VGTRK]] TV and radio broadcasting company. By a decree of the Russian president, \"On Improving the Work of the State Electronic Media,\" the VGTRK information holding was created in May 1998, which RIA Novosti joined.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nIn May 1998, the agency was renamed the Russian Information Agency Vesti.
