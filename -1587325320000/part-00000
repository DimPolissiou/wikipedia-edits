Lee filled in for [[Clive Bull]] for two weeks in late 2004, until he presented on Friday-Sunday 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am.\n\nIn October 2005, Lee moved from weekends to the drivetime slot from 4{{nbsp}}pm to 7{{nbsp}}pm. Lee titled the show ''The 3 Hour 4 'Till 7 Iain Lee Afternoon Wireless Show.''. In January 2006, Lee moved again to 3{{nbsp}}pm to 6:30{{nbsp}}pm, with the show being renamed to ''The 3 and a Half Hour 3 'Till 6.30 Iain Lee Afternoon Wireless Show''.\n\nFor just over two years (9 September 2005 to 16 September 2007) Lee hosted \"Triple M\", a feature where calls go straight to air, live and unscreened. Other talk radio presenters have also hosted similar features, including [[Nick Abbot]], [[Tommy Boyd]] and [[Clive Bull]]. Initially, Lee would host the feature every Friday evening during the last half-hour of the show. Originally called \"Mental Mayhem\", it was renamed to \"Mick's Mental Mayhem\" (after a caller named Mick), then simply \"Triple M\". The rising popularity of the format, along with a change in show times in May 2006 led to Lee presenting a whole three-hour show on Sunday evenings from 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am to Triple M, being called \"Sunday Night Triple M\", from 7 May 2006 to 16 September 2007. At the time, management favoured the unique format as they hoped that it would introduce exclusive listeners to the radio station.\n\nFrom January 2007 to his resignation in November, Lee presented the evening slot from 7{{nbsp}}pm to 10{{nbsp}}pm preceding Bull in the newly titled show, \"''Iain Lee's Good Evening''\". Lee chose the name after seeking advice from his friend and comedian [[Mackenzie Crook]]. The afternoon show was taken over by then weekend breakfast show host [[Paul Ross]].\n\nA change of radio station management (when [[Global Radio]] purchased LBC) in mid-2007 led to the demise of the Sunday Night Triple M show altogether, with the last show on 16 September 2007.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/nov/06/commercialradio.radio?gusrc=rss&feed=media | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Lee leaves LBC evening slot | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=6 November 2007 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> Lee's style of presenting fell out of favour with the new management, with returning topical and news-led conversation.

Lee filled in for [[Clive Bull]] for two weeks in late 2004, until he presented on Friday-Sunday 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am.\n\nIn October 2005, Lee moved from weekends to the drivetime slot from 4{{nbsp}}pm to 7{{nbsp}}pm. Lee titled the show ''The 3 Hour 4 'Till 7 Iain Lee Afternoon Wireless Show.''. In January 2006, Lee moved again to 3{{nbsp}}pm to 6:30{{nbsp}}pm, with the show being renamed to ''The 3 and a Half Hour 3 'Till 6.30 Iain Lee Afternoon Wireless Show''.\n\nFor just over two years (9 September 2005 to 16 September 2007) Lee hosted \"Triple M\", a feature where calls go straight to air, live and unscreened. Other talk radio presenters have also hosted similar features, including [[Nick Abbot]], [[Tommy Boyd]] and [[Clive Bull]]. Initially, Lee would host the feature every Friday evening during the last half-hour of the show. Originally called \"Mental Mayhem\", it was renamed to \"Mick's Mental Mayhem\" (after a caller named Mick), then simply \"Triple M\". The rising popularity of the format, along with a change in show times in May 2006 led to Lee presenting a whole three-hour show on Sunday evenings from 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am to Triple M, being called \"Sunday Night Triple M\", from 7 May 2006 to 16 September 2007. At the time, management favoured the unique format as they hoped that it would introduce exclusive listeners to the radio station.\n\nFrom January 2007 to his resignation in November, Lee presented the evening slot from 7{{nbsp}}pm to 10{{nbsp}}pm preceding Bull in the newly titled show, \"''Iain Lee's Good Evening''\". Lee chose the name after seeking advice from his friend and comedian [[Mackenzie Crook]]. The afternoon show was taken over by then weekend breakfast show host [[Paul Ross]].\n\nA change of radio station management (when [[Global Radio]] purchased LBC) in mid-2007 led to the demise of the Sunday Night Triple M show altogether, with the last show on 16 September 2007.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/nov/06/commercialradio.radio?gusrc=rss&feed=media | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Lee leaves LBC evening slot | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=6 November 2007 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> Lee's style of presenting fell out of favour with the new management, with returning topical and news-led conversation.

Based on the [[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|1992 movie of the same name]] which in turn is based on the [[Dracula|1897 novel]] by [[Bram Stoker]], each version of the game was essentially identical (except for the Sega CD, Amiga and MS-DOS versions). The [[Amiga]] version was released in 1994 for North America and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/amiga/942753-bram-stokers-dracula/data |title=Bram Stoker's Dracula Release Information for Amiga |website=GameFAQs |date=1994-01-01 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref> A [[CD-ROM]] version for DOS was released in 1995.<ref>[http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/bram-stokers-dracula_/cover-art/gameCoverId,12275/ ''Bram Stoker's Dracula'' PC CD-ROM box artwork] (from MobyGames)</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nEach console has a different styled genre game based on the film, and in most games the single player character is [[Jonathan Harker]], who is one of the main protagonists of the Dracula film, and the [[Dracula|original novel]] by [[Bram Stoker]], which the film was based on.\n\n===8-bit versions===\n{{main|Bram Stoker's Dracula (handheld video game)}}\n\n'''''Bram Stoker's Dracula''''' for the [[Game Boy]] is a 1993 video game that bears a closer resemblance to platform games such as ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' than [[horror film]]s.\n\nThe player controls a young lawyer named [[Jonathan Harker]]. Harker must free himself from [[Dracula]]'s capture, follow him to [[London]], and end his reign of terror. It was voted to be the 21st worst video game of all time according to ''[[Flux (US)|FLUX]]'' magazine.\n\nThe game is also on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The gameplay is very similar to the Game Boy version, though the NES version has much smoother character animation, colors and better resolution. [[Master System]] and [[Game Gear]] versions of the game are also similar, but with a wider color palette and more shading effects.\n\n===16-bit versions===\nThe release for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] releases were platforming action games that are identical to each other, but have a few alterations depending on the version. In the game, the player takes on the role of [[Jonathan Harker]]. Throughout the levels, [[Abraham Van Helsing]] will help Jonathan in his quest by providing advanced weapons. The game is of the [[side-scrolling]] genre. In the game, Jonathan Harker travels through six different stages (each having between a number of areas, except for the final stage which only has one area) and fights various bosses, such as [[Lucy Westenra]] as a vampiress, [[Count Dracula|Count Dracula's]] three brides, Dracula's coach driver, Dracula's fire-breathing [[dragon]], [[Renfield]], and even Dracula himself in multiple forms, such as his [[bat]] form, his young form, his evil [[wolf]] form and finally his knight form. Levels in the game include the Romanian countryside, a rat-infested old village inn, Dracula's castle, Dracula's cavernous vaults, Dracula's misty catacombs, various locations in [[London]], Lucy's crypt, a graveyard and [[Purfleet|Carfax Abbey]].\n\n===Sega CD version===\nThe release for [[Sega CD]] makes use of digitized backgrounds and includes [[full motion video]] (FMV) cutscenes from the film. Released exclusively in [[North America]], the player controls [[Jonathan Harker]] as he travels through seven stages that are based on scenes from the film.\n\n===Amiga version===\nThe release for the [[Amiga]] uses digitized graphics for characters that were recycled from the Sega CD game. However, the setup is quite different. There are nine stages in the game to play through. Each stage has a primary task that involves finding and destroying all the coffins that have Transylvanian earth inside, in order to advance in the game, but the last coffin to be destroyed is guarded by one of Dracula's stronger minions, in each stage. Like in the Sega CD game, Jonathan Harker has to punch and kick his enemies. The player can restore health by finding potions, and extra lives are available to pick up as well. Picking up [[Christian cross|Holy Crosses]] allows the player to fire a long-ranged holy beam attack, but only for a short period of time. Staircases and doors can be used to travel throughout each stage.\n\n===DOS version===\nThe release for DOS is played from a first-person perspective, similar to other games like ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' or ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]''. In this version, Harker must traverse several large stages to locate and purify a varying number of coffins with holy wafers, while warding off various monsters with either a pistol or a knife. When all of the coffins in a stage are purified, Harker must then confront Dracula in one of three forms (his old man, young man, and original knight form).\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave the Sega CD version a 5.25 out of 10, commenting that the main character's movements are choppy, the battling with birds and bats is unimpressive and dull, and the [[full motion video]] sequences are so [[pixelated]] and blurry that it is difficult to make out what is going on.<ref>{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Dracula|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=54|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=January 1994|page=46}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated of the DOS version, \"It appears that Psygnosis spent most of their ''Dracula'' budget on acquiring the movie license, leaving little for game development and packaging.

Reception to the show was mostly positive. The series began airing from 20 October 1988, Thursday afternoons on BBC One part of Children's BBC for the first 10 episodes. The remaining three episodes of the series aired on BBC Two in a lunchtime slot.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe series tells the story of Charlie Chalk - a jolly [[clown]] who, after falling asleep whilst fishing out at sea, ends up on a strange [[island]] by the name of Merrytwit (as explained in the title sequence before each episode). Characters had to be aware of coconuts which constantly fell from the trees on the island.\n\nThe pilot episode of the series (entitled 'Shipwrecked Charlie') finds Charlie having just landed on Merrytwit, and after making friends with some of its inhabitants, decides to stay and build a home there. The following episodes follow Charlie and his new friends on various adventures on the island.\n\n==Main characters==\n* '''Charlie Chalk''': A good natured and friendly peaceful [[clown]], he was out on a fishing trip, when he ended up on Merrytwit Island. In the theme tune, he is described as having \"a funny way of walking and a wacky way of chalking\". He was voiced by [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]]. His 'funny way of walking' is demonstrated when on occasion he tumbles in an acrobatic circus-style through frames, around obstacles, or just to show folks how happy he is. He also has the ability to do [[magic (illusion)|magic]] tricks.\n* '''Captain Mildred''': The boss of the island (a parody of [[Margaret Thatcher]]), who loves to see everyone hard at work and has the practice of listing things that have to be done: \"a: do this; b: do that\" etc. She lives on the beached ship ''Buttercup''.\n* '''Mary the Hover Fairy''': An old [[fairy]] who often proves useful due to her ability to cast spells, provided her magic wand, Houdini, has not wandered off again. She is getting old, so has decided to settle down on Merrytwit. She now lives on ''Buttercup'', serving as Mildred's first mate.\n* '''Lewis T. Duck''': A small duck with a short temper. He is full of ideas, and believes them to be the best, so is quick to inform people that he is \"always right\". He can be quite friendly but lacks patience. The 'T' stands for 'The'.\n* '''Arnold the Elephant''': A pink [[elephant]], who is quite jolly, but also very clumsy, much to the annoyance of Lewis, who always seems to be on the receiving end of Arnold's bouts of clumsiness.\n* '''Edward''': A monkey who spends his time sleeping and has quite a dislike for work.\n* '''Trader Jones''': Trader is the island's odd job man. Not only does he drive a bike which acts as a taxi and a means of transporting goods, he also owns a general supplies store on the island: 'if you want it, he's got it.' He never accepts money, he only trades e.g. a supply of bananas may cost a day's beachcombing.\n* '''Bert''': An ogre, discovered by Charlie, Arnold and Lewis in the episode ''The Mountain that Moaned''. He lives inside a cave, and whilst an extremely friendly ogre, he is quite lacking in intelligence.\n* '''Litterbug''': A tiny little bug who is kept busy tidying up litter around the island. He often complains about the amount of litter, but does not realise there would be far less litter if his sack did not have a hole in it. Being so tiny, he is not always noticed, a fact which further frustrates him.\n\n==Episodes==\nThe series consisted of 13 original episodes, as listed below:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=99%\n|-\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" width=\"3%\" | '''#'''\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" width=\"25%\"| '''Title'''\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" | '''Summary'''\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" width=\"10%\"| '''Broadcast Date'''\n|-\n|'''1'''|| '''Shipwrecked Charlie ''' || Charlie Chalk lands on Merrytwit and meets Edward, Trader Jones, Captain Mildred, Arnold and Lewis T.
