Scholarly debates over the identity of Himiko and the location of her domain, Yamatai, have raged since the late [[Edo period]], with opinions divided between northern [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] or traditional [[Yamato province]] in present-day [[Kansai region|Kinki]]. The \"Yamatai controversy,\" writes Keiji Imamura (1996:188), is \"the greatest debate over the ancient history of Japan.\"\n\n==Historical references==\nThe shaman Queen Himiko is recorded in various ancient histories, dating back to 3rd-century China, 8th-century Japan, and 12th-century Korea.\n\n[[File:Text of the Wei Zhi (\u9b4f\u5fd7), 297.jpg|thumb|The \"Book of Wei\" part of the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]],'' {{circa|297}}]]\n\n===Chinese sources===\n\nThe first historical records of Himiko are found in a [[Chinese classic text]], the c. 297 ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' (''Sanguo Zhi'' \u4e09\u570b\u5fd7).

They formerly comprised more than one hundred communities. During the [[Han dynasty]], [Wa envoys] appeared at the Court; today, thirty of their communities maintain intercourse [with us] through envoys and scribes. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:8) </blockquote>\nThis early history describes how Himiko came to the throne:<blockquote>The country formerly had a man as ruler. For some seventy or eighty years after that there were disturbances and warfare. Thereupon the people agreed upon a woman for their ruler. Her name was Himiko [\u5351\u5f25\u547c]. She occupied herself with magic and sorcery, bewitching the people. Though mature in age, she remained unmarried. She had a younger brother who assisted her in ruling the country. After she became the ruler, there were few who saw her. She had one thousand women as attendants, but only one man. He served her food and drink and acted as a medium of communication. She resided in a palace surrounded by towers and stockades, with armed guards in a state of constant vigilance. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:13) </blockquote>\nThe \"Records of Wei\" also records envoys travelling between the Wa and Wei courts. Himiko's emissaries first visited the court of Wei emperor [[Cao Rui]] in 238, and he replied:<blockquote>Herein we address Himiko, Queen of Wa, whom we now officially call a friend of Wei. [\u2026Your envoys] have arrived here with your tribute, consisting of four male slaves and six female slaves, together with two pieces of cloth with designs, each twenty feet in length. You live very far away across the sea; yet you have sent an embassy with tribute. Your loyalty and [[filial piety]] we appreciate exceedingly. We confer upon you, therefore, the title \"Queen of Wa Friendly to Wei,\" together with the decoration of the gold seal with purple ribbon. The latter, properly encased, is to be sent to you through the Governor. We expect you, O Queen, to rule your people in peace and to endeavor to be devoted and obedient. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:14)</blockquote>\nFinally, the \"Records of Wei\" (tr. Tsunoda 1951:15) records that in 247 when a new governor arrived at [[Daifang Commandery]] in Korea, Queen Himiko officially complained of hostilities with {{nihongo|Himikuku|\u5351\u5f25\u5f13\u547c||or Pimikuku}}, the king of [[:ja:\u72d7\u5974\u56fd|Kunu]] (\u72d7\u5974, literally \"dog slave\"), one of the other Wa states. The governor dispatched \"Chang Ch\u00eang, acting Secretary of the Border Guard\" with a \"proclamation advising reconciliation\", and subsequently:<blockquote>When Himiko passed away, a great mound was raised, more than a hundred paces in diameter. Over a hundred male and female attendants followed her to the grave. Then a king was placed on the throne, but the people would not obey him. Assassination and murder followed; more than one thousand were thus slain. A relative of Himiko named [[Taiyoo|Iyo]] [\u58f9\u8207], a girl of thirteen, was [then] made queen and order was restored. Ch\u00eang issued a proclamation to the effect that Iyo was the ruler. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:16)</blockquote>\nCommentators take this {{nihongo|\"Iyo\"|\u58f9\u8207||with [[Wikt:\u58f9|\u58f9]] \"one,\" an old variant of [[Wikt:\u4e00|\u4e00]]}} as a miscopy of {{nihongo|Toyo|\u81fa\u8207||with [[Wikt:\u81fa|\u81fa]] \"platform; terrace,\"}} paralleling the ''Wei Zhi'' writing ''Yamatai'' {{lang|zh|\u90aa\u99ac\u81fa}} as ''Yamaichi.'' {{lang|zh|\u90aa\u99ac\u58f9}}\n\nTwo other Chinese dynastic histories mentioned Himiko. While both clearly incorporated the above ''Wei Zhi'' reports, they made some changes, such as specifying the \"some seventy or eighty years\" of Wa wars occurred between 146 and 189, during the reigns of Han Emperors [[Emperor Huan of Han|Huan]] and [[Emperor Ling of Han|Ling]]. The c. 432 ''[[Book of Later Han]]'' (''Hou Han Shu'' \u5f8c\u6f22\u66f8) says \"the King of Great Wa resides in the country of Yamadai\", rather than the Queen:<blockquote>The Wa dwell on mountainous islands southeast of Han [Korea] in the middle of the ocean, forming more than one hundred communities. From the time of the overthrow of Chaoxian [northern Korea] by Emperor Wu (B.C. 140-87), nearly thirty of these communities have held intercourse with the Han [dynasty] court by envoys or scribes. Each community has its king, whose office is hereditary. The King of Great Wa [Yamato] resides in the country of Yamadai. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:1)</blockquote> \u2026 <blockquote> During the reigns of [[emperor Huan of Han|Huan-di]] (147-168) and [[emperor Ling of Han|Ling-di]] (168-189), the country of Wa was in a state of great confusion, war and conflict raging on all sides. For a number of years, there was no ruler. Then a woman named Himiko appeared. Remaining unmarried, she occupied herself with magic and sorcery and bewitched the populace. Thereupon they placed her on the throne. She kept one thousand female attendants, but few people saw her. There was only one man who was in charge of her wardrobe and meals and acted as the medium of communication. She resided in a palace surrounded by towers and stockades with the protection of armed guards. The laws and customs were strict and stern. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:2-3)</blockquote>\nThe 636 ''[[Book of Sui]]'' (''Sui Shu'' \u968b\u66f8) changes the number of Himiko's male attendants:<blockquote>During the reigns of the Emperors Huan and Ling, that country was in great disorder, and there was no ruler for a period of years. [Then] a woman named Himiko attracted the populace by means of the practice of magic. The country became unified and made her queen. A younger brother assisted Himiko in the administration of the country. Queen [Himiko] kept one thousands maids in attendance. Her person was seldom seen. She had only two men [attendants]. They served her food and drink and acted as intermediaries. The Queen lived in a palace, which was surrounded by walls and stockades protected by armed guards; their discipline was extremely strict.

Tsunoda 1951:28-29)</blockquote>\n\n===Japanese sources===\nNeither of the two oldest Japanese histories \u2013 the c. 712 ''[[Kojiki]]''<ref>The ''Kojiki'' (\u53e4\u4e8b\u8a18 \"Records of Ancient Matters\"), tr. [[Basil Hall Chamberlain]] 1919.</ref> nor c. 720 ''[[Nihon Shoki]]''<ref>The ''Nihon Shoki'' (\u65e5\u672c\u66f8\u7d00 \"Chronicles of Japan\"), tr. [[William George Aston]] 1924.</ref> \u2013 mentions Queen Himiko. The circumstances under which these books were written is a matter of unending debate, and even if Himiko were known to the authors, they may have purposefully decided not to include her.<ref name=\":0\" /> (Hideyuki 2005) However, they include three imperial-family shamans identified with her: [[:ja:\u502d\u8ff9\u8ff9\u65e5\u767e\u8972\u59eb\u547d|Yamatototohimomosohime-no-Mikoto]], the aunt of [[Emperor Sujin]] (legendary 10th Japanese emperor, r. 97-30 BC) and daughter of [[Emperor K\u014drei]]; [[Yamatohime-no-mikoto]], the daughter of [[Emperor Suinin]] (legendary 11th, r. 29 BC-70 AD); and [[Empress Jing\u016b]] (r. c. 209-269 AD), the wife of [[Emperor Ch\u016bai]] (legendary 14th emperor, r. 192-200 AD). These dates, however, are not historically verified.\n\nOne remarkable exception to early Japanese histories overlooking Himiko is the ''Nihon Shoki'' quoting the ''Wei Zhi'' three times. In 239, \"the queen [\u5973\u738b] of Wa\" sent envoys to Wei; in 240, they returned \"charged with an Imperial [[rescript]] and a seal and ribbon;\" and in 243, \"the ruler [\u738b \"king\"] of Wa again sent high officers as envoys with tribute\" (tr. Aston 1924:245-6). It is revealing that the ''Nihon Shoki'' editors chose to omit the ''Wei Zhi'' particulars about Himiko.\n\n{{nihongo|Yamato Totohi Momoso himemiko|\u502d\u8ff9\u8ff9\u65e5\u767e\u8972\u5a9b\u547d}}, the shaman aunt of Emperor Sujin, supposedly committed suicide after learning her husband was a [[trickster]] snake-god. The ''Kojiki'' does not mention her, but the ''Nihon Shoki'' describes her as \"the Emperor's aunt by the father's side, a shrewd and intelligent person, who could foresee the future\" (tr. Aston 1924:156). After a series of national calamities, the Emperor \"assembled the 80 myriads of Deities\" and inquired by [[divination]]. Yamato-totohi-momoso was inspired by \u014cmononushi-nushi (\"Great Deity of All Deities and Spirits\", tr. Hori 1968:193) to say.\n\"Why is the Emperor grieved at the disordered state of the country? If he duly did us reverent worship it would assuredly become pacified of itself.\" The Emperor inquired, saying: \"What God is it that thus instructs me?\" The answer was: \"I am the God who dwells within the borders of the land of Yamato, and my name is Oho-mono-nushi no Kami.\" (tr. Aston 1924:152) \nWhile imperial worship of this god (from [[Mount Miwa]]) was \"without effect\", Yamato-totohi-momoso later married him.\n<blockquote>After this Yamato-toto-hi-momo-so-bime no Mikoto became the wife of Oho-mono-nushi no Kami. This God, however, was never seen in the day-time, but at night. Yamato-toto-hi-momo-so-bime no Mikoto said to her husband: \"As my Lord is never seen in the day-time, I am unable to view his august countenance distinctly; I beseech him therefore to delay a while, that in the morning I may look upon the majesty of his beauty.\" The Great God answered and said: \"What thou sayest is clearly right. To-morrow morning I will enter thy toilet-case and stay there. I [[pray thee]] be not alarmed at my form.\" Yamato-toto-hi-momo-so-bime no Mikoto wondered secretly in her heart at this. Waiting until daybreak, she looked into her toilet-case. There was there a beautiful little snake, of the length and thickness of the cord of a garment. Thereupon she was frightened, and uttered an exclamation. The Great God was ashamed, and changing suddenly into human form, spake to his wife, and said: \"Thou didst not contain thyself, but hast caused me shame; I will in my turn put thee to shame.\" So treading the Great Void, he ascended to Mount Mimoro. Hereupon Yamato-toto-hi-momo-so-bime no Mikoto looked up and had remorse. She flopped down on a seat and with a chopstick stabbed herself in the pudenda so that she died. She was buried at Oho-chi. Therefore the men of that time called her tomb the Hashi no haka [Chopstick Tomb]. (tr. Aston 1924:158-9) </blockquote>\nThe {{nihongo|{{ill|Hashihaka|ja|\u7bb8\u5893\u53e4\u58b3}}|\u7bb8\u5893|\"Chopstick Tomb\"}} [[Kofun]] in [[Sakurai, Nara]] is associated with this legend.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{nihongo|[[Yamatohime-no-mikoto]]|\u502d\u59eb\u547d}}, the daughter of Emperor Suinin, supposedly founded the [[Ise Shrine]] to the sun-goddess [[Amaterasu]]. The ''Kojiki'' records her as the fourth of Suinin's five children, \"Her Augustness Yamato-hime, (was the high-priestess of the temple of the Great Deity of Ise)\" (tr. Chamberlain 1919:227). The ''Nihon Shoki'' likewise records \"Yamato-hime no Mikoto\" (tr. Aston 1924:150) and provides more details. The Emperor assigned Yamatohime to find a permanent location for Amaterasu's shrine, and after wandering for years, the sun-goddess instructed her to build it at [[Ise, Mie|Ise]] \"where she first descended from Heaven\" (tr. Aston 1924:176).\n\nEmpress Consort Jing\u016b (or Jing\u014d \u795e\u529f) supposedly served as [[regent]] after the death of her husband Emperor Ch\u016bai (c. 200) until the accession of her son [[Emperor \u014cjin]] (legendary 15th emperor, r. 270-310). The ''Kojiki'' (Chamberlain 1919:283-332) and ''Nihon Shoki'' (Aston 1924:217-271) have similar accounts. Emperor Ch\u016bai wanted to invade [[Kumaso]], and while he was consulting with his ministers, Jing\u016b conveyed a shamanistic message that he should invade [[Silla]] instead. Compare these.\n<blockquote>Her Augustness Princess Okinaga-tarashi, was at that time, divinely possessed \u2026 charged him with this instruction and counsel: \"There is a land to the Westward, and in that land is abundance of various treasures dazzling to the eye, from gold and silver downwards. I will now bestow this land upon thee.\" (tr. Chamberlain 1919:284-5). \n\nAt this time a certain God inspired the Empress and instructed her, saying: \"Why should the Emperor be troubled because the Kumaso do not yield submission? It is a land wanting in backbone. Is it worth while raising an army to attack it? There is a better land than this, a land of treasure, which may be compared to the aspect of a beautiful woman \u2013 the land of Mukatsu [Opposite; Across], dazzling to the eyes. In that land there are gold and silver and bright colours in plenty. It is called the Land of Silla of the coverlet of paper-mulberry. If thou worshippest me aright, the land will assuredly yield submission freely, and the edge of thy sword shall not be all stained with blood.\" (tr. Aston 1924:221). </blockquote>\n(The 2005:284 reprint of Chamberlain adds a footnote after \"possessed\": \"Himeko [sic] in the Chinese historical notices of Japan was skilled in magic, with which she deluded the people.\") The Emperor thought the gods were lying, said he had only seen ocean to the West, and then died, either immediately (''Kojiki'') or after invading Kumaso (''Nihon Shoki''). Jing\u016b allegedly discovered she was pregnant, personally planned and led a successful conquest of Silla, gave birth to the future emperor, and returned to rule Yamato. The ''Nihon Shoki'' (tr. Aston 1924:225) adds that since Jing\u016b wanted to learn which gods had cursed Ch\u016bai, she constructed a shamanic \"palace of worship\", \"discharged in person the office of priest\", and heard the gods reveal themselves as coming from Ise (Amaterasu) and Mukatsu (an unnamed Korean divinity). Although the ''Kojiki'' and ''Nihon Shoki'' myth-histories called Jing\u016b first of the [[Japanese empresses]], [[Meiji period]] historians removed her from the [[List of Emperors of Japan]], leaving [[Empress Suiko]] (r. 593-628) as the first historically verifiable female Japanese ruler.\n\n===Korean sources===\nThe oldest Korean history book, the 1145 ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' (\u4e09\u570b\u53f2\u8a18 \"Chronicles of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three [Korean] Kingdoms]]\") records that Queen Himiko sent an [[Diplomat|emissary]] to King [[Adalla of Silla]] in May 173 (Saeki 1988:35, 113, 154).\n\n==Interpretations==\nResearchers have struggled to reconcile Himiko/Pimiko between the Chinese and Japanese historical sources above. While the ''Wei Zhi'' described her as an important ruler in 3rd-century Japan, early Japanese historians purposely avoided naming Himiko, even when the ''Nihon Shoki'' quoted the ''Wei Zhi'' about envoys from Wa.\n\n===Name===\nThe three [[Chinese characters]] {{script|Hani|\u5351\u5f4c\u547c}} ([[shinjitai|simplified]]: {{script|Hani|\u5351\u5f25\u547c}}) transcribing the Wa regent's name are read {{transl|ja|himiko}} or {{transl|ja|hibiko}} in Modern [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and {{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|b\u0113im\u00edh\u016b}} or {{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|b\u00ecm\u00edh\u016b}} in [[Modern Standard Chinese]]. However, these contemporary readings differ considerably from how \"Himiko\" was pronounced in the 3rd century, both by speakers of the unknown Wa-language and by Chinese scribes who transcribed it. While [[transliteration into Chinese characters]] of foreign words is complex; the choice of these three particular characters is puzzling, with literal meanings [[Wikt:\u5351|\u5351]] \"low; inferior; humble\", [[Wikt:\u5f4c|\u5f4c]] ([[Wikt:\u5f25|\u5f25]]) \"fill, cover; full; whole, complete\", and [[Wikt:\u547c|\u547c]] \"breathe out; exhale; cry out; call\".{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn terms of [[historical Chinese phonology]], modern ''beimihu'' ({{lang|zh|\u5351\u5f4c\u547c}}) is simpler than its presumed 3rd-century late [[Old Chinese]] or early [[Middle Chinese]] pronunciation. Compare the following reconstructions of the name in \"[[Archaic Chinese|Archaic]]\" or \"[[Middle Chinese]]\" ([[Bernhard Karlgren]], [[Li Fanggui]], and William H. Baxter), \"[[Early Middle Chinese]]\" (Edwin G. Pulleyblank), and, historically closest, \"Late [[Han dynasty|Han]] Chinese\" (Axel Schuessler).\n*''pji\u1e19mji\u1e19\u03c7uo'' (Karlgren)\n*''pjiemjie\u03c7wo'' (Li)\n*''pjiumjieXxu'' (Baxter)\n*''pjimji\u03c7\u0254'' or ''pji\u0259\u030cmji\u0259\u030c\u03c7\u0254'' (Pulleyblank)\n*''piemieh\u0251'' (Schuessler)\nTo simplify without using special symbols, the first two syllables with ''p(j)-'' and ''m(j)-'' initial consonants share ''-i(e)'' final vowels, and the third has either a [[voiceless]] [[fricative]] ''X-'' or a [[voiced]] fricative ''h-'' plus a back [[mid vowel]] ''-u(o)''. Thus, \"Himiko\" could be hypothetically reconstructed as *''P(j)i(e)m(j)i(e)hu(o)''.\n\nIn terms of historical [[Japanese phonology]], the accepted modern reading of ''himiko'' would regularly correspond to [[Old Japanese]] ''*Fimeko''. However, [[Roy Andrew Miller]] says ''*Fimeko'' is a [[lexicographic error]] deriving from the ''Wei Zhi'' transcriptions.\n<blockquote> Most perplexing of the entire list is the name of the queen of the Yeh-ma-t'ai community, ''Pi-mi-hu'', Middle Chinese ''pji\u1e19-mji\u1e19-\u03c7uo''. This has traditionally been explained and understood in Japan as a transcription of a supposed Old Japanese form ''*Fimeko'', said to be an early term meaning \"high born woman; princess,\" and to derive from Old Japanese ''Fime'' [or ''Fi<sub>1</sub>me<sub>1</sub>''] (also sometimes ''Fim\u00eb'' [''Fi<sub>1</sub>me<sub>2</sub>'']), a laudatory title for women going with ''Fiko'' [''Fi<sub>1</sub>ko<sub>1</sub>''] for men. Later ''Fime'' comes to mean \"princess,\" but this meaning is anachronistic for the earlier texts. \u2026 The difficulty concerns the supposed Old Japanese word ''*Fimeko''. Even though such a form has found its way into a few modern Japanese dictionaries (for example even Kindaiichi's otherwise generally reliable ''Jikai''), it is in fact simply one of the ghost words of Japanese lexicography; when it does appear in modern lexical sources, it is a \"made-up\" form listed there solely on the basis of the ''Wei chih'' account of early Japan. There never was an Old Japanese ''*Fimeko''; furthermore, the Middle Chinese spirant ''\u03c7'' of the transcription suggests that the final element of the unknown original term did not correspond to Old Japanese ''-ko'' [''-ko<sub>1</sub>''], which is rendered elsewhere \u2013 in ''Fiko'' [''Fi<sub>1</sub>ko<sub>1</sub>''], for example \u2013 with Middle Chinese ''-k-'' as one would expect. The final element of this transcription, then, remains obscure, thought there is certainly a good chance that the first portion does correspond to a form related to Old Japanese ''Fime''. Beyond that, it is at present impossible to go. (1967:22) </blockquote>\n''Hime'' < Old Japanese ''Fi<sub>1</sub>me<sub>1</sub>'' ([[Wikt:\u59eb|\u59eb]] \"young noblewoman; princess\"), explains Miller, etymologically derives from ''hi'' < ''Fi<sub>1</sub>'' ([[Wikt:\u65e5|\u65e5]] \"sun\") and ''me'' < ''me<sub>1</sub>'' ([[Wikt:\u5973|\u5973]] \"woman\").\n\nTsunoda (1951:5) notes \"Pimiko is from an archaic Japanese title, ''himeko'', meaning 'princess',\" that is, ''hime'' with the female name suffix {{Nihongo||\u5b50|-ko|\"child\"}}, viz. the uncommon [[given name]] [[Himeko]]. Other Amaterasu-related etymological proposals for the [[Japanese name]] Himiko involve {{Nihongo||\u65e5|hi|\"sun\"}} and {{Nihongo||[[Wikt: \u89a1|\u89a1]]|[[miko]]| or {{lang|ja-Hani|\u5deb\u5973}} \"female shaman, shamaness; shrine maiden; priestess\"}}; or their combination ''hime-miko'' \"princess-priestess\".{{citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=Himemiko was a real title for princesses, as opposed to plain Miko for princes. In this case, Miko may simply mean \"noble person ('child')\" rather specifically \"priestess\".}}\n\nBentley (2008:18-20) considers the [[Baekje language|Paekche]] word *{{lang|pkc|pye}} 'west', the [[honorific]] prefix *{{lang|pkc|me}} and *{{lang|pkc|h\u0254}} 'heir' and thus interprets {{script|Hani|\u5351\u5f4c\u547c}} as 'the honorific heir of the west'.\n\nAlthough ''[[man'y\u014dgana]]'', Chinese characters used to spell out Japanese sounds, rose in prominence some time after the ''Wei Zhi'', it is notable that the ''man'y\u014dgana'' spelling {{script|Hani|\u5351\u5f4c\u547c}} could be hypothetically reconstructed as *''Pjimjiwo''.  This could be construed as undercutting Tsunoda's hypothesis, which requires final ''-ko'', and as possibly bolstering Bentley's argument.\n\n===Identity and historicity===\nIdentifying Himiko/Pimiko of Wa is straightforward within the [[history of China]], but problematic within the [[history of Japan]]. The 3rd-century Chinese ''Wei Zhi'' (\"[[Records of the Three Kingdoms|Records of Wei]]\") provides details about shaman Queen Himiko and her communications with Emperors [[Cao Rui]] and [[Cao Fang]]. The 8th-century Japanese ''Kojiki'' (\"Records of Ancient Matters\") and ''Nihon Shoki'' (\"Chronicles of Japan\", which quotes the ''Wei Zhi'') disregard Himiko, unless she was the [[subtext]] behind their accounts of [[Empress Jing\u016b]], [[Yamatohime-no-mikoto]], or [[:ja:\u502d\u8ff9\u8ff9\u65e5\u767e\u8972\u59eb\u547d|Yamatototohimomosohime-no-Mikoto]].\n\nNone of these three legendary Japanese royal shamans adequately corresponds with the Chinese chronology and description of Himiko. Assuming the ''Wei Zhi'' account that Himiko died around 248, if one accepts the dubious Japanese traditional dating, then she was closer to the 3rd-century AD Empress Jing\u016b than to the 1st-century BC Yamatohime-no-mikoto and Yamato-totohi-momoso-hime. On the other hand, if one accepts the postdating adjustments prior to the 4th century, then Himiko was closer to these Yamato-named shamans. Neither ''Kojiki'' nor ''Nihon Shoki'' mentions Himiko or any of the salient topics that she was unmarried, was chosen as ruler by the people, had a younger brother who helped rule (unless this refers to Jing\u016b's son), or had numerous (figuratively \"1000\") female attendants.\n\nWilliam Wayne {{Harvnb | Farris | 1998 | pp = 15\u201354}} reviews the history of scholarly debates over Himiko and her domain Yamatai. The [[Edo period|Edo-period]] philosophers [[Arai Hakuseki]] and [[Motoori Norinaga]] began the controversies over whether Yamatai was located in Kyushu or Yamato and whether the ''Wei Zhi'' or the ''Nihon Shoki'' was historically more trustworthy. The [[Confucianist]] Arai accepted the Chinese history as more reliable, and first equated Himiko with Jing\u016b and Yamatai with Yamato. The [[Kokugaku]] scholar Motoori accepted the traditional Japanese myth-history as more reliable, and dismissed its ''Wei Zhi'' quotations as later accretions. He hypothesized that a king from [[Kumaso]] sent emissaries who masqueraded as Jing\u016b's officials to the Wei court, thus leading Wei to mistake them for representatives of Himiko. {{Harvnb | Farris | 1998 | p = 16}} says, \"Motoori's usurpation hypothesis (''gisen setsu'') carried great weight for the next century.\"\n\nRather than Yamataikoku, Himiko may have been linked with [[Nakoku]], quoted as \"the Na state of Wa\" in Kyushu, for which was sent a golden royal seal, by [[Emperor Guangwu]] of the [[Han dynasty]]. Na is said to have existed from the 1st century to the early 3rd century, and seems to have been independent or even a rival of the Japanese Emperors in the Yamato province.\n\nAfter the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, Japanese historians adopted European historical scholarship, especially the source-based methodology of [[Leopold von Ranke]]. Naka Michiyo believed the ''Nihon Shoki'' chronology was inaccurate prior to the 4th century, and thus {{Harv | Farris | 1998 | p = 17}} \"Jing\u016b became a fourth-century queen whose reign could not possibly have coincided with Himiko's.\" The [[sinologist]] [[Shiratori Kurakichi]] proposed the ''Nihon Shoki'' compilers were tempted to associate Jing\u016b with the religious powers of Himiko. [[Nait\u014d Torajir\u014d]] argued that Himiko was the high priestess of the Ise shrine Yamatohime-no-mikoto and that Wa armies obtained control of southern Korea. \n{{Quote | One scholar [Higo Kazuo] asserted that Himiko was really Yamato-toto-momo-so-hime-no-mikoto, aunt of the legendary Emperor S\u016bjin on his father's side, because her supposed tomb at Hashihaka in Nara measured about a hundred paces in diameter, the measurement given for Himiko's grave. This theory gained adherents in the postwar period. Another [Shida Fudomaru] saw in Himiko an expression of women's political authority in early Japan. | {{Harvnb | Farris | 1998 | p = 20}}}}\n\nSome later Japanese historians reframed Himiko in terms of [[Marxist historiography]]. Masaaki Ueda argued that \"Himiko's was a [[despotic]] state with a generalized slave system\" {{Harv | Farris | 1998 | p = 21}}, while Mitsusada Inoue idealized Yamatai as a \"balance of small states\" with [[communal property]] and popular political expression. Following the late 1960s \"Yamatai boom\", when numerous Japanese historians, linguists, and archeologists published reevaluations of Himiko and Yamatai, the debate was joined by [[Japanese nationalists]], mystery writers, and amateur scholars.\n\nIn Japanese historical and archeological [[periodization]], the 2nd- and 3rd-century era of Queen Himiko was between late [[Yayoi period]] and early [[Kofun period]]. ''[[Kofun]]'' (\u53e4\u58b3 \"old tumulus\") refers to characteristic keyhole-shaped burial mounds, and the ''Wei Zhi'' noting \"a great mound was raised, more than a hundred paces in diameter\" for Pimiko's tomb, may well be the earliest written record of a ''kofun''. Several archeological excavations of Yayoi and Kofun sites in kinki region, have revealed Chinese-style bronze mirrors, called ''[[shinju-kyo]]'' (\u795e\u7363\u93e1 \"mirror decorated with gods and animals\"). Many scholars who support the Kinki theory associate these ''shinju-kyo'' with the \"one hundred bronze mirrors\" that the ''Wei Zhi'' {{Harv | Tsunoda | 1951 | p = 15}} records Emperor Cao Rui presented to Queen Himiko, while other scholars oppose it ({{Harvnb | Edwards | 1998}}, 1999). Hashihaka kofun in [[Sakurai, Nara]] was given a recent boost by radio-carbon dating circa 240\u201360 {{Harv | Japan Times | 2009}}.  The early Chinese records of Himiko/Pimiko and her Yamatai polity remain something of a [[Rorschach test]]. To different interpreters, this early Japanese shaman queen can appear as evidence of [[communalism]] (Marxists), [[J\u014dmon]] priestess rulers ([[Feminist history]]), Japanese conquest of Korea {{Harv | Akima | 1993}}, [[Mongolia]]n conquest of Japan (Namio Egami's \"[[:ja:\u9a0e\u99ac\u6c11\u65cf\u5f81\u670d\u738b\u671d\u8aac|horserider theory]]\"), the imperial system originating with tandem rule by a female shaman and male monarch {{Harv |Mori | 1979}}, the \"[[patriarchal]] revolution\" replacing female deities and priestesses with male counterparts {{Harv | Ellwood | 1990}}, or a shamanic advisor to the federation of Wa chieftains who \"must have looked like a ruling queen to Chinese envoys\" {{Harv | Matsumoto | 1983}}.\n\n=== Modern depictions ===\nDepictions of Himiko in Japanese popular media take one of three archetypes: Himiko as a wise, old ruler; Himiko the cute and spunky shaman; or Himiko as a seductive sorceress.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Diva Nation|last=Miller|first=Laura|publisher=University of California Press|year=2018|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=51\u201379|chapter=Searching for charisma Queen Himiko}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> She is associated with several ritual objects including the dotaku - two large bronze bells ritually used at the end of the Yayoi period - as well as the [[Cleyera japonica|sakaki]] branch and Chinese bronze mirrors. Wei zhi described Himiko's shamanism as ''guidao'', or Japanese ''kido'', a type of Daoist folk religion. As such, Himiko is sometimes negatively associated with black magic or demons. Ruling in the transitional period between the [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] and [[Kofun period|Kofun]] eras, depictions of Himiko often display her wearing clothing originating from a variety of time periods, often embodied masculine elements. A queen during the late Yayoi, Himiko likely wore a one-piece, wide-sleeved [[kosode]] under a vest and sash. She is also often depicted wearing [[magatama]] beads and a diadem. However, no one can be certain what Himiko wore.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHimiko also receives wicked interpretations, such as a sorceress or tyrant. Such depictions usually cast Himiko as a seductress in sexually revealing clothing, large breasts, and compromising positions, seeming to assert that Himiko's power arose from nefarious sexual appeal. One such depiction appears in the online role-playing game [[Atlantica Online]], in which Himiko appears a [[Steampunk fashion|steampunk]] mercenary in revealing costume. These depictions cater largely to the [[otaku]] fan base.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Manga and Graphic Novels ====\nHimiko has appeared as a subject in various manga issues. She has appeared on the cover of [[Kamui Fujiwara|Fujiwara Kamui's]] ''Himiko: Sh\u016bkan manga Nihonshi'' and on Gakken's manga ''Nihon no Rekishi'' by \u014cishi Manabu, Takano Kazuhiro, and Himekawa Akira.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Town mascots ====\nHimiko's legend has been used to market a variety of objects.<ref name=\":1\" /> Various small towns seek to use Himiko as their mascot, claiming their town as her birthplace, although the archaeological evidence supports regions in the Nara basin as her capital.  Yoshinogari City and [[Sakurai, Nara|Sakurai]] City in [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]] prefecture both employ images of Himiko to attract tourists, using images such as chibi Himiko-chan welcoming travelers to the region.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Sales ====\n[[Sanrio]] has also created a Himiko-inspired keychain.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nResearcher Laura Miller recounts eating a dish named for Himiko at Shinobuan Cafe in [[Moriyama, Shiga|Moriyama]] City, where the name apparently gave rise to the popularity of the dish.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Himiko contests ====\nQueen Himiko Contests take place in small towns offering cash prizes to women over the age of eighteen on the basis of charm and appearance. One of the earliest of these contests began in Yamatokoriyama in Nara. One such contest, Himikon, takes place in Moriyama City. [[Asakura, Fukuoka|Asakura]] in Kyushu also holds a Himiko contest during its annual [[Yamataikoku]] Festival of Flowers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Namesake==\n[[Image:Amatetsu AR401.jpg|thumb|An [[Amagi Railway]] train, ''Himiko'', at [[Kiyama Station (Saga)|Kiyama Station]]]] \n[[Image:Himiko Cruise Ship.jpg|thumb|A water taxi in [[Tokyo Bay]] named ''Himiko'']]\nThe [[proper name]] Himiko has been diversely applied, not only in Japanese society but also in other realms such as [[astronomy]].

Early [[Twenty-Four Histories|Chinese dynastic histories]] chronicle [[tribute|tributary]] relations between Queen Himiko and the [[Cao Wei]] Kingdom (220\u2013265), and record that the [[Yayoi period]] people chose her as ruler following [[Civil war of Wa|decades of warfare among the kings of Wa]]. Early Japanese histories do not mention Himiko, but historians associate her with legendary figures such as Empress Consort [[Empress Jing\u016b|Jing\u016b]], who was [[regent]] (c. 200\u2013269) in roughly the same era as Himiko. Scholarly debates over the identity of Himiko and the location of her domain, Yamatai, have raged since the late [[Edo period]], with opinions divided between northern [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] or traditional [[Yamato province]] in present-day [[Kansai region|Kinki]]. The \"Yamatai controversy,\" writes Keiji Imamura (1996:188), is \"the greatest debate over the ancient history of Japan.\"\n\n==Historical references==\nThe shaman Queen Himiko is recorded in various ancient histories, dating back to 3rd-century China, 8th-century Japan, and 12th-century Korea.\n\n[[File:Text of the Wei Zhi (\u9b4f\u5fd7), 297.jpg|thumb|The \"Book of Wei\" part of the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]],'' {{circa|297}}]]\n\n===Chinese sources===\n\nThe first historical records of Himiko are found in a [[Chinese classic text]], the c. 297 ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' (''Sanguo Zhi'' \u4e09\u570b\u5fd7).

They formerly comprised more than one hundred communities. During the [[Han dynasty]], [Wa envoys] appeared at the Court; today, thirty of their communities maintain intercourse [with us] through envoys and scribes. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:8) </blockquote>\nThis early history describes how Himiko came to the throne:<blockquote>The country formerly had a man as ruler. For some seventy or eighty years after that there were disturbances and warfare. Thereupon the people agreed upon a woman for their ruler. Her name was Himiko [\u5351\u5f25\u547c]. She occupied herself with magic and sorcery, bewitching the people. Though mature in age, she remained unmarried. She had a younger brother who assisted her in ruling the country. After she became the ruler, there were few who saw her. She had one thousand women as attendants, but only one man. He served her food and drink and acted as a medium of communication. She resided in a palace surrounded by towers and stockades, with armed guards in a state of constant vigilance. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:13) </blockquote>\nThe \"Records of Wei\" also records envoys travelling between the Wa and Wei courts. Himiko's emissaries first visited the court of Wei emperor [[Cao Rui]] in 238, and he replied:<blockquote>Herein we address Himiko, Queen of Wa, whom we now officially call a friend of Wei. [\u2026Your envoys] have arrived here with your tribute, consisting of four male slaves and six female slaves, together with two pieces of cloth with designs, each twenty feet in length. You live very far away across the sea; yet you have sent an embassy with tribute. Your loyalty and [[filial piety]] we appreciate exceedingly. We confer upon you, therefore, the title \"Queen of Wa Friendly to Wei,\" together with the decoration of the gold seal with purple ribbon. The latter, properly encased, is to be sent to you through the Governor. We expect you, O Queen, to rule your people in peace and to endeavor to be devoted and obedient. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:14)</blockquote>\nFinally, the \"Records of Wei\" (tr. Tsunoda 1951:15) records that in 247 when a new governor arrived at [[Daifang Commandery]] in Korea, Queen Himiko officially complained of hostilities with {{nihongo|Himikuku|\u5351\u5f25\u5f13\u547c||or Pimikuku}}, the king of [[:ja:\u72d7\u5974\u56fd|Kunu]] (\u72d7\u5974, literally \"dog slave\"), one of the other Wa states. The governor dispatched \"Chang Ch\u00eang, acting Secretary of the Border Guard\" with a \"proclamation advising reconciliation\", and subsequently:<blockquote>When Himiko passed away, a great mound was raised, more than a hundred paces in diameter. Over a hundred male and female attendants followed her to the grave. Then a king was placed on the throne, but the people would not obey him. Assassination and murder followed; more than one thousand were thus slain. A relative of Himiko named [[Taiyoo|Iyo]] [\u58f9\u8207], a girl of thirteen, was [then] made queen and order was restored. Ch\u00eang issued a proclamation to the effect that Iyo was the ruler. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:16)</blockquote>\nCommentators take this {{nihongo|\"Iyo\"|\u58f9\u8207||with [[Wikt:\u58f9|\u58f9]] \"one,\" an old variant of [[Wikt:\u4e00|\u4e00]]}} as a miscopy of {{nihongo|Toyo|\u81fa\u8207||with [[Wikt:\u81fa|\u81fa]] \"platform; terrace,\"}} paralleling the ''Wei Zhi'' writing ''Yamatai'' {{lang|zh|\u90aa\u99ac\u81fa}} as ''Yamaichi.'' {{lang|zh|\u90aa\u99ac\u58f9}}\n\nTwo other Chinese dynastic histories mentioned Himiko. While both clearly incorporated the above ''Wei Zhi'' reports, they made some changes, such as specifying the \"some seventy or eighty years\" of Wa wars occurred between 146 and 189, during the reigns of Han Emperors [[Emperor Huan of Han|Huan]] and [[Emperor Ling of Han|Ling]]. The c. 432 ''[[Book of Later Han]]'' (''Hou Han Shu'' \u5f8c\u6f22\u66f8) says \"the King of Great Wa resides in the country of Yamadai\", rather than the Queen:<blockquote>The Wa dwell on mountainous islands southeast of Han [Korea] in the middle of the ocean, forming more than one hundred communities. From the time of the overthrow of Chaoxian [northern Korea] by Emperor Wu (B.C. 140-87), nearly thirty of these communities have held intercourse with the Han [dynasty] court by envoys or scribes. Each community has its king, whose office is hereditary. The King of Great Wa [Yamato] resides in the country of Yamadai. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:1)</blockquote> \u2026 <blockquote> During the reigns of [[emperor Huan of Han|Huan-di]] (147-168) and [[emperor Ling of Han|Ling-di]] (168-189), the country of Wa was in a state of great confusion, war and conflict raging on all sides. For a number of years, there was no ruler. Then a woman named Himiko appeared. Remaining unmarried, she occupied herself with magic and sorcery and bewitched the populace. Thereupon they placed her on the throne. She kept one thousand female attendants, but few people saw her. There was only one man who was in charge of her wardrobe and meals and acted as the medium of communication. She resided in a palace surrounded by towers and stockades with the protection of armed guards. The laws and customs were strict and stern. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:2-3)</blockquote>\nThe 636 ''[[Book of Sui]]'' (''Sui Shu'' \u968b\u66f8) changes the number of Himiko's male attendants:<blockquote>During the reigns of the Emperors Huan and Ling, that country was in great disorder, and there was no ruler for a period of years. [Then] a woman named Himiko attracted the populace by means of the practice of magic. The country became unified and made her queen. A younger brother assisted Himiko in the administration of the country. Queen [Himiko] kept one thousands maids in attendance. Her person was seldom seen. She had only two men [attendants]. They served her food and drink and acted as intermediaries. The Queen lived in a palace, which was surrounded by walls and stockades protected by armed guards; their discipline was extremely strict. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:28-29)</blockquote>\n\n===Japanese sources===\nNeither of the two oldest Japanese histories \u2013 the c. 712 ''[[Kojiki]]''<ref>The ''Kojiki'' (\u53e4\u4e8b\u8a18 \"Records of Ancient Matters\"), tr. [[Basil Hall Chamberlain]] 1919.</ref> nor c. 720 ''[[Nihon Shoki]]''<ref>The ''Nihon Shoki'' (\u65e5\u672c\u66f8\u7d00 \"Chronicles of Japan\"), tr. [[William George Aston]] 1924.</ref> \u2013 mentions Queen Himiko. The circumstances under which these books were written is a matter of unending debate, and even if Himiko were known to the authors, they may have purposefully decided not to include her.<ref name=\":0\" /> (Hideyuki 2005) However, they include three imperial-family shamans identified with her: [[:ja:\u502d\u8ff9\u8ff9\u65e5\u767e\u8972\u59eb\u547d|Yamatototohimomosohime-no-Mikoto]], the aunt of [[Emperor Sujin]] (legendary 10th Japanese emperor, r. 97-30 BC) and daughter of [[Emperor K\u014drei]]; [[Yamatohime-no-mikoto]], the daughter of [[Emperor Suinin]] (legendary 11th, r. 29 BC-70 AD); and [[Empress Jing\u016b]] (r. c. 209-269 AD), the wife of [[Emperor Ch\u016bai]] (legendary 14th emperor, r. 192-200 AD). These dates, however, are not historically verified.\n\nOne remarkable exception to early Japanese histories overlooking Himiko is the ''Nihon Shoki'' quoting the ''Wei Zhi'' three times. In 239, \"the queen [\u5973\u738b] of Wa\" sent envoys to Wei; in 240, they returned \"charged with an Imperial [[rescript]] and a seal and ribbon;\" and in 243, \"the ruler [\u738b \"king\"] of Wa again sent high officers as envoys with tribute\" (tr. Aston 1924:245-6). It is revealing that the ''Nihon Shoki'' editors chose to omit the ''Wei Zhi'' particulars about Himiko.\n\n{{nihongo|Yamato Totohi Momoso himemiko|\u502d\u8ff9\u8ff9\u65e5\u767e\u8972\u5a9b\u547d}}, the shaman aunt of Emperor Sujin, supposedly committed suicide after learning her husband was a [[trickster]] snake-god. The ''Kojiki'' does not mention her, but the ''Nihon Shoki'' describes her as \"the Emperor's aunt by the father's side, a shrewd and intelligent person, who could foresee the future\" (tr. Aston 1924:156). After a series of national calamities, the Emperor \"assembled the 80 myriads of Deities\" and inquired by [[divination]]. Yamato-totohi-momoso was inspired by \u014cmononushi-nushi (\"Great Deity of All Deities and Spirits\", tr. Hori 1968:193) to say.\n\"Why is the Emperor grieved at the disordered state of the country? If he duly did us reverent worship it would assuredly become pacified of itself.\" The Emperor inquired, saying: \"What God is it that thus instructs me?\" The answer was: \"I am the God who dwells within the borders of the land of Yamato, and my name is Oho-mono-nushi no Kami.\" (tr. Aston 1924:152) \nWhile imperial worship of this god (from [[Mount Miwa]]) was \"without effect\", Yamato-totohi-momoso later married him.\n<blockquote>After this Yamato-toto-hi-momo-so-bime no Mikoto became the wife of Oho-mono-nushi no Kami. This God, however, was never seen in the day-time, but at night. Yamato-toto-hi-momo-so-bime no Mikoto said to her husband: \"As my Lord is never seen in the day-time, I am unable to view his august countenance distinctly; I beseech him therefore to delay a while, that in the morning I may look upon the majesty of his beauty.\" The Great God answered and said: \"What thou sayest is clearly right. To-morrow morning I will enter thy toilet-case and stay there. I [[pray thee]] be not alarmed at my form.\" Yamato-toto-hi-momo-so-bime no Mikoto wondered secretly in her heart at this. Waiting until daybreak, she looked into her toilet-case. There was there a beautiful little snake, of the length and thickness of the cord of a garment. Thereupon she was frightened, and uttered an exclamation. The Great God was ashamed, and changing suddenly into human form, spake to his wife, and said: \"Thou didst not contain thyself, but hast caused me shame; I will in my turn put thee to shame.\" So treading the Great Void, he ascended to Mount Mimoro. Hereupon Yamato-toto-hi-momo-so-bime no Mikoto looked up and had remorse. She flopped down on a seat and with a chopstick stabbed herself in the pudenda so that she died. She was buried at Oho-chi. Therefore the men of that time called her tomb the Hashi no haka [Chopstick Tomb]. (tr. Aston 1924:158-9) </blockquote>\nThe {{nihongo|{{ill|Hashihaka|ja|\u7bb8\u5893\u53e4\u58b3}}|\u7bb8\u5893|\"Chopstick Tomb\"}} [[Kofun]] in [[Sakurai, Nara]] is associated with this legend.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{nihongo|[[Yamatohime-no-mikoto]]|\u502d\u59eb\u547d}}, the daughter of Emperor Suinin, supposedly founded the [[Ise Shrine]] to the sun-goddess [[Amaterasu]]. The ''Kojiki'' records her as the fourth of Suinin's five children, \"Her Augustness Yamato-hime, (was the high-priestess of the temple of the Great Deity of Ise)\" (tr. Chamberlain 1919:227). The ''Nihon Shoki'' likewise records \"Yamato-hime no Mikoto\" (tr. Aston 1924:150) and provides more details. The Emperor assigned Yamatohime to find a permanent location for Amaterasu's shrine, and after wandering for years, the sun-goddess instructed her to build it at [[Ise, Mie|Ise]] \"where she first descended from Heaven\" (tr. Aston 1924:176).\n\nEmpress Consort Jing\u016b (or Jing\u014d \u795e\u529f) supposedly served as [[regent]] after the death of her husband Emperor Ch\u016bai (c. 200) until the accession of her son [[Emperor \u014cjin]] (legendary 15th emperor, r. 270-310). The ''Kojiki'' (Chamberlain 1919:283-332) and ''Nihon Shoki'' (Aston 1924:217-271) have similar accounts. Emperor Ch\u016bai wanted to invade [[Kumaso]], and while he was consulting with his ministers, Jing\u016b conveyed a shamanistic message that he should invade [[Silla]] instead. Compare these.\n<blockquote>Her Augustness Princess Okinaga-tarashi, was at that time, divinely possessed \u2026 charged him with this instruction and counsel: \"There is a land to the Westward, and in that land is abundance of various treasures dazzling to the eye, from gold and silver downwards. I will now bestow this land upon thee.\" (tr. Chamberlain 1919:284-5). \n\nAt this time a certain God inspired the Empress and instructed her, saying: \"Why should the Emperor be troubled because the Kumaso do not yield submission? It is a land wanting in backbone. Is it worth while raising an army to attack it? There is a better land than this, a land of treasure, which may be compared to the aspect of a beautiful woman \u2013 the land of Mukatsu [Opposite; Across], dazzling to the eyes. In that land there are gold and silver and bright colours in plenty. It is called the Land of Silla of the coverlet of paper-mulberry. If thou worshippest me aright, the land will assuredly yield submission freely, and the edge of thy sword shall not be all stained with blood.\" (tr. Aston 1924:221). </blockquote>\n(The 2005:284 reprint of Chamberlain adds a footnote after \"possessed\": \"Himeko [sic] in the Chinese historical notices of Japan was skilled in magic, with which she deluded the people.\") The Emperor thought the gods were lying, said he had only seen ocean to the West, and then died, either immediately (''Kojiki'') or after invading Kumaso (''Nihon Shoki''). Jing\u016b allegedly discovered she was pregnant, personally planned and led a successful conquest of Silla, gave birth to the future emperor, and returned to rule Yamato. The ''Nihon Shoki'' (tr. Aston 1924:225) adds that since Jing\u016b wanted to learn which gods had cursed Ch\u016bai, she constructed a shamanic \"palace of worship\", \"discharged in person the office of priest\", and heard the gods reveal themselves as coming from Ise (Amaterasu) and Mukatsu (an unnamed Korean divinity). Although the ''Kojiki'' and ''Nihon Shoki'' myth-histories called Jing\u016b first of the [[Japanese empresses]], [[Meiji period]] historians removed her from the [[List of Emperors of Japan]], leaving [[Empress Suiko]] (r. 593-628) as the first historically verifiable female Japanese ruler.\n\n===Korean sources===\nThe oldest Korean history book, the 1145 ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' (\u4e09\u570b\u53f2\u8a18 \"Chronicles of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three [Korean] Kingdoms]]\") records that Queen Himiko sent an [[Diplomat|emissary]] to King [[Adalla of Silla]] in May 173 (Saeki 1988:35, 113, 154).\n\n==Interpretations==\nResearchers have struggled to reconcile Himiko/Pimiko between the Chinese and Japanese historical sources above. While the ''Wei Zhi'' described her as an important ruler in 3rd-century Japan, early Japanese historians purposely avoided naming Himiko, even when the ''Nihon Shoki'' quoted the ''Wei Zhi'' about envoys from Wa.\n\n===Name===\nThe three [[Chinese characters]] {{script|Hani|\u5351\u5f4c\u547c}} ([[shinjitai|simplified]]: {{script|Hani|\u5351\u5f25\u547c}}) transcribing the Wa regent's name are read {{transl|ja|himiko}} or {{transl|ja|hibiko}} in Modern [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and {{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|b\u0113im\u00edh\u016b}} or {{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|b\u00ecm\u00edh\u016b}} in [[Modern Standard Chinese]]. However, these contemporary readings differ considerably from how \"Himiko\" was pronounced in the 3rd century, both by speakers of the unknown Wa-language and by Chinese scribes who transcribed it. While [[transliteration into Chinese characters]] of foreign words is complex; the choice of these three particular characters is puzzling, with literal meanings [[Wikt:\u5351|\u5351]] \"low; inferior; humble\", [[Wikt:\u5f4c|\u5f4c]] ([[Wikt:\u5f25|\u5f25]]) \"fill, cover; full; whole, complete\", and [[Wikt:\u547c|\u547c]] \"breathe out; exhale; cry out; call\".{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn terms of [[historical Chinese phonology]], modern ''beimihu'' ({{lang|zh|\u5351\u5f4c\u547c}}) is simpler than its presumed 3rd-century late [[Old Chinese]] or early [[Middle Chinese]] pronunciation. Compare the following reconstructions of the name in \"[[Archaic Chinese|Archaic]]\" or \"[[Middle Chinese]]\" ([[Bernhard Karlgren]], [[Li Fanggui]], and William H. Baxter), \"[[Early Middle Chinese]]\" (Edwin G. Pulleyblank), and, historically closest, \"Late [[Han dynasty|Han]] Chinese\" (Axel Schuessler).\n*''pji\u1e19mji\u1e19\u03c7uo'' (Karlgren)\n*''pjiemjie\u03c7wo'' (Li)\n*''pjiumjieXxu'' (Baxter)\n*''pjimji\u03c7\u0254'' or ''pji\u0259\u030cmji\u0259\u030c\u03c7\u0254'' (Pulleyblank)\n*''piemieh\u0251'' (Schuessler)\nTo simplify without using special symbols, the first two syllables with ''p(j)-'' and ''m(j)-'' initial consonants share ''-i(e)'' final vowels, and the third has either a [[voiceless]] [[fricative]] ''X-'' or a [[voiced]] fricative ''h-'' plus a back [[mid vowel]] ''-u(o)''. Thus, \"Himiko\" could be hypothetically reconstructed as *''P(j)i(e)m(j)i(e)hu(o)''.\n\nIn terms of historical [[Japanese phonology]], the accepted modern reading of ''himiko'' would regularly correspond to [[Old Japanese]] ''*Fimeko''. However, [[Roy Andrew Miller]] says ''*Fimeko'' is a [[lexicographic error]] deriving from the ''Wei Zhi'' transcriptions.\n<blockquote> Most perplexing of the entire list is the name of the queen of the Yeh-ma-t'ai community, ''Pi-mi-hu'', Middle Chinese ''pji\u1e19-mji\u1e19-\u03c7uo''. This has traditionally been explained and understood in Japan as a transcription of a supposed Old Japanese form ''*Fimeko'', said to be an early term meaning \"high born woman; princess,\" and to derive from Old Japanese ''Fime'' [or ''Fi<sub>1</sub>me<sub>1</sub>''] (also sometimes ''Fim\u00eb'' [''Fi<sub>1</sub>me<sub>2</sub>'']), a laudatory title for women going with ''Fiko'' [''Fi<sub>1</sub>ko<sub>1</sub>''] for men. Later ''Fime'' comes to mean \"princess,\" but this meaning is anachronistic for the earlier texts. \u2026 The difficulty concerns the supposed Old Japanese word ''*Fimeko''. Even though such a form has found its way into a few modern Japanese dictionaries (for example even Kindaiichi's otherwise generally reliable ''Jikai''), it is in fact simply one of the ghost words of Japanese lexicography; when it does appear in modern lexical sources, it is a \"made-up\" form listed there solely on the basis of the ''Wei chih'' account of early Japan. There never was an Old Japanese ''*Fimeko''; furthermore, the Middle Chinese spirant ''\u03c7'' of the transcription suggests that the final element of the unknown original term did not correspond to Old Japanese ''-ko'' [''-ko<sub>1</sub>''], which is rendered elsewhere \u2013 in ''Fiko'' [''Fi<sub>1</sub>ko<sub>1</sub>''], for example \u2013 with Middle Chinese ''-k-'' as one would expect. The final element of this transcription, then, remains obscure, thought there is certainly a good chance that the first portion does correspond to a form related to Old Japanese ''Fime''. Beyond that, it is at present impossible to go. (1967:22) </blockquote>\n''Hime'' < Old Japanese ''Fi<sub>1</sub>me<sub>1</sub>'' ([[Wikt:\u59eb|\u59eb]] \"young noblewoman; princess\"), explains Miller, etymologically derives from ''hi'' < ''Fi<sub>1</sub>'' ([[Wikt:\u65e5|\u65e5]] \"sun\") and ''me'' < ''me<sub>1</sub>'' ([[Wikt:\u5973|\u5973]] \"woman\").\n\nTsunoda (1951:5) notes \"Pimiko is from an archaic Japanese title, ''himeko'', meaning 'princess',\" that is, ''hime'' with the female name suffix {{Nihongo||\u5b50|-ko|\"child\"}}, viz. the uncommon [[given name]] [[Himeko]]. Other Amaterasu-related etymological proposals for the [[Japanese name]] Himiko involve {{Nihongo||\u65e5|hi|\"sun\"}} and {{Nihongo||[[Wikt: \u89a1|\u89a1]]|[[miko]]| or {{lang|ja-Hani|\u5deb\u5973}} \"female shaman, shamaness; shrine maiden; priestess\"}}; or their combination ''hime-miko'' \"princess-priestess\".{{citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=Himemiko was a real title for princesses, as opposed to plain Miko for princes. In this case, Miko may simply mean \"noble person ('child')\" rather specifically \"priestess\".}}\n\nBentley (2008:18-20) considers the [[Baekje language|Paekche]] word *{{lang|pkc|pye}} 'west', the [[honorific]] prefix *{{lang|pkc|me}} and *{{lang|pkc|h\u0254}} 'heir' and thus interprets {{script|Hani|\u5351\u5f4c\u547c}} as 'the honorific heir of the west'.\n\nAlthough ''[[man'y\u014dgana]]'', Chinese characters used to spell out Japanese sounds, rose in prominence some time after the ''Wei Zhi'', it is notable that the ''man'y\u014dgana'' spelling {{script|Hani|\u5351\u5f4c\u547c}} could be hypothetically reconstructed as *''Pjimjiwo''.  This could be construed as undercutting Tsunoda's hypothesis, which requires final ''-ko'', and as possibly bolstering Bentley's argument.\n\n===Identity and historicity===\nIdentifying Himiko/Pimiko of Wa is straightforward within the [[history of China]], but problematic within the [[history of Japan]]. The 3rd-century Chinese ''Wei Zhi'' (\"[[Records of the Three Kingdoms|Records of Wei]]\") provides details about shaman Queen Himiko and her communications with Emperors [[Cao Rui]] and [[Cao Fang]]. The 8th-century Japanese ''Kojiki'' (\"Records of Ancient Matters\") and ''Nihon Shoki'' (\"Chronicles of Japan\", which quotes the ''Wei Zhi'') disregard Himiko, unless she was the [[subtext]] behind their accounts of [[Empress Jing\u016b]], [[Yamatohime-no-mikoto]], or [[:ja:\u502d\u8ff9\u8ff9\u65e5\u767e\u8972\u59eb\u547d|Yamatototohimomosohime-no-Mikoto]].\n\nNone of these three legendary Japanese royal shamans adequately corresponds with the Chinese chronology and description of Himiko. Assuming the ''Wei Zhi'' account that Himiko died around 248, if one accepts the dubious Japanese traditional dating, then she was closer to the 3rd-century AD Empress Jing\u016b than to the 1st-century BC Yamatohime-no-mikoto and Yamato-totohi-momoso-hime. On the other hand, if one accepts the postdating adjustments prior to the 4th century, then Himiko was closer to these Yamato-named shamans. Neither ''Kojiki'' nor ''Nihon Shoki'' mentions Himiko or any of the salient topics that she was unmarried, was chosen as ruler by the people, had a younger brother who helped rule (unless this refers to Jing\u016b's son), or had numerous (figuratively \"1000\") female attendants.\n\nWilliam Wayne {{Harvnb | Farris | 1998 | pp = 15\u201354}} reviews the history of scholarly debates over Himiko and her domain Yamatai. The [[Edo period|Edo-period]] philosophers [[Arai Hakuseki]] and [[Motoori Norinaga]] began the controversies over whether Yamatai was located in Kyushu or Yamato and whether the ''Wei Zhi'' or the ''Nihon Shoki'' was historically more trustworthy. The [[Confucianist]] Arai accepted the Chinese history as more reliable, and first equated Himiko with Jing\u016b and Yamatai with Yamato. The [[Kokugaku]] scholar Motoori accepted the traditional Japanese myth-history as more reliable, and dismissed its ''Wei Zhi'' quotations as later accretions. He hypothesized that a king from [[Kumaso]] sent emissaries who masqueraded as Jing\u016b's officials to the Wei court, thus leading Wei to mistake them for representatives of Himiko. {{Harvnb | Farris | 1998 | p = 16}} says, \"Motoori's usurpation hypothesis (''gisen setsu'') carried great weight for the next century.\"\n\nRather than Yamataikoku, Himiko may have been linked with [[Nakoku]], quoted as \"the Na state of Wa\" in Kyushu, for which was sent a golden royal seal, by [[Emperor Guangwu]] of the [[Han dynasty]]. Na is said to have existed from the 1st century to the early 3rd century, and seems to have been independent or even a rival of the Japanese Emperors in the Yamato province.\n\nAfter the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, Japanese historians adopted European historical scholarship, especially the source-based methodology of [[Leopold von Ranke]]. Naka Michiyo believed the ''Nihon Shoki'' chronology was inaccurate prior to the 4th century, and thus {{Harv | Farris | 1998 | p = 17}} \"Jing\u016b became a fourth-century queen whose reign could not possibly have coincided with Himiko's.\" The [[sinologist]] [[Shiratori Kurakichi]] proposed the ''Nihon Shoki'' compilers were tempted to associate Jing\u016b with the religious powers of Himiko. [[Nait\u014d Torajir\u014d]] argued that Himiko was the high priestess of the Ise shrine Yamatohime-no-mikoto and that Wa armies obtained control of southern Korea. \n{{Quote | One scholar [Higo Kazuo] asserted that Himiko was really Yamato-toto-momo-so-hime-no-mikoto, aunt of the legendary Emperor S\u016bjin on his father's side, because her supposed tomb at Hashihaka in Nara measured about a hundred paces in diameter, the measurement given for Himiko's grave. This theory gained adherents in the postwar period. Another [Shida Fudomaru] saw in Himiko an expression of women's political authority in early Japan. | {{Harvnb | Farris | 1998 | p = 20}}}}\n\nSome later Japanese historians reframed Himiko in terms of [[Marxist historiography]]. Masaaki Ueda argued that \"Himiko's was a [[despotic]] state with a generalized slave system\" {{Harv | Farris | 1998 | p = 21}}, while Mitsusada Inoue idealized Yamatai as a \"balance of small states\" with [[communal property]] and popular political expression. Following the late 1960s \"Yamatai boom\", when numerous Japanese historians, linguists, and archeologists published reevaluations of Himiko and Yamatai, the debate was joined by [[Japanese nationalists]], mystery writers, and amateur scholars.\n\nIn Japanese historical and archeological [[periodization]], the 2nd- and 3rd-century era of Queen Himiko was between late [[Yayoi period]] and early [[Kofun period]]. ''[[Kofun]]'' (\u53e4\u58b3 \"old tumulus\") refers to characteristic keyhole-shaped burial mounds, and the ''Wei Zhi'' noting \"a great mound was raised, more than a hundred paces in diameter\" for Pimiko's tomb, may well be the earliest written record of a ''kofun''. Several archeological excavations of Yayoi and Kofun sites in kinki region, have revealed Chinese-style bronze mirrors, called ''[[shinju-kyo]]'' (\u795e\u7363\u93e1 \"mirror decorated with gods and animals\"). Many scholars who support the Kinki theory associate these ''shinju-kyo'' with the \"one hundred bronze mirrors\" that the ''Wei Zhi'' {{Harv | Tsunoda | 1951 | p = 15}} records Emperor Cao Rui presented to Queen Himiko, while other scholars oppose it ({{Harvnb | Edwards | 1998}}, 1999). Hashihaka kofun in [[Sakurai, Nara]] was given a recent boost by radio-carbon dating circa 240\u201360 {{Harv | Japan Times | 2009}}.  The early Chinese records of Himiko/Pimiko and her Yamatai polity remain something of a [[Rorschach test]]. To different interpreters, this early Japanese shaman queen can appear as evidence of [[communalism]] (Marxists), [[J\u014dmon]] priestess rulers ([[Feminist history]]), Japanese conquest of Korea {{Harv | Akima | 1993}}, [[Mongolia]]n conquest of Japan (Namio Egami's \"[[:ja:\u9a0e\u99ac\u6c11\u65cf\u5f81\u670d\u738b\u671d\u8aac|horserider theory]]\"), the imperial system originating with tandem rule by a female shaman and male monarch {{Harv |Mori | 1979}}, the \"[[patriarchal]] revolution\" replacing female deities and priestesses with male counterparts {{Harv | Ellwood | 1990}}, or a shamanic advisor to the federation of Wa chieftains who \"must have looked like a ruling queen to Chinese envoys\" {{Harv | Matsumoto | 1983}}.\n\n=== Modern depictions ===\nDepictions of Himiko in Japanese popular media take one of three archetypes: Himiko as a wise, old ruler; Himiko the cute and spunky shaman; or Himiko as a seductive sorceress.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Diva Nation|last=Miller|first=Laura|publisher=University of California Press|year=2018|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=51\u201379|chapter=Searching for charisma Queen Himiko}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> She is associated with several ritual objects including the dotaku - two large bronze bells ritually used at the end of the Yayoi period - as well as the [[Cleyera japonica|sakaki]] branch and Chinese bronze mirrors. Wei zhi described Himiko's shamanism as ''guidao'', or Japanese ''kido'', a type of Daoist folk religion. As such, Himiko is sometimes negatively associated with black magic or demons. Ruling in the transitional period between the [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] and [[Kofun period|Kofun]] eras, depictions of Himiko often display her wearing clothing originating from a variety of time periods, often embodied masculine elements. A queen during the late Yayoi, Himiko likely wore a one-piece, wide-sleeved [[kosode]] under a vest and sash. She is also often depicted wearing [[magatama]] beads and a diadem. However, no one can be certain what Himiko wore.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHimiko also receives wicked interpretations, such as a sorceress or tyrant. Such depictions usually cast Himiko as a seductress in sexually revealing clothing, large breasts, and compromising positions, seeming to assert that Himiko's power arose from nefarious sexual appeal. One such depiction appears in the online role-playing game [[Atlantica Online]], in which Himiko appears a [[Steampunk fashion|steampunk]] mercenary in revealing costume. These depictions cater largely to the [[otaku]] fan base.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Manga and Graphic Novels ====\nHimiko has appeared as a subject in various manga issues. She has appeared on the cover of [[Kamui Fujiwara|Fujiwara Kamui's]] ''Himiko: Sh\u016bkan manga Nihonshi'' and on Gakken's manga ''Nihon no Rekishi'' by \u014cishi Manabu, Takano Kazuhiro, and Himekawa Akira.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Town mascots ====\nHimiko's legend has been used to market a variety of objects.<ref name=\":1\" /> Various small towns seek to use Himiko as their mascot, claiming their town as her birthplace, although the archaeological evidence supports regions in the Nara basin as her capital.

In the simplest system, all candidates must be rated.  The scores for each candidate are then summed, and the candidate with the highest sum is the winner.  (This is simpler for voters than [[cumulative voting]], where they are not permitted to provide scores for more than some number of candidates.)\n\nSome systems allow voters to explicitly ''abstain'' from rating certain candidates, as opposed to implicitly giving the lowest number of points to unrated candidates.  In this case, a candidate's score would be the ''average'' rating from voters who did rate this candidate.  However, some method must then be used to exclude candidates who received too few votes, to provide a meaningful average.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://rangevoting.org/BetterQuorum.html |title = Better \"Soft Quorum\" Rule |website = RangeVoting.org |access-date = 2016-12-11 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html |title = How Not To Sort By Average Rating |last =  |first =  |date =  |website = evanmiller.org |access-date = 2016-12-11 |quote = Average rating works fine if you always have a ton of ratings, but suppose item 1 has 2 positive ratings and 0 negative ratings. ... }}</ref>\n\nIn some competitions subject to judges' scores, a [[truncated mean]] is used to remove extreme scores.  For example, score voting with truncated means is used in figure skating competitions to avoid the results of the third skater affecting the relative positions of two skaters who have already finished their performances (the [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]]), using truncation to mitigate biases of some judges who have ulterior motives to score some competitors too high or low.\n\nAnother method of counting ratings ballots is to find the [[median]] score of each candidate, and elect a candidate with the highest median score. This method is also referred to as [[Majority Judgment]].<ref name=\"Balinski+Laraki\">{{cite journal |author = [[Michel Balinski]] and Rida Laraki |url = http://www.pnas.org/content/104/21/8720.full |title = A theory of measuring, electing, and ranking \u2014 PNAS |journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume = 104 |issue = 21 |pages = 8720\u20138725 |accessdate = 2009-08-03 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0702634104 |pmid = 17496140 |pmc = 1885569 |year = 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01965227 |journal=Revue Economique|title = The strange majority judgment |last=Laslier|first=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|year=2019|volume=70|number=4|pages=569\u2013588 |doi=10.3917/reco.pr2.0126}}</ref> It could have the effect of reducing the incentive to exaggerate.  A potential disadvantage is that multiway exact ties for winner may become common, although a method exists in Majority Judgment to break such ties.<ref name=\"Balinski+Laraki\" /> In conventional score voting, these ties would be extremely rare. Another consequence of using medians is that adding an \"all-zero ballot\"\ncan alter the election winner, which is arguably a disadvantage.\n[[File:STAR Voting sample ballot.png|alt=STAR Voting ballot with 6 generic candidate names, and 5 bubbles filled in, showing blank vote, tied vote, and scores that no candidate received|thumb|STAR Voting uses a standard Score Voting ballot. The counting method adds an extra step to yield the preference winner between the top two scoring candidates overall.]]\nAnother proposed variant is [[STAR voting]] (Score Then Automatic Runoff). Under this system, each voter may assign a score, from 0 to the maximum score, to any number of candidates. Of the two highest-scoring candidates, the winner is the one more voters assigned a higher score.<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://equal.vote |title = Equal Vote Coalition |access-date = 2017-04-05 }}</ref> The concept was first proposed publicly in October 2014 by [[The Center for Election Science|Center for Election Science]] co-founder Clay Shentrup.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://groups.google.com/d/msg/electionscience/JK82EFn7nrs/Lble3V2CW4UJ |title = Google Groups |website = groups.google.com |access-date = 2017-04-05 }}</ref> The runoff step was introduced in order to correct for strategic distortion in ordinary score voting,<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://ivn.us/2016/12/08/score-runoff-voting/ |title = Score Runoff Voting: The New Voting Method that Could Save Our Democratic Process |date = 2016-12-08 |website = IVN.us |access-date = 2017-04-05 }}</ref> such as [[Bullet voting]] and tactical maximization.<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://equal.vote/strategic_srv |title = Strategic SRV? - Equal Vote Coalition |work = Equal Vote Coalition |access-date = 2017-04-05 }}</ref>\n\nScore voting in which only two different votes may be submitted (0 and 1, for example) is equivalent to [[approval voting]]. As with approval voting, score voters must weigh the adverse impact on their favorite candidate of ranking other candidates highly.\n\nThe term \"range voting\" is used to describe a more theoretical system in which voters can express any [[real number]] within the [[range notation|range]] [0, 1].  While convenient for mathematical analysis, this scale is not practical for real-world elections, and is typically approximated as a score voting system with many possible grades, such as a [[Slider (computing)|slider]] in a computer interface.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|url=https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/653/|title=The Case for Utilitarian Voting|last=Hillinger|first=Claude|date=2005-05-01|journal=Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-05-15|quote=Specific UV rules that have been proposed are approval voting, allowing the scores 0, 1; range voting, allowing all numbers in an interval as scores; evaluative voting, allowing the scores -1, 0, 1.|doi=10.5282/ubm/epub.653}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://voteupapp.com/blog/expressive-voting|title=Should you be using a more expressive voting system?|last=|first=|date=|website=VoteUp app|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-05-15|quote=Score Voting -- it\u2019s just like range voting except the scores are discrete instead of spanning a continuous range.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rangevoting.org/PreEmProp.html|title=Good criteria support range voting|last=|first=|date=|website=RangeVoting.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-05-15|quote=Definition 1: For us \"Range voting\" shall mean the following voting method.

However, if voters from Knoxville and Chattanooga were to rate Nashville as 0 (so 2 for Memphis) and both sets of voters were to rate Chattanooga as 10, the winner would be Chattanooga over Nashville by 508 to 428 (and 484 for Memphis). This would be a better outcome for the voters in those cities than what they would get if they were to reflect their true preferences, and is considered to be an instance of tactical voting. Such tactical voting would be less effective if the ballots were counted using median scores (the principle behind [[Majority Judgment]]).\n\nFor comparison, note that traditional first-past-the-post would elect Memphis, even though most citizens consider it the worst choice, because 42% is larger than any other single city. [[Instant-runoff voting#Tennessee capital election|Instant-runoff voting]] would elect the 2nd-worst choice (Knoxville), because the central candidates would be eliminated early. In [[Approval voting]], with each voter selecting their top two cities, Nashville would win because of the significant boost from Memphis residents. A [[Two-round system#Example II|two-round system]] would have a runoff between Memphis and Nashville where Nashville would win.\n\n==Properties==\nScore voting allows voters to express preferences of varying strengths.\n\nScore voting satisfies the [[monotonicity criterion]], i.e. raising your vote's score for a candidate can never hurt their chances of winning, and lowering it can never help their chances.  Also, score voting satisfies the [[participation criterion]], i.e. casting a sincere vote can never result in a worse election winner (from your point of view) than if you had simply abstained from voting.\n\nScore voting is [[strategic nomination|independent of clones]] in the sense that if there is a set of candidates such that every voter gives the same rating to every candidate in this set, then the probability that the winner is in this set is independent of how many candidates are in the set.\n\nIn summary, score voting satisfies the [[monotonicity criterion]], the [[participation criterion]], the [[consistency criterion]], [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]], [[resolvability criterion]], and [[reversal symmetry]], provided voters do not have perfect information (see below; if they do have perfect information, it becomes a Condorcet method, which means it fails participation, consistency, and independence of irrelevant alternatives). It is immune to cloning, except for the obvious specific case in which a candidate with clones ties, instead of achieving a unique win.

In the simplest system, all candidates must be rated.  The scores for each candidate are then summed, and the candidate with the highest sum is the winner.  (This is simpler for voters than [[cumulative voting]], where they are not permitted to provide scores for more than some number of candidates.)\n\nSome systems allow voters to explicitly ''abstain'' from rating certain candidates, as opposed to implicitly giving the lowest number of points to unrated candidates.  In this case, a candidate's score would be the ''average'' rating from voters who did rate this candidate.

For example, score voting with truncated means is used in figure skating competitions to avoid the results of the third skater affecting the relative positions of two skaters who have already finished their performances (the [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]]), using truncation to mitigate biases of some judges who have ulterior motives to score some competitors too high or low.\n\nAnother method of counting ratings ballots is to find the [[median]] score of each candidate, and elect a candidate with the highest median score.

A potential disadvantage is that multiway exact ties for winner may become common, although a method exists in Majority Judgment to break such ties.<ref name=\"Balinski+Laraki\" /> In conventional score voting, these ties would be extremely rare. Another consequence of using medians is that adding an \"all-zero ballot\"\ncan alter the election winner, which is arguably a disadvantage.\n[[File:STAR Voting sample ballot.png|alt=STAR Voting ballot with 6 generic candidate names, and 5 bubbles filled in, showing blank vote, tied vote, and scores that no candidate received|thumb|STAR Voting uses a standard Score Voting ballot.

However, if voters from Knoxville and Chattanooga were to rate Nashville as 0 (so 2 for Memphis) and both sets of voters were to rate Chattanooga as 10, the winner would be Chattanooga over Nashville by 508 to 428 (and 484 for Memphis). This would be a better outcome for the voters in those cities than what they would get if they were to reflect their true preferences, and is considered to be an instance of tactical voting. Such tactical voting would be less effective if the ballots were counted using median scores (the principle behind [[Majority Judgment]]).\n\nFor comparison, note that traditional first-past-the-post would elect Memphis, even though most citizens consider it the worst choice, because 42% is larger than any other single city. [[Instant-runoff voting#Tennessee capital election|Instant-runoff voting]] would elect the 2nd-worst choice (Knoxville), because the central candidates would be eliminated early. In [[Approval voting]], with each voter selecting their top two cities, Nashville would win because of the significant boost from Memphis residents. A [[Two-round system#Example II|two-round system]] would have a runoff between Memphis and Nashville where Nashville would win.\n\n==Properties==\nScore voting allows voters to express preferences of varying strengths.\n\nScore voting satisfies the [[monotonicity criterion]], i.e. raising your vote's score for a candidate can never hurt their chances of winning, and lowering it can never help their chances.  Also, score voting satisfies the [[participation criterion]], i.e. casting a sincere vote can never result in a worse election winner (from your point of view) than if you had simply abstained from voting.\n\nScore voting is [[strategic nomination|independent of clones]] in the sense that if there is a set of candidates such that every voter gives the same rating to every candidate in this set, then the probability that the winner is in this set is independent of how many candidates are in the set.\n\nIn summary, score voting satisfies the [[monotonicity criterion]], the [[participation criterion]], the [[consistency criterion]], [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]], [[resolvability criterion]], and [[reversal symmetry]], provided voters do not have perfect information (see below; if they do have perfect information, it becomes a Condorcet method, which means it fails participation, consistency, and independence of irrelevant alternatives). It is immune to cloning, except for the obvious specific case in which a candidate with clones ties, instead of achieving a unique win. It does not satisfy either the [[Condorcet criterion]] (i.e., is not a [[Condorcet method]]) or the [[Condorcet loser criterion]], although with all-strategic voters and perfect information the Condorcet winner is a [[Nash equilibrium]].<ref>Laslier, J.-F.

To address this point, some proponents of score voting argue for the inclusion of an [[STAR voting|extra instant-runoff round]] in which a majority preference is established between the two top-rated candidates.<ref name=\"evc-srvintro\">{{cite web |title = Score Runoff Voting |url = http://www.equal.vote/ |website = Equal Vote Coalition |accessdate = 2016-12-04 }}</ref>\n\nAs it satisfies the criteria of a deterministic voting method, with non-imposition, non-dictatorship, monotonicity, and independence of irrelevant alternatives, it may appear that it violates [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]]. The reason that score voting is not a counter-example to Arrow's theorem is that it is a cardinal voting method, while the \"universality\" criterion of Arrow's theorem effectively restricts that result to ordinal voting methods.<ref>{{cite journal |doi = 10.1086/256963 |last = Arrow |first = Kenneth |authorlink = Kenneth Arrow |title = A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare |journal = [[The Journal of Political Economy]] |volume = 58 |issue = 4 |date = August 1950 |pages = 328\u2013346 |url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a06caa8e4ef47bb8587744ece84d78ff8dbeea16 }}</ref>\n\n==Strategy==\n{{See also|Tactical voting#Score voting}}\nIdeal score [[strategic voting|voting strategy]] for well-informed voters is identical to ideal [[approval voting]] strategy, and a voter would want to give their least and most favorite candidates a minimum and a maximum score, respectively.

This could lead to undemocratic results if different segments of the population used strategy at significantly different rates. (Note that traditional first-past-the-post voting forces all candidates except one to be ranked equally, so that all voters are compressing their preferences equally.)\n\nAddressing these criticisms, the [[The Equal Vote Coalition|Equal Vote Coalition]], a voting reform advocacy group, proposes a variant of score voting with an extra second round featuring the two top-rated candidates, in which the candidate with the majority of preference wins.

It features then-[[Boston Red Sox]] [[left fielder]] [[Manny Ramirez]] on its cover. The game features full [[Major League Baseball]], [[Minor League Baseball]], and [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] licenses. It holds the 98th spot on [[IGN]]'s reader's choice top 100 games ever as of 2006. As with previous versions of the game, the announcers are [[Duane Kuiper]] and [[Mike Krukow]], real-life announcers for the [[San Francisco Giants]].\n\nA [[PlayStation Portable]] version of the game, titled just '''''MVP Baseball''''', was later released in May 2005.\n\n==Gameplay==\nMVP Baseball 2005 includes all 30 official Major League Baseball teams, stadiums, and all 30 unique dynasties, as well as the more than 1,000 individual players that populate their respective teams. A notable exclusion is [[Barry Bonds]], who does not appear in the game due to his withdrawal from the MLBPA's licensing agreement. His \"replacement\" is a fictional player named Jon Dowd. Dowd bears no resemblance in appearance to Bonds, but his skills mimic those of Bonds. Like its predecessor ''[[MVP Baseball 2004]]'', this game does not include [[Kevin Millar]], who does not appear in the game because he is not a member of the MLBPA. His \"replacement\" is a fictional player named Anthony Friese. The game also includes authentic minor league teams and actual minor league players by including double-A and triple-A-level farm teams. 2005's installment includes ballclubs from the High Single-A ranks as well, giving each MLB team three levels of minor league farm clubs. 2 legends teams, 63 legendary players, 15 classic stadiums, 5 fantasy parks, and more than 100 retro uniforms round out the list of unlockable features. Rosters are current as of January 12, 2005, and the game included the then-new [[Washington Nationals]], along with their then temporary home, [[RFK Stadium]]. At the time, new rosters could be downloaded to the Xbox and PS2 versions by accessing their online play menus.<ref name=\"Xbox\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/games/mvp-baseball/xbox-713818 |title=MVP Baseball 2005 - Xbox |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMVP Baseball 2005 includes an exhibition mode, a manager's mode, two different franchise modes, a scenario editor, and a handful of baseball-themed practice games. The exhibition mode lets the player quickly set up a game against another team, and both pick a starting pitcher and adjust the lineup, if needed. The manager mode is simulated based on the choices the players make before the opening pitch. The player doesn't actually see the players swing or make plays. Instead, the player picks from a list of managerial choices, and the outcome of each play is printed onscreen in a running box score. The scenario editor lets players adjust 20 different variables\u2014such as the teams involved, inning, count, who's on base, and so on\u2014the players can set up every possible scenario that has ever occurred in baseball history.<ref name=\"Xbox\"/>\n\nA minor glitch in Kuiper's commentary is about switch-hitters who are currently batting, claiming the batter hits better from one side, but when looking at the batter's power and/or contact stats, they actually hit better from the other side. For example, although [[Lance Berkman]]'s power and contact stats are both higher batting left-handed in the game by default, Kuiper will claim that Berkman hits better batting right-handed. Another quirk is that he claims [[Hack Wilson]] set the MLB single-season runs scored record with 192 in 1930. However, he actually set the MLB single-season ''RBIs'' record with 191 in 1930. The single-A [[Wilmington Blue Rocks]]' uniforms are misspelled, with an extra L in \"Wilmington.\"\n\n==Franchise Modes==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nBoth the dynasty and owner's modes keep track of events and statistics. Injuries and suspensions occur throughout the season, requiring the players to adjust lineups accordingly. Other teams will offer trades, and some of the players' own players will ask to be traded. On the statistics side, the game keeps a running tally of the current and previous season statistics in 64 different categories, along with 120 years' worth of league leading stats.\n\n===Dynasty Mode===\nDynasty Mode lets gamers draft and manage a team for up to 120 full seasons, including spring training games. Responsibilities include setting lineups, making trades, and shuffling players up and down through the team's three minor league farm clubs. Team chemistry, rivalries, and player moods are also variables in the dynasty mode that can be strengthened or weakened by win/loss records, player salaries, playing time, and position in the batting order or pitching rotation. The players' moods can be monitored via face icons in each player's profile. If a player is unhappy or wants to be traded, the player may send a message in MVP Inbox asking the players if they could consider their desires. The game gives the player a changing series of 1 and 3-year goals to live up to. Meeting these goals boosts managerial rating and team chemistry. Failing to do so has the opposite effect. Games can be played in real time, or chunks of the season can be simulated in one fell swoop. The dynasty mode in ''MVP Baseball 2004'' had a bug that made it impossible for computer-generated players to evolve into A-list superstars unless the players actually played 95% of the team's games. That was fixed in the 2005 release. It's now possible to give players an added stats bonus by playing the batting and pitching minigames during spring training.\n\n===Owner Mode===\nThe other franchise-style mode is called Owner Mode, and much like the similar mode in [[EA]]'s Madden NFL games, it tacks ownership and financial responsibilities on to Dynasty Mode. Here the players can set ticket and concessions prices, hire staff, buy and sell new stadium shops, schedule promotional giveaways, and buy all sorts of stadium upgrades (such as scoreboards, additional seats, home run fireworks, and luxury boxes). The goal is to last for 30 years. There are a variety of player, team, and financial reports to look at that show team's progress on a daily and yearly basis. In Owner Mode, players may design a custom ballpark for their team. The ballpark editor lets the players pick from a set list of various locations, field shapes, and seat colors, as well as specific wall, grass, and dirt designs. It also lets players add on additional seating levels and grandstands throughout the course of the career.\n\n===Features===\nThe most prominent new feature in the game is the \"Hitter's Eye\" system, which turns the baseball different colors in the pitcher's hand (stays white for fastballs, red for breaking pitches, green for off-speed pitches, pink for sinkers and orange for knuckleballs) and leaves a trail as the ball flies through the air toward the plate to aid in hitting, which game developers said had been too difficult in previous versions. In addition to the Hitter's Eye, an Owner Mode feature and pitching and hitting Mini-Games were added.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/games/mvp-baseball/pc-713819 |title=MVP Baseball 2005 - PC |publisher=IGN |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}</ref> Other minor features include the ability for the managers to argue with the umpires at any time (automatic ejection for arguing balls and strikes) and a slow motion overhead view of the plate that can be accessed after every pitch (pitch/swing analysis) to see pitch location or the batter's timing. Games can also be rained out, forcing a player to play a doubleheader. Minor league teams from the California, Carolina, and Florida State Leagues (High A) were added to their respective teams, although most Minor League rosters are incomplete and feature developer-created replacement players. The game also supported online play, but as of 2008 the servers for the Xbox and PS2 versions are unavailable.\n\n===Soundtrack===\nThe soundtrack for ''MVP Baseball 2005'' includes nine songs all by different artists. The game was the first release for four of these songs, from artists [[...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead]], [[The Bravery]], [[Hot Hot Heat]] and [[Louis XIV (band)|Louis XIV]]. The soundtrack is widely held as one of the best in-game soundtracks of the 2000s.\n\n==Reception==\nBy July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of ''MVP Baseball 2005'' had sold 1 million copies and earned $29 million in the United States. ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' ranked it as the 55th highest-selling game launched for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] or [[GameCube]] between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined console sales of ''MVP Baseball'' games released in the 2000s reached 3.5 million units in the United States by July 2006.<ref name=nextgensales2>{{cite

It features then-[[Boston Red Sox]] [[left fielder]] [[Manny Ramirez]] on its cover. The game features full [[Major League Baseball]], [[Minor League Baseball]], and [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] licenses. It holds the 98th spot on [[IGN]]'s reader's choice top 100 games ever as of 2006. As with previous versions of the game, the announcers are [[Duane Kuiper]] and [[Mike Krukow]], real-life announcers for the [[San Francisco Giants]].\n\nA [[PlayStation Portable]] version of the game, titled just '''''MVP Baseball''''', was later released in May 2005.\n\n==Gameplay==\nMVP Baseball 2005 includes all 30 official Major League Baseball teams, stadiums, and all 30 unique dynasties, as well as the more than 1,000 individual players that populate their respective teams. A notable exclusion is [[Barry Bonds]], who does not appear in the game due to his withdrawal from the MLBPA's licensing agreement. His \"replacement\" is a fictional player named Jon Dowd. Dowd bears no resemblance in appearance to Bonds, but his skills mimic those of Bonds. Like its predecessor ''[[MVP Baseball 2004]]'', this game does not include [[Kevin Millar]], who does not appear in the game because he is not a member of the MLBPA. His \"replacement\" is a fictional player named Anthony Friese. The game also includes authentic minor league teams and actual minor league players by including double-A and triple-A-level farm teams. 2005's installment includes ballclubs from the High Single-A ranks as well, giving each MLB team three levels of minor league farm clubs. 2 legends teams, 63 legendary players, 15 classic stadiums, 5 fantasy parks, and more than 100 retro uniforms round out the list of unlockable features. Rosters are current as of January 12, 2005, and the game included the then-new [[Washington Nationals]], along with their then temporary home, [[RFK Stadium]]. At the time, new rosters could be downloaded to the Xbox and PS2 versions by accessing their online play menus.<ref name=\"Xbox\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/games/mvp-baseball/xbox-713818 |title=MVP Baseball 2005 - Xbox |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMVP Baseball 2005 includes an exhibition mode, a manager's mode, two different franchise modes, a scenario editor, and a handful of baseball-themed practice games. The exhibition mode lets the player quickly set up a game against another team, and both pick a starting pitcher and adjust the lineup, if needed. The manager mode is simulated based on the choices the players make before the opening pitch. The player doesn't actually see the players swing or make plays. Instead, the player picks from a list of managerial choices, and the outcome of each play is printed onscreen in a running box score. The scenario editor lets players adjust 20 different variables\u2014such as the teams involved, inning, count, who's on base, and so on\u2014the players can set up every possible scenario that has ever occurred in baseball history.<ref name=\"Xbox\"/>\n\nA minor glitch in Kuiper's commentary is about switch-hitters who are currently batting, claiming the batter hits better from one side, but when looking at the batter's power and/or contact stats, they actually hit better from the other side. For example, although [[Lance Berkman]]'s power and contact stats are both higher batting left-handed in the game by default, Kuiper will claim that Berkman hits better batting right-handed. Another quirk is that he claims [[Hack Wilson]] set the MLB single-season runs scored record with 192 in 1930. However, he actually set the MLB single-season ''RBIs'' record with 191 in 1930. The single-A [[Wilmington Blue Rocks]]' uniforms are misspelled, with an extra L in \"Wilmington.\"\n\n==Franchise Modes==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nBoth the dynasty and owner's modes keep track of events and statistics. Injuries and suspensions occur throughout the season, requiring the players to adjust lineups accordingly. Other teams will offer trades, and some of the players' own players will ask to be traded. On the statistics side, the game keeps a running tally of the current and previous season statistics in 64 different categories, along with 120 years' worth of league leading stats.\n\n===Dynasty Mode===\nDynasty Mode lets gamers draft and manage a team for up to 120 full seasons, including spring training games. Responsibilities include setting lineups, making trades, and shuffling players up and down through the team's three minor league farm clubs. Team chemistry, rivalries, and player moods are also variables in the dynasty mode that can be strengthened or weakened by win/loss records, player salaries, playing time, and position in the batting order or pitching rotation. The players' moods can be monitored via face icons in each player's profile. If a player is unhappy or wants to be traded, the player may send a message in MVP Inbox asking the players if they could consider their desires. The game gives the player a changing series of 1 and 3-year goals to live up to. Meeting these goals boosts managerial rating and team chemistry. Failing to do so has the opposite effect. Games can be played in real time, or chunks of the season can be simulated in one fell swoop. The dynasty mode in ''MVP Baseball 2004'' had a bug that made it impossible for computer-generated players to evolve into A-list superstars unless the players actually played 95% of the team's games. That was fixed in the 2005 release. It's now possible to give players an added stats bonus by playing the batting and pitching minigames during spring training.\n\n===Owner Mode===\nThe other franchise-style mode is called Owner Mode, and much like the similar mode in [[EA]]'s Madden NFL games, it tacks ownership and financial responsibilities on to Dynasty Mode. Here the players can set ticket and concessions prices, hire staff, buy and sell new stadium shops, schedule promotional giveaways, and buy all sorts of stadium upgrades (such as scoreboards, additional seats, home run fireworks, and luxury boxes). The goal is to last for 30 years. There are a variety of player, team, and financial reports to look at that show team's progress on a daily and yearly basis. In Owner Mode, players may design a custom ballpark for their team. The ballpark editor lets the players pick from a set list of various locations, field shapes, and seat colors, as well as specific wall, grass, and dirt designs. It also lets players add on additional seating levels and grandstands throughout the course of the career.\n\n===Features===\nThe most prominent new feature in the game is the \"Hitter's Eye\" system, which turns the baseball different colors in the pitcher's hand (stays white for fastballs, red for breaking pitches, green for off-speed pitches, pink for sinkers and orange for knuckleballs) and leaves a trail as the ball flies through the air toward the plate to aid in hitting, which game developers said had been too difficult in previous versions. In addition to the Hitter's Eye, an Owner Mode feature and pitching and hitting Mini-Games were added.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/games/mvp-baseball/pc-713819 |title=MVP Baseball 2005 - PC |publisher=IGN |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}</ref> Other minor features include the ability for the managers to argue with the umpires at any time (automatic ejection for arguing balls and strikes) and a slow motion overhead view of the plate that can be accessed after every pitch (pitch/swing analysis) to see pitch location or the batter's timing. Games can also be rained out, forcing a player to play a doubleheader. Minor league teams from the California, Carolina, and Florida State Leagues (High A) were added to their respective teams, although most Minor League rosters are incomplete and feature developer-created replacement players. The game also supported online play, but as of 2008 the servers for the Xbox and PS2 versions are unavailable.\n\n===Soundtrack===\nThe soundtrack for ''MVP Baseball 2005'' includes nine songs all by different artists. The game was the first release for four of these songs, from artists [[...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead]], [[The Bravery]], [[Hot Hot Heat]] and [[Louis XIV (band)|Louis XIV]]. The soundtrack is widely held as one of the best in-game soundtracks of the 2000s.\n\n==Reception==\nBy July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of ''MVP Baseball 2005'' had sold 1 million copies and earned $29 million in the United States. ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' ranked it as the 55th highest-selling game launched for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] or [[GameCube]] between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined console sales of ''MVP Baseball'' games released in the 2000s reached 3.5 million units in the United States by July 2006.<ref name=nextgensales2>{{cite

His father, Singamuthu ([[Manivannan]]), had gone to [[Kadapa]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]] to work at a [[colliery]] and never returned, prompting Velu and his family to think that he is dead. Velu comes to know that a [[Malaysia]]-based [[crime boss|don]] named Koccha ([[Suman (actor)|Suman]]) owed his father a huge sum of money. Velu and his friend Ops ([[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]]) travel to Malaysia as ''Kuruvi'', the trade jargon for low-level contraband carriers. They come to Malaysia at a time when internal rivalry and problems are surfacing in Koccha's family. Koccha's younger sister Radhadevi alias Devi ([[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]]) has refused to marry Soori ([[Pawan (actor)|Pawan]]), the brother of Konda Reddy ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]), Koccha's Kadapa-based business associate. Irritated and preoccupied, neither Koccha nor his henchmen want to devote any time or attention to resolve Velu's problem. Velu is ill-treated and thrown out of Koccha's place without any help rendered. Determined to return to India only after his father's issue is solved to his satisfaction, Velu conceals himself in Koccha's palace-like residence. He soon finds out about a large diamond owned by Koccha and steals it, feeling that it would pay off his father's debt, and returns to India with Ops. Devi also follows Velu to India, having fallen in love with him, when he saves her from falling from a tall building during New Year's Eve.\n\nKnowing that Velu has stolen his diamond, Koccha and his gang visit Velu's house and threaten his family with dire consequences unless Velu returns the diamond. After confronting Koccha, Velu comes to know that his father isn't dead, but is being held as bonded labour along with many innocent people at Kadapa. Singamuthu had discovered diamonds at the colliery, but refused to allow Koccha and Konda Reddy to illegally mine the diamonds for their own benefit. He had been held prisoner in Kadapa since.\n\nVelu immediately leaves for Kadapa, where he encounters Koccha again. He throws him onto a moving train, paralysing him. He soon discovers a slave camp run by Koccha and Konda Reddy ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]) at the colliery, where a [[Male promiscuity|womanising]] rowdy named Kadapa Raja ([[G. V. Sudhakar Naidu]]) is torturing the inmates, including Singamuthu. He single-handedly takes on Konda Reddy, Kadapa Raja and their henchmen, killing them all. He drags Konda Reddy's dead body to Koccha's mansion. Koccha, who now uses a wheelchair, recovers on seeing the dead body of his associate and attempts to shoot Velu. He is arrested at that moment by a special task force led by Raj ([[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]]). Singamuthu and the others who were imprisoned in the slave camp are finally freed and reunited with their families. Finally, Velu unites with Devi.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] as Velu / Vetrivel (Kuruvi)\n* [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]] as Devi / Radhadevi\n* [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] as Ops, (Velu's Friend)\n* [[Suman (actor)|Suman]] as Kocha, (Kadappa Diamond Kuvari Illegal Business Owner, Enemy role, Devi's Brother)\n* [[Ashish Vidyarthi]] as Konda Reddy, (Kocha's Diamond quarry Illegal Business Partner, Enemy role) \n* [[Manivannan]] as Singamuthu, (Kocha's Diamond quarry Workers, Velu father's)\n* [[Saranya Ponvannan]] as (Kocha's wife & Devi's sister-in-law)\n* [[T.

His father, Singamuthu ([[Manivannan]]), had gone to [[Kadapa]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]] to work at a [[colliery]] and never returned, prompting Velu and his family to think that he is dead. Velu comes to know that a [[Malaysia]]-based [[crime boss|don]] named Koccha ([[Suman (actor)|Suman]]) owed his father a huge sum of money. Velu and his friend Ops ([[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]]) travel to Malaysia as ''Kuruvi'', the trade jargon for low-level contraband carriers. They come to Malaysia at a time when internal rivalry and problems are surfacing in Koccha's family. Koccha's younger sister Radhadevi alias Devi ([[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]]) has refused to marry Soori ([[Pawan (actor)|Pawan]]), the brother of Konda Reddy ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]), Koccha's Kadapa-based business associate. Irritated and preoccupied, neither Koccha nor his henchmen want to devote any time or attention to resolve Velu's problem. Velu is ill-treated and thrown out of Koccha's place without any help rendered. Determined to return to India only after his father's issue is solved to his satisfaction, Velu conceals himself in Koccha's palace-like residence. He soon finds out about a large diamond owned by Koccha and steals it, feeling that it would pay off his father's debt, and returns to India with Ops. Devi also follows Velu to India, having fallen in love with him, when he saves her from falling from a tall building during New Year's Eve.\n\nKnowing that Velu has stolen his diamond, Koccha and his gang visit Velu's house and threaten his family with dire consequences unless Velu returns the diamond. After confronting Koccha, Velu comes to know that his father isn't dead, but is being held as bonded labour along with many innocent people at Kadapa. Singamuthu had discovered diamonds at the colliery, but refused to allow Koccha and Konda Reddy to illegally mine the diamonds for their own benefit. He had been held prisoner in Kadapa since.\n\nVelu immediately leaves for Kadapa, where he encounters Koccha again. He throws him onto a moving train, paralysing him. He soon discovers a slave camp run by Koccha and Konda Reddy ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]) at the colliery, where a [[Male promiscuity|womanising]] rowdy named Kadapa Raja ([[G. V. Sudhakar Naidu]]) is torturing the inmates, including Singamuthu. He single-handedly takes on Konda Reddy, Kadapa Raja and their henchmen, killing them all. He drags Konda Reddy's dead body to Koccha's mansion. Koccha, who now uses a wheelchair, recovers on seeing the dead body of his associate and attempts to shoot Velu. He is arrested at that moment by a special task force led by Raj ([[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]]). Singamuthu and the others who were imprisoned in the slave camp are finally freed and reunited with their families. Finally, Velu unites with Devi.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] as Velu / Vetrivel (Kuruvi)\n* [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]] as Devi / Radhadevi\n* [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] as Ops, (Velu's Friend)\n* [[Suman (actor)|Suman]] as Kocha, (Kadappa Diamond Kuvari Illegal Business Owner, Enemy role, Devi's Brother)\n* [[Ashish Vidyarthi]] as Konda Reddy, (Kocha's Diamond quarry Illegal Business Partner, Enemy role) \n* [[Manivannan]] as Singamuthu, (Kocha's Diamond quarry Workers, Velu father's)\n* [[Saranya Ponvannan]] as (Kocha's wife & Devi's sister-in-law)\n* [[T.

{"title_page": "Heliciculture", "text_new": "[[File:Eyragues-l-Escargot-des-Alpilles-5738.jpg|thumb|A snail farm near [[Eyragues]], [[Provence]], [[France]]]]\n'''Heliciculture''', commonly known as '''snail farming''', is the process of raising edible [[land snail]]s, primarily for human consumption or cosmetic use. The meat and  [[Snail caviar|snail eggs]] can be consumed as [[escargot]] and as a type of caviar respectively. Mucus, commonly known as [[snail slime]], has medical properties and is used in [[cosmetics]].\n\nPerhaps the best known edible land snail species in the [[Western world]] is the [[Helix pomatia]], commonly known as [[Roman snail]] or [[Burgundy snail]]. This species is however not fit for profitable snail farming, and normally harvested from nature.\n\nCommercial snail farming in the Western world is typically done with either the ''[[Cornu aspersum]],'' formerly known as Helix ''aspersa'' M\u00fcller'','' or the [[Helix aspersa Maxima|Helix ''aspersa'' Maxima]]. In tropical climates snail farming is typically done with the ''[[African snail]],'' which biologically does not fall in the family of [[Helicidae]], and the meat of which therefore may not be called escargot.\n\n== History ==\nRoasted snail shells have been found in [[archaeological]] excavations, an indication that snails have been eaten since prehistoric times.<ref>[http://watarts.uwaterloo.ca/~dlubell/Antibes.pdf Prehistoric edible land snails in the circum-Mediterranean: the archaeological evidence.], D.

Budja (ed.), ''Neolithic Studies 11. Documenta Praehistorica XXXI'': 1-24. D. Lubell.</ref>\n\n''Lumaca romana'', (translation: Roman snail), was an ancient method of snail farming or heliciculture in the region about [[Tarquinia]]. This snail farming method was described by [[:la:Quintus Fulvius Lippinus|Fulvius Lippinus]] (49 BC) and mentioned by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in ''De Re rustica'' III, 12.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Varro/de_Re_Rustica/3*.html#12 De Re Rustica III, 12]</ref> The snails were fattened for human consumption using [[spelt]] and aromatic herbs. People usually raised snails in pens near the house, and these pens were called \"[[:la:Cochlea (animal)|cochlea]].\"\n\nThe Romans, in particular, are known to have considered escargot as an elite food, as noted in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. The Romans selected the best snails for breeding. Shells of the edible land snail species ''[[Otala lactea]]'' have been recovered in [[archaeological]] excavations of [[Volubilis]] in present-day [[Morocco]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan, ''Volubilis'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham (2007) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906]</ref>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described the snail garden of [[Fulvius Hirpinus]] 2,000 years ago as having separate sections for different species of snails. [[Hirpinus]] allegedly fed his snails on meal and wine.\n\n\"Wall fish\" were also often eaten in Britain, but were never as popular as on the continent. There, people often ate snails during [[Lent]], and in a few places, they consumed large quantities of snails at Mardi Gras or Carnival, as a foretaste of Lent.\n\nAccording to some sources, the French exported [[Helix aspersa|brown garden snails]] to California in the 1850s, raising them as the delicacy [[escargot]]. Other sources claim that Italian immigrants were the first to bring the snail to the United States.\n\n== Economic impact ==\nU.S. imports of snails were worth more than $4.5 million in 1995 and came from 24 countries. This includes preserved or prepared snails and snails that are live, fresh, chilled, or frozen. Major exporters to the U.S. are [[France]], [[Indonesia]], [[Greece]] and [[China]]. The U.S. exported live, fresh, chilled, or frozen snails worth $55,000 to 13 countries; most were shipped to [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Individual statistics are not available for U.S. exports of prepared or processed snails from the U.S. [[Department of Commerce]].\n\n== Edible land snail species ==\n[[File:Snails-Italy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Three different species of snails for sale in a market in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]]]\nEdible land snails range in size from about one millimeter long to the giant African snails, which occasionally grow up to {{convert|312|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} in length. \"Escargot\" most commonly refers to either ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' or to ''[[Helix pomatia]]'', although other varieties of snails are eaten. ''[[Achatina fulica]]'', a giant African snail, is sliced and [[Canning|canned]] and passed off on some consumers as escargot. Terms such as \"garden snail\" or \"common brown garden snail\" are rather meaningless since they refer to so many types of snails, but they sometimes mean ''H. aspersa''.\n* ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' is also known as the French \"petit gris,\" \"small grey snail,\" the \"escargot chagrine,\" or \"la zigrinata.\" The shell of a mature adult has four to five whorls and measures 30 to 45&nbsp;mm across. It is native to the shores of the Mediterranean and up the coast of Spain and France. It is found on many British Isles, where the Romans introduced it in the 1st century AD (Some references say it dates to the Early Bronze Age.) In the early 19th century the French brought it into California, where it has become a serious pest. These snails are now common throughout the U.S. It was introduced into several Eastern and Gulf states even before 1850 and, later introduced into other countries such as Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico, and Argentina. ''C. aspersum'' has a life span of 2 to 5 years. This species is more adaptable to different climates and conditions than many snails, and is found in woods, fields, sand dunes, and gardens. This adaptability not only increases ''C. aspersum's'' range, but it also makes farming ''C. aspersum'' easier and less risky.\n* ''[[Helix pomatia]]'' measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It also is called the \"Roman snail,\" \"apple snail,\" \"lunar,\" \"la vignaiola,\" the German \"Weinbergschnecke,\" the French \"escargot de Bourgogne\" or \"Burgundy snail,\" or \"gros blanc.\" Native over a large part of Europe, it lives in wooded mountains and valleys up to {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} altitude and in vineyards and gardens. The Romans may have introduced it into Britain. Immigrants introduced it into the U.S. in Michigan and Wisconsin. Many prefer ''H. pomatia'' to ''H. aspersa'' for its flavor and its larger size, as the \"escargot par excellence.\"\n* ''[[Otala lactea]]'' is sometimes called the \"vineyard snail,\" \"milk snail,\" or \"Spanish snail.\" The shell is white with reddish brown spiral bands and measures about 26 to 35&nbsp;mm in diameter.\n* ''[[Iberus alonensis]]'', the Spanish \"vaqueta\" or \"serrana,\" measures about 30&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n[[File:Cepaea nemoralis pair banded shells.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'']]\n* ''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'', the \"grove snail,\" or the Spanish \"vaqueta,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm across the shell. It inhabits Central Europe and was introduced into, and is now naturalized in many U.S. states, from Massachusetts to California, and from Tennessee to Canada. Its habitat ranges widely from woods to dunes. It mainly eats dead plant material, but it likes nettles and buttercups and will eat dead worms and dead snails.\n* ''[[Cepaea hortensis]]'', the \"white-lipped snail,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm across the shell which often has distinct dark stripes. It is native to central and northern Europe. This species was introduced into Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire in colonial times, but it never became established in these states. Its habitat varies but ''C. hortensis'' is found in colder and wetter places than ''C. nemoralis''. Their smaller size and some people's opinion that they do not taste as good make ''C. hortensis'' and ''C. nemoralis'' less popular than the larger European land snails.\n* ''[[Otala punctata]]'', called \"vaqueta\" in some parts of Spain, measures about 35&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n* ''[[Eobania vermiculata]]'', the \"vinyala,\" \"mongeta,\" or \"xona,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm. It is found in Mediterranean countries and was introduced into Louisiana and Texas.\n* ''[[Helix lucorum]]'', sometimes called \"escargo turc,\" measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It is found in central Italy and from Yugoslavia through the Crimea to Turkey and around the Black Sea.\n* ''[[Helix adanensis]]'' comes from around Turkey.\n* ''[[Helix aperta]]'' measures about 25&nbsp;mm. Its meat is highly prized. It is native to France, Italy, and other Mediterranean countries and has become established in California and Louisiana. Sometimes known as the \"burrowing snail,\" it is found above ground only during rainy weather. In hot, dry weather, it burrows three to six inches into the ground and becomes dormant until rain soften the soil.\n* ''[[Theba pisana]]'', also called the \"banded snail\"or the \"cargol avellanenc,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm and lives on dry, exposed sites, usually near the sea. Native to Sicily, it has been spread to several European countries, including England. This snail is a serious garden pest and is the \"white snail\" that California once eradicated by using flamethrowers to burn off whole areas. In large numbers, up to 3,000 snails per tree, it can ravage a garden in 24 hours and a citrus or other crop in a couple of nights.\n* ''[[Sphincterochila candidissima]]'' or ''[[Leucochroa candidisima]]'', the \"cargol mongeta,\" or \"cargol jueu\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm.\n[[File:Achatina fulica Thailand.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''[[Achatina fulica]]'']]\n* ''[[Achatina fulica]]'' and other ''Achatina'' species, giant African snails. They can grow up to 326&nbsp;mm (1&nbsp;ft \u00be in) in length. Their native range is south of the Sahara in East Africa. This snail was purposely introduced into India in 1847. There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other Pacific locations and was inadvertently released in California after World War II, in Hawaii, and later in North Miami Florida in the 1970s. In many places, it is a serious agricultural pest that causes considerable crop damage. Also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odor that occurs when something like poison bait causes large numbers to die. The U.S. has made considerable effort to eradicate ''Achatina''. The [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has banned the importation and possession of live Giant African snails.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/29/illegal-giant-snails-threatening-america/|title=Illegal giant snails threatening America|date=2014-08-29|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}</ref> However, they are still sought after as pets due to the vibrant \"tiger stripes\" on their shells.\n\n== Biology ==\n\n=== Mating and egg laying ===\n\n==== General ====\nSnails are [[hermaphrodite]]s. Although they have both male and female [[reproductive organ]]s, they must mate with another snail of the same species before they lay eggs. Some snails may act as males one season and as females the next. Other snails play both roles at once and [[fertilize]] each other simultaneously. When the snail is large enough and mature enough, which may take several years, mating occurs in the late spring or early summer after several hours of [[courtship]]. Sometimes there is a second mating in summer. (In tropical climates, mating may occur several times a year. In some climates, snails mate around October and may mate a second time 2 weeks later.) After mating, the snail can store sperm received for up to a year, but it usually lays eggs within a few weeks. Snails are sometimes uninterested in mating with another snail of the same species that originated from a considerable distance away. For example, a ''H. aspersa'' from southern France may reject a ''H. aspersa'' from northern France.\n\n==== Helix ''pomatia''====\nSnails need soil at least 2&nbsp;inches deep in which to lay their eggs. For ''H. pomatia'', the soil should be at least 3&nbsp;inches deep to keep out pests such as [[ants]], [[earwig]]s, [[millipede]]s, etc. Dry soil is not suitable for the preparation of a nest, nor is soil that is too heavy. In clay soil that becomes hard, reproduction rates may decrease because the snails are unable to bury their eggs and the hatchlings have difficulty emerging from the nest. Hatchability of eggs depends on soil temperature, soil humidity, soil composition, etc. Soil consisting of 20% to 40% organic material is good. The soil should be kept at {{convert|41|to|50|F|C}}, and is best around {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Soil moisture should be maintained at 80%. One researcher removes eggs immediately after they are deposited, counts them, then keeps them on moist cotton until the eggs hatch and the young start to eat. Snails lose substantial weight by laying eggs. Some do not recover. About one-third of the snails will die after the breeding season.\n\n''H. pomatia'' eggs measure about 3&nbsp;mm in diameter and have a [[calcareous]] shell and a high [[yolk]] content. ''H. pomatia'' lays the eggs in July or August, 2 to 8 weeks after mating, in holes dug out in the ground. (Data varies widely on how long after mating snails lay eggs.) The snail puts its head into the hole or may crawl in until only the top of the shell is visible; then it deposits eggs from the genital opening just behind the head. It takes the snail 1 to 2 days to lay 30 to 50 eggs. Occasionally, the snail will lay about a dozen more a few weeks later. The snail covers the hole with a mixture of the slime it excretes and dirt. This slime, which the snail excretes to help it crawl and to help preserve the moisture in its soft body, is [[glycoprotein]] similar to eggwhite.\n\nFully developed baby ''H. pomatia'' snails hatch about 3 to 4 weeks after the eggs are laid, depending on temperature and humidity. Birds, insects, mice, toads and other predators take a heavy toll on the young snails. The snails eat and grow until the weather turns cold. They then dig a deep hole, sometimes as deep as {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=on}}, and seal themselves inside their shell and hibernate for the winter. This is a response to both decreasing temperature and shorter hours of daylight. When the ground warms up in spring, the snail emerges and goes on a binge of replacing lost moisture and eating.\n\n==== Helix ''aspersa''====\n''H. aspersa'' eggs are white, spherical, about {{cvt|3|mm|in|frac=8}} in diameter and are laid 5 days to 3 weeks after mating. (Data varies widely due to differences in climate and regional variations in the snails' habitats.) ''H. aspersa'' lays an average of 85 eggs in a nest that is {{convert|1|to|1+1/2|in|cm}} deep. Data varies from 30 to over 120 eggs, but high figures may be from when more than one snail lays eggs in the same nest.\n\nIn warm, damp climates, ''H. aspersa'' may lay eggs as often as five times from February through October, depending on the weather and region. Mating and egg-laying begin when there are at least 10 hours of daylight and continue until days begin to get shorter. In the United States, longer hours of sunlight that occur when temperatures are still too cold will affect this schedule, but increasing hours of daylight still stimulate egg laying. If warm enough, the eggs hatch in about 2 weeks, or in 4 weeks if cooler. It takes the baby snails several more days to break out of the sealed nest and climb to the surface. In a climate similar to southern California's, ''H. aspersa'' matures in about 2 years. In central Italy, ''H. aspersa'' hatches and emerges from the soil almost exclusively in the autumn. If well fed and not overcrowded, those snails that hatch at the start of the season will reach adult size and form a lip at the edge of their shell by the following June. If the environment is manipulated to get more early [[hatchlings]], the size and number of snails that mature the following year will increase. In South Africa, some ''H. aspersa'' mature in 10 months, and under ideal conditions in a laboratory, some have matured in 6 to 8 months. Most of ''H. aspersa's'' reproductive activity takes place in the second year of its life.\n\n===='''Achatina''' ''fulica''====\nBy contrast, one giant African snail, ''Achatina fulica'', lays 100 to 400 [[elliptical]] eggs that each measure about 5&nbsp;mm long. Each snail may lay several batches of eggs each year, usually in the wet season. They may lay eggs in holes in the ground like ''H. pomatia'', or lay eggs on the surface of a rocky soil, in organic matter, or at the base of plants. In 10 to 30 days, the eggs hatch releasing snails about 4&nbsp;mm long. These snails grow up to 10&nbsp;mm per month. After 6 months, the Achatina fulica is about 35&nbsp;mm long and may already be sexually mature. [[Sexual maturity]] takes 6 to 16 months, depending on weather and the availability of [[calcium]]. This snail lives 5 or 6 years, sometimes as many as 9 years.\n\n=== Growth ===\nWithin the same snail population and under the same conditions, some snails will grow faster than others. Some will take twice as long to mature. This may help the species survive bad weather, etc., in the wild. However, a snail farmer should obviously select and keep the largest and fastest maturing snails for breeding stock and sell the smaller snails. By selecting only the largest, the average size of the snail may increase significantly in only a couple of generations. Most of the differences in growth are probably due to environmental factors including stocking density. However, to whatever extent these differences are genetic, farmers generally breed large, fast-growing snails instead of small, slower-growing ones.\n\nSeveral factors can greatly influence the growth of snails including: population density, stress (snails are sensitive to noise, light, vibration, unsanitary conditions, irregular feedings, being touched, etc.), feed, temperature and moisture, and the breeding technology used.\n\n''H. aspersa'' requires at least 3% to 4% calcium in the soil (or another source of calcium) for good growth. Most snails need more calcium in the soil than ''H. aspersa''. Low calcium intake will slow the growth rate and cause the shell to be thinner. Calcium may be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. Food is only one calcium source. Snails may eat paint or attack walls of buildings seeking calcium, and they also will eat dirt.\n\nA newborn's shell size depends on the egg size since the shell develops from the egg's surface membrane. As the snail grows, the shell is added onto in increments. Eventually the shell will develop a flare or reinforcing lip at its opening. This shows that the snail is now mature; there will be no further shell growth. Growth is measured by shell size, since a snail's body weight varies and fluctuates, even in 100% humidity. The growth rate varies considerably between individuals in each population group. Adult size, which is related to the growth rate, also varies, thus the fastest growers are usually the largest snails. Eggs from larger, healthier snails also tend to grow faster and thus larger.\n\nDryness inhibits growth and even stops activity. When it becomes too hot and dry in summer, the snail becomes inactive, seals its shell and [[estivation|estivates]] (becomes dormant) until cooler, moister weather returns. Some snails estivate in groups on tree trunks, posts, or walls. They seal themselves to the surface, thus sealing up the shell opening.\n\nPeak snail activity (including feeding and thus growth) occurs a few hours after sunset, when the temperature is lower and the water content (in the form of [[dew]]) is higher. During daytime snails usually seek shelter.\n\n== Farming snails ==\nSuccessful snail culture requires the correct equipment and supplies, including: [[snail pens]] or enclosures; devices for measuring humidity ([[hygrometer]]), temperature ([[thermometer]]), soil moisture ([[soil moisture sensor]]), and light (in foot candles); a weight scale and an instrument to measure snail size; a kit for testing soil contents; and a magnifying glass to see the eggs. Equipment to control the climate ([[temperature]] and [[humidity]]), to regulate water (e.g., a sprinkler system to keep the snails moist and a drainage system), to provide light and shade, and to kill or keep out pests and predators may also be needed. Some horticultural systems such as artificial lighting systems and water sprinklers may be adapted for snail culture. Better results are obtained if snails of the same kind and generation are used. Some recommend putting the hatchlings in another pen.\n\nFour systems of snail farms can be distinguished:\n* Outdoor pens.\n* In buildings with a controlled climate.\n* In closed systems such as plastic tunnel houses or \"[[greenhouse]]s.\"\n* In addition, snails may breed and hatch inside in a controlled environment and then (after 6 to 8 weeks) may be placed in outside pens to mature.\n\n=== Favorable conditions ===\n\n'''Climate''': A mild climate {{convert|15|-|25|C|F}} with high humidity (75% to 95%) is best for snail farming, though most varieties can stand a wider range of temperatures. The optimal temperature is {{convert|21|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for many varieties. When the temperature falls below {{convert|7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, snails hibernate. Under {{convert|12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} the snails are inactive, and under {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, all growth stops. When the temperature rises much above {{convert|27|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} or conditions become too dry, snails estivate. Wind is bad for snails because it speeds up moisture loss, and snails must retain moisture.\n\n'''Moisture''': Snails thrive in damp but not waterlogged environments and thus a well-draining soil is required. Research indicates that water content around 80% of the carrying capacity of the soil and air [[humidity]] over 80% (during darkness) are the most favorable conditions. Many farmers use [[Aerosol spray|mist-producing devices]] to maintain proper moisture in the air and/or soil.<ref>http://publications.cta.int/publications/publication/1497/</ref> Also, if the system contains alive vegetation, the leaves are to be periodically wet.\n\n'''[[Soil]]''': Snails dig in soil and ingest it. Good soil favors snail growth and provides some of their nutrition. Lack of access to good soil may cause fragile shells even when the snails have well-balanced feed; the snails growth may lag far behind the growth of other snails on good soil. Snails will often eat feed, then go eat dirt. Sometimes, they will eat only one or the other.\n\nA well-functional soil would have the following characteristics:\n* Containing neither a lot of [[sand]] nor too much [[clay]], as snails strive to dig into hard clay and sand dries out easily.\n* 20\u201340% organic matter content. Organic matter enhances [[cation exchange capacity]] of calcium and [[magnesium]] which in turn stimulates growth.\n* [[pH]] around 7.\n* Adequate [[calcium]], the primary constituent of shells (up to 98%). A common way to introduce calcium is to add ground [[limestone]] at a suggested concentration of {{convert|0.5|kg/m2|lb/sqft}}. Calcium may also be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. More advanced techniques involve the addition of [[polyacrylamide]] with the following concentration: 12.5&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> of a 160&nbsp;g M.A./one preparation in 250 cc of water per kilogram of dry soil. Such stabilization treatment helps the soil structure resist washing and allows regular cleaning without destroying the crumb structure of the soil that is beneficial for egg laying.\n\nSoil care: A farmer must find a way to prevent the soil from becoming fouled with mucus and droppings and also tackle undesirable [[Soil chemistry|chemical changes]] that may occur in time.\n\nSoil mix suggestions:\n* [[peat]], clay, [[compost]] and [[calcium carbonate|CaCO<sub>3</sub>]]\n* [[Leaf mold]] (at pH 7)\n\n=== Pens and enclosures ===\n\nThe U.S. [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] ([[APHIS]]) Standards for [[Snail-Rearing Facilities]] were revised March 2001 and are available on the APHIS website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415075557/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |archive-date=2006-04-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEnclosures for snails are usually long and thin instead of square. This allows the workers to walk around (without harming the snails) and reach into the whole pen. The enclosure may be a trough with sides made of [[wood]], [[Concrete masonry unit|block]], [[fiber cement sheets]], or [[galvanized]] [[sheet steel]]. Cover it with [[Sieve|screen]] or [[netting]]. The covering confines the snails and keeps out birds and other predators. Fences or walls are usually {{convert|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1}} high plus at least {{convert|5|in|cm}} into the ground. Fencing made of galvanized metal or hard-plastic sheets helps keep out some predators. A cover will protect against heavy rain. Shade (which may be a fine mesh screen) on warm winter days helps keep the snails dormant. 5&nbsp;mm mesh or finer is used for pen screens or fences. Pens containing baby snails need a finer mesh.\n\nSnails need hiding places, especially during the warm daytime. Plastic soil drainage pipes from the local [[garden center]] can be split in two lengthwise, and stacked one layer one way and the next layer at a right angle, providing shelter and also increasing by 50% the number of snails that can live in the pen.\n\nA sprinkler system ensures moisture when needed and can be turned on at sunset rather than earlier in the day, when the moisture may drive snails out into hot sunshine. Temperature and humidity can be monitored using a thermometer and a hygrometer.\n\nThe bottom of the enclosure, if it is not the ground or trays of dirt, needs be a surface more solid than screening. A snail placed in a wire-mesh-bottom pen will keep crawling, trying to get off the wires and onto solid, more comfortable ground.\n\nIn order to prevent escapes, in an open pen, the top of the fences curve inward in a half circle; this works to confine the vineyard snail. However, ''H. aspersa'' can escape from such an open pen, and an electric fence may be needed to contain them. [The [[electric fence]] top has two or more thin wires that are 2 to 4&nbsp;mm apart. Each wire carries the opposite charge of the wire next to it. A battery or transformer is used to supply 4 to 12 [[volt]]s to the wire. A snail will get a mild shock and retract when it crawls over a wire and touches a second wire.]\n\nAnother technique to confine snails is to bend the fence top inward into a sharp \"V\" shape with about a 20-degree angle. The snail's shell will hit the bent-back part of the screen before the snail can reach up and start crawling on it. This blocks the snail, and the angled screen automatically compensates for the size of the snail.\n\nAnother alternative, suitable for solid wall enclosures, is to attach to the wall a horizontal piece of screen that projects inward several inches over the enclosure. The screen is made with material such as nylon monofilament that is moderately stiff and springy yet easily flexible. On the inside edge of the screen, the cross fibers are removed, producing a fringe several inches wide. When a snail crawls on the underside of the screen and moves out onto the fringe, his weight pulls several individual fibers down. One by one, another fiber gets away from the snail and springs back up out of reach. Eventually the snail is dangling by a thread. The snail then falls, because the surface area is not big enough to crawl on.\n\nBecause snails usually will not cross a [[copper]] band, another solution is to top the fence with a copper band at least {{convert|3|in|cm|round=5}} wide. The band can be bent so that part of it faces inward and is parallel to the pen floor. The band must not be placed very close to the ground, because rain may wash soil against the copper and leave a residue that may enable the snail to cross it. The bottom of the fence must be buried deep enough into the ground so that the snails cannot dig under it.\n\nAn alternate method is to make a square pen with a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}}-square garden in it. Plant about six crops, e.g., [[Urtica|nettles]] and [[artichoke]]s, inside the pen. The snails will choose what they want to eat. If it has not rained, turn sprinklers on for about 15 minutes at dusk, unless the snails are dormant. A disadvantage to this method is that, if the snails are not mature at the end of the year, it is difficult to replant fresh plant crops in the pens.\n\nPlastic tunnels make cheap, easy snail enclosures, but it is difficult to regulate heat and humidity. The tunnel will be {{convert|10|to|20|F-change|C-change|0}} warmer than the outside, and snails become dormant when the temperature climbs above {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.\n\nWhen snails are raised indoors under controlled conditions, reproduction varies according to the geographic origin of the [[breeding stock]]. For example, one researcher found that ''H. aspersa'' snails from [[Brittany]] seem to do better indoors than snails from another region. To breed snails indoors, the temperature needs to be kept at {{convert|70|F|C}} and the relative humidity at 80% to 90%; some sources say 95%. Another source recommends 75% humidity by day and 95% at night. The [[Center for Heliciculture]] once recommended 65\u201375% humidity during the day and 85\u201395% at night at {{convert|68|F|C}}. In any event, avoid humidity higher than 95% (some say 90%) for any length of time. Excessive humidity can kill snails. Optimum temperature and relative humidity depend on several things, including the snail variety and even where breeding stock was gathered. For ''H. aspersa'', the optimum temperature for hatching eggs seems to be {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} at 100% relative humidity. The second best temperature/humidity combination depends on where the snails came from and results can drop drastically to 0% hatching at {{convert|17|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and 100% humidity. The soil must not be kept wet when the humidity is maintained at 100%, as the eggs will absorb water, swell up, and burst.\n\n[[Fluorescent lamp]]s can be used to give artificial daylight. Different snails respond to day length in different ways. The ratio of light to darkness influences activity, feeding, and mating and egg-laying. Eighteen or more hours of light apparently stimulate ''H. aspersa'' growth, while less than 12 hours inhibit it. Some snail species may associates the long hours of light with the start of summer\u2014the peak growing season. Eighteen hours of daylight also appear optimal for breeding (mating and egg laying), but snails will breed in darkness.\n\nSnails can be bred in boxes or cages stacked several units high. An automatic sprinkler system can be used to provide moisture. Breeding cages need a feed trough and a water trough. Plastic trays a couple of inches deep are adequate; deeper water troughs increase the chance of snails drowning in them. Trays can be set on a bed of small gravel. Small plastic pots, e.g., flower pots about {{convert|3|in|cm}} deep, can be filled with sterilized dirt (or a loamy pH neutral soil) and set in the gravel to give the snails a place to lay their eggs. After the snails lay eggs each pot is replaced. (Set one pot inside another so that one can be easily lifted without shifting the gravel.)\n\nWhen the snails have laid their eggs, the pots are put in a nursery where the eggs will hatch. The young snails are kept in the nursery for about 6 weeks, and then moved to a separate pen, as young snails do best if kept with other snails of similar size. Eight hours of daylight is optimal for young snails.\n\nBaby snails are fed on tender [[lettuce]] leaves ([[Boston lettuce|Boston]] type, but [[head lettuce|head]] type is probably also good.)\n\nSome who raise ''H. aspersa'' separate the five stages: reproduction, hatching, young, fattening, and final fattening.\n\nIn a typical example, the [[Reproduction|breeding]] box has [[concrete]] sides, soil with [[earthworm]]s (to cleanse the soil) on the bottom, vegetation, curved tiles to provide shelter, feeders, and a chicken waterer. [[Mosquito]] netting or screening covers the top. These breeding boxes may be outside, or better results may be obtained when the boxes are inside a greenhouse\u2014as long as the greenhouse does not get too hot or too dry. One researcher reported that in outdoor boxes, each breeder snail had about seven young. In greenhouses, each breeder snail had about 9 to 12 young. The researcher felt that under better weather conditions than those he had that year, each adult breeder snail would have produced 15 young snails.\n\n[[Fattening pens]] can be outside or in a greenhouse. High summer temperatures and insufficient moisture cause dwarfing and malformations of some snails. This is more a problem inside greenhouses if the sun overheats the building. A sprinkler system (e.g., a [[horticultural]] system or common lawn sprinklers) can supply moisture. Make sure excess water can drain.\n\nFattening pens may contain {{convert|2|by|3|ft|m|adj=on}} pieces (or other convenient size) of heavy plastic sheets, hung from boards resting on a rack that lets the tips of the plastic sheets just touch the ground. The plastic sheets are about {{convert|4|in|cm}} apart. The sheets give the snails a resting and hiding place. Feeders may be located on the rack that supports the plastic sheets.\n\nA layer of coarse sand and [[topsoil]] with earthworms is placed on the fattening pen's bottom. The worms help clean up the snail droppings.\n\nSnails that hatched the previous summer can be put in a chilled room for hibernation over winter. About 1 April, (adjusted for local climate), they are moved to the final fattening pen. IN cases where there are several fattening pens, the smaller snails are placed in one, medium in another, large in another. One-third of a pound of ''H. aspersa'' snails require one square foot of pen. Snails lose weight when they estivate in summer, therefore some growers do not stock pens by weight but by count. For ''H. aspersa'', 10 to 12 snails per square foot is the maximum.\n\n=== Cannibalism by hatchlings ===\nThe first snails to hatch eat the shells of their eggs. This gives them calcium needed for their shells. They may then begin eating unhatched eggs. If the snail eggs are kept at the optimum temperature, {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} (for some varieties), and if none of the eggs lose moisture, most eggs will hatch within 1 to 3 days of each other. [[Cannibalism]] also will be low. If hatching extends over a longer period, cannibalism may increase. Some eggs eaten are eggs that were not fertile or did not develop properly, but sometimes, properly developing embryos might be eaten. A high density of \"clutches\" of egg masses increases the rate of cannibalism, as other nearby egg masses are more likely to be found and eaten. Snail egg has 12 to 20 times the protein of lettuce. The protein helps the baby snails start developing quickly and be healthier. Snail egg is an excellent starter food for newly hatched snails, but they tend to only eat eggs of their own species.\n\n=== Feeding ===\nFeeding season is April through October, (or may vary with the local climate), with a \"rest period\" during the summer. Do not place food in one small clump so that there is not enough room for all the snails to get to it. Snails eat solid food by [[rasping]] it away with their [[radula]]. Feeding activity depends on the weather, and snails may not necessarily feed every day. Evening irrigation in dry weather may encourage feeding since the moisture makes it easier for the snails to move about.\n\nPut the breeding snails in the breeding pens in April or early May. Feed until mid June when mating begins and the snails stop feeding. Snails resume eating after they lay eggs. Once snails have laid their eggs, the adult snails can be removed. This leaves more food and less crowding for the hatchlings.\n\nSnails of the same species collected from different regions may have different food preferences. Some foods that snails eat are: [[Alyssum]], fruit and leaves of [[apple]], [[apricot]], [[artichoke]] (a favorite), [[Aster (genus)|aster]], [[barley]], [[beans]], [[bindweed]], [[California boxwood]], almost any [[cabbage]] variety, [[camomile]], [[carnation]], [[carrot]], [[cauliflower]], [[celeriac]] (root celery), [[celery]], ripe [[cherries]], [[chive]], citrus, [[clover]], [[cucumber]]s (a favorite snail food), [[dandelion]], [[Elderberry|elder]], [[henbane]], [[hibiscus]], [[hollyhock]], [[kale]], larkspur ([[Consolida]] or [[Delphinium]] genera), [[leek]], lettuce (liked, and makes good snails), [[lily]], [[magnolia]], [[mountain ash]], [[mulberry]], [[chrysanthemum]], [[Tropaeolum|nasturtium]], [[Urtica|nettle]], [[nightshade]] berries, [[oats]], [[onion]] greens, [[pansy]], [[parsley]], [[peach]], ripe [[pear]]s, [[pea]]s, [[petunia]], [[phlox]], [[plum]], [[potato]]es (raw or cooked), [[pumpkin]]s, [[radish]], [[rapeseed|rape]], [[rose]], [[sorrel]], [[spinach]], [[sweet pea]], [[thistle]], [[tomato]]es (well liked), [[turnip]], [[wheat]], [[yarrow]], [[zinnia]]. They will eat sweet [[lupin]]es, but will reject bitter [[lupin]]es and other plants with high [[quinolizidine]] [[alkaloid]]s. Snails also avoid plants that produce other defensive chemicals, defensive stem hairs, etc.\n\nSnails usually prefer juicy leaves and vegetables over dry ones. If snails are fed vegetable trimmings, damaged fruit, and cooked potatoes, uneaten food must be promptly removed as it will quickly spoil. Bran may be supplied that is wet or sprinkled dry over leafy vegetables. The diet may consist of 20% [[wheat bran]] while 80% is fruit and vegetable material. Some growers use [[oats]], [[corn meal]], [[soybean meal]], or [[chicken]] mash. Laying mash provides calcium, as does crushed [[oyster]] shells. Snails also may eat materials such as cardboard (but do not purposely feed it to them); they can eat through shipping cartons and escape. Snails may sometimes eat, within a 24-hour period, food equal to 10%, and occasionally as much as 20%, of their [[body weight]]. Active snails deprived of food will lose more than one-third of their weight before they starve to death\u2014a process that takes 8 to 12 weeks. Estivating snails can survive much longer.\n\nSupply calcium at least once a week if it is not available in the soil. It should not contain harmful salts or be so alkaline as to burn the snails. Mix calcium with wet bran or mashed potatoes and serve on a pan; this will keep any leftover food from rotting on the ground.\n\nSome researchers use chicken mash for feed. A plastic pipe can be cut in half lengthwise to make two troughs which can be used as feeders for mash. Mix laying mash (used for egg-producing hens) into the feed to provide calcium for the snails' shells. Commercial chicken feeding mash is around 16% to 17% protein, from fish meal and meat meal, making it good for growing snails. Supplying mash to hatchlings might reduce cannibalism. Two feeds that snails like and that promote good growth are: (A) broiler finisher mash consisting of 7% broiler concentrate, 58% corn, 16% soya, 18% sorghum, 7% limestone flour (40% Ca); and (B) chicken feed (pellets) for layers consisting of 5% layer concentrate, 10%, corn, 15% soya, 20% sorghum, 44% barley, 6% limestone flour (40% Ca).\n\nPellets are fine for larger snails, but mash is better for younger ones. Pellets should be partially crushed if fed to young snails. Snails do not grow well if rabbit pellets are their primary diet. Snails show a distinct preference for moist feed. Easy access to enough water must be ensured if snails are fed dry mash.\n\nBe sure to frequently clean the feed and water dishes. The amount of feed a snail eats depends very much on air humidity and on the availability of drinking water. Clean drinking water can be served in a shallow container to reduce the risk of the snail drowning. Some types of chicken waterers may be suitable. Other factors (e.g., temperature, light intensity, food preferences versus food supplied, etc.) also affect feeding. A compromise, until the optimum feed is found, is to feed half green vegetable material and half chicken feed/grain/animal protein.\n\nYoung ''H. aspersa'' readily eats [[milk powder]]. Its rapid rate of assimilation promotes rapid growth.\n\n=== Diseases and pests ===\nGood hygiene can prevent the spread of disease and otherwise improve the health and growth rate of snails. Food is replaced daily in order to prevent spoilage. Earthworms added to the soil help keep the pen clean.\n\n[[Parasitism|Parasites]], [[nematode]]s, [[trematoda|trematodes]], [[fungi]], and micro[[arthropod]]s can attack snails, and such problems can spread rapidly when snail populations are dense. The bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' causes intestinal infections that can spread rapidly in a crowded snail pen.\n\nPossible predators include [[rat]]s, [[Mouse|mice]], [[Mole (animal)|moles]], [[skunk]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[bird]]s, [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s, [[lizard]]s, walking insects (e.g., some [[beetle]] and [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]] varieties), some types of [[Fly|flies]], [[centipede]]s, and even certain carnivorous snail species, such as ''[[Strangesta capillacea]]''.\n\n=== Population density ===\nPopulation density also affects successful snail production. Pens should contain no more than six to eight fair-sized snails per square foot, or about four large ''H. pomatias''; or figure one kilogram per square meter (about .2 pounds of snail per square foot), which automatically compensates for the size of the snails. To encourage breeding, best results will occur with not more than eight snails per square meter (0.8 per square foot). Some sources say that, for ''H. pomatia'' to breed, 2 to 4 snails per square meter (0.2 to 0.4 per square foot) is the maximum.\n\nSnails tend not to breed when packed too densely or when the [[wikt:slime|slime]] in the pen accumulates too much. The slime apparently works like a [[pheromone]] and suppresses reproduction. On the other hand, snails in groups of about 100 seem to breed better than when only a few snails are confined together. Perhaps they have more potential mates from which to choose. Snails in a densely populated area grow more slowly even when food is abundant, and they also have a higher mortality rate. These snails then become smaller adults who lay fewer clutches of eggs, have fewer eggs per clutch, and the eggs have a lower hatch rate. Smaller adult snails sell for less. [[Dwarfing]] is quite common in snail farming and is attributable mainly to rearing conditions rather than [[heredity]] factors. Crowding snails is false economy. A recommended rate for ''H. aspersa'' is not more than one-third pound per square foot (3.6&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of soil surface for snails that weigh more than 1&nbsp;gram and not more than 0.2 pound per square foot (2.2&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) for snails that weigh less. (One ounce is about 28&nbsp;grams.)\n\n== Turning snails into escargots ==\n{{Main|Escargot}}\nSnails are mature when a lip forms at the opening of their shell. Before they mature, their shells are more easily broken, making them undesirable. For ''H. aspersa'', commercial weight is 8&nbsp;grams or larger. The nutrient composition of raw snails (per 100&nbsp;grams of edible portion), according to information from the nutrient databank of France,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} is:\n* [[Food energy|Energy]]: 80.5 [[calorie|kcal]] (337 [[kilojoule|kJ]])\n* [[Water]]: 79 g\n* [[Protein]]: 16 g\n* Available [[carbohydrates]]: 2 g\n* [[Fiber]]: 0 g\n* [[Fat]]: 1 g\n* [[Magnesium]]: 250&nbsp;mg\n* [[Calcium]]: 170&nbsp;mg\n* [[Iron]]: 3.5&nbsp;mg\n* [[Vitamin C]]: 0&nbsp;mg\n\nSnail eggs are also harvested and processed to produce [[snail caviar]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2007-12-15-snail-caviar-the-new-gourmet-frontier |title=Snail caviar! The new gourmet frontier |newspaper=[[Mail & Guardian]] |date=December 15, 2007 |accessdate=21 January 2015 |author=Bertrand, Jordane}}</ref>\n\n== Restrictions and regulations ==\n\n=== United States ===\nThe same snails that some people raise or gather as food also are agricultural pests that cause considerable crop damage. Introduced slug and snail varieties tend to be worse pests than native species, probably due in part to the lack of natural controls. Snail pests attack crops ranging from leafy vegetables to fruits that grow near the ground, such as strawberries and tomatoes, to citrus fruits high up on trees.\n\nThe [[Federal Plant Pest Act]] defines a plant pest as \"any living stage (including active and dormant forms) of [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[slug]]s, [[snail]]s, [[protozoa]], or other [[invertebrate]] animals, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], other [[parasite|parasitic plants]] or reproductive parts thereof; viruses; or any organisms similar to or allied with any of the foregoing; or any [[infection|infectious]] substances, which can directly or indirectly injure or cause disease or damage in or to any plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured, or other products of plants...\" The [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS) categorizes giant African snails as a \"quarantine significant plant pest.\" The United States does not allow live giant African snails into the country under any circumstances. It is illegal to own or to possess them. APHIS vigorously enforces this regulation and destroys or returns these snails to their country of origin.\n\nSince large infestations of snails can do devastating damage, many states have quarantines against nursery products, and other products, from infested states. Further, it is illegal to import snails (or slugs) into the U.S. without permission from the [[Plant Protection and Quarantine Division]] (PPQ), [[Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service]], U.S. Department of Agriculture. APHIS also oversees interstate transportation of snails. Anyone who plans to \"import, release, or make interstate shipments of\" snails, must complete APHIS's PPQ Form 526, Application and Permit to Move Live Plant Pests and Noxious Weeds. This form should be submitted to the State regulatory official. The state will process the request and make a recommendation to APHIS who will then make a decision.\n\nInformation on Plant Pest Permits is available at APHIS's website [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm].\n\nThe [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates the canning of low-[[acid]] foods such as snails. According to FDA, \"establishments engaged in the manufacture of Low-acid or Acidified Canned Foods (LACF) offered for interstate commerce in the United States are required...to register their facility...and file scheduled processes for their products with\" the FDA. This does not refer to fresh products. For appropriate forms, contact: LACF Registration Coordinator, HFS-618, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 200 C Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20204. Telephone: (202) 205-5282. FAX: (202) 205-4758 or (202) 205-4128.\n\nImproper canning of low-acid meats, e.g., snails, involves a risk of [[botulism]]. When canning snails for home consumption, carefully follow canning instructions for low-acid meats to prevent food poisoning.\n\nState laws also may apply to imports into certain states and to raising snails in a given state. Some states may want to inspect and approve facilities. Thus anyone who plans to raise snails also should check with their State's Agriculture Department.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n* Rebecca Thompson and Sheldon Cheney [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm '''Raising Snails'''] \"[[National Agricultural Library]], [[Agricultural Research Service]], [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].\"\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm |date=June 8, 2004 |title=Source of this article in Russian }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060711074205/http://bursaagricola.ro/Info-CRESTEREA_MELCILOR-4-23640-1.html Source of this article in] Romanian\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080728004505/http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/NAP/00-188.htm Breeding and Growing Snails Commercially in Australia]\n* [http://escargot.free.fr/eng/index.html Escargot Passion]\n* [https://rirdc.infoservices.com.au/items/06-104 Free-range Snail Farming in Australia] Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, Australian government\n* [http://www.manandmollusc.net/molluscan_food_files/molluscan_food_terrestrial.html Man and Mollusc's Data Base of Edible Molluscs]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080416174658/http://www.sdnetwork.kabissa.org/newscollection/ideanews_1.htm#GrowSnail Snail Farming in Africa]\n* [http://www.snailcream.co.uk/heliculture/ Snail Farming (Heliculture)]\n* [http://africabusinessclassroom.com/snail-farming-in-nigeria-how-to-start-make-money/  Snail Farming in Nigeria]\n\n{{Edible molluscs}}\n\n[[Category:Agriculture]]\n[[Category:Gastropods and humans]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Eyragues-l-Escargot-des-Alpilles-5738.jpg|thumb|A snail farm near [[Eyragues]], [[Provence]], [[France]]]]\n'''Heliciculture''', commonly known as '''snail farming''', is the process of raising edible [[land snail]]s, primarily for human consumption or cosmetic use. The meat and  [[Snail caviar|snail eggs]] can be consumed as [[escargot]] and as a type of caviar respectively. Mucus, commonly known as [[snail slime]], has medical properties and is used in [[cosmetics]].\n\nPerhaps the best known edible land snail species in the [[Western world]] is the [[Helix pomatia]], commonly known as [[Roman snail]] or [[Burgundy snail]]. This species is however not fit for profitable snail farming, and normally harvested from nature.\n\nCommercial snail farming in the Western world is typically done with either the ''[[Cornu aspersum]],'' formerly known as Helix ''aspersa'' M\u00fcller'','' or the [[Helix aspersa Maxima|Helix ''aspersa'' Maxima]]. In tropical climates snail farming is typically done with the ''[[African snail]],'' which biologically does not fall in the family of [[Helicidae]], and the meat of which therefore may not be called escargot.\n\n== History ==\nRoasted snail shells have been found in [[archaeological]] excavations, an indication that snails have been eaten since prehistoric times.<ref>[http://watarts.uwaterloo.ca/~dlubell/Antibes.pdf Prehistoric edible land snails in the circum-Mediterranean: the archaeological evidence.], D.

Lubell.</ref>\n\n''Lumaca romana'', (translation: Roman snail), was an ancient method of snail farming or heliciculture in the region about [[Tarquinia]]. This snail farming method was described by [[:la:Quintus Fulvius Lippinus|Fulvius Lippinus]] (49 BC) and mentioned by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in ''De Re rustica'' III, 12.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Varro/de_Re_Rustica/3*.html#12 De Re Rustica III, 12]</ref> The snails were fattened for human consumption using [[spelt]] and aromatic herbs. People usually raised snails in pens near the house, and these pens were called \"[[:la:Cochlea (animal)|cochlea]].\"\n\nThe Romans, in particular, are known to have considered escargot as an elite food, as noted in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. The Romans selected the best snails for breeding. Shells of the edible land snail species ''[[Otala lactea]]'' have been recovered in [[archaeological]] excavations of [[Volubilis]] in present-day [[Morocco]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan, ''Volubilis'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham (2007) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906]</ref>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described the snail garden of [[Fulvius Hirpinus]] 2,000 years ago as having separate sections for different species of snails. [[Hirpinus]] allegedly fed his snails on meal and wine.\n\n\"Wall fish\" were also often eaten in Britain, but were never as popular as on the continent. There, people often ate snails during [[Lent]], and in a few places, they consumed large quantities of snails at Mardi Gras or Carnival, as a foretaste of Lent.\n\nAccording to some sources, the French exported [[Helix aspersa|brown garden snails]] to California in the 1850s, raising them as the delicacy [[escargot]]. Other sources claim that Italian immigrants were the first to bring the snail to the United States.\n\n== Economic impact ==\nU.S. imports of snails were worth more than $4.5 million in 1995 and came from 24 countries. This includes preserved or prepared snails and snails that are live, fresh, chilled, or frozen. Major exporters to the U.S. are [[France]], [[Indonesia]], [[Greece]] and [[China]]. The U.S. exported live, fresh, chilled, or frozen snails worth $55,000 to 13 countries; most were shipped to [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Individual statistics are not available for U.S. exports of prepared or processed snails from the U.S. [[Department of Commerce]].\n\n== Edible land snail species ==\n[[File:Snails-Italy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Three different species of snails for sale in a market in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]]]\nEdible land snails range in size from about one millimeter long to the giant African snails, which occasionally grow up to {{convert|312|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} in length. \"Escargot\" most commonly refers to either ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' or to ''[[Helix pomatia]]'', although other varieties of snails are eaten. ''[[Achatina fulica]]'', a giant African snail, is sliced and [[Canning|canned]] and passed off on some consumers as escargot. Terms such as \"garden snail\" or \"common brown garden snail\" are rather meaningless since they refer to so many types of snails, but they sometimes mean ''H. aspersa''.\n* ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' is also known as the French \"petit gris,\" \"small grey snail,\" the \"escargot chagrine,\" or \"la zigrinata.\" The shell of a mature adult has four to five whorls and measures 30 to 45&nbsp;mm across. It is native to the shores of the Mediterranean and up the coast of Spain and France. It is found on many British Isles, where the Romans introduced it in the 1st century AD (Some references say it dates to the Early Bronze Age.) In the early 19th century the French brought it into California, where it has become a serious pest. These snails are now common throughout the U.S. It was introduced into several Eastern and Gulf states even before 1850 and, later introduced into other countries such as Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico, and Argentina. ''C. aspersum'' has a life span of 2 to 5 years. This species is more adaptable to different climates and conditions than many snails, and is found in woods, fields, sand dunes, and gardens. This adaptability not only increases ''C. aspersum's'' range, but it also makes farming ''C. aspersum'' easier and less risky.\n* ''[[Helix pomatia]]'' measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It also is called the \"Roman snail,\" \"apple snail,\" \"lunar,\" \"la vignaiola,\" the German \"Weinbergschnecke,\" the French \"escargot de Bourgogne\" or \"Burgundy snail,\" or \"gros blanc.\" Native over a large part of Europe, it lives in wooded mountains and valleys up to {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} altitude and in vineyards and gardens. The Romans may have introduced it into Britain. Immigrants introduced it into the U.S. in Michigan and Wisconsin. Many prefer ''H. pomatia'' to ''H. aspersa'' for its flavor and its larger size, as the \"escargot par excellence.\"\n* ''[[Otala lactea]]'' is sometimes called the \"vineyard snail,\" \"milk snail,\" or \"Spanish snail.\" The shell is white with reddish brown spiral bands and measures about 26 to 35&nbsp;mm in diameter.\n* ''[[Iberus alonensis]]'', the Spanish \"vaqueta\" or \"serrana,\" measures about 30&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n[[File:Cepaea nemoralis pair banded shells.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'']]\n* ''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'', the \"grove snail,\" or the Spanish \"vaqueta,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm across the shell. It inhabits Central Europe and was introduced into, and is now naturalized in many U.S. states, from Massachusetts to California, and from Tennessee to Canada. Its habitat ranges widely from woods to dunes. It mainly eats dead plant material, but it likes nettles and buttercups and will eat dead worms and dead snails.\n* ''[[Cepaea hortensis]]'', the \"white-lipped snail,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm across the shell which often has distinct dark stripes. It is native to central and northern Europe. This species was introduced into Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire in colonial times, but it never became established in these states. Its habitat varies but ''C. hortensis'' is found in colder and wetter places than ''C. nemoralis''. Their smaller size and some people's opinion that they do not taste as good make ''C. hortensis'' and ''C. nemoralis'' less popular than the larger European land snails.\n* ''[[Otala punctata]]'', called \"vaqueta\" in some parts of Spain, measures about 35&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n* ''[[Eobania vermiculata]]'', the \"vinyala,\" \"mongeta,\" or \"xona,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm. It is found in Mediterranean countries and was introduced into Louisiana and Texas.\n* ''[[Helix lucorum]]'', sometimes called \"escargo turc,\" measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It is found in central Italy and from Yugoslavia through the Crimea to Turkey and around the Black Sea.\n* ''[[Helix adanensis]]'' comes from around Turkey.\n* ''[[Helix aperta]]'' measures about 25&nbsp;mm. Its meat is highly prized. It is native to France, Italy, and other Mediterranean countries and has become established in California and Louisiana. Sometimes known as the \"burrowing snail,\" it is found above ground only during rainy weather. In hot, dry weather, it burrows three to six inches into the ground and becomes dormant until rain soften the soil.\n* ''[[Theba pisana]]'', also called the \"banded snail\"or the \"cargol avellanenc,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm and lives on dry, exposed sites, usually near the sea. Native to Sicily, it has been spread to several European countries, including England. This snail is a serious garden pest and is the \"white snail\" that California once eradicated by using flamethrowers to burn off whole areas. In large numbers, up to 3,000 snails per tree, it can ravage a garden in 24 hours and a citrus or other crop in a couple of nights.\n* ''[[Sphincterochila candidissima]]'' or ''[[Leucochroa candidisima]]'', the \"cargol mongeta,\" or \"cargol jueu\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm.\n[[File:Achatina fulica Thailand.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''[[Achatina fulica]]'']]\n* ''[[Achatina fulica]]'' and other ''Achatina'' species, giant African snails. They can grow up to 326&nbsp;mm (1&nbsp;ft \u00be in) in length. Their native range is south of the Sahara in East Africa. This snail was purposely introduced into India in 1847. There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other Pacific locations and was inadvertently released in California after World War II, in Hawaii, and later in North Miami Florida in the 1970s. In many places, it is a serious agricultural pest that causes considerable crop damage. Also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odor that occurs when something like poison bait causes large numbers to die. The U.S. has made considerable effort to eradicate ''Achatina''. The [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has banned the importation and possession of live Giant African snails.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/29/illegal-giant-snails-threatening-america/|title=Illegal giant snails threatening America|date=2014-08-29|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}</ref> However, they are still sought after as pets due to the vibrant \"tiger stripes\" on their shells.\n\n== Biology ==\n\n=== Mating and egg laying ===\n\n==== General ====\nSnails are [[hermaphrodite]]s. Although they have both male and female [[reproductive organ]]s, they must mate with another snail of the same species before they lay eggs. Some snails may act as males one season and as females the next. Other snails play both roles at once and [[fertilize]] each other simultaneously. When the snail is large enough and mature enough, which may take several years, mating occurs in the late spring or early summer after several hours of [[courtship]]. Sometimes there is a second mating in summer. (In tropical climates, mating may occur several times a year. In some climates, snails mate around October and may mate a second time 2 weeks later.) After mating, the snail can store sperm received for up to a year, but it usually lays eggs within a few weeks. Snails are sometimes uninterested in mating with another snail of the same species that originated from a considerable distance away. For example, a ''H. aspersa'' from southern France may reject a ''H. aspersa'' from northern France.\n\n==== Helix ''pomatia''====\nSnails need soil at least 2&nbsp;inches deep in which to lay their eggs. For ''H. pomatia'', the soil should be at least 3&nbsp;inches deep to keep out pests such as [[ants]], [[earwig]]s, [[millipede]]s, etc. Dry soil is not suitable for the preparation of a nest, nor is soil that is too heavy. In clay soil that becomes hard, reproduction rates may decrease because the snails are unable to bury their eggs and the hatchlings have difficulty emerging from the nest. Hatchability of eggs depends on soil temperature, soil humidity, soil composition, etc. Soil consisting of 20% to 40% organic material is good. The soil should be kept at {{convert|41|to|50|F|C}}, and is best around {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Soil moisture should be maintained at 80%. One researcher removes eggs immediately after they are deposited, counts them, then keeps them on moist cotton until the eggs hatch and the young start to eat. Snails lose substantial weight by laying eggs. Some do not recover. About one-third of the snails will die after the breeding season.\n\n''H. pomatia'' eggs measure about 3&nbsp;mm in diameter and have a [[calcareous]] shell and a high [[yolk]] content. ''H. pomatia'' lays the eggs in July or August, 2 to 8 weeks after mating, in holes dug out in the ground. (Data varies widely on how long after mating snails lay eggs.) The snail puts its head into the hole or may crawl in until only the top of the shell is visible; then it deposits eggs from the genital opening just behind the head. It takes the snail 1 to 2 days to lay 30 to 50 eggs. Occasionally, the snail will lay about a dozen more a few weeks later. The snail covers the hole with a mixture of the slime it excretes and dirt. This slime, which the snail excretes to help it crawl and to help preserve the moisture in its soft body, is [[glycoprotein]] similar to eggwhite.\n\nFully developed baby ''H. pomatia'' snails hatch about 3 to 4 weeks after the eggs are laid, depending on temperature and humidity. Birds, insects, mice, toads and other predators take a heavy toll on the young snails. The snails eat and grow until the weather turns cold. They then dig a deep hole, sometimes as deep as {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=on}}, and seal themselves inside their shell and hibernate for the winter. This is a response to both decreasing temperature and shorter hours of daylight. When the ground warms up in spring, the snail emerges and goes on a binge of replacing lost moisture and eating.\n\n==== Helix ''aspersa''====\n''H. aspersa'' eggs are white, spherical, about {{cvt|3|mm|in|frac=8}} in diameter and are laid 5 days to 3 weeks after mating. (Data varies widely due to differences in climate and regional variations in the snails' habitats.) ''H. aspersa'' lays an average of 85 eggs in a nest that is {{convert|1|to|1+1/2|in|cm}} deep. Data varies from 30 to over 120 eggs, but high figures may be from when more than one snail lays eggs in the same nest.\n\nIn warm, damp climates, ''H. aspersa'' may lay eggs as often as five times from February through October, depending on the weather and region. Mating and egg-laying begin when there are at least 10 hours of daylight and continue until days begin to get shorter. In the United States, longer hours of sunlight that occur when temperatures are still too cold will affect this schedule, but increasing hours of daylight still stimulate egg laying. If warm enough, the eggs hatch in about 2 weeks, or in 4 weeks if cooler. It takes the baby snails several more days to break out of the sealed nest and climb to the surface. In a climate similar to southern California's, ''H. aspersa'' matures in about 2 years. In central Italy, ''H. aspersa'' hatches and emerges from the soil almost exclusively in the autumn. If well fed and not overcrowded, those snails that hatch at the start of the season will reach adult size and form a lip at the edge of their shell by the following June. If the environment is manipulated to get more early [[hatchlings]], the size and number of snails that mature the following year will increase. In South Africa, some ''H. aspersa'' mature in 10 months, and under ideal conditions in a laboratory, some have matured in 6 to 8 months. Most of ''H. aspersa's'' reproductive activity takes place in the second year of its life.\n\n===='''Achatina''' ''fulica''====\nBy contrast, one giant African snail, ''Achatina fulica'', lays 100 to 400 [[elliptical]] eggs that each measure about 5&nbsp;mm long. Each snail may lay several batches of eggs each year, usually in the wet season. They may lay eggs in holes in the ground like ''H. pomatia'', or lay eggs on the surface of a rocky soil, in organic matter, or at the base of plants. In 10 to 30 days, the eggs hatch releasing snails about 4&nbsp;mm long. These snails grow up to 10&nbsp;mm per month. After 6 months, the Achatina fulica is about 35&nbsp;mm long and may already be sexually mature. [[Sexual maturity]] takes 6 to 16 months, depending on weather and the availability of [[calcium]]. This snail lives 5 or 6 years, sometimes as many as 9 years.\n\n=== Growth ===\nWithin the same snail population and under the same conditions, some snails will grow faster than others. Some will take twice as long to mature. This may help the species survive bad weather, etc., in the wild. However, a snail farmer should obviously select and keep the largest and fastest maturing snails for breeding stock and sell the smaller snails. By selecting only the largest, the average size of the snail may increase significantly in only a couple of generations. Most of the differences in growth are probably due to environmental factors including stocking density. However, to whatever extent these differences are genetic, farmers generally breed large, fast-growing snails instead of small, slower-growing ones.\n\nSeveral factors can greatly influence the growth of snails including: population density, stress (snails are sensitive to noise, light, vibration, unsanitary conditions, irregular feedings, being touched, etc.), feed, temperature and moisture, and the breeding technology used.\n\n''H. aspersa'' requires at least 3% to 4% calcium in the soil (or another source of calcium) for good growth. Most snails need more calcium in the soil than ''H. aspersa''. Low calcium intake will slow the growth rate and cause the shell to be thinner. Calcium may be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. Food is only one calcium source. Snails may eat paint or attack walls of buildings seeking calcium, and they also will eat dirt.\n\nA newborn's shell size depends on the egg size since the shell develops from the egg's surface membrane. As the snail grows, the shell is added onto in increments. Eventually the shell will develop a flare or reinforcing lip at its opening. This shows that the snail is now mature; there will be no further shell growth. Growth is measured by shell size, since a snail's body weight varies and fluctuates, even in 100% humidity. The growth rate varies considerably between individuals in each population group. Adult size, which is related to the growth rate, also varies, thus the fastest growers are usually the largest snails. Eggs from larger, healthier snails also tend to grow faster and thus larger.\n\nDryness inhibits growth and even stops activity. When it becomes too hot and dry in summer, the snail becomes inactive, seals its shell and [[estivation|estivates]] (becomes dormant) until cooler, moister weather returns. Some snails estivate in groups on tree trunks, posts, or walls. They seal themselves to the surface, thus sealing up the shell opening.\n\nPeak snail activity (including feeding and thus growth) occurs a few hours after sunset, when the temperature is lower and the water content (in the form of [[dew]]) is higher. During daytime snails usually seek shelter.\n\n== Farming snails ==\nSuccessful snail culture requires the correct equipment and supplies, including: [[snail pens]] or enclosures; devices for measuring humidity ([[hygrometer]]), temperature ([[thermometer]]), soil moisture ([[soil moisture sensor]]), and light (in foot candles); a weight scale and an instrument to measure snail size; a kit for testing soil contents; and a magnifying glass to see the eggs. Equipment to control the climate ([[temperature]] and [[humidity]]), to regulate water (e.g., a sprinkler system to keep the snails moist and a drainage system), to provide light and shade, and to kill or keep out pests and predators may also be needed. Some horticultural systems such as artificial lighting systems and water sprinklers may be adapted for snail culture. Better results are obtained if snails of the same kind and generation are used. Some recommend putting the hatchlings in another pen.\n\nFour systems of snail farms can be distinguished:\n* Outdoor pens.\n* In buildings with a controlled climate.\n* In closed systems such as plastic tunnel houses or \"[[greenhouse]]s.\"\n* In addition, snails may breed and hatch inside in a controlled environment and then (after 6 to 8 weeks) may be placed in outside pens to mature.\n\n=== Favorable conditions ===\n\n'''Climate''': A mild climate {{convert|15|-|25|C|F}} with high humidity (75% to 95%) is best for snail farming, though most varieties can stand a wider range of temperatures. The optimal temperature is {{convert|21|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for many varieties. When the temperature falls below {{convert|7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, snails hibernate. Under {{convert|12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} the snails are inactive, and under {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, all growth stops. When the temperature rises much above {{convert|27|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} or conditions become too dry, snails estivate. Wind is bad for snails because it speeds up moisture loss, and snails must retain moisture.\n\n'''Moisture''': Snails thrive in damp but not waterlogged environments and thus a well-draining soil is required. Research indicates that water content around 80% of the carrying capacity of the soil and air [[humidity]] over 80% (during darkness) are the most favorable conditions. Many farmers use [[Aerosol spray|mist-producing devices]] to maintain proper moisture in the air and/or soil.<ref>http://publications.cta.int/publications/publication/1497/</ref> Also, if the system contains alive vegetation, the leaves are to be periodically wet.\n\n'''[[Soil]]''': Snails dig in soil and ingest it. Good soil favors snail growth and provides some of their nutrition. Lack of access to good soil may cause fragile shells even when the snails have well-balanced feed; the snails growth may lag far behind the growth of other snails on good soil. Snails will often eat feed, then go eat dirt. Sometimes, they will eat only one or the other.\n\nA well-functional soil would have the following characteristics:\n* Containing neither a lot of [[sand]] nor too much [[clay]], as snails strive to dig into hard clay and sand dries out easily.\n* 20\u201340% organic matter content. Organic matter enhances [[cation exchange capacity]] of calcium and [[magnesium]] which in turn stimulates growth.\n* [[pH]] around 7.\n* Adequate [[calcium]], the primary constituent of shells (up to 98%). A common way to introduce calcium is to add ground [[limestone]] at a suggested concentration of {{convert|0.5|kg/m2|lb/sqft}}. Calcium may also be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. More advanced techniques involve the addition of [[polyacrylamide]] with the following concentration: 12.5&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> of a 160&nbsp;g M.A./one preparation in 250 cc of water per kilogram of dry soil. Such stabilization treatment helps the soil structure resist washing and allows regular cleaning without destroying the crumb structure of the soil that is beneficial for egg laying.\n\nSoil care: A farmer must find a way to prevent the soil from becoming fouled with mucus and droppings and also tackle undesirable [[Soil chemistry|chemical changes]] that may occur in time.\n\nSoil mix suggestions:\n* [[peat]], clay, [[compost]] and [[calcium carbonate|CaCO<sub>3</sub>]]\n* [[Leaf mold]] (at pH 7)\n\n==== Pens and enclosures ====\n\nThe U.S. [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] ([[APHIS]]) Standards for [[Snail-Rearing Facilities]] were revised March 2001 and are available on the APHIS website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415075557/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |archive-date=2006-04-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEnclosures for snails are usually long and thin instead of square. This allows the workers to walk around (without harming the snails) and reach into the whole pen. The enclosure may be a trough with sides made of [[wood]], [[Concrete masonry unit|block]], [[fiber cement sheets]], or [[galvanized]] [[sheet steel]]. Cover it with [[Sieve|screen]] or [[netting]]. The covering confines the snails and keeps out birds and other predators. Fences or walls are usually {{convert|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1}} high plus at least {{convert|5|in|cm}} into the ground. Fencing made of galvanized metal or hard-plastic sheets helps keep out some predators. A cover will protect against heavy rain. Shade (which may be a fine mesh screen) on warm winter days helps keep the snails dormant. 5&nbsp;mm mesh or finer is used for pen screens or fences. Pens containing baby snails need a finer mesh.\n\nSnails need hiding places, especially during the warm daytime. Plastic soil drainage pipes from the local [[garden center]] can be split in two lengthwise, and stacked one layer one way and the next layer at a right angle, providing shelter and also increasing by 50% the number of snails that can live in the pen.\n\nA sprinkler system ensures moisture when needed and can be turned on at sunset rather than earlier in the day, when the moisture may drive snails out into hot sunshine. Temperature and humidity can be monitored using a thermometer and a hygrometer.\n\nThe bottom of the enclosure, if it is not the ground or trays of dirt, needs be a surface more solid than screening. A snail placed in a wire-mesh-bottom pen will keep crawling, trying to get off the wires and onto solid, more comfortable ground.\n\nIn order to prevent escapes, in an open pen, the top of the fences curve inward in a half circle; this works to confine the vineyard snail. However, ''H. aspersa'' can escape from such an open pen, and an electric fence may be needed to contain them. [The [[electric fence]] top has two or more thin wires that are 2 to 4&nbsp;mm apart. Each wire carries the opposite charge of the wire next to it. A battery or transformer is used to supply 4 to 12 [[volt]]s to the wire. A snail will get a mild shock and retract when it crawls over a wire and touches a second wire.]\n\nAnother technique to confine snails is to bend the fence top inward into a sharp \"V\" shape with about a 20-degree angle. The snail's shell will hit the bent-back part of the screen before the snail can reach up and start crawling on it. This blocks the snail, and the angled screen automatically compensates for the size of the snail.\n\nAnother alternative, suitable for solid wall enclosures, is to attach to the wall a horizontal piece of screen that projects inward several inches over the enclosure. The screen is made with material such as nylon monofilament that is moderately stiff and springy yet easily flexible. On the inside edge of the screen, the cross fibers are removed, producing a fringe several inches wide. When a snail crawls on the underside of the screen and moves out onto the fringe, his weight pulls several individual fibers down. One by one, another fiber gets away from the snail and springs back up out of reach. Eventually the snail is dangling by a thread. The snail then falls, because the surface area is not big enough to crawl on.\n\nBecause snails usually will not cross a [[copper]] band, another solution is to top the fence with a copper band at least {{convert|3|in|cm|round=5}} wide. The band can be bent so that part of it faces inward and is parallel to the pen floor. The band must not be placed very close to the ground, because rain may wash soil against the copper and leave a residue that may enable the snail to cross it. The bottom of the fence must be buried deep enough into the ground so that the snails cannot dig under it.\n\nAn alternate method is to make a square pen with a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}}-square garden in it. Plant about six crops, e.g., [[Urtica|nettles]] and [[artichoke]]s, inside the pen. The snails will choose what they want to eat. If it has not rained, turn sprinklers on for about 15 minutes at dusk, unless the snails are dormant. A disadvantage to this method is that, if the snails are not mature at the end of the year, it is difficult to replant fresh plant crops in the pens.\n\nPlastic tunnels make cheap, easy snail enclosures, but it is difficult to regulate heat and humidity. The tunnel will be {{convert|10|to|20|F-change|C-change|0}} warmer than the outside, and snails become dormant when the temperature climbs above {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.\n\nWhen snails are raised indoors under controlled conditions, reproduction varies according to the geographic origin of the [[breeding stock]]. For example, one researcher found that ''H. aspersa'' snails from [[Brittany]] seem to do better indoors than snails from another region. To breed snails indoors, the temperature needs to be kept at {{convert|70|F|C}} and the relative humidity at 80% to 90%; some sources say 95%. Another source recommends 75% humidity by day and 95% at night. The [[Center for Heliciculture]] once recommended 65\u201375% humidity during the day and 85\u201395% at night at {{convert|68|F|C}}. In any event, avoid humidity higher than 95% (some say 90%) for any length of time. Excessive humidity can kill snails. Optimum temperature and relative humidity depend on several things, including the snail variety and even where breeding stock was gathered. For ''H. aspersa'', the optimum temperature for hatching eggs seems to be {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} at 100% relative humidity. The second best temperature/humidity combination depends on where the snails came from and results can drop drastically to 0% hatching at {{convert|17|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and 100% humidity. The soil must not be kept wet when the humidity is maintained at 100%, as the eggs will absorb water, swell up, and burst.\n\n[[Fluorescent lamp]]s can be used to give artificial daylight. Different snails respond to day length in different ways. The ratio of light to darkness influences activity, feeding, and mating and egg-laying. Eighteen or more hours of light apparently stimulate ''H. aspersa'' growth, while less than 12 hours inhibit it. Some snail species may associates the long hours of light with the start of summer\u2014the peak growing season. Eighteen hours of daylight also appear optimal for breeding (mating and egg laying), but snails will breed in darkness.\n\nSnails can be bred in boxes or cages stacked several units high. An automatic sprinkler system can be used to provide moisture. Breeding cages need a feed trough and a water trough. Plastic trays a couple of inches deep are adequate; deeper water troughs increase the chance of snails drowning in them. Trays can be set on a bed of small gravel. Small plastic pots, e.g., flower pots about {{convert|3|in|cm}} deep, can be filled with sterilized dirt (or a loamy pH neutral soil) and set in the gravel to give the snails a place to lay their eggs. After the snails lay eggs each pot is replaced. (Set one pot inside another so that one can be easily lifted without shifting the gravel.)\n\nWhen the snails have laid their eggs, the pots are put in a nursery where the eggs will hatch. The young snails are kept in the nursery for about 6 weeks, and then moved to a separate pen, as young snails do best if kept with other snails of similar size. Eight hours of daylight is optimal for young snails.\n\nBaby snails are fed on tender [[lettuce]] leaves ([[Boston lettuce|Boston]] type, but [[head lettuce|head]] type is probably also good.)\n\nSome who raise ''H. aspersa'' separate the five stages: reproduction, hatching, young, fattening, and final fattening.\n\nIn a typical example, the [[Reproduction|breeding]] box has [[concrete]] sides, soil with [[earthworm]]s (to cleanse the soil) on the bottom, vegetation, curved tiles to provide shelter, feeders, and a chicken waterer. [[Mosquito]] netting or screening covers the top. These breeding boxes may be outside, or better results may be obtained when the boxes are inside a greenhouse\u2014as long as the greenhouse does not get too hot or too dry. One researcher reported that in outdoor boxes, each breeder snail had about seven young. In greenhouses, each breeder snail had about 9 to 12 young. The researcher felt that under better weather conditions than those he had that year, each adult breeder snail would have produced 15 young snails.\n\n[[Fattening pens]] can be outside or in a greenhouse. High summer temperatures and insufficient moisture cause dwarfing and malformations of some snails. This is more a problem inside greenhouses if the sun overheats the building. A sprinkler system (e.g., a [[horticultural]] system or common lawn sprinklers) can supply moisture. Make sure excess water can drain.\n\nFattening pens may contain {{convert|2|by|3|ft|m|adj=on}} pieces (or other convenient size) of heavy plastic sheets, hung from boards resting on a rack that lets the tips of the plastic sheets just touch the ground. The plastic sheets are about {{convert|4|in|cm}} apart. The sheets give the snails a resting and hiding place. Feeders may be located on the rack that supports the plastic sheets.\n\nA layer of coarse sand and [[topsoil]] with earthworms is placed on the fattening pen's bottom. The worms help clean up the snail droppings.\n\nSnails that hatched the previous summer can be put in a chilled room for hibernation over winter. About 1 April, (adjusted for local climate), they are moved to the final fattening pen. IN cases where there are several fattening pens, the smaller snails are placed in one, medium in another, large in another. One-third of a pound of ''H. aspersa'' snails require one square foot of pen. Snails lose weight when they estivate in summer, therefore some growers do not stock pens by weight but by count. For ''H. aspersa'', 10 to 12 snails per square foot is the maximum.\n\n=== Cannibalism by hatchlings ===\nThe first snails to hatch eat the shells of their eggs. This gives them calcium needed for their shells. They may then begin eating unhatched eggs. If the snail eggs are kept at the optimum temperature, {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} (for some varieties), and if none of the eggs lose moisture, most eggs will hatch within 1 to 3 days of each other. [[Cannibalism]] also will be low. If hatching extends over a longer period, cannibalism may increase. Some eggs eaten are eggs that were not fertile or did not develop properly, but sometimes, properly developing embryos might be eaten. A high density of \"clutches\" of egg masses increases the rate of cannibalism, as other nearby egg masses are more likely to be found and eaten. Snail egg has 12 to 20 times the protein of lettuce. The protein helps the baby snails start developing quickly and be healthier. Snail egg is an excellent starter food for newly hatched snails, but they tend to only eat eggs of their own species.\n\n=== Feeding ===\nFeeding season is April through October, (or may vary with the local climate), with a \"rest period\" during the summer. Do not place food in one small clump so that there is not enough room for all the snails to get to it. Snails eat solid food by [[rasping]] it away with their [[radula]]. Feeding activity depends on the weather, and snails may not necessarily feed every day. Evening irrigation in dry weather may encourage feeding since the moisture makes it easier for the snails to move about.\n\nPut the breeding snails in the breeding pens in April or early May. Feed until mid June when mating begins and the snails stop feeding. Snails resume eating after they lay eggs. Once snails have laid their eggs, the adult snails can be removed. This leaves more food and less crowding for the hatchlings.\n\nSnails of the same species collected from different regions may have different food preferences. Some foods that snails eat are: [[Alyssum]], fruit and leaves of [[apple]], [[apricot]], [[artichoke]] (a favorite), [[Aster (genus)|aster]], [[barley]], [[beans]], [[bindweed]], [[California boxwood]], almost any [[cabbage]] variety, [[camomile]], [[carnation]], [[carrot]], [[cauliflower]], [[celeriac]] (root celery), [[celery]], ripe [[cherries]], [[chive]], citrus, [[clover]], [[cucumber]]s (a favorite snail food), [[dandelion]], [[Elderberry|elder]], [[henbane]], [[hibiscus]], [[hollyhock]], [[kale]], larkspur ([[Consolida]] or [[Delphinium]] genera), [[leek]], lettuce (liked, and makes good snails), [[lily]], [[magnolia]], [[mountain ash]], [[mulberry]], [[chrysanthemum]], [[Tropaeolum|nasturtium]], [[Urtica|nettle]], [[nightshade]] berries, [[oats]], [[onion]] greens, [[pansy]], [[parsley]], [[peach]], ripe [[pear]]s, [[pea]]s, [[petunia]], [[phlox]], [[plum]], [[potato]]es (raw or cooked), [[pumpkin]]s, [[radish]], [[rapeseed|rape]], [[rose]], [[sorrel]], [[spinach]], [[sweet pea]], [[thistle]], [[tomato]]es (well liked), [[turnip]], [[wheat]], [[yarrow]], [[zinnia]]. They will eat sweet [[lupin]]es, but will reject bitter [[lupin]]es and other plants with high [[quinolizidine]] [[alkaloid]]s. Snails also avoid plants that produce other defensive chemicals, defensive stem hairs, etc.\n\nSnails usually prefer juicy leaves and vegetables over dry ones. If snails are fed vegetable trimmings, damaged fruit, and cooked potatoes, uneaten food must be promptly removed as it will quickly spoil. Bran may be supplied that is wet or sprinkled dry over leafy vegetables. The diet may consist of 20% [[wheat bran]] while 80% is fruit and vegetable material. Some growers use [[oats]], [[corn meal]], [[soybean meal]], or [[chicken]] mash. Laying mash provides calcium, as does crushed [[oyster]] shells. Snails also may eat materials such as cardboard (but do not purposely feed it to them); they can eat through shipping cartons and escape. Snails may sometimes eat, within a 24-hour period, food equal to 10%, and occasionally as much as 20%, of their [[body weight]]. Active snails deprived of food will lose more than one-third of their weight before they starve to death\u2014a process that takes 8 to 12 weeks. Estivating snails can survive much longer.\n\nSupply calcium at least once a week if it is not available in the soil. It should not contain harmful salts or be so alkaline as to burn the snails. Mix calcium with wet bran or mashed potatoes and serve on a pan; this will keep any leftover food from rotting on the ground.\n\nSome researchers use chicken mash for feed. A plastic pipe can be cut in half lengthwise to make two troughs which can be used as feeders for mash. Mix laying mash (used for egg-producing hens) into the feed to provide calcium for the snails' shells. Commercial chicken feeding mash is around 16% to 17% protein, from fish meal and meat meal, making it good for growing snails. Supplying mash to hatchlings might reduce cannibalism. Two feeds that snails like and that promote good growth are: (A) broiler finisher mash consisting of 7% broiler concentrate, 58% corn, 16% soya, 18% sorghum, 7% limestone flour (40% Ca); and (B) chicken feed (pellets) for layers consisting of 5% layer concentrate, 10%, corn, 15% soya, 20% sorghum, 44% barley, 6% limestone flour (40% Ca).\n\nPellets are fine for larger snails, but mash is better for younger ones. Pellets should be partially crushed if fed to young snails. Snails do not grow well if rabbit pellets are their primary diet. Snails show a distinct preference for moist feed. Easy access to enough water must be ensured if snails are fed dry mash.\n\nBe sure to frequently clean the feed and water dishes. The amount of feed a snail eats depends very much on air humidity and on the availability of drinking water. Clean drinking water can be served in a shallow container to reduce the risk of the snail drowning. Some types of chicken waterers may be suitable. Other factors (e.g., temperature, light intensity, food preferences versus food supplied, etc.) also affect feeding. A compromise, until the optimum feed is found, is to feed half green vegetable material and half chicken feed/grain/animal protein.\n\nYoung ''H. aspersa'' readily eats [[milk powder]]. Its rapid rate of assimilation promotes rapid growth.\n\n=== Diseases and pests ===\nGood hygiene can prevent the spread of disease and otherwise improve the health and growth rate of snails. Food is replaced daily in order to prevent spoilage. Earthworms added to the soil help keep the pen clean.\n\n[[Parasitism|Parasites]], [[nematode]]s, [[trematoda|trematodes]], [[fungi]], and micro[[arthropod]]s can attack snails, and such problems can spread rapidly when snail populations are dense. The bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' causes intestinal infections that can spread rapidly in a crowded snail pen.\n\nPossible predators include [[rat]]s, [[Mouse|mice]], [[Mole (animal)|moles]], [[skunk]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[bird]]s, [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s, [[lizard]]s, walking insects (e.g., some [[beetle]] and [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]] varieties), some types of [[Fly|flies]], [[centipede]]s, and even certain carnivorous snail species, such as ''[[Strangesta capillacea]]''.\n\n=== Population density ===\nPopulation density also affects successful snail production. Pens should contain no more than six to eight fair-sized snails per square foot, or about four large ''H. pomatias''; or figure one kilogram per square meter (about .2 pounds of snail per square foot), which automatically compensates for the size of the snails. To encourage breeding, best results will occur with not more than eight snails per square meter (0.8 per square foot). Some sources say that, for ''H. pomatia'' to breed, 2 to 4 snails per square meter (0.2 to 0.4 per square foot) is the maximum.\n\nSnails tend not to breed when packed too densely or when the [[wikt:slime|slime]] in the pen accumulates too much. The slime apparently works like a [[pheromone]] and suppresses reproduction. On the other hand, snails in groups of about 100 seem to breed better than when only a few snails are confined together. Perhaps they have more potential mates from which to choose. Snails in a densely populated area grow more slowly even when food is abundant, and they also have a higher mortality rate. These snails then become smaller adults who lay fewer clutches of eggs, have fewer eggs per clutch, and the eggs have a lower hatch rate. Smaller adult snails sell for less. [[Dwarfing]] is quite common in snail farming and is attributable mainly to rearing conditions rather than [[heredity]] factors. Crowding snails is false economy. A recommended rate for ''H. aspersa'' is not more than one-third pound per square foot (3.6&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of soil surface for snails that weigh more than 1&nbsp;gram and not more than 0.2 pound per square foot (2.2&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) for snails that weigh less. (One ounce is about 28&nbsp;grams.)\n\n== Turning snails into escargots ==\n{{Main|Escargot}}\nSnails are mature when a lip forms at the opening of their shell. Before they mature, their shells are more easily broken, making them undesirable. For ''H. aspersa'', commercial weight is 8&nbsp;grams or larger. The nutrient composition of raw snails (per 100&nbsp;grams of edible portion), according to information from the nutrient databank of France,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} is:\n* [[Food energy|Energy]]: 80.5 [[calorie|kcal]] (337 [[kilojoule|kJ]])\n* [[Water]]: 79 g\n* [[Protein]]: 16 g\n* Available [[carbohydrates]]: 2 g\n* [[Fiber]]: 0 g\n* [[Fat]]: 1 g\n* [[Magnesium]]: 250&nbsp;mg\n* [[Calcium]]: 170&nbsp;mg\n* [[Iron]]: 3.5&nbsp;mg\n* [[Vitamin C]]: 0&nbsp;mg\n\nSnail eggs are also harvested and processed to produce [[snail caviar]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2007-12-15-snail-caviar-the-new-gourmet-frontier |title=Snail caviar! The new gourmet frontier |newspaper=[[Mail & Guardian]] |date=December 15, 2007 |accessdate=21 January 2015 |author=Bertrand, Jordane}}</ref>\n\n== Restrictions and regulations ==\n\n=== United States ===\nThe same snails that some people raise or gather as food also are agricultural pests that cause considerable crop damage. Introduced slug and snail varieties tend to be worse pests than native species, probably due in part to the lack of natural controls. Snail pests attack crops ranging from leafy vegetables to fruits that grow near the ground, such as strawberries and tomatoes, to citrus fruits high up on trees.\n\nThe [[Federal Plant Pest Act]] defines a plant pest as \"any living stage (including active and dormant forms) of [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[slug]]s, [[snail]]s, [[protozoa]], or other [[invertebrate]] animals, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], other [[parasite|parasitic plants]] or reproductive parts thereof; viruses; or any organisms similar to or allied with any of the foregoing; or any [[infection|infectious]] substances, which can directly or indirectly injure or cause disease or damage in or to any plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured, or other products of plants...\" The [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS) categorizes giant African snails as a \"quarantine significant plant pest.\" The United States does not allow live giant African snails into the country under any circumstances. It is illegal to own or to possess them. APHIS vigorously enforces this regulation and destroys or returns these snails to their country of origin.\n\nSince large infestations of snails can do devastating damage, many states have quarantines against nursery products, and other products, from infested states. Further, it is illegal to import snails (or slugs) into the U.S. without permission from the [[Plant Protection and Quarantine Division]] (PPQ), [[Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service]], U.S. Department of Agriculture. APHIS also oversees interstate transportation of snails. Anyone who plans to \"import, release, or make interstate shipments of\" snails, must complete APHIS's PPQ Form 526, Application and Permit to Move Live Plant Pests and Noxious Weeds. This form should be submitted to the State regulatory official. The state will process the request and make a recommendation to APHIS who will then make a decision.\n\nInformation on Plant Pest Permits is available at APHIS's website [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm].\n\nThe [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates the canning of low-[[acid]] foods such as snails. According to FDA, \"establishments engaged in the manufacture of Low-acid or Acidified Canned Foods (LACF) offered for interstate commerce in the United States are required...to register their facility...and file scheduled processes for their products with\" the FDA. This does not refer to fresh products. For appropriate forms, contact: LACF Registration Coordinator, HFS-618, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 200 C Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20204. Telephone: (202) 205-5282. FAX: (202) 205-4758 or (202) 205-4128.\n\nImproper canning of low-acid meats, e.g., snails, involves a risk of [[botulism]]. When canning snails for home consumption, carefully follow canning instructions for low-acid meats to prevent food poisoning.\n\nState laws also may apply to imports into certain states and to raising snails in a given state. Some states may want to inspect and approve facilities. Thus anyone who plans to raise snails also should check with their State's Agriculture Department.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n* Rebecca Thompson and Sheldon Cheney [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm '''Raising Snails'''] \"[[National Agricultural Library]], [[Agricultural Research Service]], [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].\"\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm |date=June 8, 2004 |title=Source of this article in Russian }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060711074205/http://bursaagricola.ro/Info-CRESTEREA_MELCILOR-4-23640-1.html Source of this article in] Romanian\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080728004505/http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/NAP/00-188.htm Breeding and Growing Snails Commercially in Australia]\n* [http://escargot.free.fr/eng/index.html Escargot Passion]\n* [https://rirdc.infoservices.com.au/items/06-104 Free-range Snail Farming in Australia] Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, Australian government\n* [http://www.manandmollusc.net/molluscan_food_files/molluscan_food_terrestrial.html Man and Mollusc's Data Base of Edible Molluscs]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080416174658/http://www.sdnetwork.kabissa.org/newscollection/ideanews_1.htm#GrowSnail Snail Farming in Africa]\n* [http://www.snailcream.co.uk/heliculture/ Snail Farming (Heliculture)]\n* [http://africabusinessclassroom.com/snail-farming-in-nigeria-how-to-start-make-money/  Snail Farming in Nigeria]\n\n{{Edible molluscs}}\n\n[[Category:Agriculture]]\n[[Category:Gastropods and humans]]\n", "name_user": "Chescargot", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliciculture"}
