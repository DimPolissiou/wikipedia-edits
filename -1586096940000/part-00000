Being [[Magadha Empire]] village, Kutri has witnessed [[vedic]] education and judiciary system in the ancient times. [[Nalanda University]] - an educational hub of India is situated near Kutri village. During the [[British Raj]], School education was initiated in this village with the establishment of Middle School Kutri in the north of the village in the 1900s. Late Siya Saran Singh \u2013 a teacher of Kochgaon village played a pivotal role in proliferating education in Kutri. With the support of Harvansh Kumari alias (Parvati Kumari) a primary school of 3 rooms was constructed during [[Zamindari]] system. Later on, with awareness of  educational and its importance, school was extended to Middle school up to class 7. After [[Indian independence]], Kutri villagers used to go nearby school for high school education i.e. BK Sahoo High School at [[Warisaliganj]]. In the 1970s there were urgent need felt by villagers to improve educational institution in the village for higher secondary education and it was finally decided in Oct 1972 during [[Durga Puja]] Festival that a high school is urgently needed in the proximity of the village. This need was further strengthened with demand of  improving literacy and education among girls. For girls, it was difficult to get higher education due to unavailability of high school in near by locations. At that time, President Late Bhishundeo Singh, Secretary Late Girijanandan Sharma, Treasurer Late Sunder Sharma, Auditor Parasnath Singh formed a committee with some nominated members Such as Sh. Umesh Chandra Sinha, Sh. Ram Lakhan Sharma, Sh. Kushewshar Singh, Late Bharat Singh, Late Rajpati Singh, Late Ramchandra Singh (Chaubhaiya) became active members for high school establishment. The role of president and secretary were immense to get land for the School and subscription or donation amount was offered by all members and many villagers. Considering education an urgent need, members of Natya Kala Parishad, Kutri initiated school foundation for higher education in the south of the village and a foundation stone of  high school was kept by the first district Magistrate of Nawada Shri Narendra Pal Singh on 5th Feb 1973 on the eve of Saraswati Puja. Surprisingly, 5th Feb was the birthday of Sh. Narendrapal Singh (then DM) and when invitation for foundation stone of school was given by Sh. Ram Lakhan Sharma, he accepted this request happily and was ready to support this noble work in all the way. Late Kushewshar Singh became the first Headmaster of Kutri high school and some unemployed villagers at that time used to teach there. Successor headmaster late Ram Naresh Singh put great effort to get uphill task of permanent high school approval from the government authority. In doing so Late Bandi Shankar Singh ([[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]], [[Warisaliganj]]), the son of first Chief minister of [[Bihar]] supported very well. In Dec. 1978, Kutri High school became govt approved high school now it is inter high school (10+2). Apart from, this, there was some coaching classes was run privately to bring better education in the village.  The unforgettable name of Late Haridwar Singh was one of them who privately run coaching cum school at late Shyam nandan Pathak banglow. He was very disciplined teacher and kept strong foundation of English literature and Mathematics in the students.  At present there is one middle school and one inter high school in the village where students from nearby villages even from Naromurar, Gorapar, Lohrajpur, Paingari etc. are coming for the education along with our village students. Thus we can say, that our forefathers had strategic vision towards education. At present, there is a middle and high school in Kutri named Middle School and High School, Kutri located in northern and southern part of village respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bseidc.in/secondary_school.php |title= Higher Secondary School List SL.

Once again in the 2020s villagers who are in the job and business but out of village at present once again felt the need of the education, and thought that talent is everywhere and we need to up bring them through motivation and creating quiz and competition classes amongst students to nourish them self dependant citizen of the country. In this direction, a [[WhatsApp]] group i.e. Kutri Residents Group initiated spread of education thought with the support of Maa kali Sewa Sansthan Kutri (Maa Kali Sewa Siksha Sansthan) and conducted [[Quiz]] competition amongst student of different classes to bring competition  amongst students and to understand importance of education under the shadow of Mr. Rupesh Kumar, Umakant, Anjani Kumar, Daya Shankar  who dedicated himself as educationists and motivators from their busy schedule to make it successful. From WhatsApp group, Dr. Amit Kumar. Rakesh Kumar, Mukesh Kumar Singh, Rupesh Kumar, Umakant, Prof. Baliram, sanjeev, Sonu etc took lead to move forward this education awareness under the supervision of Maa Kali Sewa Sanstahan President Shri Ram Avtar Sharma, Secretary, Shri Ram Lakhan Sharma and Treasurer Shri Rajendra Singh. Some of the villagers also contributed financially to support this initiative. MAA KALI SEWA SANSTHAN took active participation in opening saving account and contributed morally as well as financially to uplift poor students.\n\n[[File:QUIZ PRIZE DISTRIBUTION UNDER MAA KALI SEWA SANSTHAN.jpg|center|Quiz prize distribution under Maa Kali Sewa Sansthan]]\n\n[[File:Students & villagers at quiz prize Ceromony.jpg|center|Students and villagers at quiz prize ceremony]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Villages in Bihar]] \n* [[Nawada District]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web|url=http://nawada.nic.in |title=Official District Website |publisher= |date= |accessdate=}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Nawada district]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|{{copy edit|date=March 2020}}{{original research|date=March 2020}}}}\n\n{{Cleanup|reason=reorganise image|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    =Kutri \n| other_name              = \u0915\u0941\u091f\u0930\u0940\n| settlement_type         = Village \n| pushpin_map             = India Bihar#India\n| pushpin_label_position  = left\n| subdivision_type        = Country\n| subdivision_name        = {{flag|India}}\n| subdivision_type1       = [[States and territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Bihar]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[List of regions of India|Region]]\n| subdivision_type3       = [[List of districts of India|District]]\n| subdivision_name3       = [[Nawada district|Nawada]]\n| government_type         = [[Panchayati raj (India)]]\n| governing_body          = [[Gram panchayat]] \n| pushpin_map_caption     = Location in Bihar, India\n| coordinates             = {{coord|25.023060|N|85.602250|E|display=inline,title}}\n| population_total        = 5445<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/1035_PART_B_DCHB_NAWADA.pdf |title= Nawada District Census Handbook Page No. 3 for Population and Page No. 76 for Village Code |publisher= |date= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n| population_as_of        = 2011\n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| demographics_type1      = Languages\n| demographics1_title1    = Official\n| demographics1_info1     = [[Hindi language|Hindi]]\n| timezone1               = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1             = +5:30\n| postal_code_type        = Postal Index Number \n| postal_code             = 805130<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nawada.nic.in/std-pin-codes/ |title= Postal Code (PIN) and STD Code |publisher= |date= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n| area_code_type          = Telephone code\n| area_code               = 06325<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nawada.nic.in/std-pin-codes/ |title= Postal Code (PIN) and STD Code |publisher= |date= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n| registration_plate      = BR-27-XXXX\n| website                 = {{URL|nawada.nic.in}}\n| footnotes               = \n}}\n[[Kutri]] Village with Census of [[India]] Village-code 257586 is located in [[Warisaliganj]] Block of [[Nawada district]] in [[Bihar]], [[India]].

Being [[Magadha Empire]] village, Kutri has witnessed [[vedic]] education and judiciary system in the ancient times. [[Nalanda University]] - an educational hub of India is situated near Kutri village. During the [[British Raj]], School education was initiated in this village with the establishment of Middle School Kutri in the north of the village in the 1900s. Late Siya Saran Singh \u2013 a teacher of Kochgaon village played a pivotal role in proliferating education in Kutri. With the support of Harvansh Kumari alias (Parvati Kumari) a primary school of 3 rooms was constructed during [[Zamindari]] system. Later on, with awareness of  educational and its importance, school was extended to Middle school up to class 7. After [[Indian independence]], Kutri villagers used to go nearby school for high school education i.e. BK Sahoo High School at [[Warisaliganj]]. In the 1970s there were urgent need felt by villagers to improve educational institution in the village for higher secondary education and it was finally decided in Oct 1972 during [[Durga Puja]] Festival that a high school is urgently needed in the proximity of the village. This need was further strengthened with demand of  improving literacy and education among girls. For girls, it was difficult to get higher education due to unavailability of high school in near by locations. At that time, President Late Bhishundeo Singh, Secretary Late Girijanandan Sharma, Treasurer Late Sunder Sharma, Auditor Parasnath Singh formed a committee with some nominated members Such as Sh. Umesh Chandra Sinha, Sh. Ram Lakhan Sharma, Sh. Kushewshar Singh, Late Bharat Singh, Late Rajpati Singh, Late Ramchandra Singh (Chaubhaiya) became active members for high school establishment. The role of president and secretary were immense to get land for the School and subscription or donation amount was offered by all members and many villagers. Considering education an urgent need, members of Natya Kala Parishad, Kutri initiated school foundation for higher education in the south of the village and a foundation stone of  high school was kept by the first district Magistrate of Nawada Shri Narendra Pal Singh on 5th Feb 1973 on the eve of Saraswati Puja. Surprisingly, 5th Feb was the birthday of Sh. Narendrapal Singh (then DM) and when invitation for foundation stone of school was given by Sh. Ram Lakhan Sharma, he accepted this request happily and was ready to support this noble work in all the way. Late Kushewshar Singh became the first Headmaster of Kutri high school and some unemployed villagers at that time used to teach there. Successor headmaster late Ram Naresh Singh put great effort to get uphill task of permanent high school approval from the government authority. In doing so Late Bandi Shankar Singh ([[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]], [[Warisaliganj]]), the son of first Chief minister of [[Bihar]] supported very well. In Dec. 1978, Kutri High school became govt approved high school now it is inter high school (10+2). Apart from, this, there was some coaching classes was run privately to bring better education in the village.  The unforgettable name of Late Haridwar Singh was one of them who privately run coaching cum school at late Shyam nandan Pathak banglow. He was very disciplined teacher and kept strong foundation of English literature and Mathematics in the students.  At present there is one middle school and one inter high school in the village where students from nearby villages even from Naromurar, Gorapar, Lohrajpur, Paingari etc. are coming for the education along with our village students. Thus we can say, that our forefathers had strategic vision towards education. At present, there is a middle and high school in Kutri named Middle School and High School, Kutri located in northern and southern part of village respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bseidc.in/secondary_school.php |title= Higher Secondary School List SL.

Once again in the 2020s villagers who are in the job and business but out of village at present once again felt the need of the education, and thought that talent is everywhere and we need to up bring them through motivation and creating quiz and competition classes amongst students to nourish them self dependant citizen of the country. In this direction, a [[WhatsApp]] group i.e. Kutri Residents Group initiated spread of education thought with the support of Maa kali Sewa Sansthan Kutri (Maa Kali Sewa Siksha Sansthan) and conducted [[Quiz]] competition amongst student of different classes to bring competition  amongst students and to understand importance of education under the shadow of Mr. Rupesh Kumar, Umakant, Anjani Kumar, Daya Shankar  who dedicated himself as educationists and motivators from their busy schedule to make it successful. From WhatsApp group, Dr. Amit Kumar. Rakesh Kumar, Mukesh Kumar Singh, Rupesh Kumar, Umakant, Prof. Baliram, sanjeev, Sonu etc took lead to move forward this education awareness under the supervision of Maa Kali Sewa Sanstahan President Shri Ram Avtar Sharma, Secretary, Shri Ram Lakhan Sharma and Treasurer Shri Rajendra Singh. Some of the villagers also contributed financially to support this initiative. MAA KALI SEWA SANSTHAN took active participation in opening saving account and contributed morally as well as financially to uplift poor students.\n\n[[File:QUIZ PRIZE DISTRIBUTION UNDER MAA KALI SEWA SANSTHAN.jpg|center|Quiz prize distribution under Maa Kali Sewa Sansthan]]\n\n[[File:Students & villagers at quiz prize Ceromony.jpg|center|Students and villagers at quiz prize ceremony]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Villages in Bihar]] \n* [[Nawada District]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web|url=http://nawada.nic.in |title=Official District Website |publisher= |date= |accessdate=}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Nawada district]]\n", "name_user": "Llunnaz", "label": "safe", "comment": "grammar", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutri"}

{"title_page": "Piperi (tribe)", "text_new": "'''Piperi''' ([[Serbo-Croatian|Montenegrin/Serbian Cyrillic]]: \u041f\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438) is a historical [[Tribes of Montenegro|tribe]] (''pleme'') and region in northeastern [[Montenegro]]. Piperi is located between the [[Mora\u010da river|Mora\u010da]] and [[Zeta River|Zeta]] rivers up to the northern suburbs of the Montenegrin capital [[Podgorica]].\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nOral traditions and fragmentary stories were collected by writers, who travelled in the region, about the early history of Piperi. An interdisciplinary and comparative approach of those stories with recorded historical material has yielded more historically-grounded accounts in 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n[[Johann Georg von Hahn]] recorded oral tradition about Piperi's origins in the mid 19th century. The same oral tradition with minor variations is preserved in other communities of the region. According to it the first direct male ancestor of the Triepshi was ''Ban Keqi'' son of ''Keq'', a Catholic Albanian who was fled from Ottoman conquest and settled in a Slavic-speaking area that would become the historical Piperi region. ''Laz\u00ebr Keqi'' (ancestor of [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti)]]), ''Ban Keqi'' (ancestor of Triepshi), ''[[Mrkojevici|Merkota Keqi]], Kaster Keqi'' (ancestor of [[Krasniqi]]) and ''Vas Keqi'' (ancestor of [[Vasojevi\u0107i]]) had to abandon the village after committing murder against the locals, but ''Keq'' and his younger son ''Piper Keqi'' remained there and ''Piper Keqi'' became the direct ancestor of the Piperi tribe.{{sfn|Hahn|2015|p=125-35}} The name of the first ancestor, ''Keq'', which means ''bad'' in Albanian, is given in [[Mal\u00ebsia]] to only children or to children from families with very few children (due to infant mortality). In those families, an \"ugly\" name (''i \u00e7udun'') was given as a spoken talisman to protect the child from the \"[[evil eye]].{{sfn|Shkurtaj|2009|p=390}}\n\nHistorical research has shown that Piperi is not a tribe (''pleme'') of common patrilineal ancestry.{{sfn|Zlatar|1990|p=55}} It formed in the period between the mid 15th century and the 16th century by communities that settled in different periods in Piperi, where they also found an already settled population. Piperi appears in the defter of the [[Sanjak of Scutari]] in 1485 and in 1497. The population of Piperi more than doubled from 167 to 347 households from 1485 to 1497. 121 of those households were of unmarried men and 38 of widows. This indicates that many of the newcomers were refugees from areas conquered in Montenegro and northern Albania. In the supplementary defter of 1497, there are several kin groups in the region of Piperi, which appears as a distinct [[nahiya]] divided in three [[timar]]s under local Christian Ottoman [[spahi]]s.<ref name=\"Pulaha\"/> Many communities of the villages of Piperi were categorized as ''already settled'' or ''newcomers'' from other areas.

Piperi is located between the [[Mora\u010da river|Mora\u010da]] and [[Zeta River|Zeta]] rivers up to the northern suburbs of the Montenegrin capital [[Podgorica]].\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nOral traditions and fragmentary stories were collected by writers, who travelled in the region, about the early history of Piperi. An interdisciplinary and comparative approach of those stories with recorded historical material has yielded more historically-grounded accounts in 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n[[Johann Georg von Hahn]] recorded oral tradition about Piperi's origins in the mid 19th century. The same oral tradition with minor variations is preserved in other communities of the region. According to it the first direct male ancestor of the Triepshi was ''Ban Keqi'' son of ''Keq'', a Catholic Albanian who was fled from Ottoman conquest and settled in a Slavic-speaking area that would become the historical Piperi region. ''Laz\u00ebr Keqi'' (ancestor of [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti)]]), ''Ban Keqi'' (ancestor of Triepshi), ''[[Mrkojevici|Merkota Keqi]], Kaster Keqi'' (ancestor of [[Krasniqi]]) and ''Vas Keqi'' (ancestor of [[Vasojevi\u0107i]]) had to abandon the village after committing murder against the locals, but ''Keq'' and his younger son ''Piper Keqi'' remained there and ''Piper Keqi'' became the direct ancestor of the [[Piperi (tribe)|Piperi]] tribe.{{sfn|Hahn|2015|p=125-35}} The name of the first ancestor, ''Keq'', which means ''bad'' in Albanian, is given in [[Mal\u00ebsia]] to only children or to children from families with very few children (due to infant mortality). In those families, an \"ugly\" name (''i \u00e7udun'') was given as a spoken talisman to protect the child from the \"[[evil eye]].{{sfn|Shkurtaj|2009|p=390}}\n\nHistorical research has shown that Piperi is not a tribe (''pleme'') of common patrilineal ancestry.{{sfn|Zlatar|1990|p=55}} It formed in the period between the mid 15th century and the 16th century by communities that settled in different periods in Piperi, where they also found an already settled population. Piperi appears in the defter of the [[Sanjak of Scutari]] in 1485 and in 1497. The population of Piperi more than doubled from 167 to 347 households from 1485 to 1497. 121 of those households were of unmarried men and 38 of widows. This indicates that many of the newcomers were refugees from areas conquered in Montenegro and northern Albania. In the supplementary defter of 1497, there are several kin groups in the region of Piperi, which appears as a distinct [[nahiya]] divided in three [[timar]]s under local Christian Ottoman [[spahi]]s.<ref name=\"Pulaha\"/> Many communities of the villages of Piperi were categorized as ''already settled'' or ''newcomers'' from other areas. In the villages, the communities formed clusters of households according to their kinship tries. This separation of settlements by kinship persisted even in the early 20th century. The villages of Piperi in 1497 were Luskozhupa, Drezka,  Strahalic, Belica, Moracica, Dug, Mirasnica, Dobrico, Radushev do, Brestica, Dirnovica, Merka.

They ask him to tell his story and he does.\n\nBalu is always top-ranked in his college. Mahalakshmi ([[Tamannaah]]), his cousin comes to Balu\u2019s house to continue her studies. She is in awe of her Mr. Perfect 'Bava' as she expresses this after seeing him. Upon seeing Mahalakshmi Balu asks for her name to which she responds as ''Veera Venkata Satya Sai Naga Durga Sesha Avathara Seetha Mahalakshmi,'' Balu says her name is too long and he can't waste that much memory just to remember her name so she says that he will just call her Mahalakshmi. Mahalakshmi takes her first exam and walks out crying as she doesn't understand English, Balu helps her, and she gets the first rank and Balu gets second. Balu is hurt by this as he usually gets first rank, and he plans to sabotage her studies, Mahalakshmi does the same. But to their surprise Ajith (Anand Krishna Nandu) stands first this time. Meanwhile, Mahalakshmi's father brings her a marriage proposal, but she doesn\u2019t want to marry him. Balu and Mahalakshmi compromise by agreeing to help each other. Balu helps her in getting the proposal canceled and Mahalakshmi distracts Ajith from studies for the sake of Balu, but Balu gets attracted to her. The couple start studying together and Mahalakshmi distracts Ajith. Balu gets first rank and is awarded a building from his principal, at the housewarming party, Mahalakshmi says Ajith is great as he studied well even though Mahalakshmi distracted him. Balu is hurt by this statement because he doesn't want Mahalakshmi to think anyone is better than him, his ego is also hurt and the couple chooses to separate.\n\nAfter three years, they meet again in the hospital because their grandmother suddenly falls ill. While trying to find out how Balu is doing, Mahalakshmi realizes he hasn't changed at all. Both argue a lot until their parents try to get them married. Surprisingly, Balu mentions that he has a girlfriend named Swapna that he hopes to marry. While introducing her to his family, Mahalakshmi notices that Swapna is much more than she is. To get back at Balu, she agrees to marry Ajith, Balu's former rival in college. Ajith turns out to be the head of a company that makes more than Balu's company. Balu, angry that Ajith is greater than he is, puts his company in risk in hopes that he can surpass Ajith's company. Unfortunately, his partner cheats him, and Balu is on the verge of losing his company. Mahalakshmi, now his project manager, toils to rescue him. They make an excellent team and Balu's company is saved.\n\nIn an after party, Balu credits Mahalakshmi for his success. She again unknowingly hurts Balu's ego. This time, Balu confesses that he felt the need to be great in Mahalakshmi's eyes because he loved her. When she tells him she shares his feelings, Balu refuses to believe her. After the interference of their grandfather, they are united in the end.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Naga Chaitanya]] as ''Veera Bahu Sathya Dharma Shiva Shankhara Rama Balu Mahendra'' alias Balu\n*[[Tamannaah Bhatia|Tamannaah]] as ''Veera Venkata Satya Sai Naga Durga Sesha Avathara Seetha Mahalakshmi'' alias Mahalakshmi\n*[[Tara Alisha Berry]] as Swapna\n*Ananda Krishna Nandu as Ajith Jogi\n*Ishree Giridhar as Mahalaksmi's father\n*[[Naresh (actor)|Naresh]] as Ramesh (Balu's father)\n*[[K.

They ask him to tell his story and he does.\n\nBalu is always top-ranked in his college. Mahalakshmi ([[Tamannaah]]), his cousin comes to Balu\u2019s house to continue her studies. She is in awe of her Mr. Perfect 'Bava' as she expresses this after seeing him. Upon seeing Mahalakshmi Balu asks for her name to which she responds as ''Veera Venkata Satya Sai Naga Durga Sesha Avathara Seetha Mahalakshmi,'' Balu says her name is too long and he can't waste that much memory just to remember her name so she says that he will just call her Mahalakshmi. Mahalakshmi takes her first exam and walks out crying as she doesn't understand English, Balu helps her, and she gets the first rank and Balu gets second. Balu is hurt by this as he usually gets first rank, and he plans to sabotage her studies, Mahalakshmi does the same. But to their surprise Ajith (Anand Krishna Nandu) stands first this time. Meanwhile, Mahalakshmi's father brings her a marriage proposal, but she doesn\u2019t want to marry him. Balu and Mahalakshmi compromise by agreeing to help each other. Balu helps her in getting the proposal canceled and Mahalakshmi distracts Ajith from studies for the sake of Balu, but Balu gets attracted to her. The couple start studying together and Mahalakshmi distracts Ajith. Balu gets first rank and is awarded a building from his principal, at the housewarming party, Mahalakshmi says Ajith is great as he studied well even though Mahalakshmi distracted him. Balu is hurt by this statement because he doesn't want Mahalakshmi to think anyone is better than him, his ego is also hurt and the couple chooses to separate.\n\nAfter three years, they meet again in the hospital because their grandmother suddenly falls ill. While trying to find out how Balu is doing, Mahalakshmi realizes he hasn't changed at all. Both argue a lot until their parents try to get them married. Surprisingly, Balu mentions that he has a girlfriend named Swapna that he hopes to marry. While introducing her to his family, Mahalakshmi notices that Swapna is much more than she is. To get back at Balu, she agrees to get married to Ajith, Balu's former rival in college. Ajith turns out to be the head of a company that makes more than Balu's company. Balu, angry that Ajith is greater than he is, puts his company in risk in hopes that he can surpass Ajith's company. Unfortunately, his partner cheats him, and Balu is on the verge of losing his company. Mahalakshmi, now his project manager, toils to rescue him. They make an excellent team and Balu's company is saved.\n\nIn an after party, Balu credits Mahalakshmi for his success. She again unknowingly hurts Balu's ego. This time, Balu confesses that he felt the need to be great in Mahalakshmi's eyes because he loved her. When she tells him she shares his feelings, Balu refuses to believe her. After the interference of their grandfather, they are united in the end.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Naga Chaitanya]] as ''Veera Bahu Sathya Dharma Shiva Shankhara Rama Balu Mahendra'' alias Balu\n*[[Tamannaah Bhatia|Tamannaah]] as ''Veera Venkata Satya Sai Naga Durga Sesha Avathara Seetha Mahalakshmi'' alias Mahalakshmi\n*[[Tara Alisha Berry]] as Swapna\n*Ananda Krishna Nandu as Ajith Jogi\n*Ishree Giridhar as Mahalaksmi's father\n*[[Naresh (actor)|Naresh]] as Ramesh (Balu's father)\n*[[K.

It is one of two [[Major party|major parties]] in the [[bicameral]] [[Parliament of South Australia]], the other being the [[Liberal Party of Australia (South Australian Division)|Liberal Party of Australia (SA Division)]].\n\nSince the [[1970 South Australian state election|1970 election]], marking the beginning of democratic [[proportional representation]] ([[one vote, one value]]) and ending decades of pro-rural electoral [[malapportionment]] known as the [[Playmander]], Labor have won 11 of the 15 elections. Spanning 16 years and 4 terms, Labor was last in government from the [[2002 South Australian state election|2002 election]] until the [[2018 South Australian state election|2018 election]]. [[Jay Weatherill]] led the Labor government since a 2011 leadership change from [[Mike Rann]]. During 2013 it became the longest-serving state Labor government in South Australian history, and in addition went on to win a fourth four-year term at the [[2014 South Australian state election|2014 election]].\n\nLabor's most notable historic Premiers of South Australia include [[Thomas Price (South Australian politician)|Thomas Price]] in the 1900s, [[Don Dunstan]] in the 1970s and [[John Bannon]] in the 1980s.\n\n==Formation==\n[[Image:SAULP1893.jpeg|left|thumb|ULP parliamentarians following the [[1893 South Australian state election|1893 colonial election]].]]\nA [[United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia|United Trades and Labor Council]] meeting with the purpose of creating an elections committee was convened on 12 December 1890, and held on 7 January 1891. The elections committee was formed, officially named the ''United Labor Party of South Australia'' (unlike state Labor, prior to 1912 their federal counterparts included the 'u' in their spelling of Labour) with [[John McPherson]] the founding secretary. Four months later, Labor enjoyed immediate success, electing [[David Charleston]], [[Robert Guthrie (Australian politician)|Robert Guthrie]] and [[Andrew Kirkpatrick (Australian politician)|Andrew Kirkpatrick]] to the [[South Australian Legislative Council]]. A week later, [[Richard Hooper (Australian politician)|Richard Hooper]] won the [[1891 Wallaroo by-election]] as an [[Independent politician|Independent]] Labor member in the [[South Australian House of Assembly]]. McPherson won the [[1892 East Adelaide by-election]] on 23 January, becoming the first official Labor leader and member of the House of Assembly.\n\nPrior to party creation, South Australian politics had lacked parties or solid groupings, although loose [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Conservatism|conservative]] blocs had begun to develop by the end of the 1880s. The [[1893 South Australian colonial election|1893 election]] was the first general election Labor would stand at, resulting in liberal and conservative leaning MPs beginning to divide, additionally with unidentified groupings and independents, as well as the subsequent formation of the staunchly anti-Labor [[National Defence League]]. The voluntary turnout rate increased from 53 to 68 percent, with Labor on 19 percent of the vote, and 10 Labor candidates including McPherson and Hooper were elected to the 54-member House of Assembly which gave Labor the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]].

Kingston served as Premier for a then-record of six and a half years, usually implementing legislation with Labor support.\n\n[[Thomas Price (South Australian politician)|Thomas Price]] formed the state's first Labor [[minority government]] and the world's first stable [[List of Labour Parties|Labor Party]] government at the [[1905 South Australian state election|1905 election]] with the support of several non-Labor MPs to form the [[Price-Peake administration]], which was re-elected at the [[1906 South Australian state election|1906 double dissolution election]], with Labor falling just two seats short of a majority.

During 2013 it became the longest-serving state Labor government in South Australian history, and in addition went on to win a fourth four-year term at the [[2014 South Australian state election|2014 election]].\n\nLabor's most notable historic Premiers of South Australia include [[Thomas Price (South Australian politician)|Thomas Price]] in the 1900s, [[Don Dunstan]] in the 1970s and [[John Bannon]] in the 1980s.\n\n==Formation==\n[[Image:SAULP1893.jpeg|left|thumb|ULP parliamentarians following the [[1893 South Australian state election|1893 colonial election]].]]\nA [[United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia|United Trades and Labor Council]] meeting with the purpose of creating an elections committee was convened on 12 December 1890, and held on 7 January 1891. The elections committee was formed, officially named the ''United Labor Party of South Australia'' (unlike state Labor, prior to 1912 their federal counterparts included the 'u' in their spelling of Labour) with [[John McPherson]] the founding secretary. Four months later, Labor enjoyed immediate success, electing [[David Charleston]], [[Robert Guthrie (Australian politician)|Robert Guthrie]] and [[Andrew Kirkpatrick (Australian politician)|Andrew Kirkpatrick]] to the [[South Australian Legislative Council]]. A week later, [[Richard Hooper (Australian politician)|Richard Hooper]] won the [[1891 Wallaroo by-election]] as an [[Independent politician|Independent]] Labor member in the [[South Australian House of Assembly]]. McPherson won the [[1892 East Adelaide by-election]] on 23 January, becoming the first official Labor leader and member of the House of Assembly.\n\nPrior to party creation, South Australian politics had lacked parties or solid groupings, although loose [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Conservatism|conservative]] blocs had begun to develop by the end of the 1880s. The [[1893 South Australian colonial election|1893 election]] was the first general election Labor would stand at, resulting in liberal and conservative leaning MPs beginning to divide, additionally with unidentified groupings and independents, as well as the subsequent formation of the staunchly anti-Labor [[National Defence League]]. The voluntary turnout rate increased from 53 to 68 percent, with Labor on 19 percent of the vote, and 10 Labor candidates including McPherson and Hooper were elected to the 54-member House of Assembly which gave Labor the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]]. The [[Charles Kingston|Kingston]] liberal government was formed with the support of Labor, ousting the [[John Downer|Downer]] conservative government. Kingston served as Premier for a then-record of six and a half years, usually implementing legislation with Labor support.\n\n[[Thomas Price (South Australian politician)|Thomas Price]] formed the state's first Labor [[minority government]] and the world's first stable [[List of Labour Parties|Labor Party]] government at the [[1905 South Australian state election|1905 election]] with the support of several non-Labor MPs to form the [[Price-Peake administration]], which was re-elected at the [[1906 South Australian state election|1906 double dissolution election]], with Labor falling just two seats short of a majority. So successful, [[John Verran]] led Labor to form the state's first of many [[majority government]]s at the [[1910 South Australian state election|1910 election]], just two weeks after the [[1910 Australian federal election|1910 federal election]] where their federal counterparts formed Australia's first elected majority in either house in the [[Parliament of Australia]], the world's first Labor Party majority government at a national level, and after the 1904 [[Chris Watson]] minority government the world's second Labor Party government at a national level.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ecsa.sa.gov.au/publications?view=document&id=480 |title=History of South Australian elections 1857-2006, volume 1 - ECSA |access-date=5 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302093736/http://www.ecsa.sa.gov.au/publications?view=document&id=480 |archive-date=2 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9N87xauZghkC&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=%22united+labor+party%22+south+australia+mcpherson&source=web&ots=E_xpRBG1o7&sig=LR9rzQwYgi2VnG0WMba98X-Vuo4&hl=en Sound of Trumpets: History of the Labour Movement in South Australia - By Jim Moss]</ref><ref>[http://klarbooks.com/academic/labcris.html Why did a 'labour movement' emerge in South Australia in the 1880s? - By Nicholas Klar]</ref>\n\nKnown as the United Labor Party of South Australia until 1917, the Australian Labor Party at both a state/colony and federal level pre-dates, among others, both the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] and the [[New Zealand Labour Party]] in party formation, government, and policy implementation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://australianpolitics.com/political-parties/alp|title=Australian Labor Party|website=AustralianPolitics.com|date=6 October 2013|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Premiers==\n{{Infobox Political post\n|post              = Parliamentary Party Leader\n|image             = Peter Malinauskas.jpg\n|incumbent         = [[Peter Malinauskas]]\n|incumbentsince    = 9 April 2018\n|deputy = [[Susan Close]]\n|inaugural         = [[John McPherson]]}}\nThirteen of the nineteen parliamentary Labor leaders have served as [[Premier of South Australia]]: [[Thomas Price (South Australian politician)|Thomas Price]] (1905\u20131909), [[John Verran]] (1910\u20131912), [[Crawford Vaughan]] (1915\u20131917), [[John Gunn (Australian politician)|John Gunn]] (1924\u20131926), [[Lionel Hill]] (1926\u20131927 and 1930\u20131931; expelled from party but continued as Premier until 1933), [[Frank Walsh]] (1965\u20131967), [[Don Dunstan]] (1967\u20131968 and 1970\u20131979), [[Des Corcoran]] (1979), [[John Bannon]] (1982\u20131992), [[Lynn Arnold]] (1992\u20131993), [[Mike Rann]] (2002\u20132011) and [[Jay Weatherill]] (2011\u20132018).
