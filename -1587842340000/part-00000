These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\".<ref name=thesis/> It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children.<ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Their project to publish drawings and testimonies of children in war received the support of [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Romain Rolland]] who \"regarded this collection as of considerable educational, historical and human interest.\"<ref name=\"Yannick Ripa\"/>\n \nIn 1939, Alfred Brauner welcomed 130 Jewish children from the Palatinate, Berlin and Austria,<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> survivors of the [[Kristallnacht]] at La Guette, a French castle owned by the Rothschild family and made available by [[Baroness Germaine de Rothschild]].<ref name=\"La Guette\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.ajpn.org/sauvetage-Chateau-de-la-Guette-245.html |title= Ch\u00e2teau de la Guette durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale (WWII) |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= www.ajpn.org/index.php | publisher= }}</ref><ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Lochy  | first1 = Emilie | authorlink = | title = Extrait de l'ouvrage : Enfances en guerre - T\u00e9moignages d'enfants sur la guerre | doi = | journal = Le Cercle Psy | volume = 12  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2014 | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Brauner\u2019s intention was to analyze the problems posed in working with children traumatized by their experiences and by separation from their families, with the aim of adapting them to a new life and preparing them for integration into France.<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> Some of the children had lost their parents;

These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\".<ref name=thesis/> It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children.<ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Their project to publish drawings and testimonies of children in war received the support of [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Romain Rolland]] who \"regarded this collection as of considerable educational, historical and human interest.\"<ref name=\"Yannick Ripa\"/>\n \nIn 1939, Alfred Brauner welcomed 130 Jewish children from the Palatinate, Berlin and Austria,<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> survivors of the [[Kristallnacht]] at La Guette, a French castle owned by the Rothschild family and made available by [[Baroness Germaine de Rothschild]].<ref name=\"La Guette\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.ajpn.org/sauvetage-Chateau-de-la-Guette-245.html |title= Ch\u00e2teau de la Guette durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale (WWII) |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= www.ajpn.org/index.php | publisher= }}</ref><ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Lochy  | first1 = Emilie | authorlink = | title = Extrait de l'ouvrage : Enfances en guerre - T\u00e9moignages d'enfants sur la guerre | doi = | journal = Le Cercle Psy | volume = 12  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2014 | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Brauner\u2019s intention was to analyze the problems posed in working with children traumatized by their experiences and by separation from their families, with the aim of adapting them to a new life and preparing them for integration into France.<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> Some of the children had lost their parents;

Nodoka suffered from a respiratory condition so her parents decided to move to help her recovery. Nodoka takes in her new surroundings, eager to help out and meet new people. While relaxing in the park, Nodoka suddenly witnesses a monster attack and upon hearing of a dog in trouble, goes off to find it. Nodoka finds the dog along with three Healing Animals: Rabirin, Pegitan and Nyatoran. The Animals explain that the dog is named Princess Latte and that they all come from the Healing Garden, a place in the center of the Earth that helps keep the planet healthy. However the garden is under a threat from the Bj\u00f6gens, who wants to infect the world with disease. The Bj\u00f6gen General Daruizen created the monster, known as a MegaBj\u00f6gen, by infecting an elemental spirit. The Animals were asked by Latte's mother, Queen Tiatine, to find those destined to be their partners and become the Legendary Precure and fight the Bj\u00f6gens. Latte is sensitive to the monster attacks and becomes sick when one appears. However, Nodoka's feelings of wanting to help resonate with Rabirin and allow her to transform into Cure Grace. Cure Grace then defeats the MegaBj\u00f6gen and purifies the Flower spirit, making Latte healthy again.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = No Longer Partners!?

Nodoka sneaks the animals into her room where they tell her all about Latte, the Healing Garden and the Bj\u00f6gens. The next day Nodoka goes to her first day at school, the Animals come with her in the hope of finding partners for Pegitan and Nyatoran. Nodoka discovers she is in the same class as Chiyu Sawaizumi and Hinata Hiramitsu, two girls she met the previous day. After school, Nodoka is asked if she wants to join one of the sports clubs. While enthusiastic about it, Nodoka soon reveals she is poorly unskilled at everything, much to Rabirin's dismay. Thinking Nodoka is unfit to be a Precure, Rabirin breaks off their partnership and runs off, with Pegitan pursuing her. Nodoka returns home hoping to find Rabirin, but when Latte falls ill, she returns to school to find Daruizen has created another MegaBj\u00f6gen. Nodoka attempts to fight the MegaBj\u00f6gen on her own but is easily overpowered. Latte calls out and draws Rabirin and Pegitan back to her. Rabirin asks why Nodoka is so determined, at which she reveals to Rabirin about her illness when she was younger, and that renders her unable to participate in sports.
