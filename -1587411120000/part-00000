The Faust legend has been the basis for [[Works based on Faust|many literary, artistic, cinematic, and musical works]] that have reinterpreted it through the ages. \"Faust\" and the adjective\n\"'''Faustian'''\" imply a situation in which an ambitious person surrenders moral integrity in order to achieve power and success for a limited term.<ref name=\"Faust1911\">{{Cite EB1911 |last=Phillips |first=Walter Alison |authorlink=Walter Alison Phillips |wstitle=Faust }}</ref><ref>\"Faustian\" \u2013 pertaining to or resembling or befitting Faust or Faustus especially in insatiably striving for worldly knowledge and power even at the price of spiritual values; \"a Faustian pact with the Devil\". http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Faustian</ref>\n\nThe Faust of early books \u2014 as well as the ballads, dramas, movies, and puppet-plays which grew out of them \u2014 is irrevocably damned because he prefers human to divine knowledge: \"he laid the [[Holy Scriptures]] behind the door and under the bench, refused to be called [[doctor of theology]], but preferred to be styled [[doctor of medicine]]\".<ref name=\"Faust1911\" /> Plays and comic puppet theatre loosely based on this legend were popular throughout Germany in the 16th century, often reducing Faust and [[Mephistopheles]] to figures of vulgar fun. The story was popularised in England by [[Christopher Marlowe]], who gave it a classic treatment in his play, ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]'' (whose date of publication is debated, but likely around 1587).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/christopher-marlowe-9399572|title=Christopher Marlowe|author=|date=|website=Biography|access-date=5 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323000251/https://www.biography.com/people/christopher-marlowe-9399572|archive-date=23 March 2018|df=}}</ref> In [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's reworking of the story]] two hundred years later, Faust becomes a dissatisfied intellectual who yearns for \"more than earthly meat and drink\" in his life.\n\n==Summary of the story==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nFaust is bored and depressed with his life as a scholar. After an attempt to take his own life, he calls on the Devil for further knowledge and magic powers with which to indulge all the pleasure and knowledge of the world. In response, the Devil's representative, [[Mephistopheles]], appears. He makes a bargain with Faust: Mephistopheles will serve Faust with his magic powers for a set number of years, but at the end of the term, the Devil will claim Faust's soul, and Faust will be eternally enslaved.\n\nDuring the term of the bargain, Faust makes use of Mephistopheles in various ways. In Goethe's drama, and many subsequent versions of the story, Mephistopheles helps Faust seduce a beautiful and innocent girl, usually named Gretchen, who is trying to make \"Fetch\" happen, whose life is ultimately destroyed when she gives birth to Faust's bastard son. Realizing this unholy act she drowns the child and is held for murder. However, Gretchen's innocence saves her in the end, and she enters [[Heaven]] after execution. In Goethe's rendition, Faust is saved by God via his constant striving \u2014 in combination with Gretchen's pleadings with God in the form of the [[eternal feminine]]. However, in the early tales, Faust is irrevocably corrupted and believes his sins cannot be forgiven; when the term ends, the Devil carries him off to [[Hell]].\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Twardowski z diablem.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Pan Twardowski]] and the devil'' by [[Micha\u0142 Elwiro Andriolli]].

The Polish story seems to have originated at roughly the same time as its German counterpart, yet it is unclear whether the two tales have a common origin or influenced each other. The historical Johann Georg Faust had studied in [[Krak\u00f3w]] for a time, and may have served as the inspiration for the character in the Polish legend.\n\nThe first known printed source of the legend of Faust is a small [[chapbook]] bearing the title ''[[Historia von D. Johann Fausten (chapbook)|Historia von D. Johann Fausten]]'', published in 1587. The book was re-edited and borrowed from throughout the 16th century. Other similar books of that period include:\n* ''Das Wagnerbuch'' (1593)\n* ''Das Widmann'sche Faustbuch'' (1599)\n* ''Dr. Fausts gro\u00dfer und gewaltiger H\u00f6llenzwang'' (Frankfurt 1609)\n* ''Dr. Johannes Faust, Magia naturalis et innaturalis'' (Passau 1612)\n* ''Das Pfitzer'sche Faustbuch'' (1674)\n* ''Dr. Fausts gro\u00dfer und gewaltiger Meergeist'' (Amsterdam 1692)\n* ''Das Wagnerbuch'' (1714)\n* ''Faustbuch des Christlich Meynenden'' (1725)\n\nThe 1725 Faust chapbook was widely circulated and also read by the young Goethe.\n\nRelated tales about a pact between man and the Devil include the plays ''[[Mariken van Nieumeghen]]'' (Dutch, early 16th century, author unknown), ''[[Cenodoxus]]'' (German, early 17th century, by [[Jacob Bidermann]]) and [[The Countess Cathleen]] (Irish Legend of unknown origin believed by some to be taken from the French play ''Les marchands d'\u00e2mes'').\n\n==Locations linked to the story==\n\n[[Staufen, Germany|Staufen]], a town in the extreme southwest of Germany, claims to be where Faust died (c. 1540); depictions appear on buildings, etc. The only historical source for this tradition is a passage in the ''Chronik der Grafen von Zimmern'', which was written around 1565, 25 years after Faust's presumed death. These chronicles are generally considered reliable, and in the 16th century there were still family ties between the lords of Staufen and the counts of Zimmern in nearby Donaueschingen.<ref>{{cite book |last=Geiges |first=Leif |date=1981 |title=Faust's Tod in Staufen: Sage \u2013 Dokumente |location=Freiburg im Breisgau |publisher=Kehrer Verlag KG}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s original telling of the tale, Wittenburg where Faust studied was also written as Wertenberge. This has led to a measure of speculation as to where precisely his story is set. Some scholars have suggested the [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg]]; others have suggested an allusion to Marlowe's own Cambridge (Gill, 2008, p.&nbsp;5)\n\n==Literary interpretations==\n\n[[File:Faustus Manuscript in the Huntingdon Library.jpg|240px|thumb|Marlowe ''Faustus'' in the [[Huntington Library]], [[San Marino, California]]]]\n\n===Marlowe's ''Doctor Faustus''===\nThe early Faust chapbook, while in circulation in northern Germany, found its way to England, where in 1592 an English translation was published, ''The Historie of the Damnable Life, and Deserved Death of Doctor Iohn Faustus'' credited to a certain \"P. F., Gent[leman]\". [[Christopher Marlowe]] used this work as the basis for his more ambitious play, ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]'' (published c. 1604). Marlowe also borrowed from [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Book of Martyrs]]'', on the exchanges between [[Pope Adrian VI]] and a rival pope.\n\n[[File:Page 004 (Faust, 1925).png|240 px|thumb|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]] for Goethe's ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'']]\n\n===Goethe's ''Faust''===\n{{main|Goethe's Faust}}\nAnother important version of the legend is the play ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]],'' written by the German author [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. The first part, which is the one more closely connected to the earlier legend, was published in 1808, the second posthumously in 1832.\n\nGoethe's ''Faust'' complicates the simple Christian moral of the original legend. A hybrid between a play and an extended poem, Goethe's two-part \"[[closet drama]]\" is epic in scope. It gathers together references from Christian, medieval, [[ancient Rome|Roman]], eastern, and [[Ancient Greek literature|Hellenic]] poetry, philosophy, and literature.\n\nThe composition and refinement of Goethe's own version of the legend occupied him for over sixty years (though not continuously). The final version, published after his death, is recognized as a great work of German literature.\n\nThe story concerns the fate of Faust in his quest for the true essence of life (\"{{lang|de|was die Welt im Innersten zusammenh\u00e4lt}}\"). Frustrated with learning and the limits to his knowledge, power, and enjoyment of life, he attracts the attention of the Devil (represented by Mephistopheles), who makes a bet with Faust that he will be able to satisfy him; a notion that Faust is incredibly reluctant towards, as he believes this happy zenith will never come. This is a significant difference between Goethe's \"Faust\" and Marlowe's; Faust is not the one who suggests the wager.\n\nIn the first part, Mephistopheles leads Faust through experiences that culminate in a lustful relationship with Gretchen, an innocent young woman. Gretchen and her family are destroyed by Mephistopheles' deceptions and Faust's desires. Part one of the story ends in tragedy for Faust, as Gretchen is saved but Faust is left to grieve in shame.\n\nThe second part begins with the spirits of the earth forgiving Faust (and the rest of mankind) and progresses into allegorical poetry. Faust and his Devil pass through and manipulate the world of politics and the world of the classical gods, and meet with [[Helen of Troy]] (the personification of beauty). Finally, having succeeded in taming the very forces of war and nature, Faust experiences a singular moment of happiness.\n\nMephistopheles tries to seize Faust's soul when he dies after this moment of happiness, but is frustrated and enraged when angels intervene due to God's grace. Though this grace is truly 'gratuitous' and does not condone Faust's frequent errors perpetrated with Mephistopheles, the angels state that this grace can only occur because of Faust's unending striving and due to the intercession of the forgiving Gretchen. The final scene has Faust's soul carried to heaven in the presence of God by the intercession of the \"Virgin, Mother, Queen, ... Goddess kind forever... Eternal Womanhood.<ref>Goethe, ''Faust, Part Two'', lines 12101\u201312110, translation: [[David Luke]], Oxford World Classics, {{ISBN|9780199536207}}.</ref>  The Goddess is thus victorious over Mephistopheles, who had insisted at Faust's death that he would be consigned to \"The Eternal Empty.\"\n\n===Bulgakov's ''The Master and Margarita''===\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = Goethe's ''Faust'' is a genuinely classical production, but the idea is a historical idea, and hence every notable historical era will have its own ''Faust.''\n |source = [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], ''[[Either/Or]]'', Immediate Stages of the Erotic\n |width  = 40%\n |align  = right\n}}\n\nThe story of Faust is woven into Dr. [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s best-known novel, ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' (1928\u20131940) with Margarita being modeled on Gretchen and the Master on Faust.{{Citation needed|reason=This may be a plausible theory, but whose is it?|date=March 2017}} Other characters in the novel include Woland (whose description recalls Mephistopheles) and Mikhail Alexandrovitch Berlioz (the head of Massolit).\n\n===Mann's ''Doctor Faustus''===\n[[Thomas Mann]]'s 1947 ''{{lang|de|[[Doctor Faustus (novel)|Doktor Faustus: Das Leben des deutschen Tonsetzers Adrian Leverk\u00fchn, erz\u00e4hlt von einem Freunde]]}}'' adapts the Faust legend to a 20th-century context, documenting the life of fictional composer Adrian Leverk\u00fchn as analog and embodiment of the early 20th-century history of Germany and of Europe. The talented Leverk\u00fchn, after contracting venereal disease from a brothel visit, forms a pact with a Mephistophelean character to grant him 24 years of brilliance and success as a composer. He produces works of increasing beauty to universal acclaim, even while physical illness begins to corrupt his body. In 1930, when presenting his final masterwork (''The Lamentation of Dr Faust'' ), he confesses the pact he had made: madness and syphilis now overcome him, and he suffers a slow and total collapse until his death in 1940. Leverk\u00fchn's spiritual, mental, and physical collapse and degradation are mapped on to the period in which [[Nazism]] rose in Germany, and Leverk\u00fchn's fate is shown as that of the soul of Germany.\n\n===Ben\u00e9t's ''The Devil and Daniel Webster''===\n[[File:Richard Westall - Faust and Lilith.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Faust and [[Lilith]]'' by [[Richard Westall]] (1831)]]\n[[Stephen Vincent Ben\u00e9t]]'s short story [[The Devil and Daniel Webster]] published in 1937 is a retelling of the tale of Faust based on the short story [[The Devil and Tom Walker]], written by [[Washington Irving]]. Benet's version of the story centers on a [[New Hampshire]] farmer by the name of Jabez Stone who, plagued with unending bad luck, is approached by the devil under the name of [[Old Scratch|Mr. Scratch]] who offers him seven years of prosperity in exchange for his soul. Jabez Stone is eventually defended by [[Daniel Webster]], a fictional version of the famous lawyer and orator, in front of a judge and jury of the damned, and his case is won. It was adapted in 1941 as ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster (film)|The Devil and Daniel Webster]]'' with [[James Craig (actor)|James Craig]] as Jabez and [[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]] as Webster.

In another, an extended montage sequence shows Faust, mounted behind Mephisto, riding through the heavens, and the camera view, effectively swooping through quickly changing panoramic backgrounds, courses past snowy mountains, high promontories and cliffs, and waterfalls.\n\nIn the Murnau version of the tale, the aging bearded scholar and alchemist, now disillusioned\u2014by a palpable failure of his antidotal, dark liquid in a phial, a supposed cure for victims in his plague-stricken town\u2014Faust renounces his many years of hard travail and studies in alchemy. We see this despair, watching him haul all his bound volumes by armloads onto a growing pyre; he intends to burn everything. But a wind comes, from offscreen, that turns over a few cabalistic leaves\u2014from one of the books' pages, sheets not yet in flames, one and another just catching Faust's eye. Their words contain a prescription for how to invoke the dreadful dark forces.\n\nFollowing Faust heeding these recipes, we see him begin enacting the mystic protocols: on a hill, alone, summoning Mephisto, certain forces begin to convene, and Faust in a state of growing trepidation hesitates, and begins to withdraw; he flees along a winding, twisting pathway, returning to his study chambers.  At pauses along this retreat, though, he meets a reappearing figure. Each time, it doffs its hat\u2014in a greeting, that is Mephisto, confronting him.  Mephisto overcomes Faust's reluctance to sign a long binding pact with the invitation that Faust may try on these powers, just for one day, and without obligation to longer terms. It comes the end of that day, the sands of twenty-four hours having run out, after Faust's having been restored to youth and, helped by his servant Mephisto to steal a beautiful woman from her wedding feast, Faust is tempted so much that he agrees to sign a pact for eternity (which is to say when, in due course, his time runs out). Eventually Faust becomes bored with the pursuit of pleasure and returns home, where he falls in love with the beautiful and innocent Gretchen. His corruption (enabled, or embodied, through the forms of Mephisto) ultimately ruins both their lives, though there is still a chance for redemption in the end.\n\nSimilarities to Goethe's Faust include the classic tale of a man who sold his soul to the Devil, the same Mephisto wagering with an angel to corrupt the soul of Faust, the plague sent by Mephisto on Faust's small town, and the familiar cliffhanger with Faust unable to find a cure for The Plague, and therefore turning to Mephisto, renouncing God, the angel, and science alike.\n\n===''[[La Beaut\u00e9 du diable]]'' (''The Beauty of the Devil'')===\n\nDirected by [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]], 1950 \u2013 A somewhat comedic adaptation with [[Michel Simon]] as Mephistopheles/Faust as old man, and [[G\u00e9rard Philipe]] as Faust transformed into a young man.\n\n===''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]''===\n\nDirected by [[Brian DePalma]], 1974 - A vain rock impresario, who has sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for eternal youth, corrupts and destroys a brilliant but unsuccessful songwriter and a beautiful ingenue.\n\n===''[[Mephisto (1981 film)|Mephisto]]''===\n\nDirected by [[Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3]], 1981 \u2013 An actor in 1930s Germany aligns himself with the [[Nazi]] party for prestige.\n\n===''[[Lekce Faust]]'' (''Faust'')===\n\nDirected by [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]], 1994 \u2013 The source material of \u0160vankmajer's film is the Faust legend; including traditional Czech puppet show versions, this film production uses a variety of cinematic formats, such as stop-motion photography animation and claymation.\n\n===''[[Faust (2011 film)|Faust]]''===\n\nDirected by [[Aleksandr Sokurov]], 2011 \u2013 German-language film starring Johannes Zeiler, Anton Adasinsky, Isolda Dychauk.\n\n===''American Satan''===\n\nDirected by [[Ash Avildsen]], 2017 \u2013  A rock and roll modern retelling of the Faust legend starring Andy Biersack as Johnny Faust.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5451690/plotsummary|title=American Satan (2017)|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=5 May 2018|via=www.imdb.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505153628/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5451690/plotsummary|archive-date=5 May 2018|df=}}</ref>\n\n===''[[The Last Faust]]''===\n\nDirected by [[Philipp Humm]], 2019 \u2013 a contemporary feature art film directly based on Goethe's [[Faust, Part One|''Faust'', Part One]] and [[Faust, Part Two|''Faust'', Part Two]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8871254/|title=The Last Faust|website=www.imdb.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref> The film is the first filmed version of ''Faust'', I and ''Faust'', II as well as a part of Humm's [[Gesamtkunstwerk]], an art project with over 150 different artworks such as paintings, photos, sculptures, drawings and an illustrated novella. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/4a9403cc-110e-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a|title=The Last Faust: Steven Berkoff stars in Philipp Humm\u2019s take on Goethe|last=Feay|first=Suzi|date=2019-11-29|website=Financial Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://philipphumm.art/the-last-faust/|title=The Last Faust - Ein Gesamtkunstwerk|last=Humm|first=Philipp|date=|website=philipphumm.art|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref>\n\n==Television interpretations==\n\n===Chespirito's ''Faust''===\n\nMexican comedian [[Chespirito]] acted as Faust in a sketch adaptation of the legend.

After Faust's youth is restored, he uses his powers to try conquering the heart of his assistant Margarita (played by [[Florinda Meza]]). However, after several failed (and funny) attempts to do so, he discovers she already has a boyfriend, and realizes he sold his soul for nothing.

The Faust legend has been the basis for [[Works based on Faust|many literary, artistic, cinematic, and musical works]] that have reinterpreted it through the ages. \"Faust\" and the adjective\n\"'''Faustian'''\" imply a situation in which an ambitious person surrenders moral integrity in order to achieve power and success for a limited term.<ref name=\"Faust1911\">{{Cite EB1911 |last=Phillips |first=Walter Alison |authorlink=Walter Alison Phillips |wstitle=Faust }}</ref><ref>\"Faustian\" \u2013 pertaining to or resembling or befitting Faust or Faustus especially in insatiably striving for worldly knowledge and power even at the price of spiritual values; \"a Faustian pact with the Devil\". http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Faustian</ref>\n\nThe Faust of early books \u2014 as well as the ballads, dramas, movies, and puppet-plays which grew out of them \u2014 is irrevocably damned because he prefers human to divine knowledge: \"he laid the [[Holy Scriptures]] behind the door and under the bench, refused to be called [[doctor of theology]], but preferred to be styled [[doctor of medicine]]\".<ref name=\"Faust1911\" /> Plays and comic puppet theatre loosely based on this legend were popular throughout Germany in the 16th century, often reducing Faust and [[Mephistopheles]] to figures of vulgar fun. The story was popularised in England by [[Christopher Marlowe]], who gave it a classic treatment in his play, ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]'' (whose date of publication is debated, but likely around 1587).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/christopher-marlowe-9399572|title=Christopher Marlowe|author=|date=|website=Biography|access-date=5 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323000251/https://www.biography.com/people/christopher-marlowe-9399572|archive-date=23 March 2018|df=}}</ref> In [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's reworking of the story]] two hundred years later, Faust becomes a dissatisfied intellectual who yearns for \"more than earthly meat and drink\" in his life.\n\n==Summary of the story==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nFaust is bored and depressed with his life as a scholar. After an attempt to take his own life, he calls on the Devil for further knowledge and magic powers with which to indulge all the pleasure and knowledge of the world. In response, the Devil's representative, [[Mephistopheles]], appears. He makes a bargain with Faust: Mephistopheles will serve Faust with his magic powers for a set number of years, but at the end of the term, the Devil will claim Faust's soul, and Faust will be eternally enslaved.\n\nDuring the term of the bargain, Faust makes use of Mephistopheles in various ways. In Goethe's drama, and many subsequent versions of the story, Mephistopheles helps Faust seduce a beautiful and innocent girl, usually named Gretchen, whose life is ultimately destroyed when she gives birth to Faust's bastard son. Realizing this unholy act she drowns the child and is held for murder. However, Gretchen's innocence saves her in the end, and she enters [[Heaven]] after execution. In Goethe's rendition, Faust is saved by God via his constant striving \u2014 in combination with Gretchen's pleadings with God in the form of the [[eternal feminine]]. However, in the early tales, Faust is irrevocably corrupted and believes his sins cannot be forgiven; when the term ends, the Devil carries him off to [[Hell]].\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Twardowski z diablem.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Pan Twardowski]] and the devil'' by [[Micha\u0142 Elwiro Andriolli]].

The Polish story seems to have originated at roughly the same time as its German counterpart, yet it is unclear whether the two tales have a common origin or influenced each other. The historical Johann Georg Faust had studied in [[Krak\u00f3w]] for a time, and may have served as the inspiration for the character in the Polish legend.\n\nThe first known printed source of the legend of Faust is a small [[chapbook]] bearing the title ''[[Historia von D. Johann Fausten (chapbook)|Historia von D. Johann Fausten]]'', published in 1587. The book was re-edited and borrowed from throughout the 16th century. Other similar books of that period include:\n* ''Das Wagnerbuch'' (1593)\n* ''Das Widmann'sche Faustbuch'' (1599)\n* ''Dr. Fausts gro\u00dfer und gewaltiger H\u00f6llenzwang'' (Frankfurt 1609)\n* ''Dr. Johannes Faust, Magia naturalis et innaturalis'' (Passau 1612)\n* ''Das Pfitzer'sche Faustbuch'' (1674)\n* ''Dr. Fausts gro\u00dfer und gewaltiger Meergeist'' (Amsterdam 1692)\n* ''Das Wagnerbuch'' (1714)\n* ''Faustbuch des Christlich Meynenden'' (1725)\n\nThe 1725 Faust chapbook was widely circulated and also read by the young Goethe.\n\nRelated tales about a pact between man and the Devil include the plays ''[[Mariken van Nieumeghen]]'' (Dutch, early 16th century, author unknown), ''[[Cenodoxus]]'' (German, early 17th century, by [[Jacob Bidermann]]) and [[The Countess Cathleen]] (Irish Legend of unknown origin believed by some to be taken from the French play ''Les marchands d'\u00e2mes'').\n\n==Locations linked to the story==\n\n[[Staufen, Germany|Staufen]], a town in the extreme southwest of Germany, claims to be where Faust died (c. 1540); depictions appear on buildings, etc. The only historical source for this tradition is a passage in the ''Chronik der Grafen von Zimmern'', which was written around 1565, 25 years after Faust's presumed death. These chronicles are generally considered reliable, and in the 16th century there were still family ties between the lords of Staufen and the counts of Zimmern in nearby Donaueschingen.<ref>{{cite book |last=Geiges |first=Leif |date=1981 |title=Faust's Tod in Staufen: Sage \u2013 Dokumente |location=Freiburg im Breisgau |publisher=Kehrer Verlag KG}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s original telling of the tale, Wittenburg where Faust studied was also written as Wertenberge. This has led to a measure of speculation as to where precisely his story is set. Some scholars have suggested the [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg]]; others have suggested an allusion to Marlowe's own Cambridge (Gill, 2008, p.&nbsp;5)\n\n==Literary interpretations==\n\n[[File:Faustus Manuscript in the Huntingdon Library.jpg|240px|thumb|Marlowe ''Faustus'' in the [[Huntington Library]], [[San Marino, California]]]]\n\n===Marlowe's ''Doctor Faustus''===\nThe early Faust chapbook, while in circulation in northern Germany, found its way to England, where in 1592 an English translation was published, ''The Historie of the Damnable Life, and Deserved Death of Doctor Iohn Faustus'' credited to a certain \"P. F., Gent[leman]\". [[Christopher Marlowe]] used this work as the basis for his more ambitious play, ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]'' (published c. 1604). Marlowe also borrowed from [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Book of Martyrs]]'', on the exchanges between [[Pope Adrian VI]] and a rival pope.\n\n[[File:Page 004 (Faust, 1925).png|240 px|thumb|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]] for Goethe's ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'']]\n\n===Goethe's ''Faust''===\n{{main|Goethe's Faust}}\nAnother important version of the legend is the play ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]],'' written by the German author [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. The first part, which is the one more closely connected to the earlier legend, was published in 1808, the second posthumously in 1832.\n\nGoethe's ''Faust'' complicates the simple Christian moral of the original legend. A hybrid between a play and an extended poem, Goethe's two-part \"[[closet drama]]\" is epic in scope. It gathers together references from Christian, medieval, [[ancient Rome|Roman]], eastern, and [[Ancient Greek literature|Hellenic]] poetry, philosophy, and literature.\n\nThe composition and refinement of Goethe's own version of the legend occupied him for over sixty years (though not continuously). The final version, published after his death, is recognized as a great work of German literature.\n\nThe story concerns the fate of Faust in his quest for the true essence of life (\"{{lang|de|was die Welt im Innersten zusammenh\u00e4lt}}\"). Frustrated with learning and the limits to his knowledge, power, and enjoyment of life, he attracts the attention of the Devil (represented by Mephistopheles), who makes a bet with Faust that he will be able to satisfy him; a notion that Faust is incredibly reluctant towards, as he believes this happy zenith will never come. This is a significant difference between Goethe's \"Faust\" and Marlowe's; Faust is not the one who suggests the wager.\n\nIn the first part, Mephistopheles leads Faust through experiences that culminate in a lustful relationship with Gretchen, an innocent young woman. Gretchen and her family are destroyed by Mephistopheles' deceptions and Faust's desires. Part one of the story ends in tragedy for Faust, as Gretchen is saved but Faust is left to grieve in shame.\n\nThe second part begins with the spirits of the earth forgiving Faust (and the rest of mankind) and progresses into allegorical poetry. Faust and his Devil pass through and manipulate the world of politics and the world of the classical gods, and meet with [[Helen of Troy]] (the personification of beauty). Finally, having succeeded in taming the very forces of war and nature, Faust experiences a singular moment of happiness.\n\nMephistopheles tries to seize Faust's soul when he dies after this moment of happiness, but is frustrated and enraged when angels intervene due to God's grace. Though this grace is truly 'gratuitous' and does not condone Faust's frequent errors perpetrated with Mephistopheles, the angels state that this grace can only occur because of Faust's unending striving and due to the intercession of the forgiving Gretchen. The final scene has Faust's soul carried to heaven in the presence of God by the intercession of the \"Virgin, Mother, Queen, ... Goddess kind forever... Eternal Womanhood.<ref>Goethe, ''Faust, Part Two'', lines 12101\u201312110, translation: [[David Luke]], Oxford World Classics, {{ISBN|9780199536207}}.</ref>  The Goddess is thus victorious over Mephistopheles, who had insisted at Faust's death that he would be consigned to \"The Eternal Empty.\"\n\n===Bulgakov's ''The Master and Margarita''===\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = Goethe's ''Faust'' is a genuinely classical production, but the idea is a historical idea, and hence every notable historical era will have its own ''Faust.''\n |source = [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], ''[[Either/Or]]'', Immediate Stages of the Erotic\n |width  = 40%\n |align  = right\n}}\n\nThe story of Faust is woven into Dr. [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s best-known novel, ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' (1928\u20131940) with Margarita being modeled on Gretchen and the Master on Faust.{{Citation needed|reason=This may be a plausible theory, but whose is it?|date=March 2017}} Other characters in the novel include Woland (whose description recalls Mephistopheles) and Mikhail Alexandrovitch Berlioz (the head of Massolit).\n\n===Mann's ''Doctor Faustus''===\n[[Thomas Mann]]'s 1947 ''{{lang|de|[[Doctor Faustus (novel)|Doktor Faustus: Das Leben des deutschen Tonsetzers Adrian Leverk\u00fchn, erz\u00e4hlt von einem Freunde]]}}'' adapts the Faust legend to a 20th-century context, documenting the life of fictional composer Adrian Leverk\u00fchn as analog and embodiment of the early 20th-century history of Germany and of Europe. The talented Leverk\u00fchn, after contracting venereal disease from a brothel visit, forms a pact with a Mephistophelean character to grant him 24 years of brilliance and success as a composer. He produces works of increasing beauty to universal acclaim, even while physical illness begins to corrupt his body. In 1930, when presenting his final masterwork (''The Lamentation of Dr Faust'' ), he confesses the pact he had made: madness and syphilis now overcome him, and he suffers a slow and total collapse until his death in 1940. Leverk\u00fchn's spiritual, mental, and physical collapse and degradation are mapped on to the period in which [[Nazism]] rose in Germany, and Leverk\u00fchn's fate is shown as that of the soul of Germany.\n\n===Ben\u00e9t's ''The Devil and Daniel Webster''===\n[[File:Richard Westall - Faust and Lilith.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Faust and [[Lilith]]'' by [[Richard Westall]] (1831)]]\n[[Stephen Vincent Ben\u00e9t]]'s short story [[The Devil and Daniel Webster]] published in 1937 is a retelling of the tale of Faust based on the short story [[The Devil and Tom Walker]], written by [[Washington Irving]]. Benet's version of the story centers on a [[New Hampshire]] farmer by the name of Jabez Stone who, plagued with unending bad luck, is approached by the devil under the name of [[Old Scratch|Mr. Scratch]] who offers him seven years of prosperity in exchange for his soul. Jabez Stone is eventually defended by [[Daniel Webster]], a fictional version of the famous lawyer and orator, in front of a judge and jury of the damned, and his case is won. It was adapted in 1941 as ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster (film)|The Devil and Daniel Webster]]'' with [[James Craig (actor)|James Craig]] as Jabez and [[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]] as Webster.

In another, an extended montage sequence shows Faust, mounted behind Mephisto, riding through the heavens, and the camera view, effectively swooping through quickly changing panoramic backgrounds, courses past snowy mountains, high promontories and cliffs, and waterfalls.\n\nIn the Murnau version of the tale, the aging bearded scholar and alchemist, now disillusioned\u2014by a palpable failure of his antidotal, dark liquid in a phial, a supposed cure for victims in his plague-stricken town\u2014Faust renounces his many years of hard travail and studies in alchemy. We see this despair, watching him haul all his bound volumes by armloads onto a growing pyre; he intends to burn everything. But a wind comes, from offscreen, that turns over a few cabalistic leaves\u2014from one of the books' pages, sheets not yet in flames, one and another just catching Faust's eye. Their words contain a prescription for how to invoke the dreadful dark forces.\n\nFollowing Faust heeding these recipes, we see him begin enacting the mystic protocols: on a hill, alone, summoning Mephisto, certain forces begin to convene, and Faust in a state of growing trepidation hesitates, and begins to withdraw; he flees along a winding, twisting pathway, returning to his study chambers.  At pauses along this retreat, though, he meets a reappearing figure. Each time, it doffs its hat\u2014in a greeting, that is Mephisto, confronting him.  Mephisto overcomes Faust's reluctance to sign a long binding pact with the invitation that Faust may try on these powers, just for one day, and without obligation to longer terms. It comes the end of that day, the sands of twenty-four hours having run out, after Faust's having been restored to youth and, helped by his servant Mephisto to steal a beautiful woman from her wedding feast, Faust is tempted so much that he agrees to sign a pact for eternity (which is to say when, in due course, his time runs out). Eventually Faust becomes bored with the pursuit of pleasure and returns home, where he falls in love with the beautiful and innocent Gretchen. His corruption (enabled, or embodied, through the forms of Mephisto) ultimately ruins both their lives, though there is still a chance for redemption in the end.\n\nSimilarities to Goethe's Faust include the classic tale of a man who sold his soul to the Devil, the same Mephisto wagering with an angel to corrupt the soul of Faust, the plague sent by Mephisto on Faust's small town, and the familiar cliffhanger with Faust unable to find a cure for The Plague, and therefore turning to Mephisto, renouncing God, the angel, and science alike.\n\n===''[[La Beaut\u00e9 du diable]]'' (''The Beauty of the Devil'')===\n\nDirected by [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]], 1950 \u2013 A somewhat comedic adaptation with [[Michel Simon]] as Mephistopheles/Faust as old man, and [[G\u00e9rard Philipe]] as Faust transformed into a young man.\n\n===''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]''===\n\nDirected by [[Brian DePalma]], 1974 - A vain rock impresario, who has sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for eternal youth, corrupts and destroys a brilliant but unsuccessful songwriter and a beautiful ingenue.\n\n===''[[Mephisto (1981 film)|Mephisto]]''===\n\nDirected by [[Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3]], 1981 \u2013 An actor in 1930s Germany aligns himself with the [[Nazi]] party for prestige.\n\n===''[[Lekce Faust]]'' (''Faust'')===\n\nDirected by [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]], 1994 \u2013 The source material of \u0160vankmajer's film is the Faust legend; including traditional Czech puppet show versions, this film production uses a variety of cinematic formats, such as stop-motion photography animation and claymation.\n\n===''[[Faust (2011 film)|Faust]]''===\n\nDirected by [[Aleksandr Sokurov]], 2011 \u2013 German-language film starring Johannes Zeiler, Anton Adasinsky, Isolda Dychauk.\n\n===''American Satan''===\n\nDirected by [[Ash Avildsen]], 2017 \u2013  A rock and roll modern retelling of the Faust legend starring Andy Biersack as Johnny Faust.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5451690/plotsummary|title=American Satan (2017)|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=5 May 2018|via=www.imdb.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505153628/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5451690/plotsummary|archive-date=5 May 2018|df=}}</ref>\n\n===''[[The Last Faust]]''===\n\nDirected by [[Philipp Humm]], 2019 \u2013 a contemporary feature art film directly based on Goethe's [[Faust, Part One|''Faust'', Part One]] and [[Faust, Part Two|''Faust'', Part Two]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8871254/|title=The Last Faust|website=www.imdb.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref> The film is the first filmed version of ''Faust'', I and ''Faust'', II as well as a part of Humm's [[Gesamtkunstwerk]], an art project with over 150 different artworks such as paintings, photos, sculptures, drawings and an illustrated novella. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/4a9403cc-110e-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a|title=The Last Faust: Steven Berkoff stars in Philipp Humm\u2019s take on Goethe|last=Feay|first=Suzi|date=2019-11-29|website=Financial Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://philipphumm.art/the-last-faust/|title=The Last Faust - Ein Gesamtkunstwerk|last=Humm|first=Philipp|date=|website=philipphumm.art|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref>\n\n==Television interpretations==\n\n===Chespirito's ''Faust''===\n\nMexican comedian [[Chespirito]] acted as Faust in a sketch adaptation of the legend. [[Ramon Valdez]] played Mephistopheles (presenting himself also as The Devil), and in this particular version, Faust sells his soul by signing a contract, after which Mephistopheles gives him an object known as the \"Chirr\u00edn-Chirri\u00f3n\" (which resembles a horse whip) which grants him the power to make things, people or even youth or age, appear or disappear, by speaking the object's name, followed by the word \"Chirr\u00edn\" (for them to appear) or \"Chirri\u00f3n\" (for them to disappear). After Faust's youth is restored, he uses his powers to try conquering the heart of his assistant Margarita (played by [[Florinda Meza]]). However, after several failed (and funny) attempts to do so, he discovers she already has a boyfriend, and realizes he sold his soul for nothing. At this point, Mephistopheles returns to take Faust's soul to hell, producing the signed contract for supporting his claim. Faust responds by using the Chirr\u00edn-Chirri\u00f3n to make the contract itself disappear, which makes Mephistopheles cry.\n\n==Musical interpretations==\n\n[[File:Sergei Prokudin-Gorskii - Feodor Chaliapin as Mephisto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Feodor Chaliapin]] as M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s, 1915]]\n\n===Operatic===\n\nThe Faust legend has been the basis for several major operas: for a more complete list, visit [[Works based on Faust]]\n* ''[[Mefistofele]]'', the only completed opera by [[Arrigo Boito]]\n* ''[[Doktor Faust]]'', begun by [[Ferruccio Busoni]] and completed by his pupil [[Philipp Jarnach]]\n* ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', by [[Charles Gounod]] to a French [[libretto]] by [[Jules Barbier]] and [[Michel Carr\u00e9]] from Carr\u00e9's play ''Faust et Marguerite'', in turn loosely based on Goethe's ''[[Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy|Faust, Part 1]]''\n* [[Faust (Spohr)]], one of the earliest operatic adaptations of the story, with separate versions premiering in 1816 and 1852 respectively.\n* [[Hector Berlioz]]'s ''[[La Damnation de Faust]]'' (1846)\n\n===Symphonic===\n\nFaust has inspired major musical works in other forms: \n* ''[[Faust Overture]]'' by [[Richard Wagner]]\n* ''[[Scenes from Goethe's Faust]]'' by [[Robert Schumann]]\n* ''[[Faust Symphony]]'' by [[Franz Liszt]]\n* [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 8]] by [[Gustav Mahler]]\n* ''[[Histoire du soldat]]'' by [[Igor Stravinsky]]\n* ''Faust'' was the title and inspiration of [[Phantom Regiment Drum and Bugle Corps]]' 2006 show.\n\n\n===Other adaptions===\n\n* ''[[Faustian Echoes]]'' by American [[black metal]] band [[Agalloch]]\n* ''Faust Arp'' by English [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Radiohead]].

(Prior to this, Lifeson used [[Moog Taurus]] Bass Pedals before they were replaced by Korg MIDI pedals in the 1980s.) Lifeson and his bandmates share a desire to accurately depict songs from their albums when playing live performances. Toward this goal, beginning in the late 1980s the band equipped their live performances with a capacious rack of samplers. The band members use these samplers in real-time to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, [[accompaniment]]s, vocal [[harmonies]], and other sound \"events\" that are familiarly heard on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members share duties throughout most songs, with each member triggering certain sounds with his available limbs, while playing his primary instrument(s).<ref name=\"onstagemag.com\" />\n\n==Influence==\nSome artists have cited Lifeson as an influence, including [[Paul Gilbert]] of [[Mr. Big (American band)|Mr. Big]],<ref>{{ cite web | accessdate = 28 February 2017 | url = http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/paulgilbert-May2004.htm | title = Interview With Paul Gilbert | first = Keith | last = McDonald | quote = ''Q'': Who were your guitar influences?<br />''Paul Gilbert'': Jimmy Page, Eddie Van Halen, Alex Lifeson [...] | date = May 2004 | website = [[Metal Rules]]}}</ref> [[John Petrucci]] of [[Dream Theater]],<ref>{{ cite web | accessdate = 4 April 2017 | quote = [...] When they played the song \u2018La Villa Strangiato,\u2019 the solo that Alex [Lifeson] played really had a huge influence on me.

This was done deliberately as an alternative to issuing the album explicitly under Lifeson's name. The title track is from the [[W.&nbsp;H. Auden]] poem, also entitled \"Victor\". Both son Adrian and wife Charlene also contributed to the album.

(Prior to this, Lifeson used [[Moog Taurus]] Bass Pedals before they were replaced by Korg MIDI pedals in the 1980s.) Lifeson and his bandmates share a desire to accurately depict songs from their albums when playing live performances. Toward this goal, beginning in the late 1980s the band equipped their live performances with a capacious rack of samplers. The band members use these samplers in real-time to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, [[accompaniment]]s, vocal [[harmonies]], and other sound \"events\" that are familiarly heard on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members share duties throughout most songs, with each member triggering certain sounds with his available limbs, while playing his primary instrument(s).<ref name=\"onstagemag.com\" />\n\n==Influence==\nSome artists have cited Lifeson as an influence, including [[Paul Gilbert]] of [[Mr. Big (American band)|Mr. Big]],<ref>{{ cite web | accessdate = 28 February 2017 | url = http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/paulgilbert-May2004.htm | title = Interview With Paul Gilbert | first = Keith | last = McDonald | quote = ''Q'': Who were your guitar influences?<br />''Paul Gilbert'': Jimmy Page, Eddie Van Halen, Alex Lifeson [...] | date = May 2004 | website = [[Metal Rules]]}}</ref> [[John Petrucci]] of [[Dream Theater]],<ref>{{ cite web | accessdate = 4 April 2017 | quote = [...] When they played the song \u2018La Villa Strangiato,\u2019 the solo that Alex [Lifeson] played really had a huge influence on me.

[[Abel Tasman]] had circumnavigated it more widely in 1642-43<ref>James Backhouse Walker, 'Abel Janszoon Tasman: His Life and Voyages\", Read before the Royal Society of Tasmania, 25 Nov. 1895. First sentence.</ref> and had charted its north coast in 1644.\n\nFlinders made three voyages to the southern ocean between 1791 and 1810. In the second voyage, [[George Bass]] and Flinders confirmed that [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now [[Tasmania]]) was an island. In the third voyage, Flinders circumnavigated the mainland of what was to be called Australia, accompanied by Aboriginal man [[Bungaree]].\n \nHeading back to England in 1803, Flinders' vessel needed urgent repairs at [[Isle de France (Mauritius)]]. Although Britain and France were at war, Flinders thought the scientific nature of his work would ensure safe passage, but a suspicious governor kept him under arrest for more than six years. In captivity, he recorded details of his voyages for future publication, and put forward his rationale for naming the new continent 'Australia', as an umbrella term for [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] and [[New South Wales]] \u2013 a suggestion taken up later by [[Lachlan Macquarie|Governor Macquarie]].\n\nFlinders' health had suffered, however, and although he reached home in 1810, he did not live to see the success of his widely praised book and atlas, ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]''. The location of his grave was lost by the mid-19th century but archaeologists excavating a former burial ground near London's [[Euston railway station]] for the [[High Speed 2|High Speed 2 (HS2)]] project, announced in January 2019 that his remains had been identified.\n\n==Early life==\nMatthew Flinders was born in [[Donington, Lincolnshire]], England, the son of Matthew Flinders, a surgeon, and his wife Susannah, n\u00e9e Ward. He was educated at [[The Thomas Cowley High School|Cowley's Charity School]], Donington, from 1780 and then at the Reverend John Shinglar's Grammar School at [[Horbling]] in Lincolnshire.<ref>[https://www.southhollandlife.com/2015/04/matthew-flinders-his-life-in-donington/ Matthew Flinders \u2013 his life in Donington] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921045849/https://www.southhollandlife.com/2015/04/matthew-flinders-his-life-in-donington/ |date=21 September 2017 }} South Holland Life.

Initially serving on {{HMS|Alert}}, he transferred to {{HMS|Scipio|1782|6}}, and in July 1790 was made [[midshipman]] on {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} under [[Sir Thomas Pasley, 1st Baronet|Captain Pasley]]. By Pasley's recommendation, he joined [[Captain Bligh]]'s expedition on {{HMS|Providence|1791|6}}, transporting [[breadfruit]] from [[Tahiti]] to [[Jamaica]]. This was also Bligh's second \"Breadfruit Voyage\" following on from the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|ill-fated voyage of the ''Bounty'']].\n\nFlinders' first voyage to New South Wales, and first trip to [[Port Jackson]], was in 1795 as a midshipman aboard {{HMS|Reliance|1793|6}}, carrying the newly appointed [[governor of New South Wales]] [[John Hunter (New South Wales)|Captain John Hunter]]. On this voyage he quickly established himself as a fine navigator and cartographer, and became friends with the ship's surgeon [[George Bass]] who was three years his senior and had been born {{convert|11|mi|km}} from Donington.\n\nNot long after their arrival in [[Port Jackson]], Bass and Flinders made two expeditions in two small open boats, named ''Tom Thumb'' and ''Tom Thumb II'' respectively: the first to [[Botany Bay]] and [[Georges River]], the second, in the larger ''Tom Thumb II'',<ref>''The Journal of Daniel Paine 1794\u20131797'' page 39</ref> south from Port Jackson to [[Lake Illawarra]], during which expedition they had to seek shelter at [[Wattamolla]].\n\n[[File:Bass-Flinders Westernport discovery memorial.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Memorial at [[Flinders, Victoria]], commemorating the discovery of [[Western Port]] on 4 January 1798, by George Bass and the later passage of [[Bass Strait]] by Bass and Flinders in the same year]]\n\nIn 1798, Matthew Flinders, now a [[lieutenant]], was given command of the sloop {{ship||Norfolk|sloop|2}} with orders \"to sail beyond [[Furneaux Group|Furneaux's Islands]], and, should a strait be found, pass through it, and return by the south end of [[Van Diemen's Land]]\". The passage between the Australian mainland and Tasmania enabled savings of several days on the journey from England, and was named [[Bass Strait]], after his close friend. In honour of this discovery, the largest island in Bass Strait would later be named [[Flinders Island]]. The town of [[Flinders, Victoria|Flinders]] near the mouth of [[Western Port]] also commemorates Bass' discovery of that bay and port on 4 January 1798. Flinders never entered Western Port, and passed [[Cape Schanck]] only on 3 May 1802.<ref>[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1157394 In the wake of Bass and Flinders: 200 years on :the story of the re-enactment voyages 200 years on... | National Library of Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113202344/http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1157394 |date=13 November 2011 }}.

He rowed ashore at [[Woody Point, Queensland|Woody Point]] ({{Coord|-27.2632|153.1039|type:landmark_region:AU-QLD|name=Woody Point}}) and named a point {{Convert|2|mi||abbr=}} west of that ({{Coord|-27.2628|153.0792|type:landmark_region:AU-QLD|name=Clontarf Point}}) as \"Redcliffe\" (on account of its red cliffs).

Banks used his influence with [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Earl Spencer]] to convince the [[Admiralty]] of the importance of an expedition to chart the coastline of New Holland. As a result, in January 1801, Flinders was given command of {{HMS|Investigator|1801|6}}, a 334-ton sloop, and promoted to [[Commander (Royal Navy)|commander]] the following month.\n\n''Investigator'' set sail for New Holland on 18 July 1801. Attached to the expedition were the [[botanist]] [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]], [[botanical artist]] [[Ferdinand Bauer]], landscape artist [[William Westall (artist)|William Westall]], gardener [[Peter Good]], geological assistant John Allen, and [[John Crosley (astronomer)|John Crosley]] as astronomer.<ref name=vallance>Vallance, T.G., Moore, D.T. & Groves, E.W. 2001.

However the Admiralty had strict rules against wives accompanying captains. Flinders brought Ann on board ship and planned to ignore the rules, but the Admiralty learned of his plans and he was severely castigated for his bad judgement and told he must remove her from the ship. This is well documented in correspondence between Flinders and his chief benefactor, [[Sir Joseph Banks]], in May 1801:<ref name=Scott>{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Ernest Findlay|title=The Life of Captain Matthew Flinders|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924028661811|year=1914|publisher=Angus & Robertson|location=Sydney|isbn=978-0207197178|access-date=12 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804074201/https://archive.org/details/cu31924028661811|archive-date=4 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|I have but time to tell you that the news of your marriage, which was published in the Lincoln paper, has reached me.

When they finally reunited, Matthew and Ann had one daughter, Anne, (1 April 1812\u20131892), who later married [[William Petrie (electrical engineer)|William Petrie]] (1821\u20131908). In 1853, the governments of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] bequeathed a belated pension to her (deceased) mother of \u00a3100 per year, to go to surviving issue of the union.

Such phenomena have now also been found in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and in the [[Irish Sea]].

Ryl Astron Soc, Vol. 9, p352, 1968.</ref>\n\nIn his 1803 observations of the large tides at [[Broad Sound (Queensland)|Broad Sound]] in Queensland (up to 11m range) Flinders correctly attributed this to two  waves travelling north and south, respectively, and meeting at Broad Sound. He postulated that the dense reef wall further offshore caused the deep ocean tide to bifurcate at the northern southern ends of the reef, travel into shallow shelf waters and meet at Broad Sound. These phenomena were finally confirmed by [[G. I. Taylor]] in his landmark 1919 Irish Sea analysis.<ref name=\"Taylor19\">''Tidal Friction in the Irish Sea'', G.I.

However, the ship was wrecked on [[Wreck Reefs]], part of the [[Great Barrier Reef]], approximately {{convert|700|mi}} north of Sydney. Flinders navigated the ship's [[cutter (ship)|cutter]] across open sea back to Sydney, and arranged for the rescue of the remaining marooned crew. Flinders then took command of the 29-ton [[schooner]] {{HMS|Cumberland|1803|6}} in order to return to England, but the poor condition of the vessel forced him to put in at French-controlled Isle de France (now known as Mauritius) for repairs on 17 December 1803, just three months after Baudin had died there.\n\n[[Napoleonic Wars|War with France]] had broken out again the previous May, but Flinders hoped his French passport (despite its being issued for ''Investigator'' and not ''Cumberland'')<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/encounter/flinders/ships.htm|title=Flinders' Voyage: Ships|publisher=[[State Library of South Australia]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611022013/http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/encounter/flinders/ships.htm|archive-date=11 June 2017|url-status=live|access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref> and the scientific nature of his mission would allow him to continue on his way.

Here he found that Banks did not approve of the name and had not unpacked the chart he had sent him, and that \"New Holland\" and \"Terra Australis\" were still in general use.  As a result, a book by Flinders was published under the title ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]'' and his published map of 1814 also shows 'Terra Australis' as the first of the two name options, despite his objections.

This appears from a chart by Thevenot in 1663, which he says \"was originally taken from that done in inlaid work upon the pavement of the new Stadt House at Amsterdam\". It is necessary, however, to geographical precision that the whole of this great body of land should be distinguished by one general term, and under the circumstances of the discovery of the different parts, the original Terra Australis has been judged the most proper. Of this term, therefore, we shall hereafter make use when speaking of New Holland and New South Wales in a collective sense; and when using it in an extensive signification, the adjacent isles, including that of Van Diemen, must be understood to be comprehended.}}\n\nAlthough Th\u00e9venot said that he had taken his chart from the one inlaid into the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall, in fact it appears to be an almost exact copy of that of [[Joan Blaeu]] in his ''Archipelagus Orientalis sive Asiaticus'' published in 1659.<ref>National Library of Australia, Maura O'Connor, Terry Birtles, Martin Woods and John Clark, ''Australia in Maps: Great Maps in Australia's History from the National Library's Collection'', Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2007, p.32; this map is reproduced in Gunter Schilder, ''Australia Unveiled'', Amsterdam, Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, 1976, p.402. image at: [http://www.bildindex.de/obj20516052.html# home] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505231156/http://www.bildindex.de/obj20516052.html |date=5 May 2012 }} See also [http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/album/albumView.aspx?itemID=862386&acmsid=0 Joan Blaeu, Nova et accvratissima totivs terrarvm orbis tabvla, 1667] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130731163208/http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/album/albumView.aspx?itemID=862386&acmsid=0 |date=31 July 2013 }}</ref> It seems to have been Th\u00e9venot who introduced a differentiation between ''Nova Hollandia'' to the west and ''Terre Australe'' to the east of the meridian corresponding to 135\u00b0 East of Greenwich, emphasised by the latitude staff running down that meridian, as there is no such division on Blaeu's map.<ref>Margaret Cameron Ash, \"French Mischief: A Foxy Map of New Holland\", ''The Globe'', no.68, 2011, pp.1\u201314.</ref>\n\nIn his ''Voyage'', Flinders wrote:<ref>Matthew Flinders, [http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/encounter/collection/B12985211_259_3.htm ''A voyage to Terra Australis'' (Introduction)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111005442/http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/encounter/collection/B12985211_259_3.htm |date=11 November 2012 }}.

[[Abel Tasman]] had circumnavigated it more widely in 1642-43<ref>James Backhouse Walker, 'Abel Janszoon Tasman: His Life and Voyages\", Read before the Royal Society of Tasmania, 25 Nov. 1895. First sentence.</ref> and had charted its north coast in 1644.\n\nFlinders made three voyages to the southern ocean between 1791 and 1810. In the second voyage, [[George Bass]] and Flinders confirmed that [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now [[Tasmania]]) was an island. In the third voyage, Flinders circumnavigated the mainland of what was to be called Australia, accompanied by Aboriginal man [[Bungaree]].\n \nHeading back to England in 1803, Flinders' vessel needed urgent repairs at [[Isle de France (Mauritius)]]. Although Britain and France were at war, Flinders thought the scientific nature of his work would ensure safe passage, but a suspicious governor kept him under arrest for more than six years. In captivity, he recorded details of his voyages for future publication, and put forward his rationale for naming the new continent 'Australia', as an umbrella term for [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] and [[New South Wales]] \u2013 a suggestion taken up later by [[Lachlan Macquarie|Governor Macquarie]].\n\nFlinders' health had suffered, however, and although he reached home in 1810, he did not live to see the success of his widely praised book and atlas, ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]''. The location of his grave was lost by the mid-19th century but archaeologists excavating a former burial ground near London's [[Euston railway station]] for the [[High Speed 2|High Speed 2 (HS2)]] project, announced in January 2019 that his remains had been identified.\n\n==Early life==\nMatthew Flinders was born in [[Donington, Lincolnshire]], England, the son of Matthew Flinders, a surgeon, and his wife Susannah, n\u00e9e Ward. He was educated at [[The Thomas Cowley High School|Cowley's Charity School]], Donington, from 1780 and then at the Reverend John Shinglar's Grammar School at [[Horbling]] in Lincolnshire.<ref>[https://www.southhollandlife.com/2015/04/matthew-flinders-his-life-in-donington/ Matthew Flinders \u2013 his life in Donington] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921045849/https://www.southhollandlife.com/2015/04/matthew-flinders-his-life-in-donington/ |date=21 September 2017 }} South Holland Life.

Banks used his influence with [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Earl Spencer]] to convince the [[Admiralty]] of the importance of an expedition to chart the coastline of New Holland. As a result, in January 1801, Flinders was given command of {{HMS|Investigator|1801|6}}, a 334-ton sloop, and promoted to [[Commander (Royal Navy)|commander]] the following month.\n\n''Investigator'' set sail for New Holland on 18 July 1801.

However the Admiralty had strict rules against wives accompanying captains. Flinders brought Ann on board ship and planned to ignore the rules, but the Admiralty learned of his plans and he was severely chastised for his bad judgement and told he must remove her from the ship.

Such phenomena have now also been found in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and in the [[Irish Sea]]. In both the Irish Sea and the two South Australian gulfs, a north bound wave from the open ocean interferes non-linearly and with a reflected and weaker southbound wave, resulting in aperiodic and very dissipative tidal motions.<ref name=\"Munk69\">''Once Again \u2013 Tidal Friction'', W. Munk, Qtly J. Ryl Astron Soc, Vol. 9, p352, 1968.</ref>\n\nIn his 1803 observations of the large tides at [[Broad Sound (Queensland)|Broad Sound]] in Queensland (up to 11m range) Flinders correctly attributed this to two  waves travelling north and south, respectively, and meeting at Broad Sound. He postulated that the dense reef wall further offshore caused the deep ocean tide to bifurcate at the northern southern ends of the reef, travel into shallow shelf waters and meet at Broad Sound. These phenomena were finally confirmed by [[G. I. Taylor]] in his landmark 1919 Irish Sea analysis.<ref name=\"Taylor19\">''Tidal Friction in the Irish Sea'', G.I.

Later that year, he wrote to [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] and mentioned \"my general chart of Australia\", a map that Flinders had constructed from all the information he had accumulated while he was in Australian waters and finished while he was detained by the French in [[Mauritius]].

Here he found that Banks did not approve of the name and had not unpacked the chart he had sent him, and that \"New Holland\" and \"Terra Australis\" were still in general use.  As a result, a book by Flinders was published under the title ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]'' and his published map of 1814 also shows 'Terra Australis' as the first of the two name options, despite his objections.  The final proofs were brought to him on his deathbed, but he was unconscious.  The book was published on 18 July 1814, but Flinders did not regain consciousness and died the next day, never knowing that his name for the continent would be accepted.<ref name=\"TheWeekend\">''The Weekend Australian'', 30 \u2013 31 December 2000, p. 16</ref>\n\n[[File:Bowen- A Complete map of the Southern Continent.jpg|thumb|1744 Chart of ''Hollandia Nova \u2013 Terra Australis'' by [[Emanuel Bowen]]]]\n\nBanks wrote a draft of an introduction to Flinders' ''Voyage'', referring to the map published by [[Melchis\u00e9dech Th\u00e9venot]] in ''Relations des Divers Voyages'' (1663), and made well-known to English readers by [[Emanuel Bowen]]'s adaptation of it, ''A Complete Map of the Southern Continent'', published in John Campbell's editions of John Harris's ''Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels'' (1744\u201348, and 1764).<ref>{{cite web|title=A Complete Map of the Southern Continent survey'd by Capt.

This appears from a chart by Thevenot in 1663, which he says \"was originally taken from that done in inlaid work upon the pavement of the new Stadt House at Amsterdam\". It is necessary, however, to geographical precision that the whole of this great body of land should be distinguished by one general term, and under the circumstances of the discovery of the different parts, the original Terra Australis has been judged the most proper.

In July 2014, on the 200-year anniversary of his death, a large bronze statue of Flinders by the sculptor Mark Richards was unveiled at [[Australia House]], London by [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]], and later installed at Euston station near the presumed location of his grave.<ref name=\"Miranda\" />\n\nFlinders' proposal<ref>Flinders (1805)</ref> for the use of iron bars to be used to compensate for the magnetic deviations caused by iron on board a ship resulted in their being known as [[Flinders bar]]s.\n\nFlinders, who was Sir [[John Franklin]]'s cousin by marriage, John's mother Hannah being the sister of Matthew's step mother Elizabeth, instilled in him a love for navigating and took him with him on his voyage aboard ''Investigator''.\n\nIn 1964 he was honoured on a [[postage stamp]] issued by [[Australia Post|Postmaster-General's Department]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0007630.jpg |title=Australia 10/- Stamp |publisher=Australianstamp.com |accessdate=25 October 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194711/http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0007630.jpg |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> again in 1980,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0012760.jpg |title=Australia 20c Stamp |publisher=Australianstamp.com |accessdate=25 October 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185326/http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0012760.jpg |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  and in 1998 with [[George Bass]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0033520.jpg |title=Australia 45c Stamp |publisher=Australianstamp.com |accessdate=25 October 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184411/http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0033520.jpg |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n''[[Flindersia]]'' is a genus of 14 species of tree in the [[Rutaceae|citrus family]].
