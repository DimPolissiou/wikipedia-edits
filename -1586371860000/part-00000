Another popular location for crowds to gather to see the fireworks display is the [[Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall]]. For the first three years (2004\u20132006), the annual fireworks show at Taipei 101 was preceded by the sequential display of numerals in lights on each section to count down the last eight seconds to midnight. Since 2007 the building has been completely darkened, then fireworks begin to launch sequentially from the lower to upper sections.\n* 2003\u20132004: Building still under construction. Spinning lights on the Outdoor Observatory (floor 91) provided a display of sound and lights, but no fireworks were launched.\n* 2004\u20132005: Grand opening of Taipei 101 celebrated with the first fireworks display. The show lasted 35 seconds. Rockets were launched from section balconies. Festivities included all-day performances by famous entertainers and ceremonial visits by national dignitaries.\n* 2005\u20132006: Show extended to 128 seconds. [[Sony]] sponsored the show, which concluded with a display of the brand name in lights.\n* 2006\u20132007: Show extended to 188 seconds; 9,000 rockets were launched. This was Sony's second time sponsoring the event.\n* 2007\u20132008: Show same length but featuring 12,000 rockets. Event Sponsor Taiwan Tourism Bureau ended the show with a display, in lights, of a heart over the word 'Taiwan'.\n* 2008\u20132009: A conspicuously more modest show than those which preceded it. The theme was \"Love Taiwan With Your Heart in 2009\". The show ended with the four sides of the building displaying lights in four colors (red, blue, green, and yellow) to represent happiness, vision, sustainability and passion.\n* 2009\u20132010: The display regained some of the dazzle of 2005\u20132008 shows but remained more brief in duration. The theme was \"Taiwan Up\".\n*2010\u20132011: Show extended to 288 seconds (100 sec. for flash effects and 188 sec. for fireworks), and designed by [[Cai Guo-Qiang]], the artist also responsible for Beijing Olympics and World Expo Shanghai's fireworks. The theme was \"100 ROC\" (100th anniversary of the [[Republic of China]]) which extended on the \"Love Taiwan\" theme. 2010 was also the year the Floral Expo was held in Taipei, and at Dajia Riverside Park there was another New Year's Eve event. It was a VIP event, but was broadcast simultaneously with the City Hall event. The display on the building was accompanied by fireworks going off other buildings in the Xinyi financial district. One concept was for fireworks to spiral up and down the building like [[dragon]] crawling, but technical difficulties caused some disappointment with what was anticipated (reported by the media to be more like \"a worm\"). It also took 30 seconds for the host to realize the fireworks were over.\n*2011\u20132012: The show was shortened to 202 seconds and was considered to be more conservative than that of the previous year, but featuring the largest number of rockets launched to date, totaling 30,000. The theme coincided with the 101st anniversary of the ROC. It also gained attention on YouTube, where viewers noticed an apparent \"[[UFO]]\" in the seconds before the fireworks started, later determined to be a radio-controlled glider with flashing lights.\n*2012\u20132013: The show was designed by the French pyrotechnics company Groupe F and was 198 seconds in length, featuring 22,000 rockets launched to an adaptation of Igor Stravinsky's ''[[The Firebird]]''. The theme was \"Swing for the Future\". The words \"Time for Taiwan\" (both in English and Mandarin Chinese) were displayed in lights at the building to promote Taiwan Tourism Bureau's current advertising campaign.\n*2013\u20132014: The show lasted 218 seconds and a thematic music was created for the first time by local musicians to commemorate Taipei 101's 10th anniversary. \n*2014\u20132015: Marked 10th anniversary since the official opening on 31 December 2004. The show performed for 218 seconds. iSee Taiwan Foundation sponsored the fireworks to promote the beauty of Taiwanese culture and creativity. The firework music was arranged by Taiwanese Golden Melody award winner \u2013 Mr. Lee, Che-Yi, blended with the famous classical song The four seasons by Vivaldi and many Taiwanese folk music. Performed and recorded by Taipei Symphony Orchestra. \n*2015\u20132016: It's the fourth time Group F designed the firework show for Taipei 101, with a green theme \"Nature is Future\" this year. The 238-second display was considered the longest performance ever. In addition to the most various and natural patterns of flowers, birds, seahorses, fishes, etc. were projected, 30,000 effects were one of the most to show. It's also the first time to have professional climbers to settle the firework racks onto the building fa\u00e7ades. Mr. Lee, Chi-Yi once again arranged the music mixed with international and Taiwanese rhythms reflecting the nature-related theme and Evergreen Symphony Orchestra played the role of performance. A young Taiwanese IT design company BungBungame became the exclusive sponsor supporting a symbolic event showing Taiwan to the world.\n*2020: Taipei 101 displayed a show with the theme of \"Light of Hope, Taiwan\", launching 16,000 fireworks at midnight. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3847975|title=Taipei 101 New Year's Eve fireworks displ...|last=News|first=Taiwan|website=Taiwan News|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Developments===\nThe Taipei Financial Center Corporation (TFCC) announced plans on 2 November 2009 to make Taipei 101 \"the world's tallest green building\" by summer of 2011 as measured by LEED standards. The structure is already designed to be energy-efficient, with double-pane windows blocking external heat by 50 percent and recycled water meeting 20\u201330 percent of the building's needs. LEED certification would entail inspections and upgrades in wiring, water and lighting equipment at a cost of NT$60&nbsp;million (US$1.8&nbsp;million).

Another popular location for crowds to gather to see the fireworks display is the [[Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall]]. For the first three years (2004\u20132006), the annual fireworks show at Taipei 101 was preceded by the sequential display of numerals in lights on each section to count down the last eight seconds to midnight. Since 2007 the building has been completely darkened, then fireworks begin to launch sequentially from the lower to upper sections.\n* 2003\u20132004: Building still under construction. Spinning lights on the Outdoor Observatory (floor 91) provided a display of sound and lights, but no fireworks were launched.\n* 2004\u20132005: Grand opening of Taipei 101 celebrated with the first fireworks display. The show lasted 35 seconds. Rockets were launched from section balconies. Festivities included all-day performances by famous entertainers and ceremonial visits by national dignitaries.\n* 2005\u20132006: Show extended to 128 seconds. [[Sony]] sponsored the show, which concluded with a display of the brand name in lights.\n* 2006\u20132007: Show extended to 188 seconds; 9,000 rockets were launched. This was Sony's second time sponsoring the event.\n* 2007\u20132008: Show same length but featuring 12,000 rockets. Event Sponsor Taiwan Tourism Bureau ended the show with a display, in lights, of a heart over the word 'Taiwan'.\n* 2008\u20132009: A conspicuously more modest show than those which preceded it. The theme was \"Love Taiwan With Your Heart in 2009\". The show ended with the four sides of the building displaying lights in four colors (red, blue, green, and yellow) to represent happiness, vision, sustainability and passion.\n* 2009\u20132010: The display regained some of the dazzle of 2005\u20132008 shows but remained more brief in duration. The theme was \"Taiwan Up\".\n*2010\u20132011: Show extended to 288 seconds (100 sec. for flash effects and 188 sec. for fireworks), and designed by [[Cai Guo-Qiang]], the artist also responsible for Beijing Olympics and World Expo Shanghai's fireworks. The theme was \"100 ROC\" (100th anniversary of the [[Republic of China]]) which extended on the \"Love Taiwan\" theme. 2010 was also the year the Floral Expo was held in Taipei, and at Dajia Riverside Park there was another New Year's Eve event. It was a VIP event, but was broadcast simultaneously with the City Hall event. The display on the building was accompanied by fireworks going off other buildings in the Xinyi financial district. One concept was for fireworks to spiral up and down the building like [[dragon]] crawling, but technical difficulties caused some disappointment with what was anticipated (reported by the media to be more like \"a worm\"). It also took 30 seconds for the host to realize the fireworks were over.\n*2011\u20132012: The show was shortened to 202 seconds and was considered to be more conservative than that of the previous year, but featuring the largest number of rockets launched to date, totaling 30,000. The theme coincided with the 101st anniversary of the ROC. It also gained attention on YouTube, where viewers noticed an apparent \"[[UFO]]\" in the seconds before the fireworks started, later determined to be a radio-controlled glider with flashing lights.\n*2012\u20132013: The show was designed by the French pyrotechnics company Groupe F and was 198 seconds in length, featuring 22,000 rockets launched to an adaptation of Igor Stravinsky's ''[[The Firebird]]''. The theme was \"Swing for the Future\". The words \"Time for Taiwan\" (both in English and Mandarin Chinese) were displayed in lights at the building to promote Taiwan Tourism Bureau's current advertising campaign.\n*2013\u20132014: The show lasted 218 seconds and a thematic music was created for the first time by local musicians to commemorate Taipei 101's 10th anniversary. \n*2014\u20132015: Marked 10th anniversary since the official opening on 31 December 2004. The show performed for 218 seconds. iSee Taiwan Foundation sponsored the fireworks to promote the beauty of Taiwanese culture and creativity. The firework music was arranged by Taiwanese Golden Melody award winner \u2013 Mr. Lee, Che-Yi, blended with the famous classical song The four seasons by Vivaldi and many Taiwanese folk music. Performed and recorded by Taipei Symphony Orchestra. \n*2015\u20132016: It's the fourth time Group F designed the firework show for Taipei 101, with a green theme \"Nature is Future\" this year. The 238-second display was considered the longest performance ever. In addition to the most various and natural patterns of flowers, birds, seahorses, fishes, etc. were projected, 30,000 effects were one of the most to show. It's also the first time to have professional climbers to settle the firework racks onto the building fa\u00e7ades. Mr. Lee, Chi-Yi once again arranged the music mixed with international and Taiwanese rhythms reflecting the nature-related theme and Evergreen Symphony Orchestra played the role of performance. A young Taiwanese IT design company BungBungame became the exclusive sponsor supporting a symbolic event showing Taiwan to the world.\n*2020: Taipei 101 displayed a show with the theme of \"Light of Hope, Taiwan\", launching 16,000 fireworks at midnight. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3847975|title=Taipei 101 New Year's Eve fireworks displ...|last=News|first=Taiwan|website=Taiwan News|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Developments===\nThe Taipei Financial Center Corporation (TFCC) announced plans on 2 November 2009 to make Taipei 101 \"the world's tallest green building\" by summer of 2011 as measured by LEED standards. The structure is already designed to be energy-efficient, with double-pane windows blocking external heat by 50 percent and recycled water meeting 20\u201330 percent of the building's needs. LEED certification would entail inspections and upgrades in wiring, water and lighting equipment at a cost of NT$60&nbsp;million (US$1.8&nbsp;million).

Of dramatically variable appearance and extreme [[sexual dimorphism]], they comprise the [[Taxonomic rank|superfamily]] '''Coccoidea'''.  Adult females typically have soft bodies and no limbs, and are concealed underneath domed scales, extruding quantities of wax for protection. Some species are hermaphroditic, with a combined ovotestis instead of separate ovaries and testes. Males, in the species where they occur, have legs and sometimes wings, and resemble small flies. Scale insects are [[herbivore]]s, piercing plant tissues with their mouthparts and remaining in one place, feeding on [[sap]]. The excess fluid they imbibe is secreted as [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]] on which sooty mold tends to grow. The insects often have a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic relationship]] with [[ant]]s, which feed on the honeydew and protect them from [[Predation|predators]]. There are about 8,000 described species.\n\nScale insects appeared in the [[Triassic]], before their modern food plants, the [[angiosperms]], had evolved; early forms probably fed on [[gymnosperm]]s. They became widespread and common in the [[Cretaceous]], and are well represented in the [[fossil record]], usually preserved in [[amber]] where they are sometimes associated with ants. Their closest relatives are the [[Psylloidea|jumping plant lice]], [[Whitefly|whiteflies]], [[Phylloxeroidea|phylloxera bugs]] and [[Aphididae|aphids]]. The majority of female scale insects remain in one place as adults, with newly hatched nymphs, known as \"crawlers\", being the only mobile life stage, apart from the short-lived males. The reproductive strategies of many species include at least some amount of [[asexual reproduction]] by [[parthenogenesis]].\n\nSome scale insects are serious commercial pests, notably the cottony cushion scale (''[[Icerya purchasi]]'') on ''[[Citrus]]'' fruit trees; they are difficult to control as the scale and waxy covering protect them effectively from contact insecticides. Some species are used for [[biological control]] of pest plants such as the prickly pear, ''[[Opuntia]]''. Others produce commercially valuable substances including [[carmine]] and [[kermes (dye)|kermes]] dyes, and [[shellac]] lacquer. Both the red colour-names [[crimson]] and [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]] derive from kermes products.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Armored scale insects.png|thumb|right|Armoured scale insects:(A) ''Lepidosaphes gloverii'', adult females. (B) ''Parlatoria oleae'', adult females (circular, with dark spot) and immatures (oblong). (C) ''Diaspidiotus juglansregiae'', adult female walnut scale with waxy scale cover removed.]]\nScale insects vary dramatically in appearance, from very small organisms (1\u20132&nbsp;mm) that grow beneath [[wax]] covers (some shaped like oysters, others like mussel shells), to shiny pearl-like objects (about 5&nbsp;mm), to animals covered with mealy wax. Adult females are almost always immobile (apart from [[mealybug]]s) and permanently attached to the plant on which they are feeding.  They secrete a waxy coating for defence, making them resemble [[scale (zoology)|reptilian or fish scales]], and giving them their common name.<ref name=Capinera/>\n\nThe group is extremely [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]; female scale insects, unusually for Hemiptera, retain the immature external morphology even when sexually mature, a condition known as [[neoteny]]. Adult females are pear-shaped, elliptical or circular, with no wings, and usually no constriction separating the head from the body. Segmentation of the body is indistinct, but may be indicated by the presence of marginal bristles. Legs are absent in the females of some families, and when present vary from single segment stubs to five-segmented limbs. Female scale insects have no compound eyes, but [[Simple eye in invertebrates#Ocelli or eye spots|ocelli]] (simple eyes) are sometimes present in [[Margarodidae]], [[Ortheziidae]] and [[Phenacoleachiidae]]. The family [[Beesoniidae]] lacks [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]], but other families possess antennae with from one to thirteen segments. The mouthparts are adapted for piercing and sucking.<ref name=Capinera/>\n\nAdult males in contrast have the typical head, thorax and abdomen of other insect groups, and are so different from females that pairing them as a species is challenging. They are usually slender insects resembling [[aphid]]s or small [[Fly|flies]]. They have antennae with nine or ten segments, compound eyes (Margarodidae and Ortheziidae) or simple eyes (most other families), and legs with five segments.\nMost species have wings, and in some, alternate generations may be winged or wingless. Adult males do not feed, and die within two or three days of emergence.<ref name=Capinera>{{cite book |author=Capinera, John L. |title=Encyclopedia of Entomology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&pg=PA3263 |year=2008 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-1-4020-6242-1 |pages=3263\u20133272}}</ref>\n\nIn species with winged males, generally only the forewings are fully functional. This is unusual among insects; it most closely resembles the situation in the [[fly|true flies]], the Diptera. However, the Diptera and Hemiptera are not closely related, and do not closely resemble each other in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]; for example, the tail filaments of the Coccoidea do not resemble anything in the morphology of flies. The hind ([[Metathorax|metathoracic]]) wings are reduced, commonly to the point that they can easily be overlooked. In some species the hind wings have [[hamuli]], hooklets, that couple the hind wings to the main wings, as in the [[Hymenoptera]]. The [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] wings are often reduced to pseudo-[[halteres]], club-like appendages, but these are not [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] with the control organs of Diptera, and it is not clear whether they have any substantial control function.<ref>{{cite book |author=Dhooria, Manjit S.|title=Ane's Encyclopedic Dictionary of General & Applied Entomology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ybNCAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 |year=2009 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-1-4020-8644-1 |page=198}}</ref>\n\n[[Hermaphrodite|Hermaphroditism]] is very rare in insects, but several species of ''[[Icerya]]'' exhibit an unusual form. The adult possesses an ovotestis, consisting of both female and male reproductive tissue, and sperm is transmitted to the young for their future use.

In more primitive families there is an additional instar stage. Males pass through a first and second instar stage, a pre-pupal and a pupal stage before adulthood.<ref name=Capinera/>\n\nThe first instars of most species of scale insects emerge from the egg with functional legs, and are informally called \"crawlers\". They immediately crawl around in search of a suitable spot to settle down and feed. In some species they delay settling down either until they are starving, or until they have been blown away by wind onto what presumably is another plant, where they may establish a new colony. There are many variations on such themes, such as scale insects that are associated with species of ants that act as herders and carry the young ones to protected sites to feed. In either case, many such species of crawlers, when they moult, lose the use of their legs if they are female, and stay put for life. Only the males retain legs, and in some species wings, and use them in seeking females. To do this they usually walk, as their ability to fly is limited, but they may get carried to new locations by the wind.<ref name=Capinera/>\n\n[[File:EB1911 Hemiptera - Fig. 12.\u2014Apple Scale Insect.jpg|thumb|left|Apple scale. a) male, with legs and wings c) larva e) immobile female (removed from scale)]]\n\nBesides [[sexual reproduction]], a number of different forms of reproductive systems are employed, including [[asexual reproduction]] by [[parthenogenesis]]. In some species, sexual and asexual populations are found in different locations, and in general, species with a wide geographic range and a diversity of plant hosts are more likely to be asexual. Large population size is hypothesized to protect an asexual population from becoming extinct, but nevertheless, parthenogenesis is uncommon among scale insects, with the most widespread generalist feeders reproducing sexually, the majority of these being pest species.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ross, Laura; Hardy, Nate B.; Okusu, Akiko; Normark, Benjamin B. |year=2013 |title=Large population size predicts the distribution of sexuality in scale insects |journal=Evolution |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=196\u2013206 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01784.x |pmid=23289572 }}</ref>\n\nAdult females of the families Margarodidae, Ortheziidae and Pseudococcidae are mobile and can move to other parts of the host plant or even adjoining plants, but the mobile period is limited to a short period between moults. Some of these overwinter in crevices in the bark or among plant litter, moving in spring to tender young growth. However, the majority of female scale insects are sedentary as adults. Their dispersal ability depends on how far a crawler can crawl before it needs to shed its skin and start feeding. There are various strategies for dealing with deciduous trees. On these, males often feed on the leaves, usually beside the veins, while females select the twigs. Where there are several generations in the year, there may be a general retreat onto the twigs as fall approaches. On branches, the underside is usually preferred as giving protection against predation and adverse weather. The [[Phenacoccus solenopsis|solenopsis mealybug]] feeds on the foliage of its host in summer and the roots in winter, and large numbers of scale species feed invisibly, year-round on roots.<ref name=Capinera/>\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Scale Insects (2127992762).jpg|thumb|upright|A cluster of scale insects on a stem]]\n\nScale insects are an ancient group, having originated in the [[Cretaceous]], the period in which [[angiosperm]]s came to dominance among plants, with only a few groups species found on [[gymnosperm]]s.

Of dramatically variable appearance and extreme [[sexual dimorphism]], they comprise the [[Taxonomic rank|superfamily]] '''Coccoidea'''.  Adult females typically have soft bodies and no limbs, and are concealed underneath domed scales, extruding quantities of wax for protection. Some species are hermaphroditic, with a combined ovotestis instead of separate ovaries and testes. Males, in the species where they occur, have legs and sometimes wings, and resemble small flies. Scale insects are [[herbivore]]s, piercing plant tissues with their mouthparts and remaining in one place, feeding on [[sap]]. The excess fluid they imbibe is secreted as [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]] on which sooty mold tends to grow. The insects often have a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic relationship]] with [[ant]]s, which feed on the honeydew and protect them from [[Predation|predators]]. There are about 8,000 described species.\n\nScale insects appeared in the [[Triassic]], before their modern food plants, the [[angiosperms]], had evolved; early forms probably fed on [[gymnosperm]]s. They became widespread and common in the [[Cretaceous]], and are well represented in the [[fossil record]], usually preserved in [[amber]] where they are sometimes associated with ants. Their closest relatives are the [[Psylloidea|jumping plant lice]], [[Whitefly|whiteflies]], [[Phylloxeroidea|phylloxera bugs]] and [[Aphididae|aphids]]. The majority of female scale insects remain in one place as adults, with newly hatched nymphs, known as \"crawlers\", being the only mobile life stage, apart from the short-lived males. The reproductive strategies of many species include at least some amount of [[asexual reproduction]] by [[parthenogenesis]].\n\nSome scale insects are serious commercial pests, notably the cottony cushion scale (''[[Icerya purchasi]]'') on ''[[Citrus]]'' fruit trees; they are difficult to control as the scale and waxy covering protect them effectively from contact insecticides. Some species are used for [[biological control]] of pest plants such as the prickly pear, ''[[Opuntia]]''. Others produce commercially valuable substances including [[carmine]] and [[kermes (dye)|kermes]] dyes, and [[shellac]] lacquer. Both the red colour-names [[crimson]] and [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]] derive from kermes products.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Armored scale insects.png|thumb|right|Armoured scale insects:(A) ''Lepidosaphes gloverii'', adult females. (B) ''Parlatoria oleae'', adult females (circular, with dark spot) and immatures (oblong). (C) ''Diaspidiotus juglansregiae'', adult female walnut scale with waxy scale cover removed.]]\nScale insects vary dramatically in appearance, from very small organisms (1\u20132&nbsp;mm) that grow beneath [[wax]] covers (some shaped like oysters, others like mussel shells), to shiny pearl-like objects (about 5&nbsp;mm), to animals covered with mealy wax. Adult females are almost always immobile (apart from [[mealybug]]s) and permanently attached to the plant on which they are feeding.  They secrete a waxy coating for defence, making them resemble [[scale (zoology)|reptilian or fish scales]], and giving them their common name.<ref name=Capinera/>\n\nThe group is extremely [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]; female scale insects, unusually for Hemiptera, retain the immature external morphology even when sexually mature, a condition known as [[neoteny]]. Adult females are pear-shaped, elliptical or circular, with no wings, and usually no constriction separating the head from the body. Segmentation of the body is indistinct, but may be indicated by the presence of marginal bristles. Legs are absent in the females of some families, and when present vary from single segment stubs to five-segmented limbs. Female scale insects have no compound eyes, but [[Simple eye in invertebrates#Ocelli or eye spots|ocelli]] (simple eyes) are sometimes present in [[Margarodidae]], [[Ortheziidae]] and [[Phenacoleachiidae]]. The family [[Beesoniidae]] lacks [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]], but other families possess antennae with from one to thirteen segments. The mouthparts are adapted for piercing and sucking.<ref name=Capinera/>\n\nAdult males in contrast have the typical head, thorax and abdomen of other insect groups, and are so different from females that pairing them as a species is challenging. They are usually slender insects resembling [[aphid]]s or small [[Fly|flies]]. They have antennae with nine or ten segments, compound eyes (Margarodidae and Ortheziidae) or simple eyes (most other families), and legs with five segments.\nMost species have wings, and in some, alternate generations may be winged or wingless. Adult males do not feed, and die within two or three days of emergence.<ref name=Capinera>{{cite book |author=Capinera, John L. |title=Encyclopedia of Entomology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&pg=PA3263 |year=2008 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-1-4020-6242-1 |pages=3263\u20133272}}</ref>\n\nIn species with winged males, generally only the forewings are fully functional. This is unusual among insects; it most closely resembles the situation in the [[fly|true flies]], the Diptera. However, the Diptera and Hemiptera are not closely related, and do not closely resemble each other in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]; for example, the tail filaments of the Coccoidea do not resemble anything in the morphology of flies. The hind ([[Metathorax|metathoracic]]) wings are reduced, commonly to the point that they can easily be overlooked. In some species the hind wings have [[hamuli]], hooklets, that couple the hind wings to the main wings, as in the [[Hymenoptera]]. The [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] wings are often reduced to pseudo-[[halteres]], club-like appendages, but these are not [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] with the control organs of Diptera, and it is not clear whether they have any substantial control function.<ref>{{cite book |author=Dhooria, Manjit S.|title=Ane's Encyclopedic Dictionary of General & Applied Entomology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ybNCAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 |year=2009 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-1-4020-8644-1 |page=198}}</ref>\n\n[[Hermaphrodite|Hermaphroditism]] is very rare in insects, but several species of ''[[Icerya]]'' exhibit an unusual form. The adult possesses an ovotestis, consisting of both female and male reproductive tissue, and sperm is transmitted to the young for their future use. The fact that a new population can be founded by a single individual may have contributed to the success of the [[Icerya purchasi|cottony cushion scale]] which has spread around the world.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1086/660823| pmid=21750383| title=The Evolution of Hermaphroditism by an Infectious Male-Derived Cell Lineage: An Inclusive-Fitness Analysis| journal=The American Naturalist| volume=178| issue=2| pages=191\u2013201| year=2011| last1=Gardner | first1=A. | last2=Ross | first2=L. | url=https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/67294482/660823.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Life cycle==\n[[File:EB1911 Hemiptera - Fig. 13.\u2014Apple Scale Insect (Mytilaspis pomorum).jpg|thumb|Life-cycle of the [[apple]] scale, ''Mytilaspis pomorum''. a) underside of scale showing female and eggs, x24 b) scale upperside, x24 c) female scales on twig d) male scale x12 e) male scales on twig]]\n\nFemale scale insects in more advanced families develop from the egg through a first [[instar]] (crawler) stage and a second instar stage before becoming adult. In more primitive families there is an additional instar stage. Males pass through a first and second instar stage, a pre-pupal and a pupal stage before adulthood.<ref name=Capinera/>\n\nThe first instars of most species of scale insects emerge from the egg with functional legs, and are informally called \"crawlers\". They immediately crawl around in search of a suitable spot to settle down and feed. In some species they delay settling down either until they are starving, or until they have been blown away by wind onto what presumably is another plant, where they may establish a new colony. There are many variations on such themes, such as scale insects that are associated with species of ants that act as herders and carry the young ones to protected sites to feed. In either case, many such species of crawlers, when they moult, lose the use of their legs if they are female, and stay put for life. Only the males retain legs, and in some species wings, and use them in seeking females. To do this they usually walk, as their ability to fly is limited, but they may get carried to new locations by the wind.<ref name=Capinera/>\n\n[[File:EB1911 Hemiptera - Fig. 12.\u2014Apple Scale Insect.jpg|thumb|left|Apple scale. a) male, with legs and wings c) larva e) immobile female (removed from scale)]]\n\nBesides [[sexual reproduction]], a number of different forms of reproductive systems are employed, including [[asexual reproduction]] by [[parthenogenesis]]. In some species, sexual and asexual populations are found in different locations, and in general, species with a wide geographic range and a diversity of plant hosts are more likely to be asexual. Large population size is hypothesized to protect an asexual population from becoming extinct, but nevertheless, parthenogenesis is uncommon among scale insects, with the most widespread generalist feeders reproducing sexually, the majority of these being pest species.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ross, Laura; Hardy, Nate B.; Okusu, Akiko; Normark, Benjamin B. |year=2013 |title=Large population size predicts the distribution of sexuality in scale insects |journal=Evolution |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=196\u2013206 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01784.x |pmid=23289572 }}</ref>\n\nAdult females of the families Margarodidae, Ortheziidae and Pseudococcidae are mobile and can move to other parts of the host plant or even adjoining plants, but the mobile period is limited to a short period between moults. Some of these overwinter in crevices in the bark or among plant litter, moving in spring to tender young growth. However, the majority of female scale insects are sedentary as adults. Their dispersal ability depends on how far a crawler can crawl before it needs to shed its skin and start feeding. There are various strategies for dealing with deciduous trees. On these, males often feed on the leaves, usually beside the veins, while females select the twigs. Where there are several generations in the year, there may be a general retreat onto the twigs as fall approaches. On branches, the underside is usually preferred as giving protection against predation and adverse weather. The [[Phenacoccus solenopsis|solenopsis mealybug]] feeds on the foliage of its host in summer and the roots in winter, and large numbers of scale species feed invisibly, year-round on roots.<ref name=Capinera/>\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Scale Insects (2127992762).jpg|thumb|upright|A cluster of scale insects on a stem]]\n\nScale insects are an ancient group, having originated in the [[Cretaceous]], the period in which [[angiosperm]]s came to dominance among plants, with only a few groups species found on [[gymnosperm]]s. They feed on a wide variety of plants but are unable to survive long away from their hosts. While some specialise on a single plant species (monophagous), and some on a single genus or plant family (oligophagous), others are less specialised and feed on several plant groups (polyphagous).<ref name=Capinera/> For example, [[Dactylopiidae|cochineal species]] are restricted to cactus hosts, and the gall-inducing ''[[Apiomorpha]]'' are restricted to ''[[Eucalyptus]]''.

Here the mealybugs are safe from predation and environmental hazards, while the ants have a source of nourishment.<ref name=Capinera/> Another species of ant maintains a herd of scale insects inside the hollow stems of a ''[[Barteria]]'' tree; the scale insects feed on the sap and the ants, while benefiting from the honeydew, drive away other herbivorous insects from the tree as well as preventing vines from smothering it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=H\u00f6lldobler |first1=Bert |last2=Wilson |first2=Edward O. |author2link=E.

They showed that the main scale insect lineages diverged before their angiosperm hosts, and suggested that the insects switched from feeding on gymnosperms once the angiosperms became common and widespread in the Cretaceous. The Coccomorpha appeared at the start of the [[Triassic]] period, some 245 [[Million years ago|mya]]; the neococcoids some 185 mya. Scale insects are very well represented in the fossil record, being abundantly preserved in [[amber]] from the Early Cretaceous, 130 mya, onwards; they were already highly diversified by Cretaceous times. All the families were monophyletic except for the [[Eriococcidae]]. The traditional division into \"Archaeococcoids\" and \"Neococcoids\" is preserved except that the genus ''Pityococcus'' is moved to the \"Neococcoids\".
