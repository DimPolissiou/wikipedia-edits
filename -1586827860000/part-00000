It is the fifth installment in the [[Saw (film series)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars [[Scott Patterson]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Tobin Bell]], [[Betsy Russell]], [[Mark Rolston]], [[Julie Benz]], [[Meagan Good]], and [[Carlo Rota]].\n\nDavid Hackl served as the production designer of ''[[Saw II]]'', ''[[Saw III]]'', and ''[[Saw IV]]'' and second-unit director for ''Saw III'' and ''Saw IV'' before making his directorial debut with ''Saw V''.<ref>[http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/9373 SAW V and SAW VI Director Already Signed!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205065713/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/9373 |date=December 5, 2007 }}, [[Bloody Disgusting]]. Retrieved 2007 \u2013 December 4.</ref> Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, the writers of the previous film, returned to write the film. [[Charlie Clouser]], who provided the score for all previous ''Saw'' films, also returned to compose the score for the film. ''Saw'' creators [[James Wan]] and [[Leigh Whannell]] served as executive producers.\n\n''Saw V'' was released in the United States on October 24, 2008, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. The film focuses primarily on the events that led up to Detective [[Mark Hoffman]] becoming an apprentice of the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]], as well as his efforts to prevent anyone else from learning his secret. A sequel, titled ''[[Saw VI]]'', was released in 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nConvicted murderer Seth Baxter wakes up chained to a table beneath a [[pendulum]] blade. A videotape informs him that he can release himself by crushing his hands between two presses. He does so, but the blade still swings down and cuts him in half as someone watches through a hole in the wall.\n\nIn [[Saw IV|the meatpacking plant]], FBI Agent Peter Strahm shoots Jeff Denlon and is locked in the sickroom. He discovers a hidden exit and a [[microcassette]] recorder, which urges him to stay in the sickroom, but he ignores it and is attacked in the tunnel by someone in a pig mask. He wakes up with his head sealed in a box being filled with water, but survives by performing a [[tracheotomy]] with his pen. Outside, Detective [[Mark Hoffman]] delivers Corbett Denlon to the police and claims they are the only survivors, but is shocked when Strahm is brought out alive as well.\n\nDuring a press conference, Hoffman is promoted to detective lieutenant and credited with closing the case. He finds a note in his office that reads \"I know who you are\", and learns of Lindsey Perez's death while taking Strahm's phone. At the hospital, Strahm tells Hoffman that Perez's last words were \"Detective Hoffman\" and questions how he escaped the plant. Strahm is also visited by his boss, Dan Erickson, who puts him on medical leave. Now suspicious of Hoffman and determined to piece together his involvement with Jigsaw, Strahm takes case files of past victims and begins researching them on his own.\n\nIn an underground room, five people awaken with collars connected to mounted blades locked around their necks, the keys to which are in individual glass boxes across the room. A videotape says that all five of them are connected, and implores them to \"do the opposite\" of their instincts throughout the game. They are also told to solve the puzzles and leave the rooms before the timer runs out, and the jars of explosives in each corner of the rooms will explode. Mallick, an arsonist, activates the timer and everyone must reach for their key, but the wires are connected to the other participants, so they must go one at a time. Everyone manages to reach their keys except for Ashley, a former fire inspector, who is decapitated when the collars retract. The four proceed to the next room, where they learn that the overhead jars contain keys to three bomb shelters. Charles, an investigative journalist, strikes Mallick and begins smashing the jars one by one. Brit, a real estate vice president, and Luba, a city planner, each find a key and Charles takes Mallick's, only to be struck by Luba and left to die when the bombs detonate. In the third room, five short cables must be connected to a full bathtub to unlock the door. They deduce that someone will have to stay in the bathtub while the other two escape, so Luba attacks Mallick to use his body to close the circuits, but Brit stabs her and they use her body to open the door. In the fourth room, Mallick and Brit find a machine fitted with five circular saws and a beaker requiring ten pints of blood to open the door. Brit tries to use the keys from the first room to open the door, but sees all the keys are the same, Mallick notes the five holes and they realize that all five of them were meant to work together to survive the game: in the first room, they could have used the keys on each other to unlock the collars, in the second room the bomb shelters were big enough for more than one person, and in the third room they all needed to attach a cable to themselves, which would open the door. Brit also works out their connection: they were all involved with a building fire that killed eight people. With no other options, they saw their arms to provide the blood needed to leave the room.\n\nMeanwhile, Strahm learns that Baxter killed Hoffman's sister, and was released from prison on a technicality. As revenge, Hoffman abducted and killed Baxter, using the pendulum trap to frame Jigsaw. It is revealed through flashbacks that he was later abducted by John Kramer, who blackmailed Hoffman into working with him. They set up most of the games together, with Hoffman planting Lawrence Gordon's penlight and providing the police files for the nerve gas house victims. Strahm realizes in the end that everyone was meant to die in the plant except for Corbett and Hoffman, who would appear to be a hero. His activities soon draw Erickson's concern, which is further fueled when Jill, who received a box and a videotape from John's will, approaches Erickson and claims Strahm is stalking her. After Hoffman calls Erickson to tell him about Strahm's theory of a second accomplice, Erickson tries to call Strahm but Hoffman, having Strahm's cellphone, turns it off. After trying to reach Strahm but no avail, Erickson puts a tracker on Strahm's cellphone.\n\nErickson follows the tracker to the observation room and finds the cellphone and his own personnel file, which were planted by Hoffman. He also finds Brit, who managed to crawl from the fourth room after Mallick passed out from blood loss. Erickson calls for medical attention for the victims, and puts out an [[all-points bulletin]] on Strahm. Meanwhile, Strahm follows Hoffman to the [[Saw II|renovated nerve gas house]] and finds an underground room containing a clear box filled with shards of broken glass. Hoffman's tape urges Strahm to enter the box, but he stops it short and ambushes Hoffman. After a brief struggle he seals Hoffman in the box, which seals the room's exit. Hoffman points to the tape, which warns Strahm that if he does not enter the box he will die and Jigsaw's legacy will become his. The box is safely lowered into the floor as the walls close in on Strahm, who unsuccessfully attempts to escape through the ceiling grid, and is crushed to death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Details|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw cast members|List of Saw characters}}\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as [[Mark Hoffman|Detective Mark Hoffman]]\n* [[Scott Patterson]] as [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Agent Peter Strahm]]\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]]\n* [[Betsy Russell]] as [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]]\n* [[Julie Benz]] as [[List of Saw characters#Brit|Brit]]\n* [[Meagan Good]] as [[List of Saw characters#Luba Gibbs|Luba Gibbs]]\n* [[Mark Rolston]] as [[List of Saw characters#Dan Erickson|Agent Dan Erickson]]\n* [[Carlo Rota]] as [[List of Saw characters#Charles|Charles]]\n* [[Greg Bryk]] as [[List of Saw characters#Mallick|Mallick]]\n* Laura Gordon as [[List of Saw characters#Ashley|Ashley]]\n* [[Joris Jarsky]] as [[List of Saw characters#Seth Baxter|Seth Baxter]]\n* Mike Butters as [[List of Saw characters#Paul Leahy|Paul Leahy]]\n* [[Al Sapienza]] as Chief of Police\n* [[Niamh Wilson]] as [[List of Saw characters#Corbett Denlon|Corbett Denlon]]\n* Mike Realba as [[List of Saw characters#Fisk|Detective Fisk]]\n* Samantha Lemole as [[List of Saw characters#Pamela Jenkins|Pamela Jenkins]]\n* Sarah Power as [[List of Saw characters#Angelina Acombe|Angelina Acombe]]\n* Tim Burd as [[List of Saw characters#Obi Tate|Obi Tate]]\n* [[Tony Nappo]] as [[List of Saw characters#Gus Colyard|Gus Colyard]]\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Detective Eric Matthews]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Saw V'' was written by [[Patrick Melton]] and [[Marcus Dunstan]],<ref name= \"LionsgatePubSawV\">[http://lionsgatepublicity.com/index_flash.html Lions Gate Publicity lists Saw V for October 24, 2008]</ref><ref name= \"igninterview\">[http://movies.ign.com/articles/830/830917p1.html IGN.com interview with Patrick Melton]</ref> and the film went into production after Christmas 2007.<ref name= \"moviesonline\">[http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13210.html SAW 5 Shooting This Xmas].

The series began with two major assets that set it apart: the concept of a brilliantly righteous executioner, and the actor who played him.

The film stars [[Scott Patterson]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Tobin Bell]], [[Betsy Russell]], [[Mark Rolston]], [[Julie Benz]], [[Meagan Good]], and [[Carlo Rota]].\n\nDavid Hackl served as the production designer of ''[[Saw II]]'', ''[[Saw III]]'', and ''[[Saw IV]]'' and second-unit director for ''Saw III'' and ''Saw IV'' before making his directorial debut with ''Saw V''.<ref>[http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/9373 SAW V and SAW VI Director Already Signed!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205065713/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/9373 |date=December 5, 2007 }}, [[Bloody Disgusting]]. Retrieved 2007 \u2013 December 4.</ref> Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, the writers of the previous film, returned to write the film. [[Charlie Clouser]], who provided the score for all previous ''Saw'' films, also returned to compose the score for the film. ''Saw'' creators [[James Wan]] and [[Leigh Whannell]] served as executive producers.\n\n''Saw V'' was released in the United States on October 24, 2008, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. The film focuses primarily on the events that led up to Detective [[Mark Hoffman]] becoming an apprentice of the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]], as well as his efforts to prevent anyone else from learning his secret. A sequel, titled ''[[Saw VI]]'', was released in 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nConvicted murderer Seth Baxter wakes up chained to a table beneath a [[pendulum]] blade. A videotape informs him that he can release himself by crushing his hands between two presses. He does so, but the blade still swings down and cuts him in half as someone watches through a hole in the wall.\n\nIn [[Saw IV|the meatpacking plant]], FBI Agent Peter Strahm shoots Jeff Denlon and is locked in the sickroom. He discovers a hidden exit and a [[microcassette]] recorder, which urges him to stay in the sickroom, but he ignores it and is attacked in the tunnel by someone in a pig mask. He wakes up with his head sealed in a box being filled with water, but survives by performing a [[tracheotomy]] with his pen. Outside, Detective [[Mark Hoffman]] delivers Corbett Denlon to the police and claims they are the only survivors, but is shocked when Strahm is brought out alive as well.\n\nDuring a press conference, Hoffman is promoted to detective lieutenant and credited with closing the case. He finds a note in his office that reads \"I know who you are\", and learns of Lindsey Perez's death while taking Strahm's phone. At the hospital, Strahm tells Hoffman that Perez's last words were \"Detective Hoffman\" and questions how he escaped the plant. Strahm is also visited by his boss, Dan Erickson, who puts him on medical leave. Now suspicious of Hoffman and determined to piece together his involvement with Jigsaw, Strahm takes case files of past victims and begins researching them on his own.\n\nIn an underground room, five people awaken with collars connected to mounted blades locked around their necks, the keys to which are in individual glass boxes across the room. A videotape says that all five of them are connected, and implores them to \"do the opposite\" of their instincts throughout the game. They are also told to solve the puzzles and leave the rooms before the timer runs out, and the jars of explosives in each corner of the rooms will explode. Mallick, an arsonist, activates the timer and everyone must reach for their key, but the wires are connected to the other participants, so they must go one at a time. Everyone manages to reach their keys except for Ashley, a former fire inspector, who is decapitated when the collars retract. The four proceed to the next room, where they learn that the overhead jars contain keys to three bomb shelters. Charles, an investigative journalist, strikes Mallick and begins smashing the jars one by one. Brit, a real estate vice president, and Luba, a city planner, each find a key and Charles takes Mallick's, only to be struck by Luba and left to die when the bombs detonate. In the third room, five short cables must be connected to a full bathtub to unlock the door. They deduce that someone will have to stay in the bathtub while the other two escape, so Luba attacks Mallick to use his body to close the circuits, but Brit stabs her and they use her body to open the door. In the fourth room, Mallick and Brit find a machine fitted with five circular saws and a beaker requiring ten pints of blood to open the door. Brit tries to use the keys from the first room to open the door, but sees all the keys are the same, Mallick notes the five holes and they realize that all five of them were meant to work together to survive the game: in the first room, they could have used the keys on each other to unlock the collars, in the second room the bomb shelters were big enough for more than one person, and in the third room they all needed to attach a cable to themselves, which would open the door. Brit also works out their connection: they were all involved with a building fire that killed eight people. With no other options, they saw their arms to provide the blood needed to leave the room.\n\nMeanwhile, Strahm learns that Baxter killed Hoffman's sister, and was released from prison on a technicality. As revenge, Hoffman abducted and killed Baxter, using the pendulum trap to frame Jigsaw. It is revealed through flashbacks that he was later abducted by John Kramer, who blackmailed Hoffman into working with him. They set up most of the games together, with Hoffman planting Lawrence Gordon's penlight and providing the police files for the nerve gas house victims. Strahm realizes in the end that everyone was meant to die in the plant except for Corbett and Hoffman, who would appear to be a hero. His activities soon draw Erickson's concern, which is further fueled when Jill, who received a box and a videotape from John's will, approaches Erickson and claims Strahm is stalking her. After Hoffman calls Erickson to tell him about Strahm's theory of a second accomplice, Erickson tries to call Strahm but Hoffman, having Strahm's cellphone, turns it off. After trying to reach Strahm but no avail, Erickson puts a tracker on Strahm's cellphone.\n\nErickson follows the tracker to the observation room and finds the cellphone and his own personnel file, which were planted by Hoffman. He also finds Brit, who managed to crawl from the fourth room after Mallick passed out from blood loss. Erickson calls for medical attention for the victims, and puts out an [[all-points bulletin]] on Strahm. Meanwhile, Strahm follows Hoffman to the [[Saw II|renovated nerve gas house]] and finds an underground room containing a clear box filled with shards of broken glass. Hoffman's tape urges Strahm to enter the box, but he stops it short and ambushes Hoffman. After a brief struggle he seals Hoffman in the box, which seals the room's exit. Hoffman points to the tape, which warns Strahm that if he does not enter the box he will die and Jigsaw's legacy will become his. The box is safely lowered into the floor as the walls close in on Strahm, who unsuccessfully attempts to escape through the ceiling grid, and is crushed to death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Details|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw cast members|List of Saw characters}}\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as [[Mark Hoffman|Detective Mark Hoffman]]\n* [[Scott Patterson]] as [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Agent Peter Strahm]]\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]]\n* [[Betsy Russell]] as [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]]\n* [[Julie Benz]] as [[List of Saw characters#Brit|Brit]]\n* [[Meagan Good]] as [[List of Saw characters#Luba Gibbs|Luba Gibbs]]\n* [[Mark Rolston]] as [[List of Saw characters#Dan Erickson|Agent Dan Erickson]]\n* [[Carlo Rota]] as [[List of Saw characters#Charles|Charles]]\n* [[Greg Bryk]] as [[List of Saw characters#Mallick|Mallick]]\n* Laura Gordon as [[List of Saw characters#Ashley|Ashley]]\n* [[Joris Jarsky]] as [[List of Saw characters#Seth Baxter|Seth Baxter]]\n* Mike Butters as [[List of Saw characters#Paul Leahy|Paul Leahy]]\n* [[Al Sapienza]] as Chief of Police\n* [[Niamh Wilson]] as [[List of Saw characters#Corbett Denlon|Corbett Denlon]]\n* Mike Realba as [[List of Saw characters#Fisk|Detective Fisk]]\n* Samantha Lemole as [[List of Saw characters#Pamela Jenkins|Pamela Jenkins]]\n* Sarah Power as [[List of Saw characters#Angelina Acombe|Angelina Acombe]]\n* Tim Burd as [[List of Saw characters#Obi Tate|Obi Tate]]\n* [[Tony Nappo]] as [[List of Saw characters#Gus Colyard|Gus Colyard]]\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Detective Eric Matthews]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Saw V'' was written by [[Patrick Melton]] and [[Marcus Dunstan]],<ref name= \"LionsgatePubSawV\">[http://lionsgatepublicity.com/index_flash.html Lions Gate Publicity lists Saw V for October 24, 2008]</ref><ref name= \"igninterview\">[http://movies.ign.com/articles/830/830917p1.html IGN.com interview with Patrick Melton]</ref> and the film went into production after Christmas 2007.<ref name= \"moviesonline\">[http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13210.html SAW 5 Shooting This Xmas].

The series began with two major assets that set it apart: the concept of a brilliantly righteous executioner, and the actor who played him.

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man.<ref>This sentence is phrased awkwardly.\n\n1. \"Parker's Back\" doesn't take place in Georgia. The setting of \"Parker's Back\" is in Georgia. (This adds clarity to the sentence).\n\n<br /></ref>Later, he developes a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker dislikes Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt the wonder and awe he desired; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare area for a tattoo was on his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed. In the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nWhen he arrives home, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions. The book that's in the hands seems to be a gospel book, and it has some jewels on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\nParker\u2019s tattoo of the Byzantine Christ helps him to see the deeper mysteries of God. When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. O'Connor is known to use irony throughout her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of getting a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them.

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man.<ref>This sentence is phrased awkwardly.\n\n1. \"Parker's Back\" doesn't take place in Georgia. The setting of \"Parker's Back\" is in Georgia. (This adds clarity to the sentence).\n\n<br /></ref>Later, he developes a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker dislikes Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt the wonder and awe he desired; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare area for a tattoo was on his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed. In the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nWhen he arrives home, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions. The book that's in the hands seems to be a gospel book, and it has some jewels on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\nParker\u2019s tattoo of the Byzantine Christ helps him to see the deeper mysteries of God. When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of getting a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are reflections of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "name_user": "Beilbacher", "label": "safe", "comment": "\"Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories.\" This sentence can be put into simpler terms/wording.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker%27s_Back"}

There are also several claims that \"lost\" relatives such as a supposed Colonel '''Hugh Wynn''' who is alleged to have moved to [[Virginia]] and raised a family. However, with no clear heir, Sir John bequeathed the entire Wynnstay estate to Jane Thelwall (great-granddaughter of [[Sir John Wynn, 1st Baronet]]) who was now married to [[Sir William Williams, 2nd Baronet, of Gray's Inn|Sir William Williams, 2nd Baronet]] (c. 1665 \u2013 20 October 1740). Sir John Wynn and Sir William Williams were the two largest landowners in north Wales at that time and together the combined estate dwarfed all others. In honour of his wife's ancestry Sir William Williams changed his name to Sir William Williams-Wynn of Wynnstay.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nThe current baronet is [[Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 11th Baronet|Sir David Watkin Williams-Wynn, 11th Baronet]] (born 1940).\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|ref=harv |first=Leonard |last=Naylor |first2=Geoffrey |last2=Jaggar |chapterurl=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/member/wynn-sir-john-1628-1719 |chapter=Wynn, Sir John (1628-1719), of Rhiwgoch, Merion. and Wynnstay, Denb. |title=The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1660-1690 |editor-first=B.D. |editor-last=Henning |year=1983 |accessdate= 14 July 2013}}\n*{{cite DNB|ref=harv |first=Daniel Lleufer |last=Thomas |wstitle=Wynn, John |volume=63 |pages=257\u2013259}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last=Roberts |first=Glyn |year=1959 |chapter=Wynn family, of Gwydir, Caerns. |title=The National Library of Wales :: Dictionary of Welsh Biography | chapter-url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-WYNN-GWY-1300.html?query=robert+roberts&field=content}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|en}}\n{{s-bef\n | before  = [[William Price (Royalist)|William Price]]\n}}\n{{s-title\n | title =  [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Merioneth (UK Parliament constituency)|Merioneth]]\n | years = 1679\u20131681 \n}}\n{{s-aft\n | after  = [[Robert Owen (MP)|Sir Robert Owen]]\n}}\n{{s-bef\n | before  =[[Robert Owen (MP)|Sir Robert Owen]]\n}}\n{{s-title\n | title =  [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Merioneth (UK Parliament constituency)|Merioneth]]\n | years =   1685\u20131695 \n}}\n{{s-aft\n | after  = [[Hugh Nanney]]\n}}\n{{s-bef\n | before  = [[Robert Owen (MP)|Sir Robert Owen]]\n}}\n{{s-title\n | title =  [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Caernarvon Boroughs (UK Parliament constituency)|Caernarvon Boroughs]]\n | years =   1698\u2013[[1705 English general election|1705]]\n}}\n{{s-aft\n | after  = [[Thomas Bulkeley (died 1708)|Thomas Bulkeley]]\n}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Thomas Bulkeley (died 1708)|Thomas Bulkeley]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Member of Parliament]] for [[Caernarvonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Caernarvonshire]]|years=1705\u20131707}}\n{{s-aft|after=''Parliament of Great Britain''}}\n{{s-par|gb}}\n{{s-bef|before=''Parliament of England''}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Member of Parliament]] for [[Caernarvonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Caernarvonshire]]|years=1707\u20131713}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[William Griffith (1686-1715)|William Griffith]]}}\n{{s-hon}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[William Owen (Custos Rotulorum)|William Owen]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Custos Rotulorum of Merionethshire]]|years=1678\u20131688}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis|The Marquess of Powis]]}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Sir William Williams, 1st Baronet, of Gray's Inn|Sir William Williams, Bt]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Custos Rotulorum of Merionethshire]]|years=1690\u20131711}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Edward Vaughan (MP for Merioneth)|Edward Vaughan]]}}\n{{s-reg|en-bt}}\n{{s-bef | before= [[Sir Richard Wynn, 4th Baronet|Richard Wynn]]}}\n{{s-ttl | title=[[Wynn baronets|Baronet]]<br />'''(of Gwydir)''' | years=1674\u20131719}}\n{{s-non | reason=Extinct}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2012}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wynn, John, 5th Baronet}}\n[[Category:1628 births]]\n[[Category:1719 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Merionethshire]]\n[[Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of England]]\n[[Category:British MPs 1707\u20131708]]\n[[Category:British MPs 1708\u20131710]]\n[[Category:British MPs 1710\u20131713]]\n[[Category:House of Cunedda]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of England (pre-1707) for constituencies in Wales]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Welsh constituencies]]\n[[Category:High Sheriffs of Denbighshire]]\n[[Category:High Sheriffs of Caernarvonshire]]\n[[Category:High Sheriffs of Merionethshire]]\n[[Category:17th-century Welsh people]]\n[[Category:People of the Stuart period]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1679]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1680\u20131681]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1685\u20131687]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1689\u20131690]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1690\u20131695]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1698\u20131700]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1701]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1701\u20131702]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1702\u20131705]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1705\u20131707]]\n[[Category:Members of Parliament for Caernarfon]]\n", "name_user": "J947", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCareer:clean up,typo(s) fixed: 1671-3 \u2192 1671\u20133 (4)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_John_Wynn,_5th_Baronet"}
