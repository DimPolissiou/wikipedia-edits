Serbia previously participated as part of {{Esccnty|Yugoslavia}} (both the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] from {{escyr|1961}} to {{escyr|1991}} and the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in {{escyr|1992}}) and as {{Esccnty|Serbia and Montenegro}} ({{escyr|2004}}\u2013{{escyr|2006}}). Serbia won the contest on its debut as an independent country in 2007, with \"[[Molitva]]\" performed by [[Marija \u0160erifovi\u0107]]. The country's only other top five result is their third place in {{escyr|2012}}, with \"[[Nije ljubav stvar]]\". Serbia's other top ten results are sixth place ({{escyr|2008}}) and tenth place ({{escyr|2015}}).\n\n==History==\n\nAs Serbia was at one time part of [[Yugoslavia]], it had the opportunity to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest after Yugoslavia's debut at the contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1961|1961]]. It debuted the same year as Spain and Finland and became the first and, for three decades, only socialist country to participate in the competition. The best result of Yugoslavia occurred in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1989|1989]] when it won with \"[[Rock Me (Riva song)|Rock Me]]\", sung in Serbo-Croatian and English by [[Riva (music group)|Riva]]. Yugoslavia participated regularly until its breakup in 1991/1992.\n\nAfter a period of absence from 1993 until 2003, [[Serbia and Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest|Serbia and Montenegro]] returned to the contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]]. They finished in second place with song \"[[Lane moje]]\" performed by [[\u017deljko Joksimovi\u0107]]. By 2006, Serbia and Montenegro split, and with Serbia making its debut entry as an independent nation with the [[ballad]] \"[[Molitva]]\" by [[Marija \u0160erifovi\u0107]]. \"Molitva\" won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]], receiving 268 points, making Serbia the first country to win with debut entry after Switzerland's win at the first edition. Subsequently, Serbia was host of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008 contest]] in its capital [[Belgrade]].\n\nThe second Serbian entry, performed in Belgrade was written by past entrant for Serbia as part of Serbia and Montenegro and contest host [[\u017deljko Joksimovi\u0107]]. The song \"[[Oro (song)|Oro]]\", an ethnic ballad, performed by [[Jelena Toma\u0161evi\u0107]] came 6th and received 160 points in the overall rankings.\n\nIn 2009, Serbia selected [[Marko Kon]] and [[Milan Nikoli\u0107 (musician)|Milaan]] to represent them in the second semi-final on 14 May. The duo failed to qualify for the final, marking it the first time Serbia failed to qualify for the final since the introduction of semi-finals.\n\nIn 2010, [[Milan Stankovi\u0107]] was selected to represent the country in the contest with [[Ovo je Balkan]], an upbeat song with ethno elements, and is about a love story set in Belgrade. It qualified for the final and in the end achieved 13th place with 72 points.\n\nIn 2011, [[Nina Radoji\u010di\u0107|Nina]] was selected with her 1960s inspired song, [[\u010caroban]]. She was accompanied with three other singers who would be dancing throughout the performance. In the semi-finals She performed 6th and qualified for the final. In the final, she performed 24th and achieved 14th place.\n\nAfter finishing second in 2004 when representing Serbia and Montenegro, [[\u017deljko Joksimovi\u0107]] was back in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012]] in Azerbaijan, Baku with the song [[Nije ljubav stvar]]. On the second semi-finals he took second place, while he finished third in the final, below second-placed Russia and the winner, Sweden.\n\n[[Moje 3]] represented Serbia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malm\u00f6 with the song \"[[Ljubav je svuda]]\". They would finish 11th in the first semi-final, therefore not qualifying for the final (only 10 contestants were to continue to the final). This was the second time that Serbia did not qualify for the final.\n\nOn 22 November 2013, Serbian broadcaster [[Radio Television of Serbia]] (RTS) announced that it would withdraw from the 2014 contest due to financial difficulties and a lack of available sponsorship for a potential Serbian entry.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ervin|last=Juh\u00e1sz|title=Serbia: RTS not going to Copenhagen|url=http://escxtra.com/2013/11/rts-not-going-to-copenhagen/|work=escXtra.com|accessdate=23 November 2013|date=22 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125011758/http://escxtra.com/2013/11/rts-not-going-to-copenhagen/|archivedate=25 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2014, Serbia announced that they will broadcast all three shows. In addition, they said that it is likely to return at 2015 and that they will probably hold a national selection to find their representative. On 26 September 2014, it was reported that Serbia had decided to return to the {{escyr|2015}} contest to be held in [[Austria]]n capital, [[Vienna]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|title=Serbia: RTS confirms participation- opts for a national final|url=http://esctoday.com/87496/serbia-rts-opts-national-final/|website=esctoday.com|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=26 September 2014|date=26 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 February 2015 Serbia chose their own representative in emission \"Odbrojavanje za Be\u010d\". Odbrojavanje za Be\u010d (English: Countdown for Vienna) is the national final organised by RTS in order to select the Serbian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2015. The selection featured three songs composed by Vladimir Grai\u0107, the composer of Serbia's winning entry \"Molitva\" in 2007. Two of the songs were performed by established Serbian artists Bojana Stamenov and Aleksa Jeli\u0107, while one was performed by Danica Krsti\u0107, a new talent chosen by Grai\u0107 through a scouting process.\n\n[[Bojana Stamenov]] was selected as the Serbian representative for Vienna through a 50:50 voting system, where both the audience and the jury voted for her song \"Ceo svet je moj\" (The whole world is mine) to represent Serbia in Austria. It was later announced that she would perform her song in English (a first for a Serbian entry) titled \"[[Beauty Never Lies]]\". Despite being low with the odds and fan votings, Bojana surprised everyone in the first semifinal and became one of the big press and fan favourites. She qualified to the final as the 9th (10 qualified), but managed to achieve another top 10 result for Serbia in the Grand Final, scoring 53 points and the 10th place.\n\nIn 2016 RTS selected [[Sanja Vu\u010di\u0107]]  and her song \"Goodbye (Shelter)\" internally as well. She qualified for the final placing 10th out of 18 and came 18th of 26 in the final receiving. She fared clearly better with the televoters, coming 11th in the final respectively.\n\n[[Tijana Bogi\u0107evi\u0107]] was selected as the Serbian representative for Kiev. with the song \"In Too Deep\". She would finish 11th in the second semi-final, therefore not qualifying for the final (only 10 contestants were to continue to the final). This was the third time that Serbia did not qualify for the final.\n\nIn 2018 RTS went back to an national final, ''Beovizija'' (which had been used to select their first entrants). [[Sanja Ili\u0107]] and [[Balkanika]] won with the song \"[[Nova deca]].\" They qualified for the final for the first time in a year, placing 9th out of 18 in their semi-final; they then came 19th of 26 in the final, receiving 113 points. They fared better with the televoters, finishing 12th. Following their success in making the final, RTS confirmed that ''Beovizija'' would be maintained as their selection method in 2019. In 2019, RTS decided to host the second edition of the national final. [[Nevena Bo\u017eovi\u0107]] won with her song [[Kruna (song)|''Kruna'']]. Placed 7th with 156 points, she qualified for the final, where she then performed 23rd and came 18th out of 26 acts, with 89 points in total.\n\n==Contestants==\n{{for|contestants prior to 2007|Serbia and Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest|Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n|width=15px bgcolor=gold|\n|Winner\n|-\n|bgcolor=silver|\n|Second place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#cc9966|\n|Third place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#FE8080|{{center|\u25c1}}\n|Last place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#87A96B|{{center|{{small|{{Abbr|W.|Withdrew}}}}}}\n|Withdrew/disqualified\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!width=30px|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Title\n!width=50px|Final\n!width=50px|Points\n!width=50px|Semi\n!width=50px|Points\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"gold\"\n!{{Escyr|2007}}\n|[[Marija \u0160erifovi\u0107]]\n|[[Serbian language|Serbian]]\n|\"[[Molitva]]\" {{small|(\u041c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430)}}\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|268\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|298\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2008}}\n|[[Jelena Toma\u0161evi\u0107]] feat.

Serbia previously participated as part of {{Esccnty|Yugoslavia}} (both the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] from {{escyr|1961}} to {{escyr|1991}} and the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in {{escyr|1992}}) and as {{Esccnty|Serbia and Montenegro}} ({{escyr|2004}}\u2013{{escyr|2006}}). Serbia won the contest on its debut as an independent country in 2007, with \"[[Molitva]]\" performed by [[Marija \u0160erifovi\u0107]]. The country's only other top five result is their third place in {{escyr|2012}}, with \"[[Nije ljubav stvar]]\". Serbia's other top ten results are sixth place ({{escyr|2008}}) and tenth place ({{escyr|2015}}).\n\n==History==\n\nAs Serbia was at one time part of [[Yugoslavia]], it had the opportunity to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest after Yugoslavia's debut at the contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1961|1961]]. It debuted the same year as Spain and Finland and became the first and, for three decades, only socialist country to participate in the competition. The best result of Yugoslavia occurred in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1989|1989]] when it won with \"[[Rock Me (Riva song)|Rock Me]]\", sung in Serbo-Croatian and English by [[Riva (music group)|Riva]]. Yugoslavia participated regularly until its breakup in 1991/1992.\n\nAfter a period of absence from 1993 until 2003, [[Serbia and Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest|Serbia and Montenegro]] returned to the contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]]. They finished in second place with song \"[[Lane moje]]\" performed by [[\u017deljko Joksimovi\u0107]]. By 2006, Serbia and Montenegro split, and with Serbia making its debut entry as an independent nation with the [[ballad]] \"[[Molitva]]\" by [[Marija \u0160erifovi\u0107]]. \"Molitva\" won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]], receiving 268 points, making Serbia the first country to win with debut entry after Switzerland's win at the first edition. Subsequently, Serbia was host of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008 contest]] in its capital [[Belgrade]].\n\nThe second Serbian entry, performed in Belgrade was written by past entrant for Serbia as part of Serbia and Montenegro and contest host [[\u017deljko Joksimovi\u0107]]. The song \"[[Oro (song)|Oro]]\", an ethnic ballad, performed by [[Jelena Toma\u0161evi\u0107]] came 6th and received 160 points in the overall rankings.\n\nIn 2009, Serbia selected [[Marko Kon]] and [[Milan Nikoli\u0107 (musician)|Milaan]] to represent them in the second semi-final on 14 May. The duo failed to qualify for the final, marking it the first time Serbia failed to qualify for the final since the introduction of semi-finals.\n\nIn 2010, [[Milan Stankovi\u0107]] was selected to represent the country in the contest with [[Ovo je Balkan]], an upbeat song with ethno elements, and is about a love story set in Belgrade. It qualified for the final and in the end achieved 13th place with 72 points.\n\nIn 2011, [[Nina Radoji\u010di\u0107|Nina]] was selected with her 1960s inspired song, [[\u010caroban]]. She was accompanied with three other singers who would be dancing throughout the performance. In the semi-finals She performed 6th and qualified for the final. In the final, she performed 24th and achieved 14th place.\n\nAfter finishing second in 2004 when representing Serbia and Montenegro, [[\u017deljko Joksimovi\u0107]] was back in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012]] in Azerbaijan, Baku with the song [[Nije ljubav stvar]]. On the second semi-finals he took second place, while he finished third in the final, below second-placed Russia and the winner, Sweden.\n\n[[Moje 3]] represented Serbia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malm\u00f6 with the song \"[[Ljubav je svuda]]\". They would finish 11th in the first semi-final, therefore not qualifying for the final (only 10 contestants were to continue to the final). This was the second time that Serbia did not qualify for the final.\n\nOn 22 November 2013, Serbian broadcaster [[Radio Television of Serbia]] (RTS) announced that it would withdraw from the 2014 contest due to financial difficulties and a lack of available sponsorship for a potential Serbian entry.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ervin|last=Juh\u00e1sz|title=Serbia: RTS not going to Copenhagen|url=http://escxtra.com/2013/11/rts-not-going-to-copenhagen/|work=escXtra.com|accessdate=23 November 2013|date=22 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125011758/http://escxtra.com/2013/11/rts-not-going-to-copenhagen/|archivedate=25 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2014, Serbia announced that they will broadcast all three shows. In addition, they said that it is likely to return at 2015 and that they will probably hold a national selection to find their representative. On 26 September 2014, it was reported that Serbia had decided to return to the {{escyr|2015}} contest to be held in [[Austria]]n capital, [[Vienna]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|title=Serbia: RTS confirms participation- opts for a national final|url=http://esctoday.com/87496/serbia-rts-opts-national-final/|website=esctoday.com|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=26 September 2014|date=26 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 February 2015 Serbia chose their own representative in emission \"Odbrojavanje za Be\u010d\". Odbrojavanje za Be\u010d (English: Countdown for Vienna) is the national final organised by RTS in order to select the Serbian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2015. The selection featured three songs composed by Vladimir Grai\u0107, the composer of Serbia's winning entry \"Molitva\" in 2007. Two of the songs were performed by established Serbian artists Bojana Stamenov and Aleksa Jeli\u0107, while one was performed by Danica Krsti\u0107, a new talent chosen by Grai\u0107 through a scouting process.\n\n[[Bojana Stamenov]] was selected as the Serbian representative for Vienna through a 50:50 voting system, where both the audience and the jury voted for her song \"Ceo svet je moj\" (The whole world is mine) to represent Serbia in Austria. It was later announced that she would perform her song in English (a first for a Serbian entry) titled \"[[Beauty Never Lies]]\". Despite being low with the odds and fan votings, Bojana surprised everyone in the first semifinal and became one of the big press and fan favourites. She qualified to the final as the 9th (10 qualified), but managed to achieve another top 10 result for Serbia in the Grand Final, scoring 53 points and the 10th place.\n\nIn 2016 RTS selected [[Sanja Vu\u010di\u0107]]  and her song \"Goodbye (Shelter)\" internally as well.

She fared clearly better with the televoters, coming 11th in the final respectively.\n\n[[Tijana Bogi\u0107evi\u0107]] was selected as the Serbian representative for Kiev. with the song \"In Too Deep\". She would finish 11th in the second semi-final, therefore not qualifying for the final (only 10 contestants were to continue to the final). This was the third time that Serbia did not qualify for the final.\n\nIn 2018 RTS went back to an national final, ''Beovizija'' (which had been used to select their first entrants). [[Sanja Ili\u0107]] and [[Balkanika]] won with the song \"[[Nova deca]].\" They qualified for the final for the first time in a year, placing 9th out of 18 in their semi-final; they then came 19th of 26 in the final, receiving 113 points. They fared better with the televoters, finishing 12th. Following their success in making the final, RTS confirmed that ''Beovizija'' would be maintained as their selection method in 2019. In 2019, RTS decided to host the second edition of the national final. [[Nevena Bo\u017eovi\u0107]] won with her song [[Kruna (song)|''Kruna'']]. Placed 7th with 156 points, she qualified for the final, where she then performed 23rd and came 18th out of 26 acts, with 89 points in total.\n\n==Contestants==\n{{for|contestants prior to 2007|Serbia and Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest|Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n|width=15px bgcolor=gold|\n|Winner\n|-\n|bgcolor=silver|\n|Second place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#cc9966|\n|Third place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#FE8080|{{center|\u25c1}}\n|Last place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#87A96B|{{small|{{center|{{Abbr|W.|Withdrew}}}}}}\n|Withdrew/disqualified\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!width=30px|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Title\n!width=50px|Final\n!width=50px|Points\n!width=50px|Semi\n!width=50px|Points\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"gold\"\n!{{Escyr|2007}}\n|[[Marija \u0160erifovi\u0107]]\n|[[Serbian language|Serbian]]\n|\"[[Molitva]]\" {{small|(\u041c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430)}}\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|268\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|298\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2008}}\n|[[Jelena Toma\u0161evi\u0107]] feat.

He was the son of [[Ser Petracco]] and his wife Eletta Canigiani. His given name was ''Francesco Petracco,'' which was [[Latinized name|Latinized]] to ''Petrarca.'' Petrarch's younger brother was born in [[Incisa in Val d'Arno]] in 1307. [[Dante]] was a friend of his father.<ref name=\"Bishop\">[[J.H.

He spent much of his early life at [[Avignon]] and nearby [[Carpentras]], where his family moved to follow [[Pope Clement V]] who moved there in 1309 to begin the [[Avignon Papacy]]. He studied law at the [[University of Montpellier]] (1316\u201320) and [[University of Bologna|Bologna]] (1320\u201323) with a lifelong friend and schoolmate called Guido Sette. Because his father was in the legal profession (a [[Civil law notary|notary]]), he insisted that Petrarch and his brother study law also. Petrarch, however, was primarily interested in writing and [[Latin literature]] and considered these seven years wasted. Additionally, he proclaimed that through legal manipulation, his guardians robbed him of his small property inheritance in Florence, which only reinforced his dislike for the legal system. He protested, \"I couldn't face making a merchandise of my mind,\" as he viewed the legal system as the art of selling justice.<ref name=\"Bishop\" />\n\nPetrarch was a prolific letter writer and counted [[Boccaccio]] among his notable friends to whom he wrote often. After the death of their parents, Petrarch and his brother Gherardo went back to [[Avignon]] in 1326, where he worked in numerous clerical offices. This work gave him much time to devote to his writing. With his first large-scale work, ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic]] in [[Latin]] about the great Roman general [[Scipio Africanus]], Petrarch emerged as a European celebrity. On April 8, 1341, he became the second <ref>after \"Albertino Mussato\" who was the first to be so crowned according to Robert Weiss, The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity (Oxford, 1973)</ref> [[poet laureate]] since antiquity and was crowned by Roman ''Senatori'' [[Giordano Orsini (Senatore 1341)|Giordano Orsini]] and Orso dell'Anguillara on the holy grounds of [[Rome's Capitol]].<ref>Plumb, p. 164</ref><ref name=pie32>Pietrangeli (1981), p. 32</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Kirkham|first1=Victoria|title=Petrarch: A Critical Guide to the Complete Works|date=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iGDdF667hosC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=giordano+orsini+1341#v=onepage&q=giordano%20orsini%201341&f=false|isbn=978-0226437439}}</ref>\n\nHe traveled widely in Europe, served as an ambassador, and (because he traveled  for pleasure,<ref>[[Morris Bishop|Bishop, Morris]] ''Petrarch and his World'', p. 92, Indiana University Press 1963, {{ISBN|0-8046-1730-9}}</ref> as with his [[Petrarch#Mont_Ventoux|ascent of Mont Ventoux]]), has been called \"the first [[Tourist#History|tourist]]\".<ref>NSA Family Encyclopedia, ''Petrarch, Francesco'', Vol. 11, p. 240, Standard Education Corp. 1992</ref>\nDuring his travels, he collected crumbling Latin [[manuscripts]] and was a prime mover in the recovery of knowledge from writers of Rome and Greece.

The nineteenth-century Swiss historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] noted that [[Jean Buridan]] had climbed the same mountain a few years before, and ascents accomplished during the [[Middle Ages]] have been recorded, including that of [[Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne]].<ref>Burckhardt, Jacob.

In Petrarch, this attitude is coupled with an aspiration for a virtuous Christian life, and on reaching the summit, he took from his pocket a volume by his beloved mentor, Saint Augustine, that he always carried with him.<ref>McLaughlin, Edward Tompkins; ''Studies in Medieval Life and Literature'', p. 6, New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1894</ref>\n<blockquote>For pleasure alone, he climbed Mont Ventoux, which rises to more than six thousand feet, beyond Vaucluse. It was no great feat, of course, but he was the first recorded [[Mountaineering|Alpinist]] of modern times, the first to climb a mountain merely for the delight of looking from its top. (Or almost the first; for in a high pasture he met an old shepherd, who said that fifty years before he had attained the summit, and had got nothing from it save toil and repentance and torn clothing.) Petrarch was dazed and stirred by the view of the Alps, the mountains around [[Lyon]]s, the [[Rhone]], the Bay of [[Marseilles]]. He took [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s ''[[Confessions of St. Augustine|Confessions]]'' from his pocket and reflected that his climb was merely an [[allegory]] of aspiration toward a better life.<ref>{{cite book |last=Plumb |first=J.H. |date=1961 |title=The Horizon Book of the Renaissance |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7FKVBjaLtJsC&q=%22climb+was+merely+an+allegory%22&dq=%22climb+was+merely+an+allegory%22 |location=New York |publisher=American Heritage |page=26 }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAs [[Bibliomancy|the book fell open]], Petrarch's eyes were immediately drawn to the following words:\n\n{{quote|And men go about to wonder at the heights of the mountains, and the mighty waves of the sea, and the wide sweep of rivers, and the circuit of the ocean, and the revolution of the stars, but themselves they consider not.<ref name=AMV/>}}\nPetrarch's response was to turn from the outer world of nature to the inner world of \"soul\":\n\n{{quote|I closed the book, angry with myself that I should still be admiring earthly things who might long ago have learned from even the pagan philosophers that nothing is wonderful but the soul, which, when great itself, finds nothing great outside itself.

His career in [[Catholicism|the Church]] did not allow him to marry, but he is believed to have fathered two children by a woman or women unknown to posterity. A son, Giovanni, was born in 1337, and a daughter, Francesca, was born in 1343. He later legitimized both.<ref>Plumb, p.  165</ref>\n\n[[File:Arqu\u00e0 Petrarca Punto di vista di un'aquila.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Petrarch's [[Arqu\u00e0 Petrarca|Arqu\u00e0]] house near [[Padua]] where he retired to spend his last years]]\nGiovanni died of the [[bubonic plague|plague]] in 1361. In the same year Petrarch was named [[canon (priest)|canon]] in [[Monselice]] near Padua. Francesca married [[Francescuolo da Brossano]] (who was later named executor of Petrarch's [[Last Will and Testament|will]]) that same year. In 1362, shortly after the birth of a daughter, Eletta (the same name as Petrarch's mother), they joined Petrarch in [[Venice]] to flee the plague then ravaging parts of Europe. A second grandchild, Francesco, was born in 1366 but died before his second birthday. Francesca and her family lived with Petrarch in Venice for five years from 1362 to 1367 at [[Palazzo Molina]], although Petrarch continued to travel in those years. Between 1361 and 1369, the younger Boccaccio paid the older Petrarch two visits. The first was in Venice; the second was in Padua.\n\nAbout 1368 Petrarch and his daughter Francesca (with her family) moved to the small town of [[Arqu\u00e0 Petrarca|Arqu\u00e0]] in the [[Euganean Hills]] near [[Padua]], where he passed his remaining years in religious contemplation. He died in his house in Arqu\u00e0 early on July 20, 1374\u2014his seventieth birthday.

There is little definite information in Petrarch's work concerning Laura, except that she is lovely to look at, fair-haired, with a modest, dignified bearing. Laura and Petrarch had little or no personal contact. According to his \"Secretum,\" she refused him because she was already married. He channeled his feelings into love poems that were exclamatory rather than persuasive and wrote prose that showed his contempt for men who pursue women.  Upon her death in 1348, the poet found that his [[grief]] was as difficult to live with as was his former despair.  Later in his \"Letter to Posterity,\" Petrarch wrote: \"In my younger days I constantly struggled with an overwhelming but pure love affair\u2014my only one, and I would have struggled with it longer had not premature death, bitter but salutary for me, extinguished the cooling flames. I certainly wish I could say that I have always been entirely free from desires of the flesh, but I would be lying if I did\".\n\n[[File:Francesco Petrarca01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Laura de Noves]]]]\nWhile it is possible, she was an idealized or pseudonymous character\u2014particularly since the name \"Laura\" has a [[Linguistics|linguistic]] connection to the poetic \"laurels\" Petrarch coveted\u2014Petrarch himself always denied it. His frequent use of ''l'aura'' is also remarkable: for example, the line \"Erano i capei d'oro a ''l'aura'' sparsi\" may both mean \"her hair was all over Laura's body,\" and \"the wind (\"l'aura\") blew through her hair.\" There is psychological realism in the description of Laura, although Petrarch draws heavily on conventionalized descriptions of love and lovers from [[troubadour]] songs and other literature of [[courtly love]]. Her presence causes him unspeakable joy, but his unrequited love creates unendurable desires, inner conflicts between the ardent lover and the [[Christian mysticism|mystic Christian]], making it impossible to reconcile the two. Petrarch's quest for love leads to hopelessness and irreconcilable anguish, as he expresses in the series of paradoxes in Rima 134 \"Pace non trovo, et non \u00f2 da far guerra;/e temo, et spero; et ardo, et son un ghiaccio\": \"I find no peace, and yet I make no war:/and fear, and hope: and burn, and I am ice.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Italian/PetrarchCanzoniere123-183.htm#_Toc10863123|title=Petrarch (1304\u20131374).

[[Francesco De Sanctis (critic)|Francesco De Sanctis]] remarks much the same thing in his ''Storia della letteratura italiana'', and contemporary critics agree on the powerful music of his verse.

Sensuality and passion are suggested rather by the rhythm and music that shape the vague contours of the lady. Also, some today consider Laura to be a representation of an \"ideal Renaissance woman,\" based on her nature and definitive characteristics.\n\n=== Sonnet 227 ===\n{|\n!

Despite the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] subject, the ''Commedia'' is deeply rooted in the cultural and social milieu of turn-of-the-century [[Florence]]: Dante's rise to power (1300) and exile (1302); his political passions call for a \"violent\" use of language, where he uses all the registers, from low and trivial to sublime and philosophical. Petrarch confessed to Boccaccio that he had never read the ''Commedia'', remarks Contini, wondering whether this was true or Petrarch wanted to distance himself from Dante. Dante's language evolves as he grows old, from the courtly love of his early [[Dolce Stil Novo|stilnovistic]] ''Rime'' and ''Vita nuova'' to the ''Convivio'' and ''Divina Commedia'', where [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] is sanctified as the goddess of philosophy\u2014the philosophy announced by the Donna Gentile at the death of Beatrice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insulaeuropea.eu/pulsoni/il_metodo_di_lavoro.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 28, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112102335/http://www.insulaeuropea.eu/pulsoni/il_metodo_di_lavoro.pdf |archivedate=November 12, 2013  }}</ref>\n\nIn contrast, Petrarch's thought and style are relatively uniform throughout his life\u2014he spent much of it revising the songs and sonnets of the ''[[Il Canzoniere|Canzoniere]]'' rather than moving to new subjects or poetry. Here, poetry alone provides a consolation for personal grief, much less philosophy or politics (as in Dante), for Petrarch fights within himself (sensuality versus [[mysticism]], profane versus [[Christian literature]]), not against anything outside of himself. The strong moral and political convictions which had inspired Dante to belong to the Middle Ages and the libertarian spirit of the [[Medieval commune|commune]]; Petrarch's moral dilemmas, his refusal to take a stand in politics, his reclusive life point to a different direction, or time. The free commune, the place that had made Dante an eminent politician and scholar, was being dismantled: the ''signoria'' was taking its place. Humanism and its spirit of empirical inquiry, however, were making progress\u2014but the papacy (especially after Avignon) and the empire ([[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], the last hope of the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|white Guelphs]], died near Siena in 1313) had lost much of their original prestige.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://petrarch.uoregon.edu/|title=The Oregon Petrarch Open Book \u2013 \"Petrarch is again in sight\"|website=petrarch.uoregon.edu}}</ref>\n\nPetrarch polished and perfected the sonnet form inherited from [[Giacomo da Lentini]] and which Dante widely used in his ''[[Vita nuova]]'' to popularise the new courtly love of the ''[[Dolce Stil Novo]]''. The tercet benefits from Dante's [[terza rima]] (compare the ''Divina Commedia''), the [[quatrain]]s prefer the ABBA\u2013ABBA to the ABAB\u2013ABAB scheme of the [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilians]]. The imperfect rhymes of ''u'' with closed ''o'' and ''i'' with closed ''e'' (inherited from Guittone's mistaken rendering of [[Sicilian School|Sicilian verse]]) are excluded, but the rhyme of open and closed ''o'' is kept. Finally, Petrarch's [[enjambment]] creates longer semantic units by connecting one line to the following. The vast majority (317) of Petrarch's 366 poems collected in the ''[[Canzoniere]]'' (dedicated to Laura) were ''sonnets'', and the [[Petrarchan sonnet]] still bears his name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/poetry/home_movements.html|title=Movements : Poetry through the Ages|website=www.webexhibits.org}}</ref>\n\n==Philosophy==\n[[File:Francesco Petrarca00.jpg|thumb|right|Petrarch]]\n[[File:Francesco Petrarca2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of Petrarch on the Uffizi Palace, in Florence]]Petrarch is traditionally called the father of Humanism and considered by many to be the \"father of the [[Renaissance]].\"<ref>See for example [[Rudolf Pfeiffer]], ''History of Classical Scholarship 1300\u20131850'', Oxford University Press, 1976, p. 1;  Gilbert Highet, ''The Classical Tradition,'' Oxford University Press, 1949, p. 81\u201388.</ref> In his work ''[[Secretum (book)|Secretum meum]]'' he points out that [[secular]] achievements did not necessarily preclude an authentic relationship with God. Petrarch argued instead that God had given humans their vast intellectual and creative potential to be used to their fullest.<ref>[[Famous First Facts]] International, H.W. Wilson Company, New York 2000, {{ISBN|0-8242-0958-3}}, p. 303, item 4567.</ref> He inspired humanist philosophy, which led to the intellectual flowering of the Renaissance. He believed in the immense moral and practical value of the study of ancient history and literature\u2014that is, the study of human thought and action. Petrarch was a devout Catholic and did not see a conflict between realizing humanity's potential and having [[religious faith]].\n\nA highly reflective man, he shaped the nascent humanist movement a great deal because many of the internal conflicts and musings expressed in his writings were seized upon by Renaissance humanist philosophers and argued continually for the next 200 years. For example, Petrarch struggled with the proper relation between the active and contemplative life and tended to emphasize the importance of solitude and study. In a clear disagreement with Dante, in 1346 Petrarch argued in his ''[[De vita solitaria]]'' that [[Pope Celestine V]]'s refusal of the papacy in 1294 was as a virtuous example of solitary life.<ref>{{Cite book | last= Petrarca | first = Francesco | title = De vita Solitaria | location = Bologna | publisher = Gaetano Romagnoli | year = 1879 | url = https://archive.org/details/lavitasolitaria01petr | language = Italian}}</ref> Later the politician and thinker [[Leonardo Bruni]] (1370\u20131444) argued for the active life, or \"[[civic humanism]]\".

He spent much of his early life at [[Avignon]] and nearby [[Carpentras]], where his family moved to follow [[Pope Clement V]] who moved there in 1309 to begin the [[Avignon Papacy]]. He studied law at the [[University of Montpellier]] (1316\u201320) and [[University of Bologna|Bologna]] (1320\u201323) with a lifelong friend and schoolmate called Guido Sette. Because his father was in the legal profession (a [[Civil law notary|notary]]), he insisted that Petrarch and his brother study law also. Petrarch, however, was primarily interested in writing and [[Latin literature]] and considered these seven years wasted. Additionally, he proclaimed that through legal manipulation, his guardians robbed him of his small property inheritance in Florence, which only reinforced his dislike for the legal system. He protested, \"I couldn't face making a merchandise of my mind,\" as he viewed the legal system as the art of selling justice.<ref name=\"Bishop\" />\n\nPetrarch was a prolific letter writer and counted [[Boccaccio]] among his notable friends to whom he wrote often. After the death of their parents, Petrarch and his brother Gherardo went back to [[Avignon]] in 1326, where he worked in numerous clerical offices. This work gave him much time to devote to his writing. With his first large-scale work, ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic]] in [[Latin]] about the great Roman general [[Scipio Africanus]], Petrarch emerged as a European celebrity.

Putnam's Sons, 1894</ref>\n<blockquote>For pleasure alone, he climbed Mont Ventoux, which rises to more than six thousand feet, beyond Vaucluse. It was no great feat, of course, but he was the first recorded [[Mountaineering|Alpinist]] of modern times, the first to climb a mountain merely for the delight of looking from its top. (Or almost the first; for in a high pasture he met an old shepherd, who said that fifty years before he had attained the summit, and had got nothing from it save toil and repentance and torn clothing.) Petrarch was dazed and stirred by the view of the Alps, the mountains around [[Lyon]]s, the [[Rhone]], the Bay of [[Marseilles]]. He took [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s ''[[Confessions of St. Augustine|Confessions]]'' from his pocket and reflected that his climb was merely an [[allegory]] of aspiration toward a better life.<ref>{{cite book |last=Plumb |first=J.H. |date=1961 |title=The Horizon Book of the Renaissance |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7FKVBjaLtJsC&q=%22climb+was+merely+an+allegory%22&dq=%22climb+was+merely+an+allegory%22 |location=New York |publisher=American Heritage |page=26 }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAs [[Bibliomancy|the book fell open]], Petrarch's eyes were immediately drawn to the following words:\n\n{{quote|And men go about to wonder at the heights of the mountains, and the mighty waves of the sea, and the wide sweep of rivers, and the circuit of the ocean, and the revolution of the stars, but themselves they consider not.<ref name=AMV/>}}\nPetrarch's response was to turn from the outer world of nature to the inner world of \"soul\":\n\n{{quote|I closed the book, angry with myself that I should still be admiring earthly things who might long ago have learned from even the pagan philosophers that nothing is wonderful but the soul, which, when great itself, finds nothing great outside itself.

Arguing against such a singular and hyperbolic periodization, Paul James suggests a different reading:\n\n{{quote| In the alternative argument that I want to make, these emotional responses, marked by the changing senses of space and time in Petrarch\u2019s writing, suggest a person caught in unsettled tension between two different but contemporaneous ontological formations: the traditional and the modern.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=Spring 2014 |last=James |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul James (academic) |title=Emotional Ambivalence across Times and Spaces: Mapping Petrarch's Intersecting Worlds |journal=Exemplaria |volume=26 |issue=1 |page=82 |url= https://www.academia.edu/9017816 |accessdate=4 August 2015}}</ref>}}\n\n===Later years===\nPetrarch spent the latter part of his life journeying through northern Italy as an international scholar and poet-[[diplomacy|diplomat]]. His career in [[Catholicism|the Church]] did not allow him to marry, but he is believed to have fathered two children by a woman or women unknown to posterity. A son, Giovanni, was born in 1337, and a daughter, Francesca, was born in 1343. He later legitimized both.<ref>Plumb, p.  165</ref>\n\n[[File:Arqu\u00e0 Petrarca Punto di vista di un'aquila.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Petrarch's [[Arqu\u00e0 Petrarca|Arqu\u00e0]] house near [[Padua]] where he retired to spend his last years]]\nGiovanni died of the [[bubonic plague|plague]] in 1361. In the same year Petrarch was named [[canon (priest)|canon]] in [[Monselice]] near Padua. Francesca married [[Francescuolo da Brossano]] (who was later named executor of Petrarch's [[Last Will and Testament|will]]) that same year. In 1362, shortly after the birth of a daughter, Eletta (the same name as Petrarch's mother), they joined Petrarch in [[Venice]] to flee the plague then ravaging parts of Europe. A second grandchild, Francesco, was born in 1366 but died before his second birthday. Francesca and her family lived with Petrarch in Venice for five years from 1362 to 1367 at [[Palazzo Molina]], although Petrarch continued to travel in those years. Between 1361 and 1369, the younger Boccaccio paid the older Petrarch two visits. The first was in Venice; the second was in Padua.\n\nAbout 1368 Petrarch and his daughter Francesca (with her family) moved to the small town of [[Arqu\u00e0 Petrarca|Arqu\u00e0]] in the [[Euganean Hills]] near [[Padua]], where he passed his remaining years in religious contemplation. He died in his house in Arqu\u00e0 early on July 20, 1374\u2014his seventieth birthday. The house hosts now a permanent exhibition of Petrarchian works and curiosities; among others, you find the famous tomb of Petrarch's beloved cat who was embalmed.

The will mention neither the property in Arqu\u00e0 nor his library; [[Petrarch's library]] of notable manuscripts was already promised to Venice, in exchange for the Palazzo Molina.

Later, Renaissance poets who copied Petrarch's style named this collection of 366 poems ''[[Il Canzoniere]]'' (\"Song Book\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/petrarch|title=Petrarch|last=Petrarch|date=2004-03-04|website=Petrarch|language=en|access-date=2017-08-23}}</ref> Laura may have been [[Laura de Noves]], the wife of Count [[Hugues de Sade]] (an ancestor of the [[Marquis de Sade]]). There is little definite information in Petrarch's work concerning Laura, except that she is lovely to look at, fair-haired, with a modest, dignified bearing. Laura and Petrarch had little or no personal contact. According to his \"Secretum,\" she refused him because she was already married. He channeled his feelings into love poems that were exclamatory rather than persuasive and wrote prose that showed his contempt for men who pursue women.  Upon her death in 1348, the poet found that his [[grief]] was as difficult to live with as was his former despair.  Later in his \"Letter to Posterity,\" Petrarch wrote: \"In my younger days I constantly struggled with an overwhelming but pure love affair\u2014my only one, and I would have struggled with it longer had not premature death, bitter but salutary for me, extinguished the cooling flames. I certainly wish I could say that I have always been entirely free from desires of the flesh, but I would be lying if I did\".\n\n[[File:Francesco Petrarca01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Laura de Noves]]]]\nWhile it is possible, she was an idealized or pseudonymous character\u2014particularly since the name \"Laura\" has a [[Linguistics|linguistic]] connection to the poetic \"laurels\" Petrarch coveted\u2014Petrarch himself always denied it. His frequent use of ''l'aura'' is also remarkable: for example, the line \"Erano i capei d'oro a ''l'aura'' sparsi\" may both mean \"her hair was all over Laura's body,\" and \"the wind (\"l'aura\") blew through her hair.\" There is psychological realism in the description of Laura, although Petrarch draws heavily on conventionalized descriptions of love and lovers from [[troubadour]] songs and other literature of [[courtly love]]. Her presence causes him unspeakable joy, but his unrequited love creates unendurable desires, inner conflicts between the ardent lover and the [[Christian mysticism|mystic Christian]], making it impossible to reconcile the two. Petrarch's quest for love leads to hopelessness and irreconcilable anguish, as he expresses in the series of paradoxes in Rima 134 \"Pace non trovo, et non \u00f2 da far guerra;/e temo, et spero; et ardo, et son un ghiaccio\": \"I find no peace, and yet I make no war:/and fear, and hope: and burn, and I am ice.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Italian/PetrarchCanzoniere123-183.htm#_Toc10863123|title=Petrarch (1304\u20131374).

[[Francesco De Sanctis (critic)|Francesco De Sanctis]] remarks much the same thing in his ''Storia della letteratura italiana'', and contemporary critics agree on the powerful music of his verse. Perhaps the poet was inspired by a famous singer he met in [[Veneto]] around the 1350s.<ref>Anna Chiappinelli, \"La Dolce Musica Nova di Francesco Landini\" Sidereus Nuncius, 2007, pp. 55\u201391 [http://www.sidereus-nuncius.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202091815/http://sidereus-nuncius.com/ |date=February 2, 2011 }}</ref> Gianfranco Contini, in a famous essay on Petrarch's language (\"Preliminari sulla lingua del Petrarca.\" Petrarca, Canzoniere.

Sensuality and passion are suggested rather by the rhythm and music that shape the vague contours of the lady. Also, some today consider Laura to be a representation of an \"ideal Renaissance woman,\" based on her nature and definitive characteristics.\n\n=== Sonnet 227 ===\n{|\n!

Despite the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] subject, the ''Commedia'' is deeply rooted in the cultural and social milieu of turn-of-the-century [[Florence]]: Dante's rise to power (1300) and exile (1302); his political passions call for a \"violent\" use of language, where he uses all the registers, from low and trivial to sublime and philosophical. Petrarch confessed to Boccaccio that he had never read the ''Commedia'', remarks Contini, wondering whether this was true or Petrarch wanted to distance himself from Dante. Dante's language evolves as he grows old, from the courtly love of his early [[Dolce Stil Novo|stilnovistic]] ''Rime'' and ''Vita nuova'' to the ''Convivio'' and ''Divina Commedia'', where [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] is sanctified as the goddess of philosophy\u2014the philosophy announced by the Donna Gentile at the death of Beatrice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insulaeuropea.eu/pulsoni/il_metodo_di_lavoro.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112102335/http://www.insulaeuropea.eu/pulsoni/il_metodo_di_lavoro.pdf |archivedate=November 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn contrast, Petrarch's thought and style are relatively uniform throughout his life\u2014he spent much of it revising the songs and sonnets of the ''[[Il Canzoniere|Canzoniere]]'' rather than moving to new subjects or poetry. Here, poetry alone provides a consolation for personal grief, much less philosophy or politics (as in Dante), for Petrarch fights within himself (sensuality versus [[mysticism]], profane versus [[Christian literature]]), not against anything outside of himself. The strong moral and political convictions which had inspired Dante to belong to the Middle Ages and the libertarian spirit of the [[Medieval commune|commune]]; Petrarch's moral dilemmas, his refusal to take a stand in politics, his reclusive life point to a different direction, or time. The free commune, the place that had made Dante an eminent politician and scholar, was being dismantled: the ''signoria'' was taking its place. Humanism and its spirit of empirical inquiry, however, were making progress\u2014but the papacy (especially after Avignon) and the empire ([[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], the last hope of the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|white Guelphs]], died near Siena in 1313) had lost much of their original prestige.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://petrarch.uoregon.edu/|title=The Oregon Petrarch Open Book \u2013 \"Petrarch is again in sight\"|website=petrarch.uoregon.edu}}</ref>\n\nPetrarch polished and perfected the sonnet form inherited from [[Giacomo da Lentini]] and which Dante widely used in his ''[[Vita nuova]]'' to popularise the new courtly love of the ''[[Dolce Stil Novo]]''. The tercet benefits from Dante's [[terza rima]] (compare the ''Divina Commedia''), the [[quatrain]]s prefer the ABBA\u2013ABBA to the ABAB\u2013ABAB scheme of the [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilians]]. The imperfect rhymes of ''u'' with closed ''o'' and ''i'' with closed ''e'' (inherited from Guittone's mistaken rendering of [[Sicilian School|Sicilian verse]]) are excluded, but the rhyme of open and closed ''o'' is kept. Finally, Petrarch's [[enjambment]] creates longer semantic units by connecting one line to the following. The vast majority (317) of Petrarch's 366 poems collected in the ''[[Canzoniere]]'' (dedicated to Laura) were ''sonnets'', and the [[Petrarchan sonnet]] still bears his name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/poetry/home_movements.html|title=Movements : Poetry through the Ages|website=www.webexhibits.org}}</ref>\n\n==Philosophy==\n[[File:Francesco Petrarca00.jpg|thumb|right|Petrarch]]\n[[File:Francesco Petrarca2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of Petrarch on the Uffizi Palace, in Florence]]Petrarch is traditionally called the father of Humanism and considered by many to be the \"father of the [[Renaissance]].\"<ref>See for example [[Rudolf Pfeiffer]], ''History of Classical Scholarship 1300\u20131850'', Oxford University Press, 1976, p. 1;  Gilbert Highet, ''The Classical Tradition,'' Oxford University Press, 1949, p. 81\u201388.</ref> In his work ''[[Secretum (book)|Secretum meum]]'' he points out that [[secular]] achievements did not necessarily preclude an authentic relationship with God. Petrarch argued instead that God had given humans their vast intellectual and creative potential to be used to their fullest.<ref>[[Famous First Facts]] International, H.W. Wilson Company, New York 2000, {{ISBN|0-8242-0958-3}}, p. 303, item 4567.</ref> He inspired humanist philosophy, which led to the intellectual flowering of the Renaissance. He believed in the immense moral and practical value of the study of ancient history and literature\u2014that is, the study of human thought and action. Petrarch was a devout Catholic and did not see a conflict between realizing humanity's potential and having [[religious faith]].\n\nA highly reflective man, he shaped the nascent humanist movement a great deal because many of the internal conflicts and musings expressed in his writings were seized upon by Renaissance humanist philosophers and argued continually for the next 200 years. For example, Petrarch struggled with the proper relation between the active and contemplative life and tended to emphasize the importance of solitude and study. In a clear disagreement with Dante, in 1346 Petrarch argued in his ''[[De vita solitaria]]'' that [[Pope Celestine V]]'s refusal of the papacy in 1294 was as a virtuous example of solitary life.<ref>{{Cite book | last= Petrarca | first = Francesco | title = De vita Solitaria | location = Bologna | publisher = Gaetano Romagnoli | year = 1879 | url = https://archive.org/details/lavitasolitaria01petr | language = Italian}}</ref> Later the politician and thinker [[Leonardo Bruni]] (1370\u20131444) argued for the active life, or \"[[civic humanism]]\". As a result, many political, military, and religious leaders during the Renaissance were inculcated with the notion that their pursuit of personal fulfillment should be grounded in [[Classical era|classical]] example and philosophical contemplation.<ref>{{Cite web| url = https://edizionighibli.com/francesco-petrarca/ | language = Italian | title=Edizioni Ghibli, Il Rinascimento e Petrarca|publisher=edizionighibli.com| accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Petrarca Tomb (Arqua).JPG|thumb|right|Petrarch's tomb at [[Arqu\u00e0 Petrarca]]]]\nPetrarch's influence is evident in the works of [[Serafino dell' Aquila|Serafino Ciminelli]] from [[L'Aquila|Aquila]] (1466\u20131500) and in the works of [[Marin Dr\u017ei\u0107]] (1508\u20131567) from [[Dubrovnik]].<ref>Encyclopedia of the Renaissance: Class-Furi\u00f3 Ceriol, Vol. 2, p. 106, Paul F.

The president leads the [[executive branch]] of the [[Federal government of Brazil|federal government]] and is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Brazilian Armed Forces]]. The [[presidential system]] was established in 1889, upon the proclamation of the republic in a military coup d'\u00e9tat against [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]]. Since then, Brazil has had six [[Constitution of Brazil|constitutions]], three dictatorships, and three democratic periods. During the democratic periods, voting has always been [[compulsory voting|compulsory]].

The president is also the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Military of Brazil|armed forces]].\n\nPresidents in Brazil have significant lawmaking powers, exercised either by proposing laws to the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] or by using {{lang|pt|Medidas Provis\u00f3rias}} ([[provisional measure]]s), an instrument with the force of law that the president can enact in cases of urgency and necessity except to make changes to some areas of law (provisional measures cannot be used to change criminal law or electoral law). A provisional measure comes into effect immediately, before Congress votes on it, and remains in force for up to 60 days unless Congress votes to rescind it. The 60-day period can be extended once, up to 120 days. If Congress, on the other hand, votes to approve the provisional measure, it becomes an actual law, with changes decided by the legislative branch. The provisional measure expires at the end of the 60-day period (or the 120-day, in the case of extension), or sooner, if rejected by one of the Houses of Congress.<ref>Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, art. 62 as amended by constitutional amendment n. 32</ref>\n\nArticle 84 of the current Federal Constitution, determines that the president has the power to\n# appoint and dismiss the ministers of state;\n# exercise, with the assistance of the ministers of state, the higher management of the federal administration;\n# initiate the legislative procedure, in the manner and in the cases set forth in the Constitution;\n# sanction, promulgate, and order the publication of laws, as well as issue decrees and regulations for the true enforcement thereof;\n# veto bills, wholly or in part;\n# provide, by means of decree, on organization and structure of federal administration if there is neither increase of expenses nor creation or extinction of public agencies; and extinction of offices or positions, when vacant;\n# maintain relations with foreign States and to accredit their diplomatic representatives;\n# conclude international treaties, conventions and acts, subject to the ratification of the [[National Congress of Brazil]];\n# decree the state of defense and the state of siege, in accordance with the constitutional procedures that precede and authorize those emergency decrees;\n# decree and enforce federal intervention, in accordance with the constitutional procedures that precede and authorize such exceptional action;\n# upon the opening of the legislative session, send a government message and plan to the National Congress, describing the state of the nation and requesting the actions he deems necessary;\n# grant pardons and reduce sentences, after hearing the entities instituted by law, if necessary;\n# exercise the supreme command of the armed forces, appoint the commanders of navy, army and air force, promote general officers and to appoint them to the offices held exclusively by them;\n# appoint, after approval by the Federal Senate, the Justices of the Supreme Federal Court and those of the superior courts, the Governors of the territories, the Prosecutor General of the Republic, the president and the directors of the Central Bank and other civil servants, when established by law;\n# appoint, with due regard for the provisions of Article 73, the Justices of the Court of Accounts of the Union;\n# appoint judges in the events established by this constitution and the Attorney General of the Union;\n# appoint members of the Council of the Republic, in accordance with article 89, VII;\n# summon and preside over the Council of the Republic and the National Defense Council;\n# declare war, in the event of foreign aggression, authorized by the National Congress or confirmed by it, whenever it occurs between legislative sessions and, under the same conditions, to decree full or partial national mobilization;\n# make peace, authorized or confirmed by the National Congress;\n# award decorations and honorary distinctions;\n# permit, in the cases set forth by supplementary law, foreign forces to pass through the national territory, or to remain temporarily therein;\n# submit to the National Congress the pluriannual plan, the bill of budgetary directives and the budget proposals set forth in this constitution;\n# render, each year, accounts to the National Congress concerning the previous fiscal year, within sixty days of the opening of the legislative session;\n# fill and abolish federal government positions, as set forth by law;\n# issue provisional measures, with force of law, according to Article 62;\n# perform other duties set forth in the constitution.\n\n==Election==\n\n=== Requirements ===\nThe [[Constitution of Brazil]] requires that a president be a [[native-born citizen]] of Brazil, at least 35 years of age, a resident of Brazil, in full exercise of their electoral rights, a registered voter, and a member of a [[List of political parties in Brazil|political party]] ([[write-in]] or independent candidates are prohibited).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, article 14, paragraph 3|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Term limits ===\nThe president of Brazil serves for a term of four years,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, article 82|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref> and may be re-elected for a single consecutive term.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, article 14, paragraph 5|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref> This two-term limit, however, is not for life\u2014a former president who has served for two consecutive terms may, at a later time, run again for office, as long as at least one term has elapsed.<ref>{{cite news |title=G1 > Pol\u00edtica -

In either case, two-thirds of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]] must accept charges against the officeholder ([[impeachment]]); and if the Senate accepts the investigation, the president is suspended from exercising the functions of office for up to 180 days.

In the case of \"crimes of malversation\", which must fall into one of seven broad areas and which is defined in more detail in law, a trial takes place at the [[Brazilian Senate|Federal Senate]].

That title has been used by all the constitutions of Brazil since the proclamation of the Republic to refer to the head of the Executive Branch.\n\nHowever, from the proclamation of the Republic in 1889 until 1937 the country was officially styled ''Republic of the United States of Brazil'', and from 1937 to 1967 the country was styled simply ''The United States of Brazil'', and thus the full title of the presidents of the Republic from 1891 until 1967\u2014that is, from [[Deodoro da Fonseca]]'s inauguration as President (between 1889 and 1891 he served as Head of the Provisional Government) until the end of [[Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco|Humberto Castello Branco]]'s term in 1967\u2014was ''President of the Republic of the United States of Brazil''. On 15 March 1967, the country's official name was changed to ''Federative Republic of Brazil''. On that same date, [[Artur da Costa e Silva|Arthur da Costa e Silva]] was sworn in as President succeeding Castello Branco. Since Costa e Silva, therefore, all presidents of Brazil have borne the full title of ''President of the Federative Republic of Brazil''.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Deodoro da Fonseca (1889).jpg\nFile:Floriano Peixoto (1891).jpg\nFile:Prudentedemorais.jpg\nFile:Campos Sales.jpg\nFile:Rodrigues Alves 3.jpg\nFile:Afonso Pena.jpg\nFile:Nilo Pe\u00e7anha 02.jpg\nFile:Hermes da Fonseca (1910).jpg\nFile:Venceslau Br\u00e1s.jpg\nFile:Delfim Moreira (1918).jpg\nFile:Epitacio Pessoa (1919).jpg\nFile:Artur Bernardes (1922).jpg\nFile:Washington Lu\u00eds (foto).jpg\nFile:Cart\u00e3o-postal de Campanha de J\u00falio Prestes - 1930 (cropped).jpg\nFile:Isa\u00edas de Noronha 2, sem data.tif\nFile:Augusto Tasso Fragoso.jpg\nFile:Jo\u00e3o de Deus Menna Barreto, General, 1931.tif\nFile:Getulio Vargas (1930).jpg\nFile:Jos\u00e9 Linhares, presidente dos Estados Unidos do Brasil.tif|<center><small>15th</small></center><center><small>[[Jos\u00e9 Linhares]]</small></center><center><small>1945\u20131946</small></center>\nFile:GASPARDUTRA.jpg|<center><small>16th</small></center><center><small>[[Eurico Gaspar Dutra]]</small></center><center><small>1946\u20131951</small></center>\nFile:17 - Get\u00falio Dorneles Vargas 1951 derivative.jpg|<center><small>17th</small></center><center><small>[[Get\u00falio Vargas]]</small></center><center><small>1951\u20131954</small></center>\nFile:Caf\u00e9 Filho.jpg|<center><small>18th</small></center><center><small>[[Caf\u00e9 Filho]]</small></center><center><small>1954\u20131955</small></center>\nFile:CarlosLuz.jpg|<center><small>19th</small></center><center><small>[[Carlos Luz]]</small></center><center><small>1955</small></center>\nFile:Nereu.gif|<center><small>20th</small></center><center><small>[[Nereu Ramos]]</small></center><center><small>1955\u20131956</small></center>\nFile:Juscelino.jpg|<center><small>21st</small></center><center><small>[[Juscelino Kubitschek]]</small></center><center><small>1956\u20131961</small></center>\nFile:Janio Quadros.png|<center><small>22nd</small></center><center><small>[[J\u00e2nio Quadros]]</small></center><center><small>1961</small></center>\nFile:Ranieri Mazzilli (1961).jpg|<center><small>23rd</small></center><center><small>[[Ranieri Mazzilli]]</small></center><center><small>1961</small></center>\nFile:Jango.jpg|<center><small>24th</small></center><center><small>[[Jo\u00e3o Goulart]]</small></center><center><small>1961\u20131964</small></center>\nFile:Ranieri Mazzilli (1961).jpg|<center><small>25th</small></center><center><small>[[Ranieri Mazzilli]]</small></center><center><small>1964</small></center>\nFile:Castelobranco.jpg|<center><small>26th</small></center><center><small>[[Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco|Castelo Branco]]</small></center><center><small>1964\u20131967</small></center>\nFile:Costa e Silva.jpg|<center><small>27th</small></center><center><small>[[Artur da Costa e Silva]]</small></center><center><small>1967\u20131969</small></center>\nFile:Pedro Aleixo.jpg|<center><small>-</small></center><center><small>[[Pedro Aleixo]]</small></center><center><small>Never took office</small></center>\nFile:Brigadeiro M\u00e1rcio de Souza Mello, Ministro da Aeron\u00e1utica.tif|<center><small>-</small></center><center><small>[[M\u00e1rcio Melo]]</small></center><center><small>1969 (August 31-October 30)</small></center>\nFile:Aur\u00e9lio de Lira Tavares, General, Ministro do Ex\u00e9rcito..tif|<center><small>-</small></center><center><small>[[Aur\u00e9lio de Lira Tavares]]</small></center><center><small>1969 (August 31-October 30)</small></center>\nFile:Augusto Hamann Rademaker Gr\u00fcnewald, Vice-presidente da Rep\u00fablica..tif|<center><small>-</small></center><center><small>[[Augusto Rademaker]]</small></center><center><small>1969 (August 31-October 30)</small></center>\nFile:Em\u00edlio Garrastazu M\u00e9dici, presidente da Rep\u00fablica.

The president leads the [[executive branch]] of the [[Federal government of Brazil|federal government]] and is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Brazilian Armed Forces]]. The [[presidential system]] was established in 1889, upon the proclamation of the republic in a military coup d'\u00e9tat against [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]]. Since then, Brazil has had six [[Constitution of Brazil|constitutions]], three dictatorships, and three democratic periods. During the democratic periods, voting has always been [[compulsory voting|compulsory]].

The president is also the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Military of Brazil|armed forces]].\n\nPresidents in Brazil have significant lawmaking powers, exercised either by proposing laws to the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] or by using {{lang|pt|Medidas Provis\u00f3rias}} ([[provisional measure]]s), an instrument with the force of law that the president can enact in cases of urgency and necessity except to make changes to some areas of law (provisional measures cannot be used to change criminal law or electoral law). A provisional measure comes into effect immediately, before Congress votes on it, and remains in force for up to 60 days unless Congress votes to rescind it. The 60-day period can be extended once, up to 120 days. If Congress, on the other hand, votes to approve the provisional measure, it becomes an actual law, with changes decided by the legislative branch. The provisional measure expires at the end of the 60-day period (or the 120-day, in the case of extension), or sooner, if rejected by one of the Houses of Congress.<ref>Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, art. 62 as amended by constitutional amendment n. 32</ref>\n\nArticle 84 of the current Federal Constitution, determines that the president has the power to\n# appoint and dismiss the ministers of state;\n# exercise, with the assistance of the ministers of state, the higher management of the federal administration;\n# initiate the legislative procedure, in the manner and in the cases set forth in the Constitution;\n# sanction, promulgate, and order the publication of laws, as well as issue decrees and regulations for the true enforcement thereof;\n# veto bills, wholly or in part;\n# provide, by means of decree, on organization and structure of federal administration if there is neither increase of expenses nor creation or extinction of public agencies; and extinction of offices or positions, when vacant;\n# maintain relations with foreign States and to accredit their diplomatic representatives;\n# conclude international treaties, conventions and acts, subject to the ratification of the [[National Congress of Brazil]];\n# decree the state of defense and the state of siege, in accordance with the constitutional procedures that precede and authorize those emergency decrees;\n# decree and enforce federal intervention, in accordance with the constitutional procedures that precede and authorize such exceptional action;\n# upon the opening of the legislative session, send a government message and plan to the National Congress, describing the state of the nation and requesting the actions he deems necessary;\n# grant pardons and reduce sentences, after hearing the entities instituted by law, if necessary;\n# exercise the supreme command of the armed forces, appoint the commanders of navy, army and air force, promote general officers and to appoint them to the offices held exclusively by them;\n# appoint, after approval by the Federal Senate, the Justices of the Supreme Federal Court and those of the superior courts, the Governors of the territories, the Prosecutor General of the Republic, the president and the directors of the Central Bank and other civil servants, when established by law;\n# appoint, with due regard for the provisions of Article 73, the Justices of the Court of Accounts of the Union;\n# appoint judges in the events established by this constitution and the Attorney General of the Union;\n# appoint members of the Council of the Republic, in accordance with article 89, VII;\n# summon and preside over the Council of the Republic and the National Defense Council;\n# declare war, in the event of foreign aggression, authorized by the National Congress or confirmed by it, whenever it occurs between legislative sessions and, under the same conditions, to decree full or partial national mobilization;\n# make peace, authorized or confirmed by the National Congress;\n# award decorations and honorary distinctions;\n# permit, in the cases set forth by supplementary law, foreign forces to pass through the national territory, or to remain temporarily therein;\n# submit to the National Congress the pluriannual plan, the bill of budgetary directives and the budget proposals set forth in this constitution;\n# render, each year, accounts to the National Congress concerning the previous fiscal year, within sixty days of the opening of the legislative session;\n# fill and abolish federal government positions, as set forth by law;\n# issue provisional measures, with force of law, according to Article 62;\n# perform other duties set forth in the constitution.\n\n==Election==\n\n=== Requirements ===\nThe [[Constitution of Brazil]] requires that a president be a [[native-born citizen]] of Brazil, at least 35 years of age, a resident of Brazil, in full exercise of their electoral rights, a registered voter, and a member of a [[List of political parties in Brazil|political party]] ([[write-in]] or independent candidates are prohibited).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, article 14, paragraph 3|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Term limits ===\nThe president of Brazil serves for a term of four years,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, article 82|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref> and may be re-elected for a single consecutive term.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, article 14, paragraph 5|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref> This two-term limit, however, is not for life\u2014a former president who has served for two consecutive terms may, at a later time, run again for office, as long as at least one term has elapsed.<ref>{{cite news |title=G1 > Pol\u00edtica -

When Armstrong confessed in January 2013 after many years of denials, Reilly wrote a strongly critical piece about Armstrong, saying that he had spent 14 years \"polishing a legend that turned out to be plated in fool's gold.\"<ref>Reilly, Rick.

When Armstrong confessed in January 2013 after many years of denials, Reilly wrote a strongly critical piece about Armstrong, saying that he had spent 14 years \"polishing a legend that turned out to be plated in fool's gold.\"<ref>Reilly, Rick.

They first participated in the second contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1957|1957]]. The UK has entered every year since [[Eurovision Song Contest 1959|1959]], and along with [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Sweden]] and the [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest|Netherlands]], is one of only three countries with Eurovision victories in four different decades. The United Kingdom is one of the \"[[Eurovision Song Contest#Big Four and Big Five|Big 5]]\", along with [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|France]], [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest|Germany]], [[Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest|Italy]] and [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spain]] who are automatically allowed to participate in the final as they are the five biggest financial contributors to the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU). The British public broadcaster, the BBC, broadcasts the event each year and organises the [[UK national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest|national selection]] for the entry. The UK has won the contest five times, and has finished second on a record fifteen times.\n\nThe United Kingdom's five winners are [[Sandie Shaw]] with the song \"[[Puppet on a String]]\" ({{escyr|1967}}), [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] with \"[[Boom Bang-a-Bang]]\" ({{escyr|1969}} tied), [[Brotherhood of Man]] with \"[[Save Your Kisses for Me]]\" ({{escyr|1976}}), [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]] with \"[[Making Your Mind Up]]\" ({{escyr|1981}}) and [[Katrina and the Waves]] with \"[[Love, Shine a Light]]\" ({{escyr|1997}}). The UK has also finished as [[runner-up]] on a record 15 occasions; with [[Pearl Carr & Teddy Johnson]] ({{escyr|1959}}), [[Bryan Johnson (singer)|Bryan Johnson]] ({{escyr|1960}}), [[The Allisons]] ({{escyr|1961}}), [[Matt Monro]] ({{escyr|1964}}), [[Kathy Kirby]] ({{escyr|1965}}), [[Cliff Richard]] ({{escyr|1968}}), [[Mary Hopkin]] ({{escyr|1970}}), [[The New Seekers]] ({{escyr|1972}}), [[The Shadows]] ({{escyr|1975}}), [[Lynsey de Paul]] and [[Michael Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] ({{escyr|1977}}), [[Scott Fitzgerald (singer)|Scott Fitzgerald]] ({{escyr|1988}}), [[Live Report]] ({{escyr|1989}}), [[Michael Ball]] ({{escyr|1992}}), [[Sonia (singer)|Sonia]] ({{escyr|1993}}) and [[Imaani]] ({{escyr|1998}}). The United Kingdom finished outside the top ten on only three occasions at the contest in the 20th century ({{escyr|1978}}, {{escyr|1987}} and {{escyr|1999}}).\n\nIn the 21st century, the United Kingdom has a considerably poorer record in the competition, only reaching the top ten twice, with [[Jessica Garlick]] third ([[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002]]) and [[Jade Ewen]] fifth ([[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009]]). Since 2003, the UK have finished outside the top 20 on ten occasions, including [[Jemini]]'s infamous [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]] \"''nul points''\" result, which was the first time that the country had come last in the contest. The UK has since finished last in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]] with [[Andy Abraham]] (14 points), in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]] with [[Josh Dubovie]] (10 points), and in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2019|2019]] with [[Michael Rice (singer)|Michael Rice]] (11 points).\n\n==History==\n===1950s to 1970s===\nIt was alleged that the United Kingdom were expected to take part in the first contest in 1956, and that they missed the submission deadline and therefore could not take part. This was later revealed by the EBU in January 2017 to be a mythical fact created by fans of the contest.<ref name=\"UK BBC\">{{cite web|last1=Jordan|first1=Paul|title=Shining a light on the United Kingdom: 60 Years at Eurovision|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=shining_a_light_on_the_united_kingdom_60_years_at_eurovision|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=13 January 2017|date=11 January 2017|quote=Contrary to popular fan myths, the UK did not intend to enter in 1956 as the BBC had previously created their own separate contest, the Festival Of British Popular Songs}}</ref> The EBU further went on to explain that the ''[[Festival of British Popular Song]]'', a contest created by the [[BBC]] for the United Kingdom, was the inspiration that brought in format changes to the contest elements from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1957]] onwards.<ref name=\"UK BBC\"/> [[Patricia Bredin]] was the first performer to represent the UK at Eurovision, finishing seventh in 1957. The UK was the first choice to stage the third contest in 1958, however following a failure to get an agreement from various artistic unions, the BBC withdrew their bid in the summer of 1957 and the UK did not enter for the second and last time to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=250963|title=Shining a light on the United Kingdom: 60 Years at Eurovision|work=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt their second attempt in the contest in 1959, the UK achieved the first of their record fifteen runner-up positions, when [[Pearl Carr]] and [[Teddy Johnson]] sang \"[[Sing, Little Birdie]]\". The UK would achieve four more second-place finishes with [[Bryan Johnson (singer)|Bryan Johnson]] in 1960, [[The Allisons]] in 1961, [[Matt Monro]] in 1964 and [[Kathy Kirby]] in 1965, before eventually winning for the first time in 1967. [[Sandie Shaw]] was already a successful performer, having twice topped the UK singles chart and she comfortably won in [[Vienna]] with \"[[Puppet on a String]]\", which became her third UK number one and topped the charts all around Europe. In 1968, another successful performer was selected to represent the UK with the song \"[[Congratulations (Cliff Richard song)|Congratulations]]\". In London, [[Cliff Richard]] gave the UK their sixth second-place finish, losing to Spain's [[Massiel]]. \"Congratulations\" remains one of only two non-winning UK Eurovision songs to top the UK charts. The UK's second victory was provided by the Scottish singer Lulu, who won with the song \"[[Boom Bang-a-Bang]]\" in 1969, in a four-way tie with France, Spain and the Netherlands. Another established performer, she had reached the US #1 spot with \"[[To Sir with Love (song)|To Sir with Love]]\" in 1967.\n\nHaving finished second on three further occasions in the 1970s, with [[Mary Hopkin]] in 1970, [[The New Seekers]] in 1972 and [[The Shadows]] in 1975. The UK achieved their third victory in 1976 with [[Brotherhood of Man]] and \"[[Save Your Kisses for Me]]\", who won with 164 points, which would remain the highest points total for ten years. In 1977, the UK finished second for the tenth time represented by singer-songwriters [[Lynsey de Paul]] and [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]].\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\nThe UK's fourth victory came in 1981, with [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]] and \"[[Making Your Mind Up]]\". The group was created especially for the UK televised selection contest, \"A Song for Europe\" (a programme which in later years would be renamed to \"Making Your Mind Up\"). At Eurovision in Dublin, they defeated Germany's [[Lena Valaitis]] by four points. The group went on to continued success, with 13 UK top 40 hits over the next five years. This would be the last UK win for 16 years, although the country continued to be competitive at the contest with four more second-place results during this time. In 1988, [[Scott Fitzgerald (singer)|Scott Fitzgerald]] lost to [[Celine Dion]], who was representing Switzerland, by just one point. In 1989, [[Live Report]] lost out to Yugoslavia by seven points. [[Michael Ball]] in 1992, also finished second, behind [[Linda Martin]] of Ireland. The 1993 entry, [[Sonia (singer)|Sonia]], had already had 10 UK top 30 hits, including a 1989 number one with \"[[You'll Never Stop Me Loving You]]\", when she was selected to represent the UK in [[Millstreet]]. With one country (Malta) left to vote, Ireland's [[Niamh Kavanagh]] led Sonia by 11 points. By the time it got to the announcement of the 12 points, neither the UK or Ireland had been mentioned. If the UK had received the 12, they would have won by one point. In the end Ireland received the top marks and won by 23 points. Despite only finishing eighth in the 1996 contest, [[Gina G]] went on to huge success with her entry \"[[Ooh Ah Just a Little Bit]]\", which became only the second non-winning UK entry to top the UK Singles chart. It also reached the US top 20 and received a Grammy nomination. The UK's fifth victory finally came in 1997, when [[Katrina and the Waves]], famous for their 1980s hit \"[[Walking on Sunshine (Katrina and the Waves song)|Walking on Sunshine]]\", comfortably won the contest with the song \"[[Love, Shine a Light]]\". They scored 227 points, which would remain the highest points total of the pre semi-final era.  At the 1998 contest in [[Birmingham]], [[Imaani]] achieved the UK's 15th second-place finish and 20th top two result, with the song \"[[Where Are You? (Imaani song)|Where Are You?]]\", losing to Israel's [[Dana International]]. The UK, as of 2019, has not finished in the top two since.\n\n===21st century===\nThe UK has fared less well in the contest in the 21st century. Since girl-group [[Precious (band)|Precious]] finished 12th in 1999, the UK has failed to reach the top ten in all but two of the last 21 contests (1999\u20132019) \u2013 the exceptions being [[Jessica Garlick]], who finished joint third in 2002 with the song \"[[Come Back (Jessica Garlick song)|Come Back]]\" (the UK's only top three result of the century), and [[Jade Ewen]]. Ewen in particular, was praised for ending the country's poor run of results for much of the decade, by finishing fifth in 2009 with the song \"[[It's My Time (Jade Ewen song)|It's My Time]]\", written by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Diane Warren]].

The process has varied between selecting both performer and song, or just the song, with the artist being selected internally.\n\nFor most years the public has been able to vote for the winner, in the past with postcard voting, where the viewers sent postcards with their vote to the BBC, but more recently [[televoting]] and online. In 2009 and 2010, the singer was chosen by a public vote and the song internally selected. From 2011 to 2015, there was no televised selection, and both the artist and song were selected internally by the BBC. This resulted in the national selection process being suspended; however, this returned in 2016, re-titled ''[[Eurovision: You Decide]]'', with viewers once again choosing which song to enter into the contest. Since 2017, the votes from a professional jury panel have been combined with the public vote to select the winner.\n\nIn September 2019, it was announced that the BBC would not hold a public selection for the 2020 contest, and that [[BBC Studios]] would partner with record label [[BMG Rights Management|BMG]] to produce and release its entry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-49715308|title=BBC drops Eurovision selection public vote|date=16 September 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n== Contestants ==\n{{See also|UK Eurovision Song Contest entries discography}}\nBelow is a list of all songs and their respective performers that have represented the United Kingdom in the contest:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/country/united-kingdom|title=United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|website=eurovision.tv|accessdate=19 February 2019}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n| width=\"15\" bgcolor=\"gold\" |{{center|1}}\n|Winner\n|-\n|bgcolor=silver|{{center|2}}\n|Second place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#c96|{{center|3}}\n|Third place\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#fe8080\" |{{center|\u25c1}}\n|Last place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#A4EAA9|{{center|{{small|{{Abbr|W.|Withdrew}}}}}}\n|Contest cancelled\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n! width=\"30\" |Year\n!Language\n!Performer(s)\n!Song\n! width=\"50\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |Final\n! width=\"50\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |Points\n! width=\"50\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |Semi\n! width=\"50\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |Points\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1957}}\n|[[English language|English]]\n|[[Patricia Bredin]]\n|\"[[All (song)|All]]\"\n|align=center|7\n|align=center|6\n|colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"-99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1958}}}}\n|colspan=\"7\" {{N/A|Did not participate}} \n|-style=\"background:silver;\"\n!{{Escyr|1959}}\n|English\n|[[Pearl Carr & Teddy Johnson]]\n|\"[[Sing, Little Birdie]]\"\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|16\n|colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"37\" data-sort-value=\"-99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-style=\"background:silver;\"\n!{{Escyr|1960}}\n|English\n|[[Bryan Johnson (singer)|Bryan Johnson]]\n|\"[[Looking High, High, High]]\"\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|25\n|-style=\"background:silver;\"\n!{{Escyr|1961}}\n|English\n|[[Allisons|The Allisons]]\n|\"[[Are You Sure?

Israel and Norway both received 2 points less than originally and Croatia, Malta, Portugal, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Belgium, Estonia and Turkey all received one point less than indicated during the broadcast.}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1999}}\n|English\n|[[Precious (band)|Precious]]\n|\"[[Say It Again (Precious song)|Say It Again]]\"\n|align=center|12\n|align=center|38\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2000}}\n|English\n|[[Nicki French]]\n|\"[[Don't Play That Song Again]]\"\n|align=center|16\n|align=center|28\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2001}}\n|English\n|[[Lindsay Dracass|Lindsay]]\n|\"[[No Dream Impossible]]\"\n|align=center|15\n|align=center|28\n|-style=\"background:#c96;\"\n!{{Escyr|2002}}\n|English\n|[[Jessica Garlick]]\n|\"[[Come Back (Jessica Garlick song)|Come Back]]\"\n|align=center|3\n|align=center|111\n|-style=\"background:#fe8080;\"\n!{{Escyr|2003}}\n|English\n|[[Jemini]]\n|\"[[Cry Baby (Jemini song)|Cry Baby]]\"\n|align=center|26 \u25c1\n|align=center|0\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2004}}\n|English\n|[[James Fox (singer)|James Fox]]\n|\"[[Hold Onto Our Love]]\"\n|align=center|16\n|align=center|29\n|colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"7\" {{n/a|Member of the \"Big 4\"}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2005}}\n|English\n|[[Javine Hylton]]\n|\"[[Touch My Fire]]\"\n|align=center|22\n|align=center|18\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2006}}\n|English\n|[[Daz Sampson]]\n|\"[[Teenage Life]]\"\n|align=center|19\n|align=center|25\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2007}}\n|English\n|[[Scooch]]\n|\"[[Flying the Flag (for You)]]\"\n|align=center|22\n|align=center|19\n|-style=\"background:#fe8080;\"\n!{{Escyr|2008}}\n|English\n|[[Andy Abraham]]\n|\"[[Even If (Andy Abraham song)|Even If]]\"\n|align=center|25 \u25c1\n|align=center|14\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2009}}\n|English\n|[[Jade Ewen]]\n|\"[[It's My Time (Eurovision song)|It's My Time]]\"\n|align=center|5\n|align=center|173\n|-style=\"background:#fe8080;\"\n!{{Escyr|2010}}\n|English\n|[[Josh Dubovie]]\n|\"[[That Sounds Good to Me]]\"\n|align=center|25 \u25c1\n|align=center|10\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2011}}\n|English\n|[[Blue (English band)|Blue]]\n|\"[[I Can (Blue song)|I Can]]\"\n|align=center|11\n|align=center|100\n|colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"10\" {{n/a|Member of the \"Big 5\"}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2012}}\n|English\n|[[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]\n|\"[[Love Will Set You Free]]\"\n|align=center|25\n|align=center|12\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2013}}\n|English\n|[[Bonnie Tyler]]\n|\"[[Believe in Me (Bonnie Tyler song)|Believe in Me]]\"\n|align=center|19\n|align=center|23\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2014}}\n|English\n|[[Molly Smitten-Downes|Molly]]\n|\"[[Children of the Universe]]\"\n|align=center|17\n|align=center|40\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2015}}\n|English\n|[[Electro Velvet]]\n|\"[[Still in Love with You (Electro Velvet song)|Still in Love with You]]\"\n|align=center|24\n|align=center|5\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2016}}\n|English\n|[[Joe and Jake]]\n|\"[[You're Not Alone (Joe and Jake song)|You're Not Alone]]\"\n|align=center|24\n|align=center|62\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2017}}\n|English\n|[[Lucie Jones]]\n|\"[[Never Give Up on You]]\"\n|align=center|15\n|align=center|111\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2018}}\n|English\n|[[SuRie]]\n|\"[[Storm (SuRie song)|Storm]]\"\n|align=center|24\n|align=center|48\n|-style=\"background:#fe8080;\"\n!{{Escyr|2019}}\n|English\n|[[Michael Rice (singer)|Michael Rice]]\n|\"[[Bigger than Us (Michael Rice song)|Bigger than Us]]\"\n|align=center|26 \u25c1\n|align=center|11\n|-bgcolor=\"#A4EAA9\"\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|2020}}}}{{Efn|2020 contest was cancelled due to 2019-20 pandemic of Coronavirus.}}\n|English\n|[[James Newman (musician)|James Newman]]\n|\"[[My Last Breath]]\"\n|colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|Cancelled}}\n|}\n\n===Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest===\n{{further|Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest}}\n\nAlthough the United Kingdom was entered twice into ''[[Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest]]'', with [[Cliff Richard]]'s 1968 runner-up entry \"[[Congratulations (Cliff Richard song)|Congratulations]]\" and [[Brotherhood of Man]]'s 1976 winning song \"[[Save Your Kisses for Me]]\", the [[BBC]] decided not to air the event or participate in the voting, but instead aired an hour-long special programme entitled ''[[Boom Bang-a-Bang: 50 Years of Eurovision]]'' hosted by [[Terry Wogan]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Artist\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Language\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Title\n!colspan=\"4\"|At Congratulations\n!colspan=\"3\"|At Eurovision\n|-\n!

They first participated in the second contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1957|1957]]. The UK has entered every year since [[Eurovision Song Contest 1959|1959]], and along with [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Sweden]] and the [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest|Netherlands]], is one of only three countries with Eurovision victories in four different decades. The United Kingdom is one of the \"[[Eurovision Song Contest#Big Four and Big Five|Big 5]]\", along with [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|France]], [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest|Germany]], [[Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest|Italy]] and [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spain]] who are automatically allowed to participate in the final as they are the five biggest financial contributors to the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU). The British public broadcaster, the BBC, broadcasts the event each year and organises the [[UK national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest|national selection]] for the entry. The UK has won the contest five times, and has finished second on a record fifteen times.\n\nThe United Kingdom's five winners are [[Sandie Shaw]] with the song \"[[Puppet on a String]]\" ({{escyr|1967}}), [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] with \"[[Boom Bang-a-Bang]]\" ({{escyr|1969}} tied), [[Brotherhood of Man]] with \"[[Save Your Kisses for Me]]\" ({{escyr|1976}}), [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]] with \"[[Making Your Mind Up]]\" ({{escyr|1981}}) and [[Katrina and the Waves]] with \"[[Love, Shine a Light]]\" ({{escyr|1997}}). The UK has also finished as [[runner-up]] on a record 15 occasions; with [[Pearl Carr & Teddy Johnson]] ({{escyr|1959}}), [[Bryan Johnson (singer)|Bryan Johnson]] ({{escyr|1960}}), [[The Allisons]] ({{escyr|1961}}), [[Matt Monro]] ({{escyr|1964}}), [[Kathy Kirby]] ({{escyr|1965}}), [[Cliff Richard]] ({{escyr|1968}}), [[Mary Hopkin]] ({{escyr|1970}}), [[The New Seekers]] ({{escyr|1972}}), [[The Shadows]] ({{escyr|1975}}), [[Lynsey de Paul]] and [[Michael Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] ({{escyr|1977}}), [[Scott Fitzgerald (singer)|Scott Fitzgerald]] ({{escyr|1988}}), [[Live Report]] ({{escyr|1989}}), [[Michael Ball]] ({{escyr|1992}}), [[Sonia (singer)|Sonia]] ({{escyr|1993}}) and [[Imaani]] ({{escyr|1998}}). The United Kingdom finished outside the top ten on only three occasions at the contest in the 20th century ({{escyr|1978}}, {{escyr|1987}} and {{escyr|1999}}).\n\nIn the 21st century, the United Kingdom has a considerably poorer record in the competition, only reaching the top ten twice, with [[Jessica Garlick]] third ([[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002]]) and [[Jade Ewen]] fifth ([[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009]]). Since 2003, the UK have finished outside the top 20 on ten occasions, including [[Jemini]]'s infamous [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]] \"''nul points''\" result, which was the first time that the country had come last in the contest. The UK has since finished last in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]] with [[Andy Abraham]] (14 points), in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]] with [[Josh Dubovie]] (10 points), and in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2019|2019]] with [[Michael Rice (singer)|Michael Rice]] (11 points).\n\n==History==\n===1950s to 1970s===\nIt was alleged that the United Kingdom were expected to take part in the first contest in 1956, and that they missed the submission deadline and therefore could not take part.

[[Sandie Shaw]] was already a successful performer, having twice topped the UK singles chart and she comfortably won in [[Vienna]] with \"[[Puppet on a String]]\", which became her third UK number one and topped the charts all around Europe. In 1968, another successful performer was selected to represent the UK with the song \"[[Congratulations (Cliff Richard song)|Congratulations]]\". In London, [[Cliff Richard]] gave the UK their sixth second-place finish, losing to Spain's [[Massiel]]. \"Congratulations\" remains one of only two non-winning UK Eurovision songs to top the UK charts. The UK's second victory was provided by the Scottish singer Lulu, who won with the song \"[[Boom Bang-a-Bang]]\" in 1969, in a four-way tie with France, Spain and the Netherlands. Another established performer, she had reached the US #1 spot with \"[[To Sir with Love (song)|To Sir with Love]]\" in 1967.\n\nHaving finished second on three further occasions in the 1970s, with [[Mary Hopkin]] in 1970, [[The New Seekers]] in 1972 and [[The Shadows]] in 1975. The UK achieved their third victory in 1976 with [[Brotherhood of Man]] and \"[[Save Your Kisses for Me]]\", who won with 164 points, which would remain the highest points total for ten years. In 1977, the UK finished second for the tenth time represented by singer-songwriters [[Lynsey de Paul]] and [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]].\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\nThe UK's fourth victory came in 1981, with [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]] and \"[[Making Your Mind Up]]\". The group was created especially for the UK televised selection contest, \"A Song for Europe\" (a programme which in later years would be renamed to \"Making Your Mind Up\"). At Eurovision in Dublin, they defeated Germany's [[Lena Valaitis]] by four points. The group went on to continued success, with 13 UK top 40 hits over the next five years. This would be the last UK win for 16 years, although the country continued to be competitive at the contest with four more second-place results during this time. In 1988, [[Scott Fitzgerald (singer)|Scott Fitzgerald]] lost to [[Celine Dion]], who was representing Switzerland, by just one point. In 1989, [[Live Report]] lost out to Yugoslavia by seven points. [[Michael Ball]] in 1992, also finished second, behind [[Linda Martin]] of Ireland. The 1993 entry, [[Sonia (singer)|Sonia]], had already had 10 UK top 30 hits, including a 1989 number one with \"[[You'll Never Stop Me Loving You]]\", when she was selected to represent the UK in [[Millstreet]]. With one country (Malta) left to vote, Ireland's [[Niamh Kavanagh]] led Sonia by 11 points. By the time it got to the announcement of the 12 points, neither the UK or Ireland had been mentioned. If the UK had received the 12, they would have won by one point. In the end Ireland received the top marks and won by 23 points. Despite only finishing eighth in the 1996 contest, [[Gina G]] went on to huge success with her entry \"[[Ooh Ah Just a Little Bit]]\", which became only the second non-winning UK entry to top the UK Singles chart. It also reached the US top 20 and received a Grammy nomination. The UK's fifth victory finally came in 1997, when [[Katrina and the Waves]], famous for their 1980s hit \"[[Walking on Sunshine (Katrina and the Waves song)|Walking on Sunshine]]\", comfortably won the contest with the song \"[[Love, Shine a Light]]\". They scored 227 points, which would remain the highest points total of the pre semi-final era.  At the 1998 contest in [[Birmingham]], [[Imaani]] achieved the UK's 15th second-place finish and 20th top two result, with the song \"[[Where Are You? (Imaani song)|Where Are You?]]\", losing to Israel's [[Dana International]]. The UK, as of 2019, has not finished in the top two since.\n\n===21st century===\nThe UK has fared less well in the contest in the 21st century. Since girl-group [[Precious (band)|Precious]] finished 12th in 1999, the UK has failed to reach the top ten in all but two of the last 21 contests (1999\u20132019) \u2013 the exceptions being [[Jessica Garlick]], who finished joint third in 2002 with the song \"[[Come Back (Jessica Garlick song)|Come Back]]\" (the UK's only top three result of the century), and [[Jade Ewen]]. Ewen in particular, was praised for ending the country's poor run of results for much of the decade, by finishing fifth in 2009 with the song \"[[It's My Time (Jade Ewen song)|It's My Time]]\", written by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Diane Warren]]. In 2003, the UK finished last for the first time with the duo [[Jemini]], who received the infamous \"nul points\". This remains the only time the UK has failed to score a single point. The country has finished last on three further occasions, with [[Andy Abraham]], who received 14 points in 2008, [[Josh Dubovie]], who received 10 points in 2010, and [[Michael Rice (singer)|Michael Rice]] who received 11 points in 2019.\n\nIn 2011, the BBC chose the boy band [[Blue (English band)|Blue]] to represent the UK, they finished 11th with 100 points. In 2012, the UK were facing calls to quit the contest when the UK entry, [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], finished 25th (out of 26) with only 12 points.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lawson |first=Mark |title=A belligerent Eurovision night fit for a broken Europe |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-radio/2012/may/27/belligerent-eurovision-broken-europe?newsfeed=true |newspaper= (The Guardian) |date=27 May 2012 |accessdate=9 June 2012}}{{Dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref> However, the UK confirmed their participation in the 2013 contest, with the Welsh singer [[Bonnie Tyler]], most famous for her 1983 US and UK number one hit \"[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]\", who would perform the song \"[[Believe in Me (Bonnie Tyler song)|Believe in Me]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/malmo-2013/about/show/grand-final |work=Eurovision Song Contest |title=Bonnie Tyler |accessdate=15 May 2014}}</ref> In Malm\u00f6, she finished 19th with 23 points.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/malmo-2013/about/shows/grand-final |work=Eurovision.tv |title=2013 results |accessdate=15 May 2014}}</ref> She went on to win two internationally voted Eurovision Song Contest radio awards for Best Female Singer and Best Song.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mourinho |first=Daniel |url=http://www.escradio.com/2013/07/bonnie-tyler-receives-esc-radio-award-trophies/|title=Bonnie Tyler receives ESC Radio Award trophies |publisher=Eurovision Song Contest Radio |accessdate=4 January 2013 |date=1 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, the BBC internally selected unknown singer [[Molly Smitten-Downes]], through [[BBC Introducing]], which supports new and unsigned acts.

The process has varied between selecting both performer and song, or just the song, with the artist being selected internally.\n\nFor most years the public has been able to vote for the winner, in the past with postcard voting, where the viewers sent postcards with their vote to the BBC, but more recently [[televoting]] and online. In 2009 and 2010, the singer was chosen by a public vote and the song internally selected. From 2011 to 2015, there was no televised selection, and both the artist and song were selected internally by the BBC. This resulted in the national selection process being suspended; however, this returned in 2016, re-titled ''[[Eurovision: You Decide]]'', with viewers once again choosing which song to enter into the contest. Since 2017, the votes from a professional jury panel have been combined with the public vote to select the winner.\n\nIn September 2019, it was announced that the BBC would not hold a public selection for the 2020 contest, and that [[BBC Studios]] would partner with record label [[BMG Rights Management|BMG]] to produce and release its entry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-49715308|title=BBC drops Eurovision selection public vote|date=16 September 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n== Contestants ==\n{{See also|UK Eurovision Song Contest entries discography}}\nBelow is a list of all songs and their respective performers that have represented the United Kingdom in the contest:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/country/united-kingdom|title=United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|website=eurovision.tv|accessdate=19 February 2019}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n| width=\"15\" bgcolor=\"gold\" |{{center|1}}\n|Winner\n|-\n|bgcolor=silver|{{center|2}}\n|Second place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#c96|{{center|3}}\n|Third place\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#fe8080\" |{{center|\u25c1}}\n|Last place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#A4EAA9|{{small|{{center|{{Abbr|W.|Withdrew}}}}}}\n|Contest cancelled\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n! width=\"30\" |Year\n!Language\n!Performer(s)\n!Song\n! width=\"50\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |Final\n! width=\"50\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |Points\n! width=\"50\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |Semi\n! width=\"50\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |Points\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1957}}\n|[[English language|English]]\n|[[Patricia Bredin]]\n|\"[[All (song)|All]]\"\n|align=center|7\n|align=center|6\n|colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"-99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1958}}}}\n|colspan=\"7\" {{N/A|Did not participate}} \n|-style=\"background:silver;\"\n!{{Escyr|1959}}\n|English\n|[[Pearl Carr & Teddy Johnson]]\n|\"[[Sing, Little Birdie]]\"\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|16\n|colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"37\" data-sort-value=\"-99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-style=\"background:silver;\"\n!{{Escyr|1960}}\n|English\n|[[Bryan Johnson (singer)|Bryan Johnson]]\n|\"[[Looking High, High, High]]\"\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|25\n|-style=\"background:silver;\"\n!{{Escyr|1961}}\n|English\n|[[Allisons|The Allisons]]\n|\"[[Are You Sure?
