Liam is the public face of the company and its flagship program Rehoboam, a sophisticated artificial intelligence, which Dolores is trying to gain access to. Liam knows little himself since it was his father and a man named Serac who built it, but as he is about to reveal Serac's name Dolores is knocked out by Martin, Liam's head of security who discovered Dolores' deception. Martin intends to kill Dolores, but she instead lures him into a trap, which allows her to replace Martin with a host. Martin names the partner as Serac. Dolores is wounded in a firefight, but is aided by Caleb, a former soldier that is trying to eke out an existence as a construction worker and petty criminal who had seen Martin try to kill her. Elsewhere, Bernard stays ahead of a manhunt for him and intends to travel to Westworld, while the Charlotte host takes control of Delos.

Maeve is rescued from Warworld by Hector but realizes this is another narrative, and kills herself to come to in Operations, where she finds that Lee is alive and wants to help get her to the Forge. However, Maeve soon realizes that this is all a virtual reality simulation, and after testing its bounds, breaks her pearl free from its real-world location, but guards stop the attempt.

Liam is the public face of the company and its flagship program Rehoboam, a sophisticated artificial intelligence, which Dolores is trying to gain access to. Liam knows little himself since it was his father and a man named Serac who built it, but as he is about to reveal Serac's name Dolores is knocked out by Martin, Liam's head of security who discovered Dolores' deception. Martin intends to kill Dolores, but she instead lures him into a trap, which allows her to replace Martin with a host. Martin names the partner as Serac. Dolores is wounded in a firefight, but is aided by Caleb, a former soldier that is trying to eke out an existence as a construction worker and petty criminal who had seen Martin try to kill her.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh. In 1999 MdHS sent the journal to the Center for Conservation in Philadelphia where it was rebound, deacidified, and given full conservation treatment.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219030526/http://www.mdhs.org/underbelly/2014/02/06/the-dreams-of-benjamin-banneker/|archivedate=2018-02-19}}<br>(2) {{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302003904/http://m60006.eos-intl.net/M60006/OPAC/Details/Record.aspx?SearchType=1&BibCode=MM60006%7C9682055%7C15%7C9318734|archivedate=March 2, 2020|url=http://m60006.eos-intl.net/M60006/OPAC/Details/Record.aspx?SearchType=1&BibCode=MM60006%7C9682055%7C15%7C9318734|title=Banneker Astronomical Journal, 1781; 1790-1802; 1806.|work=[[Maryland Historical Society#Library|H.

Jefferson appointed Andrew Ellicott to conduct the survey; Ellicott made Banneker his assistant for three months in 1791. Benjamin Rush authored the Department of Peace proposal; the confusion arose among earlier biographers because the proposal appeared in Banneker's 1793 almanac.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20171226172141/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 7.] \"The name of Benjamin Banneker, the Afro-American self-taught mathematician and almanac-maker, occurs again and again in the several published accounts of the survey of Washington City begun in 1791, but with conflicting reports of the role which he played. Writers have implied a wide range of involvement, from the keeper of horses or supervisor of the woodcutters, to the full responsibility of not only the survey of the ten mile square but the design of the city as well. None of these accounts has described the contribution which Banneker actually made.\"<br>(2) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/126 Bedini, 1971, p. 126.] \"Benjamin Banneker's name does not appear on any of the contemporary documents or records relating to the selection, planning, and survey of the City of Washington.  An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.  Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital had not yet been built, and there was no White House.\"<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up Bedini, 1999, p. 136.] \"Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred some time late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br />(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

It was the capital of ''Pagus Tornodorensis''. Here, in the valley of the [[Arman\u00e7on River|Arman\u00e7on]], the County of Tonnerre was created, which served as a point of passage between Paris and Dijon, during a time when the King of France had designs on the Duchy of Burgundy.\n\nThree etymologies of Tonnerre are rooted in the Celtic era: it is derived from ''Torn'' an obscure local deity; others claim it is from ''Douros'', meaning fortress; yet others say it is connected to a ''place near the torrent''. It is equally likely that the three solutions are one:\n\n*In 1782, newly discovered caves yielded weapons, ornaments, coins and jewelry linked to the worship of deities.\n*The dominant fortress of Tonnerre was located upon the sites \u201cMont Bellant\u201d and \u201cVieux Ch\u00e2teaux\u201d which yield many ancient artifacts.\n*Amongst the overwhelming evidence of the area's religious heritage is the [[Fosse Dionne]].\n\n==History==\n===Antiquity===\nIn 2005, research at a place called ''Les Petits Ovis'' revealed that the site was occupied by a [[necropolis]] dating to the end of the [[Bronze Age]]. At a place called ''Terre de Vauplaine'' burials and cremations from the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Iron Age]] have been found.\n\nAn ''[[oppidum]]'' dating to the [[La T\u00e8ne]] period developed on the high part of the City of Tonnerre. Later, a rural [[Gallo-Roman|Roman Gaul]] settlement was built whose boundaries are not well-established.\n\n===Medieval county===\nDuring this period many tanneries appeared along the banks of the [[Arman\u00e7on]] or near the [[Fosse Dionne]].\n\n====Dynasty of the native counts====\nTonnerre was the seat of a County starting in the 10th century. They administered the western edge of the vast bishopric of Langres. Several members of this family rose to rule this bishopric. Its seat may have been in the Bar-sur-Seine area. The counts, known by the charters of the Abbey of Saint-Michel, bear the name Miles. Succession in the 11th century was more chaotic.\n\nA viscount of Tonnerre appeared at the beginning of this century. Under the law, this meant that the owner of the county had rights to other land as well, which imposes the establishment of a viscount (the same problem arose in Joigny in 1080). This viscount was the origin of the Rougemont family.\n\nThe last heir to this dynasty was the wife of Guillaume the 11th-century Count of Nevers and Auxerre. Guillaume had great difficulty surviving under the tutelage of his uncle, the Duke of Burgundy who killed his father. The marriage of his younger sister to a son of the Count of Brienne provoked the definitive separation of Tonnerre from the [[County of Bar-sur-Seine]].\n\n====Dynasty of Nevers-Auxerre (1045-1193)====\nGuillaume de Nevers ruled the county for a long period of time. A provost became the representative of the administration to the Tonnerrois. The tendency of heredity in comital succession is an admitted weakness. The younger son of Guillaume nearly caused an autonomous county to emerge. The county frequently served as dower to dowager countesses. Some families wield great power in the county; especially the Argenteuil and Rougemont families. Some of them were bestowed with the title of viscount due to profitable commercial ventures in Ligny-le-Chatel. This phenomenon touched other parts of the county as well. The lords of Noyers-sur-Serein evaded comital authority and established an independent hold on the border of Auxerre County and former county of Avallon. Feudalism had reached its peak. By the end of this period the city of Tonnerre had grown considerably. The city had two parishes: Notre-Dame and Saint-Pierre. Around 1170, the counts attempted to reassert control of their powerful feudal lords, but only had limited success: they imposed an inheritance tax. Feudalism was deeply entrenched.\n\n====Dynasty of Courtenay====\nFrom the late 12th to middle of the 13th century, the city of Tonnerre was the most important community in the County of Nevers-Auxerre and Tonnerre. This period came to an end after the count's business misadventures in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Copying an institution in place in royal domains since 1184, the count divided his dominion into two bailiwicks, both administered by the same bailey. The bailey was largely ineffectual. It could not reign in the powerful local feudal lords, clashed with the bishop of Auxerre and lead to the revolt of Herv\u00e9 de Donz; all which humiliated Count Pierre de Courtenay.\nThe head of a junior branch of the de Courtenay came to rule the seigniory of Tanlay.\n\n====Dynasty of Chalon (1308-1463)====\nIn the middle of the 13th century, a countess of Tonnerre married the King of Sicily. She founded the Grand Hotel-Dieu: the largest civil monument in Burgundy.\n\nAfter participating in the division of the County of Nevers-Auxerre and Tonnerre, the Chalon family was given the County of Tonnerre.\n\nAs a prelude to the second phase of the Hundred Years' War, the Count of Tonnerre removed a lady-in-waiting from the court of the Duchess of Burgundy. Jean Sans Peur used this as a pretext to wage war against the Count of Tonnerre. Despite the vast difference in the size of their armies, the count managed to delay his ruin. This desperate struggle had a price: the Tonnerrois region was ravaged. The estates of the feudal lords who followed their natural suzerain into battle were plundered by Burgundian nobles. The war between Armagnacs and Burgundians occurred soon afterwards (1411). Tonnerre remained under the control of the Duchy of Burgundy. During the 15th century, the city received new tax institutions: Aids and the Election.\n\n===French Revolution===\nIt was the capital of the Tonnerre District from 1790 to 1795 and the Arrondissement of Tonnerre from 1800 to 1826.\n\n===World War II===\nThe city was the victim of German bombing in June 1940 and Anglo-American bombing on 25 May 1944, which killed 14 people when a church was hit.\n\n==Heraldry==\n{{Blazon french commune\n| image= Blason gueules-bande or.svg\n| description= \"Gules a Bend Or\"\n| text=\n}}\n\n==List of mayors==\n[[File:LavoirTonnerreFosseDionne041024.jpg|thumb|Wash basin of the Fosse Dionne.]]\n[[File:L'Arman\u00e7on, Tonnerre (Yonne, Fr).JPG|thumb|Arman\u00e7on River near Tonnerre]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Starting in the first decade of the 21st century, the official population of every commune has been published annually. The census is now based on information collected annually, over a five-year period. For communes with fewer than 10,000 people, a census is taken every five years. The official population of the intervening years is determined by interpolation or extrapolation. For this community, this procedure was originally used in 2004.\n\nIn 2014, the commune had 4,759 inhabitants, a change of -9.28% from 2009 (Yonne: -0.46%; France excluding the Department of Moyotte: 2.49%).\n<center>\n'''Population change'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1793\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1800\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1806\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1821\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1831\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1836\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1841\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1846\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1851\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 4012\n| 4261\n| 4190\n| 4023\n| 4242\n| 4271\n| 4184\n| 4427\n| 4672\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1856\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1861\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1866\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1872\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1876\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1881\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1886\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1891\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1896\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 4692\n| 4789\n| 5429\n| 5332\n| 5536\n| 5681\n| 5095\n| 4734\n| 4749\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1901\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1906\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1911\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1921\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1926\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1931\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1936\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1946\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1954\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 4685\n| 4522\n| 4384\n| 4373\n| 4463\n| 4484\n| 4433\n| 4237\n| 4345\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1962\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1968\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1975\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1982\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1990\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1999\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 2004\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 2009\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 2014\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 5595\n| 5834\n| 6336\n| 6007\n| 6008\n| 5979\n| 5440\n| 5246\n| 4759\n|}\n\nFrom 1962 to 1999:  Population without double counting; For the dates afterword: municipal population.<br /> (Sources: [[EHESS]]/Cassini up to 1999 then [[INSEE]] starting in 2006.)\n\n'''Histogram of the population change'''<br />\n[[File:histogram-tonnerre.png|alt=Histogram of the Population Change of Tonnerre]]\n</center>\n\n==Economy==\n* Tonnerre Area Development Center ({{lang-fr|Centre de d\u00e9veloppement du Tonnerrois}}), abbreviated CDT, is a join venture of the Yonne Area Chamber of Commerce and Industry ({{lang-fr|chambre de commerce et d'industrie de l'Yonne}}) or CCI Yonne for short, and the Chamber of Trade.\n* Tonnerre Area Business Incubator ({{lang-fr|[http://www.yonne.cci.fr/equipements-et-territoires/hotel-d-entreprises-du-tonnerrois_fr-000239.html H\u00f4tel d'entreprises du Tonnerrois]}}, managed by CCI Yonne: location of workshops and offices for designers and small business.\n\n==Quality of life==\n2 Flowers out of 4 (in the city category).\n\nCommunities obtain the label of Blooming City ({{lang-fr|Ville fleuri}}) or Blooming Village ({{lang-fr|Village fleuri}}) by participating in the Competition for Cities and Villages in Bloom ({{lang-fr|Concours des villes et villages fleuris}}) which aims to promote quality of life through community [[greening]] across France.<ref>http://www.villes-et-villages-fleuris.com/accueil_1.html</ref>\n\n==Historical sites and monuments==\n[[File:Tonnerre - Hotel-Dieu 6.jpg|thumb|Tonnerre - Hotel-Dieu 6]]\n* Tonnerre Burgundy vineyard\n* The [[Fosse Dionne]], source of the high-flow-rate Vaucluse spring. A circular wash basin and Burgundy-tile-clad gallery was added in the 18th century. This tourist curiosity was dedicated to ancient deity from which the name \u201c''Divona''\u201d, meaning \u201cDivine\u201d evolved into \u201cDionne\u201d.\n* The Old Hospital or [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu Notre-Dame des Fontenilles]], founded in 1293 by Marguerite of Burgundy, it was built in just three years. It was of the first and largest hospitals in Medieval France. The building's dimensions are impressive: it has a {{convert|4500|m2|sqft|adj=on|sp=us|sigfig=1}} roof (originally covered in glazed tiles), main hall that is {{convert|90|m|ft|sp=us}} long by {{convert|18.2|m|ft|sp=us}} wide by {{convert|27|m|ft|sp=us}} high. The ceiling is paneled and the enormous framework is in the form of a hull of an overturned ship. Up to 40 patients could be treated.

There is also an 18th-century chaise longue and museum.\n* \u00c9glise Saint-Pierre, with its Baroque-style fa\u00e7ade, dominates the city and offers a beautiful vista. Originally built in the 9th century, it has undergone many changes. It was nearly destroyed in a fire in 1556, which ravaged Tonnerre. Inside, one will find a pipe organ whose console dates to 1616, a pulpit that was built in 1712-1713 and stained-glass windows that date to the 16th century and restored in 2003. Nothing remains of the 11th century chapel.\n* \u00c9glise Notre-Dame de Tonnerre is a 12th-century gothic church.

It was the capital of ''Pagus Tornodorensis''. Here, in the valley of the [[Arman\u00e7on River|Arman\u00e7on]], the County of Tonnerre was created, which served as a point of passage between Paris and Dijon, during a time when the King of France had designs on the Duchy of Burgundy.\n\nThree etymologies of Tonnerre are rooted in the Celtic era: it is derived from ''Torn'' an obscure local deity; others claim it is from ''Douros'', meaning fortress; yet others say it is connected to a ''place near the torrent''. It is equally likely that the three solutions are one:\n\n*In 1782, newly discovered caves yielded weapons, ornaments, coins and jewelry linked to the worship of deities.\n*The dominant fortress of Tonnerre was located upon the sites \u201cMont Bellant\u201d and \u201cVieux Ch\u00e2teaux\u201d which yield many ancient artifacts.\n*Amongst the overwhelming evidence of the area's religious heritage is the [[Fosse Dionne]].\n\n==History==\n===Antiquity===\nIn 2005, research at a place called ''Les Petits Ovis'' revealed that the site was occupied by a [[necropolis]] dating to the end of the [[Bronze Age]]. At a place called ''Terre de Vauplaine'' burials and cremations from the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Iron Age]] have been found.\n\nAn ''[[oppidum]]'' dating to the [[La T\u00e8ne]] period developed on the high part of the City of Tonnerre. Later, a rural [[Gallo-Roman|Roman Gaul]] settlement was built whose boundaries are not well-established.\n\n===Medieval county===\nDuring this period many tanneries appeared along the banks of the [[Arman\u00e7on]] or near the [[Fosse Dionne]].\n\n====Dynasty of the native counts====\nTonnerre was the seat of a County starting in the 10th century. They administered the western edge of the vast bishopric of Langres. Several members of this family rose to rule this bishopric. Its seat may have been in the Bar-sur-Seine area. The counts, known by the charters of the Abbey of Saint-Michel, bear the name Miles. Succession in the 11th century was more chaotic.\n\nA viscount of Tonnerre appeared at the beginning of this century. Under the law, this meant that the owner of the county had rights to other land as well, which imposes the establishment of a viscount (the same problem arose in Joigny in 1080). This viscount was the origin of the Rougemont family.\n\nThe last heir to this dynasty was the wife of Guillaume the 11th-century Count of Nevers and Auxerre. Guillaume had great difficulty surviving under the tutelage of his uncle, the Duke of Burgundy who killed his father. The marriage of his younger sister to a son of the Count of Brienne provoked the definitive separation of Tonnerre from the [[County of Bar-sur-Seine]].\n\n====Dynasty of Nevers-Auxerre (1045-1193)====\nGuillaume de Nevers ruled the county for a long period of time. A provost became the representative of the administration to the Tonnerrois. The tendency of heredity in comital succession is an admitted weakness. The younger son of Guillaume nearly caused an autonomous county to emerge. The county frequently served as dower to dowager countesses. Some families wield great power in the county; especially the Argenteuil and Rougemont families. Some of them were bestowed with the title of viscount due to profitable commercial ventures in Ligny-le-Chatel. This phenomenon touched other parts of the county as well. The lords of Noyers-sur-Serein evaded comital authority and established an independent hold on the border of Auxerre County and former county of Avallon. Feudalism had reached its peak. By the end of this period the city of Tonnerre had grown considerably. The city had two parishes: Notre-Dame and Saint-Pierre. Around 1170, the counts attempted to reassert control of their powerful feudal lords, but only had limited success: they imposed an inheritance tax. Feudalism was deeply entrenched.\n\n====Dynasty of Courtenay====\nFrom the late 12th to middle of the 13th century, the city of Tonnerre was the most important community in the County of Nevers-Auxerre and Tonnerre. This period came to an end after the count's business misadventures in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Copying an institution in place in royal domains since 1184, the count divided his dominion into two bailiwicks, both administered by the same bailey. The bailey was largely ineffectual. It could not reign in the powerful local feudal lords, clashed with the bishop of Auxerre and lead to the revolt of Herv\u00e9 de Donz; all which humiliated Count Pierre de Courtenay.\nThe head of a junior branch of the de Courtenay came to rule the seigniory of Tanlay.\n\n====Dynasty of Chalon (1308-1463)====\nIn the middle of the 13th century, a countess of Tonnerre married the King of Sicily. She founded the Grand Hotel-Dieu: the largest civil monument in Burgundy.\n\nAfter participating in the division of the County of Nevers-Auxerre and Tonnerre, the Chalon family was given the County of Tonnerre.\n\nAs a prelude to the second phase of the Hundred Years' War, the Count of Tonnerre removed a lady-in-waiting from the court of the Duchess of Burgundy. Jean Sans Peur used this as a pretext to wage war against the Count of Tonnerre. Despite the vast difference in the size of their armies, the count managed to delay his ruin. This desperate struggle had a price: the Tonnerrois region was ravaged. The estates of the feudal lords who followed their natural suzerain into battle were plundered by Burgundian nobles. The war between Armagnacs and Burgundians occurred soon afterwards (1411). Tonnerre remained under the control of the Duchy of Burgundy. During the 15th century, the city received new tax institutions: Aids and the Election.\n\n===French Revolution===\nIt was the capital of the Tonnerre District from 1790 to 1795 and the Arronndissement of Tonnerre from 1800 to 1826.\n\n===World War II===\nThe city was the victim of German bombing in June 1940 and Anglo-American bombing on 25 May 1944, which killed 14 people when a church was hit.\n\n==Heraldry==\n{{Blazon french commune\n| image= Blason gueules-bande or.svg\n| description= \"Gules a Bend Or\"\n| text=\n}}\n\n==List of mayors==\n[[File:LavoirTonnerreFosseDionne041024.jpg|thumb|Wash basin of the Fosse Dionne.]]\n[[File:L'Arman\u00e7on, Tonnerre (Yonne, Fr).JPG|thumb|Arman\u00e7on River near Tonnerre]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Starting in the first decade of the 21st century, the official population of every commune has been published annually. The census is now based on information collected annually, over a five-year period. For communes with fewer than 10,000 people, a census is taken every five years. The official population of the intervening years is determined by interpolation or extrapolation. For this community, this procedure was originally used in 2004.\n\nIn 2014, the commune had 4,759 inhabitants, a change of -9.28% from 2009 (Yonne: -0.46%; France excluding the Department of Moyotte: 2.49%).\n<center>\n'''Population change'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1793\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1800\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1806\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1821\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1831\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1836\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1841\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1846\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1851\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 4012\n| 4261\n| 4190\n| 4023\n| 4242\n| 4271\n| 4184\n| 4427\n| 4672\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1856\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1861\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1866\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1872\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1876\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1881\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1886\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1891\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1896\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 4692\n| 4789\n| 5429\n| 5332\n| 5536\n| 5681\n| 5095\n| 4734\n| 4749\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1901\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1906\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1911\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1921\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1926\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1931\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1936\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1946\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1954\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 4685\n| 4522\n| 4384\n| 4373\n| 4463\n| 4484\n| 4433\n| 4237\n| 4345\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1962\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1968\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1975\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1982\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1990\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 1999\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 2004\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 2009\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60\" | 2014\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 5595\n| 5834\n| 6336\n| 6007\n| 6008\n| 5979\n| 5440\n| 5246\n| 4759\n|}\n\nFrom 1962 to 1999:  Population without double counting; For the dates afterword: municipal population.<br /> (Sources: [[EHESS]]/Cassini up to 1999 then [[INSEE]] starting in 2006.)\n\n'''Histogram of the population change'''<br />\n[[File:histogram-tonnerre.png|alt=Histogram of the Population Change of Tonnerre]]\n</center>\n\n==Economy==\n* Tonnerre Area Development Center ({{lang-fr|Centre de d\u00e9veloppement du Tonnerrois}}), abbreviated CDT, is a join venture of the Yonne Area Chamber of Commerce and Industry ({{lang-fr|chambre de commerce et d'industrie de l'Yonne}}) or CCI Yonne for short, and the Chamber of Trade.\n* Tonnerre Area Business Incubator ({{lang-fr|[http://www.yonne.cci.fr/equipements-et-territoires/hotel-d-entreprises-du-tonnerrois_fr-000239.html H\u00f4tel d'entreprises du Tonnerrois]}}, managed by CCI Yonne: location of workshops and offices for designers and small business.\n\n==Quality of life==\n2 Flowers out of 4 (in the city category).\n\nCommunities obtain the label of Blooming City ({{lang-fr|Ville fleuri}}) or Blooming Village ({{lang-fr|Village fleuri}}) by participating in the Competition for Cities and Villages in Bloom ({{lang-fr|Concours des villes et villages fleuris}}) which aims to promote quality of life through community [[greening]] across France.<ref>http://www.villes-et-villages-fleuris.com/accueil_1.html</ref>\n\n==Historical sites and monuments==\n[[File:Tonnerre - Hotel-Dieu 6.jpg|thumb|Tonnerre - Hotel-Dieu 6]]\n* Tonnerre Burgundy vineyard\n* The [[Fosse Dionne]], source of the high-flow-rate Vaucluse spring.

This tourist curiosity was dedicated to ancient deity from which the name \u201c''Divona''\u201d, meaning \u201cDivine\u201d evolved into \u201cDionne\u201d.\n* The Old Hospital or [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu Notre-Dame des Fontenilles]], founded in 1293 by Marguerite of Burgundy, it was built in just three years. It was of the first and largest hospitals in Medieval France. The building's dimensions are impressive: it has a {{convert|4500|m2|sqft|adj=on|sp=us|sigfig=1}} roof (originally covered in glazed tiles), main hall that is {{convert|90|m|ft|sp=us}} long by {{convert|18.2|m|ft|sp=us}} wide by {{convert|27|m|ft|sp=us}} high. The ceiling is paneled and the enormous framework is in the form of a hull of an overturned ship. Up to 40 patients could be treated.

There is also an 18th-century chaise longue and museum.\n* \u00c9glise Saint-Pierre, with its Baroque-style fa\u00e7ade, dominates the city and offers a beautiful vista. Originally built in the 9th century, it has undergone many changes. It was nearly destroyed in a fire in 1556, which ravaged Tonnerre. Inside, one will find a pipe organ whose console dates to 1616, a pulpit that was built in 1712-1713 and stained-glass windows that date to the 16th century and restored in 2003. Nothing remains of the 11th century chapel.\n* \u00c9glise Notre-Dame de Tonnerre is a 12th-century gothic church.

He also says they disliked foreign trade and had no merchant class / would not permit merchants within their territory.\n\nArchaeologists have sought to define the territories of the northern Belgic tribes by looking at the coins they used. The Nervii are associated with a [[stater]] type that uses a Greek [[epsilon]].<ref name=wightman20>{{Citation|title=Gallia Belgica|last=Wightman|first =Edith Mary|year=1985|publisher= University of California Press| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aEyS54uSj88C}} page 20.</ref>\n\nRemarkably, given the archaeological evidence of a Celtic [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] having been present in the pre-Roman past, Caesar reports that the Nervii had no cavalry.

After the alliance broke up and some tribes surrendered, the Nervii, under the command of [[Boduognatus]] and aided by the [[Atrebates]] and [[Viromandui]], came very close to defeating Caesar (the [[Atuatuci]] had also agreed to join them but did not arrive in time). In 57 BC at the [[battle of the Sabis]]  (now identified as the river [[Selle]], near modern [[Saulzoir]]; previously identified as the [[Sambre]]),<ref>Pierre Turquin (\"La Bataille de la Selle (du Sabis) en l' An 57 avant J.-C.\", ''Les \u00c9tudes Classiques'' 23.2 (1955), 113-156)</ref> they concealed themselves in the forests and attacked the approaching Roman column at the river. Their attack was so quick and unexpected that some of the Romans didn't have time to take the covers off their shields or even put on their helmets. The element of surprise briefly left the Romans exposed. However Caesar grabbed a shield, made his way to the front line, and quickly organised his forces; at the same time, the commander of the [[Legio X Gemina|tenth legion]], [[Labienus|Titus Labienus]], attacked the Nervian camp. The two legions who had been guarding the baggage train at the rear arrived and helped to turn the tide of the battle. Caesar says the Nervii were almost annihilated in the battle and is effusive in his tribute to their bravery, calling them \"heroes\".<ref>Julius Caesar, ''Commentarii de Bello Gallico'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2|2]]</ref>\n\nWhen [[Ambiorix]] and the [[Eburones]] rebelled in 53 BC, the remaining Nervii joined the uprising and besieged [[Quintus Tullius Cicero]] \u2013 brother of the orator \u2013 and his legion in their winter camp until they were relieved by Caesar in person.<ref>Julius Caesar, ''Commentarii de Bello Gallico'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 5#38|5.38-52]]</ref>\n\n==Roman period==\n[[File:Old cambrai diocese.png|thumb|right|The medieval diocese of [[Cambrai ]] was based upon the Roman civitas of the Nervii.]]\nThe Nervian [[civitas]] was at [[Bagacum]]. The city was founded to the south of the traditional Nervian territory and is now known as [[Bavay]], a town in France near the Belgian border. The forum has been excavated. The town was founded in c.30 BC and rapidly became a centre of Roman civilization. Towns belonging to the Nervian territory were Fanum Martis ([[Famars]]), and Geminiacum ([[Liberchies]]).\n\nThe Nervians were well known for the export of grain; an interesting tombstone of a ''[[frumentarius]]'' was excavated as far away as [[Nijmegen]]. They also produced ceramics (''terra nigra'').\n\nInscriptions found on  artifacts recovered at [[Rough Castle Fort]] along the [[Antonine Wall]] across the [[Central Belt]] of [[Scotland]] indicate that in the 2nd century the fort was the base for 500 men of the Sixth Cohort of Nervii, an infantry unit. According to Tacitus, the Nervians also served in [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]]s based along the Rhine border. Altars found at the Roman fort of [[Whitley Castle]] in Northumberland, also known as Epiacum, bear inscriptions showing that the Second Nervians were garrisoned at the fort.\n\nAfter the disastrous attacks by the [[Franks]] in 260-275 AD, a new chief city was designated at Camaracum ([[Cambrai]]), further south than Bavay, and Bavay itself, and the main road it was on, became part of a new secondary fortified border zone. The northern part of Nervian territory, which included the so-called ''[[Silva Carbonaria]]'' (Coal forest), became lightly populated, and eventually settled by Germanic groups, leaving the southern part, medieval Hainaut, more Romanized. By 432 it seems the country of the Romanized Nervians south and west of the forest and had been taken over by the Franks. Their king [[Childeric I]] was buried in Tournai. The medieval [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cambrai]] continued to cover the same approximate area as the Roman ''civitas'' until 1559.\n\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe Nervii and their western neighbours the Menapii are the main subjects of the comic book ''[[Asterix in Belgium]]''. In it, a competition between the Belgians and the Gauls from [[Armorica]] takes place to decide who was the bravest, under the unlikely adjudication of Julius Caesar.\n\nThe Nervii are featured in the video game ''[[Total War: Rome II]]''.\n\n==Museums==\n* Mus\u00e9e Arch\u00e9ologique de Bavay (France)\n* [http://www.musee-mariemont.be Mus\u00e9e Royal de Mariemont], Morlanwelz (Belgium)\n* Provinciaal Archeocentrum Velzeke (Belgium) [http://www.pam-ov.be/velzeke www.pam-ov.be/velzeke]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.livius.org/a/battlefields/sabis/selle.html Battle of the Sabis]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080917231936/http://home.nordnet.fr/~floridant/bavay.htm Bavay: cit\u00e9 gallo-romaine]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[List of Celtic tribes]]\n{{Peoples of Gaul}}\n[[Category:Tribes of pre-Roman Gaul]]\n[[Category:Tribes involved in the Gallic Wars]]\n[[Category:Belgae]]\n[[Category:Early Germanic peoples]]\n[[Category:Gauls]]\n[[Category:Auxiliary infantry units of ancient Rome]]\n[[Category:Nervii]]\n", "text_old": "<!--this article has used the BC/AD convention since 5 July 2003-->\n[[Image:Gaul, 1st century BC.gif|thumb|300px|A map of [[Gaul]] in the 1st century BC, showing the relative position of the Nervii tribe.]]\n\nThe '''Nervii''' were one of the most powerful [[Belgae|Belgic]] tribes of northern [[Gaul]] at the time of its conquest by Rome.

He says that their culture was a Spartan one: they would not partake of alcoholic beverages or any other such luxury, feeling that the mind must remain clear to be brave. He also says they disliked foreign trade and had no merchant class / would not permit merchants within their territory.\n\nArchaeologists have sought to define the territories of the northern Belgic tribes by looking at the coins they used. The Nervii are associated with a [[stater]] type that uses a Greek [[epsilon]].<ref name=wightman20>{{Citation|title=Gallia Belgica|last=Wightman|first =Edith Mary|year=1985|publisher= University of California Press| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aEyS54uSj88C}} page 20.</ref>\n\nRemarkably, given the archaeological evidence of a Celtic [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] having been present in the pre-Roman past, Caesar reports that the Nervii had no cavalry.

After the alliance broke up and some tribes surrendered, the Nervii, under the command of [[Boduognatus]] and aided by the [[Atrebates]] and [[Viromandui]], came very close to defeating Caesar (the [[Atuatuci]] had also agreed to join them but did not arrive in time). In 57 BC at the [[battle of the Sabis]]  (now identified as the river [[Selle]], near modern [[Saulzoir]]; previously identified as the [[Sambre]]),<ref>Pierre Turquin (\"La Bataille de la Selle (du Sabis) en l' An 57 avant J.-C.\", ''Les \u00c9tudes Classiques'' 23.2 (1955), 113-156)</ref> they concealed themselves in the forests and attacked the approaching Roman column at the river. Their attack was so quick and unexpected that some of the Romans didn't have time to take the covers off their shields or even put on their helmets. The element of surprise briefly left the Romans exposed. However Caesar grabbed a shield, made his way to the front line, and quickly organised his forces; at the same time, the commander of the [[Legio X Gemina|tenth legion]], [[Labienus|Titus Labienus]], attacked the Nervian camp. The two legions who had been guarding the baggage train at the rear arrived and helped to turn the tide of the battle. Caesar says the Nervii were almost annihilated in the battle and is effusive in his tribute to their bravery, calling them \"heroes\".<ref>Julius Caesar, ''Commentarii de Bello Gallico'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2|2]]</ref>\n\nWhen [[Ambiorix]] and the [[Eburones]] rebelled in 53 BC, the remaining Nervii joined the uprising and besieged [[Quintus Tullius Cicero]] \u2013 brother of the orator \u2013 and his legion in their winter camp until they were relieved by Caesar in person.<ref>Julius Caesar, ''Commentarii de Bello Gallico'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 5#38|5.38-52]]</ref>\n\n==Roman period==\n[[File:Old cambrai diocese.png|thumb|right|The medieval diocese of [[Cambrai ]] was based upon the Roman civitas of the Nervii.]]\nThe Nervian [[civitas]] was at [[Bagacum]]. The city was founded to the south of the traditional Nervian territory and is now known as [[Bavay]], a town in France near the Belgian border. The forum has been excavated. The town was founded in c.30 BC and rapidly became a centre of Roman civilization. Towns belonging to the Nervian territory were Fanum Martis ([[Famars]]), and Geminiacum ([[Liberchies]]).\n\nThe Nervians were well known for the export of grain; an interesting tombstone of a ''[[frumentarius]]'' was excavated as far away as [[Nijmegen]]. They also produced ceramics (''terra nigra'').\n\nInscriptions found on  artifacts recovered at [[Rough Castle Fort]] along the [[Antonine Wall]] across the [[Central Belt]] of [[Scotland]] indicate that in the 2nd century the fort was the base for 500 men of the Sixth Cohort of Nervii, an infantry unit. According to Tacitus, the Nervians also served in [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]]s based along the Rhine border. Altars found at the Roman fort of [[Whitley Castle]] in Northumberland, also known as Epiacum, bear inscriptions showing that the Second Nervians were garrisoned at the fort.\n\nAfter the disastrous attacks by the [[Franks]] in 260-275 AD, a new chief city was designated at Camaracum ([[Cambrai]]), further south than Bavay, and Bavay itself, and the main road it was on, became part of a new secondary fortified border zone. The northern part of Nervian territory, which included the so-called ''[[Silva Carbonaria]]'' (Coal forest), became lightly populated, and eventually settled by Germanic groups, leaving the southern part, medieval Hainaut, more Romanized. By 432 it seems the country of the Romanized Nervians south and west of the forest and had been taken over by the Franks. Their king [[Childeric I]] was buried in Tournai. The medieval [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cambrai]] continued to cover the same approximate area as the Roman ''civitas'' until 1559.\n\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe Nervii and their western neighbours the Menapii are the main subjects of the comic book ''[[Asterix in Belgium]]''. In it, a competition between the Belgians and the Gauls from [[Armorica]] takes place to decide who was the bravest, under the unlikely adjudication of Julius Caesar.\n\nThe Nervii are featured in the video game ''[[Total War: Rome II]]''.\n\n==Museums==\n* Mus\u00e9e Arch\u00e9ologique de Bavay (France)\n* [http://www.musee-mariemont.be Mus\u00e9e Royal de Mariemont], Morlanwelz (Belgium)\n* Provinciaal Archeocentrum Velzeke (Belgium) [http://www.pam-ov.be/velzeke www.pam-ov.be/velzeke]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.livius.org/a/battlefields/sabis/selle.html Battle of the Sabis]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080917231936/http://home.nordnet.fr/~floridant/bavay.htm Bavay: cit\u00e9 gallo-romaine]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[List of Celtic tribes]]\n{{Peoples of Gaul}}\n[[Category:Tribes of pre-Roman Gaul]]\n[[Category:Tribes involved in the Gallic Wars]]\n[[Category:Belgae]]\n[[Category:Early Germanic peoples]]\n[[Category:Gauls]]\n[[Category:Auxiliary infantry units of ancient Rome]]\n[[Category:Nervii]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLanguage:Journal cites:, templated 1 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervii"}

The Act gives the [[Food and Drug Administration]] the power to regulate the [[tobacco industry]]. A signature element of the law imposes new warnings and labels on tobacco packaging and their advertisements, with the goal of discouraging minors and young adults from smoking. The Act also bans flavored cigarettes, places limits on the advertising of tobacco products to minors and requires tobacco companies to seek FDA approval for new tobacco products.\n\n==Origins and proposal==\nOn March 21, 2000, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.]]'', in a 5-4 decision, held that the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], particularly when considering \"Congress\u2019 subsequent tobacco-specific legislation,\" that Congress had not given the FDA the authority to [[Regulation of tobacco by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration|regulate tobacco products]] as customarily marketed.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/98-1152.ZS.html FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120 (2000)].</ref>  Thus the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was introduced to respond to the decision, which had held that the Clinton administration's FDA had \"overreached\" its Congressionally delegated authority, thus giving the FDA the authority the Court determined it had lacked.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rushing |first1=J.

The TBT Agreement is of special importance as it defines clove cigarettes and menthol cigarettes as \"like products.\" Claims of discrimination are enhanced when noting that 99% of kreteks were imported from countries other than the United States (chiefly Indonesia), while menthol cigarettes are produced almost entirely by American tobacco manufacturers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/07/21/wto-agrees-set-panel-rule-us-clove-cigarette-ban.html|title=WTO agrees to set up panel to rule on US clove cigarette ban|date=21 July 2010|publisher=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref> Indonesia's case is further strengthened by comparing the number of young kretek smokers in America with the number of young menthol cigarette smokers.

Young smokers habituated to kreteks, however, account for less than 1% of cigarette consumption in the US, and <1% of the total cigarettes sold in the US.

The matters was moved to arbitration in line with Article 22.6 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding, the WTO agreement governing trade disputes. In June of 2013 the two parties jointly asked the arbitrators to suspend circulation of this decision to the public and asked to keep the award confidential. Diplomatic meetings followed and in exchange for ending the controversy created by the ban of clove cigarettes the US agreed to refrain from submitting any WTO challenges to Indonesia\u2019s controversial mineral export restrictions.

The TBT Agreement is of special importance as it defines clove cigarettes and menthol cigarettes as \"like products.\" Claims of discrimination are enhanced when noting that 99% of kreteks were imported from countries other than the United States (chiefly Indonesia), while menthol cigarettes are produced almost entirely by American tobacco manufacturers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/07/21/wto-agrees-set-panel-rule-us-clove-cigarette-ban.html|title=WTO agrees to set up panel to rule on US clove cigarette ban|date=21 July 2010|publisher=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref> Indonesia's case is further strengthened by comparing the number of young kretek smokers in America with the number of young menthol cigarette smokers.
