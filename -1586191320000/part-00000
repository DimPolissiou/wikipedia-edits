The invasion phase consisted primarily of a conventionally fought war which included the capture of the Iraqi capital of [[Baghdad]] by American forces with the implicit assistance of the United Kingdom alongside Australia and Poland.\n\n160,000 troops were sent by the Coalition into Iraq, during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from 19 March to 9 April 2003. About 130,000 were sent from the USA alone, with about 28,000 British soldiers, Australia (2,000), and Poland (194). [[Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq|36 other countries]] were involved in its aftermath. In preparation for the invasion, 100,000 U.S. troops were assembled in [[Kuwait]] by 18 February.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/18/sprj.irq.deployment/index.html |title=U.S. has 100,000 troops in Kuwait |publisher=CNN |date=18 February 2003 |accessdate=29 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108211421/http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/18/sprj.irq.deployment/index.html |archive-date=8 November 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The coalition forces also received support from [[Peshmerga|Kurdish irregulars]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].\n\nThe invasion was preceded by an [[airstrike]] on the Presidential Palace in Baghdad on 20 March 2003. The following day, coalition forces launched an incursion into [[Basra Governorate|Basra Province]] from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While the special forces launched an amphibious assault from the [[Persian Gulf]] to secure [[Basra]] and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the [[Battle of Nasiriyah]] on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On 26 March, the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team|173rd Airborne Brigade]] was [[Operation Northern Delay|airdropped]] near the northern city of [[Kirkuk]], where they joined forces with [[Kurds|Kurdish]] rebels and fought several actions against the [[Iraqi Army]] to secure the northern part of the country.\n\nThe main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi army, including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack and capture of [[Tikrit]] on 15 April. [[President of Iraq|Iraqi president]] Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On 1 May, an end of major combat operations was declared, ending the invasion period and beginning the [[military occupation]] period.\n\n=== Anti-Coalition insurgency ===\n{{Main|Iraqi insurgency (2003\u201311)|Iraqi insurgency (2003\u201306)}}\nInvading U.S.-led forces were unable to immediately fill the power vacuum caused by the sudden collapse of a highly centralized state authority, resulting in weeks of virtual anarchy. The rampant looting during this time period, and the inability of U.S.-led forces to control the situation, led to Iraqi resentment. Additionally, the unexpectedly quick implosion of Saddam Hussein's regime meant that the invading forces never engaged and decisively defeated his army in any major battle; the Iraqi army forces simply melted away, often with their weapons, back to their homes. Another cause of resentment was the lack of immediate humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts for Iraqis suffering from the invasion, the long-term effects of the repression and mismanagement of the Saddam Hussein regime, and international sanctions.<ref name=\"Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006\">Abdullah, T.A.J., 2006, ''Dictatorship, Imperialism & Chaos: Iraq since 1989'', London, Zed Books</ref> A number of factions felt suspicious of long-term American intentions; the conduct of some American soldiers also served to heighten tensions.<ref name=\"Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006\"/> The de-Ba'athification Commission set up by the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]], the nature of selection of the Governing Council, and other policy decisions were interpreted by Sunni Arabs as actions intended to single out their community for discrimination; this encouraged the beginnings of sectarian tensions.<ref name=\"Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006\"/>\n\nIn May 2003, after the Iraqi conventional forces had been defeated and disbanded, the U.S. military noticed a gradually increasing flurry of attacks on U.S. troops in various regions of the so-called \"[[Sunni Triangle]]\", especially in [[Baghdad]] and in the regions around [[Fallujah]] and [[Tikrit]]. The U.S. military blamed the attacks on remnants of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]] and the [[Fedayeen Saddam]] militia. Tensions between U.S. forces and the residents of Fallujah were especially severe, with crowd riots and small skirmishes commonplace.\n\nMembers of insurgent groups came from a variety of sources. Former members of the security services of the Ba'ath regime, former military officers, and some other Ba'ath Party members are cited as members of insurgent groups; indeed, these elements formed the primary backbone of the nascent insurgency.<ref>Hashim, A.S., 2003, The Insurgency in Iraq, ''Small Wars and Insurgencies'', Volume 14(3), pp 1-22</ref> Initially, most former members of the Ba'ath Party and former Iraqi soldiers expressed a willingness to compromise with the Coalition forces. However, many lost their jobs and pensions with the [[Coalition Provisional Authority Order 2|disbanding of the Iraqi army]] by [[Paul Bremer]]; this, and the unwillingness of the Coalition Provisional Authority to negotiate with former Ba'ath elements, provided impetus for the initial insurgency. While 80% of the army officers were Sunni, the rank and file of the regular army was 80% Shia.<ref>Gaub, 2011, \"Rebuilding Armed Forces: Learning From Iraq And Lebanon\", ''Strategic Studies Institute'', pp 3</ref> Prisoners let out of prison by [[Saddam Hussein]] before his disappearance provided another source both of insurgent recruits and of organized crime factions.<ref name=\"Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006\"/> Finally, as O'Hanlan says, the porous borders of Iraq and the subsequent foreign insurgents also bolstered the insurgency.<ref>O'Hanlan, M.E., 2005, Iraq Without A Plan, ''Policy Review'', Issue 128, pp 33-45</ref>\n\nResistance to U.S.-led forces would not for long be confined to the Sunni regions of Iraq. Between 2003 and 2004, Shiite dissatisfaction with the occupation, especially among the urban poor, had been gradually increasing for some of the same reasons it had been among the Sunnis: the perception that the Coalition had failed to deliver on its promises and a nationalist dissatisfaction with foreign occupation. Many young men without jobs or prospects and who had lost faith with the promises of the U.S. began to become drawn to Shiite religious radicalism, especially of the brand advocated by the cleric [[Muqtada al-Sadr]]. Sadr's distinguished family background, and his fiery anti-occupation rhetoric and calls for the implementation of [[Sharia|Islamic law]], caused him to emerge as the leader of this portion of Iraqi Shiite society. In June 2003, after being rejected from a spot on the Iraqi Governing Council, he had created a militia known as the [[Peace Companies|Mahdi Army]], whose mission he said was to help keep order and cleanse Iraq of \"evil.\" Since that point, the U.S. had regarded him as a threat, but was divided on whether or not to proceed with a crackdown. Eventually, as Sadr's rhetoric heated and his militia paraded through Sadr City in what seemed like a challenge to the United States, they decided to begin to squeeze his movement. On March 29, they moved to close Sadr's newspaper<ref>{{cite web|title=Who is Moqtada Sadr?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57949-2004Apr7.html|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=28 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429024541/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57949-2004Apr7.html|archive-date=29 April 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> known as \"al-Hawza\" and arrested one of his aides on murder charges. That, combined with his steadily decreasing political prospects for success within the U.S.-backed interim government, pushed Sadr to decide for armed revolt.\n\nOn April 4, the Mahdi Army was directed to begin launching attacks on coalition targets and to seize control from the nascent U.S.-trained Iraqi security forces. The Mahdi Army, which by then numbered from 3,000 to 10,000 men, organized quickly escalating violent riots and then a coordinated assault, surprising coalition and Iraqi forces and seizing control of [[Najaf]], [[Kufa]], [[Kut|al-Kut]], and parts of Baghdad and southern cities like [[Nasiriyah]], [[Amarah]], and [[Basra]]. A widespread collapse of the Iraqi security forces ensued, with most deserting or defecting to the rebels rather than fighting. Soon, combat was erupting in many urban centers of southern and central portions of Iraq as U.S. forces attempted to maintain control and prepared for a counteroffensive.\n\t\t\nAt the same time, the Sunni insurgency was rapidly intensifying. On March 31, 2004, four [[private military company|private military contractor]]s working for the U.S. military were killed and subsequently mutilated by insurgents and a crowd of residents in the city of Fallujah, long a particularly troublesome center of Sunni resistance to the U.S. presence. On the same day, 5 U.S. soldiers were killed by a large IED on a road a few miles outside of the city. The attacks took place as the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] were taking over responsibility for [[Al Anbar Governorate|al-Anbar province]], in which Fallujah is located, from the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. The intended [[US Marine Corps|Marine]] strategy of [[patrolling|patrols]], less aggressive raids, [[humanitarian aid]], and close cooperation with local leaders was quickly suspended and the U.S. decided that it was time for a major assault to clear the city of insurgents. On April 4, U.S. and Iraqi forces launched [[First Battle of Fallujah|Operation Vigilant Resolve]] to retake the city, which had clearly fallen completely into rebel hands. They met very stiff and well-organized resistance from the guerrillas. After three days of fighting with the U.S. Marines, the insurgents still held three-quarters of the city. Cases of widespread reach and planning, suggesting national insurgent coordination, were noted. Hundreds of insurgents cut the road between Fallujah and Baghdad to the east, while west of Fallujah in [[Ramadi]], over 150 insurgents launched an offensive against U.S. Marine positions. A similar attack followed, conducted by about 150 insurgents, against U.S. Marines near the Syrian border in [[Al-Qa'im (town)|al-Qaim]]. The assaults were beaten back, but the U.S. toll from the combined attacks numbered in the dozens. Political pressure began to build on the United States and the Governing Council of Iraq as the hospital of Fallujah continued to report high numbers of civilian casualties, inflaming further the Iraqi people and Muslim world in general. After two weeks of fighting, the U.S. Marines were on the verge of capturing, but had not yet taken central control of, the city of Fallujah. Pentagon leaders, fearing that continuing the effort to capture the city might further inflame a larger revolt against Coalition authority, pulled back the forces. The Marines were ordered to stand-down and cordon off the city on April 30, where they would remain in a perimeter around the city for the following six months. A compromise on April 30 was reached in order to ensure security within Fallujah itself by creating the \"Fallujah Brigade\", a unit that drew from former members of Iraq's Army, local volunteers, and even the insurgents themselves. The unit's formation was part of a truce negotiation. This unit was to act under the control of the Coalition Provisional Authority, patrol alongside the Iraqi Police and National Guardsmen but maintain its autonomy.

Reportedly, [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]]'s organization was among the several that exercised some authority in the area.\n\nBy the end of the spring uprising, the cities of Fallujah, [[Samarra]], [[Baqubah|Baquba]], and Ramadi had been left under Sunni guerrilla control with American patrols in the cities ceased. The insurgency had undergone another major shift, as insurgent organizations now had safe havens in cities such as Fallujah to develop and coordinate with each other. Zarqawi's group and its allies were in a period of uneasy cooperation with other insurgent groups dominated by nationalist and Ba'athist agendas, although the groups increasingly came into competition for territory within Sunni insurgent-controlled areas. U.S. forces launched only occasional armored forays into Samarra and Baquba, while about half a dozen small forts were maintained by the U.S. Marines in Ramadi, with the surrounding territory in the city controlled by rebels. American ground forces remained outside of Fallujah, though regular air strikes were conducted on alleged safehouses of [[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad|Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's followers]] in the city. With the battle for Fallujah over, the Sunni insurgency continued against the U.S. forces remaining outside these cities as the guerrillas resumed their tactics of using IED's and mortars to attack U.S. forces indirectly, for the most part avoiding direct combat.\n\nMeanwhile, the fighting continued in the Shiite south. Over the next three months, over 1,500 Mahdi Army militiamen, several hundred civilians, and dozens of coalition soldiers were killed as the U.S. gradually took back the southern cities. On June 6, a truce was reached, temporarily ending the fighting.\n\nOn June 28, 2004, the occupation was formally ended by the Coalition, which transferred power to a new [[Politics of Iraq|Iraqi government]] led by [[Prime Minister of Iraq|Prime Minister]] [[Ayad Allawi]]. Although many Iraqis were optimistic about the government, militants saw it as little more than an American puppet and continued the fight unabated. On July 18, guerrillas offered a $285,000 reward for Allawi's assassination.\n\n=== Sectarian violence ===\n{{Main|Sectarian violence in Iraq (2006\u20132008)}}\nIn February 2006, the [[Salafi jihadism|Salafi jihadist]] organization [[Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn]] (also known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq) [[2006 al-Askari mosque bombing|bombed]] one of the holiest sites in Shi'a Islam - the [[Al-Askari Shrine|al-Askari Mosque]] in [[Samarra]].

The invasion phase consisted primarily of a conventionally fought war which included the capture of the Iraqi capital of [[Baghdad]] by American forces with the implicit assistance of the United Kingdom alongside Australia and Poland.\n\n160,000 troops were sent by the Coalition into Iraq, during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from 19 March to 9 April 2003. About 130,000 were sent from the USA alone, with about 28,000 British soldiers, Australia (2,000), and Poland (194). [[Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq|36 other countries]] were involved in its aftermath.

The following day, coalition forces launched an incursion into [[Basra Governorate|Basra Province]] from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While the special forces launched an amphibious assault from the [[Persian Gulf]] to secure [[Basra]] and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the [[Battle of Nasiriyah]] on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On 26 March, the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team|173rd Airborne Brigade]] was [[Operation Northern Delay|airdropped]] near the northern city of [[Kirkuk]], where they joined forces with [[Kurds|Kurdish]] rebels and fought several actions against the [[Iraqi Army]] to secure the northern part of the country.\n\nThe main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi army, including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack and capture of [[Tikrit]] on 15 April. [[President of Iraq|Iraqi president]] Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On 1 May, an end of major combat operations was declared, ending the invasion period and beginning the [[military occupation]] period.\n\n=== Anti-Coalition insurgency ===\n{{Main|Iraqi insurgency (2003\u201311)|Iraqi insurgency (2003\u201306)}}\nInvading U.S.-led forces were unable to immediately fill the power vacuum caused by the sudden collapse of a highly centralized state authority, resulting in weeks of virtual anarchy. The rampant looting during this time period, and the inability of U.S.-led forces to control the situation, led to Iraqi resentment. Additionally, the unexpectedly quick implosion of Saddam Hussein's regime meant that the invading forces never engaged and decisively defeated his army in any major battle; the Iraqi army forces simply melted away, often with their weapons, back to their homes. Another cause of resentment was the lack of immediate humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts for Iraqis suffering from the invasion, the long-term effects of the repression and mismanagement of the Saddam Hussein regime, and international sanctions.<ref name=\"Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006\">Abdullah, T.A.J., 2006, ''Dictatorship, Imperialism & Chaos: Iraq since 1989'', London, Zed Books</ref> A number of factions felt suspicious of long-term American intentions; the conduct of some American soldiers also served to heighten tensions.<ref name=\"Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006\"/> The de-Ba'athification Commission set up by the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]], the nature of selection of the Governing Council, and other policy decisions were interpreted by Sunni Arabs as actions intended to single out their community for discrimination; this encouraged the beginnings of sectarian tensions.<ref name=\"Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006\"/>\n\nIn May 2003, after the Iraqi conventional forces had been defeated and disbanded, the U.S. military noticed a gradually increasing flurry of attacks on U.S. troops in various regions of the so-called \"[[Sunni Triangle]]\", especially in [[Baghdad]] and in the regions around [[Fallujah]] and [[Tikrit]]. The U.S. military blamed the attacks on remnants of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]] and the [[Fedayeen Saddam]] militia. Tensions between U.S. forces and the residents of Fallujah were especially severe, with crowd riots and small skirmishes commonplace.\n\nMembers of insurgent groups came from a variety of sources. Former members of the security services of the Ba'ath regime, former military officers, and some other Ba'ath Party members are cited as members of insurgent groups; indeed, these elements formed the primary backbone of the nascent insurgency.<ref>Hashim, A.S., 2003, The Insurgency in Iraq, ''Small Wars and Insurgencies'', Volume 14(3), pp 1-22</ref> Initially, most former members of the Ba'ath Party and former Iraqi soldiers expressed a willingness to compromise with the Coalition forces. However, many lost their jobs and pensions with the [[Coalition Provisional Authority Order 2|disbanding of the Iraqi army]] by [[Paul Bremer]]; this, and the unwillingness of the Coalition Provisional Authority to negotiate with former Ba'ath elements, provided impetus for the initial insurgency. While 80% of the army officers were Sunni, the rank and file of the regular army was 80% Shia.<ref>Gaub, 2011, \"Rebuilding Armed Forces: Learning From Iraq And Lebanon\", ''Strategic Studies Institute'', pp 3</ref> Prisoners let out of prison by [[Saddam Hussein]] before his disappearance provided another source both of insurgent recruits and of organized crime factions.<ref name=\"Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006\"/> Finally, as O'Hanlan says, the porous borders of Iraq and the subsequent foreign insurgents also bolstered the insurgency.<ref>O'Hanlan, M.E., 2005, Iraq Without A Plan, ''Policy Review'', Issue 128, pp 33-45</ref>\n\nResistance to U.S.-led forces would not for long be confined to the Sunni regions of Iraq. Between 2003 and 2004, Shiite dissatisfaction with the occupation, especially among the urban poor, had been gradually increasing for some of the same reasons it had been among the Sunnis: the perception that the Coalition had failed to deliver on its promises and a nationalist dissatisfaction with foreign occupation. Many young men without jobs or prospects and who had lost faith with the promises of the U.S. began to become drawn to Shiite religious radicalism, especially of the brand advocated by the cleric [[Muqtada al-Sadr]]. Sadr's distinguished family background, and his fiery anti-occupation rhetoric and calls for the implementation of [[Sharia|Islamic law]], caused him to emerge as the leader of this portion of Iraqi Shiite society. In June 2003, after being rejected from a spot on the Iraqi Governing Council, he had created a militia known as the [[Peace Companies|Mahdi Army]], whose mission he said was to help keep order and cleanse Iraq of \"evil.\" Since that point, the U.S. had regarded him as a threat, but was divided on whether or not to proceed with a crackdown. Eventually, as Sadr's rhetoric heated and his militia paraded through Sadr City in what seemed like a challenge to the United States, they decided to begin to squeeze his movement. On March 29, they moved to close Sadr's newspaper<ref>{{cite web|title=Who is Moqtada Sadr?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57949-2004Apr7.html|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=28 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429024541/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57949-2004Apr7.html|archive-date=29 April 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> known as \"al-Hawza\" and arrested one of his aides on murder charges. That, combined with his steadily decreasing political prospects for success within the U.S.-backed interim government, pushed Sadr to decide for armed revolt.\n\nOn April 4, the Mahdi Army was directed to begin launching attacks on coalition targets and to seize control from the nascent U.S.-trained Iraqi security forces. The Mahdi Army, which by then numbered from 3,000 to 10,000 men, organized quickly escalating violent riots and then a coordinated assault, surprising coalition and Iraqi forces and seizing control of [[Najaf]], [[Kufa]], [[Kut|al-Kut]], and parts of Baghdad and southern cities like [[Nasiriyah]], [[Amarah]], and [[Basra]]. A widespread collapse of the Iraqi security forces ensued, with most deserting or defecting to the rebels rather than fighting. Soon, combat was erupting in many urban centers of southern and central portions of Iraq as U.S. forces attempted to maintain control and prepared for a counteroffensive.\n\t\t\nAt the same time, the Sunni insurgency was rapidly intensifying. On March 31, 2004, four [[private military company|private military contractor]]s working for the U.S. military were killed and subsequently mutilated by insurgents and a crowd of residents in the city of Fallujah, long a particularly troublesome center of Sunni resistance to the U.S. presence. On the same day, 5 U.S. soldiers were killed by a large IED on a road a few miles outside of the city. The attacks took place as the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] were taking over responsibility for [[Al Anbar Governorate|al-Anbar province]], in which Fallujah is located, from the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. The intended [[US Marine Corps|Marine]] strategy of [[patrolling|patrols]], less aggressive raids, [[humanitarian aid]], and close cooperation with local leaders was quickly suspended and the U.S. decided that it was time for a major assault to clear the city of insurgents. On April 4, U.S. and Iraqi forces launched [[First Battle of Fallujah|Operation Vigilant Resolve]] to retake the city, which had clearly fallen completely into rebel hands. They met very stiff and well-organized resistance from the guerrillas. After three days of fighting with the U.S. Marines, the insurgents still held three-quarters of the city. Cases of widespread reach and planning, suggesting national insurgent coordination, were noted. Hundreds of insurgents cut the road between Fallujah and Baghdad to the east, while west of Fallujah in [[Ramadi]], over 150 insurgents launched an offensive against U.S. Marine positions. A similar attack followed, conducted by about 150 insurgents, against U.S. Marines near the Syrian border in [[Al-Qa'im (town)|al-Qaim]]. The assaults were beaten back, but the U.S. toll from the combined attacks numbered in the dozens. Political pressure began to build on the United States and the Governing Council of Iraq as the hospital of Fallujah continued to report high numbers of civilian casualties, inflaming further the Iraqi people and Muslim world in general. After two weeks of fighting, the U.S. Marines were on the verge of capturing, but had not yet taken central control of, the city of Fallujah. Pentagon leaders, fearing that continuing the effort to capture the city might further inflame a larger revolt against Coalition authority, pulled back the forces. The Marines were ordered to stand-down and cordon off the city on April 30, where they would remain in a perimeter around the city for the following six months. A compromise on April 30 was reached in order to ensure security within Fallujah itself by creating the \"Fallujah Brigade\", a unit that drew from former members of Iraq's Army, local volunteers, and even the insurgents themselves. The unit's formation was part of a truce negotiation. This unit was to act under the control of the Coalition Provisional Authority, patrol alongside the Iraqi Police and National Guardsmen but maintain its autonomy. The Fallujah Brigade had many former Saddam loyalists. From various reports, Brigade members re-integrated themselves into the insurgent outfits that dominated.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://newstandardnews.net/content/?action=show_item&itemid=977 |title=Fallujah Brigade to Disband, Join Resistance in Control of City |access-date=2017-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213203531/http://newstandardnews.net/content/?action=show_item&itemid=977 |archive-date=2004-12-13 |url-status=live}}</ref> The city remained under the control of insurgent forces. Reportedly, [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]]'s organization was among the several that exercised some authority in the area.\n\nBy the end of the spring uprising, the cities of Fallujah, [[Samarra]], [[Baqubah|Baquba]], and Ramadi had been left under Sunni guerrilla control with American patrols in the cities ceased. The insurgency had undergone another major shift, as insurgent organizations now had safe havens in cities such as Fallujah to develop and coordinate with each other. Zarqawi's group and its allies were in a period of uneasy cooperation with other insurgent groups dominated by nationalist and Ba'athist agendas, although the groups increasingly came into competition for territory within Sunni insurgent-controlled areas. U.S. forces launched only occasional armored forays into Samarra and Baquba, while about half a dozen small forts were maintained by the U.S. Marines in Ramadi, with the surrounding territory in the city controlled by rebels. American ground forces remained outside of Fallujah, though regular air strikes were conducted on alleged safehouses of [[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad|Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's followers]] in the city. With the battle for Fallujah over, the Sunni insurgency continued against the U.S. forces remaining outside these cities as the guerrillas resumed their tactics of using IED's and mortars to attack U.S. forces indirectly, for the most part avoiding direct combat.\n\nMeanwhile, the fighting continued in the Shiite south. Over the next three months, over 1,500 Mahdi Army militiamen, several hundred civilians, and dozens of coalition soldiers were killed as the U.S. gradually took back the southern cities. On June 6, a truce was reached, temporarily ending the fighting.\n\nOn June 28, 2004, the occupation was formally ended by the Coalition, which transferred power to a new [[Politics of Iraq|Iraqi government]] led by [[Prime Minister of Iraq|Prime Minister]] [[Ayad Allawi]].

Upon the death of [[Friedrich G\u00fcnther, Prince of Schwarzburg|Prince Friedrich G\u00fcnther]] in 1971, a claim to the headship of the house passed under [[Salic law|Semi-Salic]] [[primogeniture]] to his elder sister, [[Marie Antoinette, Princess of Schwarzburg|Princess Marie Antoinette of Schwarzburg]] who married Friedrich Magnus V, Count of [[Solms-Wildenfels]].<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/HGSchwarzburg.htm#Extinction The House of Schwarzburg] on Heraldica.org</ref><ref>James, John ''Almanach de Gotha, Volume I'', 2013.</ref> Reigning over the [[County of Schwarzburg]] and founded by [[Sizzo I of Schwarzburg]] (died 1160), the family split in the 16th century into the lines of [[Schwarzburg-Sondershausen]] and [[Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt]], with the Sondershausen dying out in 1909.\n\n==Family history==\nThe County of Schwarzburg was a state of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 1195 to 1595, when it was partitioned into [[Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt]] and [[Schwarzburg-Sondershausen]]. It was ruled by counts from the House of Schwarzburg. [[Schwarzburg (municipality)|Schwarzburg]] Castle was first mentioned in a 1071 deed. In 1123 Count Sizzo III of K\u00e4fernburg (Kevernburg), mentioned by the medieval chronicler [[Lambert of Hersfeld]] and according to the [[Annalista Saxo]] a grandson of Prince [[Yaropolk Izyaslavich]] of Turov by his mother, rebuilt the castle calling himself a \"Count of Schwarzburg\". Sizzo also established [[Georgenthal]] Abbey and in 1157, he accompanied Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]] during his campaign against High Duke [[Boles\u0142aw IV the Curly]] of Poland.\n\nIn 1197, Sizzo's grandson [[Henry II, Count of Schwarzburg|Henry II]] divided the common heritage with his brother G\u00fcnther III and made Schwarzburg Castle his residence. His territory then also comprised the nearby castle of [[Bad Blankenburg|Blankenburg]].\n\nThe most famous family member is [[G\u00fcnther von Schwarzburg|G\u00fcnther XXI von Schwarzburg]]. In 1349, he was elected as German king by the majority of electors. But, due to waning support, he renounced some months later and died shortly after.\n\nThe Schwarzburg lands were again divided among his successors until in 1538 when Count [[G\u00fcnther XL, Count of Schwarzburg|G\u00fcnther XL the Rich]] was able to unite the territories including [[Bad Frankenhausen|Frankenhausen]] and [[Rudolstadt]] under his rule. He was succeeded by his eldest son [[G\u00fcnther XLI, Count of Schwarzburg-Arnstadt|G\u00fcnther XLI]]. However, after his death in 1583, his younger brothers again divided the county: [[John G\u00fcnther I, Count of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen|John G\u00fcnther I]] received the territory around [[Arnstadt]], later called [[Schwarzburg-Sondershausen]], while [[Albrecht VII, Count of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt|Albrecht VII]] inherited the lands of [[Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt]]. The partition was finally confirmed by the 1599 Treaty of [[Stadtilm]].\n\n==Counts of Schwarzburg and K\u00e4fernburg==\n\n===House of Schwarzburg===\n\n====Partitions of Schwarzburg under

There's a different numbering for Schwarzburg, K\u00e4fernburg (from G\u00fcnther IIII onwards) and Hallermund (as an already existing county which came into the family by marriage)).</small>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=#cccccc\n! colspan=2 | Ruler!!Born!!Reign!!Death!!Ruling part!!Consort!!Notes\n|-bgcolor=#fff\n| [[Sizzo I, Count of Schwarzburg|Sizzo I]] || ||?||c.1030-1050||c.1050||County of Schwarzburg||''Unknown''<br/>at least one child || Probably the founder of the family.

Upon the death of [[Friedrich G\u00fcnther, Prince of Schwarzburg|Prince Friedrich G\u00fcnther]] in 1971, a claim to the headship of the house passed under [[Salic law|Semi-Salic]] [[primogeniture]] to his elder sister, [[Marie Antoinette, Princess of Schwarzburg|Princess Marie Antoinette of Schwarzburg]] who married Friedrich Magnus V, Count of [[Solms-Wildenfels]].<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/HGSchwarzburg.htm#Extinction The House of Schwarzburg] on Heraldica.org</ref><ref>James, John ''Almanach de Gotha, Volume I'', 2013.</ref> Reigning over the [[County of Schwarzburg]] and founded by [[Sizzo I of Schwarzburg]] (died 1160), the family split in the 16th century into the lines of [[Schwarzburg-Sondershausen]] and [[Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt]], with the Sondershausen dying out in 1909.\n\n==Family history==\nThe County of Schwarzburg was a state of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 1195 to 1595, when it was partitioned into [[Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt]] and [[Schwarzburg-Sondershausen]]. It was ruled by counts from the House of Schwarzburg. [[Schwarzburg (municipality)|Schwarzburg]] Castle was first mentioned in a 1071 deed. In 1123 Count Sizzo III of K\u00e4fernburg (Kevernburg), mentioned by the medieval chronicler [[Lambert of Hersfeld]] and according to the [[Annalista Saxo]] a grandson of Prince [[Yaropolk Izyaslavich]] of Turov by his mother, rebuilt the castle calling himself a \"Count of Schwarzburg\". Sizzo also established [[Georgenthal]] Abbey and in 1157, he accompanied Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]] during his campaign against High Duke [[Boles\u0142aw IV the Curly]] of Poland.\n\nIn 1197, Sizzo's grandson [[Henry II, Count of Schwarzburg|Henry II]] divided the common heritage with his brother G\u00fcnther III and made Schwarzburg Castle his residence. His territory then also comprised the nearby castle of [[Bad Blankenburg|Blankenburg]].\n\nThe most famous family member is [[G\u00fcnther von Schwarzburg|G\u00fcnther XXI von Schwarzburg]]. In 1349, he was elected as German king by the majority of electors. But, due to waning support, he renounced some months later and died shortly after.\n\nThe Schwarzburg lands were again divided among his successors until in 1538 when Count [[G\u00fcnther XL, Count of Schwarzburg|G\u00fcnther XL the Rich]] was able to unite the territories including [[Bad Frankenhausen|Frankenhausen]] and [[Rudolstadt]] under his rule. He was succeeded by his eldest son [[G\u00fcnther XLI, Count of Schwarzburg-Arnstadt|G\u00fcnther XLI]]. However, after his death in 1583, his younger brothers again divided the county: [[John G\u00fcnther I, Count of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen|John G\u00fcnther I]] received the territory around [[Arnstadt]], later called [[Schwarzburg-Sondershausen]], while [[Albrecht VII, Count of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt|Albrecht VII]] inherited the lands of [[Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt]]. The partition was finally confirmed by the 1599 Treaty of [[Stadtilm]].\n\n==Counts of Schwarzburg and K\u00e4fernburg==\n\n===House of Schwarzburg===\n\n====Partitions of Schwarzburg under
