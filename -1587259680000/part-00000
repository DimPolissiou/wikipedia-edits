The first director for the film, [[John D.

See WP:FILMPLOT for guidelines on film plots. -->\nWhen a new hotel opens on Amity Island, a gigantic [[great white shark]] ambushes and kills two scuba divers photographing the wreckage of the ''Orca'' and then heads into Amity waters. Their camera, which took pictures during the attack, is recovered the next day. The shark then swiftly kills a female water skier. The driver tries to kill the monster using a gas tank and [[flare gun]]. However, this causes the boat to explode, which kills the driver instead and severely burns the right side of the shark's face.\n\nA [[killer whale]] carcass bearing fatal wounds is found beached. Police Chief Martin Brody believes that a shark is responsible for these events. Brody explains his concerns to Mayor Larry Vaughn, who expresses doubts that the town has another shark problem following the events of the [[Jaws (film)|previous movie]]. Brody then finds floating debris from the destroyed speedboat and the boat driver's burnt remains. Brody calls Matt Hooper for assistance, but he is unavailable due to being in Antarctica on a research expedition. Brody prohibits his son Mike from boating out of concern for his safety and instead lands him a job on the beach, much to Mike's dismay.\n\nThe following day, Brody watches from an observation tower and causes a panic after mistaking a school of bluefish for a shark, and shooting at it with his gun. However, his fears are confirmed when photos from the diver's camera are processed, and one of them shows a close-up of the shark. When he presents it to the Amity Town Council, they refuse to believe it is a shark, and vote Brody out as police chief with the sole dissent coming from the Mayor.\n\nThe next morning, Mike disobeys his father's orders by sneaking out to go sailing with his friends, taking his younger brother Sean with him to silence him. Marge, another teen, takes Sean with her, and they head out on six separate boats, going past a team of divers led by instructor Tom Andrews. Moments after submerging and catching lobster, Andrews encounters the shark. Panicking, he rushes to the surface, causing an [[embolism]]. Soon after, the shark hits the boat of teenagers Tina and Eddie, who have strayed away from the others; Eddie falls into the water and is eaten in front of Tina, terrifying her in the process.\n\nBrody and his wife Ellen witness Tom's evacuation by ambulance and hear that the other divers suspect something scared him underwater and observing a bite reflex in Tom's scuba regulator. Former deputy Len Hendricks, who has taken over as Brody's replacement, tells them that Mike went sailing with his friends, so Brody and Ellen commandeer the police boat (aided by a reluctant Hendricks) to rescue them. They come across Tina's boat and find her hiding in the [[bow (ship)|bow]], whereupon she confirms the shark's presence. Brody hails a passing boat to take Hendricks, Ellen, and Tina to shore, where the truth is revealed, while he goes on to find the kids.\n \nMeanwhile, the shark attacks the group, striking one of their boats and causing most of them to capsize or crash into each other in the ensuing chaos. Mike is knocked unconscious, falls in the water, and nearly gets eaten. The only pair whose boat is still seaworthy barely pull him out and leave the others to take him ashore and get help, while Sean and the others remain adrift on the wreckage of tangled boats. A [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] marine helicopter that Brody contacted arrives to tow them to shore, but the shark latches onto the chopper's pontoons, capsizing it and drowning the pilot in the process. It then knocks Sean into the water, and Marge is killed while saving him.\n\nBrody finds Mike, who informs him of the situation and apologizes for not knowing about the shark; Brody accepts his apology while telling him to get to safety, then finds the others at Cable Junction, a small island housing an electrical relay station that supplies power to Amity. The cheering and jumping that greet him attract the shark, which attacks again, causing him to maroon the police boat. He tries to pull them in with a winch but instead hooks an underwater power cable. The shark's next move sends most of the teenagers into the water, and they swim to the edge of Cable Junction, while Jackie Peters, Mike's love interest, and Sean are still on the boats. Using an inflatable raft, Brody taps the power cable with an oar to lure the shark towards him, holding the cable out in front of him. The shark bites the cable, which electrocutes it until it dies. Brody collects Sean and Jackie and they join the others on Cable Junction to await rescue.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Roy Scheider]] as Chief Martin Brody\n* [[Lorraine Gary]] as Ellen Brody\n* [[Murray Hamilton]] as Mayor Larry Vaughn\n* [[Joseph Mascolo]] as Len Peterson\n* [[Jeffrey Kramer]] as Deputy Jeff Hendricks\n* [[Collin Wilcox (actress)|Collin Wilcox]] as Dr. Elkins\n* [[Ann Dusenberry]] as Tina Wilcox\n* [[Mark Gruner]] as Michael \"Mike\" Brody\n* [[Susan French]] as Old Lady\n* [[Barry Coe]] as Tom Andrews\n* Gary Springer as Andy Nicholas\n* [[Donna Wilkes]] as Jackie Peters\n* [[Gary Dubin]] as Eddie Marchand\n* [[John Dukakis]] as Paul 'Polo' Loman\n* G.

He claimed that the planned plot was to involve the sons of Quint and Brody hunting a new shark.<ref name=\"Ref_\">{{harvnb|Baxter|1997|p=145}}</ref> Brown said that Spielberg did not want to direct the sequel because he felt that he had done the \"definitive shark movie\".<ref name=\"makingof\"/><ref name=\"Prigg\u00e98\">{{harvnb|Prigg\u00e9|2004|p=8}}</ref> The director later added that his decision was influenced by the problems the ''Jaws'' production faced \u2013 \"I would have done the sequel if I hadn't had such a horrible time at sea on the first film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/06/08/steven-spielberg-jaws-interview/|title=Steven Spielberg talks about 'Jaws' \u2013 the greatest summer movie ever made|first=Chris|last=Nashawaty|date=2011-06-08|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2012-01-02}}</ref>\n\nDespite Spielberg's rejection, the studio went ahead with plans to make the sequel, leading to an arduous 18-month pre-production process. [[Howard Sackler]], who had contributed to the first film's script but chose not to be credited, was charged with writing the first draft. He originally proposed a [[prequel]] based on the sinking of the [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS ''Indianapolis'']], the story relayed by [[Quint (Jaws character)|Quint]] in the first film. Although Universal president [[Sidney Sheinberg]] thought Sackler's [[Film treatment|treatment]] for the film was intriguing, he rejected the idea.<ref name=\"Ref_a\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=24\u20135}}</ref> On Sackler's recommendation, theatre and film director [[John D. Hancock]] was chosen to helm the picture.<ref name=\"Ref_b\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=27}}</ref> \n\nHancock began filming in June 1977. However, after nearly a month of filming, Universal and MCA executives disliked the dark, subtle tone that the film was taking and wanted a more lighthearted and action oriented story. Additionally, Hancock ran into trouble with Sheinberg, who suggested to Hancock and Tristan that his (Sheinberg's) wife, actress [[Lorraine Gary]] (Ellen Brody), \"should go out on a boat and help to rescue the kids.\" When told of the idea, Zanuck replied, \"Over my dead body.\" The next draft of the film's screenplay was turned in with Gary not going out to sea. Hancock says that this, and his later firing of another actress who turned out to be a Universal executive's girlfriend, contributed to his own dismissal from the film.<ref name=\"luke\">{{harvnb|Ford|2004|p=191}}</ref>\n\nHancock began to feel the pressure of directing his first epic adventure film \"with only three film credits, and all small-scale dramas\".<ref name=\"Ref_c\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=66}}</ref> The producers were unhappy with his material, and on a Saturday evening in June 1977, after a meeting with the producers and Universal executives, the director was fired. He and his wife left for [[Rome]] and production was shut down for a few weeks. The couple had been involved in the film for eighteen months.<ref name=\"Ref_d\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=70}}</ref> Hancock blamed his departure on the mechanical shark, telling a newspaper that it still could not swim or bite after a year and a half: \"You get a couple of shots, and [the shark] breaks.\"<ref name=\"kach78\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=78}}</ref> Echoing the first film's production, [[Carl Gottlieb]] was enlisted to further revise the script, adding humor and reducing some of the violence.<ref name=\"Ref_e\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=36\u20137}}</ref> Gottlieb wrote on location at [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida]].<ref name=\"Gottlieb221\">{{harvnb|Gottlieb|2010|p=221}}</ref> It cost the producers more money to hire Gottlieb to do the rewrite than it would have if they had hired him in the first place.<ref name=\"Ref_e\"/>\n\nAt this point, Spielberg considered returning to direct the sequel. Over the [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial weekend]] in 1976, Spielberg had hammered out a screenplay based on Quint's ''Indianapolis'' speech. Because of his contract for ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', however, he would not be able to work on the film for a further year, a gap too long for the producers.<ref name=\"Ref_f\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=73}}</ref> Production designer [[Joe Alves]] (who would direct ''[[Jaws 3-D]]'') and [[Verna Fields]] (who had been promoted to vice-president at Universal after her acclaimed editing on the first film) proposed that they co-direct it.<ref name=\"makingof\"/><ref name=\"Ref_g\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=74}}</ref> The request was declined by the [[Directors Guild of America]],<ref name=\"Ref_h\">{{harvnb|Rosenfield|1982|1}}</ref> partly because they would not allow a DGA member to be replaced by someone who was not one of its members, and partly because they, in the wake of events on the set of ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'', had instituted a ban on any cast or crew members taking over as director during a film's production. The reins were eventually handed to [[Jeannot Szwarc]], best known for the film ''[[Bug (1975 film)|Bug]]'' and whom Alves knew from working on the TV series ''[[Night Gallery]]''.<ref name=\"Ref_i\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=75\u20136}}</ref> Szwarc recommenced production by filming the complicated water skier scene, giving Gottlieb some time to complete the script.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> He reinstated the character of Deputy Hendricks, played by [[Jeffrey Kramer]], who had been missing from the earlier script.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> Many of the teenagers were sacked, with the remaining roles developed.<ref name=\"Ref_j\">''Jaws 2: A Portrait by Actor Keith Gordon'', ''Jaws 2'' DVD, Written, directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau</ref>\n\nThree sharks were built for the film. The first was the \"platform shark\", also referred to as the \"luxurious shark\". Special mechanical effects supervisor [[Robert Mattey]] and Roy Arbogast used the same body mould used for the shark in the first film.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> The sharks from the original film had rotted behind sheds on the lower lot of Universal Studios in the intervening years, and the only pieces that were salvageable were the chromoly tube frames. Mattey's design was much more complicated and ambitious than the first film. The same (male) body was used, but a brand new head was made by sculptor Chris Mueller which made use of an all-new mouth mechanism, one which incorporated jowls to disguise the pinching of the cheeks that had proven to be a problem with the shark in the original film. The sharks for ''Jaws 2'' were known as ''Bruce Two'' (the sharks for the original film had been nicknamed \"Bruce\", after Steven Spielberg's lawyer), but on set they were referred to as \"Fidel\" and \"Harold\", the latter after David Brown's Beverly Hills lawyer.<ref name=\"kach77\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=77}}</ref>  The other shark props used were a fin and a full shark, both of which could be pulled by boats. \"Cable Junction\", the island shown in the film's climax, was actually a floating barge covered with fiber-glass rocks. This was created in order to enable the shark platform to be positioned to it as close as possible (a real island would have hindered this due to the upward slope of the seabed making the shark platform visible). Like the first film, footage of real sharks filmed by Australian divers [[Ron & Valerie Taylor]] was used for movement shots that could not be convincingly achieved using the mechanical sharks.<ref name=\"makingof\"/>\n\nAlthough the first film was commended for leaving the shark to the imagination until two thirds of the way through, Szwarc felt that they should show it as much as possible because the dramatic \"first image of it coming out of the water\" in the first film could never be repeated. Szwarc believed that the reduction of the first film's [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] suspense was inevitable because the audience already knew what the shark looked like from the first film. Reviewers have since commented that there was no way that they were ever going to duplicate the original's effectiveness. The filmmakers gave the new shark a more menacing look by scarring it in the early boat explosion.<ref name=\"makingof\"/>\n\nLike the first film, shooting on water proved challenging. Scheider said that they were \"always contending with tides, surf and winds ... jellyfish, sharks, waterspouts and hurricane warnings.\"<ref name=\"kach77\"/> After spending hours anchoring the sailboats, the wind would change as they were ready to shoot, blowing the sails in the wrong direction. The saltwater's corrosive effect damaged some equipment, including the metal parts in the sharks.<ref name=\"kach77\"/>\n\n[[Susan Ford]], daughter of U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]], was hired to shoot publicity photographs.<ref name=\"kach76\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=76}}</ref> Many of these appeared in Ray Loynd's ''Jaws 2 Log'', a book documenting the film's production, similar to what Carl Gottlieb had done for the first film.\n\n===Location===\n[[Martha's Vineyard]] was again used as the location for the town scenes and [[Emerald Coast]] was included on this film.<ref>{{cite news |last=Allen |first=Betty Archer |title=GB teens helped keep 'Jaws 2' water scenes moving |url=https://news.gulfbreezenews.com/articles/gb-teens-helped-keep-jaws-2-water-scenes-moving/ |date=August 21, 2008 |access-date=January 17, 2018 |newspaper=Gulf Breeze News}}</ref> Although some residents guarded their privacy, many islanders welcomed the money that the company was bringing.<ref name=\"Ref_k\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=60\u20132}}</ref> Shortly after the production arrived in June 1977, local newspaper the ''Grapevine'' wrote:\n\n{{quote|The ''Jaws'' people are back among us, more efficient, more organized and more moneyed.

Some people, however, were less pleased by the film crew's presence and refused to cooperate. Only one drugstore allowed its windows to be boarded up for the moody look that Hancock wanted. \"Universal Go Home\" T-shirts began appearing on the streets in mid-June 1977.<ref name=\"Ref_m\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=64}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Navarre Beach Florida sand.jpg|thumb|right|The majority of filming was at [[Navarre Beach, Florida|Navarre Beach]] in [[Florida]]]]\nWhen Szwarc took over, the majority of the film was shot at [[Navarre Beach, Florida|Navarre Beach]] in [[Florida]], because of the warm weather and the water's depth being appropriate for the shark platform. The company was at this location from August 1 until December 22, 1977.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> The production \"was a boost to the local economy because local boaters, extras and stand-ins or doubles were hired. Universal brought in actors, directors, producers and their wives, camera and crew people who needed housing, food and clothing for the movie. Services were needed for laundry, dry-cleaning and recreation.\" Navarre's Holiday Inn \"Holidome\" was used as the film's headquarters, with the ground floor converted into production offices, and some of the Gulf-front suites remodelled for David Brown and Roy Scheider. Universal rented 100 of the hotel's 200 rooms, spending $1 million. The Holiday Inn was destroyed in the [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season]].<ref name=\"gbn1\">{{Citation |first=Betty Archer |last=Allen |work=Gulf Breeze News |title=30 years later, Gulf Breeze still recalls 'Jaws 2' excitement |url=http://www.gulfbreezenews.com/news/2008/0807/Front_Page/002.html |date=August 7, 2008 |accessdate=2009-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080825010823/http://www.gulfbreezenews.com/news/2008/0807/Front_Page/002.html |archivedate=August 25, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Boats and parts for their maintenance were purchased from local businesses.

Williams says that it was assumed by everyone that \"the music would come back also and be part of the cast ... it would require new music, certainly, but the signature music of ''Jaws'' should be used as well\". He compares this to \"the great tradition\" for repeating musical themes in Hollywood serials such as ''[[Roy Rogers]]'' and ''[[The Lone Ranger (serial)|The Lone Ranger]]''. In addition to the familiar themes, Szwarc says Williams also composed a \"youthful counterpoint to the shark that is always around when the kids are sailing or going out to sea. It was very inventive\".<ref name=\"musicdvd\">''The Music of Jaws 2'', ''Jaws 2'' DVD, Written, directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau</ref>\n\nSzwarc said that the sequel's music should be \"more complex because it was a more complex film\". Williams says that this score is broader, allowing him to make more use of the orchestra, and use longer notes, and \"fill the space\" created by the director. Williams used a larger ensemble than for the first film, and \"the orchestral palette may have been broader or had longer notes\". Delays in shooting meant that Williams was forced to start working on the score before the film was completed. Szwarc discussed the film with the composer, showing him edited sequences and storyboards. The director praises Williams in being able to work under such difficult conditions.<ref name=\"musicdvd\"/> Critic Mike Beek suggests these time constraints enabled Williams \"to create themes based on ideas and suggestions, rather than a locked down print.\"<ref name=\"Beek\"/>\n\nCritics have praised Williams' score, comparing it favorably to the original. Williams \"uses a few basic elements of the original\u2014the obligatory shark motif, for one\u2014and takes the music off in some new and interesting directions.\" The score is \"more disturbing in places\" than the original, and \"Williams {{sic|fash|ion}} some new and hugely memorable out to sea adventure music.\" Because ''Jaws 2'' \"isn't a film that requires subtlety ...

See WP:FILMPLOT for guidelines on film plots. -->\nWhen a new hotel opens on Amity Island, a gigantic [[great white shark]] ambushes and kills two scuba divers photographing the wreckage of the ''Orca'' and then heads into Amity waters. Their camera, which took pictures during the attack, is recovered the next day. The shark then swiftly kills a female water skier. The driver tries to kill the monster using a gas tank and [[flare gun]]. However, this causes the boat to explode, which kills the driver instead and severely burns the right side of the shark's face.\n\nA [[killer whale]] carcass bearing fatal wounds is found beached. Police Chief Martin Brody believes that a shark is responsible for these events. Brody explains his concerns to Mayor Larry Vaughn, who expresses doubts that the town has another shark problem following the events of the [[Jaws (film)|previous movie]]. Brody then finds floating debris from the destroyed speedboat and the boat driver's burnt remains. Brody calls Matt Hooper for assistance, but he is unavailable due to being in Antarctica on a research expedition. Brody prohibits his son Mike from boating out of concern for his safety and instead lands him a job on the beach, much to Mike's dismay.\n\nThe following day, Brody watches from an observation tower and causes a panic after mistaking a school of bluefish for a shark, and shooting at it with his gun. However, his fears are confirmed when photos from the diver's camera are processed, and one of them shows a close-up of the shark. When he presents it to the Amity Town Council, they refuse to believe it is a shark, and vote Brody out as police chief with the sole dissent coming from the Mayor.\n\nThe next morning, Mike disobeys his father's orders by sneaking out to go sailing with his friends, taking his younger brother Sean with him to silence him. Marge, another teen, takes Sean with her, and they head out on six separate boats, going past a team of divers led by instructor Tom Andrews. Moments after submerging and catching lobster, Andrews encounters the shark. Panicking, he rushes to the surface, causing an [[embolism]]. Soon after, the shark hits the boat of teenagers Tina and Eddie, who have strayed away from the others; Eddie falls into the water and is eaten.\n\nBrody and his wife Ellen witness Tom's evacuation by ambulance and hear that the other divers suspect something scared him underwater. Former deputy Len Hendricks, who has taken over as Brody's replacement, tells them that Mike went sailing with his friends, so Brody and Ellen commandeer the police boat (aided by a reluctant Hendricks) to rescue them. They come across Tina's boat and find her hiding in the [[bow (ship)|bow]], whereupon she confirms the shark's presence. Brody hails a passing boat to take Hendricks, Ellen, and Tina to shore, where the truth is revealed, while he goes on to find the kids.\n \nMeanwhile, the shark attacks the group, striking one of their boats and causing most of them to capsize or crash into each other in the ensuing chaos. Mike is knocked unconscious, falls in the water, and nearly gets eaten. The only pair whose boat is still seaworthy barely pull him out and leave the others to take him ashore and get help, while Sean and the others remain adrift on the wreckage of tangled boats. A [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] marine helicopter that Brody contacted arrives to tow them to shore, but the shark latches onto the chopper's pontoons, capsizing it and drowning the pilot in the process. It then knocks Sean into the water, and Marge is killed while saving him.\n\nBrody finds Mike, who informs him of the situation and apologizes for not knowing about the shark; Brody accepts his apology while telling him to get to safety, then finds the others at Cable Junction, a small island housing an electrical relay station that supplies power to Amity. The cheering and jumping that greet him attract the shark, which attacks again, causing him to maroon the police boat. He tries to pull them in with a winch but instead hooks an underwater power cable. The shark's next move sends most of the teenagers into the water, and they swim to the edge of Cable Junction, while Jackie Peters, Mike's love interest, and Sean are still on the boats. Using an inflatable raft, Brody taps the power cable with an oar to lure the shark towards him, holding the cable out in front of him. The shark bites the cable, which electrocutes it until it dies. Brody collects Sean and Jackie and they join the others on Cable Junction to await rescue.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Roy Scheider]] as Chief Martin Brody\n* [[Lorraine Gary]] as Ellen Brody\n* [[Murray Hamilton]] as Mayor Larry Vaughn\n* [[Joseph Mascolo]] as Len Peterson\n* [[Jeffrey Kramer]] as Deputy Jeff Hendricks\n* [[Collin Wilcox (actress)|Collin Wilcox]] as Dr. Elkins\n* [[Ann Dusenberry]] as Tina Wilcox\n* [[Mark Gruner]] as Michael \"Mike\" Brody\n* [[Susan French]] as Old Lady\n* [[Barry Coe]] as Tom Andrews\n* Gary Springer as Andy Nicholas\n* [[Donna Wilkes]] as Jackie Peters\n* [[Gary Dubin]] as Eddie Marchand\n* [[John Dukakis]] as Paul 'Polo' Loman\n* G.

He claimed that the planned plot was to involve the sons of Quint and Brody hunting a new shark.<ref name=\"Ref_\">{{harvnb|Baxter|1997|p=145}}</ref> Brown said that Spielberg did not want to direct the sequel because he felt that he had done the \"definitive shark movie\".<ref name=\"makingof\"/><ref name=\"Prigg\u00e98\">{{harvnb|Prigg\u00e9|2004|p=8}}</ref> The director later added that his decision was influenced by the problems the ''Jaws'' production faced \u2013 \"I would have done the sequel if I hadn't had such a horrible time at sea on the first film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/06/08/steven-spielberg-jaws-interview/|title=Steven Spielberg talks about 'Jaws' \u2013 the greatest summer movie ever made|first=Chris|last=Nashawaty|date=2011-06-08|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2012-01-02}}</ref>\n\nDespite Spielberg's rejection, the studio went ahead with plans to make the sequel, leading to an arduous 18-month pre-production process. [[Howard Sackler]], who had contributed to the first film's script but chose not to be credited, was charged with writing the first draft. He originally proposed a [[prequel]] based on the sinking of the [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS ''Indianapolis'']], the story relayed by [[Quint (Jaws character)|Quint]] in the first film. Although Universal president [[Sidney Sheinberg]] thought Sackler's [[Film treatment|treatment]] for the film was intriguing, he rejected the idea.<ref name=\"Ref_a\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=24\u20135}}</ref> On Sackler's recommendation, theatre and film director [[John D. Hancock]] was chosen to helm the picture.<ref name=\"Ref_b\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=27}}</ref> \n\nHancock began filming in June 1977. However, after nearly a month of filming, Universal and MCA executives disliked the dark, subtle tone that the film was taking and wanted a more lighthearted and action oriented story. Additionally, Hancock ran into trouble with Sheinberg, who suggested to Hancock and Tristan that his (Sheinberg's) wife, actress [[Lorraine Gary]] (Ellen Brody), \"should go out on a boat and help to rescue the kids.\" When told of the idea, Zanuck replied, \"Over my dead body.\" The next draft of the film's screenplay was turned in with Gary not going out to sea. Hancock says that this, and his later firing of another actress who turned out to be a Universal executive's girlfriend, contributed to his own dismissal from the film.<ref name=\"luke\">{{harvnb|Ford|2004|p=191}}</ref>\n\nHancock began to feel the pressure of directing his first epic adventure film \"with only three film credits, and all small-scale dramas\".<ref name=\"Ref_c\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=66}}</ref> The producers were unhappy with his material, and on a Saturday evening in June 1977, after a meeting with the producers and Universal executives, the director was fired. He and his wife left for [[Rome]] and production was shut down for a few weeks. The couple had been involved in the film for eighteen months.<ref name=\"Ref_d\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=70}}</ref> Hancock blamed his departure on the mechanical shark, telling a newspaper that it still could not swim or bite after a year and a half: \"You get a couple of shots, and [the shark] breaks.\"<ref name=\"kach78\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=78}}</ref> Echoing the first film's production, [[Carl Gottlieb]] was enlisted to further revise the script, adding humor and reducing some of the violence.<ref name=\"Ref_e\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=36\u20137}}</ref> Gottlieb wrote on location at [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida]].<ref name=\"Gottlieb221\">{{harvnb|Gottlieb|2010|p=221}}</ref> It cost the producers more money to hire Gottlieb to do the rewrite than it would have if they had hired him in the first place.<ref name=\"Ref_e\"/>\n\nAt this point, Spielberg considered returning to direct the sequel. Over the [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial weekend]] in 1976, Spielberg had hammered out a screenplay based on Quint's ''Indianapolis'' speech. Because of his contract for ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', however, he would not be able to work on the film for a further year, a gap too long for the producers.<ref name=\"Ref_f\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=73}}</ref> Production designer [[Joe Alves]] (who would direct ''[[Jaws 3-D]]'') and [[Verna Fields]] (who had been promoted to vice-president at Universal after her acclaimed editing on the first film) proposed that they co-direct it.<ref name=\"makingof\"/><ref name=\"Ref_g\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=74}}</ref> The request was declined by the [[Directors Guild of America]],<ref name=\"Ref_h\">{{harvnb|Rosenfield|1982|1}}</ref> partly because they would not allow a DGA member to be replaced by someone who was not one of its members, and partly because they, in the wake of events on the set of ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'', had instituted a ban on any cast or crew members taking over as director during a film's production. The reins were eventually handed to [[Jeannot Szwarc]], best known for the film ''[[Bug (1975 film)|Bug]]'' and whom Alves knew from working on the TV series ''[[Night Gallery]]''.<ref name=\"Ref_i\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=75\u20136}}</ref> Szwarc recommenced production by filming the complicated water skier scene, giving Gottlieb some time to complete the script.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> He reinstated the character of Deputy Hendricks, played by [[Jeffrey Kramer]], who had been missing from the earlier script.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> Many of the teenagers were sacked, with the remaining roles developed.<ref name=\"Ref_j\">''Jaws 2: A Portrait by Actor Keith Gordon'', ''Jaws 2'' DVD, Written, directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau</ref>\n\nThree sharks were built for the film. The first was the \"platform shark\", also referred to as the \"luxurious shark\". Special mechanical effects supervisor [[Robert Mattey]] and Roy Arbogast used the same body mould used for the shark in the first film.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> The sharks from the original film had rotted behind sheds on the lower lot of Universal Studios in the intervening years, and the only pieces that were salvageable were the chromoly tube frames. Mattey's design was much more complicated and ambitious than the first film. The same (male) body was used, but a brand new head was made by sculptor Chris Mueller which made use of an all-new mouth mechanism, one which incorporated jowls to disguise the pinching of the cheeks that had proven to be a problem with the shark in the original film. The sharks for ''Jaws 2'' were known as ''Bruce Two'' (the sharks for the original film had been nicknamed \"Bruce\", after Steven Spielberg's lawyer), but on set they were referred to as \"Fidel\" and \"Harold\", the latter after David Brown's Beverly Hills lawyer.<ref name=\"kach77\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=77}}</ref>  The other shark props used were a fin and a full shark, both of which could be pulled by boats. \"Cable Junction\", the island shown in the film's climax, was actually a floating barge covered with fiber-glass rocks. This was created in order to enable the shark platform to be positioned to it as close as possible (a real island would have hindered this due to the upward slope of the seabed making the shark platform visible). Like the first film, footage of real sharks filmed by Australian divers [[Ron & Valerie Taylor]] was used for movement shots that could not be convincingly achieved using the mechanical sharks.<ref name=\"makingof\"/>\n\nAlthough the first film was commended for leaving the shark to the imagination until two thirds of the way through, Szwarc felt that they should show it as much as possible because the dramatic \"first image of it coming out of the water\" in the first film could never be repeated. Szwarc believed that the reduction of the first film's [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] suspense was inevitable because the audience already knew what the shark looked like from the first film. Reviewers have since commented that there was no way that they were ever going to duplicate the original's effectiveness. The filmmakers gave the new shark a more menacing look by scarring it in the early boat explosion.<ref name=\"makingof\"/>\n\nLike the first film, shooting on water proved challenging. Scheider said that they were \"always contending with tides, surf and winds ... jellyfish, sharks, waterspouts and hurricane warnings.\"<ref name=\"kach77\"/> After spending hours anchoring the sailboats, the wind would change as they were ready to shoot, blowing the sails in the wrong direction. The saltwater's corrosive effect damaged some equipment, including the metal parts in the sharks.<ref name=\"kach77\"/>\n\n[[Susan Ford]], daughter of U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]], was hired to shoot publicity photographs.<ref name=\"kach76\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=76}}</ref> Many of these appeared in Ray Loynd's ''Jaws 2 Log'', a book documenting the film's production, similar to what Carl Gottlieb had done for the first film.\n\n===Location===\n[[Martha's Vineyard]] was again used as the location for the town scenes and [[Emerald Coast]] was included on this film.<ref>{{cite news |last=Allen |first=Betty Archer |title=GB teens helped keep 'Jaws 2' water scenes moving |url=https://news.gulfbreezenews.com/articles/gb-teens-helped-keep-jaws-2-water-scenes-moving/ |date=August 21, 2008 |access-date=January 17, 2018 |newspaper=Gulf Breeze News}}</ref> Although some residents guarded their privacy, many islanders welcomed the money that the company was bringing.<ref name=\"Ref_k\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=60\u20132}}</ref> Shortly after the production arrived in June 1977, local newspaper the ''Grapevine'' wrote:\n\n{{quote|The ''Jaws'' people are back among us, more efficient, more organized and more moneyed.

Universal brought in actors, directors, producers and their wives, camera and crew people who needed housing, food and clothing for the movie. Services were needed for laundry, dry-cleaning and recreation.\" Navarre's Holiday Inn \"Holidome\" was used as the film's headquarters, with the ground floor converted into production offices, and some of the Gulf-front suites remodelled for David Brown and Roy Scheider.

Williams says that it was assumed by everyone that \"the music would come back also and be part of the cast ... it would require new music, certainly, but the signature music of ''Jaws'' should be used as well\". He compares this to \"the great tradition\" for repeating musical themes in Hollywood serials such as ''[[Roy Rogers]]'' and ''[[The Lone Ranger (serial)|The Lone Ranger]]''. In addition to the familiar themes, Szwarc says Williams also composed a \"youthful counterpoint to the shark that is always around when the kids are sailing or going out to sea. It was very inventive\".<ref name=\"musicdvd\">''The Music of Jaws 2'', ''Jaws 2'' DVD, Written, directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau</ref>\n\nSzwarc said that the sequel's music should be \"more complex because it was a more complex film\". Williams says that this score is broader, allowing him to make more use of the orchestra, and use longer notes, and \"fill the space\" created by the director. Williams used a larger ensemble than for the first film, and \"the orchestral palette may have been broader or had longer notes\". Delays in shooting meant that Williams was forced to start working on the score before the film was completed. Szwarc discussed the film with the composer, showing him edited sequences and storyboards. The director praises Williams in being able to work under such difficult conditions.<ref name=\"musicdvd\"/> Critic Mike Beek suggests these time constraints enabled Williams \"to create themes based on ideas and suggestions, rather than a locked down print.\"<ref name=\"Beek\"/>\n\nCritics have praised Williams' score, comparing it favorably to the original. Williams \"uses a few basic elements of the original\u2014the obligatory shark motif, for one\u2014and takes the music off in some new and interesting directions.\" The score is \"more disturbing in places\" than the original, and \"Williams {{sic|fash|ion}} some new and hugely memorable out to sea adventure music.\" Because ''Jaws 2'' \"isn't a film that requires subtlety ...

[[Hummus]] is made of cooked, mashed [[chickpeas]] typically blended with tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and garlic. Tahini sauce is also a popular topping for meat and vegetables in [[Middle Eastern cuisine]].

It sometimes has mashed or sliced [[pistachio]] pieces sprinkled inside or on top. It is usually spread on bread and eaten as a quick snack.\n\nIn [[Armenia]], tahini can be used as a sauce to put on ''[[lahmajoun]]''. In [[Greece]], tahini ({{lang-el|\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03af\u03bd\u03b9}}) is used as a spread on bread either alone or topped with honey or jam. Jars of tahini ready-mixed with honey or cocoa are available in the breakfast food aisles of Greek supermarkets. In [[Cyprus]], tahini, locally known as ''tashi'', is used as a dip for bread and in ''pitta [[souvlaki]]'' rather than ''tzatziki'', which is customary in Greece. \n\nTahini is called ''ardeh'' ({{lang|fa|\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0647}}) in [[Persian language|Persian]].

It is also eaten during breakfast, usually with an accompanying sweet substance, usually [[grape syrup]], [[date syrup]], honey, jams, etc. Ardeh and halvardeh are among the souvenirs of the Iranian cities of [[Yazd, Iran|Yazd]] and [[Ardakan, Iran|Ardakan]].\n\nIn [[Turkey]], tahini ({{lang-tr|tahin}}) is mixed with [[pekmez]] to make ''tahin-pekmez'' which is often served as a [[breakfast]] item or after meals as a sweet dip for breads. In [[Iraq]], tahini is known as ''rashi'', and is mixed with [[Phoenix dactylifera|date]] syrup ([[Rub (syrup)|rub]]) to make a sweet dessert usually eaten with bread.\n\nIn [[Israel]], tahini ({{lang-he|\u05d8\u05d7\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4}} ''t'hina'') is a staple foodstuff. It is served as a dip with flat bread or pita, a topping for many foods such as [[falafel]], [[sabich]], [[Jerusalem mixed grill]] and [[shwarma]], and as an ingredient in various spreads. It is also used as a sauce for meat and fish, and in sweet desserts like [[halva]], halva parfait,<ref>Rogov, Daniel, [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Food/Halvahparfait.html Halvah Parfait]</ref> [[halva ice cream]] and [[tahini cookie]]s.\nIt is also served baked in the oven with ''[[kufta]]'' made of lamb or beef with spices and herbs, or with a whole fish in the coastal areas and the [[Sea of Galilee]].\n\nIn the [[Levant]], tahini ([[Levantine Arabic]]: ''t'hine'') is a staple foodstuff prepared with salt, lemon juice, and optionally mashed garlic. It is served as a dip with pita, or a topping for [[falafel]] and [[shwarma]], and as an ingredient in various spreads. It is also used as a sauce for meat and fish. It is a main ingredient in a seafood dish called ''[[siyadiyeh]]''. Tahini is used in sweet desserts like halva and halva with pistachios.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn the [[Gaza Strip]], a rust-colored variety known as \"red tahina\" is served in addition to ordinary tahina.

In the UK, the acronym [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] is widely used. In contrast, in the USA, [[LGBT]] is more commonly used. The terms '[[lesbian]]', '[[gay]]', '[[Bisexuality|bisexual]]', '[[Transgender|trans]]' and '[[queer]]' are not used all around the world and definitions vary.\n\nApart from the terms above, there are other words and phrases that are used to define [[sexuality]] and [[gender identity]]. These words and phrases typically come from [[western culture]]s. In contrast, in non-western cultures, the range of sexual and gender identities and practices are labelled and categorized using different languages, which naturally also involve different concepts compared to Western ones.\n\nIt is concerned with the study of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals' [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] \u2013 [[Sexual identity|sexual identities]] and [[Sexual behaviour|behaviours]] \u2013 thereby validating their unique identities and experiences.

In raising this awareness, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology aims to be one of the fields in which inclusive, non-heterosexist, non-genderist approaches are applied in psychological research and practice.<ref name=\":0\" /> In line with [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology being an inclusive field of study and practice, it welcomes scholars or professionals from any branch of psychology with an interest in [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] research.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Alfred Kinsey (5493900781).jpg|thumb|333px|[[Alfred Kinsey]].]]\n\n=== Sexology ===\n[[Sexology]] is a part of the historical foundation upon which [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology was built.<ref name=\":2\" /> The work of early sexologists, in particular those who contributed to the establishment of [[sexology]] as a scientific field of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[Androgyny|gender ambiguity]], is highly relevant and seminal to the field of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology.\n\nAs previously mentioned, [[sexology]] is a scientific field of study focusing on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]]. In the field of [[sexology]], a broad classification spectrum known as inversion, is used to define [[homosexuality]]. On this spectrum, early sexologists included both '[[Homosexuality|same-sex sexuality]]' and 'cross-gender identification' as belonging to this all-inclusive category. More contemporary sexology researchers conceptualize and categorize [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender diversity]] separately. In terms of [[LGBT|LGB]] sexualities, this would fall under [[sexual diversity]]. As for [[transsexual]]ity, this would be placed under [[gender diversity]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Important figures in this field include [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] and [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs|Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]].\n\n=== The historical emergence of 'gay affirmative' psychology ===\nGay affirmative psychology was first established in the 1970s. It was founded with the mission of 1) challenging the idea and view of [[homosexuality]] as a [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] and 2) affirming the normal and healthy psychological functioning of [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] individuals by dispelling beliefs and attitudes of [[homosexuality]] being associated with [[Mental disorder|mental illness]].<ref>Brown, L. S. (1989). New voices, new visions: Toward a lesbian/gay paradigm for psychology. ''Psychology of Women Quarterly, 13''(4), 445\u2013458.</ref>\n\nFollowing this field's mission, most of the research conducted in this area has naturally looked at the pathologization of homosexuality. In relation to this, much attention has also been placed on [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and non-trans individuals' lived experiences.\n\nBy involving [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals, mainstream psychological research could be more inclusive. With this in mind, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychologists hold the firm belief that psychology can truly be called the 'psychology of people' if it includes an open-minded, accepting attitude towards examining individuals from all backgrounds and their diverse lived experiences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1980s, the name ''gay affirmative psychology'' changed to [[Lesbian]] and [[Gay]] psychology to denote that this branch of psychology spanned both the lives and experiences of [[Human male sexuality|gay men]] and [[lesbian women]].<ref>Clarke, V., & Peel, E. (2007). From lesbian and gay psychology to LGBTQ psychologies: A journey into the unknown (or unknownable)? In V. Clarke and E. Peel (Eds.), ''Out in Psychology: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer Perspectives.'' Chichester, UK: Wiley.</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> Later on, additional terms were included in the name of this field. Variations of LGB, LGBT, LGBTQ or LGBTQI are used to refer to the field of LGBTQ psychology.\n\nDue to the variation in the terminology to define this field, it has led to significant discussion and debate regarding which term is the most inclusive of all individuals. Though there continues to be ongoing debate surrounding the terminology used to define the field of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology, this in fact highlights the field's concern over the diversity in [[human sexuality]] and gender orientation.

These issues usually result from a combination of negative experiences and a perpetual difficulty accepting their [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identity in an anti-LGBTQ society.<ref>Cochran, S. D. (2001).

Compared to their non-LGBTQ peers, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth typically engage in a higher rate (around 3 to 4 times higher) of [[Suicide attempt|attempted suicides]]. In school, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth have a higher likelihood of experiencing [[Verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[physical abuse]] due to their [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]] and [[Gender expression|expression]]. [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth quickly learn from these negative social experiences that they are more likely to receive negative judgment and treatment, and often rejection, from those around them. This becomes a vicious cycle in which [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youths' self-beliefs and self-perceptions are negatively reinforced by society. Evidently, the high rates of mental health issues among [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] communities has been perpetuated, and continues to be so, by systemic prejudice and discrimination against [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals.<ref>Savin-Williams, R. C.; Ream, G. L. (2003). \"Suicide attempts among sexual-minority male youth\". ''Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology''.

What is common are the reasons leading to [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]]. In the context of LGBTQ-targeted [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]], it broadly relates to [[sexual orientation]] issues (e.g. LGB) or [[gender identity]] issues (e.g. transgender). Systemic [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] leads to [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals experiencing substantial amounts of stress on a long term basis. It also influences [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals to internally assimilate all the negativity they receive, emphasizing the differences they have with others. This, in turn, causes [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals to experience guilt and shame regarding their identity, feelings and actions.<ref>Meyer, I. H. (2003).

This process is about [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals openly proclaiming their [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[gender identity]] to others.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals also experience other negative outcomes, for example:\n\n[[Sexual orientation]] and/or [[Transitioning (transgender)|gender transition]]\n[[Internalized oppression]] of [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[gender identity]]\n* Exclusion and ostracization\n* Removed or reduced [[family]] or [[social support]]\n* Facilitating [[mental health]] well-being for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals is a highly pertinent matter.\nThe main factors in promoting positive [[mental health]] for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals are as follows:<ref>Monsen, J.

Since 2000 the average age of '[[coming out]]' was around 14. This age compared to the average age of 16 recorded between 1996 and 1998, and 20 during the 1970s, shows that [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth are comfortably recognizing their [[Sexual identity|sexual]] or [[Gender identity|gender identities]] at an earlier age. Based on the large aggregate of research on identity development, in particular [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]], it appears that young people have an awareness of their [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identity from an early age. This awareness can be observed starting in [[childhood]], specifically the feeling of being different from their peers and non-normative appearances, behaviours and interests.\n\nDuring adolescence, there are gradual shifts in young people's attitudes and behaviours regarding themselves and others. At the beginning of [[adolescence]], young people are more aware of, and concerned about how they and others present against [[Gender norms|gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] norms. In the middle of [[adolescence]], young people tend to hold more biased, stereotypical attitudes and show more negative behaviours towards [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals and topics. It is clear that the early adolescence years make it easy for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth who have '[[Coming out|come out]]' to have negative or unpleasant social experiences. These experiences could involve peers intentionally excluding them from friendship groups, peers engaging in persistent, harmful acts of [[bullying]], and more.<ref>Goldman, L. (2007). Coming out, coming in: Nurturing the well-being and inclusion of gay youth in mainstream society. New York: Routledge.</ref>\n\nWhile there appears to be more and more [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth '[[coming out]]' about their [[Sexual identity|sexual]] and [[Gender identity|gender identities]], there are also youth who do not \"[[Coming out|come out]]\" and are against the idea of '[[coming out]]'. Thus far, psychological theory surrounding [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identity development suggests that individuals who do not '[[Coming out|come out]]', or are against the idea of '[[coming out]]' are either in denial about their identity or wish to '[[Coming out|come out]]' but are unable to. Aside from the fact that [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth are more vulnerable to experiencing negative social reactions and treatment as a result of '[[coming out]]',<ref name=\":4\" /> there may also be other reasons for this. Firstly, the higher visibility of diverse sexualities and [[Gender identity|gender identities]] could influence young people in becoming more reluctant towards concretely defining their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]]<ref>Savin-Williams, R. C. (2005). ''The new gay teenager.'' Cambridge, MA: harvard University Press.</ref>(Savin-Williams, 2005). Young people are turning away from these types of labels in opposition of [[social identity]] labels, demonstrating the importance of their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]] within their [[personal identity]].<ref>Cohler, B. J., & Hammack, P. L. (2007). The psychological world of the gay teenager: Social change, narrative, and 'normality'. ''Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 36''(1), 47\u201359.</ref> As well, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals from [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] and [[cultural minority]] groups refrain from using [[sexual identity]] labels, which they see as westernized concepts that do not relate to them.<ref>Chan, C. S. (1996). Don't ask, don't tell, don't know: Sexual identity and expression among East Asian-American lesbians. In B. Zimmerman and [[Toni A. H.

New York: The Feminist Press.</ref>\n\n== Schools ==\n\nCurrent data regarding [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] and their children show an increasing number of such families, as in the United States of America, and suggests that this number is continuously increasing.<ref>Byard, E., Kosciw, J., & Bartkiewicz, M. (2013). Schools and LGBT-parent families: Creating change through programming and advocacy. In A. Goldberg & K. ALlen (Eds.), ''LGBT-Parent Families''.

Apart from children of [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] having negative school experiences, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents also face challenges with regards to anti-LGBTQ bias and related negative behaviours that are often a part of the [[school climate]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n[[File:GSAboard.JPG|thumb|310x310px|Gay-Straight Alliance]]\n\n[[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents can refer to the following strategies to facilitate a more safe, positive and welcoming experience in interacting with schools and school personnel: school choice, engagement and advocacy. Many schools are not particularly inclusive of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals, as anti-LGBTQ language is often used and cases of [[harassment]] and [[Victimology|victimization]] with regards to [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]] often occur. Therefore, parental choice of the school in which their child enrolls is crucial. As far as parents are able to select a school for their child, selecting a school that is inclusive of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals is one way to ensure a more positive school experience for themselves and for their children. Parental engagement with schools in terms of volunteering and other forms of involvement, such as being on parent-teacher organizations, allows [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents to be more involved in issues which may concern their child. Parents can access resources that provide information on how parents can facilitate dialogue and collaboration with teachers and schools, enabling them to become proactive advocates of their child's education and school experience.<ref>Kosciw, J.G., & Diaz, E.M. ( 2008). Involved, invisible, ignored: The experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender parents and their children in our nation's K-12 schools. New, NY York: GLSEN</ref>\n\nSchool-based interventions are also effective in improving the experiences of children from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]]. Typically, these interventions target [[school climate]], in particular the aspects which pertain to [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]]. Enforcing [[anti-bullying legislation|anti-bullying]]/harassment policies and laws in schools can protect students from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] from being victims of [[bullying]] and [[harassment]]. Having these policies in place generally allows students to have fewer negative experiences in school, such as a lower likelihood of mistreatment by teachers and other students. Implementing professional development opportunities for school staff on how to provide appropriate support for students from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] will not only facilitate a more positive school experience for students, but will in turn, lead to a more positive [[school climate]] in general. Using an LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum where [[LGBT history|LGBTQ individuals, history and events]] are portrayed in a more positive manner allows students to become more aware and more accepting of LGBTQ-related issues. Specific ways in which [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] matters can be incorporated into the curriculum include: talking about diverse families (e.g. [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]] and [[LGBT families|LGBTQ parents]]), discussing [[LGBT history|LGBTQ history]] (e.g. talking about significant historical events and movements related to the [[LGBT community|LGBTQ community]]), using LGBTQ-inclusive texts in class and celebrating [[List of LGBT events|LGBTQ events]] (e.g. [[LGBT History Month|LGBTQ History Month]] in October or [[LGBT Pride Month|LGBTQ Pride Month]] in June). On top of this, organizing [[LGBT student organizations|LGBTQ student clubs]] (e.g. [[Gay\u2013straight alliance|Gay-Straight Alliances]]) are a positive resource and source of support for students from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]].<ref>Hutton, S.

Adolescents that took part in this treatment had fewer suicidal thoughts and fewer depression-related thoughts and feelings.

In the field of [[sexology]], a broad classification spectrum known as inversion, is used to define [[homosexuality]]. On this spectrum, early sexologists included both '[[Homosexuality|same-sex sexuality]]' and 'cross-gender identification' as belonging to this all-inclusive category. More contemporary sexology researchers conceptualize and categorize [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender diversity]] separately. In terms of [[LGBT|LGB]] sexualities, this would fall under [[sexual diversity]]. As for [[transsexual]]ity, this would be placed under [[gender diversity]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Important figures in this field include [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] and [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs|Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]].\n\n=== The historical emergence of 'gay affirmative' psychology ===\nGay affirmative psychology was first established in the 1970s. It was founded with the mission of 1) challenging the idea and view of [[homosexuality]] as a [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] and 2) affirming the normal and healthy psychological functioning of [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] individuals by dispelling beliefs and attitudes of [[homosexuality]] being associated with [[Mental disorder|mental illness]].<ref>Brown, L. S. (1989). New voices, new visions: Toward a lesbian/gay paradigm for psychology. ''Psychology of Women Quarterly, 13''(4), 445\u2013458.</ref>\n\nFollowing this field's mission, most of the research conducted in this area has naturally looked at the pathologization of homosexuality. In relation to this, much attention has also been placed on [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and non-trans individuals' lived experiences.\n\nBy involving [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals, mainstream psychological research could be more inclusive. With this in mind, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychologists hold the firm belief that psychology can truly be called the 'psychology of people' if it includes an open-minded, accepting attitude towards examining individuals from all backgrounds and their diverse lived experiences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1980s, the name ''gay affirmative psychology'' changed to [[Lesbian]] and [[Gay]] psychology to denote that this branch of psychology spanned both the lives and experiences of [[Human male sexuality|gay men]] and [[lesbian women]].<ref>Clarke, V., & Peel, E.

(1996). ''Psychology and sexual orientation: Coming to terms.'' New York: Routledge.</ref> These negative experiences put [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals' physical and emotional well-being at risk.

These issues usually result from a combination of negative experiences and a perpetual difficulty accepting their [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identity in an anti-LGBTQ society.<ref>Cochran, S. D. (2001). Emerging issues in research on lesbians' and gay men's mental health: Does sexual orientation really matter?

Compared to their non-LGBTQ peers, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth typically engage in a higher rate (around 3 to 4 times higher) of [[Suicide attempt|attempted suicides]]. In school, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth have a higher likelihood of experiencing [[Verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[physical abuse]] due to their [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]] and [[Gender expression|expression]]. [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth quickly learn from these negative social experiences that they are more likely to receive negative judgment and treatment, and often rejection, from those around them. This becomes a vicious cycle in which [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youths' self-beliefs and self-perceptions are negatively reinforced by society. Evidently, the high rates of mental health issues among [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] communities has been perpetuated, and continues to be so, by systemic prejudice and discrimination against [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals.<ref>Savin-Williams, R. C.; Ream, G. L. (2003). \"Suicide attempts among sexual-minority male youth\". ''Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology''. '''32''' (4): 509\u2013522. doi:10.1207/s15374424jccp3204_3</ref>\n\nNevertheless, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals do not necessarily experience the same types of [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]], nor do they respond in the same ways to [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]]. What is common are the reasons leading to [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]]. In the context of LGBTQ-targeted [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]], it broadly relates to [[sexual orientation]] issues (e.g. LGB) or [[gender identity]] issues (e.g. transgender). Systemic [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] leads to [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals experiencing substantial amounts of stress on a long term basis. It also influences [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals to internally assimilate all the negativity they receive, emphasizing the differences they have with others. This, in turn, causes [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals to experience guilt and shame regarding their identity, feelings and actions.<ref>Meyer, I. H. (2003). Prejudice, social stress, and mental health in lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations: Conceptual issues and research evidence.

This process is about [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals openly proclaiming their [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[gender identity]] to others.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals also experience other negative outcomes, for example:\n\n[[Sexual orientation]] and/or [[Transitioning (transgender)|gender transition]]\n[[Internalized oppression]] of [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[gender identity]]\n* Exclusion and ostracization\n* Removed or reduced [[family]] or [[social support]]\n* Facilitating [[mental health]] well-being for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals is a highly pertinent matter.\nThe main factors in promoting positive [[mental health]] for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals are as follows:<ref>Monsen, J. J., & Bayley, S. (2007). Educational psychology practice with LGB youth in schools: Individual and institutional interventions. In V. Clarke and E.

Since 2000 the average age of '[[coming out]]' was around 14. This age compared to the average age of 16 recorded between 1996 and 1998, and 20 during the 1970s, shows that [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth are comfortably recognizing their [[Sexual identity|sexual]] or [[Gender identity|gender identities]] at an earlier age. Based on the large aggregate of research on identity development, in particular [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]], it appears that young people have an awareness of their [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identity from an early age. This awareness can be observed starting in [[childhood]], specifically the feeling of being different from their peers and non-normative appearances, behaviours and interests.\n\nDuring adolescence, there are gradual shifts in young people's attitudes and behaviours regarding themselves and others. At the beginning of [[adolescence]], young people are more aware of, and concerned about how they and others present against [[Gender norms|gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] norms. In the middle of [[adolescence]], young people tend to hold more biased, stereotypical attitudes and show more negative behaviours towards [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals and topics. It is clear that the early adolescence years make it easy for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth who have '[[Coming out|come out]]' to have negative or unpleasant social experiences. These experiences could involve peers intentionally excluding them from friendship groups, peers engaging in persistent, harmful acts of [[bullying]], and more.<ref>Goldman, L. (2007). Coming out, coming in: Nurturing the well-being and inclusion of gay youth in mainstream society. New York: Routledge.</ref>\n\nWhile there appears to be more and more [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth '[[coming out]]' about their [[Sexual identity|sexual]] and [[Gender identity|gender identities]], there are also youth who do not \"[[Coming out|come out]]\" and are against the idea of '[[coming out]]'. Thus far, psychological theory surrounding [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identity development suggests that individuals who do not '[[Coming out|come out]]', or are against the idea of '[[coming out]]' are either in denial about their identity or wish to '[[Coming out|come out]]' but are unable to. Aside from the fact that [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth are more vulnerable to experiencing negative social reactions and treatment as a result of '[[coming out]]',<ref name=\":4\" /> there may also be other reasons for this. Firstly, the higher visibility of diverse sexualities and [[Gender identity|gender identities]] could influence young people in becoming more reluctant towards concretely defining their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]]<ref>Savin-Williams, R. C. (2005). ''The new gay teenager.'' Cambridge, MA: harvard University Press.</ref>(Savin-Williams, 2005). Young people are turning away from these types of labels in opposition of [[social identity]] labels, demonstrating the importance of their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]] within their [[personal identity]].<ref>Cohler, B. J., & Hammack, P. L. (2007). The psychological world of the gay teenager: Social change, narrative, and 'normality'. ''Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 36''(1), 47\u201359.</ref> As well, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals from [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] and [[cultural minority]] groups refrain from using [[sexual identity]] labels, which they see as westernized concepts that do not relate to them.<ref>Chan, C. S. (1996). Don't ask, don't tell, don't know: Sexual identity and expression among East Asian-American lesbians. In B. Zimmerman and [[Toni A. H. McNaron]] (Eds.), ''The New Lesbian Studies: Into the Twenty-First Century'' (pp.91\u201397). New York: The Feminist Press.</ref>\n\n== Schools ==\n\nCurrent data regarding [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] and their children show an increasing number of such families, as in the United States of America, and suggests that this number is continuously increasing.<ref>Byard, E., Kosciw, J., & Bartkiewicz, M. (2013). Schools and LGBT-parent families: Creating change through programming and advocacy. In A. Goldberg & K. ALlen (Eds.), ''LGBT-Parent Families''. New York, NY: Springer</ref> Children of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents are at risk of being the targets of [[discrimination]] and [[violence]] against [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals in the education system.<ref name=\":5\">Amato, P. R. (2012). The well-being of children with gay and lesbian parents. ''Social Science Research, 41'', 771\u2013774.</ref> Therefore, this is an important issue that must be addressed to ensure the [[Physical well-being|physical]] and [[psychological well-being]] of children from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]]. Apart from children of [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] having negative school experiences, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents also face challenges with regards to anti-LGBTQ bias and related negative behaviours that are often a part of the [[school climate]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n[[File:GSAboard.JPG|thumb|310x310px|Gay-Straight Alliance]]\n\n[[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents can refer to the following strategies to facilitate a more safe, positive and welcoming experience in interacting with schools and school personnel: school choice, engagement and advocacy. Many schools are not particularly inclusive of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals, as anti-LGBTQ language is often used and cases of [[harassment]] and [[Victimology|victimization]] with regards to [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]] often occur. Therefore, parental choice of the school in which their child enrolls is crucial. As far as parents are able to select a school for their child, selecting a school that is inclusive of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals is one way to ensure a more positive school experience for themselves and for their children. Parental engagement with schools in terms of volunteering and other forms of involvement, such as being on parent-teacher organizations, allows [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents to be more involved in issues which may concern their child. Parents can access resources that provide information on how parents can facilitate dialogue and collaboration with teachers and schools, enabling them to become proactive advocates of their child's education and school experience.<ref>Kosciw, J.G., & Diaz, E.M. ( 2008). Involved, invisible, ignored: The experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender parents and their children in our nation's K-12 schools. New, NY York: GLSEN</ref>\n\nSchool-based interventions are also effective in improving the experiences of children from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]]. Typically, these interventions target [[school climate]], in particular the aspects which pertain to [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]]. Enforcing [[anti-bullying legislation|anti-bullying]]/harassment policies and laws in schools can protect students from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] from being victims of [[bullying]] and [[harassment]]. Having these policies in place generally allows students to have fewer negative experiences in school, such as a lower likelihood of mistreatment by teachers and other students. Implementing professional development opportunities for school staff on how to provide appropriate support for students from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] will not only facilitate a more positive school experience for students, but will in turn, lead to a more positive [[school climate]] in general. Using an LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum where [[LGBT history|LGBTQ individuals, history and events]] are portrayed in a more positive manner allows students to become more aware and more accepting of LGBTQ-related issues. Specific ways in which [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] matters can be incorporated into the curriculum include: talking about diverse families (e.g. [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]] and [[LGBT families|LGBTQ parents]]), discussing [[LGBT history|LGBTQ history]] (e.g. talking about significant historical events and movements related to the [[LGBT community|LGBTQ community]]), using LGBTQ-inclusive texts in class and celebrating [[List of LGBT events|LGBTQ events]] (e.g. [[LGBT History Month|LGBTQ History Month]] in October or [[LGBT Pride Month|LGBTQ Pride Month]] in June). On top of this, organizing [[LGBT student organizations|LGBTQ student clubs]] (e.g. [[Gay\u2013straight alliance|Gay-Straight Alliances]]) are a positive resource and source of support for students from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]].<ref>Hutton, S.

For example, parents had time to think through how they felt about their child's LGB orientation, and be made aware of how their responses towards their child could potentially reflect attitudes of devaluation. Adolescents that took part in this treatment had fewer suicidal thoughts and fewer depression-related thoughts and feelings. What is especially noteworthy is that these positive gains were sustained for many youth.<ref>Jacobs, J., & Freundlich, M. (2006). Achieving permanency for LGBTQ youth.

The first stable line-up consisted of bandleader [[Brian Jones]] (guitar, harmonica, keyboards), [[Mick Jagger]] (lead vocals, harmonica), [[Keith Richards]] (guitar, vocals), [[Bill Wyman]] (bass guitar), [[Charlie Watts]] (drums), and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued to work with the band as a contracted musician until his death in 1985. The band's primary songwriters, [[Jagger\u2013Richards]], assumed leadership after [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] became the group's manager. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by [[Mick Taylor]]. Taylor left in 1974 and was replaced in 1975 by [[Ronnie Wood]] who has since remained. Since Wyman's departure in 1993, [[Darryl Jones]] has served as touring bassist. The Stones have not had an official keyboardist since 1963, but have employed several musicians in that role, including [[Jack Nitzsche]] (1965\u20131971), [[Nicky Hopkins]] (1967\u20131982), [[Billy Preston]] (1971\u20131981), [[Ian McLagan]] (1978\u20131981), and [[Chuck Leavell]] (1982\u2013present).\n\nThe Rolling Stones were at the forefront of the [[British Invasion]] of bands that became popular in the United States in 1964 and were identified with the youthful and rebellious [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. Rooted in [[blues]] and early [[rock and roll]], the band started out playing covers but found more success with their own material; songs such as \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" and \"[[Paint It Black]]\" became international hits, and ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966) \u2013 their first entirely original album \u2013 has been considered the most important of the band's formative records.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|date=17 May 2018|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/rolling-stones-defining-moments/aftermath-released-1966although-their-first-two-albums--the-roll/|title=Aftermath released, 1966|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=27 November 2018}}</ref> After a short period of experimentation with [[psychedelic rock]] in the mid-1960s, the group returned to its \"bluesy\" roots with ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' (1968), ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' (1969), ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971), and ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972).

The first stable line-up consisted of bandleader [[Brian Jones]] (guitar, harmonica, keyboards), [[Mick Jagger]] (lead vocals, harmonica), [[Keith Richards]] (guitar, vocals), [[Bill Wyman]] (bass guitar), [[Charlie Watts]] (drums), and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued to work with the band as a contracted musician until his death in 1985. The band's primary songwriters, [[Jagger\u2013Richards]], assumed leadership after [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] became the group's manager.

In the film, a [[great white shark|man-eating great white]] shark attacks beachgoers at a summer [[resort town]], prompting police chief [[Martin Brody]] ([[Roy Scheider]]) to hunt it with the help of a [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]) and a professional shark hunter ([[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]]). [[Murray Hamilton]] plays the mayor, and [[Lorraine Gary]] portrays Brody's wife. The screenplay is credited to Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer [[Carl Gottlieb]], who rewrote the script during [[principal photography]].\n\nShot mostly on location on [[Martha's Vineyard]] in [[Massachusetts]], ''Jaws'' had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks often malfunctioned, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the shark's presence, employing an ominous and minimalist theme created by composer [[John Williams]] to indicate its impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of director [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] gave the film what was then an exceptionally [[wide release]] for a [[Major film studio|major studio]] picture, on over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign with a heavy emphasis on television spots and tie-in merchandise.\n\nConsidered one of [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films ever made]], ''Jaws'' was the prototypical summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history, and it won several awards for its music and editing. It was the [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] until the release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' in 1977. Both films were pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which pursues high box-office returns from action and adventure films with simple [[high-concept]] premises, released during the summer in thousands of theaters and heavily advertised. ''Jaws'' was followed by [[Jaws (franchise)|three sequels]], all without Spielberg or Benchley, and many imitative thrillers. In 2001, it was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review WP:FILMPLOT before adding material. Plot summaries, usually for popular films, are set between 400-700 words. -->\nDuring a beach party at dusk on Amity Island, a young woman, Chrissie Watkins, goes [[nude swimming|skinny dipping]] in the ocean. While [[treading water]], she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner's ruling that the death was due to a [[shark attack]] leads police chief Martin Brody to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined and points out that the town has never had trouble with sharks. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly thereafter, with the shark killing a young boy paddling on his raft in full daylight on a crowded beach. A $3000 bounty is placed on the shark by his grieving mother, prompting an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, and confirms her death was caused by a shark\u2014an unusually large one rare to Amity's waters.\n\nWhen local fishermen catch a [[tiger shark]], the mayor proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper however disputes that it is the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable [[great white shark]]'s tooth embedded in the submerged hull. He drops it in fright after encountering the partial corpse of local fisherman Ben Gardner. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's statements that a huge great white shark is responsible for the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank in which the presence of a shark is simulated, the real shark sneaks through and enters a nearby [[estuary]], killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces Vaughn to hire Quint to kill the shark.\n\nQuint, Brody, and Hooper set out on Quint's boat, the ''Orca'', to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a [[Chumming|chum]] line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating its length at {{convert|25|ft|m}} and weight at {{convert|3|t}}, harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.\n\nAt nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars, and Quint reveals that he survived the [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS ''Indianapolis'']]. The shark returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull, and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he pushes the damaged engine past the safety limits and the overtaxed engine fails.\n\nWith the ''Orca'' slowly sinking, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on [[Scuba set|scuba gear]] and enters the water in a [[shark-proof cage]], intending to lethally inject the shark with [[strychnine]], using a hypodermic spear. The shark attacks the cage, causing Hooper to drop the spear, which sinks and is lost. While the shark thrashes in the tangled remains of the cage, Hooper manages to escape to the seabed. The shark escapes and leaps onto the sinking deck of the boat, dragging Quint down and devouring him. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody jams a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion obliterates the shark and then sinks to the bottom. Hooper surfaces, and he and Brody paddle back to Amity Island clinging to the remaining barrels.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Richard D. Zanuck]] and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]], producers at [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], independently heard about Peter Benchley's novel ''[[Jaws (novel)|Jaws]]''. Brown came across it in the literature section of lifestyle magazine ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', then edited by his wife, [[Helen Gurley Brown]]. A small card written by the magazine's book editor gave a detailed description of the plot, concluding with the comment \"might make a good movie\".<ref name=\"Prigg\u00e96\">{{harvnb|Prigg\u00e9|2004|p=6}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Scanlon|2009|p=197}}</ref> The producers each read the book over the course of a single night and agreed the next morning that it was \"the most exciting thing that they had ever read\" and that they wanted to produce a film version, although they were unsure how it would be accomplished.<ref name=jawschap1>{{cite video|first=Laurent|last=Bouzereau|title=A Look Inside Jaws|location=''Jaws'': 30th Anniversary Edition DVD (2005)|year=1995|publisher=Universal Home Video|trans-title=\"From Novel to Script\"}}</ref> They purchased the film rights in 1973, before the book's publication, for approximately $175,000 (equivalent to $990,000 in 2018).<ref name=\"Brode 50\">{{harvnb|Brode|1995|p=50}}</ref> Brown claimed that if had they read the book twice, they would never have made the film because they would have realized how difficult it would be to execute certain sequences.<ref name=\"McBride 231\">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=231}}</ref>\n\nTo direct, Zanuck and Brown first considered veteran filmmaker [[John Sturges]]\u2014whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 included another maritime adventure, ''[[The Old Man and the Sea (1958 film)|The Old Man and the Sea]]''\u2014before offering the job to [[Dick Richards]], whose directorial debut, ''[[The Culpepper Cattle Co.]]'' had come out the previous year.<ref name=\"McBride232\">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=232}}</ref> However, they grew irritated by Richards's habit of describing the shark as a whale and soon dropped him from the project.<ref name=\"McBride232\"/> Meanwhile, [[Steven Spielberg]] very much wanted the job. The 26-year-old had just directed his first theatrical film, ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', for Zanuck and Brown. At the end of a meeting in their office, Spielberg noticed their copy of the still-unpublished Benchley novel, and after reading it was immediately captivated.<ref name=\"Brode 50\"/> He later observed that it was similar to his 1971 television film ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]'' in that both deal with \"these leviathans targeting [[everyman|everymen]]\".<ref name=jawschap1/> He also revealed in \"The Making of ''Jaws''\" documentary on the 2012 DVD release that he directly referenced ''Duel'' by repurposing the sound of the truck being destroyed as the death roar of the shark. After Richards's departure, the producers signed Spielberg to direct in June 1973, before the release of ''The Sugarland Express''.<ref name=\"McBride232\"/>\n\nBefore production began, however, Spielberg grew reluctant to continue with ''Jaws'', in fear of becoming [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as the \"truck and shark director\".<ref name=biskind264/> He wanted to move over to [[20th Century Fox]]'s ''[[Lucky Lady]]'' instead, but Universal exercised its right under its contract with the director to veto his departure.<ref name=\"McBride240\">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=240}}</ref> Brown helped convince Spielberg to stick with the project, saying that \"after [''Jaws''], you can make all the films you want\".<ref name=biskind264/> The film was given an estimated budget of $3.5&nbsp;million and a shooting schedule of 55&nbsp;days.

The character of Quint strongly resembles [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]], the obsessed captain of the ''[[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]]'' who devotes his life to hunting a [[sperm whale]]. Quint's monologue reveals a similar obsession with sharks; even his boat, the ''Orca'', is named after the only [[Orca|natural enemy of the white shark]]. In the novel and original screenplay, Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg, similar to the death of Ahab in Melville's novel.<ref>{{harvnb|Lemkin|1984|pp=277\u2013289}}</ref> A direct reference to these similarities may be found in Spielberg's draft of the screenplay, which introduces Quint watching the [[Moby Dick (1956 film)|film version of ''Moby-Dick'']]; his continuous laughter prompts other audience members to get up and leave the theater. However, the scene from ''Moby-Dick'' could not be licensed from the film's star, [[Gregory Peck]], its copyright holder.<ref name=jawschap1/> Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb also drew comparisons to [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'': \"''Jaws'' is&nbsp;... a titanic struggle, like Melville or Hemingway.\"<ref name=baer209>{{harvnb|Baer|2008|page=209}}</ref>\n\nThe underwater scenes shot from the shark's point of view have been compared with passages in two 1950s horror films, ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' and ''[[The Monster That Challenged the World]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosnan|1978|p=99}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Brosnan|1978|p=129}}</ref> Gottlieb named two science fiction productions from the same era as influences on how the shark was depicted, or not: ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'', which Gottlieb described as \"a great horror film where you only see the monster in the last reel\";<ref name=biskind290>{{harvnb|Biskind|1998|p=290}}</ref> and ''[[It Came From Outer Space]]'', where \"the suspense was built up because the creature was always off-camera\".

When the doctor attempts to convince the townspeople of the danger, he loses his job and is shunned. This plotline is paralleled in ''Jaws'' by Brody's conflict with Mayor Vaughn, who refuses to acknowledge the presence of a shark that may dissuade summer beachgoers from coming to Amity. Brody is vindicated when more shark attacks occur at the crowded beach in broad daylight. Sinyard calls the film a \"deft combination of Watergate and Ibsen's play\".<ref name=\"Sinyard32\"/>\n\n===Scholarly criticism===\n''Jaws'' has received attention from academic critics. Stephen Heath relates the film's ideological meanings to the then-recent [[Watergate scandal]]. He argues that Brody represents the \"white male middle class\u2014[there is] not a single black and, very quickly, not a single woman in the film\", who restores public order \"with an ordinary-guy kind of heroism born of fear-and-decency\".<ref>{{harvnb|Heath|1976|p=510}}</ref> Yet Heath moves beyond ideological content analysis to examine ''Jaws'' as a signal example of the film as \"industrial product\" that sells on the basis of \"the pleasure of cinema, thus yielding the perpetuation of the industry (which is why part of the meaning of ''Jaws'' is to be the most profitable movie)\".<ref>{{harvnb|Heath|1976|p=514}}</ref>\n\nAndrew Britton contrasts the film to the novel's post-Watergate cynicism, suggesting that its narrative alterations from the book (Hooper's survival, the shark's explosive death) help make it \"a communal exorcism, a ceremony for the restoration of ideological confidence.\" He suggests that the experience of the film is \"inconceivable\" without the mass audience's jubilation when the shark is annihilated, signifying the obliteration of evil itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=237}}</ref> In his view, Brody serves to demonstrate that \"individual action by the one just man is still a viable source for social change\".<ref name=Britton239>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=239}}</ref> [[Peter Biskind]] argues that the film does maintain post-Watergate cynicism concerning politics and politicians insofar as the sole villain beside the shark is the town's venal mayor. Yet he observes that, far from the narrative formulas so often employed by [[New Hollywood]] filmmakers of the era\u2014involving Us vs. Them, hip [[counterculture]] figures vs. \"[[The Man]]\"\u2014the overarching conflict in ''Jaws'' does not pit the heroes against authority figures, but against a menace that targets everyone regardless of socioeconomic position.<ref>{{harvnb|Biskind|1998|p=279}}</ref>\n\nWhereas Britton states that the film avoids the novel's theme of social class conflicts on Amity Island,<ref name=Britton239/> Biskind detects class divisions in the screen version and argues for their significance. \"Authority must be restored\", he writes, \"but not by Quint\". The seaman's \"working class toughness and bourgeois independence is alien and frightening&nbsp;... irrational and out of control\". Hooper, meanwhile, is \"associated with technology rather than experience, inherited wealth rather than self-made sufficiency\"; he is marginalized from the conclusive action, if less terminally than Quint.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Biskind |title=''Jaws'': Between the teeth |journal=[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]] |pages=1\u201329 |year=1975|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC09folder/Jaws.html |issue=9}}</ref> Britton sees the film more as concerned with the \"vulnerability of children and the need to protect and guard them\", which in turn helps generate a \"pervasive sense of the supreme value of family life: a value clearly related to [ideological] stability and cultural continuity\".<ref>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=238}}</ref>\n\n[[Fredric Jameson]]'s analysis highlights the [[polysemy]] of the shark and the multiple ways in which it can be and has been read\u2014from representing alien menaces such as communism or the Third World to more intimate dreads concerning the unreality of contemporary American life and the vain efforts to sanitize and suppress the knowledge of death. He asserts that its symbolic function is to be found in this very \"polysemousness which is profoundly ideological, insofar as it allows essentially social and historical anxieties to be folded back into apparently 'natural' ones&nbsp;... to be recontained in what looks like a conflict with other forms of biological existence.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|1979|pp=26\u201327}}</ref> He views Quint's demise as the symbolic overthrow of an old, populist, [[New Deal]] America and Brody and Hooper's partnership as an \"allegory of an alliance between the forces of law-and-order and the new technocracy of the multinational corporations&nbsp;... in which the viewer rejoices without understanding that he or she is excluded from it.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|1979|pp=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\n[[Neal Gabler]] analyzed the film as showing three different approaches to solving an obstacle: science (represented by Hooper), spiritualism (represented by Quint), and the common man (represented by Brody).

In the film, a [[great white shark|man-eating great white]] shark attacks beachgoers at a summer [[resort town]], prompting police chief [[Martin Brody]] ([[Roy Scheider]]) to hunt it with the help of a [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]) and a professional shark hunter ([[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]]). [[Murray Hamilton]] plays the mayor, and [[Lorraine Gary]] portrays Brody's wife. The screenplay is credited to Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer [[Carl Gottlieb]], who rewrote the script during [[principal photography]].\n\nShot mostly on location on [[Martha's Vineyard]] in [[Massachusetts]], ''Jaws'' had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks often malfunctioned, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the shark's presence, employing an ominous and minimalist theme created by composer [[John Williams]] to indicate its impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of director [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] gave the film what was then an exceptionally [[wide release]] for a [[Major film studio|major studio]] picture, on over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign with a heavy emphasis on television spots and tie-in merchandise.\n\nConsidered one of [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films ever made]], ''Jaws'' was the prototypical summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history, and it won several awards for its music and editing. It was the [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] until the release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' in 1977. Both films were pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which pursues high box-office returns from action and adventure films with simple [[high-concept]] premises, released during the summer in thousands of theaters and heavily advertised. ''Jaws'' was followed by [[Jaws (franchise)|three sequels]], all without Spielberg or Benchley, and many imitative thrillers. In 2001, it was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review WP:FILMPLOT before adding material. Plot summaries, usually for popular films, are set between 400-700 words. -->\nDuring a beach party at dusk on Amity Island, a young woman, Chrissie Watkins, goes [[nude swimming|skinny dipping]] in the ocean. While [[treading water]], she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner's ruling that the death was due to a [[shark attack]] leads police chief Martin Brody to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined and points out that the town has never had trouble with sharks. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly thereafter, with the shark killing a young boy paddling on his raft in full daylight on a crowded beach. A bounty is placed on the shark, prompting an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, and confirms her death was caused by a shark\u2014an unusually large one.\n\nWhen local fishermen catch a [[tiger shark]], the mayor proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes that it is the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable [[great white shark]]'s tooth embedded in the submerged hull. He drops it in fright after encountering the partial corpse of local fisherman Ben Gardner. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's statements that a huge great white shark is responsible for the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank in which the presence of a shark is simulated, the real shark enters a nearby [[estuary]], killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces Vaughn to hire Quint.\n\nQuint, Brody, and Hooper set out on Quint's boat, the ''Orca'', to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a [[Chumming|chum]] line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating its length at {{convert|25|ft|m}} and weight at {{convert|3|t}}, harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.\n\nAt nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars, and Quint reveals that he survived the [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS ''Indianapolis'']]. The shark returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull, and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he pushes the damaged engine past the safety limits and the overtaxed engine fails.\n\nWith the ''Orca'' slowly sinking, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on [[Scuba set|scuba gear]] and enters the water in a [[shark-proof cage]], intending to lethally inject the shark with [[strychnine]], using a hypodermic spear. The shark attacks the cage, causing Hooper to drop the spear, which sinks and is lost. While the shark thrashes in the tangled remains of the cage, Hooper manages to escape to the seabed. The shark escapes and leaps onto the sinking deck of the boat, dragging Quint down and devouring him. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody jams a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion obliterates the shark. Hooper surfaces, and he and Brody paddle back to Amity Island clinging to the remaining barrels.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Richard D.

Quint's monologue reveals a similar obsession with sharks; even his boat, the ''Orca'', is named after the only [[Orca|natural enemy of the white shark]]. In the novel and original screenplay, Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg, similar to the death of Ahab in Melville's novel.<ref>{{harvnb|Lemkin|1984|pp=277\u2013289}}</ref> A direct reference to these similarities may be found in Spielberg's draft of the screenplay, which introduces Quint watching the [[Moby Dick (1956 film)|film version of ''Moby-Dick'']]; his continuous laughter prompts other audience members to get up and leave the theater. However, the scene from ''Moby-Dick'' could not be licensed from the film's star, [[Gregory Peck]], its copyright holder.<ref name=jawschap1/> Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb also drew comparisons to [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'': \"''Jaws'' is&nbsp;... a titanic struggle, like Melville or Hemingway.\"<ref name=baer209>{{harvnb|Baer|2008|page=209}}</ref>\n\nThe underwater scenes shot from the shark's point of view have been compared with passages in two 1950s horror films, ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' and ''[[The Monster That Challenged the World]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosnan|1978|p=99}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Brosnan|1978|p=129}}</ref> Gottlieb named two science fiction productions from the same era as influences on how the shark was depicted, or not: ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'', which Gottlieb described as \"a great horror film where you only see the monster in the last reel\";<ref name=biskind290>{{harvnb|Biskind|1998|p=290}}</ref> and ''[[It Came From Outer Space]]'', where \"the suspense was built up because the creature was always off-camera\".

When the doctor attempts to convince the townspeople of the danger, he loses his job and is shunned. This plotline is paralleled in ''Jaws'' by Brody's conflict with Mayor Vaughn, who refuses to acknowledge the presence of a shark that may dissuade summer beachgoers from coming to Amity. Brody is vindicated when more shark attacks occur at the crowded beach in broad daylight. Sinyard calls the film a \"deft combination of Watergate and Ibsen's play\".<ref name=\"Sinyard32\"/>\n\n===Scholarly criticism===\n''Jaws'' has received attention from academic critics. Stephen Heath relates the film's ideological meanings to the then-recent [[Watergate scandal]].

Yet he observes that, far from the narrative formulas so often employed by [[New Hollywood]] filmmakers of the era\u2014involving Us vs. Them, hip [[counterculture]] figures vs. \"[[The Man]]\"\u2014the overarching conflict in ''Jaws'' does not pit the heroes against authority figures, but against a menace that targets everyone regardless of socioeconomic position.<ref>{{harvnb|Biskind|1998|p=279}}</ref>\n\nWhereas Britton states that the film avoids the novel's theme of social class conflicts on Amity Island,<ref name=Britton239/> Biskind detects class divisions in the screen version and argues for their significance. \"Authority must be restored\", he writes, \"but not by Quint\". The seaman's \"working class toughness and bourgeois independence is alien and frightening&nbsp;... irrational and out of control\". Hooper, meanwhile, is \"associated with technology rather than experience, inherited wealth rather than self-made sufficiency\"; he is marginalized from the conclusive action, if less terminally than Quint.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Biskind |title=''Jaws'': Between the teeth |journal=[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]] |pages=1\u201329 |year=1975|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC09folder/Jaws.html |issue=9}}</ref> Britton sees the film more as concerned with the \"vulnerability of children and the need to protect and guard them\", which in turn helps generate a \"pervasive sense of the supreme value of family life: a value clearly related to [ideological] stability and cultural continuity\".<ref>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=238}}</ref>\n\n[[Fredric Jameson]]'s analysis highlights the [[polysemy]] of the shark and the multiple ways in which it can be and has been read\u2014from representing alien menaces such as communism or the Third World to more intimate dreads concerning the unreality of contemporary American life and the vain efforts to sanitize and suppress the knowledge of death. He asserts that its symbolic function is to be found in this very \"polysemousness which is profoundly ideological, insofar as it allows essentially social and historical anxieties to be folded back into apparently 'natural' ones&nbsp;... to be recontained in what looks like a conflict with other forms of biological existence.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|1979|pp=26\u201327}}</ref> He views Quint's demise as the symbolic overthrow of an old, populist, [[New Deal]] America and Brody and Hooper's partnership as an \"allegory of an alliance between the forces of law-and-order and the new technocracy of the multinational corporations&nbsp;... in which the viewer rejoices without understanding that he or she is excluded from it.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|1979|pp=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\n[[Neal Gabler]] analyzed the film as showing three different approaches to solving an obstacle: science (represented by Hooper), spiritualism (represented by Quint), and the common man (represented by Brody).
