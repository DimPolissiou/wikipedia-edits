It was released as a [[Double album|double]] [[Compact disc|CD]] in 1996, through [[Young God Records]]. ''Soundtracks for the Blind'' was intended, as suggested by the title, to function as a sort of \"soundtrack for a non-existent film\", and is Swans' most varied studio effort.\n\nA [[reissue]] of the album was released on July 20, 2018, marking the first time ''Soundtracks for the Blind'' was released on [[Phonograph record|vinyl]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://younggodrecords.com/products/soundtracks-2018|title=Soundtracks For The Blind (Remastered 2018) PREORDER|website=YOUNG GOD RECORDS|access-date=2018-05-22}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nMuch of the album is tied together with audio collage works and sample-based textural pieces recorded at various times and places, as well as the use of previous Swans material (such as the lyrics of \"Your Property\" from ''[[Cop (album)|Cop]]'' for \"YRP\"). On this, frontman Michael Gira said in 1997:\n\n<blockquote>I've always been interested in different sounds like that and listened to [[Brian Eno]] and different kinds of music that use non-musical sources often, and as I made this record I had a lot of that material: those loops and things I'd made from '81; I had vocal loops that Jarboe had made in 1985 on a little sixteen second digital delay unit which was actually the first sampler... we had these tape narrations we'd been collecting, that she got from her father's desk when he was an FBI agent \u2013 surveillance tapes; I interviewed my father because I'm interested in his life, and took a little snippet of his experiences... then we had new things we'd recorded with our 'band' from the last tour; and some stuff we did for a soundtrack for a film. I threw all those into the computer and assembled it that way. So, in some things, there's something from 1981 playing simultaneously with something from '85 playing simultaneously with something from 1996. It's cross-faded and blended and mixed so to speak in the computer, cut-up and sometimes looped and reversed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://younggodrecords.com/press/98-swans/1426-swans-m-gira-interview |title=Swans <nowiki>| M.

There\u2019s some contemporary recordings of the band as it existed in \u201896/7, with Larry Mullins on drums/percussion, Jarboe singing and playing keyboards, Vudi playing electric guitar, and Joe Goldring playing bass and electric guitar, and me singing and playing electric and acoustic guitar, but there\u2019s also a huge amount of sounds and recordings that I (and a few by Jarboe here too) collected over the years. These are reassembled, looped, mangled, and in many cases overdubbed upon to create new pieces of music. Being the \u201cartist\u201d in this case, it\u2019s hard for me to talk about this one, because the memory is so laden (or burdened!) with the experience of making this thing. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say here is I almost had a heart attack making it (slightly kidding here). It was just overwhelming. I really set my own trap, dug my own grave on this one. There was SO MUCH material to deal with, to sift through (whole trunks full of decomposing, moldy cassettes and discs with samples and sounds), and the task of making it into something coherent was at times debilitating. Really like climbing up a mountain of sand. I don\u2019t remember why I set this goal for myself, to somehow incorporate such a ridiculously disparate amount of material. I think maybe it was so I could justify throwing all that crap into the local dump, which is what I did when I finished the album. But in the end, after centuries of picking at this huge iceberg of material with a toothpick, my trusty engineer Chris Griffin and I managed to sculpt something out of it. It actually breathes, seems to live, in most places I think. There\u2019s a press release below written by Kurt at Atavistic (Swans label at the time), and some reviews too, which might give you a better idea of how this sounds. Anyway, in the end, I was elated with this music, both because I liked it and because finishing it meant I could finally lay Swans to rest after 15 years. In my case, I\u2019m always happiest when I\u2019m leaving.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://younggodrecords.com/collections/swans/products/soundtracks-for-the-blind |title=Soundtracks for the Blind <nowiki>| M.

It was released as a [[Double album|double]] [[Compact disc|CD]] in 1996, through [[Young God Records]]. ''Soundtracks for the Blind'' was intended, as suggested by the title, to function as a sort of \"soundtrack for a non-existent film\", and is Swans' most varied studio effort.\n\nA [[reissue]] of the album was released on July 20, 2018, marking the first time ''Soundtracks for the Blind'' was released on [[Phonograph record|vinyl]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://younggodrecords.com/products/soundtracks-2018|title=Soundtracks For The Blind (Remastered 2018) PREORDER|website=YOUNG GOD RECORDS|access-date=2018-05-22}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nMuch of the album is tied together with audio collage works and sample-based textural pieces recorded at various times and places, as well as the use of previous Swans material (such as the lyrics of \"Your Property\" from ''[[Cop (album)|Cop]]'' for \"YRP\"). On this, frontman Michael Gira said in 1997:\n\n<blockquote>I've always been interested in different sounds like that and listened to [[Brian Eno]] and different kinds of music that use non-musical sources often, and as I made this record I had a lot of that material: those loops and things I'd made from '81; I had vocal loops that Jarboe had made in 1985 on a little sixteen second digital delay unit which was actually the first sampler... we had these tape narrations we'd been collecting, that she got from her father's desk when he was an FBI agent \u2013 surveillance tapes; I interviewed my father because I'm interested in his life, and took a little snippet of his experiences... then we had new things we'd recorded with our 'band' from the last tour; and some stuff we did for a soundtrack for a film. I threw all those into the computer and assembled it that way. So, in some things, there's something from 1981 playing simultaneously with something from '85 playing simultaneously with something from 1996. It's cross-faded and blended and mixed so to speak in the computer, cut-up and sometimes looped and reversed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://younggodrecords.com/press/98-swans/1426-swans-m-gira-interview |title=Swans <nowiki>| M.

There\u2019s some contemporary recordings of the band as it existed in \u201896/7, with Larry Mullins on drums/percussion, Jarboe singing and playing keyboards, Vudi playing electric guitar, and Joe Goldring playing bass and electric guitar, and me singing and playing electric and acoustic guitar, but there\u2019s also a huge amount of sounds and recordings that I (and a few by Jarboe here too) collected over the years. These are reassembled, looped, mangled, and in many cases overdubbed upon to create new pieces of music. Being the \u201cartist\u201d in this case, it\u2019s hard for me to talk about this one, because the memory is so laden (or burdened!) with the experience of making this thing. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say here is I almost had a heart attack making it (slightly kidding here). It was just overwhelming. I really set my own trap, dug my own grave on this one. There was SO MUCH material to deal with, to sift through (whole trunks full of decomposing, moldy cassettes and discs with samples and sounds), and the task of making it into something coherent was at times debilitating. Really like climbing up a mountain of sand. I don\u2019t remember why I set this goal for myself, to somehow incorporate such a ridiculously disparate amount of material. I think maybe it was so I could justify throwing all that crap into the local dump, which is what I did when I finished the album. But in the end, after centuries of picking at this huge iceberg of material with a toothpick, my trusty engineer Chris Griffin and I managed to sculpt something out of it. It actually breathes, seems to live, in most places I think. There\u2019s a press release below written by Kurt at Atavistic (Swans label at the time), and some reviews too, which might give you a better idea of how this sounds. Anyway, in the end, I was elated with this music, both because I liked it and because finishing it meant I could finally lay Swans to rest after 15 years. In my case, I\u2019m always happiest when I\u2019m leaving.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://younggodrecords.com/collections/swans/products/soundtracks-for-the-blind |title=Soundtracks for the Blind <nowiki>| M.
