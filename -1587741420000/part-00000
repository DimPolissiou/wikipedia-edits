He completed his PhD at the University of Western Australia in 1983 on continental shelf sedimentation.\n\n==Career==\n\nProf. Collins started at Curtin, then the WA Institute of Technology, in 1971 as a Lecturer in Geology. He gained his PhD in 1983 and became the Geology coordinator in the Department of Geology and Geophysics in 1984. In 1988 Prof. Collins was made a Senior Lecturer in Geology (Sedimentology), an Associate Professor in 1993 and in 2009 was made a Professor of Sedimentary and Marine Geology in the Department of Applied Geology. Lindsay was Head of Department from 1999-2005 and continued to teach the 2nd and 3rd year sedimentology course and lead the 3rd year field trip during his tenure as Head. During his time as head Lindsay was a key figure in the development of the department\u2019s Double Degrees. Collins' research interests at Curtin included continental shelf sedimentology and substrate mapping, the coral reefs of the Western Australian continental margin, clastic and carbonate petroleum reservoirs, coastal mapping for management using GIS, sea level change, Tertiary limestone deposition and evolution, stromatolites, and warm and cool water carbonates.

Hired after the death of Mrs Landingham (Seasons 4\u20137). Charlie arranges for her first interview with the President, where she is groggy from prescription medication and behaves ridiculously, and pushes successfully for her to be re-considered afterwards. When President Bartlet learns the reason she lost her previous White House job\u2014she defied the Director of Personnel by hiring Charlie rather than a wealthy Bartlet supporter's unqualified son\u2014and sees she is actually very smart and capable (if still odd), he hires her on the spot.\n* Margaret Hooper (NiCole Robinson): Assistant to Chiefs of Staff [[Leo McGarry]] (Seasons 1\u20136) and [[C. J. Cregg]] (Seasons 6\u20137). She is visibly pregnant in Season 6, with no clear information about the father, and her baby is never seen on the show.

Described by Josh Lyman as \"smart and tough\".\n* Ainsley Hayes ([[Emily Procter]]): Associate (and proposed Deputy) White House Counsel (Seasons 2\u20133). Conservative Republican from North Carolina. Graduate of Harvard Law School. After she soundly defeats and embarrasses Sam during a debate on the political talk show ''Capital Beat'', President Bartlet tells Leo McGarry to offer her a job, which she initially thinks is either a joke or a terrible idea, but seeing the staff in action leads her to accept the Associate White House Counsel's post. Briefly reappears in Season 7, wanting to become White House Counsel for the Santos Administration with Josh planning on getting her a meeting with Santos.\n* Joe Quincy ([[Matthew Perry]]): Associate White House Counsel (Seasons 4\u20135). Republican. Uncovers Vice President Hoynes's leaking of information during an affair with local socialite Helen Baldwin, ultimately leading to Hoynes' resignation. He is later tasked by Toby to find out if the ailing Chief Justice would be willing to resign, which he has strong ethical objections about doing because he clerked for the Chief Justice and reveres him despite their polar opposite political views, but does what Toby asked him to.\n* Mike Wayne ([[Benjamin Brown (actor)|Benjamin Brown]]): Associate White House Counsel (Season 4\u20137). Is consulted by Toby and Josh in regards to dealing with a chemical company executive (who is Toby's former roommate) who wants to revise his written testimony to the House Committee on Natural Resources and seeks [[whistleblower]] protection, who Wayne reveals to the dismayed senior staffers is guilty of crimes and has to be granted immunity, leading Toby to later bitterly \"praise\" his old roommate and friend for making sure to have gotten himself out of legal trouble after his cowardice led to huge suffering for others.

Appears in episode (2.05) berating C.J. for reprimanding his intentions to criticize the President on TV before his retirement, but is left silent when C.J. tells him he is wearing a Distinguished Combat Service Medal he had not earned; President Bartlet, however, later says the General served his country bravely and would face no White House censorship of any of his views. Despite being identified as Army Chief of Staff, he is portrayed as a three-star [[lieutenant general]].\n* General Mitch Jensen&nbsp;(Christopher Kriesa): A three-star Army general. Present in the Situation Room during discussions of retaliatory options to Morris Tollivers' USAF medical transport being shot down in episode (1.03).

Later a contender for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2006 election, though he never appeared on screen in that capacity.\n\n=== State governors ===\n* Eric Baker&nbsp;([[Ed O'Neill]]): Governor of Pennsylvania. Widely tipped as a front runner for the Democratic nomination for president in 2006, Baker's surprise decision not to run at the outset leaves the race wide open. When the convention is deadlocked, Baker enters the race from the floor as a [[Draft (politics)|draft candidate]], but withdraws over fallout due to the discovery of his non-disclosure of his wife's [[clinical depression|depression]]. Nominated for vice president by President Santos following the death of Leo McGarry.\n* [[Robert Ritchie (TV character)|Robert Ritchie]]&nbsp;([[James Brolin]]): Governor of Florida.

Former British [[High Commissioner]] to [[India]]. Considered an expert on the [[Indian subcontinent]], known for: his colorful and flamboyant personality; purposely mistaking [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Leo McGarry]] for the White House [[butler]], as well as calling him 'Gerald'; and outwardly flirting with [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Abigail Bartlet]]. (Ep. 1.11; 1.12; 2.12; 3.16; 6.14)\n* [[Defense Minister]] Abdul ibn Shareef of [[Qumar]]&nbsp;(Al No'mani): Brother of the Sultan and terrorist leader, assassinated by the United States. (Ep. 3.22)\n\n== Campaign staff ==\n* Bruno Gianelli&nbsp;([[Ron Silver]]): A sharp political operative and consultant introduced in the third season as the campaign manager of Bartlet's 2002 bid for reelection, and continues in this role through the fourth season. His unmatched track record of victories includes a House district that no Democrat has won for decades, several different U.S. senators and state governors, as well as a win for an unspecified [[Israel]]i prime minister. The character reappears as Eric Baker's campaign manager for the 2006 Democratic primary, only to become an independent consultant to Republican nominee Arnold Vinick after Baker withdraws from the race. The change of political affiliations mirrored Ron Silver's real-world change of party affiliation, as the noted liberal actor campaigned for President [[George W. Bush]] in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]].\n* Josephine \"Joey\" Lucas&nbsp;([[Marlee Matlin]]): A political consultant and pollster who is often hired by the White House and Democratic campaigns. Usually her interactions with Bartlet or Matt Santos are arranged by Josh Lyman, who has a crush on her early on. However, their relationship remains platonic and professional. Lucas first appears in the first season as the hard-hitting, sarcastic campaign manager for a Democratic House candidate whom the White House does not take seriously. She is then contracted to conduct a secret poll to determine whether the American public would accept the president's [[multiple sclerosis|MS]]. Like Matlin, Lucas is deaf.\n* Kenny Thurman&nbsp;([[Bill O'Brien (actor)|Bill O'Brien]]): Joey Lucas's [[American Sign Language|sign language]] interpreter (Seasons 1\u20137).\n* Connie Tate&nbsp;([[Connie Britton]]): Bartlet-Hoynes re-election campaign staffer (Season 3); a likable woman who quickly befriends Sam Seaborn. Often wins points by smoothing feathers ruffled by her acerbic co-worker Doug Wegland.\n* Doug Wegland&nbsp;([[Evan Handler]]): Bartlet-Hoynes re-election campaign staffer and speechwriter  (Season 3); he's acerbic and finds himself offside with Toby Ziegler, but ends up winning the staffers' respect with his good ideas and staunch belief in them (particularly his push for a presidential veto on the \"death tax\" that leads to a major political victory for the administration).\n* Kevin Kahn&nbsp;([[Patrick Breen]]): Former friend of Sam Seaborn. Staffer on Ritchie's 2002 presidential campaign (Season 3), who ends up humiliating Sam by leaking an attack ad that makes the Bartlet campaign look vindictive and stupid.\n* Dylan Clark&nbsp;([[Tim Kelleher (actor)|Tim Kelleher]]): Hoynes' campaign manager (Season 6).\n\n=== Santos campaign ===\n* Louise \"Lou\" Thornton&nbsp;([[Janeane Garofalo]]): an intelligent [[lobbyist]] described by Santos as having a \"completely different take on the campaign\" and by Josh as knowing \"image stuff backwards and sideways\", she only reluctantly agrees to Josh's request to join the Santos-McGarry campaign as Director of Communications, when Santos agrees she can report to him directly. Very tough and experienced, she successfully argues that many loyal Santos campaign operatives are not up to snuff and gets them cut loose, and later tells Josh she has run Democratic campaigns that destroyed the careers of smart, well-intentioned Republican candidates because (as she says) they're still the GOP and the enemy of what she believes is right. With Josh considering her to have enough campaign experience to potentially replace him as Campaign Manager, she acts as Josh's [[de facto]] deputy through to the very end, and at Josh's persuasion, accepts her appointment as Santos's Director of Communications (Season 7).\n* Ronna Beckman&nbsp;(Karis Campbell): Santos's personal assistant. She is present from the very beginning of [[Matt Santos]]'s campaign for the presidency in season 6 (appearing as part of his Congressional staff), and appears in almost every episode in season 7, as Lou considers her work good enough to continue. In one episode, she mentions that she regards Josh, Annabeth and Lou as her only friends, which Lou claims makes Ronna more pathetic than herself (who hasn't spoken to any of her friends in two months) or Annabeth (who believes she doesn't have friends anymore). In her final appearance, [[Deborah Fiderer]] trains her as Santos's executive secretary, warning her never to revoke the First Lady's walk-in privileges, even as the President is certain to request it. She has a relationship with another female staffer (Cindy) on the [[Matt Santos|Santos]] campaign.\n* Edie Ortega&nbsp;([[Diana-Maria Riva]]): Santos-McGarry Deputy Campaign Manager for Strategic Planning (Season 7).\n* Lester&nbsp;([[Cress Williams]]): Santos-McGarry Campaign Consultant (Season 7).\n* Bram Howard&nbsp;([[Matthew Del Negro]]): Staffer, Santos-McGarry Campaign (Seasons 6\u20137); Santos Administration counselor to the President (Season 7). Moves into Charlie Young's former office on Inauguration Day.\n* Ned Carlson&nbsp;([[Evan Arnold]]): A day-one aide to Congressman Santos (Season 6); Staffer, Santos-McGarry Campaign (Seasons 6\u20137). Has somewhat of an adversarial relationship with Lou, who highlights Ned as a staffer who is not up to the demands of a national campaign and says he needs to go precisely because he's a trusted assistant to Santos. Ned is reassigned by Josh to Santos's Congressional office early in Season 7 with the intention of giving him a spot in the administration after the election. Ned angrily tells off Josh and it's left unclear if he's quit the entire campaign or not. He does not appear after his demotion takes place.\n* Otto&nbsp;(Ramon De Ocampo): Speechwriter, Santos-McGarry Campaign (Season 7); Staffer in the Santos Administration (Season 7). Very young but capable man who has a campaign fling with Lou Thornton. Josh irrationally vents his post-election stress and anger at Otto, who is saved when Sam Seaborn shuts Josh's behavior down permanently; it is implied he will have a speechwriting role in the Santos Administration.\n\n=== Vinick campaign ===\n* Sheila Brooks&nbsp;([[Patricia Richardson]]): Senator Vinick's chief of staff and Vinick-Sullivan campaign manager; She, like Vinick, is portrayed as level-headed and not overtly partisan. Often at odds with the more conservative voices in the party, she leaves the campaign weeks before election day to placate the Republican base (Season 6\u20137). In her final appearance, Brooks is mentioned as possibly being hired as Chief of Staff to the Republican Senate Majority Leader. Having renewed her friendship with Vinick, she makes an argument that convinces the Senator that he shouldn't run for president again\u2014and that he should accept President-elect Santos' offer to become the next Secretary of State.\n* Jane Braun&nbsp;([[Melinda McGraw]]): Vinick-Sullivan campaign manager after Brooks' resignation (Season 7); A far to the right conservative activist who replaces Sheila in order to energize hard-core GOP voters. However, she disgusts the rest of the campaign leadership by attempting to make an election night issue of Leo McGarry's death. Her outspoken partisanship puts her at odds with Vinick, Sheila, and Bruno Gianelli.\n* Bruno Gianelli&nbsp;([[Ron Silver]]): (See [[#Campaign staff|above]]).\n* Bob Mayer&nbsp;([[Stephen Root]]): Vinick-Sullivan speechwriter (Season 6\u20137). Frequently mocked for his messy eating habits but extremely smart and effective (and, like Vinick and Sheila Brooks, level-headed in his conservatism), Mayer becomes fast friends with Gianelli. On election night, the two briefly discuss forming a consulting firm when Mayer firmly declares he is never going to become involved in daily governance, but Gianelli politely declines because the campaign life has worn him down and he plans to retire to his home in upstate New York. Along with Sheila, Bob advises Vinick to accept Santos' offer as the next Secretary of State.\n\n== Media ==\n* Danny Concannon; ([[Timothy Busfield]]): senior White House [[correspondent]] for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (Seasons 1\u20132, 4\u20135, 7).\n* Greg Brock&nbsp;([[Sam Robards]]): White House correspondent for ''[[The New York Times]]''.

Writes a story that alleges the existence of a classified military space shuttle which could be used to help three astronauts on the International Space Station who are running out of oxygen. His source is initially suspected to be C. J. Cregg, whose phone records show a surprisingly large number of calls to Greg Brock. Brock goes to jail after being held in contempt of court for failing to reveal the name of his source. White House Communications Director Toby Ziegler eventually confesses to the leak, saying that he acted alone, and that Brock was the only reporter to whom he leaked the information. The storyline regarding the leak and subsequent investigation has been compared by some to the [[Plame affair|Valerie Plame affair]].<ref>Clabby, Consuela, [http://www.smrt-tv.com/v2-04/feature_westwing.html \"Leaky Politics: ''The West Wing'' versus The Bush Administration\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206014745/http://www.smrt-tv.com/v2-04/feature_westwing.html |date=2012-02-06 }}, SMRT-TV. 31 October 2005.</ref><ref>\"[http://www.footnote.tv/ftvww133i.html#leakinvestigation 'The Ticket': Leak Investigation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416003309/http://www.footnote.tv/ftvww133i.html |date=2008-04-16 }}\" FootnoteTV. 25 September 2005.</ref> (Seasons 5\u20137).\n* Roger Salier&nbsp;(Ivan Allen): Television anchor on News Center 4 (Seasons 1\u20137).\n* Mark Gottfried&nbsp;([[Ted McGinley]]): Talk show host of ''Capital Beat'' (Episodes 2.04, 2.13 & 2.14).\n* Diane Mathers&nbsp;(Kathrin Middleton): Tough talk show host who interviews [[Zoey Bartlet]] about her kidnapping and [[John Hoynes]] about his intentions to run for president again (Episodes 5.07 & 6.07).\n* Taylor Reid&nbsp;([[Jay Mohr]]): Conservative talk show host, baits C.

Later a contender for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2006 election, though he never appeared on screen in that capacity.\n\n=== State governors ===\n* Eric Baker&nbsp;([[Ed O'Neill]]): Governor of Pennsylvania. Widely tipped as a front runner for the Democratic nomination for president in 2006, Baker's surprise decision not to run at the outset leaves the race wide open. When the convention is deadlocked, Baker enters the race from the floor as a [[Draft (politics)|draft candidate]], but withdraws over fallout due to the discovery of his non-disclosure of his wife's [[clinical depression|depression]]. Nominated for vice president by President Santos following the death of Leo McGarry.\n* [[Robert Ritchie (TV character)|Robert Ritchie]]&nbsp;([[James Brolin]]): Governor of Florida.

Former British [[High Commissioner]] to [[India]]. Considered an expert on the [[Indian subcontinent]], known for: his colorful and flamboyant personality; purposely mistaking [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Leo McGarry]] for the White House [[butler]], as well as calling him 'Gerald'; and outwardly flirting with [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Abigail Bartlet]]. (Ep. 1.11; 1.12; 2.12; 3.16; 6.14)\n* [[Defense Minister]] Abdul ibn Shareef of [[Qumar]]&nbsp;(Al No'mani): Brother of the Sultan and terrorist leader, assassinated by the United States. (Ep. 3.22)\n\n== Campaign staff ==\n* Bruno Gianelli&nbsp;([[Ron Silver]]): A sharp political operative and consultant introduced in the third season as the campaign manager of Bartlet's 2002 bid for reelection, and continues in this role through the fourth season. His unmatched track record of victories includes a House district that no Democrat has won for decades, several different U.S. senators and state governors, as well as a win for an unspecified [[Israel]]i prime minister. The character reappears as Eric Baker's campaign manager for the 2006 Democratic primary, only to become an independent consultant to Republican nominee Arnold Vinick after Baker withdraws from the race. The change of political affiliations mirrored Ron Silver's real-world change of party affiliation, as the noted liberal actor campaigned for President [[George W. Bush]] in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]].\n* Josephine \"Joey\" Lucas&nbsp;([[Marlee Matlin]]): A political consultant and pollster who is often hired by the White House and Democratic campaigns. Usually her interactions with Bartlet or Matt Santos are arranged by Josh Lyman, who has a crush on her early on. However, their relationship remains platonic and professional. Lucas first appears in the first season as the hard-hitting, sarcastic campaign manager for a Democratic House candidate whom the White House does not take seriously. She is then contracted to conduct a secret poll to determine whether the American public would accept the president's [[multiple sclerosis|MS]]. Like Matlin, Lucas is deaf.\n* Kenny Thurman&nbsp;([[Bill O'Brien (actor)|Bill O'Brien]]): Joey Lucas's [[American Sign Language|sign language]] interpreter (Seasons 1\u20137).\n* Connie Tate&nbsp;([[Connie Britton]]): Bartlet-Hoynes re-election campaign staffer (Season 3); a likable woman who quickly befriends Sam Seaborn. Often wins points by smoothing feathers ruffled by her acerbic co-worker Doug Wegland.\n* Doug Wegland&nbsp;([[Evan Handler]]): Bartlet-Hoynes re-election campaign staffer and speechwriter  (Season 3); he's acerbic and finds himself offside with Toby Ziegler, but ends up winning the staffers' respect with his good ideas and staunch belief in them (particularly his push for a presidential veto on the \"death tax\" that leads to a major political victory for the administration).\n* Kevin Kahn&nbsp;([[Patrick Breen]]): Former friend of Sam Seaborn. Staffer on Ritchie's 2002 presidential campaign (Season 3), who ends up humiliating Sam by leaking an attack ad that makes the Bartlet campaign look vindictive and stupid.\n* Dylan Clark&nbsp;([[Tim Kelleher (actor)|Tim Kelleher]]): Hoynes' campaign manager (Season 6).\n\n=== Santos campaign ===\n* Louise \"Lou\" Thornton&nbsp;([[Janeane Garofalo]]): an intelligent [[lobbyist]] described by Santos as having a \"completely different take on the campaign\" and by Josh as knowing \"image stuff backwards and sideways\", she only reluctantly agrees to Josh's request to join the Santos-McGarry campaign as Director of Communications, when Santos agrees she can report to him directly. Very tough and experienced, she successfully argues that many loyal Santos campaign operatives are not up to snuff and gets them cut loose, and later tells Josh she has run Democratic campaigns that destroyed the careers of smart, well-intentioned Republican candidates because (as she says) they're still the GOP and the enemy of what she believes is right. With Josh considering her to have enough campaign experience to potentially replace him as Campaign Manager, she acts as Josh's [[de facto]] deputy through to the very end, and at Josh's persuasion, accepts her appointment as Santos's Director of Communications (Season 7).\n* Ronna Beckman&nbsp;(Karis Campbell): Santos's personal assistant. She is present from the very beginning of [[Matt Santos]]'s campaign for the presidency in season 6 (appearing as part of his Congressional staff), and appears in almost every episode in season 7, as Lou considers her work good enough to continue. In one episode, she mentions that she regards Josh, Annabeth and Lou as her only friends, which Lou claims makes Ronna more pathetic than herself (who hasn't spoken to any of her friends in two months) or Annabeth (who believes she doesn't have friends anymore). In her final appearance, [[Deborah Fiderer]] trains her as Santos's executive secretary, warning her never to revoke the First Lady's walk-in privileges, even as the President is certain to request it. She has a relationship with another female staffer (Cindy) on the [[Matt Santos|Santos]] campaign.\n* Edie Ortega&nbsp;([[Diana-Maria Riva]]): Santos-McGarry Deputy Campaign Manager for Strategic Planning (Season 7).\n* Lester&nbsp;([[Cress Williams]]): Santos-McGarry Campaign Consultant (Season 7).\n* Bram Howard&nbsp;([[Matthew Del Negro]]): Staffer, Santos-McGarry Campaign (Seasons 6\u20137); Santos Administration counselor to the President (Season 7). Moves into Charlie Young's former office on Inauguration Day.\n* Ned Carlson&nbsp;([[Evan Arnold]]): A day-one aide to Congressman Santos (Season 6); Staffer, Santos-McGarry Campaign (Seasons 6\u20137). Has somewhat of an adversarial relationship with Lou, who highlights Ned as a staffer who is not up to the demands of a national campaign and says he needs to go precisely because he's a trusted assistant to Santos. Ned is reassigned by Josh to Santos's Congressional office early in Season 7 with the intention of giving him a spot in the administration after the election. Ned angrily tells off Josh and it's left unclear if he's quit the entire campaign or not. He does not appear after his demotion takes place.\n* Otto&nbsp;(Ramon De Ocampo): Speechwriter, Santos-McGarry Campaign (Season 7); Staffer in the Santos Administration (Season 7). Very young but capable man who has a campaign fling with Lou Thornton. Josh irrationally vents his post-election stress and anger at Otto, who is saved when Sam Seaborn shuts Josh's behavior down permanently; it is implied he will have a speechwriting role in the Santos Administration.\n\n=== Vinick campaign ===\n* Sheila Brooks&nbsp;([[Patricia Richardson]]): Senator Vinick's chief of staff and Vinick-Sullivan campaign manager; She, like Vinick, is portrayed as level-headed and not overtly partisan. Often at odds with the more conservative voices in the party, she leaves the campaign weeks before election day to placate the Republican base (Season 6\u20137). In her final appearance, Brooks is mentioned as possibly being hired as Chief of Staff to the Republican Senate Majority Leader. Having renewed her friendship with Vinick, she makes an argument that convinces the Senator that he shouldn't run for president again\u2014and that he should accept President-elect Santos' offer to become the next Secretary of State.\n* Jane Braun&nbsp;([[Melinda McGraw]]): Vinick-Sullivan campaign manager after Brooks' resignation (Season 7); A far to the right conservative activist who replaces Sheila in order to energize hard-core GOP voters. However, she disgusts the rest of the campaign leadership by attempting to make an election night issue of Leo McGarry's death. Her outspoken partisanship puts her at odds with Vinick, Sheila, and Bruno Gianelli.\n* Bruno Gianelli&nbsp;([[Ron Silver]]): (See [[#Campaign staff|above]]).\n* Bob Mayer&nbsp;([[Stephen Root]]): Vinick-Sullivan speechwriter (Season 6\u20137). Frequently mocked for his messy eating habits but extremely smart and effective (and, like Vinick and Sheila Brooks, level-headed in his conservatism), Mayer becomes fast friends with Gianelli. On election night, the two briefly discuss forming a consulting firm when Mayer firmly declares he is never going to become involved in daily governance, but Gianelli politely declines because the campaign life has worn him down and he plans to retire to his home in upstate New York. Along with Sheila, Bob advises Vinick to accept Santos' offer as the next Secretary of State.\n\n== Media ==\n* Danny Concannon; ([[Timothy Busfield]]): senior White House [[correspondent]] for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (Seasons 1\u20132, 4\u20135, 7).\n* Greg Brock&nbsp;([[Sam Robards]]): White House correspondent for ''[[The New York Times]]''.

Writes a story that alleges the existence of a classified military space shuttle which could be used to help three astronauts on the International Space Station who are running out of oxygen. His source is initially suspected to be C. J. Cregg, whose phone records show a surprisingly large number of calls to Greg Brock. Brock goes to jail after being held in contempt of court for failing to reveal the name of his source. White House Communications Director Toby Ziegler eventually confesses to the leak, saying that he acted alone, and that Brock was the only reporter to whom he leaked the information. The storyline regarding the leak and subsequent investigation has been compared by some to the [[Plame affair|Valerie Plame affair]].<ref>Clabby, Consuela, [http://www.smrt-tv.com/v2-04/feature_westwing.html \"Leaky Politics: ''The West Wing'' versus The Bush Administration\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206014745/http://www.smrt-tv.com/v2-04/feature_westwing.html |date=2012-02-06 }}, SMRT-TV. 31 October 2005.</ref><ref>\"[http://www.footnote.tv/ftvww133i.html#leakinvestigation 'The Ticket': Leak Investigation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416003309/http://www.footnote.tv/ftvww133i.html |date=2008-04-16 }}\" FootnoteTV. 25 September 2005.</ref> (Seasons 5\u20137).\n* Roger Salier&nbsp;(Ivan Allen): Television anchor on News Center 4 (Seasons 1\u20137).\n* Mark Gottfried&nbsp;([[Ted McGinley]]): Talk show host of ''Capital Beat'' (Episodes 2.04, 2.13 & 2.14).\n* Diane Mathers&nbsp;(Kathrin Middleton): Tough talk show host who interviews [[Zoey Bartlet]] about her kidnapping and [[John Hoynes]] about his intentions to run for president again (Episodes 5.07 & 6.07).\n* Taylor Reid&nbsp;([[Jay Mohr]]): Conservative talk show host, baits C.

The programme examined the deaths of three [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) members in [[Gibraltar]] on 6 March 1988 at the hands of the British [[Special Air Service]] (codenamed \"[[Operation Flavius]]\"). \"Death on the Rock\" presented evidence that the IRA members were shot without warning or while attempting to surrender. It was condemned by the British government, while [[tabloid journalism|tabloid newspapers]] denounced it as sensationalist. \"Death on the Rock\" subsequently became the first individual documentary to be the subject of an independent inquiry, in which it was largely vindicated.\n\nThe project began after it emerged that the three IRA members shot in Gibraltar were found to be unarmed and not in possession of a bomb. The series' editor, [[Roger Bolton (producer)|Roger Bolton]], dispatched journalists to Gibraltar and Spain, where they interviewed several people who witnessed the shootings as well as Spanish police officers who had been involved in surveillance of the IRA team. The journalists also filmed the funerals of the IRA members in [[Belfast]]. Satisfied by the journalists' findings, Bolton sought a conclusion to the programme; as the British government refused to comment, Bolton recruited a leading human rights lawyer to give his opinion on the findings. The documentary was broadcast on 28 April 1988 (just under two months after the shootings), despite two attempts by [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Sir Geoffrey Howe]] to have the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] postpone the broadcast. Using the eyewitness statements, the documentary questioned the government's version of events, and suggested that the three IRA members may have been unlawfully killed. Reporter Julian Manyon summed up the programme's findings: none of the witnesses interviewed for the programme heard the soldiers challenge the trio before opening fire, but variously believed they had seen the IRA members shot in the back, with their hands up, or after falling to the ground. The final contributor was the lawyer recruited by Bolton, who suggested that a judicial inquiry was necessary to resolve the conflicts.\n\nThe morning after the broadcast, several tabloid newspapers attacked the documentary, accusing it of sensationalism and \"trial by television\".<ref name=\"Eckert 138\"/> In the following days, they mounted a campaign against [[Carmen Proetta]], one of the documentary's main witnesses, accusing her of being a former prostitute and of being anti-British; Proetta later successfully sued several newspapers for [[defamation|libel]]. Other newspapers accused \"Death on the Rock\" of misrepresenting the eyewitnesses' statements and criticised the IBA for allowing the documentary to be broadcast. The eyewitnesses interviewed for \"Death on the Rock\" gave evidence at the inquest into the shootings; most repeated the statements they had given the programme, but one witness\u2014who had told the programme he had seen a soldier stand over one of the IRA members and fire at the man while he was on the ground\u2014retracted his previous statement. As a result of the retraction, Thames commissioned an independent inquiry into the making of \"Death on the Rock\"\u2014the first time an inquiry had been commissioned into the making of an individual documentary. The Windlesham\u2013Rampton report found that the programme's tendency was to present evidence that the IRA members had been unlawfully killed, but that it sought to raise questions rather than to reach a conclusion. The authors made several criticisms of the documentary, but overall found it a \"trenchant\" work of journalism, made in \"good faith and without ulterior motives\".<ref name=\"WR 144\"/> Thames lost its franchise and the IBA was abolished as a result of the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]]\u2014decisions which several involved parties believed were influenced by the government's anger at \"Death on the Rock\".\n\n==Background==\n===''This Week''===\n''This Week'' was a current affairs television series that began in 1956. In 1978, it was renamed ''TV Eye'' and took on a slightly lighter format; the title ''This Week'' was restored in 1986, after which it became steadily more journalistic. The programme was broadcast simultaneously across the [[ITV regions]] and became a mainstay of ITV's current affairs programming. By 1988, the programme had interviewed several prime ministers and leaders of the opposition, including [[Margaret Thatcher]] (the incumbent prime minister), who had been interviewed for three full episodes.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 15\u201317.</ref>\n\n===Gibraltar shootings===\n{{main|Operation Flavius}}\nOn 6 March 1988, three members of an IRA [[Active Service Unit]]\u2014[[Daniel McCann]], [[Mairead Farrell]], and [[Sean Savage]]\u2014were witnessed parking a car in a car park in [[Gibraltar]]; the car park was used as an assembly area for British soldiers preparing for the weekly \"changing of the guard\" ceremony outside [[The Convent (Gibraltar)|the Convent]] (the residence of the governor of Gibraltar). The three were suspected by the British authorities of being part of a plot to detonate a car bomb in the car park while it was full of soldiers preparing for the ceremony; while the suspects were walking back towards the Spanish border, they were shot dead by British soldiers, members of the [[Special Air Service]]. In the immediate aftermath of the shootings, the British government released a statement to the effect that a large car bomb had been found in Gibraltar, and that three suspected terrorists had been shot dead by the [[Gibraltar Police]].<ref name=\"Eckert 88\">Eckert, p. 88.</ref> That evening, British television news reported the finding of the alleged car bomb, and added that the IRA members had been involved in a \"shootout\" with authorities. All of Britain's daily newspapers covered the shootings the following morning, several of which cited the size of the alleged car bomb as {{convert|500|lb|kg}} and claimed that it was \"packed with shrapnel\". The same morning, [[Ian Stewart, Baron Stewartby|Ian Stewart]], [[Minister of State for the Armed Forces]], told [[BBC Radio 4]] that \"military personnel were involved\" in the shootings, and that \"a car bomb was found, which has been defused\".<ref>Eckert, pp. 86\u201387.</ref>\n\nThe following day, [[Sir Geoffrey Howe]], the British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|foreign secretary]], made a statement to the House of Commons regarding the shootings, in which he informed the house that the IRA members were unarmed, and that the car parked in the assembly area did not contain an explosive device. Howe stated that the IRA members \"made movements which led the military personnel, operating in support of the Gibraltar Police, to conclude that their own lives and the lives of others were under threat\". \"In light of this response\", Howe continued, \"they were shot\" by \"military personnel, operating in support of the Gibraltar Police\".<ref name=\"Eckert 88\"/> Subsequent inquiries led to the discovery of a large quantity of explosives in [[Marbella]] ({{convert|50|mi|km}} from Gibraltar), along with detonators and timers.<ref>Crawshaw & Holmstr\u00f6m, p. 92.</ref>\n\n==Investigation==\n''This Week''{{'s}} editor, [[Roger Bolton (producer)|Roger Bolton]], initially believed there was little merit in investigating the shootings. Based on the official account of events that was presented in the immediate aftermath of the shootings, Bolton believed that most people would think the IRA members \"deserved what they got\".<ref>Eckert, p. 87.</ref> Bolton's interest was piqued by Howe's statement, and the revelation in it that the deceased were unarmed and were not in possession of a bomb. Shortly afterwards, he dispatched two of ''This Week''{{'}}s journalists, Julian Manyon and Chris Oxley, to Gibraltar and Spain (respectively) to gather more information on the shootings.<ref>Eckert, p. 89.</ref> Bolton believed that the [[Milltown Cemetery attack]] and the [[corporals killings]], two events in Belfast which resulted from the Gibraltar killings, provided \"even more compelling reasons\" to investigate the shootings; the team considered switching the focus of the programme to the effects the shootings had in Belfast, but decided to continue with the original project.<ref>Bolton, pp. 203, 205.</ref>\n\n===Gibraltar===\n[[File:Gib Oil Winston Churchil Avenue 1.jpg|thumb|The petrol station on [[Winston Churchill Avenue]] where two of the three IRA members were shot|alt=A petrol station forecourt viewed from across the road]]\nAfter ten days' investigation, Oxley was surprised to learn that the Gibraltar Police were handling the police investigation into the shootings, having been closely involved in the events leading up to them. He also grew concerned that the police investigation was insufficiently rigorous when he learned that the police had not taken statements from residents whose flats overlooked the scene of Farrell's and McCann's deaths. The Gibraltar coroner, Felix Pizzarello, welcomed ''This Week''{{'}}s investigation, telling Oxley that he hoped the journalists would uncover witnesses who could assist the inquest.<ref>Eckert, p. 119.</ref> While Oxley was investigating the shootings from Gibraltar, Manyon travelled to Madrid in an attempt to learn more about the surveillance operation which took place in Spain prior to the shootings. Bolton added Alison Cahn to the team on 18 March; her task was to visit the flats which overlooked the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot, with the aim of interviewing any residents who might have witnessed the events of 6 March.<ref name=\"Eckert 119\">Eckert, pp. 119\u2013120.</ref> After several days' work, the team found two eyewitnesses to the shootings who were willing to speak on camera: Stephen Bullock, a local lawyer who had witnessed the events while out for a walk with his wife; and Josie Celecia, a housewife who had seen the shooting of McCann and Savage from her apartment window. Both witnesses' statements appeared to the journalists to be inconsistent with the official account of the shootings.<ref>Eckert, pp. 120\u2013123.</ref>\n\nThe journalists quickly decided they needed expert advice on ballistics and explosives, to which end they engaged Lieutenant Colonel [[George Styles (military officer)|George Styles]], [[George Cross|GC]], a retired British Army officer who had served as a bomb-disposal officer in Northern Ireland during [[the Troubles]]. Styles arrived in Gibraltar on 23 March, and immediately went to inspect the car park where Savage had parked the white Renault on the day of the shootings, after which he walked through the town along what the journalists believed was the IRA members' most likely route. When asked his opinion by the journalists, Styles cast doubt on the authorities' stated reasons for the shootings. He explained to the journalists that, had Savage's white Renault contained a substantial bomb, the weight would have been evident on the vehicle's springs. Styles also felt that the potential bomb was unlikely to have been detonated with a remote detonator on account of the buildings between the scenes of the shootings and the likelihood that it would be drowned out by other radio signals in the area. Finally, the journalists asked Styles to examine the scenes of the shootings, including ricochet marks that the soldiers' bullets had left on the pumps at the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot.<ref>Eckert, p. 124.</ref>\n\nAs Styles was examining the ricochet marks, Alison Cahn was approached by an elderly woman, who led Cahn to a nearby apartment building. There, the woman introduced Cahn to her daughter\u2014Carmen Proetta\u2014who told Cahn that she had witnessed the shooting at the petrol station; although initially reluctant, she was persuaded by Cahn to give her account of the events in an affidavit. Proetta asserted that, immediately before McCann and Farrell were shot, she saw a police car travelling north on [[Winston Churchill Avenue]] with its siren activated; as she watched, the police car stopped abruptly and four men\u2014one uniformed police officer and three men in civilian clothes\u2014jumped out. She stated that the three men in plain clothes, all carrying pistols, leapt across the central reservation barrier, at which point she saw McCann and Farrell raise their hands. Proetta believed that all three men then opened fire, while McCann and Farrell had their hands in the air, and that neither suspect made any movements towards their clothing or Farrell's handbag. She went on to state that she witnessed one of the men crouch over McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, and continue to shoot them.<ref>Eckert, pp. 125\u2013126.</ref> According to Styles, Proetta's account of the shooting tallied with the bullet marks he examined at the petrol station; he also found her description of the bullets striking the bodies particularly convincing, believing that only somebody who had witnessed such an event would be able to describe it so vividly. The journalists also discovered that Proetta's account of the soldiers arriving in a police car matched some of the newspaper reports from the day after the shootings.<ref>Eckert, p. 127.</ref><ref>Bolton, p. 16.</ref>\n\nBy the end of March, Cahn had traced two further witnesses to the shootings\u2014Diana Treacy, who claimed to have seen the soldiers shooting Savage in the back without warning and continuing to shoot him while he was on the ground, and Kenneth Asquez, who had provided a hand-written, unsigned statement, but was extremely reluctant to be filmed or named as a witness. He had come to the attention of the journalists through another witness, who provided Cahn with a video recording of the aftermath of the shootings.<ref>Eckert, pp. 128\u2013129.</ref> The journalists approached the witness through a second intermediary\u2014Christopher Finch, a local lawyer who had been assisting them as a consultant\u2014and received a typed but unsigned affidavit. In both documents, Asquez stated that he had been a passenger in a car that was passing the scene of Savage's shooting on 6 March; he described seeing Savage lying on the ground with a soldier standing over him, and witnessing the soldier shoot Savage \"two or three times at point-blank range\" while the latter was on the ground.<ref name=\"Eckert 130\">Eckert, p. 130.</ref> The journalists failed to persuade Asquez to sign his affidavit, but decided to incorporate it into the programme nonetheless.<ref name=\"Eckert 130\"/>\n\n===Spain===\nJulian Manyon arrived in Madrid on 11 March, and shortly afterwards engaged Henry Debelius, a journalist and American expatriate, as an interpreter and consultant for the programme. Within days, the two men wrote to the Spanish police headquarters to request information from the authorities and assistance in reconstructing the surveillance operation that preceded the shootings as the IRA team travelled through Spain.<ref name=\"Eckert 119\"/> Ten days later, they met with a spokesman for the [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Spanish interior ministry]], who confirmed that the Spanish authorities had tracked the three IRA members throughout their time in Spain. The Spanish surveillance operation included multiple cars following the suspects' vehicle, periodically \"leap-frogging\" each other to avoid attracting attention; use of a helicopter to track the team's movements; constant radio communication between the officers involved and police headquarters; and officers monitoring the suspects' movements at fixed observation posts. The spokesman also told the men that the Spanish kept the British authorities constantly apprised of the IRA team's movements, and that the British were aware of Savage's arrival at the Gibraltar border, and allowed the white Renault he was driving to enter the territory.<ref>Eckert, pp. 127\u2013128.</ref><ref>Williams, p. 36.</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nAs well as the investigation in Gibraltar and Spain, ''This Week'' conducted some of the filming for \"Death on the Rock\" in Northern Ireland. Its journalists filmed the funeral of McCann, Savage, and Farrell; while there, Manyon took the opportunity to interview [[Gerry Adams]], leader of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], who refused to confirm that the three were planning a bomb attack on Gibraltar. The team decided against using Adams' interview, and only 45 seconds of the footage was used in the final cut.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 19\u201320.</ref> The journalists were keen to show the potential impact of a bomb like the one the IRA had planned to explode in Gibraltar; they initially hoped to film a controlled explosion of a bomb of similar size, but no private contractor would conduct such an experiment without government approval. In lieu of filming an explosion, ''This Week'' interviewed Noreen Hill\u2014whose husband was left in a coma as a result of a smaller [[Remembrance Day bombing|bombing in Enniskillen]] in November 1987\u2014to \"depict the human tragedy of IRA bombings\".<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 121.</ref> They also filmed an interview with a second survivor of the Enniskillen bombing, which was not included in the final cut.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 122.</ref>\n\n==Conclusion==\n[[File:Geoffrey Howe.jpg|thumb|[[Sir Geoffrey Howe]], then Foreign Secretary, twice attempted to have the programme postponed.|alt=A white-haired man in a grey suit and tie]]\nBased on the information his journalists had gathered from eyewitnesses in Gibraltar and that provided by the Spanish authorities, Bolton believed his team had enough to broadcast a documentary about the Gibraltar shootings. The journalists filmed those eyewitnesses who were willing to speak on camera. They also rented a helicopter, and\u2014with the assistance of the Spanish authorities, who provided two police officers who had taken part in the operation\u2014filmed a reconstruction of the Spanish surveillance operation.<ref>Eckert, p. 128.</ref><ref>Williams, p. 17.</ref>\n\nThroughout the investigation, the authorities in Britain and Gibraltar refused to provide any information or to comment on the journalists' findings. Thus, ''This Week'' were unable to present their conclusions to a member of the government and broadcast their reaction, as was the usual practice for closing such a documentary. In place of such a conclusion, Bolton approached [[George Carman]]\u2014a leading London lawyer specialising in human rights issues\u2014who agreed to be interviewed for the programme.<ref name=\"Eckert, p. 131\">Eckert, p. 131.</ref>{{refn|On 21 April, a week before the programme was due to be broadcast, Manyon met with a [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) spokesman and a British Army public relations officer, in a final, unsuccessful, attempt to include an official statement from the government.<ref>Eckert, p. 135.</ref>|group=\"note\"}}\n\nOn 26 April, two days before \"Death on the Rock\" was due to air, the British government intervened to prevent its broadcast. Howe telephoned [[George Thomson, Baron Thomson of Monifieth|Lord Thomson]], chair of the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA), to request he force the postponement of the broadcast on the grounds that Howe feared the documentary might prejudice the coroner's inquest. Thomson personally viewed \"Death on the Rock\" before making the final decision to permit its broadcast, with two alterations to the commentary.{{refn|The IBA felt that the first version of the commentary suggested too strongly that the inquest would be inadequate and that the Gibraltar Police were unreliable; both concerns were addressed before the IBA approved the programme.<ref>Bolton, p. 228.</ref>|group=\"note\"}} He later wrote that, \"paradoxically\", the decision \"was not a difficult one. My colleagues and I saw no reason why the IBA should prevent Thames' journalists interviewing those who claimed to be eyewitnesses and investigating the affair as numerous other journalists had since the shootings, provided that the criminal record of the terrorists and the enormity of the outrage they planned was made clear and the legal position had been established to our satisfaction\".<ref>Eckert, pp. 135\u2013136.</ref><ref>Bolton, pp. 228, 232.</ref> With a slightly altered rationale\u2014that the documentary could contaminate witness evidence at the inquest\u2014Howe again attempted to prevent the programme's broadcast on the day it was due to be shown; after taking further legal advice, the IBA upheld its decision to permit the showing of \"Death on the Rock\".<ref>Eckert, p. 136.</ref>\n\n==Broadcast==\nFinal editing of the programme was still under way while the IBA was considering Howe's requests, causing Bolton to worry that it would not be completed in time. The editing was eventually finished just ten minutes before the documentary was due to air. \"Death on the Rock\" was ultimately broadcast in the United Kingdom on schedule, at 21:00 on 28 April 1988, six weeks after the shootings.<ref name=\"Bolton 235\"/><ref>Eckert, p. 137.</ref>\n\n[[File:Renault 5 Saga.jpg|thumb|A white [[Renault 5]], similar to that driven into Gibraltar by Sean Savage|alt=A white Renault car in a car park]]\nThe programme opened with excerpts from two of the interviews prior to the title sequence, followed by an introduction from [[Jonathan Dimbleby]], who told viewers that the evidence presented in the programme was \"of critical importance for those who wish to find out what really happened in Gibraltar last month\".<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 30.</ref> The commentary cut to Manyon, who introduced Styles and discussed the impact the IRA's bomb would have had, and then to Noreen Hill, whose husband was in a coma as a result of the Enniskillen bombing. Manyon pointed out that the IRA expressed regret after Enniskillen, but that they were by then already planning to attack Gibraltar.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 30\u201333.</ref> Manyon told viewers of the three IRA members' backgrounds, before introducing an interview with an official from the Spanish Interior Ministry, who discussed the Spanish surveillance operation,<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 33\u201337.</ref> of which viewers were shown a reconstruction with a voice-over from Manyon.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 45\u201346.</ref> The programme reconstructed Savage's movements as he crossed the border into Gibraltar, parked his car in the assembly area for the ceremony and met up with McCann and Farrell, after which it broadcast part of Howe's statement to the House of Commons: \"Their presence and actions near the parked Renault car gave rise to strong suspicion that it contained a bomb, which appeared to be corroborated by a rapid technical examination of the car\".<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 47\u201348.</ref> Manyon explained that the vehicle was later found not to contain a bomb, and introduced Styles, who believed that such an examination would have shown that the car did not contain a bomb, as the weight would have been evident on the vehicle's springs.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 49.</ref>\n\nManyon continued to narrate as the programme reconstructed the IRA team's movements through Gibraltar towards the border until McCann and Farrell reached a petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue. \"Then, suddenly\", Manyon told viewers, \"shots rang out, and in less than a minute all three terrorists were dead\u2014shot by the SAS\". The commentary again cut to Howe's statement, after which Manyon detailed ''This Week''{{'s}} investigation. He introduced the four eyewitnesses the journalists had discovered (Diana Treacy, Josie Celecia, Stephen Bullock, and Carmen Proetta). Celecia described witnessing McCann and Farrell walking along Winston Churchill Avenue before hearing several shots, and then seeing a soldier continue to fire at the pair while they were on the ground. Proetta told the programme she saw a police car arrive opposite the petrol station, that three armed men in plain clothes then disembarked, jumped across the central barrier, and shot McCann and Farrell while the latter had their hands up.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 50\u201353.</ref> Bullock was interviewed walking the route he had walked on the day of the shootings; his account was of two men in plain clothes shooting McCann and Farrell at very close range and continuing to shoot as the pair fell and while they were on the ground. Treacy, meanwhile, was walking along Landport Lane when Savage ran past her, pursued by at least one soldier. She stated that she did not hear any warning before Savage was shot; she ran away after the shooting began. Asquez was not named in the broadcast; his statement\u2014that he saw a soldier firing at Savage while the latter was on the ground\u2014was read out by an actor.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 54\u201359.</ref>\n\nStyles told Manyon he believed it unlikely that the IRA would have succeeded in detonating a bomb in the assembly area from the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot (a distance of approximately {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}). Returning to Proetta, the documentary heard her reaction to Howe's statement that McCann and Farrell made threatening movements; Proetta believed that the incident was triggered by the siren from the police car on Winston Churchill Avenue. She believed that any movements McCann and Farrell made were in response to the siren, and was adamant that the pair had their hands up when they were shot.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 60\u201363.</ref> Manyon summed up the programme's findings:\n*no independent witnesses heard a challenge,\n*Proetta believed McCann and Farrell were shot with their hands up,\n*Treacy saw Savage shot in the back,\n*two witnesses claimed to have seen the IRA members \"finished off\" on the ground,\n*Styles believed the authorities should have known the car did not contain a bomb.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 65\u201366.</ref>\n\nCarman, the QC recruited by Bolton, was the last contributor to the documentary. Presented with ''This Week''{{'s}} evidence, he disagreed with Margaret Thatcher's statement that the inquest would be sufficient to establish the facts of the incident. He opined that a more powerful judicial enquiry, possibly headed by a British [[High Court of England and Wales|High Court]] judge, would be better equipped to eliminate the inconsistencies between the official version of events and the eyewitness statements. In conclusion, Manyon asked Carman \"do you believe this case is so important that the government should take such extraordinary steps in order to clarify the facts?\" Carman responded \"the programme indicates there are serious, important public issues involved, and speaking as a lawyer, one is always anxious when there is contest on the facts in such important areas, they should be properly and efficiently investigated\".<ref name=\"Eckert, p. 131\"/><ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 67.</ref> The documentary closed with Jonathan Dimbleby:\n<blockquote>\nThat report was made, as you may have detected, without the cooperation of the British government, which says it will make no comment until the inquest.\n\nAs our film contained much new evidence hitherto unavailable to the coroner, we are sending the transcripts to his court in Gibraltar, where it's been made clear to us that all such evidence is welcomed.\n\nFrom ''This Week'', goodnight.<ref name=\"Bolton 235\">Bolton, p. 235.</ref><ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 68.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Reaction==\nThe controversy surrounding \"Death on the Rock\" was \"unsurpassed\" in Lord Thomson's experience.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 72.</ref> The morning after the broadcast, the British [[Broadsheet#United Kingdom broadsheets|broadsheet]]s appeared open-minded or moderately favourable to ''This Week''; ''[[The Times]]'' told readers that \"Death on the Rock\" \"seemed a significant, thoroughly responsible and serious examination of a most disturbing case\" and that it \"simply raised serious questions and suggested they needed deep examination\".<ref>Eckert, pp. 137\u2013138.</ref><ref name=Windlesham69>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 69.</ref> The [[Tabloid (newspaper format)#Types|tabloids]], however, berated the programme and its makers. ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' accused the makers of a \"cheap scoop\" and labelled the programme \"IRA propaganda\".<ref name=\"Eckert 138\">Eckert, p. 138.</ref> The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' was equally robust; its main headline read \"fury over SAS 'trial by TV'\", while in an inside article, it called the programme \"woefully one-sided\",<ref name=Windlesham69/> and accused Bolton of having previously collaborated with the IRA for sensational news stories.<ref name=\"Eckert 138\"/><ref name=\"Bolton 237\">Bolton, p. 237.</ref>{{refn|Bolton later successfully sued the ''Mail'' for libel.<ref name=\"Bolton 237\"/>|group=\"note\"}} That evening, Bolton agreed to appear on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Right to Reply]]'', a show which allowed ordinary viewers to question the makers of controversial television programmes; the programme was pre-recorded, and, unusually, the producers agreed to cut the end of the recording after one of the participants\u2014a former member of Margaret Thatcher's personal staff claiming to be an impartial viewer\u2014launched an attack on Bolton, in which he accused Bolton of associating with terrorists.<ref>Eckert. pp. 139\u2013140.</ref><ref>Bolton, pp. 238\u2013239.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the days after the broadcast of \"Death on the Rock\", the British tabloid press mounted a campaign against Carmen Proetta, one of the documentary's key witnesses. The day after the broadcast, the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' printed a story about Proetta's husband; the piece\u2014citing the Gibraltar Police press officer\u2014claimed that Maxie Proetta was a drug smuggler well known to the Gibraltar Police. Over the course of the week, several of the tabloids ran stories claiming that Carmen Proetta ran an escort agency and that she was a former prostitute with a criminal record; in one headline, ''The Sun'' labelled her \"the tart of Gib\".<ref>Eckert, p. 141.</ref><ref name=\"Williams 24\">Williams, pp. 24\u201325.</ref> Several stories also attempted to portray Proetta as anti-British, including one in the broadsheet ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' which claimed she was one of the 44 people who voted to end the British administration in [[1967 Gibraltar sovereignty referendum|Gibraltar's 1967 referendum]].<ref>Eckert, pp. 140\u2013142.</ref> In fact, Proetta had served briefly as a director of a Spanish tour company and had no criminal record in either Spain or Gibraltar; her husband had been convicted for drug possession in Spain and was, at the time of the shootings, facing separate charges for allowing his boat to be used by drug smugglers. Proetta later sued ''The Sun'' and other newspapers for libel and won substantial damages.<ref name=\"Williams 24\"/><ref>Eckert, pp. 142, 149.</ref><ref>Bolton, pp. 240\u2013241.</ref><ref name=\"indy\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/sudden-death-and-the-long-quest-for-answers-1603189.html|title=Sudden death and the long quest for answers|last=Mills|first=Heather|date=28 September 1995|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Sunday Times]]'' attempted to undermine the programme's credibility with its own investigative journalism. Citing \"official sources\", the paper told its readers that ''This Week''{{'}}s account of the shootings was \"crucially flawed\", and \"bore no resemblance to what happened\". It went on to claim that several of the programme's witnesses felt that \"Death on the Rock\" had misrepresented their statements. It stated that the documentary's technical advisor, Lieutenant Colonel George Styles, was aggrieved that two of his \"key opinions\" had been omitted from the version broadcast\u2014specifically that what Proetta interpreted as a gesture of surrender may have been an involuntary reaction to the bullets striking the suspects' bodies, and that the IRA members could still have detonated a bomb in another vehicle parked on the Spanish side of the border. The latter opinion was omitted because the ''This Week'' team saw little for the IRA to gain by detonating a bomb on Spanish soil, while the former was included in the broadcast. Josie Celecia, it alleged, had dismissed Proetta's account as \"ridiculous\", while Stephen Bullock had contradicted Proetta's statement that she had seen plain-clothed soldiers arriving in a police car\u2014testimony ''The Sunday Times'' believed \"destroyed\" Proetta's evidence. Both witnesses complained in letters to other newspapers. Through these, it emerged that Bullock had dismissed only one detail in Proetta's evidence as \"ridiculous\", while he and Proetta had been referring to two distinct police cars in their statements.{{refn|Bullock did observe one inaccuracy in \"Death on the Rock\": that he was reported as saying he had not heard the soldiers shout a warning to McCann and Farrell, when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not.<ref>Eckert, p. 147.</ref>|group=\"note\"}}<ref>Eckert, pp. 145\u2013147.</ref> ''The Sunday Times'' omitted Styles' belief that the shootings were a pre-emptive attack. Styles' view was one of \"two active service units waging war [...] taking [the IRA members] out quickly, cleanly, and without other people being hurt{{refn|Styles was apparently unaware that one passer-by was grazed by a ricocheting bullet.<ref>Eckert, p. 149.</ref>|group=\"note\"}}\u2014that seems to be the only way\".<ref>Eckert, p. 148.</ref>{{refn|Three ''Sunday Times'' journalists later wrote letters to other publications to complain that their copy was distorted by sub-editors.<ref>Bolton, p. 290.</ref>|group=\"note\"}} Several newspapers were critical of the IBA's decision to allow the documentary to be broadcast.<ref>Williams, p. 38.</ref>\n\n==Inquest==\nThe witnesses uncovered during the production of \"Death on the Rock\" appeared at the inquest, which began on 6 September.<ref>Eckert, p. 166.</ref> One of the first civilians to give evidence was Allen Feraday, an explosives expert who worked for the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD); he confirmed Styles' contribution to the documentary\u2014that the IRA had not been known to use a remote-detonated bomb without a direct line of sight to their target. The various expert witnesses at the inquest disagreed as to whether a detonation signal could have reached the parked Renault from the scenes of the shootings.<ref>Eckert, pp. 215\u2013220.</ref> Multiple eyewitnesses gave evidence over the course of the inquest. Four gave evidence which broadly supported the official version of events; in particular, none saw the soldiers shoot McCann, Savage, or Farrell while they were on the ground. The witnesses from \"Death on the Rock\" also appeared. Stephen Bullock told the coroner that he saw McCann and Savage raise their hands before seeing the SAS shoot them at point-blank range. Josie Celecia's evidence\u2014that she saw a soldier shooting at McCann and Farrell while the pair were on the ground\u2014was stringently challenged by government lawyers, who pointed out that her account had changed somewhat since she had appeared on camera and that she was unable to identify the SAS soldiers from photographs taken by her husband.<ref>Eckert, p. 223.</ref>{{refn|Douglas Celecia handed his photographs to the Gibraltar Police.

He told the coroner that he had witnessed four men (three in plain clothes and one uniformed Gibraltar Police officer) arriving opposite the petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue; the men jumped over the central reservation barrier and Farrell put her hands up, after which he heard a series of shots. In contrast to his wife's testimony, he believed that Farrell's gesture was one of self-defence rather than surrender, and he believed that the shots he heard did not come from the men from the police car. The government lawyers suggested that the police car he and his wife had seen was one seen by other eyewitnesses further south, and that it was responding to the shootings rather than transporting soldiers, but Mr Proetta was adamant that the lawyers' suggestion did not make sense. Carmen Proetta appeared the following day. Mrs Proetta's testimony contained some discrepancies with the evidence she gave to \"Death on the Rock\"; she was no longer certain that she had seen the SAS shoot McCann and Savage while the latter were on the ground, because she could not recall seeing shell casings being ejected from the soldiers' weapons. The government lawyers questioned the reliability of Proetta's evidence based on her changes, and implied that she behaved suspiciously by giving evidence to \"Death on the Rock\" before the police. She responded that the police had not spoken to her about the shootings until after \"Death on the Rock\" had been shown.<ref>Eckert, pp. 226\u2013227.</ref> Asquez, who provided an unsworn statement to the programme through an intermediary, reluctantly appeared at the inquest. He retracted the statements he had given to the journalists, which he claimed he had made up after \"pestering\" from Major Bob Randall (who had sold the programme a video recording of the aftermath of the shootings).{{refn|Randall was on holiday abroad at the time of the inquest, having been advised by the Gibraltar Police that he would not be needed. Upon his return, he strongly denied putting any pressure on Asquez.<ref>Eckert, p. 232.</ref>|group=\"note\"}} The British tabloids covered Asquez's retraction extensively, while several members of parliament accused \"Death on the Rock\" of manipulating Asquez in an attempt to discredit the SAS and the British government. However, Asquez's statement contained several details that were not released publicly, and which only entered the public domain during the inquest, though, when questioned by the coroner, Asquez said he could not explain the discrepancy because he was \"a bit confused\".<ref>Eckert, pp. 230\u2013233.</ref> The inquest concluded on 30 September and the jury returned a verdict of lawful killing.<ref>Eckert, p. 235.</ref>\n\nFollowing the inquest, the families of McCann, Savage, and Farrell applied to the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] for an opinion on whether the authorities' actions in Gibraltar violated Article 2 (the \"right to life\") of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR);<ref name=\"Eckert 286\">Eckert, pp. 286\u2013287.</ref> ''This Week''{{'s}} journalists provided statements to the commission regarding the Spanish surveillance operation (the existence of which had been denied by the British authorities at the inquest).

Nevertheless, the applicants' claim for damages was dismissed on the grounds that the trio had been killed while preparing an act of terrorism, though it did order the government to pay the applicants' costs.<ref name=\"Eckert 286\"/>\n\n==Windlesham\u2013Rampton Report==\nFollowing Asquez's retraction of his statement and his allegation that he was pressured into giving a false account of the events he witnessed, the IBA contacted Thames to express its concern and to raise the possibility of an investigation into the making of the documentary. Thames eventually agreed to commission an independent inquiry into the programme (the first such inquiry into an individual programme), to be conducted by two people with no connection to either Thames or the IBA; to that end, Thames engaged [[David Hennessy, 3rd Baron Windlesham|Lord Windlesham]] and [[Richard Rampton]],&nbsp;QC.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 3\u20134.</ref> Windlesham was a Conservative politician, privy councillor, and former minister in the [[Home Office]] and then the [[Northern Ireland Office]]; he also had experience of television journalism, having previously managed two television companies. Rampton was a leading barrister specialising in media law and libel.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, back cover.</ref><ref>Bolton, pp. 275\u2013276.</ref> The inquiry's terms of reference were \"to inquire into the making and screening of 'Death on the Rock'\", including its creation, production, content, and any effect it had had on the inquest.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 4.</ref>\n\nThe report found that the tendency of the evidence presented in the programme was to suggest the terrorists had been unlawfully killed, and that it did not explore alternative explanations in any depth. Nevertheless, Windlesham and Rampton believed that the programme presented evidence for one possible explanation, but sought to raise questions rather than reach a conclusion. In analysing the content of the programme, they found that it allowed the witnesses to give their accounts in their own words rather than presenting them as established fact. Thus, they found that the content did not infringe any requirement for neutrality. The report scrutinised in detail the statements of the eyewitnesses who spoke on camera, including the parts of the interviews that were not included in the broadcast version of the programme. It found, with two exceptions, that the witnesses' statements were fairly represented in the programme. The exceptions were that the programme suggested that Bullock had not heard a warning, when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not; and that the commentary implied that all four witnesses who appeared on the programme had seen no threatening movements from the IRA members, when only two had been asked whether they witnessed such movements.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 105\u2013106.</ref> Windlesham and Rampton also considered Asquez's statement and the journalists' decision to incorporate it into the programme.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 70\u201372.</ref> The report considered that the journalists acted reasonably in using the statement, despite Asquez's refusal to sign it, on the grounds that Asquez had given two separate, near-identical statements (including one to a lawyer), and that they considered it unlikely that somebody would invent such a dramatic account. Nonetheless, the report criticised the programme for not informing viewers of Asquez's refusal to sign the statement.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 101\u2013102.</ref>\n\nThe [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] (FCO) made representations to the inquiry that \"Death on the Rock\" could potentially have had an adverse effect on the inquest on the same grounds that Howe had attempted to delay the broadcast. The first was that the programme might have been seen by members of the inquest jury, and could thus have caused them to reach a conclusion on the shootings before hearing the evidence at the inquest. Considering this submission, the report agreed with the opinions of lawyers consulted by Thames and the IBA that \"Death on the Rock\" was safe to be broadcast on 28 April 1988. The report considered that Thames withheld distribution of \"Death on the Rock\" from Gibraltar and Spain specifically to address such concerns, though it was widely discussed in British newspapers (which are widely sold in the territory) and extracts later became available in Gibraltar. The report concluded it was foreseeable that the content of \"Death on the Rock\" would become known in Gibraltar, but that it would not have prejudiced potential jurors as, in the authors' opinion, the programme raised one possibility, but did not seek to present it as the only possible version of events.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 111\u2013113.</ref> The second was that the programme might have contaminated the evidence presented at the inquest, as witnesses might have been tempted to give false or embellished accounts for the television.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 118.</ref> The report dismissed this concern; the authors believed that all the eyewitnesses gave honest accounts of what they believed they saw, and pointed out that three had given statements to the Gibraltar Police and two had been interviewed by Gibraltarian and British newspapers prior to being interviewed for \"Death on the Rock\".<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 121\u2013122.</ref>\n\nOverall, Windlesham and Rampton found \"Death on the Rock\" to be a \"trenchant\" work of journalism, made in \"good faith and without ulterior motives\".<ref name=\"WR 144\">Windlesham & Rampton, p. 144.</ref> In conclusion, the authors believed that \"Death on the Rock\" proved that \"freedom of expression can prevail in the most extensive, and the most immediate, of all the means of mass communication\".<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 145.</ref>\n\nThe terms of reference of the report did not invite any recommendations, nor did the authors offer any.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 141.</ref>\n\n==Impact==\n\"Death on the Rock\" was highly praised within the television industry and went on to win the [[BAFTA Award for Best Documentary]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1989/television/flaherty-documentary-award|title=Flaherty Documentary Award in 1989|publisher=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref> and an award from the [[Broadcasting Press Guild]].<ref>Bolton, p. 308.</ref> In 2000, ''Death on the Rock'' was placed 92nd by industry professionals in a list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] compiled by the [[British Film Institute]].<ref name=\"bfi\">{{Cite web | last = | first = | title = List: 1-100 | work = [[BFI TV 100]] | publisher = bfi.org.uk | year = 2004 | url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/list.php | accessdate = 10 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nTwo other programmes were made about the Gibraltar shootings for British television, both by the [[BBC]].

The programme examined the deaths of three [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) members in [[Gibraltar]] on 6 March 1988 at the hands of the British [[Special Air Service]] (codenamed \"[[Operation Flavius]]\"). \"Death on the Rock\" presented evidence that the IRA members were shot without warning or while attempting to surrender. It was condemned by the British government, while [[tabloid journalism|tabloid newspapers]] denounced it as sensationalist. \"Death on the Rock\" subsequently became the first individual documentary to be the subject of an independent inquiry, in which it was largely vindicated.\n\nThe project began after it emerged that the three IRA members shot in Gibraltar were found to be unarmed and not in possession of a bomb. The series' editor, [[Roger Bolton (producer)|Roger Bolton]], dispatched journalists to Gibraltar and Spain, where they interviewed several people who witnessed the shootings as well as Spanish police officers who had been involved in surveillance of the IRA team. The journalists also filmed the funerals of the IRA members in [[Belfast]]. Satisfied by the journalists' findings, Bolton sought a conclusion to the programme; as the British government refused to comment, Bolton recruited a leading human rights lawyer to give his opinion on the findings. The documentary was broadcast on 28 April 1988 (just under two months after the shootings), despite two attempts by [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Sir Geoffrey Howe]] to have the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] postpone the broadcast. Using the eyewitness statements, the documentary questioned the government's version of events, and suggested that the three IRA members may have been unlawfully killed. Reporter Julian Manyon summed up the programme's findings: none of the witnesses interviewed for the programme heard the soldiers challenge the trio before opening fire, but variously believed they had seen the IRA members shot in the back, with their hands up, or after falling to the ground. The final contributor was the lawyer recruited by Bolton, who suggested that a judicial inquiry was necessary to resolve the conflicts.\n\nThe morning after the broadcast, several tabloid newspapers attacked the documentary, accusing it of sensationalism and \"trial by television\".<ref name=\"Eckert 138\"/> In the following days, they mounted a campaign against [[Carmen Proetta]], one of the documentary's main witnesses, accusing her of being a former prostitute and of being anti-British; Proetta later successfully sued several newspapers for [[defamation|libel]]. Other newspapers accused \"Death on the Rock\" of misrepresenting the eyewitnesses' statements and criticised the IBA for allowing the documentary to be broadcast. The eyewitnesses interviewed for \"Death on the Rock\" gave evidence at the inquest into the shootings; most repeated the statements they had given the programme, but one witness\u2014who had told the programme he had seen a soldier stand over one of the IRA members and fire at the man while he was on the ground\u2014retracted his previous statement. As a result of the retraction, Thames commissioned an independent inquiry into the making of \"Death on the Rock\"\u2014the first time an inquiry had been commissioned into the making of an individual documentary. The Windlesham\u2013Rampton report found that the programme's tendency was to present evidence that the IRA members had been unlawfully killed, but that it sought to raise questions rather than to reach a conclusion. The authors made several criticisms of the documentary, but overall found it a \"trenchant\" work of journalism, made in \"good faith and without ulterior motives\".<ref name=\"WR 144\"/> Thames lost its franchise and the IBA was abolished as a result of the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]]\u2014decisions which several involved parties believed were influenced by the government's anger at \"Death on the Rock\".\n\n==Background==\n===''This Week''===\n''This Week'' was a current affairs television series that began in 1956. In 1978, it was renamed ''TV Eye'' and took on a slightly lighter format; the title ''This Week'' was restored in 1986, after which it became steadily more journalistic. The programme was broadcast simultaneously across the [[ITV regions]] and became a mainstay of ITV's current affairs programming. By 1988, the programme had interviewed several prime ministers and leaders of the opposition, including [[Margaret Thatcher]] (the incumbent prime minister), who had been interviewed for three full episodes.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 15\u201317.</ref>\n\n===Gibraltar shootings===\n{{main|Operation Flavius}}\nOn 6 March 1988, three members of an IRA [[Active Service Unit]]\u2014[[Daniel McCann]], [[Mairead Farrell]], and [[Sean Savage]]\u2014were witnessed parking a car in a car park in [[Gibraltar]]; the car park was used as an assembly area for British soldiers preparing for the weekly \"changing of the guard\" ceremony outside [[The Convent (Gibraltar)|the Convent]] (the residence of the governor of Gibraltar). The three were suspected by the British authorities of being part of a plot to detonate a car bomb in the car park while it was full of soldiers preparing for the ceremony; while the suspects were walking back towards the Spanish border, they were shot dead by British soldiers, members of the [[Special Air Service]]. In the immediate aftermath of the shootings, the British government released a statement to the effect that a large car bomb had been found in Gibraltar, and that three suspected terrorists had been shot dead by the [[Gibraltar Police]].<ref name=\"Eckert 88\">Eckert, p. 88.</ref> That evening, British television news reported the finding of the alleged car bomb, and added that the IRA members had been involved in a \"shootout\" with authorities. All of Britain's daily newspapers covered the shootings the following morning, several of which cited the size of the alleged car bomb as {{convert|500|lb|kg}} and claimed that it was \"packed with shrapnel\". The same morning, [[Ian Stewart, Baron Stewartby|Ian Stewart]], [[Minister of State for the Armed Forces]], told [[BBC Radio 4]] that \"military personnel were involved\" in the shootings, and that \"a car bomb was found, which has been defused\".<ref>Eckert, pp. 86\u201387.</ref>\n\nThe following day, [[Sir Geoffrey Howe]], the British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|foreign secretary]], made a statement to the House of Commons regarding the shootings, in which he informed the house that the IRA members were unarmed, and that the car parked in the assembly area did not contain an explosive device. Howe stated that the IRA members \"made movements which led the military personnel, operating in support of the Gibraltar Police, to conclude that their own lives and the lives of others were under threat\". \"In light of this response\", Howe continued, \"they were shot\" by \"military personnel, operating in support of the Gibraltar Police\".<ref name=\"Eckert 88\"/> Subsequent inquiries led to the discovery of a large quantity of explosives in [[Marbella]] ({{convert|50|mi|km}} from Gibraltar), along with detonators and timers.<ref>Crawshaw & Holmstr\u00f6m, p. 92.</ref>\n\n==Investigation==\n''This Week''{{'s}} editor, [[Roger Bolton (producer)|Roger Bolton]], initially believed there was little merit in investigating the shootings. Based on the official account of events that was presented in the immediate aftermath of the shootings, Bolton believed that most people would think the IRA members \"deserved what they got\".<ref>Eckert, p. 87.</ref> Bolton's interest was piqued by Howe's statement, and the revelation in it that the deceased were unarmed and were not in possession of a bomb. Shortly afterwards, he dispatched two of ''This Week''{{'}}s journalists, Julian Manyon and Chris Oxley, to Gibraltar and Spain (respectively) to gather more information on the shootings.<ref>Eckert, p. 89.</ref> Bolton believed that the [[Milltown Cemetery attack]] and the [[corporals killings]], two events in Belfast which resulted from the Gibraltar killings, provided \"even more compelling reasons\" to investigate the shootings; the team considered switching the focus of the programme to the effects the shootings had in Belfast, but decided to continue with the original project.<ref>Bolton, pp. 203, 205.</ref>\n\n===Gibraltar===\n[[File:Gib Oil Winston Churchil Avenue 1.jpg|thumb|The petrol station on [[Winston Churchill Avenue]] where two of the three IRA members were shot|alt=A petrol station forecourt viewed from across the road]]\nAfter ten days' investigation, Oxley was surprised to learn that the Gibraltar Police were handling the police investigation into the shootings, having been closely involved in the events leading up to them. He also grew concerned that the police investigation was insufficiently rigorous when he learned that the police had not taken statements from residents whose flats overlooked the scene of Farrell's and McCann's deaths. The Gibraltar coroner, Felix Pizzarello, welcomed ''This Week''{{'}}s investigation, telling Oxley that he hoped the journalists would uncover witnesses who could assist the inquest.<ref>Eckert, p. 119.</ref> While Oxley was investigating the shootings from Gibraltar, Manyon travelled to Madrid in an attempt to learn more about the surveillance operation which took place in Spain prior to the shootings. Bolton added Alison Cahn to the team on 18 March; her task was to visit the flats which overlooked the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot, with the aim of interviewing any residents who might have witnessed the events of 6 March.<ref name=\"Eckert 119\">Eckert, pp. 119\u2013120.</ref> After several days' work, the team found two eyewitnesses to the shootings who were willing to speak on camera: Stephen Bullock, a local lawyer who had witnessed the events while out for a walk with his wife; and Josie Celecia, a housewife who had seen the shooting of McCann and Savage from her apartment window. Both witnesses' statements appeared to the journalists to be inconsistent with the official account of the shootings.<ref>Eckert, pp. 120\u2013123.</ref>\n\nThe journalists quickly decided they needed expert advice on ballistics and explosives, to which end they engaged Lieutenant Colonel [[George Styles (military officer)|George Styles]], [[George Cross|GC]], a retired British Army officer who had served as a bomb-disposal officer in Northern Ireland during [[the Troubles]]. Styles arrived in Gibraltar on 23 March, and immediately went to inspect the car park where Savage had parked the white Renault on the day of the shootings, after which he walked through the town along what the journalists believed was the IRA members' most likely route. When asked his opinion by the journalists, Styles cast doubt on the authorities' stated reasons for the shootings. He explained to the journalists that, had Savage's white Renault contained a substantial bomb, the weight would have been evident on the vehicle's springs. Styles also felt that the potential bomb was unlikely to have been detonated with a remote detonator on account of the buildings between the scenes of the shootings and the likelihood that it would be drowned out by other radio signals in the area. Finally, the journalists asked Styles to examine the scenes of the shootings, including ricochet marks that the soldiers' bullets had left on the pumps at the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot.<ref>Eckert, p. 124.</ref>\n\nAs Styles was examining the ricochet marks, Alison Cahn was approached by an elderly woman, who led Cahn to a nearby apartment building. There, the woman introduced Cahn to her daughter\u2014Carmen Proetta\u2014who told Cahn that she had witnessed the shooting at the petrol station; although initially reluctant, she was persuaded by Cahn to give her account of the events in an affidavit. Proetta asserted that, immediately before McCann and Farrell were shot, she saw a police car travelling north on [[Winston Churchill Avenue]] with its siren activated; as she watched, the police car stopped abruptly and four men\u2014one uniformed police officer and three men in civilian clothes\u2014jumped out. She stated that the three men in plain clothes, all carrying pistols, leapt across the central reservation barrier, at which point she saw McCann and Farrell raise their hands. Proetta believed that all three men then opened fire, while McCann and Farrell had their hands in the air, and that neither suspect made any movements towards their clothing or Farrell's handbag. She went on to state that she witnessed one of the men crouch over McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, and continue to shoot them.<ref>Eckert, pp. 125\u2013126.</ref> According to Styles, Proetta's account of the shooting tallied with the bullet marks he examined at the petrol station; he also found her description of the bullets striking the bodies particularly convincing, believing that only somebody who had witnessed such an event would be able to describe it so vividly. The journalists also discovered that Proetta's account of the soldiers arriving in a police car matched some of the newspaper reports from the day after the shootings.<ref>Eckert, p. 127.</ref><ref>Bolton, p. 16.</ref>\n\nBy the end of March, Cahn had traced two further witnesses to the shootings\u2014Diana Treacy, who claimed to have seen the soldiers shooting Savage in the back without warning and continuing to shoot him while he was on the ground, and Kenneth Asquez, who had provided a hand-written, unsigned statement, but was extremely reluctant to be filmed or named as a witness. He had come to the attention of the journalists through another witness, who provided Cahn with a video recording of the aftermath of the shootings.<ref>Eckert, pp. 128\u2013129.</ref> The journalists approached the witness through a second intermediary\u2014Christopher Finch, a local lawyer who had been assisting them as a consultant\u2014and received a typed but unsigned affidavit. In both documents, Asquez stated that he had been a passenger in a car that was passing the scene of Savage's shooting on 6 March; he described seeing Savage lying on the ground with a soldier standing over him, and witnessing the soldier shoot Savage \"two or three times at point-blank range\" while the latter was on the ground.<ref name=\"Eckert 130\">Eckert, p. 130.</ref> The journalists failed to persuade Asquez to sign his affidavit, but decided to incorporate it into the programme nonetheless.<ref name=\"Eckert 130\"/>\n\n===Spain===\nJulian Manyon arrived in Madrid on 11 March, and shortly afterwards engaged Henry Debelius, a journalist and American expatriate, as an interpreter and consultant for the programme. Within days, the two men wrote to the Spanish police headquarters to request information from the authorities and assistance in reconstructing the surveillance operation that preceded the shootings as the IRA team travelled through Spain.<ref name=\"Eckert 119\"/> Ten days later, they met with a spokesman for the [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Spanish interior ministry]], who confirmed that the Spanish authorities had tracked the three IRA members throughout their time in Spain. The Spanish surveillance operation included multiple cars following the suspects' vehicle, periodically \"leap-frogging\" each other to avoid attracting attention; use of a helicopter to track the team's movements; constant radio communication between the officers involved and police headquarters; and officers monitoring the suspects' movements at fixed observation posts. The spokesman also told the men that the Spanish kept the British authorities constantly apprised of the IRA team's movements, and that the British were aware of Savage's arrival at the Gibraltar border, and allowed the white Renault he was driving to enter the territory.<ref>Eckert, pp. 127\u2013128.</ref><ref>Williams, p. 36.</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nAs well as the investigation in Gibraltar and Spain, ''This Week'' conducted some of the filming for \"Death on the Rock\" in Northern Ireland. Its journalists filmed the funeral of McCann, Savage, and Farrell; while there, Manyon took the opportunity to interview [[Gerry Adams]], leader of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], who refused to confirm that the three were planning a bomb attack on Gibraltar. The team decided against using Adams' interview, and only 45 seconds of the footage was used in the final cut.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 19\u201320.</ref> The journalists were keen to show the potential impact of a bomb like the one the IRA had planned to explode in Gibraltar; they initially hoped to film a controlled explosion of a bomb of similar size, but no private contractor would conduct such an experiment without government approval. In lieu of filming an explosion, ''This Week'' interviewed Noreen Hill\u2014whose husband was left in a coma as a result of a smaller [[Remembrance Day bombing|bombing in Enniskillen]] in November 1987\u2014to \"depict the human tragedy of IRA bombings\".<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 121.</ref> They also filmed an interview with a second survivor of the Enniskillen bombing, which was not included in the final cut.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 122.</ref>\n\n==Conclusion==\n[[File:Geoffrey Howe.jpg|thumb|[[Sir Geoffrey Howe]], then Foreign Secretary, twice attempted to have the programme postponed.|alt=A white-haired man in a grey suit and tie]]\nBased on the information his journalists had gathered from eyewitnesses in Gibraltar and that provided by the Spanish authorities, Bolton believed his team had enough to broadcast a documentary about the Gibraltar shootings. The journalists filmed those eyewitnesses who were willing to speak on camera. They also rented a helicopter, and\u2014with the assistance of the Spanish authorities, who provided two police officers who had taken part in the operation\u2014filmed a reconstruction of the Spanish surveillance operation.<ref>Eckert, p. 128.</ref><ref>Williams, p. 17.</ref>\n\nThroughout the investigation, the authorities in Britain and Gibraltar refused to provide any information or to comment on the journalists' findings. Thus, ''This Week'' were unable to present their conclusions to a member of the government and broadcast their reaction, as was the usual practice for closing such a documentary. In place of such a conclusion, Bolton approached [[George Carman]]\u2014a leading London lawyer specialising in human rights issues\u2014who agreed to be interviewed for the programme.<ref name=\"Eckert, p. 131\">Eckert, p. 131.</ref>{{refn|On 21 April, a week before the programme was due to be broadcast, Manyon met with a [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) spokesman and a British Army public relations officer, in a final, unsuccessful, attempt to include an official statement from the government.<ref>Eckert, p. 135.</ref>|group=\"note\"}}\n\nOn 26 April, two days before \"Death on the Rock\" was due to air, the British government intervened to prevent its broadcast. Howe telephoned [[George Thomson, Baron Thomson of Monifieth|Lord Thomson]], chair of the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA), to request he force the postponement of the broadcast on the grounds that Howe feared the documentary might prejudice the coroner's inquest. Thomson personally viewed \"Death on the Rock\" before making the final decision to permit its broadcast, with two alterations to the commentary.{{refn|The IBA felt that the first version of the commentary suggested too strongly that the inquest would be inadequate and that the Gibraltar Police were unreliable; both concerns were addressed before the IBA approved the programme.<ref>Bolton, p. 228.</ref>|group=\"note\"}} He later wrote that, \"paradoxically\", the decision \"was not a difficult one. My colleagues and I saw no reason why the IBA should prevent Thames' journalists interviewing those who claimed to be eyewitnesses and investigating the affair as numerous other journalists had since the shootings, provided that the criminal record of the terrorists and the enormity of the outrage they planned was made clear and the legal position had been established to our satisfaction\".<ref>Eckert, pp. 135\u2013136.</ref><ref>Bolton, pp. 228, 232.</ref> With a slightly altered rationale\u2014that the documentary could contaminate witness evidence at the inquest\u2014Howe again attempted to prevent the programme's broadcast on the day it was due to be shown; after taking further legal advice, the IBA upheld its decision to permit the showing of \"Death on the Rock\".<ref>Eckert, p. 136.</ref>\n\n==Broadcast==\nFinal editing of the programme was still under way while the IBA was considering Howe's requests, causing Bolton to worry that it would not be completed in time. The editing was eventually finished just ten minutes before the documentary was due to air. \"Death on the Rock\" was ultimately broadcast in the United Kingdom on schedule, at 21:00 on 28 April 1988, six weeks after the shootings.<ref name=\"Bolton 235\"/><ref>Eckert, p. 137.</ref>\n\n[[File:Renault 5 Saga.jpg|thumb|A white [[Renault 5]], similar to that driven into Gibraltar by Sean Savage|alt=A white Renault car in a car park]]\nThe programme opened with excerpts from two of the interviews prior to the title sequence, followed by an introduction from [[Jonathan Dimbleby]], who told viewers that the evidence presented in the programme was \"of critical importance for those who wish to find out what really happened in Gibraltar last month\".<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 30.</ref> The commentary cut to Manyon, who introduced Styles and discussed the impact the IRA's bomb would have had, and then to Noreen Hill, whose husband was in a coma as a result of the Enniskillen bombing. Manyon pointed out that the IRA expressed regret after Enniskillen, but that they were by then already planning to attack Gibraltar.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 30\u201333.</ref> Manyon told viewers of the three IRA members' backgrounds, before introducing an interview with an official from the Spanish Interior Ministry, who discussed the Spanish surveillance operation,<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 33\u201337.</ref> of which viewers were shown a reconstruction with a voice-over from Manyon.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 45\u201346.</ref> The programme reconstructed Savage's movements as he crossed the border into Gibraltar, parked his car in the assembly area for the ceremony and met up with McCann and Farrell, after which it broadcast part of Howe's statement to the House of Commons: \"Their presence and actions near the parked Renault car gave rise to strong suspicion that it contained a bomb, which appeared to be corroborated by a rapid technical examination of the car\".<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 47\u201348.</ref> Manyon explained that the vehicle was later found not to contain a bomb, and introduced Styles, who believed that such an examination would have shown that the car did not contain a bomb, as the weight would have been evident on the vehicle's springs.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 49.</ref>\n\nManyon continued to narrate as the programme reconstructed the IRA team's movements through Gibraltar towards the border until McCann and Farrell reached a petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue. \"Then, suddenly\", Manyon told viewers, \"shots rang out, and in less than a minute all three terrorists were dead\u2014shot by the SAS\". The commentary again cut to Howe's statement, after which Manyon detailed ''This Week''{{'s}} investigation. He introduced the four eyewitnesses the journalists had discovered (Diana Treacy, Josie Celecia, Stephen Bullock, and Carmen Proetta). Celecia described witnessing McCann and Farrell walking along Winston Churchill Avenue before hearing several shots, and then seeing a soldier continue to fire at the pair while they were on the ground. Proetta told the programme she saw a police car arrive opposite the petrol station, that three armed men in plain clothes then disembarked, jumped across the central barrier, and shot McCann and Farrell while the latter had their hands up.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 50\u201353.</ref> Bullock was interviewed walking the route he had walked on the day of the shootings; his account was of two men in plain clothes shooting McCann and Farrell at very close range and continuing to shoot as the pair fell and while they were on the ground. Treacy, meanwhile, was walking along Landport Lane when Savage ran past her, pursued by at least one soldier. She stated that she did not hear any warning before Savage was shot; she ran away after the shooting began. Asquez was not named in the broadcast; his statement\u2014that he saw a soldier firing at Savage while the latter was on the ground\u2014was read out by an actor.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 54\u201359.</ref>\n\nStyles told Manyon he believed it unlikely that the IRA would have succeeded in detonating a bomb in the assembly area from the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot (a distance of approximately {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}). Returning to Proetta, the documentary heard her reaction to Howe's statement that McCann and Farrell made threatening movements; Proetta believed that the incident was triggered by the siren from the police car on Winston Churchill Avenue. She believed that any movements McCann and Farrell made were in response to the siren, and was adamant that the pair had their hands up when they were shot.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 60\u201363.</ref> Manyon summed up the programme's findings:\n*no independent witnesses heard a challenge,\n*Proetta believed McCann and Farrell were shot with their hands up,\n*Treacy saw Savage shot in the back,\n*two witnesses claimed to have seen the IRA members \"finished off\" on the ground,\n*Styles believed the authorities should have known the car did not contain a bomb.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 65\u201366.</ref>\n\nCarman, the QC recruited by Bolton, was the last contributor to the documentary. Presented with ''This Week''{{'s}} evidence, he disagreed with Margaret Thatcher's statement that the inquest would be sufficient to establish the facts of the incident. He opined that a more powerful judicial enquiry, possibly headed by a British [[High Court of England and Wales|High Court]] judge, would be better equipped to eliminate the inconsistencies between the official version of events and the eyewitness statements. In conclusion, Manyon asked Carman \"do you believe this case is so important that the government should take such extraordinary steps in order to clarify the facts?\" Carman responded \"the programme indicates there are serious, important public issues involved, and speaking as a lawyer, one is always anxious when there is contest on the facts in such important areas, they should be properly and efficiently investigated\".<ref name=\"Eckert, p. 131\"/><ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 67.</ref> The documentary closed with Jonathan Dimbleby:\n<blockquote>\nThat report was made, as you may have detected, without the cooperation of the British government, which says it will make no comment until the inquest.\n\nAs our film contained much new evidence hitherto unavailable to the coroner, we are sending the transcripts to his court in Gibraltar, where it's been made clear to us that all such evidence is welcomed.\n\nFrom ''This Week'', goodnight.<ref name=\"Bolton 235\">Bolton, p. 235.</ref><ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 68.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Reaction==\nThe controversy surrounding \"Death on the Rock\" was \"unsurpassed\" in Lord Thomson's experience.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 72.</ref> The morning after the broadcast, the British [[Broadsheet#United Kingdom broadsheets|broadsheet]]s appeared open-minded or moderately favourable to ''This Week''; ''[[The Times]]'' told readers that \"Death on the Rock\" \"seemed a significant, thoroughly responsible and serious examination of a most disturbing case\" and that it \"simply raised serious questions and suggested they needed deep examination\".<ref>Eckert, pp. 137\u2013138.</ref><ref name=Windlesham69>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 69.</ref> The [[Tabloid (newspaper format)#Types|tabloids]], however, berated the programme and its makers. ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' accused the makers of a \"cheap scoop\" and labelled the programme \"IRA propaganda\".<ref name=\"Eckert 138\">Eckert, p. 138.</ref> The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' was equally robust; its main headline read \"fury over SAS 'trial by TV'\", while in an inside article, it called the programme \"woefully one-sided\",<ref name=Windlesham69/> and accused Bolton of having previously collaborated with the IRA for sensational news stories.<ref name=\"Eckert 138\"/><ref name=\"Bolton 237\">Bolton, p. 237.</ref>{{refn|Bolton later successfully sued the ''Mail'' for libel.<ref name=\"Bolton 237\"/>|group=\"note\"}} That evening, Bolton agreed to appear on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Right to Reply]]'', a show which allowed ordinary viewers to question the makers of controversial television programmes; the programme was pre-recorded, and, unusually, the producers agreed to cut the end of the recording after one of the participants\u2014a former member of Margaret Thatcher's personal staff claiming to be an impartial viewer\u2014launched an attack on Bolton, in which he accused Bolton of associating with terrorists.<ref>Eckert. pp. 139\u2013140.</ref><ref>Bolton, pp. 238\u2013239.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the days after the broadcast of \"Death on the Rock\", the British tabloid press mounted a campaign against Carmen Proetta, one of the documentary's key witnesses. The day after the broadcast, the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' printed a story about Proetta's husband; the piece\u2014citing the Gibraltar Police press officer\u2014claimed that Maxie Proetta was a drug smuggler well known to the Gibraltar Police. Over the course of the week, several of the tabloids ran stories claiming that Carmen Proetta ran an escort agency and that she was a former prostitute with a criminal record; in one headline, ''The Sun'' labelled her \"the tart of Gib\".<ref>Eckert, p. 141.</ref><ref name=\"Williams 24\">Williams, pp. 24\u201325.</ref> Several stories also attempted to portray Proetta as anti-British, including one in the broadsheet ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' which claimed she was one of the 44 people who voted to end the British administration in [[1967 Gibraltar sovereignty referendum|Gibraltar's 1967 referendum]].<ref>Eckert, pp. 140\u2013142.</ref> In fact, Proetta had served briefly as a director of a Spanish tour company and had no criminal record in either Spain or Gibraltar; her husband had been convicted for drug possession in Spain and was, at the time of the shootings, facing separate charges for allowing his boat to be used by drug smugglers. Proetta later sued ''The Sun'' and other newspapers for libel and won substantial damages.<ref name=\"Williams 24\"/><ref>Eckert, pp. 142, 149.</ref><ref>Bolton, pp. 240\u2013241.</ref><ref name=\"indy\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/sudden-death-and-the-long-quest-for-answers-1603189.html|title=Sudden death and the long quest for answers|last=Mills|first=Heather|date=28 September 1995|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Sunday Times]]'' attempted to undermine the programme's credibility with its own investigative journalism. Citing \"official sources\", the paper told its readers that ''This Week''{{'}}s account of the shootings was \"crucially flawed\", and \"bore no resemblance to what happened\". It went on to claim that several of the programme's witnesses felt that \"Death on the Rock\" had misrepresented their statements. It stated that the documentary's technical advisor, Lieutenant Colonel George Styles, was aggrieved that two of his \"key opinions\" had been omitted from the version broadcast\u2014specifically that what Proetta interpreted as a gesture of surrender may have been an involuntary reaction to the bullets striking the suspects' bodies, and that the IRA members could still have detonated a bomb in another vehicle parked on the Spanish side of the border. The latter opinion was omitted because the ''This Week'' team saw little for the IRA to gain by detonating a bomb on Spanish soil, while the former was included in the broadcast. Josie Celecia, it alleged, had dismissed Proetta's account as \"ridiculous\", while Stephen Bullock had contradicted Proetta's statement that she had seen plain-clothed soldiers arriving in a police car\u2014testimony ''The Sunday Times'' believed \"destroyed\" Proetta's evidence. Both witnesses complained in letters to other newspapers. Through these, it emerged that Bullock had dismissed only one detail in Proetta's evidence as \"ridiculous\", while he and Proetta had been referring to two distinct police cars in their statements.{{refn|Bullock did observe one inaccuracy in \"Death on the Rock\": that he was reported as saying he had not heard the soldiers shout a warning to McCann and Farrell, when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not.<ref>Eckert, p. 147.</ref>|group=\"note\"}}<ref>Eckert, pp. 145\u2013147.</ref> ''The Sunday Times'' omitted Styles' belief that the shootings were a pre-emptive attack. Styles' view was one of \"two active service units waging war [...] taking [the IRA members] out quickly, cleanly, and without other people being hurt{{refn|Styles was apparently unaware that one passer-by was grazed by a ricocheting bullet.<ref>Eckert, p. 149.</ref>|group=\"note\"}}\u2014that seems to be the only way\".<ref>Eckert, p. 148.</ref>{{refn|Three ''Sunday Times'' journalists later wrote letters to other publications to complain that their copy was distorted by sub-editors.<ref>Bolton, p. 290.</ref>|group=\"note\"}} Several newspapers were critical of the IBA's decision to allow the documentary to be broadcast.<ref>Williams, p. 38.</ref>\n\n==Inquest==\nThe witnesses uncovered during the production of \"Death on the Rock\" appeared at the inquest, which began on 6 September.<ref>Eckert, p. 166.</ref> One of the first civilians to give evidence was Allen Feraday, an explosives expert who worked for the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD); he confirmed Styles' contribution to the documentary\u2014that the IRA had not been known to use a remote-detonated bomb without a direct line of sight to their target. The various expert witnesses at the inquest disagreed as to whether a detonation signal could have reached the parked Renault from the scenes of the shootings.<ref>Eckert, pp. 215\u2013220.</ref> Multiple eyewitnesses gave evidence over the course of the inquest. Four gave evidence which broadly supported the official version of events; in particular, none saw the soldiers shoot McCann, Savage, or Farrell while they were on the ground. The witnesses from \"Death on the Rock\" also appeared. Stephen Bullock told the coroner that he saw McCann and Savage raise their hands before seeing the SAS shoot them at point-blank range. Josie Celecia's evidence\u2014that she saw a soldier shooting at McCann and Farrell while the pair were on the ground\u2014was stringently challenged by government lawyers, who pointed out that her account had changed somewhat since she had appeared on camera and that she was unable to identify the SAS soldiers from photographs taken by her husband.<ref>Eckert, p. 223.</ref>{{refn|Douglas Celecia handed his photographs to the Gibraltar Police. After the inquest, his request for their return was declined; he eventually recovered them after legal action against the Gibraltar Police, which was funded by Thames Television.<ref>Bolton, pp. 215\u2013216.</ref>|group=\"note\"}}\n\nMaxie Proetta appeared on 22 September. He told the coroner that he had witnessed four men (three in plain clothes and one uniformed Gibraltar Police officer) arriving opposite the petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue; the men jumped over the central reservation barrier and Farrell put her hands up, after which he heard a series of shots. In contrast to his wife's testimony, he believed that Farrell's gesture was one of self-defence rather than surrender, and he believed that the shots he heard did not come from the men from the police car. The government lawyers suggested that the police car he and his wife had seen was one seen by other eyewitnesses further south, and that it was responding to the shootings rather than transporting soldiers, but Mr Proetta was adamant that the lawyers' suggestion did not make sense. Carmen Proetta appeared the following day. Mrs Proetta's testimony contained some discrepancies with the evidence she gave to \"Death on the Rock\"; she was no longer certain that she had seen the SAS shoot McCann and Savage while the latter were on the ground, because she could not recall seeing shell casings being ejected from the soldiers' weapons. The government lawyers questioned the reliability of Proetta's evidence based on her changes, and implied that she behaved suspiciously by giving evidence to \"Death on the Rock\" before the police. She responded that the police had not spoken to her about the shootings until after \"Death on the Rock\" had been shown.<ref>Eckert, pp. 226\u2013227.</ref> Asquez, who provided an unsworn statement to the programme through an intermediary, reluctantly appeared at the inquest. He retracted the statements he had given to the journalists, which he claimed he had made up after \"pestering\" from Major Bob Randall (who had sold the programme a video recording of the aftermath of the shootings).{{refn|Randall was on holiday abroad at the time of the inquest, having been advised by the Gibraltar Police that he would not be needed. Upon his return, he strongly denied putting any pressure on Asquez.<ref>Eckert, p. 232.</ref>|group=\"note\"}} The British tabloids covered Asquez's retraction extensively, while several members of parliament accused \"Death on the Rock\" of manipulating Asquez in an attempt to discredit the SAS and the British government. However, Asquez's statement contained several details that were not released publicly, and which only entered the public domain during the inquest, though, when questioned by the coroner, Asquez said he could not explain the discrepancy because he was \"a bit confused\".<ref>Eckert, pp. 230\u2013233.</ref> The inquest concluded on 30 September and the jury returned a verdict of lawful killing.<ref>Eckert, p. 235.</ref>\n\nFollowing the inquest, the families of McCann, Savage, and Farrell applied to the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] for an opinion on whether the authorities' actions in Gibraltar violated Article 2 (the \"right to life\") of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR);<ref name=\"Eckert 286\">Eckert, pp. 286\u2013287.</ref> ''This Week''{{'s}} journalists provided statements to the commission regarding the Spanish surveillance operation (the existence of which had been denied by the British authorities at the inquest). The commission's report found no violation of Article 2, but the commission referred the case to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) for a final decision.<ref name=\"Eckert 286\"/><ref>Crawshaw & Holmstr\u00f6m, pp. 94\u201395.</ref> The court rejected the families' submission that the British government had conspired to kill the three, but did find a violation of Article 2 in the defective planning and control of the operation. Nevertheless, the applicants' claim for damages was dismissed on the grounds that the trio had been killed while preparing an act of terrorism, though it did order the government to pay the applicants' costs.<ref name=\"Eckert 286\"/>\n\n==Windlesham\u2013Rampton Report==\nFollowing Asquez's retraction of his statement and his allegation that he was pressured into giving a false account of the events he witnessed, the IBA contacted Thames to express its concern and to raise the possibility of an investigation into the making of the documentary. Thames eventually agreed to commission an independent inquiry into the programme (the first such inquiry into an individual programme), to be conducted by two people with no connection to either Thames or the IBA; to that end, Thames engaged [[David Hennessy, 3rd Baron Windlesham|Lord Windlesham]] and [[Richard Rampton]],&nbsp;QC.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 3\u20134.</ref> Windlesham was a Conservative politician, privy councillor, and former minister in the [[Home Office]] and then the [[Northern Ireland Office]]; he also had experience of television journalism, having previously managed two television companies. Rampton was a leading barrister specialising in media law and libel.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, back cover.</ref><ref>Bolton, pp. 275\u2013276.</ref> The inquiry's terms of reference were \"to inquire into the making and screening of 'Death on the Rock'\", including its creation, production, content, and any effect it had had on the inquest.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 4.</ref>\n\nThe report found that the tendency of the evidence presented in the programme was to suggest the terrorists had been unlawfully killed, and that it did not explore alternative explanations in any depth. Nevertheless, Windlesham and Rampton believed that the programme presented evidence for one possible explanation, but sought to raise questions rather than reach a conclusion. In analysing the content of the programme, they found that it allowed the witnesses to give their accounts in their own words rather than presenting them as established fact. Thus, they found that the content did not infringe any requirement for neutrality. The report scrutinised in detail the statements of the eyewitnesses who spoke on camera, including the parts of the interviews that were not included in the broadcast version of the programme. It found, with two exceptions, that the witnesses' statements were fairly represented in the programme. The exceptions were that the programme suggested that Bullock had not heard a warning, when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not; and that the commentary implied that all four witnesses who appeared on the programme had seen no threatening movements from the IRA members, when only two had been asked whether they witnessed such movements.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 105\u2013106.</ref> Windlesham and Rampton also considered Asquez's statement and the journalists' decision to incorporate it into the programme.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 70\u201372.</ref> The report considered that the journalists acted reasonably in using the statement, despite Asquez's refusal to sign it, on the grounds that Asquez had given two separate, near-identical statements (including one to a lawyer), and that they considered it unlikely that somebody would invent such a dramatic account. Nonetheless, the report criticised the programme for not informing viewers of Asquez's refusal to sign the statement.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 101\u2013102.</ref>\n\nThe [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] (FCO) made representations to the inquiry that \"Death on the Rock\" could potentially have had an adverse effect on the inquest on the same grounds that Howe had attempted to delay the broadcast. The first was that the programme might have been seen by members of the inquest jury, and could thus have caused them to reach a conclusion on the shootings before hearing the evidence at the inquest. Considering this submission, the report agreed with the opinions of lawyers consulted by Thames and the IBA that \"Death on the Rock\" was safe to be broadcast on 28 April 1988. The report considered that Thames withheld distribution of \"Death on the Rock\" from Gibraltar and Spain specifically to address such concerns, though it was widely discussed in British newspapers (which are widely sold in the territory) and extracts later became available in Gibraltar. The report concluded it was foreseeable that the content of \"Death on the Rock\" would become known in Gibraltar, but that it would not have prejudiced potential jurors as, in the authors' opinion, the programme raised one possibility, but did not seek to present it as the only possible version of events.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 111\u2013113.</ref> The second was that the programme might have contaminated the evidence presented at the inquest, as witnesses might have been tempted to give false or embellished accounts for the television.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 118.</ref> The report dismissed this concern; the authors believed that all the eyewitnesses gave honest accounts of what they believed they saw, and pointed out that three had given statements to the Gibraltar Police and two had been interviewed by Gibraltarian and British newspapers prior to being interviewed for \"Death on the Rock\".<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, pp. 121\u2013122.</ref>\n\nOverall, Windlesham and Rampton found \"Death on the Rock\" to be a \"trenchant\" work of journalism, made in \"good faith and without ulterior motives\".<ref name=\"WR 144\">Windlesham & Rampton, p. 144.</ref> In conclusion, the authors believed that \"Death on the Rock\" proved that \"freedom of expression can prevail in the most extensive, and the most immediate, of all the means of mass communication\".<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 145.</ref>\n\nThe terms of reference of the report did not invite any recommendations, nor did the authors offer any.<ref>Windlesham & Rampton, p. 141.</ref>\n\n==Impact==\n\"Death on the Rock\" was highly praised within the television industry and went on to win the [[BAFTA Award for Best Documentary]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1989/television/flaherty-documentary-award|title=Flaherty Documentary Award in 1989|publisher=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref> and an award from the [[Broadcasting Press Guild]].<ref>Bolton, p. 308.</ref> In 2000, ''Death on the Rock'' was placed 92nd by industry professionals in a list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] compiled by the [[British Film Institute]].<ref name=\"bfi\">{{Cite web | last = | first = | title = List: 1-100 | work = [[BFI TV 100]] | publisher = bfi.org.uk | year = 2004 | url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/list.php | accessdate = 10 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nTwo other programmes were made about the Gibraltar shootings for British television, both by the [[BBC]]. BBC Northern Ireland produced an episode of ''[[Spotlight (BBC Northern Ireland TV programme)|Spotlight]]'' which arrived at similar findings to those of ''This Week''; Howe attempted to have the programme delayed, using the same rationale with which he requested \"Death on the Rock\" be postponed. The programme was eventually broadcast, but restricted to Northern Ireland.<ref>Bolton, pp. 246\u2013247.</ref> The BBC's flagship current affairs series ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' made a programme about the SAS and its role in the Troubles to coincide with the end of the Gibraltar inquest; it was postponed by BBC executives in the wake of the controversy surrounding \"Death on the Rock\".<ref>Potschka, p. 103.</ref><ref>Bolton, pp. 274\u2013275.</ref>\n\nAcademic Christian Potschka described \"Death on the Rock\" as part of a decade of \"unprecedented conflict between government and broadcasters over ... investigative documentaries\".<ref>Potschka, p. 273.</ref> Margaret Thatcher \"utterly rejected\" the findings of the Windlesham\u2013Rampton report. After the reforms brought in by the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]], the process of bidding for ITV franchises was overhauled in an attempt to introduce greater competition. In the subsequent auction, Thames Television lost its contract; several journalists and former Thames employees speculated that the Act was the government's revenge for \"Death on the Rock\".

Originating from an area of disturbed weather on June&nbsp;25, 2010, it slowly developed in the western [[Caribbean Sea]] and struck [[Belize]] as a strong tropical storm. After entering the [[Gulf of Mexico]], Alex became very large and encountered conditions favorable for gradual development. Early on June&nbsp;30<!--per UTC time, all hurricane articles use UTC time-->, the cyclone attained hurricane status as it approached northeastern Mexico, the first June hurricane in the Atlantic basin since [[Hurricane Allison (1995)|Hurricane Allison]] in 1995, and the storm [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]] just off the coast of [[Tamaulipas]]. Alex [[Landfall (meteorology)|came ashore]] near [[Soto la Marina]] as a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale]].\n\nAlex caused the deaths of at least 51 people along its path, and produced over $1.5 billion (2010 USD) in damage. The precursor of the hurricane produced substantial rainfall across the [[Greater Antilles]], causing one death in the [[Dominican Republic]]. Fourteen people were killed in [[Central America]] as a result of flooding during the first landfall of Alex. In Mexico, the storm's outer [[rainband]]s killed three people in [[Acapulco]], one person in [[Oaxaca]], and another in [[Chiapas]]. At its final landfall, Alex caused at least fifteen deaths in [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], eight in [[Coahuila]], six in [[Guanajuato]], and one in both [[Tamaulipas]] and [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]]; an additional twenty persons were reported missing.\n\nAlex triggered widespread power outages throughout northeastern Mexico and southern [[Texas]]. Damage was most evident in the [[Monterrey Metropolitan area|Monterrey metropolitan area]], which faced what Nuevo Le\u00f3n governor [[Rodrigo Medina|Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz]] described as, \"the worst weather phenomenon in its history.\"<ref name=\"EFE Mty impact\"/> Following Alex's final landfall, a state of emergency was declared for most of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, portions of Tamaulipas, and Texas.

In the meantime, they also try to find out who killed two off-duty sailors whose deaths might be linked to an upcoming terrorist attack and the theft of a drone from a company. But in the end, it might not be enough as NCIS find themselves paying a very high price for their efforts when one of their own is brutally murdered in Gibbs and Ari's battle with each other...\n\nThe episode also marks the final regular appearance of Special Agent [[Caitlin Todd|Kate Todd]] (played by [[Sasha Alexander]]), who is later replaced by [[Mossad]] Officer [[Ziva David]] (played by [[Cote de Pablo]]). Todd is later shown in Season 8, episode \"[[A Man Walks Into a Bar...]]\" as a memory by the rest of the team, and in the Season 9 episode \"[[Life Before His Eyes]]\" as the wife of DiNozzo in an alternative universe in Gibbs' mind. Both of the episodes include scenes from this episode as flashbacks.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo men are gunned down in their car, both pilots and navy lieutenants. NCIS is called in to investigate the deaths. Both hands are missing on one of the lieutenants, making it look like a professional hit. While collecting evidence, [[Anthony DiNozzo|DiNozzo]] discovers a bomb under the car, which explodes close to the team, making [[Leroy Jethro Gibbs|Gibbs]] believe someone is after them.\n\n[[Abby Sciuto|Abby]] cannot identify the C-4 used in the bomb, and [[List of NCIS characters#Thomas Morrow|Director Morrow]] indicates there may be other factors involved. Gibbs later meets [[Ari Haswari]], a double agent for the FBI with whom he has had complications previously. FBI agent [[List of NCIS characters#Tobias C. Fornell|Fornell]] is called in to inform Gibbs about Ari's mission in the US, and together with Director Morrow, he tells Gibbs not to interfere with the mission.\n\nBecause of the history between Gibbs and Ari, Director Morrow places Gibbs under protective custody under the lead of ex-Secret Service agent [[Caitlin Todd|Todd]]. The investigation continues, leading to the discovery of a missing target drone from the workplace of one of the dead pilots. Gibbs is sure Ari is behind the deaths and forces Fornell to locate him. Ari's location reveals he is not a double agent, but the one who runs the terrorist cell.\n\nThe team figures out Ari's location and is attacked by several terrorists. The drone is on the top of the building, and one finger from the dead pilot's hand is used to launch the drone. [[Timothy McGee|McGee]] tries to take control over the drone while Gibbs, Todd, and DiNozzo takes the terrorists down. One terrorist ambushes the team and shoots at Gibbs. Todd protects him, and she is hit by the bullet. The bullet proof vest she wears stops her from being hurt. She gets up and the team relaxes and jokes with each other. DiNozzo tells Todd that she did good, pleasantly surprising her, and she says, \"Wow, I thought I'd die before I ever heard a complim\u2013\", when a lone bullet suddenly emerges from out of nowhere and rips through her head, killing her instantly. Ari is revealed to be the murderer, shown behind a sniper rifle on top of a nearby building. Gibbs and DiNozzo are absolutely stunned. DiNozzo's face is covered in a splash of Kate's blood, and Gibbs points his gun into the distance, knowing Ari was the shooter.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:NCIS television prop (19 September 2008) 36.jpg|thumb|''Bert the Hippo'', first shown in this episode.<ref name=twilight2>{{cite video|title=Twilight (commented by cast and producers)|year=2006|medium=''NCIS: The Second Season'' (DVD)|publisher=[[CBS Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Sasha Alexander 2012.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sasha Alexander's character Kate Todd was killed in the episode.]]\n\nThe episode is written by [[John C.

This premise led to the most nerve-wracking and intense episode of television that I believe I've ever seen and certainly is one of the greatest TV episodes of all time. After about 58 and a half minutes into the episode, we still didn't know who would perish or how. Gibbs and his team of Tony DiNozzo, Kate Todd and Timothy McGee were all in a building taking enemy fire, while at the same time trying to stop a missile from blowing up a ship. McGee successfully stops the missile, but Gibbs, DiNozzo and Todd are still taking fire on top of the roof, when a shooter attempts to kill Gibbs. Todd jumps in front of Gibbs, saving his life, but was saved by her bulletproof vest. After Gibbs and DiNozzo help her to her feet a bullet from a sniper rifle, fired by the terrorist Ari Haswari, pierces through her forehead killing her instantly as a stunned Gibbs and DiNozzo look on. Almost seven full years later this is still maybe the most riveting ending to a television episode and season that I've ever seen.<ref>{{cite web |last=Spivey |first=Julian |date=January 17, 2012 |title=10 greatest episodes of 'NCIS' |publisher=[[Examiner.com]] }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{NCIS television}}\n\n[[Category:2005 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:NCIS (season 2) episodes]]\n[[Category:Television episodes about death]]\n", "text_old": "{{Notability|Television|date=January 2012}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Twilight (''NCIS'')}}\n{{Infobox television episode \n| title = Twilight\n| colour = \n| series = [[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]\n| season = 2\n| episode = 23\n| image = \n| caption = \n| airdate = May 24, 2005\n| production = \n| writer = [[John C.

The reruns in the summer also got high numbers of viewers, which the producers explained to be because of the press cover in the aftermath of agent Todd's death.<ref name=twilight />\n\nJulian Spivey from [[Examiner.com]] included \"Twilight\" in his January 2012 compilation of the \"10 greatest episodes of 'NCIS{{'\"}}, saying,\n\n<blockquote>Going into the season two finale of ''NCIS'' we all knew that one of the main cast members was going to be killed ... but we didn't know how and we didn't know who. This premise led to the most nerve-wracking and intense episode of television that I believe I've ever seen and certainly is one of the greatest TV episodes of all time. After about 58 and a half minutes into the episode, we still didn't know who would perish or how. Gibbs and his team of Tony DiNozzo, Kate Todd and Timothy McGee were all in a building taking enemy fire, while at the same time trying to stop a missile from blowing up a ship. McGee successfully stops the missile, but Gibbs, DiNozzo and Todd are still taking fire on top of the roof, when a shooter attempts to kill Gibbs. Todd jumps in front of Gibbs, saving his life, but was saved by her bulletproof vest. After Gibbs and DiNozzo help her to her feet a bullet from a sniper rifle, fired by the terrorist Ari Haswari, pierces through her forehead killing her instantly as a stunned Gibbs and DiNozzo look on. Almost seven full years later this is still maybe the most riveting ending to a television episode and season that I've ever seen.<ref>{{cite web |last=Spivey |first=Julian |date=January 17, 2012 |title=10 greatest episodes of 'NCIS' |publisher=[[Examiner.com]] }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{NCIS television}}\n\n[[Category:2005 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:NCIS (season 2) episodes]]\n[[Category:Television episodes about death]]\n", "name_user": "Gonnym", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_(NCIS)"}

In the \"Mrs. Wiggins\" sketch titled ''Flashbacks'', Mr. Tudball (Conway) is moving his office to a new location and has a flashback to when he first met and interviewed Mrs. Wiggins (Burnett); and in \"The Family\" sketch ''The Psychiatrist'', [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]] (Burnett) and [[Thelma Harper|Mama]] (Lawrence) visit a psychiatrist ([[Craig Richard Nelson]]) as Eunice is trying to figure out what went wrong with her life. (Although these were the final sketches of ''The Carol Burnett Show'', the characters would end up being reprised one year later in a different four-week series, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'').\n\nAs a special surprise for Burnett, Conway introduces a piano player and \u2013 when the curtain goes up \u2013 it is legendary screen actor [[James Stewart]] playing the piano and singing \"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\". Burnett, a lifelong fan of Stewart's, breaks down in tears and expresses how much she admires and loves him, and Stewart reciprocates by saying: \"Carol, I just feel so wonderful to be here, to be a part of all these millions of people to thank you for all the wonderful beautiful times you've given all of us, all of these eleven years.

Ruffin settled the strike very soon after his purchase in 1998. Soon after, the casino-hotel became known as the New Frontier. In 2005, Ruffin announced plans to demolish the New Frontier and replace it in 2005 with a new resort to be called [[List of Las Vegas casinos that never opened#Montreaux Resort|The Montreaux]], but the development never got off the ground.
