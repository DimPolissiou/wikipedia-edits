Take, for example, ''Pusher II'', which is a movie about a son [played by Mads Mikkelsen] who all his life wants his father's love, but realizes he needs to kill him to free the sins of the father from him. What plants the seed for him is realizing he has his own child, and the responsibility of that suddenly forces him to take action. And it's a happy ending, even though it's a dark ending, but for the character, it is what he was meant to become. It's almost like he achieved his true meaning. And ''Drive'' is similar in the sense that The Driver was meant to become a superhero, and he's denied all these things\u2014relationships, companionship. And why would he be denied that?

And after I did it on my first movie, I felt, 'How can you do a movie any other way?' It's like a painting\u2014you paint the movie as you go along, and I like the uncertainty of not knowing exactly how it's going to turn out.\"<ref name=\"Foundas\" /> Refn spoke more about shooting in chronological order in September 2011, in reference to ''Drive'':\n{{Quote|It's always difficult with production. All my films previous to ''Drive'' had been shot in what I call 100-percent almost-chronological order. Where ''Drive'' is like 80 percent. The reason why it didn't go 100 was that I just simply couldn't afford the last remaining pieces. I could afford what I call \"the emotional chronological order\". So nobody would die or leave the movie in the middle of their shooting schedule. It would always be the end. So there was a build-up as much as possible.<ref name=\"Tobias\" /> }}\nOn his approach to working with actors, Refn has said:\n{{Quote|I think the first thing I ask any actor is what they would like to do, which sometimes can frighten people or can be looked upon as, 'Oh, you don't know what you want.'  But I try to draw the actor in\u2014to force them in, in some cases, because a lot of actors don't want to discuss things or go in deep; they just want to come and do the work, play their part and walk away. But for me, it doesn't work like that. You've got to get absorbed and dirty, and a way to do that is to ask the actor what they would like to do. It also forces them to be more truthful.<ref name=\"Foundas\" /> }}\nRefn's [[color blindness]] has influenced his style: \"I can't see mid-colors.

Take, for example, ''Pusher II'', which is a movie about a son [played by Mads Mikkelsen] who all his life wants his father's love, but realizes he needs to kill him to free the sins of the father from him. What plants the seed for him is realizing he has his own child, and the responsibility of that suddenly forces him to take action. And it's a happy ending, even though it's a dark ending, but for the character, it is what he was meant to become. It's almost like he achieved his true meaning. And ''Drive'' is similar in the sense that The Driver was meant to become a superhero, and he's denied all these things\u2014relationships, companionship. And why would he be denied that? It was because he was meant for something greater.<ref name=\"Tobias\">{{cite web |last=Tobias |first=Scott |title=Nicolas Winding Refn |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/nicolas-winding-refn,61788/ |work=The A.V.

And after I did it on my first movie, I felt, 'How can you do a movie any other way?' It's like a painting\u2014you paint the movie as you go along, and I like the uncertainty of not knowing exactly how it's going to turn out.\"<ref name=\"Foundas\" /> Refn spoke more about shooting in chronological order in September 2011, in reference to ''Drive'':\n{{Quote|It's always difficult with production. All my films previous to ''Drive'' had been shot in what I call 100-percent almost-chronological order. Where ''Drive'' is like 80 percent. The reason why it didn't go 100 was that I just simply couldn't afford the last remaining pieces. I could afford what I call \"the emotional chronological order\". So nobody would die or leave the movie in the middle of their shooting schedule. It would always be the end. So there was a build-up as much as possible.<ref name=\"Tobias\" /> }}\nOn his approach to working with actors, Refn has said:\n{{Quote|I think the first thing I ask any actor is what they would like to do, which sometimes can frighten people or can be looked upon as, 'Oh, you don't know what you want.'  But I try to draw the actor in\u2014to force them in, in some cases, because a lot of actors don't want to discuss things or go in deep; they just want to come and do the work, play their part and walk away. But for me, it doesn't work like that. You've got to get absorbed and dirty, and a way to do that is to ask the actor what they would like to do. It also forces them to be more truthful.<ref name=\"Foundas\" /> }}\nRefn's [[color blindness]] has influenced his style: \"I can't see mid-colors.

An exception is that of [[Cantus C\u00f6lln]].\n\n\nBach typically had boys choirs available for his choral works. \n\nThe first of the motets to be recorded was [[Jesu, meine Freude, BWV 227|''Jesu meine Freude'']] in 1927.

He obtained his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]] at the [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]] of the [[University of Oxford]] in 1967. In 1972 he got a diploma in [[applied linguistics]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he obtained a [[PhD degree]] in 1977. His PhD thesis was entitled \"A Study of the Cloze Procedure with Native and Non-Native Speakers of English\", supervised by Dr Alan Davies.\n\nBetween 1969-1971 he was a lecturer in [[English language|English]] at the [[University of D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[West Germany]]. Between 1972 and 1974 he was British Council Lecturer in English at the [[University of Algiers]], [[Algeria]]. In 1974 he became the Coordinator of the English language testing\nservice at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He was also a Tutor MSc in Applied Linguistics until 1977. During his time at the University of Edinburgh he co-authored the English Proficiency Test Battery (EPTB) Version D. In 1977 he was appointed as the Head of Research and Development Unit, Modern Language Centre (CELE), [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM), [[Mexico City]]. In 1979 he became the Director of Testing, English Language Institute, [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]], Michigan, United States.\n\nHe was a [[Teaching Fellow]] (1980-1986) and the director (1985-1987) of the Institute for English Language Education, [[University of Lancaster]]. Between 1986 and 1989 he became Senior Teaching Fellow and Senior Lecturer (1989-1993). Since 1993 ha has been a Professor of Linguistics and English Language Education, at Lancaster University. Between 1994 and 1997 he also served as the Head of department at Lancaster University.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2000 he was also a [[British Council]] Adviser, [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]].\n\nOn 19 April 2017, Alderson along with Tineke Brunfaut, and [[Luke Harding (linguist)|Luke Harding]] were selected as the winner of the International Language Testing Association (ILTA) Best Article Award. The award-winning paper, Towards a Theory of Diagnosis in Second and Foreign Language Assessment: Insights from Professional Practice Across Diverse Fields, was published in 2015 in the journal [[Applied Linguistics (journal)|Applied Linguistics]]. The study investigated how diagnosis is theorized and carried out across a diverse range of professions with a view to finding commonalities that can be applied to the context of second and foreign language assessment. On the basis of interviews with professionals from fields such as car mechanics, IT systems support, medicine, psychology and education, a set of principles was drawn up to facilitate inform a comprehensive theory of diagnostic assessment in a second or foreign language.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Alderson, C., Brunfaut, T., & Harding, L.

Cordoba was a rich, sophisticated city with many fine houses, libraries, and bath houses.<ref>Hillenbrand, Robert. \"The Ornament of the World: Medieval Cordoba as a Cultural Centre\", ''The Legacy of Muslim Spain'', (Salma Khadra Jayyusi, ed.) leiden n.d., p. 119</ref> \"As Raguel wrote, Christians in Al-Andalus were converting to Islam in increasing numbers.

Before setting off, he consulted with Allen and found him \"full of reminiscence of several of the Dutch and Italian libraries I was aiming to visit.\" Allen cautioned him: \"On no account, my dear sir, drink the wine of Modena. Lambrusco they call it. Only fit for gondoliers\" (Douglas Young, ''Chasing an Ancient Greek: Discursive Reminiscences of an European Journey'' [London: Hollis & Carter, 1950], 9). Young provides a glimpse into what he and Allen faced: \"[M]any catalogues are defective or inaccurate, without indices, or with indices whose items stray from the order of the alphabet. Few things are more baffling than to peruse, in the hope of a reference to some part of the author one seeks, an unindexed account in Bulgarian of the manuscript collection of some Balkan monastery, which has subsequently been sacked by Greeks or Turks. It may prove that a famous library with hundreds of Greek manuscripts contains none of your particular pet. Then you find that in a collection of only two MSS. in a minor repository one is to your purpose. Whereupon you must confirm with the librarian whether the catalogue is right and the MS. still exists, or has been burned, stolen, or mislaid, the last a possibility of frequent occurrence\" (ibid., 2-3).

During the latter part of the decade he began a working relationship with [[David Monro (scholar)|David B. Monro]], a leading Homeric scholar and Provost of [[Oriel College, Oxford]].<ref group=note>Allen contributed a small sketch of Monro as a scholar: \"What distinguished Monro's Homeric work from that of other Englishmen of his generation was, in the first place, his knowledge of Comparative Grammar or Philology. When he began to write on Homer he was almost alone in this possession, and at his death there are few members of his own University who have a first-hand knowledge of Comparative Philology. ... In these matters his method was very much that of [[Aristarchus of Samothrace|Aristarchus]], who, so far as we can gather, did not admit a correction into the Vulgate of his day, unless diplomatic authority could be found for it. Monro, indeed, in many respects, resembled that most judicious of ancient critics. Besides this he was a great exegete, and had a sure knowledge both of Greek and of Homeric usage\" (John Cook Wilson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yjVOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q&f=false ''David Binning Monro: A Short Memoir''] [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1907], 15-16). Allen also contributed a couple of paragraphs to Monro's revised entry on Homer for the 11th ed. of the ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=xlAEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA632#v=onepage&q&f=false 17:626-39, at 631-32.]</ref> In 1896 Monro published his Homeric text [https://books.google.com/books?id=SCuyk4GVYqUC&pg=PP7#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Homeri Opera et reliquiae'',] which included the version of the Homeric Hymns that Allen had edited three years earlier. At the start of the next year, the Delegates of [[Oxford University Press]] announced \"a standard and uniform series\" of \"[[Oxford Classical Texts]]\", with the responsibility for Homer being assigned to Monro and Allen.<ref>''The Oxford Magazine'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=o1TnAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA145#v=onepage&q&f=false Vol. 15, No. 9 (27 Jan 1897), 145.]</ref> The fruit of their collaboration would be published five years later, a two-volume edition of the ''Iliad'', ''Homeri Opera'' I-II (1902). During this decade Allen was struggling financially, and as a result was forced to delay his wedding four years until 1894. Even then, after they moved into their new residence at 6 Canterbury Road, his wife's aunt and sister took part of the house and contributed towards expenses. Allen twice applied for more remunerative positions, first for the chair of Humanity at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1891 and then for the chair of Greek at the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1899, both of which he failed to obtain.<ref name=PBA /> Fortunately, he was appointed a visiting lecturer at [[Royal Holloway College]] in 1893, a position he held until 1918, and which would bring in additional monies.<ref>\"Notes and Summary.\" ''The Educational Times'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=CQynFZ76GJYC&pg=PA507#v=onepage&q&f=false Vol. 46, No. 392 (1 Dec 1893), 507.]</ref><ref>Bingham, Caroline (1987).

He brought out revised versions of his Oxford Classical Text of the ''[[Iliad]]'' (2nd ed., 1908; 3rd ed. 1920), the ''[[Odyssey]]'' (1st ed. 1908; 2nd ed. 1917/1919), and the [[Homeric Hymns]] (1912). He collaborated with E. E. Sikes, M.A., Fellow and Tutor of [[St John's College, Cambridge]], to bring out an edition of the Homeric Hymns (1904) with an English introduction and running commentary. He produced a similar edition (with commentary) of the [[Catalogue of Ships]] (1921), a catalog in Book 2 of Homer's ''Iliad'' (2.494-759), which lists the contingents of the Achaean army that sailed to Troy. Finally, in 1931 he published his ''edito maior'' of the ''Iliad,'' a three-volume work, with the first volume containing solely introductory materials (in English). All of his editions of Homer were praised at the time and were the products of years of labour, but they have subsequently been criticized; [[Nigel Guy Wilson|Nigel Wilson]] has suggested that his \"classification of the ''Iliad'' manuscripts was essentially flawed ... There is so much inaccuracy in what Allen states ... that one cannot trust him at all\".<ref name=PBA /><ref name=\"DBC\" /> Despite this criticism, they remain in print as the official Oxford edition. His only [[monograph]] was ''Homer: The Origins and the Transmission'' (1924), a collection of his more important articles, revised and augmented. In the preface he offers a frank assessment: \"Time was when I intended to write a book on Homer, a continuous book which should cover the whole subject and solve the whole question\u2014his age, personality, method, theme ... As time went on I was discouraged by the failure, so it seemed to me, of my contemporaries, English and foreign, and by the discovery of my own incapacity. I should like to put this last down to the drawbacks of the teaching profession (which are real) and the tutor's rusty pen. But I cannot conceal from myself that I might have overcome these obstacles had I been more of what literary people call in their own case a creative artist\" (p.&nbsp;5). He was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] in 1922.<ref name=DNB />\n\nAllen was a very conservative text critic. Two years after his publication of Goodwin's edition, he offered a \"sequel\" that was to provide the text-critical principles he had followed. He first characterizes the efforts of earlier editors: \"The Greek classics have been read, studied, and edited for above four hundred years; the simple and easy corrections that the early editors, Greeks and Italians, made in their texts have been followed by the more learned but of necessity less and less certain attempts of Frenchmen, Dutchmen, Germans, English, who have provided every ancient writer with an accumulation of alternative readings which exceeds in bulk his own words.\" He then offers his own criteria for textual emendation: \"To lay down the canons that determine a good emendation is not an easy task. I will content myself with stating one principle, not the only one, but that which is in most danger of being overlooked, namely, that no emendation is certain the passing of which into the actual documentary reading cannot be explained according to recognized graphical laws. If this condition be unfulfilled, not the most brilliant or witty substitute for the text can be accepted. The datum, the evidence given by the MSS., is that from which we start, and to which we come back; to depart therefrom is to compose, to rewrite the author, to write better than the author. We are tied by the document, and within the radius of graphical change about it lies the field for our invention.\"<ref>Allen, T. W. (1895). \"The Text of the Homeric Hymns.\" ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' [https://archive.org/details/journalofhelleni15soci/page/136 15:137.]</ref><ref group=note>Allen really did not change his views on textual emendation, for in his last, posthumously-published piece concerning the text of [[Theognis]] he wrote: \"Critics who had no conception of what a poet's thoughts and feelings are, what he puts into verse and how he puts it, have both misunderstood Theognis and made monstrous alterations in this text. He has been, like practically all Greek authors, the prey of insufferable busybodies, people who cannot leave well alone, and who, starting from a small knowledge of Greek and none of the world, have pawed our texts over till what we read is more German and Dutch than the language they profess\" (\"Theognis, ed. Diehl 1936\". ''Revue de Philologie'' 76 (1950): 135-36).</ref>\n\n==Personal==\nAllen married Laura Charlotte Hope, the eldest daughter of [[William Hope (VC)|William Hope]], a recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]] for bravery during the [[Crimean War]], and his wife Margaret Graham. They were engaged on 27 February 1890, a couple of months after they had met in [[Florence]], but would not marry until 1894. They had one child, a daughter, Charlotte Allen, born in 1896. Mrs. Allen would become a devoted member of the newly formed [[Christian Science]] movement, which had only begun to hold public services in London the year that Charlotte was born. It is not clear what T. W. Allen's religious beliefs were, but apparently he was never baptized, a neglect that apparently cost him a Studentship at [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref name=PBA /> Unfortunately, it was his wife's adherence to the tenets of the new healing faith from America that resulted in the great disaster of his life. In December 1919, twenty-three-year-old Charlotte became critically ill and died, the tragic result of following the rule to not seek medical help for illness.<ref group=note>From 1898 till the start of World War I, there were a number of cases of \"death by Christian Science,\" which came before coroners and sometimes went to court, though no practitioner was ever convicted. These cases were reported both in medical journals and the popular press. For details, see Claire F. Gartrell-Mills, \"Christian Science: an American Religion in Britain, 1895 - 1940\" (Ph.D. diss., Oxford, 1991), 210-30. One of the earliest notices in the [[The BMJ|British Medical Journal]] tried to sound a warning: \"The occurrence in quick succession of two inquests on persons who have died under the so-called 'Christian Science' treatment, has probably made known to many people for the first time the existence in our midst of a system of quackery at once more foolish and more pernicious than any of the many follies and frauds which flourish in rank luxuriance on the 'eternal gullible' in man ... [T]he fact that such a farrago of nonsense is taken seriously by people of education and intelligence almost makes us despair of human progress\" (\"Christian Science: What It Is,\" ''BMJ'' [https://archive.org/details/1898britishmedic02brit/page/1515 1898, vol. 2, 1515-16]).</ref> It was a loss from which he never fully recovered.<ref name=DNB /> Laura Allen died on March 25, 1936, at Oxford.

Lambrusco they call it. Only fit for gondoliers\" (Douglas Young, ''Chasing an Ancient Greek: Discursive Reminiscences of an European Journey'' [London: Hollis & Carter, 1950], 9). Young provides a glimpse into what he and Allen faced: \"[M]any catalogues are defective or inaccurate, without indices, or with indices whose items stray from the order of the alphabet. Few things are more baffling than to peruse, in the hope of a reference to some part of the author one seeks, an unindexed account in Bulgarian of the manuscript collection of some Balkan monastery, which has subsequently been sacked by Greeks or Turks. It may prove that a famous library with hundreds of Greek manuscripts contains none of your particular pet. Then you find that in a collection of only two MSS. in a minor repository one is to your purpose. Whereupon you must confirm with the librarian whether the catalogue is right and the MS. still exists, or has been burned, stolen, or mislaid, the last a possibility of frequent occurrence\" (ibid., 2-3).

During the latter part of the decade he began a working relationship with [[David Monro (scholar)|David B. Monro]], a leading Homeric scholar and Provost of [[Oriel College, Oxford]].<ref group=note>Allen contributed a small sketch of Monro as a scholar: \"What distinguished Monro's Homeric work from that of other Englishmen of his generation was, in the first place, his knowledge of Comparative Grammar or Philology. When he began to write on Homer he was almost alone in this possession, and at his death there are few members of his own University who have a first-hand knowledge of Comparative Philology. ... In these matters his method was very much that of [[Aristarchus of Samothrace|Aristarchus]], who, so far as we can gather, did not admit a correction into the Vulgate of his day, unless diplomatic authority could be found for it. Monro, indeed, in many respects, resembled that most judicious of ancient critics. Besides this he was a great exegete, and had a sure knowledge both of Greek and of Homeric usage\" (John Cook Wilson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yjVOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q&f=false ''David Binning Monro: A Short Memoir''] [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1907], 15-16). Allen also contributed a couple of paragraphs to Monro's revised entry on Homer for the 11th ed. of the ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=xlAEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA632#v=onepage&q&f=false 17:626-39, at 631-32.]</ref> In 1896 Monro published his Homeric text [https://books.google.com/books?id=SCuyk4GVYqUC&pg=PP7#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Homeri Opera et reliquiae'',] which included the version of the Homeric Hymns that Allen had edited three years earlier. At the start of the next year, the Delegates of [[Oxford University Press]] announced \"a standard and uniform series\" of \"[[Oxford Classical Texts]]\", with the responsibility for Homer being assigned to Monro and Allen.<ref>''The Oxford Magazine'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=o1TnAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA145#v=onepage&q&f=false Vol. 15, No. 9 (27 Jan 1897), 145.]</ref> The fruit of their collaboration would be published five years later, a two-volume edition of the ''Iliad'', ''Homeri Opera'' I-II (1902). During this decade Allen was struggling financially, and as a result was forced to delay his wedding four years until 1894. Even then, after they moved into their new residence at 6 Canterbury Road, his wife's aunt and sister took part of the house and contributed towards expenses. Allen twice applied for more remunerative positions, first for the chair of Humanity at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1891 and then for the chair of Greek at the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1899, both of which he failed to obtain.<ref name=PBA /> Fortunately, he was appointed a visiting lecturer at [[Royal Holloway College]] in 1893, a position he held until 1918, and which would bring in additional monies.<ref>\"Notes and Summary.\" ''The Educational Times'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=CQynFZ76GJYC&pg=PA507#v=onepage&q&f=false Vol. 46, No. 392 (1 Dec 1893), 507.]</ref><ref>Bingham, Caroline (1987).

He brought out revised versions of his Oxford Classical Text of the ''[[Iliad]]'' (2nd ed., 1908; 3rd ed. 1920), the ''[[Odyssey]]'' (1st ed. 1908; 2nd ed. 1917/1919), and the [[Homeric Hymns]] (1912). He collaborated with E. E. Sikes, M.A., Fellow and Tutor of [[St John's College, Cambridge]], to bring out an edition of the Homeric Hymns (1904) with an English introduction and running commentary. He produced a similar edition (with commentary) of the [[Catalogue of Ships]] (1921), a catalog in Book 2 of Homer's ''Iliad'' (2.494-759), which lists the contingents of the Achaean army that sailed to Troy. Finally, in 1931 he published his ''edito maior'' of the ''Iliad,'' a three-volume work, with the first volume containing solely introductory materials (in English). All of his editions of Homer were praised at the time and were the products of years of labour, but they have subsequently been criticized; [[Nigel Guy Wilson|Nigel Wilson]] has suggested that his \"classification of the ''Iliad'' manuscripts was essentially flawed ... There is so much inaccuracy in what Allen states ... that one cannot trust him at all\".<ref name=PBA /><ref name=\"DBC\" /> Despite this criticism, they remain in print as the official Oxford edition. His only [[monograph]] was ''Homer: The Origins and the Transmission'' (1924), a collection of his more important articles, revised and augmented. In the preface he offers a frank assessment: \"Time was when I intended to write a book on Homer, a continuous book which should cover the whole subject and solve the whole question\u2014his age, personality, method, theme ... As time went on I was discouraged by the failure, so it seemed to me, of my contemporaries, English and foreign, and by the discovery of my own incapacity. I should like to put this last down to the drawbacks of the teaching profession (which are real) and the tutor's rusty pen. But I cannot conceal from myself that I might have overcome these obstacles had I been more of what literary people call in their own case a creative artist\" (p.&nbsp;5). He was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] in 1922.<ref name=DNB />\n\nAllen was a very conservative text critic. Two years after his publication of Goodwin's edition, he offered a \"sequel\" that was to provide the text-critical principles he had followed. He first characterizes the efforts of earlier editors: \"The Greek classics have been read, studied, and edited for above four hundred years; the simple and easy corrections that the early editors, Greeks and Italians, made in their texts have been followed by the more learned but of necessity less and less certain attempts of Frenchmen, Dutchmen, Germans, English, who have provided every ancient writer with an accumulation of alternative readings which exceeds in bulk his own words.\" He then offers his own criteria for textual emendation: \"To lay down the canons that determine a good emendation is not an easy task. I will content myself with stating one principle, not the only one, but that which is in most danger of being overlooked, namely, that no emendation is certain the passing of which into the actual documentary reading cannot be explained according to recognized graphical laws. If this condition be unfulfilled, not the most brilliant or witty substitute for the text can be accepted. The datum, the evidence given by the MSS., is that from which we start, and to which we come back; to depart therefrom is to compose, to rewrite the author, to write better than the author. We are tied by the document, and within the radius of graphical change about it lies the field for our invention.\"<ref>Allen, T. W. (1895). \"The Text of the Homeric Hymns.\" ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' [https://archive.org/details/journalofhelleni15soci/page/136 15:137.]</ref><ref group=note>Allen really did not change his views on textual emendation, for in his last, posthumously-published piece concerning the text of [[Theognis]] he wrote: \"Critics who had no conception of what a poet's thoughts and feelings are, what he puts into verse and how he puts it, have both misunderstood Theognis and made monstrous alterations in this text. He has been, like practically all Greek authors, the prey of insufferable busybodies, people who cannot leave well alone, and who, starting from a small knowledge of Greek and none of the world, have pawed our texts over till what we read is more German and Dutch than the language they profess\" (\"Theognis, ed. Diehl 1936\".

They were engaged on 27 February 1890, a couple of months after they had met in [[Florence]], but would not marry until 1894. They had one child, a daughter, Charlotte Allen, born in 1896. Mrs. Allen would become a devoted member of the newly formed [[Christian Science]] movement, which had only begun to hold public services in London the year that Charlotte was born. It is not clear what T. W. Allen's religious beliefs were, but apparently he was never baptized, a neglect that apparently cost him a Studentship at [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref name=PBA /> Unfortunately, it was his wife's adherence to the tenets of the new healing faith from America that resulted in the great disaster of his life. In December 1919, twenty-three-year-old Charlotte became critically ill and died, the tragic result of following the rule to not seek medical help for illness.<ref group=note>From 1898 till the start of World War I, there were a number of cases of \"death by Christian Science,\" which came before coroners and sometimes went to court, though no practitioner was ever convicted. These cases were reported both in medical journals and the popular press. For details, see Claire F. Gartrell-Mills, \"Christian Science: an American Religion in Britain, 1895 - 1940\" (Ph.D. diss., Oxford, 1991), 210-30. One of the earliest notices in the [[The BMJ|British Medical Journal]] tried to sound a warning: \"The occurrence in quick succession of two inquests on persons who have died under the so-called 'Christian Science' treatment, has probably made known to many people for the first time the existence in our midst of a system of quackery at once more foolish and more pernicious than any of the many follies and frauds which flourish in rank luxuriance on the 'eternal gullible' in man ... [T]he fact that such a farrago of nonsense is taken seriously by people of education and intelligence almost makes us despair of human progress\" (\"Christian Science: What It Is,\" ''BMJ'' [https://archive.org/details/1898britishmedic02brit/page/1515 1898, vol. 2, 1515-16]).</ref> It was a loss from which he never fully recovered.<ref name=DNB /> Laura Allen died on March 25, 1936, at Oxford.
