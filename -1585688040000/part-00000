According to the 2013 survey, Iran had 18 million gamers between the ages of three and forty. Caf\u00e9 Bazaar is increasingly looking towards games to drive future revenue.

Currently, thousands of film and television programs are provided on the platform, including all popular Iranian titles, in addition to an IPTV channel for kids.\n\n== Financial Transactions ==\nAs mobile games got more popular in Iran, Cafe Bazaar allowed In-App purchases with debit cards for popular foreign Android games. This is especially important as e-commerce is very popular in Iran and Debit Cards are the preferred system of payment. By 2015, 20% of Iranians reported shopping daily using their debit card, 24% weekly, and 28% on a monthly basis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2016/04/03/as-sanctions-lift-western-companies-can-meet-a-thriving-iranian-e-commerce-industry/|title=As sanctions lift, Western companies can meet a thriving Iranian e-commerce industry|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref> As of 2016, Machinarium, Clash of Kings, Brothers in Arms 3, March of Empires, Township, King's Empire and other world renown titles were participating in this mechanism.

According to the 2013 survey, Iran had 18 million gamers between the ages of three and forty. Caf\u00e9 Bazaar is increasingly looking towards games to drive future revenue. Chinese developers have already staked a prominent position in the games offered by Cafe Bazaar.

The new service, at its inception, largely focused on the 2018 World Cup. After that, the video content was diversified on the platform with the help of other content providers. Currently, thousands of film and television programs are provided on the platform, including all popular Iranian titles, in addition to an IPTV channel for kids.\n\n== Financial Transactions ==\nAs mobile games got more popular in Iran, Cafe Bazaar allowed In-App purchases with debit cards for popular foreign Android games. This is especially important as e-commerce is very popular in Iran and Debit Cards are the preferred system of payment. By 2015, 20% of Iranians reported shopping daily using their debit card, 24% weekly, and 28% on a monthly basis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2016/04/03/as-sanctions-lift-western-companies-can-meet-a-thriving-iranian-e-commerce-industry/|title=As sanctions lift, Western companies can meet a thriving Iranian e-commerce industry|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref> As of 2016, Machinarium, Clash of Kings, Brothers in Arms 3, March of Empires, Township, King's Empire and other world renown titles were participating in this mechanism.

[[Impact crater]]s on [[Mars]] larger than 1&nbsp;km exist by the hundreds of thousands, but only about one thousand of them have names.<ref name=\"Gazetteer-Mars-Craterlist\" /> Names are assigned by the [[International Astronomical Union]] after petitioning by relevant scientists, and in general, only craters that have a significant research interest are given names. Martian craters are named after famous scientists and [[science fiction]] authors, or if less than 60&nbsp;km in diameter, after towns on [[Earth]]. Craters cannot be named for living people, and names for small craters are rarely intended to commemorate a specific town.<ref name=\"Gazetteer-Categories\" /> Latitude and longitude are given as planetographic coordinates with west longitude.\n\n== Catalog of named craters ==\n\nThe catalog is divided into three partial lists:\n* [[List of craters on Mars: A\u2013G]]\n* [[List of craters on Mars: H\u2013N]]\n* [[List of craters on Mars: O\u2013Z]]\n\nNames are grouped into tables for each letter of the alphabet, containing the crater's name (linked if article exists), coordinates, diameter in kilometers, year of official name adoption (approval), the [[eponym]] (\"named after\") and a direct reference to the ''Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature''.<ref name=\"Gazetteer-Mars-Craterlist\" />\n\n{{Compact ToC\n |side=no\n |name=List of craters on Mars\n |a=[[List of craters on Mars: A\u2013G#A|A]]\n |b=[[List of craters on Mars: A\u2013G#B|B]]\n |c=[[List of craters on Mars: A\u2013G#C|C]]\n |d=[[List of craters on Mars: A\u2013G#D|D]]\n |e=[[List of craters on Mars: A\u2013G#E|E]]\n |f=[[List of craters on Mars: A\u2013G#F|F]]\n |g=[[List of craters on Mars: A\u2013G#G|G]]\n |h=[[List of craters on Mars: H\u2013N#H|H]]\n |i=[[List of craters on Mars: H\u2013N#I|I]]\n |j=[[List of craters on Mars: H\u2013N#J|J]]\n |k=[[List of craters on Mars: H\u2013N#K|K]]\n |l=[[List of craters on Mars: H\u2013N#L|L]]\n |m=[[List of craters on Mars: H\u2013N#M|M]]\n |n=[[List of craters on Mars: H\u2013N#N|N]]\n |o=[[List of craters on Mars: O\u2013Z#O|O]]\n |p=[[List of craters on Mars: O\u2013Z#P|P]]\n |q=[[List of craters on Mars: O\u2013Z#Q|Q]]\n |r=[[List of craters on Mars: O\u2013Z#R|R]]\n |s=[[List of craters on Mars: O\u2013Z#S|S]]\n |t=[[List of craters on Mars: O\u2013Z#T|T]]\n |u=[[List of craters on Mars: O\u2013Z#U|U]]\n |v=[[List of craters on Mars: O\u2013Z#V|V]]\n |w=[[List of craters on Mars: O\u2013Z#W|W]]\n |x=[[List of craters on Mars: O\u2013Z#X|X]]\n |y=[[List of craters on Mars: O\u2013Z#Y|Y]]\n |z=[[List of craters on Mars: O\u2013Z#Z|Z]]\n}}\n\n== Statistics ==\n\nAs of 2017, Martian craters account for 21% of all 5,211 named craters in the [[Solar System]]. Apart from the [[Moon]], no other body has as many named craters as Mars. Other, non-planetary bodies with numerous named craters include [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] ([[List of craters on Callisto|141]]), [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] ([[List of craters on Ganymede|131]]), [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]] (128), [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] (90), [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] (90), [[Dione (moon)|Dione]] (73), [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]] (58), [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] (53), [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]] (50) and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] ([[List of craters on Europa|41]]).

Many parts of the world have access to a surplus of non-nutritious food, in addition to increased sedentary lifestyles. Yale psychologist Kelly Brownell calls this a \"[[toxic food environment]]\" where fat and sugar laden foods have taken precedence over healthy nutritious foods.<ref name=\"Gardner00\" />\n\nThe issue in these developed countries is choosing the right kind of food. More fast food is consumed per capita in the United States than in any other country. The reason for this mass consumption of fast food is its affordability and accessibility. Often fast food, low in cost and nutrition, is high in calories and heavily promoted. When these eating habits are combined with increasingly urbanized, automated, and more sedentary lifestyles, it becomes clear why weight gain is difficult to avoid.<ref name=\"Gardner00_5\">{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Gary|last2=Halweil|first2=Brian|year=2000|title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488|journal=World Watch|volume=13|issue=4|page=5|access-date=September 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112195527/http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488|archive-date=January 12, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nNot only does obesity occur in developed countries, problems are also occurring in developing countries in areas where income is on the rise.<ref name=\"Gardner00\" /> Overeating is also a problem in countries where hunger and poverty persist.

Throughout history, various peoples have known the importance of eating certain foods to prevent the outbreak of symptoms now associated with malnutrition. Yet such knowledge appears to have been repeatedly lost and then re-discovered. For example, the symptoms of [[scurvy]] were reportedly known to the ancient Egyptians. Anti-scurvy measures were sometimes undertook by 14th century [[Crusades|Crusaders]], who would ensure that citrus fruits were planted on Mediterranean islands, for use on sea journeys. Knowledge of the importance of such measures appears to have been forgotten by Europeans for several centuries, to be rediscovered in the 18th century.In the early 19th century the British navy ensured their ship's crews were given frequent rations of lemon juice, massively reducing deaths from scurvy and giving the British a significant advantage in the [[Napoleonic wars]]. Later in the 19th century, the British navy replaced lemons with limes, not aware at the time that limes were much less effective than lemons at preventing scurvy.<ref name=\"Ruxin\">{{Cite web|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1317860/1/288630.pdf|title=Hunger, Science, and Politics: FAO, WHO, and Unicef Nutrition Policies, 1945-1978|publisher= [[University College London]]|date=1996|author=Joshua Ruxin|accessdate=January 12, 2019|author-link=Josh Ruxin}}</ref><ref name = \"HungerModHist\">{{cite book|author= James Vernon|title= Hunger: A Modern History|pages= [https://archive.org/details/hungermodernhist00vern_0/page/81 81\u2013140, ''passim'']|year= 2007|isbn= 978-0-674-02678-0|publisher= [[Harvard University Press]]|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/hungermodernhist00vern_0/page/81}}</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Michael Worboys, it was between the wars that malnutrition was essentially discovered, and the science of nutrition established. This built on work such as [[Casimir Funk]]'s 1912 formulisation of the concept of vitamins. There was increased scientific study of malnutrition in the 1920s and 1930s, and this became even more pronounced after world war 2. Charities and United Nations agencies would devote considerable energy to alleviating malnutrition around the world. The exact methods and priorities for doing this tended to fluctuate over the years, with varying levels of focus on different types of malnutrition like [[Kwashiorkor]] or [[Marasmus]]; varying levels of concern on protein deficiency compared to vitamins, minerals and lack of raw calories; and varying priorities given to the problem of malnutrition in general compared to other health and development concerns.

Yale psychologist Kelly Brownell calls this a \"[[toxic food environment]]\" where fat and sugar laden foods have taken precedence over healthy nutritious foods.<ref name=\"Gardner00\" />\n\nThe issue in these developed countries is choosing the right kind of food. More fast food is consumed per capita in the United States than in any other country. The reason for this mass consumption of fast food is its affordability and accessibility. Often fast food, low in cost and nutrition, is high in calories and heavily promoted. When these eating habits are combined with increasingly urbanized, automated, and more sedentary lifestyles, it becomes clear why weight gain is difficult to avoid.<ref name=\"Gardner00_5\">{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Gary|last2=Halweil|first2=Brian|year=2000|title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488|journal=World Watch|volume=13|issue=4|page=5|access-date=September 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112195527/http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488|archive-date=January 12, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nNot only does obesity occur in developed countries, problems are also occurring in developing countries in areas where income is on the rise.<ref name=\"Gardner00\" /> Overeating is also a problem in countries where hunger and poverty persist.

Throughout history, various peoples have known the importance of eating certain foods to prevent the outbreak of symptoms now associated with malnutrition. Yet such knowledge appears to have been repeatedly lost and then re-discovered. For example, the symptoms of [[scurvy]] were reportedly known to the ancient Egyptians. Anti-scurvy measures were sometimes undertook by 14th century [[Crusades|Crusaders]], who would ensure that citrus fruits were planted on Mediterranean islands, for use on sea journeys. Knowledge of the importance of such measures appears to have been forgotten by Europeans for several centuries, to be rediscovered in the 18th century.In the early 19th century the British navy ensured their ship's crews were given frequent rations of lemon juice, massively reducing deaths from scurvy and giving the British a significant advantage in the [[Napoleonic wars]]. Later in the 19th century, the British navy replaced lemons with limes, not aware at the time that limes were much less effective than lemons at preventing scurvy.<ref name=\"Ruxin\">{{Cite web|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1317860/1/288630.pdf|title=Hunger, Science, and Politics: FAO, WHO, and Unicef Nutrition Policies, 1945-1978|publisher= [[University College London]]|date=1996|author=Joshua Ruxin|accessdate=January 12, 2019|author-link=Josh Ruxin}}</ref><ref name = \"HungerModHist\">{{cite book|author= James Vernon|title= Hunger: A Modern History|pages= [https://archive.org/details/hungermodernhist00vern_0/page/81 81\u2013140, ''passim'']|year= 2007|isbn= 978-0-674-02678-0|publisher= [[Harvard University Press]]|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/hungermodernhist00vern_0/page/81}}</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Michael Worboys, it was between the wars that malnutrition was essentially discovered, and the science of nutrition established. This built on work such as [[Casimir Funk]]'s 1912 formulisation of the concept of vitamins. There was increased scientific study of malnutrition in the 1920s and 1930s, and this became even more pronounced after world war 2. Charities and United Nations agencies would devote considerable energy to alleviating malnutrition around the world. The exact methods and priorities for doing this tended to fluctuate over the years, with varying levels of focus on different types of malnutrition like [[Kwashiorkor]] or [[Marasmus]]; varying levels of concern on protein deficiency compared to vitamins, minerals and lack of raw calories; and varying priorities given to the problem of malnutrition in general compared to other health and development concerns.

In January 2007, Jobs renamed the company Apple Inc., reflecting its shifted focus toward consumer electronics, and launched the [[iPhone]] to great critical acclaim and financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and [[Tim Cook]] became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company.

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], a Swiss linguist and [[semiotician]], created a semiotic model that identifies two parts of a sign: the [[signified and signifier]]. The signifier is the perceptual component that we physically see, and the signified is then the concept which the sign refers to. In Saussure\u2019s model, the sign results from the recognition of a sound or object with a concept. In his model, the signified and signifier are \u201cas inseparable as two sides of a piece of paper\".<ref name=Chandler>{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Daniel|title=Semiotics: The Basics|date=2018|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|edition=3rd}}</ref> The second popular semiotic model that exists is the Peircean Model. [[Charles Sanders Pierce]] was a logician. His model, like Saussure\u2019s model, involved the relationship between the elements of signs and objects. However, the Peircean model added that whoever is decoding the sign must have some previous understanding or knowledge about the transmitted message.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Parmentier |first1=Richard |title=Signs in society: Studies in semiotic anthropology |date=1994 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0253327571}}</ref> Peirce\u2019s model can be represented using the three sides of triangle: the [[representamen]] (the sign), an object (what the sign represents), and the [[interpretant]] (the produced effect by the sign).<ref name=Chandler/>\n\nThe symbolic representation that a [[brand]] carries can affect how a [[consumer]] \u201crecalls, internalizes, and relates\u201d to the performance of a company. There is plenty of evidence to show that a company can easily fail if they do not keep track of how the brand changes with the [[media culture]]. Semiotic research can be used to help a company relate to their customer\u2019s culture over time and help their brand to stand out in competitive markets <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oswald |first1=L. |title=The structural semiotics paradigm for marketing research: theory, methodology, and case analysis. |journal=Semiotica |date=2015 |volume=205 |doi= 10.1515/sem-2015-0005}}</ref>.\n\nThe first two Apple logos are drastically different from each other. However, they both share the sign of an apple. In the original logo designed by [[Ronald Wayne]], [[Sir Isaac Newton]] is seen sitting under the infamous apple tree about to bear fruit above, just before his discovery of gravity. When one analyzes the [[semiotics]] with Saussure\u2019s model, the signified, or sign, is the apple. The signifier represents discovery, innovation, and the notion of thought.<ref name=SlideShare>{{cite web|last1=Rohan|first1=R.|title=Semiotics Analysis of Apple Inc.

The company\u2019s mission was, and still is, to simplify technology for the everyday life. A fun and clever logo that spoke to computer-savvy people was needed. In 1977, [[Rob Janoff]] created the iconic rainbow apple symbol that is still recognized today. The logo had double meaning and differed from the many serious logos in existence at the time <ref>{{cite book |last1=Linzmayer, O. |first1=Owen |title=Apple confidential 2.0: The definitive history of the world\u2019s most colorful company. |date=2004 |publisher=No Starch Press |isbn=1593270100 |edition=2nd}}</ref>.\n\nApple Inc. is well known for being an innovative company who challenge the status quo and established standards. Again, using Saussure\u2019s semiotic model, the signified, is an apple, but with a bite taken out of it. Because Apple is seen as a \u201cchallenger\u201d in the industry, the most common signifier is the forbidden fruit from the Biblical reference, the Garden of Eden.<ref name=Cowin>{{cite web|last1=Cowin|first1=E.|title=The evolution of U.S. corporate logos a semiotic analysis|url=http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3024&context=etd|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> The signified is the bite from the apple, and the represented signifier is the tree of knowledge. Thus, symbolizing Apple as a \u201crebellious young company\u201d ready to challenge the world.<ref name=SlideShare/> An even further semiotic analysis is that Adam and Eve gained a great deal of knowledge after the apple was bitten. So, the bitten apple is a sign for the \u201cpromise of knowledge\u201d that an Apple user may gain from the product.\n\nThe [[semiotics]] of the bite and the color of the logo can also be looked at from a technologic viewpoint. The bite is the [[signified]] and the computer storage unit, [[byte]], is the [[signifier]]. The rainbow color of the logo portrays the message that the its [[computer monitor]] could be produce color images.<ref name=SlideShare/> [[Steve Jobs]] also argued that color was crucial for \u201chumanizing the company\u201d at that time.<ref name=Cowin/>\n\nThe only thing to change with the logo since 1977 has been the color. In 1998, a [[monochromatic]] logo was implemented with the release of the first [[iMac]]. This was the first Mac to not have the iconic rainbow-colored apple since its creation 20 years prior.<ref name=Biricik>{{cite web|last1=Biricik|first1=Asli|title=The role of logo design in creating brand emotion: A semiotic comparison of the Apple and IBM logos|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.427.5285&rep=rep1&type=pdf|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> The new look was the future or new era of Apple Inc.

[...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success\". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the \"excitement of revolution\", but argues that people want \"the comfort that comes with harmony\".

Whereas [[Google]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] make use of [[big data]] and analyze customer information to personalize results, Apple has a strong [[Apple Inc.#Privacy stance|pro-privacy stance]], intentionally not retaining user data. \"Siri is a textbook of [[iPhone|leading on something in tech]] and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley\", Holger Mueller, a technology analyst, told the ''Journal''. The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors, a lack of ambitious goals, and shifting strategies. Though switching Siri's functions to [[machine learning]] and [[algorithm]]s, which dramatically cut its error rate, the company reportedly still failed to anticipate the popularity of Amazon's [[Amazon Echo|Echo]], which features the [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] personal assistant. Improvements to Siri stalled, executives clashed, and there were disagreements over the restrictions imposed on third-party app interactions.

It was incorporated as '''Apple Computer, Inc.''', in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the [[Apple II]], grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple [[initial public offering|went public]] in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative [[graphical user interface]]s, such as the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee,<ref name=\"wozemployee\">{{Cite news |url= http://woz.org/letters/never-left-apple/ |title= I Never Left Apple |date= January 3, 2018 |work= Officially Woz |access-date= October 2, 2018 |language= en-US}}</ref> while Jobs and others resigned to found [[NeXT]].<ref name=\"rice19850415\" />\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s, Apple lost market share to the lower-priced duopoly of [[Microsoft Windows]] on [[Intel]] PC clones. The board recruited [[CEO]] [[Gil Amelio]] to what would be a 500-day charge for him to rehabilitate the financially troubled company\u2014reshaping it with layoffs, executive restructuring, and product focus. In 1997, he led Apple to buy NeXT, solving the desperately failed operating system strategy and bringing Jobs back. Jobs pensively regained leadership status, becoming CEO in 2000. Apple swiftly returned to profitability under the revitalizing [[Think different]] campaign, as he rebuilt Apple's status by launching the [[iMac G3|iMac]] in 1998, opening the retail chain of [[Apple Store]]s in 2001, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the software portfolio. In January 2007, Jobs renamed the company Apple Inc., reflecting its shifted focus toward consumer electronics, and launched the [[iPhone]] to great critical acclaim and financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and [[Tim Cook]] became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company. In June 2019, [[Jony Ive]], Apple's [[Chief design officer|CDO]], left the company to start his own firm but stated he would work with Apple as its primary client.\n\nApple is well known for its size and revenues.

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], a Swiss linguist and [[semiotician]], created a semiotic model that identifies two parts of a sign: the [[signified and signifier]]. The signifier is the perceptual component that we physically see, and the signified is then the concept which the sign refers to. In Saussure\u2019s model, the sign results from the recognition of a sound or object with a concept. In his model, the signified and signifier are \u201cas inseparable as two sides of a piece of paper\".<ref name=Chandler>{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Daniel|title=Semiotics: The Basics|date=2018|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|edition=3rd}}</ref> The second popular semiotic model that exists is the Peircean Model. [[Charles Sanders Pierce]] was a logician. His model, like Saussure\u2019s model, involved the relationship between the elements of signs and objects. However, the Peircean model added that whoever is decoding the sign must have some previous understanding or knowledge about the transmitted message.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Parmentier |first1=Richard |title=Signs in society: Studies in semiotic anthropology |date=1994 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0253327571}}</ref> Peirce\u2019s model can be represented using the three sides of triangle: the [[representamen]] (the sign), an object (what the sign represents), and the [[interpretant]] (the produced effect by the sign).<ref name=Chandler/>\n\nThe symbolic representation that a [[brand]] carries can affect how a [[consumer]] \u201crecalls, internalizes, and relates\u201d to the performance of a company. There is plenty of evidence to show that a company can easily fail if they do not keep track of how the brand changes with the [[media culture]]. Semiotic research can be used to help a company relate to their customer\u2019s culture over time and help their brand to stand out in competitive markets <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oswald |first1=L. |title=The structural semiotics paradigm for marketing research: theory, methodology, and case analysis. |journal=Semiotica |date=2015 |volume=205 |doi= 10.1515/sem-2015-0005}}</ref>.\n\nThe first two Apple logos are drastically different from each other. However, they both share the sign of an apple. In the original logo designed by [[Ronald Wayne]], [[Sir Isaac Newton]] is seen sitting under the infamous apple tree about to bear fruit above, just before his discovery of gravity. When one analyzes the [[semiotics]] with Saussure\u2019s model, the signified, or sign, is the apple. The signifier represents discovery, innovation, and the notion of thought.<ref name=SlideShare>{{cite web|last1=Rohan|first1=R.|title=Semiotics Analysis of Apple Inc.

The company\u2019s mission was, and still is, to simplify technology for the everyday life. A fun and clever logo that spoke to computer-savvy people was needed. In 1977, [[Rob Janoff]] created the iconic rainbow apple symbol that is still recognized today. The logo had double meaning and differed from the many serious logos in existence at the time <ref>{{cite book |last1=Linzmayer, O. |first1=Owen |title=Apple confidential 2.0: The definitive history of the world\u2019s most colorful company. |date=2004 |publisher=No Starch Press |isbn=1593270100 |edition=2nd}}</ref>.\n\nApple Inc. is well known for being an innovative company who challenge the status quo and established standards. Again, using Saussure\u2019s semiotic model, the signified, is an apple, but with a bite taken out of it. Because Apple is seen as a \u201cchallenger\u201d in the industry, the most common signifier is the forbidden fruit from the Biblical reference, the Garden of Eden.<ref name=Cowin>{{cite web|last1=Cowin|first1=E.|title=The evolution of U.S. corporate logos a semiotic analysis|url=http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3024&context=etd|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> The signified is the bite from the apple, and the represented signifier is the tree of knowledge. Thus, symbolizing Apple as a \u201crebellious young company\u201d ready to challenge the world.<ref name=SlideShare/> An even further semiotic analysis is that Adam and Eve gained a great deal of knowledge after the apple was bitten. So, the bitten apple is a sign for the \u201cpromise of knowledge\u201d that an Apple user may gain from the product.\n\nThe [[semiotics]] of the bite and the color of the logo can also be looked at from a technologic viewpoint. The bite is the [[signified]] and the computer storage unit, [[byte]], is the [[signifier]]. The rainbow color of the logo portrays the message that the its [[computer monitor]] could be produce color images.<ref name=SlideShare/> [[Steve Jobs]] also argued that color was crucial for \u201chumanizing the company\u201d at that time.<ref name=Cowin/>\n\nThe only thing to change with the logo since 1977 has been the color. In 1998, a [[monochromatic]] logo was implemented with the release of the first [[iMac]]. This was the first Mac to not have the iconic rainbow-colored apple since its creation 20 years prior.<ref name=Biricik>{{cite web|last1=Biricik|first1=Asli|title=The role of logo design in creating brand emotion: A semiotic comparison of the Apple and IBM logos|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.427.5285&rep=rep1&type=pdf|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> The new look was the future or new era of Apple Inc.

[...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success\". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the \"excitement of revolution\", but argues that people want \"the comfort that comes with harmony\". Furthermore, he writes that \"a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned\", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that [[Walkman]] didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the [[iCloud]] cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an [[Apple Watch]] can unlock a [[Macintosh|Mac]] in close proximity).

Whereas [[Google]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] make use of [[big data]] and analyze customer information to personalize results, Apple has a strong [[Apple Inc.#Privacy stance|pro-privacy stance]], intentionally not retaining user data. \"Siri is a textbook of [[iPhone|leading on something in tech]] and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley\", Holger Mueller, a technology analyst, told the ''Journal''. The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors, a lack of ambitious goals, and shifting strategies. Though switching Siri's functions to [[machine learning]] and [[algorithm]]s, which dramatically cut its error rate, the company reportedly still failed to anticipate the popularity of Amazon's [[Amazon Echo|Echo]], which features the [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] personal assistant.

The Ozarks cover a significant portion of northern Arkansas and most of the southern half of Missouri, extending from [[Interstate 40 in Arkansas|Interstate 40]] in Arkansas to [[Interstate 70 in Missouri|Interstate 70]] in central Missouri.\n\nThere are two mountain ranges within the Ozarks: the [[Boston Mountains]] of Arkansas and the [[St. Francois Mountains]] of Missouri. Buffalo Lookout, the highest point in the Ozarks, is located in the Boston Mountains. Geologically, the area is a broad [[dome (geology)|dome]] with the exposed core in the ancient St. Francois Mountains, some of the oldest rocks in [[North America]]. The Ozarks cover nearly {{convert|47,000|mi2}}, making it the most extensive highland region between the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] and [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]]. Together with the [[Ouachita Mountains]], the area is known as the [[U.S. Interior Highlands]].\n\nThe Salem Plateau, named after [[Salem, Missouri]], makes up the largest geologic area of the Ozarks. The second largest is the Springfield Plateau, named after [[Springfield, Missouri]], nicknamed the \"Queen City of the Ozarks\". On the northern Ozark border are the cities of [[St. Louis]] and [[Columbia, Missouri]]. Significant cities in Arkansas include [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]]. [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]] is a tourist destination and popularizer of Ozark culture just north of the Arkansas\u2013Missouri border.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Ozarks'' is a [[toponym]] believed to be derived as an English-language adaptation of the [[French language|French]] abbreviation ''aux Arcs'' (short for ''aux Arkansas'', meaning \"of/at Arkansas\").<ref>[[George R. Stewart|Stewart, George R.]] (1967). ''Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States'', p. 137. Houghton Mifflin, Boston.</ref> In the decades prior to the [[French and Indian War]], ''aux Arkansas'' originally referred to the [[trading post]] at [[Arkansas Post]], located in wooded [[Arkansas Delta]] lowland area above the confluence of the [[Arkansas River]] with the [[Mississippi River]].<ref name=\"Randolph primitive society\">Randolph, Vance.

''Colonial Arkansas 1686-1804: A Social and Cultural History''. University of Arkansas Press, Fayetteville. 1991.</ref> \"Arkansas\" seems to be the French version of what the [[Illiniwek|Illinois]] tribe (further up the Mississippi) called the [[Quapaw]], who lived in eastern Arkansas in the area of the trading post. Eventually, the term came to refer to all Ozark Plateau drainage into the Arkansas and [[Missouri River|Missouri]] rivers.\n\nAn alternative origin for the name \"Ozark\" relates the French term ''aux arcs''. In the later 17th and early 18th centuries, French cartographers mapped the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] and Mississippi rivers. The large, topmost arc or bend in this part of the Arkansas River was referred to as being ''aux arcs''\u2014the top or northernmost arc in the whole of the lower Arkansas. Travelers arriving by boat would disembark at this top bend of the river to explore the Ozarks; the town of [[Ozark, Arkansas]], is located on the north bank at this location.\n\nOther possible derivations include ''aux arcs'' meaning \"[land] of the arches\",<ref name=\"EJW Miller\">E. Joan Wilson Miller. \"The naming of the land in the Arkansas Ozarks: A study in culture processes\".

These include Clifty Hollow Natural Bridge (actually a series of arches) in Missouri,<ref name=\"Clifty Hollow Natural Bridge\">Watkins, Conor.

The Ozarks cover a significant portion of northern Arkansas and most of the southern half of Missouri, extending from [[Interstate 40 in Arkansas|Interstate 40]] in Arkansas to [[Interstate 70 in Missouri|Interstate 70]] in central Missouri.\n\nThere are two mountain ranges within the Ozarks: the [[Boston Mountains]] of Arkansas and the [[St. Francois Mountains]] of Missouri. Buffalo Lookout, the highest point in the Ozarks, is located in the Boston Mountains. Geologically, the area is a broad [[dome (geology)|dome]] with the exposed core in the ancient St. Francois Mountains, some of the oldest rocks in [[North America]]. The Ozarks cover nearly {{convert|47,000|mi2}}, making it the most extensive highland region between the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] and [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]]. Together with the [[Ouachita Mountains]], the area is known as the [[U.S. Interior Highlands]].\n\nThe Salem Plateau, named after [[Salem, Missouri]], makes up the largest geologic area of the Ozarks. The second largest is the Springfield Plateau, named after [[Springfield, Missouri]], nicknamed the \"Queen City of the Ozarks\". On the northern Ozark border are the cities of [[St. Louis]] and [[Columbia, Missouri]]. Significant cities in Arkansas include [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]]. [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]] is a tourist destination and popularizer of Ozark culture just north of the Arkansas\u2013Missouri border.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Ozarks'' is a [[toponym]] believed to be derived as an English-language adaptation of the [[French language|French]] abbreviation ''aux Arcs'' (short for ''aux Arkansas'', meaning \"of/at Arkansas\").<ref>[[George R. Stewart|Stewart, George R.]] (1967). ''Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States'', p. 137. Houghton Mifflin, Boston.</ref> In the decades prior to the [[French and Indian War]], ''aux Arkansas'' originally referred to the [[trading post]] at [[Arkansas Post]], located in wooded [[Arkansas Delta]] lowland area above the confluence of the [[Arkansas River]] with the [[Mississippi River]].<ref name=\"Randolph primitive society\">Randolph, Vance.

''Colonial Arkansas 1686-1804: A Social and Cultural History''. University of Arkansas Press, Fayetteville. 1991.</ref> \"Arkansas\" seems to be the French version of what the [[Illiniwek|Illinois]] tribe (further up the Mississippi) called the [[Quapaw]], who lived in eastern Arkansas in the area of the trading post. Eventually, the term came to refer to all Ozark Plateau drainage into the Arkansas and [[Missouri River|Missouri]] rivers.\n\nAn alternative origin for the name \"Ozark\" relates the French term ''aux arcs''. In the later 17th and early 18th centuries, French cartographers mapped the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] and Mississippi rivers. The large, topmost arc or bend in this part of the Arkansas River was referred to as being ''aux arcs''\u2014the top or northernmost arc in the whole of the lower Arkansas. Travelers arriving by boat would disembark at this top bend of the river to explore the Ozarks; the town of [[Ozark, Arkansas]], is located on the north bank at this location.\n\nOther possible derivations include ''aux arcs'' meaning \"[land] of the arches\",<ref name=\"EJW Miller\">E. Joan Wilson Miller. \"The naming of the land in the Arkansas Ozarks: A study in culture processes\".

It is even suggested ''aux arcs'' is an abbreviation of ''aux arcs-en-ciel'', French for \"toward the rainbows\", which are a common sight in the mountainous regions. After the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, American travelers in the region referred to various features of the upland areas using the term \"Ozark\", such as \"Ozark Mountains\" and \"Ozark forests\".
