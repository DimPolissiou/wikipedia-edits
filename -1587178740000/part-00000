Sufi orders were accused of fostering popular superstitions, resisting modern intellectual attitudes, and standing in the way of progressive reforms. Ideological attacks on Sufism were reinforced by agrarian and educational reforms, as well as new forms of taxation, which were instituted by Westernizing national governments, undermining the economic foundations of Sufi orders. The extent to which Sufi orders declined in the first half of the 20th century varied from country to country, but by the middle of the century the very survival of the orders and traditional Sufi lifestyle appeared doubtful to many observers.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| first=Alexander |last=Knysh| entry=Sufism|title=The New Cambridge History of Islam|volume=Volume 4: Islamic Cultures and Societies to the End of the Eighteenth Century |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010 |editor=Robert Irwin|pages=60\u201361}}</ref><ref name=OEIW-voll/>\n\nHowever, defying these predictions, Sufism and Sufi orders have continued to play a major role in the Muslim world, also expanding into Muslim-minority countries.

This was adopted by the Islamic world's political and temporal leaderships at the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] summit at Mecca in December 2005, and by six other international Islamic scholarly assemblies including the International Islamic Fiqh Academy of Jeddah, in July 2006. The definition of Sufism can vary drastically between different traditions (what may be intended is simple [[tazkiah]] as opposed to the various manifestations of Sufism around the Islamic world).<ref>[http://ammanmessage.com/ The Amman Message Summary]. Retrieved on Feb 2, 2010.</ref>\n\n===Traditional Islamic thought and Sufism===\n[[File:Tomb of said-ul-Auliya sayyid Ali hamadani.jpg|thumb|left|Tomb of Sayyid Ali Hamadani, [[Kulob]], [[Tajikistan]] ]]\nThe literature of Sufism emphasizes highly subjective matters that resist outside observation, such as the subtle states of the heart. Often these resist direct reference or description, with the consequence that the authors of various Sufi treatises took recourse to allegorical language. For instance, much Sufi poetry refers to intoxication, which Islam expressly forbids. This usage of indirect language and the existence of interpretations by people who had no training in Islam or Sufism led to doubts being cast over the validity of Sufism as a part of Islam. Also, some groups emerged that considered themselves above the ''sharia'' and discussed Sufism as a method of bypassing the rules of Islam in order to attain salvation directly. This was disapproved of by traditional scholars.\n\nFor these and other reasons, the relationship between traditional Islamic scholars and Sufism is complex and a range of scholarly opinion on Sufism in Islam has been the norm. Some scholars, such as Al-Ghazali, helped its propagation while other scholars opposed it. [[William Chittick]] explains the position of Sufism and Sufis this way:\n{{quote|In short, Muslim scholars who focused their energies on understanding the normative guidelines for the body came to be known as jurists, and those who held that the most important task was to train the mind in achieving correct understanding came to be divided into three main schools of thought: theology, philosophy, and Sufism. This leaves us with the third domain of human existence, the spirit. Most Muslims who devoted their major efforts to developing the spiritual dimensions of the human person came to be known as Sufis.{{sfn|Chittick|2007}}}}\n\n===''Neo-Sufism'' {{anchor|Neo-Sufism}}===\n[[File:5861-Linxia-Yu-Baba-Gongbei-main-building-roof.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The mausoleum (''[[gongbei (Islamic architecture)|gongbei]]'') of [[Ma Laichi]] in [[Linxia City]], China]]\n\nThe term \"neo-Sufism\" was originally coined by [[Fazlur Rahman]] and used by other scholars to describe reformist currents among 18th century Sufi orders, whose goal was to remove some of the more ecstatic and pantheistic elements of the Sufi tradition and reassert the importance of Islamic law as the basis for inner spirituality and social activism.<ref name=voll-OEIW>{{cite encyclopedia|author=John O.

[[Sufism Reoriented]] is an offshoot of it charted by the [[syncretism|syncretistic]] teacher [[Meher Baba]]. The [[Golden Sufi Center]] exists in England, Switzerland and the United States. It was founded by [[Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee]] to continue the work of his teacher [[Irina Tweedie]], herself a practitioner of both [[Hinduism]] and neo-Sufism. Other Western Sufi organisations include the Sufi Foundation of America and the [[International Association of Sufism]].\n\n==Theoretical perspectives==\n[[File:Munqidh min al-dalal (last page).jpg|thumb|right|upright|The works of Al-Ghazali firmly defended the concepts of Sufism within the Islamic faith.]]\n\nTraditional Islamic scholars have recognized two major branches within the practice of Sufism, and use this as one key to differentiating among the approaches of different masters and devotional lineages.<ref name=\"Heart 2008\">Muhammad Emin Er, ''Laws of the Heart: A Practical Introduction to the Sufi Order'', Shif\u00e2 Publishers, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-9815196-1-6}}</ref>\n\nOn the one hand there is the order from the signs to the Signifier (or from the arts to the Artisan). In this branch, the seeker begins by purifying the lower self of every corrupting influence that stands in the way of recognizing all of creation as the work of God, as God's active Self-disclosure or theophany.<ref>For a systematic description of the diseases of the heart that are to be overcome in order for this perspective to take root, see Hamza Yusuf, ''Purification of the Heart: Signs, Symptoms and Cures of the Spiritual Diseases of the Heart'', {{ISBN|978-1-929694-15-0}}.</ref> This is the way of Imam Al-Ghazali and of the majority of the Sufi orders.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the order from the Signifier to His signs, from the Artisan to His works. In this branch the seeker experiences divine attraction (''[[jadhba]]''), and is able to enter the order with a glimpse of its endpoint, of direct apprehension of the Divine Presence towards which all spiritual striving is directed. This does not replace the striving to purify the heart, as in the other branch; it simply stems from a different point of entry into the path. This is the way primarily of the masters of the Naqshbandi and [[Shadhili]] orders.<ref>Concerning this, and for an excellent discussion of the concept of attraction (''jadhba''), see especially the Introduction to Abdullah Nur ad-Din Durkee, ''The School of the Shadhdhuliyyah, Volume One: Orisons'', {{ISBN|977-00-1830-9}}.</ref>\n\nContemporary scholars may also recognize a third branch, attributed to the late [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] scholar [[Said Nursi]] and explicated in his vast Qur'an commentary called the [[Risale-i Nur]]. This approach entails strict adherence to the way of Muhammad, in the understanding that this wont, or ''[[sunnah]]'', proposes a complete devotional spirituality adequate to those without access to a master of the Sufi way.<ref>Muhammad Emin Er, ''al-Wasilat al-Fasila'', unpublished MS.</ref>\n\n===Contributions to other domains of scholarship===\nSufism has contributed significantly to the elaboration of theoretical perspectives in many domains of intellectual endeavor. For instance, the doctrine of \"subtle centers\" or centers of subtle cognition (known as ''[[Lataif-e-sitta]]'') addresses the matter of the awakening of spiritual intuition.<ref>[http://nurmuhammad.com/HeartLevels/coverLataif5levelsofheart.htm Realities of The Heart] Lataif</ref> In general, these subtle centers or ''lat\u00e2'if'' are thought of as faculties that are to be purified sequentially in order to bring the seeker's wayfaring to completion. A concise and useful summary of this system from a living exponent of this tradition has been published by [[Muhammad Emin Er]].<ref name=\"Heart 2008\"/>\n\n[[Sufi psychology]] has influenced many areas of thinking both within and outside of Islam, drawing primarily upon three concepts. [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] (both an [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|imam]] in the [[Shia]] tradition and a respected scholar and link in chains of Sufi transmission in all Islamic sects) held that human beings are dominated by a lower self called the [[nafs]] (self, ego, person), a faculty of spiritual intuition called the [[qalb]] (heart), and [[ruh]] (soul). These interact in various ways, producing the spiritual types of the tyrant (dominated by ''nafs''), the person of faith and moderation (dominated by the spiritual heart), and the person lost in love for God (dominated by the ''ruh'').{{sfn|Schimmel|2013}}\n\nOf note with regard to the spread of Sufi psychology in the West is [[Robert Frager]], a Sufi teacher authorized in the [[Khalwati]] [[Jerrahi]] order. Frager was a trained psychologist, born in the United States, who converted to Islam in the course of his practice of Sufism and wrote extensively on Sufism and psychology.<ref>See especially Robert Frager, ''Heart, Self & Soul: The Sufi Psychology of Growth, Balance, and Harmony'', {{ISBN|978-0-8356-0778-0}}.</ref>\n\n[[Sufi cosmology]] and [[Sufi metaphysics]] are also noteworthy areas of intellectual accomplishment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/philosophers-sufis-and-caliphs/philosophical-sufis-among-scholars-ulama-and-their-impact-on-political-culture/D3514A6470BA39F7301678CCAA0DD529|title=Philosophical Sufis among Scholars (\u02bfulam\u0101\u02be) and Their Impact on Political Culture|first=Ali Humayun|last=Akhtar|date=June 10, 2017|website=Philosophers, Sufis, and Caliphs: Politics and Authority from Cordoba to Cairo and Baghdad}}</ref>\n\n==Devotional practices of Sufis==\n[[File:Dhikr Rifa-iyya.jpg|thumb|Sufi gathering engaged in ''dhikr'']]\nThe devotional practices of Sufis vary widely. This is because an acknowledged and authorized master of the Sufi path is in effect a physician of the heart, able to diagnose the seeker's impediments to knowledge and pure intention in serving God, and to prescribe to the seeker a course of treatment appropriate to his or her maladies. The consensus among Sufi scholars is that the seeker cannot self-diagnose, and that it can be extremely harmful to undertake any of these practices alone and without formal authorization.<ref>Hakim Moinuddin Chisti, ''The Book of Sufi Healing'', {{ISBN|978-0-89281-043-7}}</ref>\n\nPrerequisites to practice include rigorous adherence to Islamic norms (ritual prayer in its five prescribed times each day, the fast of Ramadan, and so forth). Additionally, the seeker ought to be firmly grounded in supererogatory practices known from the life of Muhammad (such as the \"sunnah prayers\"). This is in accordance with the words, attributed to God, of the following, a famous ''[[Hadith Qudsi]]'':\n<blockquote>\nMy servant draws near to Me through nothing I love more than that which I have made obligatory for him. My servant never ceases drawing near to Me through supererogatory works until I love him. Then, when I love him, I am his hearing through which he hears, his sight through which he sees, his hand through which he grasps, and his foot through which he walks.\n</blockquote>\n\nIt is also necessary for the seeker to have a correct creed (''aqidah''),<ref>For an introduction to the normative creed of Islam as espoused by the consensus of scholars, see Hamza Yusuf, ''The Creed of Imam al-Tahawi'', {{ISBN|978-0-9702843-9-6}}, and Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Maghnisawi, ''Imam Abu Hanifa's Al-Fiqh Al-Akbar Explained'', {{ISBN|978-1-933764-03-0}}.</ref> and to embrace with certainty its tenets.<ref>The meaning of ''certainty'' in this context is emphasized in Muhammad Emin Er, ''The Soul of Islam: Essential Doctrines and Beliefs'', Shif\u00e2 Publishers, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-9815196-0-9}}.</ref> The seeker must also, of necessity, turn away from sins, love of this world, the love of company and renown, obedience to satanic impulse, and the promptings of the lower self. (The way in which this purification of the heart is achieved is outlined in certain books, but must be prescribed in detail by a Sufi master.) The seeker must also be trained to prevent the corruption of those good deeds which have accrued to his or her credit by overcoming the traps of ostentation, pride, arrogance, envy, and long hopes (meaning the hope for a long life allowing us to mend our ways later, rather than immediately, here and now).\n\nSufi practices, while attractive to some, are not a ''means'' for gaining knowledge. The traditional scholars of Sufism hold it as absolutely axiomatic that knowledge of God is not a psychological state generated through breath control. Thus, practice of \"techniques\" is not the cause, but instead the ''occasion'' for such knowledge to be obtained (if at all), given proper prerequisites and proper guidance by a master of the way. Furthermore, the emphasis on practices may obscure a far more important fact: The seeker is, in a sense, to become a broken person, stripped of all habits through the practice of (in the words of Imam Al-Ghazali) solitude, silence, sleeplessness, and hunger.<ref>See in particular the introduction by T. J. Winter to Abu Hamid Muhammad al-Ghazali, ''Al-Ghazali on Disciplining the Soul and on Breaking the Two Desires: Books XXII and XXIII of the Revival of the Religious Sciences'', {{ISBN|978-0-946621-43-9}}.</ref>\n\nMagic may have also been a part of some Sufi practices, notably in India.<ref>Akbar Ahmed, Diiscovering Islam, Making sense of Muslim History and Society, {{ISBN|0-415-28525-9}}(Pbk)</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Dhikr===\n{{main|Dhikr}}\n[[File:Isma allah zat-new.png|thumb|upright|The name of Allah as written on the disciple's heart, according to the Sarwari Qadri Order]]\n''Dhikr'' is the remembrance of Allah commanded in the [[Qur'an]] for all [[Muslims]] through a specific devotional act, such as the repetition of divine names, supplications and aphorisms from ''hadith'' literature and the Quran.

To engage in ''dhikr'' is to practice consciousness of the Divine Presence and [[Love of God#Islam|love]], or \"to seek a state of godwariness\". The Quran refers to Muhammad as the very embodiment of ''dhikr'' of Allah (65:10\u201311). Some types of ''dhikr'' are prescribed for all Muslims and do not require Sufi initiation or the prescription of a Sufi master because they are deemed to be good for every seeker under every circumstance.<ref>Hakim Moinuddin Chisti ''The Book of Sufi Healing'', {{ISBN|978-0-89281-043-7}}</ref>\n\nThe ''dhikr'' may slightly vary among each order.

This practice of ''dhikr'' is called ''[[Dhikr-e-Qulb]]'' (invocation of Allah within the heartbeats).

And thus he is to turn his full consciousness towards God Most High while saying three times: \"''Ilah\u00ee anta maqs\u00fbd\u00ee wa-rid\u00e2ka matl\u00fbb\u00ee''\u2014my God, you are my Goal and Your good pleasure is what I seek\".

It is a customary dance performed within the ''sema'', through which dervishes (also called ''semazens'', from [[Persian language|Persian]] {{lang|fa|\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u0632\u0646}}) aim to reach the source of all perfection, or kemal. This is sought through abandoning one's [[nafs]], [[Ego (spirituality)|egos]] or personal desires, by listening to the music, focusing on [[God]], and spinning one's body in repetitive circles, which has been seen as a symbolic imitation of planets in the [[Solar System]] orbiting the sun.<ref name=\"MOA sema\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hayatidede.org/popups/about_sema.htm|title=The Sema of the Mevlevi|publisher=Mevlevi Order of America|access-date=2009-03-26|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121221021339/http://www.hayatidede.org/popups/about_sema.htm|archive-date=2012-12-21|df=}}</ref>\n\nAs explained by Sufis:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whirlingdervishes.org/whirlingdervishes.htm|title=The Whirling Dervishes of Rumi}}</ref>\n<blockquote>In the symbolism of the Sema ritual, the semazen's camel's hair hat (sikke) represents the tombstone of the ego; his wide, white skirt (''tennure'') represents the ego's shroud. By removing his black cloak (''h\u0131rka''), he is spiritually reborn to the truth. At the beginning of the Sema, by holding his arms crosswise, the semazen appears to represent the number one, thus testifying to God's unity. While whirling, his arms are open: his right arm is directed to the sky, ready to receive God's beneficence; his left hand, upon which his eyes are fastened, is turned toward the earth. The semazen conveys God's spiritual gift to those who are witnessing the Sema. Revolving from right to left around the heart, the semazen embraces all humanity with love. The human being has been created with love in order to love. Mevl\u00e2na Jal\u00e2ludd\u00een Rumi says, \"All loves are a bridge to Divine love. Yet, those who have not had a taste of it do not know!\"</blockquote>\n\n=== Music ===\n''[[Qawwali]]'' is a form of Sufi devotional music popular in [[South Asia]], usually performed at ''[[dargah]]s''. Sufi saint [[Amir Khusrau]] is said to have infused Persian, Arabic Turkish and [[Indian classical music|Indian classical]] musical styles to create the genre in the 13th century. The songs are classified into [[hamd]], [[Na`at|na'at]], [[manqabat]], [[marsiya]] or [[ghazal]], among others. The songs lasting for about 15 to 30 minutes, are performed by a group of singers, and instruments including the [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[tabla]] and [[dholak]] are used.

Qadiriyya was his patronym. Gilani spent his early life in Na'if, the town of his birth. There, he pursued the study of [[Hanbali]] law. [[Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi]] gave Gilani lessons in [[fiqh]]. He was given lessons about ''hadith'' by Abu Bakr ibn Muzaffar. He was given lessons about Tafsir by Abu Muhammad Ja'far, a commentator. His Sufi spiritual instructor was Abu'l-Khair Hammad ibn Muslim al-Dabbas. After completing his education, Gilani left Baghdad. He spent twenty-five years as a reclusive wanderer in the desert regions of Iraq. In 1127, Gilani returned to Baghdad and began to preach to the public. He joined the teaching staff of the school belonging to his own teacher, [[Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi]], and was popular with students.

He was first found by a group of religious pilgrims in the early 1900s meditating in the jungles of Kataragama in Sri Lanka (Ceylon). Awed and inspired by his personality and the depth of his wisdom, he was invited to a nearby village. Since that time, people of all walks of life from paupers to prime ministers belonging to all religious and ethnic backgrounds have flocked to see Sheikh Bawa Muhaiyaddeen to seek comfort, guidance and help.

His writings, especially al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya and Fusus al-hikam, have been studied within all the Sufi orders as the clearest expression of ''tawhid'' (Divine Unity), though because of their recondite nature they were often only given to initiates. Later those who followed his teaching became known as the school of ''wahdat al-wujud'' (the Oneness of Being). He himself considered his writings to have been divinely inspired. As he expressed the Way to one of his close disciples, his legacy is that 'you should never ever abandon your servant-hood (''\u02bfubudiyya''), and that there may never be in your soul a longing for any existing thing'.<ref>K. al-Wasa'il, quoted in ''The Unlimited Mercifier'', Stephen Hirtenstein, p. 246</ref>\n\n===Junayd of Baghdad===\n[[Junayd of Baghdad|Junayd al-Baghdadi]] (830\u2013910) was one of the great early Sufis. His order was Junaidia, which links to the golden chain of many Sufi orders. He laid the groundwork for sober mysticism in contrast to that of God-intoxicated Sufis like al-Hallaj, Bayazid Bastami and Abusaeid Abolkheir. During the trial of al-Hallaj, his former disciple, the Caliph of the time demanded his fatwa. In response, he issued this fatwa: \"From the outward appearance he is to die and we judge according to the outward appearance and God knows better\". He is referred to by Sufis as Sayyid-ut Taifa\u2014i.e., the leader of the group. He lived and died in the city of Baghdad.\n\n===Mansur Al-Hallaj===\n[[Mansur Al-Hallaj]] (died 922) is renowned for his claim, ''Ana-l-Haqq'' (\"I am The Truth\"). His refusal to recant this utterance, which was regarded as [[apostasy]], led to a long trial. He was imprisoned for 11 years in a Baghdad prison, before being tortured and publicly dismembered on March 26, 922. He is still revered by Sufis for his willingness to embrace torture and death rather than recant. It is said that during his prayers, he would say \"O Lord! You are the guide of those who are passing through the Valley of Bewilderment. If I am a heretic, enlarge my heresy\".<ref>Memoirs of the Saints, p.108.{{fcn|date=February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Moinuddin Chishti===\n[[File:Sufi Prayer Book LACMA M.87.21.jpg|thumb|A Mughal-era Sufi prayer book from the Chishti order]]\n\n[[Moinuddin Chishti|Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti]] was born in 1141 and died in 1236.

Moinuddin Chishti introduced and established the order in the Indian subcontinent. The initial spiritual chain or silsila of the Chishti order in India, comprising Moinuddin Chishti, [[Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki|Bakhtiyar Kaki]], [[Fariduddin Ganjshakar|Baba Farid]], [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] (each successive person being the disciple of the previous one), constitutes the great Sufi saints of Indian history. Moinuddin Chisht\u012b turned towards India, reputedly after a dream in which Muhammad blessed him to do so. After a brief stay at Lahore, he reached [[Ajmer]] along with Sultan [[Muhammad of Ghor|Shah\u0101b-ud-Din Muhammad Ghori]], and settled down there. In Ajmer, he attracted a substantial following, acquiring a great deal of respect amongst the residents of the city. Moinuddin Chisht\u012b practiced the Sufi ''Sulh-e-Kul'' (peace to all) concept to promote understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya===\n[[File:Rabia al-Adawiyya.jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of Rabi'a [[Mill (grinding)|grinding grain]] from a [[Persian language|Persian]] dictionary]]\n\n[[Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya]] or Rabia of Basra (died 801) was a mystic who represents countercultural elements of Sufism, especially with regards to the status and power of women.

Sufis often visit the shrine for [[ziyarat]], a term associated with religious visits and pilgrimages. Dargahs are often associated with Sufi eating and meeting rooms and hostels, called ''[[khanqah]]'' or hospices.

There is evidence that Sufism did influence the development of some schools of Jewish philosophy and ethics. In the first writing of this kind, we see \"Kitab al-Hidayah ila Fara'i\u1e0d al-\u1e32ulub\", ''[[Duties of the Heart]]'', of [[Bahya ibn Paquda]]. This book was translated by [[Judah ibn Tibbon]] into [[Hebrew]] under the title \"\u1e24\u014d\u1e07\u014d\u1e6f Ha-lle\u1e07\u0101\u1e07\u014d\u1e6f\".<ref>''A Sufi-Jewish Dialogue: Philosophy and Mysticism in Bahya ibn Paquda's Duties of the Heart'', Diana Lobel</ref>{{quote|The precepts prescribed by the [[Torah]] number 613 only; those dictated by the intellect are innumerable.}}\n\nIt is noteworthy that in the ethical writings of the Sufis [[Al-Kusajri]] and [[Harawi (genre)|Al-Harawi]] there are sections which treat of the same subjects as those treated in the \"\u1e24ovot ha-Lebabot\" and which bear the same titles: e.g., \"Bab al-Tawakkul\"; \"Bab al-Taubah\"; \"Bab al-Mu\u1e25asabah\"; \"Bab al-Tawa\u1e0du'\"; \"Bab al-Zuhd\". In the ninth gate, Ba\u1e25ya directly quotes sayings of the Sufis, whom he calls ''Perushim''. However, the author of the ''\u1e24\u014d\u1e07\u014d\u1e6f Ha-lle\u1e07\u0101\u1e07\u014d\u1e6f'' did not go so far as to approve of the asceticism of the Sufis, although he showed a marked predilection for their ethical principles.\n\n[[Avraham son of Rambam|Abraham ben Moses ben Maimon]], the son of the Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]], believed that Sufi practices and doctrines continue the tradition of the Biblical prophets. See Sefer Hammaspiq, \"Happerishuth\", Chapter 11 (\"Ha-mma\u02bfa\u1e07\u0101q\") s.v. hithbonen efo be-masoreth mufla'a zo, citing the Talmudic explanation of Jeremiah 13:27 in Chagigah 5b; in Rabbi Yaakov Wincelberg's translation, \"The Way of Serving God\" (Feldheim), p.&nbsp;429 and above, p.&nbsp;427. Also see ibid., Chapter 10 (\"Iqqu\u1e07im\"), s.v. wa-halo yo\u1e0fe\u02bea\u02bf atta; in \"The Way of Serving God\", p.&nbsp;371.\n\nAbraham Maimuni's principal work is originally composed in [[Judeo-Arabic]] and entitled \"\u05db\u05ea\u05d0\u05d1 \u05db\u05e4\u05d0\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05e2\u05d0\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9\u05df\" ''Kit\u0101b Kif\u0101yah al-'\u0100bid\u012bn'' (\"A Comprehensive Guide for the Servants of God\"). From the extant surviving portion it is conjectured that Maimuni's treatise was three times as long as his father's Guide for the Perplexed. In the book, Maimuni evidences a great appreciation for, and affinity to, Sufism. Followers of his path continued to foster a Jewish-Sufi form of pietism for at least a century, and he is rightly considered the founder of this pietistic school, which was centered in [[Egypt]].\n\nThe followers of this path, which they called, interchangeably, Hasidism (not to be confused with the [later] [[Jewish]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] movement) or Sufism (''Tasawwuf''), practiced spiritual retreats, solitude, fasting and sleep deprivation. The Jewish Sufis maintained their own [[Sufi order|brotherhood]], guided by a religious leader\u2014like a Sufi [[sheikh]].<ref name=\"revues\">{{cite web|url=http://bcrfj.revues.org/index2312.html |title=Jewish pietism of the Sufi type |author=Mireille Loubet |publisher=bcrfj.revues.org|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] in its entry on Sufism states that the revival of Jewish mysticism in Muslim countries is probably due to the spread of Sufism in the same geographical areas.

Sufi orders were accused of fostering popular superstitions, resisting modern intellectual attitudes, and standing in the way of progressive reforms. Ideological attacks on Sufism were reinforced by agrarian and educational reforms, as well as new forms of taxation, which were instituted by Westernizing national governments, undermining the economic foundations of Sufi orders.

Often these resist direct reference or description, with the consequence that the authors of various Sufi treatises took recourse to allegorical language. For instance, much Sufi poetry refers to intoxication, which Islam expressly forbids. This usage of indirect language and the existence of interpretations by people who had no training in Islam or Sufism led to doubts being cast over the validity of Sufism as a part of Islam. Also, some groups emerged that considered themselves above the ''sharia'' and discussed Sufism as a method of bypassing the rules of Islam in order to attain salvation directly. This was disapproved of by traditional scholars.\n\nFor these and other reasons, the relationship between traditional Islamic scholars and Sufism is complex and a range of scholarly opinion on Sufism in Islam has been the norm. Some scholars, such as Al-Ghazali, helped its propagation while other scholars opposed it. [[William Chittick]] explains the position of Sufism and Sufis this way:\n{{quote|In short, Muslim scholars who focused their energies on understanding the normative guidelines for the body came to be known as jurists, and those who held that the most important task was to train the mind in achieving correct understanding came to be divided into three main schools of thought: theology, philosophy, and Sufism.

In this branch, the seeker begins by purifying the lower self of every corrupting influence that stands in the way of recognizing all of creation as the work of God, as God's active Self-disclosure or theophany.<ref>For a systematic description of the diseases of the heart that are to be overcome in order for this perspective to take root, see Hamza Yusuf, ''Purification of the Heart: Signs, Symptoms and Cures of the Spiritual Diseases of the Heart'', {{ISBN|978-1-929694-15-0}}.</ref> This is the way of Imam Al-Ghazali and of the majority of the Sufi orders.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the order from the Signifier to His signs, from the Artisan to His works. In this branch the seeker experiences divine attraction (''[[jadhba]]''), and is able to enter the order with a glimpse of its endpoint, of direct apprehension of the Divine Presence towards which all spiritual striving is directed. This does not replace the striving to purify the heart, as in the other branch; it simply stems from a different point of entry into the path. This is the way primarily of the masters of the Naqshbandi and [[Shadhili]] orders.<ref>Concerning this, and for an excellent discussion of the concept of attraction (''jadhba''), see especially the Introduction to Abdullah Nur ad-Din Durkee, ''The School of the Shadhdhuliyyah, Volume One: Orisons'', {{ISBN|977-00-1830-9}}.</ref>\n\nContemporary scholars may also recognize a third branch, attributed to the late [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] scholar [[Said Nursi]] and explicated in his vast Qur'an commentary called the [[Risale-i Nur]]. This approach entails strict adherence to the way of Muhammad, in the understanding that this wont, or ''[[sunnah]]'', proposes a complete devotional spirituality adequate to those without access to a master of the Sufi way.<ref>Muhammad Emin Er, ''al-Wasilat al-Fasila'', unpublished MS.</ref>\n\n===Contributions to other domains of scholarship===\nSufism has contributed significantly to the elaboration of theoretical perspectives in many domains of intellectual endeavor. For instance, the doctrine of \"subtle centers\" or centers of subtle cognition (known as ''[[Lataif-e-sitta]]'') addresses the matter of the awakening of spiritual intuition.<ref>[http://nurmuhammad.com/HeartLevels/coverLataif5levelsofheart.htm Realities of The Heart] Lataif</ref> In general, these subtle centers or ''lat\u00e2'if'' are thought of as faculties that are to be purified sequentially in order to bring the seeker's wayfaring to completion. A concise and useful summary of this system from a living exponent of this tradition has been published by [[Muhammad Emin Er]].<ref name=\"Heart 2008\"/>\n\n[[Sufi psychology]] has influenced many areas of thinking both within and outside of Islam, drawing primarily upon three concepts. [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] (both an [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|imam]] in the [[Shia]] tradition and a respected scholar and link in chains of Sufi transmission in all Islamic sects) held that human beings are dominated by a lower self called the [[nafs]] (self, ego, person), a faculty of spiritual intuition called the [[qalb]] (heart), and [[ruh]] (soul). These interact in various ways, producing the spiritual types of the tyrant (dominated by ''nafs''), the person of faith and moderation (dominated by the spiritual heart), and the person lost in love for God (dominated by the ''ruh'').{{sfn|Schimmel|2013}}\n\nOf note with regard to the spread of Sufi psychology in the West is [[Robert Frager]], a Sufi teacher authorized in the [[Khalwati]] [[Jerrahi]] order. Frager was a trained psychologist, born in the United States, who converted to Islam in the course of his practice of Sufism and wrote extensively on Sufism and psychology.<ref>See especially Robert Frager, ''Heart, Self & Soul: The Sufi Psychology of Growth, Balance, and Harmony'', {{ISBN|978-0-8356-0778-0}}.</ref>\n\n[[Sufi cosmology]] and [[Sufi metaphysics]] are also noteworthy areas of intellectual accomplishment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/philosophers-sufis-and-caliphs/philosophical-sufis-among-scholars-ulama-and-their-impact-on-political-culture/D3514A6470BA39F7301678CCAA0DD529|title=Philosophical Sufis among Scholars (\u02bfulam\u0101\u02be) and Their Impact on Political Culture|first=Ali Humayun|last=Akhtar|date=June 10, 2017|website=Philosophers, Sufis, and Caliphs: Politics and Authority from Cordoba to Cairo and Baghdad}}</ref>\n\n==Devotional practices of Sufis==\n[[File:Dhikr Rifa-iyya.jpg|thumb|Sufi gathering engaged in ''dhikr'']]\nThe devotional practices of Sufis vary widely. This is because an acknowledged and authorized master of the Sufi path is in effect a physician of the heart, able to diagnose the seeker's impediments to knowledge and pure intention in serving God, and to prescribe to the seeker a course of treatment appropriate to his or her maladies. The consensus among Sufi scholars is that the seeker cannot self-diagnose, and that it can be extremely harmful to undertake any of these practices alone and without formal authorization.<ref>Hakim Moinuddin Chisti, ''The Book of Sufi Healing'', {{ISBN|978-0-89281-043-7}}</ref>\n\nPrerequisites to practice include rigorous adherence to Islamic norms (ritual prayer in its five prescribed times each day, the fast of Ramadan, and so forth). Additionally, the seeker ought to be firmly grounded in supererogatory practices known from the life of Muhammad (such as the \"sunnah prayers\"). This is in accordance with the words, attributed to God, of the following, a famous ''[[Hadith Qudsi]]'':\n<blockquote>\nMy servant draws near to Me through nothing I love more than that which I have made obligatory for him. My servant never ceases drawing near to Me through supererogatory works until I love him. Then, when I love him, I am his hearing through which he hears, his sight through which he sees, his hand through which he grasps, and his foot through which he walks.\n</blockquote>\n\nIt is also necessary for the seeker to have a correct creed (''aqidah''),<ref>For an introduction to the normative creed of Islam as espoused by the consensus of scholars, see Hamza Yusuf, ''The Creed of Imam al-Tahawi'', {{ISBN|978-0-9702843-9-6}}, and Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Maghnisawi, ''Imam Abu Hanifa's Al-Fiqh Al-Akbar Explained'', {{ISBN|978-1-933764-03-0}}.</ref> and to embrace with certainty its tenets.<ref>The meaning of ''certainty'' in this context is emphasized in Muhammad Emin Er, ''The Soul of Islam: Essential Doctrines and Beliefs'', Shif\u00e2 Publishers, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-9815196-0-9}}.</ref> The seeker must also, of necessity, turn away from sins, love of this world, the love of company and renown, obedience to satanic impulse, and the promptings of the lower self. (The way in which this purification of the heart is achieved is outlined in certain books, but must be prescribed in detail by a Sufi master.) The seeker must also be trained to prevent the corruption of those good deeds which have accrued to his or her credit by overcoming the traps of ostentation, pride, arrogance, envy, and long hopes (meaning the hope for a long life allowing us to mend our ways later, rather than immediately, here and now).\n\nSufi practices, while attractive to some, are not a ''means'' for gaining knowledge. The traditional scholars of Sufism hold it as absolutely axiomatic that knowledge of God is not a psychological state generated through breath control. Thus, practice of \"techniques\" is not the cause, but instead the ''occasion'' for such knowledge to be obtained (if at all), given proper prerequisites and proper guidance by a master of the way. Furthermore, the emphasis on practices may obscure a far more important fact: The seeker is, in a sense, to become a broken person, stripped of all habits through the practice of (in the words of Imam Al-Ghazali) solitude, silence, sleeplessness, and hunger.<ref>See in particular the introduction by T. J. Winter to Abu Hamid Muhammad al-Ghazali, ''Al-Ghazali on Disciplining the Soul and on Breaking the Two Desires: Books XXII and XXIII of the Revival of the Religious Sciences'', {{ISBN|978-0-946621-43-9}}.</ref>\n\nMagic may have also been a part of some Sufi practices, notably in India.<ref>Akbar Ahmed, Diiscovering Islam, Making sense of Muslim History and Society, {{ISBN|0-415-28525-9}}(Pbk)</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Dhikr===\n{{main|Dhikr}}\n[[File:Isma allah zat-new.png|thumb|upright|The name of Allah as written on the disciple's heart, according to the Sarwari Qadri Order]]\n''Dhikr'' is the remembrance of Allah commanded in the [[Qur'an]] for all [[Muslims]] through a specific devotional act, such as the repetition of divine names, supplications and aphorisms from ''hadith'' literature and the Quran. More generally, ''dhikr'' takes a wide range and various layers of meaning.<ref>{{cite web|author=Abdullah Jawadi Amuli|url=http://media.basirat.ca/docs/dhikr_and_the_wisdom_behind_it.pdf|title=Dhikr and the Wisdom Behind It|translator=A. Rahmim|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref> This includes ''dhikr'' as any activity in which the Muslim maintains awareness of Allah. To engage in ''dhikr'' is to practice consciousness of the Divine Presence and [[Love of God#Islam|love]], or \"to seek a state of godwariness\". The Quran refers to Muhammad as the very embodiment of ''dhikr'' of Allah (65:10\u201311). Some types of ''dhikr'' are prescribed for all Muslims and do not require Sufi initiation or the prescription of a Sufi master because they are deemed to be good for every seeker under every circumstance.<ref>Hakim Moinuddin Chisti ''The Book of Sufi Healing'', {{ISBN|978-0-89281-043-7}}</ref>\n\nThe ''dhikr'' may slightly vary among each order.

''Sema'' includes various forms of worship such as [[recitation]], [[singing]] (the most well known being the [[Qawwali]] music of the Indian subcontinent), [[instrumental music]], [[dance]] (most famously the [[Sufi whirling]] of the [[Mevlevi order]]), [[incense]], [[meditation]], [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]], and [[altered state of consciousness|trance]].<ref>Touma 1996, p.162.{{fcn|date=February 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome Sufi orders stress and place extensive reliance upon ''dhikr''. This practice of ''dhikr'' is called ''[[Dhikr-e-Qulb]]'' (invocation of Allah within the heartbeats). The basic idea in this practice is to visualize the Allah as having been written on the disciple's heart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goharshahi.net/images/books_files/menar-e-noor_files/What%20is%20Remembrance%20and%20what%20is%20Contemplation.htm|title=What is Remembrance and what is Contemplation?|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415182616/http://www.goharshahi.net/images/books_files/menar-e-noor_files/What%20is%20Remembrance%20and%20what%20is%20Contemplation.htm|archive-date=2008-04-15}}</ref>\n\n===Muraqaba===\n{{main|Muraqaba}}\nThe practice of ''muraqaba'' can be likened to the practices of [[meditation]] attested in many faith communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sultan-bahoo.com/en/tafakkur-and-muraqbah-meditation-and-concentration.html#Tafakkur-Muraqbah|title=Muraqaba|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609000104/http://www.sultan-bahoo.com/en/tafakkur-and-muraqbah-meditation-and-concentration.html#Tafakkur-Muraqbah|archive-date=2015-06-09|df=}}</ref>\n\nWhile variation exists, one description of the practice within a Naqshbandi lineage reads as follows:\n<blockquote>\nHe is to collect all of his bodily senses in concentration, and to cut himself off from all preoccupation and notions that inflict themselves upon the heart. And thus he is to turn his full consciousness towards God Most High while saying three times: \"''Ilah\u00ee anta maqs\u00fbd\u00ee wa-rid\u00e2ka matl\u00fbb\u00ee''\u2014my God, you are my Goal and Your good pleasure is what I seek\". Then he brings to his heart the Name of the Essence\u2014All\u00e2h\u2014and as it courses through his heart he remains attentive to its meaning, which is \"Essence without likeness\". The seeker remains aware that He is Present, Watchful, Encompassing of all, thereby exemplifying the meaning of his saying (may God bless him and grant him peace): \"Worship God as though you see Him, for if you do not see Him, He sees you\".

It is a customary dance performed within the ''sema'', through which dervishes (also called ''semazens'', from [[Persian language|Persian]] {{lang|fa|\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u0632\u0646}}) aim to reach the source of all perfection, or kemal. This is sought through abandoning one's [[nafs]], [[Ego (spirituality)|egos]] or personal desires, by listening to the music, focusing on [[God]], and spinning one's body in repetitive circles, which has been seen as a symbolic imitation of planets in the [[Solar System]] orbiting the sun.<ref name=\"MOA sema\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hayatidede.org/popups/about_sema.htm|title=The Sema of the Mevlevi|publisher=Mevlevi Order of America|access-date=2009-03-26|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121221021339/http://www.hayatidede.org/popups/about_sema.htm|archive-date=2012-12-21|df=}}</ref>\n\nAs explained by Sufis:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whirlingdervishes.org/whirlingdervishes.htm|title=The Whirling Dervishes of Rumi}}</ref>\n<blockquote>In the symbolism of the Sema ritual, the semazen's camel's hair hat (sikke) represents the tombstone of the ego; his wide, white skirt (''tennure'') represents the ego's shroud. By removing his black cloak (''h\u0131rka''), he is spiritually reborn to the truth. At the beginning of the Sema, by holding his arms crosswise, the semazen appears to represent the number one, thus testifying to God's unity. While whirling, his arms are open: his right arm is directed to the sky, ready to receive God's beneficence; his left hand, upon which his eyes are fastened, is turned toward the earth. The semazen conveys God's spiritual gift to those who are witnessing the Sema. Revolving from right to left around the heart, the semazen embraces all humanity with love. The human being has been created with love in order to love. Mevl\u00e2na Jal\u00e2ludd\u00een Rumi says, \"All loves are a bridge to Divine love. Yet, those who have not had a taste of it do not know!\"</blockquote>\n\n=== Music ===\n''[[Qawwali]]'' is a form of Sufi devotional music popular in [[South Asia]], usually performed at ''[[dargah]]s''. Sufi saint [[Amir Khusrau]] is said to have infused Persian, Arabic Turkish and [[Indian classical music|Indian classical]] musical styles to create the genre in the 13th century. The songs are classified into [[hamd]], [[Na`at|na'at]], [[manqabat]], [[marsiya]] or [[ghazal]], among others. The songs lasting for about 15 to 30 minutes, are performed by a group of singers, and instruments including the [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[tabla]] and [[dholak]] are used.

The Iranian Islamic Republic has harassed Shia Sufis, reportedly for their lack of support for the government doctrine of \"[[Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist|governance of the jurist]]\" (i.e., that the supreme [[Shiite]] jurist should be the nation's political leader).\n\nIn most other Muslim countries, attacks on Sufis and especially their shrines have come from [[Salafis]] who believe that practices such as [[Mawlid#Other uses of the term|celebration of the birthdays of Sufi saints]], and dhikr (\"remembrance\" of God) ceremonies are [[bid\u2018ah]] or impure innovation, and polytheistic ([[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/may/10/islam-sufi-salafi-egypt-religion|title=Salafi intolerance threatens Sufis|author=Baher Ibrahim|work=The Guardian|date=10 May 2010}}</ref><ref name=Mir>{{cite web|last=Mir|first=Tariq|title=Kashmir: From Sufi to Salafi|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/projects/kashmir-sufi-resurgence-salafi-islam-belief-conflict-rising-salafism-muslim-islam|work=November 5, 2012|publisher=Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=violence>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamopediaonline.org/country-profile/egypt/salafists/salafi-violence-against-sufis|title=Salafi Violence against Sufis|publisher=[[Islamopedia Online]]|access-date=24 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530232126/http://www.islamopediaonline.org/country-profile/egypt/salafists/salafi-violence-against-sufis|archive-date=2013-05-30|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\nAt least 305 people were killed and more than 100 wounded during a [[2017 Sinai mosque attack|November 2017 attack]] on a mosque in Sinai.<ref>{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Declan|last2=Youssef|first2=Nour|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/24/world/middleeast/mosque-attack-egypt.html?emc=edit_ne_20171124&nl=evening-briefing&nlid=68634180&te=1|title=Militants Kill 305 at Sufi Mosque in Egypt's Deadliest Terrorist Attack|work=The New York Times|date=November 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Specia|first=Megan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/24/world/middleeast/sufi-muslim-explainer.html?emc=edit_ne_20171124&nl=evening-briefing&nlid=68634180&te=1|title=Who Are Sufi Muslims and Why Do Some Extremists Hate Them?|work=The New York Times|date=November 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Prominent Sufis==\n\n===Abdul-Qadir Gilani===\n[[File:Roof hafez tomb.jpg|thumb|right|[[Islamic geometric patterns|Geometric tiling]] on the underside of the dome of Hafiz Shirazi's tomb in [[Shiraz]]]]\n\n[[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]] (1077\u20131166) was a Persian [[Hanbali]] jurist and Sufi based in [[Baghdad]]. Qadiriyya was his patronym. Gilani spent his early life in Na'if, the town of his birth. There, he pursued the study of [[Hanbali]] law. [[Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi]] gave Gilani lessons in [[fiqh]]. He was given lessons about ''hadith'' by Abu Bakr ibn Muzaffar. He was given lessons about Tafsir by Abu Muhammad Ja'far, a commentator. His Sufi spiritual instructor was Abu'l-Khair Hammad ibn Muslim al-Dabbas. After completing his education, Gilani left Baghdad. He spent twenty-five years as a reclusive wanderer in the desert regions of Iraq. In 1127, Gilani returned to Baghdad and began to preach to the public. He joined the teaching staff of the school belonging to his own teacher, [[Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi]], and was popular with students. In the morning he taught ''hadith'' and ''[[tafsir]]'', and in the afternoon he held discourse on the science of the heart and the virtues of the Quran.

He was first found by a group of religious pilgrims in the early 1900s meditating in the jungles of Kataragama in Sri Lanka (Ceylon). Awed and inspired by his personality and the depth of his wisdom, he was invited to a nearby village. Since that time, people of all walks of life from paupers to prime ministers belonging to all religious and ethnic backgrounds have flocked to see Sheikh Bawa Muhaiyaddeen to seek comfort, guidance and help. Sheikh Bawa Muhaiyaddeen tirelessly spent the rest of his life preaching, healing and comforting the many souls that came to see him.\n\n===Ibn Arabi===\nMuhyiddin Muhammad b.

His writings, especially al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya and Fusus al-hikam, have been studied within all the Sufi orders as the clearest expression of ''tawhid'' (Divine Unity), though because of their recondite nature they were often only given to initiates. Later those who followed his teaching became known as the school of ''wahdat al-wujud'' (the Oneness of Being). He himself considered his writings to have been divinely inspired. As he expressed the Way to one of his close disciples, his legacy is that 'you should never ever abandon your servant-hood (''\u02bfubudiyya''), and that there may never be in your soul a longing for any existing thing'.<ref>K. al-Wasa'il, quoted in ''The Unlimited Mercifier'', Stephen Hirtenstein, p. 246</ref>\n\n===Junayd of Baghdad===\n[[Junayd of Baghdad|Junayd al-Baghdadi]] (830\u2013910) was one of the great early Sufis. His order was Junaidia, which links to the golden chain of many Sufi orders. He laid the groundwork for sober mysticism in contrast to that of God-intoxicated Sufis like al-Hallaj, Bayazid Bastami and Abusaeid Abolkheir. During the trial of al-Hallaj, his former disciple, the Caliph of the time demanded his fatwa. In response, he issued this fatwa: \"From the outward appearance he is to die and we judge according to the outward appearance and God knows better\". He is referred to by Sufis as Sayyid-ut Taifa\u2014i.e., the leader of the group. He lived and died in the city of Baghdad.\n\n===Mansur Al-Hallaj===\n[[Mansur Al-Hallaj]] (died 922) is renowned for his claim, ''Ana-l-Haqq'' (\"I am The Truth\"). His refusal to recant this utterance, which was regarded as [[apostasy]], led to a long trial. He was imprisoned for 11 years in a Baghdad prison, before being tortured and publicly dismembered on March 26, 922. He is still revered by Sufis for his willingness to embrace torture and death rather than recant. It is said that during his prayers, he would say \"O Lord! You are the guide of those who are passing through the Valley of Bewilderment. If I am a heretic, enlarge my heresy\".<ref>Memoirs of the Saints, p.108.{{fcn|date=February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Moinuddin Chishti===\n[[File:Sufi Prayer Book LACMA M.87.21.jpg|thumb|A Mughal-era Sufi prayer book from the Chishti order]]\n\n[[Moinuddin Chishti|Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti]] was born in 1141 and died in 1236.

Moinuddin Chishti introduced and established the order in the Indian subcontinent. The initial spiritual chain or silsila of the Chishti order in India, comprising Moinuddin Chishti, [[Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki|Bakhtiyar Kaki]], [[Fariduddin Ganjshakar|Baba Farid]], [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] (each successive person being the disciple of the previous one), constitutes the great Sufi saints of Indian history. Moinuddin Chisht\u012b turned towards India, reputedly after a dream in which Muhammad blessed him to do so. After a brief stay at Lahore, he reached [[Ajmer]] along with Sultan [[Muhammad of Ghor|Shah\u0101b-ud-Din Muhammad Ghori]], and settled down there. In Ajmer, he attracted a substantial following, acquiring a great deal of respect amongst the residents of the city. Moinuddin Chisht\u012b practiced the Sufi ''Sulh-e-Kul'' (peace to all) concept to promote understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya===\n[[File:Rabia al-Adawiyya.jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of Rabi'a [[Mill (grinding)|grinding grain]] from a [[Persian language|Persian]] dictionary]]\n\n[[Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya]] or Rabia of Basra (died 801) was a mystic who represents countercultural elements of Sufism, especially with regards to the status and power of women.

Sufis often visit the shrine for [[ziyarat]], a term associated with religious visits and pilgrimages. Dargahs are often associated with Sufi eating and meeting rooms and hostels, called ''[[khanqah]]'' or hospices.

There is evidence that Sufism did influence the development of some schools of Jewish philosophy and ethics. In the first writing of this kind, we see \"Kitab al-Hidayah ila Fara'i\u1e0d al-\u1e32ulub\", ''[[Duties of the Heart]]'', of [[Bahya ibn Paquda]]. This book was translated by [[Judah ibn Tibbon]] into [[Hebrew]] under the title \"\u1e24\u014d\u1e07\u014d\u1e6f Ha-lle\u1e07\u0101\u1e07\u014d\u1e6f\".<ref>''A Sufi-Jewish Dialogue: Philosophy and Mysticism in Bahya ibn Paquda's Duties of the Heart'', Diana Lobel</ref>{{quote|The precepts prescribed by the [[Torah]] number 613 only; those dictated by the intellect are innumerable.}}\n\nIt is noteworthy that in the ethical writings of the Sufis [[Al-Kusajri]] and [[Harawi (genre)|Al-Harawi]] there are sections which treat of the same subjects as those treated in the \"\u1e24ovot ha-Lebabot\" and which bear the same titles: e.g., \"Bab al-Tawakkul\"; \"Bab al-Taubah\"; \"Bab al-Mu\u1e25asabah\"; \"Bab al-Tawa\u1e0du'\"; \"Bab al-Zuhd\". In the ninth gate, Ba\u1e25ya directly quotes sayings of the Sufis, whom he calls ''Perushim''. However, the author of the ''\u1e24\u014d\u1e07\u014d\u1e6f Ha-lle\u1e07\u0101\u1e07\u014d\u1e6f'' did not go so far as to approve of the asceticism of the Sufis, although he showed a marked predilection for their ethical principles.\n\n[[Avraham son of Rambam|Abraham ben Moses ben Maimon]], the son of the Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]], believed that Sufi practices and doctrines continue the tradition of the Biblical prophets. See Sefer Hammaspiq, \"Happerishuth\", Chapter 11 (\"Ha-mma\u02bfa\u1e07\u0101q\") s.v. hithbonen efo be-masoreth mufla'a zo, citing the Talmudic explanation of Jeremiah 13:27 in Chagigah 5b; in Rabbi Yaakov Wincelberg's translation, \"The Way of Serving God\" (Feldheim), p.&nbsp;429 and above, p.&nbsp;427. Also see ibid., Chapter 10 (\"Iqqu\u1e07im\"), s.v. wa-halo yo\u1e0fe\u02bea\u02bf atta; in \"The Way of Serving God\", p.&nbsp;371.\n\nAbraham Maimuni's principal work is originally composed in [[Judeo-Arabic]] and entitled \"\u05db\u05ea\u05d0\u05d1 \u05db\u05e4\u05d0\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05e2\u05d0\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9\u05df\" ''Kit\u0101b Kif\u0101yah al-'\u0100bid\u012bn'' (\"A Comprehensive Guide for the Servants of God\"). From the extant surviving portion it is conjectured that Maimuni's treatise was three times as long as his father's Guide for the Perplexed. In the book, Maimuni evidences a great appreciation for, and affinity to, Sufism. Followers of his path continued to foster a Jewish-Sufi form of pietism for at least a century, and he is rightly considered the founder of this pietistic school, which was centered in [[Egypt]].\n\nThe followers of this path, which they called, interchangeably, Hasidism (not to be confused with the [later] [[Jewish]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] movement) or Sufism (''Tasawwuf''), practiced spiritual retreats, solitude, fasting and sleep deprivation. The Jewish Sufis maintained their own [[Sufi order|brotherhood]], guided by a religious leader\u2014like a Sufi [[sheikh]].<ref name=\"revues\">{{cite web|url=http://bcrfj.revues.org/index2312.html |title=Jewish pietism of the Sufi type |author=Mireille Loubet |publisher=bcrfj.revues.org|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] in its entry on Sufism states that the revival of Jewish mysticism in Muslim countries is probably due to the spread of Sufism in the same geographical areas.
