It was first described by the French astronomer [[Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille]] in 1756 and visualized by him as a clock with a pendulum and a second hand. In 1922 the constellation was redefined by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) as a region of the celestial sphere containing Lacaille's stars, and has since been an [[IAU designated constellations|IAU designated constellation]]. Horologium's associated region is wholly visible to observers south of [[23rd parallel north|23\u00b0N]].\n\nThe constellation's brightest [[star]]\u2014and the only one brighter than an [[apparent magnitude]] of 4\u2014is [[Alpha Horologii]] (at 3.85), an ageing orange [[giant star]] that has swollen to around 11 times the diameter of the Sun. The [[Mira variable|long-period variable-brightness]] star, [[R Horologii]] (4.7 to 14.3), has one of the largest variations in brightness known for stars in the night sky visible to the unaided eye. Four star systems in the constellation are known to have [[exoplanet]]s; one\u2014[[Gliese 1061]]\u2014contains an exoplanet in its [[circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]].\n\n==History==\nThe French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] first described the [[constellation]] <!-- in French (obviously)--> as ''l'Horloge \u00e0 pendule & \u00e0 secondes'' (Clock with pendulum and seconds hand) in 1756,<ref name=ridpathlac>{{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm |title=Lacaille's Southern Planisphere of 1756 |work=Star Tales |author=Ridpath, Ian |publisher=Self-published |accessdate=19 March 2016 |author-link=Ian Ridpath |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193222/http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lacaille, Nicolas Louis |year=1756 |title=Relation abr\u00e9g\u00e9e du Voyage fait par ordre du Roi au cap de Bonne-esp\u00e9rance |journal=M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences |pages=519\u2013592 [588] |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k35505/f786 |language=French |access-date=2016-03-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119115952/http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k35505/f786 |archive-date=2016-11-19 |url-status=live }}</ref> after he had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the [[Cape of Good Hope]].

It was first described by the French astronomer [[Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille]] in 1756 and visualized by him as a clock with a pendulum and a second hand. In 1922 the constellation was redefined by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) as a region of the celestial sphere containing Lacaille's stars, and has since been an [[IAU designated constellations|IAU designated constellation]].

The [[Mira variable|long-period variable-brightness]] star, [[R Horologii]] (4.7 to 14.3), has one of the largest variations in brightness known for stars in the night sky visible to the unaided eye.
