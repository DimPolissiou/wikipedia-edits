Herbaceous peonies are also sold as [[cut flowers]] on a large scale, although generally only available in late spring and early summer.<ref name=KD /> An emerging source of peonies in mid to late summer is the Alaskan market.

Some species are [[caespitose]] (tufted), because the crown produces adventitious buds, while others have stolons. They have rather large compound leaves without [[gland (botany)|gland]]s and [[stipule]]s, and with anomocytic [[stoma]]ta. In the woody species the new growth emerges from scaly buds on the previous flush or from the crown of the rootstock. The large [[Flower#Floral function|bisexual flowers]] are mostly single at the end of the stem. In ''P. emodi'', ''P. lactiflora'', ''P. veitchii'' and many of the cultivars these contributed to, few additional flowers develop in the axils of the leaves. Flowers close at night or when the sky is overcast. Each flower is subtended by a number of bracts, that may form a sort of [[Bract#Involucral bracts|involucre]], has 3-7 tough free sepals and mostly 5-8, but occasionally up to 13 free petals. These categories however are intergrading, making it difficult to assign some of them, and the number of these parts may vary. Within are numerous (50\u2013160) free [[stamen]]s, with [[anther]]s fixed at their base to the filaments, and are sagittate in shape, open with longitudal slits [[Dehiscence (botany)#Anther dehiscence|at the outer side]] and free [[pollen]] grains which have three slits or pores and consist of  two cells. Within the circle of stamens is a more or less prominent, lobed [[Glossary of plant morphology#Disk|disc]], which is presumed not to excrete [[nectar]]. Within the disk is a varying number (1-15) of separate [[carpel]]s, which have a very short [[Stigma (botany)#Style|style]] and a decurrent [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]]. Each of these develops into a dry fruit (which is called a [[Follicle (fruit)|follicle]]), which opens with a lengthwise suture and each of which contains one or a few large fleshy seeds. The annual growth is predetermined: if the growing tip of a shoot is removed, no new buds will develop that season.<ref name=KD /><ref name=APW>{{cite web|website= ANGIOSPERM PHYLOGENY WEBSITE|title= Saxifragales|url= http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/apweb/orders/saxifragalesweb.htm|accessdate= 2016-04-26}}</ref><ref name=WD>{{cite web|website= The families of flowering plants|title= Paeoniaceae Rudolphi|authors= L.

Only about half of the (sub)species is diploid, the other half tetraploid, while some species both have diploid and tetraploid populations. In addition to the tetraploids, are some diploid species also likely the result of hybridisation, or [[nothotaxon|nothospecies]]. Known diploid taxa in the ''Paeonia''-section are ''P. anomala'', ''P. lactiflora'', ''P. veitchii'', ''P. tenuifolia'', ''P. emodi'', ''P. broteri'', ''P. cambedessedesii'', ''P. clusii'', ''P. rhodia'', ''P. daurica'' subsps. ''coriifolia'', ''daurica'', ''macrophylla'' and ''mlokosewitschii''. Tetraploid taxa are ''P. arietina'', ''P. officinalis'', ''P. parnassica'', ''P. banatica'', ''P. russi'', ''P. peregrina'', ''P. coriacea'', ''P. mascula'' subsps. ''hellenica'' and ''mascula'', and ''P. daurica'' subsps. ''tomentosa'' and ''wittmanniana''. Species that have both diploid and tetraploid populations include ''P. clusii'', ''P. mairei'' and ''P. obovata''. ''P. anomala'' was proven to be a hybrid of ''P. lactiflora'' and ''P. veitchii'', although being a diploid with 10 chromosomes. ''P. emodi'' and ''P. sterniana'' are diploid hybrids of ''P. lactiflora'' and ''P. veitchii'' too, and radically different in appearance. ''P. russi'' is the tetraploid hybrid of diploid ''P. lactiflora'' and ''P. mairei'', while ''P. cambedessedesii'' is the diploid hybrid of  ''P. lactiflora'', likely  ''P. mairei'', but possibly also ''P. obovata''. ''P. peregrina'' is the tetraploid hybrid of ''P. anomala'' and either ''P. arietina'', ''P. humilis'', ''P. officinalis'', ''P. parnassica'' or less likely ''P. tenuifolia'', or one of their (now extinct) common ancestors. ''P. banatica'' is the tetraploid hybrid of ''P. mairei'' and one of this same group. ''P. broteri'', ''P. coriacea'', ''P. clusii'', ''P. rhodia'', ''P. daurica'' subsp. ''mlokosewitschi'', ''P. mascula'' subsp. ''hellenica'' and ssp. ''mascula'', and ''P. daurica'' subsp.

The section ''[[Tree peony|Moutan]]'', which includes all woody species, is restricted in the wild to Central and Southern China, including Tibet. The section ''Onaepia'' consist of two herbaceous species and is present in the West of North-America, ''[[Paeonia brownii|P.&nbsp;brownii]]'' between southern British Columbia and the Sierra Nevada in California and eastward to Wyoming and Utah, while ''[[Paeonia californica|P.&nbsp;californica]]'' is limited to the coastal mountains of Southern and Central California.\n\nThe section ''Paeonia'', which comprises all other herbaceous species, occurs in a band stretching roughly from Morocco to Japan.\nOne species of the section ''Paeonia'', ''[[Paeonia anomala|P.&nbsp;anomala]]'', has by far the largest distribution, which is also north of the distribution of the other species: from the [[Kola peninsula]] in North-West Russia, to [[Lake Baikal]] in Siberia and South to the [[Tien Shan]] Mountains of Kazakhstan. The rest of the section concentrates around the Mediterranean, and in Asia.\n\nThe species around the Mediterranean include ''[[Paeonia algeriensis]]'' that is an [[Endemism|endemic]] of the coastal mountains of Algeria, ''[[Paeonia cariacea|P. coriacea]]'' in the [[Rif Mountains]] and [[Andalusia]], ''[[Paeonia cambessedesii|P.&nbsp;cambessedesii]]'' on [[Majorca]], ''[[Paeonia russoi|P.&nbsp;russoi]]'' on [[Corsica]], [[Sardinia]] and [[Sicilly]], ''[[Paeonia corsica|P. corsica]]'' on Corsica, Sardinia, the [[Ionian Islands (region)|Ionian islands]] and in western Greece'', [[Paeonia clusii|P.&nbsp;clusii]]'' subsp.

Genetic analysis has shown that all Mediterranean species are either [[Ploidy#Diploid|diploid]] or tetraploid hybrids that resulted from the [[crossbreeding]] of species currently limited to eastern Asia. The large distance between the ranges of the parent species and the [[nothospecies]] suggest that hybridisation already occurred  relatively long ago. It is likely that the parent species occurred in the same region when the hybrids arose, and were later exterminated by successive Pleistocene glaciations, while the nothospecies remained in refugia to the South of Europe. During their retreat ''P. lactiflora'' and ''P. mairei'' likely became [[Sympatry|sympatric]] and so produced the Himalayan nothospecies ''P. emodi'' and ''P. sterniana''.<ref name=SCS />\n\n{{multiple image\n|align = center\n|image1 =  Distribution map paeonia europa.png\n|image2 = Distribution map paeonia europa west.png\n|footer = Distribution maps of the species of paeonia Europe und western Asia.

Ornamental cultivars were created from plants cultivated for medicine in China as of the sixth and seventh century. Peonies became particularly popular during the [[Tang dynasty]], when they were grown in the imperial gardens. In the tenth century the cultivation of peonies spread through China, and the seat of the [[Sung dynasty]], [[Luoyang]], was the centre for its cultivation, a position it still holds today. A second centre for peony cultivation developed during the [[Qing dynasty]] in C\u00e1ozh\u014du, now known as [[Heze|He Ze]]. Both cities still host annual peony exhibitions and state-funded peony research facilities. Before the tenth century, ''P. lactiflora'' was introduced in Japan, and over time many varieties were developed both by [[Reproduction#Autogamy|self fertilisation]] and [[crossbreed]]ing, particularly during the eighteenth to twentieth centuries (middle [[Edo period|Edo]] to early [[Sh\u014dwa period]]s). During the 1940s Toichi Itoh succeeded in crossing tree peonies and herbaceous peonies and so created a new class of so-called [[#Plant_growth_habits|intersectional hybrids]]. Although ''P. officinalis'' and its cultivars were grown in Europe from the fifteenth century on, originally also for medicinal purposes, intensive breeding started only in the nineteenth century when ''P. lactiflora'' was introduced from its native China to Europe. The tree peony was introduced in Europe and planted in [[Kew Gardens]] in 1789. The main centre of peony breeding in Europe has been in the United Kingdom, and particularly France. Here, breeders like [[Victor Lemoine]] and Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9lix Crousse selected many new varieties, mainly with ''P. lactiflora'', such as \"Avant Garde\" and \"Le Printemps\". The Netherlands is the largest peony cut flower producing country with about 50 million stems each year, with \"Sarah Bernhardt\" dominating the sales with over 20 million stems.<ref name=KD />\n\n=== Plant growth habits ===\nPeony species come in two distinct growth habits, while hybrid cultivars in addition may occupy an intermediate habit.\n* '''herbaceous''': During summer, renewal buds develop on the underground stem (the \"crown\"), particularly at the foot of the current season's annual shoots.

In [[Japan]], ''[[Paeonia lactiflora]]'' used to be called ''ebisugusuri'' (\"foreign medicine\"). Pronunciation of \u7261\u4e39 (peony) in Japan is \"botan.\" In ''[[kampo]]'' (the Japanese adaptation of [[traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medicine]]), its root was used as a treatment for convulsions. It is also cultivated as a [[garden plant]]. In Japan ''[[Paeonia suffruticosa]]'' is called the \"King of Flowers\" and ''[[Paeonia lactiflora]]'' is called the \"Prime Minister of Flowers.\"<ref>Sasaki, Sanmi. 2005.

It is also known as \u5bcc\u8cb4\u82b1 (f\u00f9gu\u00echu\u0101) \"flower of riches and honour\" or \u82b1\u738b (huawang) \"king of the flowers\", and is used symbolically in Chinese art.<ref>Terese Tse Bartholomew, ''Hidden Meanings in Chinese Art'' (San Francisco: Asian Art Museum/Chong-Moon Lee Center for Asian Art and Culture), 2006.</ref> In 1903, the [[Qing dynasty]] declared the peony as the national flower. Currently, the [[Republic of China]] government in [[Taiwan]] designates the plum blossom as the [[national flower]], while the [[People's Republic of China]] government has no legally designated national flower. In 1994, the peony was proposed as the national flower after a nationwide poll, but the [[National People's Congress]] failed to ratify the selection. In 2003, another selection process was initiated, but no choice has been made to date.\n\nThe ancient Chinese city [[Luoyang]] has a reputation as a cultivation centre for the peonies. Throughout [[Chinese history]], peonies in Luoyang have been said to be the finest in the country. Dozens of peony exhibitions and shows are still held there annually.\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], peonies were often painted with their ripe seed-capsules, since it was the seeds, not the flowers, which were medically significant.<ref name=TWOTP /> Ancient superstition dictated that great care be taken not to be seen by a [[woodpecker]] while picking the plant's fruit, or the bird might peck out one's eyes.<ref>Sowerby, James & John Edward. 1899.

The popular use of peonies in [[Japanese tattoo]] was inspired by the [[ukiyo-e]] artist [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]]'s illustrations of ''[[Water Margin|Suikoden]]'', a classical Chinese novel. His paintings of warrior-heroes covered in pictorial tattoos included lions, tigers, dragons, koi fish, and peonies, among other symbols. The peony became a masculine motif, associated with a devil-may-care attitude and disregard for consequence.\n\nFamous painters of peonies have included [[Conrad Gessner]] (ca. 1550) and [[Auguste Renoir]] in 1879.

Some species are [[caespitose]] (tufted), because the crown produces adventitious buds, while others have stolons. They have rather large compound leaves without [[gland (botany)|gland]]s and [[stipule]]s, and with anomocytic [[stoma]]ta. In the woody species the new growth emerges from scaly buds on the previous flush or from the crown of the rootstock. The large [[Flower#Floral function|bisexual flowers]] are mostly single at the end of the stem. In ''P. emodi'', ''P. lactiflora'', ''P. veitchii'' and many of the cultivars these contributed to, few additional flowers develop in the axils of the leaves. Flowers close at night or when the sky is overcast. Each flower is subtended by a number of bracts, that may form a sort of [[Bract#Involucral bracts|involucre]], has 3-7 tough free sepals and mostly 5-8, but occasionally up to 13 free petals. These categories however are intergrading, making it difficult to assign some of them, and the number of these parts may vary. Within are numerous (50\u2013160) free [[stamen]]s, with [[anther]]s fixed at their base to the filaments, and are sagittate in shape, open with longitudal slits [[Dehiscence (botany)#Anther dehiscence|at the outer side]] and free [[pollen]] grains which have three slits or pores and consist of  two cells. Within the circle of stamens is a more or less prominent, lobed [[Glossary of plant morphology#Disk|disc]], which is presumed not to excrete [[nectar]]. Within the disk is a varying number (1-15) of separate [[carpel]]s, which have a very short [[Stigma (botany)#Style|style]] and a decurrent [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]]. Each of these develops into a dry fruit (which is called a [[Follicle (fruit)|follicle]]), which opens with a lengthwise suture and each of which contains one or a few large fleshy seeds. The annual growth is predetermined: if the growing tip of a shoot is removed, no new buds will develop that season.<ref name=KD /><ref name=APW>{{cite web|website= ANGIOSPERM PHYLOGENY WEBSITE|title= Saxifragales|url= http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/apweb/orders/saxifragalesweb.htm|accessdate= 2016-04-26}}</ref><ref name=WD>{{cite web|website= The families of flowering plants|title= Paeoniaceae Rudolphi|authors= L.

The section ''[[Tree peony|Moutan]]'', which includes all woody species, is restricted in the wild to Central and Southern China, including Tibet. The section ''Onaepia'' consist of two herbaceous species and is present in the West of North-America, ''[[Paeonia brownii|P.&nbsp;brownii]]'' between southern British Columbia and the Sierra Nevada in California and eastward to Wyoming and Utah, while ''[[Paeonia californica|P.&nbsp;californica]]'' is limited to the coastal mountains of Southern and Central California.\n\nThe section ''Paeonia'', which comprises all other herbaceous species, occurs in a band stretching roughly from Morocco to Japan.\nOne species of the section ''Paeonia'', ''[[Paeonia anomala|P.&nbsp;anomala]]'', has by far the largest distribution, which is also north of the distribution of the other species: from the [[Kola peninsula]] in North-West Russia, to [[Lake Baikal]] in Siberia and South to the [[Tien Shan]] Mountains of Kazakhstan. The rest of the section concentrates around the Mediterranean, and in Asia.\n\nThe species around the Mediterranean include ''[[Paeonia algeriensis]]'' that is an [[Endemism|endemic]] of the coastal mountains of Algeria, ''[[Paeonia cariacea|P. coriacea]]'' in the [[Rif Mountains]] and [[Andalusia]], ''[[Paeonia cambessedesii|P.&nbsp;cambessedesii]]'' on [[Majorca]], ''[[Paeonia russoi|P.&nbsp;russoi]]'' on [[Corsica]], [[Sardinia]] and [[Sicilly]], ''[[Paeonia corsica|P. corsica]]'' on Corsica, Sardinia, the [[Ionian Islands (region)|Ionian islands]] and in western Greece'', [[Paeonia clusii|P.&nbsp;clusii]]'' subsp.

Genetic analysis has shown that all Mediterranean species are either [[Ploidy#Diploid|diploid]] or tetraploid hybrids that resulted from the [[crossbreeding]] of species currently limited to eastern Asia. The large distance between the ranges of the parent species and the [[nothospecies]] suggest that hybridisation already occurred  relatively long ago. It is likely that the parent species occurred in the same region when the hybrids arose, and were later exterminated by successive Pleistocene glaciations, while the nothospecies remained in refugia to the South of Europe. During their retreat ''P. lactiflora'' and ''P. mairei'' likely became [[Sympatry|sympatric]] and so produced the Himalayan nothospecies ''P. emodi'' and ''P. sterniana''.<ref name=SCS />\n\n{{multiple image\n|align = center\n|image1 =  Distribution map paeonia europa.png\n|image2 = Distribution map paeonia europa west.png\n|footer = Distribution maps of the species of paeonia Europe und western Asia.

Ornamental cultivars were created from plants cultivated for medicine in China as of the sixth and seventh century. Peonies became particularly popular during the [[Tang dynasty]], when they were grown in the imperial gardens. In the tenth century the cultivation of peonies spread through China, and the seat of the [[Sung dynasty]], [[Luoyang]], was the centre for its cultivation, a position it still holds today. A second centre for peony cultivation developed during the [[Qing dynasty]] in C\u00e1ozh\u014du, now known as [[Heze|He Ze]]. Both cities still host annual peony exhibitions and state-funded peony research facilities. Before the tenth century, ''P. lactiflora'' was introduced in Japan, and over time many varieties were developed both by [[Reproduction#Autogamy|self fertilisation]] and [[crossbreed]]ing, particularly during the eighteenth to twentieth centuries (middle [[Edo period|Edo]] to early [[Sh\u014dwa period]]s). During the 1940s Toichi Itoh succeeded in crossing tree peonies and herbaceous peonies and so created a new class of so-called [[#Plant_growth_habits|intersectional hybrids]]. Although ''P. officinalis'' and its cultivars were grown in Europe from the fifteenth century on, originally also for medicinal purposes, intensive breeding started only in the nineteenth century when ''P. lactiflora'' was introduced from its native China to Europe. The tree peony was introduced in Europe and planted in [[Kew Gardens]] in 1789. The main centre of peony breeding in Europe has been in the United Kingdom, and particularly France. Here, breeders like [[Victor Lemoine]] and Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9lix Crousse selected many new varieties, mainly with ''P. lactiflora'', such as \"Avant Garde\" and \"Le Printemps\". The Netherlands is the largest peony cut flower producing country with about 50 million stems each year, with \"Sarah Bernhardt\" dominating the sales with over 20 million stems.<ref name=KD />\n\n=== Plant growth habits ===\nPeony species come in two distinct growth habits, while hybrid cultivars in addition may occupy an intermediate habit.\n* '''herbaceous''': During summer, renewal buds develop on the underground stem (the \"crown\"), particularly at the foot of the current season's annual shoots. These renewal buds come in various sizes. Large buds will grow into stems the following growing season, but smaller buds remain dormant. The [[primordia]] for the leaves can already be found in June, but the flower only starts differentiating in October, as the annual shoots die down, completing its development in December, when sepals, petals, stamens and pistils are all recognisable.<ref name=KD>{{cite journal|first1= Rina|last1= Kamenetsky|first2= John|last2= Dole|year= 2012|title= Herbaceous Peony (Paeonia): Genetics, Physiology and Cut Flower Production|journal= Floriculture and Ornamental Biotechnology|volume= 6|issue= Special Issue 1|pages= 62\u201377|url= http://www.globalsciencebooks.info/Online/GSBOnline/images/2012/FOB_6(SI1)/FOB_6(SI1)62-77o.pdf|accessdate= 2016-04-29}}</ref>\n* '''tree''': During the summer, large buds develop at the tip of the annual growth and near its foot. In the autumn, the leaves are shed, and the new stems become woody and are perennial.\n* '''Itoh''' (or \"Intersectional\"): In 1948 horticulturist Toichi Itoh from Tokyo used pollen from the yellow tree peony \"Alice Harding\" to fertilize the herbaceous ''P. lactiflora'' \"Katoden\", which resulted in a new category of peonies, the Itoh or intersectional cultivars. These are herbaceous, have leaves like tree peonies, with many large flowers from late spring to early autumn, and good peony wilt resistance. Some of the early Itoh cultivars are \"Yellow Crown\", \"Yellow Dream\", \"Yellow Emperor\" and \"Yellow Heaven\".<ref>{{cite book|first1= I.|last1= Pauwels|first2= G.|last2= Vervoort|year= 2009|title= Pioenen [Peonies]|edition= 1: in volle glorie [in full splendor]|publisher= Uitgever Lannoo Uitgeverij|isbn= 978-9020965070|pages= 143}}</ref>\n\n=== Flower types ===\nSix types of flower are generally distinguished in cultivars of herbaceous peonies.\n* '''single''': a single or double row of broad petals encircle fertile stamens, carpels visible.\n* '''Japanese''': a single or double row of broad petals encircle somewhat broadened [[staminode]]s, may carry pollen along the edges, carpels visible.\n* '''anemone''': a single or double row of broad petals encircle narrow incurved petal-like staminodes; fertile stamens are absent, carpels visible.\n* '''semi-double''': a single or double row of broad petals encircles further broad petals intermingled with stamens.\n* '''bomb''': a single row of broad petals encircles a shorter dense pompon of narrower petals.\n* '''double''': the flower consists of many broad petals only, including those which likely are altered stamens and carpels.<ref name=KD />\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Paeonia Claire de Lune1a.UME.JPG|''Paeonia \u00d7arendsii'' \"Claire de Lune\",<br> single flowered\nFile:Paeonia 'Walter Mains'.jpg|''Paeonia'' \"Walter Mains\",<br> Japanese flowered\nFile:BowlOfBeauty1b.UME.JPG|''Paeonia lactiflora'' \"Bowl Of Beauty\",<br> anemone flowered\nFile:Paeonia lactiflora 'James Kelway'.JPG|''Paeonia lactiflora'' \"James Kelway\",<br> semi-double flowered\nFile:Paeonia 'Ruth Clay' 14.JPG|''Paeonia'' \"Ruth Clay\",<br> bomb flowered\nFile:Paeonia Da Fu Gui.jpg|''Paeonia lactiflora'' \"Da Fu Gui\",<br> double flowered\n</gallery>\n\n=== Propagation ===\nHerbaceous and Itoh peonies are propagated by root division, and sometimes by seed.

In [[Japan]], ''[[Paeonia lactiflora]]'' used to be called ''ebisugusuri'' (\"foreign medicine\"). Pronunciation of \u7261\u4e39 (peony) in Japan is \"botan.\" In ''[[kampo]]'' (the Japanese adaptation of [[traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medicine]]), its root was used as a treatment for convulsions. It is also cultivated as a [[garden plant]].

Along with the [[Ume|plum blossom]], it is a traditional floral symbol of China, where the ''[[Paeonia suffruticosa]]'' is called \u7261\u4e39 (m\u01d4d\u0101n). It is also known as \u5bcc\u8cb4\u82b1 (f\u00f9gu\u00echu\u0101) \"flower of riches and honour\" or \u82b1\u738b (huawang) \"king of the flowers\", and is used symbolically in Chinese art.<ref>Terese Tse Bartholomew, ''Hidden Meanings in Chinese Art'' (San Francisco: Asian Art Museum/Chong-Moon Lee Center for Asian Art and Culture), 2006.</ref> In 1903, the [[Qing dynasty]] declared the peony as the national flower. Currently, the [[Republic of China]] government in [[Taiwan]] designates the plum blossom as the [[national flower]], while the [[People's Republic of China]] government has no legally designated national flower. In 1994, the peony was proposed as the national flower after a nationwide poll, but the [[National People's Congress]] failed to ratify the selection. In 2003, another selection process was initiated, but no choice has been made to date.\n\nThe ancient Chinese city [[Luoyang]] has a reputation as a cultivation centre for the peonies. Throughout [[Chinese history]], peonies in Luoyang have been said to be the finest in the country. Dozens of peony exhibitions and shows are still held there annually.\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], peonies were often painted with their ripe seed-capsules, since it was the seeds, not the flowers, which were medically significant.<ref name=TWOTP /> Ancient superstition dictated that great care be taken not to be seen by a [[woodpecker]] while picking the plant's fruit, or the bird might peck out one's eyes.<ref>Sowerby, James & John Edward. 1899.

It replaced the [[zinnia]], which had been the state flower since 1931.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/indiana/state-flower/peony|title=Peony|publisher=State Symbols USA|language=English|accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMischievous nymphs were said to hide in the petals of the Peony, giving it the meaning of Shame or Bashfulness in the [[Language of flowers|Language of Flowers]]. While the peony takes several years to re-establish itself when moved, it blooms annually for decades once it has done so.<ref>The Language of Flowers, edited by Sheila Pickles, 1990</ref>\n\nPeonies tend to attract [[ant]]s to the flower buds. This is due to the nectar that forms on the outside of the flower buds, and is not required for the plants' own pollination or other growth.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.peonies.org/cgi-bin/faqindex.cgi |title= HPS Frequently Asked Questions: Ants on Peonies |publisher= Heartland Peony Society |accessdate= 2010-05-02 }}</ref> The presence of ants is thought to provide some deterrence to other harmful insects though, so the production of ant-attracting nectar is plausibly a functional adaptation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ipm.missouri.edu/MEG/2018/5/antsOnPeonies/|title=Ants on Peony Flowers: An Example of Biological Mutualism|website=Integrated Pest Management - University of Missouri}}</ref>\n\nPeonies are a common subject in tattoos, often used along with koi-fish. The popular use of peonies in [[Japanese tattoo]] was inspired by the [[ukiyo-e]] artist [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]]'s illustrations of ''[[Water Margin|Suikoden]]'', a classical Chinese novel. His paintings of warrior-heroes covered in pictorial tattoos included lions, tigers, dragons, koi fish, and peonies, among other symbols. The peony became a masculine motif, associated with a devil-may-care attitude and disregard for consequence.\n\nFamous painters of peonies have included [[Conrad Gessner]] (ca. 1550) and [[Auguste Renoir]] in 1879. ''Paeonia officinalis'' can be found in the altar picture of ''Maria im Rosenhag'' by [[Schongauer]] in the former Dominican Church in [[Colmar]].<ref name=TWOTP>{{cite web|url=http://www.paeonia.ch/welte/einfe1.htm|author=Walter Good|title=The World of the Peony|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313051423/http://www.paeonia.ch/welte/einfe1.htm|archive-date=13 March 2016}}</ref> The Italian Jesuit, painter and architect [[Giuseppe Castiglione (Jesuit)|Giuseppe Castiglione]] (1688-1766), who worked at the court of the [[Qianlong Emperor]] in the [[Qing dynasty]], painted peonies.\n{{clear}}\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |last1=Auer |first1=James D. |last2=Greenberg |first2=Joshua |title=Peonies: An Economic Background for Alaska Flower Growers |url=https://www.uaf.edu/files/snre/MP_09_08.pdf |website=SNRAS/AFES Miscellaneous Publication MP 2009-08 |publisher=School of Natural Resources & Agricultural Resources, [[University of Alaska, Fairbanks]] |date=June 2009|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikispecies|Paeonia}}\n{{Commons|Paeonia}}\n* [http://www.plantsystematics.org/reveal/pbio/fam/supgennames.html Family and Suprafamilial Names] At: [http://www.plantsystematics.org/reveal/ James L.
