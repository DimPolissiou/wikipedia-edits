It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an [[apex predator]], primarily preying on [[ungulate]]s such as [[deer]] and [[wild boar]]. It is territorial and generally a [[solitary but social]] predator, requiring large contiguous areas of [[habitat]], which support its requirements for [[prey]] and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's [[home range]] to establish their own.\n\nThe tiger once ranged widely from the [[Eastern Anatolia Region]] in the west to the [[Amur River]] basin, and in the south from the foothills of the [[Himalayas]] to [[Bali]] in the [[Sunda islands]]. Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in [[Western Asia|Western]] and [[Central Asia]], from the islands of [[Java]] and Bali, and in large areas of [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]] and [[South Asia]] and [[China]]. Today's tiger range is fragmented, stretching from [[Siberia]]n [[temperate forest]]s to subtropical and [[tropical forest]]s on the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Sumatra]]. \n\nThe tiger is listed as [[Endangered species|Endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 1986. As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, down from around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century, with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other. Major reasons for population decline include [[habitat destruction]], [[habitat fragmentation]] and [[poaching]]. This, coupled with the fact that it lives in some of the more [[Population density|densely populated places]] on Earth, has caused significant [[Human-animal interaction|conflicts with humans]].\n\nThe tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's [[charismatic megafauna]]. It featured prominently in ancient [[mythology]] and [[folklore]] and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many [[flag]]s, [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] and as [[mascot]]s for sporting teams. The tiger is the [[national animal]] of [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Malaysia]] and [[South Korea]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe [[Middle English]] ''tigre'' and [[Old English]] ''tigras'' (plural)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/tiger |title=tiger |work=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref> derive from Old French ''tigre'', from [[Latin]] ''tigris''. \nThis was a borrowing of [[Classical Greek]] \u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 'tigris', a foreign borrowing of unknown origin meaning 'tiger' as well as the river [[Tigris]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=Liddell, H.

[[Morphology (biology)|Morphologically]], tigers from different regions vary little, and [[gene flow]] between populations in those regions is considered to have been possible during the [[Pleistocene]]. Therefore, it was proposed to recognize only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely ''[[Mainland Asian tiger|P. t. tigris]]'' in mainland Asia, and ''[[Sunda Island tiger|P. t. sondaica]]'' in the [[Greater Sunda Islands]].<ref name=Kitchener1999>{{cite book |last=Kitchener |first=A. |date=1999 |chapter=Tiger distribution, phenotypic variation and conservation issues |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=dbQ8AAAAIAAJ&lpg=PR5&ots=ewzqdVGUOy&pg=PA19#v=onepage&q&f=false |editor1-last=Seidensticker |editor1-first=J. |editor2-last=Christie |editor2-first=S. |editor3-last=Jackson |editor3-first=P. |title=Riding the Tiger: Tiger Conservation in Human-Dominated Landscapes |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=19\u201339 |isbn=978-0521648356 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nResults of [[craniology|craniological]] analysis of 111 tiger skulls from Southeast Asian range countries indicate that Sumatran tiger skulls differ from Indochinese and Javan tiger skulls, whereas Bali tiger skulls are similar in size to Javan tiger skulls.

The authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely ''P. t. tigris'' comprising the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and ''P. t. sondaica'' comprising the Javan, Bali and Sumatran tiger populations. The authors also noted that this reclassification will affect tiger conservation management.

A single maharaja or English hunter could claim to kill over a hundred tigers in their hunting career.<ref name = Walker /> Tiger hunting was done by some hunters on foot; others sat up on ''[[Hunting blind|machans]]'' with a goat or buffalo tied out as bait; yet others on elephant-back.<ref name=\"Tiger-hunting\">''Royal Tiger'' (nom-de-plume) in ''The Manpoora Tiger \u2013 about a Tiger Hunt in Rajpootanah''.

The trade in tiger skins peaked in the 1960s, just before international conservation efforts took effect.

It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an [[apex predator]], primarily preying on [[ungulate]]s such as [[deer]] and [[wild boar]]. It is territorial and generally a [[solitary but social]] predator, requiring large contiguous areas of [[habitat]], which support its requirements for [[prey]] and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's [[home range]] to establish their own.\n\nThe tiger once ranged widely from the [[Eastern Anatolia Region]] in the west to the [[Amur River]] basin, and in the south from the foothills of the [[Himalayas]] to [[Bali]] in the [[Sunda islands]]. Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in [[Western Asia|Western]] and [[Central Asia]], from the islands of [[Java]] and Bali, and in large areas of [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]] and [[South Asia]] and [[China]]. Today's tiger range is fragmented, stretching from [[Siberia]]n [[temperate forest]]s to subtropical and [[tropical forest]]s on the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Sumatra]]. \n\nThe tiger is listed as [[Endangered species|Endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 1986. As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, down from around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century, with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other. Major reasons for population decline include [[habitat destruction]], [[habitat fragmentation]] and [[poaching]]. This, coupled with the fact that it lives in some of the more [[Population density|densely populated places]] on Earth, has caused significant [[Human-animal interaction|conflicts with humans]].\n\nThe tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's [[charismatic megafauna]]. It featured prominently in ancient [[mythology]] and [[folklore]] and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many [[flag]]s, [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] and as [[mascot]]s for sporting teams. The tiger is the [[national animal]] of [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Malaysia]] and [[South Korea]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe [[Middle English]] ''tigre'' and [[Old English]] ''tigras'' (plural)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/tiger |title=tiger |work=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref> derive from Old French ''tigre'', from [[Latin]] ''tigris''. \nThis was a borrowing of [[Classical Greek]] \u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 'tigris', a foreign borrowing of unknown origin meaning 'tiger' as well as the river [[Tigris]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=Liddell, H.

Most putative subspecies described in the 19th and 20th centuries were distinguished on basis of fur length and colouration, striping patterns and body size, hence characteristics that vary widely within populations. [[Morphology (biology)|Morphologically]], tigers from different regions vary little, and [[gene flow]] between populations in those regions is considered to have been possible during the [[Pleistocene]]. Therefore, it was proposed to recognize only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely ''[[Mainland Asian tiger|P. t. tigris]]'' in mainland Asia, and ''[[Sunda Island tiger|P. t. sondaica]]'' in the [[Greater Sunda Islands]].<ref name=Kitchener1999>{{cite book |last=Kitchener |first=A. |date=1999 |chapter=Tiger distribution, phenotypic variation and conservation issues |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=dbQ8AAAAIAAJ&lpg=PR5&ots=ewzqdVGUOy&pg=PA19#v=onepage&q&f=false |editor1-last=Seidensticker |editor1-first=J. |editor2-last=Christie |editor2-first=S. |editor3-last=Jackson |editor3-first=P. |title=Riding the Tiger: Tiger Conservation in Human-Dominated Landscapes |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=19\u201339 |isbn=978-0521648356 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nResults of [[craniology|craniological]] analysis of 111 tiger skulls from Southeast Asian range countries indicate that Sumatran tiger skulls differ from Indochinese and Javan tiger skulls, whereas Bali tiger skulls are similar in size to Javan tiger skulls.

The authors also noted that this reclassification will affect tiger conservation management.

Tiger hunting took place on a large scale in the early 19th and 20th centuries, being a recognised and admired sport by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|colonial India]] as well as the [[maharaja]]s and aristocratic class of the erstwhile princely states of pre-independence India. A single maharaja or English hunter could claim to kill over a hundred tigers in their hunting career.<ref name = Walker /> Tiger hunting was done by some hunters on foot; others sat up on ''[[Hunting blind|machans]]'' with a goat or buffalo tied out as bait; yet others on elephant-back.<ref name=\"Tiger-hunting\">''Royal Tiger'' (nom-de-plume) in ''The Manpoora Tiger \u2013 about a Tiger Hunt in Rajpootanah''. (1836) ''Bengal Sporting Magazine'', Vol IV. reproduced in ''The Treasures of Indian Wildlife''</ref>\n\nHistorically, tigers have been hunted at a large scale so their famous striped skins could be collected. The trade in tiger skins peaked in the 1960s, just before international conservation efforts took effect. By 1977, a tiger skin in an [[England|English]] market was considered to be worth US$4,250.<ref name = Walker />\n\n=== Body parts ===\n{{See also|Tiger penis}}\nTiger parts are commonly used as [[amulet]]s in [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. In the Philippines, the fossils in Palawan were found besides stone tools. This, besides the evidence for cuts on the bones, and the use of fire, suggests that early humans had accumulated the bones,<ref name=\"Piper_al2008\"/> and the condition of the tiger subfossils, dated to approximately 12,000 to 9,000 years ago, differed from other fossils in the assemblage, dated to the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. The tiger subfossils showed longitudinal fracture of the [[cortical bone]] due to weathering, which suggests that they had [[post-mortem]] been exposed to light and air.

It was the principal nationalist movement during the [[Algerian War]] and the sole legal and the ruling political party of the Algerian state until other parties were legalised in 1989.<ref>''Europa World Year Book 2014'', p565</ref> The FLN was established in 1954 from a split in the [[Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties]] from members of the [[Special Organisation (Algeria)|Special Organisation]] paramilitary; its armed wing, the [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)|National Liberation Army]], participated in the Algerian War from 1954 to 1962. After the [[\u00c9vian Accords]] of 1962, the party purged internal dissent and ruled Algeria as a [[one-party state]]. After the [[1988 October Riots]] and the [[Algerian Civil War]] (1991-2002) against Islamist groups, the FLN was reelected to power in the [[2002 Algerian legislative election]], and has generally remained in power ever since, although sometimes needing to form coalitions with other parties.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Colonial era ===\n\nThe background of the FLN can be traced back to the growing darthtoasterghost subscxorbeand Algerian nationalist sentiments since the outbreak of [[WWII]]. The repression against the Algerian Muslim population intensified as [[Abdelhamid Ben Badis]] got placed under house arrest and [[Marshal P\u00e9tain]]'s government banned the Algerian Communist Party and [[Algerian People's Party]].<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p. 49</ref> As the war turned gradually more in favor of the Western Allies, given the US's global engagement and its ideological campaign against colonialism, the core sentiment amongst the Algerian nationalists was to use the victory in Europe to promote the independence of the country, which is reflected by the issuing of the Manifesto of the Algerian People by [[Ferhat Abbas]].<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p. 50</ref> As this objective failed to realize, a new party [[Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties]] (MTDL) founded by the just-released [[Messali Hadj]] started to gain momentum and took the lead in the nationalist movement.<ref>Britannica, The Editors of Encyclopaedia. \"Ahmed Messali Hadj.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

(2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p. 53</ref> Consequently, the Algerian nationalists veered to a more military approach as noted in their participation in the [[Special Organisation (Algeria)]], which is a paramilitary component of the MTLD and included the important figures in Algerian politics such [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed]], and [[Mohammed Boudiaf]].\n\nLater in 1951, the capture of Ahmed Ben Bella and the subsequent dismantling of the Special Organisation temporarily subdued the nationalist movement but sparkled the desire inside the Special Organisation militants to form a new organization \u2013 [[Revolutionary Committee of Unity and Action]](CRUA).<ref name=MJ>McDougall, James. A History of Algeria New York: Cambridge University Press, 2017. p. 194</ref> It initially had a five-man leadership consisting of [[Mostefa Ben Boula\u00efd]], [[Larbi Ben M'hidi]], [[Rabah Bitat]], [[Mohamed Boudiaf]] and [[Mourad Didouche]].

[[Abane Ramdane]] was recruited to take control of the FLN's Algiers campaign, and went on to become one of its most effective leaders.<ref name=FT/> By 1956 nearly all the nationalist organizations in Algeria had joined the FLN, which had established itself as the main nationalist group through both co-opting and coercing smaller organizations; the most important group that remained outside the FLN was [[Messali Hadj]]'s [[Algerian National Movement]] (MNA). At this time the FLN reorganized into something like a provisional government, consisting of a five-man executive and legislative body, and was organized territorially into six [[Wilayah|wilayas]], following the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-era administrative boundaries.<ref>S. N. Millar, \"Arab Victory: Lessons from the Algerian War (1954\u201362)\", ''British Army Review'', No. 145, Autumn 2008, p. 49.</ref>\n\nThe FLN's armed wing during the war was called the [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)|National Liberation Army]] (ALN). It was divided into [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] units fighting France and the MNA in Algeria (and wrestling with Messali's followers over control of the [[expatriate]] community, in the \"[[Caf\u00e9 Wars]]\" in France), and another, stronger component more resembling a traditional army. These units were based in neighbouring Berber countries (notably in [[Oujda]] in [[Morocco]], and Tunisia), and although they infiltrated forces and ran weapons and supplies across the border, they generally saw less action than the rural guerrilla forces. These units were later to emerge under the leadership of army commander [[Colonel]] [[Houari Boumediene]] as a powerful opposition to the political cadres of the FLN's [[Government in exile|exile government]], the [[Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic|GPRA]], and they eventually came to dominate Algerian politics.\n\n====FLN violence during and after the war for independence====\nThe FLN is considered responsible for over 16,000 Algerian civilians killed and over 13,000 disappeared between 1954 and 1962.<ref>This number is given in the French Wikipedia, [[:fr:Guerre d'Alg\u00e9rie]], \u00a77.1 (Bilan humain) in a reference to: Guy Pervill\u00e9, \"La guerre d'Alg\u00e9rie en face\", ''L'Histoire'', no. 331, May 2008, p. 96.</ref> After the ceasefire of 19 March 1962, the FLN is thought to have massacred between 60,000 and 70,000 [[harki]]s: Muslim Algerians who had served in the French army and whom the French, contrary to promises given, had denied a \"repatriation\" to France.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20081201232906/http://www.cehd.sga.defense.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/cahier24.pdf ''Sorties de guerre'' (''Returning from war'').

An estimated 4,300 people were also killed in France in FLN-related violence.<ref name=savage/>\n\n=== Independence and one-party state ===\nThe war for independence continued until March 1962, when the [[Government of France|French government]] finally signed the [[\u00c9vian Accords]], a [[ceasefire]] agreement with the FLN. In July the same year, the Algerian people approved the cease-fire agreement with France in a [[Algerian independence referendum, 1962|referendum]], supporting economic and social cooperation between the two countries as well. Full independence followed, and the FLN seized control of the country. Political opposition in the form of the MNA and [[Communism|communist]] organizations was outlawed, and Algeria was constituted as a [[one-party state]]. The FLN became its only legal and ruling party.\n\nImmediately after independence, the party experienced a severe internal power struggle. Political leaders coalesced into two grand camps: a [[Politburo|Political Bureau]] formed by the radical [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], who was assisted by the border army, faced off against the political leadership in the former exile government; Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne's army quickly put down resistance and installed Ben Bella as president. The single most powerful political constituency remained the former ALN, which had entered largely unscathed from exile and was now organized as the country's [[Military of Algeria|armed forces]]; added to this were regionally powerful guerrilla irregulars and others who jockeyed for influence in the party. In building his one-party regime, Ben Bella purged remaining dissidents (such as [[Ferhat Abbas]]), but also quickly ran into opposition from Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne as he tried to assert himself independently from the army.\n\nIn 1965, the tension between Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne and Ben Bella culminated in a coup d'\u00e9tat, after Ben Bella had tried to sack one of the Colonel's closest collaborators, Foreign Minister [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] (who was in 1999 elected [[President of Algeria]]). A statist-[[socialist]] and [[Anti-imperialism|anticolonial]] nationalist, Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne ruled through decree and \"revolutionary legitimacy\", marginalizing the FLN in favor of his personal decision-making and the military establishment, even while retaining the one-party system. Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne held tight control over party leadership until his death in 1978, at which time the party reorganized again under the leadership of the military's next candidate, Col. [[Chadli Bendjedid]]. The military remained well represented on the FLN Central Committee and is widely held to have been the real power-broker in the country. During the 1980s the FLN toned down the socialist content of its programme, enacting some [[Free market|free-market]] reforms and purging Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne stalwarts.\n\n=== Multi-party era ===\nIt was not until 1988 that [[1988 October Riots|massive demonstrations and riots]] jolted the country towards major political reform. The riots led to the [[Constitution of Algeria|constitution]] being amended to allow a multi-party system. The first multi-party elections were the [[Algerian local elections, 1990|1990 local elections]], which saw the FLN heavily defeated by the [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (ISF), which won control of over half the local councils; the FLN received just over a quarter of the vote, retaining control of a similar number of councils. [[Algerian legislative election, 1991|Parliamentary elections]] the following year saw the ISF win a landslide victory, taking 188 of the 231 seats, whilst the FLN won only 15, finishing in third place behind the [[Socialist Forces Front]]. However, this was followed shortly afterwards by a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the weakened FLN government, sparking the [[Algerian Civil War]].\n\nAlgeria was under direct military rule for several years, during which the party remained in opposition to the government during the first part of the war, notably in 1995 signing the [[Sant'Egidio platform|Sant'Egidio Platform]], which was highly critical of the military establishment. After internal power struggles and a leadership change, it returned to supporting the presidency. After formal [[democracy]] was restored, the FLN initially failed to regain its prominent position; in the [[Algerian legislative election, 1997|1997 parliamentary elections]] it emerged as the third-largest party, receiving 14% of the vote and winning 69 of the 231 seats. However, it won a landslide victory in the [[Algerian legislative election, 2002|2002 elections]], winning 199 of the 389 seats.\n\nThe party nominated [[Ali Benflis]] as its candidate for the [[Algerian presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential elections]]. He finished as runner-up to the incumbent [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], but received only 6.4% of the vote. In 2005 FLN formed the Presidential Alliance with the [[National Rally for Democracy (Algeria)|National Rally for Democracy]] (RND) and the [[Movement of Society for Peace]] (MSP).\n\nThe [[Algerian legislative election, 2007|2007 parliamentary elections]] saw the FLN reduced to 163 seats, although the FLN's [[Abdelaziz Belkhadem]] remained Prime Minister. Bouteflika was the party's candidate in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential elections]], which he won with 90% of the vote.\n\nIn 2012 MSP left the Presidential Alliance and joined the [[Green Algeria Alliance]]. Despite that, the FLN remained the largest party following the [[Algerian legislative election, 2012|2012 parliamentary elections]], winning 208 of the 462 seats. Bouteflika was re-elected on the FLN ticket in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential elections]] with 82% of the vote. The elderly and ailing Bouteflika is widely seen as a mere frontman for what has often described as a \"shadowy\" group of generals and intelligence officers known to the Algerians collectively as ''le pouvoir'' (\u201cthe power\u201d) and whose individual members are called ''d\u00e9cideurs'' with ''The Economist'' writing in 2012 \"The most powerful man in the land may be Mohamed Medi\u00e8ne, known as Toufiq who has headed military intelligence for two decades\".<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =  \n  | first = \n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Still Waiting for Real Democracy\n  | magazine = The Economist \n  | date= 12 May 2012 | url = http://www.economist.com/node/21554565\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 4 November 2016}}</ref> General [[Mohamed Medi\u00e8ne]], the chief of military intelligence from 1990 to 2015 is known to be a leading  ''d\u00e9cideur'' within ''le pouvior'' and for his secrecy with ''The Economist'' reporting on 21 September 2013: \"Despite his leading role in defeating Islamic militants in a brutal civil war between 1991 and 2000, and his less public role as kingmaker in the ''pouvoir'', General Mediene\u2019s face remains unknown; it is said that anyone who has seen it expires soon after.\"<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =  \n  | first = \n  | coauthors =\n  | title = The dead live longer\n  | magazine = The Economist \n  | date= 21 September 2013| url =https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21586582-change-once-again-hold-dead-live-longer\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\nIn [[Algerian legislative election, 2017|2017 parliamentary elections]] FLN won 164 of the 462 seats, thus losing 44 seats; however, thanks to the good performance of the RND (which won 100 seats), the Presidential Alliance was able to maintain a parliamentary majority and continue to rule the country.\n\n==== Relationship with Jewish Algerians ====\nJews in Algeria were given French citizenship during the colonial era starting in 1870,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/23rd-february-1962/5/the-jews-of-algeria|title=The Jews of Algeria \u00bb 23 Feb 1962 \u00bb The Spectator Archive|work=The Spectator Archive|access-date=2018-04-15}}</ref> while Muslims were denied citizenship by the French. The Jews in Algeria were seen as a go-between for French-Muslim relations; however, the lack of citizenship on behalf of the Muslims created tension between the two groups.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/23rd-february-1962/5/the-jews-of-algeria|title=The Jews of Algeria \u00bb 23 Feb 1962 \u00bb The Spectator Archive|work=The Spectator Archive|access-date=2018-04-15}}</ref> During the Algerian War, Jews felt as if they were being forced to choose sides; they were either Algerian and fighting with the FLN for independence, or they were French and fighting with the French to keep Algeria as a colony. At the start of the Algerian War, the FLN offered Jews the opportunity to join their efforts, and in return Jews would be given Algerian citizenship when Algeria won independence. Most of the Jews in Algeria sided with the French Government, much to the dismay of the FLN and their supporters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/algeria/1956/israelites.htm|title=Appeal of the FLN to Our Israelite Compatriots by FLN Algeria 1956|last=FLN|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2018-04-15}}</ref> During the course of the war, Jews in Algeria began to feel as if the FLN was targeting Jews and not just the French people living in Algeria. This led to increased tensions between Jews and Muslims in the area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dissertationreviews.org/archives/12362|title=Algerian Jews During the French-Algerian War {{!}} Dissertation Reviews|website=dissertationreviews.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-15}}</ref> After the war, Algerian citizenship was only extended to Muslims whose fathers and grandfathers were Muslim at the time the FLN won independence from the French Government.<ref>Algerian Nationality Code, Law no. 63-69 of Mar. 27, 1963, section 34</ref> Algerian Jews were no longer considered Algerian, but they still retained French citizenship. With their French citizenship, the majority of Jews in Algeria decided to emigrate to France, with a small number of Jews deciding to emigrate to Israel and an even smaller number of Jews deciding to stay in Algeria under the rule of the FLN.\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe FLN's [[ideology]] was primarily Algerian nationalist, understood as a movement within a wider [[Arab nationalism]] and also a [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] solidarity. It essentially drew its political self-legitimization from three sources: ''Nationalism'', and the revolutionary war against France; ''Socialism'', loosely interpreted as a popular anti-exploitation creed; ''Islam'', defined as the main foundation for the national consciousness, and a crucial factor in solidifying the Algerian identity as separate from that of French Algerians or [[Pied-Noir|pied-noirs]].\n\nAs the name implies, it viewed itself as a \"front\" composed of different social sectors and ideological trends, even if the concept of a monolithic Algerian polity gradually submerged this vision. A separate party ideology was not well developed at the time of independence, except insofar as it focused on the liberation of Algeria. This latter aspect led to the denial of or refusal to deal with the separate [[Berbers|Berber]] identity held by Berber-speaking Algerians who made up about 50% of Algeria, something which caused fierce opposition and led to the splintering of the movement immediately after independence, as [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed]] set up the [[Berberist]] and pro-democracy [[Socialist Forces Front]] (FFS).\n\n=== Anti-colonialism and Islamism ===\n\n[[Anti-Colonialism]] is widely considered as the core value in Algerian official discourse during its entire contemporary political and social history, especially during the formation of the FLN and later during the [[Islamist movement]].<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p. 27</ref> The Muslim population had been discriminated against at a constitutional level, as illustrated by the fact that French settlers formed up to 80% of the membership in three departmental councils in 1875; and at a local level, the metropolitan model composed of a major and municipal council only granted voting right to 5% of the adult male Muslim population until 1919, when the number increase to 25%.<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p. 33</ref> Therefore, its nationalist outlook was also closely interwoven with anti-Colonialism and anti-imperialism, something which would remain a lasting characteristic of [[Foreign relations of Algeria|Algerian foreign policy]].\n\n[[Islamism]] pertained its dominance in [[Algerian politics]] because of the specific social contexts during different periods. The humiliating failure of the [[Mokrani Revolt]] in 1871 facilitated the pro-Islamism sentiment in the society as people generally regarded Islam as the long-lasting and never-fading symbolic opposition towards the French rule; also the [[Italian invasion of Libya]] in 1911 provoked sympathy in the Muslim community and strengthened the Islamic cultural identity and these two events together consolidated the Islamism-Colonialism opposition rhetoric.<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press.  p. 41</ref>\n\nThe politicization of the Islamism started with the noticeable wave of Islamic discourse led by religious scholars such as Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (1838\u201397), Mohammed Abduh (1849\u20131905) and Rashid Rida (1865\u20131935) that focused on resisting the foreign economic control and establishing an Islamic country based on the sharia, which were the core values of the [[Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema|Algerian Ulama]].<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p. 43</ref> The movement absolutely rejected [[atheism]] and was not overtly [[Secularism|secularist]], contrary to widespread perception in the West, and [[Islamism]] was perhaps the most important mobilizing ideology during the [[Algerian War]]. Still, after independence, the party would in practice assume a strongly modernist interpretation of Islam, supported the social transformation of Algerian society, the emancipation of women, etc., and worked only through secular institutions.\n\nBefore [[Col.]] [[Chadli Bendjedid]] came into power in 1971, the Islamic movement had been rather successfully monitored and subdued by the government during the previous 20 years, but the [[Iranian Revolution]] rekindled the movement and posed a greater threat to the state.<ref name=\"cia.gov\">\"Political Dynamics of Algeria - Welcome to the CIA Web Site.\" Accessed April 22, 2019. https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP84S00927R000200120004-6.pdf.</ref> Since the Algerian independence, Religion had been relegated to the role of legitimizing factor for the party-regime, especially under the presidency of [[Col.]] [[Houari Boum\u00e9di\u00e8nne]] (1965\u201378), but even then Islam was considered the state religion and a crucial part of Algerian identity, as Boum\u00e9di\u00e8nne himself took pride in his [[Quranic]] training. His predecessor [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] (1962\u201365) was more committed to the Islamic component of the regime, although always viewed as more of an Arab nationalist than an Islamic activist (and he remains far removed from what is today referred to as Algeria's Islamists). During the mid- to late-1980s, Bendjedid reintroduced religiously conservative legislation in an attempt to appease growing Islamist opposition. During and after the [[Algerian Civil War]], the party's position has remained that of claiming Algerian Islam as a main influence, while simultaneously arguing that this must be expressed as a progressive and modern faith, even if the party generally keeps in line with the conservative social mores of Algeria's population. It has strongly condemned the radical-[[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] religious teachings of the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS) and other Islamist groups, even while supporting the inclusion of non-violent Islamist parties in the political system and working with them.\n\n=== Socialism ===\n\nA historical reference of socialist values is the implementation of the [[Auguste Warnier|Warnier Law]] of 1873, which allowed the selling of community land at an individual base toppled the economic power of the Algerian indigenous elites; the elimination of class structure undertoned the later FLN populism and socialist agendas.<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p. 34</ref> Such [[egalitarianism]], which implies a liberation struggle, reflects the FLN's militant socialism during Ben Bella's period, who considered the struggle was to invent a new society to release the peasantry's potential.<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p.75</ref>\n\nThis ideological construct of the FLN is controversial and disputed but can be analyzed through lenses of different socio-economic contexts. Given the global background of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and the [[Cold War]], Algeria was considered the entry point into the [[Third World]] in this ideological conflict; the FLN's ideologies under Ben Bella and Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne were largely shaped by the fundamental needs of the country such as radical economic reforms, getting international aids and recognition, along with the domestic Islamic pressure.<ref>Byrne, Jeffrey James. \u201cOur Own Special Brand of Socialism: Algeria and the Contest of Modernities in the 1960s.\u201d Diplomatic History 33, no. 3 (June 2009): 428-32</ref>\n\nFacing the grave economic consequences of the Algerian War of Independence that included the destruction of 8000 villages and millions of acres of land, a centralized authority, in this case, the FLN, was forced to act and redress the problem through a Leninist and corporatist framework.<ref>I\u015f\u0131ksal, H\u00fcseyin. \u201cThe Paradox of Economic Liberalisation and Democratisation Measures in Algeria.\u201d Alternatives\u202f:Turkish Journal Of International Relations (January 7, 2005). p. 207</ref> In response, Ben Bella also experimented the socialist [[Workers' self-management|''autogestion'']] among the Muslim workers who entered industrial and agricultural businesses that featured profit-sharing and equity.<ref>Byrne, Jeffrey James. \u201cOur Own Special Brand of Socialism: Algeria and the Contest of Modernities in the 1960s.\u201d Diplomatic History 33, no. 3 (June 2009): 433</ref> Ben Bella and his supporters in the FLN believed in the harmony between religion and socialism and it was in their political interest to renew the FLN party by leading a popular revolution to integrate Islam and socialism.<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p. 71</ref>\n\nDespite being challenged by the Algerian Ulema and other domestic conservatives who criticized Ben Bella on the shallowness of his intentionally Islamism-leaning policies, the FLN kept its Marxist\u2013Leninist organization principles that featured a secular institutional dominance over religion.<ref>Byrne, Jeffrey James. \u201cOur Own Special Brand of Socialism: Algeria and the Contest of Modernities in the 1960s.\u201d Diplomatic History 33, no. 3 (June 2009): 435</ref> The later FLN's ideological change towards anti-socialism and anti-communism can be illustrated by Kaid Ahmed's opposition towards Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne's leftist agenda, which featured the radical agrarian revolution that hurt rich landowners who defended themselves on the religious ground and fueled the Islamic movement, which gradually took over the national sentiment later in the century.<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p. 91</ref> Starting in 1971 and ending in 1992, the government under Chadli Bendjedid was authoritative but collegial, less rigid on ideologies but more moderate on domestic and international issues, while Bendjedid and his advisers believed in socialism.<ref name=\"cia.gov\"/> In the 21st century, the party began moving away from socialist rhetoric towards more general populism and nationalism.\n\n=== Communism ===\n\nThe organization initially committed itself to [[socialism]], but understood this along the lines of [[Arab socialism]], and opposed orthodox [[Marxism]]. The existence of different [[Social class|classes]] in Algerian society was generally rejected, even if several of the party's top ideologues were influenced to varying degrees by Marxist analysis.\n\nBorrowed Marxist terminology was instead commonly reinterpreted by party radicals in terms of the conflict with France, e.g. casting the colonizer in the role of economic exploiter-oppressor as well as national enemy, while the label of \"[[bourgeoisie]]\" was applied to uncooperative or pro-French elites. The FLN absorbed some [[Communism|communist]] activists into its ranks during the War of Independence for pragmatic reasons but refused to allow them to organize separately from the FLN after the war. The FLN then quickly moved to dissolve the pro-Moscow [[Algerian Communist Party]] (PCA). However, since independent Algeria was set up as a [[One-party state|one-party system]] under the FLN soon thereafter, many communist intellectuals were later co-opted into the regime at various stages. The cooperation occurred during the early Ben Bella and late Boum\u00e9di\u00e8nne years when the [[Socialist Vanguard Party]] (PAGS), established in 1966, cooperated and tactically consulted with the FLN and recognized the FLN as the sole legitimate party in the country.<ref name=\"cia.gov\"/>\n\n=== Contemporary developments ===\n\nDuring all periods of Algerian post-colonial history, except for a few years ca. 1990\u201396, the FLN has been a pillar of the [[politics of Algeria|political system]] and has primarily been viewed as a \"pro-system\" party. Its role as Algeria's liberators has remained the absolute cornerstone of the party's self-perception, and the defining feature of its otherwise somewhat fluid ideology. Today the FLN is close to former [[president of Algeria|president]] [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], who has been made honorary chairman. It mixes its traditional [[populism|populist]] interpretations of Algeria's nationalist-[[revolutionary]] and Islamic heritage with a pro-system [[conservatism]], and support for gradual [[market economy|pro-market]] reform qualified by [[Statism|statist]] reflexes. Since the breakdown of the one-party system and its detachment from the state structure in ca. 1988\u20131990, the FLN has been in favor of [[Multi-party system|multi-party democracy]], whereas it upheld itself as the only organization representing the Algerian people before this period.\n\nThe FLN was admitted into [[Socialist International]] (SI) as a consultative member at the SI's spring congress on 4\u20135 February 2013.<ref>[http://www.socialistinternational.org/images/dynamicImages/files/Council%20decisions-1.pdf Decisions of the Council]Socialist International

It was the principal nationalist movement during the [[Algerian War]] and the sole legal and the ruling political party of the Algerian state until other parties were legalised in 1989.<ref>''Europa World Year Book 2014'', p565</ref> The FLN was established in 1954 from a split in the [[Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties]] from members of the [[Special Organisation (Algeria)|Special Organisation]] paramilitary; its armed wing, the [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)|National Liberation Army]], participated in the Algerian War from 1954 to 1962. After the [[\u00c9vian Accords]] of 1962, the party purged internal dissent and ruled Algeria as a [[one-party state]]. After the [[1988 October Riots]] and the [[Algerian Civil War]] (1991-2002) against Islamist groups, the FLN was reelected to power in the [[2002 Algerian legislative election]], and has generally remained in power ever since, although sometimes needing to form coalitions with other parties.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Colonial era ===\n\nThe background of the FLN can be traced back to the growing anti-colonialism and Algerian nationalist sentiments since the outbreak of [[WWII]]. The repression against the Algerian Muslim population intensified as [[Abdelhamid Ben Badis]] got placed under house arrest and [[Marshal P\u00e9tain]]'s government banned the Algerian Communist Party and [[Algerian People's Party]].<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p. 49</ref> As the war turned gradually more in favor of the Western Allies, given the US's global engagement and its ideological campaign against colonialism, the core sentiment amongst the Algerian nationalists was to use the victory in Europe to promote the independence of the country, which is reflected by the issuing of the Manifesto of the Algerian People by [[Ferhat Abbas]].<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p. 50</ref> As this objective failed to realize, a new party [[Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties]] (MTDL) founded by the just-released [[Messali Hadj]] started to gain momentum and took the lead in the nationalist movement.<ref>Britannica, The Editors of Encyclopaedia. \"Ahmed Messali Hadj.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

(2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p. 53</ref> Consequently, the Algerian nationalists veered to a more military approach as noted in their participation in the [[Special Organisation (Algeria)]], which is a paramilitary component of the MTLD and included the important figures in Algerian politics such [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed]], and [[Mohammed Boudiaf]].\n\nLater in 1951, the capture of Ahmed Ben Bella and the subsequent dismantling of the Special Organisation temporarily subdued the nationalist movement but sparkled the desire inside the Special Organisation militants to form a new organization \u2013 [[Revolutionary Committee of Unity and Action]](CRUA).<ref name=MJ>McDougall, James. A History of Algeria New York: Cambridge University Press, 2017. p. 194</ref> It initially had a five-man leadership consisting of [[Mostefa Ben Boula\u00efd]], [[Larbi Ben M'hidi]], [[Rabah Bitat]], [[Mohamed Boudiaf]] and [[Mourad Didouche]].

[[Abane Ramdane]] was recruited to take control of the FLN's Algiers campaign, and went on to become one of its most effective leaders.<ref name=FT/> By 1956 nearly all the nationalist organizations in Algeria had joined the FLN, which had established itself as the main nationalist group through both co-opting and coercing smaller organizations; the most important group that remained outside the FLN was [[Messali Hadj]]'s [[Algerian National Movement]] (MNA). At this time the FLN reorganized into something like a provisional government, consisting of a five-man executive and legislative body, and was organized territorially into six [[Wilayah|wilayas]], following the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-era administrative boundaries.<ref>S. N. Millar, \"Arab Victory: Lessons from the Algerian War (1954\u201362)\", ''British Army Review'', No. 145, Autumn 2008, p. 49.</ref>\n\nThe FLN's armed wing during the war was called the [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)|National Liberation Army]] (ALN). It was divided into [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] units fighting France and the MNA in Algeria (and wrestling with Messali's followers over control of the [[expatriate]] community, in the \"[[Caf\u00e9 Wars]]\" in France), and another, stronger component more resembling a traditional army. These units were based in neighbouring Berber countries (notably in [[Oujda]] in [[Morocco]], and Tunisia), and although they infiltrated forces and ran weapons and supplies across the border, they generally saw less action than the rural guerrilla forces. These units were later to emerge under the leadership of army commander [[Colonel]] [[Houari Boumediene]] as a powerful opposition to the political cadres of the FLN's [[Government in exile|exile government]], the [[Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic|GPRA]], and they eventually came to dominate Algerian politics.\n\n====FLN violence during and after the war for independence====\nThe FLN is considered responsible for over 16,000 Algerian civilians killed and over 13,000 disappeared between 1954 and 1962.<ref>This number is given in the French Wikipedia, [[:fr:Guerre d'Alg\u00e9rie]], \u00a77.1 (Bilan humain) in a reference to: Guy Pervill\u00e9, \"La guerre d'Alg\u00e9rie en face\", ''L'Histoire'', no. 331, May 2008, p. 96.</ref> After the ceasefire of 19 March 1962, the FLN is thought to have massacred between 60,000 and 70,000 [[harki]]s: Muslim Algerians who had served in the French army and whom the French, contrary to promises given, had denied a \"repatriation\" to France.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20081201232906/http://www.cehd.sga.defense.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/cahier24.pdf ''Sorties de guerre'' (''Returning from war'').

An estimated 4,300 people were also killed in France in FLN-related violence.<ref name=savage/>\n\n=== Independence and one-party state ===\nThe war for independence continued until March 1962, when the [[Government of France|French government]] finally signed the [[\u00c9vian Accords]], a [[ceasefire]] agreement with the FLN. In July the same year, the Algerian people approved the cease-fire agreement with France in a [[Algerian independence referendum, 1962|referendum]], supporting economic and social cooperation between the two countries as well. Full independence followed, and the FLN seized control of the country. Political opposition in the form of the MNA and [[Communism|communist]] organizations was outlawed, and Algeria was constituted as a [[one-party state]]. The FLN became its only legal and ruling party.\n\nImmediately after independence, the party experienced a severe internal power struggle. Political leaders coalesced into two grand camps: a [[Politburo|Political Bureau]] formed by the radical [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], who was assisted by the border army, faced off against the political leadership in the former exile government; Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne's army quickly put down resistance and installed Ben Bella as president. The single most powerful political constituency remained the former ALN, which had entered largely unscathed from exile and was now organized as the country's [[Military of Algeria|armed forces]]; added to this were regionally powerful guerrilla irregulars and others who jockeyed for influence in the party. In building his one-party regime, Ben Bella purged remaining dissidents (such as [[Ferhat Abbas]]), but also quickly ran into opposition from Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne as he tried to assert himself independently from the army.\n\nIn 1965, the tension between Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne and Ben Bella culminated in a coup d'\u00e9tat, after Ben Bella had tried to sack one of the Colonel's closest collaborators, Foreign Minister [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] (who was in 1999 elected [[President of Algeria]]). A statist-[[socialist]] and [[Anti-imperialism|anticolonial]] nationalist, Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne ruled through decree and \"revolutionary legitimacy\", marginalizing the FLN in favor of his personal decision-making and the military establishment, even while retaining the one-party system. Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne held tight control over party leadership until his death in 1978, at which time the party reorganized again under the leadership of the military's next candidate, Col. [[Chadli Bendjedid]]. The military remained well represented on the FLN Central Committee and is widely held to have been the real power-broker in the country. During the 1980s the FLN toned down the socialist content of its programme, enacting some [[Free market|free-market]] reforms and purging Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne stalwarts.\n\n=== Multi-party era ===\nIt was not until 1988 that [[1988 October Riots|massive demonstrations and riots]] jolted the country towards major political reform. The riots led to the [[Constitution of Algeria|constitution]] being amended to allow a multi-party system. The first multi-party elections were the [[Algerian local elections, 1990|1990 local elections]], which saw the FLN heavily defeated by the [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (ISF), which won control of over half the local councils; the FLN received just over a quarter of the vote, retaining control of a similar number of councils. [[Algerian legislative election, 1991|Parliamentary elections]] the following year saw the ISF win a landslide victory, taking 188 of the 231 seats, whilst the FLN won only 15, finishing in third place behind the [[Socialist Forces Front]]. However, this was followed shortly afterwards by a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the weakened FLN government, sparking the [[Algerian Civil War]].\n\nAlgeria was under direct military rule for several years, during which the party remained in opposition to the government during the first part of the war, notably in 1995 signing the [[Sant'Egidio platform|Sant'Egidio Platform]], which was highly critical of the military establishment. After internal power struggles and a leadership change, it returned to supporting the presidency. After formal [[democracy]] was restored, the FLN initially failed to regain its prominent position; in the [[Algerian legislative election, 1997|1997 parliamentary elections]] it emerged as the third-largest party, receiving 14% of the vote and winning 69 of the 231 seats. However, it won a landslide victory in the [[Algerian legislative election, 2002|2002 elections]], winning 199 of the 389 seats.\n\nThe party nominated [[Ali Benflis]] as its candidate for the [[Algerian presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential elections]]. He finished as runner-up to the incumbent [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], but received only 6.4% of the vote. In 2005 FLN formed the Presidential Alliance with the [[National Rally for Democracy (Algeria)|National Rally for Democracy]] (RND) and the [[Movement of Society for Peace]] (MSP).\n\nThe [[Algerian legislative election, 2007|2007 parliamentary elections]] saw the FLN reduced to 163 seats, although the FLN's [[Abdelaziz Belkhadem]] remained Prime Minister. Bouteflika was the party's candidate in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential elections]], which he won with 90% of the vote.\n\nIn 2012 MSP left the Presidential Alliance and joined the [[Green Algeria Alliance]]. Despite that, the FLN remained the largest party following the [[Algerian legislative election, 2012|2012 parliamentary elections]], winning 208 of the 462 seats. Bouteflika was re-elected on the FLN ticket in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential elections]] with 82% of the vote. The elderly and ailing Bouteflika is widely seen as a mere frontman for what has often described as a \"shadowy\" group of generals and intelligence officers known to the Algerians collectively as ''le pouvoir'' (\u201cthe power\u201d) and whose individual members are called ''d\u00e9cideurs'' with ''The Economist'' writing in 2012 \"The most powerful man in the land may be Mohamed Medi\u00e8ne, known as Toufiq who has headed military intelligence for two decades\".<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =  \n  | first = \n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Still Waiting for Real Democracy\n  | magazine = The Economist \n  | date= 12 May 2012 | url = http://www.economist.com/node/21554565\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 4 November 2016}}</ref> General [[Mohamed Medi\u00e8ne]], the chief of military intelligence from 1990 to 2015 is known to be a leading  ''d\u00e9cideur'' within ''le pouvior'' and for his secrecy with ''The Economist'' reporting on 21 September 2013: \"Despite his leading role in defeating Islamic militants in a brutal civil war between 1991 and 2000, and his less public role as kingmaker in the ''pouvoir'', General Mediene\u2019s face remains unknown; it is said that anyone who has seen it expires soon after.\"<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =  \n  | first = \n  | coauthors =\n  | title = The dead live longer\n  | magazine = The Economist \n  | date= 21 September 2013| url =https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21586582-change-once-again-hold-dead-live-longer\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\nIn [[Algerian legislative election, 2017|2017 parliamentary elections]] FLN won 164 of the 462 seats, thus losing 44 seats; however, thanks to the good performance of the RND (which won 100 seats), the Presidential Alliance was able to maintain a parliamentary majority and continue to rule the country.\n\n==== Relationship with Jewish Algerians ====\nJews in Algeria were given French citizenship during the colonial era starting in 1870,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/23rd-february-1962/5/the-jews-of-algeria|title=The Jews of Algeria \u00bb 23 Feb 1962 \u00bb The Spectator Archive|work=The Spectator Archive|access-date=2018-04-15}}</ref> while Muslims were denied citizenship by the French.

At the start of the Algerian War, the FLN offered Jews the opportunity to join their efforts, and in return Jews would be given Algerian citizenship when Algeria won independence. Most of the Jews in Algeria sided with the French Government, much to the dismay of the FLN and their supporters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/algeria/1956/israelites.htm|title=Appeal of the FLN to Our Israelite Compatriots by FLN Algeria 1956|last=FLN|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2018-04-15}}</ref> During the course of the war, Jews in Algeria began to feel as if the FLN was targeting Jews and not just the French people living in Algeria. This led to increased tensions between Jews and Muslims in the area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dissertationreviews.org/archives/12362|title=Algerian Jews During the French-Algerian War {{!}} Dissertation Reviews|website=dissertationreviews.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-15}}</ref> After the war, Algerian citizenship was only extended to Muslims whose fathers and grandfathers were Muslim at the time the FLN won independence from the French Government.<ref>Algerian Nationality Code, Law no. 63-69 of Mar. 27, 1963, section 34</ref> Algerian Jews were no longer considered Algerian, but they still retained French citizenship. With their French citizenship, the majority of Jews in Algeria decided to emigrate to France, with a small number of Jews deciding to emigrate to Israel and an even smaller number of Jews deciding to stay in Algeria under the rule of the FLN.\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe FLN's [[ideology]] was primarily Algerian nationalist, understood as a movement within a wider [[Arab nationalism]] and also a [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] solidarity. It essentially drew its political self-legitimization from three sources: ''Nationalism'', and the revolutionary war against France; ''Socialism'', loosely interpreted as a popular anti-exploitation creed; ''Islam'', defined as the main foundation for the national consciousness, and a crucial factor in solidifying the Algerian identity as separate from that of French Algerians or [[Pied-Noir|pied-noirs]].\n\nAs the name implies, it viewed itself as a \"front\" composed of different social sectors and ideological trends, even if the concept of a monolithic Algerian polity gradually submerged this vision. A separate party ideology was not well developed at the time of independence, except insofar as it focused on the liberation of Algeria. This latter aspect led to the denial of or refusal to deal with the separate [[Berbers|Berber]] identity held by Berber-speaking Algerians who made up about 50% of Algeria, something which caused fierce opposition and led to the splintering of the movement immediately after independence, as [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed]] set up the [[Berberist]] and pro-democracy [[Socialist Forces Front]] (FFS).\n\n=== Anti-colonialism and Islamism ===\n\n[[Anti-Colonialism]] is widely considered as the core value in Algerian official discourse during its entire contemporary political and social history, especially during the formation of the FLN and later during the [[Islamist movement]].<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p. 27</ref> The Muslim population had been discriminated against at a constitutional level, as illustrated by the fact that French settlers formed up to 80% of the membership in three departmental councils in 1875; and at a local level, the metropolitan model composed of a major and municipal council only granted voting right to 5% of the adult male Muslim population until 1919, when the number increase to 25%.<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p. 33</ref> Therefore, its nationalist outlook was also closely interwoven with anti-Colonialism and anti-imperialism, something which would remain a lasting characteristic of [[Foreign relations of Algeria|Algerian foreign policy]].\n\n[[Islamism]] pertained its dominance in [[Algerian politics]] because of the specific social contexts during different periods. The humiliating failure of the [[Mokrani Revolt]] in 1871 facilitated the pro-Islamism sentiment in the society as people generally regarded Islam as the long-lasting and never-fading symbolic opposition towards the French rule; also the [[Italian invasion of Libya]] in 1911 provoked sympathy in the Muslim community and strengthened the Islamic cultural identity and these two events together consolidated the Islamism-Colonialism opposition rhetoric.<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press.  p. 41</ref>\n\nThe politicization of the Islamism started with the noticeable wave of Islamic discourse led by religious scholars such as Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (1838\u201397), Mohammed Abduh (1849\u20131905) and Rashid Rida (1865\u20131935) that focused on resisting the foreign economic control and establishing an Islamic country based on the sharia, which were the core values of the [[Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema|Algerian Ulama]].<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p. 43</ref> The movement absolutely rejected [[atheism]] and was not overtly [[Secularism|secularist]], contrary to widespread perception in the West, and [[Islamism]] was perhaps the most important mobilizing ideology during the [[Algerian War]]. Still, after independence, the party would in practice assume a strongly modernist interpretation of Islam, supported the social transformation of Algerian society, the emancipation of women, etc., and worked only through secular institutions.\n\nBefore [[Col.]] [[Chadli Bendjedid]] came into power in 1971, the Islamic movement had been rather successfully monitored and subdued by the government during the previous 20 years, but the [[Iranian Revolution]] rekindled the movement and posed a greater threat to the state.<ref name=\"cia.gov\">\"Political Dynamics of Algeria - Welcome to the CIA Web Site.\" Accessed April 22, 2019. https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP84S00927R000200120004-6.pdf.</ref> Since the Algerian independence, Religion had been relegated to the role of legitimizing factor for the party-regime, especially under the presidency of [[Col.]] [[Houari Boum\u00e9di\u00e8nne]] (1965\u201378), but even then Islam was considered the state religion and a crucial part of Algerian identity, as Boum\u00e9di\u00e8nne himself took pride in his [[Quranic]] training. His predecessor [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] (1962\u201365) was more committed to the Islamic component of the regime, although always viewed as more of an Arab nationalist than an Islamic activist (and he remains far removed from what is today referred to as Algeria's Islamists). During the mid- to late-1980s, Bendjedid reintroduced religiously conservative legislation in an attempt to appease growing Islamist opposition. During and after the [[Algerian Civil War]], the party's position has remained that of claiming Algerian Islam as a main influence, while simultaneously arguing that this must be expressed as a progressive and modern faith, even if the party generally keeps in line with the conservative social mores of Algeria's population. It has strongly condemned the radical-[[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] religious teachings of the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS) and other Islamist groups, even while supporting the inclusion of non-violent Islamist parties in the political system and working with them.\n\n=== Socialism ===\n\nA historical reference of socialist values is the implementation of the [[Auguste Warnier|Warnier Law]] of 1873, which allowed the selling of community land at an individual base toppled the economic power of the Algerian indigenous elites; the elimination of class structure undertoned the later FLN populism and socialist agendas.<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p. 34</ref> Such [[egalitarianism]], which implies a liberation struggle, reflects the FLN's militant socialism during Ben Bella's period, who considered the struggle was to invent a new society to release the peasantry's potential.<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p.75</ref>\n\nThis ideological construct of the FLN is controversial and disputed but can be analyzed through lenses of different socio-economic contexts. Given the global background of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and the [[Cold War]], Algeria was considered the entry point into the [[Third World]] in this ideological conflict; the FLN's ideologies under Ben Bella and Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne were largely shaped by the fundamental needs of the country such as radical economic reforms, getting international aids and recognition, along with the domestic Islamic pressure.<ref>Byrne, Jeffrey James. \u201cOur Own Special Brand of Socialism: Algeria and the Contest of Modernities in the 1960s.\u201d Diplomatic History 33, no. 3 (June 2009): 428-32</ref>\n\nFacing the grave economic consequences of the Algerian War of Independence that included the destruction of 8000 villages and millions of acres of land, a centralized authority, in this case, the FLN, was forced to act and redress the problem through a Leninist and corporatist framework.<ref>I\u015f\u0131ksal, H\u00fcseyin. \u201cThe Paradox of Economic Liberalisation and Democratisation Measures in Algeria.\u201d Alternatives\u202f:Turkish Journal Of International Relations (January 7, 2005). p. 207</ref> In response, Ben Bella also experimented the socialist [[Workers' self-management|''autogestion'']] among the Muslim workers who entered industrial and agricultural businesses that featured profit-sharing and equity.<ref>Byrne, Jeffrey James. \u201cOur Own Special Brand of Socialism: Algeria and the Contest of Modernities in the 1960s.\u201d Diplomatic History 33, no. 3 (June 2009): 433</ref> Ben Bella and his supporters in the FLN believed in the harmony between religion and socialism and it was in their political interest to renew the FLN party by leading a popular revolution to integrate Islam and socialism.<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p. 71</ref>\n\nDespite being challenged by the Algerian Ulema and other domestic conservatives who criticized Ben Bella on the shallowness of his intentionally Islamism-leaning policies, the FLN kept its Marxist\u2013Leninist organization principles that featured a secular institutional dominance over religion.<ref>Byrne, Jeffrey James. \u201cOur Own Special Brand of Socialism: Algeria and the Contest of Modernities in the 1960s.\u201d Diplomatic History 33, no. 3 (June 2009): 435</ref> The later FLN's ideological change towards anti-socialism and anti-communism can be illustrated by Kaid Ahmed's opposition towards Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne's leftist agenda, which featured the radical agrarian revolution that hurt rich landowners who defended themselves on the religious ground and fueled the Islamic movement, which gradually took over the national sentiment later in the century.<ref>Evans, M. (2007). Algeria\u202f: Anger of the Dispossessed. London: Yale University Press. p. 91</ref> Starting in 1971 and ending in 1992, the government under Chadli Bendjedid was authoritative but collegial, less rigid on ideologies but more moderate on domestic and international issues, while Bendjedid and his advisers believed in socialism.<ref name=\"cia.gov\"/> In the 21st century, the party began moving away from socialist rhetoric towards more general populism and nationalism.\n\n=== Communism ===\n\nThe organization initially committed itself to [[socialism]], but understood this along the lines of [[Arab socialism]], and opposed orthodox [[Marxism]]. The existence of different [[Social class|classes]] in Algerian society was generally rejected, even if several of the party's top ideologues were influenced to varying degrees by Marxist analysis.\n\nBorrowed Marxist terminology was instead commonly reinterpreted by party radicals in terms of the conflict with France, e.g. casting the colonizer in the role of economic exploiter-oppressor as well as national enemy, while the label of \"[[bourgeoisie]]\" was applied to uncooperative or pro-French elites. The FLN absorbed some [[Communism|communist]] activists into its ranks during the War of Independence for pragmatic reasons but refused to allow them to organize separately from the FLN after the war. The FLN then quickly moved to dissolve the pro-Moscow [[Algerian Communist Party]] (PCA). However, since independent Algeria was set up as a [[One-party state|one-party system]] under the FLN soon thereafter, many communist intellectuals were later co-opted into the regime at various stages. The cooperation occurred during the early Ben Bella and late Boum\u00e9di\u00e8nne years when the [[Socialist Vanguard Party]] (PAGS), established in 1966, cooperated and tactically consulted with the FLN and recognized the FLN as the sole legitimate party in the country.<ref name=\"cia.gov\"/>\n\n=== Contemporary developments ===\n\nDuring all periods of Algerian post-colonial history, except for a few years ca. 1990\u201396, the FLN has been a pillar of the [[politics of Algeria|political system]] and has primarily been viewed as a \"pro-system\" party. Its role as Algeria's liberators has remained the absolute cornerstone of the party's self-perception, and the defining feature of its otherwise somewhat fluid ideology. Today the FLN is close to former [[president of Algeria|president]] [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], who has been made honorary chairman. It mixes its traditional [[populism|populist]] interpretations of Algeria's nationalist-[[revolutionary]] and Islamic heritage with a pro-system [[conservatism]], and support for gradual [[market economy|pro-market]] reform qualified by [[Statism|statist]] reflexes. Since the breakdown of the one-party system and its detachment from the state structure in ca. 1988\u20131990, the FLN has been in favor of [[Multi-party system|multi-party democracy]], whereas it upheld itself as the only organization representing the Algerian people before this period.\n\nThe FLN was admitted into [[Socialist International]] (SI) as a consultative member at the SI's spring congress on 4\u20135 February 2013.<ref>[http://www.socialistinternational.org/images/dynamicImages/files/Council%20decisions-1.pdf Decisions of the Council]Socialist International

Some species also have light receptors in their tail.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wLiVDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA60&dq=%22scorpions+perceive+the+environment+through+visual,+tactile+and+chemical%22&hl=no&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjy4KzW4IHSAhUEAsAKHVEAAd4Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22scorpions%20perceive%20the%20environment%20through%20visual%2C%20tactile%20and%20chemical%22&f=false Arthropod Diversity and Conservation in the Tropics and Sub-tropics]</ref> The position of the eyes on the cephalothorax depends in part on the hardness or softness of the soil upon which they spend their lives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://insects.tamu.edu/extension/bulletins/l-1678.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990822042321/http://insects.tamu.edu/extension/bulletins/l-1678.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=1999-08-22 |title=Department of Entomology |publisher=[[Texas A&M University]] |accessdate=2012-05-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe pedipalp is a segmented, chelate (clawed) [[appendage]] used for prey immobilization, defense and sensory purposes.

The fifth segment of the metasoma is the caudal segment of the opisthosoma, and accordingly bears the anus. The scorpion's telson is the part commonly called the stinger; it is attached to the end of the fifth segment just [[Anatomical terms of location#Other directional terms|dorsad]] from the anus, but as the distal end of the tail at rest normally is carried upside down with the sting pointing forward, the anus usually is above the base of the telson and facing upwards.<ref name=\"Polis1990\">{{cite book|author=Gary A.

The large pincers are studded with highly sensitive tactile hair, and the moment an insect touches these, they use their chelae (pincers) to catch the prey. Depending on the toxicity of their venom and size of their claws, they will then either crush the prey or inject it with [[neurotoxic]] venom. This will kill or paralyze the prey so the scorpion can eat it. Scorpions have an unusual style of eating using [[chelicerae]], small clawlike structures that protrude from the mouth that are unique to the [[Chelicerata]] among arthropods. The chelicerae, which are very sharp, are used to pull small amounts of food off the prey item for digestion into a ''pre-oral cavity'' below the chelicerae and carapace. Scorpions can ingest food only in a liquid form; they have external digestion. The digestive juices from the gut are egested onto the food and the digested food sucked in liquid form. Any solid indigestible matter (fur, [[exoskeleton]], etc.) is trapped by setae in the pre-oral cavity and ejected by the scorpion.<ref name=\"Biology\"/>{{rp|296\u2013297}}\n\nScorpions can consume huge amounts of food at one sitting. They have a very efficient food storage organ and a very low metabolic rate combined with a relatively inactive lifestyle. This enables scorpions to survive long periods when deprived of food. Some are able to survive 6 to 12 months of starvation.<ref name=\"Biology\"/>{{rp|297\u2013298}} Scorpions excrete very little. Their waste consists mostly of insoluble nitrogenous compounds, such as [[xanthine]], [[guanine]] and [[uric acid]].<ref name=\"Earthlife\"/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nMost scorpions reproduce sexually, and most species have male and female individuals; however, some species, such as ''[[Hottentotta hottentotta]]'', ''[[Hottentotta caboverdensis]]'', ''[[Liocheles australasiae]]'', ''[[Tityus columbianus]]'', ''[[Tityus metuendus]]'', ''[[Tityus serrulatus]]'', ''[[Tityus stigmurus]]'', ''[[Tityus trivittatus]]'' and ''[[Tityus urugayensis]]'', reproduce through [[parthenogenesis]], a process in which unfertilized eggs develop into living [[embryo]]s. Parthenogenic reproduction starts following the scorpion's final molt to maturity and continues thereafter.\n\n[[File:Pregnant scorpion.jpg|thumb|Pregnant scorpion]]\nSexual reproduction is accomplished by the transfer of a [[spermatophore]] from the male to the female. Scorpions possess a complex [[courtship]] and [[mating]] ritual to effect this transfer. Mating starts with the male and female locating and identifying each other using a mixture of [[pheromone]]s and [[oscillation|vibrational]] communication. Once they have satisfied the other that they are of opposite sex and of the correct species, mating can commence.\n\nThe courtship starts with the male grasping the female's pedipalps with his own. The pair then perform a \"dance\" called the \"''promenade \u00e0 deux''\". In this \"dance,\" the male leads the female around searching for a suitable place to deposit his [[spermatophore]]. The courtship ritual can involve several other behaviors such as juddering and a cheliceral kiss, in which the male's [[chelicerae]] \u2013 pincers \u2013 grasp the female's in a smaller, more intimate version of the male's grasping the female's pedipalps, and in some cases injecting a small amount of his venom into her pedipalp or on the edge of her cephalothorax,<ref>{{cite book |author1=Cleveland P.

This allows the spermatophore to enter her genital [[operculum (animal)|opercula]], which triggers release of the sperm, thus fertilizing the female. The mating process can take from 1 to 25+ hours, and depends on the ability of the male to find a suitable place to deposit his spermatophore. If mating continues too long, the female may lose interest, ending the process.\n\nOnce the mating is complete, the male will generally retreat quickly, for unknown reasons; [[sexual cannibalism]] is infrequent with scorpions.\n\n===Birth and development===\n[[File:scorpionwithyoung.JPG|right|thumb|''[[Compsobuthus werneri]]'' female with [[Offspring|young]]]]\nUnlike the majority of species in the class [[Arachnid]]a, which are [[oviparous]], scorpions seem to be universally [[viviparous]].<ref name=\"Warburg\">{{cite journal |last1=Warburg |first1=M.

Especially in species that display more advanced sociability (e.g. ''[[Pandinus]]'' spp.), the young/mother association can continue for an extended period of time. The size of the litter depends on the species and environmental factors, and can range from 2 to more than 100 scorplings.

Growth is accomplished by periodic shedding of the exoskeleton ([[ecdysis]]). A scorpion's developmental progress is measured in [[instar]]s (how many molts it has undergone). Scorpions typically require between five and seven molts to reach maturity. Molting commences with a split in the old [[exoskeleton]] just below the edge of the carapace (at the front of the prosoma). The scorpion then emerges from this split. The pedipalps and legs are first removed from the old exoskeleton, followed eventually by the [[metasoma]]. When it emerges, the scorpion's new [[exoskeleton]] is soft, making the scorpion highly vulnerable to attack. The scorpion must constantly stretch while the new exoskeleton hardens to ensure that it can move when the hardening is complete. The process of hardening is called sclerotisation. The new exoskeleton does not fluoresce. As sclerotisation occurs, the fluorescence gradually returns.\n\n{{anchor|In culture}}\n\n==Relationship with humans==\n[[File:USMC-110528-M-EV637-041.jpg|thumb|An Indonesian Marine demonstrates how to neutralize scorpions and use them to survive]]\nAlthough scorpions are usually not found in large numbers in densely populated urban areas, they do regularly occur in and near human habitation in all tropical parts of the world.

The large pincers are studded with highly sensitive tactile hair, and the moment an insect touches these, they use their chelae (pincers) to catch the prey. Depending on the toxicity of their venom and size of their claws, they will then either crush the prey or inject it with [[neurotoxic]] venom. This will kill or paralyze the prey so the scorpion can eat it. Scorpions have an unusual style of eating using [[chelicerae]], small clawlike structures that protrude from the mouth that are unique to the [[Chelicerata]] among arthropods. The chelicerae, which are very sharp, are used to pull small amounts of food off the prey item for digestion into a ''pre-oral cavity'' below the chelicerae and carapace. Scorpions can ingest food only in a liquid form; they have external digestion. The digestive juices from the gut are egested onto the food and the digested food sucked in liquid form. Any solid indigestible matter (fur, [[exoskeleton]], etc.) is trapped by setae in the pre-oral cavity and ejected by the scorpion.<ref name=\"Biology\"/>{{rp|296\u2013297}}\n\nScorpions can consume huge amounts of food at one sitting. They have a very efficient food storage organ and a very low metabolic rate combined with a relatively inactive lifestyle. This enables scorpions to survive long periods when deprived of food. Some are able to survive 6 to 12 months of starvation.<ref name=\"Biology\"/>{{rp|297\u2013298}} Scorpions excrete very little. Their waste consists mostly of insoluble nitrogenous compounds, such as [[xanthine]], [[guanine]] and [[uric acid]].<ref name=\"Earthlife\"/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nMost scorpions reproduce sexually, and most species have male and female individuals; however, some species, such as ''[[Hottentotta hottentotta]]'', ''[[Hottentotta caboverdensis]]'', ''[[Liocheles australasiae]]'', ''[[Tityus columbianus]]'', ''[[Tityus metuendus]]'', ''[[Tityus serrulatus]]'', ''[[Tityus stigmurus]]'', ''[[Tityus trivittatus]]'' and ''[[Tityus urugayensis]]'', reproduce through [[parthenogenesis]], a process in which unfertilized eggs develop into living [[embryo]]s. Parthenogenic reproduction starts following the scorpion's final molt to maturity and continues thereafter.\n\n[[File:Pregnant scorpion.jpg|thumb|Pregnant scorpion]]\nSexual reproduction is accomplished by the transfer of a [[spermatophore]] from the male to the female. Scorpions possess a complex [[courtship]] and [[mating]] ritual to effect this transfer. Mating starts with the male and female locating and identifying each other using a mixture of [[pheromone]]s and [[oscillation|vibrational]] communication. Once they have satisfied the other that they are of opposite sex and of the correct species, mating can commence.\n\nThe courtship starts with the male grasping the female's pedipalps with his own. The pair then perform a \"dance\" called the \"''promenade \u00e0 deux''\". In this \"dance,\" the male leads the female around searching for a suitable place to deposit his [[spermatophore]]. The courtship ritual can involve several other behaviors such as juddering and a cheliceral kiss, in which the male's [[chelicerae]] \u2013 pincers \u2013 grasp the female's in a smaller, more intimate version of the male's grasping the female's pedipalps, and in some cases injecting a small amount of his venom into her pedipalp or on the edge of her cephalothorax,<ref>{{cite book |author1=Cleveland P.

This allows the spermatophore to enter her genital [[operculum (animal)|opercula]], which triggers release of the sperm, thus fertilizing the female. The mating process can take from 1 to 25+ hours, and depends on the ability of the male to find a suitable place to deposit his spermatophore. If mating continues too long, the female may lose interest, ending the process.\n\nOnce the mating is complete, the male will generally retreat quickly, for unknown reasons; [[sexual cannibalism]] is infrequent with scorpions.\n\n===Birth and development===\n[[File:scorpionwithyoung.JPG|right|thumb|''[[Compsobuthus werneri]]'' female with [[Offspring|young]]]]\nUnlike the majority of species in the class [[Arachnid]]a, which are [[oviparous]], scorpions seem to be universally [[viviparous]].<ref name=\"Warburg\">{{cite journal |last1=Warburg |first1=M.

Especially in species that display more advanced sociability (e.g. ''[[Pandinus]]'' spp.), the young/mother association can continue for an extended period of time.

Growth is accomplished by periodic shedding of the exoskeleton ([[ecdysis]]). A scorpion's developmental progress is measured in [[instar]]s (how many molts it has undergone). Scorpions typically require between five and seven molts to reach maturity. Molting commences with a split in the old [[exoskeleton]] just below the edge of the carapace (at the front of the prosoma). The scorpion then emerges from this split. The pedipalps and legs are first removed from the old exoskeleton, followed eventually by the [[metasoma]]. When it emerges, the scorpion's new [[exoskeleton]] is soft, making the scorpion highly vulnerable to attack. The scorpion must constantly stretch while the new exoskeleton hardens to ensure that it can move when the hardening is complete. The process of hardening is called sclerotisation. The new exoskeleton does not fluoresce. As sclerotisation occurs, the fluorescence gradually returns.\n\n{{anchor|In culture}}\n\n==Relationship with humans==\n[[File:USMC-110528-M-EV637-041.jpg|thumb|An Indonesian Marine demonstrates how to neutralize scorpions and use them to survive]]\nAlthough scorpions are usually not found in large numbers in densely populated urban areas, they do regularly occur in and near human habitation in all tropical parts of the world.

Each compound is made and stored in a pair of glandular sacs and is released in a quantity regulated by the scorpion itself. Of the more than one thousand known species of scorpions, only 25 have venom that is deadly to humans; most of those belong to the family [[Buthidae]] (including ''[[Leiurus quinquestriatus]]'', ''[[Hottentotta]]'' spp., ''[[Centruroides]]'' spp., and ''[[Androctonus]]'' spp.).<ref name=\"Earthlife\"/><ref>{{cite web|title = Poisonous Animals: Scorpions| url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C007974/2_4sco.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403212450/http://library.thinkquest.org/C007974/2_4sco.htm | archivedate=2005-04-03 |publisher=ThinkQuest |year=2000 |access-date =December 16, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==== Prevention ====\nAccording to the United States [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], these steps should be taken to prevent scorpion stings:<ref name=\"niosh\">{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/insects/scorpions.html | title=Insects and scorpions | publisher=[[NIOSH]] | date=1 July 2016 | accessdate=15 July 2016}} \u2013 ''text copied from this public-domain source: public domain, PD-USGov''</ref>\n* Wear long sleeves and trousers.\n* Wear leather gloves.\n* Shake out clothing, bedding, bathroom towels, or shoes before using them.\n* Workers with a history of severe allergic reactions to insect bites or stings should consider carrying an epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen) and should wear a medical identification bracelet or necklace stating their [[allergy]].\n\n====Treatment====\n[[First aid]] for scorpion stings is generally [[Symptomatic treatment|symptomatic]].

A \"song unit\" is determined by an algorithm that weights a digital song sale as 1 and respectively values 120 subscription-based streams and 360 ad-supported streams as a song-equivalent unit. With regard to [[album-equivalent unit]]s, a song is generally considered to be part of the first album in which it was included, with the exception of the first four weeks in which a song experiences a surge in consumption because of inclusion on a compilation or greatest hits album. For charts were streaming is the only metric for chart positioning, the type of stream is disregarded and weighted equivalent to each other.<ref name=\"GeneralMethodology\"/>\n\nAn album must be sold for at least $3.75 for that sale to be logged for a given tracking week; units sold for less than the minimum price requirement in the first month of release will not be considered for weekly charts, but would be reflected in its lifetime sales.

An album edition is considered \"deluxe\" if the bonus content does not exceed the duration of the standard edition, in which case the standard and deluxe editions would chart as a single album. An album edition is considered \"super deluxe\" if the bonus content exceeds the duration of the standard edition, in which case the super deluxe edition would chart as a separate album from the standard and deluxe versions.

{"title_page": "Maria Hertogh riots", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}\n\n{{History of Singapore}}\nThe '''Maria Hertogh riots''' began on 13 December 1950 in [[Post-war Singapore|Singapore]] after a court decided that a child who had been raised by [[Muslims]] should be returned to her [[Catholic]] biological parents. A protest by outraged Muslims escalated into a riot when images were published showing 13-year-old Maria Hertogh (or Bertha Hertogh) kneeling before a statue of the [[Virgin Mary]]. Riots in Singapore lasted until noon on 13 December 1950. Eighteen people were killed and 173 injured. Many properties were also damaged.\n\nHertogh (also known as ''Nadra'') had been in the care of Che Aminah binte Mohamed before being returned to her [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Dutch Catholic]] biological parents.\n\n==Maria Hertogh==\n\n===Early life===\nMaria Hertogh was born on 24 March 1937 to a [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Dutch Catholic]] family living in [[Cimahi]], near [[Bandung]], [[Java (island)|Java]], then a part of the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]). Her father, Adrianus Petrus Hertogh, came to Java in the 1920s as a [[sergeant]] in the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]]. In the early 1930s, he married Adeline Hunter, a [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] of [[Scottish people|Scottish]]-[[Javanese people|Javanese]] descent brought up in Java. Maria was [[baptism|baptised]] in the Roman Catholic Church of Saint Ignatius at Tjimahi on 10 April by a [[Catholic priest]].\n\nWhen [[World War II]] broke out, Adrianus Hertogh, as a sergeant in the [[Dutch Army]], was captured by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and sent to a [[POW]] camp in Japan, where he was kept until 1945. Meanwhile, Adeline Hertogh stayed with her mother, Nor Louise, and her five children, among whom Maria was the third and youngest daughter. On 29 December 1942, Mrs. Hertogh gave birth to her sixth child, a boy. Three days later, Maria went to stay with Aminah binte Mohammad, a 42-year-old Malay woman from [[Kemaman]], Terengganu, Malaya (now [[Malaysia]]) and a close friend of Nor Louise.\n\n====Adeline Hertogh's version====\nAccording to Maria's biological mother, Adeline Hertogh, in testimony given in evidence before the court at the hearing in November 1950, she was persuaded by her mother after the birth of her sixth child to allow Maria to go and stay with Aminah in Bandung for three or four days. Consequently, Aminah arrived on 1 January 1943 to fetch Maria. When the child was not returned, Mrs. Hertogh borrowed a bicycle on 6 January and set out to retrieve her daughter. She claimed that she was stopped by a Japanese sentry on the outskirts of Bandung as she did not possess a pass and was therefore interned.\n\nFrom her internment camp, she smuggled a letter to her mother, requesting for her children to be sent to her. This Nor Louise did, but Maria was not among them. So Mrs. Hertogh asked her mother to fetch Maria from Aminah. Her mother later wrote and told her that Aminah wanted to keep Maria for two more days, after which she herself would bring the child to the camp. This did not materialise and Mrs. Hertogh did not see Maria throughout her internment. After her release, she could find neither Maria nor Aminah.\n\n===Muslim===\nUpon arriving with Aminah, Maria was given the name '''Nadra binte Ma'arof'''. For unknown reasons her new family moved to [[Jakarta]] for a period before moving back to [[Bandung]], where Aminah worked for the [[Kempetai|Japanese military police]] as an [[Interpreting|interpreter]] until the end of the war.\n\nIn 1947, fearing harm upon the family during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] because Maria was a ''putih'' (\"White Child\"), Aminah moved back to her hometown of [[Kemaman]], [[Terengganu]], [[Malayan Union|Malaya]]. By then Maria was the same as any other [[Malay people|Malay]] Muslim girl of her age: she spoke only [[Malay language|Malay]], wore Malay clothes and practised her religion devoutly.\n\n===Custody battle===\nIn 1945, with the end of [[World War II]], Sergeant Hertogh was released and returned to [[Java (island)|Java]], where he reunited with his wife. The couple said that they enquired about Maria but could find neither their daughter nor Aminah. They then returned to the Netherlands after requesting the Dutch authorities in Java and Singapore to try to trace the child. Investigations were then made by the [[Red Cross Society]], the [[Indonesian Repatriation Service]], the [[Royal Netherlands Army]], and local police. Finally, in September 1949, Aminah and Maria were traced to the [[kampung]] in which they were living.\n\nNegotiations were opened to retrieve Maria in early 1950. The Dutch Consulate offered [[Malayan dollar|$]]500 to make up for Aminah's expenses in bringing up the girl for eight years. Aminah rejected the offer and refused to give up her foster-daughter. Nonetheless, she was persuaded to travel with Maria to Singapore in April to discuss the issue with the Dutch Consul-General. However, Aminah could not be persuaded and the Consulate applied to the [[High Court of Singapore]] on 22 April for Maria to be delivered into the custody of the [[Social Welfare Department (Singapore)|Social Welfare Department]], pending further order. The [[Chief Justice]] heard the request the same day and approved the application ''[[ex parte]]''.\n\nThe next day, an officer from the department served the order on Aminah and took Maria away. After a routine medical examination at the [[Middle Road Hospital]], she was admitted to the [[Girls Homecraft Centre]] at [[York Hill]]. From this point onwards, Maria had made it clear that she wanted to stay with Aminah and did not wish to be returned to her natural parents. However, after a 15-minute hearing on 19 May, the High Court ruled that the custody of Maria be granted to the Hertoghs.\n\nAs Aminah and Maria exited the court via the back door, a car from the Consulate was waiting to take Maria away. Maria refused to enter the car and clung on to Aminah, both shouting in Malay that they would kill themselves rather than be separated. A large crowd quickly formed around the commotion. It was only after much persuasion that Aminah agreed to enter the car together with Maria and pay a visit to her lawyer, who explained that Maria had to be given up until an appeal was made. The duo then parted in tears, with Maria returned to York Hill for temporary safekeeping.\n\nMaria stayed at [[York Hill]] for two more months under a further order from the Chief Justice pending appeal, which was filed on 28 July. The verdict was an over-ruling of the earlier decision. Aside from the ''ex parte'' order to hand Maria to the Social Welfare Department, the Appellate Court found ambiguity in the Dutch Consul-General's representation of Maria's natural father, a rather minor and technical detail but apparently significant enough under the circumstance. Both Aminah and Maria were overjoyed.\n\n===Controversial marriage===\nOn 1 August 1950 Maria was married in a Muslim ritual to 22-year-old Mansoor Adabi, a Malayan-born who was then a teacher-in-training at the [[Bukit Panjang Government School]]. The marriage could have been a manoeuvre by Aminah to prevent further attempts by the Hertoghs to get back their daughter, as Maria returned to live with Aminah after the wedding night and the new couple never consummated their marriage. Whether such speculation was true was unimportant in the subsequent development of events, in which Maria, a willing bride nonetheless, became the central figure.\n\nThe first challenges on the appropriateness of the marriage actually came from the Muslim community. On 10 August a Muslim leader wrote to [[The Straits Times]], pointing out that although [[Sharia|Islamic law]] permits the marriage of girls starting after [[puberty]] (which Maria had reached a year earlier), there were Muslim countries such as [[Egypt]] that legislated for a minimum marriage age of 16. He added, however, that it would not be in the interest of \"the friendly understanding... between Christians and Muslims\" to object to the marriage since it had already taken place. The latter view was held by the Muslim population at large, albeit in a more antagonistic mood against the Dutch and Europeans at large.\n\n===Second appeal===\nMeanwhile, the Hertoghs had not given up legal pursuit to retrieve their daughter. Only a day after the marriage, Aminah received the Hertoghs' representative lawyers from [[Kuala Lumpur]]. The lawyers deliver a letter demanding the return of Maria by 10 August, failing which legal action would be taken. Believing that the marriage settled the matter, Aminah and Mansoor both ignored the deadline. The Hertoghs did not. On 26 August, an originating summons was taken out, under the Guardianship of Infants Ordinance, by the Hertoghs as [[plaintiff]]s against Aminah, Maria and Mansoor, who were all made [[defendant]]s.\n\nThe hearing did not begin till 20 November. For four months the matter hung in suspense. During this time, Maria rarely left her residence in the house of M.A. Majid, then president of the [[Muslim Welfare Association, Singapore|Muslim Welfare Association]], because in her own words, she attracted \"too much attention\". Nevertheless, media coverage on the incident had grown to a global scale. Letters from Muslim organisations in [[Pakistan]] promising financial and other help arrived, some going so far as to declare any further move by the Dutch Government to separate the couple as \"an open challenge to the Muslim world\". Pledges of aid also came from Maria's native [[Indonesia]] and as far as [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\nThe hearing finally opened, and Maria's natural mother, Adeline Hertogh travelled down to Singapore to attend. The judge, Justice Brown, delivered the verdict two weeks later. The marriage, instead of resolving the dispute, had instead complicated it. Justice Brown had two issues on his hand, namely the legality of the marriage and the custody of Maria. He held that the marriage was invalid because:\n\n#Maria's [[Domicile (law)|country of domicile]] was, by law that of her natural father, i.e. the [[Netherlands]]. Under the Dutch laws, the minimum age of marriage for girls was 16. The English law applicable in Singapore recognised the marriage laws of the subject's country of domicile.\n#An exception to the above point could not be established because neither Mansoor, born in [[Kelantan]], could be proved to be domiciled in Singapore nor Maria be considered a Muslim by law{{ref|M3}}. During her [[Minor (law)|minority]], Maria's natural father, who was a Christian, had the legal right to control her religion. He had testified that he would never consent to her conversion to Islam.\n\nHaving over-ruled the purported marriage, Justice Brown went on to deal with what he described as the \"most difficult\" question of [[Child custody|custody]]. He noted that his duty to the law required him \"to have regard primarily to the welfare of the infant\". He believed this meant that he not only had to consider the current wishes of Maria, but also her future well-being. He stated:\n\n<blockquote>It is natural that she should now wish to remain in Malaya among people whom she knows. But who can say that she will have the same views some years hence after her outlooks has been enlarged, and her contacts extended, in the life of the family to which she belongs?</blockquote>\n\nHe also noted that whatever the details of the contested initiation of the custody at the end of 1942 might be, Adrianus Hertogh had not been part of it and had not abrogated his parental rights. He therefore awarded the custody of Maria to the Hertoghs and ordered that she should be handed over to her mother with immediate effect.\n\n===Stay at the convent===\nWhen policewomen came to take Maria away, she wept and clung to Aminah and Mansoor. Aminah fainted on the spot and a doctor standing by had to attend to her. Mansoor advised Maria to concede for the time being and promised that he and others would carry on the legal fight. Thus Maria allowed herself to be brought away into a car. Outside, the police, including a [[Gurkha Contingent]], held back a crowd of several hundred.\n\nThe car delivered Maria to the Roman Catholic Convent of the Good Shepherd, run by the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd|Sisters of the Good Shepherd]], at Thomson Road. Mrs. Hertogh stayed at another address for a few days, from where she visited Maria daily, before moving into the convent herself. According to an official of the Netherlands Consulate-General, such arrangement was because of \"greater convenience\" while the stay of execution pending appeal was in effect. But it proved to be the spark that lit the fuse of the subsequent riots.\n\nFirst and foremost, the press was not barred from entering the [[convent]] grounds. Nor were they restricted in any way in their approach to the incident, which had been nothing shy of sensational. On 5 December, the ''[[Singapore Tiger Standard]]'' published on its front page a photograph of Maria standing holding hands with the [[Abbess|Reverend Mother]]. There were several more pictures on page 2, under the headline: ''Bertha knelt before Virgin Mary Statue''. The [[Malay language|Malay]] press retorted. The ''[[Utusan Melayu]]'' published on 7 December three photographs of Maria weeping and being comforted by a nun, as well as articles about Maria's \"lonely and miserable\" life in the convent.\n\nThese pictures, whether presenting Maria as happy or sad, mostly showed Maria surrounded by symbols of Christian faith. The [[Muslim]]s, who looked upon Maria as one of their own, were deeply offended by such pictures, not to mention the sensational reports, some of which explicitly labelled the case as a religious issue between Islam and Christianity.\n\nOn 9 December, an organisation calling itself the Nadra Action Committee was formally constituted under the leadership of [[Karim Ghani]], a Muslim political activist from [[Yangon|Rangoon]]. This extreme organisation solicited support among local Muslims by distributing free copies of its newspaper, the ''Dawn'' (not the ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', an English paper published in Pakistan). Karim Ghani had also made an open speech at the [[Sultan Mosque, Singapore|Sultan Mosque]] on 8 December in which he mentioned [[jihad]] as a final resort.\n\nIn the light of these potent signs of a great disturbance, the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] sent a memo to the [[Chief Secretary, Singapore|Colonial Secretary]] suggesting moving Maria back to York Hill to avoid further inciting Muslim anger. The Secretary did not agree on grounds that he had received no such representations from Muslim leaders, nor did he have the authority to remove Maria without further court orders&nbsp;\u2013 weak excuses since Maria could be relocated with her mother's consent. Nonetheless, it cannot be said definitively that moving Maria out of the convent at such a late stage could have averted the riots.\n\n[[File:SGstory Maria2.jpg|frame|Crowds were enraged by the Court's rejection of the appeal.]]\n\n==The riots==\nThe appeal hearing opened on 11 December. Maria stayed at the convent and did not attend. Since early morning, crowds carrying banners and flags with [[star and crescent]] symbols began to gather around the [[Old Supreme Court Building, Singapore|Supreme Court]]. By noon, when the hearing eventually began, the restive crowd had grown to 2,000 to 3,000 in number. The court threw out the appeal within five minutes. The brevity of the hearing convinced the gathering that the colonial legal system was biased against Muslims. The riots erupted.\n\nThe riots continued for three days and a curfew was imposed for two weeks. The mob (largely consisting of Muslims) moved out to attack any [[European ethnic groups|European]]s and even [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]] in sight. They overturned cars and burnt them. The police force, its lower ranks largely consisted of [[Malay people|Malays]] who sympathised with the rioters' cause, were ineffective in quelling the riots. By nightfall the riots had spread to even the more remote parts of the island. Help from the [[British military]] was enlisted only at around 6:45 PM. Major-General Dunlop promptly deployed two [[Internal Security Battalion]]s while calling in further reinforcements from [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]]. Meanwhile, various Muslim leaders appealed over the radio for the riots to cease.\n\nReinforcements arrived early on 12 December, but riotous incidents continued on that day. The troops and police only managed to regain control of the situation by noon on 13 December. In total, 18 people were killed, among whom were seven Europeans or Eurasians, [[List of Singapore police officers killed in the line of duty|two police officers]], and nine rioters shot by the police or military, 173 were injured, many of them seriously, 119 vehicles were damaged, and at least two buildings were set on fire. Subsequently, two weeks of 24-hour curfew were imposed, and it was a long time before complete law and order was re-established.\n\n==The trials==\n\n{{Quote|text=The first procession to be arranged would be this \u2013 1500 girls aged 14 and under would march in procession to the Convent to present a Quran, a praying carpet and two Malay dresses to Maria. One of the many complaints is the rumour that the Quran, the praying carpet, and the Malay dresses sent by mother Aminah did not reach Maria. |author=The words of Karim Ghani at the congregation to adopt four remedies to calm the tense situation, quoted in |source=Haja Maideen, The Nadra Tragedy: the Maria Hertogh Controversy, p. 220.}}\n\nAfter the riot, the police set up a special investigation unit which detained 778 people, among them [[Karim Ghani]]{{ref|M4}}. Out of these, 403 were released unconditionally and 106 were released on various conditions (they generally had to report to the police station monthly and adhere to a curfew after dark). The police eventually brought rioting charges against 200 people, of whom 25 were acquitted, 100 were convicted, 62 were referred to the Enquiry Advisory Committee, and seven were brought to trial at the [[Assize Court]] for wanton killing and five of them were subsequently sentenced to [[death penalty|death]] on the [[gallows]]. One of the five that was sentenced to the [[gallows]] was A.K.S. [[Othman Ghani]], a respectable Indian businessman from [[Madras]], the founder of the once famous [[Jubilee Cafe and Restaurant]].\n\nOn 25 August 1951, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], who would later become the first Prime Minister of [[Malaysia]], took over as the president of [[UMNO]], a [[Malaysian Malay|Malay]] and therefore Muslim party. He immediately set out to save the five on death row. Having garnered support from the Muslim population, Abdul Rahman placed pressure on the authorities, who finally gave in. The British government was expecting their role as the colonial master to end very soon and did not wish to leave behind grim memories. The death sentences for all five were commuted to [[life imprisonment]].\n\n==Reviews==\nA Commission of Inquiry was appointed by Governor [[Franklin Charles Gimson|Franklin Gimson]]. It was headed by Sir Lionel Leach, a member of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. The Commission placed large blame on the police command for not having anticipated the violence from many indicators between 2 and 11 December. Furthermore, when the riots first started, the police failed to act promptly to disperse the crowd. The [[Gurkha Contingent]] standing by was not put into action, while too much dependence was placed on [[Malay people|Malay]] policemen, many of whom defected or at least hesitated to carry out their duties. The [[British House of Commons]] criticised the colonial government for its poor handling of the situation.\n\nPresent day [[Government of Singapore]] also attributed the tragedy to the insensitivity of the colonial government towards the racial and religious feelings of the locals. It cites the incident as a vital lesson learnt in the importance of racial and religious understanding and harmony. It also cites the incident as a case for placing a certain degree of governmental control on the media, especially when racial or religious issues are implicated.'''\n\n==Epilogue==\nOn the night the riots broke out, Maria Hertogh was moved out of the convent, where the rioters tried twice to march on and were only kept back by the police. Plans were made at York Hill to receive her but she was instead sent to [[Saint John's Island]], an offshore island 4 miles south of the main island of Singapore. The next day, Maria and Adeline Hertogh departed for the Netherlands by aeroplane. After landing in [[Schiphol Airport]], they quickly proceeded to the Hertogh home on the outskirts of [[Bergen op Zoom]].\n\nAt first, Maria could only talk to her mother, the only one in the family who understood [[Malay language|Malay]]. She demanded rice with every meal, resenting the western diet. She continued to say her [[Muslim]] prayers five times a day. In addition, a policeman in plain clothes was assigned to escort her whenever she left the house, for fear of possible [[kidnap]]pers who might take her back to Singapore, following reported sighting of \"oriental strangers\" around town. The house was also placed under surveillance.\n\nSlowly, Maria began to adjust to her new environment. A nun came to the house daily to teach her [[Dutch language|Dutch]] until she was proficient enough to attend a local convent school. She also began to attend [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] with her family. Back in Singapore, Aminah and Mansoor had apparently given up hope of retrieving Maria after leave to appeal to the [[Privy Council]] was not granted. Earlier interest of the several Muslim groups involved had also gradually died down.\n\nOn 20 April 1956, Maria married Johan Gerardus Wolkefeld,{{ref|M5}} a 21-year-old [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Catholic]]. On 15 February 1957, she gave birth to a son, the first of ten children. However, Maria did not seem to be contented. As she told ''[[De Telegraaf]]'', she often had rows with her mother, who lived nearby. She also said she still longed for her Malayan homeland. Johan and Mansoor began corresponding. In letters both expressed wish for Maria to travel to Malaya to visit the aged Aminah, but such trip was never made due primarily to financial difficulties. Aminah died in 1976 and Mansoor would die of a heart attack in 1988.\n\nThe life story of Maria took another dramatic turn on 16 August 1976, when Maria found herself on trial in a Dutch court charged with plotting to murder her husband. She admitted in court that she had been thinking about leaving her husband but was afraid to start divorce proceedings in case she lost [[child custody|custody]] of her children. She came into contact with two regular customers at her husband's caf\u00e9 bar. The trio bought a [[revolver]] and recruited a fourth accomplice to carry out the actual murder. However, the last member got cold feet and gossiped about the murder plan. The police quickly learnt of it and arrested all four conspirators.\n\nIn her defence, Maria's lawyers brought up her background, which the court acknowledged. With this in mind, and because the plot was never executed and there was no proof that she offered any inducement to the other three, the three-man bench acquitted Maria. Meanwhile, Maria had also filed for divorce on the grounds of the irreparable breakdown of her marriage.\n\n==Death==\n\nOn 8 July 2009, Maria Hertogh died at her house in [[Huijbergen]] from [[leukemia]] at the age of 72{{ref|M5}} of the same cancer that killed her adoptive elder sister, Kamariah Mohd Dahan, of Japanese descent, whom she visited in 1998 in Kemaman. The highly emotional visit was the first time they had met after being separated for 48 years. But it would be the only time they would see each other before Kamariah died.\n\nIn 2014, Singaporean channel [[Channel NewsAsia]], in cooperation with Monsoon Pictures, broadcast a five-part documentary about the tumultuous era of the 1950s and 1960s in [[Singapore]] called ''Days of Rage'' and it featured the Maria Hertogh riots, including exclusive interviews with Hertogh herself and Kamariah prior to their deaths.<ref>{{citenews|title=DAYS OF RAGE \u2014 Nadra|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/tv/tvshows/daysofrage/nadra/959854.html|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}</ref><ref>{{citenews|title=CHANNEL NEWSASIA TO AIR NEW DOCUMENTARY ABOUT MARIA HERTOGH RIOTS|url=http://www.monsoonpictures.com/channel-news-asia-to-air-new-documentary-about-the-maria-hertogh-riots/|publisher=Monsoon Pictures|date=10 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035812/http://www.monsoonpictures.com/channel-news-asia-to-air-new-documentary-about-the-maria-hertogh-riots/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Hertogh's son and two daughters were interviewed and spoke about witnessing their mother's frosty relationship with their grandmother Adeline and her struggle to come to terms with her painful childhood. Hertogh's son testified that Hertogh was not happy and felt betrayed. The siblings also paid a visit to Kemaman and met several elderly ''kampung'' residents who remembered the young Hertogh, then known to them as Nadra.\n\n==See also==\n*[[1969 Race Riots of Singapore]]\n*[[1964 Race Riots]]\n*[[List of riots in Singapore]]\n\n==Notes==\n#{{note|M1}}Her full name at birth was '''Huberdina Maria Hertogh'''. To Dutch and other westerners she was normally known as '''Bertha''' (or '''Berta''') '''Hertogh'''. The name given to her was '''Nadra binte Ma'arof''', which was the name used by the [[Malay people|Malays]] and other Muslims. However, '''Maria Hertogh''' was the name most frequently used in court proceedings and the English press. She died in 2009, Huijbergen, The Netherlands.\n#{{note|M2}}There was an uncanny parallel between the early lives of Maria Hertogh and her mother. Adeline Hunter, born a [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]], was adopted by a Muslim family at a young age. She married Adrianus Hertogh at the age of 15, upon which she converted to Christianity. Maria would later go through the same conversion, at around the same age, albeit involuntarily.

A protest by outraged Muslims escalated into a riot when images were published showing 13-year-old Maria Hertogh (or Bertha Hertogh) kneeling before a statue of the [[Virgin Mary]]. Riots in Singapore lasted until noon on 13 December 1950. Eighteen people were killed and 173 injured. Many properties were also damaged.\n\nHertogh (also known as ''Nadra'') had been in the care of Che Aminah binte Mohamed before being returned to her [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Dutch Catholic]] biological parents.\n\n==Maria Hertogh==\n\n===Early life===\nMaria Hertogh was born on 24 March 1937 to a [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Dutch Catholic]] family living in [[Cimahi]], near [[Bandung]], [[Java (island)|Java]], then a part of the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]). Her father, Adrianus Petrus Hertogh, came to Java in the 1920s as a [[sergeant]] in the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]]. In the early 1930s, he married Adeline Hunter, a [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] of [[Scottish people|Scottish]]-[[Javanese people|Javanese]] descent brought up in Java. Maria was [[baptism|baptised]] in the Roman Catholic Church of Saint Ignatius at Tjimahi on 10 April by a [[Catholic priest]].\n\nWhen [[World War II]] broke out, Adrianus Hertogh, as a sergeant in the [[Dutch Army]], was captured by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and sent to a [[POW]] camp in Japan, where he was kept until 1945. Meanwhile, Adeline Hertogh stayed with her mother, Nor Louise, and her five children, among whom Maria was the third and youngest daughter. On 29 December 1942, Mrs. Hertogh gave birth to her sixth child, a boy. Three days later, Maria went to stay with Aminah binte Mohammad, a 42-year-old Malay woman from [[Kemaman]], Terengganu, Malaya (now [[Malaysia]]) and a close friend of Nor Louise.\n\n====Adeline Hertogh's version====\nAccording to Maria's biological mother, Adeline Hertogh, in testimony given in evidence before the court at the hearing in November 1950, she was persuaded by her mother after the birth of her sixth child to allow Maria to go and stay with Aminah in Bandung for three or four days. Consequently, Aminah arrived on 1 January 1943 to fetch Maria. When the child was not returned, Mrs. Hertogh borrowed a bicycle on 6 January and set out to retrieve her daughter. She claimed that she was stopped by a Japanese sentry on the outskirts of Bandung as she did not possess a pass and was therefore interned.\n\nFrom her internment camp, she smuggled a letter to her mother, requesting for her children to be sent to her. This Nor Louise did, but Maria was not among them. So Mrs. Hertogh asked her mother to fetch Maria from Aminah. Her mother later wrote and told her that Aminah wanted to keep Maria for two more days, after which she herself would bring the child to the camp. This did not materialise and Mrs. Hertogh did not see Maria throughout her internment. After her release, she could find neither Maria nor Aminah.\n\n===Muslim===\nUpon arriving with Aminah, Maria was given the name '''Nadra binte Ma'arof'''. For unknown reasons her new family moved to [[Jakarta]] for a period before moving back to [[Bandung]], where Aminah worked for the [[Kempetai|Japanese military police]] as an [[Interpreting|interpreter]] until the end of the war.\n\nIn 1947, fearing harm upon the family during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] because Maria was a ''putih'' (\"White Child\"), Aminah moved back to her hometown of [[Kemaman]], [[Terengganu]], [[Malayan Union|Malaya]]. By then Maria was the same as any other [[Malay people|Malay]] Muslim girl of her age: she spoke only [[Malay language|Malay]], wore Malay clothes and practised her religion devoutly.\n\n===Custody battle===\nIn 1945, with the end of [[World War II]], Sergeant Hertogh was released and returned to [[Java (island)|Java]], where he reunited with his wife. The couple said that they enquired about Maria but could find neither their daughter nor Aminah. They then returned to the Netherlands after requesting the Dutch authorities in Java and Singapore to try to trace the child. Investigations were then made by the [[Red Cross Society]], the [[Indonesian Repatriation Service]], the [[Royal Netherlands Army]], and local police. Finally, in September 1949, Aminah and Maria were traced to the [[kampung]] in which they were living.\n\nNegotiations were opened to retrieve Maria in early 1950. The Dutch Consulate offered [[Malayan dollar|$]]500 to make up for Aminah's expenses in bringing up the girl for eight years. Aminah rejected the offer and refused to give up her foster-daughter. Nonetheless, she was persuaded to travel with Maria to Singapore in April to discuss the issue with the Dutch Consul-General. However, Aminah could not be persuaded and the Consulate applied to the [[High Court of Singapore]] on 22 April for Maria to be delivered into the custody of the [[Social Welfare Department (Singapore)|Social Welfare Department]], pending further order. The [[Chief Justice]] heard the request the same day and approved the application ''[[ex parte]]''.\n\nThe next day, an officer from the department served the order on Aminah and took Maria away. After a routine medical examination at the [[Middle Road Hospital]], she was admitted to the [[Girls Homecraft Centre]] at [[York Hill]]. From this point onwards, Maria had made it clear that she wanted to stay with Aminah and did not wish to be returned to her natural parents. However, after a 15-minute hearing on 19 May, the High Court ruled that the custody of Maria be granted to the Hertoghs.\n\nAs Aminah and Maria exited the court via the back door, a car from the Consulate was waiting to take Maria away. Maria refused to enter the car and clung on to Aminah, both shouting in Malay that they would kill themselves rather than be separated. A large crowd quickly formed around the commotion. It was only after much persuasion that Aminah agreed to enter the car together with Maria and pay a visit to her lawyer, who explained that Maria had to be given up until an appeal was made. The duo then parted in tears, with Maria returned to York Hill for temporary safekeeping.\n\nMaria stayed at [[York Hill]] for two more months under a further order from the Chief Justice pending appeal, which was filed on 28 July. The verdict was an over-ruling of the earlier decision. Aside from the ''ex parte'' order to hand Maria to the Social Welfare Department, the Appellate Court found ambiguity in the Dutch Consul-General's representation of Maria's natural father, a rather minor and technical detail but apparently significant enough under the circumstance. Both Aminah and Maria were overjoyed.\n\n===Controversial marriage===\nOn 1 August 1950 Maria was married in a Muslim ritual to 22-year-old Mansoor Adabi, a Malayan-born who was then a teacher-in-training at the [[Bukit Panjang Government School]]. The marriage could have been a manoeuvre by Aminah to prevent further attempts by the Hertoghs to get back their daughter, as Maria returned to live with Aminah after the wedding night and the new couple never consummated their marriage. Whether such speculation was true was unimportant in the subsequent development of events, in which Maria, a willing bride nonetheless, became the central figure.\n\nThe first challenges on the appropriateness of the marriage actually came from the Muslim community. On 10 August a Muslim leader wrote to [[The Straits Times]], pointing out that although [[Sharia|Islamic law]] permits the marriage of girls starting after [[puberty]] (which Maria had reached a year earlier), there were Muslim countries such as [[Egypt]] that legislated for a minimum marriage age of 16. He added, however, that it would not be in the interest of \"the friendly understanding... between Christians and Muslims\" to object to the marriage since it had already taken place. The latter view was held by the Muslim population at large, albeit in a more antagonistic mood against the Dutch and Europeans at large.\n\n===Second appeal===\nMeanwhile, the Hertoghs had not given up legal pursuit to retrieve their daughter. Only a day after the marriage, Aminah received the Hertoghs' representative lawyers from [[Kuala Lumpur]]. The lawyers deliver a letter demanding the return of Maria by 10 August, failing which legal action would be taken. Believing that the marriage settled the matter, Aminah and Mansoor both ignored the deadline. The Hertoghs did not. On 26 August, an originating summons was taken out, under the Guardianship of Infants Ordinance, by the Hertoghs as [[plaintiff]]s against Aminah, Maria and Mansoor, who were all made [[defendant]]s.\n\nThe hearing did not begin till 20 November. For four months the matter hung in suspense. During this time, Maria rarely left her residence in the house of M.A. Majid, then president of the [[Muslim Welfare Association, Singapore|Muslim Welfare Association]], because in her own words, she attracted \"too much attention\". Nevertheless, media coverage on the incident had grown to a global scale. Letters from Muslim organisations in [[Pakistan]] promising financial and other help arrived, some going so far as to declare any further move by the Dutch Government to separate the couple as \"an open challenge to the Muslim world\". Pledges of aid also came from Maria's native [[Indonesia]] and as far as [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\nThe hearing finally opened, and Maria's natural mother, Adeline Hertogh travelled down to Singapore to attend. The judge, Justice Brown, delivered the verdict two weeks later. The marriage, instead of resolving the dispute, had instead complicated it. Justice Brown had two issues on his hand, namely the legality of the marriage and the custody of Maria. He held that the marriage was invalid because:\n\n#Maria's [[Domicile (law)|country of domicile]] was, by law that of her natural father, i.e. the [[Netherlands]]. Under the Dutch laws, the minimum age of marriage for girls was 16. The English law applicable in Singapore recognised the marriage laws of the subject's country of domicile.\n#An exception to the above point could not be established because neither Mansoor, born in [[Kelantan]], could be proved to be domiciled in Singapore nor Maria be considered a Muslim by law{{ref|M3}}. During her [[Minor (law)|minority]], Maria's natural father, who was a Christian, had the legal right to control her religion. He had testified that he would never consent to her conversion to Islam.\n\nHaving over-ruled the purported marriage, Justice Brown went on to deal with what he described as the \"most difficult\" question of [[Child custody|custody]]. He noted that his duty to the law required him \"to have regard primarily to the welfare of the infant\". He believed this meant that he not only had to consider the current wishes of Maria, but also her future well-being. He stated:\n\n<blockquote>It is natural that she should now wish to remain in Malaya among people whom she knows. But who can say that she will have the same views some years hence after her outlooks has been enlarged, and her contacts extended, in the life of the family to which she belongs?</blockquote>\n\nHe also noted that whatever the details of the contested initiation of the custody at the end of 1942 might be, Adrianus Hertogh had not been part of it and had not abrogated his parental rights. He therefore awarded the custody of Maria to the Hertoghs and ordered that she should be handed over to her mother with immediate effect.\n\n===Stay at the convent===\nWhen policewomen came to take Maria away, she wept and clung to Aminah and Mansoor. Aminah fainted on the spot and a doctor standing by had to attend to her. Mansoor advised Maria to concede for the time being and promised that he and others would carry on the legal fight. Thus Maria allowed herself to be brought away into a car. Outside, the police, including a [[Gurkha Contingent]], held back a crowd of several hundred.\n\nThe car delivered Maria to the Roman Catholic Convent of the Good Shepherd, run by the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd|Sisters of the Good Shepherd]], at Thomson Road. Mrs. Hertogh stayed at another address for a few days, from where she visited Maria daily, before moving into the convent herself. According to an official of the Netherlands Consulate-General, such arrangement was because of \"greater convenience\" while the stay of execution pending appeal was in effect. But it proved to be the spark that lit the fuse of the subsequent riots.\n\nFirst and foremost, the press was not barred from entering the [[convent]] grounds. Nor were they restricted in any way in their approach to the incident, which had been nothing shy of sensational. On 5 December, the ''[[Singapore Tiger Standard]]'' published on its front page a photograph of Maria standing holding hands with the [[Abbess|Reverend Mother]]. There were several more pictures on page 2, under the headline: ''Bertha knelt before Virgin Mary Statue''. The [[Malay language|Malay]] press retorted. The ''[[Utusan Melayu]]'' published on 7 December three photographs of Maria weeping and being comforted by a nun, as well as articles about Maria's \"lonely and miserable\" life in the convent.\n\nThese pictures, whether presenting Maria as happy or sad, mostly showed Maria surrounded by symbols of Christian faith. The [[Muslim]]s, who looked upon Maria as one of their own, were deeply offended by such pictures, not to mention the sensational reports, some of which explicitly labelled the case as a religious issue between Islam and Christianity.\n\nOn 9 December, an organisation calling itself the Nadra Action Committee was formally constituted under the leadership of [[Karim Ghani]], a Muslim political activist from [[Yangon|Rangoon]]. This extreme organisation solicited support among local Muslims by distributing free copies of its newspaper, the ''Dawn'' (not the ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', an English paper published in Pakistan). Karim Ghani had also made an open speech at the [[Sultan Mosque, Singapore|Sultan Mosque]] on 8 December in which he mentioned [[jihad]] as a final resort.\n\nIn the light of these potent signs of a great disturbance, the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] sent a memo to the [[Chief Secretary, Singapore|Colonial Secretary]] suggesting moving Maria back to York Hill to avoid further inciting Muslim anger. The Secretary did not agree on grounds that he had received no such representations from Muslim leaders, nor did he have the authority to remove Maria without further court orders&nbsp;\u2013 weak excuses since Maria could be relocated with her mother's consent. Nonetheless, it cannot be said definitively that moving Maria out of the convent at such a late stage could have averted the riots.\n\n[[File:SGstory Maria2.jpg|frame|Crowds were enraged by the Court's rejection of the appeal.]]\n\n==The riots==\nThe appeal hearing opened on 11 December. Maria stayed at the convent and did not attend. Since early morning, crowds carrying banners and flags with [[star and crescent]] symbols began to gather around the [[Old Supreme Court Building, Singapore|Supreme Court]]. By noon, when the hearing eventually began, the restive crowd had grown to 2,000 to 3,000 in number. The court threw out the appeal within five minutes. The brevity of the hearing convinced the gathering that the colonial legal system was biased against Muslims. The riots erupted.\n\nThe riots continued for three days and a curfew was imposed for two weeks. The mob (largely consisting of Muslims) moved out to attack any [[European ethnic groups|European]]s and even [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]] in sight. They overturned cars and burnt them. The police force, its lower ranks largely consisted of [[Malay people|Malays]] who sympathised with the rioters' cause, were ineffective in quelling the riots. By nightfall the riots had spread to even the more remote parts of the island. Help from the [[British military]] was enlisted only at around 6:45 PM. Major-General Dunlop promptly deployed two [[Internal Security Battalion]]s while calling in further reinforcements from [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]]. Meanwhile, various Muslim leaders appealed over the radio for the riots to cease.\n\nReinforcements arrived early on 12 December, but riotous incidents continued on that day. The troops and police only managed to regain control of the situation by noon on 13 December. In total, 18 people were killed, among whom were seven Europeans or Eurasians, [[List of Singapore police officers killed in the line of duty|two police officers]], and nine rioters shot by the police or military, 173 were injured, many of them seriously, 119 vehicles were damaged, and at least two buildings were set on fire. Subsequently, two weeks of 24-hour curfew were imposed, and it was a long time before complete law and order was re-established.\n\n==The trials==\n\n{{Quote|text=The first procession to be arranged would be this \u2013 1500 girls aged 14 and under would march in procession to the Convent to present a Quran, a praying carpet and two Malay dresses to Maria. One of the many complaints is the rumour that the Quran, the praying carpet, and the Malay dresses sent by mother Aminah did not reach Maria. |author=The words of Karim Ghani at the congregation to adopt four remedies to calm the tense situation, quoted in |source=Haja Maideen, The Nadra Tragedy: the Maria Hertogh Controversy, p. 220.}}\n\nAfter the riot, the police set up a special investigation unit which detained 778 people, among them [[Karim Ghani]]{{ref|M4}}. Out of these, 403 were released unconditionally and 106 were released on various conditions (they generally had to report to the police station monthly and adhere to a curfew after dark). The police eventually brought rioting charges against 200 people, of whom 25 were acquitted, 100 were convicted, 62 were referred to the Enquiry Advisory Committee, and seven were brought to trial at the [[Assize Court]] for wanton killing and five of them were subsequently sentenced to [[death penalty|death]] on the [[gallows]]. One of the five that was sentenced to the [[gallows]] was A.K.S. [[Othman Ghani]], a respectable Indian businessman from [[Madras]], the founder of the once famous [[Jubilee Cafe and Restaurant]].\n\nOn 25 August 1951, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], who would later become the first Prime Minister of [[Malaysia]], took over as the president of [[UMNO]], a [[Malaysian Malay|Malay]] and therefore Muslim party, which was the ruling party in Malaysia until [[2018 Malaysian general election|2018]]. He immediately set out to save the five on death row. Having garnered support from the Muslim population, Abdul Rahman placed pressure on the authorities, who finally gave in. The British government was expecting their role as the colonial master to end very soon and did not wish to leave behind grim memories. The death sentences for all five were commuted to [[life imprisonment]].\n\n==Reviews==\nA Commission of Inquiry was appointed by Governor [[Franklin Charles Gimson|Franklin Gimson]]. It was headed by Sir Lionel Leach, a member of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. The Commission placed large blame on the police command for not having anticipated the violence from many indicators between 2 and 11 December. Furthermore, when the riots first started, the police failed to act promptly to disperse the crowd. The [[Gurkha Contingent]] standing by was not put into action, while too much dependence was placed on [[Malay people|Malay]] policemen, many of whom defected or at least hesitated to carry out their duties. The [[British House of Commons]] criticised the colonial government for its poor handling of the situation.\n\nPresent day [[Government of Singapore]] also attributed the tragedy to the insensitivity of the colonial government towards the racial and religious feelings of the locals. It cites the incident as a vital lesson learnt in the importance of racial and religious understanding and harmony. It also cites the incident as a case for placing a certain degree of governmental control on the media, especially when racial or religious issues are implicated.'''\n\n==Epilogue==\nOn the night the riots broke out, Maria Hertogh was moved out of the convent, where the rioters tried twice to march on and were only kept back by the police. Plans were made at York Hill to receive her but she was instead sent to [[Saint John's Island]], an offshore island 4 miles south of the main island of Singapore. The next day, Maria and Adeline Hertogh departed for the Netherlands by aeroplane. After landing in [[Schiphol Airport]], they quickly proceeded to the Hertogh home on the outskirts of [[Bergen op Zoom]].\n\nAt first, Maria could only talk to her mother, the only one in the family who understood [[Malay language|Malay]]. She demanded rice with every meal, resenting the western diet. She continued to say her [[Muslim]] prayers five times a day. In addition, a policeman in plain clothes was assigned to escort her whenever she left the house, for fear of possible [[kidnap]]pers who might take her back to Singapore, following reported sighting of \"oriental strangers\" around town. The house was also placed under surveillance.\n\nSlowly, Maria began to adjust to her new environment. A nun came to the house daily to teach her [[Dutch language|Dutch]] until she was proficient enough to attend a local convent school. She also began to attend [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] with her family. Back in Singapore, Aminah and Mansoor had apparently given up hope of retrieving Maria after leave to appeal to the [[Privy Council]] was not granted. Earlier interest of the several Muslim groups involved had also gradually died down.\n\nOn 20 April 1956, Maria married Johan Gerardus Wolkefeld,{{ref|M5}} a 21-year-old [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Catholic]]. On 15 February 1957, she gave birth to a son, the first of ten children. However, Maria did not seem to be contented. As she told ''[[De Telegraaf]]'', she often had rows with her mother, who lived nearby. She also said she still longed for her Malayan homeland. Johan and Mansoor began corresponding. In letters both expressed wish for Maria to travel to Malaya to visit the aged Aminah, but such trip was never made due primarily to financial difficulties. Aminah died in 1976 and Mansoor would die of a heart attack in 1988.\n\nThe life story of Maria took another dramatic turn on 16 August 1976, when Maria found herself on trial in a Dutch court charged with plotting to murder her husband. She admitted in court that she had been thinking about leaving her husband but was afraid to start divorce proceedings in case she lost [[child custody|custody]] of her children. She came into contact with two regular customers at her husband's caf\u00e9 bar. The trio bought a [[revolver]] and recruited a fourth accomplice to carry out the actual murder. However, the last member got cold feet and gossiped about the murder plan. The police quickly learnt of it and arrested all four conspirators.\n\nIn her defence, Maria's lawyers brought up her background, which the court acknowledged. With this in mind, and because the plot was never executed and there was no proof that she offered any inducement to the other three, the three-man bench acquitted Maria. Meanwhile, Maria had also filed for divorce on the grounds of the irreparable breakdown of her marriage.\n\n==Death==\n\nOn 8 July 2009, Maria Hertogh died at her house in [[Huijbergen]] from [[leukemia]] at the age of 72{{ref|M5}} of the same cancer that killed her adoptive elder sister, Kamariah Mohd Dahan, of Japanese descent, whom she visited in 1998 in Kemaman. The highly emotional visit was the first time they had met after being separated for 48 years. But it would be the only time they would see each other before Kamariah died.\n\nIn 2014, Singaporean channel [[Channel NewsAsia]], in cooperation with Monsoon Pictures, broadcast a five-part documentary about the tumultuous era of the 1950s and 1960s in [[Singapore]] called ''Days of Rage'' and it featured the Maria Hertogh riots, including exclusive interviews with Hertogh herself and Kamariah prior to their deaths.<ref>{{citenews|title=DAYS OF RAGE \u2014 Nadra|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/tv/tvshows/daysofrage/nadra/959854.html|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}</ref><ref>{{citenews|title=CHANNEL NEWSASIA TO AIR NEW DOCUMENTARY ABOUT MARIA HERTOGH RIOTS|url=http://www.monsoonpictures.com/channel-news-asia-to-air-new-documentary-about-the-maria-hertogh-riots/|publisher=Monsoon Pictures|date=10 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035812/http://www.monsoonpictures.com/channel-news-asia-to-air-new-documentary-about-the-maria-hertogh-riots/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Hertogh's son and two daughters were interviewed and spoke about witnessing their mother's frosty relationship with their grandmother Adeline and her struggle to come to terms with her painful childhood. Hertogh's son testified that Hertogh was not happy and felt betrayed. The siblings also paid a visit to Kemaman and met several elderly ''kampung'' residents who remembered the young Hertogh, then known to them as Nadra.\n\n==See also==\n*[[1969 Race Riots of Singapore]]\n*[[1964 Race Riots]]\n*[[List of riots in Singapore]]\n\n==Notes==\n#{{note|M1}}Her full name at birth was '''Huberdina Maria Hertogh'''. To Dutch and other westerners she was normally known as '''Bertha''' (or '''Berta''') '''Hertogh'''. The name given to her was '''Nadra binte Ma'arof''', which was the name used by the [[Malay people|Malays]] and other Muslims. However, '''Maria Hertogh''' was the name most frequently used in court proceedings and the English press. She died in 2009, Huijbergen, The Netherlands.\n#{{note|M2}}There was an uncanny parallel between the early lives of Maria Hertogh and her mother. Adeline Hunter, born a [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]], was adopted by a Muslim family at a young age. She married Adrianus Hertogh at the age of 15, upon which she converted to Christianity. Maria would later go through the same conversion, at around the same age, albeit involuntarily. Moreover, both were eventually married to [[Dutch people|Dutch]] soldiers.\n#{{note|M3}}If and only if both conditions were met could the [[Muslim law]] practised in Singapore be applied to the case, which would render the marriage valid.\n#{{note|M4}}Karim Ghani was arrested along with several members of the Nadra Action Committee and held at the detention camp on [[Saint John's Island]] for 15 months under Emergency Regulation 20 for his part in the riots before being released on grounds of poor health.\n#{{note|M5}}Family tree of [http://home.kabelfoon.nl/~pberends/wolkenfelt/hertogh_bertha_1008591301.html Johannes Gerardus Wolkenfelt], Berthe and their ten children\n#{{note|M6}}[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news_lite.php?id=424252 Maria Hertogh (Natrah) meninggal dunia di Belanda] (English version [http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news_lite.php?id=424254 here]) as reported by Malaysian ambassador to the Kingdom of Netherlands through e-mail to Bernama News Agency.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Library resources box |onlinebooks=no |by=no }}\n*{{cite book|author=Tom Earnes Hughes|title=Tangled Worlds: The Story of Maria Hertogh|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|year=1980|isbn=978-9971-902-12-4}}\n*Fatini Yaacob, magazine \u2013 Dewan Masyarakat published by Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, Malaysia \u2013 Februari-Mei, 1989 (the long interview with Maria Huberdina Hertogh @ Bertha @ Nadra was done in Lake Tahoe, Nevada United States of America, Mac 1989)\n* {{cite book|author=Haja Maideen|title=The Nadra Tragedy|publisher=Pelanduk Publications|year=2000|isbn=978-967-978-287-5}}\n* {{cite web|title=The Maria Hertogh Riots (11 Dec 1950) |website=Ministry of Education, NationalEducation |url=http://www.moe.gov.sg/ne/sgstory/mariahertogh.htm |accessdate=19 October 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025162203/http://www.moe.gov.sg/ne/sgstory/mariahertogh.htm |archivedate=25 October 2005 |url-status=dead }}''broken URL''\n* Syed Muhd Khairudin Aljunied, ''Colonialism, Violence and Muslims in Southeast Asia: The Maria Hertogh Controversy and Its Aftermath'', London: Routledge, 2009.\n* {{cite web|title=Maria Hertogh Riots|website=National Library Board|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_83_2005-02-02.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228164120/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_83_2005-02-02.html|archivedate=28 February 2009}}\n* Fatini Yaacob, book \u2013 \"Natrah: Cinta, Rusuhan dan Air Mata, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia\", year 2010, {{ISBN|978-983-52-0731-0}}/{{ISBN|978-983-52-0729-7}} \n* Fatini Yaacob, book \u2013 \"In The Name of Love \u2013 Natrah\", Institut Terjemahan Buku Negara (now ITBM),2011, {{ISBN|978-983-068-606-6}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q51daa9HZ-M YouTube Story of a Nation \u2013 Maria Hertogh]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI8fxB7LRbc YouTube Message from Maria Hertogh a.k.a.

A part of the Slavic Greeks also migrated to Australia, the United States and Canada.

All Macedonian language printing stopped and the language was no longer taught in Bulgaria.\n\nThe existence of a Macedonian language and Macedonian ethnos is highly disputed in Bulgaria. Most Bulgarians do not recognize the Macedonian language as a separate language and assert that it is a dialect of Bulgarian. There are two dialects in Bulgaria which are considered Macedonian in North Macedonia: the [[Male\u0161evo-Pirin dialect|Male\u0161evo-Pirin]] (widely spoken in most of [[Blagoevgrad Province]] in Bulgaria and [[Del\u010devo]] region in the Republic of Macedonia) and the [[Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect|Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop]] ones.
