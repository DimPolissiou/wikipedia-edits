It was founded by [[Mother Angelica]], [[Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration|PCPA]], in 1980 and began broadcasting on August 15, 1981, from a garage [[Television studio|studio]] at the Our Lady of the Angels Monastery in [[Irondale, Alabama]], which Mother Angelica founded in 1962.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1400|title=Mother Angelica Encyclopedia of Alabama|website=Encyclopedia of Alabama|access-date=2016-03-29}}</ref> She hosted her own show, ''Mother Angelica Live'', until suffering a major [[stroke]] and other health issues in September 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/general/press/pr_detail.asp?id=86|title=EWTN Press Release&nbsp;\u2014 Two Years After Suffering a Major Stroke Mother Angelica Lives Her Life of Prayer|work=ewtn.com}}</ref> Repeats now air as either the ''Best of Mother Angelica Live'' or ''Mother Angelica Live Classics''.

In 1962 she established Our Lady of the Angels monastery. During the 1970s, she was an in-demand lecturer and produced pamphlets and audio and video tapes. She had been a guest on local station [[WIAT|WBMG]] (currently WIAT, Channel 42), and on shows on the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] and the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]]. After she gave an interview on then-Christian station [[WCPX-TV|WCFC]] (Channel 38) in [[Chicago]], she decided she wanted her own network. \"I walked in, and it was just a little studio, and I remember standing in the doorway and thinking, 'It doesn't take much to reach the masses'. I just stood there and said to the Lord, 'Lord, I've got to have one of these'\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFD71F3FF93BA35753C1A96F948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=Scandals Aside, TV Preachers Thrive |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Peter |last=Applebome |date=October 8, 1989}}</ref>\n\nMother Angelica purchased satellite space and EWTN began broadcasting on August 15, 1981, with four hours of daily programming, which included her own show, ''Mother Angelica Live'' (aired bi-weekly), a Sunday Mass, and reruns of older Catholic programs such as Archbishop [[Fulton J. Sheen]]'s ''[[Life Is Worth Living]]''. The remainder of the time was filled with shows produced by dioceses across the country, shows from [[Protestantism|Protestant]] sources which Mother Angelica determined were in concert with [[Catholic theology|Catholic teachings]], and children's shows such as ''Joy Junction'' and ''The Sunshine Factory''. About one-third of programming time consisted of secular content, such as re-runs of ''[[The Bill Cosby Show]]'', [[public domain]] films, and cooking and [[Western (genre)|western]]-themed shows. EWTN eventually increased its broadcast schedule to six hours per day and then to eight hours per day by 1986. Secular content was gradually reduced from 1986 to 1988, and [[Satellite television|satellite distribution]] was expanded late in 1987, after which EWTN acquired a far more desirable satellite channel and began broadcasting around the clock. At this point, EWTN began broadcasting the praying of the rosary on a daily basis and added a number of educational shows. In-house production of original programming gradually increased. The Mass became televised daily in 1991 from a chapel on the monastery grounds. Most shows from non-Catholic sources were eliminated and a more theological image gradually developed.\n\n== Radio ==\n{{Main|WEWN}}\nIn 1992, EWTN established the largest privately owned shortwave radio station, WEWN, in the vicinity of [[Birmingham, Alabama]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn 1996, Mother Angelica announced that EWTN would make its radio signal available via satellite to AM and FM stations throughout the [[United States]] at no cost.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/a-signal-for-the-new-evangelization|title=A Signal for the New Evangelization|author=|date=|work=NCRegister.com|access-date=April 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, programs included ''Mother Angelica Live'' and \"Life Is Worth Living\" with Fulton J.

EWTN officially assumed total control on February 1, 2011.<ref name=\"ncregister.com\" /> EWTN also owns 'Catholic News Agency' which is a Catholic news service with bureaus across America, Latin America and Europe.\n\n== News coverage ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nThe EWTN news department produces a daily news service for television and radio, featuring news sources including [[Vatican Radio]]. It also produces ''The World Over Live'', which reports relevant current events. Journalist and author [[Raymond Arroyo]], who is EWTN's news director, hosts the program. The program is conservative in its political orientation and generally conservative in its religious orientation. Notable guests have included Robert Rector of [[The Heritage Foundation]], author and activist [[George Weigel]], political commentator [[Laura Ingraham]], conservative political commentator [[Pat Buchanan]], and the late columnist and commentator [[Robert Novak]], a [[Jews|Jewish]] convert to the Catholic Faith.\n\n== History of programming ==\nIn its early history, EWTN broadcast Catholic programming from a great variety of Catholic sources, which ranged from Catholic charismatic programming, such as that of [[Michael Manning (priest)|Fr. Michael Manning]], to programs focusing on [[Reform movement |social reform]] and [[social justice]], such as ''[[The Christophers|Christopher Closeup]]'', to [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|doctrinal]] programs hosted by clergy.\n\nIn the early 1990s, EWTN began producing more of its own programs. This effort marked a conspicuously conservative shift in its overall orientation, with programs on topics of social reform and justice gradually eliminated and replaced by programs on doctrine and programs of dialogue. The shift was apparent in the daily televised Masses, which, in 1992, began incorporating [[Latin]] into the liturgy and gradually eliminated contemporary music. Some untelevised Masses are totally in [[English language|English]] and some include more contemporary music. On [[Christmas Eve]] of 1993, Mother Angelica and the nuns of her order reverted to traditional [[Religious habit|habits]]. From 1992 on, the [[Latin]] portions of the Mass included the Gloria, introduction of the Gospel readings, the Sanctus, and the remainder of the Mass after the Great Amen, beginning with the Lord's Prayer.\n\nAmong its notable weekly programs are ''The Journey Home'' and ''Life on the Rock''. ''The Journey Home'', hosted by Marcus Grodi, presents [[Religious conversion|converts]] to the Catholic Faith. Grodi is a former [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] who converted to the Catholic Faith in 1992.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chnetwork.org/information/marcus-grodi/|title=Marcus Grodi&nbsp;\u2014 The Coming Home Network|work=The Coming Home Network}}</ref> Although most guests are former [[Protestantism|Protestants]], former members of non-[[Christianity|Christian]] faiths (such as [[Judaism]]) and former [[Atheism|atheists]] occasionally appear. ''Life on the Rock'' is hosted by Rev. Mark Mary, [[Franciscan Missionaries of the Eternal Word|MFVA]] and Doug Barry.\n\nThe HD feed first became available to Comcast customers in [[Richmond, Virginia]], and its vicinity on May 11, 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/general/press/pr_detail.asp?id=283|title=EWTN Press Release&nbsp;\u2014 EWTN HD Launches on Comcast in Richmond Area|work=ewtn.com}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2011, EWTN became available through the [[Roku]] streaming player.

Regular programs include a daily [[Mass (liturgy) |Holy Mass]] and sometimes [[Tridentine Mass]] format, the traditional [[Stations of the Cross]], a taped daily recitation of the [[Rosary]], and daily and weekly news, discussion, and [[Catechesis|Catechetical]] programs for both adults and children.

In 1962 she established Our Lady of the Angels monastery. During the 1970s, she was an in-demand lecturer and produced pamphlets and audio and video tapes. She had been a guest on local station [[WIAT|WBMG]] (currently WIAT, Channel 42), and on shows on the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] and the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]]. After she gave an interview on then-Christian station [[WCPX-TV|WCFC]] (Channel 38) in [[Chicago]], she decided she wanted her own network. \"I walked in, and it was just a little studio, and I remember standing in the doorway and thinking, 'It doesn't take much to reach the masses'.

Sheen]]'s ''[[Life Is Worth Living]]''. The remainder of the time was filled with shows produced by dioceses across the country, shows from [[Protestantism|Protestant]] sources which Mother Angelica determined were in concert with [[Catholic theology|Catholic teachings]], and children's shows such as ''Joy Junction'' and ''The Sunshine Factory''. About one-third of programming time consisted of secular content, such as re-runs of ''[[The Bill Cosby Show]]'', [[public domain]] films, and cooking and [[Western (genre)|western]]-themed shows. EWTN eventually increased its broadcast schedule to six hours per day and then to eight hours per day by 1986. Secular content was gradually reduced from 1986 to 1988, and [[Satellite television|satellite distribution]] was expanded late in 1987, after which EWTN acquired a far more desirable satellite channel and began broadcasting around the clock. At this point, EWTN began broadcasting the praying of the rosary on a daily basis and added a number of educational shows. In-house production of original programming gradually increased. The Mass became televised daily in 1991 from a chapel on the monastery grounds. Most shows from non-Catholic sources were eliminated and a more theological image gradually developed.\n\n== Radio ==\n{{Main|WEWN}}\nIn 1992, EWTN established the largest privately owned shortwave radio station, WEWN, in the vicinity of [[Birmingham, Alabama]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn 1996, Mother Angelica announced that EWTN would make its radio signal available via satellite to AM and FM stations throughout the [[United States]] at no cost.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/a-signal-for-the-new-evangelization|title=A Signal for the New Evangelization|author=|date=|work=NCRegister.com|access-date=April 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, programs included ''Mother Angelica Live'' and \"Life Is Worth Living\" with Fulton J.

EWTN officially assumed total control on February 1, 2011.<ref name=\"ncregister.com\" /> EWTN also owns 'Catholic News Agency' which is a Catholic news service with bureaus across America, Latin America and Europe.\n\n== News coverage ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nThe EWTN news department produces a daily news service for television and radio, featuring news sources including [[Vatican Radio]]. It also produces ''The World Over Live'', which reports relevant current events. Journalist and author [[Raymond Arroyo]], who is EWTN's news director, hosts the program. The program is conservative in its political orientation and generally conservative in its religious orientation. Notable guests have included Robert Rector of [[The Heritage Foundation]], author and activist [[George Weigel]], political commentator [[Laura Ingraham]], conservative political commentator [[Pat Buchanan]], and the late columnist and commentator [[Robert Novak]], a [[Jews|Jewish]] convert to the Catholic Faith.\n\n== History of programming ==\nIn its early history, EWTN broadcast Catholic programming from a great variety of Catholic sources, which ranged from Catholic charismatic programming, such as that of [[Michael Manning (priest)|Fr. Michael Manning]], to programs focusing on [[Reform movement |social reform]] and [[social justice]], such as ''[[The Christophers|Christopher Closeup]]'', to [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|doctrinal]] programs hosted by clergy.\n\nIn the early 1990s, EWTN began producing more of its own programs. This effort marked a conspicuously conservative shift in its overall orientation, with programs on topics of social reform and justice gradually eliminated and replaced by programs on doctrine and programs of dialogue. The shift was apparent in the daily televised Masses, which, in 1992, began incorporating [[Latin]] into the liturgy and gradually eliminated contemporary music. Some untelevised Masses are totally in [[English language|English]] and some include more contemporary music. On [[Christmas Eve]] of 1993, Mother Angelica and the nuns of her order reverted to traditional [[Religious habit|habits]]. From 1992 on, the [[Latin]] portions of the Mass included the Gloria, introduction of the Gospel readings, the Sanctus, and the remainder of the Mass after the Great Amen, beginning with the Lord's Prayer.\n\nAmong its notable weekly programs are ''The Journey Home'' and ''Life on the Rock''. ''The Journey Home'', hosted by Marcus Grodi, presents [[Religious conversion|converts]] to the Catholic Faith. Grodi is a former [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] who converted to the Catholic Faith in 1992.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chnetwork.org/information/marcus-grodi/|title=Marcus Grodi&nbsp;\u2014 The Coming Home Network|work=The Coming Home Network}}</ref> Although most guests are former [[Protestantism|Protestants]], former members of non-[[Christianity|Christian]] faiths (such as [[Judaism]]) and former [[Atheism|atheists]] occasionally appear. ''Life on the Rock'' is hosted by Rev. Mark Mary, [[Franciscan Missionaries of the Eternal Word|MFVA]] and Doug Barry.\n\nThe HD feed first became available to Comcast customers in [[Richmond, Virginia]], and its vicinity on May 11, 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/general/press/pr_detail.asp?id=283|title=EWTN Press Release&nbsp;\u2014 EWTN HD Launches on Comcast in Richmond Area|work=ewtn.com}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2011, EWTN became available through the [[Roku]] streaming player.

If the price makes a [[Astrological aspect|major aspect]] (e.g. conjunction, trine, square, etc.), then it is believed that the price will reach a short-term top or bottom.\n\nWhen a price, after converting into a degree in the longitude, is in aspect with the planets, the trend is likely to change. For example, in Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trading Systems and Methods|last=Kaufman|first=Perry J.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2013|isbn=9781118043561|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref> Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, \u201cApr 16 low 103, down 79\u00bd cents from 182\u00bd and nearing $1.00 per bushel, a natural support level\u2014Time to watch for change in trend.\u201d<ref name=\":19\" /> Coincidentally, 103\u00b0 (or 13\u00b0 Cancer) was where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were in conjunction on that day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Nautical Almanac And Astronomical Ephemeris for the Year 1925|last=Commissioners Of Longitude|first=|publisher=The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|year=1922|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nGann also used scales other than 1 dollar or point per 1 degree.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://ganntrade6.com/wp-content/uploads/Coffee.pdf|title=May Coffee Santos D|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|date=19 Mar 1954|website=|access-date=14 Feb 2018}}</ref> Two notable scales are $12 and $30 to one degree, because the two largest planets in the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, take approximately 12 and 30 years to orbit the Sun respectively.<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example again, it would become 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0, which are 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 Aries in terms of zodiac. Gann also uses a scale of $0.07 ($1/15) to 1 degree, which is based on the Earth's rotation in 24 hours (for 24 times 15\u00b0 is 360\u00b0).<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example, $120 times 15 will be 1800\u00b0, and when it is divided by 360\u00b0, the remainder is 0.

The most important angle Gann called the 1x1 or the 45\u00b0 angle, which he said represented one unit of price for one unit of time.

The corn top price was \u00a2137, which was around 104\u00b0, thus the three points loosely formed a Grand Trine.]]\nAccording to Patrick Mikula,<ref name=\":3\" /> the rule of using the Spiral Chart or the Hexagon Chart is as follows:\n\n# Identify the planetary combination(s) which governs the price movements of the commodity. For example, as stated above, corn is sensitive to Venus and Saturn.\n# Look for a date when the planetary combinations ruling the commodity makes a major [[astrological aspect]], like opposition, trine and square.\n# Overlay the Spiral or Hexagon Chart onto the horoscope in the following way:\n#* On the Spiral Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 1, 2, 11, 28, 53 and so on.\n#* On the Hexagon Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 0, 6, 18, 36, 60 and so on.\n# Find the current price on the Spiral or Hexagon Chart. For example, $36 is roughly at 135\u00b0 on the Spiral Chart, and at 0\u00b0 on the Hexagon Chart.\n# See if the price makes any aspect to the planetary combination:\n#* If the combination involves Jupiter, then compare the angle of the price to Jupiter;\n#* Else, compare to the outer planet of the two.\n#* In the case of Venus-Saturn, since Jupiter is not involved, the price is compared against Saturn.\n# If the price makes an important aspect to Jupiter or the outer planet, then a turning point may have been reached.\n#* The important aspects in the Spiral Chart are the multiples of 45\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 315\u00b0.\n#* The important aspects in the Hexagon Chart are the multiples of 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 300\u00b0\n# By repeated experimentation, the trader can determine with chart (Spiral or Hexagon) works better on which commodity, and so forth.\n\nHere are a few actual trading examples in Corn given by Gann in ''How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market''.<ref name=\":6\" /> As stated earlier, Gann thought that the price of corn was influenced by the aspects of Venus and Saturn, thus the angle of the price on the Hexagon Chart is compared against Saturn.

The first one is that, when a planet returns to its position during a recent eclipse, then trend is likely to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The second way is that when a planet crosses an eclipse spot which happens during a market top or bottom, then the down or up move will accelerate.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Planetary averages ===\nGann maintained two formulas for calculating planetary averages.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The first one is called the Mean of Five (MOF), which is arithmetic mean of the geocentric and heliocentric longitudes of the outer five planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other is called the Cycle of Eight (COE), which include all eight planets in its calculation, using both geocentric and heliocentric longitudes (the Sun replaces the Earth in the geocentric calculation). He thinks that when these averaged values make an aspect to the price, it will create support or resistance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal view on religion ==\nEven though Gann was thought to be \u201creligious\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /> a careful analysis of his writings finds that he did not agree with the conventional Christian teachings. On page 99 to 100 of his novel ''[[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air]]'' (1927),<ref name=\":0\" /> Gann revealed some of his personal believes towards religion through a conversation between the protagonist, Robert Gordon, and his mother:\n\n\u201cShe talked to Robert of his future and told him she hoped he would be a preacher. Robert confided to her that he could never be an orthodox minister, for he could not preach and teach the things which the orthodox ministers were teaching. He did not believe in a personal devil or believe in Hell, but believed in a God of Love and Justice. He did not believe that God would inflict upon any of his children eternal punishment but thought that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and that we receive our reward here upon earth.\n\n\u201cHe told her that the Bible plainly said that the kingdom of heaven is within us and he believed it. If we kept our conscience clear and did unto others as we would like to have them do unto us, he believed we would find our heaven and our reward here upon earth. Said that times and conditions were changing rapidly; that the new inventions and discoveries caused men to think differently than in the old days; that the old religious ideas would pass away and give place to more liberal, advanced ideas. He hoped to live to see the day when men would not only be too proud to fight, but would be too full of love for their fellowman to settle disputes with the sword. This was God's plan and it would come to pass this way, and he believed that he could be a great power for peace and hoped to live to see a world of peace with all nations united under one kingdom and one God, the God of Love and Justice.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three years later, on page 21 of his book ''The Magic Word'' (1950),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Word|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Lambert Gann|year=1950|isbn=|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}</ref> he expressed similar ideas:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses. Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are here on this earth. Jesus said, \u2018As ye sow, also shall ye reap.\u2019 He did not say \u2018after death\u2019 but here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.\u201d\n\n== Controversy ==\nThere has been a general disagreement whether Gann himself made profits by speculation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneystockstycoons.com/articles/w-d-gann-fraud-or-trading-genius-part-2/|title=W.D.

Gann's Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator (1946), in which Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, and 103\u00b0 is also where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were on that day.]]\nOne of the most controversial techniques that Gann used is that he converted the price directly to zodiac degrees.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> For example, if a commodity is trading at $120 per share, he would convert it to 120\u00b0 of the zodiac, which is 0\u00b0 Leo. If the price makes a [[Astrological aspect|major aspect]] (e.g. conjunction, trine, square, etc.), then it is believed that the price will reach a short-term top or bottom.\n\nWhen a price, after converting into a degree in the longitude, is in aspect with the planets, the trend is likely to change. For example, in Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trading Systems and Methods|last=Kaufman|first=Perry J.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2013|isbn=9781118043561|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref> Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, \u201cApr 16 low 103, down 79\u00bd cents from 182\u00bd and nearing $1.00 per bushel, a natural support level\u2014Time to watch for change in trend.\u201d<ref name=\":19\" /> Coincidentally, 103\u00b0 (or 13\u00b0 Cancer) was where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were in conjunction on that day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Nautical Almanac And Astronomical Ephemeris for the Year 1925|last=Commissioners Of Longitude|first=|publisher=The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|year=1922|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nGann also used scales other than 1 dollar or point per 1 degree.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://ganntrade6.com/wp-content/uploads/Coffee.pdf|title=May Coffee Santos D|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|date=19 Mar 1954|website=|access-date=14 Feb 2018}}</ref> Two notable scales are $12 and $30 to one degree, because the two largest planets in the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, take approximately 12 and 30 years to orbit the Sun respectively.<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example again, it would become 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0, which are 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 Aries in terms of zodiac. Gann also uses a scale of $0.07 ($1/15) to 1 degree, which is based on the Earth's rotation in 24 hours (for 24 times 15\u00b0 is 360\u00b0).<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example, $120 times 15 will be 1800\u00b0, and when it is divided by 360\u00b0, the remainder is 0. Therefore, it will become 0\u00b0 Aries in the zodiac.\n\nHere is an example from a private letter to a client on the coffee market:<ref name=\":5\" /> \n* The high in the May Coffee Santos D on 19 March 1954 was 8729.\n** Using a scale of one point to one degree, 8729\u00b0 = 360\u00b0 \u00d7 24 + 89\u00b0, and 89\u00b0 is 29\u00b0 Gemini. \n** Using a scale of 30 points to one degree, 8729\u00b0/30 = 291\u00b0, and 291\u00b0 is 21\u00b0 Capricorn. \n** Using a scale of 12 points to one degree, 8729\u00b0/12 = 727.5\u00b0 = 360\u00b0 \u00d7 2 + 7.5\u00b0, and 7.5\u00b0 is 7\u00b030\u2019 Aries. \n** Using a scale of one cent (100 points) to one degree, 8729\u00b0/100 = 87.29\u00b0, and 87.29\u00b0 is 27\u00b017\u2019 Gemini\n\n=== Gann angles ===\n{{main|Gann angles}}\nGann described the use of angles in the [[stock market]] in ''The Basis of My Forecasting Method'' (1935).

The most important angle Gann called the 1x1 or the 45\u00b0 angle, which he said represented one unit of price for one unit of time. When one draws a perfect square and then draw a diagonal line from one corner of the square to the other, it illustrates the concept of the 1x1 angle which moves up one point per day.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxYA1U7JZ6oC&pg=PA26&dq=%27%27The+Basis+of+My+Forecasting+Method%27%27+gann&client=firefox-a\n|title=Forecasting profits using price & time\n|last=Gately\n|first=Edward\n|publisher=John Wiley and Sons\n|year=1998\n|accessdate=2009-03-25\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Fibonacci Analysis|last=Brown|first=Constance M.|publisher=Bloomberg Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1576602614|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref>\n\nHere is an example from a private letter of Gann to a client on the coffee market:<ref name=\":5\" />\n* The high in the May Coffee Santos D on 19 March 1954 was 8729.\n* The low on 16 April 1932 was 435.

The corn top price was \u00a2137, which was around 104\u00b0, thus the three points loosely formed a Grand Trine.]]\nAccording to Patrick Mikula,<ref name=\":3\" /> the rule of using the Spiral Chart or the Hexagon Chart is as follows:\n\n# Identify the planetary combination(s) which governs the price movements of the commodity. For example, as stated above, corn is sensitive to Venus and Saturn.\n# Look for a date when the planetary combinations ruling the commodity makes a major [[astrological aspect]], like opposition, trine and square.\n# Overlay the Spiral or Hexagon Chart onto the horoscope in the following way:\n#* On the Spiral Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 1, 2, 11, 28, 53 and so on.\n#* On the Hexagon Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 0, 6, 18, 36, 60 and so on.\n# Find the current price on the Spiral or Hexagon Chart. For example, $36 is roughly at 135\u00b0 on the Spiral Chart, and at 0\u00b0 on the Hexagon Chart.\n# See if the price makes any aspect to the planetary combination:\n#* If the combination involves Jupiter, then compare the angle of the price to Jupiter;\n#* Else, compare to the outer planet of the two.\n#* In the case of Venus-Saturn, since Jupiter is not involved, the price is compared against Saturn.\n# If the price makes an important aspect to Jupiter or the outer planet, then a turning point may have been reached.\n#* The important aspects in the Spiral Chart are the multiples of 45\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 315\u00b0.\n#* The important aspects in the Hexagon Chart are the multiples of 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 300\u00b0\n# By repeated experimentation, the trader can determine with chart (Spiral or Hexagon) works better on which commodity, and so forth.\n\nHere are a few actual trading examples in Corn given by Gann in ''How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market''.<ref name=\":6\" /> As stated earlier, Gann thought that the price of corn was influenced by the aspects of Venus and Saturn, thus the angle of the price on the Hexagon Chart is compared against Saturn.

The first one is that, when a planet returns to its position during a recent eclipse, then trend is likely to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The second way is that when a planet crosses an eclipse spot which happens during a market top or bottom, then the down or up move will accelerate.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Planetary averages ===\nGann maintained two formulas for calculating planetary averages.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The first one is called the Mean of Five (MOF), which is arithmetic mean of the geocentric and heliocentric longitudes of the outer five planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other is called the Cycle of Eight (COE), which include all eight planets in its calculation, using both geocentric and heliocentric longitudes (the Sun replaces the Earth in the geocentric calculation). He thinks that when these averaged values make an aspect to the price, it will create support or resistance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal view on religion ==\nEven though Gann was thought to be \u201creligious\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /> a careful analysis of his writings finds that he did not agree with the conventional Christian teachings. On page 99 to 100 of his novel ''[[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air]]'' (1927),<ref name=\":0\" /> Gann revealed some of his personal believes towards religion through a conversation between the protagonist, Robert Gordon, and his mother:\n\n\u201cShe talked to Robert of his future and told him she hoped he would be a preacher. Robert confided to her that he could never be an orthodox minister, for he could not preach and teach the things which the orthodox ministers were teaching. He did not believe in a personal devil or believe in Hell, but believed in a God of Love and Justice. He did not believe that God would inflict upon any of his children eternal punishment but thought that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and that we receive our reward here upon earth.\n\n\u201cHe told her that the Bible plainly said that the kingdom of heaven is within us and he believed it. If we kept our conscience clear and did unto others as we would like to have them do unto us, he believed we would find our heaven and our reward here upon earth. Said that times and conditions were changing rapidly; that the new inventions and discoveries caused men to think differently than in the old days; that the old religious ideas would pass away and give place to more liberal, advanced ideas. He hoped to live to see the day when men would not only be too proud to fight, but would be too full of love for their fellowman to settle disputes with the sword. This was God's plan and it would come to pass this way, and he believed that he could be a great power for peace and hoped to live to see a world of peace with all nations united under one kingdom and one God, the God of Love and Justice.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three years later, on page 21 of his book ''The Magic Word'' (1950),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Word|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Lambert Gann|year=1950|isbn=|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}</ref> he expressed similar ideas:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses. Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are here on this earth. Jesus said, \u2018As ye sow, also shall ye reap.\u2019 He did not say \u2018after death\u2019 but here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.\u201d\n\n== Controversy ==\nThere has been a general disagreement whether Gann himself made profits by speculation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneystockstycoons.com/articles/w-d-gann-fraud-or-trading-genius-part-2/|title=W.D.

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"Love Is the Hero\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life (1950-1980) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\nHowever, Piper broke up soon after and Squier, the band's frontman, signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in the spring of 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (also known for his stints with [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFresh off his debut album, Squier asked [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] to produce his next album, but he declined due to scheduling conflicts. However, he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]] who had produced Queen's then-latest album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack teamed to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which became a smash. Its lead single, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting the Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well charting high in Canada and Britain (where the song remains his only chart entry). \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In The Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-up singles and the album cut \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\" became a radio favourite and subsequently one of his signature songs. Squier became popular on the new MTV cable channel as well as on Album Rock radio. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling about 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Squier noted in a 1992 interview that \"the label didn't even ''want'' 'The Stroke' on the album\".\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor''.'' The album also climbed into ''Billboard's'' Top Five and sold just under 3 million copies in the United States. The title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for six weeks and reached No. 32 on the Hot 100. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier led his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier began recording his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in 1984. He had planned to team with [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]], who had recently produced Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania''. However, Lange was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and had suffered a breakdown, which prompted Squier to continue his search. He brought in [[Jim Steinman]], who was best known for his grandiose ballads and operatic rock n' roll songs - a rather odd choice for straight-forward arena rocker like Squier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> ''Signs of Life'' finally came in September 1984 and brought Squier his third consecutive platinum certification. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. The album saw him melting synth-pop into his guitar-based hard rock, which alienated his rock audience. Despite \"Rock Me Tonite\" being his highest charting US single, its homoerotic video has been considered by some, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered; on some occasions he played for half-empty stadiums during the Signs Of Life Tour. He fired both of his managers soon after realizing the damage and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed, that the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem as a sellout for his older fans. Squier removed the video from MTV's rotation, but the damage was already done.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued performing and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, playing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 song on the Mainstream Rock charts and featured a performance-based music video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. Squier chose not to embark on a tour since Capitol decided not to promote the album, which built strong tensions between him and the label.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' and is often regarded as one of the strongest inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best-charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did briefly restore Squier's mainstream success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled No Excess was also well received. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return anymore after the turn of the decade.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critic and audience reception was mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and some of its songs, such as his last Mainstream Rock entry \"Angry\" and fan favourite \"The Girl's All Right\" were later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout! Factory released ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]: 30th Anniversary Edition'' on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years.

During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, NY in support of his friend, rock photographer [[Rob Shanahan]] and his new book, \"Volume One.\" In June, Squier performed at the \"Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner\" in New York, in another fundraising effort for '[[Little Kids Rock]].' In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for \"The American Revolution,\" a documentary on legendary rock FM station WBCN at the House Of Blues in Boston.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Squier performed his 'Electric Man' show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player. They divided their time between a home in [[Bridgehampton]], [[Long Island]] and an apartment in [[The San Remo]] on [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].

He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\nHowever, Piper broke up soon after and Squier, the band's frontman, signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in the spring of 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (also known for his stints with [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFresh off his debut album, Squier asked [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] to produce his next album, but he declined due to scheduling conflicts. However, he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]] who had produced Queen's then-latest album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack teamed to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which became a smash. Its lead single, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting the Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well charting high in Canada and Britain (where the song remains his only chart entry). \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In The Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-up singles and the album cut \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\" became a radio favourite and subsequently one of his signature songs. Squier became popular on the new MTV cable channel as well as on Album Rock radio. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling about 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Squier noted in a 1992 interview that \"the label didn't even ''want'' 'The Stroke' on the album\".\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor''.'' The album also climbed into ''Billboard's'' Top Five and sold just under 3 million copies in the United States. The title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for six weeks and reached No. 32 on the Hot 100. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier led his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier began recording his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in 1984. He had planned to team with [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]], who had recently produced Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania''. However, Lange was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and had suffered a breakdown, which prompted Squier to continue his search. He brought in [[Jim Steinman]], who was best known for his grandiose ballads and operatic rock n' roll songs - a rather odd choice for straight-forward arena rocker like Squier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> ''Signs of Life'' finally came in September 1984 and brought Squier his third consecutive platinum certification. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. The album saw him melting synth-pop into his guitar-based hard rock, which alienated his rock audience. Despite \"Rock Me Tonite\" being his highest charting US single, its homoerotic video has been considered by some, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered; on some occasions he played for half empty stadiums during the Signs Of Life Tour. He fired both of his managers soon after realizing the damage and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed, that the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem as a sellout for his older fans. Squier removed the video from MTV's rotation, but the damage was already done.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued performing and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, playing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 song on the Mainstream Rock charts and featured a performance-based music video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. Squier chose not to embark on a tour since Capitol decided not to promote the album, which built strong tensions between him and the label.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' and is often regarded as one of the strongest inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did briefly restore Squier's mainstream success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled No Excess was also well received. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return anymore after the turn of the decade.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critic and audience reception was mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and some of its songs, such as his last Mainstream Rock entry \"Angry\" and fan favourite \"The Girl's All Right\" were later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout! Factory released ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]: 30th Anniversary Edition'' on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years.

During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, NY in support of his friend, rock photographer [[Rob Shanahan]] and his new book, \"Volume One.\" In June, Squier performed at the \"Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner\" in New York, in another fundraising effort for '[[Little Kids Rock]].' In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for \"The American Revolution,\" a documentary on legendary rock FM station WBCN at the House Of Blues in Boston.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Squier performed his 'Electric Man' show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player. They divided their time between a home in [[Bridgehampton]], [[Long Island]] and an apartment in [[The San Remo]] on [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Squier had been, as of 2016, an active volunteer for the [[Central Park Conservancy]] for more than 17 years, physically maintaining 20 acres (81,000 m2) of the park, as well as promoting the Conservancy in articles and interviews.

Of the hundreds of [[aularian]] houses that sprang up across the city, only [[St Edmund Hall]] (c. 1225) remains. What put an end to the halls was the emergence of colleges. [[Colleges of the University of Oxford#History|Oxford's earliest colleges]] were [[University College, Oxford|University College]] (1249), [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] (1263) and [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton]] (1264). These colleges were established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology, inspiring scientific discoveries and advancements in the arts, as society began to see itself in a new way. These colleges at Oxford were supported by the Church in the hope of reconciling [[Greek philosophy]] and [[Christian theology]]. The relationship between \"[[town and gown]]\" has often been uneasy \u2013 as many as 93 students and townspeople were killed in the [[St. Scholastica riot|St Scholastica Day Riot]] of 1355.\n\nThe [[sweating sickness]] epidemic in 1517 was particularly devastating to Oxford and [[Cambridge]] where it killed half of both cities' populations, including many students and dons.<ref>[http://www.storyoflondon.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=244&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0 \"The Sweating Sickness\"].

Another reminder of the ongoing war was found in the influx of wounded and disabled soldiers, who were treated in new hospitals housed in buildings such as the university's Examination School, the [[Oxford Town Hall|town hall]] and [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = History of the University of Oxford: Volume VIII: The Twentieth Century \u2013 Oxford Scholarship|url = http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198229742.001.0001/acprof-9780198229742|doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198229742.001.0001|access-date = 10 November 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117073638/http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198229742.001.0001/acprof-9780198229742|archive-date = 17 November 2015|url-status = live|year = 1994|isbn = 9780198229742|publisher = Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 20th century, there was rapid industrial and population growth, with the printing and publishing industries becoming well established by the 1920s. In 1929 the boundaries of the city were extended to include the suburbs of [[Headington]], [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]] and [[Iffley]] to the east, and [[Wolvercote]] to the north.<ref name=boundaries/>\n\nAlso during the 1920s, the economy and society of Oxford underwent a huge transformation as [[William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield|William Morris]] established [[Morris Motors|Morris Motors Limited]] to mass-produce cars in Cowley, on the south-eastern edge of the city. By the early 1970s over 20,000 people worked in Cowley at the huge Morris Motors and [[Pressed Steel Fisher]] plants. Oxford was now a city of two halves: the university city to the west of [[Magdalen Bridge]] and the car town to the east. This led to the witticism that \"Oxford is the left bank of Cowley\". Cowley suffered major job losses in the 1980s and 1990s during the decline of [[British Leyland]], but is now producing the successful [[Mini (marque)|Mini]] for [[BMW]] on a smaller site. Much of the original car factories at Cowley was demolished in the 1990s, and is now the site of the [[Oxford Business Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.hbs.edu/go/oxfordbg.html|title=Oxford Business Group Country Reports|work=hbs.edu|access-date=25 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730091137/http://www.library.hbs.edu/go/oxfordbg.html|archive-date=30 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Oxford was largely ignored by the German air raids during the [[The Blitz|Blitz]], perhaps due to the lack of heavy industry such as steelworks or shipbuilding that would have made it a target, although it was still affected by the rationing and influx of refugees fleeing London and other cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/120111_1.html|title=Exhibition remembers refugees who fled to Oxford before and during World War II|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021091922/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/120111_1.html|archivedate=21 October 2012}}</ref> The university's colleges served as temporary military barracks and training areas for soldiers before deployment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/345/brasenose-college-archives-and-history-38/college-life-214/college-life-in-wartime-421.html|title=College life in wartime|author=Neil Harvey|work=ox.ac.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515114548/http://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/345/brasenose-college-archives-and-history-38/college-life-214/college-life-in-wartime-421.html|archivedate=15 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 May 1954, [[Roger Bannister]], a 25-year-old medical student, ran the first authenticated sub-[[four-minute mile]] at the [[Iffley Road]] running track in Oxford.

These colleges were established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology, inspiring scientific discoveries and advancements in the arts, as society began to see itself in a new way. These colleges at Oxford were supported by the Church in the hope of reconciling [[Greek philosophy]] and [[Christian theology]].

By the early 1970s over 20,000 people worked in Cowley at the huge Morris Motors and [[Pressed Steel Fisher]] plants. Oxford was now a city of two halves: the university city to the west of [[Magdalen Bridge]] and the car town to the east. This led to the witticism that \"Oxford is the left bank of Cowley\". Cowley suffered major job losses in the 1980s and 1990s during the decline of [[British Leyland]], but is now producing the successful [[Mini (marque)|Mini]] for [[BMW]] on a smaller site.

The principal production site for [[Mini (marque)|Mini]] cars, owned by [[BMW]] since 2000, is in the Oxford suburb of [[Cowley, Oxfordshire|Cowley]]. The plant, which survived the threat of closure in the early 1990s, also produced cars under the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] and [[Rover Group|Rover]] brands following the demise of the Morris brand in 1984, although the last Morris-badged car was produced there in 1982.\n\n===Publishing===\n[[Oxford University Press]], a department of the University of Oxford, is based in the city, although it no longer operates its own paper mill and printing house. The city is also home to the UK operations of [[Wiley-Blackwell]], [[Elsevier]] and several smaller publishing houses.\n\n===Science and technology===\nThe presence of the university has given rise to many science and technology based businesses, including [[Oxford Instruments]], [[Research Machines]] and [[Sophos]]. The university established [[Isis Innovation]] in 1987 to promote technology transfer. The [[Oxford Science Park]] was established in 1990, and the [[Begbroke Science Park]], owned by the university, lies north of the city.\n\nOxford increasingly has a reputation for being a centre of digital innovation, as epitomized by Digital Oxford.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Home \u2013 Digital Oxford|url = http://digitaloxford.com/|website = Digital Oxford|accessdate = 3 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150509055659/http://digitaloxford.com/|archive-date = 9 May 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> Several startups including Passle,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Passle \u2013 become a thought leader|url = http://passle.net|website = Passle: Don't have time to blog?|accessdate = 3 June 2015}}</ref> Brainomix,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Brainomix|url = https://www.brainomix.com/|website = Brainomix|accessdate = 5 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150708091626/https://www.brainomix.com/|archive-date = 8 July 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> [[Labstep]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = Labstep|url = https://angel.co/labstep|website = angel.co|accessdate = 3 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150603230831/https://angel.co/labstep|archive-date = 3 June 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> and more, are based in Oxford.\n\n===Education===\nThe presence of the university has also led to Oxford becoming a centre for the education industry.

Several of the colleges had private breweries, one of which, at [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose]], survived until 1889. In the 16th century brewing and malting appear to have been the most popular trades in the city. There were breweries in [[Brewer Street, Oxford|Brewer Street]] and [[Paradise Street, Oxford|Paradise Street]], near the [[Castle Mill Stream]].\n\nThe rapid expansion of Oxford and the development of its railway links after the 1840s facilitated expansion of the brewing trade.<ref name=Woolley78>{{cite journal |last1=Woolley |first1=Liz |year=2010 |title=Industrial Architecture in Oxford, 1870 to 1914 |journal=Oxoniensia |volume=LXXV |page=78 |publisher=[[Oxfordshire Architectural and Historical Society]] |issn=0308-5562}}</ref> As well as expanding the market for Oxford's brewers, railways enabled brewers further from the city to compete for a share of its market.<ref name=Woolley78/> By 1874 there were nine breweries in Oxford and 13 brewers' agents in Oxford shipping beer in from elsewhere.<ref name=Woolley78/> The nine breweries were: Flowers & Co in [[Cowley Road]], Hall's St Giles Brewery, Hall's Swan Brewery (see below), Hanley's City Brewery in [[Queen Street, Oxford|Queen Street]], Le Mills's Brewery in [[St. Ebbes]], [[Morrells Brewing Company|Morrell's]] Lion Brewery in [[St Thomas', Oxford|St Thomas Street]] (see below), Simonds's Brewery in Queen Street, Weaving's Eagle Brewery (by 1869 the Eagle Steam Brewery) in [[Park End Street]] and Wootten and Cole's [[St Clement's, Oxford|St. Clement's]] Brewery.<ref name=Woolley78/>\n\nThe Swan's Nest Brewery, later the Swan Brewery, was established by the early 18th century in Paradise Street, and in 1795 was acquired by William Hall.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Page |editor-first=William |editor-link=William Page (historian) |series=Victoria County History |title=A History of the County of Oxford, Volume 2: Industries: Malting and Brewing |year=1907 |publisher=[[Archibald Constable]] & Co |pages=225\u2013277 |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=101945#s12 |access-date=5 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316074332/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=101945#s12 |archive-date=16 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The brewery became known as Hall's Oxford Brewery, which acquired other local breweries.

{"title_page": "Leon C. Shelly", "text_new": "{{short description|Canadian film producer}}\n'''Leon Curtis Shelly''' (1906\u20131987) was a Canadian producer of industrial and sponsored films, active in Vancouver (1936\u201345) and in Toronto (1945\u201356).\n\nHe was the son of [[William Curtis Shelly|W. C. Shelly]], a onetime Member of the BC Legislative Assembly (1928\u201333) and provincial finance minister. The elder Shelly was also co-founder of Shelly Brothers Ltd., a successful commercial bakery in Vancouver. In the early 1930s, Leon Shelly was involved in managing and developing the Grouse Mountain Resort in North Vancouver, another of his father's business ventures. \n\nIn 1936, Shelly assumed control of two existing motion picture service companies in Vancouver. Motion Skreenadz Limited had been founded in 1920, and was initially operated by J. Howard Boothe and Harry Rosenbaum. Skreenadz specialized in the production of theatrical advertising trailers or \"screen ads,\" but later expanded to make promotional shorts and travelogues for the local market.<ref>\"[https://movingimagesweb.wordpress.com/tag/leon-shelly/ Screen Ads by Skreenadz],\" a contribution on the film history blog ''Seriously Moving Images'' (Dec. 2018). The blog entry features video files showing three extant examples of Skreenadz advertising trailers, ca. 1928\u201337.</ref> Vancouver Motion Pictures Limited, founded in 1928 by Roger Bourne and Charles Lambly, initially provided film laboratory and technical services. The companies both had offices in the film exchange building at 1216 Burrard (at Davie) in downtown Vancouver.\n\nWith the help of cinematographer and technical wizard E. Wallace (Wally) Hamilton, Shelly updated the facilities and equipment necessary for film production, including optical sound recording, an essential component for commercial motion pictures. By the late 1930s, Shelly was producing quality industrial and sponsored films for the BC market, eventually combining the operations of the two companies under the name Vancouver Motion Pictures.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Camera West: British Columbia on Film, 1941-1965|last=Duffy|first=Dennis J.|publisher=Provincial Archives of British Columbia|year=1986|isbn=|location=Victoria|pages=11-12}}</ref>\n\n== Vancouver Motion Pictures ==\nUnder Shelly's leadership, Vancouver Motion Pictures emerged in the 1930s and 1940s as an active and busy production house, creating dozens of sponsored promotional and industrial shorts. The company and its staff would play an important early part in the development of the Vancouver film industry. Notable clients included the BC Government Travel Bureau, BC Packers, Kelly Douglas Limited, and the Powell River Company.\n\nShelly's operation brought professional colour film production to Vancouver, adopting the [[Cinecolor]] bi-pack (two-negative) colour process. On three bigger-budget 35 mm films produced for the Travel Bureau in 1940\u201342,<ref>''Beautiful British Columbia'', ''British Columbia Sports'' [aka ''Evergreen Playland''], and ''North of the Border''.</ref> intended for theatrical distribution to US audiences, he hired experienced  crew members from Hollywood, including cinematographer Ray Fernstrom, narrator Gayne Whitman, and editor Ed Taylor.\n\nThe regular staff working at Vancouver Motion Pictures included many people who would play important roles in the development of the Canadian film and television industry. They included directors Oscar C. Burritt, Lew M. Parry, and Ed Taylor; cinematographers Oscar C. Burritt, Wally Hamilton, Ernie Kirkpatrick, Don Lytle, and Mel Parry; editors Maureen Balfe and Hellen Semmens; and titling artist/art director/animator Marguerite Roozeboom (n\u00e9e Goulding).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1942\u201343, VMP began filming BC sequences for the National Film Board of Canada, which used the material in films for its propaganda series ''Canada Carries On'' and ''World In Action''.<ref name=\":0\" /> In spring 1943, a film industry trade journal reported that the company \"working full blast these days in commercial and government work.\"<ref>''Canadian Moving Picture Digest'', March 20, 1943, p. 8.</ref> By 1946, Shelly had made half a dozen complete documentaries for the NFB. The war years at Vancouver Motion Pictures proved critical in the emergence of filmmaking on Canada's west coast.<ref>Fox, Stanley. \"We are Where We Come From: The Founding of a Film Community in British Columbia.\" ''Journal of Canadian Studies'', vol. 16 no. 1 (Spring 1981), pp. 23\u201345.</ref>\n\n== Shelly Films (Toronto) ==\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, Shelly renamed Vancouver Motion Pictures as \"Shelly Films\" and moved the operation to Toronto, Ontario. Much of the VMP staff went east  to work there. However, Lew Parry stayed in Vancouver and started his own production company, eventually becoming BC's most prolific filmmaker.

C. Shelly]], a onetime Member of the BC Legislative Assembly (1928\u201333) and provincial finance minister. The elder Shelly was also co-founder of Shelly Brothers Ltd., a successful commercial bakery in Vancouver. In the early 1930s, Leon Shelly was involved in managing and developing the Grouse Mountain Resort in North Vancouver, another of his father's business ventures. \n\nIn 1936, Shelly assumed control of two existing motion picture service companies in Vancouver. Motion Skreenadz Limited had been founded in 1920, and was initially operated by J. Howard Boothe and Harry Rosenbaum. Skreenadz specialized in the production of theatrical advertising trailers or \"screen ads,\" but later expanded to make promotional shorts and travelogues for the local market.<ref>\"[https://movingimagesweb.wordpress.com/tag/leon-shelly/ Screen Ads by Skreenadz],\" a contribution on the film history blog ''Seriously Moving Images'' (Dec. 2018). The blog entry features video files showing three extant examples of Skreenadz advertising trailers, ca. 1928\u201337.</ref> Vancouver Motion Pictures Limited, founded in 1928 by Roger Bourne and Charles Lambly, initially provided film laboratory and technical services. The companies both had offices in the film exchange building at 1216 Burrard (at Davie) in downtown Vancouver.\n\nWith the help of cinematographer and technical wizard E. Wallace (Wally) Hamilton, Shelly updated the facilities and equipment necessary for film production, including optical sound recording, an essential component for commercial motion pictures. By the late 1930s, Shelly was producing quality industrial and sponsored films for the BC market, eventually combining the operations of the two companies under the name Vancouver Motion Pictures.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Camera West: British Columbia on Film, 1941-1965|last=Duffy|first=Dennis J.|publisher=Provincial Archives of British Columbia|year=1986|isbn=|location=Victoria|pages=11-12}}</ref>\n\n== Vancouver Motion Pictures ==\nUnder Shelly's leadership, Vancouver Motion Pictures emerged in the 1930s and 1940s as an active and busy production house, creating dozens of sponsored promotional and industrial shorts. The company and its staff would play an important early part in the development of the Vancouver film industry. Notable clients included the BC Government Travel Bureau, BC Packers, Kelly Douglas Limited, and the Powell River Company.\n\nShelly's operation brought professional colour film production to Vancouver, adopting the [[Cinecolor]] bi-pack (two-negative) colour process. On three bigger-budget 35 mm films produced for the Travel Bureau in 1940\u201342,<ref>''Beautiful British Columbia'', ''British Columbia Sports'' [aka ''Evergreen Playland''], and ''North of the Border''.</ref> intended for theatrical distribution to US audiences, he hired experienced  crew members from Hollywood, including cinematographer Ray Fernstrom, narrator Gayne Whitman, and editor Ed Taylor.\n\nThe regular staff working at Vancouver Motion Pictures included many people who would play important roles in the development of a the Canadian film and television industry. They included directors Oscar C. Burritt, Lew M. Parry, and Ed Taylor; cinematographers Oscar C. Burritt, Wally Hamilton, Ernie Kirkpatrick, Don Lytle, and Mel Parry; editors Maureen Balfe and Hellen Semmens; and titling artist/art director/animator Marguerite Roozeboom (n\u00e9e Goulding).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1942\u201343, VMP began filming BC sequences for the National Film Board of Canada, which used the material in films for its propaganda series ''Canada Carries On'' and ''World In Action''.<ref name=\":0\" /> In spring 1943, a film industry trade journal reported that the company \"working full blast these days in commercial and government work.\"<ref>''Canadian Moving Picture Digest'', March 20, 1943, p. 8.</ref> By 1946, Shelly had made half a dozen complete documentaries for the NFB.

Much of the VMP staff went east  to work there. However, Lew Parry stayed in Vancouver and started his own production company, eventually becoming BC's most prolific filmmaker.
