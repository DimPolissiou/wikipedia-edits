It is bounded on the northwest by the [[Jangladesh]] region, on the northeast by [[Haryana]], on the east by [[Mewat]], on the southeast by [[Dhundhar]], on the south by [[Ajmer region|Ajmer]], and on the southwest by the [[Marwar]] region.

Steeped in wealth and affluence, these merchants got busy outdoing others in building more grand edifices \u2013 homes, temples, step wells which were richly decorated both inside and outside with painted murals.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/people/Art-through-the-lens-Havelis-of-Shekhawati/articleshow/25592970.cms Aditya Mukherjee, \"Art through the lens: Havelis of Shekhawati\", ''The Times of India'' (Nov 12, 2013)]</ref>\n\n==Etymology of Shekhawati==\nShekhawati was first mentioned in the book ''Bankidas ki Khyat''.<ref>Mukutji: Jaipur rajya ka bhugol, page 46-47</ref> Contemporary of Bankidas was Colonel W.S. Gardener, who used the word ''Shekhawati'' in 1803. Later [[James Tod]] wrote the first history of Shekhawati. The term ''Shekhawati'' was used frequently in ''Vamsh Bhaskar''. This suggests that the term came in use about two and half centuries ago.<ref name=\"Sahiram 1952\">Sahiram: Ek adh\u016br\u012b kr\u0101nti, Shekhawati k\u0101 kis\u0101n \u0101ndolan (1922-1952), page-1</ref> Shekhawati is named after Rao Shekha.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Shekhawatiregion.jpg|thumb|200px|Shekhawati region of Rajasthan (in blue)]]\n\nShekhawati is in the [[Thar Desert]] of Rajasthan and has special importance in the history of India.\n\nThe climate of the desert region is harsh and extreme. The temperature ranges from below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in winter to more than {{convert|50|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in summer. The summer brings hot waves of air called ''loo''. Annual rainfall is at around 450 to 600&nbsp; mm. The [[groundwater]] is as deep as 200 feet (60 m), and in some places, the groundwater is [[Hard water|hard]] and salty. The people in the region depend on [[rainwater harvesting]]. The harvested rainwater from the monsoon season (during July and August) is stored in [[Indian vernacular architecture#Pukka|pucca]] tanks and used throughout the year for drinking purposes.<ref name=\"Busquet\">Busquet, Carisse and Gerard ''Impressions of Rajasthan'' 2003, Editions Flammarion, {{ISBN|2-08-011171-X}}</ref>\n\n== Shekhawati dialect ==\nShekhawati is a [[dialect]] of the [[Rajasthani language]] and is spoken by about three million speakers in the [[Churu district|Churu]], [[Jhunjhunu]], and [[Sikar]] districts of Rajasthan. Even though it is a very important dialect from the grammatical and literary points of view, very little work is carried out on it. In 2001 a descriptive compendium of the grammar of Shekhawati was published.<ref>Lakhan Gusain. Shekhawati. Munich: Lincom Europa (2001) (LW/M 385)</ref> Shekhawati, like the Bagri dialect of Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts, has a parallel lexicon which makes it very rich from the lexicographical point of view.\n[[Word order]] is typically [[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb|SOV]] and there is an existence of [[implosives]]. The presence of high tone at [[suprasegmental]] level classifies it with other [[dialects of Rajasthani]]. It has contributed a lot to the development of Rajasthani language and [[linguistics]].\n\nSome samples in Shekhawati are:\n* Kai Hoyo? \u0915\u0948 \u0939\u094b\u092f\u094b? = What happened?\n* The Kai kar rieya ho? \u0925\u0947  \u0915\u0948 \u0915\u0930 \u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e  \u0939\u094b?= What are you doing?\n* Ma Thane ghano samman desyu. \u092e\u0948\u0902  \u0925\u093e\u0928\u0947  \u0918\u0923\u094b  \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928  \u0926\u0947\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0941   = I will give you great respect.\n* The sidh ja riya ho? \u0925\u0947 \u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927  \u091c\u093e  \u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e  \u0939\u094b?= Where are you going?\n* The ke kha rahiya ho? \u0925\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0916\u093e \u0930\u0939\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0939\u094b? = What are you eating?\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{main|Matsya Kingdom}}\nMany historians have considered this region included in the [[Matsya Kingdom]].

Out of 16 [[mahajanapada]]s prior to [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], only two Janapadas, namely [[Avanti (India)|Avanti]] and the Kingdom of [[Virata]] were counted in Rajasthan area. This region was also influenced by Avanti but later on [[Nanda dynasty|Nanda]]s of [[Magadha]] defeated Avanti. Historians believe that [[Maurya]]s obtained the Rajasthan from [[Nanda dynasty|Nanda]]s.<ref>Prithvi Singh Mehta: Hamara Rajasthan (1950), pages 30-31</ref>\n\nIn ancient times Shekhawati was not limited to the present two districts.  During the Mahabharata period, it was known as [[Matsya Kingdom]] and extended to the [[Sarasvati River]]. This was because the first clan ruling this region, in the Mahabharata period, were descendants of fishermen. So the [[Veda]]s were supposed to be written and compiled on this very land.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Sahiram: Ek adh\u016br\u012b kr\u0101nti, Shekhawati k\u0101 kis\u0101n \u0101ndolan (1922-1952), page-2</ref><ref>Satapatha Brahman 13/5/9</ref> During ancient times this region was divided into several [[janapada]]s.

According to Vimal Charanlal, this Kingdom of [[Virata]] extended from [[Jhunjhunu]] to Kotkasim 109&nbsp;km in the north, Jhunjhunu to Ajmer 184&nbsp;km in the west, Ajmer to Banas and up to the confluence of Chambal River 229&nbsp;km in the south. The capital of this Kingdom of [[Virata]] was [[Bairat]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>[[G H Ojha]]: Rajputane ka Itihasa (Part I), page 86</ref>\n\nAfter the collapse of [[Gupta dynasty]], Shekhawati's some parts like [[Jhunjhunu]], [[Fatehpur, Shekhawati|Fatehpur]], [[Narhar]] were controlled by the [[Kaimkhani]]s, until they were defeated by Shekhawat Rajputs. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n[[Kaimkhani]] is a branch emerged from [[Chauhan]]s. The first progenitor of Kaimkhanis was Karamchand, born in the family of Moterao of Chauhan clan, the ruler of [[Dadrewa]]. [[Firuz Shah Tughluq]] converted him to Islam and named him Kaimkhan. Thus his descendants were called Kaimkhani. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Shekhawat rule===\n[[File:Bawdi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Bawdi in Fatehpur.

He was the first independent ruler. After him, Rao Raimal, Rao Suja, and Rao Lunkaran become the rulers of Amarsar. Rao Manohar succeeded his father Rao Lunkaran and founded Manoharpur later renamed [[Shahpura, Jaipur District|Shahpura]] (The present ruler of Shahpura is the Tikai of Shekhawat subclan).

It is bounded on the northwest by the [[Jangladesh]] region, on the northeast by [[Haryana]], on the east by [[Mewat]], on the southeast by [[Dhundhar]], on the south by [[Ajmer region|Ajmer]], and on the southwest by the [[Marwar]] region.

Steeped in wealth and affluence, these merchants got busy outdoing others in building more grand edifices \u2013 homes, temples, step wells which were richly decorated both inside and outside with painted murals.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/people/Art-through-the-lens-Havelis-of-Shekhawati/articleshow/25592970.cms Aditya Mukherjee, \"Art through the lens: Havelis of Shekhawati\", ''The Times of India'' (Nov 12, 2013)]</ref>\n\n==Etymology of Shekhawati==\nShekhawati was first mentioned in the book ''Bankidas ki Khyat''.<ref>Mukutji: Jaipur rajya ka bhugol, page 46-47</ref> Contemporary of Bankidas was Colonel W.S. Gardener, who used the word ''Shekhawati'' in 1803. Later [[James Tod]] wrote the first history of Shekhawati. The term ''Shekhawati'' was used frequently in ''Vamsh Bhaskar''. This suggests that the term came in use about two and half centuries ago.<ref name=\"Sahiram 1952\">Sahiram: Ek adh\u016br\u012b kr\u0101nti, Shekhawati k\u0101 kis\u0101n \u0101ndolan (1922-1952), page-1</ref> Shekhawati is named after Rao Shekha.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Shekhawatiregion.jpg|thumb|200px|Shekhawati region of Rajasthan (in blue)]]\n\nShekhawati is in the [[Thar Desert]] of Rajasthan and has special importance in the history of India.\n\nThe climate of the desert region is harsh and extreme. The temperature ranges from below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in winter to more than {{convert|50|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in summer. The summer brings hot waves of air called ''loo''. Annual rainfall is at around 450 to 600&nbsp; mm. The [[groundwater]] is as deep as 200 feet (60 m), and in some places, the groundwater is [[Hard water|hard]] and salty. The people in the region depend on [[rainwater harvesting]]. The harvested rainwater from the monsoon season (during July and August) is stored in [[Indian vernacular architecture#Pukka|pucca]] tanks and used throughout the year for drinking purposes.<ref name=\"Busquet\">Busquet, Carisse and Gerard ''Impressions of Rajasthan'' 2003, Editions Flammarion, {{ISBN|2-08-011171-X}}</ref>\n\n== Shekhawati dialect ==\nShekhawati is a [[dialect]] of the [[Rajasthani language]] and is spoken by about three million speakers in the [[Churu]], [[Jhunjhunu]], and [[Sikar]] districts of Rajasthan. Even though it is a very important dialect from the grammatical and literary points of view, very little work is carried out on it. In 2001 a descriptive compendium of the grammar of Shekhawati was published.<ref>Lakhan Gusain. Shekhawati. Munich: Lincom Europa (2001) (LW/M 385)</ref> Shekhawati, like the Bagri dialect of Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts, has a parallel lexicon which makes it very rich from the lexicographical point of view.\n[[Word order]] is typically [[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb|SOV]] and there is an existence of [[implosives]]. The presence of high tone at [[suprasegmental]] level classifies it with other [[dialects of Rajasthani]]. It has contributed a lot to the development of Rajasthani language and [[linguistics]].\n\nSome samples in Shekhawati are:\n* Kai Hoyo? \u0915\u0948 \u0939\u094b\u092f\u094b? = What happened?\n* The Kai kar rieya ho? \u0925\u0947  \u0915\u0948 \u0915\u0930 \u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e  \u0939\u094b?= What are you doing?\n* Ma Thane ghano samman desyu. \u092e\u0948\u0902  \u0925\u093e\u0928\u0947  \u0918\u0923\u094b  \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928  \u0926\u0947\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0941   = I will give you great respect.\n* The sidh ja riya ho? \u0925\u0947 \u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927  \u091c\u093e  \u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e  \u0939\u094b?= Where are you going?\n* The ke kha rahiya ho? \u0925\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0916\u093e \u0930\u0939\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0939\u094b? = What are you eating?\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{main|Matsya Kingdom}}\nMany historians have considered this region included in the [[Matsya Kingdom]].

Out of 16 [[mahajanapada]]s prior to [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], only two Janapadas, namely [[Avanti (India)|Avanti]] and the Kingdom of [[Virata]] were counted in Rajasthan area. This region was also influenced by Avanti but later on [[Nanda dynasty|Nanda]]s of [[Magadha]] defeated Avanti. Historians believe that [[Maurya]]s obtained the Rajasthan from [[Nanda dynasty|Nanda]]s.<ref>Prithvi Singh Mehta: Hamara Rajasthan (1950), pages 30-31</ref>\n\nIn ancient times Shekhawati was not limited to the present two districts.  During the Mahabharata period, it was known as [[Matsya Kingdom]] and extended to the [[Sarasvati River]]. This was because the first clan ruling this region, in the Mahabharata period, were descendants of fishermen. So the [[Veda]]s were supposed to be written and compiled on this very land.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Sahiram: Ek adh\u016br\u012b kr\u0101nti, Shekhawati k\u0101 kis\u0101n \u0101ndolan (1922-1952), page-2</ref><ref>Satapatha Brahman 13/5/9</ref> During ancient times this region was divided into several [[janapada]]s.

The first progenitor of Kaimkhanis was Karamchand, born in the family of Moterao of Chauhan clan, the ruler of [[Dadrewa]]. [[Firuz Shah Tughluq]] converted him to Islam and named him Kaimkhan.

It was released in November 2001 as the second single of their fourth album ''[[Bleed American]]''. It was a number-five hit on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 2002 and reached the top 50 in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The song was a breakthrough hit for Jimmy Eat World, who had self-financed the recording of the ''Bleed American'' album after having been dropped by [[Capitol Records]] in 1999.\n\n==Background and composition==\n\"The Middle\" was written after Jimmy Eat World had been dropped from [[Capitol Records]] after their previous album ''Clarity'' had been released. Their second album ''[[Static Prevails]]'' had sold just 10,000 copies in 1996 and Capitol Records decided to drop the band in 1999 due to a change in priorities. Singer/guitarist Jim Adkins explained to the ''[[Dallas Observer]]'': \"We were just about invisible there and it wasn't going to get any better.\"<ref name=DO>Jim Adkins interview with ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' replayed in ''Contemporary Musicians 2002'' Galenet</ref>\n\n\"The Middle\" reflects these trying times for the band with lyrics about \"Don't write yourself off yet\" when feeling \"left out or looked down on.\"<ref name=LY>[http://www.jimmy-eat-world.com/pages/lyrics/the-middle.php Lyrics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019121559/http://www.jimmy-eat-world.com/pages/lyrics/the-middle.php |date=October 19, 2008 }} at Jimmy Eat World's website</ref> The band decided to finance the recording of the album and decided to keep things simple on the new record rather than experiment, as they had done on previous records. \"On our new stuff, rather than challenging ourselves [by] getting real experimental, we kind of went in the other direction, challenging ourselves by getting very simple.\"<ref name=DO/>\n\nOnce completed, Jimmy Eat World took ''Bleed American'' to record companies and was signed to [[DreamWorks Records]]. ''Bleed American'' was released in the middle of 2001 with the title track as the lead single. However, following the [[September 11 attacks]] the album's title was changed to ''Jimmy Eat World'' and the lead single failed to win airplay, although it reached the top 20 of the ''Billboard'' Hot Modern Rock Tracks.\n\n==Release and reception==\nWhen \"The Middle\" was released, the success of the album and the band was dependent on the single breaking through. By early 2002, the song had reached the top of the ''Billboard'' [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.

It was released in November 2001 as the second single of their fourth album ''[[Bleed American]]''. It was a number-five hit on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 2002 and reached the top 50 in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The song was a breakthrough hit for Jimmy Eat World, who had self-financed the recording of the ''Bleed American'' album after having been dropped by [[Capitol Records]] in 1999.\n\n==Background and composition==\n\"The Middle\" was written after Jimmy Eat World had been dropped from [[Capitol Records]] after their previous album ''Clarity'' had been released. Their second album ''[[Static Prevails]]'' had sold just 10,000 copies in 1996 and Capitol Records decided to drop the band in 1999 due to a change in priorities. Singer/guitarist Jim Adkins explained to the ''[[Dallas Observer]]'': \"We were just about invisible there and it wasn't going to get any better.\"<ref name=DO>Jim Adkins interview with ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' replayed in ''Contemporary Musicians 2002'' Galenet</ref>\n\n\"The Middle\" reflects these trying times for the band with lyrics about \"Don't write yourself off yet\" when feeling \"left out or looked down on.\"<ref name=LY>[http://www.jimmy-eat-world.com/pages/lyrics/the-middle.php Lyrics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019121559/http://www.jimmy-eat-world.com/pages/lyrics/the-middle.php |date=October 19, 2008 }} at Jimmy Eat World's website</ref> The band decided to finance the recording of the album and decided to keep things simple on the new record rather than experiment, as they had done on previous records. \"On our new stuff, rather than challenging ourselves [by] getting real experimental, we kind of went in the other direction, challenging ourselves by getting very simple.\"<ref name=DO/>\n\nOnce completed, Jimmy Eat World took ''Bleed American'' to record companies and was signed to [[DreamWorks Records]]. ''Bleed American'' was released in the middle of 2001 with the title track as the lead single. However, following the [[September 11 attacks]] the album's title was changed to ''Jimmy Eat World'' and the lead single failed to win airplay, although it reached the top 20 of the ''Billboard'' Hot Modern Rock Tracks.\n\n==Release and reception==\nWhen \"The Middle\" was released, the success of the album and the band was dependent on the single breaking through. By early 2002, the song had reached the top of the ''Billboard'' [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. The song then crossed over to [[top 40]] radio, resulting in it reaching a peak of number five on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name=chart>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/bleed-american-r541537/charts-awards/billboard-single Bleed American - Jimmy Eat World].
