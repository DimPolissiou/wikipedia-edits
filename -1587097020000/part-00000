William and George, Jr. presented their findings to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in the U.S.  Their study and methods were considered a \"breakthrough\" in the new field of glaciology.

There is continuing photographic evidence to support their more scientific measurements. George Vaux, Jr.\u2019s grandson Henry Vaux, Jr., (also an alpine photographer) noted the static nature of the glacier's alpine area, related to its short growing seasons.  The only two major differences between contemporary times and the early 1900s are the retreat of the glacier and the presence of the Trans-Canada Highway.<ref name=Cooper/>  Thus, he saw trees that were observed by his grandfather from the same perspective, and there is little difference \"except for the glaciers, most of which are back at least two kilometres, and of man-made things.\"<ref name=Cooper/> <ref group=upper-alpha>There are also other organizations that have compiled photographic records.
