The [[comedy film|comedy]] centers on a [[high school]] populated by the [[Cloning|clones]] of famous historical figures. The show's central cast includes adolescent depictions of [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Joan of Arc]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[John F. Kennedy]], and [[Cleopatra]]. The series also serves as a parody of [[teen drama]]s such as [[Dawson's Creek]] and [[Beverly Hills, 90210]]; every episode is introduced as a \"[[very special episode]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=129 }}</ref>\n\nLord and Miller first developed the series' concept while at [[Dartmouth College]] in the 1990s, later pitching it to executives at American network [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], who ultimately decided to pass on the program. It was later purchased by [[cable television|cable]] channel [[MTV]], and was produced between 2002\u201303. The show's design is heavily stylized and its animation style limited, emphasizing humor and story over visuals. The ''Clone High'' theme song was written by [[Tommy Walter]] and performed by his [[alternative rock]] band [[Abandoned Pools]], who also provided much of the series' background music.\n\n''Clone High'' first aired in its entirety on Canadian cable network [[Teletoon]] between 2002 and 2003, later debuting on MTV. It became embroiled in a controversy regarding its depiction of Gandhi soon afterward, which prompted hundreds in [[India]] to mount a [[hunger strike]] in response. Shortly after, MTV pulled the series, which had been receiving low ratings. ''Clone High'' attracted mixed reviews from television critics upon its premiere, but it has since received critical acclaim and a [[cult following]].\n\n==Premise==\n''Clone High'' is set in a [[high school]] in the fictional town of Exclamation, USA, that is secretly being run as an elaborate military experiment orchestrated by a [[Federal government of the United States|government office]] called the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures. The school is entirely populated by the [[cloning|clones]] of famous historical figures that have been created and raised with the intent of having their various strengths and abilities harnessed by the [[United States military]]. The [[school principal|principal]] of the high school, Cinnamon J. Scudworth, has his own plans for the clones, and secretly tries to undermine the wishes of the Board (Scudworth wants to use the clones to create a clone-themed amusement park, dubbed \"Cloney Island\", a decidedly less evil intention than that of the Board). He is assisted by his [[robot]] butler/[[School principal|vice principal]]/[[dehumidifier]], Mr. Butlertron (a parody of ''[[Mr. Belvedere]]''), who is programmed to call everyone \"Wesley\" and speak in two distinct intonations.\n\nThe main protagonists of ''Clone High'' are the clones of [[Abraham Lincoln]] (referred to as \"Abe\"), [[Joan of Arc]], and [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Much of the plot of the show revolves around the attempts of Abe to woo the vain and promiscuous clone of [[Cleopatra]], while being oblivious to the fact that his friend Joan of Arc is attracted to him. Meanwhile, [[John F. Kennedy]]'s clone (referred to as \"JFK\"), a macho, narcissistic womanizer, is also attempting to win over Cleopatra and has a long-standing rivalry with Abe. Gandhi acts in many of the episodes as the comic relief. Also on a few occasions, the characters that we see learn most of \"Life's Lessons\" the hard way.\n\n===Themes and style===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Thegrassyknollclonehigh.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The [[Grassy Knoll]], a reference to the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|JFK assassination]] [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theory]] about a second shooter, dubbed \"[[Dealey Plaza#The \"grassy knoll\"|The Man on the Grassy Knoll]]\". Notice the flag at half mast and JFK leaning over the car.]] -->\nWhile the clones derive many character qualities from their ancestors,<ref name=\"Hal205\">Erickson, 2005. p.205</ref> much of the humor in the show comes from the large contrast between the personality of the clones and the actual values and legacy of the historical figures they are descended from. For instance, Gandhi is portrayed as a hyperactive jerk-with-a-heart-of-gold whose biggest dream is to be accepted by those around him, in contrast to his historical legacy of calm nonviolence. Abe Lincoln is similarly portrayed as weak and indecisive, completely lacking the resolve of the [[President of the United States|President]] whose DNA he shares. All of the clones are also given mis-matched [[foster parent]]s who have little in common with them. Gandhi's parents are a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] couple, while JFK is raised by a [[homosexuality|homosexual]], [[interracial couple]]; Joan's \"foster grandpa\" is an elderly blind musician similar to [[Ray Charles]] named Toots, a parody of the stereotypical [[wise old man]] role (and the [[magical negro]] role) found in many teen shows, and who begins many of his declarative sentences with the words, \"Now, I may be blind, but I can see...\" followed by a wise-sounding observation that has little or nothing to do with anything.\n\nThe show also includes humor based on the historical figures themselves. For example, the diner the clones frequent is called The Grassy Knoll, a reference to the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|JFK assassination]] [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theory]] about a second shooter, dubbed \"[[Grassy knoll|The Man on the Grassy Knoll]]\". Other references seen are the flag at The Grassy Knoll being permanently at [[half mast]] and the car on the roof of the diner containing the original JFK's body leaning over the edge. There are pictures of assassinations hanging on the walls of the restaurant, such as the famous [[:Image:The Assassination of President Lincoln - Currier and Ives.png|Currier and Ives print]] of the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln assassination]] (though this version is in color and considerably more graphic than the original print). The genetic ancestors of all of the five main clones died of similarly irregular causes: three assassinations, one execution and one suicide. Other historical figure-based humor includes offhand coincidental remarks to other students, such as Abe mentioning that the clone of [[Napoleon]] is so annoying because of \"[[Napoleon complex|some kind of complex]]\", or Gandhi telling [[Catherine the Great]] to \"[[Legends of Catherine the Great|get off her high horse]]\".\n\nThe show is also a [[parody]] of \"issue\" episodes of high-school themed comedies. Each episode is introduced as a \"[[very special episode]].\"<ref name=\"Hal205\"/> Episodes center on various social issues, including Gandhi being shunned by his school for having [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADD]] (because of misinformation about the disorder), parodying shows which tackle [[AIDS]] awareness (it even included a special guest celebrity who tries to educate the students). Other episodes tackle [[recreational drug use|drugs]] (smoking raisins), the environment, and underage drinking in a similarly ridiculous fashion. In a clear sign that it is parodying the high school genre, it even ends at [[prom]]: a stereotypical \"high school show\" ending. Even the prom is a joke however, as we learn it is only the Winter Prom.\n\nThere was a [[running gag]] that creators Phil Lord and Christopher Miller wanted to include in the show \"where Clone High \u2013 being an exaggeration of typical high schools in teen dramas \u2013 would have many proms throughout the year\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Planned proms included \"an Early Winter Prom, a Late Winter/Early Spring Prom, a Mid-Semester Prom, a Post-Prom Clean Up Prom, etc\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The only surviving references to this joke are the Homecoming Prom in episode 6, \"Homecoming: A Shot in D'Arc\", and the winter prom in episode 13, \"Changes: The Big Prom: The Sex Romp: The Season Finale\".<ref name=\"pundog6\">{{cite web | author=Pava, Adam | title=Episode Six: 'Homecoming: A Shot in the D'Arc' Notes | work=CloneHighUSA.com | url=http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/episode_notes/episode_six.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030427125949/http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/episode_notes/episode_six.html | archivedate=2003-04-27}}</ref> Another reference to the gag was deleted from episode 8, \"A Room of One's Clone: Pie of the Storm\".<ref name=\"pundog6\"/>\n\n==Characters==\n{{See also|List of Clone High characters}}\n[[File:Clone High Cast Promo.jpg|thumb|right|The main characters of ''Clone High'': Mr. Butlertron, John F.

He admires his clonefather Abraham Lincoln and feels that he is struggling to live up to him. He is in love with Cleopatra and has a very na\u00efve and awkward personality. Abe doesn't notice that Joan has feelings for him and unintentionally mistreats her by reinterpreting it as a sign of friendship. He later realizes his feelings for her too late.\n* '''Joan of Arc''' (voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]]) is a clone of [[Joan of Arc]] and Abe's closest friend and confidante. She is an intelligent, cynical and angsty goth. She loves Abe and hates how he ignores her in order to hook up with Cleopatra.

He, like Abe, is struggling to live up to his clonefather Mahatma Gandhi. As a result, he reinvents himself as a wild party animal who tries to become popular by being outrageous and practicing finger snaps. In the end he begins a relationship with Marie Curie\n* '''JFK''' (voiced by [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller|Chris Miller]]) is a clone of [[John F. Kennedy]] and a handsome, popular, arrogant, and horny jock as well as Abe's on-and-off rival for Cleo's affections. He later develops feelings for Joan and hates how Abe treats her.\n* '''Cleopatra Smith''' (voiced by [[Christa Miller]]) is a clone of [[Cleopatra|Cleopatra VII]] as well as Abe's love interest and later girlfriend. She is a self-absorbed, vain, and often mean-spirited popular cheerleader who is the object of desire for every male in the school, most notably Abe and JFK. She is also known to live with Joan of Arc due to Cleopatra's mum and Joan's grandfathers relationship\n* '''Principal Scudworth''' ('''Dr. Cinnamon J. Scudworth''') (voiced by [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller|Phil Lord]]) is the literally \"[[wiktionary:mad|mad]]\" scientist and principal of Clone High, who secretly plans to use the clones as attractions for his hypothetical amusement park, dubbed \"Cloney Island,\" and many of the series' subplots surround him trying to find ways to accelerate his plans. He also hates John Stamos. In his spare time he makes little pirate hats from newspapers, which he collects in a drawer on his desk.\n* '''Mr. Lynn Butlertron''' (voiced by Chris Miller) is Scudworth's [[Mr. Belvedere]]-esque sane robotic butler and reluctant sidekick in his stupid schemes.

The production was overseen by [[ABC Studios#Touchstone Television|Touchstone Television]]. It was originally pitched to the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], who purchased the show immediately but ultimately decided not to order it to series.

The character designs were all done by Carey Yost, known for his work on ''Dexter's Laboratory'', ''Samurai Jack'', ''The Powerpuff Girls'', ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'', and ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]''. The characters and backgrounds were [[traditional animation|traditionally drawn]], and frames and cels were frequently recycled. Co-creator Chris Miller explained, \"We like the snappy pose-to-pose animation, more for reasons of comic timing than anything else. Things that aren't expected are funnier: If an anvil's going to fall on your head, it had better not take more than three seconds. That's why we like the quick pose-to-pose stuff. For scenes with more emotional content, the characters move a little slower and more fluidly\". Phil Lord added, \"But we never want the viewer to be paying attention to the animation, because it's there to serve the jokes and the story. We strip out extraneous movements, because we don't want to draw your eye to anything that's not part of a joke.\" Gandhi is the most animated character on the show; he requires twice as many story-board poses as any other character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/funfacts/fun_facts.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602070504/http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/funfacts/fun_facts.html|archivedate=2008-06-02|title=Clone High Fun Facts|accessdate=2011-07-28}}</ref>\n\nThe series was produced by [[Bill Lawrence (TV producer)|Bill Lawrence]], who also produced ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', ''[[Spin City]]'' and ''[[Cougar Town]]''. Many ''Scrubs'' alumni, such as [[Zach Braff]], [[Donald Faison]], [[Sarah Chalke]], [[John C.

There is an image of a [[dolphin]] hidden in almost every episode. The use of dolphins (sounds or images) would be later featured in Lord and Miller's later work. In the episode \"Raisin the Stakes\", there were numerous hidden messages, which appeared to be a parody of [[subliminal messaging]].\n\n==Controversy and cancellation==\nAn article in ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' Magazine depicting [[Mahatma Gandhi]] being beaten up by a muscular man sparked outrage in India.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web |author=\"\" |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlhFghZ1gM |title=Clone High NEW Behind the Scenes Discussion |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2010-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914092820/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlhFghZ1gM |archive-date=2011-09-14 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Clone High'' was caught in a crossfire when citizens in the country conducted internet searches on the Maxim article but also found out about the show's Gandhi character on MTV's website.

The [[comedy film|comedy]] centers on a [[high school]] populated by the [[Cloning|clones]] of famous historical figures. The show's central cast includes adolescent depictions of [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Joan of Arc]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[John F. Kennedy]], and [[Cleopatra]]. The series also serves as a parody of [[teen drama]]s; every episode is introduced as a \"[[very special episode]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=129 }}</ref>\n\nLord and Miller first developed the series' concept while at [[Dartmouth College]] in the 1990s, later pitching it to executives at American network [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], who ultimately decided to pass on the program. It was later purchased by [[cable television|cable]] channel [[MTV]], and was produced between 2002\u201303. The show's design is heavily stylized and its animation style limited, emphasizing humor and story over visuals. The ''Clone High'' theme song was written by [[Tommy Walter]] and performed by his [[alternative rock]] band [[Abandoned Pools]], who also provided much of the series' background music.\n\n''Clone High'' first aired in its entirety on Canadian cable network [[Teletoon]] between 2002 and 2003, later debuting on MTV. It became embroiled in a controversy regarding its depiction of Gandhi soon afterward, which prompted hundreds in [[India]] to mount a [[hunger strike]] in response. Shortly after, MTV pulled the series, which had been receiving low ratings. ''Clone High'' attracted mixed reviews from television critics upon its premiere, but it has since received critical acclaim and a [[cult following]].\n\n==Premise==\n''Clone High'' is set in a [[high school]] in the fictional town of Exclamation, USA, that is secretly being run as an elaborate military experiment orchestrated by a [[Federal government of the United States|government office]] called the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures. The school is entirely populated by the [[cloning|clones]] of famous historical figures that have been created and raised with the intent of having their various strengths and abilities harnessed by the [[United States military]]. The [[school principal|principal]] of the high school, Cinnamon J. Scudworth, has his own plans for the clones, and secretly tries to undermine the wishes of the Board (Scudworth wants to use the clones to create a clone-themed amusement park, dubbed \"Cloney Island\", a decidedly less evil intention than that of the Board). He is assisted by his [[robot]] butler/[[School principal|vice principal]]/[[dehumidifier]], Mr. Butlertron (a parody of ''[[Mr. Belvedere]]''), who is programmed to call everyone \"Wesley\" and speak in two distinct intonations.\n\nThe main protagonists of ''Clone High'' are the clones of [[Abraham Lincoln]] (referred to as \"Abe\"), [[Joan of Arc]], and [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Much of the plot of the show revolves around the attempts of Abe to woo the vain and promiscuous clone of [[Cleopatra]], while being oblivious to the fact that his friend Joan of Arc is attracted to him. Meanwhile, [[John F. Kennedy]]'s clone (referred to as \"JFK\"), a macho, narcissistic womanizer, is also attempting to win over Cleopatra and has a long-standing rivalry with Abe. Gandhi acts in many of the episodes as the comic relief. Also on a few occasions, the characters that we see learn most of \"Life's Lessons\" the hard way.\n\n===Themes and style===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Thegrassyknollclonehigh.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The [[Grassy Knoll]], a reference to the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|JFK assassination]] [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theory]] about a second shooter, dubbed \"[[Dealey Plaza#The \"grassy knoll\"|The Man on the Grassy Knoll]]\". Notice the flag at half mast and JFK leaning over the car.]] -->\nWhile the clones derive many character qualities from their ancestors,<ref name=\"Hal205\">Erickson, 2005. p.205</ref> much of the humor in the show comes from the large contrast between the personality of the clones and the actual values and legacy of the historical figures they are descended from. For instance, Gandhi is portrayed as a hyperactive jerk-with-a-heart-of-gold whose biggest dream is to be accepted by those around him, in contrast to his historical legacy of calm nonviolence. Abe Lincoln is similarly portrayed as weak and indecisive, completely lacking the resolve of the [[President of the United States|President]] whose DNA he shares. All of the clones are also given mis-matched [[foster parent]]s who have little in common with them. Gandhi's parents are a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] couple, while JFK is raised by a [[homosexuality|homosexual]], [[interracial couple]]; Joan's \"foster grandpa\" is an elderly blind musician similar to [[Ray Charles]] named Toots, a parody of the stereotypical [[wise old man]] role (and the [[magical negro]] role) found in many teen shows, and who begins many of his declarative sentences with the words, \"Now, I may be blind, but I can see...\" followed by a wise-sounding observation that has little or nothing to do with anything.\n\nThe show also includes humor based on the historical figures themselves. For example, the diner the clones frequent is called The Grassy Knoll, a reference to the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|JFK assassination]] [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theory]] about a second shooter, dubbed \"[[Grassy knoll|The Man on the Grassy Knoll]]\". Other references seen are the flag at The Grassy Knoll being permanently at [[half mast]] and the car on the roof of the diner containing the original JFK's body leaning over the edge. There are pictures of assassinations hanging on the walls of the restaurant, such as the famous [[:Image:The Assassination of President Lincoln - Currier and Ives.png|Currier and Ives print]] of the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln assassination]] (though this version is in color and considerably more graphic than the original print). The genetic ancestors of all of the five main clones died of similarly irregular causes: three assassinations, one execution and one suicide. Other historical figure-based humor includes offhand coincidental remarks to other students, such as Abe mentioning that the clone of [[Napoleon]] is so annoying because of \"[[Napoleon complex|some kind of complex]]\", or Gandhi telling [[Catherine the Great]] to \"[[Legends of Catherine the Great|get off her high horse]]\".\n\nThe show is also a [[parody]] of \"issue\" episodes of high-school themed comedies. Each episode is introduced as a \"[[very special episode]].\"<ref name=\"Hal205\"/> Episodes center on various social issues, including Gandhi being shunned by his school for having [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADD]] (because of misinformation about the disorder), parodying shows which tackle [[AIDS]] awareness (it even included a special guest celebrity who tries to educate the students).

Kennedy, Cleopatra, Abe Lincoln, Joan of Arc, Gandhi and \"Cinnamon\" J. Scudworth (reclining).]]\n* '''Abe Lincoln''' (voiced by [[Will Forte]]) is a clone of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the main [[protagonist]]. He admires his clonefather Abraham Lincoln and feels that he is struggling to live up to him. He is in love with Cleopatra and has a very na\u00efve and awkward personality. Abe doesn't notice that Joan has feelings for him and unintentionally mistreats her by reinterpreting it as a sign of friendship. He later realizes his feelings for her too late.\n* '''Joan of Arc''' (voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]]) is a clone of [[Joan of Arc]] and Abe's closest friend and confidante. She is an intelligent, cynical and angsty goth. She loves Abe and hates how he ignores her in order to hook up with Cleopatra. She holds liberal political views, and \"somewhat naively support[s] every special-interest cause.\"<ref name=\"Hal205\"/> In the Season Finale, realizing that JFK loves her for herself, Joan begins a relationship with him.\n* '''Gandhi''' (voiced by [[Michael McDonald (comedian)|Michael McDonald]]) is a clone of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and Abe's other best friend. He, like Abe, is struggling to live up to his clonefather Mahatma Gandhi. As a result, he reinvents himself as a wild party animal who tries to become popular by being outrageous and practicing finger snaps. In the end he begins a relationship with Marie Curie\n* '''JFK''' (voiced by [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller|Chris Miller]]) is a clone of [[John F. Kennedy]] and a handsome, popular, arrogant, and horny jock as well as Abe's on-and-off rival for Cleo's affections. He later develops feelings for Joan and hates how Abe treats her.\n* '''Cleopatra Smith''' (voiced by [[Christa Miller]]) is a clone of [[Cleopatra|Cleopatra VII]] as well as Abe's love interest and later girlfriend. She is a self-absorbed, vain, and often mean-spirited popular cheerleader who is the object of desire for every male in the school, most notably Abe and JFK. She is also known to live with Joan of Arc due to Cleopatra's mum and Joan's grandfathers relationship\n* '''Principal Scudworth''' ('''Dr. Cinnamon J. Scudworth''') (voiced by [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller|Phil Lord]]) is the literally \"[[wiktionary:mad|mad]]\" scientist and principal of Clone High, who secretly plans to use the clones as attractions for his hypothetical amusement park, dubbed \"Cloney Island,\" and many of the series' subplots surround him trying to find ways to accelerate his plans. He also hates John Stamos. In his spare time he makes little pirate hats from newspapers, which he collects in a drawer on his desk.\n* '''Mr. Lynn Butlertron''' (voiced by Chris Miller) is Scudworth's [[Mr. Belvedere]]-esque sane robotic butler and reluctant sidekick in his stupid schemes. He refers to everyone as \"Wesley\".\n*Phil Lord as [[Genghis Khan]]\n*[[Nicole Sullivan]] as [[Marie Curie]]\n*[[Donald Faison]] as Toots, Wally, X-Stream Bob, [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]] and [[George Washington Carver]]\n*[[Neil Flynn]] as [[Julius Caesar]], [[Buddy Holly]], Carl, and [[Moses]], Krabby Kakes, Glenn [[Janitor (Scrubs)|The Janitor]]\n*[[Andy Dick]] as Mr. Sheepman, Police Officer and [[Vincent van Gogh]]\n*[[Murray Miller]] as [[Catherine the Great]]\n*[[Judah Miller]] as Scangrade\n*[[Debra Wilson]] as [[Harriet Tubman]], [[Eva Per\u00f3n]], Skunky-Poo, Reporter\n*[[Sarah Chalke]] as X-Stream Erin, [[Marie Antoinette]]\n*[[Zach Braff]] as X-Stream Mike, [[Paul Revere]]\n*[[Joe Flaherty]] as Abe's Foster Dad\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Phil_Lord_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Chris_Miller_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The show was created by [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller]], seen here at [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] in 2013.\n}}\nMiller initially developed the show's premise while in college, initially imagining the clones would be at a university rather than high school.<ref name=\"grantland\"/> The series was originally developed in 2000 under the title ''Clone High School, USA!''. The production was overseen by [[ABC Studios#Touchstone Television|Touchstone Television]]. It was originally pitched to the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], who purchased the show immediately but ultimately decided not to order it to series. Miller deemed it the \"easiest pitch ever,\" considering the show's use of famous figures.<ref name=\"grantland\"/> Following Fox's rejection, MTV purchased the program in May 2001.<ref>{{cite news|title=MTV set to attend 'Clone High'|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 3, 2001|author=Cynthia Littleton}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clonehighusa.com/backstage/episode_notes/episode_seven.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040215201829/http://clonehighusa.com/backstage/episode_notes/episode_seven.html|archivedate=2004-02-15|website=CloneHighUSA.com|date=2004-02-25|accessdate=2011-07-12}}</ref> All the original character designs were much different from what they would become even though the characters kept the same physical attributes and appearance.

The character designs were all done by Carey Yost, known for his work on ''Dexter's Laboratory'', ''Samurai Jack'', ''The Powerpuff Girls'', ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'', and ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]''. The characters and backgrounds were [[traditional animation|traditionally drawn]], and frames and cels were frequently recycled. Co-creator Chris Miller explained, \"We like the snappy pose-to-pose animation, more for reasons of comic timing than anything else. Things that aren't expected are funnier: If an anvil's going to fall on your head, it had better not take more than three seconds. That's why we like the quick pose-to-pose stuff. For scenes with more emotional content, the characters move a little slower and more fluidly\". Phil Lord added, \"But we never want the viewer to be paying attention to the animation, because it's there to serve the jokes and the story. We strip out extraneous movements, because we don't want to draw your eye to anything that's not part of a joke.\" Gandhi is the most animated character on the show; he requires twice as many story-board poses as any other character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/funfacts/fun_facts.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602070504/http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/funfacts/fun_facts.html|archivedate=2008-06-02|title=Clone High Fun Facts|accessdate=2011-07-28}}</ref>\n\nThe series was produced by [[Bill Lawrence (TV producer)|Bill Lawrence]], who also produced ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', ''[[Spin City]]'' and ''[[Cougar Town]]''. Many ''Scrubs'' alumni, such as [[Zach Braff]], [[Donald Faison]], [[Sarah Chalke]], [[John C. McGinley]], [[Neil Flynn]], and [[Christa Miller]], provided the voices of characters in ''Clone High''.\n\n''Clone High'' was notable for subtle jokes hidden in the animation. There is an image of a [[dolphin]] hidden in almost every episode. The use of dolphins (sounds or images) would be later featured in Lord and Miller's later work. In the episode \"Raisin the Stakes\", there were numerous hidden messages, which appeared to be a parody of [[subliminal messaging]].\n\n==Controversy and cancellation==\nAn article in ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' Magazine depicting [[Mahatma Gandhi]] being beaten up by a muscular man sparked outrage in India.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web |author=\"\" |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlhFghZ1gM |title=Clone High NEW Behind the Scenes Discussion |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2010-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914092820/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlhFghZ1gM |archive-date=2011-09-14 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Clone High'' was caught in a crossfire when citizens in the country conducted internet searches on the Maxim article but also found out about the show's Gandhi character on MTV's website.

He states that all Orthodox Judaism, including Open Orthodoxy, fundamentally differs from [[Conservative Judaism]] in three areas. First, unlike Conservative Judaism,\n*Orthodox Jews believe that the [[Torah]] was given by God at [[Mount Sinai]] in its current form. Second,\n*Orthodoxy believes that \"legal authority is cumulative, and that a contemporary ''[[posek]]'' [decider] can only issue judgments based on a full history of Jewish legal precedent\", whereas Conservative Jews believe \"precedent provides illustrations of possible positions rather than binding law. Conservatism, therefore, remains free to select whichever position within the prior history appeals to it\". Third,\n*Orthodoxy is characterized by ritually-observant members who \"meticulously keep [[Shabbat]] (the Sabbath), [[Kashrut]] (the Dietary Laws), [[Niddah|Taharat ha-Mishpaha]] (the Laws of Family Purity), and [[Jewish services|pray]] three times a day\", whereas Conservative Judaism \"is generally not composed of ritually observant Jews. Thus, only in our community if a 'permissive custom' is accepted, can it be meaningful.\"<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Open+orthodoxy!+A+modern+Orthodox+rabbi's+creed.-a020583577 | title =Open orthodoxy!

He states that all Orthodox Judaism, including Open Orthodoxy, fundamentally differs from [[Conservative Judaism]] in three areas. First, unlike Conservative Judaism,\n*Orthodox Jews believe that the [[Torah]] was given by God at [[Mount Sinai]] in its current form. Second,\n*Orthodoxy believes that \"legal authority is cumulative, and that a contemporary ''[[posek]]'' [decider] can only issue judgments based on a full history of Jewish legal precedent\", whereas Conservative Jews believe \"precedent provides illustrations of possible positions rather than binding law. Conservatism, therefore, remains free to select whichever position within the prior history appeals to it\". Third,\n*Orthodoxy is characterized by ritually-observant members who \"meticulously keep [[Shabbat]] (the Sabbath), [[Kashrut]] (the Dietary Laws), [[Niddah|Taharat ha-Mishpaha]] (the Laws of Family Purity), and [[Jewish services|pray]] three times a day\", whereas Conservative Judaism \"is generally not composed of ritually observant Jews. Thus, only in our community if a 'permissive custom' is accepted, can it be meaningful.\"<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Open+orthodoxy!+A+modern+Orthodox+rabbi's+creed.-a020583577 | title =Open orthodoxy!

As the iPhone SE has more powerful internal hardware than the midrange iPhone 6 (largely the same as the 6S) and had been released earlier on March 31, 2016, this created an unusual situation when it was sold alongside the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus until September 7 despite being marketed as a lower-tier iPhone.\n\nIn February 2017, the iPhone 6 was quietly relaunched in carrier stores and online, this time the storage has been changed to 32&nbsp;GB.

As the iPhone SE has more powerful internal hardware than the midrange iPhone 6 (largely the same as the 6S) and had been released earlier on March 31, 2016, this created an unusual situation when it was sold alongside the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus until September 7 despite being marketed as a lower-tier iPhone.\n\nIn February 2017, the iPhone 6 was quietly relaunched in carrier stores and online, this time the storage has been changed to 32&nbsp;GB. In India, it was sold on [[Amazon.com|Amazon's]] website in Space Grey. In Taiwan, it was sold through [[Taiwan Mobile]] on March 10 in gold color. In mid-March, it was released in the [[European Union|EU]] to Belarus via the i-Store webshop.

The most significant changes to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are its displays; both branded as \"[[Retina Display|Retina HD Display]]\" and \"ion-strengthened\", the iPhone 6 display is 4.7 inches in size with a [[16:9]] resolution of 1334x750 (326&nbsp;[[Pixels per inch|ppi]], minus one row of pixels), while the iPhone 6 Plus includes a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 ([[1080p]]) display (401&nbsp;PPI). The displays use a multiple-domain LCD panel, dubbed \"dual-domain pixels\"; the RGB pixels themselves are skewed in a pattern, so that every pixel is seen from a different angle.

Club]], on the episode \"Patriotic Motorcycle Heroes,\" described ''Street Fight'' as \"frank and consistently hilarious.\"{{sfn|Griffith|2016}} In February 2018, XFDR named ''Street Fight'' its podcast of the week, praising it as \"a different kind of leftist podcast\" in a market that was already \"oversaturated.\"{{sfn|Moon|2018|loc=para. 1}}\n\nAs of August 2019, the show's Patreon was the 220th most popular overall, and 9th in its category (Adult Video).{{sfn|Graphtreon|n.d.}} For the same month, ''Street Fight'' was ranked 416th in its category (News) by Apple Podcasts.{{sfn|Chartable|n.d.}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite web|ref=harv| last = Beer| first = Jeff| title = This new streaming service wants to be the anti-capitalist Netflix| work = [[Fast Company]]| accessdate = 2019-08-10| date = 2019-04-02| url = https://www.fastcompany.com/90327425/this-new-streaming-service-wants-to-be-the-anti-capitalist-netflix}}\n*{{Cite web|ref={{harvid|Chartable|n.d.}}|author=Chartable| title = Street Fight Radio - Rankings on Apple Podcasts : United States of America :| work = Chartable| accessdate = 2019-08-13| url = https://chartable.com/podcasts/street-fight-radio/charts}}\n*{{Cite web|ref=harv| last = Day| first = Meagan| title = \u201cYou Don\u2019t Have a Choice.
