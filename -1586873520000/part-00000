He hires Alan Hines ([[David Frankham]]), who then turns out to be an industrial spy by the name of Ronald Holms, to help with the experiment. As the experiment going on the right track, Ronald's true intention is beginning to be uncovered''.''\n\n==== Curse of the Fly ====\n{{Main|Curse of the Fly}}\nMartin Delambre ([[George Baker (actor)|George Baker]]) encounters a beautiful young girl, Patricia Stanley ([[Carole Gray]]), one night on his way to Montreal. The loving couple soon get married, but they are both keeping horrible secrets to each other: Patricia was actually escaping from an asylum the night they met; and Martin is secretly experimenting on a teleportation project which has already made considerable victims with his father, Henri Delambre ([[Brian Donlevy]]). With Patricia being traced down, secrets of the couple are facing the risk of getting revealed.\n\n=== The Remake Series (1986-1989) ===\n\n==== The Fly (1986 film) ====\n{{Main|The Fly (1986 film)}}\nScientist [[Seth Brundle (The Fly)|Seth Brundle]] ([[Jeff Goldblum]]), has successfully invented a teleportation device which can disintegrate matter in one \u201cTelepod\u201d and reintegrate it in another. Journalist Veronica \u201cRonnie\u201d ([[Geena Davis]]) agrees to document Seth's project, and the two become lovers. One night, Seth rashly decides to test the process on himself, but fails to notice a common housefly which has slipped into the transmitter pod with him. The computer becomes confused by the fly's presence, and merges it with Seth at the genetic level. Unaware of the accident, Seth initially believes that his newly-increased strength and energy are a result of the teleportation process purifying and improving his body, but his behavior soon becomes arrogant and violent. Veronica notices the disturbing changes in Seth's personality, whose body begins a prolonged and grotesque process of deteriorating into a human-insect hybrid creature, which Seth dubs \u201cBrundlefly\u201d. Ronnie and the diseased Seth must both cope with the effects of his transformation on their relationship, while Seth desperately searches for a cure before his humanity\u2014and his sanity\u2014completely drain away.\n\n==== The Fly II ====\n{{Main|The Fly II}}\nThe sequel continues the story, with Veronica Quaife dying in the process of giving birth to Seth Brundle's mutant son. The child, named Martin Brundle ([[Eric Stoltz]]), is adopted by Anton Bartok ([[Lee Richardson (actor)|Lee Richardson]]), the head of Bartok Industries and sponsor of Seth's experiment. Martin's unique heritage (which he is kept unaware of) results in his suffering from rapid aging, but also provides him with a photographic memory and no need for sleep. Physically a grown adult by his fifth birthday, Martin is given the task of repairing his father's Telepods by Bartok, and also falls in love with Bartok employee Beth Logan ([[Daphne Zuniga]]). However, Bartok has ulterior motives for his seeming kindness toward Martin: He intends to use to Telepods\u2019 ability to gene-splice for nefarious purposes, and has been aware from the start that Martin will eventually mutate into a human-fly hybrid creature. Martin and Beth must race against time to escape from Bartok and find a way to cure Martin before he suffers the same grotesque fate as his father.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n\n==== The Fly (1958 film) ====\nThe movie was based on the short story \"[[The Fly (Langelaan)|The Fly]]\" written by George Langelaan, which was published on [[Playboy magazine]] in 1957. According to Maury Dexter, an American producer who once worked with Robert Lippert, the novel was originally found and brought to the studio by Kurt Neuman.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://fiftieswesterns.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/highway-to-hollywood1.pdf|title=High Way to Hollywood|last=Dexter|first=Maury|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=99}}</ref> Although Robert Lippert was the one who brought the idea to 20th Century Fox and got its agreement on filming the movie, Fox replaced Lippert by Neuman as the producer afterwards due to Lippert's conflict with [[Screen Actors Guild]]. The Fly was then made in colour as a Fox Film.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/52548-THE-FLY?sid=277d5ff1-ed8d-4b6f-96db-711617339034&sr=1.01818&cp=2&pos=5|title=THE FLY (1958)|last=|first=|date=|website=American Film Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref> James Clavell was hired by Lippert for the adaption of the screenplay, and his work, based on what Harry Spalding has said, was \u201cthe best draft\u201d he has even seen.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe special effect of the human-fly hybrid was said to be created by covering the actor's head by a rubber sheath. To make the mask more alive, the original beaded domes as the eyes were made iridescent, and Hedison may wriggle his \u201cproboscis\u201d through a wooden plug held in his mouth.<ref name=\":6\" /> The budget was claimed to be $480,000 by Lippert, and $28,000 of which was spent on the construction of the laboratory set.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=A|first=Ryon|date=23 September 1962|title=Third-run film king tells industry's woes|url=|journal=Los Angeles Times|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> The film was released in July 1958 and became the biggest hit of Fox that year, grossing $3,000,000 in domestically. However, Kurt did not witness the huge success of his work as he died from a heart attack few weeks after the release of the film.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/75222/The-Fly/articles.html|title=The Fly (1958)|last=Smith|first=Richard Harland|date=|website=Turner Classic Movies|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Return of the Fly ====\nDue to the success of its preceding work, Return of the Fly was created double-billed with The Alligator people and was released in 1959. The idea of making this sequel was first brought out by Harry Spalding. He recalled the screenplay was not easy to start since the first movie \u201cwas a one-short deal, an accident\u201d which was \u201cnot like a Frankenstein Monster, someone you can revive\u201d. He then stated the budget of the movie was higher than the normal $125,000, yet it turned out to be profitable. According to Bernard Glasser, the producer of the movie, their budget was then increased to $275,000. The movie was asked to move from an independent shooting lot to the studio of Fox by its production department, which gave the crew more autonomy over the production . Glasser also complained about the slow production pace of Fox, claiming that most of the money were spent unproductively, which made Lippert \u201chave to obtain additional fund\u201d.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Return of the B science fiction and horror heroes|last=Weaver|first=Tom|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=|location=Jefferson|pages=115, 116}}</ref>\n\nBecause Ed Wolff, the Fly portrayer, had problem breathing wearing the Fly head, most of his action sequences were done by his stuntman, Joe Becker. The actor of the original \u201cFly\u201d, Vincent Price has also taken part in this sequel, being paid at $25,000. However, are Glasser recalled, he was \u201cnot overly enthusiastic about the screenplay\".<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Curse of the Fly ====\nWhen Lippert first mentioned the idea of making a third Fly, Spalding was surprised and <s>kind of</s> reluctant, saying they were \u201clucky to be able to do a second one\u201d. Having Claude Rains in his mind as the main character, Spalding completed the script. However, Lippert put Brian Donlevy in the role instead, since Donlevy has previously worked well in another horror movie, Creeping Unknown, and Lippert wanted to stick to what has worked before. Spalding also pointed out the difficulty of writing the screenplay in Los Angeles for a production located in England due to the lack of collaboration between him and the director as well as the rest of the crew.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== The Fly (1986 film) ====\nIn the early 1980s, producer Kip Ohman proposed to [[Charles Edward Pogue]] about the idea of remaking the classic sci-fi horror movie ''[[The Fly (1958 film)]]''. After reading the original novel by [[George Langelaan]] and watching The Fly made in 1958, Pogue was very interested in the remake plan, therefore he found [[Stuart Cornfeld]] to work with 20th Century Fox. Pogue's initial idea of the screenplay was very similar to Langelaan's original work, but he and Cornfeld then felt the focus should be put on the protagonist's mutating process, not the final result of the mutation. Unexpectedly, the film script did not impress Fox, and the shooting intentions immediately fell through. After multiple negotiations, Fox finally agreed to distribute the film, only if Cornfeld and his crew raise the fund themselves.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/68348|title=THE FLY (1986)|last=|first=|date=|website=American Film Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fourthreefilm.com/2016/08/the-fly-a-30-year-love-story/|title=The Fly: A 30-Year Love Story|last=Westwood|first=Emma|date=|website=4:3|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Stuart Cornfeld|Cornfeld]] found [[Mel Brooks]] to co-produce the film. The two had previously worked together in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]].'' When Brooks and Confield began looking for the suitable director, their first choice was [[David Cronenberg]]. However, [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] was busy with assisting [[Dino De Laurentiis|Dino de Laurentis]] to prepare for [[Total Recall (1990 film)|''Total Recall'']] at the moment. After watching several short films made by [[Robert Bierman]], Cornfeld decided to corporate with this young British director. However, when the pre-production of the film went on the right track, Bierman's daughter died in an accident. Brooks and Cornfeld waited for a month to let Bierman arrange the funeral and adjust his mood. But still, Bierman said that he could not resume his work in a short time. After three months, they had to cancel the contract.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2005|title=Fear of The Flesh: The Making of The Fly|url=|journal=20th Century Fox|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Knowing that [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] had given up [[Total Recall (1990 film)|''Total Recall'']], Cornfeld once again invited him. [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] then agreed to be the director, but only if he could personally rewrite the script. the screenplay written by Cronenberg was very different, but it still retained the original basic plot and the core concept of genetic variation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSince Cronenberg did not want to break the actions for the special effect, the optical effect department adopted the real-time motion control system to create a \"moving lock-off shot\". [[Hoyt Yeatman]], the optical effect supervisor of The Fly, described the technology in the following way:<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Magid|first=Ron|date=1986|title=More About The Fly|url=|journal=American Cinematographer|volume=67|issue=9|pages=69|via=}}</ref><blockquote>The shots were programmed by keyboard, and since they were working in real time, we didn't have to do move tests per se\u2026 \u2026 And once we got it down, then we'd do a number of takes with the object to be teleported in the booth. Then we would basically do nothing more than remove the object from the booth and redo the. Lights exactly as before: each time we had to change the globes and then we'd do another move. Then we'd use the motion control rig to repeat the shot exactly for the \"B\" side of the cut with the empty pod. At that point, we had two pieces of film with a common sync point - the first side being the \"A\" side containing the object, the second side or \"B\" side was the empty pod - and when you match those together in a synchroniser you can dissolve or pop between them and the move is exactly the same.<ref name=\":4\" /></blockquote>\n\n==== The Fly II ====\nAccording to a journal Hollywood Reporter in 1989, while filming the 1986 remake of The Fly, Stuart Cornfeld noticed Chris Walas, the person who later won the 1987 Academy Award for his work as special effects makeup. He then recommended Walas to be the director of the sequence and contributed to Walas\u2019 collaboration with Brooksfilms, the company that produced both movies of the remake series. The fly II therefore became the directorial debut of Walas. The shooting started in April 1988 and was done in Bridge Studios located in Vancouver, Canada, with a shooting schedule of 12 weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/58070-THE-FLY-II?sid=5950808f-6733-4ab6-b805-6b956caf54d7&sr=6.2678323&cp=1&pos=0|title=The Fly II|last=|first=|date=|website=American Film Institution|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Possible Reboot ====\nAccording to an interview in 2017 made by [[/Film]] with [[J.D. Dillard]], the director of the American drama film ''[[Sleight]],'' a plan of remaking David Cronenberg's ''The Fly'' was at its early phase of negotiations. Dillard disclosed in the interview that he might work with Alex Theurer, the co-writer of the Movie ''Sleight,'' for the remake movie: \"''For me \u2013 and this would be about The Fly, but this is also about Alex and my approach to remakes because post-Sleight that has been the conversation for what a lot of big flashy studio gigs are \u2013 no matter what, we want to start with character. \"'' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/j-d-dillards-the-fly-remake-pitch/|title=\u2018The Fly\u2019 Remake: J.D.

He hires Alan Hines ([[David Frankham]]), who then turns out to be an industrial spy by the name of Ronald Holms, to help with the experiment. As the experiment going on the right track, Ronald's true intention is beginning to be uncovered''.''\n\n==== Curse of the Fly ====\n{{Main|Curse of the Fly}}\nMartin Delambre ([[George Baker (actor)|George Baker]]) encounters a beautiful young girl, Patricia Stanley ([[Carole Gray]]), one night on his way to Montreal. The loving couple soon get married, but they are both keeping horrible secrets to each other: Patricia was actually escaping from an asylum the night they met; and Martin is secretly experimenting on a teleportation project which has already made considerable victims with his father, Henri Delambre ([[Brian Donlevy]]). With Patricia being traced down, secrets of the couple are facing the risk of getting revealed.\n\n=== The Remake Series (1986-1989) ===\n\n==== The Fly (1986 film) ====\n{{Main|The Fly (1986 film)}}\nScientist [[Seth Brundle (The Fly)|Seth Brundle]] ([[Jeff Goldblum]]), has successfully invented a teleportation device which can disintegrate matter in one \u201cTelepod\u201d and reintegrate it in another. Journalist Veronica \u201cRonnie\u201d ([[Geena Davis]]) agrees to document Seth's project, and the two become lovers. One night, Seth rashly decides to test the process on himself, but fails to notice a common housefly which has slipped into the transmitter pod with him. The computer becomes confused by the fly's presence, and merges it with Seth at the genetic level. Unaware of the accident, Seth initially believes that his newly-increased strength and energy are a result of the teleportation process purifying and improving his body, but his behavior soon becomes arrogant and violent. Veronica notices the disturbing changes in Seth's personality, whose body begins a prolonged and grotesque process of deteriorating into a human-insect hybrid creature, which Seth dubs \u201cBrundlefly\u201d. Ronnie and the diseased Seth must both cope with the effects of his transformation on their relationship, while Seth desperately searches for a cure before his humanity\u2014and his sanity\u2014completely drain away.\n\n==== The Fly II ====\n{{Main|The Fly II}}\nThe sequel continues the story, with Veronica Quaife dying in the process of giving birth to Seth Brundle's mutant son. The child, named Martin Brundle ([[Eric Stoltz]]), is adopted by Anton Bartok ([[Lee Richardson (actor)|Lee Richardson]]), the head of Bartok Industries and sponsor of Seth's experiment. Martin's unique heritage (which he is kept unaware of) results in his suffering from rapid aging, but also provides him with a photographic memory and no need for sleep. Physically a grown adult by his fifth birthday, Martin is given the task of repairing his father's Telepods by Bartok, and also falls in love with Bartok employee Beth Logan ([[Daphne Zuniga]]). However, Bartok has ulterior motives for his seeming kindness toward Martin: He intends to use to Telepods\u2019 ability to gene-splice for nefarious purposes, and has been aware from the start that Martin will eventually mutate into a human-fly hybrid creature. Martin and Beth must race against time to escape from Bartok and find a way to cure Martin before he suffers the same grotesque fate as his father.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n\n==== The Fly (1958 film) ====\nThe movie was based on the short story \"[[The Fly (Langelaan)|The Fly]]\" written by George Langelaan, which was published on [[Playboy magazine]] in 1957. According to Maury Dexter, an American producer who once worked with Robert Lippert, the novel was originally found and brought to the studio by Kurt Neuman.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://fiftieswesterns.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/highway-to-hollywood1.pdf|title=High Way to Hollywood|last=Dexter|first=Maury|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=99}}</ref> Although Robert Lippert was the one who brought the idea to 20th Century Fox and got its agreement on filming the movie, Fox replaced Lippert by Neuman as the producer afterwards due to Lippert's conflict with [[Screen Actors Guild]]. The Fly was then made in colour as a Fox Film.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/52548-THE-FLY?sid=277d5ff1-ed8d-4b6f-96db-711617339034&sr=1.01818&cp=2&pos=5|title=THE FLY (1958)|last=|first=|date=|website=American Film Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref> James Clavell was hired by Lippert for the adaption of the screenplay, and his work, based on what Harry Spalding has said, was \u201cthe best draft\u201d he has even seen.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe special effect of the human-fly hybrid was said to be created by covering the actor's head by a rubber sheath. To make the mask more alive, the original beaded domes as the eyes were made iridescent, and Hedison may wriggle his \u201cproboscis\u201d through a wooden plug held in his mouth.<ref name=\":6\" /> The budget was claimed to be $480,000 by Lippert, and $28,000 of which was spent on the construction of the laboratory set.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=A|first=Ryon|date=23 September 1962|title=Third-run film king tells industry's woes|url=|journal=Los Angeles Times|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> The film was released in July 1958 and became the biggest hit of Fox that year, grossing $3,000,000 in domestically. However, Kurt did not witness the huge success of his work as he died from a heart attack few weeks after the release of the film.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/75222/The-Fly/articles.html|title=The Fly (1958)|last=Smith|first=Richard Harland|date=|website=Turner Classic Movies|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Return of the Fly ====\nDue to the success of its preceding work, Return of the Fly was created double-billed with The Alligator people and was released in 1959. The idea of making this sequel was first brought out by Harry Spalding. He recalled the screenplay was not easy to start since the first movie \u201cwas a one-short deal, an accident\u201d which was \u201cnot like a Frankenstein Monster, someone you can revive\u201d. He then stated the budget of the movie was higher than the normal $125,000, yet it turned out to be profitable. According to Bernard Glasser, the producer of the movie, their budget was then increased to $275,000. The movie was asked to move from an independent shooting lot to the studio of Fox by its production department, which gave the crew more autonomy over the production . Glasser also complained about the slow production pace of Fox, claiming that most of the money were spent unproductively, which made Lippert \u201chave to obtain additional fund\u201d.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Return of the B science fiction and horror heroes|last=Weaver|first=Tom|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=|location=Jefferson|pages=115, 116}}</ref>\n\nBecause Ed Wolff, the Fly portrayer, had problem breathing wearing the Fly head, most of his action sequences were done by his stuntman, Joe Becker. The actor of the original \u201cFly\u201d, Vincent Price has also taken part in this sequel, being paid at $25,000. However, are Glasser recalled, he was \u201cnot overly enthusiastic about the screenplay\".<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Curse of the Fly ====\nWhen Lippert first mentioned the idea of making a third Fly, Spalding was surprised and <s>kind of</s> reluctant, saying they were \u201clucky to be able to do a second one\u201d. Having Claude Rains in his mind as the main character, Spalding completed the script. However, Lippert put Brian Donlevy in the role instead, since Donlevy has previously worked well in another horror movie, Creeping Unknown, and Lippert wanted to stick to what has worked before. Spalding also pointed out the difficulty of writing the screenplay in Los Angeles for a production located in England due to the lack of collaboration between him and the director as well as the rest of the crew.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== The Fly (1986 film) ====\nIn the early 1980s, producer Kip Ohman proposed to [[Charles Edward Pogue]] about the idea of remaking the classic sci-fi horror movie ''[[The Fly (1958 film)]]''. After reading the original novel by [[George Langelaan]] and watching The Fly made in 1958, Pogue was very interested in the remake plan, therefore he found [[Stuart Cornfeld]] to work with 20th Century Fox. Pogue's initial idea of the screenplay was very similar to Langelaan's original work, but he and Cornfeld then felt the focus should be put on the protagonist's mutating process, not the final result of the mutation. Unexpectedly, the film script did not impress Fox, and the shooting intentions immediately fell through. After multiple negotiations, Fox finally agreed to distribute the film, only if Cornfeld and his crew raise the fund themselves.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/68348|title=THE FLY (1986)|last=|first=|date=|website=American Film Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fourthreefilm.com/2016/08/the-fly-a-30-year-love-story/|title=The Fly: A 30-Year Love Story|last=Westwood|first=Emma|date=|website=4:3|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Stuart Cornfeld|Cornfeld]] found [[Mel Brooks]] to co-produce the film. The two had previously worked together in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]].'' When Brooks and Confield began looking for the suitable director, their first choice was [[David Cronenberg]]. However, [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] was busy with assisting [[Dino De Laurentiis|Dino de Laurentis]] to prepare for [[Total Recall (1990 film)|''Total Recall'']] at the moment. After watching several short films made by [[Robert Bierman]], Cornfeld decided to corporate with this young British director. However, when the pre-production of the film went on the right track, Bierman's daughter died in an accident. Brooks and Cornfeld waited for a month to let Bierman arrange the funeral and adjust his mood. But still, Bierman said that he could not resume his work in a short time. After three months, they had to cancel the contract.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2005|title=Fear of The Flesh: The Making of The Fly|url=|journal=20th Century Fox|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Knowing that [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] had given up [[Total Recall (1990 film)|''Total Recall'']], Cornfeld once again invited him. [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] then agreed to be the director, but only if he could personally rewrite the script. the screenplay written by Cronenberg was very different, but it still retained the original basic plot and the core concept of genetic variation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSince Cronenberg did not want to break the actions for the special effect, the optical effect department adopted the real-time motion control system to create a \"moving lock-off shot\". [[Hoyt Yeatman]], the optical effect supervisor of The Fly, described the technology in the following way:<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Magid|first=Ron|date=1986|title=More About The Fly|url=|journal=American Cinematographer|volume=67|issue=9|pages=69|via=}}</ref><blockquote>The shots were programmed by keyboard, and since they were working in real time, we didn't have to do move tests per se\u2026 \u2026 And once we got it down, then we'd do a number of takes with the object to be teleported in the booth. Then we would basically do nothing more than remove the object from the booth and redo the. Lights exactly as before: each time we had to change the globes and then we'd do another move. Then we'd use the motion control rig to repeat the shot exactly for the \"B\" side of the cut with the empty pod. At that point, we had two pieces of film with a common sync point - the first side being the \"A\" side containing the object, the second side or \"B\" side was the empty pod - and when you match those together in a synchroniser you can dissolve or pop between them and the move is exactly the same.<ref name=\":4\" /></blockquote>\n\n==== The Fly II ====\nAccording to a journal Hollywood Reporter in 1989, while filming the 1986 remake of The Fly, Stuart Cornfeld noticed Chris Walas, the person who later won the 1987 Academy Award for his work as special effects makeup. He then recommended Walas to be the director of the sequence and contributed to Walas\u2019 collaboration with Brooksfilms, the company that produced both movies of the remake series. The fly II therefore became the directorial debut of Walas. The shooting started in April 1988 and was done in Bridge Studios located in Vancouver, Canada, with a shooting schedule of 12 weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/58070-THE-FLY-II?sid=5950808f-6733-4ab6-b805-6b956caf54d7&sr=6.2678323&cp=1&pos=0|title=The Fly II|last=|first=|date=|website=American Film Institution|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Possible Reboot ====\nAccording to an interview in 2017 made by [[/Film]] with [[J.D.

He hires Alan Hines ([[David Frankham]]), who then turns out to be an industrial spy by the name of Ronald Holms, to help with the experiment. As the experiment going on the right track, Ronald's true intention is beginning to be uncovered''.''\n\n==== Curse of the Fly ====\n{{Main|Curse of the Fly}}\nMartin Delambre ([[George Baker (actor)|George Baker]]) encounters a beautiful young girl, Patricia Stanley ([[Carole Gray]]), one night on his way to Montreal. The loving couple soon get married, but they are both keeping horrible secrets to each other: Patricia was actually escaping from an asylum the night they met; and Martin is secretly experimenting on a teleportation project which has already made considerable victims with his father, Henri Delambre ([[Brian Donlevy]]). With Patricia being traced down, secrets of the couple are facing the risk of getting revealed.\n\n=== The Remake Series (1986-1989) ===\n\n==== The Fly (1986 film) ====\n{{Main|The Fly (1986 film)}}\nScientist [[Seth Brundle (The Fly)|Seth Brundle]] ([[Jeff Goldblum]]), has successfully invented a teleportation device which can disintegrate matter in one \u201cTelepod\u201d and reintegrate it in another. Journalist Veronica \u201cRonnie\u201d ([[Geena Davis]]) agrees to document Seth's project, and the two become lovers. One night, Seth rashly decides to test the process on himself, but fails to notice a common housefly which has slipped into the transmitter pod with him. The computer becomes confused by the fly's presence, and merges it with Seth at the genetic level. Unaware of the accident, Seth initially believes that his newly-increased strength and energy are a result of the teleportation process purifying and improving his body, but his behavior soon becomes arrogant and violent. Veronica notices the disturbing changes in Seth's personality, whose body begins a prolonged and grotesque process of deteriorating into a human-insect hybrid creature, which Seth dubs \u201cBrundlefly\u201d. Ronnie and the diseased Seth must both cope with the effects of his transformation on their relationship, while Seth desperately searches for a cure before his humanity\u2014and his sanity\u2014completely drain away.\n\n==== The Fly II ====\n{{Main|The Fly II}}\nThe sequel continues the story, with Veronica Quaife dying in the process of giving birth to Seth Brundle's mutant son. The child, named Martin Brundle ([[Eric Stoltz]]), is adopted by Anton Bartok ([[Lee Richardson (actor)|Lee Richardson]]), the head of Bartok Industries and sponsor of Seth's experiment. Martin's unique heritage (which he is kept unaware of) results in his suffering from rapid aging, but also provides him with a photographic memory and no need for sleep. Physically a grown adult by his fifth birthday, Martin is given the task of repairing his father's Telepods by Bartok, and also falls in love with Bartok employee Beth Logan ([[Daphne Zuniga]]). However, Bartok has ulterior motives for his seeming kindness toward Martin: He intends to use to Telepods\u2019 ability to gene-splice for nefarious purposes, and has been aware from the start that Martin will eventually mutate into a human-fly hybrid creature. Martin and Beth must race against time to escape from Bartok and find a way to cure Martin before he suffers the same grotesque fate as his father.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n\n==== The Fly (1958 film) ====\nThe movie was based on the short story \"[[The Fly (Langelaan)|The Fly]]\" written by George Langelaan, which was published on [[Playboy magazine]] in 1957. According to Maury Dexter, an American producer who once worked with Robert Lippert, the novel was originally found and brought to the studio by Kurt Neuman.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://fiftieswesterns.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/highway-to-hollywood1.pdf|title=High Way to Hollywood|last=Dexter|first=Maury|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=99}}</ref> Although Robert Lippert was the one who brought the idea to 20th Century Fox and got its agreement on filming the movie, Fox replaced Lippert by Neuman as the producer afterwards due to Lippert's conflict with [[Screen Actors Guild]]. The Fly was then made in colour as a Fox Film.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/52548-THE-FLY?sid=277d5ff1-ed8d-4b6f-96db-711617339034&sr=1.01818&cp=2&pos=5|title=THE FLY (1958)|last=|first=|date=|website=American Film Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref> James Clavell was hired by Lippert for the adaption of the screenplay, and his work, based on what Harry Spalding has said, was \u201cthe best draft\u201d he has even seen.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe special effect of the human-fly hybrid was said to be created by covering the actor's head by a rubber sheath.

However, Kurt did not witness the huge success of his work as he died from a heart attack few weeks after the release of the film.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/75222/The-Fly/articles.html|title=The Fly (1958)|last=Smith|first=Richard Harland|date=|website=Turner Classic Movies|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Return of the Fly ====\nDue to the success of its preceding work, Return of the Fly was created double-billed with The Alligator people and was released in 1959. The idea of making this sequel was first brought out by Harry Spalding. He recalled the screenplay was not easy to start since the first movie \u201cwas a one-short deal, an accident\u201d which was \u201cnot like a Frankenstein Monster, someone you can revive\u201d. He then stated the budget of the movie was higher than the normal $125,000, yet it turned out to be profitable. According to Bernard Glasser, the producer of the movie, their budget was then increased to $275,000. The movie was asked to move from an independent shooting lot to the studio of Fox by its production department, which gave the crew more autonomy over the production . Glasser also complained about the slow production pace of Fox, claiming that most of the money were spent unproductively, which made Lippert \u201chave to obtain additional fund\u201d.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Return of the B science fiction and horror heroes|last=Weaver|first=Tom|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=|location=Jefferson|pages=115, 116}}</ref>\n\nBecause Ed Wolff, the Fly portrayer, had problem breathing wearing the Fly head, most of his action sequences were done by his stuntman, Joe Becker. The actor of the original \u201cFly\u201d, Vincent Price has also taken part in this sequel, being paid at $25,000. However, are Glasser recalled, he was \u201cnot overly enthusiastic about the screenplay\".<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Curse of the Fly ====\nWhen Lippert first mentioned the idea of making a third Fly, Spalding was surprised and <s>kind of</s> reluctant, saying they were \u201clucky to be able to do a second one\u201d. Having Claude Rains in his mind as the main character, Spalding completed the script. However, Lippert put Brian Donlevy in the role instead, since Donlevy has previously worked well in another horror movie, Creeping Unknown, and Lippert wanted to stick to what has worked before. Spalding also pointed out the difficulty of writing the screenplay in Los Angeles for a production located in England due to the lack of collaboration between him and the director as well as the rest of the crew.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== The Fly (1986 film) ====\nIn the early 1980s, producer Kip Ohman proposed to [[Charles Edward Pogue]] about the idea of remaking the classic sci-fi horror movie ''[[The Fly (1958 film)]]''. After reading the original novel by [[George Langelaan]] and watching The Fly made in 1958, Pogue was very interested in the remake plan, therefore he found [[Stuart Cornfeld]] to work with 20th Century Fox. Pogue's initial idea of the screenplay was very similar to Langelaan's original work, but he and Cornfeld then felt the focus should be put on the protagonist's mutating process, not the final result of the mutation. Unexpectedly, the film script did not impress Fox, and the shooting intentions immediately fell through. After multiple negotiations, Fox finally agreed to distribute the film, only if Cornfeld and his crew raise the fund themselves.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/68348|title=THE FLY (1986)|last=|first=|date=|website=American Film Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fourthreefilm.com/2016/08/the-fly-a-30-year-love-story/|title=The Fly: A 30-Year Love Story|last=Westwood|first=Emma|date=|website=4:3|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Stuart Cornfeld|Cornfeld]] found [[Mel Brooks]] to co-produce the film. The two had previously worked together in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]].'' When Brooks and Confield began looking for the suitable director, their first choice was [[David Cronenberg]]. However, [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] was busy with assisting [[Dino De Laurentiis|Dino de Laurentis]] to prepare for [[Total Recall (1990 film)|''Total Recall'']] at the moment. After watching several short films made by [[Robert Bierman]], Cornfeld decided to corporate with this young British director. However, when the pre-production of the film went on the right track, Bierman's daughter died in an accident. Brooks and Cornfeld waited for a month to let Bierman arrange the funeral and adjust his mood. But still, Bierman said that he could not resume his work in a short time. After three months, they had to cancel the contract.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2005|title=Fear of The Flesh: The Making of The Fly|url=|journal=20th Century Fox|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Knowing that [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] had given up [[Total Recall (1990 film)|''Total Recall'']], Cornfeld once again invited him. [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] then agreed to be the director, but only if he could personally rewrite the script. the screenplay written by Cronenberg was very different, but it still retained the original basic plot and the core concept of genetic variation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSince Cronenberg did not want to break the actions for the special effect, the optical effect department adopted the real-time motion control system to create a \"moving lock-off shot\". [[Hoyt Yeatman]], the optical effect supervisor of The Fly, described the technology in the following way:<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Magid|first=Ron|date=1986|title=More About The Fly|url=|journal=American Cinematographer|volume=67|issue=9|pages=69|via=}}</ref><blockquote>The shots were programmed by keyboard, and since they were working in real time, we didn't have to do move tests per se\u2026 \u2026 And once we got it down, then we'd do a number of takes with the object to be teleported in the booth. Then we would basically do nothing more than remove the object from the booth and redo the. Lights exactly as before: each time we had to change the globes and then we'd do another move. Then we'd use the motion control rig to repeat the shot exactly for the \"B\" side of the cut with the empty pod. At that point, we had two pieces of film with a common sync point - the first side being the \"A\" side containing the object, the second side or \"B\" side was the empty pod - and when you match those together in a synchroniser you can dissolve or pop between them and the move is exactly the same.<ref name=\":4\" /></blockquote>\n\n==== The Fly II ====\nAccording to a journal Hollywood Reporter in 1989, while filming the 1986 remake of The Fly, Stuart Cornfeld noticed Chris Walas, the person who later won the 1987 Academy Award for his work as special effects makeup. He then recommended Walas to be the director of the sequence and contributed to Walas\u2019 collaboration with Brooksfilms, the company that produced both movies of the remake series. The fly II therefore became the directorial debut of Walas. The shooting started in April 1988 and was done in Bridge Studios located in Vancouver, Canada, with a shooting schedule of 12 weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/58070-THE-FLY-II?sid=5950808f-6733-4ab6-b805-6b956caf54d7&sr=6.2678323&cp=1&pos=0|title=The Fly II|last=|first=|date=|website=American Film Institution|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Possible Reboot ====\nAccording to an interview in 2017 made by [[/Film]] with [[J.D. Dillard]], the director of the American drama film ''[[Sleight]],'' a plan of remaking David Cronenberg's ''The Fly'' was at its early phase of negotiations. Dillard disclosed in the interview that he might work with Alex Theurer, the co-writer of the Movie ''Sleight,'' for the remake movie: \"''For me \u2013 and this would be about The Fly, but this is also about Alex and my approach to remakes because post-Sleight that has been the conversation for what a lot of big flashy studio gigs are \u2013 no matter what, we want to start with character. \"'' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/j-d-dillards-the-fly-remake-pitch/|title=\u2018The Fly\u2019 Remake: J.D.

He hires Alan Hines ([[David Frankham]]), who then turns out to be an industrial spy by the name of Ronald Holms, to help with the experiment. As the experiment going on the right track, Ronald's true intention is beginning to be uncovered''.''\n\n==== Curse of the Fly ====\n{{Main|Curse of the Fly}}\nMartin Delambre ([[George Baker (actor)|George Baker]]) encounters a beautiful young girl, Patricia Stanley ([[Carole Gray]]), one night on his way to Montreal. The loving couple soon get married, but they are both keeping horrible secrets to each other: Patricia was actually escaping from an asylum the night they met; and Martin is secretly experimenting on a teleportation project which has already made considerable victims with his father, Henri Delambre ([[Brian Donlevy]]). With Patricia being traced down, secrets of the couple are facing the risk of getting revealed.\n\n=== The Remake Series (1986-1989) ===\n\n==== The Fly (1986 film) ====\n{{Main|The Fly (1986 film)}}\nScientist [[Seth Brundle (The Fly)|Seth Brundle]] ([[Jeff Goldblum]]), has successfully invented a teleportation device which can disintegrate matter in one \u201cTelepod\u201d and reintegrate it in another. Journalist Veronica \u201cRonnie\u201d ([[Geena Davis]]) agrees to document Seth's project, and the two become lovers. One night, Seth rashly decides to test the process on himself, but fails to notice a common housefly which has slipped into the transmitter pod with him. The computer becomes confused by the fly's presence, and merges it with Seth at the genetic level. Unaware of the accident, Seth initially believes that his newly-increased strength and energy are a result of the teleportation process purifying and improving his body, but his behavior soon becomes arrogant and violent. Veronica notices the disturbing changes in Seth's personality, whose body begins a prolonged and grotesque process of deteriorating into a human-insect hybrid creature, which Seth dubs \u201cBrundlefly\u201d. Ronnie and the diseased Seth must both cope with the effects of his transformation on their relationship, while Seth desperately searches for a cure before his humanity\u2014and his sanity\u2014completely drain away.\n\n==== The Fly II ====\n{{Main|The Fly II}}\nThe sequel continues the story, with Veronica Quaife dying in the process of giving birth to Seth Brundle's mutant son. The child, named Martin Brundle ([[Eric Stoltz]]), is adopted by Anton Bartok ([[Lee Richardson (actor)|Lee Richardson]]), the head of Bartok Industries and sponsor of Seth's experiment. Martin's unique heritage (which he is kept unaware of) results in his suffering from rapid aging, but also provides him with a photographic memory and no need for sleep. Physically a grown adult by his fifth birthday, Martin is given the task of repairing his father's Telepods by Bartok, and also falls in love with Bartok employee Beth Logan ([[Daphne Zuniga]]). However, Bartok has ulterior motives for his seeming kindness toward Martin: He intends to use to Telepods\u2019 ability to gene-splice for nefarious purposes, and has been aware from the start that Martin will eventually mutate into a human-fly hybrid creature. Martin and Beth must race against time to escape from Bartok and find a way to cure Martin before he suffers the same grotesque fate as his father.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n\n==== The Fly (1958 film) ====\nThe movie was based on the short story \"[[The Fly (Langelaan)|The Fly]]\" written by George Langelaan, which was published on [[Playboy magazine]] in 1957. According to Maury Dexter, an American producer who once worked with Robert Lippert, the novel was originally found and brought to the studio by Kurt Neuman.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://fiftieswesterns.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/highway-to-hollywood1.pdf|title=High Way to Hollywood|last=Dexter|first=Maury|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=99}}</ref> Although Robert Lippert was the one who brought the idea to 20th Century Fox and got its agreement on filming the movie, Fox replaced Lippert by Neuman as the producer afterwards due to Lippert's conflict with [[Screen Actors Guild]]. The Fly was then made in colour as a Fox Film.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/52548-THE-FLY?sid=277d5ff1-ed8d-4b6f-96db-711617339034&sr=1.01818&cp=2&pos=5|title=THE FLY (1958)|last=|first=|date=|website=American Film Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref> James Clavell was hired by Lippert for the adaption of the screenplay, and his work, based on what Harry Spalding has said, was \u201cthe best draft\u201d he has even seen.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe special effect of the human-fly hybrid was said to be created by covering the actor's head by a rubber sheath. To make the mask more alive, the original beaded domes as the eyes were made iridescent, and Hedison may wriggle his \u201cproboscis\u201d through a wooden plug held in his mouth.<ref name=\":6\" /> The budget was claimed to be $480,000 by Lippert, and $28,000 of which was spent on the construction of the laboratory set.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=A|first=Ryon|date=23 September 1962|title=Third-run film king tells industry's woes|url=|journal=Los Angeles Times|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> The film was released in July 1958 and became the biggest hit of Fox that year, grossing $3,000,000 in domestically. However, Kurt did not witness the huge success of his work as he died from a heart attack few weeks after the release of the film.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/75222/The-Fly/articles.html|title=The Fly (1958)|last=Smith|first=Richard Harland|date=|website=Turner Classic Movies|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Return of the Fly ====\nDue to the success of its preceding work, Return of the Fly was created double-billed with The Alligator people and was released in 1959. The idea of making this sequel was first brought out by Harry Spalding. He recalled the screenplay was not easy to start since the first movie \u201cwas a one-short deal, an accident\u201d which was \u201cnot like a Frankenstein Monster, someone you can revive\u201d. He then stated the budget of the movie was higher than the normal $125,000, yet it turned out to be profitable. According to Bernard Glasser, the producer of the movie, their budget was then increased to $275,000. The movie was asked to move from an independent shooting lot to the studio of Fox by its production department, which gave the crew more autonomy over the production . Glasser also complained about the slow production pace of Fox, claiming that most of the money were spent unproductively, which made Lippert \u201chave to obtain additional fund\u201d.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Return of the B science fiction and horror heroes|last=Weaver|first=Tom|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=|location=Jefferson|pages=115, 116}}</ref>\n\nBecause Ed Wolff, the Fly portrayer, had problem breathing wearing the Fly head, most of his action sequences were done by his stuntman, Joe Becker. The actor of the original \u201cFly\u201d, Vincent Price has also taken part in this sequel, being paid at $25,000. However, are Glasser recalled, he was \u201cnot overly enthusiastic about the screenplay\".<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Curse of the Fly ====\nWhen Lippert first mentioned the idea of making a third Fly, Spalding was surprised and <s>kind of</s> reluctant, saying they were \u201clucky to be able to do a second one\u201d. Having Claude Rains in his mind as the main character, Spalding completed the script. However, Lippert put Brian Donlevy in the role instead, since Donlevy has previously worked well in another horror movie, Creeping Unknown, and Lippert wanted to stick to what has worked before. Spalding also pointed out the difficulty of writing the screenplay in Los Angeles for a production located in England due to the lack of collaboration between him and the director as well as the rest of the crew.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== The Fly (1986 film) ====\nIn the early 1980s, producer Kip Ohman proposed to [[Charles Edward Pogue]] about the idea of remaking the classic sci-fi horror movie ''[[The Fly (1958 film)]]''. After reading the original novel by [[George Langelaan]] and watching The Fly made in 1958, Pogue was very interested in the remake plan, therefore he found [[Stuart Cornfeld]] to work with 20th Century Fox. Pogue's initial idea of the screenplay was very similar to Langelaan's original work, but he and Cornfeld then felt the focus should be put on the protagonist's mutating process, not the final result of the mutation. Unexpectedly, the film script did not impress Fox, and the shooting intentions immediately fell through. After multiple negotiations, Fox finally agreed to distribute the film, only if Cornfeld and his crew raise the fund themselves.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/68348|title=THE FLY (1986)|last=|first=|date=|website=American Film Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fourthreefilm.com/2016/08/the-fly-a-30-year-love-story/|title=The Fly: A 30-Year Love Story|last=Westwood|first=Emma|date=|website=4:3|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Stuart Cornfeld|Cornfeld]] found [[Mel Brooks]] to co-produce the film. The two had previously worked together in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]].'' When Brooks and Confield began looking for the suitable director, their first choice was [[David Cronenberg]]. However, [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] was busy with assisting [[Dino De Laurentiis|Dino de Laurentis]] to prepare for [[Total Recall (1990 film)|''Total Recall'']] at the moment. After watching several short films made by [[Robert Bierman]], Cornfeld decided to corporate with this young British director. However, when the pre-production of the film went on the right track, Bierman's daughter died in an accident. Brooks and Cornfeld waited for a month to let Bierman arrange the funeral and adjust his mood. But still, Bierman said that he could not resume his work in a short time. After three months, they had to cancel the contract.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2005|title=Fear of The Flesh: The Making of The Fly|url=|journal=20th Century Fox|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Knowing that [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] had given up [[Total Recall (1990 film)|''Total Recall'']], Cornfeld once again invited him. [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] then agreed to be the director, but only if he could personally rewrite the script. the screenplay written by Cronenberg was very different, but it still retained the original basic plot and the core concept of genetic variation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSince Cronenberg did not want to break the actions for the special effect, the optical effect department adopted the real-time motion control system to create a \"moving lock-off shot\". [[Hoyt Yeatman]], the optical effect supervisor of The Fly, described the technology in the following way:<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Magid|first=Ron|date=1986|title=More About The Fly|url=|journal=American Cinematographer|volume=67|issue=9|pages=69|via=}}</ref><blockquote>The shots were programmed by keyboard, and since they were working in real time, we didn't have to do move tests per se\u2026 \u2026 And once we got it down, then we'd do a number of takes with the object to be teleported in the booth. Then we would basically do nothing more than remove the object from the booth and redo the. Lights exactly as before: each time we had to change the globes and then we'd do another move. Then we'd use the motion control rig to repeat the shot exactly for the \"B\" side of the cut with the empty pod. At that point, we had two pieces of film with a common sync point - the first side being the \"A\" side containing the object, the second side or \"B\" side was the empty pod - and when you match those together in a synchroniser you can dissolve or pop between them and the move is exactly the same.<ref name=\":4\" /></blockquote>\n\n==== The Fly II ====\nAccording to a journal Hollywood Reporter in 1989, while filming the 1986 remake of The Fly, Stuart Cornfeld noticed Chris Walas, the person who later won the 1987 Academy Award for his work as special effects makeup. He then recommended Walas to be the director of the sequence and contributed to Walas\u2019 collaboration with Brooksfilms, the company that produced both movies of the remake series. The fly II therefore became the directorial debut of Walas. The shooting started in April 1988 and was done in Bridge Studios located in Vancouver, Canada, with a shooting schedule of 12 weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/58070-THE-FLY-II?sid=5950808f-6733-4ab6-b805-6b956caf54d7&sr=6.2678323&cp=1&pos=0|title=The Fly II|last=|first=|date=|website=American Film Institution|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Possible Reboot ====\nAccording to an interview in 2017 made by [[/Film]] with [[J.D. Dillard]], the director of the American drama film ''[[Sleight]],'' a plan of remaking David Cronenberg's ''The Fly'' was at its early phase of negotiations. Dillard disclosed in the interview that he might work with Alex Theurer, the co-writer of the Movie ''Sleight,'' for the remake movie: \"''For me \u2013 and this would be about The Fly, but this is also about Alex and my approach to remakes because post-Sleight that has been the conversation for what a lot of big flashy studio gigs are \u2013 no matter what, we want to start with character. \"'' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/j-d-dillards-the-fly-remake-pitch/|title=\u2018The Fly\u2019 Remake: J.D.

Originally written c. 450\u2013200 BCE, it is also among the canonical [[Wisdom literature]] of the [[Old Testament]] in most [[denominations of Christianity]]. The title ''Ecclesiastes'' is a Latin [[transliteration]] of the Greek translation of the Hebrew '''Kohelet''' (also written as ''Koheleth'', ''Qoheleth'' or ''Qohelet''), the [[pseudonym]] used by the author of the book.\n\nIn traditional Jewish texts and throughout church history (up to the 18th and 19th centuries), [[King Solomon]] is named as the author, but modern scholars reject this. Textually, the book is the musings of a King of Jerusalem as he relates his experiences and draws lessons from them, often self-critical. The author, who is not named anywhere in the book, or in the whole of the Bible, introduces a \"Kohelet\" whom he identifies as the son of David ([[Ecclesiastes 1:1|1:1]]). The author does not use his own \"voice\" throughout the book again until the final verses (12:9\u201314), where he gives his own thoughts and summarises what \"the Kohelet\" has spoken. It emphatically proclaims all the actions of man to be inherently \"hevel\" (a word meaning \"vapor\" or \"breath\", but often interpreted as \"insubstantial\", \"vain\", or \"futile\") [...] as the lives of both wise and foolish men end in death. While Qoheleth clearly endorses wisdom as a means for a well-lived earthly life, he is unable to ascribe eternal meaning to it. In light of this perceived senselessness, he suggests that one should enjoy the simple pleasures of daily life such as eating, drinking, and taking enjoyment in one's work, which are gifts from the hand of God. The book concludes with the injunction: \"Fear God, and keep his commandments; for that is the whole duty of everyone\" (12:13).\n\n==Structure==\nEcclesiastes is presented as biography of \"Kohelet\" (or \"Qoheleth\", meaning \"Assembler\", but traditionally translated by Christians as \"Teacher\" or \"Preacher\"{{sfn|Seow|2007|p=944}}). Kohelet's story is framed by voice of the narrator, who refers to Kohelet in the third person, praises his wisdom, but reminds the reader that wisdom has its limitations and is not man's main concern. Kohelet reports what he planned, did, experienced and thought. His journey to knowledge is, in the end, incomplete. The reader is not only to hear Kohelet's wisdom, but to observe his journey towards understanding and acceptance of life's frustrations and uncertainties: the journey itself is important.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xiii}}\n\nFew of the many attempts to uncover an underlying structure to Ecclesiastes have met with widespread acceptance; among them, the following is one of the more influential:{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xvi}}\n* Title (1:1)\n* Initial poem (1:2\u201311)\n* I: Kohelet's investigation of life (1:12\u20136:9)\n* II: Kohelet's conclusions (6:10\u201311:6)\n** Introduction (6:10\u201312)\n** A: Man cannot discover what is good for him to do (7:1\u20138:17)\n** B: Man does not know what will come after him (9:1\u201311:6)\n* Concluding poem (11:7\u201312:8)\n* Epilogue (12:9\u201314)\nDespite the acceptance by some of this structure, there have been many scathing criticisms, such as that of Fox: \"[Addison G. Wright's] proposed structure has no more effect on interpretation than a ghost in the attic. A literary or rhetorical structure should not merely 'be there'; it must <i>do</i> something. It should guide readers in recognizing and remembering the author's train of thought.\" {{sfn|Fox|2004|p=148-149}}\n\nVerse 1:1 is a superscription, the ancient equivalent of a title page: it introduces the book as \"the words of Kohelet, son of David, king in Jerusalem.\"{{sfn|Longman|1998|pp=57\u201359}}\n\nMost, though not all, modern commentators regard the epilogue (12:9\u201314) as an addition by a later scribe. Some have identified certain other statements as further additions intended to make the book more religiously orthodox (e.g., the affirmations of God's justice and the need for piety).{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xvii}}\n\n==Summary==\nThe ten-verse introduction in verses 1:2\u201311 are the words of the frame narrator; they set the mood for what is to follow. Kohelet's message is that all is meaningless.{{sfn|Longman|1998|pp=57\u201359}}\n\nAfter the introduction come the words of Kohelet. As king he has experienced everything and done everything, but nothing is ultimately reliable. Death levels all. The only good is to partake of life in the present, for enjoyment is from the hand of God. Everything is ordered in time and people are subject to time in contrast to God's eternal character. The world is filled with injustice, which only God will adjudicate. God and humans do not belong in the same realm and it is therefore necessary to have a right attitude before God. People should enjoy, but should not be greedy; no-one knows what is good for humanity; righteousness and wisdom escape us. Kohelet reflects on the limits of human power: all people face death, and death is better than life, but we should enjoy life when we can. The world is full of risk: he gives advice on living with risk, both political and economic. Mortals should take pleasure when they can, for a time may come when no one can. Kohelet's words finish with imagery of nature languishing and humanity marching to the grave.{{sfn|Seow|2007|pp=946\u201357}}\n\nThe frame narrator returns with an epilogue: the words of the wise are hard, but they are applied as the shepherd applies goads and pricks to his flock. The ending of the book sums up its message: \"Fear God and keep his commandments for God will bring every deed to judgement.\"{{sfn|Seow|2007|pp=957\u201358}} Apparently, 12:13-14 were an addition by a more orthodox author than the original writer.<ref name=\"RossShepherd2017\">{{cite book |first1=Allen P. |last1=Ross |first2=Jerry E. |last2=Shepherd |first3=George |last3=Schwab |title=Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9e4xDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT448 |date=7 March 2017 |publisher=Zondervan Academic |isbn=978-0-310-53185-2 |page=448}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n\n===Title, date and author===\nThe book takes its name from the Greek ''ekklesiastes'', a translation of the title by which the central figure refers to himself: ''Kohelet'', meaning something like \"one who convenes or addresses an assembly\".{{sfn|Gilbert|2009|pp=124\u201325}} According to rabbinic tradition, Ecclesiastes was written by [[Solomon]] in his old age{{sfn|Brown|2011|p=11}} (an alternative tradition that \"[[Hezekiah]] and his colleagues wrote [[Isaiah]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], the [[Song of Songs]] and Ecclesiastes\" probably means simply that the book was edited under Hezekiah),{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=692}} but critical scholars have long rejected the idea of a pre-exilic origin.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=x}}{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|pp=50\u201352}} The presence of [[Old Persian|Persian]] loan-words and [[Imperial Aramaic|Aramaisms]] points to a date no earlier than about 450 BCE,{{sfn|Seow|2007|p=944}} while the latest possible date for its composition is 180 BCE, when the Jewish writer [[Ben Sira]] quotes from it.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xiv}} The dispute as to whether Ecclesiastes belongs to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] or the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] periods (i.e., the earlier or later part of this period) revolves around the degree of [[Hellenization]] (influence of Greek culture and thought) present in the book. Scholars arguing for a Persian date (c. 450\u2013330 BCE) hold that there is a complete lack of Greek influence;{{sfn|Seow|2007|p=944}} those who argue for a Hellenistic date (c. 330\u2013180 BCE) argue that it shows internal evidence of Greek thought and social setting.{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|pp=54\u201355}}\n\nAlso unresolved is whether the author and narrator of Kohelet are one and the same person. Ecclesiastes regularly switches between third-person quotations of Kohelet and first-person reflections on Kohelet's words, which would indicate the book was written as a commentary on Kohelet's parables rather than a personally-authored repository of his sayings. Some scholars have argued that the third-person narrative structure is an artificial literary device along the lines of [[Uncle Remus]], although the description of the Kohelet in 12:8\u201314 seems to favour a historical person whose thoughts are presented by the narrator.{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|p=48}} One scholar (Roland Murphy) has commented that Kohelet himself would have regarded the time and ingenuity put into interpreting his book as \"one more example of the [[fatalism|futility of human effort]]\".{{sfn|Ingram|2006|p=45}}\n\n===Genre and setting===\nEcclesiastes has taken its literary form from the Middle Eastern tradition of the fictional autobiography, in which a character, often a king, relates his experiences and draws lessons from them, often self-critical: Kohelet likewise identifies himself as a king, speaks of his search for wisdom, relates his conclusions, and recognises his limitations.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xiii}} It belongs to the category of [[wisdom literature]], the body of biblical writings which give advice on life, together with reflections on its problems and meanings\u2014other examples include the [[Book of Job]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], and some of the [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]]. Ecclesiastes differs from the other biblical Wisdom books in being deeply skeptical of the usefulness of Wisdom itself.{{sfn|Brettler|2007|p=721}} Ecclesiastes in turn influenced the [[deuterocanonical]] works, [[Wisdom of Solomon]] and [[Sirach]], both of which contain vocal rejections of the Ecclesiastical philosophy of futility.\n\nWisdom was a popular genre in the ancient world, where it was cultivated in scribal circles and directed towards young men who would take up careers in high officialdom and royal courts; there is strong evidence that some of these books, or at least sayings and teachings, were translated into Hebrew and influenced the Book of Proverbs, and the author of Ecclesiastes was probably familiar with examples from Egypt and Mesopotamia.{{sfn|Fox|2004|pp=x\u2013xi}} He may also have been influenced by Greek philosophy, specifically the schools of [[Stoicism]], which held that all things are fated, and [[Epicureanism]], which held that happiness was best pursued through the quiet cultivation of life's simpler pleasures.{{sfn|Gilbert|2009|p=125}}\n\n===Canonicity===\nThe presence of Ecclesiastes in the Bible is something of a puzzle, as the common themes of the Hebrew canon\u2014a God who reveals and redeems, who elects and cares for a chosen people\u2014are absent from it, which suggests that Kohelet had lost his faith in his old age. Understanding the book was a topic of the earliest recorded discussions (the hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]] in the 1st century CE). One argument advanced at that time was that the name of Solomon carried enough authority to ensure its inclusion; however, other works which appeared with Solomon's name were excluded despite being more orthodox than Ecclesiastes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Diderot |first1=Denis |authorlink=Denis Diderot |title=Canon |journal=Encyclopedia of Diderot & d'Alembert - Collaborative Translation Project |date=1752 |pages=601\u201304 |hdl=2027/spo.did2222.0000.566}}</ref> Another was that the words of the epilogue, in which the reader is told to fear God and keep his commands, made it orthodox; but all later attempts to find anything in the rest of the book that would reflect this orthodoxy have failed. A modern suggestion treats the book as a dialogue in which different statements belong to different voices, with Kohelet himself answering and refuting unorthodox opinions, but there are no explicit markers for this in the book, as there are (for example) in the Book of Job. Yet another suggestion is that Ecclesiastes is simply the most extreme example of a tradition of skepticism, but none of the proposed examples match Ecclesiastes for a sustained denial of faith and doubt in the goodness of God. \"In short, we do not know why or how this book found its way into such esteemed company\", summarizes Martin A. Shields in his 2006 book ''The End of Wisdom: A Reappraisal of the Historical and Canonical Function of Ecclesiastes''.{{sfn|Shields|2006|pp=1-5}}\n\n==Themes==\nScholars disagree about the themes of Ecclesiastes: whether it is positive and life-affirming, or deeply pessimistic;{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|p=17}} whether it is coherent or incoherent, insightful or confused, orthodox or heterodox; whether the ultimate message of the book is to copy Kohelet, the wise man, or to avoid his errors.{{sfn|Enns|2011|p=21}} At times Kohelet raises deep questions; he \"doubted every aspect of religion, from the very ideal of righteousness, to the by now traditional idea of divine justice for individuals\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Hecht |first=Jennifer Michael |title=Doubt: A History |url=https://archive.org/details/doubthistory00jenn/page/75 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=New York |year=2003 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/doubthistory00jenn/page/75 75] |isbn=978-0-06-009795-0}}</ref> Some passages of Ecclesiastes seem to contradict other portions of the Old Testament, and even itself.{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|p=17}} The Talmud even suggests that the rabbis considered censoring Ecclesiastes due to its seeming contradictions.{{sfn|Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 30b}} One suggestion for resolving the contradictions is to read the book as the record of Kohelet's quest for knowledge: opposing judgments (e.g., \"the dead are better off than the living\" (4:2) vs. \"a living dog is better off than a dead lion\" (9:4)) are therefore provisional, and it is only at the conclusion that the verdict is delivered (11\u201312:7). On this reading, Kohelet's sayings are goads, designed to provoke dialogue and reflection in his readers, rather than to reach premature and self-assured conclusions.{{sfn|Brown|2011|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nThe subjects of Ecclesiastes are the pain and frustration engendered by observing and meditating on the distortions and inequities pervading the world, the uselessness of human deeds, and the limitations of wisdom and righteousness. The phrase \"under the sun\" appears thirty times in connection with these observations; all this coexists with a firm belief in God, whose power, justice and unpredictability are sovereign.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=ix}} History and nature move in cycles, so that all events are predetermined and unchangeable, and life has no meaning or purpose: the wise man and the man who does not study wisdom will both die and be forgotten: man should be reverent (\"Fear God\"), but in this life it is best to simply enjoy God's gifts.{{sfn|Gilbert|2009|p=125}}\n\n==Judaism==\nIn Judaism, Ecclesiastes is read either on [[Shemini Atzeret]] (by Yemenites, Italians, some [[Sepharadim]], and the mediaeval French Jewish rite) or on the [[Shabbat]] of the Intermediate Days of [[Sukkot]] (by [[Ashkenazim]]). If there is no Intermediate Sabbath of Sukkot, even the Ashkenazim read it on Shemini Atzeret (or, for Ashkenazim in the Land of Israel, on the first Shabbat of Sukkot). It is read on Sukkot as a reminder to not get too caught up in the festivities of the holiday, as well as to carry over the happiness of Sukkot to the rest of the year by telling the listeners that, without God, life is meaningless. When the listeners take this to heart, then true happiness can be achieved throughout the year.\n\nThe final poem of Kohelet ({{Bibleverse||Ecclesiastes|12:1\u20138|HE}}) has been interpreted in the [[Targum]], Talmud and [[Midrash]], and by the rabbis [[Rashi]], [[Rashbam]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra|ibn Ezra]], as an allegory of old age.\n\n==Catholicism==\nEcclesiastes has been cited in the writings of past and current [[Roman Catholic|Catholic Church]] leaders.

He describes Qoheleth as \"a [[transcendental idealism|critical transcendentalist]] ''avant la lettre''\", whose God is distant from the world, and whose ''[[kairos]]'' is a \"form of time which is itself empty of meaning\". For Balthasar, the role of Ecclesiastes in the Biblical canon is to represent the \"final dance on the part of wisdom, [the] conclusion of the ways of man\", a logical end-point to the unfolding of human wisdom in the Old Testament that paves the way for the advent of the New.<ref>{{cite book |last=von Balthasar |first=Hans Urs |title=The Glory of the Lord.

Originally written c. 450\u2013200 BCE, it is also among the canonical [[Wisdom literature]] of the [[Old Testament]] in most [[denominations of Christianity]]. The title ''Ecclesiastes'' is a Latin [[transliteration]] of the Greek translation of the Hebrew '''Kohelet''' (also written as ''Koheleth'', ''Qoheleth'' or ''Qohelet''), the [[pseudonym]] used by the author of the book.\n\nIn traditional Jewish texts and throughout church history (up to the 18th and 19th centuries), [[King Solomon]] is named as the author, but modern scholars reject this. Textually, the book is the musings of a King of Jerusalem as he relates his experiences and draws lessons from them, often self-critical. The author, who is not named anywhere in the book, or in the whole of the Bible, introduces a \"Kohelet\" whom he identifies as the son of David ([[Ecclesiastes 1:1|1:1]]). The author does not use his own \"voice\" throughout the book again until the final verses (12:9\u201314), where he gives his own thoughts and summarises what \"the Kohelet\" has spoken. It emphatically proclaims all the actions of man to be inherently \"hevel\" (a word meaning \"vapor\" or \"breath\", but often interpreted as \"insubstantial\", \"vain\", or \"futile\") [...] as the lives of both wise and foolish men end in death. While Qoheleth clearly endorses wisdom as a means for a well-lived earthly life, he is unable to ascribe eternal meaning to it. In light of this perceived senselessness, he suggests that one should enjoy the simple pleasures of daily life such as eating, drinking, and taking enjoyment in one's work, which are gifts from the hand of God. The book concludes with the injunction: \"Fear God, and keep his commandments; for that is the whole duty of everyone\" (12:13).\n\n==Structure==\nEcclesiastes is presented as biography of \"Kohelet\" (or \"Qoheleth\", meaning \"Assembler\", but traditionally translated by Christians as \"Teacher\" or \"Preacher\"{{sfn|Seow|2007|p=944}}). Kohelet's story is framed by voice of the narrator, who refers to Kohelet in the third person, praises his wisdom, but reminds the reader that wisdom has its limitations and is not man's main concern. Kohelet reports what he planned, did, experienced and thought. His journey to knowledge is, in the end, incomplete. The reader is not only to hear Kohelet's wisdom, but to observe his journey towards understanding and acceptance of life's frustrations and uncertainties: the journey itself is important.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xiii}}\n\nFew of the many attempts to uncover an underlying structure to Ecclesiastes have met with widespread acceptance; among them, the following is one of the more influential:{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xvi}}\n* Title (1:1)\n* Initial poem (1:2\u201311)\n* I: Kohelet's investigation of life (1:12\u20136:9)\n* II: Kohelet's conclusions (6:10\u201311:6)\n** Introduction (6:10\u201312)\n** A: Man cannot discover what is good for him to do (7:1\u20138:17)\n** B: Man does not know what will come after him (9:1\u201311:6)\n* Concluding poem (11:7\u201312:8)\n* Epilogue (12:9\u201314)\nDespite the acceptance by some of this structure, there have been many scathing criticisms, such as by Fox: \"[Addison G. Wright's] proposed structure has no more effect on interpretation than a ghost in the attic. A literary or rhetorical structure should not merely 'be there'; it must <i>do</i> something. It should guide readers in recognizing and remembering the author's train of thought.\" {{sfn|Fox|2004|p=148-149}}\n\nVerse 1:1 is a superscription, the ancient equivalent of a title page: it introduces the book as \"the words of Kohelet, son of David, king in Jerusalem.\"{{sfn|Longman|1998|pp=57\u201359}}\n\nMost, though not all, modern commentators regard the epilogue (12:9\u201314) as an addition by a later scribe. Some have identified certain other statements as further additions intended to make the book more religiously orthodox (e.g., the affirmations of God's justice and the need for piety).{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xvii}}\n\n==Summary==\nThe ten-verse introduction in verses 1:2\u201311 are the words of the frame narrator; they set the mood for what is to follow. Kohelet's message is that all is meaningless.{{sfn|Longman|1998|pp=57\u201359}}\n\nAfter the introduction come the words of Kohelet. As king he has experienced everything and done everything, but nothing is ultimately reliable. Death levels all. The only good is to partake of life in the present, for enjoyment is from the hand of God. Everything is ordered in time and people are subject to time in contrast to God's eternal character. The world is filled with injustice, which only God will adjudicate. God and humans do not belong in the same realm and it is therefore necessary to have a right attitude before God. People should enjoy, but should not be greedy; no-one knows what is good for humanity; righteousness and wisdom escape us. Kohelet reflects on the limits of human power: all people face death, and death is better than life, but we should enjoy life when we can. The world is full of risk: he gives advice on living with risk, both political and economic. Mortals should take pleasure when they can, for a time may come when no one can. Kohelet's words finish with imagery of nature languishing and humanity marching to the grave.{{sfn|Seow|2007|pp=946\u201357}}\n\nThe frame narrator returns with an epilogue: the words of the wise are hard, but they are applied as the shepherd applies goads and pricks to his flock. The ending of the book sums up its message: \"Fear God and keep his commandments for God will bring every deed to judgement.\"{{sfn|Seow|2007|pp=957\u201358}} Apparently, 12:13-14 were an addition by a more orthodox author than the original writer.<ref name=\"RossShepherd2017\">{{cite book |first1=Allen P. |last1=Ross |first2=Jerry E. |last2=Shepherd |first3=George |last3=Schwab |title=Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9e4xDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT448 |date=7 March 2017 |publisher=Zondervan Academic |isbn=978-0-310-53185-2 |page=448}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n\n===Title, date and author===\nThe book takes its name from the Greek ''ekklesiastes'', a translation of the title by which the central figure refers to himself: ''Kohelet'', meaning something like \"one who convenes or addresses an assembly\".{{sfn|Gilbert|2009|pp=124\u201325}} According to rabbinic tradition, Ecclesiastes was written by [[Solomon]] in his old age{{sfn|Brown|2011|p=11}} (an alternative tradition that \"[[Hezekiah]] and his colleagues wrote [[Isaiah]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], the [[Song of Songs]] and Ecclesiastes\" probably means simply that the book was edited under Hezekiah),{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=692}} but critical scholars have long rejected the idea of a pre-exilic origin.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=x}}{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|pp=50\u201352}} The presence of [[Old Persian|Persian]] loan-words and [[Imperial Aramaic|Aramaisms]] points to a date no earlier than about 450 BCE,{{sfn|Seow|2007|p=944}} while the latest possible date for its composition is 180 BCE, when the Jewish writer [[Ben Sira]] quotes from it.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xiv}} The dispute as to whether Ecclesiastes belongs to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] or the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] periods (i.e., the earlier or later part of this period) revolves around the degree of [[Hellenization]] (influence of Greek culture and thought) present in the book. Scholars arguing for a Persian date (c. 450\u2013330 BCE) hold that there is a complete lack of Greek influence;{{sfn|Seow|2007|p=944}} those who argue for a Hellenistic date (c. 330\u2013180 BCE) argue that it shows internal evidence of Greek thought and social setting.{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|pp=54\u201355}}\n\nAlso unresolved is whether the author and narrator of Kohelet are one and the same person. Ecclesiastes regularly switches between third-person quotations of Kohelet and first-person reflections on Kohelet's words, which would indicate the book was written as a commentary on Kohelet's parables rather than a personally-authored repository of his sayings. Some scholars have argued that the third-person narrative structure is an artificial literary device along the lines of [[Uncle Remus]], although the description of the Kohelet in 12:8\u201314 seems to favour a historical person whose thoughts are presented by the narrator.{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|p=48}} One scholar (Roland Murphy) has commented that Kohelet himself would have regarded the time and ingenuity put into interpreting his book as \"one more example of the [[fatalism|futility of human effort]]\".{{sfn|Ingram|2006|p=45}}\n\n===Genre and setting===\nEcclesiastes has taken its literary form from the Middle Eastern tradition of the fictional autobiography, in which a character, often a king, relates his experiences and draws lessons from them, often self-critical: Kohelet likewise identifies himself as a king, speaks of his search for wisdom, relates his conclusions, and recognises his limitations.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xiii}} It belongs to the category of [[wisdom literature]], the body of biblical writings which give advice on life, together with reflections on its problems and meanings\u2014other examples include the [[Book of Job]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], and some of the [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]]. Ecclesiastes differs from the other biblical Wisdom books in being deeply skeptical of the usefulness of Wisdom itself.{{sfn|Brettler|2007|p=721}} Ecclesiastes in turn influenced the [[deuterocanonical]] works, [[Wisdom of Solomon]] and [[Sirach]], both of which contain vocal rejections of the Ecclesiastical philosophy of futility.\n\nWisdom was a popular genre in the ancient world, where it was cultivated in scribal circles and directed towards young men who would take up careers in high officialdom and royal courts; there is strong evidence that some of these books, or at least sayings and teachings, were translated into Hebrew and influenced the Book of Proverbs, and the author of Ecclesiastes was probably familiar with examples from Egypt and Mesopotamia.{{sfn|Fox|2004|pp=x\u2013xi}} He may also have been influenced by Greek philosophy, specifically the schools of [[Stoicism]], which held that all things are fated, and [[Epicureanism]], which held that happiness was best pursued through the quiet cultivation of life's simpler pleasures.{{sfn|Gilbert|2009|p=125}}\n\n===Canonicity===\nThe presence of Ecclesiastes in the Bible is something of a puzzle, as the common themes of the Hebrew canon\u2014a God who reveals and redeems, who elects and cares for a chosen people\u2014are absent from it, which suggests that Kohelet had lost his faith in his old age. Understanding the book was a topic of the earliest recorded discussions (the hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]] in the 1st century CE). One argument advanced at that time was that the name of Solomon carried enough authority to ensure its inclusion; however, other works which appeared with Solomon's name were excluded despite being more orthodox than Ecclesiastes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Diderot |first1=Denis |authorlink=Denis Diderot |title=Canon |journal=Encyclopedia of Diderot & d'Alembert - Collaborative Translation Project |date=1752 |pages=601\u201304 |hdl=2027/spo.did2222.0000.566}}</ref> Another was that the words of the epilogue, in which the reader is told to fear God and keep his commands, made it orthodox; but all later attempts to find anything in the rest of the book that would reflect this orthodoxy have failed. A modern suggestion treats the book as a dialogue in which different statements belong to different voices, with Kohelet himself answering and refuting unorthodox opinions, but there are no explicit markers for this in the book, as there are (for example) in the Book of Job. Yet another suggestion is that Ecclesiastes is simply the most extreme example of a tradition of skepticism, but none of the proposed examples match Ecclesiastes for a sustained denial of faith and doubt in the goodness of God. \"In short, we do not know why or how this book found its way into such esteemed company\", summarizes Martin A. Shields in his 2006 book ''The End of Wisdom: A Reappraisal of the Historical and Canonical Function of Ecclesiastes''.{{sfn|Shields|2006|pp=1-5}}\n\n==Themes==\nScholars disagree about the themes of Ecclesiastes: whether it is positive and life-affirming, or deeply pessimistic;{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|p=17}} whether it is coherent or incoherent, insightful or confused, orthodox or heterodox; whether the ultimate message of the book is to copy Kohelet, the wise man, or to avoid his errors.{{sfn|Enns|2011|p=21}} At times Kohelet raises deep questions; he \"doubted every aspect of religion, from the very ideal of righteousness, to the by now traditional idea of divine justice for individuals\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Hecht |first=Jennifer Michael |title=Doubt: A History |url=https://archive.org/details/doubthistory00jenn/page/75 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=New York |year=2003 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/doubthistory00jenn/page/75 75] |isbn=978-0-06-009795-0}}</ref> Some passages of Ecclesiastes seem to contradict other portions of the Old Testament, and even itself.{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|p=17}} The Talmud even suggests that the rabbis considered censoring Ecclesiastes due to its seeming contradictions.{{sfn|Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 30b}} One suggestion for resolving the contradictions is to read the book as the record of Kohelet's quest for knowledge: opposing judgments (e.g., \"the dead are better off than the living\" (4:2) vs. \"a living dog is better off than a dead lion\" (9:4)) are therefore provisional, and it is only at the conclusion that the verdict is delivered (11\u201312:7). On this reading, Kohelet's sayings are goads, designed to provoke dialogue and reflection in his readers, rather than to reach premature and self-assured conclusions.{{sfn|Brown|2011|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nThe subjects of Ecclesiastes are the pain and frustration engendered by observing and meditating on the distortions and inequities pervading the world, the uselessness of human deeds, and the limitations of wisdom and righteousness. The phrase \"under the sun\" appears thirty times in connection with these observations; all this coexists with a firm belief in God, whose power, justice and unpredictability are sovereign.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=ix}} History and nature move in cycles, so that all events are predetermined and unchangeable, and life has no meaning or purpose: the wise man and the man who does not study wisdom will both die and be forgotten: man should be reverent (\"Fear God\"), but in this life it is best to simply enjoy God's gifts.{{sfn|Gilbert|2009|p=125}}\n\n==Judaism==\nIn Judaism, Ecclesiastes is read either on [[Shemini Atzeret]] (by Yemenites, Italians, some [[Sepharadim]], and the mediaeval French Jewish rite) or on the [[Shabbat]] of the Intermediate Days of [[Sukkot]] (by [[Ashkenazim]]). If there is no Intermediate Sabbath of Sukkot, even the Ashkenazim read it on Shemini Atzeret (or, for Ashkenazim in the Land of Israel, on the first Shabbat of Sukkot). It is read on Sukkot as a reminder to not get too caught up in the festivities of the holiday, as well as to carry over the happiness of Sukkot to the rest of the year by telling the listeners that, without God, life is meaningless. When the listeners take this to heart, then true happiness can be achieved throughout the year.\n\nThe final poem of Kohelet ({{Bibleverse||Ecclesiastes|12:1\u20138|HE}}) has been interpreted in the [[Targum]], Talmud and [[Midrash]], and by the rabbis [[Rashi]], [[Rashbam]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra|ibn Ezra]], as an allegory of old age.\n\n==Catholicism==\nEcclesiastes has been cited in the writings of past and current [[Roman Catholic|Catholic Church]] leaders. For example, [[doctors of the Church]] have cited Ecclesiastes. [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine of Hippo]] cited Ecclesiastes in Book XX of ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Augustine |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120120.htm |title=The City of God |chapter=Book XX}}</ref> [[Saint Jerome]] wrote a commentary on Ecclesiastes.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jerome |url=http://www.paulistpress.com/Products/0601-1/66-st-jerome-commentary-on-ecclesiastes.aspx |title=Commentary on Ecclesiastes}}</ref> [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] cited Ecclesiastes (\"The number of fools is infinite.\") in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Thomas Aquinas |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/aquinas/summa/sum071.htm#FP_Q63_A9-p3.1 |title=Summa Theologica}}</ref>\n\nThe twentieth-century Catholic theologian and cardinal-elect [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] discusses Ecclesiastes in his work on theological aesthetics, ''The Glory of the Lord''. He describes Qoheleth as \"a [[transcendental idealism|critical transcendentalist]] ''avant la lettre''\", whose God is distant from the world, and whose ''[[kairos]]'' is a \"form of time which is itself empty of meaning\". For Balthasar, the role of Ecclesiastes in the Biblical canon is to represent the \"final dance on the part of wisdom, [the] conclusion of the ways of man\", a logical end-point to the unfolding of human wisdom in the Old Testament that paves the way for the advent of the New.<ref>{{cite book |last=von Balthasar |first=Hans Urs |title=The Glory of the Lord.
