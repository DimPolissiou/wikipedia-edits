The abhorrence may be expressed in the form of stereotypes or caricatures. Racial antisemitism may present Jews, as a group, as being a threat in some way to the values or safety of society. Racial antisemitism could be seen as worse than [[religious antisemitism]] because for religious antisemites conversion was an option and once converted the 'Jew' was gone. With racial antisemitism a Jew could not get rid of their Jewishness.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Roots of Hate|last=Brustein|first=William|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=173|quote=|via=}}</ref> \n\nThe premise of racial antisemitism is that Jews are a distinct racial or ethnic group, compared to [[religious antisemitism]], which is prejudice against Jews and [[Judaism]] on the basis of their [[religion]].<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1603&letter=A&search=Anti-semitism \"Anti-Semitism\"], [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].</ref> According to William Nichols, religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on racial or ethnic grounds. \"The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion ... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism.\" However, with racial antisemitism, \"Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism ... . From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews...

With the decreasing role of religion in public life and the simultaneous tempering of religious antisemitism, a combination of growing [[nationalism]], the rise of [[eugenics]], resentment of the socio-economic success of the Jews, and the influx of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] from [[Eastern Europe]],{to where?} soon led to the newer, and often more virulent, racist antisemitism.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007171|title=Antisemitism in History: Racial Antisemitism, 1875\u20131945|website=www.ushmm.org|accessdate=15 September 2017}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\n[[Scientific racism]], the [[ideology]] that [[genetics]] played a role in group behavior and characteristics, was highly respected and accepted as fact between 1870 and 1940.

When added to its views on the Jewish racial traits which Nazi pseudoscience devised, the logic of racial antisemitism led to the [[Holocaust]] as a way to eradicate conjured up \"Jewish traits\" from the world.\n\n==''Limpieza de sangre''==\nRacial antisemitism has existed alongside [[religious antisemitism]] since at least the [[Middle Ages]], and maybe longer.  In [[Spain]] even before the [[Alhambra Decree|Edict of Expulsion]] of 1492, [[Sephardi|Spanish Jews]] who [[religious conversion|converted]] to [[Catholicism]] (''[[conversos]]'' in Spanish), and their descendants, were called [[New Christians]]. They were frequently accused of lapsing back to their former religious practices (being \"[[Crypto-Jews]]\"). To isolate ''conversos'', the Spanish nobility developed an ideology called \"[[cleanliness of blood]]\". The ''conversos'' were called \"New Christians\" in order to indicate their inferior status within society. That ideology was a form of [[racism]], because in the past, there were no grades of Christianity and converts to Christianity had equal standing with life-long Christians. Cleanliness of blood was an issue of ancestry, not an issue of personal religion. The first statute of purity of blood appeared in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in 1449,<ref name=\"Chami\">[http://pachami.com/Inquisicion/LimpiezaSangre.html Estatutos de Limpieza de Sangre], Pablo A. Chami.</ref> where an anti-''converso'' riot lead to ''conversos'' being banned from most official positions. Initially these statutes were condemned by both the monarchy and the Church. However, the New Christians were later hounded and persecuted by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] after 1478, the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] after 1536, the [[Peruvian Inquisition]] after 1570 and the [[Mexican Inquisition]] after 1571, as well as the Inquisition in Colombia after 1610.\n\n==Concept of a \"semitic race\"==\n{{main|Semitic people}}\n[[File:T and O map Guntherus Ziner 1472.jpg|thumb|A stylised [[T and O map]], depicting [[Asia]] as the home of the descendants of [[Shem]] (Sem). Africa is ascribed to Ham and Europe to Japheth]]\nIn [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Europe]], all [[Asian people]]s were thought of as being the descendants of [[Shem]]. By the 19th century, the term Semitic was confined to the [[ethnic group]]s which have historically spoken [[Semitic languages]] or had origins in the [[Fertile Crescent]], as the Jews in Europe did. These peoples were often considered to be a distinct [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]. However, some antisemitic racial theorists of the time argued that the [[Semitic people]]s arose from the blurring of distinctions between previously separate races. This supposed process was referred to as [[semiticization]] by the race-theorist [[Arthur de Gobineau]]. \n\nGobineau himself did not consider the Semites (descendants of Shem) to be a [[Untermensch|lesser race]].  He broke people up into three races: white, black, and yellow.  The Semites, like the [[Aryan race|Aryans]] (and [[Hamites]])  came from Asia and were white. Over time each of the groups had mixed with black blood.  The Aryans had stayed pure longer and it was not until more recent times that they had [[Miscegenation|mixed]].  It was this mixing of races that would lead to man's downfall.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Roots of Hate|last=Brustein|first=William|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=101|quote=|via=}}</ref>   This idea of racial \"confusion\" was taken up by the Nazi ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007123|title=Alfred Rosenberg|website=www.ushmm.org|accessdate=15 September 2017}}</ref> It was used by the Nazis to perpetuate the idea that the Jews were going to destroy Germany.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The term semiticization was first used by Gobineau to label the blurring of racial distinctions that, in his view, had occurred in the [[Middle East]]. Gobineau had an [[essentialist]] model of race based on the three distinct racial groups, though he had no clear account of how this division arose. When these races mixed this caused \"[[degeneration]]\". Since the point at which these three supposed races met was in the Middle East, Gobineau argued that the process of mixing and diluting races occurred there, and that Semitic peoples embodied this \"confused\" racial identity.\n\nThis concept suited the interests of [[antisemitism|antisemites]], since it provided a theoretical model to rationalise [[Racialism|racialised]] [[antisemitism]]. Variations of this theory were espoused in the writings of many antisemites in the late 19th century. The [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]] developed a variant of this theory in his writings, arguing that Jewish people were not a \"real\" race. According to Rosenberg, their evolution resulted from the mixing of pre-existing races rather than [[natural selection]]. The theory of semiticization was typically associated with other longstanding racist fears about the dilution of racial differences through [[miscegenation]], which were manifested in negative images of [[mulattos]] and other mixed groups.\n\n== Rise ==\n\nModern European antisemitism has its origins in 19th century theories\u2014now mostly considered as [[pseudo-science|pseudo-scientific]], but then accepted as credible\u2014that said that the Semitic peoples, including the Jews, are entirely different from the [[Aryan]], or [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]], populations, and that they would not be able to assimilate. In this view, Jews are not opposed on account of their [[religion]], but on account of their supposed hereditary or genetic [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial characteristics]]: greed, a special aptitude for money-making, aversion to hard work, clannishness and obtrusiveness, lack of social tact, low cunning, and especially lack of [[patriotism]]. Later, [[Nazi propaganda]] also dwelt on supposed physical differences, such as the shape of the \"[[Jewish nose]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/story3.htm|title=How to Tell a Jew}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/education/lessonplan/english/antisemitism/antisemitism.htm|title=Education - Lesson Plan: Antisemitism}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/lesson_plans/antisemitism_january27.asp|title=Antisemitic Caricature: 'The Jewish Nose is Wide at the End and Looks like the Number Six '}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/522_jews_and_their_noses.htm|title= Jews and their noses}}</ref>\n\n==Racial antisemitic legislation==\n[[Image:Nuremberg laws Racial Chart.jpg|thumb|300px|A chart use to explain the [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935, which used a pseudo-scientific racial basis for discrimination against Jews]]\n\nIn [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] of 1935 prohibited sexual relations and marriage between any Aryan and Jew (such relations under Nazi ideology was a crime punishable under the race laws as ''[[Rassenschande]]'' or \"racial pollution\"), and made it that all Jews, even quarter- and half-Jews, were no longer citizens of their own country (their official title became \"subject of the state\"). This meant that they had no basic citizens' rights, e.g., to vote. In 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them having any influence in politics, higher education and industry. On 15 November 1938, Jewish children were banned from going to normal schools. By April 1939, nearly all Jewish companies had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or had been persuaded to sell out to the Nazi government. This further reduced their rights as human beings; they were in many ways officially separated from the German populace. Similar laws existed in [[Bulgaria]] ([[Law for protection of the nation|The Law for protection of the nation]]), [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], and [[Austria]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Jewish enciclopedia,  Anti-Semitism http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1603&letter=A&search=Anti-semitism\n* Bodansky, Yossef.

In this view, Jews are not opposed on account of their [[religion]], but on account of their supposed hereditary or genetic [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial characteristics]]: greed, a special aptitude for money-making, aversion to hard work, clannishness and obtrusiveness, lack of social tact, low cunning, and especially lack of [[patriotism]]. Later, [[Nazi propaganda]] also dwelt on supposed physical differences, such as the shape of the \"[[Jewish nose]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/story3.htm|title=How to Tell a Jew}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/education/lessonplan/english/antisemitism/antisemitism.htm|title=Education - Lesson Plan: Antisemitism}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/lesson_plans/antisemitism_january27.asp|title=Antisemitic Caricature: 'The Jewish Nose is Wide at the End and Looks like the Number Six '}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/522_jews_and_their_noses.htm|title= Jews and their noses}}</ref>\n\n==Racial antisemitic legislation==\n[[Image:Nuremberg laws Racial Chart.jpg|thumb|300px|A chart use to explain the [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935, which used a pseudo-scientific racial basis for discrimination against Jews]]\n\nIn [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] of 1935 prohibited sexual relations and marriage between any Aryan and Jew (such relations under Nazi ideology was a crime punishable under the race laws as ''[[Rassenschande]]'' or \"racial pollution\"), and made it that all Jews, even quarter- and half-Jews, were no longer citizens of their own country (their official title became \"subject of the state\"). This meant that they had no basic citizens' rights, e.g., to vote. In 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them having any influence in politics, higher education and industry. On 15 November 1938, Jewish children were banned from going to normal schools. By April 1939, nearly all Jewish companies had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or had been persuaded to sell out to the Nazi government. This further reduced their rights as human beings; they were in many ways officially separated from the German populace. Similar laws existed in [[Bulgaria]] ([[Law for protection of the nation|The Law for protection of the nation]]), [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], and [[Austria]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Jewish enciclopedia,  Anti-Semitism http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1603&letter=A&search=Anti-semitism\n* Bodansky, Yossef.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}} It is surrounded by farms, small mountains, plains, and trees. Pililla is known as the Green Field Municipality of Rizal.\n\nPililla has preserved some religious and non-religious traditions such as the Santa Cruzan or Flores de Mayo, wherein men and women walk all over town with their gowns. Town Fiesta during the month of July is being visited by people from the city to experience the celebrations especially the amateur shows at night. Like other towns, Pililla holds basketball league competitions for youth during summer. Pililla is also a destination for road cyclists because of its asphalted road, specifically in Sitio Bugarin in Barangay Halayhayin.\n\n==History==\nPilang Munti (Pililla\u2019s pre-Hispanic name) was ruled by a leader named Salyan Maginto. His territory encompasses the modern-day jurisdiction of the municipalities of Baras, Tanay, Pililla, and Jalajala. It was referenced as \u201c''munti''\u201d in contrast to the nearby and much larger town of [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]] in the province of Laguna.\n\nCavada, a Spanish historian, revealed that in the year 1571, the Spanish forces conquered the towns along Laguna de Bay which they called \u201cRinconada de Moron\u201d and Pilang Munti was among these which surrendered to the superior force of the Spaniards. Pilang Munti was incorporated into the colonial administration of Morong, and thus, the town was called \"Pilang Morong\".\n\nIn 1572, the first Spanish missionary priests arrived at Pilang Morong. Since then, Christianity was spread by the Spanish priests and in 1582, Fr. Juan de Placencia and Fr. Diego de Oropesa established a \u201cvisita\u201d barrio at Pilang Morong. The place was divided by the Spaniards into 5 \u201c''rancherias''\u201d:\n\n* Monte Tan-ay\n* Sitio Tigbi (Lulukong)\n* San Diego\n* Monte Yakat\n* Dolo Rio (Wawa)\n\nIn 1583, Pilang Morong became an independent municipality. \u201dPililla\u201d was given as the official name of the newly formed town. The name \u201cPililla\u201d arose from the diminutive rules in the Castillan language by modifying a name with \u201c''-illa''\u201d or \u201c''-illo''\u201d to indicate a smaller or younger version.\n\nIn 1599, 16 years after the town was given autonomy, the supreme government granted Pililla the authority to construct a church.\n\nIn 1600, the first church of cogon and bamboo was constructed in the Dolo Rio but this was burned and a church made of wood was constructed but this was also burned down with the whole town in 1632. Another church made of wood was built and this suffered the same fate in 1668. Two years later, the construction of the present church began. This was finished in 1673 and the edifice still stands up to the present.\n\nAs an autonomous town, Pililla encompassed several barrios including Tanay and Jalajala. Tanay separated from Pililla and became an independent town in 1606. Jalajala became a barrio of Pililla in 1676 but was separated and made an independent town in 1786. It was reincorporated as a barrio of Pililla in 1816, but 9 years later, it was once again separated from Pililla to become an independent municipality.\n\nOn December 4, 1837, an election of local officials was held in Pililla. The following towns participated in the said election: Morong, Pililla, Tanay, Baras, Jalajala and San Diego. The last town was a new town and is presumed to be either the barrio of Quisao, which has San Diego as its patron, or the barrio of Niogan.\n\nIn 1853, Pililla was separated from the province of Laguna to be incorporated into the newly created Distrito de los Montes de San Mateo. In 1857, it was given the new name Distrito Politico-Militar de Morong.\n\nOn March 10, 1861, two principales of San Diego presented to the government a request, on behalf of the residents of San Diego and the sitios of Mavia and Puang, that their territory be separated from Pililla and to create an independent town to be called Perez. Both the gobernadorcillo and the parish priest, as well as the gobernador politico-militar de Morong, favored the petition. However, it was disapproved by the Administracion Civil since the territory did not meet the pre-requisite of having at least 500 tributes, the said territory was having only 298 tributes at that time.\n\nOn July 9, 1885, the government received another petition from Cabeza de Barangay of San Diego requesting that it be made into a kind of self-governing barrio of Pililla, on account of its remoteness. On January 25, 1886, the government agreed to make San Diego into a \u201c''Visita con Teniente Absolute''\u201d, on condition that the barrio constructs the necessary public buildings. Thus, upon the fulfillment of the agreed condition, the government\u2019s approval went into effect on June 18 of that same year.\n\nIn 1896, the Katipuneros of Pililla and San Diego established their military camp at Rambo or Pabalang na Gubat.\n\nThree years later, on August 6, 1898, Pililla was incorporated in the revolutionary government of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo. During the existence of the Philippine Republic, San Diego became an independent town. On January 5, 1899, a fierce battle ensued between the American forces and the Filipino troops defending Pililla. The town was partially ravaged by fire and local troops had to retreat to the mountain of Tanay.\n\nThe towns of Pililla and San Diego were integrated into the newly created province of Rizal in June 1901. Two years later, the Philippine Commission, in line with its policy of economy and centralization, consolidated the towns of Pililla, San Diego and Jalajala with the seat of government in Pililla.\n\nThe first ''Capitan'' under the American regime was Regino Quitiong who was the ''alcalde'' from 1900 to 1901.\n\nOn September 20, 1907, Jalajala was separated from Pililla and became an independent municipality. Quisao, on the other hand, remained a barrio of Pililla up to the present.\n\nIn 1918, the population of Pililla was 2,776 and Quisao was 814. In 1929, the place called Longos within the jurisdiction of Pililla was cleared by the majority of the tenant population of the town of Jalajala who transferred their homes to this site and whereon they founded a new community, thus avoiding their agrarian conflict with the plantation owner of Jalajala.\n\nOn September 24, 1929, Don Ananias Vicencio, a philanthropist in public documents, donated a tract of land containing approximately 15 hectares to the families of Manuel Roxas, Leoncio Carungay and Quintin Golliden, all of Jalajala, who shall distribute and assign free of charge and to the best interest of the residents, the said lot at Longos, Barrio Quisao, Municipality of Pililla. In 1939, this land was surveyed by Engr. Quintin Gollidon who provided the layout of this new community now called Barrio Malaya.\n\nOn December 13, 1942, the town of Quisao was attacked and pillaged by \"''tulisanes''\".\n\nDuring the liberation of the town on March 18, 1945, nearly 3/4 of all the houses and public buildings were either burned or destroyed by American and Filipino military bombing and shelling. The Japanese forces and Makapili fled to the mountains following the liberation of the town. The PCAU of the US Army reestablished the municipal government of Pililla on April 20, 1945 with the designation of Lucio Aquino, an active guerrilla leader, as the mayor.\n\n==Barangays==\n[[File:Pililla,Rizaljf6506 11.JPG|thumb|right|Pililla Municipal Hall]]\nPililla is politically subdivided into nine [[barangay]]s:{{PSGC detail|area}}\n\n* Bagumbayan ([[Poblacion]])\n* Halayhayin\n* Hulo ([[Poblacion]])\n* Imatong ([[Poblacion]])\n* Malaya\n* Niogan\n* Quisao\n* Wawa ([[Poblacion]])\n* Takungan ([[Poblacion]])\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Pililla\n| 1903 = 2859\n| 1918 = 4701\n| 1939 = 5461\n| 1948 = 6067\n| 1960 = 9021\n| 1970 = 15052\n| 1975 = 18985\n| 1980 = 23222\n| 1990 = 32771\n| 1995 = 37081\n| 2000 = 45275\n| 2007 = 58525\n| 2010 = 59527\n| 2015 = 64812\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Pililla, Rizal, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://nap.psa.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131004104825/http://census.gov.ph/ Philippine Census Information]\n* [http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23&frmIdDcfCode=7&fLguType=CM&frmIdRegion=6&frmIdProvince=38&frmIdLgu=843 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n\n{{Geographic location\n | Centre    = Pililla\n | North     = [[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]]\n | Northeast = [[Santa Maria, Laguna]]\n | East      = [[Mabitac, Laguna]]\n | Southeast = [[Pakil, Laguna]]\n | South     = [[Jalajala, Rizal|Jalajala]]\n | West      = ''[[Laguna de Bay]]''\n}}\n{{Rizal}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Rizal]]\n[[Category:Populated places on Laguna de Bay]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Municipality in Rizal, Philippines}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name = {{PH wikidata|name}} \n| image_skyline = Pililla,Rizaljf6613 06.JPG \n| image_caption = Welcome arch\n| image_seal = Pililla Rizal.png  \n| seal_size = 100x80px\n| image_map = {{PH wikidata|image_map}}\n| map_caption = {{PH wikidata|map_caption}}\n| image_map1 = {{Infobox mapframe|id={{#invoke:Wikibase|id}}}}\n| pushpin_map = Philippines\n| pushpin_label_position = left\n| pushpin_map_caption    = Location within the {{PH wikidata|country}}\n| coordinates = {{PH wikidata|coordinates}}\n| settlement_type = {{PH wikidata|settlement_type}}\n| subdivision_type = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name = {{flag|Philippines}}\n| subdivision_type1 = [[Regions of the Philippines|Region]]\n| subdivision_name1 = {{PH wikidata|region}}\n| subdivision_type2 = [[Provinces of the Philippines|Province]]\n| subdivision_name2 = {{PH wikidata|province}}\n| official_name = {{PH wikidata|official_name}}\n| etymology =  <!--origin of name-->\n| named_for =  <!--named after (if person or place)-->\n| native_name =\n| other_name =\n| motto =\n| anthem =\n| subdivision_type3 = [[House of Representatives of the Philippines#District representation|District]]\n| subdivision_name3 = [[Legislative districts of Rizal#2nd District|2nd District]]\n| established_title = Founded\n| established_date = May 5, 1583 <ref> http://www.radyoagila.com/provincial/434-years-foundation-day-ng-munisipalidad-ng-pililla-rizal-ipinagdiwang/ </ref>\n| parts_type = [[Barangay]]s\n| parts_style = para\n| p1 = 9 (see [[#Barangays|Barangays]])\n| leader_title = {{PH wikidata|leader_title}} <!--mayor-->\n| leader_name = Dan V.

The name \u201cPililla\u201d arose from the diminutive rules in the Castillan language by modifying a name with \u201c''-illa''\u201d or \u201c''-illo''\u201d to indicate a smaller or younger version.\n\nIn 1599, 16 years after the town was given autonomy, the supreme government granted Pililla the authority to construct a church.\n\nIn 1600, the first church of cogon and bamboo was constructed in the Dolo Rio but this was burned and a church made of wood was constructed but this was also burned down with the whole town in 1632. Another church made of wood was built and this suffered the same fate in 1668. Two years later, the construction of the present church began. This was finished in 1673 and the edifice still stands up to the present.\n\nAs an autonomous town, Pililla encompassed several barrios including Tanay and Jalajala. Tanay separated from Pililla and became an independent town in 1606. Jalajala became a barrio of Pililla in 1676 but was separated and made an independent town in 1786. It was reincorporated as a barrio of Pililla in 1816, but 9 years later, it was once again separated from Pililla to become an independent municipality.\n\nOn December 4, 1837, an election of local officials was held in Pililla. The following towns participated in the said election: Morong, Pililla, Tanay, Baras, Jalajala and San Diego. The last town was a new town and is presumed to be either the barrio of Quisao, which has San Diego as its patron, or the barrio of Niogan.\n\nIn 1853, Pililla was separated from the province of Laguna to be incorporated into the newly created Distrito de los Montes de San Mateo. In 1857, it was given the new name Distrito Politico-Militar de Morong.\n\nOn March 10, 1861, two principales of San Diego presented to the government a request, on behalf of the residents of San Diego and the sitios of Mavia and Puang, that their territory be separated from Pililla and to create an independent town to be called Perez. Both the gobernadorcillo and the parish priest, as well as the gobernador politico-militar de Morong, favored the petition. However, it was disapproved by the Administracion Civil since the territory did not meet the pre-requisite of having at least 500 tributes, the said territory was having only 298 tributes at that time.\n\nOn July 9, 1885, the government received another petition from Cabeza de Barangay of San Diego requesting that it be made into a kind of self-governing barrio of Pililla, on account of its remoteness. On January 25, 1886, the government agreed to make San Diego into a \u201c''Visita con Teniente Absolute''\u201d, on condition that the barrio constructs the necessary public buildings. Thus, upon the fulfillment of the agreed condition, the government\u2019s approval went into effect on June 18 of that same year.\n\nIn 1896, the Katipuneros of Pililla and San Diego established their military camp at Rambo or Pabalang na Gubat.\n\nThree years later, on August 6, 1898, Pililla was incorporated in the revolutionary government of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo. During the existence of the Philippine Republic, San Diego became an independent town. On January 5, 1899, a fierce battle ensued between the American forces and the Filipino troops defending Pililla. The town was partially ravaged by fire and local troops had to retreat to the mountain of Tanay.\n\nThe towns of Pililla and San Diego were integrated into the newly created province of Rizal in June 1901. Two years later, the Philippine Commission, in line with its policy of economy and centralization, consolidated the towns of Pililla, San Diego and Jalajala with the seat of government in Pililla.\n\nThe first ''Capitan'' under the American regime was Regino Quitiong who was the ''alcalde'' from 1900 to 1901.\n\nOn September 20, 1907, Jalajala was separated from Pililla and became an independent municipality. Quisao, on the other hand, remained a barrio of Pililla up to the present.\n\nIn 1918, the population of Pililla was 2,776 and Quisao was 814. In 1929, the place called Longos within the jurisdiction of Pililla was cleared by the majority of the tenant population of the town of Jalajala who transferred their homes to this site and whereon they founded a new community, thus avoiding their agrarian conflict with the plantation owner of Jalajala.\n\nOn September 24, 1929, Don Ananias Vicencio, a philanthropist in public documents, donated a tract of land containing approximately 15 hectares to the families of Manuel Roxas, Leoncio Carungay and Quintin Golliden, all of Jalajala, who shall distribute and assign free of charge and to the best interest of the residents, the said lot at Longos, Barrio Quisao, Municipality of Pililla. In 1939, this land was surveyed by Engr. Quintin Gollidon who provided the layout of this new community now called Barrio Malaya.\n\nOn December 13, 1942, the town of Quisao was attacked and pillaged by \"''tulisanes''\".\n\nDuring the liberation of the town on March 18, 1945, nearly 3/4 of all the houses and public buildings were either burned or destroyed by American and Filipino military bombing and shelling. The Japanese forces and Makapili fled to the mountains following the liberation of the town. The PCAU of the US Army reestablished the municipal government of Pililla on April 20, 1945 with the designation of Lucio Aquino, an active guerrilla leader, as the mayor.\n\n==Barangays==\n[[File:Pililla,Rizaljf6506 11.JPG|thumb|right|Pililla Municipal Hall]]\nPililla is politically subdivided into nine [[barangay]]s:{{PSGC detail|area}}\n\n* Bagumbayan ([[Poblacion]])\n* Halayhayin\n* Hulo ([[Poblacion]])\n* Imatong ([[Poblacion]])\n* Malaya\n* Niogan\n* Quisao\n* Wawa ([[Poblacion]])\n* Takungan ([[Poblacion]])\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Pililla\n| 1903 = 2859\n| 1918 = 4701\n| 1939 = 5461\n| 1948 = 6067\n| 1960 = 9021\n| 1970 = 15052\n| 1975 = 18985\n| 1980 = 23222\n| 1990 = 32771\n| 1995 = 37081\n| 2000 = 45275\n| 2007 = 58525\n| 2010 = 59527\n| 2015 = 64812\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Pililla, Rizal, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://nap.psa.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131004104825/http://census.gov.ph/ Philippine Census Information]\n* [http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23&frmIdDcfCode=7&fLguType=CM&frmIdRegion=6&frmIdProvince=38&frmIdLgu=843 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n\n{{Geographic location\n | Centre    = Pililla\n | North     = [[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]]\n | Northeast = [[Santa Maria, Laguna]]\n | East      = [[Mabitac, Laguna]]\n | Southeast = [[Pakil, Laguna]]\n | South     = [[Jalajala, Rizal|Jalajala]]\n | West      = ''[[Laguna de Bay]]''\n}}\n{{Rizal}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Rizal]]\n[[Category:Populated places on Laguna de Bay]]\n", "name_user": "Knightwritaz95", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pililla,_Rizal"}

While some forensic scientists travel to the scene of the crime to collect the evidence themselves, others occupy a laboratory role, performing analysis on objects brought to them by other individuals.<ref name=\"job desc\">{{cite web | title=Job Description for Forensic Laboratory Scientists | website=Crime Scene Investigator EDU | accessdate=28 August 2015 | url=http://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/forensic-scientist-job-description/ | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906092342/http://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/forensic-scientist-job-description/ | archivedate=6 September 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to their laboratory role, forensic scientists testify as [[expert witness]]es in both criminal and civil cases and can work for either the [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] or the defense.

The former, forensic, relates to a discussion or examination performed in public. Because trials in the ancient world were typically held in public, it carries a strong judicial connotation. The second is science, which is derived from the Latin word for 'knowledge' and is today closely tied to the scientific method, a systematic way of acquiring knowledge. Taken together, then, forensic science can be seen as the use of the scientific methods and processes in crime solving.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''forensic'' comes from the Latin term ''{{lang|la|for\u0113nsis}}'', meaning \"of or before the forum\".<ref>{{ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary}}</ref> The history of the term originates from Roman times, during which a criminal charge meant presenting the case before a group of public individuals in the [[Roman Forum|forum]]. Both the person accused of the crime and the accuser would give speeches based on their sides of the story. The case would be decided in favor of the individual with the best argument and delivery. This origin is the source of the two modern usages of the word ''forensic''\u2014as a form of legal evidence; and as a category of public presentation.\n\nIn modern use, the term ''forensics'' in the place of ''forensic science'' can be considered incorrect, as the term ''forensic'' is effectively a [[synonym]] for ''legal'' or ''related to courts''. However, the term is now so closely associated with the scientific field that many dictionaries include the meaning that equates the word ''forensics'' with ''forensic science''.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Origins of forensic science and early methods===\n{{main|Forensics in antiquity}}\nThe [[Ancient history|ancient world]] lacked standardized forensic practices, which enabled criminals to escape punishment. Criminal investigations and trials relied heavily on forced [[Confession (law)|confessions]] and witness [[testimony]].

(He realized it was a sickle by testing various blades on an animal carcass and comparing the wounds.) Flies, attracted by the smell of blood, eventually gathered on a single sickle. In light of this, the owner of that sickle confessed to the murder. As other  examples, the book also described how to distinguish between a [[drowning]] (water in the [[lungs]]) and [[strangulation]] (broken neck [[cartilage]]), and described evidence from examining corpses to determine if a death was caused by murder, suicide or accident.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nMethods from around the world involved saliva and examination of the mouth and tongue to determine innocence or guilt, as a precursor to the [[Polygraph test]].

It was developed by Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]], who realized that variation in the genetic code could be used to identify individuals and to tell individuals apart from one another. The first application of DNA profiles was used by Jefferys in a double murder mystery in the small English town of [[Narborough, Leicestershire]], in 1985. A 15-year-old school girl by the name of Lynda Mann was raped and murdered in Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital. The police did not find a suspect but were able to obtain a semen sample.\n\nIn 1986, Dawn Ashworth, 15 years old, was also raped and strangled in the nearby village of [[Enderby, Leicestershire|Enderby]]. Forensic evidence showed that both killers had the same blood type. Richard Buckland became the suspect because he worked at Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital, had been spotted near Dawn Ashworth's murder scene and knew unreleased details about the body. He later confessed to Dawn's murder but not Lynda's.  Jefferys was brought into the case to analyze the semen samples. He concluded that there was no match between the samples and Buckland, who became the first person to be exonerated using DNA. Jefferys confirmed that the DNA profiles were identical for the two murder semen samples. To find the perpetrator, DNA samples from the entire male population, more than 4,000 aged from 17 to 34, of the town were collected. They all were compared to semen samples from the crime.  A friend of [[Colin Pitchfork]] was heard saying that he had given his sample to the police claiming to be Colin. Colin Pitchfork was arrested in 1987 and it was found that his DNA profile matched the semen samples from the murder.\n\nBecause of this case, DNA databases were developed. There is the national (FBI) and international databases as well as the European countries (ENFSI : European Network of Forensic Science Institutes). These searchable databases are used to match crime scene DNA profiles to those already in a database.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploreforensics.co.uk/forensic-cases-colin-pitchfork-first-exoneration-through-dna.html|title=Forensic Cases: Colin Pitchfork, First Exoneration Through DNA|website=exploreforensics.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Maturation===\n[[File:JacktheRipperPuck.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Cartoon of a man holding a bloody knife looking contemptuously at a display of half-a-dozen supposed and dissimilar likenesses|Police brought to bear the latest techniques of forensic science in their attempts to identify and capture the serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]].]]\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the science of forensics had become largely established in the sphere of criminal investigation.

He used anthropometry for identification, stating that, since each individual is unique, by measuring aspects of physical difference there could be a personal identification system. He created the Bertillon System around 1879, a way of identifying criminals and citizens by measuring 20 parts of the body.

The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) has offered the community some guidelines upon which the science should build. NIST recommends that that forensic science rethinks its system. If local laboratories abide by these guidelines, 21st century forensics will be dramatically different from what it has been up till now. One of the more recent additions by NIST is a document called NISTIR-7941, titled \"Forensic Science Laboratories: Handbook for Facility Planning, Design, Construction, and Relocation\".

The former, forensic, relates to a discussion or examination performed in public. Because trials in the ancient world were typically held in public, it carries a strong judicial connotation. The second is science, which is derived from the Latin word for 'knowledge' and is today closely tied to the scientific method, a systematic way of acquiring knowledge. Taken together, then, forensic science can be seen as the use of the scientific methods and processes in crime solving.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''forensic'' comes from the Latin term ''{{lang|la|for\u0113nsis}}'', meaning \"of or before the forum\".<ref>{{ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary}}</ref> The history of the term originates from Roman times, during which a criminal charge meant presenting the case before a group of public individuals in the [[Roman Forum|forum]]. Both the person accused of the crime and the accuser would give speeches based on their sides of the story. The case would be decided in favor of the individual with the best argument and delivery. This origin is the source of the two modern usages of the word ''forensic''\u2014as a form of legal evidence; and as a category of public presentation.\n\nIn modern use, the term ''forensics'' in the place of ''forensic science'' can be considered incorrect, as the term ''forensic'' is effectively a [[synonym]] for ''legal'' or ''related to courts''. However, the term is now so closely associated with the scientific field that many dictionaries include the meaning that equates the word ''forensics'' with ''forensic science''.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Origins of forensic science and early methods===\n{{main|Forensics in antiquity}}\nThe [[Ancient history|ancient world]] lacked standardized forensic practices, which enabled criminals to escape punishment.

In light of this, the owner of that sickle confessed to the murder.

It was developed by Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]], who realized that variation in the genetic code could be used to identify individuals and to tell individuals apart from one another. The first application of DNA profiles was used by Jefferys in a double murder mystery in the small English town of [[Narborough, Leicestershire]], in 1985. A 15-year-old school girl by the name of Lynda Mann was raped and murdered in Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital. The police did not find a suspect but were able to obtain a semen sample.\n\nIn 1986, Dawn Ashworth, 15 years old, was also raped and strangled in the nearby village of [[Enderby, Leicestershire|Enderby]]. Forensic evidence showed that both killers had the same blood type. Richard Buckland became the suspect because he worked at Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital, had been spotted near Dawn Ashworth's murder scene and knew unreleased details about the body. He later confessed to Dawn's murder but not Lynda's.  Jefferys was brought into the case to analyze the semen samples. He concluded that there was no match between the samples and Buckland, who became the first person to be exonerated using DNA. Jefferys confirmed that the DNA profiles were identical for the two murder semen samples. To find the perpetrator, DNA samples from the entire male population, more than 4,000 aged from 17 to 34, of the town were collected. They all were compared to semen samples from the crime.  A friend of [[Colin Pitchfork]] was heard saying that he had given his sample to the police claiming to be Colin. Colin Pitchfork was arrested in 1987 and it was found that his DNA profile matched the semen samples from the murder.\n\nBecause of this case, DNA databases were developed. There is the national (FBI) and international databases as well as the European countries (ENFSI : European Network of Forensic Science Institutes). These searchable databases are used to match crime scene DNA profiles to those already in a database.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploreforensics.co.uk/forensic-cases-colin-pitchfork-first-exoneration-through-dna.html|title=Forensic Cases: Colin Pitchfork, First Exoneration Through DNA|website=exploreforensics.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Maturation===\n[[File:JacktheRipperPuck.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Cartoon of a man holding a bloody knife looking contemptuously at a display of half-a-dozen supposed and dissimilar likenesses|Police brought to bear the latest techniques of forensic science in their attempts to identify and capture the serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]].]]\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the science of forensics had become largely established in the sphere of criminal investigation.

He used anthropometry for identification, stating that, since each individual is unique, by measuring aspects of physical difference there could be a personal identification system. He created the Bertillon System around 1879, a way of identifying criminals and citizens by measuring 20 parts of the body. In 1884, over 240 repeat offenders were caught using the Bertillon system, but the system was largely superseded by fingerprinting.\n\nFrances Glessner Lee, known as \"the mother of forensic science\",<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/nutshells | title=Murder is Her Hobby: Frances Glessner Lee and the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death}}</ref> was instrumental in the development of forensic science in the US.

NIST recommends that that forensic science rethinks its system. If local laboratories abide by these guidelines, 21st century forensics will be dramatically different from what it has been up till now. One of the more recent additions by NIST is a document called NISTIR-7941, titled \"Forensic Science Laboratories: Handbook for Facility Planning, Design, Construction, and Relocation\".

For example, it was discovered after an audit of the Houston Police Department in 2002 that the lab had fabricated evidence which led George Rodriguez being convicted of raping a fourteen-year-old girl.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/05/us/new-doubt-cast-on-testing-in-houston-police-crime-lab.html|title = New Doubt Cast on Testing in Houston Police Crime Lab|date = 5 August 2004|accessdate = 24 October 2014|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141031000519/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/05/us/new-doubt-cast-on-testing-in-houston-police-crime-lab.html|archivedate = 31 October 2014|newspaper = The New York Times|last1 = Liptak|first1 = Adam|last2 = Blumenthal|first2 = Ralph}}</ref>  The former director of the lab, when asked, said that the total number of cases that could have been contaminated by improper work could be in the range of 5,000 to 10,000.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>  This could have been avoided if the lab had been accredited by organizations such as ASCLD/Lab, which require crime labs to undergo rigorous assessments to show that they are able to perform multiple tests accurately.  Once they become accredited, they are periodically re-evaluated to ensure that the lab is still functioning at its best.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ascld-lab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Why-become-an-acredited-lab.pdf|title = Why become an Accredited Laboratory?|accessdate = 20 October 2014|website = American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors / Laboratory Accreditation Board|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141025053645/http://www.ascld-lab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Why-become-an-acredited-lab.pdf|archivedate = 25 October 2014}}</ref>  Periodic evaluations of a lab's performance by an independent organization will help to prevent scandals from occurring in forensic science laboratories.\n\nAlthough forensic science has greatly enhanced the investigator's ability to solve crimes, it has limitations and must be scrutinized in and out of the courtroom to avoid the occurrence of wrongful convictions.<ref>{{cite news| date=21 August 2012| title=How body parts evidence gets from crime scene to courtroom| author=Fabiola Carletti| publisher=[[CBC News]], PostScript| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/08/20/f-body-parts-investigation-breakdown.html| accessdate=2012-08-21| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821205039/http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/08/20/f-body-parts-investigation-breakdown.html| archivedate=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany studies have discovered a difference in rape-related injuries reporting based on race, with white victims reporting a higher frequency of injuries than black victims.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Baker RB, Fargo JD, Shambley-Ebron D, Sommers MS.

Knowing what has happened to a missing relative can often make it easier to proceed with the grieving process and move on with life for families of missing persons.\n\nForensic science is used by various other organizations to clarify the fate and whereabouts of persons who have gone missing. Examples include the NGO [[Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team]], working to clarify the fate of people who disappeared during the period of the 1976\u20131983 military dictatorship.
