Vassalboro did not have a high school, but the town paid the tuition for its high school-aged students at OGC or local public schools. The boarding school population was never more than about 50 students, but OGC attracted students from across the country and some international students. Almost all graduates went on to college.\n\nThe school, which maintained a Quaker affiliation, was known for its diversity, community atmosphere and close student-faculty relationships. It was also known for its innovative curriculum, which included Wednesday Program and Project Week, where students took interdisciplinary classes and had opportunities for non-academic learning experiences. The school made national news in 1979 when students circulated a petition as part of a history assignment asking for a repeal of the Bill of Rights, without naming the Constitution specifically.<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite news |last1=Haggerty |first1=Donna |title=Parents Can Motivate Reluctant Readers |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/276021237/ |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=The Morning Call |date=January 31, 1985 |location=Allentown PA |page=A19}}</ref><ref name=\"TT\">{{cite news |title=Bill of Rights Repeal Signed Unwittingly? |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/112183780/ |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=The Tennessean |issue=Vol. 74 No. 234 |date=November 28, 1979 |page=12}}</ref>\n\nIn sports, the OGC boys' basketball team won two Class D Maine State Championships in 1978 and 1979 and made it to the championship game in 1983, 1984 and 1985.<ref name=\"MM\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/424677513/|title=Minnesota Twins Moving Forward|work=Manhattan Mercury|accessdate=8 April 2020|location=Manhattan KS}}</ref><ref name=\"MPA\">{{cite web |title=Basketball - Past Champions & Runners-up |url=http://www.mpa.cc/index.php/interscholastic-activities-and-committees/basketball/forms |website=Maine Principals Association |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Headmasters===\nOGC had four headmasters.<ref name=\"Sargent\" /><ref name=\"BG\">{{cite news |title=Indep.

After an impoverished childhood with immigrant parents and six sisters, he made his film debut in ''[[The Strange Love of Martha Ivers]]'' (1946) with [[Barbara Stanwyck]]. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war films. During his career, he appeared in more than 90 films. Douglas was known for his explosive acting style, which he displayed as a criminal defense attorney in ''[[Town Without Pity]]'' (1961).\n\nDouglas became an international star through positive reception for his leading role as an unscrupulous boxing hero in ''[[Champion (1949 film)|Champion]]'' (1949), which brought him his first nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. His other early films include ''[[Young Man with a Horn (film)|Young Man with a Horn]]'' (1950), playing opposite [[Lauren Bacall]] and [[Doris Day]], ''[[Ace in the Hole (1951 film)|Ace in the Hole]]'' opposite [[Jan Sterling]] (1951), and ''[[Detective Story (1951 film)|Detective Story]]'' (1951), for which he received a Golden Globe nomination as Best Actor in a Drama. He received a second Oscar nomination for his dramatic role in ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952), opposite [[Lana Turner]], and his third nomination for portraying [[Vincent van Gogh]] in ''[[Lust for Life (1956 film)|Lust for Life]]'' (1956), which landed him a second Golden Globe nomination.\n\nIn 1955, he established [[Bryna Productions]], which began producing films as varied as ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' (1957) and ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960). In those two films, he collaborated with the then-relatively-unknown director [[Stanley Kubrick]], taking lead roles in both films. Douglas has been praised for helping to break the [[Hollywood blacklist]] by having [[Dalton Trumbo]] write ''Spartacus'' with an official on-screen credit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/06/kirk-douglas-on-helping-to-break-blacklist|title=Person of the Week Kirk Douglas on Helping to Break Blacklist|website=ABC News|accessdate=February 5, 2020}}</ref> He produced and starred in ''[[Lonely Are the Brave]]'' (1962), considered a classic, and ''[[Seven Days in May]]'' (1964), opposite [[Burt Lancaster]], with whom he made seven films. In 1963, he starred in the Broadway play ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (play)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', a story that he purchased and later gave to his son [[Michael Douglas]], who turned it into an Oscar-winning [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|film]].\n\nAs an actor and philanthropist, Douglas received three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, an honorary Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. As an author, he wrote ten novels and memoirs. He is No. 17 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest male screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema]], the highest-ranked living person on the list until his death. After barely surviving a helicopter crash in 1991 and then suffering a stroke in 1996, he focused on renewing his spiritual and religious life. He lived with his second wife (of {{age|1954|5|29}} years), [[Anne Buydens]], a producer, until his death on February 5, 2020, aged 103. A [[centenarian]], he was one of the last surviving stars of the film industry's [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age]].<ref name=Valenti/>\n\n==Early life and education==\nDouglas was born Issur Danielovitch ({{Lang-yi|\u05d0\u05d9\u05e1\u05e8 \u05d3\u05e0\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc\u05d0\u05b8\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05d8\u05e9}}) in [[Amsterdam, New York]], the son of Bryna \"Bertha\" (n\u00e9e Sanglel; 1884\u20131958) and Herschel \"Harry\"  Danielovitch (c. 1884\u20131950; citations regarding his exact year of birth differ).<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/30/Kirk-Douglas.html Kirk Douglas profile], Filmreference.com; accessed July 25, 2016.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Ragman's Son: An Autobiography|author=Kirk Douglas|isbn=9780671637170|year=1988|page=[https://archive.org/details/ragmanssonautobi00doug_0/page/16 16]|url=https://archive.org/details/ragmanssonautobi00doug_0|url-access=registration|access-date=15 February 2020}}</ref> His parents were [[Jewish]] immigrants from [[Chavusy]], [[Mogilev Region]], in the [[Russian Empire]] (present-day [[Belarus]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://landofancestors.com/famous/actors_and_models/43-kirk-and-michael-douglas.html|title=Kirk and Michael Douglas|website=Land Of Ancestors \u2013 Belarus|accessdate=December 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103131937/http://landofancestors.com/famous/actors_and_models/43-kirk-and-michael-douglas.html|archive-date=November 3, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/interviews/hollywood-gladiator-kirk-douglas-has-his-eyes-set-on-a-third-barmitzvah-1.36378|title=Hollywood gladiator Kirk Douglas has his eyes set on a third barmitzvah|accessdate=May 25, 2018|date=September 20, 2012|last=Paskin|first=Barbra|work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=John|last=Plessel|url=https://www.dailynews.com/2016/12/08/5-reasons-to-celebrate-actor-kirk-douglas-on-his-100th-birthday/|title=5 reasons to celebrate actor Kirk Douglas on his 100th birthday|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=December 8, 2016|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Brad|last=Darrach|url=http://people.com/archive/kirk-douglas-vol-30-no-14/|title=Kirk Douglas|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=October 3, 1988|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-37934804|title=Kirk Douglas honoured by World Jewish Congress|work=[[BBC]]|date=November 10, 2016|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Hadley|last=Freeman|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/12/kirk-douglas-i-never-thought-id-live-to-100-thats-shocked-me|title=Kirk Douglas: 'I never thought I'd live to 100.

In this adaptation of the [[Jules Verne]] novel, he played a happy-go-lucky sailor who was the opposite in every way to the brooding Captain Nemo ([[James Mason]]). The film was one of [[Walt Disney]]'s most successful live-action movies and a major box-office hit.<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 7\"/> He managed a similar comic turn in the western ''[[Man Without a Star]]'' (1955) and in ''[[For Love or Money (1963 film)|For Love or Money]]'' (1963).

Before production of the film began, however, Douglas and Kubrick had to work out some major issues, one of which was Kubrick's rewriting the screenplay without informing Douglas first.

He mounted a play from the material in 1963 in which he starred and that ran on Broadway for five months. Reviews were mixed. Douglas retained the movie rights due to an innovative loophole of basing the rights on the play rather than the novel, despite Kesey's objections, but after a decade of being unable to find a producer he gave the rights to his son, [[Michael Douglas|Michael]].

Douglas was always billed under Lancaster in these movies but, with the exception of ''I Walk Alone'', in which Douglas played a villain, their roles were usually more or less the same size. Both actors arrived in [[Hollywood]] at about the same time, and first appeared together in the fourth film for each, albeit with Douglas in a supporting role.

He has an overpowering physical presence, which is why on a large movie screen he looms over the audience like a tidal wave in full flood. Globally revered, he is now the last living screen legend of those who vaulted to stardom at the war's end, that special breed of movie idol instantly recognizable anywhere, whose luminous on-screen characters are forever memorable.|source= \u2014[[Jack Valenti]], president of the Motion Picture Association of America.<ref name=Valenti/>}}\n\nDouglas stated that the keys to acting success are determination and application: \"You must know how to function and how to maintain yourself, and you must have a love of what you do. But an actor also needs great good luck. I have had that luck.\"<ref>Thomas, p. 11.</ref> Douglas had great vitality and explained that \"it takes a lot out of you to work in this business. Many people fall by the wayside because they don't have the energy to sustain their talent.\"<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 21\">Thomas, p. 21</ref>\n\nThat attitude toward acting became evident with [[Champion (1949 film)|''Champion'']] (1949). From that one role, writes biographer John Parker, he went from stardom and entered the \"superleague\", where his style was in \"marked contrast to Hollywood's other leading men at the time\".<ref name=Parker/> His sudden rise to prominence is explained and compared to that of [[Jack Nicholson]]'s:\n\n{{quote|He virtually ignored interventionist directors. He prepared himself privately for each role he played, so that when the cameras were ready to roll he was suitably, and some would say egotistically and even selfishly, inspired to steal every scene in a manner comparable in modern times to Jack Nicholson's ''modus operandi''.<ref name=Parker/>}}\n\nAs a producer, Douglas had a reputation of being a compulsively hard worker who expected others to exude the same level of energy. As such, he was typically demanding and direct in his dealing with people who worked on his projects, with his intensity spilling over into all elements of his film-making.<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 19\"/> This was partly due to his high opinion of actors, movies, and moviemaking: \"To me it is the most important art form\u2014it ''is'' an art, and it includes all the elements of the modern age.\" He also stressed prioritizing the entertainment goal of films over any messages, \"You can make a statement, you can say something, but it must be entertaining.\"<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 28\"/>\n\nAs an actor, he dived into every role, dissecting not only his own lines but all the parts in the script to measure the rightness of the role, and he was willing to fight with a director if he felt justified.<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 21\"/> [[Melville Shavelson]], who produced and directed ''[[Cast a Giant Shadow]]'' (1966), said that it didn't take him long to discover what his main problem was going to be in directing Douglas:\n\n{{quote|Kirk Douglas was ''intelligent.'' When discussing a script with actors, I have always found it necessary to remember that they never read the other actors' lines, so their concept of the story is somewhat hazy. Kirk had not only read the lines of everyone in the picture, he had also read the stage directions ... Kirk, I was to discover, always read every word, discussed every word, always argued every scene, until he was convinced of its correctness. ... He listened, so it was necessary to fight every minute.<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 21\"/>}}\n[[File:KirkDouglasZubinMehtaMar11.jpg|thumb|Douglas with [[Zubin Mehta]], March 2011]]\n\nFor most of his career, Douglas enjoyed good health and what seemed like an inexhaustible supply of energy. He attributed much of that vitality to his childhood and pre-acting years: \"The drive that got me out of my hometown and through college is part of the makeup that I utilize in my work. It's a constant fight, and it's tough.\"<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 21\"/> His demands on others, however, were an expression of the demands he placed on himself, rooted in his youth. \"It took me years to concentrate on being a human being\u2014I was too busy scrounging for money and food, and struggling to better myself.\"<ref>Thomas, p. 25</ref>\n\nActress [[Lee Grant]], who acted with him and later filmed a documentary about him and his family, notes that even after he achieved worldwide stardom, his father would not acknowledge his success. He said \"nothing. Ever.\"<ref name=Grant/> Douglas's wife, Anne, similarly attributes the energy he devotes to acting to his tough childhood:\n\n{{quote|He was reared by his mother and his sisters and as a schoolboy he had to work to help support the family. I think part of Kirk's life has been a monstrous effort to prove himself and gain recognition in the eyes of his father ... Not even four years of psychoanalysis could alter the drives that began as a desire to prove himself.<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 24\"/>}}\n\nDouglas has credited his mother, Bryna, for instilling in him the importance of \"gambling on yourself\", and he kept her advice in mind when making films.<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 19\"/> [[Bryna Productions]] was named in her honor. Douglas realized that his intense style of acting was something of a shield: \"Acting is the most direct way of escaping reality, and in my case it was a means of escaping a drab and dismal background.\"<ref>Thomas, p. 22</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n===Personality===\nIn ''The Ragman's Son'', Douglas described himself as a \"son of a bitch\", adding, \"I\u2019m probably the most disliked actor in Hollywood.

After an impoverished childhood with immigrant parents and six sisters, he made his film debut in ''[[The Strange Love of Martha Ivers]]'' (1946) with [[Barbara Stanwyck]]. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war films. During his career, he appeared in more than 90 films. Douglas was known for his explosive acting style, which he displayed as a criminal defense attorney in ''[[Town Without Pity]]'' (1961).\n\nDouglas became an international star through positive reception for his leading role as an unscrupulous boxing hero in ''[[Champion (1949 film)|Champion]]'' (1949), which brought him his first nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. His other early films include ''[[Young Man with a Horn (film)|Young Man with a Horn]]'' (1950), playing opposite [[Lauren Bacall]] and [[Doris Day]], ''[[Ace in the Hole (1951 film)|Ace in the Hole]]'' opposite [[Jan Sterling]] (1951), and ''[[Detective Story (1951 film)|Detective Story]]'' (1951), for which he received a Golden Globe nomination as Best Actor in a Drama. He received a second Oscar nomination for his dramatic role in ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952), opposite [[Lana Turner]], and his third nomination for portraying [[Vincent van Gogh]] in ''[[Lust for Life (1956 film)|Lust for Life]]'' (1956), which landed him a second Golden Globe nomination.\n\nIn 1955, he established [[Bryna Productions]], which began producing films as varied as ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' (1957) and ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960). In those two films, he collaborated with the then-relatively-unknown director [[Stanley Kubrick]], taking lead roles in both films. Douglas has been praised for helping to break the [[Hollywood blacklist]] by having [[Dalton Trumbo]] write ''Spartacus'' with an official on-screen credit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/06/kirk-douglas-on-helping-to-break-blacklist|title=Person of the Week Kirk Douglas on Helping to Break Blacklist|website=ABC News|accessdate=February 5, 2020}}</ref> He produced and starred in ''[[Lonely Are the Brave]]'' (1962), considered a classic, and ''[[Seven Days in May]]'' (1964), opposite [[Burt Lancaster]], with whom he made seven films. In 1963, he starred in the Broadway play ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (play)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', a story that he purchased and later gave to his son [[Michael Douglas]], who turned it into an Oscar-winning [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|film]].\n\nAs an actor and philanthropist, Douglas received three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, an honorary Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. As an author, he wrote ten novels and memoirs. He is No. 17 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest male screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema]], the highest-ranked living person on the list until his death. After barely surviving a helicopter crash in 1991 and then suffering a stroke in 1996, he focused on renewing his spiritual and religious life. He lived with his second wife (of {{age|1954|5|29}} years), [[Anne Buydens]], a producer, until his death on February 5, 2020, aged 103. A [[centenarian]], he was one of the last surviving stars of the film industry's [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age]].<ref name=Valenti/>\n\n==Early life and education==\nDouglas was born Issur Danielovitch ({{Lang-yi|\u05d0\u05d9\u05e1\u05e8 \u05d3\u05e0\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc\u05d0\u05b8\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05d8\u05e9}}) in [[Amsterdam, New York]], the son of Bryna \"Bertha\" (n\u00e9e Sanglel; 1884\u20131958) and Herschel \"Harry\"  Danielovitch (c. 1884\u20131950; citations regarding his exact year of birth differ).<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/30/Kirk-Douglas.html Kirk Douglas profile], Filmreference.com; accessed July 25, 2016.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Ragman's Son: An Autobiography|author=Kirk Douglas|isbn=9780671637170|year=1988|page=[https://archive.org/details/ragmanssonautobi00doug_0/page/16 16]|url=https://archive.org/details/ragmanssonautobi00doug_0|url-access=registration|access-date=15 February 2020}}</ref> His parents were [[Jewish]] immigrants from [[Chavusy]], [[Mogilev Region]], in the [[Russian Empire]] (present-day [[Belarus]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://landofancestors.com/famous/actors_and_models/43-kirk-and-michael-douglas.html|title=Kirk and Michael Douglas|website=Land Of Ancestors \u2013 Belarus|accessdate=December 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103131937/http://landofancestors.com/famous/actors_and_models/43-kirk-and-michael-douglas.html|archive-date=November 3, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/interviews/hollywood-gladiator-kirk-douglas-has-his-eyes-set-on-a-third-barmitzvah-1.36378|title=Hollywood gladiator Kirk Douglas has his eyes set on a third barmitzvah|accessdate=May 25, 2018|date=September 20, 2012|last=Paskin|first=Barbra|work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=John|last=Plessel|url=https://www.dailynews.com/2016/12/08/5-reasons-to-celebrate-actor-kirk-douglas-on-his-100th-birthday/|title=5 reasons to celebrate actor Kirk Douglas on his 100th birthday|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=December 8, 2016|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Brad|last=Darrach|url=http://people.com/archive/kirk-douglas-vol-30-no-14/|title=Kirk Douglas|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=October 3, 1988|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-37934804|title=Kirk Douglas honoured by World Jewish Congress|work=[[BBC]]|date=November 10, 2016|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Hadley|last=Freeman|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/12/kirk-douglas-i-never-thought-id-live-to-100-thats-shocked-me|title=Kirk Douglas: 'I never thought I'd live to 100.

He graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1939. He received a loan which he paid back by working part-time as a gardener and a janitor. He was a standout on the [[wrestler|wrestling]] team and wrestled one summer in a carnival to make money.<ref>Thomas, p. 15</ref>\n\nDouglas's acting talents were noticed at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in [[New York City]], which gave him a special scholarship.

She once gave him her uncle's old coat to keep warm: \"I thought he must be frozen in the winter . ... He was thrilled and grateful.\" Sometimes, just to see him, she would drag a friend or her mother to the restaurant where he worked as a busboy and waiter. He told her his dream was to someday bring his family to New York to see him on stage. During that period she fantasized about someday sharing her personal and stage lives with Douglas, but would later be disappointed: \"Kirk did not really pursue me.

In his radio work, he acted in network soap operas, and saw those experiences as being especially valuable, as skill in using one's voice is important for aspiring actors; he regretted that the same avenues were no longer available. His stage break occurred when he took over the role played by [[Richard Widmark]] in ''[[Kiss and Tell (play)|Kiss and Tell]]'' (1943), which then led to other offers.<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 18\"/>\n\nDouglas had planned to remain a stage actor, until his friend, Lauren Bacall, helped him get his first film role by recommending him to producer [[Hal B.

''In Lonely Places: Film Noir Beyond the City'', McFarland (2011) p. 103{{ISBN?}}</ref><ref>Thomas, p. 33</ref> Reviewers of the film noted that Douglas already projected qualities of a \"natural film actor\", with the similarity of this role with later ones explained by biographer Tony Thomas:\n\n{{quote|His style and his personality came across on the screen, something that does not always happen, even with the finest actors. Douglas had, and has, a distinctly individual manner. He radiates a certain inexplicable quality, and it is this, as much as talent, that accounts for his success in films.<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 19\">Thomas, p. 19</ref>}}\n\nIn 1947, Douglas appeared in ''[[Out of the Past]]'' (UK: ''Build My Gallows High'') playing a large supporting role in this classic noir thriller starring [[Robert Mitchum]] and [[Jane Greer]]. Douglas made his Broadway debut in 1949 in ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'', produced by [[Katharine Cornell]].<ref>Mosel, ''Leading Lady: The World and Theatre of Katharine Cornell'' {{ISBN|0316585378}}</ref>\n\nDouglas's image as a tough guy was established in his eighth film, ''[[Champion (1949 film)|Champion]]'' (1949), after producer [[Stanley Kramer]] chose him to play a selfish boxer. In accepting the role, he took a gamble, however, since he had to turn down an offer to star in a big-budget MGM film, ''[[The Great Sinner]]'', which would have earned him three times the income.<ref>Douglas 1988, p. 146.</ref><ref name=Didinger/>\n\nFilm historian Ray Didinger says \"he saw ''Champion'' as a greater risk, but also a greater opportunity ... Douglas took the part and absolutely nailed it.\" Frederick Romano, another sports film historian, described Douglas's acting as \"alarmingly authentic\":\n\n{{quote|Douglas shows great concentration in the ring.

He later stated, \"I don't think I'd be much of an actor without vanity. And I'm not interested in being a 'modest actor'\".<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 28\">Thomas, p. 28</ref> Early in his Hollywood career, he demonstrated his independent streak and broke his studio contracts to gain total control over his projects, forming his own movie company, [[Bryna Productions]], named after his mother.<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 13\"/>\n\n===1950s===\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, Douglas was a major box-office star, playing opposite some of the leading actresses of that era. He played a frontier peace officer in his first western ''[[Along the Great Divide]]'' (1951). He quickly became very comfortable with riding horses and playing gunslingers, and appeared in many westerns. He considered ''[[Lonely Are the Brave]]'' (1962), in which he plays a cowboy trying to live by his own code, as his personal favorite.<ref>Thomas, p. 181</ref> The film, written by [[Dalton Trumbo]], was respected by critics, but did not do well at the box office due to poor marketing and distribution.<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 28\"/><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCfDJnKtqTc Robert Osborne discusses ''Lonely Are the Brave''], TCM channel via youtube.com; accessed July 19, 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1950, Douglas played Rick Martin in ''[[Young Man with a Horn (film)|Young Man with a Horn]]'',  based on a novel of the same name by [[Dorothy Baker]] inspired by the life of [[Bix Beiderbecke]], the [[jazz]] [[cornet]]ist. Composer-pianist [[Hoagy Carmichael]], playing the sidekick role, added realism to the film and gave Douglas insight into the role, being a friend of the real Beiderbecke.<ref>Thomas, p. 64</ref> [[Doris Day]] starred as Jo, a young woman who was infatuated with the struggling [[jazz]] musician. This was strikingly opposite of the real-life account in Doris Day's autobiography, which described Douglas as \"civil but self-centered\" and the film as \"utterly joyless\".<ref>Hotchner, A. E.

In this adaptation of the [[Jules Verne]] novel, he played a happy-go-lucky sailor who was the opposite in every way to the brooding Captain Nemo ([[James Mason]]). The film was one of [[Walt Disney]]'s most successful live-action movies and a major box-office hit.<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 7\"/> He managed a similar comic turn in the western ''[[Man Without a Star]]'' (1955) and in ''[[For Love or Money (1963 film)|For Love or Money]]'' (1963).

Before production of the film began, however, Douglas and Kubrick had to work out some major issues, one of which was Kubrick's rewriting the screenplay without informing Douglas first. It led to their first major argument: \"I called Stanley to my room ... I hit the ceiling. I called him every four-letter word I could think of ... 'I got the money, based on ''that'' [original] script. Not this shit!' I threw the script across the room. 'We're going back to the original script, or we're not making the picture.'

He mounted a play from the material in 1963 in which he starred and that ran on Broadway for five months. Reviews were mixed. Douglas retained the movie rights due to an innovative loophole of basing the rights on the play rather than the novel, despite Kesey's objections, but after a decade of being unable to find a producer he gave the rights to his son, [[Michael Douglas|Michael]].

Douglas was always billed under Lancaster in these movies but, with the exception of ''I Walk Alone'', in which Douglas played a villain, their roles were usually more or less the same size. Both actors arrived in [[Hollywood]] at about the same time, and first appeared together in the fourth film for each, albeit with Douglas in a supporting role. They both became actor-producers who sought out independent Hollywood careers.<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 44\"/>\n\n[[John Frankenheimer]], who directed the political thriller ''[[Seven Days in May]]'' in 1964, had not worked well with Lancaster in the past, and originally did not want him in this film. However Douglas thought Lancaster would fit the part and \"begged me to reconsider,\" said Frankenheimer, and he then gave Lancaster the most colorful role. \"It turns out that Burt Lancaster and I got along magnificently well on the picture,\" he later said.<ref>Armstrong, Stephen B. ed., ''John Frankenheimer: Interviews, Essays, and Profiles'', Rowman & Littlefield (2013), p. 166{{ISBN missing|date=December 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967 Douglas starred with [[John Wayne]] in the western film directed by [[Burt Kennedy]] titled ''[[The War Wagon]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=New Double Bill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/08/03/archives/new-double-bill.html|work=The New York Times|date=August 3, 1967|accessdate=February 6, 2020|page=0}}</ref>\n\nIn [[The Arrangement (1969 film)|''The Arrangement'']] (1969), a drama directed by [[Elia Kazan]], based upon his novel of the same title, Douglas starred as a tormented advertising executive, with [[Faye Dunaway]] as costar.

He has an overpowering physical presence, which is why on a large movie screen he looms over the audience like a tidal wave in full flood. Globally revered, he is now the last living screen legend of those who vaulted to stardom at the war's end, that special breed of movie idol instantly recognizable anywhere, whose luminous on-screen characters are forever memorable.|source= \u2014[[Jack Valenti]], president of the Motion Picture Association of America.<ref name=Valenti/>}}\n\nDouglas stated that the keys to acting success are determination and application: \"You must know how to function and how to maintain yourself, and you must have a love of what you do. But an actor also needs great good luck. I have had that luck.\"<ref>Thomas, p. 11.</ref> Douglas had great vitality and explained that \"it takes a lot out of you to work in this business. Many people fall by the wayside because they don't have the energy to sustain their talent.\"<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 21\">Thomas, p. 21</ref>\n\nThat attitude toward acting became evident with [[Champion (1949 film)|''Champion'']] (1949). From that one role, writes biographer John Parker, he went from stardom and entered the \"superleague\", where his style was in \"marked contrast to Hollywood's other leading men at the time\".<ref name=Parker/> His sudden rise to prominence is explained and compared to that of [[Jack Nicholson]]'s:\n\n{{quote|He virtually ignored interventionist directors. He prepared himself privately for each role he played, so that when the cameras were ready to roll he was suitably, and some would say egotistically and even selfishly, inspired to steal every scene in a manner comparable in modern times to Jack Nicholson's ''modus operandi''.<ref name=Parker/>}}\n\nAs a producer, Douglas had a reputation of being a compulsively hard worker who expected others to exude the same level of energy. As such, he was typically demanding and direct in his dealing with people who worked on his projects, with his intensity spilling over into all elements of his film-making.<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 19\"/> This was partly due to his high opinion of actors, movies, and moviemaking: \"To me it is the most important art form\u2014it ''is'' an art, and it includes all the elements of the modern age.\" He also stressed prioritizing the entertainment goal of films over any messages, \"You can make a statement, you can say something, but it must be entertaining.\"<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 28\"/>\n\nAs an actor, he dived into every role, dissecting not only his own lines but all the parts in the script to measure the rightness of the role, and he was willing to fight with a director if he felt justified.<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 21\"/> [[Melville Shavelson]], who produced and directed ''[[Cast a Giant Shadow]]'' (1966), said that it didn't take him long to discover what his main problem was going to be in directing Douglas:\n\n{{quote|Kirk Douglas was ''intelligent.'' When discussing a script with actors, I have always found it necessary to remember that they never read the other actors' lines, so their concept of the story is somewhat hazy. Kirk had not only read the lines of everyone in the picture, he had also read the stage directions ... Kirk, I was to discover, always read every word, discussed every word, always argued every scene, until he was convinced of its correctness. ... He listened, so it was necessary to fight every minute.<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 21\"/>}}\n[[File:KirkDouglasZubinMehtaMar11.jpg|thumb|Douglas with [[Zubin Mehta]], March 2011]]\n\nFor most of his career, Douglas enjoyed good health and what seemed like an inexhaustible supply of energy. He attributed much of that vitality to his childhood and pre-acting years: \"The drive that got me out of my hometown and through college is part of the makeup that I utilize in my work. It's a constant fight, and it's tough.\"<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 21\"/> His demands on others, however, were an expression of the demands he placed on himself, rooted in his youth. \"It took me years to concentrate on being a human being\u2014I was too busy scrounging for money and food, and struggling to better myself.\"<ref>Thomas, p. 25</ref>\n\nActress [[Lee Grant]], who acted with him and later filmed a documentary about him and his family, notes that even after he achieved worldwide stardom, his father would not acknowledge his success. He said \"nothing. Ever.\"<ref name=Grant/> Douglas's wife, Anne, similarly attributes the energy he devotes to acting to his tough childhood:\n\n{{quote|He was reared by his mother and his sisters and as a schoolboy he had to work to help support the family. I think part of Kirk's life has been a monstrous effort to prove himself and gain recognition in the eyes of his father ... Not even four years of psychoanalysis could alter the drives that began as a desire to prove himself.<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 24\"/>}}\n\nDouglas has credited his mother, Bryna, for instilling in him the importance of \"gambling on yourself\", and he kept her advice in mind when making films.<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 19\"/> [[Bryna Productions]] was named in her honor. Douglas realized that his intense style of acting was something of a shield: \"Acting is the most direct way of escaping reality, and in my case it was a means of escaping a drab and dismal background.\"<ref>Thomas, p. 22</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n===Personality===\nIn ''The Ragman's Son'', Douglas described himself as a \"son of a bitch\", adding, \"I\u2019m probably the most disliked actor in Hollywood.

A number of Sikh Youth organisations had participated in the convention to discuss affairs of the [[Sikh]] Panth. The formation of the Dal Khalsa occurred shortly after an [[wikt:infamous|infamous]] clash between Sikhs belonging to the [[Akhand Kirtani Jatha]] and the followers of a Sikh sect known as the [[Nirankari]]s (whom other Sikhs regard as [[Heresy|heretics]]). This clash had occurred at a Nirankari event at the [[Harmandir Sahib]] in Amritsar on 13 April 1978, in which 3 Nirankaris and 13 Sikhs were killed.<ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.mackenzieinstitute.com/2003/other_peoples_wars2.htm\n |publisher    = The Mackenzie Institute\n |location     = Toronto, Canada\n |title        = Other people's wars: A Review of Overseas Terrorism in Canada\n |date         = 8 June 2003\n |access-date  = 17 July 2005\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20051024120717/http://www.mackenzieinstitute.com/2003/other_peoples_wars2.htm\n |archive-date = 24 October 2005\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nAt its first annual conference held in [[Gurdaspur]] during December, 1979, the Dal Khalsa passed a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] demanding that [[Amritsar]] be officially declared a \"holy city\". A demand that was supported by other Sikh organisations such as the [[Sikh Students Federation]] and one which was later taken up with the Indian government by the [[SGPC]] in 1980. However, the Indian government made no decision on the demand to declare Amritsar a \"holy city\" which prompted the Dal Khalsa and the Sikh Students Federation to organise a procession on 31 May 1981. The [[Hindu]] community was opposed to the demand of declaring Amritsar a \"holy city\" and held their own parallel procession in Amritsar on 29 May 1981.\n\nFor the first time the flag of [[Khalistan]] was hoisted on 1 August 1980, by activists of the Dal Khalsa at the spot in [[Amritsar]] where 13 Sikhs had been killed during a clash with the Nirankaris on 13 April 1978. Shortly after activists of the Dal Khalsa again raised the flag of [[Khalistan]] at various places in the Punjab state during India's Independence day on 15 August 1980.\n\nDuring 1981 the Dal Khalsa along with other [[Sikh]] organisations such as the [[Sikh Students Federation]], [[SGPC]] and [[Shiromani Akali Dal]] demanded associate membership in the [[United Nations]] for the 'Sikh Nation'. Owing largely to the Dal Khalsa a resolution to this effect was passed at the \"Sikh Educational Conference\" held in [[Chandigarh]] on 15 March 1981, which had been organised by the [[Chief Khalsa Diwan]]. During this event American based [[Khalistan]] protagonist, [[Ganga Singh Dhillon]], delivered a speech on why the Sikhs are a [[nation]] and slogans of \"Khalistan Zindabad\" (Long live Khalistan) were raised at the event.\n\n===Activity resulting in a temporary ban on Dal Khalsa===\n\nA 10-year ban was put on the Dal Khalsa by the Indian government in 1982 following militant activities carried out by the organization.<ref name=\"uscis.gov\">http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/INT/HTML/INT/0-0-0-7314/0-0-0-8312.html</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=aVcG7EkuPgAC&pg=PA628&lpg=PA628&dq=%22dal+khalsa%22+1982#v=onepage&q=%22dal%20khalsa%22%20&f=false |title = Historical Dictionary of Terrorism|isbn = 9780810863118|last1 = Sloan|first1 = Stephen|last2 = Anderson|first2 = Sean K.|date = 3 August 2009}}</ref> These included several plane hijackings such as the 1981 hijacking of an Indian Airlines Jetliner (Boeing 737). The plane was hijacked on 29 September 1981, by five members of the Dal Khalsa as a form of protest against the arrest of Sant [[Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale]] who had been accused of being involved in the murder of [[Jalandhar]] based Hindu newspaper owner [[Jagat Narain]] later on Ranjit Singh confessed to murdered Jagat Narain. Ranjit Singh was from Akhand Kirtani Jatha and did not belong to Bhindranwale. The hijackers were under the leadership of Gajinder Singh who a few years later was nominated as Chairman of the organization while on asylum in Pakistan. The Dal Khalsa activists forced the plane to land in [[Lahore]], Pakistan and demanded the release of Sant [[Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale]] in addition to demanding the release of all persons who had been detained in connection with the [[Khalistan]] movement, a ransom of 500,000 dollars and compensation of 100,000 Indian Rupees (Rs.) for the families of each Sikhs that had been killed on 20 September 1981, at Chowk Mehta after the arrest of Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. A day after the hijacking Pakistani commandos arrested the Dal Khalsa activists. The hijackers were identified as Gajinder Singh, Satnam Singh of [[Paonta Sahib]], Jasbir Singh of [[Ropar]], Tejinderpal Singh of [[Jalandhar]] and Karam Singh of [[Jammu]]. Though Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale had never openly or officially associated with the Dal Khalsa the organization was largely seen have had close links with him.\n\nIn January 1982, Harsimran Singh, chief organizer of the Dal Khalsa was arrested from [[Mohali]] near [[Chandigarh]]. The Dal Khalsa leaders believed that his arrest was possible due to a conspiracy by some member of the organization. Harsimran Singh was allegedly tortured by the police and was told that they had the permission of the Government to kill him in a fake encounter near the Indo-Pakistan border. Harsimran Singh was forced to read out a written statement if he wanted to save his life.\n\nSometime during April 1982, two cow heads were severed and placed outside two [[Hindu]] temples in [[Amritsar]] by unknown culprits though the police later blamed it on the Dal Khalsa.<ref name=\"uscis.gov\"/> The incident sparked off a small riot in which a large Hindu crowd gathered at the [[Harmandir Sahib]] and began pelting stones at the most sacred place of the Sikhs. Jaswant Singh Thekedar, who at the time was an activist of the Dal Khalsa, was accused of being involved in the incident and was declared a 'Proclaimed Offender' carrying a reward of Rs. 50,000 on him. He fled to the UK via Nepal in 1983 and was expelled from the Dal Khalsa in 1986 for what were said to be 'anti-party' activities by him.\n\nThe Dal Khalsa and [[National Council of Khalistan]] were banned by the Indian government in May, 1982 after which the Dal Khalsa went underground. Two years later, the Dal Khalsa announced its \"Government in Exile\" in June, 1984.\n\nGajinder Singh, one of the plane hijackers of the Indian Airlines Jetliner (Boeing 737) in 1981, accepted the post of Chairman of the Dal Khalsa in 1986.\n\n==Revival of Dal Khalsa==\nAfter remaining largely dormant and underground for over a decade the Dal Khalsa was revived in 1998 after the ban on the organisation had lapsed. The revived Dal Khalsa continues to commit to its original objective of establishing an independent [[Khalistan]]. The main office of the Dal Khalsa is presently based in Amritsar at \"Freedom House\", Sarhadi Complex, Railway Road. The Dal Khalsa has since also established units in the United States and the [[Dal Khalsa UK]] in addition to branches across the Punjab state, India. The revived Dal Khalsa has pledged to put aside armed resistance and further the cause of Khalistan by peaceful and democratic means.\n\nOn 30 September 2005, the co-founder of the Dal Khalsa, Gajinder Singh stepped down as Chairman of the organisation. Satnam Singh Paonta, himself one of the original Dal Khalsa founders, was chosen as the new President on 2 October (2005) at a convention held in [[Chandigarh]]. In addition to Satnam Singh Paonta being chosen as the new leader of the Dal Khalsa, the organization welcomed Jaspal Singh Dhillon, head of the [[Human Rights and Democracy Forum]] into the party fold as its new vice President.\n\nThe new senior leadership of the Dal Khalsa had pledged that it will continue to deploy peaceful methods to achieve an independent [[Khalistan]] but will also take up other socio-political issues faced by the people of Punjab such as education for rural children and tackling the menace of [[Psychoactive drug|drug]] abuse. However, the primary objective of the Dal Khalsa would remain the same and that it will not divert from its original and main goal of establishing an independent and sovereign [[Khalistan]].\n\nIn June 2005, the Dal Khalsa became a constituent member of the Punjab Rights Forum.\n\nCurrently H.S. Dhami is the president of Dal Khalsa, and Kanwarpal Singh is the secretary general. Mr Dhami, 58 who hails from Hoshiarpur is industrialist by profession. He did M.S.C in 1975 from DAV College, Jalandhar and it was the writings and revolutionary poetry of Gajinder Singh that inspired him to join the organization in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dalkhalsa.com/Archives/News/Sep_08/06_Sep_08.html |title=H S Dhami Is Organization'S New Head |publisher=Dal Khalsa |date=6 August 2008 |accessdate=16 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304071915/http://www.dalkhalsa.com/Archives/News/Sep_08/06_Sep_08.html |archive-date=4 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2006 the Vice-President of the Dal Khalsa, Jaspal Singh Dhillon, paid a visit to [[London]], UK where he had been invited to attend and deliver a speech on [[Self-determination]] for [[Khalistan]] at the inaugural launch and conference of a new lobby group called [[Parliamentarians for National Self-Determination]] (PNSD) which was held on 11 May at the [[British Parliament]] in [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]. The Dal Khalsa has sought to work closely with Parliamentarians for National Self-Determination in which the Sikh Nation is one of the founder members.\n\n==Recent activity==\nIn February 2007 the Dal Khalsa broke from its earlier stance regarding the Punjab state legislature by supporting two candidates in the Punjab polls, most notably [[SGPC]] member Karnail Singh Panjoli. During the Punjab legislative assembly elections the Dal Khalsa also supported candidates from the [[Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar)]] led by [[Simranjit Singh Mann]].\n\nIn September, 2008, Dal Khalsa named the expatriate Sikh leader [[Manmohan Singh (Sikh separatist)|Manmohan Singh]] vice president.

Addressing the media over there, party head urged Jathedar Avtar Singh Makkar to break the silence and take the lead as it was high time to lay the foundation stone of the memorial as the Sikh Nation is observing the 26th anniversary of Darbar Sahib on 6 June.\n\nStressing on the need to build memorial, he said by raising the memorial in memory of 'martyrs of the faith', the SGPC would not only deliver a sense of pride and fraternity to their families but also goads the Sikhs to relive those times. Also it will be a rebuttal to those, who have been trying to erase this period from public memory.\n\nActivists mostly youngsters from Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Nawanshahr and Moga participated in the sit-in to show their steadfastness towards the cause and also to pay homage to martyrs.\n\nOn the concluding day (6 June) of its 72 hours sit-in protest, the organization vowed to take the June 84 memorial issue to its logical conclusion. H S Dhami said it's a beginning of the struggle. Our aim was to pay tribute to the 'martyrs of faith' and bring the issue of memorial into limelight, which we had succeeded. He said the silence of Akali leadership about memorial to 1984 martyrs even after 26 years of the deadly attack was disgusting and disappointing.\n\nParty's senior most leader Satnam Singh Paonta Sahib ended his 72 hours fast after performing Ardas at Akal Takht by eating karah parshad.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101001180127/http://dalkhalsa.com/ Official site of the Dal Khalsa]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061205223243/http://www.dalkhalsausa.org/ Official site of the Dal Khalsa of America]\n\n{{Sikhism}}\n{{India separatist movements}}\n\n[[Category:Khalistan movement]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=March 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2014}}\n\n{{Infobox organization\n| name = Dal Khalsa\n| native_name = \u0a26\u0a32 \u0a16\u0a3e\u0a32\u0a38\u0a3e\n| abbreviation = \n| image = \n| caption = \n| type = [[Centrist]] Sikh Sovereignty- Secularist\n| status = banned\n| formation = {{start date and age|1981|03|29|p=y|df=yes}}<ref name=\".. 1981\">{{cite web | title=..:: Dal Khalsa : Constitution ::.. | website=.. | date=6 August 1981 | url=http://www.dalkhalsa.com/AboutUs.html | accessdate=1 October 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927185553/http://www.dalkhalsa.com/AboutUs.html | archive-date=27 September 2015 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n| founder = [[Nawab Kapur Singh]]\n| headquarters = [[Amritsar]], [[Punjab, India]]\n| coordinates = \n| origins = \n| key_people = Kanwarpal Singh ([[Spokesperson]])<ref name=\"Zee News 2014\">{{cite web | title=Dal Khalsa condemns Badal for Hindu-Sikh comment | website=Zee News | date=10 November 2014 | url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/punjab/dal-khalsa-condemns-badal-for-hindu-sikh-comment_1496766.html | language=la | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>\n| region_served = [[India]]\n| language = [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]\n| leader_title = Chief\n| leader_name = \n| main_organ = \n| mission = \"To promote respect, observance and commitment for human rights as enshrined in the Sikh faith\"<ref name=\"..\">{{cite web | title=..:: Dal Khalsa : Constitution ::.. | website=.. | url=http://www.dalkhalsa.com/dkc.html | accessdate=1 October 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212451/http://www.dalkhalsa.com/dkc.html | archive-date=23 September 2015 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n| purpose = [[Sikh Empire|Independent Sikh State]]<ref name=\".. 1978\">{{cite web | title=..:: Dal Khalsa : Constitution ::.. | website=.. | date=6 August 1978 | url=http://www.dalkhalsa.com/AboutUs.html | accessdate=1 October 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927185553/http://www.dalkhalsa.com/AboutUs.html | archive-date=27 September 2015 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n| method = [[Nonviolent resistance]]\n| affiliations = \n| slogan = \n| volunteers = \n| membership = \n| former name = \n| homepage = {{URL|http://www.dalkhalsa.com/}}\n| footnotes = \n}}\n{{Sikhism sidebar}}\n\n'''Dal Khalsa''' is a banned [[Far-Right|Centrist]] Sikh organisation,<ref name=\"Pandher 2015\">{{cite web | last=Pandher | first=Sarabjit | title=Dal Khalsa for deadline to free ex-militants | website=The Hindu | date=3 January 2015 | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dal-khalsa-for-deadline-to-free-exmilitants/article6749385.ece | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref> based in the city of [[Amritsar]].

A number of Sikh Youth organisations had participated in the convention to discuss affairs of the [[Sikh]] Panth. The formation of the Dal Khalsa occurred shortly after an [[wikt:infamous|infamous]] clash between Sikhs belonging to the [[Akhand Kirtani Jatha]] and the followers of a Sikh sect known as the [[Nirankari]]s (whom other Sikhs regard as [[Heresy|heretics]]). This clash had occurred at a Nirankari event at the [[Harmandir Sahib]] in Amritsar on 13 April 1978, in which 3 Nirankaris and 13 Sikhs were killed.<ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.mackenzieinstitute.com/2003/other_peoples_wars2.htm\n |publisher    = The Mackenzie Institute\n |location     = Toronto, Canada\n |title        = Other people's wars: A Review of Overseas Terrorism in Canada\n |date         = 8 June 2003\n |access-date  = 17 July 2005\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20051024120717/http://www.mackenzieinstitute.com/2003/other_peoples_wars2.htm\n |archive-date = 24 October 2005\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nAt its first annual conference held in [[Gurdaspur]] during December, 1979, the Dal Khalsa passed a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] demanding that [[Amritsar]] be officially declared a \"holy city\". A demand that was supported by other Sikh organisations such as the [[Sikh Students Federation]] and one which was later taken up with the Indian government by the [[SGPC]] in 1980. However, the Indian government made no decision on the demand to declare Amritsar a \"holy city\" which prompted the Dal Khalsa and the Sikh Students Federation to organise a procession on 31 May 1981. The [[Hindu]] community was opposed to the demand of declaring Amritsar a \"holy city\" and held their own parallel procession in Amritsar on 29 May 1981.\n\nFor the first time the flag of [[Khalistan]] was hoisted on 1 August 1980, by activists of the Dal Khalsa at the spot in [[Amritsar]] where 13 Sikhs had been killed during a clash with the Nirankaris on 13 April 1978. Shortly after activists of the Dal Khalsa again raised the flag of [[Khalistan]] at various places in the Punjab state during India's Independence day on 15 August 1980.\n\nDuring 1981 the Dal Khalsa along with other [[Sikh]] organisations such as the [[Sikh Students Federation]], [[SGPC]] and [[Shiromani Akali Dal]] demanded associate membership in the [[United Nations]] for the 'Sikh Nation'. Owing largely to the Dal Khalsa a resolution to this effect was passed at the \"Sikh Educational Conference\" held in [[Chandigarh]] on 15 March 1981, which had been organised by the [[Chief Khalsa Diwan]]. During this event American based [[Khalistan]] protagonist, [[Ganga Singh Dhillon]], delivered a speech on why the Sikhs are a [[nation]] and slogans of \"Khalistan Zindabad\" (Long live Khalistan) were raised at the event.\n\n===Activity resulting in a temporary ban on Dal Khalsa===\n\nA 10-year ban was put on the Dal Khalsa by the Indian government in 1982 following militant activities carried out by the organization.<ref name=\"uscis.gov\">http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/INT/HTML/INT/0-0-0-7314/0-0-0-8312.html</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=aVcG7EkuPgAC&pg=PA628&lpg=PA628&dq=%22dal+khalsa%22+1982#v=onepage&q=%22dal%20khalsa%22%20&f=false |title = Historical Dictionary of Terrorism|isbn = 9780810863118|last1 = Sloan|first1 = Stephen|last2 = Anderson|first2 = Sean K.|date = 3 August 2009}}</ref> These included several plane hijackings such as the 1981 hijacking of an Indian Airlines Jetliner (Boeing 737). The plane was hijacked on 29 September 1981, by five members of the Dal Khalsa as a form of protest against the arrest of Sant [[Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale]] who had been accused of being involved in the murder of [[Jalandhar]] based Hindu newspaper owner [[Jagat Narain]] later on Ranjit Singh confessed to murdered Jagat Narain. Ranjit Singh was from Akhand Kirtani Jatha and did not belong to Bhindranwale. The hijackers were under the leadership of Gajinder Singh who a few years later was nominated as Chairman of the organization while on asylum in Pakistan. The Dal Khalsa activists forced the plane to land in [[Lahore]], Pakistan and demanded the release of Sant [[Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale]] in addition to demanding the release of all persons who had been detained in connection with the [[Khalistan]] movement, a ransom of 500,000 dollars and compensation of 100,000 Indian Rupees (Rs.) for the families of each Sikhs that had been killed on 20 September 1981, at Chowk Mehta after the arrest of Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. A day after the hijacking Pakistani commandos arrested the Dal Khalsa activists. The hijackers were identified as Gajinder Singh, Satnam Singh of [[Paonta Sahib]], Jasbir Singh of [[Ropar]], Tejinderpal Singh of [[Jalandhar]] and Karam Singh of [[Jammu]]. Though Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale had never openly or officially associated with the Dal Khalsa the organization was largely seen have had close links with him.\n\nIn January 1982, Harsimran Singh, chief organizer of the Dal Khalsa was arrested from [[Mohali]] near [[Chandigarh]]. The Dal Khalsa leaders believed that his arrest was possible due to a conspiracy by some member of the organization. Harsimran Singh was allegedly tortured by the police and was told that they had the permission of the Government to kill him in a fake encounter near the Indo-Pakistan border. Harsimran Singh was forced to read out a written statement if he wanted to save his life.\n\nSometime during April 1982, two cow heads were severed and placed outside two [[Hindu]] temples in [[Amritsar]] by unknown culprits though the police later blamed it on the Dal Khalsa.<ref name=\"uscis.gov\"/> The incident sparked off a small riot in which a large Hindu crowd gathered at the [[Harmandir Sahib]] and began pelting stones at the most sacred place of the Sikhs. Jaswant Singh Thekedar, who at the time was an activist of the Dal Khalsa, was accused of being involved in the incident and was declared a 'Proclaimed Offender' carrying a reward of Rs. 50,000 on him. He fled to the UK via Nepal in 1983 and was expelled from the Dal Khalsa in 1986 for what were said to be 'anti-party' activities by him.\n\nThe Dal Khalsa and [[National Council of Khalistan]] were banned by the Indian government in May, 1982 after which the Dal Khalsa went underground. Two years later, the Dal Khalsa announced its \"Government in Exile\" in June, 1984.\n\nGajinder Singh, one of the plane hijackers of the Indian Airlines Jetliner (Boeing 737) in 1981, accepted the post of Chairman of the Dal Khalsa in 1986.\n\n==Revival of Dal Khalsa==\nAfter remaining largely dormant and underground for over a decade the Dal Khalsa was revived in 1998 after the ban on the organisation had lapsed. The revived Dal Khalsa continues to commit to its original objective of establishing an independent [[Khalistan]]. The main office of the Dal Khalsa is presently based in Amritsar at \"Freedom House\", Sarhadi Complex, Railway Road. The Dal Khalsa has since also established units in the United States and the [[Dal Khalsa UK]] in addition to branches across the Punjab state, India. The revived Dal Khalsa has pledged to put aside armed resistance and further the cause of Khalistan by peaceful and democratic means.\n\nOn 30 September 2005, the co-founder of the Dal Khalsa, Gajinder Singh stepped down as Chairman of the organisation. Satnam Singh Paonta, himself one of the original Dal Khalsa founders, was chosen as the new President on 2 October (2005) at a convention held in [[Chandigarh]]. In addition to Satnam Singh Paonta being chosen as the new leader of the Dal Khalsa, the organization welcomed Jaspal Singh Dhillon, head of the [[Human Rights and Democracy Forum]] into the party fold as its new vice President.\n\nThe new senior leadership of the Dal Khalsa had pledged that it will continue to deploy peaceful methods to achieve an independent [[Khalistan]] but will also take up other socio-political issues faced by the people of Punjab such as education for rural children and tackling the menace of [[Psychoactive drug|drug]] abuse. However, the primary objective of the Dal Khalsa would remain the same and that it will not divert from its original and main goal of establishing an independent and sovereign [[Khalistan]].\n\nIn June 2005, the Dal Khalsa became a constituent member of the Punjab Rights Forum.\n\nCurrently H.S. Dhami is the president of Dal Khalsa, and Kanwarpal Singh is the secretary general. Mr Dhami, 58 who hails from Hoshiarpur is industrialist by profession.

The Dal Khalsa has sought to work closely with Parliamentarians for National Self-Determination in which the Sikh Nation is one of the founder members.\n\n==Recent activity==\nIn February 2007 the Dal Khalsa broke from its earlier stance regarding the Punjab state legislature by supporting two candidates in the Punjab polls, most notably [[SGPC]] member Karnail Singh Panjoli. During the Punjab legislative assembly elections the Dal Khalsa also supported candidates from the [[Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar)]] led by [[Simranjit Singh Mann]].\n\nIn September, 2008, Dal Khalsa named the expatriate Sikh leader [[Manmohan Singh (Sikh separatist)|Manmohan Singh]] vice president.

Addressing the media over there, party head urged Jathedar Avtar Singh Makkar to break the silence and take the lead as it was high time to lay the foundation stone of the memorial as the Sikh Nation is observing the 26th anniversary of Darbar Sahib on 6 June.\n\nStressing on the need to build memorial, he said by raising the memorial in memory of 'martyrs of the faith', the SGPC would not only deliver a sense of pride and fraternity to their families but also goads the Sikhs to relive those times. Also it will be a rebuttal to those, who have been trying to erase this period from public memory.\n\nActivists mostly youngsters from Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Nawanshahr and Moga participated in the sit-in to show their steadfastness towards the cause and also to pay homage to martyrs.\n\nOn the concluding day (6 June) of its 72 hours sit-in protest, the organization vowed to take the June 84 memorial issue to its logical conclusion. H S Dhami said it's a beginning of the struggle. Our aim was to pay tribute to the 'martyrs of faith' and bring the issue of memorial into limelight, which we had succeeded.

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man.<ref>This sentence is phrased awkwardly.\n\n1. \"Parker's Back\" doesn't take place in Georgia. The setting of \"Parker's Back\" is in Georgia. (This adds clarity to the sentence).\n\n<br /></ref>Later, he developes a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt the wonder and awe he desired; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare place on his body for a tattoo is his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed. In the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions. The book that's in the hands seems to be a gospel book, and it has some jewels on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\nParker\u2019s tattoo of the Byzantine Christ helps him to see the deeper mysteries of God. When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965 in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''.

The tractor is destroyed. In the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions. The book that's in the hands seems to be a gospel book, and it has some jewels on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\nParker\u2019s tattoo of the Byzantine Christ helps him to see the deeper mysteries of God. When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "name_user": "Beilbacher", "label": "safe", "comment": "\"For the first time in his life, Parker felt wonder and awe; he recognized a greater sense of purpose.
