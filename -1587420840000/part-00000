The term itself refers to the traditional transformational analysis of sentences containing leftward [[syntactic movement|movement]] (e.g. [[wh-movement]], [[topicalization]]), whereby it appears as though the fronted constituent crosses over the expression (usually a pronoun) with which it is coindexed on its way to the front of the clause.

Strong crossover occurs when the pronoun is not embedded in another [[Noun phrase|Noun Phrase]] (NP), while Weak crossover occurs when the pronoun is embedded. Shan and Baker (2006)<ref>Shan, C. and Barker, C. 2006. Explaining Crossover and Superiority as Left-to-Right Evaluation.

Weak crossover, on the other hand, is sometimes interpretable and has the ability to be repaired at times. Inserting the word \u201cown\u201d into the embedded NP in 2), for example, will provide a potential grammatical reading: ?'''His<sub>1</sub>''' ''own'' mother likes every '''man<sub>1</sub>'''.\n\nPrimary and Secondary crossover are detailed in Postal (1993)<ref>Postal, P. 1993. Remarks on Weak Crossover Effects. ''Linguistic Inquiry,'' '''''2''4''' (3): 539-556.</ref>; Primary occurs when the [[Operator (linguistics)|operator]] NP is not embedded in another NP, while Secondary requires the operator to be embedded. Postal provides these examples:\n\n# *'''He<sub>1</sub>''' likes every '''man<sub>1</sub>'''. - \u201cman\u201d is not embedded in another NP: primary crossover\n# *'''He<sub>1</sub>''' likes every '''man\u2019s<sub>1</sub>''' mother. - \u201cman\u201d is embedded with \"mother\": secondary crossover\n\n==Examples==\nThe following sentences illustrate crossover phenomena. The a-sentences are questions in which crossover has not occurred and are given here for the sake of comparison, and the b-sentences illustrate crossover. The subscripts mark coindexation (\u2248coreference); they indicate that the words bearing the subscripts are supposed to refer to the same one person. The gaps in the b-sentences mark the canonical position of the wh-expression (before movement):\n\n::a. '''Who<sub>1</sub>''' said '''he<sub>1</sub>''' was hungry? <small>\u2013 Crossover absent, intentional coreferential reading available</small>\n::b. *'''Who<sub>1</sub>''' did '''he<sub>1</sub>''' say '''__<sub>1</sub>''' was hungry. <small>\u2013 Crossover present (strong), intentional coreferential reading unavailable</small>\n\n::a. '''Who<sub>1</sub>''' did you say '''__<sub>1</sub>''' likes '''his<sub>1</sub>''' parents? <small> \u2013 Crossover absent, intentional coreferential reading available</small>\n::b. *'''Who<sub>1</sub>''' did you say '''she<sub>1</sub>''' likes '''__<sub>1</sub>'''? <small>\u2013 Crossover present (strong), intentional coreferential reading unavailable</small>\n\n::a. '''Who<sub>1</sub>''' will call '''his<sub>1</sub>''' mother? <small>\u2013 Crossover absent, coreferential reading available</small>\n::b. ?'''Who<sub>1</sub>''' will '''his<sub>1</sub>''' mother call '''__<sub>1</sub>'''? <small>\u2013 Crossover present (weak), coreferential reading unlikely</small>\n\n::a. '''Which student<sub>1</sub>''' called '''her<sub>1</sub>''' instructor? <small>\u2013 Crossover absent, coreferential reading available</small>  \n::b. ?'''Which student<sub>1</sub>''' did '''her<sub>1</sub>''' instructor call '''__<sub>1</sub>''' <small>- Crossover present (weak), coreferential reading unlikely</small>\n\nThe acceptability contrast here is curious upon first analysis. In both the a- and b-sentences, the order of the wh-expression and the coindexed pronoun is the same, the wh-expression preceding the pronoun. But only the reading indicated with the a-sentences is (fully) possible. The relevant difference is that in the b-sentences, the wh-expression appears to have been moved across the pronoun on its way to the front of the sentence, whereas there is no such crossover in the a-sentences.\n\n==Strong and weak crossover==\nAs just indicated by the examples, there are two types of crossover, strong and weak. The following two sections consider each of these types.\n\n===Strong crossover===\nStrong crossover occurs when the pronoun is in an argument position, i.e. it is an argument of the relevant verb. This means that it is not contained inside a noun phrase. Instances of strong crossover are clearly impossible, that is, the coreferential reading is strongly unavailable, e.g.\n\n::a. *'''Which politician<sub>1</sub>''' did '''she<sub>1</sub>''' say that they should vote for '''__<sub>1</sub>'''? <small>\u2013 Strong crossover, intentional coreferential reading impossible</small>\n\n::b. *'''Who<sub>1</sub>''' do you think '''he<sub>1</sub>''' trusts '''__<sub>1</sub>'''? <small>\u2013 Strong crossover, intentional coreferential reading impossible</small>\n\n::c. *'''Which man<sub>1</sub>''' did '''he<sub>1</sub>''' promise '''__<sub>1</sub>''' would get a promotion? \u2013 <small>Strong crossover, intentional coreferential reading impossible</small>\n\nWhile these sentences are actually grammatical, the reading indicated by the subscripts is robustly unavailable. For instance, the first sentence (sentence a) cannot be interpreted to mean that Susan told them to vote for herself (i.e. Susan).\n\n===Weak crossover===\n\nCrossover is \"weak\" when the coreferential reading is marginal, that is, when the coreferential reading is not clearly unacceptable, but rather just quite unlikely. Typical cases of weak crossover occur when the expression that has been \"crossed over\" is a possessor inside a noun phrase, e.g.\n\n::a. ?'''Which players<sub>1</sub>''' does '''their<sub>1</sub>''' coach distrust '''__<sub>1</sub>'''? <small>\u2013 Weak crossover, indicated reading possible, but unlikely</small>\n\n::b. ?'''Which beer<sub>1</sub>''' does '''its<sub>1</sub>''' brewer never advertise '''__<sub>1</sub>'''? <small>\u2013 Weak crossover, indicated reading possible, but unlikely</small>\n\n::c. ?'''Who<sub>1</sub>''' do '''her<sub>1</sub>''' parents worship '''__<sub>1</sub>'''?  <small>\u2013 Weak crossover, indicated reading possible, but unlikely</small>\n\nThe pronoun that has been crossed over in each of these examples is embedded inside a noun phrase. Such cases of crossover are not impossible, but rather just unlikely. Koopman & Sportiche (1983) attribute the judgements on coreference with respect to weak crossover to the Bijection Principle: \u201cThere is a bijective correspondence between variables and A-positions. (That is, each operator must A-bind exactly one variable, and each variable must be A-bound by exactly one operator.)\u201d<ref> Koopman, H. & Sportiche, D. 1983. \"Variables and the Bijection Principle\"</ref>\nIn the examples above, neither the trace (T), represented by the gap, nor the pronoun (P) binds the other as the pronoun is contained within a noun phrase. Therefore, the operator locally binds both T and P, meaning that it binds two variables and violates the Bijection Principle. However, weak crossover effects are absent when the pronoun is contained within an adjunct phrase, for example:\n:a.) '''Who'''<sub>'''1'''</sub> did you say  '''__'''<sub>'''1'''</sub> was a liar before you met '''him'''<sub>'''1'''</sub>? - Weak crossover absent, coreferential reading possible\n\nBased on this observation, Stowell proposes the following analysis of weak crossover: \u201cIn a configuration where a quantifier Q locally binds a pronoun P and a trace T, P may not be contained in an argument phrase XP that c-commands T.\u201d<ref>Lasnik,H. & Stowell,T. 1991. Weakest Crossover.</ref>\n\n===Interaction of Weak Crossover with Other Phenomena===\n\nThere are certain syntactic phenomena in which we would expect weak crossover effects to arise, however we find that they are absent and a coreferential reading is possible, eg.\n\na.) [[Parasitic gap]]s\n:'''Who'''<sub>'''1'''</sub> did Susan gossip about '''__'''<sub>'''1'''</sub> despite '''his'''<sub>'''1'''</sub> boss having vouched for '''__'''<sub>'''1'''</sub>?\n\nb.) [[Tough movement]]\n:'''Which girl'''<sub>'''1'''</sub> will be easy to persuade '''her'''<sub>'''1'''</sub> teacher to vouch for '''__'''<sub>'''1'''</sub>?\n\nThese constructions indicate the complexity involved with respect to whether a coreferential reading is possible and why this is of interest to linguists. There are different possible analyses of why weak crossover effects do not arise in these constructions.  One approach is to reanalyze the binding relations between pronouns and quantifiers in such constructions. Another approach is to revise the principles underlying weak crossover to account for why weak crossover effects do not occur in these environments.<ref>Lasnik,H. & Stowell,T. 1991. Weakest Crossover.</ref>\n\n==Comments==\nCrossover is a particular manifestation of [[Binding (linguistics)|binding]], which is one of the most explored and discussed areas of theoretical syntax. The factors that determine when the coreferential reading is possible have been extensively debated. Simple linear order plays a role, but the other key factor might be [[c-command]] as associated (primarily) with [[government and binding]], or it might be o-command as associated with [[head-driven phrase structure grammar]].\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Binding (linguistics)|Binding]]\n*[[c-command]]\n*[[Coreference]]\n*[[Parasitic gap]]\n*[[Syntactic movement]]\n*[[Wh-movement]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Adesola, O. 2006.

They are mountainous and forested, lying south of [[Ternate]] and southwest of [[Halmahera]]. The islands are administered by the [[South Halmahera Regency]] of [[North Maluku]] [[provinces of Indonesia|Province]].\n\n'''Bacan''' ({{lang-nl|Batjan}}),{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=132}} formerly also known as '''Bachian'''{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=132}} or '''Batchian''',<ref>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 9th ed., Index, p.&nbsp;39. 1889.</ref> is the group's largest island. The second and third largest islands are Kasiruta and Mandioli.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Bacan includes about 60,000 people of which about 8,000 live in the capital Labuha; it is subdivided into 7 districts. Kasiruta and Mandioli each have over 8,000 inhabitants, and each is subdivided into 2 districts. A fourth island, Batan Lomang, forms a 12th district within the group. There are dozens of smaller islands in the group, which had a total population of 84,075 at the 2010 Census.<ref>Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1513, the first Portuguese trading fleet to reach the [[Moluccas]] set up a trading post on Bacan which at the time was subservient to the [[Sultan of Ternate]]. The fleet's commander, Captain Antonio de Miranda Azevedo, left seven men on Bacan to buy cloves for the following year's expedition. Their arrogant behaviour and reported bad treatment of Bacan women led to their murder. As Ternate did not have enough stock, the ship for which the men had stayed to prepare was used by the Sultan of Ternate to fill [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s last ship, which was the first ship to circumnavigate the world. A slave and two birds of paradise were given to the ship by Bacan. Bacan became a place of refuge for rebellious Ternateans. The Portuguese sent a punitive expedition against Bacan  but it failed, and instead the Portuguese Governor Galv\u00e3o challenged Bacan's sultan to a duel to determine who was to be subservient to whom. The challenge was accepted but the duel never took place.<ref name=m130/>\n\nIn 1557, Father Antonio Vaz converted Bacan's sultan and court members to Catholicism. The king was married to a daughter of Sultan [[Hairun]] of Ternate. Fleets from Ternate invaded the islands in 1570 and later and the king apostatized in 1575, though he was nevertheless poisoned in 1578. A community of Christians remained and were later joined by coreligionists from [[Tobelo]] and [[Ambon Island|Ambon]]. A small Roman Catholic hospital was built by an elderly Dutch nun. Today, Protestants significantly outnumber Catholics. During the mid-19th century Moluccan travels of British naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], Christians in the Moluccas were called ''{{lang|id|Orang Sirani}}'' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"[[Nasrani (Arabic term for Christian)|Nazarene]] People\"), a term regularly applied to locals of European ancestry in the Malay Archipelago, thought to have been descended from the Portuguese.  They had dressed in white and black and Wallace reports they dance \"quadrilles, waltzes, polkas, and mazurkas with great vigour and much skill\".<ref name=m130>Muller (1997), p. 130.</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1575 Ternatean invasion, Bacan appears to have become subservient to Ternate, which was sealed through marriages. A sister and a daughter of Sultan [[Saidi Berkat]] of Ternate married Bacan rulers in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. A Spanish fort was built in 1606. Once the Dutch established hegemony in the 17th century, the Netherlands' power on Bacan was based in Fort Barnaveld.<ref name=m130/>\n\nIn 1705, the sergeant in charge of the fort and the sultan captured the English explorer [[William Dampier]], seized his ship, looted its cargo, and threatened all aboard with execution. It is thought that this was in response to Dampier violating the trade monopoly.

They are mountainous and forested, lying south of [[Ternate]] and southwest of [[Halmahera]].

The second and third largest islands are Kasiruta and Mandioli.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Bacan includes about 60,000 people of which about 8,000 live in the capital Labuha; it is subdivided into 7 districts. Kasiruta and Mandioli each have over 8,000 inhabitants, and each is subdivided into 2 districts. A fourth island, Batan Lomang, forms a 12th district within the group. There are dozens of smaller islands in the group, which had a total population of 84,075 at the 2010 Census.<ref>Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1513, the first Portuguese trading fleet to reach the [[Moluccas]] set up a trading post on Bacan which at the time was subservient to the [[Sultan of Ternate]]. The fleet's commander, Captain Antonio de Miranda Azevedo, left seven men on Bacan to buy cloves for the following year's expedition. Their arrogant behaviour and reported bad treatment of Bacan women led to their murder. As Ternate did not have enough stock, the ship for which the men had stayed to prepare was used by the Sultan of Ternate to fill [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s last ship, which was the first ship to circumnavigate the world. A slave and two birds of paradise were given to the ship by Bacan. Bacan became a place of refuge for rebellious Ternateans. The Portuguese sent a punitive expedition against Bacan  but it failed, and instead the Portuguese Governor Galv\u00e3o challenged Bacan's sultan to a duel to determine who was to be subservient to whom. The challenge was accepted but the duel never took place.<ref name=m130/>\n\nIn 1557, Father Antonio Vaz converted Bacan's sultan and court members to Catholicism. The king was married to a daughter of Sultan [[Hairun]] of Ternate. Fleets from Ternate invaded the islands in 1570 and later and the king apostatized in 1575, though he was nevertheless poisoned in 1578. A community of Christians remained and were later joined by coreligionists from [[Tobelo]] and [[Ambon Island|Ambon]]. A small Roman Catholic hospital was built by an elderly Dutch nun. Today, Protestants significantly outnumber Catholics. During the mid-19th century Moluccan travels of British naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], Christians in the Moluccas were called ''{{lang|id|Orang Sirani}}'' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"[[Nasrani (Arabic term for Christian)|Nazarene]] People\"), a term regularly applied to locals of European ancestry in the Malay Archipelago, thought to have been descended from the Portuguese.  They had dressed in white and black and Wallace reports they dance \"quadrilles, waltzes, polkas, and mazurkas with great vigour and much skill\".<ref name=m130>Muller (1997), p. 130.</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1575 Ternatean invasion, Bacan appears to have become subservient to Ternate, which was sealed through marriages. A sister and a daughter of Sultan [[Saidi Berkat]] of Ternate married Bacan rulers in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. A Spanish fort was built in 1606. Once the Dutch established hegemony in the 17th century, the Netherlands' power on Bacan was based in Fort Barnaveld.<ref name=m130/>\n\nIn 1705, the sergeant in charge of the fort and the sultan captured the English explorer [[William Dampier]], seized his ship, looted its cargo, and threatened all aboard with execution. It is thought that this was in response to Dampier violating the trade monopoly. When the sergeant's Dutch superiors heard of the incident, Dampier was released, his ship restored and the English provided with sumptuous hospitality in Ternate.<ref name=\"Muller 1997, p. 131\">Muller (1997), p. 131.</ref> The chief town at the time, also known as '''Bachian''', was Amasing or Amasingkota on the island's isthmus.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}\n\nTernate and Bacan were the only places in the northern Moluccas that had a Dutch curriculum school and a Protestant minister in the late 19th century.

The group now constitutes five districts (''kecamatan'') within the [[Maluku Barat Daya]] Regency of Maluku province.\n\nTepa (a town with a population of about 2,000 people) is the administrative center of the Babar Islands district (\"Kecamatan Pulau-Pulau Babar\") now reduced to encompass only the western half of Babar Island together with Dai Island (to the north of Babar). Wetang Island (lying to the west of Babar) now forms a separate district. The town of Letwurung on the east side of Babar island is the capital of the district called \"East Babar\" (\"Kecamatan Pulau-Pulau Babar Timor\") in the east half of the Babar Islands, consisting of the East half of Babar Island. Masela Island (to the south-east of Babar) forms a separate district, as do the islands of Dawelor and Dawera (to the east). The archipelago covers a land area of 2,224&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and had 17,406 inhabitants at the 2010 Census.<ref>Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2018.</ref>\n\n==Central island==\nThe islands take their name from the large central island of Babar which is roughly {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=flip}} across and a circumference of {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=flip}}. Babar Island has a maximum elevation of approximately 750 meters and is lightly covered with sub-tropical montane forest, although the 5 rivers and 2 large year-round springs afford tropical forest in their narrow ravine courses.\n\n===Topography===\nThe topography of all the Babar islands is distinctive for their marked stepped appearance, the result of a combination of periodic uplifting of the [[tectonic]] plate interacting with the erosive action of the constant ocean waves. Water action on the coral base over the millennia has created many caves and shafts.\n\n===Agriculture and fisheries===\nRain is plentiful from December to July so corn, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], bananas, [[cassava]], various tubers and red rice (unirrigated) grow plentifully. Fish is the main source of protein. Sufficient potable water on Babar Island is provided by year round springs and shallow wells. [[Coconut oil]] is important for consumption while the oily meat called copra, is sold. Other items harvested and sold for export are sea shells, sea weed, [[sea cucumbers]], shark fins, live lizards and birds, cattle, cashews, nutmeg, cloves and [[eucalyptus oil]].\n\n==Smaller islands==\nThis situation contrasts markedly with the much smaller islands ringing Babar Island. These are low-lying, uplifted [[reef]] and [[limestone]] (with the exception of Dai Island, which is largely [[granite]]), infertile, not heavily forested and lacking in fresh water sources. The more difficult environment leads the indigenous inhabitants to focus more of their energies on fishing and hand-crafts which are then traded for garden produce from Babar Island. The people collect rain water in large above ground [[cisterns]] which can last them through the driest time of the year (September to December). When the [[drought]] is longer than usual the water in these tanks is exhausted and the people have to walk miles to the few villages with springs or wells, and queue up for a turn to draw a few liters of water. People camp overnight beside the well waiting their turn. The Indonesian government has provided funds for many more collection tanks for rain water, so the situation has improved markedly in the last few years.\n\n==Transport==\nThere is no airport or landing strip in the Babar Islands. Small freighters that have contracts to carry passengers service the islands. It is a minimum twelve-hour ride to the nearest city with an airport where one can catch a commercial flight to other towns in Maluku - these airports being at [[Tual, Maluku|Tual]], [[Larat]], Wonreli ([[Kisar]]) and [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]].\n\n==People==\nIn comparison to the majority of Indonesians living nearer the political centre of the country, the indigenous Babar Islanders tend to darker [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] [[pigmentation]], have kinky hair and generally lack the [[epicanthic eyefold]] of East Asians.\n\n==Religion==\nMost indigenous Babar Islanders are [[baptised]] into the [[Protestant Church]] of Maluku (Gereja Protestan Maluku, GPM). The GPM's roots are in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] started by the Dutch colonists. Due undoubtedly to the aridity of the islands and the lack of natural resources, there has been no mass [[Transmigration program|transmigration]] from more populous Indonesian areas.  In Tepa, there are 3 other denominations with church buildings: a [[Catholic]] church, a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] church, and a [[Pentecostal]] church. There is also a [[mosque]] in Tepa that serves the small community of [[Muslims]].

The group now constitutes five districts (''kecamatan'') within the [[Maluku Barat Daya]] Regency of Maluku province. \n\nTepa (a town with a population of about 2,000 people) is the administrative center of the Babar Islands district (\"Kecamatan Pulau-Pulau Babar\") now reduced to encompass only the western half of Babar Island together with Dai Island (to the north of Babar). Wetang Island (lying to the west of Babar) now forms a separate district. The town of Letwurung on the east side of Babar island is the capital of the district called \"East Babar\" (\"Kecamatan Pulau-Pulau Babar Timor\") in the east half of the Babar Islands, consisting of the East half of Babar Island. Masela Island (to the south-east of Babar) forms a separate district, as do the islands of Dawelor and Dawera (to the east). The archipelago covers a land area of 2,224 km<sup>2</sup> and had 17,406 inhabitants at the 2010 Census.<ref>Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2018.</ref>\n\n==Central island==\nThe islands take their name from the large central island of Babar which is roughly {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=flip}} across and a circumference of {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=flip}}. Babar Island has a maximum elevation of approximately 750 meters and is lightly covered with sub-tropical montane forest, although the 5 rivers and 2 large year-round springs afford tropical forest in their narrow ravine courses.\n\n===Topography===\nThe topography of all the Babar islands is distinctive for their marked stepped appearance, the result of a combination of periodic uplifting of the [[tectonic]] plate interacting with the erosive action of the constant ocean waves. Water action on the coral base over the millennia has created many caves and shafts.\n\n===Agriculture and fisheries===\nRain is plentiful from December to July so corn, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], bananas, [[cassava]], various tubers and red rice (unirrigated) grow plentifully. Fish is the main source of protein. Sufficient potable water on Babar Island is provided by year round springs and shallow wells. [[Coconut oil]] is important for consumption while the oily meat called copra, is sold. Other items harvested and sold for export are sea shells, sea weed, [[sea cucumbers]], shark fins, live lizards and birds, cattle, cashews, nutmeg, cloves and [[eucalyptus oil]].\n\n==Smaller islands==\nThis situation contrasts markedly with the much smaller islands ringing Babar Island. These are low-lying, uplifted [[reef]] and [[limestone]] (with the exception of Dai Island, which is largely [[granite]]), infertile, not heavily forested and lacking in fresh water sources. The more difficult environment leads the indigenous inhabitants to focus more of their energies on fishing and hand-crafts which are then traded for garden produce from Babar Island. The people collect rain water in large above ground [[cisterns]] which can last them through the driest time of the year (September to December). When the [[drought]] is longer than usual the water in these tanks is exhausted and the people have to walk miles to the few villages with springs or wells, and queue up for a turn to draw a few liters of water. People camp overnight beside the well waiting their turn. The Indonesian government has provided funds for many more collection tanks for rain water, so the situation has improved markedly in the last few years.\n\n==Transport==\nThere is no airport or landing strip in the Babar Islands. Small freighters that have contracts to carry passengers service the islands. It is a minimum twelve-hour ride to the nearest city with an airport where one can catch a commercial flight to other towns in Maluku - these airports being at [[Tual, Maluku|Tual]], [[Larat]], Wonreli ([[Kisar]]) and [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]].\n\n==People==\nIn comparison to the majority of Indonesians living nearer the political centre of the country, the indigenous Babar Islanders tend to darker [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] [[pigmentation]], have kinky hair and generally lack the [[epicanthic eyefold]] of East Asians.\n\n==Religion==\nMost indigenous Babar Islanders are [[baptised]] into the [[Protestant Church]] of Maluku (Gereja Protestan Maluku, GPM). The GPM's roots are in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] started by the Dutch colonists. Due undoubtedly to the aridity of the islands and the lack of natural resources, there has been no mass [[Transmigration program|transmigration]] from more populous Indonesian areas.  In Tepa, there are 3 other denominations with church buildings: a [[Catholic]] church, a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] church, and a [[Pentecostal]] church. There is also a [[mosque]] in Tepa that serves the small community of [[Muslims]]. All the other towns have one GPM church each, totaling 56 GPM churches in the entire GPM diocese of Babar islands (\"Klasis GPM Pulau-pulau Babar\"). While these world faiths are represented, there is much hybridization with the preexisting [[animist]] beliefs and practices.

There are 22 islands and numerous rocks in the group, with [[Cunda Island]], now a peninsula,  being the largest. People live only on Cunda and Lale Islands. Cunda and Lale islands are linked to Ayval\u0131k on the mainland, by a causeway enabling transportation by car. Cunda also has a ferry link from the main town, Alibey, to Ayval\u0131k during the summer.\n\nA [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] metropolis was established, based in Cunda island, for some months in 1922.<ref name=Kiminas>{{cite book|last=Kiminas|first=Demetrius|title=The Ecumenical Patriarchate|year=2009|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=9781434458766|pages=69|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=QLWqXrW2X-8C&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=bishop+ayvalik+turkish+1922&source=bl&ots=t5KIKaD8-z&sig=w896o0W2qVQgJ74TcQzd2HxwNMg&hl=el&sa=X&ei=_dB5UNu9DdCk4ATtwYDICg&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=orologas&f=false}}</ref>\n\nWild life can be observed on the other islands, especially wild rabbits on Ilyosta Island. Also, those islands are the main points of interest to tourists as having small beaches and bays.\n\n== List of islands ==\n\nAyval\u0131k Islands are also referred to as Yund Islands or Cunda Islands in some sources.

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man.<ref>This sentence is phrased awkwardly.\n\n1. \"Parker's Back\" doesn't take place in Georgia. The setting of \"Parker's Back\" is in Georgia. (This adds clarity to the sentence).\n\n<br /></ref>Later, he developes a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker dislikes Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt the wonder and awe he desired; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decided that they were worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos: He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare area for a tattoo was on his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed, resulting in a fire that destroys both machine and tree. Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith.\" Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nWhen he arrives home, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to see that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]].

In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring.

A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. O'Connor is known to use irony throughout her stories, for example: Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of getting a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to help tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are reflections of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965, in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''. O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man.<ref>This sentence is phrased awkwardly.\n\n1. \"Parker's Back\" doesn't take place in Georgia. The setting of \"Parker's Back\" is in Georgia. (This adds clarity to the sentence).\n\n<br /></ref>Later, he developes a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker dislikes Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt the wonder and awe he desired; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decided that they were worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos: He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare area for a tattoo was on his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed, resulting in a fire that destroys both machine and tree. Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith.\" Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nWhen he arrives home, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to see that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ.
