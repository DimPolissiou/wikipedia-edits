Since 2011, Riot Games also operates various esports tournaments for the game, including the [[League of Legends World Championship|''League of Legends'' World Championship]], the [[League of Legends Championship Series|Championship Series]], the [[League of Legends European Championship|European Championship]], and the [[Mid-Season Invitational]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Riot Games (2006).svg|thumb|The original Riot Games logo, used from 2006 to 2019]]\nRiot Games' founders, Brandon \"Ryze\" Beck and Marc \"Tryndamere\" Merrill, became friends while business students and roommates at the [[University of Southern California]], where they bonded over video games.<ref name=\"Kollar16\">{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/13/12891656/the-past-present-and-future-of-league-of-legends-studio-riot-games |title=The past, present and future of League of Legends studio Riot Games |first=Phil |last=Kollar |date=September 13, 2016 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |access-date=June 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612194103/https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/13/12891656/the-past-present-and-future-of-league-of-legends-studio-riot-games |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Beck and Merrill were frustrated because they felt game developers were not listening to fans.<ref name=\"Kollar16\" /> Developers, they believed, moved from game to game too quickly, leaving their passionate communities behind.<ref name=\"Kollar16\" /> During their time playing video games together, Beck and Merrill created an idea for a company that continually introduced new features to its games.<ref name=\"Blakely16\">{{cite web |url=https://www.inc.com/magazine/201612/burt-helm-lindsay-blakely/company-of-the-year-riot-games.html |title=Why Riot Games Is Inc.'s 2016 Company of the Year |first1=Lindsay |last1=Blakely |first2=Burt |last2=Helm |date=December 2016 |website=[[Inc.

Sunday is a day of rest in most Western countries, and a part of the [[weekend]]. In some Eastern countries such as [[Israel]] Sunday is part of the weekdays. \n\nFor most observant Christians, Saturday is observed as a day of worship and rest, holding it as the [[Lord's Day]] and the day of Christ's resurrection. In some China countries and [[Israel]], Sunday is the first work day of the week.  According to the [[Hebrew calendar]] and traditional Christian calendars, Sunday is the first day of the week.<ref>Cf., e.g., Matt. 28:1 at https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/Matthew#Chapter_28 </ref> But according to the [[International Organization for Standardization]] [[ISO 8601]], Sunday is the seventh day of the week.<ref>\n\n\"Monday shall be identified as calendar day [1] of any calendar week, and subsequent calendar days of the same calendar week shall be numbered in ascending sequence to Sunday (calendar day [7]).\"\nFurther discussion: UK National Physical Laboratory: \"Which is the first day of the week?

During the 1st and 2nd century, the week of seven days was introduced into [[Rome]] from [[Egypt]], and the Roman names of the planets were given to each successive day.\n\n[[Germanic peoples]] seem to have adopted the [[week]] as a division of time from the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], but they changed the Roman names into those of corresponding [[Teutons|Teutonic]] [[deities]]. Hence, the ''dies Solis'' became Sunday (German, ''Sonntag'').\n\nThe English noun ''Sunday'' derived sometime before 1250 from ''sunedai'', which itself developed from [[Old English]] (before 700) ''Sunnand\u00e6g'' (literally meaning \"[[sun]]'s day\"), which is cognate to other [[Germanic languages]], including [[Old Frisian]] ''sunnandei'', [[Old Saxon]] ''sunnundag'', [[Middle Dutch]] ''sonnendach'' (modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''zondag''), [[Old High German]] ''sunnun tag'' (modern [[German language|German]] ''Sonntag''), and [[Old Norse]] ''sunnudagr'' ([[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''s\u00f8ndag'', [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''sunnudagur'' and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''s\u00f6ndag''). The Germanic term is a [[Interpretatio graeca|Germanic interpretation]] of [[Latin]] ''dies solis'' (\"day of the sun\"), which is a translation of the [[Ancient Greek]] ''hem\u00e9ra hel\u00edou''.<ref name=BARNHART778>Barnhart (1995:778).</ref>\nThe [[p-Celtic]] [[Welsh language]] also translates the Latin \"day of the sun\" as ''dydd Sul''.\n\nIn most [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], the word for Sunday is ''Raviv\u0101ra'' or ''Adityav\u0101ra'' or its derived forms \u2014 ''v\u0101ra'' meaning day, ''Aditya'' and ''Ravi'' both being a [[style (manner of address)]] for [[Surya]] i.e. the [[Sun]] and [[Suryadeva]] the chief [[solar deity]] and one of the [[Aditya]]s. Raviv\u0101ra is first day cited in [[Jyotisha]], which provides logical reason for giving the name of each week day. In the [[Thai solar calendar]] of [[Thailand]], the name (\"Waan Arthit\") is derived from Aditya, and the associated colour is [[red]].\n\nIn [[Russian language|Russian]] the word for Sunday is \u0412\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435 (Voskreseniye) meaning \"[[Resurrection]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seminarzkr.narod.ru/kalendar/pages/01_mir/pr_00_nedelja.html|title=\u0414\u041d\u0418 \u041d\u0415\u0414\u0415\u041b\u0418 - \u0421\u041b\u0410\u0412\u042f\u041d\u0421\u041a\u0410\u042f \u0421\u0415\u0414\u042c\u041c\u0418\u0426\u0410 | accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref> In other [[Slavic languages]] the word means \"no work\", for example Polish: Niedziela, Ukrainian: \u041d\u0435\u0434i\u043b\u044f, Belorussian: \u041d\u044f\u0434\u0437\u0435\u043b\u044f, Croatian: nedjelja, Serbian and Slovenian: Nedelja, Czech: Ned\u011ble, and Bulgarian: \u041d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f.\n\nThe [[Modern Greek]] word for Sunday, {{lang-el|\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae}}, is derived from {{lang-el|\u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2}} ([[Kyrios]], Lord) also, due to its liturgical significance as the day commemorating [[Resurrection of Jesus|the resurrection of Jesus Christ]], i.e. [[Lord's Day|The Lord's Day]].\n\nIn Korean, Sunday is called \uc77c\uc694\uc77c Il-yo-Il, meaning \"day of sun\". In Japanese, Sunday is \u65e5\u66dc\u65e5 Nichiy\u014dbi, which translates to \"sun day\".\n\nThe [[Arabic]] word for Sunday is \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f (Al-Ahad), which means \"The first\".

A number of languages express this position either by the name for the day or by the naming of the other days. In Hebrew it is called \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df ''yom rishon'', in Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f ''al-ahad'', in Persian and related languages \u06cc\u06a9\u0634\u0646\u0628\u0647 ''yek-shanbe'', all meaning \"first\".\n\nIn [[Greek language|Greek]], the names of the days Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday (\"\u0394\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\", \"\u03a4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\", \"\u03a4\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\" and \"\u03a0\u03ad\u03bc\u03c0\u03c4\u03b7\") mean \"second\", \"third\", \"fourth\", and \"fifth\" respectively. This leaves Sunday in the first position of the week count. The current Greek name for Sunday, ''\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae'' (Kyriake), means \"Lord's Day\" coming from the word ''\u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2'' (Kyrios), which is the Greek word for \"Lord\". Similarly in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], where the days from Monday to Friday are counted as \"segunda-feira\", \"ter\u00e7a-feira\", \"quarta-feira\", \"quinta-feira\" and \"sexta-feira\", while Sunday itself similar to Greek has the name of \"Lord's Day\" (\"domingo\"). In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the working days in the week are named as: \"Th\u1ee9 Hai\" (second day), \"Th\u1ee9 Ba\" (third day), \"Th\u1ee9 T\u01b0\" (fourth day), \"Th\u1ee9 N\u0103m\" (fifth day), \"Th\u1ee9 S\u00e1u\" (sixth day), \"Th\u1ee9 B\u1ea3y\" (seventh day). Sunday is called \"Ch\u1ee7 Nh\u1eadt\", a corrupted form of \"Ch\u00faa Nh\u1eadt\" meaning \"Lord's Day\". Some colloquial text in the south of [[Vietnam]] and from the church may still use the old form to mean Sunday.  In [[German language|German]], Wednesday is called \"Mittwoch\", literally \"mid-week\", implying that weeks run from Sunday to Saturday.\n\nThe name is similar in the [[Romance Languages]]. In [[Italian language|Italian]], Sunday is called \"domenica\", which also means \"Lord's Day\" (from Latin \"Dies Dominica\"). One finds similar cognates in [[French language|French]], where the name is \"dimanche\", as well as [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (\"duminic\u0103\") and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (\"domingo\").\n\n[[Slavic languages]] implicitly number Monday as day number one, not two. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! \n!

In Old Russian Sunday was also called ''\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f'' \"free day\" or \"day with no work\", but in the contemporary language this word means \"week\".\n[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''p\u00e9ntek'' (Friday) is a Slavic [[loanword]], so the correlation with \"five\" is not evident to Hungarians. Hungarians use ''Vas\u00e1rnap'' for Sunday, which means \"market day\". \n\nIn the [[Maltese language]], due to its [[Siculo-Arabic]] origin, Sunday is called \"Il-\u0126add\", a corruption of \"wie\u0127ed\" meaning \"one\". Monday is \"It-Tnejn\" meaning \"two\". Similarly Tuesday is \"It-Tlieta\" (three), Wednesday is \"L-Erbg\u0127a\" (four) and Thursday is \"Il-\u0126amis\" (five).\n\nIn [[Armenian language|Armenian]], Monday is (Yerkoushabti) literally meaning 2nd day of the week, Tuesday (Yerekshabti) 3rd day, Wednesday (Chorekshabti) 4th day, Thursday (Hingshabti) 5th day. Saturday is (Shabat) coming from the word Sabbath or Shabbath in Hebrew, and \"Kiraki\" coming from the word \"Krak\" meaning \"fire\" is Sunday, \"Krak\" describing the sun by fire. Apostle John also refers to the \"Lord's Day\" (in [[Greek language|Greek]], ''\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u1f21\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1'', \"kyriake hemera\" i.e. the day of the Lord) in Rev. 1:10, which is another possible origin of the Armenian word for Sunday.\n\nHowever, in many European countries calendars almost always show Monday as the first day of the week,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/weekinfo.htm#TSW |title=Calendar Weeks |author=J. R. Stockton |accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref> which follows the [[ISO 8601]] standard.\n\nIn the [[Persian calendar]], Sunday is the second day of the week. However, it is called \"number one\" as counting starts from zero; the first day - Saturday - is denoted as 00.\n\n<span id=\"Sunday_and_the_Sabbath\"></span>\n\n==Sunday in Christianity==\n\n===Pagan correspondence===\n\nIn Roman culture, Sunday was the day of the Sun god. In paganism, the Sun was a source of life, giving warmth and illumination to mankind. It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed.{{Dubious| Is this in source given, Chadwick's book? I don't have the book at hand, and I don't think it particularly implausible, but I have never heard of such a Roman custom and wouldn't think it is altogether implausible either to suppose that to the Sabbatarian propagandists roaming about this article invented such a custom.|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe opportunity to spot in the nature-worship of their heathen neighbors a symbolism valid to their own faith was not lost on the Christians. One of the Church fathers, [[St. Jerome]], would declare: \"If pagans call [the Lord's Day] [...] the 'day of the sun,' we willingly agree, for today the light of the world is raised, today is revealed the sun of justice with healing in his rays.\"<ref>St. Jerome, Pasch.: CCL 78, 550, as quoted in: [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|CCC]] 1166.</ref>\n\nA similar consideration may have influenced the choice of the [[Christmas|Christmas date]] on the day of the winter solstice, whose celebration was part of the Roman cult of the Sun.{{Dubious|Again, on 25th December was certainly the Sol Invictus feast and possibly a Mithraic feast, but neither cult is ''Roman cult'' properly speaking. Whether the ancient Romans, who by the way were not Germanics, laid much importance on the winter solstice only a few days before or after their ''Saturnalia'' seems dubious to me. My guess would be that the source means the Sol-invictus-feast, but it would be wrong to describe this as \"Roman cult\".|date=July 2017}}<ref>{{cite book|author=Owen Chadwick|title=A History of Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qugouOh3KjMC&pg=PA22|year=1998|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=22}}</ref> In the same vein, Christian churches have been built and are still being built (as far as possible) with an orientation so that the congregation faced toward the sunrise in the East. Much later, [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] would sing in his famous [[Canticle of the Sun|canticle]]: \"Be praised, my Lord, through all your creatures, especially through my lord Brother Sun, who brings the day; and you give light through him. And he is beautiful and radiant in all his splendor! Of you, Most High, he bears the likeness.\"\n\n===Christian usage===\n{{See also|Sabbath in Christianity}}\n\nThe ancient Romans traditionally used the eight-day [[Nundinae|nundinal cycle]], a market week, but in the time of [[Augustus]] in the 1st century AD, a seven-day week also came into use.\n\n[[Justin Martyr]], in the mid [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], mentions \"memoirs of the apostles\" as being read on \"the day called that of the sun\" (Sunday) alongside the \"writings of the prophets.\" <ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Citation | first = Justin | last = Martyr | title = [[First Apology]] | at = 67.3}}.</ref>\n\nOn 7 March 321, [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], Rome's first Christian Emperor (see [[Constantine I and Christianity]]), decreed that Sunday would be observed as the Roman day of rest:<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last = Zerubavel\n| first = Eviatar\n| title = The Seven Day Circle: The History and Meaning of the Week\n| publisher = University of Chicago Press\n| date = 1989\n| page = 45\n| isbn = 9780226981659}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|On the venerable Day of the Sun let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed.

It also indicates that Jews were observing the Sabbath on the Saturday.\n\n===Modern practices===\nSome Christian denominations, called \"[[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Sabbatarians]]\", observe a [[Saturday Sabbath]]. The name \"Sabbatarian\" has also been claimed by Christians, especially Protestants, who believe Sunday must be observed with just the sort of rigorous abstinence from work associated with \"[[Shabbat]]\". Christians in the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Seventh Day Baptist]], and [[Church of God (disambiguation)#Sabbatarian Churches of God|Church of God]] (Seventh-Day) denominations, as well as many [[Messianic Jews]], have maintained the practice of abstaining from work and gathering for worship on Saturdays (sunset to sunset) as did all of the followers of God in the Bible.\n\nFor most Christians the custom and obligation of Sunday rest is not as strict. A minority of Christians do not regard the day they attend church as important, so long as they attend. There is considerable variation in the observance of Sabbath rituals and restrictions, but some cessation of normal weekday activities is customary. Many Christians today observe Sunday as a day of church-attendance.\n\nIn [[Roman Catholic]] liturgy, Sunday begins on Saturday evening. The evening Mass on Saturday is liturgically a full Sunday Mass and fulfills the obligation of Sunday Mass attendance, and [[Vespers]] (evening prayer) on Saturday night is liturgically \"first Vespers\" of the Sunday. The same evening anticipation applies to other major solemnities and feasts, and is an echo of the Jewish practice of starting the new day at sunset. Those who work in the medical field, in law enforcement, and soldiers in a war zone are dispensed from the usual obligation to attend Church on Sunday. They are encouraged to combine their work with attending religious services if possible.\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], Sunday begins at the [[Little Entrance]] of Vespers (or [[All-Night Vigil]]) on Saturday evening and runs until \"Vouchsafe, O Lord\" (after the \"[[prokeimenon]]\") of Vespers on Sunday night. During this time, the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] at all services begin with the words, \"May Christ our True God, who rose from the dead ....\" Anyone who wishes to receive [[Holy Communion]] at [[Divine Liturgy]] on Sunday morning is required to attend Vespers the night before (see [[Eucharistic discipline]]). Among Orthodox Christians, Sunday is considered to be a \"Little [[Easter|Pascha]]\" (Easter), and because of the Paschal joy, the making of [[poklon|prostrations]] is forbidden, except in certain circumstances. Leisure activities and idleness, being secular and offensive to Christ as it is time-wasting, is prohibited{{dubious|date=April 2017}}.\n\nSome languages lack separate words for \"Saturday\" and \"Sabbath\" (e. g. Italian, Portuguese). Outside the English-speaking world, ''Sabbath'' as a word, if it is used, refers to the Saturday (or the specific Jewish practices on it); Sunday is called the Lord's Day e. g. in Romance languages and Modern Greek. On the other hand, English-speaking Christians often refer to the Sunday as the Sabbath (other than Seventh-day Sabbatarians); a practice which, probably due to the international connections and the Latin tradition of the Roman Catholic Church, is more widespread among (but not limited to) Protestants. [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] traditionally referred to Sunday as \"First Day\" eschewing the [[paganism|pagan]] origin of the English name, while referring to Saturday as the \"Seventh day\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iymc.org/calendarnames.html |title=Guide to Quaker Calendar Names |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= |publisher=Iowa Yearly Meeting (Conservative) Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) |access-date=30 March 2017 |quote=In the 20th Century, many Friends began accepting use of the common date names, feeling that any pagan meaning has been forgotten.

The practice of offices closing on Sunday in government and in some rural areas of the United States stem from a system of [[Blue law|blue laws]]. Blue laws were established in the early puritan days which forbade secular activities on Sunday and were rigidly enforced. Some public activities are still regulated by these blue laws in the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/blue-law|title=Blue law {{!}} American history|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en}}</ref> In 1985 twenty-two states in which religious fundamentalism remained strong maintained general restrictions on Sunday behavior.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=BL014|title=Blue Laws {{!}} The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture|website=www.okhistory.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}</ref> In Oklahoma, for example, it is stated: \"Oklahoma's statutes state that \"acts deemed useless and serious interruptions of the repose and religious liberty of the community,\" such as trades, manufacturing, mechanical employment, horse racing, and gaming are forbidden.

In the [[United Kingdom]], there is a Sunday tradition of chart shows on [[BBC Radio 1]] and [[Independent Local Radio|commercial radio]]; this originates in the broadcast of chart shows and other populist material on Sundays by [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] when the [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Reithian]] [[BBC]]'s Sunday output consisted largely of solemn and religious programmes.  The first Sunday chart show was broadcast on the [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]] on 7 January 1962,<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/b7556e5ed91d41a589b75dfe03b2c3f0 BBC Genome Project - Radio Times listings]</ref> which was considered a radical step at the time.

Certain historically religious cities such as [[Boston]] and [[Baltimore]] among others will schedule games no earlier than 1:35 PM to ensure time for people who go to religious service in the morning can get to the game in time.\n\nIn the United States, professional [[American football]] is usually played on Sunday, although Saturday (via ''[[Run to the Playoffs|Saturday Night Football]]''), Monday (via ''[[Monday Night Football]]''), and Thursday (via ''[[Run to the Playoffs|Thursday Night Football]]'' or [[Thanksgiving]]) see some professional games. [[College football]] usually occurs on Saturday, and [[high school football|high-school football]] tends to take place on Friday night or Saturday afternoon.\n\nIn the [[UK]], some [[Club (organization)|club]] and [[Premier League]] football matches and tournaments usually take place on Sundays. [[Rugby football|Rugby]] matches and tournaments usually take place in club grounds or [[park]]s on Sunday mornings. It is not uncommon for church attendance to shift on days when a late morning or early afternoon game is anticipated by a local community.\n\nOne of the remains of [[pillarisation|religious segregation in the Netherlands]] is seen in [[Hoofdklasse|amateur football]]: The Saturday-clubs are by and large [[Protestantism in the Netherlands|Protestant Christian]] clubs, who were [[first-day Sabbath|not allowed to play on Sunday]]. The Sunday-clubs were in general [[Catholicism in the Netherlands|Catholic]] and working class clubs, whose players had to work on Saturday and therefore could only play on Sunday.\n\nIn [[Ireland]], [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] matches are predominantly played on Sundays, with the first (used to be second) and fourth (used to be third) Sundays in September always playing host to the All-Ireland hurling and football championship finals, respectively.\n\nProfessional [[golf]] tournaments traditionally end on Sunday. Traditionally, those in the United Kingdom ended on Saturday, but this changed some time ago; for example, the [[Open Championship|Open]] ran from Wednesday to Saturday up to 1979<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/d4d2f847153343079994435985ac03aa Radio Times listing - Wednesday 18 July 1979]</ref> but has run from Thursday to Sunday since 1980.<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/af9a92015e214b3cb57a66869c49dd24 Radio Times listing - Sunday 20 July 1980]</ref>\n\nIn the United States and Canada, [[National Basketball Association]] and [[National Hockey League]] games, which are usually played at night during the week, are frequently played during daytime hours - often broadcast on national television.\n\nMost [[NASCAR Sprint Cup]] and [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] events are held on Sundays. [[Formula One World Championship]] races are always held on Sundays regardless of timezone/country, while [[MotoGP]] holds most races on Sundays, with Middle Eastern races being the exception on Saturday. All Formula One events and MotoGP events with Sunday races involve qualifying taking place on Saturday.\n\n==Astrology==\nSunday is associated with the Sun and is symbolized by '''<big>\u2609</big>'''.\n\n==Named days==\n* [[Advent Sunday]]\n* [[Black Sunday (disambiguation)|Black Sunday]]\n* [[Bloody Sunday (disambiguation)|Bloody Sunday]]\n* [[Cold Sunday]]\n* [[Easter Sunday]] represents the resurrection of Christ\n* [[Gaudete Sunday]] is the third Sunday of [[Advent]].\n* [[Gloomy Sunday]]\n* [[Good Shepherd Sunday]] is the fourth Sunday of Easter.\n* [[Laetare Sunday]] is the fourth Sunday of [[Lent]].\n* [[Octave of Easter|Low Sunday]], first Sunday after Easter, is also known as the Octave of Easter, White Sunday, Quasimodo Sunday, Alb Sunday, Antipascha Sunday, and [[Divine Mercy Sunday]].\n* [[Passion Sunday]], the fifth Sunday of [[Lent]] as the beginning of [[Passiontide]] (since 1970 for Roman Catholics in the ordinary form of the rite, the term remains only official among the greater title of the Palm Sunday, which used to be also the \"2nd Sunday of Passiontide\")\n* [[Palm Sunday]] is the Sunday before Easter.\n* [[Selection Sunday]]\n* [[Septuagesima]], [[Sexagesima]] and [[Quinquagesima]] Sunday are the last three Sundays before [[Lent]].

During the 1st and 2nd century, the week of seven days was introduced into [[Rome]] from [[Egypt]], and the Roman names of the planets were given to each successive day.\n\n[[Germanic peoples]] seem to have adopted the [[week]] as a division of time from the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], but they changed the Roman names into those of corresponding [[Teutons|Teutonic]] [[deities]]. Hence, the ''dies Solis'' became Sunday (German, ''Sonntag'').\n\nThe English noun ''Sunday'' derived sometime before 1250 from ''sunedai'', which itself developed from [[Old English]] (before 700) ''Sunnand\u00e6g'' (literally meaning \"[[sun]]'s day\"), which is cognate to other [[Germanic languages]], including [[Old Frisian]] ''sunnandei'', [[Old Saxon]] ''sunnundag'', [[Middle Dutch]] ''sonnendach'' (modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''zondag''), [[Old High German]] ''sunnun tag'' (modern [[German language|German]] ''Sonntag''), and [[Old Norse]] ''sunnudagr'' ([[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''s\u00f8ndag'', [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''sunnudagur'' and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''s\u00f6ndag''). The Germanic term is a [[Interpretatio graeca|Germanic interpretation]] of [[Latin]] ''dies solis'' (\"day of the sun\"), which is a translation of the [[Ancient Greek]] ''hem\u00e9ra hel\u00edou''.<ref name=BARNHART778>Barnhart (1995:778).</ref>\nThe [[p-Celtic]] [[Welsh language]] also translates the Latin \"day of the sun\" as ''dydd Sul''.\n\nIn most [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], the word for Sunday is ''Raviv\u0101ra'' or ''Adityav\u0101ra'' or its derived forms \u2014 ''v\u0101ra'' meaning day, ''Aditya'' and ''Ravi'' both being a [[style (manner of address)]] for [[Surya]] i.e. the [[Sun]] and [[Suryadeva]] the chief [[solar deity]] and one of the [[Aditya]]s. Raviv\u0101ra is first day cited in [[Jyotisha]], which provides logical reason for giving the name of each week day. In the [[Thai solar calendar]] of [[Thailand]], the name (\"Waan Arthit\") is derived from Aditya, and the associated colour is [[red]].\n\nIn [[Russian language|Russian]] the word for Sunday is \u0412\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435 (Voskreseniye) meaning \"[[Resurrection]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seminarzkr.narod.ru/kalendar/pages/01_mir/pr_00_nedelja.html|title=\u0414\u041d\u0418 \u041d\u0415\u0414\u0415\u041b\u0418 - \u0421\u041b\u0410\u0412\u042f\u041d\u0421\u041a\u0410\u042f \u0421\u0415\u0414\u042c\u041c\u0418\u0426\u0410 | accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref> In other [[Slavic languages]] the word means \"no work\", for example Polish: Niedziela, Ukrainian: \u041d\u0435\u0434i\u043b\u044f, Belorussian: \u041d\u044f\u0434\u0437\u0435\u043b\u044f, Croatian: nedjelja, Serbian and Slovenian: Nedelja, Czech: Ned\u011ble, and Bulgarian: \u041d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f.\n\nThe [[Modern Greek]] word for Sunday, {{lang-el|\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae}}, is derived from {{lang-el|\u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2}} ([[Kyrios]], Lord) also, due to its liturgical significance as the day commemorating [[Resurrection of Jesus|the resurrection of Jesus Christ]], i.e. [[Lord's Day|The Lord's Day]].\n\nIn Korean, Sunday is called \uc77c\uc694\uc77c Il-yo-Il, meaning \"day of sun\". In Japanese, Sunday is \u65e5\u66dc\u65e5 Nichiy\u014dbi, which translates to \"sun day\".\n\nThe [[Arabic]] word for Sunday is \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f (Al-Ahad), which means \"The first\".

A number of languages express this position either by the name for the day or by the naming of the other days. In Hebrew it is called \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df ''yom rishon'', in Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f ''al-ahad'', in Persian and related languages \u06cc\u06a9\u0634\u0646\u0628\u0647 ''yek-shanbe'', all meaning \"first\".\n\nIn [[Greek language|Greek]], the names of the days Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday (\"\u0394\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\", \"\u03a4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\", \"\u03a4\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\" and \"\u03a0\u03ad\u03bc\u03c0\u03c4\u03b7\") mean \"second\", \"third\", \"fourth\", and \"fifth\" respectively. This leaves Sunday in the first position of the week count. The current Greek name for Sunday, ''\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae'' (Kyriake), means \"Lord's Day\" coming from the word ''\u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2'' (Kyrios), which is the Greek word for \"Lord\". Similarly in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], where the days from Monday to Friday are counted as \"segunda-feira\", \"ter\u00e7a-feira\", \"quarta-feira\", \"quinta-feira\" and \"sexta-feira\", while Sunday itself similar to Greek has the name of \"Lord's Day\" (\"domingo\"). In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the working days in the week are named as: \"Th\u1ee9 Hai\" (second day), \"Th\u1ee9 Ba\" (third day), \"Th\u1ee9 T\u01b0\" (fourth day), \"Th\u1ee9 N\u0103m\" (fifth day), \"Th\u1ee9 S\u00e1u\" (sixth day), \"Th\u1ee9 B\u1ea3y\" (seventh day). Sunday is called \"Ch\u1ee7 Nh\u1eadt\", a corrupted form of \"Ch\u00faa Nh\u1eadt\" meaning \"Lord's Day\". Some colloquial text in the south of [[Vietnam]] and from the church may still use the old form to mean Sunday.  In [[German language|German]], Wednesday is called \"Mittwoch\", literally \"mid-week\", implying that weeks run from Sunday to Saturday.\n\nThe name is similar in the [[Romance Languages]]. In [[Italian language|Italian]], Sunday is called \"domenica\", which also means \"Lord's Day\" (from Latin \"Dies Dominica\"). One finds similar cognates in [[French language|French]], where the name is \"dimanche\", as well as [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (\"duminic\u0103\") and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (\"domingo\").\n\n[[Slavic languages]] implicitly number Monday as day number one, not two. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! \n!

In Old Russian Sunday was also called ''\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f'' \"free day\" or \"day with no work\", but in the contemporary language this word means \"week\".\n[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''p\u00e9ntek'' (Friday) is a Slavic [[loanword]], so the correlation with \"five\" is not evident to Hungarians. Hungarians use ''Vas\u00e1rnap'' for Sunday, which means \"market day\". \n\nIn the [[Maltese language]], due to its [[Siculo-Arabic]] origin, Sunday is called \"Il-\u0126add\", a corruption of \"wie\u0127ed\" meaning \"one\". Monday is \"It-Tnejn\" meaning \"two\". Similarly Tuesday is \"It-Tlieta\" (three), Wednesday is \"L-Erbg\u0127a\" (four) and Thursday is \"Il-\u0126amis\" (five).\n\nIn [[Armenian language|Armenian]], Monday is (Yerkoushabti) literally meaning 2nd day of the week, Tuesday (Yerekshabti) 3rd day, Wednesday (Chorekshabti) 4th day, Thursday (Hingshabti) 5th day. Saturday is (Shabat) coming from the word Sabbath or Shabbath in Hebrew, and \"Kiraki\" coming from the word \"Krak\" meaning \"fire\" is Sunday, \"Krak\" describing the sun by fire. Apostle John also refers to the \"Lord's Day\" (in [[Greek language|Greek]], ''\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u1f21\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1'', \"kyriake hemera\" i.e. the day of the Lord) in Rev. 1:10, which is another possible origin of the Armenian word for Sunday.\n\nHowever, in many European countries calendars almost always show Monday as the first day of the week,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/weekinfo.htm#TSW |title=Calendar Weeks |author=J. R. Stockton |accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref> which follows the [[ISO 8601]] standard.\n\nIn the [[Persian calendar]], Sunday is the second day of the week. However, it is called \"number one\" as counting starts from zero; the first day - Saturday - is denoted as 00.\n\n<span id=\"Sunday_and_the_Sabbath\"></span>\n\n==Sunday in Christianity==\n\n===Pagan correspondence===\n\nIn Roman culture, Sunday was the day of the Sun god. In paganism, the Sun was a source of life, giving warmth and illumination to mankind. It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed.{{Dubious| Is this in source given, Chadwick's book? I don't have the book at hand, and I don't think it particularly implausible, but I have never heard of such a Roman custom and wouldn't think it is altogether implausible either to suppose that to the Sabbatarian propagandists roaming about this article invented such a custom.|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe opportunity to spot in the nature-worship of their heathen neighbors a symbolism valid to their own faith was not lost on the Christians. One of the Church fathers, [[St. Jerome]], would declare: \"If pagans call [the Lord's Day] [...] the 'day of the sun,' we willingly agree, for today the light of the world is raised, today is revealed the sun of justice with healing in his rays.\"<ref>St. Jerome, Pasch.: CCL 78, 550, as quoted in: [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|CCC]] 1166.</ref>\n\nA similar consideration may have influenced the choice of the [[Christmas|Christmas date]] on the day of the winter solstice, whose celebration was part of the Roman cult of the Sun.{{Dubious|Again, on 25th December was certainly the Sol Invictus feast and possibly a Mithraic feast, but neither cult is ''Roman cult'' properly speaking. Whether the ancient Romans, who by the way were not Germanics, laid much importance on the winter solstice only a few days before or after their ''Saturnalia'' seems dubious to me. My guess would be that the source means the Sol-invictus-feast, but it would be wrong to describe this as \"Roman cult\".|date=July 2017}}<ref>{{cite book|author=Owen Chadwick|title=A History of Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qugouOh3KjMC&pg=PA22|year=1998|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=22}}</ref> In the same vein, Christian churches have been built and are still being built (as far as possible) with an orientation so that the congregation faced toward the sunrise in the East. Much later, [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] would sing in his famous [[Canticle of the Sun|canticle]]: \"Be praised, my Lord, through all your creatures, especially through my lord Brother Sun, who brings the day; and you give light through him. And he is beautiful and radiant in all his splendor! Of you, Most High, he bears the likeness.\"\n\n===Christian usage===\n{{See also|Sabbath in Christianity}}\n\nThe ancient Romans traditionally used the eight-day [[Nundinae|nundinal cycle]], a market week, but in the time of [[Augustus]] in the 1st century AD, a seven-day week also came into use.\n\n[[Justin Martyr]], in the mid [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], mentions \"memoirs of the apostles\" as being read on \"the day called that of the sun\" (Sunday) alongside the \"writings of the prophets.\" <ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Citation | first = Justin | last = Martyr | title = [[First Apology]] | at = 67.3}}.</ref>\n\nOn 7 March 321, [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], Rome's first Christian Emperor (see [[Constantine I and Christianity]]), decreed that Sunday would be observed as the Roman day of rest:<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last = Zerubavel\n| first = Eviatar\n| title = The Seven Day Circle: The History and Meaning of the Week\n| publisher = University of Chicago Press\n| date = 1989\n| page = 45\n| isbn = 9780226981659}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|On the venerable Day of the Sun let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed.

It also indicates that Jews were observing the Sabbath on the Saturday.\n\n===Modern practices===\nSome Christian denominations, called \"[[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Sabbatarians]]\", observe a [[Saturday Sabbath]]. The name \"Sabbatarian\" has also been claimed by Christians, especially Protestants, who believe Sunday must be observed with just the sort of rigorous abstinence from work associated with \"[[Shabbat]]\". Christians in the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Seventh Day Baptist]], and [[Church of God (disambiguation)#Sabbatarian Churches of God|Church of God]] (Seventh-Day) denominations, as well as many [[Messianic Jews]], have maintained the practice of abstaining from work and gathering for worship on Saturdays (sunset to sunset) as did all of the followers of God in the Bible.\n\nFor most Christians the custom and obligation of Sunday rest is not as strict. A minority of Christians do not regard the day they attend church as important, so long as they attend. There is considerable variation in the observance of Sabbath rituals and restrictions, but some cessation of normal weekday activities is customary. Many Christians today observe Sunday as a day of church-attendance.\n\nIn [[Roman Catholic]] liturgy, Sunday begins on Saturday evening. The evening Mass on Saturday is liturgically a full Sunday Mass and fulfills the obligation of Sunday Mass attendance, and [[Vespers]] (evening prayer) on Saturday night is liturgically \"first Vespers\" of the Sunday. The same evening anticipation applies to other major solemnities and feasts, and is an echo of the Jewish practice of starting the new day at sunset. Those who work in the medical field, in law enforcement, and soldiers in a war zone are dispensed from the usual obligation to attend Church on Sunday. They are encouraged to combine their work with attending religious services if possible.\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], Sunday begins at the [[Little Entrance]] of Vespers (or [[All-Night Vigil]]) on Saturday evening and runs until \"Vouchsafe, O Lord\" (after the \"[[prokeimenon]]\") of Vespers on Sunday night. During this time, the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] at all services begin with the words, \"May Christ our True God, who rose from the dead ....\" Anyone who wishes to receive [[Holy Communion]] at [[Divine Liturgy]] on Sunday morning is required to attend Vespers the night before (see [[Eucharistic discipline]]). Among Orthodox Christians, Sunday is considered to be a \"Little [[Easter|Pascha]]\" (Easter), and because of the Paschal joy, the making of [[poklon|prostrations]] is forbidden, except in certain circumstances. Leisure activities and idleness, being secular and offensive to Christ as it is time-wasting, is prohibited{{dubious|date=April 2017}}.\n\nSome languages lack separate words for \"Saturday\" and \"Sabbath\" (e. g. Italian, Portuguese). Outside the English-speaking world, ''Sabbath'' as a word, if it is used, refers to the Saturday (or the specific Jewish practices on it); Sunday is called the Lord's Day e. g. in Romance languages and Modern Greek. On the other hand, English-speaking Christians often refer to the Sunday as the Sabbath (other than Seventh-day Sabbatarians); a practice which, probably due to the international connections and the Latin tradition of the Roman Catholic Church, is more widespread among (but not limited to) Protestants. [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] traditionally referred to Sunday as \"First Day\" eschewing the [[paganism|pagan]] origin of the English name, while referring to Saturday as the \"Seventh day\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iymc.org/calendarnames.html |title=Guide to Quaker Calendar Names |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= |publisher=Iowa Yearly Meeting (Conservative) Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) |access-date=30 March 2017 |quote=In the 20th Century, many Friends began accepting use of the common date names, feeling that any pagan meaning has been forgotten. The numerical names continue to be used, however, in many documents and more formal situations.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe Russian word for Sunday is \"Voskresenie,\" meaning \"Resurrection day.\" The Greek word for Sunday is \"Kyriake\" (the \"Lord's Day\"). The [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] words for Sunday (\"ned\u011ble,\" \"niedziela,\" \"nedelja\", \"nedjelja,\"  \"\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0459\u0430\", \"\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0456\u043b\u044f\" and \"\u043d\u044f\u0434\u0437\u0435\u043b\u044f\" respectively) can be translated as \"without acts (no work).\"\n\n==Common occurrences on Sunday==\n\n===In government and business===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\n{{further information|Sunday shopping}}\nIn the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], most government offices are closed on both Saturday and Sunday. The practice of offices closing on Sunday in government and in some rural areas of the United States stem from a system of [[Blue law|blue laws]]. Blue laws were established in the early puritan days which forbade secular activities on Sunday and were rigidly enforced. Some public activities are still regulated by these blue laws in the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/blue-law|title=Blue law {{!}} American history|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en}}</ref> In 1985 twenty-two states in which religious fundamentalism remained strong maintained general restrictions on Sunday behavior.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=BL014|title=Blue Laws {{!}} The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture|website=www.okhistory.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}</ref> In Oklahoma, for example, it is stated: \"Oklahoma's statutes state that \"acts deemed useless and serious interruptions of the repose and religious liberty of the community,\" such as trades, manufacturing, mechanical employment, horse racing, and gaming are forbidden. Public selling of commodities other than necessary foods and drinks, medicine, ice, and surgical and burial equipment, and other necessities can legally be prohibited on Sunday. In Oklahoma a fine not to exceed twenty-five dollars may be imposed on individuals for each offense.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Because of these blue laws, many private sector retail businesses open later and close earlier on Sunday or don't open at all.\n\nMany countries, particularly in [[Europe]] such as [[Sweden]], [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Belgium]], but also in other countries such as [[Peru]], hold their national and local [[elections]] on a Sunday, either by law or by tradition.\n\n===In media===\nMany American and British daily [[newspaper]]s publish a larger edition on Sundays, which often includes [[color]] [[comic strip]]s, a [[magazine]], and a [[coupon]] section; may only publish on a Sunday, or may have a \"sister-paper\" with a different masthead that only publishes on a Sunday.\n\nNorth American [[radio]] stations often play specialty radio shows such as [[Casey Kasem]]'s countdown or other nationally syndicated radio shows that may differ from their regular weekly music patterns on Sunday morning or Sunday evening. In the [[United Kingdom]], there is a Sunday tradition of chart shows on [[BBC Radio 1]] and [[Independent Local Radio|commercial radio]]; this originates in the broadcast of chart shows and other populist material on Sundays by [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] when the [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Reithian]] [[BBC]]'s Sunday output consisted largely of solemn and religious programmes.  The first Sunday chart show was broadcast on the [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]] on 7 January 1962,<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/b7556e5ed91d41a589b75dfe03b2c3f0 BBC Genome Project - Radio Times listings]</ref> which was considered a radical step at the time.

Certain historically religious cities such as [[Boston]] and [[Baltimore]] among others will schedule games no earlier than 1:35 PM to ensure time for people who go to religious service in the morning can get to the game in time.\n\nIn the United States, professional [[American football]] is usually played on Sunday, although Saturday (via ''[[Run to the Playoffs|Saturday Night Football]]''), Monday (via ''[[Monday Night Football]]''), and Thursday (via ''[[Run to the Playoffs|Thursday Night Football]]'' or [[Thanksgiving]]) see some professional games. [[College football]] usually occurs on Saturday, and [[high school football|high-school football]] tends to take place on Friday night or Saturday afternoon.\n\nIn the [[UK]], some [[Club (organization)|club]] and [[Premier League]] football matches and tournaments usually take place on Sundays. [[Rugby football|Rugby]] matches and tournaments usually take place in club grounds or [[park]]s on Sunday mornings. It is not uncommon for church attendance to shift on days when a late morning or early afternoon game is anticipated by a local community.\n\nOne of the remains of [[pillarisation|religious segregation in the Netherlands]] is seen in [[Hoofdklasse|amateur football]]: The Saturday-clubs are by and large [[Protestantism in the Netherlands|Protestant Christian]] clubs, who were [[first-day Sabbath|not allowed to play on Sunday]]. The Sunday-clubs were in general [[Catholicism in the Netherlands|Catholic]] and working class clubs, whose players had to work on Saturday and therefore could only play on Sunday.\n\nIn [[Ireland]], [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] matches are predominantly played on Sundays, with the first (used to be second) and fourth (used to be third) Sundays in September always playing host to the All-Ireland hurling and football championship finals, respectively.\n\nProfessional [[golf]] tournaments traditionally end on Sunday. Traditionally, those in the United Kingdom ended on Saturday, but this changed some time ago; for example, the [[Open Championship|Open]] ran from Wednesday to Saturday up to 1979<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/d4d2f847153343079994435985ac03aa Radio Times listing - Wednesday 18 July 1979]</ref> but has run from Thursday to Sunday since 1980.<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/af9a92015e214b3cb57a66869c49dd24 Radio Times listing - Sunday 20 July 1980]</ref>\n\nIn the United States and Canada, [[National Basketball Association]] and [[National Hockey League]] games, which are usually played at night during the week, are frequently played during daytime hours - often broadcast on national television.\n\nMost [[NASCAR Sprint Cup]] and [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] events are held on Sundays. [[Formula One World Championship]] races are always held on Sundays regardless of timezone/country, while [[MotoGP]] holds most races on Sundays, with Middle Eastern races being the exception on Saturday.

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward in monochrome and re-coloured by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time at Haddon composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Biographer [[Marc Spitz]] notes that a piano could not fit in his Plaistow Grove bedroom, nor was it suitable for playing in clubs or bus tours with his previous groups. Haddon Hall, however, gave him more of a sense of comfort and permanence, something he had not felt before when composing.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} Here he composed over three dozen songs, many of which would end up on ''Hunky Dory'' and its follow-up ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Two of these were \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971,{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}} and subsequently re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}\n\nIn August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nThe first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''. They were joined by [[Dana Gillespie]], Mark Pritchett, Geoffrey MacCormack (better known as [[Warren Peace]]) and George Underwood.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The songs they performed were all originals written by Bowie, apart from a cover of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Almost Grown (song)|Almost Grown]]\" and [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' \"It Ain't Easy\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}} which was to be recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust'' a year later.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The performance began with \"[[Queen Bitch]]\" and \"[[Bombers (David Bowie song)|Bombers]]\", which Peel says will both be on the upcoming album, although \"Bombers\" was to replaced by the cover \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} They also played \"[[The Supermen]]\" from ''The Man Who Sold the World'', \"Looking for a Friend\" (which was sung by Pritchett), \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\" (which was sung by Underwood) and \"Andy Warhol\" (which was sung by Gillespie).{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} Although Bowie's backing trio were referred to as \"members of a group called Ronno\", the session would become the first performance with the trio who would become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] and who would record with him for the next three years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}}<ref name=\"Gallucci UCR\" /> \n\n{{quote box|quote=[''Hunky Dory''] is very much a duo record.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} The piano Wakeman played on the album was an 1898 [[C. Bechstein|Bechstein]] that was the same one used for the Beatles' 1968 song \"[[Hey Jude]]\" and many of [[Elton John]] and [[Harry Nilsson]]'s early records, and would later be used by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] for \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} According to Wakeman, the sessions initially had a rough start, due to the band not learning the songs. He recalled in the Radio 2 documentary ''Golden Years'' and his autobiography ''Say Yes!'' that Bowie had to halt the sessions, telling the musicians off and to come back when they knew the music. Upon returning after a week, Wakeman said: \"the band were hot! They were so good, and the tracks just flowed through.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} However, this account has been disputed by other band members, including Bolder, who told Kevin Cann: \"[That's] rubbish. David would never have told the band off in the studio. Especially as Mick and Woody had already left him once, and everyone was now getting on. The band would not have survived that \u2013 it definitely didn't happen.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} Similarly, Scott said: \"I definitely don't remember that, and it's not something I would forget. I would definitely dispute that one.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}}\n\nWith Wakeman on the line-up, Bowie and the Spiders recorded reconvened at Trident on 9 July and recorded two takes of \"Bombers\" and \"It Ain't Easy\", the latter featuring backing vocals by Dana Gillespie.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} According to Cann, five days later on 14 July, Defries sent a letter to jazz pianist [[Dudley Moore]] asking him to play piano during a session. There is no known record of Moore responding and although the specific song Defries was asking him to play on is unknown, Cann deduces that it was most likely \"Life on Mars?\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} During this day, the group recorded four takes of \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\", the final take appeared on the finished album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013224}} On 18 July, the group spent the day rehearsing and mixing. During the session, Bowie was introduced by Grace to a band known as Chameleon. He gave them his future ''Ziggy Stardust'' track \"[[Star (David Bowie song)|Star]]\", which they recorded their own unreleased version of.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=224}} On 26 July, a seven-hour mixing session took place in order to compile a promotional album for Gem Productions. At this point, the songs \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", \"Eight Line Poem\", \"Kooks\", \"Queen Bitch\" and \"Andy Warhol\" were recorded, although the mixes of \"Eight Line Poem\" and \"Kooks\" on the promotional album were different than the final mixes on ''Hunky Dory''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=224\u2013225}} Two takes of \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\" were recorded on 30 July, the second take appearing on the final album. It was recorded on a tape that contained rejected versions of \"Song for Bob Dylan\" and \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} On 6 August, the band recorded \"Life on Mars?\" and \"Song for Bob Dylan\", after which the album recording is deemed complete. Ronson guided the recording of \"Life on Mars?\", counting in each take and overdubbed his guitar, strings, Mellotron and Bowie's vocal.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} Cann does not have a recording date for \"Changes\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=219\u2013225}} but Doggett writes that it was recorded sometime between June and July.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n[[File:Rickwakemanmoog.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Rick Wakeman performing in 2012|The album features piano by keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] ''(pictured in 2012)'', whose playing greatly influenced the songs.]]\nAuthor [[Peter Doggett]] describes ''Hunky Dory'' as \"a collective of attractively accessible pop songs, through which Bowie tested out his feelings about the nature of stardom and power.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=11}} Musical biographer David Buckley said of the album: \"Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie's future career.\"<ref name=buckstrange1>{{cite book |title=Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story |last=Buckley |first=David |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0457-X |page=112}}</ref> Spitz describes it as a piano-driven record and because of this, it offers more of an inviting and warmer feel, especially when compared to ''Space Oddity'' and ''The Man Who Sold the World''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} The opening track, \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", focused on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me/Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\"). However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''The Man Who Sold the World'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''Space Oddity'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory', was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon\", using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo', and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory'. Grace told Bowie and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} Spitz notes that 'hunky-dory' is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward at his [[Heddon Street]] studio,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken \u2013 one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue \u2013 but the idea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead. Originally shot in monochrome, the image was re-coloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, who recently set up the Main Artery design studio in [[Covent Garden]] with George Underwood; Pastor would later design the cover and sleeve for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Pegg writes: \"Bowie's decision to use a re-coloured photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol's famous ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' screen-prints.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Robert Dimery, in his book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', also notes the influenced of Warhol's ''Dietrich'' prints and writes that Bowie took a photo book that contained multiple ''Dietrich'' prints with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward in monochrome and re-coloured by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time at Haddon composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Biographer [[Marc Spitz]] notes that a piano could not fit in in Plaistow Grove bedroom, nor was it suitable for playing in clubs or bus tours with his previous groups. Haddon Hall, however, gave him more of a sense of comfort and permanence, something he had not felt before when composing.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} Here he composed over three dozen songs, many of which would end up on ''Hunky Dory'' and its follow-up ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Two of these were \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971,{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}} and subsequently re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}\n\nIn August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nThe first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''. They were joined by [[Dana Gillespie]], Mark Pritchett, Geoffrey MacCormack (better known as [[Warren Peace]]) and George Underwood.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The songs they performed were all originals written by Bowie, apart from a cover of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Almost Grown (song)|Almost Grown]]\" and [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' \"It Ain't Easy\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}} which was to be recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust'' a year later.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The performance began with \"[[Queen Bitch]]\" and \"[[Bombers (David Bowie song)|Bombers]]\", which Peel says will both be on the upcoming album, although \"Bombers\" was to replaced by the cover \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} They also played \"[[The Supermen]]\" from ''The Man Who Sold the World'', \"Looking for a Friend\" (which was sung by Pritchett), \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\" (which was sung by Underwood) and \"Andy Warhol\" (which was sung by Gillespie).{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} Although Bowie's backing trio were referred to as \"members of a group called Ronno\", the session would become the first performance with the trio who would become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] and who would record with him for the next three years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}}<ref name=\"Gallucci UCR\" /> \n\n{{quote box|quote=[''Hunky Dory''] is very much a duo record.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} The piano Wakeman played on the album was an 1898 [[C. Bechstein|Bechstein]] that was the same one used for the Beatles' 1968 song \"[[Hey Jude]]\" and many of [[Elton John]] and [[Harry Nilsson]]'s early records, and would later be used by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] for \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} According to Wakeman, the sessions initially had a rough start, due to the band not learning the songs. He recalled in the Radio 2 documentary ''Golden Years'' and his autobiography ''Say Yes!'' that Bowie had to halt the sessions, telling the musicians off and to come back when they knew the music. Upon returning after a week, Wakeman said: \"the band were hot! They were so good, and the tracks just flowed through.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} However, this account has been disputed by other band members, including Bolder, who told Kevin Cann: \"[That's] rubbish. David would never have told the band off in the studio. Especially as Mick and Woody had already left him once, and everyone was now getting on. The band would not have survived that \u2013 it definitely didn't happen.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} Similarly, Scott said: \"I definitely don't remember that, and it's not something I would forget.

There is no known record of Moore responding and although the specific song Defries was asking him to play on is unknown, Cann deduces that it was most likely \"Life on Mars?\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} During this day, the group recorded four takes of \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\", the final take appeared on the finished album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013224}} On 18 July, the group spent the day rehearsing and mixing. During the session, Bowie was introduced by Grace to a band known as Chameleon. He gave them his future ''Ziggy Stardust'' track \"[[Star (David Bowie song)|Star]]\", which they recorded their own unreleased version of.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=224}} On 26 July, a seven-hour mixing session took place in order to compile a promotional album for Gem Productions. At this point, the songs \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", \"Eight Line Poem\", \"Kooks\", \"Queen Bitch\" and \"Andy Warhol\" were recorded, although the mixes of \"Eight Line Poem\" and \"Kooks\" on the promotional album were different than the final mixes on ''Hunky Dory''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=224\u2013225}} Two takes of \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\" were recorded on 30 July, the second take appearing on the final album. It was recorded on a tape that contained rejected versions of \"Song for Bob Dylan\" and \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} On 6 August, the band recorded \"Life on Mars?\" and \"Song for Bob Dylan\", after which the album recording is deemed complete. Ronson guided the recording of \"Life on Mars?\", counting in each take and overdubbed his guitar, strings, Mellotron and Bowie's vocal.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} Cann does not have a recording date for \"Changes\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=219\u2013225}} but Doggett writes that it was recorded sometime between June and July.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n[[File:Rickwakemanmoog.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Rick Wakeman performing in 2012|The album features piano by keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] ''(pictured in 2012)'', whose playing greatly influenced the songs.]]\nAuthor [[Peter Doggett]] describes ''Hunky Dory'' as \"a collective of attractively accessible pop songs, through which Bowie tested out his feelings about the nature of stardom and power.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=11}} Musical biographer David Buckley said of the album: \"Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie's future career.\"<ref name=buckstrange1>{{cite book |title=Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story |last=Buckley |first=David |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0457-X |page=112}}</ref> Spitz describes it as a piano-driven record and because of this, it offers more of an inviting and warmer feel, especially when compared to ''Space Oddity'' and ''The Man Who Sold the World''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} The opening track, \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", focused on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me/Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\"). However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''The Man Who Sold the World'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''Space Oddity'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory', was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon\", using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo', and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory'. Grace told Bowie and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} Spitz notes that 'hunky-dory' is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward at his [[Heddon Street]] studio,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken \u2013 one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue \u2013 but the idea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead. Originally shot in monochrome, the image was re-coloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, who recently set up the Main Artery design studio in [[Covent Garden]] with George Underwood; Pastor would later design the cover and sleeve for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Pegg writes: \"Bowie's decision to use a re-coloured photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol's famous ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' screen-prints.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Robert Dimery, in his book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', also notes the influenced of Warhol's ''Dietrich'' prints and writes that Bowie took a photo book that contained multiple ''Dietrich'' prints with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must
