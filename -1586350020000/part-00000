Wall painting in the tomb of [[Horemheb]] ([[KV57]]).]]\nOsiris is the mythological father of the god [[Horus]], whose conception is described in the [[Osiris myth]] (a central myth in [[Ancient Egyptian religion|ancient Egyptian belief]]). The myth describes Osiris as having been killed by his brother, Set, who wanted Osiris' throne. His wife, Isis finds the body of Osiris and hides it in the reeds where it is found and dismembered by Set. Isis retrieves and joins the fragmented pieces of Osiris, then briefly revives Osiris by use of magic. This spell gives her time to become pregnant by Osiris. Isis later gives birth to Horus. As such, since Horus was born after Osiris' resurrection, Horus became thought of as a representation of new beginnings and the vanquisher of the usurper Set.\n\n''Ptah-Seker'' (who resulted from the identification of Creator god [[Ptah]] with [[Seker]]) thus gradually became identified with Osiris, the two becoming '''Ptah-Seker-Osiris'''. As the sun was thought to spend the night in the underworld, and was subsequently \"reborn\" every morning, Ptah-Seker-Osiris was identified as king of the [[underworld]], god of the [[afterlife]], life, death, and regeneration.\n\n===Ram god===\n{{Hiero|Banebdjed <br> (''b3-nb-\u1e0fd'')|<hiero>E10-nb-Dd-niwt-Dd</hiero>|align=left|era=egypt}}\nOsiris' soul, or rather his ''[[Egyptian soul|Ba]]'', was occasionally worshipped in its own right, almost as if it were a distinct god, especially in the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] city of [[Mendes]]. This aspect of Osiris was referred to as ''[[Banebdjedet]]'', which is grammatically [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] (also spelt \"''Banebded''\" or \"''Banebdjed''\"), literally \"the ''ba'' of the lord of the ''[[djed]]'', which roughly means ''The soul of the lord of the pillar of continuity''. The ''djed'', a type of pillar, was usually understood as the [[Vertebral column|backbone]] of Osiris.\n\nThe Nile supplying water, and Osiris (strongly connected to the vegetable regeneration) who died only to be resurrected, represented continuity and stability. As ''Banebdjed'', Osiris was given [[epithet]]s such as ''Lord of the Sky'' and ''Life of the ([[solar deity|sun god]]) [[Ra]]''. ''Ba'' does not mean \"soul\" in the western sense, and has to do with power, reputation, force of character, especially in the case of a god.\n\nSince the ''ba'' was associated with power, and also happened to be a word for [[Ram (sheep)|ram]] in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], Banebdjed was depicted as a ram, or as Ram-headed. A living, sacred ram was kept at Mendes and worshipped as the incarnation of the god, and upon death, the rams were mummified and buried in a ram-specific [[necropolis]]. Banebdjed was consequently said to be Horus' father, as Banebdjed was an aspect of Osiris.\n\nRegarding the association of Osiris with the ram, the god's traditional [[crook and flail]] are the instruments of the shepherd, which has suggested to some scholars also an origin for Osiris in herding tribes of the upper Nile. The crook and flail were originally symbols of the minor agricultural deity [[Andjety]], and passed to Osiris later. From Osiris, they eventually passed to Egyptian kings in general as symbols of divine authority.\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Jewel Osiris family-E 6204-IMG 0641-gradient.jpg|thumb|200px|The family of Osiris.

Osiris' wife, [[Isis]], searched for his remains until she finally found him embedded in a tamarisk tree trunk, which was holding up the roof of a palace in [[Byblos]] on the Phoenician coast. She managed to remove the coffin and retrieve her husband's body.\n\nIn one version of the myth, Isis used a spell to briefly revive Osiris so he could impregnate her. After embalming and burying Osiris, Isis conceived and gave birth to their son, Horus. Thereafter Osiris lived on as the god of the underworld. Because of his death and resurrection, Osiris was associated with the flooding and retreating of the Nile and thus with the yearly growth and death of crops along the Nile valley.\n\n[[Diodorus Siculus]] gives another version of the myth in which Osiris was described as an ancient king who taught the Egyptians the arts of civilization, including agriculture, then travelled the world with his sister Isis, the satyrs, and [[Muse|the nine muses]], before finally returning to Egypt. Osiris was then murdered by his evil brother [[Typhon]], who was identified with Set. Typhon divided the body into twenty-six pieces, which he distributed amongst his fellow conspirators in order to implicate them in the murder. Isis and Hercules (Horus) avenged the death of Osiris and slew Typhon. Isis recovered all the parts of Osiris' body, except the phallus, and secretly buried them. She made replicas of them and distributed them to several locations, which then became centres of Osiris worship.<ref>\"Osiris\", [[Man, Myth & Magic (encyclopedia)|Man, Myth & Magic]], S.G.F Brandon, Vol5 P2088, BPC Publishing.</ref><ref>\"The Historical Library of Diodorus Siculus\", translated by George Booth 1814. retrieved 3 June 2007.

The annual festival involved the construction of \"Osiris Beds\" formed in shape of Osiris, filled with soil and sown with seed.<ref>Teeter, Emily (2011). ''Religion and Ritual in Ancient Egypt''.

When they pretend that the mutilated remains of the god have been found and rejoined...they turn from mourning to rejoicing.\" (''De Errore Profanorum'').\n\nThe passion of Osiris was reflected in his name 'Wenennefer\" (\"the one who continues to be perfect\"), which also alludes to his post mortem power.<ref name=\"Mark Collier p42\"/>\n\n===Ikhernofret Stela===\nMuch of the extant information about the rites of Osiris can be found on the [[Ikhernofret Stela]] at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] erected in the 12th Dynasty by Ikhernofret, possibly a priest of Osiris or other official (the titles of Ikhernofret are described in his stela from Abydos) during the reign of [[Senwosret III]] (Pharaoh Sesostris, about 1875 BC).

Vandier, \"Le Papyrus Jumilhac\", pp.&nbsp;136\u2013137, Paris, 1961</ref> Some elements of the ceremony were held in the [[Egyptian temple|temple]], while others involved public participation in a form of theatre. The Stela of Ikhernofret recounts the programme of events of the public elements over the five days of the Festival:\n* ''The First Day, The Procession of [[Wepwawet]]'': A mock battle was enacted during which the enemies of Osiris are defeated. A procession was led by the god Wepwawet (\"opener of the way\").\n* ''The Second Day, The Great Procession of Osiris'': The body of Osiris was taken from his temple to his tomb. The boat he was transported in, the \"[[Neshmet]]\" bark, had to be defended against his enemies.\n* ''The Third Day:'' Osiris is Mourned and the Enemies of the Land are Destroyed''.\n* ''The Fourth Day, Night Vigil'': Prayers and recitations are made and funeral rites performed.\n* ''The Fifth Day, Osiris is Reborn'': Osiris is reborn at dawn and crowned with the crown of [[Ma'at]].

Plutarch mentions that (for much later period) two days after the beginning of the festival \"the priests bring forth a sacred chest containing a small golden coffer, into which they pour some potable water...and a great shout arises from the company for joy that Osiris is found (or resurrected). Then they knead some fertile soil with the water...and fashion therefrom a crescent-shaped figure, which they cloth and adorn, this indicating that they regard these gods as the substance of Earth and Water.\" (''Isis and Osiris,'' 39). Yet his accounts were still obscure, for he also wrote, \"I pass over the cutting of the wood\" \u2013 opting not to describe it, since he considered it as a most sacred ritual (''Ibid.'' 21).\n\nIn the Osirian temple at [[Denderah]], an inscription (translated by Budge, Chapter XV, Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection) describes in detail the making of wheat paste models of each dismembered piece of Osiris to be sent out to the town where each piece is discovered by Isis. At the temple of Mendes, figures of Osiris were made from wheat and paste placed in a trough on the day of the murder, then water was added for several days, until finally the mixture was kneaded into a mold of Osiris and taken to the temple to be buried (the sacred grain for these cakes were grown only in the temple fields). Molds were made from the wood of a red tree in the forms of the sixteen dismembered parts of Osiris, the cakes of \"divine\" bread were made from each mold, placed in a silver chest and set near the head of the god with ''the inward parts of Osiris'' as described in the Book of the Dead (XVII).\n\n== <!-- [[Osiris and his council]] links here -->Judgement ==\n\nThe idea of divine justice being exercised after death for wrongdoing during life is first encountered during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] in a 6th dynasty tomb containing fragments of what would be described later as the [[Maat#42 Confessions (Papyrus of Ani)|Negative Confessions]] performed in front of the 42 [[Assessors of Maat|Assessors of Ma'at]].<ref>\"Studies in Comparative Religion\", General editor, E.

Next, the triumphant Hunefer, having passed the test, is presented by the falcon-headed [[Horus]] to Osiris, seated in his shrine with Isis and [[Nephthys]].

Serapis was often treated as the consort of Isis and became the patron deity of the Ptolemies' capital, Alexandria.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2003|pp=127\u2013128}} Serapis's origins are not known. Some ancient authors claim the cult of Serapis was established at Alexandria by [[Alexander the Great]] himself, but most who discuss the subject of Serapis's origins give a story similar to that by Plutarch. Writing about 400 years after the fact, Plutarch claimed that [[Ptolemy I]] established the cult after dreaming of a colossal statue at [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] in Anatolia. His councillors identified as a statue of the Greek god [[Pluto (god)|Pluto]] and said that the Egyptian name for Pluto was Serapis.

Wall painting in the tomb of [[Horemheb]] ([[KV57]]).]]\nOsiris is the mythological father of the god [[Horus]], whose conception is described in the [[Osiris myth]] (a central myth in [[Ancient Egyptian religion|ancient Egyptian belief]]). The myth describes Osiris as having been killed by his brother, Set, who wanted Osiris' throne. His wife, Isis finds the body of Osiris and hides it in the reeds where it is found and dismembered by Set. Isis retrieves and joins the fragmented pieces of Osiris, then briefly revives Osiris by use of magic. This spell gives her time to become pregnant by Osiris. Isis later gives birth to Horus. As such, since Horus was born after Osiris' resurrection, Horus became thought of as a representation of new beginnings and the vanquisher of the usurper Set.\n\n''Ptah-Seker'' (who resulted from the identification of Creator god [[Ptah]] with [[Seker]]) thus gradually became identified with Osiris, the two becoming '''Ptah-Seker-Osiris'''. As the sun was thought to spend the night in the underworld, and was subsequently \"reborn\" every morning, Ptah-Seker-Osiris was identified as king of the [[underworld]], god of the [[afterlife]], life, death, and regeneration.\n\n===Ram god===\n{{Hiero|Banebdjed <br> (''b3-nb-\u1e0fd'')|<hiero>E10-nb-Dd-niwt-Dd</hiero>|align=left|era=egypt}}\nOsiris' soul, or rather his ''[[Egyptian soul|Ba]]'', was occasionally worshipped in its own right, almost as if it were a distinct god, especially in the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] city of [[Mendes]]. This aspect of Osiris was referred to as ''[[Banebdjedet]]'', which is grammatically [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] (also spelt \"''Banebded''\" or \"''Banebdjed''\"), literally \"the ''ba'' of the lord of the ''[[djed]]'', which roughly means ''The soul of the lord of the pillar of continuity''. The ''djed'', a type of pillar, was usually understood as the [[Vertebral column|backbone]] of Osiris.\n\nThe Nile supplying water, and Osiris (strongly connected to the vegetable regeneration) who died only to be resurrected, represented continuity and stability. As ''Banebdjed'', Osiris was given [[epithet]]s such as ''Lord of the Sky'' and ''Life of the ([[solar deity|sun god]]) [[Ra]]''. ''Ba'' does not mean \"soul\" in the western sense, and has to do with power, reputation, force of character, especially in the case of a god.\n\nSince the ''ba'' was associated with power, and also happened to be a word for [[Ram (sheep)|ram]] in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], Banebdjed was depicted as a ram, or as Ram-headed. A living, sacred ram was kept at Mendes and worshipped as the incarnation of the god, and upon death, the rams were mummified and buried in a ram-specific [[necropolis]]. Banebdjed was consequently said to be Horus' father, as Banebdjed was an aspect of Osiris.\n\nRegarding the association of Osiris with the ram, the god's traditional [[crook and flail]] are the instruments of the shepherd, which has suggested to some scholars also an origin for Osiris in herding tribes of the upper Nile. The crook and flail were originally symbols of the minor agricultural deity [[Andjety]], and passed to Osiris later. From Osiris, they eventually passed to Egyptian kings in general as symbols of divine authority.\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Jewel Osiris family-E 6204-IMG 0641-gradient.jpg|thumb|200px|The family of Osiris.

Osiris' wife, [[Isis]], searched for his remains until she finally found him embedded in a tamarisk tree trunk, which was holding up the roof of a palace in [[Byblos]] on the Phoenician coast. She managed to remove the coffin and retrieve her husband's body.\n\nIn one version of the myth, Isis used a spell to briefly revive Osiris so he could impregnate her. After embalming and burying Osiris, Isis conceived and gave birth to their son, Horus. Thereafter Osiris lived on as the god of the underworld. Because of his death and resurrection, Osiris was associated with the flooding and retreating of the Nile and thus with the yearly growth and death of crops along the Nile valley.\n\n[[Diodorus Siculus]] gives another version of the myth in which Osiris was described as an ancient king who taught the Egyptians the arts of civilization, including agriculture, then travelled the world with his sister Isis, the satyrs, and [[Muse|the nine muses]], before finally returning to Egypt. Osiris was then murdered by his evil brother [[Typhon]], who was identified with Set. Typhon divided the body into twenty-six pieces, which he distributed amongst his fellow conspirators in order to implicate them in the murder. Isis and Hercules (Horus) avenged the death of Osiris and slew Typhon. Isis recovered all the parts of Osiris' body, except the phallus, and secretly buried them. She made replicas of them and distributed them to several locations, which then became centres of Osiris worship.<ref>\"Osiris\", [[Man, Myth & Magic (encyclopedia)|Man, Myth & Magic]], S.G.F Brandon, Vol5 P2088, BPC Publishing.</ref><ref>\"The Historical Library of Diodorus Siculus\", translated by George Booth 1814. retrieved 3 June 2007.

When they pretend that the mutilated remains of the god have been found and rejoined...they turn from mourning to rejoicing.\" (''De Errore Profanorum'').\n\nThe passion of Osiris was reflected in his name 'Wenennefer\" (\"the one who continues to be perfect\"), which also alludes to his post mortem power.<ref name=\"Mark Collier p42\"/>\n\n===Ikhernofret Stela===\nMuch of the extant information about the rites of Osiris can be found on the [[Ikhernofret Stela]] at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] erected in the 12th Dynasty by Ikhernofret, possibly a priest of Osiris or other official (the titles of Ikhernofret are described in his stela from Abydos) during the reign of [[Senwosret III]] (Pharaoh Sesostris, about 1875 BC).

The Stela of Ikhernofret recounts the programme of events of the public elements over the five days of the Festival:\n* ''The First Day, The Procession of [[Wepwawet]]'': A mock battle was enacted during which the enemies of Osiris are defeated. A procession was led by the god Wepwawet (\"opener of the way\").\n* ''The Second Day, The Great Procession of Osiris'': The body of Osiris was taken from his temple to his tomb. The boat he was transported in, the \"[[Neshmet]]\" bark, had to be defended against his enemies.\n* ''The Third Day:'' Osiris is Mourned and the Enemies of the Land are Destroyed''.\n* ''The Fourth Day, Night Vigil'': Prayers and recitations are made and funeral rites performed.\n* ''The Fifth Day, Osiris is Reborn'': Osiris is reborn at dawn and crowned with the crown of [[Ma'at]].

Plutarch mentions that (for much later period) two days after the beginning of the festival \"the priests bring forth a sacred chest containing a small golden coffer, into which they pour some potable water...and a great shout arises from the company for joy that Osiris is found (or resurrected). Then they knead some fertile soil with the water...and fashion therefrom a crescent-shaped figure, which they cloth and adorn, this indicating that they regard these gods as the substance of Earth and Water.\" (''Isis and Osiris,'' 39). Yet his accounts were still obscure, for he also wrote, \"I pass over the cutting of the wood\" \u2013 opting not to describe it, since he considered it as a most sacred ritual (''Ibid.'' 21).\n\nIn the Osirian temple at [[Denderah]], an inscription (translated by Budge, Chapter XV, Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection) describes in detail the making of wheat paste models of each dismembered piece of Osiris to be sent out to the town where each piece is discovered by Isis. At the temple of Mendes, figures of Osiris were made from wheat and paste placed in a trough on the day of the murder, then water was added for several days, until finally the mixture was kneaded into a mold of Osiris and taken to the temple to be buried (the sacred grain for these cakes were grown only in the temple fields). Molds were made from the wood of a red tree in the forms of the sixteen dismembered parts of Osiris, the cakes of \"divine\" bread were made from each mold, placed in a silver chest and set near the head of the god with ''the inward parts of Osiris'' as described in the Book of the Dead (XVII).\n\n== <!-- [[Osiris and his council]] links here -->Judgement ==\n\nThe idea of divine justice being exercised after death for wrongdoing during life is first encountered during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] in a 6th dynasty tomb containing fragments of what would be described later as the [[Maat#42 Confessions (Papyrus of Ani)|Negative Confessions]] performed in front of the 42 [[Assessors of Maat|Assessors of Ma'at]].<ref>\"Studies in Comparative Religion\", General editor, E.

Serapis was often treated as the consort of Isis and became the patron deity of the Ptolemies' capital, Alexandria.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2003|pp=127\u2013128}} Serapis's origins are not known. Some ancient authors claim the cult of Serapis was established at Alexandria by [[Alexander the Great]] himself, but most who discuss the subject of Serapis's origins give a story similar to that by Plutarch. Writing about 400 years after the fact, Plutarch claimed that [[Ptolemy I]] established the cult after dreaming of a colossal statue at [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] in Anatolia. His councillors identified as a statue of the Greek god [[Pluto (god)|Pluto]] and said that the Egyptian name for Pluto was Serapis. This name may have been a Hellenization of \"Osiris-Apis\".<ref>[[Fran\u00e7oise Dunand]] and Christiane Zivie-Coche (2004), ''Gods and Men in Egypt: 3000 BCE to 395 CE'', pp. 214\u2013215</ref> Osiris-Apis was a patron deity of the [[Memphite Necropolis]] and the father of the [[Apis (god)|Apis bull]] who was worshipped there, and texts from Ptolemaic times treat \"Serapis\" as the Greek translation of \"Osiris-Apis\". But little of the early evidence for Serapis's cult comes from Memphis, and much of it comes from the Mediterranean world with no reference to an Egyptian origin for Serapis, so Mark Smith expresses doubt that Serapis originated as a Greek form of Osiris-Apis's name and leaves open the possibility that Serapis originated outside Egypt.{{sfnp|Smith|2017|pp=390\u2013394}}\n\n===Destruction of cult===\n[[Image:Philae, seen from the water, Aswan, Egypt, Oct 2004.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philae Island]].]]\nThe cult of Isis and Osiris continued at [[Philae]] until at least the 450s CE, long after the imperial decrees of the late 4th century that ordered the closing of temples to \"[[pagan]]\" gods.

Odoacer's deposition of Romulus Augustulus is traditionally seen as marking the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|end of the Western Roman Empire]].{{efn|\"Odoacer was the first barbarian who reigned over Italy, over a people who had once asserted their just superiority above the rest of mankind.\" [[Edward Gibbon]], ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter XXXVI.{{sfn|Gibbon|1998|p=716}}}}\n\nThough the real power in [[Italy]] was in his hands, he represented himself as the [[patronage in ancient Rome|client]] of the [[Eastern Roman Emperor|emperor in Constantinople]], [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]]. Odoacer generally used the Roman honorific ''patrician,'' granted by the Zeno at the time, but was referred to as a king ({{lang-la|rex}}) in many documents. He himself used it in the only surviving official document that emanated from his chancery, and it was also used by the [[consul]] [[Decius Marius Venantius Basilius|Basilius]].{{sfn|Martindale|1980|p=791\u2013793}}{{efn|[[Marcellinus Comes|Marcellinus]], [[Cassiodorus]], and some [[Papal]] documents, which come the closest to implying official use of the title, all refer to him as ''rex'' (or one of its declensions). [[Jordanes]] at one point refers to him as ''Gothorum Romanorumque regnator'': ruler of the Goths and the Romans. He is called an ''autokrator'' (autocrat) and a ''tyrannos'' (usurper, tyrant) in [[Procopius]]' ''Bellum Gothicum''. The only reference to Odoacer as \"King of Italy\" is in [[Victor Vitensis]]: ''Odouacro Italiae regi''.}} Odoacer introduced few important changes into the administrative system of Italy. He had the support of the [[Roman Senate]] and was able to distribute land to his followers without much opposition. Unrest among his warriors led to violence in 477\u2013478, but no such disturbances occurred during the later period of his reign. Although Odoacer was an [[Arianism|Arian Christian]], he rarely intervened in the affairs of the [[Trinitarian]] [[state church of the Roman Empire]].<!-- explained below in the article; a cite here should not be necessary -->\n\nLikely of [[East Germanic]] descent, Odoacer was a military leader in Italy who led the revolt of [[Heruli]]an, [[Rugians|Rugian]], and [[Scirian]] soldiers that deposed [[Romulus Augustulus]] on 4 September AD 476. Augustulus had been declared Western Roman Emperor by his father, the rebellious general of the army in Italy, less than a year before, but had been unable to gain allegiance or recognition beyond central Italy. With the backing of the Roman Senate, Odoacer thenceforth ruled Italy autonomously, paying lip service to the authority of [[Julius Nepos]], the previous Western emperor, and Zeno, the emperor of the East. Upon Nepos's murder in 480 Odoacer invaded [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], to punish the murderers. He did so, executing the conspirators, but within two years also conquered the region and incorporated it into his domain.\n\nWhen [[Illus]], master of soldiers of the Eastern Empire, asked for Odoacer's help in 484 in his struggle to depose Zeno, Odoacer invaded Zeno's westernmost provinces. The emperor responded first by inciting the [[Rugii]] of present-day [[Austria]] to attack [[Italy]]. During the winter of 487\u2013488 Odoacer crossed the [[Danube]] and defeated the Rugii in their own territory. Zeno also appointed the [[Ostrogothic|Ostrogoth]] [[Theodoric the Great]] who was menacing the borders of the Eastern Empire, to be king of Italy, turning one troublesome, nominal vassal against another.  Theodoric invaded Italy in 489 and by August 490 had captured almost the entire peninsula, forcing Odoacer to take refuge in [[Ravenna]]. The city surrendered on 5 March 493; Theodoric invited Odoacer to a banquet of reconciliation and instead of forging an alliance, killed the unsuspecting king.\n\n==Ethnicity==\nExcept for the fact that he was not considered ''Roman'', Odoacer's precise ethnic origins are not known.{{efn|For more on this, see: Stefan Krautschick, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4435971 \"Zwei Aspekte des Jahres 476\", ''Historia: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Alte Geschichte''], '''35''' (1986), pp. 344\u2013371.}} Most scholars consider him to be at least partly of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] descent. It can however be said that his family origins lie in the empire of [[Attila]].\n\n[[Jordanes]] associated him with several of the [[East Germanic]] tribes of the [[Middle Danube]] who had arrived there during the time of Attila's empire, including the [[Scirii]], [[Heruli]], and [[Rugii]]. In several passages he named him king of the [[Turcilingi]], which is a people, or perhaps a dynasty, that is mentioned by no other historical source. Modern historians also propose connections with [[Goths]], [[Huns]] or the [[Thuringii]]. While in one passage in his ''[[Getica]]'', Jordanes describes Odoacer as king of the [[Turcilingi]] (''Torcilingorum rex'') with Scirii and Heruli followers.{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=119 [XLVI.242]}}, in another passage (LVII.291) he mentions Italy during Odoacer's reign being under the tyranny of Turcilingi and Rogii. In his ''[[Romana (Jordanes)|Romana]]'', the same author defines Odoacer as a descendant of the [[Rugii]] (or of a person named Rogus, ''Odoacer genere Rogus'') with Turcilingi, Rugian and Heruli followers.{{efn|See:Jordanes, ''Romana'' 344.}} It has been pointed out that Attila had an uncle of the name Rogus and suggested that Odoacer may have been seen as his descendant.{{sfn|Reynolds|1946|p=44}}\n\nIn a fragment from a history of [[Priscus]], reproduced by [[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch]], Odoacer is described as a man of the Scirii, the son of Edeco, and brother of [[Onoulphus|Hunuulf]] who killed [[Armatus]] in the eastern Roman empire.{{sfn|Kim|2013|pp=98\u201399}} However, it is unclear whether this Edeko is identical to one\u2014or both\u2014men of the same name who lived at this time: one was an ambassador of [[Attila]] to the court in [[Constantinople]], and escorted [[Priscus]] and other Imperial dignitaries back to Attila's camp. He was described by Priscus as a Hun. The other is mentioned by [[Jordanes]] as a leader of the [[Scirii]], along with Hunuulf (perhaps his son), who were soundly defeated by the Ostrogoths at the [[Battle of Bolia]] in [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia]] about 469. {{efn|See: Priscus, fragments 7 and 8, translated by C.D. Gordon, ''The Age of Attila: Fifth Century Byzantium and the Barbarians'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1966), pp. 70\u201393}} \n\nThe ''[[Anonymus Valesianus]]'' agrees that his father's name was [[Edeko]] (Edika), and refers to him leading Scirii and Heruli. \n\n[[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] called him a [[Goths|Goth]].{{sfn|MacGeorge|2002|p=284}} The sixth-century chronicler, [[Marcellinus Comes]], called him \"king of the Goths\" (''Odoacer rex Gothorum'').{{efn|Marcellinus Comes, ''Chronicon'', s. a. 476.}}\n\nMany scholars such as medieval scholar, Michael Frasetto, accept that Odoacer was of Scirian heritage.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=275}} Scholars are still to some extent divided about the evidence for Odoacer's father being a Hun, and also about the identity of the Torcilingi. Historian, Erik Jensen, avows that Odoacer was born to a Gothic mother and that his father, Edeco, was a [[Hun]].{{sfn|Jensen|2018|p=16}} Bruce Macbain, noting that the \"ancient sources exhibit considerable confusion over Odovacer's tribal affiliation, identifying him variously as a Skirian, a Rogian and/or Torcilingian, a Herul, and even a Goth\", subsequently concludes that \"not a single source calls him a Hun\".{{sfn|Macbain|1983|p=325}} Historian Penny MacGeorge points out that the confusion about Odoacer's ethnicity is exaggerated. Believing that the Torcilingi were simply a mistake for Thuringii, she believes that the claims he was a Hun \"can almost certainly be dismissed\". She asserts instead that Odoacer was \"surely Germanic, probably half-Scirian, half-Thuringian, and he may have had connections with other tribes through intermarriage\".{{sfn|MacGeorge|2002|p=286}}\n\n===Onomastic evidence===\nThe origin of the name Odoacer, which may give indications as to his tribal affiliation, is debated. One suggestion is that Odoacer is derived from the Germanic ''[[Audawakrs|*Audawakraz]]'' (Gothic ''*Audawakrs''), from ''aud-'' \"wealth\" and ''wakr-'' \"vigilant\" or combined, \"watcher of the wealth.\"{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=699}} This form finds a cognate in another Germanic language, the titular ''Eadwacer'' of the Old English poem ''[[Wulf and Eadwacer]]'' (where Old English renders the earlier Germanic sound ''au-'' as ''ea-'').{{sfn|Voyles|1992|p=141}} On the other hand, historians Robert L. Reynolds and Robert S. Lopez explored the possibility that the name Odoacer was not Germanic, making several arguments that his ethnic background might lie elsewhere. One of these is that his name, \"Odoacer\", for which an etymology in Germanic languages had not been convincingly found, could be a form of the [[Turkic languages|Turkish]] \"Ot-toghar\" (\"grass-born\" or \"fire-born\"), or the shorter form \"Ot-ghar\" (\"herder\").{{sfn|Reynolds|Lopez|1946|p=45}}\n\n== Before Italy ==\nPossibly the earliest recorded incident involving Odoacer is from a fragment of a chronicle preserved in the ''Decem Libri Historiarum'' of [[Gregory of Tours]]. Two chapters of his work recount, in a confused or confusing manner, a number of battles fought by King [[Childeric I]] of the Franks, [[Aegidius]], Count Paul, and one \"[[Adovacrius]]\" or \"Odovacrius\".{{sfn|Gregory of Tours|1974|p=132 [II.18\u201319]}} If this is an account of Aegidius' victory over the [[Visigoths]], otherwise known from the ''Chronicle'' of [[Hydatius]], then this occurred in 463. Reynolds and Lopez, in their article mentioned above, suggested that this \"Adovacrius\" or \"Odovacrius\" may be the same person as the future king of Italy.{{sfn|Reynolds|Lopez|1946|p=45}} \n\nThe first certain act recorded for Odoacer was shortly before he arrived in Italy. [[Eugippius]], in his ''Life of Saint Severinus'', records how a group of barbarians on their way to Italy had stopped to pay their respects to the holy man. Odoacer, at the time \"a young man, of tall figure, clad in poor clothes\", learned from [[Severinus of Noricum|Severinus]] that he would one day become famous.{{sfn|Thompson|1982|p=63}} Despite that Odoacer was an Arian Christian and Severinus was Catholic, the latter left a deep impression on him.{{sfn|Thompson|1982|p=63}} When Odoacer took his leave, Severinus made one final comment which proved prophetic: \"Go to Italy, go, now covered with mean hides; soon you will make rich gifts to many.\"{{sfn|Eugippius|1965|p=64}}{{efn|Bieler explains in a footnote that \"make rich gifts to many\" refers to the custom of Germanic war leaders giving lavishly to their followers, because \"generosity was one of the virtues which a king was supposed to have.\"}}\n\n==Leader of the ''foederati''==\nBy 470, Odoacer had become an officer in what remained of the Roman Army. Although Jordanes writes of Odoacer as invading Italy \"as leader of the Sciri, the [[Heruli]] and allies of various races\",{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=119 [XLVI.242]}} modern writers describe him as being part of the Roman military establishment, based on [[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch]]'s statement that Odoacer was on the side of [[Ricimer]] at the beginning of his battle with the emperor [[Anthemius]] in 472.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=275}}{{efn|Also See: John of Antioch, fragment 209; translated by C. D. Gordon, ''Age of Attila'', p. 122. [[Procopius]] describes him as one of the Emperor's bodyguards, only agreeing to this position if placed in charge of them.{{sfn|Prokopios|2014|p=251 [5.1.6]}}}} In his capacity as a soldier suddenly pitted against Anthemius, since he had switched sides to join with Ricimer, Odoacer had \"hastened the emperor's downfall.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=184}} \n\n[[File:Romulus Augustulus and Odoacer.jpg|thumb|left|Romulus Augustus resigns the Crown (from a 19th-century illustration).]]\n\nWhen [[Flavius Orestes|Orestes]] was in 475 appointed ''[[Magister militum]]'' and [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] by the Western Roman Emperor [[Julius Nepos]], Odoacer became head of the Germanic ''[[foederati]]'' of Italy (the Scirian\u2014Herulic ''foederati''). Under the command of Orestes were significant contingents of Germanic peoples made up mostly of Rugii and Heruli tribesmen.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2009|p=367}} Before the end of that year Orestes had rebelled and driven Nepos from Italy.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2009|p=367}} Orestes then proclaimed his young son Romulus the new emperor as [[Romulus Augustulus|Romulus Augustus, called \"Augustulus\"]] (31 October).{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=405}} At this time, Odoacer was a soldier rising through the ranks.{{sfn|Thompson|1982|pp=63\u201364}} However, Nepos reorganized his court in [[Salona]], Dalmatia and received homage and affirmation from the remaining fragments of the Western Empire beyond Italy and, most importantly, from Constantinople, which refused to accept Augustulus, Zeno having branded him and his father as traitors and usurpers.{{sfn|Bury|1958|p=190}}\n\nAbout this time the ''foederati'', who had been quartered in Italy all of these years, had grown weary of this arrangement. In the words of [[J. B. Bury]], \"They desired to have roof-trees and lands of their own, and they petitioned Orestes to reward them for their services, by granting them lands and settling them permanently in Italy\".{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=406}} Orestes refused their petition, and they turned to Odoacer to lead their revolt against Orestes. Orestes was killed at [[Placentia, Italy|Placentia]] along with his brother Paulus outside [[Ravenna]]. The Germanic ''foederati,'' the Scirians and the Heruli, as well as a large segment of the Italic Roman army, then proclaimed Odoacer ''rex Italiae'' (\"king of Italy\").{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=406}} In 476 Odoacer advanced to Ravenna and captured the city, compelling the young emperor Romulus to abdicate on 4 September. According to the ''Anonymus Valesianus'', Odoacer was moved by Romulus's youth and his beauty to not only spare his life but give him a pension of 6,000 ''[[solidus (coin)|solidi]]'' and sent him to [[Campania]] to live with his relatives.{{sfn|Bernard|1970|p=19}}{{efn|Also see: ''Anonymus Valesianus'', 8.38.

The message was clear: the West no longer required a separate Emperor, for \"one monarch sufficed [to rule] the world\". In response, Zeno accepted their gifts and this essentially brought to end any puppet emperors in the West, with Nepos banished and Anthemius dead.{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=407}} The Eastern Emperor then conferred upon Odoacer the title of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]] and granted him legal authority to govern Italy in the name of Rome.{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=428\u2013429}} Zeno also suggested that Odoacer should receive Nepos back as Emperor in the West,{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=429}} \"if he truly wished to act with justice.\"{{efn|See:Malchus, fragment 10, translated in C. D. Gordon, ''The Age of Attila'', pp. 127\u2013129.}} Although he accepted the title of Patrician from Zeno, Odoacer did not invite Julius Nepos to return to Rome, and the latter remained in Dalmatia until his death. Odoacer was careful to observe form, however, and made a pretence of acting on Nepos's authority, even issuing coins with both his image and that of Zeno.{{sfn|Elton|2018|p=219}} Following Nepos's murder in 480, who was killed while waiting in Dalmatia,{{sfn|Bunson|1995|p=292}} Zeno became sole Emperor.{{sfn|Grant|1998|pp=46\u201347}}\n\nBury, however, disagrees that Odoacer's assumption of power marked the fall of the Roman Empire:\n{{bquote|It stands out prominently as an important stage in the process of the dismemberment of the Empire. It belongs to the same catalogue of chronological dates which includes A.D. 418, when Honorius settled the Goths in [[Gallia Aquitania|Aquitaine]], and A.D. 435, when [[Valentinian III|Valentinian]] ceded African lands to the [[Vandals]]. In A.D. 476 the same principle of disintegration was first applied to Italy. The settlement of Odovacar's East Germans, with Zeno's acquiescence, began the process by which Italian soil was to pass into the hands of Ostrogoths and [[Lombards]], [[Franks]] and [[Normans]]. And Odovacar's title of king emphasised the significance of the change.{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=409}}}}\n\n==King of Italy<!--'Kingdom of Italy (476\u2013493)' redirects here-->==\n{{Infobox country\n|native_name            = ''Regnum Italicum''\n|conventional_long_name = Kingdom of Italy\n|common_name            = Italy\n|era                    = [[Late Antiquity]] and [[Early Middle Ages]]\n|government_type        = [[Monarchy]]\n|year_start             = 476\n|year_end               = 493\n|status                 = [[Vassal state]]\n|status_text            = [[Vassal state]] of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]\n|event_start            = [[Battle of Ravenna (476)|Battle of Ravenna]]\n|date_start             = 2 September\n|event_end              = [[Theodoric the Great]] assassinates Odoacer\n|date_end               = 2 February\n|event1                 = [[Romulus Augustulus]] abdicates\n|date_event1            = 4 September 476\n|p1                     = Roman Italy{{!}}Italia\n|p2                     = Sicilia (Roman province){{!}}Sicilia\n|p3                     = Dalmatia (Roman province){{!}}Dalmatia\n|flag_p1                = Julius Nepos Tremissis.jpg\n|flag_p2                = Julius Nepos Tremissis.jpg\n|flag_p3                = Julius Nepos Tremissis.jpg\n|border_p1              = no\n|border_p2              = no\n|border_p3              = no\n|s1                     = Ostrogothic Kingdom\n|flag_s1                = Teodorico re dei Goti (493-526) white.jpg\n|image_flag             = \n|flag                   =\n|flag_type              =\n|image_coat             =\n|symbol_type_article    =\n|symbol_type            =\n|image_map              = Odoacer 480ad.jpg\n|image_map_caption      = The Kingdom of Italy (under Odoacer) in 480 AD.\n|capital                = [[Ravenna]]\n|common_languages       = [[Latin language|Latin]]<br>[[Vulgar Latin]]<br>[[Gothic language|Gothic]]\n|religion               = [[Arianism]]<br>[[Chalcedonian Christianity]]\n|currency               = [[Solidus (coin)|Solidus]]\n|leader1                = Odoacer\n|year_leader1           = 476\u2013493 AD\n|title_leader           = [[King of Italy#Rex Itialiae|Rex]]\n|legislature            = [[Roman Senate]]\n}}\n\nIn 476, the barbarian warlord Odoacer founded the Kingdom of Italy as its first [[King of Italy|king]], initiating a new era over Roman lands. According to Jordanes, at the beginning of his reign he \"slew Count Bracila at Ravenna that he might inspire a fear of himself among the Romans.\"{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=119 [XLVI.243]}} He took many military actions to strengthen his control over Italy and its neighboring areas. He achieved a solid diplomatic coup by inducing the Vandal king [[Gaiseric]] to cede Sicily to him. Noting that \"Odovacar seized power in August of 476, Gaiseric died in January 477, and the sea usually became closed to navigation around the beginning of November\", F.M. Clover dates this cession to September or October 476.{{sfn|Clover|1999|p=237}} When Julius Nepos was murdered by two of his retainers in his country house near Salona (May 480), Odoacer assumed the duty of pursuing and executing the assassins, and at the same time established his own rule in Dalmatia.{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=410}}\n\nAs Bury points out, \"It is highly important to observe that Odovacar established his political power with the co-operation of the Roman Senate, and this body seems to have given him their loyal support throughout his reign, so far as our meagre sources permit us to draw inferences.\" He regularly nominated members of the Senate to the [[Consul]]ate and other prestigious offices: \"[[Caecina Decius Maximus Basilius|Basilius]], [[Caecina Mavortius Basilius Decius|Decius]], [[Decius Marius Venantius Basilius|Venantius]], and [[Manlius Boethius]] held the consulship and were either Prefects of Rome or Praetorian Prefects; [[Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus|Symmachus]] and [[Rufius Achilius Sividius|Sividius]] were consuls and Prefects of Rome; another senator of old family, Cassiodorus, was appointed a minister of finance.\"{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=409}} A. H. M. Jones also notes that under Odoacer the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] acquired \"enhanced prestige and influence\" in order to counter any desires for restoration of Imperial rule.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=253}} As the most tangible example of this renewed prestige, for the first time since the mid-3rd century copper coins were issued with the legend ''S(enatus) C(onsulto)''. Jones describes these coins as \"fine big copper pieces\", which were \"a great improvement on the miserable little ''[[nummus|nummi]]'' hitherto current\", and not only were they copied by the Vandals in Africa, but they formed the basis of the currency reform by [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius]] in the Eastern Empire.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=254}} \n\nAlthough Odoacer was an [[Arianism|Arian Christian]], his relations with the [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian church hierarchy]] were remarkably good. As G.M. Cook notes in her introduction to [[Magnus Felix Ennodius]]' ''Life of Saint Epiphanius'', he showed great esteem for Bishop [[Epiphanius of Pavia|Epiphanius]]: in response to the bishop's petition, Odoacer granted the inhabitants of [[Liguria]] a five-year immunity from taxes, and again granted his requests for relief from abuses by the [[praetorian prefect]].{{sfn|Ennodius|1942|p=12fn}}{{efn|Cook writes, \"One wonders at [Ennodius'] brevity,\" adding that during \"the thirteen years of Odovacar's mastery of Italy... a period which embraced nearly half the episcopate of Epiphanius\u2014Ennodius devotes but eight sections of the ''vita'' (101\u2013107), five of which are taken up with the restoration of the churches.\" Cook uses Ennodius' brevity as an ''[[argumentum ex silentio]]'' to prove that Odoacer was very supportive of the Church. \"Ennodius was a loyal supporter of Theodoric the Great. Any oppression, therefore, on the part of Odovacar would not be passed over in silence.\" She concludes that Ennodius' silence \"may be construed as an unintentional tribute to the moderation and tolerance of the barbarian king.\"{{sfn|Ennodius|1942|p=12fn}}}} The biography of Pope [[Felix III]] in the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' openly states that the pontiff's tenure occurred during Odoacer's reign without any complaints about the king being registered.{{sfn|Davis|2001|p=41fn}}\n\nIn 487/488, Odoacer led his army to victory against the [[Rugians]] in [[Noricum]], taking their king [[Feletheus]] into captivity; when word that Feletheus' son, [[Frideric|Fredericus]], had returned to his people, Odoacer sent his brother [[Onoulphus]] with an army back to Noricum against him. Onoulphus found it necessary to evacuate the remaining Romans and resettled them in Italy.{{sfn|Amory|1997|p=121}} The remaining Rugians fled and took refuge with the Ostrogoths; the abandoned province was settled by the [[Lombards]] by 493.{{sfn|Paul the Deacon|2003|pp=31\u201333 [XIX]}}\n\n==Fall and death==\nAs Odoacer's position improved, [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], the Eastern Emperor, increasingly saw him as a rival. Odoacer exchanged messages with [[Illus]], who had been in open revolt against Zeno since 484.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=100}}{{efn|Also see: John of Antioch, fragment 214; translated by C. D. Gordon, ''Age of Attila'', p. 152.}} Switching allegiances, Zeno subsequently sought to destroy Odoacer and then promised [[Theodoric the Great]] and his Ostrogoths the Italian peninsula if they were to defeat and remove Odoacer. As both [[Herwig Wolfram]] and Peter Heather point out, Theodoric had his own reasons to agree to this offer: \"Theodoric had enough experience to know (or at least suspect) that Zeno would not, in the long term, tolerate his independent power. When Theodoric rebelled in 485, we are told, he had in mind Zeno's treatment of [[Armatus]]. Armatus defected from Basilicus to Zeno in 476, and was made senior imperial general for life. Within a year, Zeno had him assassinated.\"{{sfn|Heather|1996|p=217}} \n\nIn 489, Theodoric led the Ostrogoths across the [[Julian Alps]] and into Italy. On 28 August, Odoacer [[Battle of Isonzo (489)|met him]] at the [[Isonzo]], only to be defeated.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=50\u201351}}{{efn|For several years the armies of Odoacer and Theodoric marched back and forth as they vied for control of Italy.{{sfn|Delbr\u00fcck|1990|p=289}}}} He withdrew to [[Verona]], reaching its outskirts on 27 September, where he immediately set up a fortified camp. Theodoric followed him and three days later [[Battle of Verona (489)|defeated]] him again.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=51}}{{efn|See also: ''Anonymus Valesianus'', 11.50f. This follows how Thomas Hodgkins explains this confusing chronology of the ''Anonymus Valesianus''; ''Italy and her Invaders'' (Oxford, 1885), vol. 4 p. 214.}} While Odoacer took refuge in [[Ravenna]], Theodoric continued across Italy to [[Mediolanum]], where the majority of Odoacer's army, including his chief general [[Tufa (general)|Tufa]], surrendered to the Ostrogothic king.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=337}}{{efn|Also See:''Anonymus Valesianus'', 11.52.}} Theodoric had no reason to doubt Tufa's loyalty and dispatched his new general to Ravenna with a band of elite soldiers. Herwig Wolfram observes, \"[b]ut Tufa changed sides, the Gothic elite force entrusted to his command was destroyed, and Theodoric suffered his first serious defeat on Italian soil.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=281}} Theodoric recoiled by seeking safety in [[Ticinum]]. Odoacer emerged from Ravenna and started to besiege his rival. While both were fully engaged, the [[Burgundians]] seized the opportunity to plunder and devastated [[Liguria]]. Many Romans were taken into captivity, and did not regain their freedom until Theodoric ransomed them three years later.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=281}}\n\nThe following summer, the Visigothic king [[Alaric II]] demonstrated what Wolfram calls \"one of the rare displays of Gothic solidarity\" and sent military aid to help his kinsman, forcing Odoacer to raise his siege. Theodoric emerged from Ticinum, and on 11 August 490, the armies of the two kings [[Battle of the Adda River|clashed]] on the [[Adda River]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=281}} Odoacer again was defeated and forced back into Ravenna, where Theodoric [[Siege of Ravenna (490\u2013493)|besieged]] him.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=282}} Ravenna proved to be invulnerable, surrounded by marshes and estuaries and easily supplied by small boats from its hinterlands, as Procopius later pointed out in his ''History''.{{sfn|Prokopios|2014|pp=252\u2013253 [5.1.18\u201323]}} Further, Tufa remained at large in the strategic valley of the [[Adige]] near [[Trento|Trent]], and received unexpected reinforcements when dissent amongst Theodoric's ranks led to sizable desertions.{{sfn|Heather|1996|p=219}} That same year, the [[Vandals]] took their turn to strike while both sides were fully engaged and invaded Sicily.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=282}} While Theodoric was engaged with them, his ally Fredericus, king of the Rugians, began to oppress the inhabitants of [[Pavia]], whom the latter's forces had been garrisoned to protect. Once Theodoric intervened in person in late August, 491, his punitive acts drove Fredericus to desert with his followers to Tufa.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=282}}{{efn|Wolfram suggests that sometime in 492 or 493, Fredericus and Tufa quarreled and fought a battle, during which both were killed. To this Wolfram adds, that the Rugians \"rejoined the Gothic king\" (by whom, he means Theodoric).{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=282}}}}\n\nBy this time, however, Odoacer had to have lost all hope of victory. A large-scale sortie he sent out of Ravenna on the night of 9/10 July 491 ended in failure,{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=188}} during which his commander-in-chief, Livilia, along with the best of his Herulian soldiers were killed.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=283}} On 29 August 492, the Goths were about to assemble enough ships at [[Rimini]] to set up an effective blockade of Ravenna. Despite these decisive losses, the war dragged on until 25 February 493 when John, bishop of Ravenna, was able to negotiate a treaty between Theodoric and Odoacer to occupy Ravenna together and share joint rule. After a three-year siege, Theodoric entered the city on 5 March; Odoacer was dead ten days later, slain by Theodoric while they shared a meal.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=283}} Theodoric had plotted to have a group of his followers kill him while the two kings were feasting together in the imperial palace of [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] \"Ad Laurentum\" (\"At the Laurel Grove\"); when this plan went astray, Theodoric drew his sword and struck him on the collarbone. In response to Odoacer's dying question, \"Where is God?\" Theodoric cried, \"This is what you did to my friends.\" Theodoric was said to have stood over the body of his dead rival and exclaimed, \"The man has no bones in his body.\"{{sfn|Amory|1997|p=69}}{{efn|John of Antioch, fragment 214a; translated by C. D. Gordon, reports the statement as, \"There certainly wasn't a bone in this wretched fellow.\" ''Age of Attila'', pp. 182f. Both the ''Anonymus Valesianus'' (11.55) and [[Andreas Agnellus]] (''Liber pontificalis ecclesiae Ravennatis'', ch. 39) places the murder in Ad Laurentum. Herwig Wolfram explains Theodoric's claim of avenging his \"friends\" as recompense for the death of a Rugian royal couple\u2014\"it apparently did not matter that their son was at that very moment in open rebellion against Theodoric.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=283}}}}\n\nNot only did Theodoric slay Odoacer, he thereafter had the betrayed king's loyal followers hunted down and killed as well, an event which left him as the master of Italy.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=287}}{{efn|According to one account, \"That same day, all of Odoacer's army who could be found anywhere were killed by order of Theodoric, as well as all of his family.\"{{efn|See:Anonymus Valesianus'' 11.56}}}} Odoacer's wife Sunigilda was stoned to death, and his brother Onoulphus was killed by archers while seeking refuge in a church. Theodoric exiled Odoacer's son Thela to [[Gaul]], but when he attempted to return to Italy Theodoric had him killed.{{efn|See: John of Antioch, fragment 214a.}} However, Wolfram writes that Sunigilda was starved to death.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=283}} Despite the tragic ending of his domain, followers, and family, Odoacer left an important legacy, in that, he had laid the foundations for a great kingdom in Italy for Theodoric to exploit.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=276}}\n\n{{Early Germanic Kingdoms}}\n{{Former monarchies Italian peninsula}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[Germanic peoples]]\n* [[Barbarian invasions]]\n{{clear}}\n\n====Modern media portrayal====\n*The movie \"[[:sh:476 A.D.

Odoacer's deposition of Romulus Augustulus is traditionally seen as marking the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|end of the Western Roman Empire]].{{efn|\"Odoacer was the first barbarian who reigned over Italy, over a people who had once asserted their just superiority above the rest of mankind.\" [[Edward Gibbon]], ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter XXXVI.{{sfn|Gibbon|1998|p=716}}}}\n\nThough the real power in [[Italy]] was in his hands, he represented himself as the [[patronage in ancient Rome|client]] of the [[Eastern Roman Emperor|emperor in Constantinople]], [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]]. Odoacer generally used the Roman honorific ''patrician,'' granted by the Zeno at the time, but was referred to as a king ({{lang-la|rex}}) in many documents. He himself used it in the only surviving official document that emanated from his chancery, and it was also used by the [[consul]] [[Decius Marius Venantius Basilius|Basilius]].{{sfn|Martindale|1980|p=791\u2013793}}{{efn|[[Marcellinus Comes|Marcellinus]], [[Cassiodorus]], and some [[Papal]] documents, which come the closest to implying official use of the title, all refer to him as ''rex'' (or one of its declensions). [[Jordanes]] at one point refers to him as ''Gothorum Romanorumque regnator'': ruler of the Goths and the Romans. He is called an ''autokrator'' (autocrat) and a ''tyrannos'' (usurper, tyrant) in [[Procopius]]' ''Bellum Gothicum''. The only reference to Odoacer as \"King of Italy\" is in [[Victor Vitensis]]: ''Odouacro Italiae regi''.}} Odoacer introduced few important changes into the administrative system of Italy. He had the support of the [[Roman Senate]] and was able to distribute land to his followers without much opposition. Unrest among his warriors led to violence in 477\u2013478, but no such disturbances occurred during the later period of his reign. Although Odoacer was an [[Arianism|Arian Christian]], he rarely intervened in the affairs of the [[Trinitarian]] [[state church of the Roman Empire]].<!-- explained below in the article; a cite here should not be necessary -->\n\nLikely of [[East Germanic]] descent, Odoacer was a military leader in Italy who led the revolt of [[Heruli]]an, [[Rugians|Rugian]], and [[Scirian]] soldiers that deposed [[Romulus Augustulus]] on 4 September AD 476. Augustulus had been declared Western Roman Emperor by his father, the rebellious general of the army in Italy, less than a year before, but had been unable to gain allegiance or recognition beyond central Italy. With the backing of the Roman Senate, Odoacer thenceforth ruled Italy autonomously, paying lip service to the authority of [[Julius Nepos]], the previous Western emperor, and Zeno, the emperor of the East. Upon Nepos's murder in 480 Odoacer invaded [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], to punish the murderers. He did so, executing the conspirators, but within two years also conquered the region and incorporated it into his domain.\n\nWhen [[Illus]], master of soldiers of the Eastern Empire, asked for Odoacer's help in 484 in his struggle to depose Zeno, Odoacer invaded Zeno's westernmost provinces. The emperor responded first by inciting the [[Rugii]] of present-day [[Austria]] to attack [[Italy]]. During the winter of 487\u2013488 Odoacer crossed the [[Danube]] and defeated the Rugii in their own territory. Zeno also appointed the [[Ostrogothic|Ostrogoth]] [[Theodoric the Great]] who was menacing the borders of the Eastern Empire, to be king of Italy, turning one troublesome, nominal vassal against another.  Theodoric invaded Italy in 489 and by August 490 had captured almost the entire peninsula, forcing Odoacer to take refuge in [[Ravenna]]. The city surrendered on 5 March 493; Theodoric invited Odoacer to a banquet of reconciliation and instead of forging an alliance, killed the unsuspecting king.\n\n==Ethnicity==\nExcept for the fact that he was not considered ''Roman'', Odoacer's precise ethnic origins are not known.{{efn|For more on this, see: Stefan Krautschick, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4435971 \"Zwei Aspekte des Jahres 476\", ''Historia: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Alte Geschichte''], '''35''' (1986), pp. 344\u2013371.}} Most scholars consider him to be at least partly of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] descent. It can however be said that his family origins lie in the empire of [[Attila]].\n\n[[Jordanes]] associated him with several of the [[East Germanic]] tribes of the [[Middle Danube]] who had arrived there during the time of Attila's empire, including the [[Scirii]], [[Heruli]], and [[Rugii]]. In several passages he named him king of the [[Turcilingi]], which is a people, or perhaps a dynasty, that is mentioned by no other historical source. Modern historians also propose connections with [[Goths]], [[Huns]] or the [[Thuringii]]. While in one passage in his ''[[Getica]]'', Jordanes describes Odoacer as king of the [[Turcilingi]] (''Torcilingorum rex'') with Scirii and Heruli followers.{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=119 [XLVI.242]}}, in another passage (LVII.291) he mentions Italy during Odoacer's reign being under the tyranny of Turcilingi and Rogii. In his ''[[Romana (Jordanes)|Romana]]'', the same author defines Odoacer as a descendant of the [[Rugii]] (or of a person named Rogus, ''Odoacer genere Rogus'') with Turcilingi, Rugian and Heruli followers.{{efn|See:Jordanes, ''Romana'' 344.}} It has been pointed out that Attila had an uncle of the name Rogus and suggested that Odoacer may have been seen as his descendant.{{sfn|Reynolds|1946|p=44}}\n\nIn a fragment from a history of [[Priscus]], reproduced by [[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch]], Odoacer is described as a man of the Scirii, the son of Edeco, and brother of [[Onoulphus|Hunuulf]] who killed [[Armatus]] in the eastern Roman empire.{{sfn|Kim|2013|pp=98\u201399}} However, it is unclear whether this Edeko is identical to one\u2014or both\u2014men of the same name who lived at this time: one was an ambassador of [[Attila]] to the court in [[Constantinople]], and escorted [[Priscus]] and other Imperial dignitaries back to Attila's camp. He was described by Priscus as a Hun. The other is mentioned by [[Jordanes]] as a leader of the [[Scirii]], along with Hunuulf (perhaps his son), who were soundly defeated by the Ostrogoths at the [[Battle of Bolia]] in [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia]] about 469. {{efn|See: Priscus, fragments 7 and 8, translated by C.D. Gordon, ''The Age of Attila: Fifth Century Byzantium and the Barbarians'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1966), pp. 70\u201393}} \n\nThe ''[[Anonymus Valesianus]]'' agrees that his father's name was [[Edeko]] (Edika), and refers to him leading Scirii and Heruli. \n\n[[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] called him a [[Goths|Goth]].{{sfn|MacGeorge|2002|p=284}} The sixth-century chronicler, [[Marcellinus Comes]], called him \"king of the Goths\" (''Odoacer rex Gothorum'').{{efn|Marcellinus Comes, ''Chronicon'', s. a. 476.}}\n\nMany scholars such as medieval scholar, Michael Frasetto, accepts that Odoacer was of Scirian heritage.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=275}} Scholars are still to some extent divided about the evidence for Odoacer's father being a Hun, and also about the identity of the Torcilingi. Historian, Erik Jensen, avows that Odoacer was born to a Gothic mother and that his father, Edeco, was a [[Hun]].{{sfn|Jensen|2018|p=16}} Bruce Macbain, noting that the \"ancient sources exhibit considerable confusion over Odovacer's tribal affiliation, identifying him variously as a Skirian, a Rogian and/or Torcilingian, a Herul, and even a Goth\", subsequently concludes that \"not a single source calls him a Hun\".{{sfn|Macbain|1983|p=325}} Historian Penny MacGeorge points out that the confusion about Odoacer's ethnicity is exaggerated. Believing that the Torcilingi were simply a mistake for Thuringii, she believes that the claims he was a Hun \"can almost certainly be dismissed\". She asserts instead that Odoacer was \"surely Germanic, probably half-Scirian, half-Thuringian, and he may have had connections with other tribes through intermarriage\".{{sfn|MacGeorge|2002|p=286}}\n\n===Onomastic evidence===\nThe origin of the name Odoacer, which may give indications as to his tribal affiliation, is debated. One suggestion is that Odoacer is derived from the Germanic ''[[Audawakrs|*Audawakraz]]'' (Gothic ''*Audawakrs''), from ''aud-'' \"wealth\" and ''wakr-'' \"vigilant\" or combined, \"watcher of the wealth.\"{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=699}} This form finds a cognate in another Germanic language, the titular ''Eadwacer'' of the Old English poem ''[[Wulf and Eadwacer]]'' (where Old English renders the earlier Germanic sound ''au-'' as ''ea-'').{{sfn|Voyles|1992|p=141}} On the other hand, historians Robert L. Reynolds and Robert S. Lopez explored the possibility that the name Odoacer was not Germanic, making several arguments that his ethnic background might lie elsewhere. One of these is that his name, \"Odoacer\", for which an etymology in Germanic languages had not been convincingly found, could be a form of the [[Turkic languages|Turkish]] \"Ot-toghar\" (\"grass-born\" or \"fire-born\"), or the shorter form \"Ot-ghar\" (\"herder\").{{sfn|Reynolds|Lopez|1946|p=45}}\n\n== Before Italy ==\nPossibly the earliest recorded incident involving Odoacer is from a fragment of a chronicle preserved in the ''Decem Libri Historiarum'' of [[Gregory of Tours]]. Two chapters of his work recount, in a confused or confusing manner, a number of battles fought by King [[Childeric I]] of the Franks, [[Aegidius]], Count Paul, and one \"[[Adovacrius]]\" or \"Odovacrius\".{{sfn|Gregory of Tours|1974|p=132 [II.18\u201319]}} If this is an account of Aegidius' victory over the [[Visigoths]], otherwise known from the ''Chronicle'' of [[Hydatius]], then this occurred in 463. Reynolds and Lopez, in their article mentioned above, suggested that this \"Adovacrius\" or \"Odovacrius\" may be the same person as the future king of Italy.{{sfn|Reynolds|Lopez|1946|p=45}} \n\nThe first certain act recorded for Odoacer was shortly before he arrived in Italy. [[Eugippius]], in his ''Life of Saint Severinus'', records how a group of barbarians on their way to Italy had stopped to pay their respects to the holy man. Odoacer, at the time \"a young man, of tall figure, clad in poor clothes\", learned from [[Severinus of Noricum|Severinus]] that he would one day become famous.{{sfn|Thompson|1982|p=63}} Despite that Odoacer was an Arian Christian and Severinus was Catholic, the latter left a deep impression on him.{{sfn|Thompson|1982|p=63}} When Odoacer took his leave, Severinus made one final comment which proved prophetic: \"Go to Italy, go, now covered with mean hides; soon you will make rich gifts to many.\"{{sfn|Eugippius|1965|p=64}}{{efn|Bieler explains in a footnote that \"make rich gifts to many\" refers to the custom of Germanic war leaders giving lavishly to their followers, because \"generosity was one of the virtues which a king was supposed to have.\"}}\n\n==Leader of the ''foederati''==\nBy 470, Odoacer had become an officer in what remained of the Roman Army. Although Jordanes writes of Odoacer as invading Italy \"as leader of the Sciri, the [[Heruli]] and allies of various races\",{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=119 [XLVI.242]}} modern writers describe him as being part of the Roman military establishment, based on [[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch]]'s statement that Odoacer was on the side of [[Ricimer]] at the beginning of his battle with the emperor [[Anthemius]] in 472.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=275}}{{efn|Also See: John of Antioch, fragment 209; translated by C. D. Gordon, ''Age of Attila'', p. 122. [[Procopius]] describes him as one of the Emperor's bodyguards, only agreeing to this position if placed in charge of them.{{sfn|Prokopios|2014|p=251 [5.1.6]}}}} In his capacity as a soldier suddenly pitted against Anthemius, since he had switched sides to join with Ricimer, Odoacer had \"hastened the emperor's downfall.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=184}} \n\n[[File:Romulus Augustulus and Odoacer.jpg|thumb|left|Romulus Augustus resigns the Crown (from a 19th-century illustration).]]\n\nWhen [[Flavius Orestes|Orestes]] was in 475 appointed ''[[Magister militum]]'' and [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] by the Western Roman Emperor [[Julius Nepos]], Odoacer became head of the Germanic ''[[foederati]]'' of Italy (the Scirian\u2014Herulic ''foederati''). Under the command of Orestes were significant contingents of Germanic peoples made up mostly of Rugii and Heruli tribesmen.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2009|p=367}} Before the end of that year Orestes had rebelled and driven Nepos from Italy.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2009|p=367}} Orestes then proclaimed his young son Romulus the new emperor as [[Romulus Augustulus|Romulus Augustus, called \"Augustulus\"]] (31 October).{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=405}} At this time, Odoacer was a soldier rising through the ranks.{{sfn|Thompson|1982|pp=63\u201364}} However, Nepos reorganized his court in [[Salona]], Dalmatia and received homage and affirmation from the remaining fragments of the Western Empire beyond Italy and, most importantly, from Constantinople, which refused to accept Augustulus, Zeno having branded him and his father as traitors and usurpers.{{sfn|Bury|1958|p=190}}\n\nAbout this time the ''foederati'', who had been quartered in Italy all of these years, had grown weary of this arrangement. In the words of [[J. B. Bury]], \"They desired to have roof-trees and lands of their own, and they petitioned Orestes to reward them for their services, by granting them lands and settling them permanently in Italy\".{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=406}} Orestes refused their petition, and they turned to Odoacer to lead their revolt against Orestes. Orestes was killed at [[Placentia, Italy|Placentia]] along with his brother Paulus outside [[Ravenna]]. The Germanic ''foederati,'' the Scirians and the Heruli, as well as a large segment of the Italic Roman army, then proclaimed Odoacer ''rex Italiae'' (\"king of Italy\").{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=406}} In 476 Odoacer advanced to Ravenna and captured the city, compelling the young emperor Romulus to abdicate on 4 September. According to the ''Anonymus Valesianus'', Odoacer was moved by Romulus's youth and his beauty to not only spare his life but give him a pension of 6,000 ''[[solidus (coin)|solidi]]'' and sent him to [[Campania]] to live with his relatives.{{sfn|Bernard|1970|p=19}}{{efn|Also see: ''Anonymus Valesianus'', 8.38.

The message was clear: the West no longer required a separate Emperor, for \"one monarch sufficed [to rule] the world\". In response, Zeno accepted their gifts and this essentially brought to end any puppet emperors in the West, with Nepos banished and Anthemius dead.{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=407}} The Eastern Emperor then conferred upon Odoacer the title of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]] and granted him legal authority to govern Italy in the name of Rome.{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=428\u2013429}} Zeno also suggested that Odoacer should receive Nepos back as Emperor in the West,{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=429}} \"if he truly wished to act with justice.\"{{efn|See:Malchus, fragment 10, translated in C. D. Gordon, ''The Age of Attila'', pp. 127\u2013129.}} Although he accepted the title of Patrician from Zeno, Odoacer did not invite Julius Nepos to return to Rome, and the latter remained in Dalmatia until his death. Odoacer was careful to observe form, however, and made a pretence of acting on Nepos's authority, even issuing coins with both his image and that of Zeno.{{sfn|Elton|2018|p=219}} Following Nepos's murder in 480, who was killed while waiting in Dalmatia,{{sfn|Bunson|1995|p=292}} Zeno became sole Emperor.{{sfn|Grant|1998|pp=46\u201347}}\n\nBury, however, disagrees that Odoacer's assumption of power marked the fall of the Roman Empire:\n{{bquote|It stands out prominently as an important stage in the process of the dismemberment of the Empire. It belongs to the same catalogue of chronological dates which includes A.D. 418, when Honorius settled the Goths in [[Gallia Aquitania|Aquitaine]], and A.D. 435, when [[Valentinian III|Valentinian]] ceded African lands to the [[Vandals]]. In A.D. 476 the same principle of disintegration was first applied to Italy. The settlement of Odovacar's East Germans, with Zeno's acquiescence, began the process by which Italian soil was to pass into the hands of Ostrogoths and [[Lombards]], [[Franks]] and [[Normans]]. And Odovacar's title of king emphasised the significance of the change.{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=409}}}}\n\n==King of Italy<!--'Kingdom of Italy (476\u2013493)' redirects here-->==\n{{Infobox country\n|native_name            = ''Regnum Italicum''\n|conventional_long_name = Kingdom of Italy\n|common_name            = Italy\n|era                    = [[Late Antiquity]] and [[Early Middle Ages]]\n|government_type        = [[Monarchy]]\n|year_start             = 476\n|year_end               = 493\n|status                 = [[Vassal state]]\n|status_text            = [[Vassal state]] of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]\n|event_start            = [[Battle of Ravenna (476)|Battle of Ravenna]]\n|date_start             = 2 September\n|event_end              = [[Theodoric the Great]] assassinates Odoacer\n|date_end               = 2 February\n|event1                 = [[Romulus Augustulus]] abdicates\n|date_event1            = 4 September 476\n|p1                     = Roman Italy{{!}}Italia\n|p2                     = Sicilia (Roman province){{!}}Sicilia\n|p3                     = Dalmatia (Roman province){{!}}Dalmatia\n|flag_p1                = Julius Nepos Tremissis.jpg\n|flag_p2                = Julius Nepos Tremissis.jpg\n|flag_p3                = Julius Nepos Tremissis.jpg\n|border_p1              = no\n|border_p2              = no\n|border_p3              = no\n|s1                     = Ostrogothic Kingdom\n|flag_s1                = Teodorico re dei Goti (493-526) white.jpg\n|image_flag             = \n|flag                   =\n|flag_type              =\n|image_coat             =\n|symbol_type_article    =\n|symbol_type            =\n|image_map              = Odoacer 480ad.jpg\n|image_map_caption      = The Kingdom of Italy (under Odoacer) in 480 AD.\n|capital                = [[Ravenna]]\n|common_languages       = [[Latin language|Latin]]<br>[[Vulgar Latin]]<br>[[Gothic language|Gothic]]\n|religion               = [[Arianism]]<br>[[Chalcedonian Christianity]]\n|currency               = [[Solidus (coin)|Solidus]]\n|leader1                = Odoacer\n|year_leader1           = 476\u2013493 AD\n|title_leader           = [[King of Italy#Rex Itialiae|Rex]]\n|legislature            = [[Roman Senate]]\n}}\n\nIn 476, the barbarian warlord Odoacer founded the Kingdom of Italy as its first [[King of Italy|king]], initiating a new era over Roman lands. According to Jordanes, at the beginning of his reign he \"slew Count Bracila at Ravenna that he might inspire a fear of himself among the Romans.\"{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=119 [XLVI.243]}} He took many military actions to strengthen his control over Italy and its neighboring areas. He achieved a solid diplomatic coup by inducing the Vandal king [[Gaiseric]] to cede Sicily to him. Noting that \"Odovacar seized power in August of 476, Gaiseric died in January 477, and the sea usually became closed to navigation around the beginning of November\", F.M. Clover dates this cession to September or October 476.{{sfn|Clover|1999|p=237}} When Julius Nepos was murdered by two of his retainers in his country house near Salona (May 480), Odoacer assumed the duty of pursuing and executing the assassins, and at the same time established his own rule in Dalmatia.{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=410}}\n\nAs Bury points out, \"It is highly important to observe that Odovacar established his political power with the co-operation of the Roman Senate, and this body seems to have given him their loyal support throughout his reign, so far as our meagre sources permit us to draw inferences.\" He regularly nominated members of the Senate to the [[Consul]]ate and other prestigious offices: \"[[Caecina Decius Maximus Basilius|Basilius]], [[Caecina Mavortius Basilius Decius|Decius]], [[Decius Marius Venantius Basilius|Venantius]], and [[Manlius Boethius]] held the consulship and were either Prefects of Rome or Praetorian Prefects; [[Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus|Symmachus]] and [[Rufius Achilius Sividius|Sividius]] were consuls and Prefects of Rome; another senator of old family, Cassiodorus, was appointed a minister of finance.\"{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=409}} A. H. M. Jones also notes that under Odoacer the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] acquired \"enhanced prestige and influence\" in order to counter any desires for restoration of Imperial rule.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=253}} As the most tangible example of this renewed prestige, for the first time since the mid-3rd century copper coins were issued with the legend ''S(enatus) C(onsulto)''. Jones describes these coins as \"fine big copper pieces\", which were \"a great improvement on the miserable little ''[[nummus|nummi]]'' hitherto current\", and not only were they copied by the Vandals in Africa, but they formed the basis of the currency reform by [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius]] in the Eastern Empire.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=254}} \n\nAlthough Odoacer was an [[Arianism|Arian Christian]], his relations with the [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian church hierarchy]] were remarkably good. As G.M. Cook notes in her introduction to [[Magnus Felix Ennodius]]' ''Life of Saint Epiphanius'', he showed great esteem for Bishop [[Epiphanius of Pavia|Epiphanius]]: in response to the bishop's petition, Odoacer granted the inhabitants of [[Liguria]] a five-year immunity from taxes, and again granted his requests for relief from abuses by the [[praetorian prefect]].{{sfn|Ennodius|1942|p=12fn}}{{efn|Cook writes, \"One wonders at [Ennodius'] brevity,\" adding that during \"the thirteen years of Odovacar's mastery of Italy... a period which embraced nearly half the episcopate of Epiphanius\u2014Ennodius devotes but eight sections of the ''vita'' (101\u2013107), five of which are taken up with the restoration of the churches.\" Cook uses Ennodius' brevity as an ''[[argumentum ex silentio]]'' to prove that Odoacer was very supportive of the Church. \"Ennodius was a loyal supporter of Theodoric the Great. Any oppression, therefore, on the part of Odovacar would not be passed over in silence.\" She concludes that Ennodius' silence \"may be construed as an unintentional tribute to the moderation and tolerance of the barbarian king.\"{{sfn|Ennodius|1942|p=12fn}}}} The biography of Pope [[Felix III]] in the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' openly states that the pontiff's tenure occurred during Odoacer's reign without any complaints about the king being registered.{{sfn|Davis|2001|p=41fn}}\n\nIn 487/488, Odoacer led his army to victory against the [[Rugians]] in [[Noricum]], taking their king [[Feletheus]] into captivity; when word that Feletheus' son, [[Frideric|Fredericus]], had returned to his people, Odoacer sent his brother [[Onoulphus]] with an army back to Noricum against him. Onoulphus found it necessary to evacuate the remaining Romans and resettled them in Italy.{{sfn|Amory|1997|p=121}} The remaining Rugians fled and took refuge with the Ostrogoths; the abandoned province was settled by the [[Lombards]] by 493.{{sfn|Paul the Deacon|2003|pp=31\u201333 [XIX]}}\n\n==Fall and death==\nAs Odoacer's position improved, [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], the Eastern Emperor, increasingly saw him as a rival. Odoacer exchanged messages with [[Illus]], who had been in open revolt against Zeno since 484.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=100}}{{efn|Also see: John of Antioch, fragment 214; translated by C. D. Gordon, ''Age of Attila'', p. 152.}} Switching allegiances, Zeno subsequently sought to destroy Odoacer and then promised [[Theodoric the Great]] and his Ostrogoths the Italian peninsula if they were to defeat and remove Odoacer. As both [[Herwig Wolfram]] and Peter Heather point out, Theodoric had his own reasons to agree to this offer: \"Theodoric had enough experience to know (or at least suspect) that Zeno would not, in the long term, tolerate his independent power. When Theodoric rebelled in 485, we are told, he had in mind Zeno's treatment of [[Armatus]]. Armatus defected from Basilicus to Zeno in 476, and was made senior imperial general for life. Within a year, Zeno had him assassinated.\"{{sfn|Heather|1996|p=217}} \n\nIn 489, Theodoric led the Ostrogoths across the [[Julian Alps]] and into Italy. On 28 August, Odoacer [[Battle of Isonzo (489)|met him]] at the [[Isonzo]], only to be defeated.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=50\u201351}}{{efn|For several years the armies of Odoacer and Theodoric marched back and forth as they vied for control of Italy.{{sfn|Delbr\u00fcck|1990|p=289}}}} He withdrew to [[Verona]], reaching its outskirts on 27 September, where he immediately set up a fortified camp. Theodoric followed him and three days later [[Battle of Verona (489)|defeated]] him again.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=51}}{{efn|See also: ''Anonymus Valesianus'', 11.50f. This follows how Thomas Hodgkins explains this confusing chronology of the ''Anonymus Valesianus''; ''Italy and her Invaders'' (Oxford, 1885), vol. 4 p. 214.}} While Odoacer took refuge in [[Ravenna]], Theodoric continued across Italy to [[Mediolanum]], where the majority of Odoacer's army, including his chief general [[Tufa (general)|Tufa]], surrendered to the Ostrogothic king.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=337}}{{efn|Also See:''Anonymus Valesianus'', 11.52.}} Theodoric had no reason to doubt Tufa's loyalty and dispatched his new general to Ravenna with a band of elite soldiers. Herwig Wolfram observes, \"[b]ut Tufa changed sides, the Gothic elite force entrusted to his command was destroyed, and Theodoric suffered his first serious defeat on Italian soil.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=281}} Theodoric recoiled by seeking safety in [[Ticinum]]. Odoacer emerged from Ravenna and started to besiege his rival. While both were fully engaged, the [[Burgundians]] seized the opportunity to plunder and devastated [[Liguria]]. Many Romans were taken into captivity, and did not regain their freedom until Theodoric ransomed them three years later.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=281}}\n\nThe following summer, the Visigothic king [[Alaric II]] demonstrated what Wolfram calls \"one of the rare displays of Gothic solidarity\" and sent military aid to help his kinsman, forcing Odoacer to raise his siege. Theodoric emerged from Ticinum, and on 11 August 490, the armies of the two kings [[Battle of the Adda River|clashed]] on the [[Adda River]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=281}} Odoacer again was defeated and forced back into Ravenna, where Theodoric [[Siege of Ravenna (490\u2013493)|besieged]] him.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=282}} Ravenna proved to be invulnerable, surrounded by marshes and estuaries and easily supplied by small boats from its hinterlands, as Procopius later pointed out in his ''History''.{{sfn|Prokopios|2014|pp=252\u2013253 [5.1.18\u201323]}} Further, Tufa remained at large in the strategic valley of the [[Adige]] near [[Trento|Trent]], and received unexpected reinforcements when dissent amongst Theodoric's ranks led to sizable desertions.{{sfn|Heather|1996|p=219}} That same year, the [[Vandals]] took their turn to strike while both sides were fully engaged and invaded Sicily.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=282}} While Theodoric was engaged with them, his ally Fredericus, king of the Rugians, began to oppress the inhabitants of [[Pavia]], whom the latter's forces had been garrisoned to protect. Once Theodoric intervened in person in late August, 491, his punitive acts drove Fredericus to desert with his followers to Tufa.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=282}}{{efn|Wolfram suggests that sometime in 492 or 493, Fredericus and Tufa quarreled and fought a battle, during which both were killed. To this Wolfram adds, that the Rugians \"rejoined the Gothic king\" (by whom, he means Theodoric).{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=282}}}}\n\nBy this time, however, Odoacer had to have lost all hope of victory. A large-scale sortie he sent out of Ravenna on the night of 9/10 July 491 ended in failure,{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=188}} during which his commander-in-chief, Livilia, along with the best of his Herulian soldiers were killed.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=283}} On 29 August 492, the Goths were about to assemble enough ships at [[Rimini]] to set up an effective blockade of Ravenna. Despite these decisive losses, the war dragged on until 25 February 493 when John, bishop of Ravenna, was able to negotiate a treaty between Theodoric and Odoacer to occupy Ravenna together and share joint rule. After a three-year siege, Theodoric entered the city on 5 March; Odoacer was dead ten days later, slain by Theodoric while they shared a meal.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=283}} Theodoric had plotted to have a group of his followers kill him while the two kings were feasting together in the imperial palace of [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] \"Ad Laurentum\" (\"At the Laurel Grove\"); when this plan went astray, Theodoric drew his sword and struck him on the collarbone. In response to Odoacer's dying question, \"Where is God?\" Theodoric cried, \"This is what you did to my friends.\" Theodoric was said to have stood over the body of his dead rival and exclaimed, \"The man has no bones in his body.\"{{sfn|Amory|1997|p=69}}{{efn|John of Antioch, fragment 214a; translated by C. D. Gordon, reports the statement as, \"There certainly wasn't a bone in this wretched fellow.\" ''Age of Attila'', pp. 182f. Both the ''Anonymus Valesianus'' (11.55) and [[Andreas Agnellus]] (''Liber pontificalis ecclesiae Ravennatis'', ch. 39) places the murder in Ad Laurentum. Herwig Wolfram explains Theodoric's claim of avenging his \"friends\" as recompense for the death of a Rugian royal couple\u2014\"it apparently did not matter that their son was at that very moment in open rebellion against Theodoric.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=283}}}}\n\nNot only did Theodoric slay Odoacer, he thereafter had the betrayed king's loyal followers hunted down and killed as well, an event which left him as the master of Italy.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=287}}{{efn|According to one account, \"That same day, all of Odoacer's army who could be found anywhere were killed by order of Theodoric, as well as all of his family.\"{{efn|See:Anonymus Valesianus'' 11.56}}}} Odoacer's wife Sunigilda was stoned to death, and his brother Onoulphus was killed by archers while seeking refuge in a church. Theodoric exiled Odoacer's son Thela to [[Gaul]], but when he attempted to return to Italy Theodoric had him killed.{{efn|See: John of Antioch, fragment 214a.}} However, Wolfram writes that Sunigilda was starved to death.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=283}} Despite the tragic ending of his domain, followers, and family, Odoacer left an important legacy, in that, he had laid the foundations for a great kingdom in Italy for Theodoric to exploit.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=276}}\n\n{{Early Germanic Kingdoms}}\n{{Former monarchies Italian peninsula}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[Germanic peoples]]\n* [[Barbarian invasions]]\n{{clear}}\n\n====Modern media portrayal====\n*The movie \"[[:sh:476 A.D.

The franchise is built around a series of action-adventure games focused on various incarnations of the eponymous [[Prince (Prince of Persia)|Prince]]. The games have been developed and published by several different companies. The first two games in the series, ''[[Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' and ''[[Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame]]'', were published by Br\u00f8derbund. ''[[Prince of Persia 3D]]'', the first to use [[3D computer graphics]], was developed by [[Red Orb Entertainment]] and published by The Learning Company on [[Personal computer|PC]], and developed by [[Avalanche Software]] and published by [[Mattel Interactive]] on [[Sega]] [[Dreamcast]]. [[Ubisoft]] began developing and publishing the series in 2003 with ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]''.\n\nThe series has been rebooted twice since its acquisition by Ubisoft, and has been made into a film, ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (film)|Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', penned in part by Mechner and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in 2010. The franchise also includes ''[[Prince of Persia: The Graphic Novel]]'' and the [[Lego]] line [[Lego Prince of Persia|Lego ''Prince of Persia'']]. The ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' video game series is inspired by ''Prince of Persia''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228044009/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed/|title=The Making Of: Assassin's Creed {{!}} Features {{!}} Edge Online|date=2013-12-28|access-date=2018-04-21}}</ref><ref>The series took inspiration from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]'' by the Slovenian writer [[Vladimir Bartol]], while building upon concepts from the ''Prince of Persia'' series.</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=IGN|title=Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot Discusses Company's Past, Present, & Next-Gen Future - IGN Unfiltered #41|date=2019-04-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ewXj4RO5A&t=2109|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\n{{main|List of Prince of Persia media}}\n\n==Games==\n{{Timeline of release years\n| subtitle = Original series in green<br />''The Sands of Time'' series in yellow<br />Spin-offs in black\n\n| range1 = 1989 \u2013 2002\n| range1_color = #0BDA51 #228B22\n| range2 = 2003 - 2007\n| range2_color = Gold Goldenrod\n| range3 = 2008 \u2013 2009\n| range3_color = Grey Black\n| range4 = 2010 - 2012\n| range4_color = Gold Goldenrod\n| range5 = 2013 - 2017\n| range5_color = #0BDA51 #228B22\n<!--This template does  not accept a \"range6\" parameter\n| range6 = 2018 - \n| range6_color = Grey Black\n-->\n| 1989 = ''[[Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia]]''\n| 1993 = ''[[Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame|The Shadow and the Flame]]''\n| 1999 = ''[[Prince of Persia 3D]]''\n| 2003 = ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time|The Sands of Time]]''\n| 2004 = ''[[Prince of Persia: Warrior Within|Warrior Within]]''\n| 2005a = ''[[Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones|The Two Thrones]]''\n| 2005b =''[[Battles of Prince of Persia]]''\n| 2008a = \n| 2008b = [[Prince of Persia (2008 video game)|''Prince of Persia'' (2008)]]\n| 2008c = ''[[Prince of Persia: The Fallen King|The Fallen King]]''\n| 2010 = ''[[Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands|The Forgotten Sands]]''\n| 2013 = [[Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame|''The Shadow and the Flame'' (remake)]]\n| 2018 = [[Prince of Persia#Prince of Persia: Escape|''Prince of Persia: Escape'']]\n|2007=[[Prince of Persia Classic (2007 video game)|''Prince of Persia Classic'']]}}\n\n===Original trilogy===\n{{main|Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame|Prince of Persia 3D}}\nThe first game in the series, titled ''The Prince'', was created by [[Jordan Mechner]] after the success of ''[[Karateka (video game)|Karateka]]''.

The franchise is built around a series of action-adventure games focused on various incarnations of the eponymous [[Prince (Prince of Persia)|Prince]]. The games have been developed and published by several different companies. The first two games in the series, ''[[Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' and ''[[Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame]]'', were published by Br\u00f8derbund. ''[[Prince of Persia 3D]]'', the first to use [[3D computer graphics]], was developed by [[Red Orb Entertainment]] and published by The Learning Company on [[Personal computer|PC]], and developed by [[Avalanche Software]] and published by [[Mattel Interactive]] on [[Sega]] [[Dreamcast]].

The Ubisoft Montreal team decided on taking the gameplay from ''The Sands of Time'' into an [[open world]] approach, taking advantage of the improved processing power to render larger spaces and crowds. Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the Prince being someone next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], heavily borrowing from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]''.<ref name=\"polygon oral\">{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/10/3/17924770/assassins-creed-an-oral-history-patrice-desilets | title=  Assassin\u2019s Creed: An oral history | first = Richard | last = Moss | date = October 3, 2018 | accessdate = October 3, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> They developed a narrative where the player would control an Assassin that served as a bodyguard for a non-playable Prince, leading them to call this game ''Prince of Persia: Assassin''.

He was Professor and Director of the Classics Department at the [[University of Nottingham]] from 1948 to 1979.\n\nThompson was a pioneer in the study of [[Late Antiquity]], and was for decades the most prominent British scholar in this field. Drawing upon a massive amount of research, Thompson revitalized [[English language|English-language]] scholarship on the history of early [[Germanic peoples]]. Having experienced the barbarity of [[Nazism]] at first hand, Thompson was a convinced [[Marxism|Marxist]], and worked towards detaching the study of Germanic peoples from the ideological bias which had characterized it in the past. \n\n==Early life==\nEdward Arthur Thompson was born on 22 May 1914 in the town of [[Waterford]], Ireland to a strictly [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] family.{{sfn|Markus|1994}} His father, Robert James Thompson, who wass of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent, worked for the [[National Health Insurance]]. His mother, Margaret Wallace, was of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=679}}\n\nThompson graduated from [[The High School, Dublin]], and then entered [[Trinity College Dublin]] with a [[sizar]]ship, a distinction he shared with [[Jonathan Swift]]. He was the first of his family to enter university.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=680}}  Thompson graduated with [[First-class honours|First Class Honours]] in [[Classics]] from Trinity College in 1936, later attributing his selection of the classics as a discipline to the arbitrary choice of his headmaster at The High School.{{sfn|Markus|1994}}\n\nIn 1937\u20131938, Thompson was an Exchange Student in [[Berlin]]. This year was to have a profound influence on his future career. While in Germany, Thompson experienced at first hand the barbarism of [[Nazism]]. These experiences had a major influence on Thompson's future re-romanticised approach to the study of [[Germanic peoples]], which was to characterise his approach to this subject.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=680}}{{sfn|Todd|2004}}\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:Hispania 700 AD.PNG|right|upright=1|thumb|Distribution of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] (700 AD), which was the subject of numerous studies by Thompson]]\nThompson's first appointment in [[academia]], as lecturer in Classics, was a two-year stint at Trinity College Dublin {{spaced ndash}}although initially appointed for one year, Thompson's contract was renewed, and he stayed on (though at a reduced salary) until 1941.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=681}}\n\nAlready prepared to enter [[World War II]] with an enlistment in the [[British Army]], Thompson finally secured an appointment at the [[University of Swansea]], having learned of an opening for somebody who could teach [[Greek language|Greek]] from his friend [[Benjamin Farrington]].{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=681}}\n\nFrom Swansea, Thompson transferred to [[King's College, London]], teaching as a classics lecturer from 1945 to 1948. It was during this time that Thompson's first books, ''[[Ammianus Marcellinus]]'' (1947), and ''A History of Attila and the Huns'' (1948). Both were later reprinted and have retained their influence up to the present day.{{sfn|Todd|2004}}{{sfn|The Times. 2 February 1994}}\n\n==Career at the University of Nottingham==\nThompson moved once more in 1948{{spaced ndash}}this time to direct the classics department at the [[University of Nottingham]], where Thompson worked from 1948 to 1979.{{sfn|Markus|1994}}{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}} During this time, Thompson contributed immensely to the increasing quality of studies of Late Antiquity in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=684}} He was considered the leading scholar of the United Kingdom in this field.{{sfn|The Times. 2 February 1994}}{{sfn|Markus|1996}} He focused primarily on scholarship rather than administrative duties.{{sfn|Todd|2004}}\n\nBy the early 1950s, Thompson's research was increasingly focused on the early Germanic peoples. At this time, very little research had been carried out in this field in the English-speaking world. Unlike future generations of scholars in this field, Thompson carried out his studies without ideological bias.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=686}} Nevertheless, his revulsion towards Nazism, and his sympathy towards [[Marxism]], particularly the theories of [[Friedrich Engels]], are detectable in his research of this important field. His works were pioneering in the field of Germanic studies,{{sfn|Todd|2004}} in which he was the leading scholar of his generation.{{sfn|The Guardian. 31 January 1994}} He helped detach the field from the ideological bias which had characterized it in the past.{{sfn|The Guardian. 31 January 1994}} Thompson published his work ''The Early Germans'' in 1965, which was largely concerned with the changing structure of Germanic society in ancient times.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=687}} His works on early Germanic peoples, such as the [[Visigoths]], quickly became standard reference works on the subject, and were still considered unsurpassed at the time of his death.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=692}} Thompson's use of primary sources to examine the past, and his attempts to establish clarity in the field, have come under criticism from some scholars, who are heavily influenced by [[critical theory]] and consider primary sources unreliable.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=692}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = Edward Thompson... was the leading scholar of his generation on the history of the Germanic migrations...

He died in Nottingham on 1 January 1994.{{sfn|The Times. 2 February 1994}}\n\n==Politics==\nThompson's revulsion towards Nazism, and his rejection of the strict Presbyterianism of his family, made him receptive towards Marxist ideology, which was popular among intellectuals in the 1930s. He was particularly impressed by the works of [[Friedrich Engels]]. Influenced by Benjamin Farrington, Thompson joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] by 1941.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}} The influence of Marxism is easily detected in Thompson's works on a wide variety of subjects.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=686}}\n\nThompson left the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1956, the year of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet Union's intervention in Hungary]]. In later life he belonged to the [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] and referred to himself as a Thompsonist rather than a Marxist. His academic work continued to demonstrate a Marxist-oriented outlook on history. No longer active in political life, he continued his enthusiastic interest for politics.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}} He was strongly opposed to the Soviet handling of the [[Prague Spring]], and criticised British policy in [[Northern Ireland]], deploring the secterian violence being carried out there.{{sfn|Todd|2004}} His interest in the class structure of societies, and in their material basis, continued to direct the structure of his studies.{{sfn|Markus|1994}}\n\n==Personal life==\nIt was while lecturing at King's College that Thompson met his first wife Thelma Marjorie Phelps, a physician, whom he married in 1945.{{sfn|Todd|2004}} They had a son and a daughter, but separated in 1958. In 1964 he married Hazel Joyce Casken, with whom he had a daughter and lived happily until his death.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}}{{sfn|Todd|2004}}\n\n==Works==\n* ''Ammianus Marcellinus'' (London: Cambridge University Press, 1947)\n* ''A History of Attila and the Huns'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1948)\n* ''Roman Reformer and Inventor: New Text of De Rebus Bellicis'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1952)\n* ''The Early Germans'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1965)\n* ''The Visigoths in the Time of Ulfila'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1966)\n* ''The Goths in Spain'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1969)\n* ''The Conversion of the Spanish Suevi to Catholicism'' (in (ed.)

He was Professor and Director of the Classics Department at the [[University of Nottingham]] from 1948 to 1979.\n\nThompson was a pioneer in the study of [[Late Antiquity]], and was for decades the most prominent British scholar in this field. Drawing upon a massive amount of research, Thompson revitalized [[English language|English-language]] scholarship on the history of early [[Germanic peoples]]. Having experienced the barbarity of [[Nazism]] at first hand, Thompson was a convinced [[Marxism|Marxist]], and worked towards detaching the study of Germanic peoples from the ideological bias which had characterized it in the past. \n\n==Early life==\nEdward Arthur Thompson was born on 22 May 1914 in the town of [[Waterford]], Ireland to a strictly [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] family.{{sfn|Markus|1994}} His father, Robert James Thompson, who wass of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent, worked for the [[National Health Insurance]]. His mother, Margaret Wallace, was of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=679}}\n\nThompson graduated from [[The High School, Dublin]], and then entered [[Trinity College Dublin]] with a [[sizar]]ship, a distinction he shared with [[Jonathan Swift]]. He was the first of his family to enter university.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=680}}  Thompson graduated with [[First-class honours|First Class Honours]] in [[Classics]] from Trinity College in 1936, later attributing his selection of the classics as a discipline to the arbitrary choice of his headmaster at The High School.{{sfn|Markus|1994}}\n\nIn 1937\u20131938, Thompson was an Exchange Student in [[Berlin]]. This year was to have a profound influence on his future career. While in Germany, Thompson experienced at first hand the barbarism of [[Nazism]]. These experiences had a major influence on Thompson's future re-romanticised approach to the study of [[Germanic peoples]], which was to characterise his approach to this subject.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=680}}{{sfn|Todd|2004}}\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:Hispania 700 AD.PNG|right|upright=1|thumb|Distribution of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] (700 AD), which was the subject of numerous studies by Thompson]]\nThompson's first appointment in [[academia]], as lecturer in Classics, was a two-year stint at Trinity College Dublin {{spaced ndash}}although initially appointed for one year, Thompson's contract was renewed, and he stayed on (though at a reduced salary) until 1941.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=681}}\n\nAlready prepared to enter [[World War II]] with an enlistment in the [[British Army]], Thompson finally secured an appointment at the [[University of Swansea]], having learned of an opening for somebody who could teach [[Greek language|Greek]] from his friend [[Benjamin Farrington]].{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=681}}\n\nFrom Swansea, Thompson transferred to [[King's College, London]], teaching as a classics lecturer from 1945 to 1948. It was during this time that Thompson's first books, ''[[Ammianus Marcellinus]]'' (1947), and ''A History of Attila and the Huns'' (1948). Both were later reprinted and have retained their influence up to the present day.{{sfn|Todd|2004}}{{sfn|The Times. 2 February 1994}}\n\n==Career at the University of Nottingham==\nThompson moved once more in 1948{{spaced ndash}}this time to direct the classics department at the [[University of Nottingham]], where Thompson worked from 1948 to 1979.{{sfn|Markus|1994}}{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}} During this time, Thompson contributed immensely to the increasing quality of studies of Late Antiquity in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=684}} He was considered the leading scholar of the United Kingdom in this field.{{sfn|The Times. 2 February 1994}}{{sfn|Markus|1996}} He focused primarily on scholarship rather than administrative duties.{{sfn|Todd|2004}}\n\nBy the early 1950s, Thompson's research was increasingly focused on the early Germanic peoples. At this time, very little research had been carried out in this field in the English-speaking world. Unlike future generations of scholars in this field, Thompson carried out his studies without ideological bias.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=686}} Nevertheless, his revulsion towards Nazism, and his sympathy towards [[Marxism]], particularly the theories of [[Friedrich Engels]], are detectable in his research of this important field. His works were pioneering in the field of Germanic studies,{{sfn|Todd|2004}} in which he was the leading scholar of his generation.{{sfn|The Guardian. 31 January 1994}} He helped detach the field from the ideological bias which had characterized it in the past.{{sfn|The Guardian. 31 January 1994}} Thompson published his work ''The Early Germans'' in 1965, which was largely concerned with the changing structure of Germanic society in ancient times.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=687}} His works on early Germanic peoples, such as the [[Visigoths]], quickly became standard reference works on the subject, and were still considered unsurpassed at the time of his death.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=692}} Thompson's use of primary sources to examine the past, and his attempts to establish clarity in the field, have come under criticism from some scholars, who are heavily influenced by [[critical theory]] and consider primary sources unreliable.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=692}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = Edward Thompson... was the leading scholar of his generation on the history of the Germanic migrations... His academic achievement was to apply modern historical analysis to the study of the Germanic tribes, escaping the influence of 19th-century romantic myths...{{sfn|The Guardian. 31 January 1994}}\n |author = \u2014 [[The Guardian]]\n |source =\n |align =\n |width = 20%\n}}\n \nUntil his retirement in 1979, Thompson served as the first Chairman of the Editorial Board of the scholarly journal ''Nottingham Medieval Studies'', founded by [[Lewis Thorpe]] in 1957.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=683}}\n\nThompson was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1964{{spaced ndash}}the first University of Nottingham academic to be so honoured.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=683}}\n\n==Later life==\nThompson retired from the University of Nottingham in 1979. He died in Nottingham on 1 January 1994.{{sfn|The Times. 2 February 1994}}\n\n==Politics==\nThompson's revulsion towards Nazism, and his rejection of the strict Presbyterianism of his family, made him receptive towards Marxist ideology, which was popular among intellectuals in the 1930s. He was particularly impressed by the works of [[Friedrich Engels]]. Influenced by Benjamin Farrington, Thompson joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] by 1941.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}} The influence of Marxism is easily detected in Thompson's works on a wide variety of subjects.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=686}}\n\nThompson left the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1956, the year of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet Union's intervention in Hungary]]. In later life he belonged to the [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] and referred to himself as a Thompsonist rather than a Marxist. His academic work continued to demonstrate a Marxist-oriented outlook on history. No longer active in political life, he continued his enthusiastic interest for politics.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}} He was strongly opposed to the Soviet handling of the [[Prague Spring]], and criticised British policy in [[Northern Ireland]], deploring the secterian violence being carried out there.{{sfn|Todd|2004}} His interest in the class structure of societies, and in their material basis, continued to direct the structure of his studies.{{sfn|Markus|1994}}\n\n==Personal life==\nIt was while lecturing at King's College that Thompson met his first wife Thelma Marjorie Phelps, a physician, whom he married in 1945.{{sfn|Todd|2004}} They had a son and a daughter, but separated in 1958. In 1964 he married Hazel Joyce Casken, with whom he had a daughter and lived happily until his death.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}}{{sfn|Todd|2004}}\n\n==Works==\n* ''Ammianus Marcellinus'' (London: Cambridge University Press, 1947)\n* ''A History of Attila and the Huns'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1948)\n* ''Roman Reformer and Inventor: New Text of De Rebus Bellicis'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1952)\n* ''The Early Germans'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1965)\n* ''The Visigoths in the Time of Ulfila'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1966)\n* ''The Goths in Spain'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1969)\n* ''The Conversion of the Spanish Suevi to Catholicism'' (in (ed.)

For designing in [[Vernacular architecture|traditional]] styles, he is also a representative of [[New Classical Architecture]].\n\n== Life ==\n\n=== Education ===\n\nEl-Wakil's early education in [[Egypt]] was at the British schools of [[Victoria College, Alexandria|Victoria College]] and the English School. In 1960, he obtained his GCE and graduated with a distinction in Applied [[Mathematics]], [[Art]], [[Physics]], and [[Chemistry]]. In the same year, he joined the Faculty of Engineering at [[Ain Shams University]] and in 1965 acquired his [[BSc]] in Architecture with Distinction and First Honours Degree. It was while studying for his degree that El-Wakil became acquainted with the writings of English critic [[John Ruskin]]. Ruskin's descriptions of what he termed an \"arborescent\" quality in architecture (where a bold structure of decoration, legible at a distance, reveals ever-finer sub-structures as you approach it) had a lasting effect upon him.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1970, he was appointed as instructor and lecturer at the [[Architecture]] Department of his Faculty.\n\nIn 1967, El-Wakil's whole approach to architecture was altered when he met with his mentor professor [[Hassan Fathy]].  Having previously built three apartment buildings in the idioms of his former education in modern style architecture, El-Wakil decided to become an apprentice to Hassan Fathy. As with [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], Hassan Fathy's mention was taboo at the Ain Shams Department of Architecture and that forced El-Wakil to end his teaching post at the Faculty and begin his new education with his mentor.\n\n=== Career ===\n[[Hassan Fathy]]\u2019s quest for indigenous architecture had taken momentum from the post-war crisis of [[World War II]]. The war caused an economic shortage in industrial construction materials. It then occurred to Hassan Fathy that the [[Nubia]]ns of [[Upper Egypt]] managed to build the most beautiful houses with [[mud]] - the humble material below their feet.\n\nAfter five years of working with Hassan Fathy, El-Wakil had the opportunity to design and build a house by the beach of [[Agamy]] near [[Alexandria]]. The socialist regime of [[Nasser]] and the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 had brought Egypt into an economic disaster and again modern building materials became scarce and expensive. It was a unique opportunity for El-Wakil to interpret Hassan Fathy's design philosophy of [[architecture for the poor]]. The [[Halawa house]] at Agamy made use of the abundant limestone within the area introducing the first indigenous Egyptian architecture in a resort that began with a pseudo [[French Riviera]] style and finished with pseudo Modern.\n\nEl-Wakil built two more houses in Egypt. The [[Hamdy House]], and the [[Chourbagy house]], both by the [[Pyramid]]s Road at the outskirts of Cairo.\n\nThe Hamdy house was conceived as a small week-end house with a sleeping loft. The design encapsulated in an embryonic form the main elements in traditional [[Arab]] houses.\n\nThe Chourbagy House was conceived as a model for a typical townhouse on a narrow frontage plot. The house made extensive use of traditional design elements and local craftsmanship.\n\n== Saudi Arabian career ==\n\nWith the [[oil]] boom in 1973, [[Saudi Arabia]] provided a majority of commissions for El-Wakil. He undertook the design of a number of grand mansions developing a design approach of internalised spaces of atriums, patios and courtyards, which appeared unfamiliar to the prevailing trend of extrovert [[villa]] type houses.\n\nThe first in this series of houses was the [[Zahran mansion]], as a precursor to the [[Suleiman palace]] in [[Jeddah]]. The Suleiman palace became a unique expression of contemporary architecture applying traditional Arab design concepts. In a survey of architecture in Saudi Arabia, the ''[[AIA Journal]]'' nominated it as one of the best designs accomplished.\n\nTwo more houses were built in Saudi Arabia; the [[Alireza mansion]] in [[Riyadh]] and the [[Kandiel house]] in Jeddah, both in load-bearing brick construction.\n\nAnother three interesting house designs in Saudi Arabia, that failed to get built, were the Mansur Badr residence in Riyadh, the Mansur Badr town house in [[Makkah]], and the Hossam Khashoggi residence in [[Taif]].\n\n=== Other works ===\n\nBeyond Saudi Arabia El-Wakil designed a contemporary Arab courtyard town house for [[Farouk Sultan]] in Kuwait. The [[University of Durham]] in UK taught the design of the Farouk Sultan house as an example of environmental design.\n\nAnother small house was designed on the [[Island of Hydra]] in Greece. In his book \u2018A Vision of Britain\u2019, The [[Prince of Wales]] presented it as an example for his ideas on traditional architecture.\n\nLater, in 1993, El-Wakil designed a mansion for [[Thomas Kramer]] in [[Miami]], Florida. [[Vincent Scully]], in his book \u2018Between the Two Towers\u2019 gave it generous mention.\n\nBy the time the Suleiman mansion had been completed, El-Wakil's work had caught the attention of [[Sheikh Said Farsi]], the mayor of [[Jeddah]], who appointed him as advisor.\n\n== Mosques works ==\n[[File:Quba_Mosque_-_panoramio.jpg|thumb|The [[Quba Mosque]] in [[Medina|Medina, Saudi Arabia]]]]\nIn collaboration with the Ministry of [[Pilgrimage]] and Endowment, a program for [[Mosque]] Architecture was established for the reconstitution of traditional architecture, for the first time enabling the construction of compressive brick structures devoid of concrete.\n\nWith support from Mayor Said Farsi and Deputy Minister [[Hossam Khashoggi]], El-Wakil now proceeded to achieve an opus of over fifteen mosques within a period of ten years. Designing single handed, he managed to delve into the evolution of the finest detail, to develop innovative building techniques, and simultaneously to achieve minarets, and vaulted and domed structures, of great daring.\n\nFour little mosques; the Island mosque, the [[Corniche mosque]], the [[Ruwais mosque]] and the [[Abraj Mosque]] were commissioned as part of the beautification of New Jeddah.\n\nFive other grand mosques were commissioned in Jeddah; the Suleiman mosque, the Harithy mosque, the Azizeyah mosque, the Jufalli mosque and the monumental [[King Saud Mosque]]. They were all in brick construction and provided an opportunity to develop traditional building crafts. The brick dome of the King Saud mosque with a diameter of 20 meters and a peak height of 40 meters<ref>[http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=771 Description] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112120157/http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=771 |date=2012-01-12 }} of the King Saud mosque at Archnet.com with plans and pictures.</ref> challenged structural engineers who refused liability for its construction without concrete. El-Wakil signed an affidavit taking full responsibility for its structure. Being directly commissioned by King Fahd and promoted by the mayor of Jeddah, El-Wakil managed to circumvent all the bureaucratic regulations that would have prevented the mosque ever being built.\n\nFour Pilgrimage mosques of great historic significance were commissioned in [[Medina]] ( Al\u2013Madinah Al-Munawarah - the Holy city of the Prophet):\n\n*The design and reconstruction of the [[Quba Mosque]] built on the site where the very first mosque in Islam was erected.\n*The design and reconstruction of the [[Masjid al-Qiblatain|Qiblatain Mosque]] said to have been the mosque where the worshipers first changed the direction of their prayers from Jerusalem towards Mecca according to divine revelation.\n*The design and reconstruction of the [[Jama Masjid]], the congregation mosque,  said to have been the mosque where the first Friday prayers in Islam were performed.\n*The [[Miqaat Al-Madinah Mosque]] Complex designed for pilgrims to perform their purification rites and prayers before entering the Holy city of Madinah.\n[[File:Masjid al-Qiblatain.jpg|thumb|The [[Masjid al-Qiblatayn|Qiblatayn Mosque]] in [[Medina|Medina, Saudi Arabia]]]]\n\nTwo mosques were later designed in Riyadh and one in Diraiyah on the outskirts of Riyadh. The Maydani Mosque in Riyadh was the only one built.\n\nAnother two mosques were designed for the city of [[Makkah]]:\n\n*The Bilal Mosque, unfortunately never built, was named after the muezzin who announced the call to prayer for the Prophet Muhammad. The earlier mosque had been unfortunately demolished with the new expansions of the Haram.\n*The Hafayer mosque in proximity to the Haram has just recently been completed for prayers in the month of Ramadan 2008.\n\n=== Mosques outside Saudi Arabia ===\n\nSeveral mosques were designed outside Saudi Arabia:\n\n*The [[Kerk Street Mosque|Kerk Street mosque]] built in downtown [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], replaced the 150-year-old mosque to accommodate a larger number of worshipers. The restricted site imposed five prayer levels and an unsparingly efficient utilisation of space.\n*The Yateem Mosque in [[Bahrain]] designed on a challenging narrow plot. The minaret is unique as it incorporates a custom designed clock.\n*The Houghton Mosque and community centre on the outskirts of Johannesburg, South Africa.\n*The [[Ash-Shaliheen Mosque]], a mosque in [[Brunei]] designed to consider the traditional spatial character of [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] architecture.\n*A Muslim Community Centre in [[Miami]]: the design of which went no further than its conceptual stage.\n\nTaken as a body of work, the mosques of El-Wakil can now be seen to show great leaps of the imagination, while invariably being rooted in tradition. Not only are the fine ornamental details remarkable, the vast variety of columns and stalactites, pendentives and multiple other elements all created without repetition. The structural forms, such as the triangular minaret at Miqat in Madinah, grow organically from functional and programmatic exigencies.\n\n=== Other Buildings ===\n\nApart from mosques and houses, El-Wakil has designed and built a variety of building types:\n\n*An early project in Jeddah was the design of a [[car showroom]] and [[office]]s, a pioneer example of the integration of Saudi Arabian elements with conventional concrete structure.\n*A later project was The Souk Al-Dawoodiah at Al-Madinah Al-Munawarah; consisting of a [[shopping mall]] and office building, this also was a commercial building utilising traditional forms.\n*A [[Lighthouse]] by the coast in Jeddah, inspired by medieval Islamic towers, was of interesting design although never built.\n*Two Public buildings designed but not built were the Ministry of Pilgrimage and Endowment Head office in Jeddah and the offices of Public Waterworks.\n\n== International works ==\n\nIn 1991, the crisis of the [[Gulf War]] forced the closure of El-Wakil's offices in the UK. Being aware of the situation, [[Andr\u00e9s Duany]] invited El-Wakil to come to Miami as visiting Professor at the [[University of Miami]]. El-Wakil also joined a charette organised by Duany for the development of South Beach. The developer Thomas Kramer, impressed by El-Wakil, asked him to design his new residence on Star Island. Duany presented El-Wakil with several consultancy opportunities of which The Kemer County Development offered him the opportunity to experiment with Traditional Turkish Architecture in the Design of the Country Club. El-Wakil kept a base in Miami until the tragic events of 911.\n\nEl-Wakil has been championed by [[The Prince of Wales]] who shares his approach to architecture. The Prince selected him among his advisors for the Prince of Wales School of Architecture, and as Patron to the [[Oxford]] Centre for Islamic Studies; the Prince commended him for the design of the centre's building. El-Wakil cherishes this recognition as he personally believes Prince Charles to be the true patron of Tradition.\n\nThe [[Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies]] (OXCIS) went through a long and sometimes painful process but has recently neared completion. The building blended the tradition of Oxford architecture with the spirit of Traditional Islamic Architecture. The medieval character of both architectures made it a happy marriage. The building reintroduced load bearing brick structures, eliminating steel and concrete.\n\nThe almost-completed centre appeared on the front cover of the UK [[Financial Times]] Magazine March 10/11 2007.\n\n== Awards ==\nEl-Wakil has received recognition for his contribution to traditional architecture and sustainable building technology for the third world, addressing at an early date the now more widely understood issues of sustainability.\n\n*In 1980, The [[Agamy Beach house]] claimed the first [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]]. El-Wakil shared the award with his mason Ala-el-Din Moustafa who was one of the master masons to build Hassan Fathy's village in Gourna.\n*In 1985, he received the [[King Fahd]] Award for Research in Islamic Architecture.\n*In 1986, El-Wakil's work was recognized by the [[American Institute of Architects]] and was made Honorary Fellow at San Antonio in [[Texas]].\n*In 1987, on the occasion of The International Year of [[Shelter for the Homeless]] (IYSH), a competition was organised for New Technological Solutions for [[Public housing|Social Housing]] (CINTUS). Out of entries from 75 nations, El-Wakil's design won him an award.\n*In 1988, El-Wakil was accorded the title of Professor by the [[International Academy of Architecture]] and the [[International Union of Architects]].\n*In 1989, El-Wakil acquired a second Aga Khan Award for the design of the Corniche Mosque in Jeddah. The Award Ceremony was held in Cairo, El-Wakil's home town and was presented to him by the First Lady [[Suzanne Mubarak]].\n*In 1993, El-Wakil received a Certificate of Appreciation from Dade County in Miami for his entry, within a charette of 20 architectural firms organised by Andres Duany, for the urban design development for [[South Beach]], [[Miami]].\n*In 1994, El-Wakil received an Award and Trophy for his achievements within the city Al-Madinah Munawarah, an achievement unique for a non-Saudi.\n*In 1994 El-Wakil also received a Certificate of Appreciation from [[Solidere]] in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] for his contribution as president of the jury for the reconstruction of the Souks of Beirut.\n*In 1999 El-Wakil was honoured in Riyadh at the International Congress for [[Mosque Architecture]] with the First Prize for the Design of the Contemporary Mosque Architecture.\n*In 2008, El-Wakil was named the 2009 winner of the [[Richard Driehaus|Richard H. Driehaus]] Prize for his contributions to classical architecture.\n\n== Memberships ==\n\nEl-Wakil has also participated as a member of several juries on architecture and advisor to several institutions.

For designing in [[Vernacular architecture|traditional]] styles, he is also a representative of [[New Classical Architecture]].\n\n== Life ==\n\n=== Education ===\n\nEl-Wakil's early education in [[Egypt]] was at the British schools of [[Victoria College, Alexandria|Victoria College]] and the English School. In 1960, he obtained his GCE and graduated with a distinction in Applied [[Mathematics]], [[Art]], [[Physics]], and [[Chemistry]]. In the same year, he joined the Faculty of Engineering at [[Ain Shams University]] and in 1965 acquired his [[BSc]] in Architecture with Distinction and First Honours Degree. It was while studying for his degree that El-Wakil became acquainted with the writings of English critic [[John Ruskin]]. Ruskin's descriptions of what he termed an \"arborescent\" quality in architecture (where a bold structure of decoration, legible at a distance, reveals ever-finer sub-structures as you approach it) had a lasting effect upon him.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1970, he was appointed as instructor and lecturer at the [[Architecture]] Department of his Faculty.\n\nIn 1967, El-Wakil's whole approach to architecture was altered when he met with his mentor professor [[Hassan Fathy]].  Having previously built three apartment buildings in the idioms of his former education in modern style architecture, El-Wakil decided to become an apprentice to Hassan Fathy. As with [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], Hassan Fathy's mention was taboo at the Ain Shams Department of Architecture and that forced El-Wakil to end his teaching post at the Faculty and begin his new education with his mentor.\n\n=== Career ===\n[[Hassan Fathy]]\u2019s quest for indigenous architecture had taken momentum from the post-war crisis of [[World War II]]. The war caused an economic shortage in industrial construction materials. It then occurred to Hassan Fathy that the [[Nubia]]ns of [[Upper Egypt]] managed to build the most beautiful houses with [[mud]] - the humble material below their feet.\n\nAfter five years of working with Hassan Fathy, El-Wakil had the opportunity to design and build a house by the beach of [[Agamy]] near [[Alexandria]]. The socialist regime of [[Nasser]] and the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 had brought Egypt into an economic disaster and again modern building materials became scarce and expensive. It was a unique opportunity for El-Wakil to interpret Hassan Fathy's design philosophy of [[architecture for the poor]]. The [[Halawa house]] at Agamy made use of the abundant limestone within the area introducing the first indigenous Egyptian architecture in a resort that began with a pseudo [[French Riviera]] style and finished with pseudo Modern.\n\nEl-Wakil built two more houses in Egypt. The [[Hamdy House]], and the [[Chourbagy house]], both by the [[Pyramid]]s Road at the outskirts of Cairo.\n\nThe Hamdy house was conceived as a small week-end house with a sleeping loft. The design encapsulated in an embryonic form the main elements in traditional [[Arab]] houses.\n\nThe Chourbagy House was conceived as a model for a typical townhouse on a narrow frontage plot. The house made extensive use of traditional design elements and local craftsmanship.\n\n== Saudi Arabian career ==\n\nWith the [[oil]] boom in 1973, [[Saudi Arabia]] provided a majority of commissions for El-Wakil. He undertook the design of a number of grand mansions developing a design approach of internalised spaces of atriums, patios and courtyards, which appeared unfamiliar to the prevailing trend of extrovert [[villa]] type houses.\n\nThe first in this series of houses was the [[Zahran mansion]], as a precursor to the [[Suleiman palace]] in [[Jeddah]]. The Suleiman palace became a unique expression of contemporary architecture applying traditional Arab design concepts. In a survey of architecture in Saudi Arabia, the ''[[AIA Journal]]'' nominated it as one of the best designs accomplished.\n\nTwo more houses were built in Saudi Arabia; the [[Alireza mansion]] in [[Riyadh]] and the [[Kandiel house]] in Jeddah, both in load-bearing brick construction.\n\nAnother three interesting house designs in Saudi Arabia, that failed to get built, were the Mansur Badr residence in Riyadh, the Mansur Badr town house in [[Makkah]], and the Hossam Khashoggi residence in [[Taif]].\n\n=== Other works ===\n\nBeyond Saudi Arabia El-Wakil designed a contemporary Arab courtyard town house for [[Farouk Sultan]] in Kuwait. The [[University of Durham]] in UK taught the design of the Farouk Sultan house as an example of environmental design.\n\nAnother small house was designed on the [[Island of Hydra]] in Greece. In his book \u2018A Vision of Britain\u2019, The [[Prince of Wales]] presented it as an example for his ideas on traditional architecture.\n\nLater, in 1993, El-Wakil designed a mansion for [[Thomas Kramer]] in [[Miami]], Florida. [[Vincent Scully]], in his book \u2018Between the Two Towers\u2019 gave it generous mention.\n\nBy the time the Suleiman mansion had been completed, El-Wakil's work had caught the attention of [[Sheikh Said Farsi]], the mayor of [[Jeddah]], who appointed him as advisor.\n\n== Mosques works ==\n[[File:Quba_Mosque_-_panoramio.jpg|thumb|The Quba Mosque in Medinah]]\nIn collaboration with the Ministry of [[Pilgrimage]] and Endowment, a program for [[Mosque]] Architecture was established for the reconstitution of traditional architecture, for the first time enabling the construction of compressive brick structures devoid of concrete.\n\nWith support from Mayor Said Farsi and Deputy Minister [[Hossam Khashoggi]], El-Wakil now proceeded to achieve an opus of over fifteen mosques within a period of ten years. Designing single handed, he managed to delve into the evolution of the finest detail, to develop innovative building techniques, and simultaneously to achieve minarets, and vaulted and domed structures, of great daring.\n\nFour little mosques; the Island mosque, the [[Corniche mosque]], the [[Ruwais mosque]] and the [[Abraj Mosque]] were commissioned as part of the beautification of New Jeddah.\n\nFive other grand mosques were commissioned in Jeddah; the Suleiman mosque, the Harithy mosque, the Azizeyah mosque, the Jufalli mosque and the monumental [[King Saud Mosque]]. They were all in brick construction and provided an opportunity to develop traditional building crafts. The brick dome of the King Saud mosque with a diameter of 20 meters and a peak height of 40 meters<ref>[http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=771 Description] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112120157/http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=771 |date=2012-01-12 }} of the King Saud mosque at Archnet.com with plans and pictures.</ref> challenged structural engineers who refused liability for its construction without concrete. El-Wakil signed an affidavit taking full responsibility for its structure. Being directly commissioned by King Fahd and promoted by the mayor of Jeddah, El-Wakil managed to circumvent all the bureaucratic regulations that would have prevented the mosque ever being built.\n\nFour Pilgrimage mosques of great historic significance were commissioned in [[Medina]] ( Al\u2013Madinah Al-Munawarah - the Holy city of the Prophet):\n\n*The design and reconstruction of the [[Quba Mosque]] built on the site where the very first mosque in Islam was erected.\n*The design and reconstruction of the [[Masjid al-Qiblatain|Qiblatain Mosque]] said to have been the mosque where the worshipers first changed the direction of their prayers from Jerusalem towards Mecca according to divine revelation.\n*The design and reconstruction of the [[Jama Masjid]], the congregation mosque,  said to have been the mosque where the first Friday prayers in Islam were performed.\n*The [[Miqaat Al-Madinah Mosque]] Complex designed for pilgrims to perform their purification rites and prayers before entering the Holy city of Madinah.\n[[File:Masjid al-Qiblatain.jpg|thumb|The Qiblatain Mosque in Medinah]]\n\nTwo mosques were later designed in Riyadh and one in Diraiyah on the outskirts of Riyadh. The Maydani Mosque in Riyadh was the only one built.\n\nAnother two mosques were designed for the city of [[Makkah]]:\n\n*The Bilal Mosque, unfortunately never built, was named after the muezzin who announced the call to prayer for the Prophet Muhammad. The earlier mosque had been unfortunately demolished with the new expansions of the Haram.\n*The Hafayer mosque in proximity to the Haram has just recently been completed for prayers in the month of Ramadan 2008.\n\n=== Mosques outside Saudi Arabia ===\n\nSeveral mosques were designed outside Saudi Arabia:\n\n*The [[Kerk Street Mosque|Kerk Street mosque]] built in downtown [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], replaced the 150-year-old mosque to accommodate a larger number of worshipers. The restricted site imposed five prayer levels and an unsparingly efficient utilisation of space.\n*The Yateem Mosque in [[Bahrain]] designed on a challenging narrow plot. The minaret is unique as it incorporates a custom designed clock.\n*The Houghton Mosque and community centre on the outskirts of Johannesburg, South Africa.\n*The [[Ash-Shaliheen Mosque]], a mosque in [[Brunei]] designed to consider the traditional spatial character of [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] architecture.\n*A Muslim Community Centre in [[Miami]]: the design of which went no further than its conceptual stage.\n\nTaken as a body of work, the mosques of El-Wakil can now be seen to show great leaps of the imagination, while invariably being rooted in tradition. Not only are the fine ornamental details remarkable, the vast variety of columns and stalactites, pendentives and multiple other elements all created without repetition. The structural forms, such as the triangular minaret at Miqat in Madinah, grow organically from functional and programmatic exigencies.\n\n=== Other Buildings ===\n\nApart from mosques and houses, El-Wakil has designed and built a variety of building types:\n\n*An early project in Jeddah was the design of a [[car showroom]] and [[office]]s, a pioneer example of the integration of Saudi Arabian elements with conventional concrete structure.\n*A later project was The Souk Al-Dawoodiah at Al-Madinah Al-Munawarah; consisting of a [[shopping mall]] and office building, this also was a commercial building utilising traditional forms.\n*A [[Lighthouse]] by the coast in Jeddah, inspired by medieval Islamic towers, was of interesting design although never built.\n*Two Public buildings designed but not built were the Ministry of Pilgrimage and Endowment Head office in Jeddah and the offices of Public Waterworks.\n\n== International works ==\n\nIn 1991, the crisis of the [[Gulf War]] forced the closure of El-Wakil's offices in the UK. Being aware of the situation, [[Andr\u00e9s Duany]] invited El-Wakil to come to Miami as visiting Professor at the [[University of Miami]]. El-Wakil also joined a charette organised by Duany for the development of South Beach. The developer Thomas Kramer, impressed by El-Wakil, asked him to design his new residence on Star Island. Duany presented El-Wakil with several consultancy opportunities of which The Kemer County Development offered him the opportunity to experiment with Traditional Turkish Architecture in the Design of the Country Club. El-Wakil kept a base in Miami until the tragic events of 911.\n\nEl-Wakil has been championed by [[The Prince of Wales]] who shares his approach to architecture. The Prince selected him among his advisors for the Prince of Wales School of Architecture, and as Patron to the [[Oxford]] Centre for Islamic Studies; the Prince commended him for the design of the centre's building. El-Wakil cherishes this recognition as he personally believes Prince Charles to be the true patron of Tradition.\n\nThe [[Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies]] (OXCIS) went through a long and sometimes painful process but has recently neared completion. The building blended the tradition of Oxford architecture with the spirit of Traditional Islamic Architecture. The medieval character of both architectures made it a happy marriage. The building reintroduced load bearing brick structures, eliminating steel and concrete.\n\nThe almost-completed centre appeared on the front cover of the UK [[Financial Times]] Magazine March 10/11 2007.\n\n== Awards ==\nEl-Wakil has received recognition for his contribution to traditional architecture and sustainable building technology for the third world, addressing at an early date the now more widely understood issues of sustainability.\n\n*In 1980, The [[Agamy Beach house]] claimed the first [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]]. El-Wakil shared the award with his mason Ala-el-Din Moustafa who was one of the master masons to build Hassan Fathy's village in Gourna.\n*In 1985, he received the [[King Fahd]] Award for Research in Islamic Architecture.\n*In 1986, El-Wakil's work was recognized by the [[American Institute of Architects]] and was made Honorary Fellow at San Antonio in [[Texas]].\n*In 1987, on the occasion of The International Year of [[Shelter for the Homeless]] (IYSH), a competition was organised for New Technological Solutions for [[Public housing|Social Housing]] (CINTUS). Out of entries from 75 nations, El-Wakil's design won him an award.\n*In 1988, El-Wakil was accorded the title of Professor by the [[International Academy of Architecture]] and the [[International Union of Architects]].\n*In 1989, El-Wakil acquired a second Aga Khan Award for the design of the Corniche Mosque in Jeddah. The Award Ceremony was held in Cairo, El-Wakil's home town and was presented to him by the First Lady [[Suzanne Mubarak]].\n*In 1993, El-Wakil received a Certificate of Appreciation from Dade County in Miami for his entry, within a charette of 20 architectural firms organised by Andres Duany, for the urban design development for [[South Beach]], [[Miami]].\n*In 1994, El-Wakil received an Award and Trophy for his achievements within the city Al-Madinah Munawarah, an achievement unique for a non-Saudi.\n*In 1994 El-Wakil also received a Certificate of Appreciation from [[Solidere]] in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] for his contribution as president of the jury for the reconstruction of the Souks of Beirut.\n*In 1999 El-Wakil was honoured in Riyadh at the International Congress for [[Mosque Architecture]] with the First Prize for the Design of the Contemporary Mosque Architecture.\n*In 2008, El-Wakil was named the 2009 winner of the [[Richard Driehaus|Richard H. Driehaus]] Prize for his contributions to classical architecture.\n\n== Memberships ==\n\nEl-Wakil has also participated as a member of several juries on architecture and advisor to several institutions. He has been:\n\n*A Member of the Board of Trustees of the International Heritage Trust (founded by Lord Duncan Sands);\n*A Member of the Academic Board of the Prince of Wales school of Architecture;\n*Advisor to Astronaut Prince [[Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]] High Commissioner of Tourism and of Saudi Heritage Trust;\n*President of the Jury for the reconstruction of the Old Souks of Beirut;\n*A member of the Jury and Think tank for the Aga Khan Prize for architecture;\n*Advisor to [[UNESCO]] for the development of a village to relocate the Bdul tribe in [[Petra]], [[Jordan]];\n*A member of the King Fahd award for the International Youth of the World Competition for Islamic Architecture;\n*A Member of the Jury for the competition of the urban development for [[Samarkhand]] historical centre;\n\nEl- Wakil has also participated in many International symposiums and lectures; in the US at [[Pratt Institute]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, the Rowlett Lectures at [[Texas A&M University]], and the [[University of Texas at Austin]].\n\n== Recent Activities ==\nEl Wakil continues in vigorous professional activity, dividing his time between Middle Eastern capitals.\n\nIn Beirut, Lebanon, he has designed three projects including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on a prominent downtown site within the Solidere master plan; a town house re-interpreting traditional Levantine architecture to accommodate  contemporary usage; and the Bank of Kuwait in the downtown Solidere district.\n\nIn [[Qatar]] he is undertaking the Master Planning of a city quarter, integrating best contemporary low-energy planning practice with climate-tempered Islamic built form.\n\nEl Wakil has recently designed a boutique hotel in [[El-Gouna]], [[Red Sea]], [[Egypt]], and a mixed-use residential quarter within the Solidere International project Cairo Eastown.\n\nHe is also doing small town houses, and a new mosque, in Riyadh.\n\nWith Prince Sultan, the Saudi [[astronaut]], he worked on developing and restoring a  the old Al-'Udhaibat traditional farm in the [[Wadi Hanifa]] in [[Diriyah]] on the western outskirts of Riyadh.<ref>[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199904/al-.udhaibat-building.on.the.past.htm Al-'Udhaibat, building on the past] at [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com Saudi Aramco World], July/August 1999, p32-45</ref> A book \u2018Back to Earth\u2019<ref>William Facey, ''Back to Earth: Adobe Building in Saudi Arabia'', 1997, {{ISBN|1-900404-13-3}}</ref> recorded the project.\n\nOn a recent visit with the President of [[Senegal]], El-Wakil was invited to develop experimental social housing in mud brick.\n\nHe has also been involved in the design development of a compressed-earth brick making machine in [[South Africa]] with the development of interlocking brick shapes.\n\nEl Wakil, empowered now with third generation CAD programmes, is very technologically savvy.

{"title_page": "Soft tissue injury", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=March 2018}}\nA '''soft tissue injury''' (STI) is the damage of [[muscles]], [[ligaments]] and [[tendons]] throughout the body. Common [[soft tissue]] injuries usually occur from a [[sprain]], [[strain (injury)|strain]], a one off blow resulting in a [[contusion]] or overuse of a particular part of the body. Soft tissue injuries can result in [[pain]], [[swelling (medical)|swelling]], [[bruising]] and loss of function.<ref>Lovering, 2008</ref>\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n=== Sprains ===\nA sprain is a type of acute injury which results from the stretching or tearing of a ligament. Depending on the severity of the sprain, the movement on the joint can be compromised since ligaments aid in the stability and support of joints. Sprains are commonly seen in vulnerable areas such as the wrists, knees and ankles. They can occur from movements such as falling on an outstretched hand or a twisting of the ankle or foot.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.health.vic.gov.au/.|title=Soft Tissue Injuries (Sprains and Strains)|last=|first=|date=|website=Victoria State Government|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe severity of a sprain can be classified:\n*'''Grade 1:''' Only some of the fibers in the ligament are torn, and the injured site is moderately painful and swollen. Function in the joint will be unaffected for the most part.\n*'''Grade 2:''' Many of the ligament fibers are torn, and pain and swelling is moderate. The functionality of the joint is compromised.\n*'''Grade 3:''' The soft tissue is completely torn, and functionality and strength on the joint is completely compromised. In most cases, surgery is needed to repair the damage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.orthoinfo.aaos.org/.|title=Sprains, Strains, and Other Soft Tissue Injuries|last=|first=|date=|website=American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n=== Strains ===\nA strain is a type of acute injury that occurs to the muscle or tendon. Similar to sprains, it can vary in severity, from a stretching of the muscle or tendon to a complete tear of the tendon from the muscle. Some of the most common places that strains occur are in the foot, back of the leg (hamstring), or back.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Bruising (contusion) ===\nA contusion is the discoloration of the skin, which results from underlying muscle fibers and connective tissue being crushed.This can happen in a variety of ways such as a direct blow to the skin, or a fall taken against a hard surface. The discoloration in the skin is present when blood begins to pool around the injury.\n\n=== Tendinitis ===\n[[Tendinitis]] is a type of overuse injury to the tendons, which demonstrates signs of inflammation of tendons around a joint. Tendinitis is the most common cause of shoulder pain and also leg pain . Tendinitis occurs when there is repetitive stress on the subacromial bursa, which causes the bones to make contact with the tendons and irritate them.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n=== Classifications ===\n==== Acute injuries ====\n[[File:Bruising.JPG|thumb|Bruising is a type of acute soft tissue injury]]\nAny type of injury that occurs to the body through sudden trauma, such as a fall, twist or blow to the body.

Common [[soft tissue]] injuries usually occur from a [[sprain]], [[strain (injury)|strain]], a one off blow resulting in a [[contusion]] or overuse of a particular part of the body. Soft tissue injuries can result in [[pain]], [[swelling (medical)|swelling]], [[bruising]] and loss of function.<ref>Lovering, 2008</ref>\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n=== Sprains ===\nA sprain is a type of acute injury which results from the stretching or tearing of a ligament. Depending on the severity of the sprain, the movement on the joint can be compromised since ligaments aid in the stability and support of joints. Sprains are commonly seen in vulnerable areas such as the wrists, knees and ankles. They can occur from movements such as falling on an outstretched hand or a twisting of the ankle or foot.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.health.vic.gov.au/.|title=Soft Tissue Injuries (Sprains and Strains)|last=|first=|date=|website=Victoria State Government|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe severity of a sprain can be classified:\n*'''Grade 1:''' Only some of the fibers in the ligament are torn, and the injured site is moderately painful and swollen. Function in the joint will be unaffected for the most part.\n*'''Grade 2:''' Many of the ligament fibers are torn, and pain and swelling is moderate. The functionality of the joint is compromised.\n*'''Grade 3:''' The soft tissue is completely torn, and functionality and strength on the joint is completely compromised. In most cases, surgery is needed to repair the damage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.orthoinfo.aaos.org/.|title=Sprains, Strains, and Other Soft Tissue Injuries|last=|first=|date=|website=American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n=== Strains ===\nA strain is a type of acute injury that occurs to the muscle or tendon. Similar to sprains, it can vary in severity, from a stretching of the muscle or tendon to a complete tear of the tendon from the muscle. Some of the most common places that strains occur are in the foot, back of the leg (hamstring), or back.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Bruising (contusion) ===\nA contusion is the discoloration of the skin, which results from underlying muscle fibers and connective tissue being crushed.This can happen in a variety of ways such as a direct blow to the skin, or a fall taken against a hard surface. The discoloration in the skin is present when blood begins to pool around the injury.\n\n=== Tendinitis ===\n[[Tendinitis]] is a type of overuse injury to the tendons, which demonstrates signs of inflammation of tendons around a joint. Tendinitis is the most common cause of shoulder pain and also leg pain . Tendinitis occurs when there is repetitive stress on the subacromial bursa, which causes the bones to make contact with the tendons and irritate them.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n=== Classifications ===\n==== Acute injuries ====\n[[File:Bruising.JPG|thumb|Bruising is a type of acute soft tissue injury]]\nAny type of injury that occurs to the body through sudden trauma, such as a fall, twist or blow to the body.
