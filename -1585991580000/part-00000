Over the years, it began to attract  participants from the neighboring colleges of West Bengal. In the last decade or so, the fest grew  in scale, attracting participants from all over India and as well as abroad. The 2019 edition of the fest received a footfall of over 80,000 people.\n\n==Activities==\nDuring the fest, students from IIT Kharagpur and from different colleges all over the country participate in a multitude of social and cultural activities.<ref>http://www.coolage.in/2012/11/05/nukkad-prelims-spring-fest-iit-kharagpur/</ref><ref>http://www.coolage.in/2012/11/08/how-blessed-are-we-an-inspirational-evening-for-iit-kharagpur/</ref> The ambit of the events encompasses various genres like Dance, Music, Dramatics, Photography, Literature, Quizzing, Food Fest and Fine Arts.<ref>http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/Spring-Fest-2014/2014/01/06/article1984530.ece</ref>\n\nTremendous participation and aggressive competition are seen in all the events, especially the flagship events of SF, namely  Nukkad, Shuffle, Wildfire, Rangmanch, Centrifuge, and Lake Side Dreams. The preliminary rounds of Nukkad, Shuffle and Wildfire happen nationwide. Every city that Spring Fest visits to conduct prelims, the whole atmosphere turns festive and the creative lot throng to the venue to see the show of talent.\n \t\nOther non-competition based events include Hard-Talk, which involves talks/conferences by eminent personalities from a variety of fields, a talk by motivational speakers and various workshops on Filmography, mocktail making, cupcake dressing etc. The number of these events is particularly large and serves to cater to the very large number of participants \u2014 both local as well as from other colleges all over the country.\n \nThe hub for major activities during the fest is called the Arena, which has the Informals and Perpz stage. The informals stage hosts various fun filled casual activities, for which the participants can win numerous prizes. The Perpz stage is an all day dance floor with a DJ, that attracts huge crowds. Apart from this the arena also has numerous food and corporate stalls.\n \n==Pro Nights==\nThe evenings are notable for the \"Pro-Nights\", more commonly known as Star-Nites \u2014 the biggest events in Spring Fest which usually involve live concerts by some of the most famous musicians and bands of national and international acclaim. All the Star Nites are free to attend for any student of the institute and all registered participants. The [[genre]]s of music are wide and varied and involve pop, rock and fusion bands. The venue for these events is the Tagore Open Air Theater (TOAT) and Jnan Ghosh Stadium which usually get packed to their full capacity during the Star-Nites, with crowds of up to 23,000 people. Famous Indian artists like [[Armaan Malik]], [[Sachin-Jigar]], [[Shalmali Kholgade]], [[Farhan Akhtar]], [[Amit Trivedi]], [[Salim-Sulaiman]], [[Pritam]], [[Kailash Kher]], [[KK (singer)|KK]], [[Papon (Assamese singer)|Papon]], [[S.

More than 13\n0 events from varied genres provide a platform for students where they can prove their mettle and caliber. With a myriad of fun and intellectually stimulating events, huge star nights every year and a versatile crowd profile, Spring Fest has gradually consolidated its position as the premier inter-collegiate fest. The fierce competitions, uninterrupted entertainment, breath-taking pro-shows, and something to suit everybody is what give SF its magnificence.\n \t\t \t\nThe fest conducts its '''Hitch Hike - Nation Wide Prelims''' held in 8 cities for events like Wildfire, the national level rock band competition;SF Idol, Solo Singing competition; Shuffle, the street dance competition;Shake a Leg, Solo Dance Competition; Two for a Tango, Duo Dance competition; and Nukkad, the street play competition.

These rounds were termed as the '''Eliminations''' round.\nMost of the socio-cultural activities are day events which involve dramatics, music, dance competitions, fine arts contests, quizzes, food fest, gaming and other literary events. Judges of the competitions are reputed and famous personalities from different fields and organisations. Centrifuge, the inter-collegiate dance event, is arguably the most keenly followed event of the fest.

According to the 1931 census, it contained 50,403 residents, including about 20,000 Muslims, 15,923 Jews, and about 14,000 Christians. In 1947, the population comprised 70,910 Arabs (41,000 Muslims and 29,910 Christians) and 74,230 Jews. The Christians belong mostly to the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] ([[Arab Orthodox]]). Haifa was designated as part of the Jewish state in the [[1947 UN Partition Plan]] that proposed dividing [[Mandate Palestine]] into two states.\nIn December 1947 the Jewish militant group [[Irgun]] hurled two bombs at a group of Arabs waiting for construction jobs outside the  Consolidated Refineries in Haifa, killing 6 and injuring 42. Rioting erupted in which 2,000 Arab employees killed 39 of their Jewish colleagues in what has become known as the [[Haifa Oil Refinery massacre]]. Jewish forces retaliated by raiding the Arab village of [[Balad al-Shaykh raid|Balad al-Shaykh]] on December 31, 1947. Control of Haifa was a critical objective in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], as it was the country's major industrial port.\n\nThe British in Haifa redeployed on April 21, 1948, withdrawing from most of the city while still maintaining control over the port facilities. The city [[Capture of Haifa in 1948|was captured]] on April 23, 1948 by the Carmeli Brigade of the [[Haganah]] who were ordered into action by Mordechai Maklef at 10:30&nbsp;am on 21 April following three months of unsuccessful attacks by Arab forces. Most of the [[Muslim]] population fled through the British-controlled port.  However, as many as 2,000 Christians and 1,300 Muslims were still living in the  city by June 1948. By the end of June the remaining British forces left Haifa.\n\nToday, Haifa has a population of about 266,300 people. Approximately 90% of the population consists of Israeli-Jews, predominantly those without religious classification and mostly immigrants from the former [[Soviet Union]] from mixed-marriage families of Jewish origin.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} According to the [[Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics]], [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli-Arabs]] constitute 9% of Haifa's population, the majority living in [[Wadi Nisnas]], Abbas and [[Halisa]] neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/statistical/arab_pop03e.pdf |title=The Arab Population of Israel 2003 |accessdate=2008-01-03 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201024709/http://www.cbs.gov.il/statistical/arab_pop03e.pdf |archive-date=2007-12-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of Haifa]]\n*[[Economy of Israel]]\n*[[Tourism in Israel]]\n\n==References==\n{{commons category}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{see also|Timeline of Haifa#Bibliography}}\n* {{Citation |publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publication-place = New York |title = The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publication-date = 1910 |oclc = 14782424 |edition=11th |chapterurl = https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabrit12chisrich#page/820/mode/2up |chapter = Haifa }}\n* {{Citation |publisher = [[ABC-CLIO]] |publication-place = Santa Barbara, USA |editor1 = Michael R.T.

According to the 1931 census, it contained 50,403 residents, including about 20,000 Muslims, 15,923 Jews, and about 14,000 Christians. In 1947, the population comprised 70,910 Arabs (41,000 Muslims and 29,910 Christians) and 74,230 Jews. The Christians belong mostly to the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] ([[Arab Orthodox]]). Haifa was designated as part of the Jewish state in the [[1947 UN Partition Plan]] that proposed dividing [[Mandate Palestine]] into two states.\nIn December 1947 the Jewish militant group [[Irgun]] hurled two bombs at a group of Arabs waiting for construction jobs outside the  Consolidated Refineries in Haifa, killing 6 and injuring 42. Rioting erupted in which 2,000 Arab employees killed 39 of their Jewish colleagues in what has become known as the [[Haifa Oil Refinery massacre]]. Jewish forces retaliated by raiding the Arab village of [[Balad al-Shaykh raid|Balad al-Shaykh]] on December 31, 1947. Control of Haifa was a critical objective in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], as it was the country's major industrial port.\n\nThe British in Haifa redeployed on April 21, 1948, withdrawing from most of the city while still maintaining control over the port facilities. The city [[Capture of Haifa in 1948|was captured]] on April 23, 1948 by the Carmeli Brigade of the [[Haganah]] who were ordered into action by Mordechai Maklef at 10:30&nbsp;am on 21 April following three months of unsuccessful attacks by Arab forces. Most of the [[Muslim]] population fled through the British-controlled port.  However, as many as 2,000 Christians and 1,300 Muslims were still living in the  city by June 1948. By the end of June the remaining British forces left Haifa.\n\nToday, Haifa has a population of about 266,300 people.

The winners of each week's semi-final were revealed at the beginning of the next week's episode.<ref>{{cite web|title=NEW ZEALAND'S GOT TALENT|url=http://www.eventopia.co/NZGT|publisher=Eventopia|accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nThree semi-finalists had also appeared in the semi-finals of the [[New Zealand's Got Talent (series 1)|first series]] of ''New Zealand's Got Talent'' in 2008: Andre Vegas and Company, Dogmatic (as Chelsea and Quest) and the All Star Cheerleaders (with a different line-up).\n\n=== Wildcard ===\n\nIn addition to the 30 semi-finalists, one wildcard entry was chosen by a public competition. The [[Head & Shoulders]] Above the Rest competition was open to any act who had previously auditioned. Acts uploaded a video to the Above the Rest website and were voted on by the public. The top five contestants then performed for the judges, who chose singing act Arihia and Tahu to join the line-up of semi-final 6.<ref>{{cite web|title=HEAD & SHOULDERS ABOVE THE REST

{"title_page": "Numerical methods in fluid mechanics", "text_new": "[[Fluid motion]] is governed by the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]], a set of coupled and nonlinear\npartial differential equations derived from the basic laws of conservation of [[mass]], [[momentum]]\nand [[energy]]. The unknowns are usually the [[flow velocity]], the [[pressure]] and [[density]]  and [[temperature]]. The [[analytical solution]] of this equation is impossible hence scientists resort to laboratory experiments in such situations. The answers delivered are, however, usually qualitatively different since dynamical and geometric similitude are difficult to enforce simultaneously between the lab experiment and the [[prototype]]. Furthermore, the design and construction of these experiments can be difficult (and costly), particularly for stratified rotating flows. [[Computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) is an additional tool in the arsenal of scientists. In its early days CFD was often controversial, as it involved additional approximation to the governing equations and raised additional (legitimate) issues. Nowadays CFD is an established discipline alongside theoretical and experimental methods. This position is in large part due to the exponential growth of computer power which has allowed us to tackle ever larger and more complex problems.\n\n==Discretization==\nThe central process in CFD is the process of [[discretization]], i.e. the process of taking differential equations with an infinite number of [[degrees of freedom]], and reducing it to a system of finite degrees of freedom. Hence, instead of determining the solution everywhere and for all times, we will be satisfied with its calculation at a finite number of locations and at specified time intervals. The [[partial differential equations]] are then reduced to a system of algebraic equations that can be solved on a computer. Errors creep in during the discretization process. The nature and characteristics of the errors must be controlled in order to ensure that:\n* we are solving the correct equations (consistency property)\n* that the error can be decreased as we increase the number of degrees of freedom (stability and convergence).\nOnce these two criteria are established, the power of computing machines can be leveraged to solve the problem in a numerically reliable fashion. Various discretization schemes have been developed to cope with a variety of issues. The most notable for our purposes are: [[finite difference methods]], finite volume methods, [[finite element methods]], and [[spectral methods]].\n\n==Finite difference method==\nFinite difference replace the infinitesimal limiting process of derivative calculation:\n:<math> \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to 0}f'(x) = \\frac {f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x} </math>\n\nwith a finite limiting process,i.e.\n\n:<math> f'(x) =\\frac {f(x+\\Delta x) - f(x)}{\\Delta x} + O(\\Delta x) </math>\n\nThe term <math>O(\\Delta x)</math> gives an indication of the magnitude of the error as a function of the mesh spacing. In this instance, the error is halved if the grid spacing, _x is halved, and we say that this is a first order method. Most FDM used in practice are at least second order accurate except in very special circumstances. Finite Difference method is still the most popular numerical method for solution of PDEs because of their simplicity, efficiency and low computational cost. Their major drawback is in their geometric inflexibility which complicates their applications to general complex domains. These can be alleviated by the use of either mapping techniques and/or masking to fit the computational mesh to the computational domain.\n\n==Finite element method==\nThe finite element method was designed to deal with problem with complicated computational regions. The PDE is first recast into a variational form which essentially forces the mean error to be small everywhere. The discretization step proceeds by dividing the computational domain into elements of triangular or rectangular shape. The solution within each element is interpolated with a polynomial of usually low order. Again, the unknowns are the solution at the collocation points. The CFD community adopted the FEM in the 1980s when reliable methods for dealing with advection dominated problems were devised.\n\n==Spectral method==\nBoth finite element and finite difference methods are low order methods, usually of 2nd&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;4th order, and have local approximation property. By local we mean that a particular collocation point is affected by a limited number of points around it. In contrast, spectral method have global approximation property. The interpolation functions, either polynomials or trigonomic functions are global in nature. Their main benefits is in the rate of convergence which depends on the smoothness of the solution (i.e. how many continuous derivatives does it admit). For infinitely smooth solution, the error decreases exponentially, i.e. faster than algebraic. Spectral methods are mostly used in the computations of homogeneous turbulence, and require relatively simple geometries. Atmospheric model have also adopted spectral methods because of their convergence properties and the regular spherical shape of their computational domain.\n\n==Finite volume method==\nFinite volume methods are primarily used in [[aerodynamics]] applications where strong shocks and discontinuities in the solution occur. Finite volume method solves an integral form of the governing equations so that local continuity property do not have to hold.\n\n==Computational cost==\nThe [[CPU]] time to solve the system of equations differs substantially from method to method. Finite differences are usually the cheapest on a per grid point basis followed by the finite element method and spectral method. However, a per grid point basis comparison is a little like comparing apple and oranges. Spectral methods deliver more accuracy on a per grid point basis than either [[Finite element method|FEM]] or [[Finite difference method|FDM]]. The comparison is more meaningful if the question is recast as \u201dwhat is the computational cost to achieve a given error tolerance?\u201d. The problem becomes one of defining the error measure which is a complicated task in general situations.\n\n==Forward Euler approximation==\n:<math> \\frac {u^{n+1} -u^n}{\\Delta t } \\approx \\kappa u^n </math>\n\nEquation is an explicit approximation to the original differential equation since no information about the unknown function at the future time (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)<sub>''t''</sub> has been used on the right hand side of the equation. In order to derive the error committed in the approximation we rely again on Taylor series.\n\n==Backward difference==\nThis is an example of an implicit method since the unknown ''u''(''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) has been used in evaluating the slope of the solution on the right hand side; this is not a problem to solve for ''u''(''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) in this scalar and linear case. For more complicated situations like a nonlinear right hand side or a system of equations, a nonlinear system of equations may have to be inverted.\n\n==References==\n\n# Zalesak, S. T., 2005.

The unknowns are usually the [[flow velocity]], the [[pressure]] and [[density]]  and [[temperature]]. The [[analytical solution]] of this equation is impossible hence scientists resort to laboratory experiments in such situations. The answers delivered are, however, usually qualitatively different since dynamical and geometric similitude are difficult to enforce simultaneously between the lab experiment and the [[prototype]]. Furthermore, the design and construction of these experiments can be difficult (and costly), particularly for stratified rotating flows. [[Computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) is an additional tool in the arsenal of scientists. In its early days CFD was often controversial, as it involved additional approximation to the governing equations and raised additional (legitimate) issues. Nowadays CFD is an established discipline alongside theoretical and experimental methods. This position is in large part due to the exponential growth of computer power which has allowed us to tackle ever larger and more complex problems.\n\n==Discretization==\nThe central process in CFD is the process of [[discretization]], i.e. the process of taking differential equations with an infinite number of [[degrees of freedom]], and reducing it to a system of finite degrees of freedom. Hence, instead of determining the solution everywhere and for all times, we will be satisfied with its calculation at a finite number of locations and at specified time intervals. The [[partial differential equations]] are then reduced to a system of algebraic equations that can be solved on a computer. Errors creep in during the discretization process. The nature and characteristics of the errors must be controlled in order to ensure that:\n* we are solving the correct equations (consistency property)\n* that the error can be decreased as we increase the number of degrees of freedom (stability and convergence).\nOnce these two criteria are established, the power of computing machines can be leveraged to solve the problem in a numerically reliable fashion. Various discretization schemes have been developed to cope with a variety of issues. The most notable for our purposes are: [[finite difference methods]], finite volume methods, [[finite element methods]], and [[spectral methods]].\n\n==Finite difference method==\nFinite difference replace the infinitesimal limiting process of derivative calculation:\n:<math> \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to 0}f'(x) = \\frac {f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x} </math>\n\nwith a finite limiting process,i.e.\n\n:<math> f'(x) =\\frac {f(x+\\Delta x) - f(x)}{\\Delta x} + O(\\Delta x) </math>\n\nThe term <math>O(\\Delta x)</math> gives an indication of the magnitude of the error as a function of the mesh spacing. In this instance, the error is halved if the grid spacing, _x is halved, and we say that this is a first order method. Most FDM used in practice are at least second order accurate except in very special circumstances. Finite Difference method is still the most popular numerical method for solution of PDEs because of their simplicity, efficiency and low computational cost. Their major drawback is in their geometric inflexibility which complicates their applications to general complex domains. These can be alleviated by the use of either mapping techniques and/or masking to fit the computational mesh to the computational domain.\n\n==Finite element method==\nThe finite element method was designed to deal with problem with complicated computational regions. The PDE is first recast into a variational form which essentially forces the mean error to be small everywhere. The discretization step proceeds by dividing the computational domain into elements of triangular or rectangular shape. The solution within each element is interpolated with a polynomial of usually low order. Again, the unknowns are the solution at the collocation points. The CFD community adopted the FEM in the 1980s when reliable methods for dealing with advection dominated problems were devised.\n\n==Spectral method==\nBoth finite element and finite difference methods are low order methods, usually of 2nd&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;4th order, and have local approximation property. By local we mean that a particular collocation point is affected by a limited number of points around it. In contrast, spectral method have global approximation property. The interpolation functions, either polynomials or trigonomic functions are global in nature. Their main benefits is in the rate of convergence which depends on the smoothness of the solution (i.e. how many continuous derivatives does it admit). For infinitely smooth solution, the error decreases exponentially, i.e. faster than algebraic. Spectral methods are mostly used in the computations of homogeneous turbulence, and require relatively simple geometries. Atmospheric model have also adopted spectral methods because of their convergence properties and the regular spherical shape of their computational domain.\n\n==Finite volume method==\nFinite volume methods are primarily used in [[aerodynamics]] applications where strong shocks and discontinuities in the solution occur. Finite volume method solves an integral form of the governing equations so that local continuity property do not have to hold.\n\n==Computational cost==\nThe [[CPU]] time to solve the system of equations differs substantially from method to method. Finite differences are usually the cheapest on a per grid point basis followed by the finite element method and spectral method. However, a per grid point basis comparison is a little like comparing apple and oranges. Spectral methods deliver more accuracy on a per grid point basis than either [[Finite element method|FEM]] or [[Finite difference method|FDM]]. The comparison is more meaningful if the question is recast as \u201dwhat is the computational cost to achieve a given error tolerance?\u201d. The problem becomes one of defining the error measure which is a complicated task in general situations.\n\n==Forward Euler approximation==\n:<math> \\frac {u^{n+1} -u^n}{\\Delta t } \\approx \\kappa u^n </math>\n\nEquation is an explicit approximation to the original differential equation since no information about the unknown function at the future time (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)<sub>''t''</sub> has been used on the right hand side of the equation. In order to derive the error committed in the approximation we rely again on Taylor series.\n\n==Backward difference==\nThis is an example of an implicit method since the unknown ''u''(''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) has been used in evaluating the slope of the solution on the right hand side; this is not a problem to solve for ''u''(''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) in this scalar and linear case. For more complicated situations like a nonlinear right hand side or a system of equations, a nonlinear system of equations may have to be inverted.\n\n==References==\n\n# Zalesak, S. T., 2005.

It is also known as '''Dharmakshetra''' (\"Holy Place\") and as the \"Land of the [[Bhagavad Gita]]\". The [[Kurukshetra War]] of the [[Mahabharata]] was found to have taken place there.\n\nAccording to the [[Puranas]], Kurukshetra is a region named after [[King Kuru]], the ancestor of Kauravas and Pandavas, as depicted in epic [[Mahabharata]]. The importance of the place is attributed to the fact that the [[Kurukshetra War]] of the [[Mahabharata]] is said to have taken place here. [[Thaneswar]] whose urban area is merged with Kurukshetra is a pilgrimage site with many locations attributed to Mahabharata.<ref>{{cite web | title = Kurukshetra (India)|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/325415/Kurukshetra | accessdate = 9 August 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn most ancient Hindu texts, Kurukshetra is not described as a city but a region (\"[[Tirtha (Hinduism)#Kshetra|kshetra]]\" means \"region\" in Sanskrit). The boundaries of Kurukshetra correspond roughly to the central and western parts of the state of Haryana and southern Punjab. According to the [[Taittiriya Aranyaka]] 5.1.1., the Kurukshetra region is south of Turghna (Srughna/Sugh in [[Sirhind]], Punjab), north of [[Khandava Forest|Khandava]] (Delhi and [[Mewat]] region), east of [[Thar Desert|Maru]] (desert), and west of Parin.<ref>[http://www.omilosmeleton.gr/english/documents/VedicEvidenceforAMT.pdf Agarwal, Vishal: Is There Vedic Evidence for the Indo-Aryan Immigration to India?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528001253/http://www.omilosmeleton.gr/english/documents/VedicEvidenceforAMT.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Kurukshetra War|label 1 = }}\n[[File:Kurukshetra.jpg|200px|thumb|left|A manuscript of [[Mahabharata]] depicting the war at Kurukshetra]]\nAccording to the [[Puranas]], ancient Hindu texts, the region is named after King [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]] of the [[Bharata (Mahabharata)#The Bharata race|Bharata]] dynasty, who is also the ancestor of Pandavas and Kauravas. These texts also tell that the battle of [[Mahabharata]] was fought on this land.\n\nAs the [[Vamana Purana]] describes, King Kuru chose land at the banks of [[Sarasvati River]] (dried up before 1900 BCE)<ref>''The Lost River'', by Michel Danino. Penguin India 2010</ref> for embedding spirituality with eight virtues:  austerity ([[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]]), truth ([[Satya]]), forgiveness (Kshama), kindness ([[Daya (Hinduism)|Daya]]), purity (Shuddha), charity ([[D\u0101na|Daana]]), devotion ([[Yajna]]), and conduct ([[Brahmacharya]]). Lord [[Vishnu]] was impressed with the acts of King Kuru and blessed him with two boons\u2014first, that this land forever will be known as a Holy Land after his name as Kurukshetra (the land of Kuru); second that anyone dying on this land will go to heaven.\n\nThe land of Kurukshetra was situated between two rivers\u2014the [[Sarasvati River|Sarasvati]] and the [[Drishadvati river|Drishadvati]].\n\nThis land has also been known as Uttarvedi, Brahmavedi, and Dharamkshetra at different periods. When King Kuru came on this land it was called Uttarvedi. Kurukshetra reached the zenith of its progress during the reign of King [[Harsha]], during which Chinese scholar [[Xuanzang]] visited Thanesar.\n\nKurukshetra was conquered by the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] empire in the late 4th century BCE and subsequently became a center of Buddhism and Hinduism. The history of Kurkushetra is little-known in between the collapse of the Mauryans and the rise of the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] who conquered the region. After the decline of Kushan power in the region, Kurkushetra became independent only to become conquered by the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] empire in the early 4th century CE. Under Gupta rule, Kurukshetra experienced a cultural and religious revival and became a center for Hinduism. After the fall of the Gupta, the [[Pushyabhuti dynasty|Pushyabhuti]] dynasty ruled over Kurukshetra.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=507\u2013508|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>\n\nCivil war broke out when [[Harsha]] (of the Pushyabhuti dynasty) died without a successor in 647. A Kashmiri army briefly conquered Kurukshetra in 733 but were unable to establish dominion in the area. In 736, the [[Tomara dynasty|Tomara]] dynasty was founded and they took over the region. Around the early 9th century, Kurukshetra lost its independence to Bengal. [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] sacked Kurukshetra in 1014 and Muslim raiders sacked it in 1034. Kurukshetra was incorporated into the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 1206. Other than a short moment of independence from the result of a rebellion within the Sultanate in 1240, Kurukshetra was under the control of Delhi until 1388.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nKurukshetra became independent once again after the steep decline of the Delhi Sultanate and the raids of [[Timur|Tamerlane]] near the region. The [[Sayyid dynasty]] incorporated Kurukshetra into their territory though the city likely enjoyed some autonomy. The area was much more firmly controlled under the subsequent [[Lodi dynasty]]. Some damages to Kurukshetra and its structures occurred during this period. Kurukshetra became part of the [[Mughal Empire]] after [[Babur]] quashed a local rebellion in 1526. Under [[Akbar]], Kurukshetra once again became a spiritual center not only for Hindus but also for Sikhs and Muslims.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBetween the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Kurukshetra was controlled by either Mughal or Sikh forces until the British took over Delhi in 1803. In 1805, the British took Kurukshetra after defeating Sikh forces who were controlling the city. Since 1947, Kurukshetra has become a popular spiritual center and has seen much infrastructure, development, and restoration of old structures.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==International Gita Mahotsav==\n[[Gita Jayanti]] has been celebrated in Kurukshetra for decades. For a long time, it was known as Kurukshetra Utsav. According to the Hindu calendar, the holiday comes on Mokshda Ekadashi in the month of Margshirsh.\n\nIn 2016, the government of Haryana decided to give the Gita Jayanti a global flavour and organised an International Gita Mahotsav at Kurukshetra from 1 to 11 December. The [[Gita Jayanti]] was celebrated on 10 December as dictated by the traditional calendar. Over 2 million people visited the event that year. Later, in 2017, Gita Jayanti was celebrated on 30 November as per the traditional calendar, and over 2.5 million people visited. The idea of celebrating International Gita Mahotsav came from [[Swami Gyananand]] (Founder of GIEO Gita). International Gita Mahotsav 2019 was organized from November 23, 2019 to December 10, 2019.

It is also known as '''Dharmakshetra''' (\"Holy Place\") and as the \"Land of the [[Bhagavad Gita]]\". The [[Kurukshetra War]] of the [[Mahabharata]] was found to have taken place there.\n\nAccording to the [[Puranas]], Kurukshetra is a region named after [[King Kuru]], the ancestor of Kauravas and Pandavas, as depicted in epic [[Mahabharata]]. The importance of the place is attributed to the fact that the [[Kurukshetra War]] of the [[Mahabharata]] is said to have taken place here. [[Thaneswar]] whose urban area is merged with Kurukshetra is a pilgrimage site with many locations attributed to Mahabharata.<ref>{{cite web | title = Kurukshetra (India)|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/325415/Kurukshetra | accessdate = 9 August 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn most ancient Hindu texts, Kurukshetra is not described as a city but a region (\"[[Tirtha (Hinduism)#Kshetra|kshetra]]\" means \"region\" in Sanskrit). The boundaries of Kurukshetra correspond roughly to the central and western parts of the state of Haryana and southern Punjab. According to the [[Taittiriya Aranyaka]] 5.1.1., the Kurukshetra region is south of Turghna (Srughna/Sugh in [[Sirhind]], Punjab), north of [[Khandava Forest|Khandava]] (Delhi and [[Mewat]] region), east of [[Thar Desert|Maru]] (desert), and west of Parin.<ref>[http://www.omilosmeleton.gr/english/documents/VedicEvidenceforAMT.pdf Agarwal, Vishal: Is There Vedic Evidence for the Indo-Aryan Immigration to India?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528001253/http://www.omilosmeleton.gr/english/documents/VedicEvidenceforAMT.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Kurukshetra War|label 1 = }}\n[[File:Kurukshetra.jpg|200px|thumb|left|A manuscript of [[Mahabharata]] depicting the war at Kurukshetra]]\nAccording to the [[Puranas]], ancient Hindu texts, the region is named after King [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]] of the [[Bharata (Mahabharata)#The Bharata race|Bharata]] dynasty, who is also the ancestor of Pandavas and Kauravas. These texts also tell that the battle of [[Mahabharata]] was fought on this land.\n\nAs the [[Vamana Purana]] describes, King Kuru chose land at the banks of [[Sarasvati River]] (dried up before 1900 BCE)<ref>''The Lost River'', by Michel Danino. Penguin India 2010</ref> for embedding spirituality with eight virtues:  austerity ([[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]]), truth ([[Satya]]), forgiveness (Kshama), kindness ([[Daya (Hinduism)|Daya]]), purity (Shuddha), charity ([[D\u0101na|Daana]]), devotion ([[Yajna]]), and conduct ([[Brahmacharya]]). Lord [[Vishnu]] was impressed with the acts of King Kuru and blessed him with two boons\u2014first, that this land forever will be known as a Holy Land after his name as Kurukshetra (the land of Kuru); second that anyone dying on this land will go to heaven.\n\nThe land of Kurukshetra was situated between two rivers\u2014the [[Sarasvati River|Sarasvati]] and the [[Drishadvati river|Drishadvati]].\n\nThis land has also been known as Uttarvedi, Brahmavedi, and Dharamkshetra at different periods. When King Kuru came on this land it was called Uttarvedi. Kurukshetra reached the zenith of its progress during the reign of King [[Harsha]], during which Chinese scholar [[Xuanzang]] visited Thanesar.\n\nKurukshetra was conquered by the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] empire in the late 4th century BCE and subsequently became a center of Buddhism and Hinduism. The history of Kurkushetra is little-known in between the collapse of the Mauryans and the rise of the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] who conquered the region. After the decline of Kushan power in the region, Kurkushetra became independent only to become conquered by the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] empire in the early 4th century CE. Under Gupta rule, Kurukshetra experienced a cultural and religious revival and became a center for Hinduism. After the fall of the Gupta, the [[Pushyabhuti dynasty|Pushyabhuti]] dynasty ruled over Kurukshetra.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=507\u2013508|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>\n\nCivil war broke out when [[Harsha]] (of the Pushyabhuti dynasty) died without a successor in 647. A Kashmiri army briefly conquered Kurukshetra in 733 but were unable to establish dominion in the area. In 736, the [[Tomara dynasty|Tomara]] dynasty was founded and they took over the region. Around the early 9th century, Kurukshetra lost its independence to Bengal. [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] sacked Kurukshetra in 1014 and Muslim raiders sacked it in 1034. Kurukshetra was incorporated into the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 1206. Other than a short moment of independence from the result of a rebellion within the Sultanate in 1240, Kurukshetra was under the control of Delhi until 1388.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nKurukshetra became independent once again after the steep decline of the Delhi Sultanate and the raids of [[Timur|Tamerlane]] near the region. The [[Sayyid dynasty]] incorporated Kurukshetra into their territory though the city likely enjoyed some autonomy. The area was much more firmly controlled under the subsequent [[Lodi dynasty]]. Some damages to Kurukshetra and its structures occurred during this period. Kurukshetra became part of the [[Mughal Empire]] after [[Babur]] quashed a local rebellion in 1526. Under [[Akbar]], Kurukshetra once again became a spiritual center not only for Hindus but also for Sikhs and Muslims.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBetween the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Kurukshetra was controlled by either Mughal or Sikh forces until the British took over Delhi in 1803. In 1805, the British took Kurukshetra after defeating Sikh forces who were controlling the city. Since 1947, Kurukshetra has become a popular spiritual center and has seen much infrastructure, development, and restoration of old structures.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==International Gita Mahotsav==\n[[Gita Jayanti]] has been celebrated in Kurukshetra for decades. For a long time, it was known as Kurukshetra Utsav. According to the Hindu calendar, the holiday comes on Mokshda Ekadashi in the month of Margshirsh.\n\nIn 2016, the government of Haryana decided to give the Gita Jayanti a global flavour and organised an International Gita Mahotsav at Kurukshetra from 1 to 11 December. The [[Gita Jayanti]] was celebrated on 10 December as dictated by the traditional calendar. Over 2 million people visited the event that year. Later, in 2017, Gita Jayanti was celebrated on 30 November as per the traditional calendar, and over 2.5 million people visited. The idea of celebrating International Gita Mahotsav came from [[Swami Gyananand]] (Founder of GIEO Gita). International Gita Mahotsav 2019 was organized from November 23, 2019 to December 10, 2019.
