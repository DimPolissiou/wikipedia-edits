It is the largest collection of military vehicles in Australia, and the only major collection of vehicles in Australia apart from the [[Royal Australian Armoured Corps Memorial and Army Tank Museum]] at [[Puckapunyal]]. It is one of the largest private collections of artillery and AFVs in the world.\n\nThe museum houses vehicles from a number of overseas manufacturers, including vehicles from Russia, German, Japan, the UK, the US and Czechoslovakia.\n[[File:PZ IV D.jpg|thumb|Operational Panzer IV Ausf D|335x335px]]\n\n== Collection ==\n\nThe museum houses artillery dating back to World War I and vehicles from World War II and the post war period.

Mostly these are still being prepared in workshops, either on site or overseas, or they are in transit to the Museum. Some of these include a Panther A, Cromwell Medium Tank, ISU152 and close to another 25 additional planned exhibits\n\n== AusArmourfest ==\n[[File:Sherman Firefly at AusArmourfest.jpg|thumb|351x351px|Sherman Firefly at AusArmourfest 2019]]\nEach year to celebrate the Museums birthday, the Museum hosts a two day event called AusArmourfest. AusArmourfest gives people the opportunity to go for rides in some of the operational vehicles. In past years some of the vehicles have included the Hetzer, T72, Panzer IV G, Leopard, Kettenkrad, Sabre and many more. \n\n== Donation of Australian Tank From Wargaming Inc ==\n\nThe museum hosts two rare Australian Cruiser tanks (two of six left in the world), an AC1 Sentinel and a hybrid AC1 with an AC3 turret, presented as an AC4. The AC1 Sentinel was purchased and given to the museum by [[Wargaming (company)|Wargaming Inc]], producer of the [[World of Tanks]] tank game. The Sentinel was in the United States at the [[Littlefield Collection]] when that collection sold off many of its vehicles, and Wargaming Inc desired to purchase it and return it to its original home.<ref>Salsone, Kieran. [http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/resurrected-australian-sentinel-tank-hits-world-st/2977134 \"Resurrected Australian Sentinel Tank Hits World\"], 28 March 2016</ref> As part of the purchase, it allowed access to the tank by Wargaming, so that they could study it and replicate it accurately for their game.\n\n== Shooting gallery and workshop ==\n\nThe Museum site also includes a 50-metre shooting gallery and a repair/restoration workshop where the vehicles which are in a state of deterioration can be restored. The workshop has a number of staff and can modify and build vehicles. As of 2015, the site has expanded to house more vehicles.\n\n== Tiger 1 replica ==\n\nIn 2016, the museum workshop undertook construction of a Tiger 1 replica. This utilised a highly accurate, partially constructed Tiger 1 that was originally constructed for the movie [[Fury (2014 film)|Fury]], which in itself was an accurate replica of Tiger 131. The reconstruction utilised that upper portion of the Tiger, and also referenced original tiger parts the museum had purchased to make the whole tank. The bottom chassis was strengthened to be able to run, the first time the museum had produced its own tank from scratch. The Tiger reproduction uses a Scania truck engine. The running gear is T55 (Track,support arms and torsion bars) M110 Road wheels and the drive/ steering component is from a T62, but it is outwardly a running, almost completely accurate Tiger 1, except that the front drive sprocket (which due to the T62 T/case sits 200mm too high) and T55 Track. It was completed in November 2016, and is the only reproduction tank of this scale to be completed in Australia.\n\n== See also == \n*[[National Military Vehicle Museum]]\n*[[Royal Australian Armoured Corps Memorial and Army Tank Museum]]\n*[[The Army Museum Bandiana]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ausarmour.com Australian Armour and Artillery Museum] \u2013 official site\n* [http://www.travel-news-photos-stories.com/2014/12/new-tank-and-armour-museum-opens-in.html New Tank Museum Opens] \u2013 media report.

AusArmourfest gives people the opportunity to go for rides in some of the operational vehicles. In past years some of the vehicles have included the Hetzer, T72, Panzer IV G, Leopard, Kettenkrad, Sabre and many more. \n\n== Donation of Australian Tank From Wargaming Inc ==\n\nThe museum hosts two rare Australian Cruiser tanks (two of six left in the world), an AC1 Sentinel and a hybrid AC1 with an AC3 turret, presented as an AC4. The AC1 Sentinel was purchased and given to the museum by [[Wargaming (company)|Wargaming Inc]], producer of the [[World of Tanks]] tank game. The Sentinel was in the United States at the [[Littlefield Collection]] when that collection sold off many of its vehicles, and Wargaming Inc desired to purchase it and return it to its original home.<ref>Salsone, Kieran. [http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/resurrected-australian-sentinel-tank-hits-world-st/2977134 \"Resurrected Australian Sentinel Tank Hits World\"], 28 March 2016</ref> As part of the purchase, it allowed access to the tank by Wargaming, so that they could study it and replicate it accurately for their game.\n\n== Shooting gallery and workshop ==\n\nThe Museum site also includes a 50-metre shooting gallery and a repair/restoration workshop where the vehicles which are in a state of deterioration can be restored. The workshop has a number of staff and can modify and build vehicles. As of 2015, the site has expanded to house more vehicles.\n\n== Tiger 1 replica ==\n\nIn 2016, the museum workshop undertook construction of a Tiger 1 replica. This utilised a highly accurate, partially constructed Tiger 1 that was originally constructed for the movie [[Fury (2014 film)|Fury]], which in itself was an accurate replica of Tiger 131. The reconstruction utilised that upper portion of the Tiger, and also referenced original tiger parts the museum had purchased to make the whole tank. The bottom chassis was strengthened to be able to run, the first time the museum had produced its own tank from scratch. The Tiger reproduction uses a Scania truck engine. The running gear is T55 (Track,support arms and torsion bars) M110 Road wheels and the drive/ steering component is from a T62, but it is outwardly a running, almost completely accurate Tiger 1, except that the front drive sprocket (which due to the T62 T/case sits 200mm too high) and T55 Track. It was completed in November 2016, and is the only reproduction tank of this scale to be completed in Australia.\n\n== See also == \n*[[National Military Vehicle Museum]]\n*[[Royal Australian Armoured Corps Memorial and Army Tank Museum]]\n*[[The Army Museum Bandiana]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ausarmour.com Australian Armour and Artillery Museum] \u2013 official site\n* [http://www.travel-news-photos-stories.com/2014/12/new-tank-and-armour-museum-opens-in.html New Tank Museum Opens] \u2013 media report.
