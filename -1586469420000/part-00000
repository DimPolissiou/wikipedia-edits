Following the failure of de Lacy's male heirs in 1241, the Lordship was split between two great-granddaughters. One moiety, a central eastern portion, was awarded to [[Maud de Lacy, Baroness Geneville|Maud]] (de Geneville) as the [[County palatine|liberty]] of [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]]; the other moiety, comprising north-eastern and western portions, went to Maud's sister Margery (de Verdun) and in 1297 became the [[County Meath|royal county of Meath]]. The liberty and royal county were merged in 1461. While the east of the county was in the [[English Pale]], the west was [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelicised]] in the fourteenth century and outside the control of the [[High Sheriff of Meath|sheriff of Meath]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Steven G.|title=Defending English Ground: War and Peace in Meath and Northumberland, 1460\u20131542 |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=oxcaCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA62 |pages=62\u201364 |accessdate=2015-06-24|date=2015-05-07|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199696291}}</ref>\n\nAs a part of the better administration of the newly established [[Kingdom of Ireland]], the [[Parliament of Ireland]] passed the [[Counties of Meath and Westmeath Act 1543]], the eastern portion retaining the name Meath and the western portion called Westmeath.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Statutes at Large passed at the Parliaments held in Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXhaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA232|volume=1: 1310 to 1612|year=1765|publisher=B.

It stabilised in the middle of the 20th century, and has continued to grow. Westmeath's proximity to [[Dublin]], with good motorway facilities and frequent rail service, has made commuting popular.\n\nCounty Westmeath's population fell in the century following the Great Famine, with many leaving for better opportunities in America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westmeathtourism.com/history.html|title= Population decline in County}}</ref>\nThe largest town in the county is [[Athlone]], followed by the County town [[Mullingar]]. Westmeath is the largest county by population in the [[Irish Midlands]]. Important commercial and marketing centres include [[Moate]], [[Kilbeggan]], [[Kinnegad]], [[Ballinahown]], [[Delvin]], [[Rochfortbridge]], [[Killucan]] and [[Castlepollard]]. According to the 2011 census, 51.9% of Westmeath households have at least one Irish speaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/saveselections.asp|title= Demographics of Westmeath}}</ref>\n\nWestmeath is one of the few counties in Ireland where some census records from 1841 are still available.

Athlone developed due to its military significance, and its strategic location on the main Dublin\u2013Galway route across the [[River Shannon]]. Mullingar gained considerable advantage from the development of the [[Royal Canal]]. The canal facilitated cheap transport of produce to Dublin, Britain and Europe. Athlone and Mullingar expanded further with the coming of the [[Midland Great Western Railway]] network in the nineteenth century.\n\nTourism in Westmeath is generally based on its many water amenities. The county lakes include [[Lough Derravaragh]], [[Lough Ennell]], [[Lough Owel]], [[Lough Lene]], [[Lough Sheelin]] and [[Lough Ree]]. Both the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]], and the Royal Canal flow through Westmeath, and the [[River Shannon]] (Ireland's key tourism waterway) has a modern inland harbour in Athlone.\n\nIn 2017 the largest employment sectors within Westmeath were:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibec.ie/IBEC/Press/PressPublicationsdoclib3.nsf/vPages/Newsroom%7Eibec-highlights-need-to-address-infrastructure-imbalance-15-02-2017/$file/Local+Economic+Indicators+2017.pdf |title=Eibic highlights |date=2017 |website=www.ibec.ie |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Athone - Mullingar section of the Dublin \u2013 Galway Greenway, along the old railway corridor between Athlone and Mullingar, was constructed in 2015. \n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.westmeathcoco.ie/en/ourservices/tourismartsrecreation/greenway/|title=Westmeath County Council - Westmeath Royal Canal Greenway<!-- Bot generated title -->|author=|date=|website=westmeathcoco.ie|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>\nThe Royal Canal Greenway takes tourists from the county boundary to Mullingar, and then on towards Longford. Those wishing to use the Dublin-Galway Greenway can transfer from the Royal Canal route to the old rail corridor onwards towards Athlone.\n\nThe development of industry in Westmeath has been mainly based on food processing and consumer products. Whiskey is distilled in Kilbeggan and tobacco is processed in Mullingar. The county has an extensive beef and dairy trade. In recent times, the manufacturer [[Alkermes (company)|Alkermes]] has located in Athlone. The eastern part of the county is home to commuters, many of whom work at the technology parks on the western side of [[Dublin]].\n\nMullingar is renowned for the high quality of its beef and veal. Weaned cattle from the west of the [[River Shannon|Shannon]] are fattened for market on the lush [[grassland]]s of Meath and Westmeath. The cattle are also used to maintain grassland to help sustain wildlife in the areas fringing the [[Bog of Allen]].\n\nWestmeath is home to many stud farms. The plains of Westmeath, covered in calcium-rich [[marl]], contribute significantly to calcification of foal bones during their formative years. Westmeath mares are usually put into foal in spring to facilitate summer growth. Pregnancy lasts for approximately 335\u2013340 days and usually results in one foal. Horses mature when they are around four years old.\n\n==Railways==\nWestmeath also has railway infrastructure with a number of trains passing through towns in the county. The [[Dublin\u2013Westport/Galway railway line]] runs through the county, with services from [[Dublin Heuston]] to [[Galway railway station|Galway]]/[[Westport railway station, Mayo|Westport]]/[[Ballina railway station|Ballina]] inter-city train service stops at [[Athlone railway station|Athlone]], while the [[Dublin-Sligo railway line]] service stops at [[Mullingar railway station|Mullingar]].  The line from [[Athlone railway station|Athlone]] via [[Moate railway station]] to [[Mullingar railway station|Mullingar]] could be reopened for trains from [[Galway railway station|Galway]] to [[Dublin Connolly]]. Other major infrastructural projects and plans for the county include [[Transport 21]].\n\n==Road transport==\nRoads are of good quality in the county. As part of the [[Transport 21]] infrastructure programme undertaken by the government, both the [[N4 road (Ireland)|N4]] and [[N6 road (Ireland)|N6]] roads have been upgraded to [[motorway]] or [[dual carriageway]] standard. All towns that these roads passed through are now bypassed, such as [[Mullingar]], [[Athlone]], [[Moate]] and [[Kinnegad]]. Both [[Dublin]] and [[Galway]] are within commuting distance from Westmeath following the completion of the [[M6 motorway (Ireland)|M6 motorway]] in December 2009.\n* [[Midlands Gateway|Midlands (ATM) Gateway]]\n* [[National Development Plan]]\n* [[Transport 21]]\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:Athlone IT.jpg|thumb|The [[Athlone IT]] International Arena in [[Athlone]]]]\n\nWestmeath is an active sporting county. The [[Westmeath GAA]] senior [[Gaelic football|football]] team won the [[Leinster Senior Football Championship]], the Delaney Cup, in 2004. They also won the National Football League [[2015 National Football League (Ireland)#Division 2|Division 2]] in 2001, 2003 and 2008. The Westmeath senior [[hurling]] team has enjoyed much recent success winning the [[Christy Ring Cup]] in 2005, 2007 and 2010.\n\n[[Athlone Town F.C.]] have won the League of Ireland Championship on two occasions, in 1980 and 1982, and the [[FAI Cup]] in 1924.\n\nWestmeath Ladies won the 2011 All-Ireland Intermediate Football Championship.\n\n[[Athlone Institute of Technology]] boasts a \u20ac10 million international athletics arena, which opened in early 2013. The International Arena has a footprint of 6,818m2 and an overall building floor area of 9,715m2. Some 850 tonnes of structural steel and fifty thousand concrete blocks went into the construction of the facility, which can house two thousand spectators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ait.ie/internationalarena/|title=AIT International Arena|work=ait.ie|access-date=14 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118072003/http://www.ait.ie/internationalarena/|archive-date=18 January 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWestmeath Snooker Ranking Tournaments officially recognised by The Republic of Ireland Billiards & Snooker Association are organised and run by St Mary's Snooker Club Bishopgate Street Mullingar.

Following the failure of de Lacy's male heirs in 1241, the Lordship was split between two great-granddaughters. One moiety, a central eastern portion, was awarded to [[Maud de Lacy, Baroness Geneville|Maud]] (de Geneville) as the [[County palatine|liberty]] of [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]]; the other moiety, comprising north-eastern and western portions, went to Maud's sister Margery (de Verdun) and in 1297 became the [[County Meath|royal county of Meath]]. The liberty and royal county were merged in 1461.

Athlone developed due to its military significance, and its strategic location on the main Dublin\u2013Galway route across the [[River Shannon]]. Mullingar gained considerable advantage from the development of the [[Royal Canal]]. The canal facilitated cheap transport of produce to Dublin, Britain and Europe. Athlone and Mullingar expanded further with the coming of the [[Midland Great Western Railway]] network in the nineteenth century.\n\nTourism in Westmeath is generally based on its many water amenities. The county lakes include [[Lough Derravaragh]], [[Lough Ennell]], [[Lough Owel]], [[Lough Lene]], [[Lough Sheelin]] and [[Lough Ree]]. Both the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]], and the Royal Canal flow through Westmeath, and the [[River Shannon]] (Ireland's key tourism waterway) has a modern inland harbour in Athlone.\n\nIn 2017 the largest employment sectors within Westmeath were:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibec.ie/IBEC/Press/PressPublicationsdoclib3.nsf/vPages/Newsroom%7Eibec-highlights-need-to-address-infrastructure-imbalance-15-02-2017/$file/Local+Economic+Indicators+2017.pdf |title=Eibic highlights |date=2017 |website=www.ibec.ie |format=PDF}}</ref> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Athone - Mullingar section of the Dublin \u2013 Galway Greenway, along the old railway corridor between Athlone and Mullingar, was constructed in 2015. \n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.westmeathcoco.ie/en/ourservices/tourismartsrecreation/greenway/|title=Westmeath County Council - Westmeath Royal Canal Greenway<!-- Bot generated title -->|author=|date=|website=westmeathcoco.ie|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>\nThe Royal Canal Greenway takes tourists from the county boundary to Mullingar, and then on towards Longford. Those wishing to use the Dublin-Galway Greenway can transfer from the Royal Canal route to the old rail corridor onwards towards Athlone.\n\nThe development of industry in Westmeath has been mainly based on food processing and consumer products. Whiskey is distilled in Kilbeggan and tobacco is processed in Mullingar. The county has an extensive beef and dairy trade. In recent times, the manufacturer [[Alkermes (company)|Alkermes]] has located in Athlone. The eastern part of the county is home to commuters, many of whom work at the technology parks on the western side of [[Dublin]].\n\nMullingar is renowned for the high quality of its beef and veal. Weaned cattle from the west of the [[River Shannon|Shannon]] are fattened for market on the lush [[grassland]]s of Meath and Westmeath. The cattle are also used to maintain grassland to help sustain wildlife in the areas fringing the [[Bog of Allen]].\n\nWestmeath is home to many stud farms. The plains of Westmeath, covered in calcium-rich [[marl]], contribute significantly to calcification of foal bones during their formative years. Westmeath mares are usually put into foal in spring to facilitate summer growth. Pregnancy lasts for approximately 335\u2013340 days and usually results in one foal. Horses mature when they are around four years old.\n\n==Railways==\nWestmeath also has railway infrastructure with a number of trains passing through towns in the county. The [[Dublin\u2013Westport/Galway railway line]] runs though the county, with services from [[Dublin Heuston]] to [[Galway railway station|Galway]]/[[Westport railway station, Mayo|Westport]]/[[Ballina railway station|Ballina]] inter-city train service stops at [[Athlone railway station|Athlone]], while the [[Dublin-Sligo railway line]] service stops at [[Mullingar railway station|Mullingar]].  The line from [[Athlone railway station|Athlone]] via [[Moate railway station]] to [[Mullingar railway station|Mullingar]] could be reopened for trains from [[Galway railway station|Galway]] to [[Dublin Connolly]]. Other major infrastructural projects and plans for the county include [[Transport 21]].\n\n==Road transport==\nRoads are of good quality in the county. As part of the [[Transport 21]] infrastructure programme undertaken by the government, both the [[N4 road (Ireland)|N4]] and [[N6 road (Ireland)|N6]] roads have been upgraded to [[motorway]] or [[dual carriageway]] standard. All towns that these roads passed through are now bypassed, such as [[Mullingar]], [[Athlone]], [[Moate]] and [[Kinnegad]]. Both [[Dublin]] and [[Galway]] are within commuting distance from Westmeath following the completion of the [[M6 motorway (Ireland)|M6 motorway]] in December 2009.\n* [[Midlands Gateway|Midlands (ATM) Gateway]]\n* [[National Development Plan]]\n* [[Transport 21]]\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:Athlone IT.jpg|thumb|The [[Athlone IT]] International Arena in [[Athlone]]]]\n\nWestmeath is an active sporting county. The [[Westmeath GAA]] senior [[Gaelic football|football]] team won the [[Leinster Senior Football Championship]], the Delaney Cup, in 2004. They also won the National Football League [[2015 National Football League (Ireland)#Division 2|Division 2]] in 2001, 2003 and 2008. The Westmeath senior [[hurling]] team has enjoyed much recent success winning the [[Christy Ring Cup]] in 2005, 2007 and 2010.\n\n[[Athlone Town F.C.]] have won the League of Ireland Championship on two occasions, in 1980 and 1982, and the [[FAI Cup]] in 1924.\n\nWestmeath Ladies won the 2011 All-Ireland Intermediate Football Championship.\n\n[[Athlone Institute of Technology]] boasts a \u20ac10 million international athletics arena, which opened in early 2013. The International Arena has a footprint of 6,818m2 and an overall building floor area of 9,715m2.

His books include ''Lizard Music'', ''The Snarkout Boys and the Avocado of Death'', ''Fat Men from Space'', ''[[Borgel]]'', and the picture book ''[[The Big Orange Splot]]''. He has also written an adult novel, ''The Afterlife Diet'', and essay collections derived from his talks on [[National Public Radio]].\n\nMany elements of his fiction are based on real events and people he encountered in his youth.\n\nPinkwater is a trained artist and has illustrated many of his books, but for more recent works, that task has passed to his wife, Jill Pinkwater. His artistic technique varies from work to work, with some books illustrated in computer drawings, others in woodcuts and others in Magic Marker.\n\nPinkwater varies his name slightly between books (for instance, \"Daniel Pinkwater\", \"Daniel M. Pinkwater\", \"Daniel Manus Pinkwater\", \"D. Manus Pinkwater\").\n\nHe was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to [[Judaism|Jewish]] immigrant parents from [[Poland]].  He describes his father as a \"ham-eating, iconoclastic Jew.\" His parents moved to [[Chicago]], where he grew up. He attended [[Bard College]].\n\n==Themes==\nPinkwater tends to write about social misfits who find themselves in bizarre situations, such as searching for a floating island populated by human-sized intelligent lizards (''Lizard Music''), exploring other universes with an obscure relative (''[[Borgel]]''), or discovering that their teeth can function as interstellar [[radio]] antennae (''Fat Men from Space'').  They are often, though not always, set in thinly\u2014or not at all\u2014disguised versions of Chicago and [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].  He often includes Chicago landmarks and folkloric figures from his childhood in 1950s Chicago, regardless of when the book is set. An example of this is the recurring character the Chicken Man, a mysterious but dignified black man who carries a performing chicken on his head.  This character is based on a shadowy figure from 1950s Chicago; after Pinkwater made him a lead character in ''Lizard Music'' he received letters from Chicago residents who remembered the Chicken Man.  Pinkwater also pays tribute to the Clark Theater (a repertory movie theatre on Clark Street in the [[Chicago Loop]] that changed features daily and stayed open all night), [[Bughouse Square]], and Ed & Fred's Red Hots.  Another common theme is Jewish culture, with characters incongruously speaking in [[Yiddish]]-influenced dialogue or participating in [[Borscht Belt]] culture. Characters sometimes have surnames that append the \"-stein\" element familiar in some Jewish names to names suggesting other ethnicities (e.g., \"Wentworthstein\").\n\nIn 1995, Pinkwater published his first adult novel, ''The Afterlife Diet'', in which a mediocre editor, upon dying, finds himself in a tacky [[Catskills]] resort populated by \"circumferentially challenged\" deceased.\n\n==Comics and radio==\nPinkwater authored the newspaper comic strip ''[[Norb (comic)|Norb]]'', which was illustrated by [[Tony Auth]].  The strip, syndicated by [[King Features]], was cancelled after 52 weeks.<ref>\n[http://www.toonopedia.com/norb.htm Norb] ''Don Markstein's Toonopedia'',  accessed on May 10, 2007.</ref>  The daily strips were released in a 78-page collection by [[MU Press]] in 1992.\n\nPinkwater is also a longtime commentator on [[National Public Radio]].  He regularly reviews children's books on NPR's ''Weekend Edition Saturday''.  For several years, he had his own NPR show: ''Chinwag Theater''.  Pinkwater is also known to avid fans of the NPR radio show ''[[Car Talk]]'', where he has appeared as a (seemingly) random caller, commenting, for example, on the physics of the buttocks (giving rise to the proposed unit of measure of seat size: the Pinkwater), and giving practical advice as to the choice of [[automobile]]s.  In the early 1990s Pinkwater voiced a series of humorous radio advertisements for the Ford Motor Company.\n\n==Challenged book==\nFollowing an appearance by Pinkwater on the [[Public Radio International]] program ''[[This American Life]]'',<ref>[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/43/faustian-bargains?act=4 This American Life episode #43: Faustian Bargains], broadcast 22 November 1996. ([http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/43/transcript transcript])</ref> his book ''The Devil in the Drain'' ended up on [[Challenge (literature)|challenged]] book lists at numerous children's libraries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwplatt.edu/swal/Conference/Fall04Conference.htm|title=Fall 2004 SWAL Conference Information|publisher=Southwest Wisconsin Association of Libraries Conferences|accessdate=29 January 2011|archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:gH6veCPSR8gJ:www.uwplatt.edu/swal/Conferences/Fall04Conference.htm+http://www.uwplatt.edu/swal/Conference/Fall04Conference.htm&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a|archivedate=Jan 15, 2011}}</ref><!-- This is incorrect!

His books include ''Lizard Music'', ''The Snarkout Boys and the Avocado of Death'', ''Fat Men from Space'', ''[[Borgel]]'', and the picture book ''[[The Big Orange Splot]]''. He has also written an adult novel, ''The Afterlife Diet'', and essay collections derived from his talks on [[National Public Radio]].\n\nMany elements of his fiction are based on real events and people he encountered in his youth.\n\nPinkwater is a trained artist and has illustrated many of his books, but for more recent works, that task has passed to his wife, Jill Pinkwater. His artistic technique varies from work to work, with some books illustrated in computer drawings, others in woodcuts and others in Magic Marker.\n\nPinkwater varies his name slightly between books (for instance, \"Daniel Pinkwater\", \"Daniel M. Pinkwater\", \"Daniel Manus Pinkwater\", \"D. Manus Pinkwater\").\n\nHe was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to [[Judaism|Jewish]] immigrant parents from [[Poland]].  He describes his father as a \"ham-eating, iconoclastic Jew.\" His parents moved to [[Chicago]], where he grew up. He attended [[Bard College]].\n\n==Themes==\nPinkwater tends to write about social misfits who find themselves in bizarre situations, such as searching for a floating island populated by human-sized intelligent lizards (''Lizard Music''), exploring other universes with an obscure relative (''[[Borgel]]''), or discovering that their teeth can function as interstellar [[radio]] antennae (''Fat Men from Space'').  They are often, though not always, set in thinly\u2014or not at all\u2014disguised versions of Chicago and [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].  He often includes Chicago landmarks and folkloric figures from his childhood in 1950s Chicago, regardless of when the book is set. An example of this is the recurring character the Chicken Man, a mysterious but dignified black man who carries a performing chicken on his head.  This character is based on a shadowy figure from 1950s Chicago; after Pinkwater made him a lead character in ''Lizard Music'' he received letters from Chicago residents who remembered the Chicken Man.  Pinkwater also pays tribute to the Clark Theater (a repertory movie theatre on Clark Street in the [[Chicago Loop]] that changed features daily and stayed open all night), [[Bughouse Square]], and Ed & Fred's Red Hots.  Another common theme is Jewish culture, with characters incongruously speaking in [[Yiddish]]-influenced dialogue or participating in [[Borscht Belt]] culture. Characters sometimes have surnames that append the \"-stein\" element familiar in some Jewish names to names suggesting other ethnicities (e.g., \"Wentworthstein\").\n\nIn 1995, Pinkwater published his first adult novel, ''The Afterlife Diet'', in which a mediocre editor, upon dying, finds himself in a tacky [[Catskills]] resort populated by \"circumferentially challenged\" deceased.\n\n==Comics and radio==\nPinkwater authored the newspaper comic strip ''[[Norb (comic)|Norb]]'', which was illustrated by [[Tony Auth]].  The strip, syndicated by [[King Features]], was cancelled after 52 weeks.<ref>\n[http://www.toonopedia.com/norb.htm Norb] ''Don Markstein's Toonopedia'',  accessed on May 10, 2007.</ref>  The daily strips were released in a 78-page collection by [[MU Press]] in 1992.\n\nPinkwater is also a longtime commentator on [[National Public Radio]].  He regularly reviews children's books on NPR's ''Weekend Edition Saturday''.  For several years, he had his own NPR show: ''Chinwag Theater''.  Pinkwater is also known to avid fans of the NPR radio show ''[[Car Talk]]'', where he has appeared as a (seemingly) random caller, commenting, for example, on the physics of the buttocks (giving rise to the proposed unit of measure of seat size: the Pinkwater), and giving practical advice as to the choice of [[automobile]]s.  In the early 1990s Pinkwater voiced a series of humorous radio advertisements for the Ford Motor Company.\n\n==Challenged book==\nFollowing an appearance by Pinkwater on the [[Public Radio International]] program ''[[This American Life]]'',<ref>[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/43/faustian-bargains?act=4 This American Life episode #43: Faustian Bargains], broadcast 22 November 1996.

The earliest known [[recorded history]] [[Classical African civilization|arose]] in [[Ancient Egypt]], and later in [[Nubia]], the [[Sahel]], the [[Maghreb]] and the [[Horn of Africa]].\n\nFollowing the [[desertification]] of the [[Sahara]], North African history became entwined with the [[Middle East]] and [[Southern Europe]] while the [[Bantu expansion]] swept from modern day [[Cameroon]] (Central Africa) across much of the sub-Saharan continent in waves between around 1000 BC and 0 [[AD]], creating a linguistic commonality across much of the central and Southern continent.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], [[Islam]] spread west from Arabia to Egypt, crossing the Maghreb and the Sahel. Some notable pre-colonial states and societies in Africa include the [[Ajuran Empire]], [[D'mt]], [[Adal Sultanate]], [[Alodia]], Warsangali Sultanate, [[Kingdom of Nri]], [[Nok culture]], [[Mali Empire]], [[Songhai Empire]], [[Benin Empire]], [[Oyo Empire]], [[Kingdom of Lunda (Punu-yaka)]], [[Ashanti Empire]], [[Ghana Empire]], [[Mossi Kingdoms]], [[Mutapa Empire]], [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]], [[Kingdom of Sine]], [[Sennar (sultanate)|Kingdom of Sennar]], [[Kingdom of Saloum]], [[Kingdom of Baol]], Kingdom of [[Cayor]], [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]], [[Kingdom of Kongo]], Empire of [[Kaabu]], Kingdom of [[Ile Ife]], [[Ancient Carthage]], [[Numidia]], [[Mauretania]], and the [[Aksumite Empire]]. At its peak, prior to European [[colonialism]], it is estimated that Africa had up to 10,000 different states and autonomous groups with distinct languages and customs.<ref name=\"http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/10/31/getting-to-know-africa-50-facts/\">Africa Information</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-7th century, the [[Arab slave trade]] saw Muslim Arabs enslave Africans. Following an armistice between the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and the [[Kingdom of Makuria]] after the [[Second Battle of Dongola]] in 652 AD, they were transported, along with Asians and Europeans, across the [[Red Sea]], [[Indian Ocean]], and [[Sahara Desert]].\n\nFrom the late 15th century, Europeans joined the slave trade. One could say the Portuguese led in partnership with other Europeans. That includes the triangular trade, with the Portuguese initially acquiring slaves through trade and later by force as part of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. They transported enslaved [[West Africa|West]], [[Central Africa|Central]], and [[Southern Africa|Southern]] Africans overseas.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/slavetrade.htm |title = African Slave Trade, 1788}}</ref> Subsequently, European colonization of Africa developed rapidly from around 10% (1870) to over 90% (1914) in the [[Scramble for Africa]] (1881\u20131914).  However following struggles for independence in many parts of the continent, as well as a weakened Europe after the [[Second World War]] {{nowrap|(1939\u20131945)}}, [[decolonization]] took place across the continent, culminating in the 1960 [[Year of Africa]].\n\nDisciplines such as recording of [[oral history]], [[historical linguistics]], [[archaeology of Africa|archaeology]] and [[genetics]] have been vital in rediscovering the great African civilizations of antiquity.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n{{Human history}}\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{Further|Prehistoric North Africa|Sub-Saharan Africa#Prehistory|History of West Africa#Prehistory|Central Africa#Prehistory|East Africa#Prehistory|Horn of Africa#Prehistory|African archaeology}}\n\n===Paleolithic===\n{{Main|Lower Paleolithic|Middle Stone Age|Later Stone Age}}\nThe first known [[Hominidae|hominids]] evolved in Africa. According to [[paleontology]], the early hominids' skull anatomy was similar to that of the [[gorilla]] and the [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]], [[great apes]] that also evolved in Africa, but the hominids had adopted a [[biped]]al locomotion which freed their hands. This gave them a crucial advantage, enabling them to live in both forested areas and on the open [[savanna]] at a time when Africa was drying up and the savanna was encroaching on forested areas. This would have occurred 10 to 5 million years ago, but these claims are controversial because biologists and genetics have humans appearing around the last 70 thousand to 200 thousand years.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), ''History of Africa'', p. 2. Rev. 2nd ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|0-333-59957-8}}.</ref>\n\nBy 4 million years ago, several [[Australopithecus|australopithecine]] hominid species had developed throughout [[Southern Africa|Southern]], [[East Africa|Eastern]] and [[Central Africa]]. They were tool users, and makers of tools. They scavenged for meat and were omnivores.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 2.</ref>\n\nBy approximately 3.3 million years ago, primitive stone tools were first used to scavenge kills made by other predators and to harvest carrion and marrow from their bones. In hunting, ''[[Homo habilis]]'' was probably not capable of competing with large predators and was still more prey than hunter. ''H. habilis'' probably did steal eggs from nests and may have been able to catch small [[game (food)|game]] and weakened larger prey (cubs and older animals). The tools were classed as [[Oldowan]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, p. 2-3\">Shillington (2005), pp. 2\u20133.</ref>\n\nAround 1.8 million years ago, ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' first appeared in the fossil record in Africa. From ''Homo ergaster'', ''[[Homo erectus]]'' evolved 1.5 million years ago. Some of the earlier representatives of this species were still fairly small-brained and used primitive stone tools, much like ''H. habilis''. The brain later grew in size, and ''H. erectus'' eventually developed a more complex stone tool technology called the [[Acheulean]]. Possibly the first hunters, ''H. erectus'' mastered the art of making fire and was the first hominid to leave Africa, colonizing most of [[Afro-Eurasia]] and perhaps later giving rise to ''[[Homo floresiensis]]''. Although some recent writers have suggested that ''[[Homo georgicus]]'' was the first and primary hominid ever to live outside Africa, many scientists consider ''H. georgicus'' to be an early and primitive member of the ''H. erectus'' species.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 3.</ref><ref>Ehret, Christopher (2002), ''The Civilizations of Africa'', p. 22.

The regions with the largest population pressure were in the [[Nile Delta]] region of [[Lower Egypt]], in [[Upper Egypt]], and also along the [[Cataracts of the Nile|second and third cataracts]] of the [[Dongola Reach]] of the Nile in Nubia. This population pressure and growth was brought about by the cultivation of southwest Asian crops, including wheat and barley, and the raising of sheep, goats, and cattle. Population growth led to competition for farm land and the need to regulate farming. Regulation was established by the formation of [[Bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] among sacral chiefdoms. The first and most powerful of the chiefdoms was [[Ta-Seti]], founded around 3,500 BC. The idea of sacral chiefdom spread throughout Upper and Lower Egypt.<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 143\u2013146.</ref>\n\n[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[pyramids of Giza]], symbols of the civilization of ancient Egypt]]\nLater consolidation of the chiefdoms into broader political entities began to occur in Upper and Lower Egypt, culminating into the unification of Egypt into one political entity by [[Narmer]] ([[Menes]]) in 3,100 BC. Instead of being viewed as a sacral chief, he became a [[Imperial cult|divine king]]. The [[henotheism]], or worship of a single god within a polytheistic system, practiced in the sacral chiefdoms along Upper and Lower Egypt, became the polytheistic [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]. Bureaucracies became more centralized under the [[pharaoh]]s, run by [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|viziers]], governors, tax collectors, generals, artists, and technicians. They engaged in tax collecting, organizing of labor for major public works, and building irrigation systems, [[pyramid]]s, temples, and canals. During the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (2,620\u20132,480 BC), long distance trade was developed, with the [[Levant]] for timber, with Nubia for gold and skins, with [[Land of Punt|Punt]] for [[frankincense]], and also with the western Libyan territories. For most of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]], Egypt developed her fundamental systems, institutions and culture, always through the central bureaucracy and by the divinity of the [[Pharaoh]].<ref>Davidson, Basil (1991), ''Africa In History: Themes and Outlines'', pp. 30\u201333.

By 2,200 BC, the Old Kingdom's stability was undermined by rivalry among the governors of the [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]] who challenged the power of pharaohs and by invasions of Asiatics into the Nile Delta.

Connections with the southern regions of [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], Wawat and Irthet at the second cataract were made stronger. Then came the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]], with the invasion of the [[Hyksos]] on horse-drawn [[chariot]]s and utilizing bronze weapons, a technology heretofore unseen in Egypt. Horse-drawn chariots soon spread to the west in the inhabitable Sahara and North Africa. The Hyksos failed to hold on to their Egyptian territories and were absorbed by Egyptian society. This eventually led to one of Egypt's most powerful phases, the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] (1,580\u20131,080 BC), with the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]]. Egypt became a [[superpower]] controlling Nubia and [[Judea]] while exerting political influence on the Libyans to the West and on the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33\"/>\n\nAs before, the New Kingdom ended with invasion from the west by Libyan princes, leading to the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]].

It ruled for two centuries.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33\"/>\n\nTo the south, Nubian independence and strength was being reasserted. This reassertion led to the conquest of Egypt by Nubia, begun by [[Kashta]] and completed by [[Piye]] (Pianhky, 751\u2013730 BC) and [[Shabaka]] (716\u2013695 BC). This was the birth of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]]. The Nubians tried to re-establish Egyptian traditions and customs. They ruled Egypt for a hundred years. This was ended by an [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] invasion, with [[Taharqa]] experiencing the full might of Assyrian iron weapons.

It lasted until 525 BC, when Egypt was invaded by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]]. Unlike the Assyrians, the Persians stayed. In 332, Egypt was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]].

Around the latter part of the third millennium, there was further consolidation of the sacral kingdoms.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Two kingdoms in particular emerged: the Sai kingdom, immediately south of Egypt, and the [[Kingdom of Kerma]] at the third cataract. Sometime around the 18th century BC, the Kingdom of Kerma conquered the Kingdom of Sai, becoming a serious rival to Egypt. Kerma occupied a territory from the first cataract to the confluence of the [[Blue Nile]], [[White Nile]], and [[Atbarah River]]. About 1,575 to 1,550 BC, during the latter part of the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth Dynasty]], the Kingdom of Kerma invaded Egypt.<ref>Alberge, Dalya. \"Tomb Reveals Ancient Egypt's Humiliating Secret\", ''The Times'' {London}, 28 July 2003.</ref> The Kingdom of Kerma allied itself with the [[Hyksos]] invasion of Egypt.<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 148\u2013151.</ref>\n\nEgypt eventually re-energized under the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] and conquered the Kingdom of Kerma or [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], ruling it for almost 500 years. The Kushites were Egyptianized during this period. By 1100 BC, the Egyptians had withdrawn from Kush. The region regained independence and reasserted its culture. Kush built a new religion around [[Amun]] and made [[Napata]] its spiritual center. In 730 BC, the Kingdom of Kush invaded Egypt, taking over [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and beginning the Nubian Empire. The empire extended from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to the confluence of the Blue Nile, the White Nile, and River Atbara.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 40\u201341.</ref>\n\nIn 760 BC, the Kushites were expelled from Egypt by iron-wielding [[Assyria]]ns. Later, the administrative capital was moved from Napata to [[Mer\u00f6e]], developing a new Nubian culture. Initially, Meroites were highly Egyptianized, but they subsequently began to take on distinctive features. Nubia became a center of iron-making and cotton cloth manufacturing. Egyptian writing was replaced by the [[Meroitic alphabet]]. The lion god [[Apedemak]] was added to the Egyptian pantheon of gods. Trade links to the [[Red Sea]] increased, linking Nubia with Mediterranean [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. Its architecture and art diversified, with pictures of lions, ostriches, giraffes, and elephants. Eventually, with the rise of [[Aksum]], Nubia's trade links were broken and it suffered environmental degradation from the tree cutting required for iron production.

They began to populate the North African coast with settlements{{mdash}}trading and mixing with the native Berber population. In 814 BC, Phoenicians from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] established the city of [[Carthage]]. By 600 BC, Carthage had become a major trading entity and power in the Mediterranean, largely through trade with tropical Africa. Carthage's prosperity fostered the growth of the Berber kingdoms, [[Numidia]] and [[Mauretania]]. Around 500 BC, Carthage provided a strong impetus for trade with [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Berber middlemen, who had maintained contacts with Sub-Saharan Africa since the desert had desiccated, utilized pack animals to transfer products from oasis to oasis. Danger lurked from the [[Garamantes]] of [[Fes|Fez]], who raided caravans.

Carthage fought the [[Punic Wars]], three wars with Rome: the [[First Punic War]] (264 to 241 BC), over [[Sicily]]; the [[Second Punic War]] (218 to 201 BC), in which [[Hannibal]] invaded Europe; and the [[Third Punic War]] (149 to 146 BC). Carthage lost the first two wars, and in the third it was destroyed, becoming the [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman province of Africa]], with the Berber Kingdom of Numidia assisting Rome. The Roman province of Africa became a major agricultural supplier of wheat, [[olive]]s, and [[olive oil]] to [[Roman Empire|imperial Rome]] via exorbitant taxation. Two centuries later, Rome brought the Berber kingdoms of Numidia and Mauretania under its authority. In the 420's AD, [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]] invaded North Africa and Rome lost her territories.

[[Berber people|Berber]] civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others. By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed one of the largest element, with Gauls, of the Carthaginian army.\n\nIn the [[Mercenary War]] (241-238 BC), a rebellion was instigated by mercenary soldiers of Carthage and African allies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dcc.dickinson.edu/nepos-hannibal/first-punic-war|title=The First Punic War {{!}} Dickinson College Commentaries|website=dcc.dickinson.edu|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> Berber soldiers participated after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]]. Berbers succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]]; in 146 BC the city of Carthage was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay Mauretania, which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the [[Almohad]]s and [[Almoravid dynasty]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC. After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times.

The towns also suffered economic difficulties, and building activity almost ceased.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe towns of Roman North Africa had a substantial [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Jewish population]]. Some Jews had been deported from [[Judea]] or [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD for rebelling against Roman rule; others had come earlier with [[Punics|Punic]] settlers. In addition, a number of Berber tribes had converted to [[Judaism]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nChristianity arrived in the 2nd century and soon gained converts in the towns and among slaves. More than eighty bishops, some from distant frontier regions of Numidia, attended the [[Council of Carthage (256)]] in 256.

The Donatists stressed the holiness of the church and refused to accept the authority to administer the sacraments of those who had surrendered the scriptures when they were forbidden under the Emperor [[Diocletian]] (reigned 284\u2013305). The Donatists also opposed the involvement of [[Constantine the Great]] (reigned 306\u2013337) in church affairs in contrast to the majority of Christians who welcomed official imperial recognition.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe occasionally violent Donatist controversy has been characterized{{by whom|date=December 2013}} as a struggle between opponents and supporters of the Roman system. The most articulate North African critic of the Donatist position, which came to be called a heresy, was [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], bishop of [[Hippo Regius]]. Augustine maintained that the unworthiness of a minister did not affect the validity of the sacraments because their true minister was [[Jesus]] [[Christ]]. In his sermons and books Augustine, who is considered a leading exponent of Christian dogma, evolved a theory of the right of orthodox Christian rulers to use force against schismatics and heretics. Although the dispute was resolved by a decision of an imperial commission in Carthage in 411, Donatist communities continued to exist as late as the 6th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA decline in trade weakened Roman control.

Local opposition delayed full Byzantine control of the region for twelve years, however, and when imperial control came, it was but a shadow of the control exercised by Rome. Although an impressive series of fortifications were built, Byzantine rule was compromised by official corruption, incompetence, military weakness, and lack of concern in Constantinople for African affairs, which made it an easy target for the Arabs during the [[Early Muslim conquests]] .

D'mt traded through the [[Red Sea]] with Egypt and the Mediterranean, providing frankincense. By the 5th and 3rd centuries, D'mt had declined, and several successor states took its place. Later there was greater trade with [[South Arabia]], mainly with the port of [[Sabaeans|Saba]]. [[Adulis]] became an important commercial center in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. The interaction of the peoples in the two regions, the southern Arabia [[Sabaeans]] and the northern Ethiopians, resulted in the [[Ge'ez]] culture and language and eventual development of the [[Ge'ez script]]. Trade links increased and expanded from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, with Egypt, Israel, Phoenicia, Greece, and Rome, to the Black Sea, and to Persia, India, and China. Aksum was known throughout those lands. By the 5th century BC, the region was very prosperous, exporting ivory, hippopotamus hides, gold dust, spices, and live elephants. It imported silver, gold, olive oil, and wine. Aksum manufactured glass crystal, brass, and copper for export. A powerful Aksum emerged, unifying parts of eastern Sudan, northern Ethiopia ([[Tigray Region|Tigre]]), and [[Eritrea]]. Its kings built stone palatial buildings and were buried under megalithic monuments. By 300 AD, Aksum was minting its own coins in silver and gold.<ref>Collins, Robert O., and James M.

A new centralized political system of spiritual kings (''balopwe'') with a court council of head governors and sub-heads all the way to village heads.

The authority of the ''balopwe'' resided in his spiritual power rather than his military authority. The army was relatively small. The Luba was able to control regional trade and collect tribute for redistribution. Numerous offshoot states were formed with founders claiming descent from the Luba.

The capital was [[M'banza-Kongo]]. With superior organization, they were able to conquer their neighbors and extract tribute. They were experts in metalwork, pottery, and weaving raffia cloth. They stimulated interregional trade via a tribute system controlled by the ''manikongo''. Later, [[maize]] (corn) and [[cassava]] (manioc) would be introduced to the region via trade with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] at their ports at [[Luanda]] and [[Benguela]]. The maize and cassava would result in population growth in the region and other parts of Africa, replacing [[millet]] as a main staple.<ref>Jevan Cherniwchana and Juan Moreno-Cruz, \"Maize and Precolonial Africa\", ''Journal of Development Economics'' 136 (January 2019), 137-150. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.10.008</ref>\n[[File:KingdomKongo1711.png|thumb|right|240px|Kongo in 1711]]\n\nBy the 16th century, the ''manikongo'' held authority from the Atlantic in the west to the [[Kwango River]] in the east.

Slave trading increased with Afonso's wars of conquest. About 1568 to 1569, the [[Jaga (people)|Jaga]] invaded Kongo, laying waste to the kingdom and forcing the ''manikongo'' into exile. In 1574, Manikongo [[\u00c1lvaro I of Kongo|\u00c1lvaro I]] was reinstated with the help of Portuguese mercenaries. During the latter part of the 1660s, the Portuguese tried to gain control of Kongo. Manikongo [[Ant\u00f3nio I of Kongo|Ant\u00f3nio I]] (1661\u20131665), with a Kongolese army of 5,000, was destroyed by an army of Afro-Portuguese at the [[Battle of Mbwila]].

Ndongo was ruled by the ''ngola''. Ndongo would also engage in slave trading with the Portuguese, with [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]] being a transit point to Brazil. The kingdom was not as welcoming as Kongo; it viewed the Portuguese with great suspicion and as an enemy. The Portuguese in the latter part of the 16th century tried to gain control of Ndongo but were defeated by the [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]]. Ndongo experienced depopulation from slave raiding. The leaders established another state at [[Kingdom of Matamba|Matamba]], affiliated with [[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba|Queen Nzinga]], who put up a strong resistance to the Portuguese until coming to terms with them. The Portuguese settled along the coast as trade dealers, not venturing on conquest of the interior. Slavery wreaked havoc in the interior, with states initiating wars of conquest for captives.

Conflict arose as to who should be the successor of the prophet. The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] had initially taken control of the [[Caliphate]], with their capital at [[Damascus]]. Later, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] had taken control, moving the capital to [[Baghdad]]. The [[Berber people]], being independent in spirit and hostile to outside interference in their affairs and to [[Arab]] exclusivity in orthodox Islam, adopted [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] and [[Kharijites|Kharijite]] Islam, both considered unorthodox and hostile to the authority of the Abbasid Caliphate. Numerous Kharijite kingdoms came and fell during the 8th and 9th centuries, asserting their independence from Baghdad. In the early 10th century, Shi'ite groups from Syria, claiming descent from Muhammad's daughter [[Fatimah]], founded the [[Fatimid Dynasty]] in the [[Maghreb]]. By 950, they had conquered all of the Maghreb and by 969 all of Egypt. They had immediately broken away from Baghdad.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to bring about a purer form of Islam among the [[Zenaga people|Sanhaja]] Berbers, [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] founded the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] movement in present-day [[Mauritania]] and [[Western Sahara]]. The Sanhaja Berbers, like the [[Soninke people|Soninke]], practiced an indigenous religion alongside Islam. Abdallah ibn Yasin found ready converts in the [[Lamtuna]] Sanhaja, who were dominated by the Soninke in the south and the [[Zenata]] Berbers in the north. By the 1040s, all of the Lamtuna was converted to the Almoravid movement. With the help of Yahya ibn Umar and his brother [[Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar|Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], the sons of the Lamtuna chief, the Almoravids created an empire extending from the Sahel to the Mediterranean. After the death of Abdallah ibn Yassin and Yahya ibn Umar, Abu Bakr split the empire in half, between himself and [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], because it was too big to be ruled by one individual. Abu Bakr took the south to continue fighting the Soninke, and Yusuf ibn Tashfin took the north, expanding it to southern Spain. The death of Abu Bakr in 1087 saw a breakdown of unity and increase military dissension in the south. This caused a re-expansion of the Soninke. The Almoravids were once held responsible for bringing down the [[Ghana Empire]] in 1076, but this view is no longer credited.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005). p 90.</ref>\n\n[[File:Safi minaret.png|thumb|left|250px|The Almohad minaret in Safi]]\n\nDuring the 10th through 13th centuries, there was a large-scale movement of [[bedouin]]s out of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. About 1050, a quarter of a million Arab nomads from Egypt moved into the Maghreb. Those following the northern coast were referred to as [[Banu Hilal]]. Those going south of the [[Atlas Mountains]] were the [[Banu Sulaym]]. This movement spread the use of the [[Arabic language]] and hastened the decline of the [[Berber languages|Berber language]] and the [[Arabization|Arabisation]] of North Africa. Later an Arabised Berber group, the Hawwara, went south to Nubia via Egypt.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 156\u2013157</ref>\n\nIn the 1140s, [[Abd al-Mu'min]] declared [[jihad]] on the [[Almoravids]], charging them with decadence and corruption. He united the northern Berbers against the Almoravids, overthrowing them and forming the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohad]] Empire. During this period, the Maghreb became thoroughly [[Islamization|Islamised]] and saw the spread of [[literacy]], the development of [[algebra]], and the use of the number [[0 (number)|zero]] and [[decimal]]s. By the 13th century, the Almohad states had split into three rival states. Muslim states were largely extinguished in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]. Around 1415, Portugal engaged in a ''[[reconquista]]'' of North Africa by capturing [[Ceuta]], and in later centuries Spain and Portugal acquired other ports on the North African coast. In 1492, at the end of the [[Granada War]], Spain defeated Muslims in the [[Emirate of Granada]], effectively ending eight centuries of Muslim domination in southern Iberia.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 88\u201392.</ref>\n\nPortugal and Spain took the ports of [[Tangiers]], [[Algiers]], [[Tripoli]], and [[Tunis]]. This put them in direct competition with the [[Ottoman Empire]], which re-took the ports using Turkish corsairs ([[Piracy|pirates]] and [[privateer]]s). The Turkish corsairs would use the ports for raiding Christian ships, a major source of booty for the towns. Technically, North Africa was under the control of the Ottoman Empire, but only the coastal towns were fully under [[Istanbul]]'s control. Tripoli benefited from trade with [[Borno State|Borno]]. The [[pashas]] of Tripoli traded horses, firearms, and armor via Fez with the sultans of the [[Bornu Empire]] for slaves.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 166\u2013167</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, an Arab nomad tribe that claimed descent from Muhammad's daughter, the [[Saadi dynasty|Saadis]], conquered and united [[Morocco]]. They prevented the Ottoman Empire from reaching to the Atlantic and expelled Portugal from Morocco's western coast. [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] brought the state to the height of its power. He invaded [[Songhai Empire|Songhay]] in 1591, to control the gold trade, which had been diverted to the western coast of Africa for European ships and to the east, to Tunis. Morocco's hold on Songhay diminished in the 17th century. In 1603, after Ahmad's death, the kingdom split into the two sultanates of [[Fes]] and [[Marrakesh]]. Later it was reunited by [[Al-Rashid of Morocco|Moulay al-Rashid]], founder of the [[Alaouite Dynasty]] (1672\u20131727). His brother and successor, [[Ismail ibn Sharif]] (1672\u20131727), strengthened the unity of the country by importing slaves from the Sudan to build up the military.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 167\u2013168.</ref>\n\n====Nile Valley====\n{{See|Nile#History}}\n\n=====Egypt=====\n{{Main|History of Egypt#Arab and Ottoman Egypt (641\u20131882)}}\n{{Further|Lists of rulers of Egypt}}\n[[File:Fatimid Caliphate.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Fatimid Caliphate]]\n\nIn 642 AD, the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] conquered [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Byzantine Egypt]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005 pp. 65-67\"/>\n\nEgypt under the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] was prosperous. Dams and canals were repaired, and wheat, barley, flax, and cotton production increased. Egypt became a major producer of linen and cotton cloth. Its Mediterranean and Red Sea trade increased. Egypt also minted a gold currency called the Fatimid dinar, which was used for international trade. The bulk of revenues came from taxing the [[fellah]]in ([[peasant]] farmers), and taxes were high. Tax collecting was leased to [[Berber people|Berber]] overlords, who were soldiers who had taken part in the Fatimid conquest in 969 AD. The overlords paid a share to the caliphs and retained what was left. Eventually, they became landlords and constituted a settled land aristocracy.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), p. 157.</ref>\n\nTo fill the military ranks, [[Mamluk]] Turkish slave cavalry and Sudanese slave infantry were used. Berber freemen were also recruited. In the 1150s, tax revenues from farms diminished. The soldiers revolted and wreaked havoc in the countryside, slowed trade, and diminished the power and authority of the Fatimid caliphs.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 158.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1160s, Fatimid Egypt came under threat from [[Crusades|European crusaders]]. Out of this threat, a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] general named [[Saladin|\u1e62al\u0101\u1e25 ad-D\u012bn Y\u016bsuf ibn Ayy\u016bb]] (Saladin), with a small band of professional soldiers, emerged as an outstanding Muslim defender. Saladin defeated the Christian crusaders at Egypt's borders and [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|recaptured Jerusalem]] in 1187. On the death of [[Al-Adid]], the last Fatimid caliph, in 1171, Saladin became the ruler of Egypt, ushering in the [[Ayyubid Dynasty]]. Under his rule, Egypt returned to [[Sunni Islam]], [[Cairo]] became an important center of Arab Islamic learning, and Mamluk slaves were increasingly recruited from Turkey and southern Russia for military service. Support for the military was tied to the ''iqta'', a form of land taxation in which soldiers were given ownership in return for military service.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 158\u2013159</ref>\n\nOver time, Mamluk slave soldiers became a very powerful [[landed nobility|landed aristocracy]], to the point of getting rid of the Ayyubid dynasty in 1250 and establishing a [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk dynasty]]. The more powerful Mamluks were referred to as ''[[Emir|amirs]]''. For 250 years, Mamluks controlled all of Egypt under a military dictatorship. Egypt extended her territories to Syria and Palestine, thwarted the crusaders, and halted a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion in 1260 at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]]. Mamluk Egypt came to be viewed as a protector of Islam, and of [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]]. Eventually the ''iqta'' system declined and proved unreliable for providing an adequate military. The Mamluks started viewing their ''iqta'' as hereditary and became attuned to urban living. Farm production declined, and dams and canals lapsed into disrepair. Mamluk military skill and technology did not keep pace with new technology of [[handgun]]s and [[cannon]]s.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 159\u2013161.</ref>\n\nWith the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Egypt was easily defeated. In 1517, at the end of an [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War]], Egypt became part of the Ottoman Empire. The [[Istanbul]] government revived the ''iqta'' system. Trade was reestablished in the Red Sea, but it could not completely connect with the [[Indian Ocean]] trade because of growing Portuguese presence. During the 17th and 18th centuries, hereditary Mamluks regained power. The leading Mamluks were referred to as ''[[bey]]s''. [[Pasha]]s, or viceroys, represented the Istanbul government in name only, operating independently. During the 18th century, dynasties of pashas became established. The government was weak and corrupt.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 161.</ref>\n\nIn 1798, [[Napoleon]] [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invaded Egypt]]. The local forces had little ability to resist the French conquest. However, the [[British Empire]] and the Ottoman Empire were able to remove French occupation in 1801. These events marked the beginning of a 19th-century Anglo-Franco rivalry over Egypt.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 162.</ref>\n\n=====Sudan=====\n{{Main|History of Sudan}}\n\n====Christian and Islamic Nubia====\n{{Main|Nubia#Christian Nubia|Nubia#Islamic Nubia}}\n{{Further|List of rulers of Makuria}}\n[[File:Christian Nubia.png|thumb|right|250px|Christian Nubia and the Nile [[cataract]]s]]\nAfter [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana of Aksum]] sacked [[Meroe]], people associated with the site of [[Ballana]] moved into [[Nubia]] from the southwest and founded three kingdoms: [[Kingdom of Makuria|Makuria]], [[Nobatia]], and [[Alodia]]. They would rule for 200 years. Makuria was above the [[Cataracts of the Nile|third cataract]], along the Dongola Reach with its capital at [[Dongola]]. Nobadia was to the north with its capital at [[Faras]], and [[Alodia]] was to the south with its capital at [[Soba (city)|Soba]]. Makuria eventually absorbed Nobadia. The people of the region converted to [[Monophysitism|Monophysite Christianity]] around 500 to 600 CE. The church initially started writing in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], then in [[Greek language|Greek]], and finally in [[Old Nubian language|Old Nubian]], a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] language. The church was aligned with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Coptic Church]].<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 67</ref><ref>Ehret (2002), p. 305.</ref>\n\nBy 641, [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt was conquered]] by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. This effectively blocked Christian Nubia and Aksum from Mediterranean Christendom. In 651\u2013652, Arabs from Egypt invaded Christian Nubia. Nubian archers soundly defeated the invaders. The [[Bakt|Baqt (or Bakt) Treaty]] was drawn, recognizing Christian Nubia and regulating trade. The treaty controlled relations between Christian Nubia and Islamic Egypt for almost six hundred years.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 77.</ref>\n\nBy the 13th century, Christian Nubia began its decline. The authority of the monarchy was diminished by the church and nobility. Arab [[bedouin]] tribes began to infiltrate Nubia, causing further havoc. ''[[Fakir]]s'' (holy men) practicing [[Sufism]] introduced Islam into Nubia. By 1366, Nubia had become divided into petty fiefdoms when it was invaded by [[Mamluk]]s. During the 15th century, Nubia was open to Arab immigration. Arab nomads intermingled with the population and introduced the [[Arab culture]] and the [[Arabic]] language. By the 16th century, [[Makuria]] and [[Nobadia]] had been [[Islamization|Islamized]]. During the 16th century, Abdallah Jamma headed an Arab confederation that destroyed Soba, capital of Alodia, the last holdout of Christian Nubia. Later Alodia would fall under the [[Sennar (sultanate)|Funj Sultanate]].<ref>Collins and Burns 2007, p. 77.</ref>\n\nDuring the 15th century, [[Funj people|Funj]] herders migrated north to [[Alodia]] and occupied it. Between 1504 and 1505, the kingdom expanded, reaching its peak and establishing its capital at [[Sennar]] under [[Badi II|Badi II Abu Daqn]] (c. 1644\u20131680). By the end of the 16th century, the Funj had converted to Islam. They pushed their empire westward to [[Kurdufan|Kordofan]]. They expanded eastward, but were halted by Ethiopia. They controlled Nubia down to the 3rd Cataract. The economy depended on captured enemies to fill the army and on merchants travelling through Sennar. Under [[Badi IV]] (1724\u20131762), the army turned on the king, making him nothing but a figurehead. In 1821, the Funj were conquered by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (1805\u20131849), Pasha of Egypt.<ref>Page, Willie F.(2001).

The state arose in the 12th century CE. Its wealth came from controlling the trade in ivory from the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo Valley]], copper from the mountains of northern [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], and gold from the [[Zimbabwe]] Plateau between the Limpopo and [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] rivers, with the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] merchants at [[Chibuene]]. By the mid-13th century, Mapungubwe was abandoned.<ref>Ehret, Christopher (2002). p. 252.</ref>\n\nAfter the decline of Mapungubwe, [[Great Zimbabwe]] rose on the Zimbabwe Plateau. ''Zimbabwe'' means stone building. Great Zimbabwe was the first city in Southern Africa and was the center of an empire, consolidating lesser [[Shona people|Shona]] polities. Stone building was inherited from Mapungubwe. These building techniques were enhanced and came into maturity at Great Zimbabwe, represented by the wall of the Great Enclosure. The dry-stack stone masonry technology was also used to build smaller compounds in the area. Great Zimbabwe flourished by trading with Swahili Kilwa and [[Sofala]]. The rise of Great Zimbabwe parallels the rise of Kilwa. Great Zimbabwe was a major source of gold. Its royal court lived in luxury, wore Indian cotton, surrounded themselves with copper and gold ornaments, and ate on plates from as far away as Persia and China. Around the 1420s and 1430s, Great Zimbabwe was on decline. The city was abandoned by 1450. Some have attributed the decline to the rise of the trading town [[Ingombe Ilede]].<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 252\u2013254.</ref><ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153\">Shillington (2005), pp. 147\u2013153.</ref>\n\nA new chapter of Shona history ensued. Nyatsimba Mutota, a northern Shona king of the Karanga, engaged in conquest. He and his son Mutope conquered the Zimbabwe Plateau, going through [[Mozambique]] to the east coast, linking the empire to the coastal trade. They called their empire ''Wilayatu 'l Mu'anamutapah'' or ''mwanamutapa'' (Lord of the Plundered Lands), or the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]]. ''Monomotapa'' was the Portuguese corruption. They did not build stone structures; the northern Shonas had no traditions of building in stone. After the death of Matope in 1480, the empire split into two small empires: [[Torwa dynasty|Torwa]] in the south and Mutapa in the north. The split occurred over rivalry from two Shona lords, Changa and Togwa, with the ''mwanamutapa'' line. Changa was able to acquire the south, forming the [[Kingdom of Butua]] with its capital at [[Khami]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153\"/><ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254\">Davidson (1991), pp. 252\u2013254.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa Empire]] continued in the north under the ''mwenemutapa'' line. During the 16th century the Portuguese were able to establish permanent markets up the Zambezi River in an attempt to gain political and military control of Mutapa. They were partially successful. In 1628, a decisive battle allowed them to put a puppet ''mwanamutapa'' named Mavura, who signed treaties that gave favorable mineral export rights to the Portuguese. The Portuguese were successful in destroying the ''mwanamutapa'' system of government and undermining trade. By 1667, Mutapa was in decay. Chiefs would not allow digging for gold because of fear of Portuguese theft, and the population declined.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 252\u2013154.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Butua]] was ruled by a ''changamire'', a title derived from the founder, Changa. Later it became the [[Rozwi Empire]]. The Portuguese tried to gain a foothold but were thrown out of the region in 1693, by Changamire Dombo. The 17th century was a period of peace and prosperity. The Rozwi Empire fell into ruins in the 1830s from invading [[Nguni people|Nguni]] from [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal]].<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254\"/>\n\n====Namibia====\n{{Main|History of Namibia}}\n[[File:Realnam.JPG|thumb|250px|Herero and Nama territories]]\nBy 1500 AD, most of southern Africa had established states. In northwestern [[Namibia]], the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]] engaged in farming and the [[Herero people|Herero]] engaged in herding. As cattle numbers increased, the Herero moved southward to central Namibia for grazing land. A related group, the [[Mbanderu people|Ovambanderu]], expanded to [[Ghanzi]] in northwestern [[Botswana]]. The [[Nama people|Nama]], a [[Khoisan languages|Khoi-speaking]], sheep-raising group, moved northward and came into contact with the Herero; this would set the stage for much conflict between the two groups. The expanding [[Lozi people|Lozi]] states pushed the [[Mbukushu]], [[Kuhane language|Subiya]], and Yei to Botei, [[Kavango Region|Okavango]], and [[Chobe District|Chobe]] in northern Botswana.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 218.</ref>\n\n====South Africa and Botswana====\n{{Main|Early history of South Africa|History of South Africa|History of Botswana}}\n\n=====Sotho\u2013Tswana=====\nThe development of [[Sotho\u2013Tswana peoples|Sotho\u2013Tswana]] states based on the [[highveld]], south of the [[Limpopo River]], began around 1000 CE. The chief's power rested on cattle and his connection to the ancestor. This can be seen in the [[Toutswemogala Hill]] settlements with stone foundations and stone walls, north of the highveld and south of the [[Vaal River]]. Northwest of the Vaal River developed early [[Tswana people|Tswana]] states centered on towns of thousands of people. When disagreements or rivalry arose, different groups moved to form their own states.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\">Shillington (2005), pp. 153\u2013155.</ref>\n\n=====Nguni peoples=====\n[[File:Realzulu.JPG|thumb|250px|South African ethnic groups]]\nSoutheast of the [[Drakensberg]] mountains lived [[Nguni languages|Nguni-speaking]] peoples ([[Zulu people|Zulu]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], [[Swazi people|Swazi]], and [[South Ndebele people|Ndebele]]). They too engaged in state building, with new states developing from rivalry, disagreements, and population pressure causing movement into new regions. This 19th-century process of warfare, state building and migration later became known as the Mfecane (Nguni) or Difaqane (Sotho). Its major catalyst was the consolidation of the [[Zulu Kingdom]].<ref>Worden, Nigel. The Making of Modern South Africa, Oxford UK/Cambridge USA: Blackwell Publishers, 1995, p. 13.</ref> They were metalworkers, cultivators of millet, and cattle herders.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\"/>\n\n=====Khoisan and Boers=====\n[[File:SouthAfrica1885.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Political map of Southern Africa in 1885]]\nThe [[Khoisan]] lived in the southwestern [[Cape Province]], where winter rainfall is plentiful. Earlier Khoisan populations were absorbed by [[Bantu peoples]], such as the [[Sotho people|Sotho]] and [[Nguni people|Nguni]], but the [[Bantu expansion]] stopped at the region with winter rainfall. Some [[Bantu languages]] have incorporated the [[click consonant]] of the [[Khoisan languages]]. The Khoisan traded with their Bantu neighbors, providing cattle, sheep, and hunted items. In return, their Bantu speaking neighbors traded copper, iron, and tobacco.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\"/>\n\nBy the 16th century, the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a replenishing station at [[Table Bay]] for restocking water and purchasing meat from the [[Khoikhoi]]. The Khoikhoi received copper, iron, tobacco, and beads in exchange. In order to control the price of meat and stock and make service more consistent, the Dutch established a permanent settlement at Table Bay in 1652. They grew fresh fruit and vegetables and established a hospital for sick sailors. To increase produce, the Dutch decided to increase the number of farms at Table Bay by encouraging freeburgher ''[[boer]]s'' (farmers) on lands worked initially by slaves from West Africa. The land was taken from Khoikhoi grazing land, triggering the first [[Khoikhoi-Dutch Wars|Khoikhoi-Dutch war]] in 1659. No victors emerged, but the Dutch assumed a \"[[right of conquest]]\" by which they claimed all of the cape. In a series of wars pitting the Khoikhoi against each other, the Boers assumed all Khoikhoi land and claimed all their cattle. The second Khoikoi-Dutch war (1673\u20131677) was a cattle raid. The Khoikhoi also died in thousands from European diseases.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 210\u2013213.</ref>\n\nBy the 18th century, the cape colony had grown, with slaves coming from [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Indonesia]]. The settlement also started to expand northward, but Khoikhoi resistance, raids, and [[guerrilla warfare]] slowed the expansion during the 18th century. Boers who started to practice pastoralism were known as ''[[trekboer]]s''. A common source of ''trekboer'' labor was orphan children who were captured during raids and whose parents had been killed.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 213\u2013214.</ref>\n\n===Southeast Africa===\n{{Main|Southeast Africa#History}}\n\n====Prehistory====\nAccording to the theory of [[recent African origin of modern humans]], the mainstream position held within the scientific community, all humans originate from either [[Southeast Africa]] or the [[Horn of Africa]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Hua|last2=Prugnolle|first2=Franck|last3=Manica|first3=Andrea|authorlink4=Francois Balloux|last4=Balloux|first4=Fran\u00e7ois|title=A Geographically Explicit Genetic Model of Worldwide Human-Settlement History|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|date=August 2006|volume=79|issue=2|pages=230\u2013237|doi=10.1086/505436|pmid=16826514|pmc=1559480}}</ref> During the first millennium CE, [[Nilotic]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples [[Bantu expansion|moved into the region]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n====Swahili coast====\n{{Main|Swahili coast#History}}\n[[File:Swahili door Zanzibar.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A traditional Zanzibari-style [[Swahili people|Swahili]] coast door in [[Zanzibar]].]]\nFollowing the Bantu Migration, on the coastal section of Southeast Africa, a mixed Bantu community developed through contact with [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] traders, leading to the development of the mixed Arab, Persian and African [[Swahili Coast|Swahili City States]].<ref>{{cite book|author=James De Vere Allen|title=Swahili origins: Swahili culture & the Shungwaya phenomenon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_D5yAAAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=J.

The culture's earliest dated artifacts are located in the [[Kagera Region]] of [[Tanzania]], and it extended as far west as the [[Kivu]] region of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], as far east as the [[Nyanza Province|Nyanza]] and [[Western Province (Kenya)|Western]] provinces of [[Kenya]], and north into [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]. Sites from the Urewe culture date from the Early Iron Age, from the 5th century BC to the 6th century AD.\n\nThe origins of the Urewe culture are ultimately in the [[Bantu expansion]] originating in Cameroon. Research into early Iron Age civilizations in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] has been undertaken concurrently with studies on African linguistics on Bantu expansion. The Urewe culture may correspond to the Eastern subfamily of Bantu languages, spoken by the descendants of the first wave of Bantu peoples to settle East Africa. At first sight, Urewe seems to be a fully developed civilization recognizable through its distinctive, stylish earthenware and highly technical and sophisticated iron working techniques. Given our current level of knowledge, neither seems to have developed or altered for nearly 2,000 years. However, minor local variations in the ceramic ware can be observed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nUrewe is the name of the site in Kenya brought to prominence through the publication in 1948 of [[Mary Leakey]]'s archaeological findings.

The Austronesians introduced [[banana]] and [[rice]] cultivation, and the Bantu speakers introduced cattle and other farming practices. About the year 1000, Arab and Indian trade settlement were started in northern Madagascar to exploit the Indian Ocean trade.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 135.</ref> By the 14th century, [[Islam]] was introduced on the island by traders.

[[Radama I of Madagascar|Radama I]] (1810\u20131828) invited Christian [[Missionary|missionaries]] in the early 19th century. Queen [[Ranavalona I]] \"the Cruel\" (1828\u20131861) banned the practice of [[Christianity]] in the kingdom, and an estimated 150,000 Christians perished. Under [[Radama II of Madagascar|Radama II]] (1861\u20131863), Madagascar took a French orientation, with great commercial concession given to the French. In 1895, in the second [[Franco-Hova War]], the French invaded Madagascar, taking over [[Antsiranana]] (Diego Suarez) and declaring Madagascar a [[protectorate]].<ref name=\"Lye, Keith2002. pp. 242,243\"/>\n\n====Lake Plateau states and empires====\n{{Main|History of Buganda|Karagwe District#History}}\nBetween the 14th and 15th centuries, large Southeast African kingdoms and states emerged, such as the [[Buganda]]<ref name=\"Roland Oliver 1800. pp. 24-25\">Roland Oliver, et al. \"Africa South of the Equator\", in Africa Since 1800.

Cattle herding, cereal growing, and banana cultivation were the economic mainstays of these states. The [[Ntusi]] and [[Bigo]] earthworks are representative of one of the first states, the [[Bunyoro kingdom]], which oral tradition stipulates was part of the [[Empire of Kitara]] that dominated the whole Lakes region. A [[Luo peoples|Luo]] ethnic elite, from the Bito clan, ruled over the [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking]] [[Nyoro people]].

Kato Kintu may have migrated to the northwest of [[Lake Victoria]] as early as 1000 BC. Buganda was ruled by the ''[[Kabaka of Buganda|kabaka]]'' with a ''bataka'' composed of the clan heads. Over time, the ''kabakas'' diluted the authority of the ''bataka'', with Buganda becoming a centralized monarchy. By the 16th century, Buganda was engaged in expansion but had a serious rival in [[Bunyoro]]. By the 1870s, Buganda was a wealthy nation-state. The ''kabaka'' ruled with his ''Lukiko'' (council of ministers). Buganda had a naval fleet of a hundred vessels, each manned by thirty men. Buganda supplanted Bunyoro as the most important state in the region. However, by the early 20th century, Buganda became a province of the British [[Uganda Protectorate]].<ref>Lye, Keith (2002). pp. 121\u2013122.</ref>\n\n=====Rwanda=====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Rwanda#Pre-colonization}}\nSoutheast of Bunyoro, near [[Lake Kivu]] at the bottom of the western rift, the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]] was founded, perhaps during the 17th century. [[Tutsi]] (BaTutsi) pastoralists formed the elite, with a king called the ''[[mwami]]''. The [[Hutu]] (BaHutu) were farmers. Both groups spoke the same language, but there were strict social norms against marrying each other and interaction. According to oral tradition, the Kingdom of Rwanda was founded by Mwami Ruganzu II (Ruganzu Ndori) (c. 1600\u20131624), with his capital near [[Kigali]]. It took 200 years to attain a truly centralized kingdom under Mwami [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli IV]] (Kigeri Rwabugiri) (1840\u20131895). Subjugation of the Hutu proved more difficult than subduing the Tutsi. The last Tutsi chief gave up to Mwami [[Mutara II of Rwanda|Mutara II]] (Mutara Rwogera) (1802\u20131853) in 1852, but the last Hutu holdout was conquered in the 1920s by Mwami [[Yuhi V of Rwanda|Yuhi V]] (Yuli Musinga) (1896\u20131931).<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 123\u2013124.</ref>\n\n=====Burundi=====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Burundi#History}}\n{{Further|List of Kings of Burundi}}\nSouth of the Kingdom of Rwanda was the [[Burundian monarchy|Kingdom of Burundi]]. It was founded by the Tutsi chief [[Ntare I Kivimira Savuyimba Semunganzashamba Rushatsi Cambarantama|Ntare Rushatsi]] (c. 1657\u20131705). Like Rwanda, Burundi was built on cattle raised by Tutsi pastoralists, crops from Hutu farmers, conquest, and political innovations. Under Mwami [[Ntare IV Rutaganzwa Rugamba|Ntare Rugaamba]] (c. 1795\u20131852), Burundi pursued an aggressive expansionist policy, one based more on diplomacy than force.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 124.</ref>\n\n====Maravi====\n{{Main|Maravi}}\n[[File:Maravi Kingdom map c. 1650s.svg|thumb|right|120px|Maravi Kingdom]]\nThe [[Maravi]] claimed descent from Karonga (''kalonga''), who took that title as king. The Maravi connected Central Africa to the east coastal trade, with [[Swahili people|Swahili]] Kilwa. By the 17th century, the Maravi Empire encompassed all the area between [[Lake Malawi]] and the mouth of the [[Zambezi River]]. The ''karonga'' was Mzura, who did much to extend the empire. Mzura made a pact with the Portuguese to establish a 4,000-man army to attack the [[Shona people|Shona]] in return for aid in defeating his rival Lundi, a chief of the Zimba. In 1623, he turned on the Portuguese and assisted the Shona. In 1640, he welcomed back the Portuguese for trade. The Maravi Empire did not long survive the death of Mzura. By the 18th century, it had broken into its previous polities.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 164\u2013165.</ref>\n\n===West Africa===\n{{Main|History of West Africa}}\n\n====Sahelian empires & states====\n{{Main|Sahelian kingdoms#History of Sahel kingdoms}}\n\n=====Ghana=====\n{{Main|Ghana Empire#Origin}}\n{{see also|Serer history}}\n[[File:Ghana empire map.png|thumb|right|250px|Ghana at its greatest extent]]\nThe [[Ghana Empire]] may have been an established kingdom as early as the 8th century AD, founded among the [[Soninke people|Soninke]] by Dinge Cisse. Ghana was first mentioned by Arab geographer [[Al-Farazi]] in the late 8th century. Ghana was inhabited by urban dwellers and rural farmers. The urban dwellers were the administrators of the empire, who were Muslims, and the ''Ghana'' (king), who practiced traditional religion. Two towns existed, one where the Muslim administrators and Berber-Arabs lived, which was connected by a stone-paved road to the king's residence. The rural dwellers lived in villages, which joined together into broader polities that pledged loyalty to the ''Ghana.'' The ''Ghana'' was viewed as divine, and his physical well-being reflected on the whole society. Ghana converted to [[Islam]] around 1050, after conquering [[Aoudaghost]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 80\u201385.</ref>\n\nThe Ghana Empire grew wealthy by taxing the [[trans-Saharan trade]] that linked [[Tiaret]] and [[Sijilmasa]] to Aoudaghost. Ghana controlled access to the goldfields of [[Bambouk]], southeast of [[Koumbi Saleh]]. A percentage of salt and gold going through its territory was taken. The empire was not involved in production.<ref>Iliffe, John(2007). pp. 51\u201353.</ref>\n\nBy the 11th century, Ghana was in decline. It was once thought that the sacking of Koumbi Saleh by Berbers under the [[Almoravid dynasty]] in 1076 was the cause. This is no longer accepted. Several alternative explanations are cited. One important reason is the transfer of the gold trade east to the [[Niger River]] and the [[Taghaza]] Trail, and Ghana's consequent economic decline. Another reason cited is political instability through rivalry among the different hereditary polities.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 83.</ref>\nThe empire came to an end in 1230, when [[Takrur]] in northern [[Senegal]] took over the capital.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 173\u2013174\">Davidson (1991), pp. 173\u2013174.</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter1.shtml The Story of Africa| BBC World Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n=====Mali=====\n{{Main|Mali Empire#Pre-imperial Mali}}\n{{Further|Keita Dynasty}}\n[[File:MALI empire map.PNG|thumb|250px|Mali Empire at its greatest extent]]\nThe [[Mali Empire]] began in the 13th century AD, when a [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mande]] (Mandingo) leader, [[Sundiata Keita|Sundiata]] (Lord Lion) of the Keita clan, defeated [[Soumaoro Kant\u00e9]], king of the [[Susu people|Sosso]] or southern [[Soninke people|Soninke]], at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in c. 1235. Sundiata continued his conquest from the fertile forests and Niger Valley, east to the Niger Bend, north into the Sahara, and west to the Atlantic Ocean, absorbing the remains of the Ghana Empire. Sundiata took on the title of ''[[Mansa (title)|mansa]]''. He established the capital of his empire at [[Niani, Mali|Niani]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nAlthough the salt and gold trade continued to be important to the Mali Empire, agriculture and pastoralism was also critical. The growing of [[sorghum]], [[millet]], and rice was a vital function. On the northern borders of the [[Sahel]], grazing cattle, sheep, goats, and camels were major activities. Mande society was organize around the village and land. A cluster of villages was called a ''kafu'', ruled by a ''farma''. The ''farma'' paid tribute to the ''mansa''. A dedicated army of elite cavalry and infantry maintained order, commanded by the royal court. A formidable force could be raised from tributary regions, if necessary.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\">Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83\u201387.</ref>\n\nConversion to [[Islam]] was a gradual process. The power of the ''mansa'' depended on upholding traditional beliefs and a spiritual foundation of power. Sundiata initially kept Islam at bay. Later ''mansas'' were devout Muslims but still acknowledged traditional [[Deity|deities]] and took part in traditional rituals and festivals, which were important to the Mande. Islam became a court religion under Sundiata's son [[Uli I of Mali|Uli I]] (1225\u20131270). ''Mansa'' Uli made a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], becoming recognized within the Muslim world. The court was staffed with literate Muslims as secretaries and accountants. Muslim traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] left vivid descriptions of the empire.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\nMali reached the peak of its power and extent in the 14th century, when [[Musa I of Mali|''Mansa'' Musa]] (1312\u20131337) made his famous ''[[hajj]]'' to Mecca with 500 slaves, each holding a bar of gold worth 500 mitqals.<ref>Davidson, Basil (1971), ''Great Ages of Man: African Kingdoms'', p. 83. New York City: [[Time Life|Time Life Books]]. [[Library of Congress]] 66-25647.</ref> ''Mansa'' Musa's ''hajj'' devalued gold in [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]] for a decade. He made a great impression on the minds of the Muslim and European world. He invited scholars and architects like [[Al Sahili|Ishal al-Tuedjin]] (al-Sahili) to further integrate Mali into the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\nThe Mali Empire saw an expansion of learning and [[literacy]]. In 1285, [[Sakura (mansa)|Sakura]], a [[Freedman|freed slave]], usurped the throne. This ''mansa'' drove the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] out of [[Timbuktu]] and established it as a center of learning and commerce. The book trade increased, and book copying became a very respectable and profitable profession. Timbuktu and [[Djenn\u00e9]] became important centers of learning within the Islamic world.<ref>Davidson (1971), pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nAfter the reign of [[Suleyman (mansa)|Mansa Suleyman]] (1341\u20131360), Mali began its spiral downward. [[Mossi people|Mossi]] cavalry raided the exposed southern border. Tuareg harassed the northern border in order to retake Timbuktu. [[Fula people|Fulani]] (Fulbe) eroded Mali's authority in the west by establishing the independent [[Imamate of Futa Toro]], a successor to the kingdom of [[Takrur]]. [[Serer people|Serer]] and [[Wolof Empire|Wolof]] alliances were broken. In 1545 to 1546, the [[Songhai Empire]] took [[Niani, Mali Empire|Niani]]. After 1599, the empire lost the [[Bambouk]] goldfields and disintegrated into petty polities.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\n=====Songhai=====\n{{Main|Songhai Empire#History}}\n{{Further|Askiya Dynasty|Sonni Dynasty}}\n[[File:SONGHAI empire map.PNG|thumb|right|250px|The Songhai Empire, c. 1500]]\nThe [[Songhai people]] are descended from fishermen on the [[Niger River|Middle Niger River]].

The Songhai speak a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan language]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 87.</ref>\n\n[[Sonni Ali]], a Songhai, began his conquest by capturing [[Timbuktu]] in 1468 from the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]. He extended the empire to the north, deep into the desert, pushed the [[Mossi people|Mossi]] further south of the Niger, and expanded southwest to Djenne. His army consisted of cavalry and a fleet of canoes. Sonni Ali was not a Muslim, and he was portrayed negatively by Berber-Arab scholars, especially for attacking Muslim Timbuktu. After his death in 1492, his heirs were deposed by General [[Askia Mohammad I|Muhammad Ture]], a Muslim of Soninke origins<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 100\u2013101.</ref>\n\nMuhammad Ture (1493\u20131528) founded the [[Askiya Dynasty]], ''[[askiya]]'' being the title of the king. He consolidated the conquests of Sonni Ali. Islam was used to extend his authority by declaring [[jihad]] on the Mossi, reviving the trans-Saharan trade, and having the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid \"shadow\" caliph]] in Cairo declare him as caliph of Sudan. He established Timbuktu as a great center of Islamic learning. Muhammad Ture expanded the empire by pushing the Tuareg north, capturing A\u00efr in the east, and capturing salt-producing [[Taghaza]]. He brought the [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa states]] into the Songhay trading network. He further centralized the administration of the empire by selecting administrators from loyal servants and families and assigning them to conquered territories. They were responsible for raising local militias. Centralization made Songhay very stable, even during dynastic disputes. [[Leo Africanus]] left vivid descriptions of the empire under Askiya Muhammad. Askiya Muhammad was deposed by his son in 1528. After much rivalry, Muhammad Ture's last son [[Askia Daoud|Askiya Daoud]] (1529\u20131582) assumed the throne.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 88.</ref>\n\nIn 1591, [[Morocco]] invaded the Songhai Empire under [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] of the [[Saadi Dynasty]] in order to secure the goldfields of the Sahel. At the [[Battle of Tondibi]], the Songhai army was defeated. The Moroccans captured Djenne, Gao, and Timbuktu, but they were unable to secure the whole region. Askiya Nuhu and the Songhay army regrouped at [[Dendi Kingdom|Dendi]] in the heart of Songhai territory where a spirited guerrilla resistance sapped the resources of the Moroccans, who were dependent upon constant resupply from Morocco. Songhai split into several states during the 17th century.\n\nMorocco found its venture unprofitable. The gold trade had been diverted to Europeans on the coast. Most of the trans-Saharan trade was now diverted east to [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]]. Expensive equipment purchased with gold had to be sent across the Sahara, an unsustainable scenario. The Moroccans who remained married into the population and were referred to as ''[[Arma people|Arma]]'' or ''Ruma''. They established themselves at Timbuktu as a military caste with various fiefs, independent from Morocco. Amid the chaos, other groups began to assert themselves, including the [[Fula people|Fulani]] of [[Futa Tooro]] who encroached from the west. The [[Bambara Empire]], one of the states that broke from Songhai, sacked Gao. In 1737, the Tuareg massacred the ''Arma''.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 88-89\">Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 88\u201389.</ref><ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 100\u2013102, 179\u2013181.</ref>\n\n=====Sokoto Caliphate=====\n{{Main|Sokoto Caliphate#History}}\n[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png|thumb|300px|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]]\nThe [[Fula people|Fulani]] were migratory people. They moved from [[Mauritania]] and settled in [[Futa Tooro]], [[Fouta Djallon|Futa Djallon]], and subsequently throughout the rest of West Africa. By the 14th century CE, they had converted to [[Islam]]. During the 16th century, they established themselves at [[Macina, Mali|Macina]] in southern [[Mali]]. During the 1670s, they declared [[jihad]]s on non-Muslims. Several states were formed from these jihadist wars, at Futa Toro, Futa Djallon, Macina, [[Oualia]], and Bundu. The most important of these states was the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] or [[Fulani Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/sultanate-sokoto-sokoto-caliphate/ |title=About the Sokoto Caliphate  |last=Amy Yoo |first=Jiwon |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=1 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn the city of [[Gobir]], [[Usman dan Fodio]] (1754\u20131817) accused the Hausa leadership of practicing an impure version of Islam and of being morally corrupt.

Jihad fever swept northern [[Nigeria]], with strong support among both the Fulani and the Hausa. Usman created an empire that included parts of northern Nigeria, [[Benin]], and [[Cameroon]], with [[Sokoto]] as its capital. He retired to teach and write and handed the empire to his son [[Muhammed Bello]].

During the 13th century, when the gold mines in modern-day [[Mali]] started to dry up, Bonoman and later other Akan states began to rise to prominence as the major players in the Gold trade. It was [[Bonoman]] and other Akan kingdoms like [[Denkyira]], [[Akyem]], [[Akwamu]] which were the predecessors to what became the all-powerful [[Empire of Ashanti]]. When and how the Ashante got to their present location is debatable. What is known is that by the 17th century an Akan people were identified as living in a state called Kwaaman. The location of the state was north of Lake Bosomtwe. The state's revenue was mainly derived from trading in gold and [[kola nut]]s and clearing forest to plant [[yam (vegetable)|yams]]. They built towns between the [[Pra River (Ghana)|Pra]] and [[Ofin]] rivers. They formed alliances for defense and paid tribute to [[Denkyira]] one of the more powerful Akan states at that time along with Adansi and [[Akwamu]]. During the 16th century, Ashante society experienced sudden changes, including population growth because of cultivation of [[New World]] plants such as [[cassava]] and [[maize]] and an increase in the gold trade between the coast and the north.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 139.</ref>\n\nBy the 17th century, [[Osei Kofi Tutu I]] (c. 1695\u20131717), with help of [[Okomfo Anokye]], unified what became the Ashante into a confederation with the [[Asante royal thrones|Golden Stool]] as a symbol of their unity and spirit. Osei Tutu engaged in a massive territorial expansion. He built up the Ashante army based on the [[Akan people|Akan]] state of [[Akwamu]], introducing new organization and turning a disciplined militia into an effective fighting machine. In 1701, the Ashante conquered Denkyira, giving them access to the coastal trade with Europeans, especially the Dutch. [[Opoku Ware I]] (1720\u20131745) engaged in further expansion, adding other southern Akan states to the growing empire. He turned north adding [[Techiman]], Banda, [[Gyaaman]], and [[Gonja people|Gonja]], states on the [[Black Volta]]. Between 1744 and 1745, ''Asantehene'' Opoku attacked the powerful northern state of Dagomba, gaining control of the important middle Niger trade routes. [[Kusi Obodom]] (1750\u20131764) succeeded Opoku. He solidified all the newly won territories. [[Osei Kwadwo]] (1777\u20131803) imposed administrative reforms that allowed the empire to be governed effectively and to continue its military expansion. [[Osei Kwame Panyin]] (1777\u20131803), Osei Tutu Kwame (1804\u20131807), and Osei Bonsu (1807\u20131824) continued territorial consolidation and expansion. The Ashante Empire included all of present-day [[Ghana]] and large parts of the [[Ivory Coast]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 140.</ref>\n\nThe ''ashantehene'' inherited his position from his mother. He was assisted at the capital, Kumasi, by a civil service of men talented in trade, diplomacy, and the military, with a head called the ''Gyaasehene''. Men from Arabia, Sudan, and Europe were employed in the civil service, all of them appointed by the ''ashantehene''. At the capital and in other towns, the ''ankobia'' or special police were used as bodyguards to the ''ashantehene'', as sources of intelligence, and to suppress rebellion. Communication throughout the empire was maintained via a network of well-kept roads from the coast to the middle Niger and linking together other trade cities.<ref>Davidson (1991), p. 240.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nFor most of the 19th century, the Ashante Empire remained powerful.

They began to assert their power a few years later. In so doing they established the Kingdom of Dahomey, with its capital at [[Agbome]]. King [[Houegbadja]] (c. 1645\u20131685) organized Dahomey into a powerful centralized state. He declared all lands to be owned of the king and subject to taxation. [[Primogeniture]] in the kingship was established, neutralizing all input from village chiefs. A \"cult of kingship\" was established. A captive slave would be sacrificed annually to honor the royal ancestors. During the 1720s, the slave-trading states of [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]] and [[Allada]] were taken, giving Dahomey direct access to the slave coast and trade with Europeans. King [[Agadja]] (1708\u20131740) attempted to end the slave trade by keeping the slaves on plantations producing palm oil, but the European profits on slaves and Dahomey's dependency on [[firearm]]s were too great. In 1730, under king Agaja, Dahomey was conquered by the [[Oyo Empire]], and Dahomey had to pay tribute. Taxes on slaves were mostly paid in cowrie shells. During the 19th century, palm oil was the main trading commodity.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 191\u2013192.</ref> [[French colonial empire|France]] conquered Dahomey during the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]] (1892\u20131894) and established a colonial government there.

The name comes from a [[Hausa language|Hausa]] word to refer to the [[Oyo Empire]]. The first Yoruba state was [[Ife|Ile-Ife]], said to have been founded around 1000 AD by a supernatural figure, the first ''oni'' [[Oduduwa]]. Oduduwa's sons would be the founders of the different city-states of the Yoruba, and his daughters would become the mothers of the various Yoruba ''obas'', or kings. Yoruba city-states were usually governed by an ''oba'' and an ''iwarefa'', a council of chiefs who advised the ''oba.'' by the 18th century, the Yoruba city-states formed a loose confederation, with the ''Oni'' of Ife as the head and Ife as the capital. As time went on, the individual city-states became more powerful with their ''obas'' assuming more powerful spiritual positions and diluting the authority of the ''Oni'' of Ife. Rivalry became intense among the city-states.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 131\u2013132.</ref>\n\nThe Oyo Empire rose in the 16th century. The Oyo state had been conquered in 1550 by the kingdom of [[Nupe people|Nupe]], which was in possession of cavalry, an important tactical advantage. The ''alafin'' (king) of Oyo was sent into exile. After returning, ''Alafin'' [[Orompoto]] (c. 1560\u20131580) built up an army based on heavily armed cavalry and long-service troops. This made them invincible in combat on the northern grasslands and in the thinly wooded forests. By the end of the 16th century, Oyo had added the western region of the Niger to the hills of Togo, the Yoruba of [[Ketu (Benin)|Ketu]], Dahomey, and the Fon nation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA governing council served the empire, with clear executive divisions. Each acquired region was assigned a local administrator. Families served in king-making capacities. Oyo, as a northern Yoruba kingdom, served as middle-man in the north\u2013south trade and connecting the eastern forest of [[Guinea]] with the western and central [[Sahel|Sudan]], the Sahara, and North Africa. The Yoruba manufactured cloth, ironware, and pottery, which were exchanged for salt, leather, and most importantly horses from the Sudan to maintain the cavalry. Oyo remained strong for two hundred years.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 173\u2013174\"/><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 134.</ref> It became a protectorate of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] in 1888, before further fragmenting into warring factions.

It was engaged in political expansion and consolidation from its very beginning. Under ''Oba'' (king) [[Ewuare]] (c. 1450\u20131480 AD), the state was organized for conquest. He solidified central authority and initiated 30 years of war with his neighbors. At his death, the Benin Empire extended to [[Dahomey]] in the west, to the [[Niger Delta]] in the east, along the west African coast, and to the Yoruba towns in the north.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nEwuare's grandson ''Oba'' [[Esigie]] (1504\u20131550) eroded the power of the ''uzama'' (state council) and increased contact and trade with Europeans, especially with the Portuguese who provided a new source of copper for court art.\nThe ''oba'' ruled with the advice of the ''uzama'', a council consisting of chiefs of powerful families and town chiefs of different guilds. Later its authority was diminished by the establishment of administrative dignitaries. Women wielded power.

By the early 18th century, it was wrecked with dynastic disputes and civil wars. However, it regained much of its former power in the reigns of Oba Eresoyen and Oba Akengbuda. After the 16th century, Benin mainly exported pepper, ivory, gum, and cotton cloth to the Portuguese and Dutch who resold it to other African societies on the coast.

These city-states were protected by the waterways and thick vegetation of the delta. The region was transformed by trade in the 17th century. The delta's city-states were comparable to those of the [[Swahili people]] in East Africa. Some, like [[Kingdom of Bonny|Bonny]], [[Kalabari Kingdom|Kalabari]], and [[Kingdom of Warri|Warri]], had kings. Others, like [[Brass, Nigeria|Brass]], were republics with small senates, and those at [[Cross River State|Cross River]] and [[Calabar|Old Calabar]] were ruled by merchants of the ''ekpe'' society. The ''ekpe'' society regulated trade and made rules for members known as house systems. Some of these houses, like the Pepples of Bonny, were well known in the Americas and Europe.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 136\u2013137.</ref>\n\nThe [[Igbo people|Igbo]] lived east of the delta (but with the [[Anioma]] on the west of the Niger River). The [[Kingdom of Nri]] rose in the 9th century, with the ''Eze'' Nri being its leader. It was a political entity composed of villages, and each village was autonomous and independent with its own territory and name, each recognized by its neighbors. Villages were democratic with all males and sometimes females a part of the decision-making process. Graves at [[Igbo-Ukwu]] (800 AD) contained brass artifacts of local manufacture and glass beads from Egypt or India, indicative of extraregional trade.<ref>Martin, Phyllis M. and O'Meara, Patrick(1995). p. 95.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 137.</ref>\n\n==19th century==\n\n===Southern Africa===\n{{Main|Southern Africa#History}}\nBy the 1850s, British and German missionaries and traders had penetrated present-day [[Namibia]]. [[Herero people|Herero]] and [[Nama people|Nama]] competed for guns and ammunition, providing cattle, ivory, and ostrich feathers. The Germans were more firmly established than the British in the region. By 1884, the [[German colonial empire|Germans]] declared the coastal region from the [[Orange River]] to the [[Cunene River|Kunene River]] a German protectorate, part of [[German South West Africa]]. They pursued an aggressive policy of land expansion for white settlements. They exploited rivalry between the Nama and Herero.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327\u2013329, 340\u2013342.</ref>\n\nThe Herero entered into an alliance with the Germans, thinking they could get an upper hand on the Nama. The Germans set up a garrison at the Herero capital and started allocating Herero land for white settlements, including the best grazing land in the central plateau, and made tax and labor demands. The Herero and [[Mbanderu people|Ovambanderu]] rebelled, but the rebellion was crushed and leaders were executed. Between 1896 and 1897, [[rinderpest]] crippled the economic backbone of the Herero and Nama economy and slowed white expansion. The Germans continued the policy of making Namibia a white settlement by seizing land and cattle, and even trying to export Herero labor to South Africa.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327</ref>\n\nIn 1904, the Herero rebelled. German General [[Lothar von Trotha]] implemented an [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|extermination policy]] at the [[Battle of Waterberg]], which drove the Herero west of the [[Kalahari Desert]]. At the end of 1905, only 16,000 Herero were alive, out of a previous population of 80,000. Nama resistance was crushed in 1907. All Nama and Herero cattle and land were confiscated from the very diminished population, with remaining Nama and Herero assuming a subordinate position.

When [[Dingiswayo]] of Mthethwa died, [[Shaka]] of the Zulu people took over. He established the [[Zulu Kingdom]], asserting authority over the Ndwandwe and pushing the Swazi north. The scattering Ndwandwe and Swazi caused the Mfecane to spread. During the 1820s, Shaka expanded the empire all along the Drakensberg foothills, with tribute being paid as far south as the [[Tugela River|Tugela]] and [[Umzimkulu River|Umzimkulu]] rivers. He replaced the chiefs of conquered polities with ''indunas'', responsible to him.

[[Voortrekkers]] tried to occupy Zulu land in 1838. In the early months they were defeated, but the survivors regrouped at the [[Blood River|Ncome River]] and soundly defeated the Zulu. However, the Voortrekkers dared not settle Zulu land. Dingane was killed in 1840 during a civil war. His brother [[Mpande]] took over and strengthened Zulu territories to the north. In 1879 [[Anglo-Zulu War|the Zulu Kingdom was invaded]] by Britain in a quest to control all of [[South Africa]]. The Zulu Kingdom was victorious at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] but was defeated at the [[Battle of Ulundi]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 256\u2013257.</ref><ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 274\u2013275\">Davidson (1991), pp. 274\u2013275.</ref>\n\nOne of the major states to emerge from the [[Mfecane]] was the [[Lesotho|Sotho Kingdom]] founded at [[Thaba Bosiu]] by [[Moshoeshoe I]] around 1821 to 1822. It was a [[confederation]] of different polities that accepted the absolute authority of Moshoeshoe. During the 1830s, the kingdom invited missionaries as a strategic means of acquiring guns and horses from the [[Cape Province|Cape]]. The [[Orange Free State]] slowly diminished the kingdom but never completely defeated it. In 1868, Moshoeshoe asked that the Sotho Kingdom be annexed by Britain, to save the remnant. It became the British protectorate of [[Basutoland]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 261\u2013262, 271.</ref>\n\n===Sotho-Tswana===\n{{Main|Sotho people#History|Tswana people#History}}\nThe arrival of the ancestors of the Tswana-speakers who came to control the region (from the [[Vaal River]] to Botswana) has yet to be dated precisely although AD 600 seems to be a consensus estimate. This massive cattle-raising complex prospered until 1300 AD or so. All these various peoples were connected to trade routes that ran via the Limpopo River to the Indian Ocean, and trade goods from Asia such as beads made their way to Botswana most likely in exchange for ivory, gold, and rhinoceros horn.\nThe first written records relating to modern-day Botswana appear in 1824. What these records show is that the Bangwaketse had become the predominant power in the region. Under the rule of Makaba II, the Bangwaketse kept vast herds of cattle in well-protected desert areas, and used their military prowess to raid their neighbours. Other chiefdoms in the area, by this time, had capitals of 10,000 or so and were fairly prosperous. This equilibrium came to end during the Mfecane period, 1823\u20131843, when a succession of invading peoples from South Africa entered the country. Although the Bangwaketse were able to defeat the invading Bakololo in 1826, over time all the major chiefdoms in Botswana were attacked, weakened, and impoverished. The Bakololo and Amandebele raided repeatedly, and took large numbers of cattle, women, and children from the Batswana\u2014most of whom were driven into the desert or sanctuary areas such as hilltops and caves. Only after 1843, when the Amandebele moved into western Zimbabwe, did this threat subside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iexplore.com/articles/travel-guides/africa/botswana/history-and-culture|title=Botswana \u2013 History and Culture|website=www.iexplore.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Botswana.html|title=Culture of Botswana \u2013 history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|website=www.everyculture.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref>\nDuring the 1840s and 1850s trade with Cape Colony-based merchants opened up and enabled the Batswana chiefdoms to rebuild. The Bakwena, Bangwaketse, Bangwato and Batawana cooperated to control the lucrative ivory trade, and then used the proceeds to import horses and guns, which in turn enabled them to establish control over what is now Botswana. This process was largely complete by 1880, and thus the Bushmen, the Bakalanga, the Bakgalagadi, the [[Tswapong people|Batswapong]] and other current minorities were subjugated by the Batswana. Following the Great Trek, Afrikaners from the Cape Colony established themselves on the borders of Botswana in the Transvaal. In 1852 a coalition of Tswana chiefdoms led by Sechele I resisted Afrikaner incursions, and after about eight years of intermittent tensions and hostilities, eventually came to a peace agreement in Potchefstroom in 1860. From that point on, the modern-day border between South Africa and Botswana was agreed on, and the Afrikaners and Batswana traded and worked together peacefully.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramsay|first=Jeff|date=1991-01-01|title=The Batswana-Boer War of 1852\u201353: how the Batswana achieved victory|url=https://journals.co.za/content/botnotes/23/1/AJA052550590_916|journal=Botswana Notes & Records|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|issn=0525-5090}}</ref>\nIn the 1820s, refugees from the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] expansion under [[Shaka]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first= R. |year=2009|title=A Concise History of South Africa|location= Cambridge|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]}}</ref> came into contact with the Basotho people residing on the highveld.\nIn 1823, those pressures caused one group of Basotho, the [[Makololo|Kololo]], to migrate north, past the [[Okavango Swamp]] and across the [[Zambezi]] into Barotseland, now part of [[Zambia]].<ref>{{Cite web|author=Muimui, Lubosi|title=Political History of Barotseland|url=http://www.barotseland.info/POLITICAL_HISTORY_BAROTSELAND.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423171845/http://www.barotseland.info/POLITICAL_HISTORY_BAROTSELAND.html|archivedate=23 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1845, the Kololo conquered Barotseland.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Phiri, Bizeck J.|year=2005|editor=Shillington, Kevin|title=Lozi Kingdom and the Kololo|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African History, Volume II, H\u2013O|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn (Routledge)|location=New York|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=umyHqvAErOAC&pg=PA851 851\u2013852]|isbn=978-1-57958-454-2}}</ref>\n\nAt about the same time, the [[Boers]] began to encroach upon Basotho territory.<ref name=\"Ross 2009\">{{cite book|last=Ross|first= R. |year=2009|title=A Concise History of South Africa|location= Cambridge|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}.</ref> After the [[Cape Colony]] had been ceded to Britain at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, the ''[[voortrekker]]s'' (\"pioneers\") were farmers who opted to leave the former Dutch colony and moved inland where they eventually established independent polities.<ref name=\"Ross 2009\"/><ref name=\"Thompson 2001\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first= L. |year=2001|title= A History of South Africa|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofsouthaf00thom_0|url-access=registration|publisher= Yale University Press|location= Cambridge}}.</ref>\n\nAt the time of these developments, [[Moshoeshoe I]] gained control of the Basotho kingdoms of the southern Highveld.<ref name=\"Thompson 2001\"/> Universally praised as a skilled diplomat and strategist, he was able to wield the disparate refugee groups escaping the [[Difaqane]] into a cohesive nation.<ref>Becker, P.

The Khoikhoi had lost economic and political independence and had been absorbed into Boer society. The Boers spoke [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], a language or dialect derived from Dutch, and no longer called themselves Boers but [[Afrikaners]]. Some Khoikhoi were used as [[commando]]s in raids against other Khoikhoi and later Xhosa. A mixed Khoi, slave, and European population called the [[Cape Coloureds]], who were outcasts within colonial society, also arose. Khoikhoi who lived far on the frontier included the Kora, [[Oorlams creole|Oorlams]], and [[Griqua people|Griqua]].

They were referred to as ''[[Voortrekkers]]''. They founded republics of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] and [[Orange Free State]], mostly in areas of sparse population that had been diminished by the ''[[Mfecane|Mfecane/Difaqane]]''. Unlike the Khoisan, the Bantu states were not conquered by the Afrikaners, because of population density and greater unity. Additionally, they began to arm themselves with guns acquired through trade at the cape. In some cases, as in the [[Xhosa Wars|Xhosa/Boer Wars]], Boers were removed from [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] lands. It required a dedicated imperial military force to subdue the Bantu-speaking states. In 1901, the Boer republics were defeated by Britain in the [[Second Boer War]]. The defeat however consummated many Afrikaners' ambition: South Africa would be under white rule.

For 400 years, European nations had mainly limited their involvement to trading stations on the African coast. Few dared venture inland from the coast; those that did, like the Portuguese, often met defeats and had to retreat to the coast. Several technological innovations helped to overcome this 400-year pattern. One was the development of [[repeating rifle]]s, which were easier and quicker to load than [[musket]]s. [[Artillery]] was being used increasingly. In 1885, [[Hiram S. Maxim]] developed the [[maxim gun]], the model of the modern-day [[machine gun]]. European states kept these weapons largely among themselves by refusing to sell these weapons to African leaders.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 268\u2013269.</ref>\n\nAfrican germs took numerous European lives and deterred permanent settlements. Diseases such as [[yellow fever]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[yaws]], and [[leprosy]] made Africa a very inhospitable place for Europeans. The deadliest disease was [[malaria]], endemic throughout [[Tropical Africa]]. In 1854, the discovery of [[quinine]] and other medical innovations helped to make conquest and colonization in Africa possible.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 269.</ref>\n\nStrong motives for conquest of Africa were at play. Raw materials were needed for European factories. Europe in the early part of the 19th century was undergoing its [[Industrial Revolution]]. Nationalist rivalries and prestige were at play. Acquiring African colonies would show rivals that a nation was powerful and significant. These factors culminated in the [[Scramble for Africa]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 265.</ref>\n\n[[File:David Livingstone attacked by a lion in Africa. Lithograph.

It was agreed that European claims to parts of Africa would only be recognised if Europeans provided effective occupation. In a series of treaties in 1890\u20131891, colonial boundaries were completely drawn. All of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] was claimed by European powers, except for Ethiopia (Abyssinia) and [[Liberia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe European powers set up a variety of different administrations in Africa, reflecting different ambitions and degrees of power. In some areas, such as parts of [[British West Africa]], colonial control was tenuous and intended for simple economic extraction, strategic power, or as part of a long-term development plan. In other areas, Europeans were encouraged to settle, creating settler states in which a European minority dominated. Settlers only came to a few colonies in sufficient numbers to have a strong impact. British settler colonies included [[British East Africa]] (now Kenya), [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], ([[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], respectively), and [[South Africa]], which already had a significant population of European settlers, the [[Boer]]s. France planned to settle [[French Algeria|Algeria]] and eventually incorporate it into the French state on an equal basis with the European provinces. Algeria's proximity across the Mediterranean allowed plans of this scale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn most areas colonial administrations did not have the manpower or resources to fully administer the territory and had to rely on local power structures to help them. Various factions and groups within the societies exploited this European requirement for their own purposes, attempting to gain positions of power within their own communities by cooperating with Europeans. One aspect of this struggle included what [[Terence Ranger]] has termed the \"invention of tradition.\" In order to legitimize their own claims to power in the eyes of both the colonial administrators and their own people, native elites would essentially manufacture \"traditional\" claims to power, or ceremonies. As a result, many societies were thrown into disarray by the new order.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nFollowing the [[Scramble for Africa]], an early but secondary focus for most [[colony|colonial]] [[regime]]s was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade.

They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger. In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere. Across Africa the powerful new force of [[nationalism]] drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers not the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them. Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S.

Darstellung von Carl Arriens.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Ngomano]] in November 1917]]\nWith the vast majority of the continent under the colonial control of European governments, the World Wars were significant events in the geopolitical history of Africa.  Africa was a theater of war and saw fighting in both wars.  More important in most regions, the [[total war]] footing of colonial powers impacted the governance of African colonies, through resource allocation, conscription, and taxation.  In [[World War I]] there were several campaigns in Africa, including the [[Togoland Campaign]], the [[Kamerun Campaign]], the [[South West Africa campaign]], and the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African campaign]].  In each, Allied forces, primarily British, but also French, Belgian, South African, and Portuguese, sought to force the Germans out of their African colonies.  In each, German forces were badly outnumbered and, due to Allied naval superiority, were cut off from reinforcement or resupply.  The Allies eventually conquered all German colonies; German forces in East Africa managed to avoid surrender throughout the war, though they could not hold any territory after 1917. After World War I, [[List of former German colonies|former German colonies]] in Africa were taken over by France, Belgium, and the British Empire.\n\nAfter World War I, colonial powers continued to consolidate their control over their African territories.  In some areas, particularly in Southern and East Africa, large settler populations were successful in pressing for additional devolution of administration, so-called \"home rule\" by the white settlers.  In many cases, settler regimes were harsher on African populations, tending to see them more as a threat to political power, as opposed to colonial regimes which had generally endeavored to co-opt local populations into economic production.  The [[Great Depression]] strongly affected Africa's non-subsistence economy, much of which was based on commodity production for Western markets.  As demand increased in the late 1930s, Africa's economy rebounded as well.\n\nAfrica was the site of one of the first instances of [[fascist]] territorial expansions in the 1930s.  Italy had attempted to conquer Ethiopia in the 1890s but had been rebuffed in the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]].  Ethiopia lay between two Italian colonies, [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[Eritrea]] and was invaded in October 1935.  With an overwhelming advantage in [[armor]] and aircraft, by May 1936, Italian forces had occupied the capital of [[Addis Ababa]] and effectively declared victory. Ethiopia and their other colonies were consolidated into [[Italian East Africa]].\n\n===World War II: Political===\n[[File:Map of Africa in 1939.png|thumb|right|Areas controlled by European powers in 1939.

Portuguese (brown) and Spanish (teal) colonies remained neutral.]]\n\nAfrica was a large continent whose geography gave it strategic importance during the war. North Africa was the scene of major British and American campaigns against Italy and Germany; East Africa was the scene of a major British campaign against Italy.  The vast geography provided major transportation routes linking the United States to the Middle East and Mediterranean regions. The sea route around South Africa was heavily used even though it added 40 days to voyages that had to avoid the dangerous Suez region. Lend Lease supplies to Russia often came this way. Internally, long-distance road and railroad connections facilitated the British war effort. The Union of Africa had dominion status and was largely self-governing, the other British possessions were ruled by the colonial office, usually with close ties to local chiefs and kings. Italian holdings were the target of successful British military campaigns. The Belgian Congo, and two other Belgian colonies, were major exporters. In terms of numbers and wealth, the British -controlled the richest portions of Africa, and made extensive use not only of the geography, but the manpower, and the natural resources.  Civilian colonial officials made a special effort to upgrade the African infrastructure, promote agriculture, integrate colonial Africa with the world economy, and recruit over a half million soldiers.<ref>Ashley Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 171\u2013239.</ref><ref>David Killingray and Richard Rathbone, edfs. ''Africa and the Second World War'' (1986).</ref>\n\nBefore the war, Britain had made few plans for the utilization of Africa, but it quickly set up command structures. The Army set up the West Africa Command, which recruited 200,000 soldiers. The East Africa Command was created in September 1941 to support the overstretched Middle East Command.  It provided the largest number of men, over 320,000, chiefly from Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda. The Southern Command was the domain of South Africa. The Royal Navy set up the South Atlantic Command based in Sierra Leone, that became one of the main convoy assembly points. The RAF Coastal Command had major submarine-hunting operations based in West Africa, while a smaller RAF command Dealt with submarines in the Indian Ocean. Ferrying aircraft from North America and Britain was the major mission of the Western Desert Air Force. In addition smaller more localized commands were set up throughout the war.<ref>Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 175\u2013177.</ref>\n\nBefore 1939, the military establishments were very small throughout British Africa, and largely consisted of whites, who comprised under two percent of the population outside South Africa. As soon as the war began, newly created African units were set up, primarily by the Army.  The new recruits were almost always volunteers, usually provided in close cooperation with local tribal leaders. During the war, military pay scales far exceeded what civilians natives could earn, especially when food, housing and clothing allowances are included. The largest numbers were in construction units, called Pioneer units, with over 82,000 soldiers.. The RAF and Navy also did some recruiting. The volunteers did some fighting, a great deal of guard duty, and construction work. 80,000 served in the Middle East. A special effort was made not to challenge white supremacy, certainly before the war, and to a large extent during the war itself. Nevertheless, the soldiers were drilled and train to European standards, given strong doses of propaganda, and learn leadership and organizational skills that proved essential to the formation of nationalistic and independence movements after 1945. There were minor episodes of discontent, but nothing serious, among the natives.<ref>Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) pp. 180\u2013189.</ref> Afrikaner nationalism was a factor in South Africa, But the proto-German Afrikaner prime minister was replaced in 1939 by [[Jan Smuts]], an Afrikaner who was an enthusiastic supporter of the British Empire. His government closely cooperated with London and raised 340,000 volunteers (190,000 were white, or about one-third of the eligible white men).<ref>Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) pp. 240\u2013245.</ref>\n\n====French Africa====\nAs early as 1857, the French established volunteer units of black soldiers in sub- Sahara Africa, termed the ''tirailleurs senegalais.'' They served in military operations throughout the Empire, including 171,000 soldiers in World War I and 160,000 in World War II.<ref>Robert Aldrich, ''Greater France: A History of French Overseas Expansion'' (1996) p. 223.</ref>  About 90,000 became POWs in Germany.

Gabon fell to Free France after the [[Battle of Gabon]] in November 1940, but West Africa remained under Vichy control until November 1942.  Vichy forces tried to resist the overwhelming [[Allied landings in North Africa]] (operation ''Torch'') in November 1942.

De Gaulle finally won out.<ref>Arthur Layton Funk, ''Charles de Gaulle: the crucial years, 1943\u20131944'' (1959).</ref>\n\n===World War II: Military===\n\nSince Germany had lost its African colonies following World War I, World War II did not reach Africa until [[Pact of Steel|Italy joined the war]] on June 10, 1940, controlling Libya and Italian East Africa.  With the [[fall of France]] on June 25, most of France's colonies in North and West Africa were controlled by the [[Vichy government]], though much of Central Africa fell under [[Free French]] control after some fighting between Vichy and Free French forces at the [[Battle of Dakar]] and the [[Battle of Gabon]]. After the fall of France, Africa was the only active theater for ground combat until the [[Italian invasion of Greece]] in October.  In the [[Western Desert campaign]] Italian forces from Libya sought to overrun Egypt, controlled by the British.  Simultaneously, in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African campaign]], Italian East African forces overran [[British Somaliland]] and some British outposts in [[Kenya]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].  When Italy's efforts to conquer Egypt (including the crucial [[Suez Canal]]) and Sudan fell short, they were unable to reestablish supply to Italian East Africa. Without the ability to reinforce or resupply and surrounded by Allied possessions, Italian East Africa was conquered by mainly British and South African forces in 1941. In North Africa, the Italians soon requested help from the Germans who sent a substantial force under General [[Rommel]].  With German help, the Axis forces regained the upper hand but were unable to break through British defenses in two tries at [[El Alamein]].  In late 1942, Allied forces, mainly Americans and Canadians, invaded French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]], where Vichy French forces initially surprised them with their resistance but were convinced to stop fighting after three days.  The second front relieved pressure on the British in Egypt who began pushing west to meet up with the Torch forces, eventually pinning German and Italian forces in [[Tunisia]], which was conquered by May 1943 in the [[Tunisia campaign]], ending the war in Africa. The only other significant operations occurred in the French colony of Madagascar, which was invaded by the British in May 1942 to deny its ports to the Axis (potentially the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] who had reached the eastern Indian Ocean).  The French garrisons in Madagascar surrendered in November 1942.\n\n===Post-war Africa: decolonization===\n{{further|Historical African place names|Decolonisation of Africa|Neocolonialism}}\n[[File:Africa independence dates.svg|thumb|right|250px|Dates of independence of African countries]]\n\nThe [[decolonization of Africa]] started with [[Libya]] in 1951, although [[Liberia]], [[South Africa]], [[Egypt]] and [[Ethiopia]] were already independent. Many countries followed in the 1950s and 1960s, with a peak in 1960 with the [[Year of Africa]], which saw 17 African nations declare independence, including a large part of [[French West Africa]]. Most of the remaining countries gained independence throughout the 1960s, although some colonizers (Portugal in particular) were reluctant to relinquish sovereignty, resulting in bitter wars of independence which lasted for a decade or more. The last African countries to gain formal independence were [[Guinea-Bissau]] (1974), [[Mozambique]] (1975) and [[Angola]] (1975) from Portugal; [[Djibouti]] from France in 1977; [[Zimbabwe]] from the United Kingdom in 1980; and [[Namibia]] from South Africa in 1990.

The earliest known [[recorded history]] [[Classical African civilization|arose]] in [[Ancient Egypt]], and later in [[Nubia]], the [[Sahel]], the [[Maghreb]] and the [[Horn of Africa]].\n\nFollowing the [[desertification]] of the [[Sahara]], North African history became entwined with the [[Middle East]] and [[Southern Europe]] while the [[Bantu expansion]] swept from modern day [[Cameroon]] (Central Africa) across much of the sub-Saharan continent in waves between around 1000 BC and 0 [[AD]], creating a linguistic commonality across much of the central and Southern continent.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], [[Islam]] spread west from Arabia to Egypt, crossing the Maghreb and the Sahel. Some notable pre-colonial states and societies in Africa include the [[Ajuran Empire]], [[D'mt]], [[Adal Sultanate]], [[Alodia]], Warsangali Sultanate, [[Kingdom of Nri]], [[Nok culture]], [[Mali Empire]], [[Songhai Empire]], [[Benin Empire]], [[Oyo Empire]], [[Kingdom of Lunda (Punu-yaka)]], [[Ashanti Empire]], [[Ghana Empire]], [[Mossi Kingdoms]], [[Mutapa Empire]], [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]], [[Kingdom of Sine]], [[Sennar (sultanate)|Kingdom of Sennar]], [[Kingdom of Saloum]], [[Kingdom of Baol]], Kingdom of [[Cayor]], [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]], [[Kingdom of Kongo]], Empire of [[Kaabu]], Kingdom of [[Ile Ife]], [[Ancient Carthage]], [[Numidia]], [[Mauretania]], and the [[Aksumite Empire]]. At its peak, prior to European [[colonialism]], it is estimated that Africa had up to 10,000 different states and autonomous groups with distinct languages and customs.<ref name=\"http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/10/31/getting-to-know-africa-50-facts/\">Africa Information</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-7th century, the [[Arab slave trade]] saw Muslim Arabs enslave Africans. Following an armistice between the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and the [[Kingdom of Makuria]] after the [[Second Battle of Dongola]] in 652 AD, they were transported, along with Asians and Europeans, across the [[Red Sea]], [[Indian Ocean]], and [[Sahara Desert]].\n\nFrom the late 15th century, Europeans joined the slave trade. One could say the Portuguese led in partnership with other Europeans. That includes the triangular trade, with the Portuguese initially acquiring slaves through trade and later by force as part of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. They transported enslaved [[West Africa|West]], [[Central Africa|Central]], and [[Southern Africa|Southern]] Africans overseas.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/slavetrade.htm |title = African Slave Trade, 1788}}</ref> Subsequently, European colonization of Africa developed rapidly from around 10% (1870) to over 90% (1914) in the [[Scramble for Africa]] (1881\u20131914).  However following struggles for independence in many parts of the continent, as well as a weakened Europe after the [[Second World War]] {{nowrap|(1939\u20131945)}}, [[decolonization]] took place across the continent, culminating in the 1960 [[Year of Africa]].\n\nDisciplines such as recording of [[oral history]], [[historical linguistics]], [[archaeology of Africa|archaeology]] and [[genetics]] have been vital in rediscovering the great African civilizations of antiquity.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n{{Human history}}\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{Further|Prehistoric North Africa|Sub-Saharan Africa#Prehistory|History of West Africa#Prehistory|Central Africa#Prehistory|East Africa#Prehistory|Horn of Africa#Prehistory|African archaeology}}\n\n===Paleolithic===\n{{Main|Lower Paleolithic|Middle Stone Age|Later Stone Age}}\nThe first known [[Hominidae|hominids]] evolved in Africa. According to [[paleontology]], the early hominids' skull anatomy was similar to that of the [[gorilla]] and the [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]], [[great apes]] that also evolved in Africa, but the hominids had adopted a [[biped]]al locomotion which freed their hands. This gave them a crucial advantage, enabling them to live in both forested areas and on the open [[savanna]] at a time when Africa was drying up and the savanna was encroaching on forested areas. This would have occurred 10 to 5 million years ago, but these claims are controversial because biologists and genetics have humans appearing around the last 70 thousand to 200 thousand years.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), ''History of Africa'', p. 2. Rev. 2nd ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|0-333-59957-8}}.</ref>\n\nBy 4 million years ago, several [[Australopithecus|australopithecine]] hominid species had developed throughout [[Southern Africa|Southern]], [[East Africa|Eastern]] and [[Central Africa]]. They were tool users, and makers of tools. They scavenged for meat and were omnivores.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 2.</ref>\n\nBy approximately 3.3 million years ago, primitive stone tools were first used to scavenge kills made by other predators and to harvest carrion and marrow from their bones. In hunting, ''[[Homo habilis]]'' was probably not capable of competing with large predators and was still more prey than hunter. ''H. habilis'' probably did steal eggs from nests and may have been able to catch small [[game (food)|game]] and weakened larger prey (cubs and older animals). The tools were classed as [[Oldowan]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, p. 2-3\">Shillington (2005), pp. 2\u20133.</ref>\n\nAround 1.8 million years ago, ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' first appeared in the fossil record in Africa. From ''Homo ergaster'', ''[[Homo erectus]]'' evolved 1.5 million years ago. Some of the earlier representatives of this species were still fairly small-brained and used primitive stone tools, much like ''H. habilis''. The brain later grew in size, and ''H. erectus'' eventually developed a more complex stone tool technology called the [[Acheulean]]. Possibly the first hunters, ''H. erectus'' mastered the art of making fire and was the first hominid to leave Africa, colonizing most of [[Afro-Eurasia]] and perhaps later giving rise to ''[[Homo floresiensis]]''. Although some recent writers have suggested that ''[[Homo georgicus]]'' was the first and primary hominid ever to live outside Africa, many scientists consider ''H. georgicus'' to be an early and primitive member of the ''H. erectus'' species.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 3.</ref><ref>Ehret, Christopher (2002), ''The Civilizations of Africa'', p. 22.

This is particularly true of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Nubia]]. In the [[Horn of Africa]] the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] ruled modern-day [[Eritrea]], northern [[Ethiopia]] and the coastal area of the western part of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The Ancient Egyptians established ties with the [[Land of Punt]] in 2,350 BC. Punt was a trade partner of Ancient Egypt and it is believed that it was located in modern-day [[Somalia]], [[Djibouti]] or [[Eritrea]].<ref>Simson Najovits, ''Egypt, trunk of the tree, Volume 2'', (Algora Publishing: 2004), p.258.</ref> [[Phoenicia]]n cities such as [[Carthage]] were part of the Mediterranean [[Iron Age]] and [[classical antiquity]].

The regions with the largest population pressure were in the [[Nile Delta]] region of [[Lower Egypt]], in [[Upper Egypt]], and also along the [[Cataracts of the Nile|second and third cataracts]] of the [[Dongola Reach]] of the Nile in Nubia. This population pressure and growth was brought about by the cultivation of southwest Asian crops, including wheat and barley, and the raising of sheep, goats, and cattle. Population growth led to competition for farm land and the need to regulate farming. Regulation was established by the formation of [[Bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] among sacral chiefdoms. The first and most powerful of the chiefdoms was [[Ta-Seti]], founded around 3,500 BC. The idea of sacral chiefdom spread throughout Upper and Lower Egypt.<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 143\u2013146.</ref>\n\n[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[pyramids of Giza]], symbols of the civilization of ancient Egypt]]\nLater consolidation of the chiefdoms into broader political entities began to occur in Upper and Lower Egypt, culminating into the unification of Egypt into one political entity by [[Narmer]] ([[Menes]]) in 3,100 BC. Instead of being viewed as a sacral chief, he became a [[Imperial cult|divine king]]. The [[henotheism]], or worship of a single god within a polytheistic system, practiced in the sacral chiefdoms along Upper and Lower Egypt, became the polytheistic [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]. Bureaucracies became more centralized under the [[pharaoh]]s, run by [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|viziers]], governors, tax collectors, generals, artists, and technicians. They engaged in tax collecting, organizing of labor for major public works, and building irrigation systems, [[pyramid]]s, temples, and canals. During the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (2,620\u20132,480 BC), long distance trade was developed, with the [[Levant]] for timber, with Nubia for gold and skins, with [[Land of Punt|Punt]] for [[frankincense]], and also with the western Libyan territories. For most of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]], Egypt developed her fundamental systems, institutions and culture, always through the central bureaucracy and by the divinity of the [[Pharaoh]].<ref>Davidson, Basil (1991), ''Africa In History: Themes and Outlines'', pp. 30\u201333.

By 2,200 BC, the Old Kingdom's stability was undermined by rivalry among the governors of the [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]] who challenged the power of pharaohs and by invasions of Asiatics into the Nile Delta. The [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]] had begun, a time of political division and uncertainty.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33\">Davidson (1991), pp. 30\u201333.</ref>\n\n[[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] of Egypt arose when Mentuhotep II of [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]] unified Egypt once again between 2041 and 2016 BC beginning with his conquering of [[Tenth Dynasty of Egypt|Tenth Dynasty]] in 2041 BC.<ref name=\"Grimal 155\">[[#Grimal1988|Grimal.

Connections with the southern regions of [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], Wawat and Irthet at the second cataract were made stronger. Then came the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]], with the invasion of the [[Hyksos]] on horse-drawn [[chariot]]s and utilizing bronze weapons, a technology heretofore unseen in Egypt. Horse-drawn chariots soon spread to the west in the inhabitable Sahara and North Africa. The Hyksos failed to hold on to their Egyptian territories and were absorbed by Egyptian society. This eventually led to one of Egypt's most powerful phases, the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] (1,580\u20131,080 BC), with the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]]. Egypt became a [[superpower]] controlling Nubia and [[Judea]] while exerting political influence on the Libyans to the West and on the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33\"/>\n\nAs before, the New Kingdom ended with invasion from the west by Libyan princes, leading to the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]]. Beginning with [[Shoshenq I]], the [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-second Dynasty]] was established. It ruled for two centuries.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33\"/>\n\nTo the south, Nubian independence and strength was being reasserted. This reassertion led to the conquest of Egypt by Nubia, begun by [[Kashta]] and completed by [[Piye]] (Pianhky, 751\u2013730 BC) and [[Shabaka]] (716\u2013695 BC). This was the birth of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]]. The Nubians tried to re-establish Egyptian traditions and customs. They ruled Egypt for a hundred years. This was ended by an [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] invasion, with [[Taharqa]] experiencing the full might of Assyrian iron weapons. The Nubian pharaoh [[Tantamani]] was the last of the Twenty-fifth dynasty.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33\"/>\n\nWhen the Assyrians and Nubians left, a new [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-sixth Dynasty]] emerged from [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]]. It lasted until 525 BC, when Egypt was invaded by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]]. Unlike the Assyrians, the Persians stayed. In 332, Egypt was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. This was the beginning of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], which ended with [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman conquest]] in 30 BC.

Ta-Seti was a powerful sacral kingdom in the Nile Valley at the 1st and 2nd cataracts that exerted an influence over nearby chiefdoms based on pictorial representation ruling over [[Upper Egypt]]. Ta-Seti traded as far as [[Syro-Palestine]], as well as with Egypt. Ta-Seti exported gold, copper, ostrich feathers, [[ebony]] and [[ivory trade|ivory]] to the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. By the 32nd century BC, Ta-Seti was in decline. After the unification of Egypt by [[Narmer]] in 3,100 BC, Ta-Seti was invaded by the Pharaoh [[Hor-Aha]] of the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], destroying the final remnants of the kingdom.

Around the latter part of the third millennium, there was further consolidation of the sacral kingdoms.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Two kingdoms in particular emerged: the Sai kingdom, immediately south of Egypt, and the [[Kingdom of Kerma]] at the third cataract. Sometime around the 18th century BC, the Kingdom of Kerma conquered the Kingdom of Sai, becoming a serious rival to Egypt. Kerma occupied a territory from the first cataract to the confluence of the [[Blue Nile]], [[White Nile]], and [[Atbarah River]]. About 1,575 to 1,550 BC, during the latter part of the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth Dynasty]], the Kingdom of Kerma invaded Egypt.<ref>Alberge, Dalya. \"Tomb Reveals Ancient Egypt's Humiliating Secret\", ''The Times'' {London}, 28 July 2003.</ref> The Kingdom of Kerma allied itself with the [[Hyksos]] invasion of Egypt.<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 148\u2013151.</ref>\n\nEgypt eventually re-energized under the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] and conquered the Kingdom of Kerma or [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], ruling it for almost 500 years. The Kushites were Egyptianized during this period. By 1100 BC, the Egyptians had withdrawn from Kush. The region regained independence and reasserted its culture. Kush built a new religion around [[Amun]] and made [[Napata]] its spiritual center. In 730 BC, the Kingdom of Kush invaded Egypt, taking over [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and beginning the Nubian Empire. The empire extended from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to the confluence of the Blue Nile, the White Nile, and River Atbara.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 40\u201341.</ref>\n\nIn 760 BC, the Kushites were expelled from Egypt by iron-wielding [[Assyria]]ns. Later, the administrative capital was moved from Napata to [[Mer\u00f6e]], developing a new Nubian culture. Initially, Meroites were highly Egyptianized, but they subsequently began to take on distinctive features. Nubia became a center of iron-making and cotton cloth manufacturing. Egyptian writing was replaced by the [[Meroitic alphabet]]. The lion god [[Apedemak]] was added to the Egyptian pantheon of gods. Trade links to the [[Red Sea]] increased, linking Nubia with Mediterranean [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. Its architecture and art diversified, with pictures of lions, ostriches, giraffes, and elephants. Eventually, with the rise of [[Aksum]], Nubia's trade links were broken and it suffered environmental degradation from the tree cutting required for iron production. In 350 AD, the Aksumite king [[Ezana]] brought Mer\u00f6e to an end.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 42\u201345.</ref>\n\n===Carthage===\n{{main|Ancient Carthage#History}}\n[[File:Carthaginianempire.PNG|thumb|250px|Carthaginian Empire]]\nThe Egyptians referred to the people west of the Nile, ancestral to the [[Berber people|Berbers]], as [[Ancient Libya|Libyans]]. The Libyans were agriculturalists like the [[Mauri (people)|Mauri]] of [[Morocco]] and the [[Numidians]] of central and eastern [[Algeria]] and [[Tunis]]. They were also nomadic, having the horse, and occupied the arid pastures and desert, like the [[Gaetuli]]. Berber desert nomads were typically in conflict with Berber coastal agriculturalists.<ref>Iliffe, John (2007), ''Africans: The History of a Continent'', p. 30. 2nd ed.

They began to populate the North African coast with settlements{{mdash}}trading and mixing with the native Berber population. In 814 BC, Phoenicians from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] established the city of [[Carthage]]. By 600 BC, Carthage had become a major trading entity and power in the Mediterranean, largely through trade with tropical Africa. Carthage's prosperity fostered the growth of the Berber kingdoms, [[Numidia]] and [[Mauretania]]. Around 500 BC, Carthage provided a strong impetus for trade with [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Berber middlemen, who had maintained contacts with Sub-Saharan Africa since the desert had desiccated, utilized pack animals to transfer products from oasis to oasis. Danger lurked from the [[Garamantes]] of [[Fes|Fez]], who raided caravans. Salt and metal goods were traded for gold, slaves, beads, and ivory.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 63\u201365.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ruines de Carthage.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ruins of Carthage]]\nThe [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] were rivals to the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Carthage fought the [[Punic Wars]], three wars with Rome: the [[First Punic War]] (264 to 241 BC), over [[Sicily]]; the [[Second Punic War]] (218 to 201 BC), in which [[Hannibal]] invaded Europe; and the [[Third Punic War]] (149 to 146 BC). Carthage lost the first two wars, and in the third it was destroyed, becoming the [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman province of Africa]], with the Berber Kingdom of Numidia assisting Rome. The Roman province of Africa became a major agricultural supplier of wheat, [[olive]]s, and [[olive oil]] to [[Roman Empire|imperial Rome]] via exorbitant taxation. Two centuries later, Rome brought the Berber kingdoms of Numidia and Mauretania under its authority. In the 420's AD, [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]] invaded North Africa and Rome lost her territories. The Berber kingdoms subsequently regained their independence.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 65.</ref>\n\n[[Christianity]] gained a foothold in Africa at [[Alexandria]] in the 1st century AD and spread to [[Maghreb|Northwest Africa]]. By 313 AD, with the [[Edict of Milan]], all of Roman North Africa was Christian.

[[Berber people|Berber]] civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others. By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed one of the largest element, with Gauls, of the Carthaginian army.\n\nIn the [[Mercenary War]] (241-238 BC), a rebellion was instigated by mercenary soldiers of Carthage and African allies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dcc.dickinson.edu/nepos-hannibal/first-punic-war|title=The First Punic War {{!}} Dickinson College Commentaries|website=dcc.dickinson.edu|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> Berber soldiers participated after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]]. Berbers succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]]; in 146 BC the city of Carthage was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay Mauretania, which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the [[Almohad]]s and [[Almoravid dynasty]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC. After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Masinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].\n\n===Somalia===\n{{Main|History of Somalia}}\n{{Further|Maritime history of Somalia}}\n[[File:Qableh1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Ruins of [[Qa'ableh]], an early center of [[Somali people|Somali]] civilization]]\nThe ancestors of the [[Somali people]] were an important link in the [[Horn of Africa]] connecting the region's commerce with the rest of the ancient world.

Sedentary tribes lost their autonomy and connection with the land. Berber opposition to the Roman presence was nearly constant. The [[Roman emperor]] [[Trajan]] established a frontier in the south by encircling the Aur\u00e8s and [[Nemencha]] mountains and building a line of forts from Vescera (modern [[Biskra]]) to Ad Majores ([[Hennchir Besseriani]], southeast of Biskra). The defensive line extended at least as far as Castellum Dimmidi (modern [[Messa\u00e2d]], southwest of Biskra), Roman Algeria's southernmost fort.

Starting in the 2nd century AD, these garrisons were manned mostly by local inhabitants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nAside from [[Carthage]], urbanization in North Africa came in part with the establishment of settlements of veterans under the Roman emperors [[Claudius]] (reigned 41\u201354), [[Nerva]] (96\u201398), and [[Trajan]] (98\u2013117).

The prosperity of most towns depended on [[agriculture]]. Called the \"granary of the empire\", North Africa became one of the largest exporters of grain in the empire, shipping to the provinces which did not produce cereals, like [[Roman Italy|Italy]] and [[Roman Greece|Greece]]. Other crops included fruit, figs, grapes, and beans. By the 2nd century AD, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe beginnings of the [[Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire|Roman imperial decline]] seemed less serious in North Africa than elsewhere. However, uprisings did take place. In 238 AD, landowners rebelled unsuccessfully against imperial fiscal policies. Sporadic tribal revolts in the Mauretanian mountains followed from 253 to 288, during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. The towns also suffered economic difficulties, and building activity almost ceased.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe towns of Roman North Africa had a substantial [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Jewish population]].

The Donatists stressed the holiness of the church and refused to accept the authority to administer the sacraments of those who had surrendered the scriptures when they were forbidden under the Emperor [[Diocletian]] (reigned 284\u2013305). The Donatists also opposed the involvement of [[Constantine the Great]] (reigned 306\u2013337) in church affairs in contrast to the majority of Christians who welcomed official imperial recognition.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe occasionally violent Donatist controversy has been characterized{{by whom|date=December 2013}} as a struggle between opponents and supporters of the Roman system. The most articulate North African critic of the Donatist position, which came to be called a heresy, was [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], bishop of [[Hippo Regius]]. Augustine maintained that the unworthiness of a minister did not affect the validity of the sacraments because their true minister was [[Jesus]] [[Christ]]. In his sermons and books Augustine, who is considered a leading exponent of Christian dogma, evolved a theory of the right of orthodox Christian rulers to use force against schismatics and heretics. Although the dispute was resolved by a decision of an imperial commission in Carthage in 411, Donatist communities continued to exist as late as the 6th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA decline in trade weakened Roman control.

D'mt traded through the [[Red Sea]] with Egypt and the Mediterranean, providing frankincense. By the 5th and 3rd centuries, D'mt had declined, and several successor states took its place. Later there was greater trade with [[South Arabia]], mainly with the port of [[Sabaeans|Saba]]. [[Adulis]] became an important commercial center in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. The interaction of the peoples in the two regions, the southern Arabia [[Sabaeans]] and the northern Ethiopians, resulted in the [[Ge'ez]] culture and language and eventual development of the [[Ge'ez script]]. Trade links increased and expanded from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, with Egypt, Israel, Phoenicia, Greece, and Rome, to the Black Sea, and to Persia, India, and China. Aksum was known throughout those lands. By the 5th century BC, the region was very prosperous, exporting ivory, hippopotamus hides, gold dust, spices, and live elephants.

By the late 11th century, the Islamic [[Sayfawa Dynasty|Sayfawa (Saifawa) dynasty]] was founded by [[Hummay|Humai (Hummay) ibn Salamna]]. The Sayfawa Dynasty ruled for 771 years, making it one of the longest-lasting dynasties in human history.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 88-89\"/> In addition to trade, taxation of local farms around Kanem became a source of state income. Kanem reached its peak under ''Mai'' (king) [[Dunama Dabbalemi|Dunama Dibalemi ibn Salma]] (1210\u20131248). The empire reportedly was able to field 40,000 cavalry, and it extended from [[Fezzan]] in the north to the [[Sao civilisation|Sao]] state in the south.

A new centralized political system of spiritual kings (''balopwe'') with a court council of head governors and sub-heads all the way to village heads. The ''balopwe'' was the direct communicator with the ancestral spirits and chosen by them. Conquered states were integrated into the system and represented in the court, with their titles. The authority of the ''balopwe'' resided in his spiritual power rather than his military authority. The army was relatively small. The Luba was able to control regional trade and collect tribute for redistribution. Numerous offshoot states were formed with founders claiming descent from the Luba. The Luba political system spread throughout [[Central Africa]], southern [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], and the western Congo. Two major empires claiming Luba descent were the [[Lunda Empire]] and [[Maravi|Maravi Empire]].

His son Naweej expanded the empire further and is known as the first Lunda emperor, with the title ''mwato yamvo'' (''mwaant yaav'', ''mwant yav''), the Lord of Vipers. The Luba political system was retained, and conquered peoples were integrated into the system.

''Kinguri'' became the title of kings of states founded by Queen Rweej's brother. The [[Luena people|Luena]] (Lwena) and [[Lozi people|Lozi]] (Luyani) in [[Zambia]] also claim descent from Kinguri. During the 17th century, a Lunda chief and warrior called [[Mwata Kazembe]] set up an [[Eastern Lunda]] kingdom in the valley of the [[Luapula River]]. The Lunda's western expansion also saw claims of descent by the [[Yaka people|Yaka]] and the [[Pende people|Pende]]. The Lunda linked Central Africa with the western coast trade.

The capital was [[M'banza-Kongo]]. With superior organization, they were able to conquer their neighbors and extract tribute. They were experts in metalwork, pottery, and weaving raffia cloth.

Later, [[maize]] (corn) and [[cassava]] (manioc) would be introduced to the region via trade with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] at their ports at [[Luanda]] and [[Benguela]].

Slave trading increased with Afonso's wars of conquest. About 1568 to 1569, the [[Jaga (people)|Jaga]] invaded Kongo, laying waste to the kingdom and forcing the ''manikongo'' into exile. In 1574, Manikongo [[\u00c1lvaro I of Kongo|\u00c1lvaro I]] was reinstated with the help of Portuguese mercenaries. During the latter part of the 1660s, the Portuguese tried to gain control of Kongo. Manikongo [[Ant\u00f3nio I of Kongo|Ant\u00f3nio I]] (1661\u20131665), with a Kongolese army of 5,000, was destroyed by an army of Afro-Portuguese at the [[Battle of Mbwila]].

Ndongo was ruled by the ''ngola''. Ndongo would also engage in slave trading with the Portuguese, with [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]] being a transit point to Brazil. The kingdom was not as welcoming as Kongo; it viewed the Portuguese with great suspicion and as an enemy. The Portuguese in the latter part of the 16th century tried to gain control of Ndongo but were defeated by the [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]]. Ndongo experienced depopulation from slave raiding. The leaders established another state at [[Kingdom of Matamba|Matamba]], affiliated with [[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba|Queen Nzinga]], who put up a strong resistance to the Portuguese until coming to terms with them. The Portuguese settled along the coast as trade dealers, not venturing on conquest of the interior. Slavery wreaked havoc in the interior, with states initiating wars of conquest for captives.

Conflict arose as to who should be the successor of the prophet. The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] had initially taken control of the [[Caliphate]], with their capital at [[Damascus]]. Later, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] had taken control, moving the capital to [[Baghdad]]. The [[Berber people]], being independent in spirit and hostile to outside interference in their affairs and to [[Arab]] exclusivity in orthodox Islam, adopted [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] and [[Kharijites|Kharijite]] Islam, both considered unorthodox and hostile to the authority of the Abbasid Caliphate. Numerous Kharijite kingdoms came and fell during the 8th and 9th centuries, asserting their independence from Baghdad. In the early 10th century, Shi'ite groups from Syria, claiming descent from Muhammad's daughter [[Fatimah]], founded the [[Fatimid Dynasty]] in the [[Maghreb]]. By 950, they had conquered all of the Maghreb and by 969 all of Egypt. They had immediately broken away from Baghdad.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to bring about a purer form of Islam among the [[Zenaga people|Sanhaja]] Berbers, [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] founded the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] movement in present-day [[Mauritania]] and [[Western Sahara]]. The Sanhaja Berbers, like the [[Soninke people|Soninke]], practiced an indigenous religion alongside Islam. Abdallah ibn Yasin found ready converts in the [[Lamtuna]] Sanhaja, who were dominated by the Soninke in the south and the [[Zenata]] Berbers in the north. By the 1040s, all of the Lamtuna was converted to the Almoravid movement. With the help of Yahya ibn Umar and his brother [[Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar|Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], the sons of the Lamtuna chief, the Almoravids created an empire extending from the Sahel to the Mediterranean. After the death of Abdallah ibn Yassin and Yahya ibn Umar, Abu Bakr split the empire in half, between himself and [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], because it was too big to be ruled by one individual. Abu Bakr took the south to continue fighting the Soninke, and Yusuf ibn Tashfin took the north, expanding it to southern Spain. The death of Abu Bakr in 1087 saw a breakdown of unity and increase military dissension in the south. This caused a re-expansion of the Soninke. The Almoravids were once held responsible for bringing down the [[Ghana Empire]] in 1076, but this view is no longer credited.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005). p 90.</ref>\n\n[[File:Safi minaret.png|thumb|left|250px|The Almohad minaret in Safi]]\n\nDuring the 10th through 13th centuries, there was a large-scale movement of [[bedouin]]s out of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. About 1050, a quarter of a million Arab nomads from Egypt moved into the Maghreb. Those following the northern coast were referred to as [[Banu Hilal]]. Those going south of the [[Atlas Mountains]] were the [[Banu Sulaym]]. This movement spread the use of the [[Arabic language]] and hastened the decline of the [[Berber languages|Berber language]] and the [[Arabization|Arabisation]] of North Africa. Later an Arabised Berber group, the Hawwara, went south to Nubia via Egypt.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 156\u2013157</ref>\n\nIn the 1140s, [[Abd al-Mu'min]] declared [[jihad]] on the [[Almoravids]], charging them with decadence and corruption. He united the northern Berbers against the Almoravids, overthrowing them and forming the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohad]] Empire. During this period, the Maghreb became thoroughly [[Islamization|Islamised]] and saw the spread of [[literacy]], the development of [[algebra]], and the use of the number [[0 (number)|zero]] and [[decimal]]s. By the 13th century, the Almohad states had split into three rival states. Muslim states were largely extinguished in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]. Around 1415, Portugal engaged in a ''[[reconquista]]'' of North Africa by capturing [[Ceuta]], and in later centuries Spain and Portugal acquired other ports on the North African coast. In 1492, at the end of the [[Granada War]], Spain defeated Muslims in the [[Emirate of Granada]], effectively ending eight centuries of Muslim domination in southern Iberia.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 88\u201392.</ref>\n\nPortugal and Spain took the ports of [[Tangiers]], [[Algiers]], [[Tripoli]], and [[Tunis]]. This put them in direct competition with the [[Ottoman Empire]], which re-took the ports using Turkish corsairs ([[Piracy|pirates]] and [[privateer]]s). The Turkish corsairs would use the ports for raiding Christian ships, a major source of booty for the towns. Technically, North Africa was under the control of the Ottoman Empire, but only the coastal towns were fully under [[Istanbul]]'s control. Tripoli benefited from trade with [[Borno State|Borno]]. The [[pashas]] of Tripoli traded horses, firearms, and armor via Fez with the sultans of the [[Bornu Empire]] for slaves.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 166\u2013167</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, an Arab nomad tribe that claimed descent from Muhammad's daughter, the [[Saadi dynasty|Saadis]], conquered and united [[Morocco]]. They prevented the Ottoman Empire from reaching to the Atlantic and expelled Portugal from Morocco's western coast. [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] brought the state to the height of its power. He invaded [[Songhai Empire|Songhay]] in 1591, to control the gold trade, which had been diverted to the western coast of Africa for European ships and to the east, to Tunis. Morocco's hold on Songhay diminished in the 17th century. In 1603, after Ahmad's death, the kingdom split into the two sultanates of [[Fes]] and [[Marrakesh]]. Later it was reunited by [[Al-Rashid of Morocco|Moulay al-Rashid]], founder of the [[Alaouite Dynasty]] (1672\u20131727). His brother and successor, [[Ismail ibn Sharif]] (1672\u20131727), strengthened the unity of the country by importing slaves from the Sudan to build up the military.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 167\u2013168.</ref>\n\n====Nile Valley====\n{{See|Nile#History}}\n\n=====Egypt=====\n{{Main|History of Egypt#Arab and Ottoman Egypt (641\u20131882)}}\n{{Further|Lists of rulers of Egypt}}\n[[File:Fatimid Caliphate.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Fatimid Caliphate]]\n\nIn 642 AD, the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] conquered [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Byzantine Egypt]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005 pp. 65-67\"/>\n\nEgypt under the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] was prosperous. Dams and canals were repaired, and wheat, barley, flax, and cotton production increased. Egypt became a major producer of linen and cotton cloth. Its Mediterranean and Red Sea trade increased. Egypt also minted a gold currency called the Fatimid dinar, which was used for international trade. The bulk of revenues came from taxing the [[fellah]]in ([[peasant]] farmers), and taxes were high. Tax collecting was leased to [[Berber people|Berber]] overlords, who were soldiers who had taken part in the Fatimid conquest in 969 AD. The overlords paid a share to the caliphs and retained what was left. Eventually, they became landlords and constituted a settled land aristocracy.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), p. 157.</ref>\n\nTo fill the military ranks, [[Mamluk]] Turkish slave cavalry and Sudanese slave infantry were used. Berber freemen were also recruited. In the 1150s, tax revenues from farms diminished. The soldiers revolted and wreaked havoc in the countryside, slowed trade, and diminished the power and authority of the Fatimid caliphs.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 158.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1160s, Fatimid Egypt came under threat from [[Crusades|European crusaders]]. Out of this threat, a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] general named [[Saladin|\u1e62al\u0101\u1e25 ad-D\u012bn Y\u016bsuf ibn Ayy\u016bb]] (Saladin), with a small band of professional soldiers, emerged as an outstanding Muslim defender. Saladin defeated the Christian crusaders at Egypt's borders and [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|recaptured Jerusalem]] in 1187. On the death of [[Al-Adid]], the last Fatimid caliph, in 1171, Saladin became the ruler of Egypt, ushering in the [[Ayyubid Dynasty]]. Under his rule, Egypt returned to [[Sunni Islam]], [[Cairo]] became an important center of Arab Islamic learning, and Mamluk slaves were increasingly recruited from Turkey and southern Russia for military service. Support for the military was tied to the ''iqta'', a form of land taxation in which soldiers were given ownership in return for military service.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 158\u2013159</ref>\n\nOver time, Mamluk slave soldiers became a very powerful [[landed nobility|landed aristocracy]], to the point of getting rid of the Ayyubid dynasty in 1250 and establishing a [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk dynasty]]. The more powerful Mamluks were referred to as ''[[Emir|amirs]]''. For 250 years, Mamluks controlled all of Egypt under a military dictatorship. Egypt extended her territories to Syria and Palestine, thwarted the crusaders, and halted a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion in 1260 at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]]. Mamluk Egypt came to be viewed as a protector of Islam, and of [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]]. Eventually the ''iqta'' system declined and proved unreliable for providing an adequate military. The Mamluks started viewing their ''iqta'' as hereditary and became attuned to urban living. Farm production declined, and dams and canals lapsed into disrepair. Mamluk military skill and technology did not keep pace with new technology of [[handgun]]s and [[cannon]]s.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 159\u2013161.</ref>\n\nWith the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Egypt was easily defeated. In 1517, at the end of an [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War]], Egypt became part of the Ottoman Empire. The [[Istanbul]] government revived the ''iqta'' system. Trade was reestablished in the Red Sea, but it could not completely connect with the [[Indian Ocean]] trade because of growing Portuguese presence. During the 17th and 18th centuries, hereditary Mamluks regained power. The leading Mamluks were referred to as ''[[bey]]s''. [[Pasha]]s, or viceroys, represented the Istanbul government in name only, operating independently. During the 18th century, dynasties of pashas became established. The government was weak and corrupt.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 161.</ref>\n\nIn 1798, [[Napoleon]] [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invaded Egypt]]. The local forces had little ability to resist the French conquest. However, the [[British Empire]] and the Ottoman Empire were able to remove French occupation in 1801. These events marked the beginning of a 19th-century Anglo-Franco rivalry over Egypt.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 162.</ref>\n\n=====Sudan=====\n{{Main|History of Sudan}}\n\n====Christian and Islamic Nubia====\n{{Main|Nubia#Christian Nubia|Nubia#Islamic Nubia}}\n{{Further|List of rulers of Makuria}}\n[[File:Christian Nubia.png|thumb|right|250px|Christian Nubia and the Nile [[cataract]]s]]\nAfter [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana of Aksum]] sacked [[Meroe]], people associated with the site of [[Ballana]] moved into [[Nubia]] from the southwest and founded three kingdoms: [[Kingdom of Makuria|Makuria]], [[Nobatia]], and [[Alodia]]. They would rule for 200 years. Makuria was above the [[Cataracts of the Nile|third cataract]], along the Dongola Reach with its capital at [[Dongola]]. Nobadia was to the north with its capital at [[Faras]], and [[Alodia]] was to the south with its capital at [[Soba (city)|Soba]]. Makuria eventually absorbed Nobadia. The people of the region converted to [[Monophysitism|Monophysite Christianity]] around 500 to 600 CE. The church initially started writing in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], then in [[Greek language|Greek]], and finally in [[Old Nubian language|Old Nubian]], a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] language. The church was aligned with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Coptic Church]].<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 67</ref><ref>Ehret (2002), p. 305.</ref>\n\nBy 641, [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt was conquered]] by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. This effectively blocked Christian Nubia and Aksum from Mediterranean Christendom. In 651\u2013652, Arabs from Egypt invaded Christian Nubia. Nubian archers soundly defeated the invaders. The [[Bakt|Baqt (or Bakt) Treaty]] was drawn, recognizing Christian Nubia and regulating trade. The treaty controlled relations between Christian Nubia and Islamic Egypt for almost six hundred years.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 77.</ref>\n\nBy the 13th century, Christian Nubia began its decline. The authority of the monarchy was diminished by the church and nobility. Arab [[bedouin]] tribes began to infiltrate Nubia, causing further havoc. ''[[Fakir]]s'' (holy men) practicing [[Sufism]] introduced Islam into Nubia. By 1366, Nubia had become divided into petty fiefdoms when it was invaded by [[Mamluk]]s. During the 15th century, Nubia was open to Arab immigration. Arab nomads intermingled with the population and introduced the [[Arab culture]] and the [[Arabic]] language. By the 16th century, [[Makuria]] and [[Nobadia]] had been [[Islamization|Islamized]]. During the 16th century, Abdallah Jamma headed an Arab confederation that destroyed Soba, capital of Alodia, the last holdout of Christian Nubia. Later Alodia would fall under the [[Sennar (sultanate)|Funj Sultanate]].<ref>Collins and Burns 2007, p. 77.</ref>\n\nDuring the 15th century, [[Funj people|Funj]] herders migrated north to [[Alodia]] and occupied it. Between 1504 and 1505, the kingdom expanded, reaching its peak and establishing its capital at [[Sennar]] under [[Badi II|Badi II Abu Daqn]] (c. 1644\u20131680). By the end of the 16th century, the Funj had converted to Islam. They pushed their empire westward to [[Kurdufan|Kordofan]]. They expanded eastward, but were halted by Ethiopia. They controlled Nubia down to the 3rd Cataract. The economy depended on captured enemies to fill the army and on merchants travelling through Sennar. Under [[Badi IV]] (1724\u20131762), the army turned on the king, making him nothing but a figurehead. In 1821, the Funj were conquered by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (1805\u20131849), Pasha of Egypt.<ref>Page, Willie F.(2001).

The state arose in the 12th century CE. Its wealth came from controlling the trade in ivory from the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo Valley]], copper from the mountains of northern [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], and gold from the [[Zimbabwe]] Plateau between the Limpopo and [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] rivers, with the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] merchants at [[Chibuene]]. By the mid-13th century, Mapungubwe was abandoned.<ref>Ehret, Christopher (2002). p. 252.</ref>\n\nAfter the decline of Mapungubwe, [[Great Zimbabwe]] rose on the Zimbabwe Plateau. ''Zimbabwe'' means stone building. Great Zimbabwe was the first city in Southern Africa and was the center of an empire, consolidating lesser [[Shona people|Shona]] polities. Stone building was inherited from Mapungubwe. These building techniques were enhanced and came into maturity at Great Zimbabwe, represented by the wall of the Great Enclosure. The dry-stack stone masonry technology was also used to build smaller compounds in the area. Great Zimbabwe flourished by trading with Swahili Kilwa and [[Sofala]]. The rise of Great Zimbabwe parallels the rise of Kilwa. Great Zimbabwe was a major source of gold. Its royal court lived in luxury, wore Indian cotton, surrounded themselves with copper and gold ornaments, and ate on plates from as far away as Persia and China. Around the 1420s and 1430s, Great Zimbabwe was on decline. The city was abandoned by 1450. Some have attributed the decline to the rise of the trading town [[Ingombe Ilede]].<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 252\u2013254.</ref><ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153\">Shillington (2005), pp. 147\u2013153.</ref>\n\nA new chapter of Shona history ensued. Nyatsimba Mutota, a northern Shona king of the Karanga, engaged in conquest. He and his son Mutope conquered the Zimbabwe Plateau, going through [[Mozambique]] to the east coast, linking the empire to the coastal trade. They called their empire ''Wilayatu 'l Mu'anamutapah'' or ''mwanamutapa'' (Lord of the Plundered Lands), or the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]]. ''Monomotapa'' was the Portuguese corruption. They did not build stone structures; the northern Shonas had no traditions of building in stone. After the death of Matope in 1480, the empire split into two small empires: [[Torwa dynasty|Torwa]] in the south and Mutapa in the north. The split occurred over rivalry from two Shona lords, Changa and Togwa, with the ''mwanamutapa'' line. Changa was able to acquire the south, forming the [[Kingdom of Butua]] with its capital at [[Khami]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153\"/><ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254\">Davidson (1991), pp. 252\u2013254.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa Empire]] continued in the north under the ''mwenemutapa'' line. During the 16th century the Portuguese were able to establish permanent markets up the Zambezi River in an attempt to gain political and military control of Mutapa. They were partially successful. In 1628, a decisive battle allowed them to put a puppet ''mwanamutapa'' named Mavura, who signed treaties that gave favorable mineral export rights to the Portuguese. The Portuguese were successful in destroying the ''mwanamutapa'' system of government and undermining trade. By 1667, Mutapa was in decay. Chiefs would not allow digging for gold because of fear of Portuguese theft, and the population declined.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 252\u2013154.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Butua]] was ruled by a ''changamire'', a title derived from the founder, Changa. Later it became the [[Rozwi Empire]]. The Portuguese tried to gain a foothold but were thrown out of the region in 1693, by Changamire Dombo. The 17th century was a period of peace and prosperity. The Rozwi Empire fell into ruins in the 1830s from invading [[Nguni people|Nguni]] from [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal]].<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254\"/>\n\n====Namibia====\n{{Main|History of Namibia}}\n[[File:Realnam.JPG|thumb|250px|Herero and Nama territories]]\nBy 1500 AD, most of southern Africa had established states. In northwestern [[Namibia]], the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]] engaged in farming and the [[Herero people|Herero]] engaged in herding. As cattle numbers increased, the Herero moved southward to central Namibia for grazing land. A related group, the [[Mbanderu people|Ovambanderu]], expanded to [[Ghanzi]] in northwestern [[Botswana]]. The [[Nama people|Nama]], a [[Khoisan languages|Khoi-speaking]], sheep-raising group, moved northward and came into contact with the Herero; this would set the stage for much conflict between the two groups. The expanding [[Lozi people|Lozi]] states pushed the [[Mbukushu]], [[Kuhane language|Subiya]], and Yei to Botei, [[Kavango Region|Okavango]], and [[Chobe District|Chobe]] in northern Botswana.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 218.</ref>\n\n====South Africa and Botswana====\n{{Main|Early history of South Africa|History of South Africa|History of Botswana}}\n\n=====Sotho\u2013Tswana=====\nThe development of [[Sotho\u2013Tswana peoples|Sotho\u2013Tswana]] states based on the [[highveld]], south of the [[Limpopo River]], began around 1000 CE.

This can be seen in the [[Toutswemogala Hill]] settlements with stone foundations and stone walls, north of the highveld and south of the [[Vaal River]]. Northwest of the Vaal River developed early [[Tswana people|Tswana]] states centered on towns of thousands of people. When disagreements or rivalry arose, different groups moved to form their own states.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\">Shillington (2005), pp. 153\u2013155.</ref>\n\n=====Nguni peoples=====\n[[File:Realzulu.JPG|thumb|250px|South African ethnic groups]]\nSoutheast of the [[Drakensberg]] mountains lived [[Nguni languages|Nguni-speaking]] peoples ([[Zulu people|Zulu]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], [[Swazi people|Swazi]], and [[South Ndebele people|Ndebele]]). They too engaged in state building, with new states developing from rivalry, disagreements, and population pressure causing movement into new regions. This 19th-century process of warfare, state building and migration later became known as the Mfecane (Nguni) or Difaqane (Sotho). Its major catalyst was the consolidation of the [[Zulu Kingdom]].<ref>Worden, Nigel.

Earlier Khoisan populations were absorbed by [[Bantu peoples]], such as the [[Sotho people|Sotho]] and [[Nguni people|Nguni]], but the [[Bantu expansion]] stopped at the region with winter rainfall. Some [[Bantu languages]] have incorporated the [[click consonant]] of the [[Khoisan languages]]. The Khoisan traded with their Bantu neighbors, providing cattle, sheep, and hunted items. In return, their Bantu speaking neighbors traded copper, iron, and tobacco.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\"/>\n\nBy the 16th century, the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a replenishing station at [[Table Bay]] for restocking water and purchasing meat from the [[Khoikhoi]]. The Khoikhoi received copper, iron, tobacco, and beads in exchange. In order to control the price of meat and stock and make service more consistent, the Dutch established a permanent settlement at Table Bay in 1652. They grew fresh fruit and vegetables and established a hospital for sick sailors. To increase produce, the Dutch decided to increase the number of farms at Table Bay by encouraging freeburgher ''[[boer]]s'' (farmers) on lands worked initially by slaves from West Africa. The land was taken from Khoikhoi grazing land, triggering the first [[Khoikhoi-Dutch Wars|Khoikhoi-Dutch war]] in 1659. No victors emerged, but the Dutch assumed a \"[[right of conquest]]\" by which they claimed all of the cape. In a series of wars pitting the Khoikhoi against each other, the Boers assumed all Khoikhoi land and claimed all their cattle. The second Khoikoi-Dutch war (1673\u20131677) was a cattle raid. The Khoikhoi also died in thousands from European diseases.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 210\u2013213.</ref>\n\nBy the 18th century, the cape colony had grown, with slaves coming from [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Indonesia]]. The settlement also started to expand northward, but Khoikhoi resistance, raids, and [[guerrilla warfare]] slowed the expansion during the 18th century. Boers who started to practice pastoralism were known as ''[[trekboer]]s''. A common source of ''trekboer'' labor was orphan children who were captured during raids and whose parents had been killed.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 213\u2013214.</ref>\n\n===Southeast Africa===\n{{Main|Southeast Africa#History}}\n\n====Prehistory====\nAccording to the theory of [[recent African origin of modern humans]], the mainstream position held within the scientific community, all humans originate from either [[Southeast Africa]] or the [[Horn of Africa]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Hua|last2=Prugnolle|first2=Franck|last3=Manica|first3=Andrea|authorlink4=Francois Balloux|last4=Balloux|first4=Fran\u00e7ois|title=A Geographically Explicit Genetic Model of Worldwide Human-Settlement History|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|date=August 2006|volume=79|issue=2|pages=230\u2013237|doi=10.1086/505436|pmid=16826514|pmc=1559480}}</ref> During the first millennium CE, [[Nilotic]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples [[Bantu expansion|moved into the region]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n====Swahili coast====\n{{Main|Swahili coast#History}}\n[[File:Swahili door Zanzibar.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A traditional Zanzibari-style [[Swahili people|Swahili]] coast door in [[Zanzibar]].]]\nFollowing the Bantu Migration, on the coastal section of Southeast Africa, a mixed Bantu community developed through contact with [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] traders, leading to the development of the mixed Arab, Persian and African [[Swahili Coast|Swahili City States]].<ref>{{cite book|author=James De Vere Allen|title=Swahili origins: Swahili culture & the Shungwaya phenomenon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_D5yAAAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=J.

The culture's earliest dated artifacts are located in the [[Kagera Region]] of [[Tanzania]], and it extended as far west as the [[Kivu]] region of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], as far east as the [[Nyanza Province|Nyanza]] and [[Western Province (Kenya)|Western]] provinces of [[Kenya]], and north into [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]. Sites from the Urewe culture date from the Early Iron Age, from the 5th century BC to the 6th century AD.\n\nThe origins of the Urewe culture are ultimately in the [[Bantu expansion]] originating in Cameroon. Research into early Iron Age civilizations in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] has been undertaken concurrently with studies on African linguistics on Bantu expansion. The Urewe culture may correspond to the Eastern subfamily of Bantu languages, spoken by the descendants of the first wave of Bantu peoples to settle East Africa. At first sight, Urewe seems to be a fully developed civilization recognizable through its distinctive, stylish earthenware and highly technical and sophisticated iron working techniques. Given our current level of knowledge, neither seems to have developed or altered for nearly 2,000 years. However, minor local variations in the ceramic ware can be observed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nUrewe is the name of the site in Kenya brought to prominence through the publication in 1948 of [[Mary Leakey]]'s archaeological findings.

The Austronesians introduced [[banana]] and [[rice]] cultivation, and the Bantu speakers introduced cattle and other farming practices. About the year 1000, Arab and Indian trade settlement were started in northern Madagascar to exploit the Indian Ocean trade.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 135.</ref> By the 14th century, [[Islam]] was introduced on the island by traders. Madagascar functioned in the East African medieval period as a contact port for the other Swahili seaport city-states such as [[Sofala]], [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]], [[Mombasa]], and [[Zanzibar]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nSeveral kingdoms emerged after the 15th century: the [[Sakalava people|Sakalava Kingdom]] (16th century) on the west coast, [[Tsitambala]] Kingdom (17th century) on the east coast, and [[Merina]] (15th century) in the central highlands. By the 19th century, Merina controlled the whole island.

[[Radama I of Madagascar|Radama I]] (1810\u20131828) invited Christian [[Missionary|missionaries]] in the early 19th century. Queen [[Ranavalona I]] \"the Cruel\" (1828\u20131861) banned the practice of [[Christianity]] in the kingdom, and an estimated 150,000 Christians perished. Under [[Radama II of Madagascar|Radama II]] (1861\u20131863), Madagascar took a French orientation, with great commercial concession given to the French. In 1895, in the second [[Franco-Hova War]], the French invaded Madagascar, taking over [[Antsiranana]] (Diego Suarez) and declaring Madagascar a [[protectorate]].<ref name=\"Lye, Keith2002. pp. 242,243\"/>\n\n====Lake Plateau states and empires====\n{{Main|History of Buganda|Karagwe District#History}}\nBetween the 14th and 15th centuries, large Southeast African kingdoms and states emerged, such as the [[Buganda]]<ref name=\"Roland Oliver 1800. pp. 24-25\">Roland Oliver, et al. \"Africa South of the Equator\", in Africa Since 1800.

Cattle herding, cereal growing, and banana cultivation were the economic mainstays of these states. The [[Ntusi]] and [[Bigo]] earthworks are representative of one of the first states, the [[Bunyoro kingdom]], which oral tradition stipulates was part of the [[Empire of Kitara]] that dominated the whole Lakes region. A [[Luo peoples|Luo]] ethnic elite, from the Bito clan, ruled over the [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking]] [[Nyoro people]].

However, very little is known about Kitara; some scholars even question its historical existence.

Kato Kintu may have migrated to the northwest of [[Lake Victoria]] as early as 1000 BC. Buganda was ruled by the ''[[Kabaka of Buganda|kabaka]]'' with a ''bataka'' composed of the clan heads. Over time, the ''kabakas'' diluted the authority of the ''bataka'', with Buganda becoming a centralized monarchy. By the 16th century, Buganda was engaged in expansion but had a serious rival in [[Bunyoro]]. By the 1870s, Buganda was a wealthy nation-state. The ''kabaka'' ruled with his ''Lukiko'' (council of ministers). Buganda had a naval fleet of a hundred vessels, each manned by thirty men. Buganda supplanted Bunyoro as the most important state in the region. However, by the early 20th century, Buganda became a province of the British [[Uganda Protectorate]].<ref>Lye, Keith (2002). pp. 121\u2013122.</ref>\n\n=====Rwanda=====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Rwanda#Pre-colonization}}\nSoutheast of Bunyoro, near [[Lake Kivu]] at the bottom of the western rift, the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]] was founded, perhaps during the 17th century. [[Tutsi]] (BaTutsi) pastoralists formed the elite, with a king called the ''[[mwami]]''. The [[Hutu]] (BaHutu) were farmers. Both groups spoke the same language, but there were strict social norms against marrying each other and interaction. According to oral tradition, the Kingdom of Rwanda was founded by Mwami Ruganzu II (Ruganzu Ndori) (c. 1600\u20131624), with his capital near [[Kigali]]. It took 200 years to attain a truly centralized kingdom under Mwami [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli IV]] (Kigeri Rwabugiri) (1840\u20131895). Subjugation of the Hutu proved more difficult than subduing the Tutsi. The last Tutsi chief gave up to Mwami [[Mutara II of Rwanda|Mutara II]] (Mutara Rwogera) (1802\u20131853) in 1852, but the last Hutu holdout was conquered in the 1920s by Mwami [[Yuhi V of Rwanda|Yuhi V]] (Yuli Musinga) (1896\u20131931).<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 123\u2013124.</ref>\n\n=====Burundi=====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Burundi#History}}\n{{Further|List of Kings of Burundi}}\nSouth of the Kingdom of Rwanda was the [[Burundian monarchy|Kingdom of Burundi]]. It was founded by the Tutsi chief [[Ntare I Kivimira Savuyimba Semunganzashamba Rushatsi Cambarantama|Ntare Rushatsi]] (c. 1657\u20131705). Like Rwanda, Burundi was built on cattle raised by Tutsi pastoralists, crops from Hutu farmers, conquest, and political innovations. Under Mwami [[Ntare IV Rutaganzwa Rugamba|Ntare Rugaamba]] (c. 1795\u20131852), Burundi pursued an aggressive expansionist policy, one based more on diplomacy than force.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 124.</ref>\n\n====Maravi====\n{{Main|Maravi}}\n[[File:Maravi Kingdom map c. 1650s.svg|thumb|right|120px|Maravi Kingdom]]\nThe [[Maravi]] claimed descent from Karonga (''kalonga''), who took that title as king. The Maravi connected Central Africa to the east coastal trade, with [[Swahili people|Swahili]] Kilwa. By the 17th century, the Maravi Empire encompassed all the area between [[Lake Malawi]] and the mouth of the [[Zambezi River]]. The ''karonga'' was Mzura, who did much to extend the empire. Mzura made a pact with the Portuguese to establish a 4,000-man army to attack the [[Shona people|Shona]] in return for aid in defeating his rival Lundi, a chief of the Zimba. In 1623, he turned on the Portuguese and assisted the Shona. In 1640, he welcomed back the Portuguese for trade. The Maravi Empire did not long survive the death of Mzura. By the 18th century, it had broken into its previous polities.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 164\u2013165.</ref>\n\n===West Africa===\n{{Main|History of West Africa}}\n\n====Sahelian empires & states====\n{{Main|Sahelian kingdoms#History of Sahel kingdoms}}\n\n=====Ghana=====\n{{Main|Ghana Empire#Origin}}\n{{see also|Serer history}}\n[[File:Ghana empire map.png|thumb|right|250px|Ghana at its greatest extent]]\nThe [[Ghana Empire]] may have been an established kingdom as early as the 8th century AD, founded among the [[Soninke people|Soninke]] by Dinge Cisse. Ghana was first mentioned by Arab geographer [[Al-Farazi]] in the late 8th century. Ghana was inhabited by urban dwellers and rural farmers. The urban dwellers were the administrators of the empire, who were Muslims, and the ''Ghana'' (king), who practiced traditional religion. Two towns existed, one where the Muslim administrators and Berber-Arabs lived, which was connected by a stone-paved road to the king's residence. The rural dwellers lived in villages, which joined together into broader polities that pledged loyalty to the ''Ghana.'' The ''Ghana'' was viewed as divine, and his physical well-being reflected on the whole society. Ghana converted to [[Islam]] around 1050, after conquering [[Aoudaghost]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 80\u201385.</ref>\n\nThe Ghana Empire grew wealthy by taxing the [[trans-Saharan trade]] that linked [[Tiaret]] and [[Sijilmasa]] to Aoudaghost. Ghana controlled access to the goldfields of [[Bambouk]], southeast of [[Koumbi Saleh]]. A percentage of salt and gold going through its territory was taken. The empire was not involved in production.<ref>Iliffe, John(2007). pp. 51\u201353.</ref>\n\nBy the 11th century, Ghana was in decline. It was once thought that the sacking of Koumbi Saleh by Berbers under the [[Almoravid dynasty]] in 1076 was the cause. This is no longer accepted. Several alternative explanations are cited. One important reason is the transfer of the gold trade east to the [[Niger River]] and the [[Taghaza]] Trail, and Ghana's consequent economic decline. Another reason cited is political instability through rivalry among the different hereditary polities.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 83.</ref>\nThe empire came to an end in 1230, when [[Takrur]] in northern [[Senegal]] took over the capital.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 173\u2013174\">Davidson (1991), pp. 173\u2013174.</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter1.shtml The Story of Africa| BBC World Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n=====Mali=====\n{{Main|Mali Empire#Pre-imperial Mali}}\n{{Further|Keita Dynasty}}\n[[File:MALI empire map.PNG|thumb|250px|Mali Empire at its greatest extent]]\nThe [[Mali Empire]] began in the 13th century AD, when a [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mande]] (Mandingo) leader, [[Sundiata Keita|Sundiata]] (Lord Lion) of the Keita clan, defeated [[Soumaoro Kant\u00e9]], king of the [[Susu people|Sosso]] or southern [[Soninke people|Soninke]], at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in c. 1235. Sundiata continued his conquest from the fertile forests and Niger Valley, east to the Niger Bend, north into the Sahara, and west to the Atlantic Ocean, absorbing the remains of the Ghana Empire. Sundiata took on the title of ''[[Mansa (title)|mansa]]''. He established the capital of his empire at [[Niani, Mali|Niani]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nAlthough the salt and gold trade continued to be important to the Mali Empire, agriculture and pastoralism was also critical. The growing of [[sorghum]], [[millet]], and rice was a vital function. On the northern borders of the [[Sahel]], grazing cattle, sheep, goats, and camels were major activities. Mande society was organize around the village and land. A cluster of villages was called a ''kafu'', ruled by a ''farma''. The ''farma'' paid tribute to the ''mansa''. A dedicated army of elite cavalry and infantry maintained order, commanded by the royal court. A formidable force could be raised from tributary regions, if necessary.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\">Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83\u201387.</ref>\n\nConversion to [[Islam]] was a gradual process. The power of the ''mansa'' depended on upholding traditional beliefs and a spiritual foundation of power. Sundiata initially kept Islam at bay. Later ''mansas'' were devout Muslims but still acknowledged traditional [[Deity|deities]] and took part in traditional rituals and festivals, which were important to the Mande. Islam became a court religion under Sundiata's son [[Uli I of Mali|Uli I]] (1225\u20131270). ''Mansa'' Uli made a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], becoming recognized within the Muslim world. The court was staffed with literate Muslims as secretaries and accountants. Muslim traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] left vivid descriptions of the empire.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\nMali reached the peak of its power and extent in the 14th century, when [[Musa I of Mali|''Mansa'' Musa]] (1312\u20131337) made his famous ''[[hajj]]'' to Mecca with 500 slaves, each holding a bar of gold worth 500 mitqals.<ref>Davidson, Basil (1971), ''Great Ages of Man: African Kingdoms'', p. 83. New York City: [[Time Life|Time Life Books]]. [[Library of Congress]] 66-25647.</ref> ''Mansa'' Musa's ''hajj'' devalued gold in [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]] for a decade. He made a great impression on the minds of the Muslim and European world. He invited scholars and architects like [[Al Sahili|Ishal al-Tuedjin]] (al-Sahili) to further integrate Mali into the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\nThe Mali Empire saw an expansion of learning and [[literacy]]. In 1285, [[Sakura (mansa)|Sakura]], a [[Freedman|freed slave]], usurped the throne. This ''mansa'' drove the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] out of [[Timbuktu]] and established it as a center of learning and commerce. The book trade increased, and book copying became a very respectable and profitable profession. Timbuktu and [[Djenn\u00e9]] became important centers of learning within the Islamic world.<ref>Davidson (1971), pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nAfter the reign of [[Suleyman (mansa)|Mansa Suleyman]] (1341\u20131360), Mali began its spiral downward. [[Mossi people|Mossi]] cavalry raided the exposed southern border. Tuareg harassed the northern border in order to retake Timbuktu. [[Fula people|Fulani]] (Fulbe) eroded Mali's authority in the west by establishing the independent [[Imamate of Futa Toro]], a successor to the kingdom of [[Takrur]]. [[Serer people|Serer]] and [[Wolof Empire|Wolof]] alliances were broken. In 1545 to 1546, the [[Songhai Empire]] took [[Niani, Mali Empire|Niani]].

He extended the empire to the north, deep into the desert, pushed the [[Mossi people|Mossi]] further south of the Niger, and expanded southwest to Djenne. His army consisted of cavalry and a fleet of canoes. Sonni Ali was not a Muslim, and he was portrayed negatively by Berber-Arab scholars, especially for attacking Muslim Timbuktu. After his death in 1492, his heirs were deposed by General [[Askia Mohammad I|Muhammad Ture]], a Muslim of Soninke origins<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 100\u2013101.</ref>\n\nMuhammad Ture (1493\u20131528) founded the [[Askiya Dynasty]], ''[[askiya]]'' being the title of the king. He consolidated the conquests of Sonni Ali. Islam was used to extend his authority by declaring [[jihad]] on the Mossi, reviving the trans-Saharan trade, and having the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid \"shadow\" caliph]] in Cairo declare him as caliph of Sudan. He established Timbuktu as a great center of Islamic learning. Muhammad Ture expanded the empire by pushing the Tuareg north, capturing A\u00efr in the east, and capturing salt-producing [[Taghaza]]. He brought the [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa states]] into the Songhay trading network. He further centralized the administration of the empire by selecting administrators from loyal servants and families and assigning them to conquered territories. They were responsible for raising local militias. Centralization made Songhay very stable, even during dynastic disputes. [[Leo Africanus]] left vivid descriptions of the empire under Askiya Muhammad. Askiya Muhammad was deposed by his son in 1528. After much rivalry, Muhammad Ture's last son [[Askia Daoud|Askiya Daoud]] (1529\u20131582) assumed the throne.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 88.</ref>\n\nIn 1591, [[Morocco]] invaded the Songhai Empire under [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] of the [[Saadi Dynasty]] in order to secure the goldfields of the Sahel. At the [[Battle of Tondibi]], the Songhai army was defeated. The Moroccans captured Djenne, Gao, and Timbuktu, but they were unable to secure the whole region. Askiya Nuhu and the Songhay army regrouped at [[Dendi Kingdom|Dendi]] in the heart of Songhai territory where a spirited guerrilla resistance sapped the resources of the Moroccans, who were dependent upon constant resupply from Morocco. Songhai split into several states during the 17th century.\n\nMorocco found its venture unprofitable. The gold trade had been diverted to Europeans on the coast. Most of the trans-Saharan trade was now diverted east to [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]]. Expensive equipment purchased with gold had to be sent across the Sahara, an unsustainable scenario. The Moroccans who remained married into the population and were referred to as ''[[Arma people|Arma]]'' or ''Ruma''. They established themselves at Timbuktu as a military caste with various fiefs, independent from Morocco. Amid the chaos, other groups began to assert themselves, including the [[Fula people|Fulani]] of [[Futa Tooro]] who encroached from the west. The [[Bambara Empire]], one of the states that broke from Songhai, sacked Gao. In 1737, the Tuareg massacred the ''Arma''.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 88-89\">Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 88\u201389.</ref><ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 100\u2013102, 179\u2013181.</ref>\n\n=====Sokoto Caliphate=====\n{{Main|Sokoto Caliphate#History}}\n[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png|thumb|300px|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]]\nThe [[Fula people|Fulani]] were migratory people. They moved from [[Mauritania]] and settled in [[Futa Tooro]], [[Fouta Djallon|Futa Djallon]], and subsequently throughout the rest of West Africa. By the 14th century CE, they had converted to [[Islam]]. During the 16th century, they established themselves at [[Macina, Mali|Macina]] in southern [[Mali]]. During the 1670s, they declared [[jihad]]s on non-Muslims. Several states were formed from these jihadist wars, at Futa Toro, Futa Djallon, Macina, [[Oualia]], and Bundu. The most important of these states was the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] or [[Fulani Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/sultanate-sokoto-sokoto-caliphate/ |title=About the Sokoto Caliphate  |last=Amy Yoo |first=Jiwon |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=1 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn the city of [[Gobir]], [[Usman dan Fodio]] (1754\u20131817) accused the Hausa leadership of practicing an impure version of Islam and of being morally corrupt.

Jihad fever swept northern [[Nigeria]], with strong support among both the Fulani and the Hausa. Usman created an empire that included parts of northern Nigeria, [[Benin]], and [[Cameroon]], with [[Sokoto]] as its capital.

During the 13th century, when the gold mines in modern-day [[Mali]] started to dry up, Bonoman and later other Akan states began to rise to prominence as the major players in the Gold trade. It was [[Bonoman]] and other Akan kingdoms like [[Denkyira]], [[Akyem]], [[Akwamu]] which were the predecessors to what became the all-powerful [[Empire of Ashanti]]. When and how the Ashante got to their present location is debatable. What is known is that by the 17th century an Akan people were identified as living in a state called Kwaaman. The location of the state was north of Lake Bosomtwe. The state's revenue was mainly derived from trading in gold and [[kola nut]]s and clearing forest to plant [[yam (vegetable)|yams]]. They built towns between the [[Pra River (Ghana)|Pra]] and [[Ofin]] rivers. They formed alliances for defense and paid tribute to [[Denkyira]] one of the more powerful Akan states at that time along with Adansi and [[Akwamu]]. During the 16th century, Ashante society experienced sudden changes, including population growth because of cultivation of [[New World]] plants such as [[cassava]] and [[maize]] and an increase in the gold trade between the coast and the north.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 139.</ref>\n\nBy the 17th century, [[Osei Kofi Tutu I]] (c. 1695\u20131717), with help of [[Okomfo Anokye]], unified what became the Ashante into a confederation with the [[Asante royal thrones|Golden Stool]] as a symbol of their unity and spirit. Osei Tutu engaged in a massive territorial expansion. He built up the Ashante army based on the [[Akan people|Akan]] state of [[Akwamu]], introducing new organization and turning a disciplined militia into an effective fighting machine. In 1701, the Ashante conquered Denkyira, giving them access to the coastal trade with Europeans, especially the Dutch. [[Opoku Ware I]] (1720\u20131745) engaged in further expansion, adding other southern Akan states to the growing empire. He turned north adding [[Techiman]], Banda, [[Gyaaman]], and [[Gonja people|Gonja]], states on the [[Black Volta]]. Between 1744 and 1745, ''Asantehene'' Opoku attacked the powerful northern state of Dagomba, gaining control of the important middle Niger trade routes. [[Kusi Obodom]] (1750\u20131764) succeeded Opoku. He solidified all the newly won territories. [[Osei Kwadwo]] (1777\u20131803) imposed administrative reforms that allowed the empire to be governed effectively and to continue its military expansion. [[Osei Kwame Panyin]] (1777\u20131803), Osei Tutu Kwame (1804\u20131807), and Osei Bonsu (1807\u20131824) continued territorial consolidation and expansion. The Ashante Empire included all of present-day [[Ghana]] and large parts of the [[Ivory Coast]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 140.</ref>\n\nThe ''ashantehene'' inherited his position from his mother. He was assisted at the capital, Kumasi, by a civil service of men talented in trade, diplomacy, and the military, with a head called the ''Gyaasehene''. Men from Arabia, Sudan, and Europe were employed in the civil service, all of them appointed by the ''ashantehene''. At the capital and in other towns, the ''ankobia'' or special police were used as bodyguards to the ''ashantehene'', as sources of intelligence, and to suppress rebellion. Communication throughout the empire was maintained via a network of well-kept roads from the coast to the middle Niger and linking together other trade cities.<ref>Davidson (1991), p. 240.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nFor most of the 19th century, the Ashante Empire remained powerful.

They began to assert their power a few years later. In so doing they established the Kingdom of Dahomey, with its capital at [[Agbome]]. King [[Houegbadja]] (c. 1645\u20131685) organized Dahomey into a powerful centralized state. He declared all lands to be owned of the king and subject to taxation. [[Primogeniture]] in the kingship was established, neutralizing all input from village chiefs. A \"cult of kingship\" was established. A captive slave would be sacrificed annually to honor the royal ancestors. During the 1720s, the slave-trading states of [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]] and [[Allada]] were taken, giving Dahomey direct access to the slave coast and trade with Europeans. King [[Agadja]] (1708\u20131740) attempted to end the slave trade by keeping the slaves on plantations producing palm oil, but the European profits on slaves and Dahomey's dependency on [[firearm]]s were too great. In 1730, under king Agaja, Dahomey was conquered by the [[Oyo Empire]], and Dahomey had to pay tribute. Taxes on slaves were mostly paid in cowrie shells. During the 19th century, palm oil was the main trading commodity.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 191\u2013192.</ref> [[French colonial empire|France]] conquered Dahomey during the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]] (1892\u20131894) and established a colonial government there.

The name comes from a [[Hausa language|Hausa]] word to refer to the [[Oyo Empire]]. The first Yoruba state was [[Ife|Ile-Ife]], said to have been founded around 1000 AD by a supernatural figure, the first ''oni'' [[Oduduwa]]. Oduduwa's sons would be the founders of the different city-states of the Yoruba, and his daughters would become the mothers of the various Yoruba ''obas'', or kings. Yoruba city-states were usually governed by an ''oba'' and an ''iwarefa'', a council of chiefs who advised the ''oba.'' by the 18th century, the Yoruba city-states formed a loose confederation, with the ''Oni'' of Ife as the head and Ife as the capital. As time went on, the individual city-states became more powerful with their ''obas'' assuming more powerful spiritual positions and diluting the authority of the ''Oni'' of Ife. Rivalry became intense among the city-states.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 131\u2013132.</ref>\n\nThe Oyo Empire rose in the 16th century. The Oyo state had been conquered in 1550 by the kingdom of [[Nupe people|Nupe]], which was in possession of cavalry, an important tactical advantage. The ''alafin'' (king) of Oyo was sent into exile. After returning, ''Alafin'' [[Orompoto]] (c. 1560\u20131580) built up an army based on heavily armed cavalry and long-service troops. This made them invincible in combat on the northern grasslands and in the thinly wooded forests. By the end of the 16th century, Oyo had added the western region of the Niger to the hills of Togo, the Yoruba of [[Ketu (Benin)|Ketu]], Dahomey, and the Fon nation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA governing council served the empire, with clear executive divisions. Each acquired region was assigned a local administrator. Families served in king-making capacities. Oyo, as a northern Yoruba kingdom, served as middle-man in the north\u2013south trade and connecting the eastern forest of [[Guinea]] with the western and central [[Sahel|Sudan]], the Sahara, and North Africa. The Yoruba manufactured cloth, ironware, and pottery, which were exchanged for salt, leather, and most importantly horses from the Sudan to maintain the cavalry. Oyo remained strong for two hundred years.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 173\u2013174\"/><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 134.</ref> It became a protectorate of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] in 1888, before further fragmenting into warring factions.

It was engaged in political expansion and consolidation from its very beginning. Under ''Oba'' (king) [[Ewuare]] (c. 1450\u20131480 AD), the state was organized for conquest. He solidified central authority and initiated 30 years of war with his neighbors. At his death, the Benin Empire extended to [[Dahomey]] in the west, to the [[Niger Delta]] in the east, along the west African coast, and to the Yoruba towns in the north.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nEwuare's grandson ''Oba'' [[Esigie]] (1504\u20131550) eroded the power of the ''uzama'' (state council) and increased contact and trade with Europeans, especially with the Portuguese who provided a new source of copper for court art.\nThe ''oba'' ruled with the advice of the ''uzama'', a council consisting of chiefs of powerful families and town chiefs of different guilds. Later its authority was diminished by the establishment of administrative dignitaries. Women wielded power. The [[Queen mothers (Africa)|queen mother]] who produced the future ''oba'' wielded immense influence.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 134\u2013135.</ref>\n\nBenin was never a significant exporter of slaves, as Alan Ryder's book Benin and the Europeans showed. By the early 18th century, it was wrecked with dynastic disputes and civil wars. However, it regained much of its former power in the reigns of Oba Eresoyen and Oba Akengbuda. After the 16th century, Benin mainly exported pepper, ivory, gum, and cotton cloth to the Portuguese and Dutch who resold it to other African societies on the coast. In 1897, the British sacked the city.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 188\u2013189.</ref>\n\n=====Niger Delta and Igbo=====\n{{Further|Igbo people#History|Kingdom of Bonny#Early history|Kalabari Kingdom#History|Kingdom of Warri#History|Kingdom of Nri#History|List of rulers of Nri}}\n{{Igbo land labelled map}}\nThe [[Niger Delta]] comprised numerous [[city-state]]s with numerous forms of government. These city-states were protected by the waterways and thick vegetation of the delta. The region was transformed by trade in the 17th century. The delta's city-states were comparable to those of the [[Swahili people]] in East Africa. Some, like [[Kingdom of Bonny|Bonny]], [[Kalabari Kingdom|Kalabari]], and [[Kingdom of Warri|Warri]], had kings. Others, like [[Brass, Nigeria|Brass]], were republics with small senates, and those at [[Cross River State|Cross River]] and [[Calabar|Old Calabar]] were ruled by merchants of the ''ekpe'' society. The ''ekpe'' society regulated trade and made rules for members known as house systems. Some of these houses, like the Pepples of Bonny, were well known in the Americas and Europe.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 136\u2013137.</ref>\n\nThe [[Igbo people|Igbo]] lived east of the delta (but with the [[Anioma]] on the west of the Niger River). The [[Kingdom of Nri]] rose in the 9th century, with the ''Eze'' Nri being its leader. It was a political entity composed of villages, and each village was autonomous and independent with its own territory and name, each recognized by its neighbors. Villages were democratic with all males and sometimes females a part of the decision-making process. Graves at [[Igbo-Ukwu]] (800 AD) contained brass artifacts of local manufacture and glass beads from Egypt or India, indicative of extraregional trade.<ref>Martin, Phyllis M. and O'Meara, Patrick(1995). p. 95.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 137.</ref>\n\n==19th century==\n\n===Southern Africa===\n{{Main|Southern Africa#History}}\nBy the 1850s, British and German missionaries and traders had penetrated present-day [[Namibia]]. [[Herero people|Herero]] and [[Nama people|Nama]] competed for guns and ammunition, providing cattle, ivory, and ostrich feathers. The Germans were more firmly established than the British in the region. By 1884, the [[German colonial empire|Germans]] declared the coastal region from the [[Orange River]] to the [[Cunene River|Kunene River]] a German protectorate, part of [[German South West Africa]]. They pursued an aggressive policy of land expansion for white settlements. They exploited rivalry between the Nama and Herero.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327\u2013329, 340\u2013342.</ref>\n\nThe Herero entered into an alliance with the Germans, thinking they could get an upper hand on the Nama. The Germans set up a garrison at the Herero capital and started allocating Herero land for white settlements, including the best grazing land in the central plateau, and made tax and labor demands. The Herero and [[Mbanderu people|Ovambanderu]] rebelled, but the rebellion was crushed and leaders were executed. Between 1896 and 1897, [[rinderpest]] crippled the economic backbone of the Herero and Nama economy and slowed white expansion. The Germans continued the policy of making Namibia a white settlement by seizing land and cattle, and even trying to export Herero labor to South Africa.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327</ref>\n\nIn 1904, the Herero rebelled. German General [[Lothar von Trotha]] implemented an [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|extermination policy]] at the [[Battle of Waterberg]], which drove the Herero west of the [[Kalahari Desert]]. At the end of 1905, only 16,000 Herero were alive, out of a previous population of 80,000. Nama resistance was crushed in 1907. All Nama and Herero cattle and land were confiscated from the very diminished population, with remaining Nama and Herero assuming a subordinate position. Labor had to be imported from among the Ovambo.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327.</ref>\n\n===Nguniland===\n{{Main|Nguni people#History}}\n[[File:Dance of Landeens.jpg|thumb|250px|Zulu warriors]]\nA moment of great disorder in southern Africa was the ''[[Mfecane]]'', \"the crushing.\" It was started by the northern Nguni kingdoms of [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]], [[Ndwandwe]], and [[Swaziland]] over scarce resource and famine. When [[Dingiswayo]] of Mthethwa died, [[Shaka]] of the Zulu people took over. He established the [[Zulu Kingdom]], asserting authority over the Ndwandwe and pushing the Swazi north. The scattering Ndwandwe and Swazi caused the Mfecane to spread. During the 1820s, Shaka expanded the empire all along the Drakensberg foothills, with tribute being paid as far south as the [[Tugela River|Tugela]] and [[Umzimkulu River|Umzimkulu]] rivers. He replaced the chiefs of conquered polities with ''indunas'', responsible to him. He introduced a centralized, dedicated, and disciplined military force not seen in the region, with a new weapon in the short stabbing-spear.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 256\u2013257, 270.</ref>\n\nIn 1828, Shaka was assassinated by his half brother [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona|Dingane]], who lacked the military genius and leadership skills of Shaka. [[Voortrekkers]] tried to occupy Zulu land in 1838. In the early months they were defeated, but the survivors regrouped at the [[Blood River|Ncome River]] and soundly defeated the Zulu. However, the Voortrekkers dared not settle Zulu land. Dingane was killed in 1840 during a civil war. His brother [[Mpande]] took over and strengthened Zulu territories to the north. In 1879 [[Anglo-Zulu War|the Zulu Kingdom was invaded]] by Britain in a quest to control all of [[South Africa]]. The Zulu Kingdom was victorious at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] but was defeated at the [[Battle of Ulundi]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 256\u2013257.</ref><ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 274\u2013275\">Davidson (1991), pp. 274\u2013275.</ref>\n\nOne of the major states to emerge from the [[Mfecane]] was the [[Lesotho|Sotho Kingdom]] founded at [[Thaba Bosiu]] by [[Moshoeshoe I]] around 1821 to 1822. It was a [[confederation]] of different polities that accepted the absolute authority of Moshoeshoe. During the 1830s, the kingdom invited missionaries as a strategic means of acquiring guns and horses from the [[Cape Province|Cape]]. The [[Orange Free State]] slowly diminished the kingdom but never completely defeated it. In 1868, Moshoeshoe asked that the Sotho Kingdom be annexed by Britain, to save the remnant. It became the British protectorate of [[Basutoland]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 261\u2013262, 271.</ref>\n\n===Sotho-Tswana===\n{{Main|Sotho people#History|Tswana people#History}}\nThe arrival of the ancestors of the Tswana-speakers who came to control the region (from the [[Vaal River]] to Botswana) has yet to be dated precisely although AD 600 seems to be a consensus estimate. This massive cattle-raising complex prospered until 1300 AD or so. All these various peoples were connected to trade routes that ran via the Limpopo River to the Indian Ocean, and trade goods from Asia such as beads made their way to Botswana most likely in exchange for ivory, gold, and rhinoceros horn.\nThe first written records relating to modern-day Botswana appear in 1824. What these records show is that the Bangwaketse had become the predominant power in the region. Under the rule of Makaba II, the Bangwaketse kept vast herds of cattle in well-protected desert areas, and used their military prowess to raid their neighbours. Other chiefdoms in the area, by this time, had capitals of 10,000 or so and were fairly prosperous. This equilibrium came to end during the Mfecane period, 1823\u20131843, when a succession of invading peoples from South Africa entered the country. Although the Bangwaketse were able to defeat the invading Bakololo in 1826, over time all the major chiefdoms in Botswana were attacked, weakened, and impoverished. The Bakololo and Amandebele raided repeatedly, and took large numbers of cattle, women, and children from the Batswana\u2014most of whom were driven into the desert or sanctuary areas such as hilltops and caves. Only after 1843, when the Amandebele moved into western Zimbabwe, did this threat subside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iexplore.com/articles/travel-guides/africa/botswana/history-and-culture|title=Botswana \u2013 History and Culture|website=www.iexplore.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Botswana.html|title=Culture of Botswana \u2013 history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|website=www.everyculture.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref>\nDuring the 1840s and 1850s trade with Cape Colony-based merchants opened up and enabled the Batswana chiefdoms to rebuild. The Bakwena, Bangwaketse, Bangwato and Batawana cooperated to control the lucrative ivory trade, and then used the proceeds to import horses and guns, which in turn enabled them to establish control over what is now Botswana. This process was largely complete by 1880, and thus the Bushmen, the Bakalanga, the Bakgalagadi, the [[Tswapong people|Batswapong]] and other current minorities were subjugated by the Batswana. Following the Great Trek, Afrikaners from the Cape Colony established themselves on the borders of Botswana in the Transvaal. In 1852 a coalition of Tswana chiefdoms led by Sechele I resisted Afrikaner incursions, and after about eight years of intermittent tensions and hostilities, eventually came to a peace agreement in Potchefstroom in 1860. From that point on, the modern-day border between South Africa and Botswana was agreed on, and the Afrikaners and Batswana traded and worked together peacefully.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramsay|first=Jeff|date=1991-01-01|title=The Batswana-Boer War of 1852\u201353: how the Batswana achieved victory|url=https://journals.co.za/content/botnotes/23/1/AJA052550590_916|journal=Botswana Notes & Records|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|issn=0525-5090}}</ref>\nIn the 1820s, refugees from the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] expansion under [[Shaka]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first= R. |year=2009|title=A Concise History of South Africa|location= Cambridge|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]}}</ref> came into contact with the Basotho people residing on the highveld.\nIn 1823, those pressures caused one group of Basotho, the [[Makololo|Kololo]], to migrate north, past the [[Okavango Swamp]] and across the [[Zambezi]] into Barotseland, now part of [[Zambia]].<ref>{{Cite web|author=Muimui, Lubosi|title=Political History of Barotseland|url=http://www.barotseland.info/POLITICAL_HISTORY_BAROTSELAND.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423171845/http://www.barotseland.info/POLITICAL_HISTORY_BAROTSELAND.html|archivedate=23 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1845, the Kololo conquered Barotseland.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Phiri, Bizeck J.|year=2005|editor=Shillington, Kevin|title=Lozi Kingdom and the Kololo|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African History, Volume II, H\u2013O|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn (Routledge)|location=New York|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=umyHqvAErOAC&pg=PA851 851\u2013852]|isbn=978-1-57958-454-2}}</ref>\n\nAt about the same time, the [[Boers]] began to encroach upon Basotho territory.<ref name=\"Ross 2009\">{{cite book|last=Ross|first= R. |year=2009|title=A Concise History of South Africa|location= Cambridge|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}.</ref> After the [[Cape Colony]] had been ceded to Britain at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, the ''[[voortrekker]]s'' (\"pioneers\") were farmers who opted to leave the former Dutch colony and moved inland where they eventually established independent polities.<ref name=\"Ross 2009\"/><ref name=\"Thompson 2001\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first= L. |year=2001|title= A History of South Africa|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofsouthaf00thom_0|url-access=registration|publisher= Yale University Press|location= Cambridge}}.</ref>\n\nAt the time of these developments, [[Moshoeshoe I]] gained control of the Basotho kingdoms of the southern Highveld.<ref name=\"Thompson 2001\"/> Universally praised as a skilled diplomat and strategist, he was able to wield the disparate refugee groups escaping the [[Difaqane]] into a cohesive nation.<ref>Becker, P.

The Khoikhoi had lost economic and political independence and had been absorbed into Boer society. The Boers spoke [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], a language or dialect derived from Dutch, and no longer called themselves Boers but [[Afrikaners]]. Some Khoikhoi were used as [[commando]]s in raids against other Khoikhoi and later Xhosa. A mixed Khoi, slave, and European population called the [[Cape Coloureds]], who were outcasts within colonial society, also arose. Khoikhoi who lived far on the frontier included the Kora, [[Oorlams creole|Oorlams]], and [[Griqua people|Griqua]].

Unlike the Khoisan, the Bantu states were not conquered by the Afrikaners, because of population density and greater unity. Additionally, they began to arm themselves with guns acquired through trade at the cape. In some cases, as in the [[Xhosa Wars|Xhosa/Boer Wars]], Boers were removed from [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] lands. It required a dedicated imperial military force to subdue the Bantu-speaking states. In 1901, the Boer republics were defeated by Britain in the [[Second Boer War]].

For 400 years, European nations had mainly limited their involvement to trading stations on the African coast. Few dared venture inland from the coast; those that did, like the Portuguese, often met defeats and had to retreat to the coast. Several technological innovations helped to overcome this 400-year pattern. One was the development of [[repeating rifle]]s, which were easier and quicker to load than [[musket]]s. [[Artillery]] was being used increasingly. In 1885, [[Hiram S. Maxim]] developed the [[maxim gun]], the model of the modern-day [[machine gun]]. European states kept these weapons largely among themselves by refusing to sell these weapons to African leaders.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 268\u2013269.</ref>\n\nAfrican germs took numerous European lives and deterred permanent settlements. Diseases such as [[yellow fever]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[yaws]], and [[leprosy]] made Africa a very inhospitable place for Europeans.

In 1854, the discovery of [[quinine]] and other medical innovations helped to make conquest and colonization in Africa possible.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 269.</ref>\n\nStrong motives for conquest of Africa were at play. Raw materials were needed for European factories. Europe in the early part of the 19th century was undergoing its [[Industrial Revolution]]. Nationalist rivalries and prestige were at play. Acquiring African colonies would show rivals that a nation was powerful and significant. These factors culminated in the [[Scramble for Africa]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 265.</ref>\n\n[[File:David Livingstone attacked by a lion in Africa. Lithograph.

It was agreed that European claims to parts of Africa would only be recognised if Europeans provided effective occupation. In a series of treaties in 1890\u20131891, colonial boundaries were completely drawn. All of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] was claimed by European powers, except for Ethiopia (Abyssinia) and [[Liberia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe European powers set up a variety of different administrations in Africa, reflecting different ambitions and degrees of power. In some areas, such as parts of [[British West Africa]], colonial control was tenuous and intended for simple economic extraction, strategic power, or as part of a long-term development plan. In other areas, Europeans were encouraged to settle, creating settler states in which a European minority dominated. Settlers only came to a few colonies in sufficient numbers to have a strong impact. British settler colonies included [[British East Africa]] (now Kenya), [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], ([[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], respectively), and [[South Africa]], which already had a significant population of European settlers, the [[Boer]]s. France planned to settle [[French Algeria|Algeria]] and eventually incorporate it into the French state on an equal basis with the European provinces. Algeria's proximity across the Mediterranean allowed plans of this scale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn most areas colonial administrations did not have the manpower or resources to fully administer the territory and had to rely on local power structures to help them. Various factions and groups within the societies exploited this European requirement for their own purposes, attempting to gain positions of power within their own communities by cooperating with Europeans. One aspect of this struggle included what [[Terence Ranger]] has termed the \"invention of tradition.\" In order to legitimize their own claims to power in the eyes of both the colonial administrators and their own people, native elites would essentially manufacture \"traditional\" claims to power, or ceremonies. As a result, many societies were thrown into disarray by the new order.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nFollowing the [[Scramble for Africa]], an early but secondary focus for most [[colony|colonial]] [[regime]]s was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade.

They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger. In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere. Across Africa the powerful new force of [[nationalism]] drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers not the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them. Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S.

Darstellung von Carl Arriens.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Ngomano]] in November 1917]]\nWith the vast majority of the continent under the colonial control of European governments, the World Wars were significant events in the geopolitical history of Africa.  Africa was a theater of war and saw fighting in both wars.  More important in most regions, the [[total war]] footing of colonial powers impacted the governance of African colonies, through resource allocation, conscription, and taxation.  In [[World War I]] there were several campaigns in Africa, including the [[Togoland Campaign]], the [[Kamerun Campaign]], the [[South West Africa campaign]], and the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African campaign]].  In each, Allied forces, primarily British, but also French, Belgian, South African, and Portuguese, sought to force the Germans out of their African colonies.  In each, German forces were badly outnumbered and, due to Allied naval superiority, were cut off from reinforcement or resupply.  The Allies eventually conquered all German colonies; German forces in East Africa managed to avoid surrender throughout the war, though they could not hold any territory after 1917. After World War I, [[List of former German colonies|former German colonies]] in Africa were taken over by France, Belgium, and the British Empire.\n\nAfter World War I, colonial powers continued to consolidate their control over their African territories.  In some areas, particularly in Southern and East Africa, large settler populations were successful in pressing for additional devolution of administration, so-called \"home rule\" by the white settlers.  In many cases, settler regimes were harsher on African populations, tending to see them more as a threat to political power, as opposed to colonial regimes which had generally endeavored to co-opt local populations into economic production.  The [[Great Depression]] strongly affected Africa's non-subsistence economy, much of which was based on commodity production for Western markets.  As demand increased in the late 1930s, Africa's economy rebounded as well.\n\nAfrica was the site of one of the first instances of [[fascist]] territorial expansions in the 1930s.  Italy had attempted to conquer Ethiopia in the 1890s but had been rebuffed in the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]].  Ethiopia lay between two Italian colonies, [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[Eritrea]] and was invaded in October 1935.  With an overwhelming advantage in [[armor]] and aircraft, by May 1936, Italian forces had occupied the capital of [[Addis Ababa]] and effectively declared victory. Ethiopia and their other colonies were consolidated into [[Italian East Africa]].\n\n===World War II: Political===\n[[File:Map of Africa in 1939.png|thumb|right|Areas controlled by European powers in 1939.

Vichy was in control until the Free French prevailed in late 1942. Portuguese (brown) and Spanish (teal) colonies remained neutral.]]\n\nAfrica was a large continent whose geography gave it strategic importance during the war. North Africa was the scene of major British and American campaigns against Italy and Germany; East Africa was the scene of a major British campaign against Italy.  The vast geography provided major transportation routes linking the United States to the Middle East and Mediterranean regions. The sea route around South Africa was heavily used even though it added 40 days to voyages that had to avoid the dangerous Suez region. Lend Lease supplies to Russia often came this way. Internally, long-distance road and railroad connections facilitated the British war effort. The Union of Africa had dominion status and was largely self-governing, the other British possessions were ruled by the colonial office, usually with close ties to local chiefs and kings. Italian holdings were the target of successful British military campaigns. The Belgian Congo, and two other Belgian colonies, were major exporters. In terms of numbers and wealth, the British -controlled the richest portions of Africa, and made extensive use not only of the geography, but the manpower, and the natural resources.  Civilian colonial officials made a special effort to upgrade the African infrastructure, promote agriculture, integrate colonial Africa with the world economy, and recruit over a half million soldiers.<ref>Ashley Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 171\u2013239.</ref><ref>David Killingray and Richard Rathbone, edfs. ''Africa and the Second World War'' (1986).</ref>\n\nBefore the war, Britain had made few plans for the utilization of Africa, but it quickly set up command structures. The Army set up the West Africa Command, which recruited 200,000 soldiers. The East Africa Command was created in September 1941 to support the overstretched Middle East Command.  It provided the largest number of men, over 320,000, chiefly from Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda. The Southern Command was the domain of South Africa. The Royal Navy set up the South Atlantic Command based in Sierra Leone, that became one of the main convoy assembly points. The RAF Coastal Command had major submarine-hunting operations based in West Africa, while a smaller RAF command Dealt with submarines in the Indian Ocean. Ferrying aircraft from North America and Britain was the major mission of the Western Desert Air Force. In addition smaller more localized commands were set up throughout the war.<ref>Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 175\u2013177.</ref>\n\nBefore 1939, the military establishments were very small throughout British Africa, and largely consisted of whites, who comprised under two percent of the population outside South Africa. As soon as the war began, newly created African units were set up, primarily by the Army.  The new recruits were almost always volunteers, usually provided in close cooperation with local tribal leaders. During the war, military pay scales far exceeded what civilians natives could earn, especially when food, housing and clothing allowances are included. The largest numbers were in construction units, called Pioneer units, with over 82,000 soldiers.. The RAF and Navy also did some recruiting. The volunteers did some fighting, a great deal of guard duty, and construction work. 80,000 served in the Middle East. A special effort was made not to challenge white supremacy, certainly before the war, and to a large extent during the war itself. Nevertheless, the soldiers were drilled and train to European standards, given strong doses of propaganda, and learn leadership and organizational skills that proved essential to the formation of nationalistic and independence movements after 1945.

With the [[fall of France]] on June 25, most of France's colonies in North and West Africa were controlled by the [[Vichy government]], though much of Central Africa fell under [[Free French]] control after some fighting between Vichy and Free French forces at the [[Battle of Dakar]] and the [[Battle of Gabon]]. After the fall of France, Africa was the only active theater for ground combat until the [[Italian invasion of Greece]] in October.  In the [[Western Desert campaign]] Italian forces from Libya sought to overrun Egypt, controlled by the British.  Simultaneously, in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African campaign]], Italian East African forces overran [[British Somaliland]] and some British outposts in [[Kenya]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].  When Italy's efforts to conquer Egypt (including the crucial [[Suez Canal]]) and Sudan fell short, they were unable to reestablish supply to Italian East Africa. Without the ability to reinforce or resupply and surrounded by Allied possessions, Italian East Africa was conquered by mainly British and South African forces in 1941. In North Africa, the Italians soon requested help from the Germans who sent a substantial force under General [[Rommel]].  With German help, the Axis forces regained the upper hand but were unable to break through British defenses in two tries at [[El Alamein]].  In late 1942, Allied forces, mainly Americans and Canadians, invaded French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]], where Vichy French forces initially surprised them with their resistance but were convinced to stop fighting after three days.  The second front relieved pressure on the British in Egypt who began pushing west to meet up with the Torch forces, eventually pinning German and Italian forces in [[Tunisia]], which was conquered by May 1943 in the [[Tunisia campaign]], ending the war in Africa. The only other significant operations occurred in the French colony of Madagascar, which was invaded by the British in May 1942 to deny its ports to the Axis (potentially the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] who had reached the eastern Indian Ocean).  The French garrisons in Madagascar surrendered in November 1942.\n\n===Post-war Africa: decolonization===\n{{further|Historical African place names|Decolonisation of Africa|Neocolonialism}}\n[[File:Africa independence dates.svg|thumb|right|250px|Dates of independence of African countries]]\n\nThe [[decolonization of Africa]] started with [[Libya]] in 1951, although [[Liberia]], [[South Africa]], [[Egypt]] and [[Ethiopia]] were already independent. Many countries followed in the 1950s and 1960s, with a peak in 1960 with the [[Year of Africa]], which saw 17 African nations declare independence, including a large part of [[French West Africa]]. Most of the remaining countries gained independence throughout the 1960s, although some colonizers (Portugal in particular) were reluctant to relinquish sovereignty, resulting in bitter wars of independence which lasted for a decade or more. The last African countries to gain formal independence were [[Guinea-Bissau]] (1974), [[Mozambique]] (1975) and [[Angola]] (1975) from Portugal; [[Djibouti]] from France in 1977; [[Zimbabwe]] from the United Kingdom in 1980; and [[Namibia]] from South Africa in 1990.

St. Charles is part of a [[Tri-Cities, Illinois|tri-city area]] along with [[Geneva, Illinois|Geneva]] and [[Batavia, Illinois|Batavia]], all western suburbs of similar size and relative socioeconomic condition.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nSt. Charles was the location of the Native American community for the chief of the [[Pottawatomie]] that inhabited the area.  A city park overlooking the river was dedicated to this Native American past.<ref>1917 [[Automobile Blue Book]] vol. c, page 274</ref> After the [[Black Hawk War]] in 1832, the entire area of the Fox Valley was opened to American settlement.  Evan Shelby and William Franklin staked the first claim in what is now St. Charles in 1833.  They came back in 1834 with their families from [[Indiana]], and were joined by over a dozen other families later that year. The township was initially known as ''Charleston'', but this name was already taken by the downstate city of [[Charleston, Illinois]] so the name of ''St. Charles'' (suggested by S. S. Jones, a lawyer) was adopted in 1839.<ref>{{cite news|title=Several Towns Named After Founders and Heroes |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/872352/kanedupage_county_il_toponym_origins/|newspaper=The Daily Herald|date=December 28, 1999|page=220|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = August 17, 2014 }} {{Open access}}</ref> St. Charles became incorporated as a city February 9, 1839 and reincorporated October 17, 1874 (under the 1870 Illinois Constitution).<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/publications/pdf_publications/ipub11.pdf|title=Data|date=July 2012 |website=cyberdriveillinois.com}}</ref>\n\n===Underground Railroad===\nThere is widespread speculation of [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery-era]] [[Underground Railroad]] stations operating in St. Charles homes, complete with tunnels and false doorways. While these claims are not historically substantiated, there was an [[Abolitionism in the United States|active abolitionist]] group operating in St. Charles around this time, called the Kane County Anti-Slavery Society. The Society was founded in 1842 and had about 180 members at its peak. The most plausible connection to the Underground Railroad in the town is the Wheeler House, built in St. Charles in 1837.\n\n===Transportation history===\nSt. Charles was a very isolated place early on in its existence. The village was located three days away from Chicago, and the Fox River was not navigable for large boats. By the 1850s, St. Charles had begun construction of a [[plank road]] to [[Sycamore, Illinois|Sycamore]] but turned down an offer by the [[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]] to construct a line through the town, which was eventually built in nearby [[Elgin, Illinois|Elgin]]. Lack of regional connections in the early years kept the town relatively small. St. Charles was without a railroad until 1871 when a branch line from Geneva was constructed, and was without a direct connection to Chicago until the 1880s with the coming of the [[Chicago Great Western Railway]].\n\n[[Tram|Streetcar]] lines along the Fox River between Elgin and [[Aurora, Illinois|Aurora]] were built through the city in 1896, operated by the [[Aurora, Elgin and Fox River Electric]] company. A direct automobile route to Chicago, which eventually became [[Illinois Route 64|Route 64]] (Main Street), was constructed in 1920. Four Illinois state routes, including Routes 64, [[Illinois Route 38|38]] (Lincoln Highway), [[Illinois Route 25|25]] (5th Avenue) and [[Illinois Route 31|31]] (2nd Street) now run through the city. Two major Kane County roads also cut through the city; [[Randall Road]] on the west side and Kirk Road on the east side.\n\n===Immigration history===\nSt. Charles was also the place of settlement for diverse groups of [[Immigration to the United States|European immigrants]], including those from [[Ireland]] and [[Sweden]] during the 1840s and 1850s, and later, groups from [[Belgium]] and [[Lithuania]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the 2010 census, St. Charles has a total area of {{convert|14.934|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|14.61|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 97.83%) is land and {{convert|0.324|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 2.17%) is water.

St. Charles is part of a [[Tri-Cities, Illinois|tri-city area]] along with [[Geneva, Illinois|Geneva]] and [[Batavia, Illinois|Batavia]], all western suburbs of similar size and relative socioeconomic condition.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nSt. Charles was the location of the Native American community for the chief of the [[Pottawatomie]] that inhabited the area.  A city park overlooking the river was dedicated to this Native American past.<ref>1917 [[Automobile Blue Book]] vol. c, page 274</ref> After the [[Black Hawk War]] in 1832, the entire area of the Fox Valley was opened to American settlement.  Evan Shelby and William Franklin staked the first claim in what is now St. Charles in 1833.  They came back in 1834 with their families from [[Indiana]], and were joined by over a dozen other families later that year. The township was initially known as ''Charleston'', but this name was already taken by the downstate city of [[Charleston, Illinois]] so the name of ''St. Charles'' (suggested by S. S. Jones, a lawyer) was adopted in 1839.<ref>{{cite news|title=Several Towns Named After Founders and Heroes |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/872352/kanedupage_county_il_toponym_origins/|newspaper=The Daily Herald|date=December 28, 1999|page=220|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = August 17, 2014 }} {{Open access}}</ref> St. Charles became incorporated as a city February 9, 1839 and reincorporated October 17, 1874 (under the 1870 Illinois Constitution).<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/publications/pdf_publications/ipub11.pdf|title=Data|date=July 2012 |website=cyberdriveillinois.com}}</ref>\n\n===Underground Railroad===\nThere is widespread speculation of [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery-era]] [[Underground Railroad]] stations operating in St. Charles homes, complete with tunnels and false doorways. While these claims are not historically substantiated, there was an [[Abolitionism in the United States|active abolitionist]] group operating in St. Charles around this time, called the Kane County Anti-Slavery Society. The Society was founded in 1842 and had about 180 members at its peak. The most plausible connection to the Underground Railroad in the town is the Wheeler House, built in St. Charles in 1837.\n\n===Transportation history===\nSt. Charles was a very isolated place early on in its existence. The village was located three days away from Chicago, and the Fox River was not navigable for large boats. By the 1850s, St. Charles had begun construction of a [[plank road]] to [[Sycamore, Illinois|Sycamore]] but turned down an offer by the [[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]] to construct a line through the town, which was eventually built in nearby [[Elgin, Illinois|Elgin]]. Lack of regional connections in the early years kept the town relatively small. St. Charles was without a railroad until 1871 when a branch line from Geneva was constructed, and was without a direct connection to Chicago until the 1880s with the coming of the [[Chicago Great Western Railway]].\n\n[[Tram|Streetcar]] lines along the Fox River between Elgin and [[Aurora, Illinois|Aurora]] were built through the city in 1896, operated by the [[Aurora, Elgin and Fox River Electric]] company. A direct automobile route to Chicago, which eventually became [[Illinois Route 64|Route 64]] (Main Street), was constructed in 1920. Four Illinois state routes, including Routes 64, [[Illinois Route 38|38]] (Lincoln Highway), [[Illinois Route 25|25]] (5th Avenue) and [[Illinois Route 31|31]] (2nd Street) now run through the city. Two major Kane County roads also cut through the city; [[Randall Road]] on the west side and Kirk Road on the east side.\n\n===Immigration history===\nSt. Charles was also the place of settlement for diverse groups of [[Immigration to the United States|European immigrants]], including those from [[Ireland]] and [[Sweden]] during the 1840s and 1850s, and later, groups from [[Belgium]] and [[Lithuania]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the 2010 census, St. Charles has a total area of {{convert|14.934|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|14.61|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 97.83%) is land and {{convert|0.324|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 2.17%) is water.

The [[Dolby Surround]]-encoded sound was a further source of acclaim.<ref name = GS_PC /><ref name = PCZ /> British magazine ''[[PC Zone]]'' described it as \"bloody good,\" with \"some modest simulation elements.\" The magazine praised the setting of the game, commenting: \"a refreshing change from the deep space of most futuristic combat sims, and something which definitely has a positive effect on gameplay.\" The review concluded by saying that \"it's as fun as it looks.

It also praised the sound and graphics, though the latter was a source of criticism: \"''Incoming'''s got it all... but it all comes at a high price: getting this game to run on our PCs was one big pain in the butt.\" Despite calling it \"an outstanding-looking and great playing game,\" IGN only gave the game a \"decent\" review score because of the system problems.<ref name=IGN_PC /> Conversely, [[GameSpot]]'s review noted none of these hardware issues, praising the visuals as \"some of the finest... of any action game\". The reviewer, however, described the game design as \"strong yet slightly flawed... [it] definitely pulls you in, but leaves a little to be desired as far as keeping you there,\" complaining that \"what [the developer] have presented gets tiresome quickly.\" The publication summarised the game as \"a fine game and a definite must-have for arcade fans... What it lacks is a realization that computer games have moved beyond this simplistic style of gameplay.\"<ref name=GS_PC />\n\nThe reception, however, was less positive when the game was [[Porting|ported]] to the Dreamcast. A release title for [[Sega]]'s console, ''IGN'' complained that the graphics were not top-of-the-range at the time of its late 1999 release, with the [[draw distance]] being cited as a specific hindrance on gameplay. ''IGN'' also said that, although the game \"is lacking in many areas, there's more than enough here for the hardcore shooting fans out there to have their requisite blast of shooting action.\" Though criticizing the graphics' ability to \"get in the way at times,\" the \"very vague\" mission briefings and the \"odd flying model for the planes,\" the reviewer conceded that \"if you're a hardcore shooting fan, and you're looking for a good challenge, you'll probably want to look into ''Incoming''.\"<ref name=IGN_DC /> [[GameSpy|PlanetDreamcast]]'s review was harsher, describing the plot as \"the same recycled garbage used in tons of other games of this type,\" the multiplayer [[split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] mode as \"lame\" and the objectives as \"mundane.\" The reviewer also noted graphical issues, clipping problems and poor controls. Though dismissing the graphics as \"a bit dated,\" the reviewer did acknowledge the \"nifty special effects\" and admitted that \"''Incoming'' may be worth a rental... [it] is only slightly better than mediocre.\"<ref name=GSPY_DC /> In a rare positive review for the Dreamcast version, ''Game Vortex'' described the visuals as \"some of the most breathtaking visuals you'll find in any game.\" Though describing the multiplayer as \"fun\", it considered \"by far, the best [mode to be] Campaign mode.\" The review concluded by describing the game as \"lots of fun and highly recommended.\"<ref name = GV_DC>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamevortex.com/gamevortex/soft_rev.php/1467/incoming-dreamcast.html | title = Incoming (DC) | author = Ashley Perkins | year = 1999 | website = Game Vortex | publisher = PS Illustrated | accessdate = June 7, 2019}}</ref> In Japan, where said console version was released under the name {{nihongo|'''''Incoming: Ginrui Saish\u016b Kessen'''''|\u30a4\u30f3\u30ab\u30df\u30f3\u30b0 \u4eba\u985e\u6700\u7d42\u6c7a\u6226|Inkamingu Ginrui Saish\u016b Kessen|lit. \"Incoming: Humanity's Final Showdown\"}}, ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it a score of 27 out of 40.<ref name=\"Fam\" />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{moby game|id=/incoming-the-final-conflict}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013112612/http://www.planetdreamcast.com/games/database/420.shtml ''Incoming''] at [[GameSpy|PlanetDreamcast]]\n\n{{good article}}\n\n[[Category:1998 video games]]\n[[Category:Alien invasions in video games]]\n[[Category:Arcade games]]\n[[Category:Dreamcast games]]\n[[Category:Imagineer games]]\n[[Category:Rage Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox video game\n|title = Incoming\n|image = incoming cover.jpg\n|caption = European Windows cover art\n|developer = [[Rage Software]]\n|publisher = {{vgrelease|EU|Rage Software|NA|[[Xicat Interactive]] (PC)|NA|[[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]] (DC)|JP|[[Imagineer (Japanese company)|Imagineer]]}}\n|designer = Scott Johnson<br>Kristian Ramsay-Jones\n|composer = Stephen Lord\n|engine = \n|released ='''Windows'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|March 23, 1998|JP|March 23, 1998|NA|July 9, 1998<ref name = IGN_PC />}}'''Dreamcast'''<br />{{vgrelease|JP|December 17, 1998<ref name = MG_RI />|EU|October 14, 1999<ref name = MG_RI>{{cite web | url = https://www.mobygames.com/game/dreamcast/incoming-the-final-conflict/release-info | title = Incoming: The Final Conflict (1998) Dreamcast Release Dates | website = [[MobyGames]] | publisher = Blue Flame Labs | accessdate = April 16, 2012}}</ref>|NA|November 30, 1999<ref name = MG_RI />}}'''Arcade'''<br />{{vgrelease|NA|April 30, 2003}}\n|genre = [[Shooter game|Shooting]], [[flight simulator]]\n|modes = [[Single-player]], [[multiplayer]]\n|platforms = [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Dreamcast]], [[Arcade game|Arcade]]\n}}\n\n'''''Incoming''''' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Shooter game|shooter]] video game developed by [[Rage Software]] and published by [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]].

The events of the game take place after an attack on the ADATA facility is initiated by alien forces.\n\nThe game is set in six locations: [[Kenya]], defending the ADATA facility; the [[Arctic]], attacking an alien base while defending a human one; the North [[Atlantic Ocean]], where the player must defend [[Oil platform|oil rig]]s and attack a second alien base; [[California]], where parts of a fleet to invade the alien's moon base must be defended; the [[Moon]], attacking a further alien base; and a planet in the [[Crab Nebula]], assaulting the planet from which the alien attackers came.\n\nIf the player has completed these in the Campaign Action mode, then in addition to these ten missions in each location, there are bonus \"virus\" scenarios, with one level in each location. Shortly before these missions, the aliens launched four virus bombs which impacted in the four location on Earth the player had previously visited. All buildings in these areas must be destroyed by the player to prevent the virus from spreading further.<ref name = manual>{{cite book | title = Incoming game manual | year = 1998 | editor = [[Rage Software]] | publisher = Rage}}</ref> [[File:Incoming Cutscene.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A cutscene using the main game engine.]]\n\n==Development==\n[[Rage Software]], developers of ''Incoming'', were known for their cutting-edge graphics and effects.<ref name = IGN_PC /> The game utilized the [[3dfx]] technology,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Arcade Games at the E3?

main [[game engine]] were noted for their quality. The [[Dolby Surround]]-encoded sound was a further source of acclaim.<ref name = GS_PC /><ref name = PCZ /> British magazine ''[[PC Zone]]'' described it as \"bloody good,\" with \"some modest simulation elements.\" The magazine praised the setting of the game, commenting: \"a refreshing change from the deep space of most futuristic combat sims, and something which definitely has a positive effect on gameplay.\" The review concluded by saying that \"it's as fun as it looks.

It also praised the sound and graphics, though the latter was a source of criticism: \"''Incoming'''s got it all... but it all comes at a high price: getting this game to run on our PCs was one big pain in the butt.\" Despite calling it \"an outstanding-looking and great playing game,\" IGN only gave the game a \"decent\" review score because of the system problems.<ref name=IGN_PC /> Conversely, [[GameSpot]]'s review noted none of these hardware issues, praising the visuals as \"some of the finest... of any action game\". The reviewer, however, described the game design as \"strong yet slightly flawed... [it] definitely pulls you in, but leaves a little to be desired as far as keeping you there,\" complaining that \"what [the developer] have presented gets tiresome quickly.\" The publication summarised the game as \"a fine game and a definite must-have for arcade fans... What it lacks is a realization that computer games have moved beyond this simplistic style of gameplay.\"<ref name=GS_PC />\n\nThe reception, however, was less positive when the game was [[Porting|ported]] to the Dreamcast. A release title for [[Sega]]'s console, ''IGN'' complained that the graphics were not top-of-the-range at the time of its late 1999 release, with the [[draw distance]] being cited as a specific hindrance on gameplay. ''IGN'' also said that, although the game \"is lacking in many areas, there's more than enough here for the hardcore shooting fans out there to have their requisite blast of shooting action.\" Though criticizing the graphics' ability to \"get in the way at times,\" the \"very vague\" mission briefings and the \"odd flying model for the planes,\" the reviewer conceded that \"if you're a hardcore shooting fan, and you're looking for a good challenge, you'll probably want to look into ''Incoming''.\"<ref name=IGN_DC /> [[GameSpy|PlanetDreamcast]]'s review was harsher, describing the plot as \"the same recycled garbage used in tons of other games of this type,\" the multiplayer [[split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] mode as \"lame\" and the objectives as \"mundane.\" The reviewer also noted graphical issues, clipping problems and poor controls. Though dismissing the graphics as \"a bit dated,\" the reviewer did acknowledge the \"nifty special effects\" and admitted that \"''Incoming'' may be worth a rental... [it] is only slightly better than mediocre.\"<ref name=GSPY_DC /> In a rare positive review for the Dreamcast version, ''Game Vortex'' described the visuals as \"some of the most breathtaking visuals you'll find in any game.\" Though describing the multiplayer as \"fun\", it considered \"by far, the best [mode to be] Campaign mode.\" The review concluded by describing the game as \"lots of fun and highly recommended.\"<ref name = GV_DC>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamevortex.com/gamevortex/soft_rev.php/1467/incoming-dreamcast.html | title = Incoming (DC) | author = Ashley Perkins | year = 1999 | website = Game Vortex | publisher = PS Illustrated | accessdate = June 7, 2019}}</ref> In Japan, where said console version was released under the name {{nihongo|'''''Incoming: Ginrui Saish\u016b Kessen'''''|\u30a4\u30f3\u30ab\u30df\u30f3\u30b0 \u4eba\u985e\u6700\u7d42\u6c7a\u6226|Inkamingu Ginrui Saish\u016b Kessen|lit. \"Incoming: Humanity's Final Showdown\"}}, ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it a score of 27 out of 40.<ref name=\"Fam\" />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{moby game|id=/incoming-the-final-conflict}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013112612/http://www.planetdreamcast.com/games/database/420.shtml ''Incoming''] at [[GameSpy|PlanetDreamcast]]\n\n{{good article}}\n\n[[Category:1998 video games]]\n[[Category:Alien invasions in video games]]\n[[Category:Arcade games]]\n[[Category:Dreamcast games]]\n[[Category:Imagineer games]]\n[[Category:Rage Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n", "name_user": "Mika1h", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incoming_(1998_video_game)"}

It was released on 3 December 1966 by [[London Records]] in the United States. With its release, the label attempted to fill a marketing gap between the Stones' studio albums and capitalise on their popularity in the US market, which was heightened that year by a notoriously successful [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1966|North American concert tour]] supporting their hit album ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966).\n\nDiscouraged by the fan hysteria accompanying the band in concert at the time, their producer and manager [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] abandoned the original idea of having the album capture the Stones in a single live performance at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Instead, he selected 10 concert recordings from other sources alongside two older studio tracks, which were [[overdubbed]] with crowd noise to give the impression of an entirely live album \u2013 all of the tracks were credited on the original LP to the Royal Albert Hall performance. The album takes it title from the Stones' [[Got Live If You Want It! (EP)|1965 UK-only live EP]], whose own name had been inspired by the 1957 [[Slim Harpo]] recording \"I've Got Love If You Want It\".\n\nThe LP sold well, reaching the number six position on the American [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' albums chart]], although the Stones later disavowed the release. Critics of the album note the poor audibility of the band amid the audience noise, but appreciate its historical and documentary value as well as the intense, high-energy quality of the performances. Rare copies of the LP \u2013 pressed in limited quantities for the European market \u2013 became highly valued by [[record collector]]s. ''Got Live If You Want It!'' has been reissued twice by [[ABKCO Records]], in 1986 on CD and in 2002 on [[Super Audio CD|SACD]].\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Kungliga Tennishallen Stones 1966a.jpg|left|thumb|[[The Rolling Stones]] in 1966]]\nIn 1966, [[the Rolling Stones]]' popularity increased dramatically with the success of their ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' LP and the singles \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?]]\". Coupled with the music's commercial impact, the band's high-energy concerts during [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1966|their North American tour in June and July]] proved highly successful with young people while alienating local police, who were tasked with [[crowd control|controlling]] the often rebellious and physically exhausting crowds. According to the Stones historians Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon, the band's notoriety \"among the authorities and [[the establishment]] seems to have been inversely proportional to their popularity among young people\".<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\nThe Stones' American record distributor, [[London Records]], wanted to capitalise on the Stones' growing popularity by marketing a new album, but were several months behind the scheduled release of their next original album, ''[[Between the Buttons]]'' (1967). A live album release was then planned for the end of 1966.<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\n== Recording and production ==\n{{quote box|quote=\"In the '60s, the Stones didn't play concerts.

As a consequence, [[popular music]] acts were subsequently banned from performing at the Hall. According to the music journalist [[Fred Bronson]], \"the concert drove home the Stones' unpopularity with members of the [[ruling class]].\"<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|page=200|title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits|publisher=[[Billboard Books]]|isbn=0823076776}}</ref>\n\nThe Stones' producer and manager, [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], abandoned the original idea in response to this \"collective hysteria generated by the group, especially among teenagers, which threatened to degenerate into rioting\", as Margotin and Guesdon describe.

Sequenced as the LP's opening track, \"Under My Thumb\" featured a passionate introduction of the group by [[Long John Baldry]], who had sung in [[Alexis Korner]]'s London-based band [[Blues Incorporated]] alongside three members of the Stones in 1962 \u2013 Jagger, rhythm guitarist [[Brian Jones]] and drummer [[Charlie Watts]]. The Stones' concert at [[Colston Hall]] in Bristol on 7 October 1966 produced the recordings of \"[[Lady Jane (song)|Lady Jane]]\", \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\", \"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?\" and \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\". According to Margotin and Guesdon, \"[[Time Is on My Side]]\" and \"I'm Alright\" were performed on 5 March and 7 March 1965 at either Regal Theatre in London, the Palace Theatre in Manchester or the Empire Theatre in Liverpool.<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\nFor the live recordings, the engineer [[Glyn Johns]] used the [[IBC Studios|IBC Mobile Unit]], the technical function of which Margotin and Guesdon say was \"not yet really suited to rock concerts\". Johns captured each show by suspending microphones from the venue's balcony.<ref name=\"Running\"/> [[Keith Richards]], the Stones' lead guitarist, remarked at the time on the difference in being recorded live, \"We all knew that the sound that we were getting live and in the studio was not what we were getting on record \u2013 the difference was light years apart.\"<ref name=\"Havers\"/>\n\nThe first of the album's two studio recordings, \"[[I've Been Loving You Too Long]]\", was cut between 11 May and 12 May 1965 at RCA Studios in Hollywood. The second, \"[[Fortune Teller (song)|Fortune Teller]]\", was taken from a 9 July 1963 session at Decca Studios in West Hampstead. According to the band's bassist [[Bill Wyman]], both studio tracks had \"crowd atmosphere added\", while even the live recordings of \"Lady Jane\", \"I'm Alright\", \"Have You Seen Your Mother\", and \"Satisfaction\" \"all benefited from various amounts of overdubs at Olympic Studios in mid-October\".<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\n== Title and packaging ==\nThe Rolling Stones conceived ''Got Live If You Want It!''{{'}}s name from the song \"I've Got Love If You Want It\", recorded in 1957 by [[Slim Harpo]], one of the band's favourite [[blues]] musicians.<ref name=\"Havers\"/> The name was first used for [[Got Live If You Want It!

The majority of his review focused instead on the moral implications of the Stones performing sleazily, as he described, for an audience presumed to be mostly adolescent and preadolescent girls, leading him to condemn the band on \"[[puritanical]]\" grounds. \"I can imagine how unpleasant a thing it would be to watch; hearing it is only slightly less so\", he concluded.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Rolling Stones: Got Live If  You Want It|last=Reilly|first=Peter|page=120|volume=18|magazine=[[High Fidelity (magazine)|HiFi]]|year=1967}}</ref>\n\n[[David Dalton (writer)|David Dalton]], in his 1972 biography on the band, considers ''Got Live If You Want It!'' in a series of Stones albums \u2013 including ''[[December's Children]]'' (1965), ''Aftermath'' and ''Between the Buttons'' \u2013 to follow their American experiences and feature \"an acceleration of R&B and rock\".

Reviewing for [[AllMusic]], [[Richie Unterberger]] approves of the album's concept but finds the resulting release to be disappointing for reasons that may or may not have been the fault of the production team \u2013 he cites the poor sound quality and the dubbing of artificial crowd noise onto a few studio recordings as [[filler (media)|filler]].

It was released on 3 December 1966 by [[London Records]] in the United States. With its release, the label attempted to fill a marketing gap between the Stones' studio albums and capitalise on their popularity in the US market, which was heightened that year by a notoriously successful [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1966|North American concert tour]] supporting their hit album ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966).\n\nDiscouraged by the fan hysteria accompanying the band in concert at the time, their producer and manager [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] abandoned the original idea of having the album capture the Stones in a single live performance at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Instead, he selected 10 concert recordings from other sources alongside two older studio tracks, which were [[overdubbed]] with crowd noise to give the impression of an entirely live album \u2013 all of the tracks were credited on the original LP to the Royal Albert Hall performance. The album takes it title from the Stones' [[Got Live If You Want It! (EP)|1965 UK-only live EP]], whose own name had been inspired by the 1957 [[Slim Harpo]] recording \"I've Got Love If You Want It\".\n\nThe LP sold well, reaching the number six position on the American [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' albums chart]], although the Stones later disavowed the release. Critics of the album note the poor audibility of the band amid the audience noise, but appreciate its historical and documentary value as well as the intense, high-energy quality of the performances. Rare copies of the LP \u2013 pressed in limited quantities for the European market \u2013 became highly valued by [[record collector]]s. ''Got Live If You Want It!'' has been reissued twice by [[ABKCO Records]], in 1986 on CD and in 2002 on [[Super Audio CD|SACD]].\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Kungliga Tennishallen Stones 1966a.jpg|left|thumb|[[The Rolling Stones]] in 1966]]\nIn 1966, [[the Rolling Stones]]' popularity increased dramatically with the success of their ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' LP and the singles \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?]]\". Coupled with the music's commercial impact, the band's high-energy concerts during [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1966|their North American tour in June and July]] proved highly successful with young people while alienating local police, who were tasked with [[crowd control|controlling]] the often rebellious and physically exhausting crowds. According to the Stones historians Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon, the band's notoriety \"among the authorities and [[the establishment]] seems to have been inversely proportional to their popularity among young people\".<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\nThe Stones' American record distributor, [[London Records]], wanted to capitalise on the Stones' growing popularity by marketing a new album, but were several months behind the scheduled release of their next original album, ''[[Between the Buttons]]'' (1967). A live album release was then planned for the end of 1966.<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\n== Recording and production ==\n{{quote box|quote=\"In the '60s, the Stones didn't play concerts.

Sequenced as the LP's opening track, \"Under My Thumb\" featured a passionate introduction of the group by [[Long John Baldry]], who had sung in [[Alexis Korner]]'s London-based band [[Blues Incorporated]] alongside three members of the Stones in 1962 \u2013 Jagger, rhythm guitarist [[Brian Jones]] and drummer [[Charlie Watts]].

According to the band's bassist [[Bill Wyman]], both studio tracks had \"crowd atmosphere added\", while even the live recordings of \"Lady Jane\", \"I'm Alright\", \"Have You Seen Your Mother\", and \"Satisfaction\" \"all benefited from various amounts of overdubs at Olympic Studios in mid-October\".<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\n== Title and packaging ==\nThe Rolling Stones conceived ''Got Live If You Want It!''{{'}}s name from the song \"I've Got Love If You Want It\", recorded in 1957 by [[Slim Harpo]], one of the band's favourite [[blues]] musicians.<ref name=\"Havers\"/> The name was first used for [[Got Live If You Want It!

In a 17 December issue, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' predicted the album would be a \"blockbuster\" and \"much in demand\", highlighting its inclusion of recent [[hit single]]s and a \"powerhouse\" performance of \"Under My Thumb\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT1|accessdate=28 March 2020|title=Album Reviews|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|via=[[Google Books]]|date=17 December 1966}}</ref> It peaked at number six on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' albums chart]] and, according to the music historian Richard Havers, \"stayed on the best-seller list for close to a year\".<ref name=\"Havers\"/>\n\n''Got Live If You Want It!'' was meant to be released only for the North American market \u2013 Margotin and Guesdon suggest this is because Decca had already released an EP of the same name in the UK,<ref name=\"Running\"/> while Bronson connects it to the aftermath of the Royal Albert Hall debacle.<ref name=\"Bronson\"/> However, Decca still [[Record press|pressed]] copies of the LP for European countries outside of the UK, including a limited shipment of copies sold in Germany and Scandinavia. According to Margotin and Guesdon, \"because of the modest volume of sales\", the LP became among the most coveted of the Stones' records for [[record collector|collectors]].<ref name=\"Running\"/> The band, however, disapproved of ''Got Live If You Want It!''{{'}}s release and have since disowned it publicly, referring to ''[[Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!

The Four Tops and The Rolling Stones|magazine=[[Crawdaddy (magazine)|Crawdaddy]]|via=[[Paste (magazine)|pastemagazine.com]]|accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref> According to the rock scholar [[Deena Weinstein]], Pearlman's review is notable for employing one of the earliest uses of the term \"metal\" in [[rock criticism]], albeit as a descriptor of the album's sound rather than as [[heavy metal music|a genre]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weinstein|first=Deena|date=12 November 2013|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19401159.2013.846655|title=Just So Stories: How Heavy Metal Got Its Name\u2014A Cautionary Tale|pages=36-51|journal=Rock Music Studies|accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref> \"On this album the Stones go metal\", Pearlman claimed. \"Technology is in the saddle \u2013 as an ideal and as a method. A mechanically hysterical audience is matched to a mechanically hysterical sound.\"<ref name=\"Pearlman\"/> He highlighted the LP's \"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?\" as an exemplar of this aesthetic:\n\n{{quote|It's a mechanical conception and realization (like all metal songs) \u2013 with the instruments and Mick's voice densely organised into hard, sharp-edged planes of sound: a construction of aural surfaces and regular surfaced planes, a planar conception, the product of a mechanistic discipline, with an emphasis upon the geometrical organization of percussive sounds.<ref name=\"Pearlman\"/>}}\n\nWriting in ''[[High Fidelity (magazine)|HiFi]]'' that same year, Peter Reilly was indifferent to the merits of the music and merely found the audio quality fair but \"echo-y\". The majority of his review focused instead on the moral implications of the Stones performing sleazily, as he described, for an audience presumed to be mostly adolescent and preadolescent girls, leading him to condemn the band on \"[[puritanical]]\" grounds. \"I can imagine how unpleasant a thing it would be to watch; hearing it is only slightly less so\", he concluded.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Rolling Stones: Got Live If  You Want It|last=Reilly|first=Peter|page=120|volume=18|magazine=[[High Fidelity (magazine)|HiFi]]|year=1967}}</ref>\n\n[[David Dalton (writer)|David Dalton]], in his 1972 biography on the band, considers ''Got Live If You Want It!'' in a series of Stones albums \u2013 including ''[[December's Children]]'' (1965), ''Aftermath'' and ''Between the Buttons'' \u2013 to follow their American experiences and feature \"an acceleration of R&B and rock\". He calls this recording in particular \"incredibly speeded up\" and \"so out of time and out of tune but so filled with Stoned energy that it just transcended criticism\".<ref>{{cite book|isbn=0825626692|last=Dalton|first=David|authorlink=David Dalton (writer)|year=1972|title=Rolling Stones|publisher=Music Sales Corp}}</ref> However, according to ''[[Stereo Review]]''{{'}}s Steve Simels in 1977, the LP \"had the distinction of being the most poorly recorded live album in history\", until Jamaican musician [[Jimmy Cliff]]'s 1976 ''In Concert'', also produced by Oldham.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Jimmy Cliff: In Concert - The Best of Jimmy Cliff|page=227|magazine=[[Stereo Review]]|volume=38|last=Simels|first=Steve}}</ref> In regards to the 1986 ABKCO CD, Mark Moses of ''[[High Fidelity (magazine)|High Fidelity]]'' observes that \"considerable cleanup\" had been done to what \"has always been an embarrassment\" in the Stones' reputation as a live act, although this is not necessarily a good thing, as Jagger is further revealed to be \"annoyingly out-of-tune with the rest of the band\" on several cuts.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Moses|first=Mark|year=1987|volume=37|issue=12|magazine=[[High Fidelity (magazine)|High Fidelity]]|page=84|title=The Rolling Stones: Got Live If You Want It!, More Hot Rocks}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alo bio 2010 Small.jpg|thumb|The production of [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] (pictured in 2010) is a major point of criticism for the album.]]\n\nLater reappraisals are also mixed. Reviewing for [[AllMusic]], [[Richie Unterberger]] approves of the album's concept but finds the resulting release to be disappointing for reasons that may or may not have been the fault of the production team \u2013 he cites the poor sound quality and the dubbing of artificial crowd noise onto a few studio recordings as [[filler (media)|filler]]. Unterberger concedes, however, that \"the album has its virtues as a historical document, with some extremely important caveats for anyone not old enough to recognise the inherent limitations in a live album of this vintage.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> Havers echoes his observation of \"the limitations\" as well as the \"fascinating glimpse\" offered into hearing the Stones live at the time.<ref name=\"Havers\"/> In ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', [[David Browne (journalist)|David Browne]] writes of the 2002 ABCKO CD, \"We fight to hear the band amid a barrage of crowd screams \u2013 yes, the Stones as teen idols \u2013 but the band still manages a biting 'Under My Thumb.'\"<ref name=\"EW\"/> Margotin and Guesdon, in ''The Rolling Stones All the Songs: The Story Behind Every Track'' (2016), acknowledge \"the screaming that blocked out the music\", but still consider the album \"a terrific document of the times, of the extraordinary, adrenaline-fueled, and often erotically charged relationship between the Stones and their fans\".<ref name=\"Running\"/> Critic [[Tom Hull (critic)|Tom Hull]] says of the record, \"All but their change-of-pace hit 'Lady Jane' are hard and sharp, including a couple of my favorites from the day.
