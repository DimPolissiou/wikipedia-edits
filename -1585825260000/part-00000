His roommate, Trimagasi, explains that they are in a tower-style facility in which food is delivered via a platform that travels from the top down through a shaft that goes through the middle of the room. The platform stops for a fixed period of time on each floor, and those on lower levels are able to eat only what those at the top leave them. If prisoners attempt to hoard food after the platform has left their level, the room will be progressively heated or cooled to fatal levels until they let go of their stash. Every month, people are randomly reassigned to a new level. It is revealed that upon admission, each resident is allowed to bring one item in with them, Goreng choosing a copy of [[Don Quixote]], and Trimagasi a self-sharpening knife. \n\nOne day, a bloodied woman named Miharu rides down on the platform, and Trimagasi explains that she descends the pit every month in search of her child. Goreng witnesses her being attacked by the two people on the level below and is initially worried for her, debating whether to jump down and help her. However, after a few minutes of overhearing the struggle, it is shown that Miharu has actually managed to kill them both, riding the platform down once again.\n\nAs they talk, it is revealed that Goreng volunteered to spend six months in the pit in exchange for a diploma, and Trimagasi is serving a year-long sentence for manslaughter. Over the course of the month, they appear to become acquainted, but on the day of the room shuffle, Goreng wakes up gagged and tied to the bed. They have been reassigned to level 171, where the platform is expected to be completely empty of food when it arrives. Trimagasi explains that he plans to cut strips of Goreng's flesh to sustain them both. On the eighth day, Trimagasi cuts into Goreng's leg but is attacked by Miharu as she comes riding down the platform. She cuts Goreng free and he kills Trimagasi. Miharu cuts some of Trimagasi's flesh, feeding Goreng and eating some herself before continuing down. \n\nThe following month, Goreng awakes on level 33 with a woman, Imoguiri, as a cellmate. The only thing she brought with her was her dog. Goreng recognizes her as the official who questioned him before sending him to the pit. She tells Goreng that she believes there are 200 floors in total, and that she was unaware of the Pit's horrible conditions and volunteered to try to fix things when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Imoguiri rations her food and attempts to convince those below to do so as well, but they ignore her until Goreng threatens to defecate in their food.\n\nGoreng encounters Miharu once again as she rides down on the platform but appears critically injured, presumably from being in a physical altercation from the above levels. Goreng and Imoguiri grab her off the platform and tend to her wounds. Miharu spends the rest of the evening recovering from her injuries and sleeping. Goreng explains to Imoguiri about Miharu's search for her child to which Imoguiri refutes the story; she explains that nobody under the age of 16 is allowed into the facility and that Miharu is in fact an actress who volunteered to enter and did so alone. \n\nGoreng awakens in the middle of the night to see Miharu and Imoguiri in a tense standoff, where it is revealed that Miharu has slaughtered and eaten Imoguiri's dog.   \n\nGoreng awakens the following month on level 202 and finds that Imoguiri has hanged herself. Goreng eats her flesh to survive, experiencing hallucinations of her and Trimagasi instructing him to do so. He is then seen awakening the following month on level 6. His roommate, Baharat, attempts to climb up and escape through the top level with the help of those above using a rope he brought into the pit. The couple living on level 5 first simulate an intention to help him, but end up defecating in his face, and pushing him back into the hole while mocking him. Estimating that there are around 250 levels in total, Goreng makes a plan to ride the platform down, rationing the food, and convinces Baharat to go with him.\n\nAs they descend, they hand out portions to the prisoners, attacking those who refuse to cooperate. Going down, they encounter Miharu fighting two other residents and try to help her, but ultimately fail to help her from getting killed, both sustaining injuries in doing so. Goreng and Baharat continue to descend and discover that the platform doesn't stop on levels where there's no one alive, eventually passing level 250 and reaching level 333 where the platform stops in an apparently empty room. Assuming that it must be the last level they get off, but the platform continues down, stranding them. They then discover a little girl in the room, who turns out to be Miharu's actual daughter, and feed her an untouched [[panna cotta]] they had been saving as a \"message\" for the chefs at the top. Goreng passes out and dreams of Baharat telling him that \"the girl is the message.\" The next day, Goreng finds Baharat dead after succumbing to his injuries, and takes the child with him when the platform arrives; they descend to the bottom of the pit where he once again sees Trimagasi, who tells him that \"the message requires no bearer.\" Goreng gets off the platform and walks away with Trimagasi, both turning to watch as the girl is transported up the pit.\n\n== Cast==\n* [[Iv\u00e1n Massagu\u00e9]] as ''Goreng'', named after ''[[:wiktionary:goreng|gor\u00e8ng]]''\n* Zorion Eguileor ([[:eu:Zorion_Egileor|eu]]) as ''Trimagasi'', named after terima kasih, which stands for \"thank you\" in Malay/Indonesian language\n* [[Antonia San Juan]] as ''Imoguiri'', named after ''[[Imogiri]]''\n* [[Emilio Buale Coka]] as ''Baharat'', named after ''[[baharat]]''\n* [[Alexandra Masangkay]] as ''Miharu'' \n* [[Eric L.

External symmetry can be easily seen by just looking at an organism. For example, take the face of a human being which has a plane of symmetry down its centre, or a pine cone with a clear symmetrical spiral pattern. Internal features can also show symmetry, for example the tubes in the human body (responsible for transporting [[gas]]es, [[nutrients]], and waste products) which are [[cylindrical]] and have several planes of symmetry. \n\nBiological symmetry can be thought of as a balanced distribution of duplicate body parts or shapes within the body of an organism. Importantly, unlike in mathematics, symmetry in biology is always approximate. For example, plant leaves \u2013 while considered symmetrical \u2013 rarely match up exactly when folded in half. Symmetry is one class of [[patterns in nature|patterns]] in nature whereby there is near-repetition of the pattern element, either by [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]] or [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]].\n\nWhile [[sponges]] and [[placozoans]] represent two groups of animals which don't show any symmetry (i.e. are asymmetrical), the [[body plan]]s of most [[multicellular organism]]s exhibit, and are defined by, some form of symmetry. There are only a few types of symmetry which are possible in body plans. These are [[rotational symmetry|radial]] (cylindrical), [[reflection symmetry|bilateral]], biradial and [[circular symmetry|spherical]] symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holl\u00f3 |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=A new paradigm for animal symmetry |journal=Interface Focus |date=2015 |volume=5 |pages=20150032 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0032}}</ref> While the classification of [[viruses]] as an 'organism' remains controversial, viruses also contain [[Icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral symmetry]].\n\nThe importance of symmetry is illustrated by the fact that groups of animals have traditionally been defined by this feature in [[Taxonomy (biology)| taxonomic]] groupings.

This is immediately obvious when looking at the jellyfish due to the presence of four [[gonads]], visible through its [[transparency and translucency|translucent]] body. This radial symmetry is [[ecology | ecologically]] important in allowing the jellyfish to detect and respond to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] (mainly food and danger) from all directions.\n\n[[File:Sterappel dwarsdrsn.jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt=Alt text|Apple cut horizontally showing that pentamerism also occurs in fruit]]\n\n[[Flowering plant]]s show five-fold symmetry, or pentamerism, in many of their flowers and fruits.

Among animals, only the echinoderms such as [[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]] are pentamerous as adults, with five arms arranged around the mouth. Being bilaterian animals, however, they initially develop with mirror symmetry as larvae, then gain pentaradial symmetry later.<ref>Stewart, 2001. pp 64-65.</ref>\n\n{{vanchor|Hexamerism}} is found in the [[coral]]s and [[sea anemones]] (class [[Anthozoa]]) that are divided into two groups based on their symmetry. The most common corals in the subclass [[Hexacorallia]] have a hexameric body plan; their [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]]s have six-fold internal symmetry and a number of [[tentacle]]s that is a multiple of six.\n\n{{vanchor|Octamerism}} is found in corals of the subclass [[Octocorallia]].

Within the [[icosahedron]] there is [[rotational symmetry | 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold symmetry]]. Many viruses, including ''[[canine parvovirus]]'', show this form of radial symmetry due to the presence of an icosahedral [[capsid|viral shell]]. Such symmetry has [[evolution | evolved]] because it allows the viral particle to be built up of repetitive subunits consisting of a limited number of structural proteins (encoded by viral [[genes]]), thereby saving space in the viral [[genome]]. The icosahedral symmetry can still be maintained with more than 60 subunits, but only in factors of 60.

Bacteria are categorized based on their shapes into three classes: cocci (spherical-shaped), bacillus (rod-shaped) and spirochetes (spiral-shaped) cells.

It is important to distinguish between the generalized use of the word 'spherical' to describe organisms at ease, and the true meaning of spherical symmetry. The same situation is seen in the description of viruses - 'spherical' viruses do not necessarily show spherical symmetry, usually they are icosahedral.\n\n==Bilateral symmetry==<!-- This section is linked from [[Brain]] -->\n{{Redirect|Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry in mathematics|reflection symmetry}}\n{{main|Bilateria}}\nOrganisms with bilateral symmetry contain  a single plane of symmetry, the [[sagittal plane]], which divides the organism into two roughly mirror image left and right halves - approximate reflectional symmetry.\n[[File:20 petit paon de nuit.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|The small emperor moth, ''[[Saturnia pavonia]]'', displays a [[deimatic]] pattern with bilateral symmetry.]]\n[[File:Ophrys apifera (flower).jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|Flower of [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] (''Ophrys apifera'') is bilaterally symmetrical ([[zygomorphic]]).

The bilateria have two axes of [[polarity in embryogenesis|polarity]]. The first is an [[anterior]]-[[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] (AP) axis which can be visualised as an imaginary axis running from the head or mouth to the tail or other end of an organism.

The front end encounters the environment before the rest of the body so sensory organs such as eyes tend to be clustered there. This is also the site where a mouth develops since it is the first part of the body to encounter food. Therefore, a distinct head, with sense organs connected to a central nervous system, tends to develop.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finnerty |first1=John R. |title=Did internal transport, rather than directed locomotion, favor the evolution of bilateral symmetry in animals? |journal=BioEssays |date=2005 |volume=27 |pages=1174\u20131180 |doi=10.1002/bies.20299}}</ref> This pattern of development (with a distinct head and tail) is called [[cephalization]].

This involves changes in the [[frequency (statistics)|frequency]] of symmetry-related genes throughout time. \n\n=== Evolution of symmetry in plants ===\nEarly flowering plants had radially symmetric flowers but since then many plants have evolved bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The evolution of bilateral symmetry is due to the [[gene expression| expression]] of ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes. Evidence for the role of the ''CYCLOIDEA'' gene family comes from [[mutations]] in these genes which cause a reversion to radial symmetry. The ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes encode [[transcription factors]], proteins which control the expression of other genes. This allows their expression to influence developmental pathways relating to symmetry<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cubas |first1=Pilar |last2=Vincent |first2=Coral |last3=Coen |first3=Enrico |title=An epigenetic mutation responsible for natural variation in floral symmetry |journal=Nature |date=1999 |volume=401 |pages=157\u2013161 |doi=10.1038/43657}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Citerne |first1=H |title=Diversity of cycloidea-like Genes in Gesneriaceae in Relation to Floral Symmetry |journal=Annals of Botany |date=2000 |volume=86 |pages=167\u2013176 |doi=10.1006/anbo.2000.1178}}</ref>. For example, in ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]'', ''CYCLOIDEA'' is expressed during early development in the dorsal domain of the flower [[meristem]] and continues to be expressed later on in the dorsal petals to control their size and shape.

This is unsurprising since asymmetry is often an indication of unfitness - either defects during development or injuries throughout a lifetime. This is most apparent during mating during which females of some species select males with highly symmetrical features. For example, [[Facial symmetry]] influences human judgements of human attractiveness.<ref name=\"Grammer1994\">Grammer, K.; Thornhill, R. (1994). Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness. Journal of comparative psychology (Washington, D.C. : 1983), 108(3), 233\u201342.</ref> Additionally, female [[barn swallow]]s, a species where adults have long tail streamers, prefer to mate with males that have the most symmetrical tails.<ref>[[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith, John]]; Harper, David (2003). ''Animal Signals''. Oxford University Press. pp. 63-65.</ref>\n\nWhile symmetry is known to be under selection, the evolutionary history of different types of symmetry in animals is an area of extensive debate. Traditionally it has been suggested that bilateral animals evolved from a radial [[ancestor]]. Cnidarians, a phylum containing animals with radial symmetry, are the most closely related group to the bilaterians. Cnidarians are one of two groups of early animals considered to have defined structure, the second being the ctenophores. Ctenophores show biradial symmetry leading to the suggestion that they represent an intermediate step in the evolution of bilateral symmetry from radial symmetry<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martindale |first1=Mark Q. |last2=Henry |first2=Jonathon Q |title=The Development of Radial and Biradial Symmetry: The Evolution of Bilaterality |journal=American Zoologist |date=1998 |volume=38 |pages=672\u2013684 |doi=10.1093/icb/38.4.672}}</ref>\n\nInterpretations based only on morphology are not sufficient to explain the evolution of symmetry. Two different explanations are proposed for the different symmetries in cnidarians and bilateria. The first suggestion is that an ancestral animal had no symmetry (was asymmetric) before cnidarians and bilaterians separated into different evolutionary [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]]. Radial symmetry could have then evolved in cnidarians and bilateral symmetry in bilaterians. Alternatively, the second suggestion is that an ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians had bilateral symmetry before the cnidarians evolved and became different by having radial symmetry. Both potential explanations are being explored and evidence continues to fuel the debate.\n\n==Asymmetry==\nAlthough asymmetry is typically associated with being unfit, some species have evolved to be asymmetrical as an important [[adaptation]]. Many members of the [[phylum]] [[Porifera]] ([[sponge]]s) have no symmetry, though some are radially symmetric.<ref>{{cite web | author=Myers, Phil | title=Porifera Sponges | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Porifera/  | publisher=University of Michigan (Animal Diversity Web) | date=2001 | accessdate=14 June 2014}}</ref>. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Symmetry breaking occurs at several different levels in order to generate the anatomical asymmetry which we observe. These levels include asymmetric gene expression, protein expression, and activity of cells.\n\nFor example, left-right asymmetry in mammals has been investigated extensively in the [[embryo]]s of mice. Such studies have led to support for the nodal flow hypothesis. In a region of the embryo referred to as the node there are small hair-like structures ([[Cilium|monocilia]]) which all rotate together in a particular direction. This creates a unidirectional flow of signalling molecules causing these signals to accumulate on one side of the embryo and not the other.

External symmetry can be easily seen by just looking at an organism. For example, take the face of a human being which has a plane of symmetry down its centre, or a pine cone with a clear symmetrical spiral pattern. Internal features can also show symmetry, for example the tubes in the human body (responsible for transporting [[gas]]es, [[nutrients]], and waste products) which are [[cylindrical]] and have several planes of symmetry. \n\nBiological symmetry can be thought of as a balanced distribution of duplicate body parts or shapes within the body of an organism. Importantly, unlike in mathematics, symmetry in biology is always approximate. For example, plant leaves \u2013 while considered symmetrical \u2013 rarely match up exactly when folded in half. Symmetry is one class of [[patterns in nature|patterns]] in nature whereby there is near-repetition of the pattern element, either by [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]] or [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]].\n\nWhile [[sponges]] and [[placozoans]] represent two groups of animals which don't show any symmetry (i.e. are asymmetrical), the [[body plan]]s of most [[multicellular organism]]s exhibit, and are defined by, some form of symmetry. There are only a few types of symmetry which are possible in body plans. These are [[rotational symmetry|radial]] (cylindrical), [[reflection symmetry|bilateral]], biradial and [[circular symmetry|spherical]] symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holl\u00f3 |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=A new paradigm for animal symmetry |journal=Interface Focus |date=2015 |volume=5 |pages=20150032 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0032}}</ref> While the classification of [[viruses]] as an 'organism' remains controversial, viruses also contain [[Icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral symmetry]].\n\nThe importance of symmetry is illustrated by the fact that groups of animals have traditionally been defined by this feature in [[Taxonomy (biology)| taxonomic]] groupings.

This is immediately obvious when looking at the jellyfish due to the presence of four [[gonads]], visible through its [[transparency and translucency|translucent]] body. This radial symmetry is [[ecology | ecologically]] important in allowing the jellyfish to detect and respond to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] (mainly food and danger) from all directions.\n\n[[File:Sterappel dwarsdrsn.jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt=Alt text|Apple cut horizontally showing that pentamerism also occurs in fruit]]\n\n[[Flowering plant]]s show five-fold symmetry, or pentamerism, in many of their flowers and fruits.

Among animals, only the echinoderms such as [[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]] are pentamerous as adults, with five arms arranged around the mouth.

Within the [[icosahedron]] there is [[rotational symmetry | 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold symmetry]]. Many viruses, including ''[[canine parvovirus]]'', show this form of radial symmetry due to the presence of an icosahedral [[capsid|viral shell]]. Such symmetry has [[evolution | evolved]] because it allows the viral particle to be built up of repetitive subunits consisting of a limited number of structural proteins (encoded by viral [[genes]]), thereby saving space in the viral [[genome]]. The icosahedral symmetry can still be maintained with more than 60 subunits, but only in factors of 60.

Bacteria are categorized based on their shapes into three classes: cocci (spherical-shaped), bacillus (rod-shaped) and spirochetes (spiral-shaped) cells.

It is important to distinguish between the generalized use of the word 'spherical' to describe organisms at ease, and the true meaning of spherical symmetry. The same situation is seen in the description of viruses - 'spherical' viruses do not necessarily show spherical symmetry, usually they are icosahedral.\n\n==Bilateral symmetry==<!-- This section is linked from [[Brain]] -->\n{{Redirect|Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry in mathematics|reflection symmetry}}\n{{main|Bilateria}}\nOrganisms with bilateral symmetry contain  a single plane of symmetry, the [[sagittal plane]], which divides the organism into two roughly mirror image left and right halves - approximate reflectional symmetry.\n[[File:20 petit paon de nuit.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|The small emperor moth, ''[[Saturnia pavonia]]'', displays a [[deimatic]] pattern with bilateral symmetry.]]\n[[File:Ophrys apifera (flower).jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|Flower of [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] (''Ophrys apifera'') is bilaterally symmetrical ([[zygomorphic]]).

The front end encounters the environment before the rest of the body so sensory organs such as eyes tend to be clustered there.

The evolution of bilateral symmetry is due to the [[gene expression| expression]] of ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes. Evidence for the role of the ''CYCLOIDEA'' gene family comes from [[mutations]] in these genes which cause a reversion to radial symmetry. The ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes encode [[transcription factors]], proteins which control the expression of other genes.

This is unsurprising since asymmetry is often an indication of unfitness - either defects during development or injuries throughout a lifetime. This is most apparent during mating during which females of some species select males with highly symmetrical features. For example, [[Facial symmetry]] influences human judgements of human attractiveness.<ref name=\"Grammer1994\">Grammer, K.; Thornhill, R. (1994).

''Animal Signals''. Oxford University Press. pp. 63-65.</ref>\n\nWhile symmetry is known to be under selection, the evolutionary history of different types of symmetry in animals is an area of extensive debate. Traditionally it has been suggested that bilateral animals evolved from a radial [[ancestor]]. Cnidarians, a phylum containing animals with radial symmetry, are the most closely related group to the bilaterians. Cnidarians are one of two groups of early animals considered to have defined structure, the second being the ctenophores. Ctenophores show biradial symmetry leading to the suggestion that they represent an intermediate step in the evolution of bilateral symmetry from radial symmetry<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martindale |first1=Mark Q. |last2=Henry |first2=Jonathon Q |title=The Development of Radial and Biradial Symmetry: The Evolution of Bilaterality |journal=American Zoologist |date=1998 |volume=38 |pages=672\u2013684 |doi=10.1093/icb/38.4.672}}</ref>\n\nInterpretations based only on morphology are not sufficient to explain the evolution of symmetry. Two different explanations are proposed for the different symmetries in cnidarians and bilateria. The first suggestion is that an ancestral animal had no symmetry (was asymmetric) before cnidarians and bilaterians separated into different evolutionary [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]]. Radial symmetry could have then evolved in cnidarians and bilateral symmetry in bilaterians. Alternatively, the second suggestion is that an ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians had bilateral symmetry before the cnidarians evolved and became different by having radial symmetry. Both potential explanations are being explored and evidence continues to fuel the debate.\n\n==Asymmetry==\nAlthough asymmetry is typically associated with being unfit, some species have evolved to be asymmetrical as an important [[adaptation]]. Many members of the [[phylum]] [[Porifera]] ([[sponge]]s) have no symmetry, though some are radially symmetric.<ref>{{cite web | author=Myers, Phil | title=Porifera Sponges | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Porifera/  | publisher=University of Michigan (Animal Diversity Web) | date=2001 | accessdate=14 June 2014}}</ref>. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Symmetry breaking occurs at several different levels in order to generate the anatomical asymmetry which we observe. These levels include asymmetric gene expression, protein expression, and activity of cells.\n\nFor example, left-right asymmetry in mammals has been investigated extensively in the [[embryo]]s of mice. Such studies have led to support for the nodal flow hypothesis. In a region of the embryo referred to as the node there are small hair-like structures ([[Cilium|monocilia]]) which all rotate together in a particular direction. This creates a unidirectional flow of signalling molecules causing these signals to accumulate on one side of the embryo and not the other. This results in the activation of different developmental pathways on each side, and subsequent asymmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hirokawa |first1=Nobutaka |last2=Tanaka |first2=Yosuke |last3=Okada |first3=Yasushi |last4=Takeda |first4=Sen |title=Nodal Flow and the Generation of Left-Right Asymmetry |journal=Cell |date=2006 |volume=125 |pages=33\u201345 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.03.002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nonaka |first1=Shigenori |last2=Shiratori |first2=Hidetaka |last3=Saijoh |first3=Yukio |last4=Hamada |first4=Hiroshi |title=Determination of left\u2013right patterning of the mouse embryo by artificial nodal flow |journal=Nature |date=2002 |volume=418 |pages=96\u201399 |doi=10.1038/nature00849}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Asymmetrical_signalling_pathways_in_a_chick_embryo.png|thumb|right|200x200px|Schematic diagram of signalling pathways on the left and right side of a chick embryo, ultimately leading to the development of asymmetry]]\n\nMuch of the investigation of the genetic basis of symmetry breaking has been done on chick embryos. In chick embryos the left side expresses genes called ''[[NODAL]]'' and ''[[LEFTY2]]'' which activate ''[[PITX2]]'' to signal the development of left side structures. Whereas, the right side does not express ''PITX2'' and consequently develops right side structures.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Raya |first1=Angel |last2=Izpisua Belmonte |first2=Juan Carlos |title=Unveiling the establishment of left\u2013right asymmetry in the chick embryo |journal=Mechanisms of Development |date=2004 |volume=121 |pages=1043\u20131054 |doi=10.1016/j.mod.2004.05.005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gros |first1=J. |last2=Feistel |first2=K. |last3=Viebahn |first3=C. |last4=Blum |first4=M. |last5=Tabin |first5=C.

For example the direction of helical growth in ''[[Arabidopsis]]'', the most commonly studied model plant, shows left-handedness. Interestingly, the genes involved in this asymmetry are similar (closely related) to those in animal asymmetry - both ''LEFTY1'' and ''LEFTY2'' play a role. In the same way as animals, symmetry breaking in plants can occur at a molecular (genes/proteins), subcellular, cellular, tissue and organ level.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mu\u00f1oz-Nortes |first1=Tamara |last2=Wilson-S\u00e1nchez |first2=David |last3=Candela |first3=H\u00e9ctor |last4=Micol |first4=Jos\u00e9 Luis |title=Symmetry, asymmetry, and the cell cycle in plants: known knowns and some known unknowns |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |date=2014 |volume=65 |pages=2645\u20132655 |doi=10.1093/jxb/ert476}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n===Biological structures===\n* [[Standard anatomical position]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of motion]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of muscle]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of bone]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy]]\n* [[Glossary of botanical terms]] \n* [[Glossary of plant morphology]] \n* [[Glossary of leaf morphology]]\n* [[Glossary of entomology terms]]\n* [[Plant morphology]]\n\n===Terms of orientation===\n* [[Handedness]]\n* [[Laterality]]\n* [[Proper right and proper left]]\n* [[Reflection symmetry]]\n* [[Sinistral and dextral]]\n* [[Direction (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Symmetry (disambiguation)]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|28em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* [[Philip Ball|Ball, Philip]] (2009).

A particular concern has been the pressure placed upon the budget and operations of both the news division of the ABC, as well as the broadcaster as a whole, owing to the decision to launch the channel without additional Government funding, as was the case with the recent launch of the children's channel ABC3 (now named [[ABC ME]]).\n\nIn Senate Estimates hearings in February 2012 the broadcaster confirmed a $2.5 million shortfall in the budget for its news and current affairs division and imposed a 1.5% cut in newsroom budgets, though denies the link to the channel, instead pointing to recent major news events in the past year such as the Christchurch earthquakes and flooding in Queensland and Victoria.<ref name=\"Meade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/media/monday-section/aunty-admits-its-news-unit-is-25m-in-the-red/story-fna1k39o-1226269096911|title=Aunty admits its news unit is $2.5m in the red|last=Meade|first=Amanda|date=13 February 2012|publisher=The Australian|accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref> However, Independent Senator [[Nick Xenophon]] has blamed the reported $20 million annual cost of the network for cutbacks in [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC TV]] sports coverage of the [[SANFL]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/abc-24-costly-for-the-sanfl/story-e6frea6u-1226278780925|title=ABC-24 costly for the SANFL|author1=Reece Homfray|author2=Miles Kemp|date=23 February 2012|work=Adelaide Now|publisher=The Adelaide Advertiser|accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the network has seen success with high viewership compared to competitor [[Sky News Australia]], with reach exceeding 2 million viewers weekly, tripling that of Sky News.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/news-24-not-hurting-main-bulletin-abc-20120308-1un58.html|title=News 24 not hurting main bulletin: ABC|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe channel's highest primetime viewership share was 9.5% during the [[2016 Australian federal election|2016 Federal election]] coverage on 2 July 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2016/07/abc-ten-lift-in-buoyant-ratings-week.html|title=ABC, TEN lift in buoyant ratings week|date=4 July 2016|accessdate=4 July 2016|first=David|last=Knox|work=[[TV Tonight]]}}</ref>\n\n== Programming ==\n[[File:News24Phillips.png|right|thumb|200px|ABC News presented by Juanita Phillips]]\n\nABC News programming consists of a mix of live news bulletins, [[time shifting|timeshifted]] repeats of existing [[ABC News and Current Affairs]] output, live broadcasts from events (such as Parliament Question Time and selected press conferences), documentaries and factual and arts programming.<ref name=sched>{{Cite news| publisher =  [[The Australian]]  | title =  24-hour party people| first = Graeme | last = Blundell | date = 3 July 2010 |page = 27 | accessdate = 3 July 2010 | url = http://theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/hour-party-people/story-e6frg8n6-1225885771317| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100812002817/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/hour-party-people/story-e6frg8n6-1225885771317| archivedate= 12 August 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> These draw upon the ABC's own resources and those of its {{citation needed span|date=November 2016|text=partner broadcasters, the [[BBC]], [[SABC]], [[TVNZ]], [[PBS]], [[NHK]], and [[Al Jazeera English]].}}\n\nOn weekdays, throughout most of the day, straight news programming is presented from one of the studios in [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]]. At 7pm ([[Time in Australia|AEST/AEDT]]), the channel features the topical debate programme ''[[The Drum (TV program)|The Drum]]'', which is also the weekdays' sole non-''hard news'' show. General rolling news continues from 8pm AEST/AEDT (only interrupted from 9:45pm to 11pm by a specialist Asian-focused business bulletin and ''[[The World (TV program)|The World]]'') before ABC News switches to the overnight format at 12:30am AEST/AEDT which features a mix of repeats of the day's programs and (usually live) news content from the partner broadcasters. Live ABC-produced news bulletins air once per hour until 4am AEST/AEDT.\n\nOn weekends, except the ''Weekend Breakfast'' news block, the channel airs a live news bulletin at the top of almost all hours, which lasts 15 or 30 minutes. Occasionally it is a one-minute headline recap. A live news hour is featured on Sundays at 7pm. ABC News switches to the overnight format at 12:15am AEST/AEDT, without any live newscast until the next morning.\n\nLive newscasters are Joe O'Brien (''ABC News Morning''), [[Ros Childs]] (midday), Gemma Veness, Kirsten Aiken and [[Patricia Karvelas]] (''Afternoon Briefing''), [[Jeremy Fernandez]] and [[Karina Carvalho]] (''ABC News Tonight''), Michael Tetlow (weekday editions of ''ABC Late News/News Overnight''), Miriam Corowa (weekends), Jason Om (''ABC News Weekend'' and weekend editions of ''ABC Late News/News Overnight''). Specialist and feature programming includes a daily business programme covering the Asia-Pacific region, a topical debate programme entitled ''The Drum'' presented by [[Julia Baird (journalist)|Julia Baird]] and [[Ellen Fanning]] and an international bulletin with [[Beverley O'Connor]] entitled [[The World (News Program)|''The World'']] presented from ABC Melbourne Studio.<ref name=\"sched\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tv.press.abc.net.au/the-drum-launches-in-prime-time-new-roles-for-patricia-karvelas-and-josh-szeps-abc-news-channel-unveils-2019-line-up|title=The Drum launches in prime-time; new roles for Patricia Karvelas and Josh Szeps; ABC NEWS channel unveils 2019 line-up|website=tv.press.abc.net.au|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref>\n\nExisting shows ''[[News Breakfast]]'' and ''[[ABC News at Noon]]'' are broadcast live on the ABC News channel at the same time as on ABC TV in AEST/AEDT time zones; viewers in the AWST and ACST time zones can choose to watch these programs either live (on the ABC News channel) or on delay in their local time (on ABC TV). In addition, ''[[The Business (TV program)|The Business]]'' is shown in an earlier timeslot than currently scheduled on ABC TV.\n\nOn 30 September 2010, the ABC announced the first new programme to be shown on the channel titled ''Capital Hill''. The political programme, originally hosted by [[Chris Uhlmann]] airs Fridays at 5:30&nbsp;pm AEST/AEDT and takes a look at the week's political events and news, as well as feature interviews with the key players of politics. It is now broadcast every weekday at 1:00&nbsp;pm AEST/AEDT and is hosted by [[Greg Jennett]].\n[[File:ABC News The World.png|200px|thumb|right|The World presented by Scott Bevan]]\n\nOvernight the ABC News channel uses \"satellite\" programming, mainly from [[BBC World News]] which mostly uses the main [[BBC News]] bulletins, as well as sometimes using shows such as [[Impact (TV programme)]] with [[Yalda Hakim]], [[Outside Source]] with [[Ros Atkins]] and [[Global Television Network|Global]] with [[Matthew Amroliwala]]. These BBC World News broadcasts come live into the ABC News channel before being broadcast around Australia. About two [[Al Jazeera English]] [[Newshour (Al Jazeera)|Newshours]] are also broadcast. However, since 2018, the overnight programming has slowly refocused on rebroadcasts of the channel's daytime live shows like ''The Drum'' and ''The World'' (on weekdays), and ABC's own live news updates have increasingly carried.<ref name=sched />\n\n=== Repeated from ABC TV ===\n\n{{div col}}\n* ''[[7.30]]''\n* ''[[Insiders (Australian TV program)|Insiders]]'' (live simulcast)\n* ''[[Offsiders]]''\n* ''[[Australian Story]]''\n* ''[[Q&A (Australian talk show)|Q&A]]'' (live simulcast)\n* ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]''\n* ''[[Landline (TV series)|Landline]]''\n* ''[[Big Ideas (Australia)|Big Ideas]]''\n* ''[[Foreign Correspondent (TV series)|Foreign Correspondent]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nAlong with other rolling news channels, the ABC News channel has been criticised for launching into rolling news coverage for \"breaking news\" where little new information supports such coverage, and just repeating limited information and footage about an event.<ref>{{cite web|last1=SIMONS|first1=MARGARET SIMONS|title=How ABC News 24 lost pace with news from Japan|url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2011/03/14/simons-abc-news-24-couldnt-keep-pace-with-news-from-japan/|website=crikey.com.au|accessdate=18 January 2015|quote=All news channels, including the ABC, played the same pictures, and the same interviews, over and over again.}}</ref> Conversely, the ABC News channel has also been criticised for not turning to rolling coverage.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Canning|first1=Simon|title=ABC news missed the boat via reruns|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/abc-news-missed-the-boat-via-reruns/story-e6frg6nf-1225971762995|website=theaustralian.com.au|publisher=The Australian|accessdate=18 January 2015|date=16 December 2010|quote=THE ABC's news channel, ABC24, has been slammed by critics for failing to recognise the scale of the Christmas Island asylum-seeker tragedy.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=SIMONS|first1=MARGARET|title=ABC News 24 runs on the smell of an oily rag|url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2011/08/15/cost-of-abc-news-24/|website=crikey.com.au|publisher=Crikey|accessdate=18 January 2015|date=15 Aug 2011|quote=And other critics (including me) have complained that the channel is too slow to switch to breaking news.}}</ref>\n\n== ABC News online ==\nThe ABC News channel can be streamed online at the ABC's website and on [[YouTube]].<ref>{{Cite news| work =  [[ABC NEWS]]  | title =  abc news 24| accessdate = 22 Jul 2010 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news24/| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100817173418/http://www.abc.net.au/news24/| archivedate= 17 August 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> However, the YouTube stream is made available internationally except for the stream in iView where it is only available in Australia only,<ref>{{Cite news| work =  ABC NEWS 24 FAQ  | title =  abc news 24 FAQ| accessdate = 22 Jul 2010 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/tv/help/default.htm| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100724054631/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/help/default.htm| archivedate= 24 July 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> and unlike other programming on iView, it is not currently offered as unmetered content by any internet service providers.

A particular concern has been the pressure placed upon the budget and operations of both the news division of the ABC, as well as the broadcaster as a whole, owing to the decision to launch the channel without additional Government funding, as was the case with the recent launch of the children's channel ABC3 (now named [[ABC ME]]).\n\nIn Senate Estimates hearings in February 2012 the broadcaster confirmed a $2.5 million shortfall in the budget for its news and current affairs division and imposed a 1.5% cut in newsroom budgets, though denies the link to the channel, instead pointing to recent major news events in the past year such as the Christchurch earthquakes and flooding in Queensland and Victoria.<ref name=\"Meade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/media/monday-section/aunty-admits-its-news-unit-is-25m-in-the-red/story-fna1k39o-1226269096911|title=Aunty admits its news unit is $2.5m in the red|last=Meade|first=Amanda|date=13 February 2012|publisher=The Australian|accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref> However, Independent Senator [[Nick Xenophon]] has blamed the reported $20 million annual cost of the network for cutbacks in [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC TV]] sports coverage of the [[SANFL]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/abc-24-costly-for-the-sanfl/story-e6frea6u-1226278780925|title=ABC-24 costly for the SANFL|author1=Reece Homfray|author2=Miles Kemp|date=23 February 2012|work=Adelaide Now|publisher=The Adelaide Advertiser|accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the network has seen success with high viewership compared to competitor [[Sky News Australia]], with reach exceeding 2 million viewers weekly, tripling that of Sky News.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/news-24-not-hurting-main-bulletin-abc-20120308-1un58.html|title=News 24 not hurting main bulletin: ABC|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe channel's highest primetime viewership share was 9.5% during the [[2016 Australian federal election|2016 Federal election]] coverage on 2 July 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2016/07/abc-ten-lift-in-buoyant-ratings-week.html|title=ABC, TEN lift in buoyant ratings week|date=4 July 2016|accessdate=4 July 2016|first=David|last=Knox|work=[[TV Tonight]]}}</ref>\n\n== Programming ==\n[[File:News24Phillips.png|right|thumb|200px|ABC News presented by Juanita Phillips]]\n\nABC News programming consists of a mix of live news bulletins, [[time shifting|timeshifted]] repeats of existing [[ABC News and Current Affairs]] output, live broadcasts from events (such as Parliament Question Time and selected press conferences), documentaries and factual and arts programming.<ref name=sched>{{Cite news| publisher =  [[The Australian]]  | title =  24-hour party people| first = Graeme | last = Blundell | date = 3 July 2010 |page = 27 | accessdate = 3 July 2010 | url = http://theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/hour-party-people/story-e6frg8n6-1225885771317| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100812002817/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/hour-party-people/story-e6frg8n6-1225885771317| archivedate= 12 August 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> These draw upon the ABC's own resources and those of its {{citation needed span|date=November 2016|text=partner broadcasters, the [[BBC]], [[SABC]], [[TVNZ]], [[PBS]], [[NHK]], and [[Al Jazeera English]].}}\n\nOn weekdays, throughout most of the day, straight news programming is presented from one of the studios in [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]]. At 7pm ([[Time in Australia|AEST/AEDT]]), the channel features the topical debate programme ''[[The Drum (TV program)|The Drum]]'', which is also the weekdays' sole non-''hard news'' show. General rolling news continues from 8pm AEST/AEDT (only interrupted from 9:45pm to 11pm by a specialist Asian-focused business bulletin and ''[[The World (TV program)|The World]]'') before ABC News switches to the overnight format at 12:30am AEST/AEDT which features a mix of repeats of the day's programs and (usually live) news content from the partner broadcasters. Live ABC-produced news bulletins air once per hour until 4am AEST/AEDT.\n\nOn weekends, except the ''Weekend Breakfast'' news block, the channel airs a live news bulletin at the top of almost all hours, which lasts 15 or 30 minutes. Occasionally it is a one-minute headline recap. A live news hour is featured on Sundays at 7pm. ABC News switches to the overnight format at 12:15am AEST/AEDT, without any live newscast until the next morning.\n\nLive newscasters are Joe O'Brien (''ABC News Morning''), [[Ros Childs]] (midday), Gemma Veness, Kirsten Aiken and [[Patricia Karvelas]] (''Afternoon Briefing''), [[Jeremy Fernandez]] and [[Karina Carvalho]] (''ABC News Tonight''), Michael Tetlow (weekday editions of ''ABC Late News/News Overnight''), Miriam Corowa (weekends), Jason Om (''ABC News Weekend'' and weekend editions of ''ABC Late News/News Overnight''). Specialist and feature programming includes a daily business programme covering the Asia-Pacific region, a topical debate programme entitled ''The Drum'' presented by [[Julia Baird (journalist)|Julia Baird]] and [[Ellen Fanning]] and an international bulletin with [[Beverley O'Connor]] entitled [[The World (News Program)|''The World'']] presented from ABC Melbourne Studio.<ref name=\"sched\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tv.press.abc.net.au/the-drum-launches-in-prime-time-new-roles-for-patricia-karvelas-and-josh-szeps-abc-news-channel-unveils-2019-line-up|title=The Drum launches in prime-time; new roles for Patricia Karvelas and Josh Szeps; ABC NEWS channel unveils 2019 line-up|website=tv.press.abc.net.au|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref>\n\nExisting shows ''[[News Breakfast]]'' and ''[[ABC News at Noon]]'' are broadcast live on the ABC News channel at the same time as on ABC TV in AEST/AEDT time zones; viewers in the AWST and ACST time zones can choose to watch these programs either live (on the ABC News channel) or on delay in their local time (on ABC TV). In addition, ''[[The Business (TV program)|The Business]]'' is shown in an earlier timeslot than currently scheduled on ABC TV.\n\nOn 30 September 2010, the ABC announced the first new programme to be shown on the channel titled ''Capital Hill''. The political programme, originally hosted by [[Chris Uhlmann]] airs Fridays at 5:30&nbsp;pm AEST/AEDT and takes a look at the week's political events and news, as well as feature interviews with the key players of politics. It is now broadcast every weekday at 1:00&nbsp;pm AEST/AEDT and is hosted by [[Greg Jennett]].\n[[File:ABC News The World.png|200px|thumb|right|The World presented by Scott Bevan]]\n\nOvernight the ABC News channel uses \"satellite\" programming, mainly from [[BBC World News]] which mostly uses the main [[BBC News]] bulletins, as well as sometimes using shows such as [[Impact (TV programme)]] with [[Yalda Hakim]], [[Outside Source]] with [[Ros Atkins]] and [[Global Television Network|Global]] with [[Matthew Amroliwala]]. These BBC World News broadcasts come live into the ABC News channel before being broadcast around Australia. About two [[Al Jazeera English]] [[Newshour (Al Jazeera)|Newshours]] are also broadcast.
