He raised the town to be the capital of the southernmost province of [[Lusitania]] (Santar\u00e9m and Braga were the other capitals of the ''conventi''). During the reign of emperor [[Augustus]] the thriving town became '''Pax Augusta'''. It was already then a strategic road junction.\n\nWhen the [[Visigoths]] took over the region, the town, then called Paca, became the seat of a [[bishop]]ric. Saint Apr\u00edgio (died in 530) became the first Visigothic [[bishop of Paca]]. The town fell to the invading [[Umayyad]] army in 713. Thus ''Paca'', through Arabic ''Baja'' ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0627\u062c\u0629}}), became ''Beja''.\n\nStarting in 910 there were successive attempts of conquest and reconquest by the Christian kings. With the collapse of the Umayyad [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] in 1031, Beja became a [[taifa]], an independent Muslim-ruled principality. In 1144 the governor of Beja ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0627\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u064a\u062a}}), Sidray ibn Wazir, helped the rebellion of the ''[[Mur\u012bd\u016bn]]'' (disciples) led by Abul-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn al-Quasi in the [[Algarve]] against power of [[Seville]]. In 1150 the town was captured by an army of the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohads]], who annexed it to their North African empire. It was retaken in 1162 by Fern\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves, leading the army of the Portuguese king [[Afonso I]]. In 1175 Beja was recaptured again by the Almohads. It stayed under Muslim rule till 1234 when king [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]] finally recaptured the town from the Moors.\n\nAll these wars depopulated the town and gradually reduced it to rubble. Only with [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] in 1521 did Beja again reach the status of city. It was attacked and occupied by the Portuguese and the Spanish armies during the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] (1640\u20131667).\n\nBeja became again the head of a [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Beja|bishopric]] in 1770, more than a thousand years after the fall of the Visigothic city. In 1808 [[Napoleon]]ic troops under General [[Jean-Andoche Junot|Junot]] sacked the city and massacred the inhabitants.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Climate===\nDue to its southernmost location with the descending winds of the subtropics, low precipitation, especially in summer and far from the coast makes the city a [[Mediterranean climate|hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Csa'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=85620&cityname=Beja,+Portugal|title=Beja, Portugal K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-04-20}}</ref> and therefore is the hottest city of [[Portugal]] and one of the hottest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the maximum temperatures.

It was built, together with the town walls, under the reign of King [[Denis of Portugal|Diniz]] in the 13th century over the remains of a Roman ''castellum'' that had been fortified by the [[Moors]]. It consists of [[battlement]] walls with four square corner towers and a central granite and marble [[keep]] (''Torre de Menagem''), with its height of 40 m the highest in Portugal. The top of the keep can be accessed via a spiral staircase with 197 steps, passing three [[Rib vault|stellar-vault]]ed rooms with [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] windows. The [[merlon]]s of the [[machicolation]] around the keep are topped with small pyramids. Standing on the battlements, one has a sensational panorama of the surrounding landscape. One can also glimpse the remains of the city walls that once had forty [[turret]]s and five gates. The castle now houses a small military museum.\n\nThe square in front of the castle is named after [[Gon\u00e7alo Mendes da Maia]] or ''O Lidador'', a brave knight killed in the battle against the Moors in 1170.\n\n===Visigothic Museum===\nThe whitewashed Latin-Visigothic church of Santo Amaro, dedicated to [[Saint Amaro]], standing next to the castle, is one of just four pre-Romanesque churches left in Portugal. Some parts date from the 6th century and the interior columns and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] are carved with foliages and geometric designs from the 7th century. Especially the column with birds attacking a snake is of particular note. It houses today a small archaeological museum with Visigothic art.\n\n===Museum of [[Eleanor of Viseu|Queen Eleanor]]===\nThis regional museum was set up in 1927 and 1928 in the former Convent of Our Lady of the Conception (''Convento de Nossa Senhora da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o'') of the [[Order of Poor Ladies]] (dissolved in 1834), gradually expanding its collection. This [[Franciscan]] convent had been established in 1459 by [[Infante Fernando, Duke of Viseu]] and duke of Beja, next to his ducal palace. The construction continued until 1509.\n\nIt is an impressive building with a late-[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] lattice-worked [[architrave]] running along the building. This elegant architrave resembles somewhat the architrave of the [[Monastery of Batalha]], even if there are some early-[[Manueline]] influences. Above the entrance porch on the western fa\u00e7ade one can see the ''ajimez'' window (a [[mullion]]ed window in Manueline and Moorish style) in the room of the [[abbess]], originating from the demolished palace of the dukes of Beja. The entrance door is embedded under an [[ogee]] arch. A square bell-tower and a [[spire]] with [[crocket]]s tower above the complex. The convent has been classified as a national monument.\n\nThe entrance hall leads to the sumptuously gilded [[Baroque]] chapel, consisting of a single nave under a semi-circular [[vault (architecture)|vault]]. Three altars (one of the 17th century, dedicated to St. John the Evangelist, and two of the 18th century, dedicated to St. Christopher and St. Bento) are decorated with gilded woodwork (''talha dourada''). The fourth altar, dedicated to St. [[John the Baptist]], was decorated with Florentine mosaics by Jos\u00e9 Ramalho in 1695.\n\nOn the wall are three religious [[azulejo]]s dating from 1741, depicting scenes from the life of St. John the Baptist\n\nThe refectory and the ''claustro'' are decorated with exquisite ''azulejos'', some dating from Moorish times, others from the 16th to the 18th centuries.\n\nOne enters the [[chapter house]] through a Manueline portal from the ''quadra'' of St. John the Evangelist. The ribbed vault of this square room was [[Painterwork|distempered]] during the renovations of 1727. The walls are covered with Arab-Hispanic azulejos with geometric and vegetal designs that are among the most important ceramic decorations in Portugal. Above the azulejos are some semicircular distempered paintings with religious themes: [[St. John the Baptist]], [[St. John the Evangelist]], [[St. Christopher]], [[Clare of Assisi|St. Clare]] and [[St. Francis of Assisi]].\n\nThe museum houses also an important collection of Flemish, Spanish and Portuguese paintings from the 15th to the 18th centuries, among them:\n\n* Flemish paintings: ''[[:Image:Beja41.jpg|''Virgin with Milk]]''; Flemish School (c. 1530) and \"Christ and His Apostles\" (16th century)\n* Portuguese paintings: ''[[:File:Ecce homo - seculo xv - portugal.jpg|Ecce Homo]]'' (15th century), \"[[Vincent of Saragossa|St. Vincent]] by Vicente Gil and Manuel Vicente (16th century), \"Virgin with the Rose\" by Francisco Campos (16th century), \"Mass of St. Gregory\" probably by [[Greg\u00f3rio Lopes]] (16th century), \"Annunciation\" (16th century) and four paintings by Ant\u00f3nio Nogueira (16th century), \"Last Supper\" by Pedro Alexandrino (17th century).\n* Spanish paintings: ''[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]'', ''[[:File:Beja36.jpg|St. Jerome]]'' and \"Martyrdom of St. Bartholomew\" by [[Jos\u00e9 de Ribera]] (Spanish, 17th century), ''[[:File:Beja33.jpg|Head of Saint John the Baptist]]'' (Spanish School, 17th century)\n\nThe museum houses also the funeral monuments in late-Gothic style of the first abbess D. Uganda and of the [[Infante Fernando, Duke of Viseu]] and his wife Beatriz of Portugal.\n\nThe archaeological collection of Fernando Nunes Ribeiro, donated to museum in 1987 after forty years of archaeological research, is on display on the upper floors: Visigothic and Roman artefacts, gravestones from the [[Bronze Age]] with antique writings of the [[Iberians]] and [[stele]]s from the [[Iron Age]].\n\nAmong the several other artefacts in its collection, the museum possesses the ''Escudela de Pero de Faria'', a unique piece of Chinese porcelain from 1541.\n\n==Notable citizens==\n* [[Ant\u00f3nio Raposo Tavares]], ''O Velho'' (S\u00e3o Miguel do Pinheiro, [[Mertola]]; 1598 \u2013 S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; 1658), a Portuguese colonial [[bandeirante]] who explored the eastern coast of South America (claiming it for Portugal) and extending the territory of the Portuguese colony beyond the limits imposed by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]];\n* [[Mariana Alcoforado]] (Santa Maria da Feira, Beja, 22 April 1640 \u2013 Beja, 28 July 1723), 17th century Portuguese nun who, purportedly, wrote the ''[[Letters of a Portuguese Nun]]'' (comprising five letters), that detailed her affair with French officer No\u00ebl Bouton (Marquis de Chamilly and, later, Marshal of France). In the story, the nun glimpsed the young officer only once from her window in 1641, while he was campaigning against the Spanish army in the [[Alentejo]]. She fell in love at once and wrote him five passionate letters. Although the Portuguese letters disappeared, they were \"translated\" into French and published in [[Brussels]] in 1669 (and later into several languages). The lyrical composition is full of absolute passion, hope, pleas and despair and were an instant literary success, resulting in the popularity of this style (coining the term ''portugaise'' becoming synonymous for \"passionate love letter\").\n* [[Gon\u00e7alo Mendes da Maia]] ''O Lidador'' (Maia, 1079 \u2013 Alentejo, 1170), Portuguese knight in the service of [[Afonso Henriques]], responsible for border defense in the region of Beja.\n* [[Pedro Caixinha]] Football manager currently with [[Cruz Azul]]\n\n== References ==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{citation |title=The Rough Guide to Portugal |edition=11 |date= 1 March 2005 |isbn=1-84353-438-X}}\n* {{citation |last=Rentes de Carvalho |first=J. |title=Portugal, um guia para amigos |language=Dutch |publisher=Arbeiderspers |location=Amsterdam, Netherlands |edition=9 |date=1 August 1999 |isbn=90-295-3466-4}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Lefcourt |first=Charles R. |title = Did Guilleragues Write \"The Portuguese Letters\"? |journal=Hispania |volume = 59 |issue=3 |date=September 1976 |pages = 493\u2013497 |doi = 10.2307/340526 |jstor = 340526}}\n* {{cite journal|author = Owen, Hilary|title = The Love Letters of Mariana Alcoforado|journal = Cultura| volume= 16|issue = 14|year = 1997}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portal|Portugal}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Beja}}\n{{Commons category|Beja}}\n* [http://www.cm-beja.pt/ Town Hall official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061223011536/http://www.museuregionaldebeja.net/ Museum Queen Eleanor] (in Portuguese)\n* [https://ordemdocarmo.wixsite.com/carmelobeja Carmel of Beja] (in Portuguese)\n\n{{Municipalities of Beja}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Beja, Portugal| ]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Beja District]]\n[[Category:Burial sites of the House of Aviz]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of Beja District]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Portuguese subdivision\n| type            = municipality\n| official_name   = Beja\n| image_flag      = Pt-bja1.png\n| image_shield    = BJA.png\n| image_skyline           = {{Photomontage\n| photo1a                 = Castelo de Beja 2 (cropped).JPG\n| photo2a                 = Beja Nostra Senora de Concei\u00e7ao.JPG\n| photo2b                 = Castelo de Beja - Muralha interior (cropped).jpg\n| photo3a                 = Beja Torre de Menagem.jpg\n| photo3b                 = Pra\u00e7a da Republica, Beja (1) (cropped).jpg\n| photo3c                 = Beja-37-1-stmaria-feira (cropped).jpg\n| spacing                 = 2\n| position                = center\n| color_border            = white\n| color                   = white\n| size                    = 280\n| foot_montage            =\n}}\n|coordinates             = {{coord|38|02|N|7|53|W|type:adm1st_region:PT_dim:100000|display=inline,title}}\n| image_map       = LocalBeja.svg\n|region             = [[Alentejo]]\n|CIM                = [[Baixo Alentejo (intermunicipal community)|Baixo Alentejo]]\n|district           = [[Beja District|Beja]]\n|parishes           = [[#Parishes|11]]\n| leader_party            = [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|PS]]\n<!-- *** Codes ***  -->\n| leader_name             = Paulo Ars\u00e9nio\n| area_total_km2          = 1146.44\n| population_total        = 35,854\n| population_as_of        = 2011\n| holiday        = [[Ascension Day]] (date varies)\n| website                 = http://www.cm-beja.pt\n}}\n'''Beja''' ({{IPA-pt|\u02c8b\u025b\u0292\u0250|-|Pt-pt Beja FF.ogg}}) is a city and a [[List of municipalities of Portugal|municipality]] in the [[Alentejo]] region, Portugal.

He raised the town to be the capital of the southernmost province of [[Lusitania]] (Santar\u00e9m and Braga were the other capitals of the ''conventi''). During the reign of emperor [[Augustus]] the thriving town became '''Pax Augusta'''. It was already then a strategic road junction.\n\nWhen the [[Visigoths]] took over the region, the town, then called Paca, became the seat of a [[bishop]]ric. Saint Apr\u00edgio (died in 530) became the first Visigothic [[bishop of Paca]]. The town fell to the invading [[Umayyad]] army in 713. Thus ''Paca'', through Arabic ''Baja'' ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0627\u062c\u0629}}), became ''Beja''.\n\nStarting in 910 there were successive attempts of conquest and reconquest by the Christian kings. With the collapse of the Umayyad [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] in 1031, Beja became a [[taifa]], an independent Muslim-ruled principality. In 1144 the governor of Beja ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0627\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u064a\u062a}}), Sidray ibn Wazir, helped the rebellion of the ''[[Mur\u012bd\u016bn]]'' (disciples) led by Abul-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn al-Quasi in the [[Algarve]] against power of [[Seville]]. In 1150 the town was captured by an army of the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohads]], who annexed it to their North African empire. It was retaken in 1162 by Fern\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves, leading the army of the Portuguese king [[Afonso I]]. In 1175 Beja was recaptured again by the Almohads. It stayed under Muslim rule till 1234 when king [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]] finally recaptured the town from the Moors.\n\nAll these wars depopulated the town and gradually reduced it to rubble. Only with [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] in 1521 did Beja again reach the status of city. It was attacked and occupied by the Portuguese and the Spanish armies during the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] (1640\u20131667).\n\nBeja became again the head of a [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Beja|bishopric]] in 1770, more than a thousand years after the fall of the Visigothic city. In 1808 [[Napoleon]]ic troops under General [[Jean-Andoche Junot|Junot]] sacked the city and massacred the inhabitants.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Climate===\nDue to its southernmost location with the descending winds of the subtropics, low precipitation, especially in summer and far from the coast makes the city a [[Mediterranean climate|hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Csa'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=85620&cityname=Beja,+Portugal|title=Beja, Portugal K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-04-20}}</ref> and therefore is the hottest city of [[Portugal]] and one of the hottest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the maximum temperatures.

It was built, together with the town walls, under the reign of King [[Denis of Portugal|Diniz]] in the 13th century over the remains of a Roman ''castellum'' that had been fortified by the [[Moors]]. It consists of [[battlement]] walls with four square corner towers and a central granite and marble [[keep]] (''Torre de Menagem''), with its height of 40 m the highest in Portugal. The top of the keep can be accessed via a spiral staircase with 197 steps, passing three [[Rib vault|stellar-vault]]ed rooms with [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] windows. The [[merlon]]s of the [[machicolation]] around the keep are topped with small pyramids. Standing on the battlements, one has a sensational panorama of the surrounding landscape. One can also glimpse the remains of the city walls that once had forty [[turret]]s and five gates. The castle now houses a small military museum.\n\nThe square in front of the castle is named after [[Gon\u00e7alo Mendes da Maia]] or ''O Lidador'', a brave knight killed in the battle against the Moors in 1170.\n\n===Visigothic Museum===\nThe whitewashed Latin-Visigothic church of Santo Amaro, dedicated to [[Saint Amaro]], standing next to the castle, is one of just four pre-Romanesque churches left in Portugal. Some parts date from the 6th century and the interior columns and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] are carved with foliages and geometric designs from the 7th century. Especially the column with birds attacking a snake is of particular note. It houses today a small archaeological museum with Visigothic art.\n\n===Museum of [[Eleanor of Viseu|Queen Eleanor]]===\nThis regional museum was set up in 1927 and 1928 in the former Convent of Our Lady of the Conception (''Convento de Nossa Senhora da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o'') of the [[Order of Poor Ladies]] (dissolved in 1834), gradually expanding its collection. This [[Franciscan]] convent had been established in 1459 by [[Infante Fernando, Duke of Viseu]] and duke of Beja, next to his ducal palace. The construction continued until 1509.\n\nIt is an impressive building with a late-[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] lattice-worked [[architrave]] running along the building. This elegant architrave resembles somewhat the architrave of the [[Monastery of Batalha]], even if there are some early-[[Manueline]] influences. Above the entrance porch on the western fa\u00e7ade one can see the ''ajimez'' window (a [[mullion]]ed window in Manueline and Moorish style) in the room of the [[abbess]], originating from the demolished palace of the dukes of Beja. The entrance door is embedded under an [[ogee]] arch. A square bell-tower and a [[spire]] with [[crocket]]s tower above the complex. The convent has been classified as a national monument.\n\nThe entrance hall leads to the sumptuously gilded [[Baroque]] chapel, consisting of a single nave under a semi-circular [[vault (architecture)|vault]]. Three altars (one of the 17th century, dedicated to St. John the Evangelist, and two of the 18th century, dedicated to St. Christopher and St. Bento) are decorated with gilded woodwork (''talha dourada''). The fourth altar, dedicated to St. [[John the Baptist]], was decorated with Florentine mosaics by Jos\u00e9 Ramalho in 1695.\n\nOn the wall are three religious [[azulejo]]s dating from 1741, depicting scenes from the life of St. John the Baptist\n\nThe refectory and the ''claustro'' are decorated with exquisite ''azulejos'', some dating from Moorish times, others from the 16th to the 18th centuries.\n\nOne enters the [[chapter house]] through a Manueline portal from the ''quadra'' of St. John the Evangelist. The ribbed vault of this square room was [[Painterwork|distempered]] during the renovations of 1727. The walls are covered with Arab-Hispanic azulejos with geometric and vegetal designs that are among the most important ceramic decorations in Portugal. Above the azulejos are some semicircular distempered paintings with religious themes: [[St. John the Baptist]], [[St. John the Evangelist]], [[St. Christopher]], [[Clare of Assisi|St. Clare]] and [[St. Francis of Assisi]].\n\nThe museum houses also an important collection of Flemish, Spanish and Portuguese paintings from the 15th to the 18th centuries, among them:\n\n* Flemish paintings: ''[[:Image:Beja41.jpg|''Virgin with Milk]]''; Flemish School (c. 1530) and \"Christ and His Apostles\" (16th century)\n* Portuguese paintings: ''[[:File:Ecce homo - seculo xv - portugal.jpg|Ecce Homo]]'' (15th century), \"[[Vincent of Saragossa|St. Vincent]] by Vicente Gil and Manuel Vicente (16th century), \"Virgin with the Rose\" by Francisco Campos (16th century), \"Mass of St. Gregory\" probably by [[Greg\u00f3rio Lopes]] (16th century), \"Annunciation\" (16th century) and four paintings by Ant\u00f3nio Nogueira (16th century), \"Last Supper\" by Pedro Alexandrino (17th century).\n* Spanish paintings: ''[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]'', ''[[:File:Beja36.jpg|St. Jerome]]'' and \"Martyrdom of St. Bartholomew\" by [[Jos\u00e9 de Ribera]] (Spanish, 17th century), ''[[:File:Beja33.jpg|Head of Saint John the Baptist]]'' (Spanish School, 17th century)\n\nThe museum houses also the funeral monuments in late-Gothic style of the first abbess D. Uganda and of the [[Infante Fernando, Duke of Viseu]] and his wife Beatriz of Portugal.\n\nThe archaeological collection of Fernando Nunes Ribeiro, donated to museum in 1987 after forty years of archaeological research, is on display on the upper floors: Visigothic and Roman artefacts, gravestones from the [[Bronze Age]] with antique writings of the [[Iberians]] and [[stele]]s from the [[Iron Age]].\n\nAmong the several other artefacts in its collection, the museum possesses the ''Escudela de Pero de Faria'', a unique piece of Chinese porcelain from 1541.\n\n==Notable citizens==\n* [[Ant\u00f3nio Raposo Tavares]], ''O Velho'' (S\u00e3o Miguel do Pinheiro, [[Mertola]]; 1598 \u2013 S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; 1658), a Portuguese colonial [[bandeirante]] who explored the eastern coast of South America (claiming it for Portugal) and extending the territory of the Portuguese colony beyond the limits imposed by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]];\n* [[Mariana Alcoforado]] (Santa Maria da Feira, Beja, 22 April 1640 \u2013 Beja, 28 July 1723), 17th century Portuguese nun who, purportedly, wrote the ''[[Letters of a Portuguese Nun]]'' (comprising five letters), that detailed her affair with French officer No\u00ebl Bouton (Marquis de Chamilly and, later, Marshal of France). In the story, the nun glimpsed the young officer only once from her window in 1641, while he was campaigning against the Spanish army in the [[Alentejo]]. She fell in love at once and wrote him five passionate letters. Although the Portuguese letters disappeared, they were \"translated\" into French and published in [[Brussels]] in 1669 (and later into several languages). The lyrical composition is full of absolute passion, hope, pleas and despair and were an instant literary success, resulting in the popularity of this style (coining the term ''portugaise'' becoming synonymous for \"passionate love letter\").\n* [[Gon\u00e7alo Mendes da Maia]] ''O Lidador'' (Maia, 1079 \u2013 Alentejo, 1170), Portuguese knight in the service of [[Afonso Henriques]], responsible for border defense in the region of Beja.\n* [[Pedro Caixinha]] Football manager currently with [[Cruz Azul]]\n\n== References ==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{citation |title=The Rough Guide to Portugal |edition=11 |date= 1 March 2005 |isbn=1-84353-438-X}}\n* {{citation |last=Rentes de Carvalho |first=J. |title=Portugal, um guia para amigos |language=Dutch |publisher=Arbeiderspers |location=Amsterdam, Netherlands |edition=9 |date=1 August 1999 |isbn=90-295-3466-4}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Lefcourt |first=Charles R. |title = Did Guilleragues Write \"The Portuguese Letters\"? |journal=Hispania |volume = 59 |issue=3 |date=September 1976 |pages = 493\u2013497 |doi = 10.2307/340526 |jstor = 340526}}\n* {{cite journal|author = Owen, Hilary|title = The Love Letters of Mariana Alcoforado|journal = Cultura| volume= 16|issue = 14|year = 1997}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portal|Portugal}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Beja}}\n{{Commons category|Beja}}\n* [http://www.cm-beja.pt/ Town Hall official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061223011536/http://www.museuregionaldebeja.net/ Museum Queen Eleanor] (in Portuguese)\n* [https://ordemdocarmo.wixsite.com/carmelobeja Carmel of Beja] (in Portuguese)\n\n{{Municipalities of Beja}}\n\n[[Category:Beja, Portugal| ]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Beja District]]\n[[Category:Burial sites of the House of Aviz]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of Beja District]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beja,_Portugal"}

An economics student and left-wing activist, Villalobos joined the ERP in 1971, at the age of 19. He has since been accused of involvement in the killing in 1975 of [[Roque Dalton]], the revolutionary poet and fellow ERP leader who was shot by his comrades after a power struggle in the group led to accusations that he was a CIA spy.<ref name=LRB /> At the time, the killing led to splits and recriminations within the ERP and criticism from other leftists, but after 1980 Villalobos rose to become one of the FMLN\u2019s main military strategists.

It also refers to the small swimming area that faces into the bay.\n\n==History==\nThe beach was formed through the erosion of volcanically-produced lava that originated during a series of [[volcanic eruption|eruption]]s that formed the [[Guilherme Moniz]] volcano in 1761. Lavas flowed to the sea by way of the hamlet of Serretinha in the [[Freguesia|civil parish]] of [[Feteira (Angra do Hero\u00edsmo)|Feteira]] in the direction of Porto Judeu. The lava's path is still traceable: an area of scorched land characterized by black blocks of basalt mixed with large amounts of slag. When the lava flow neared the sea, it spread out and entered the salt water at several points, among them the Bay of \n    \nOn 28 August 1893, a [[hurricane]], at the time the largest storm in human memory, caused tremendous [[tidal surge]]s together with punishing winds that ruined homes, churches, and barns that surrounded the bay.

During a period when trade from the Indies was active, the Portuguese built and maintained a defensive corridor around the island of Terceira, and in particular near the Bay of Angra. This was accomplished by setting up a series of forts, batteries and redoubts to provide a crossfire; the redoubts of [[Monte Brasil]] and cannon batteries from the Fort of S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o effectively impeded assaults by pirates and invaders.\n\nThe early voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]] and, later, those of [[Vasco da Gama]] (whose brother, [[Paulo da Gama]], was buried in the [[Convent of S\u00e3o Francisco (Angra do Hero\u00edsmo)|Convent of S\u00e3o Francisco]] in Angra) permitted the Azores to take an important role in mid-Atlantic traffic. Early trading expeditions reinforced the importance of the island of Terceira, and allowed the Bay of Angra to develop, as an important trans-shipping stop from the East. This role helped the establishment of a protective fleet, called the ''\"Armada of the Islands\"'' by King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]], and ordered special rules for ''\"...for ships from India in the Azores and the institution of arbiters of customs...\"'' (or ''maritime magistrates''), both in 1520.\n\nDuring the reign of [[John III of Portugal]], around 1527, the position of the ''Purveyor of the Fleets'' was established, with his headquarters in Angra.

The Purveyor, whose house was strategically close to the Bay of Angra and the customs pier, was responsible for maintaining the security of the island: Pero Anes, therefore, established a surveillance system which could detect approaching raider ships which, in conjunction with coastal defences could protect the ships and their goods, and still provide supplies and provisions. The system required the coordination between the ''Purveyor'' and other authorities on Terceira, in addition to the islands in the Central and Western Groups of the Azores. Specific attention was taken with the authorities on the island of [[Corvo Island|Corvo]] (the north-westernmost island in the archipelago), who were likely to spot the arrival of ships from the west: it was the responsibility of the authorities on this island to send a courier to Angra with news of any sighting.\n\nThe defence of returning ships was handled by an armed fleet consisting of a variable number of ships that shuttled between [[Lisbon]] and Terceira, with regular stops in the archipelago of the [[Berlengas]]. On Terceira, the admiralty was constantly monitoring news related to pirates and privateers, normally posting warships near Corvo for intervals of four months.

Consequently, there are many submarine springs that emit brackish water.\n\nThis bay, given its origin, has quite a diverse morphology, presenting sandbars, vertical walls (some more than 40 metres high), large blocks, fields of small and medium stones, caves, pebbles scattered on sandy bottoms, etc.\n\n===Biome===\n;Fauna\nSome of the marine species present in the bay include:\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[flounder|Wide-eyed flounder]] (''[[Bothidae|Bothus podas maderensis]]'')\n* [[Striped red mullet]] (''[[Mullus surmuletus]]'')\n* [[Guinean puffer]]fish (''Sphoeroides marmoratus'')\n* [[Grouper]]s (''[[Serranidae]]'')\n* [[Wrasse]]s (''Labridae'' and ''Coris julis'')\n* [[Sea urchin|Black sea urchin]] (''[[Arbacia]] lixula'')\n* [[Triggerfish]] (''Balistes carolinensis'')\n* [[Hermit crab]] (''[[Calcinus tubularis]]'')\n* [[Octopus]] (''[[Octopus vulgaris]]'')\n* [[Starfish]] (''Ophidiaster ophidianus'')\n* [[Jellyfish]] (''[[Pelagia noctiluca]]'')\n* [[Portuguese man-o'-war]] (''Physalia physalis'')\n* [[Stingray|Round fantail stingray]] (''Taeniura grabata'')\n* [[Jack mackerel|Blue jack mackerel]] (''[[Trachurus|Trachurus picturatus]]'')\n* Sea anemone (Alicia mirabilis)\n{{div col end}}\n;Flora\nIn all, more than 128 species are present in the bay, including:\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Red algae (Asparagopsis armata)\n* Red algae (Pterocladiella capillacea)\n* [[Brown algae]] (''[[Dictyotales|Dictyota dichotoma]]'')\n* Ascidians-flower (corolla Distaplia)\n* Sea lettuce (Ulva intestinalis)\n* Sea lettuce (Ulva rigidis)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Ba\u00eda de Angra do Hero\u00edsmo, ilha Terceira, A\u00e7ores, Portugal.jpg|thumb|right|235px|The bay and marina of Angra in the civil parish of [[S\u00e9 (Angra do Hero\u00edsmo)|S\u00e9]]]]\nThe ''Direc\u00e7\u00e3o Geral dos Portos da Terceira e Graciosa'' (''Directorate-General for the Ports of Terceira and Graciosa''), presented on 25 October 2011, in the ''Centro Cultural e de Congressos'' (''Cultural and Congress Centre'') the elaboration of a project of the environmental impact study and process plans for the construction of a new cruiser terminal for the Bay of Angra.<ref name=\"AZCruise\">{{citation |url=http://cruzeirospdl.blogspot.pt/2011/10/cais-de-cruzeiros-de-angra-do-heroismo.html |title=Cais dos Cruzeiros da Angra do Hero\u00edsmo em Discuss\u00e3o P\u00fablica |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=14 October 2012 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> The terminal project with a dock of {{convert|350|-|400|m|ft}} length, would expand the bay to a {{convert|12|m|ft}} depth, and provide a {{convert|20|m|ft}} wide support platform, with {{convert|20000|m2|ft2}} area, and a ferry ramp for roll-on-roll-off operations for inter-island traffic.<ref name=AZCruise/> During the presentation issues were raised as to manoeuvrability of cruise ships within the confined spaces of the Bay, suggesting that the planned design would not permit ships much latitude to manoeuvre.<ref name=AZCruise/> The design called for a {{convert|500|m|ft}} protective service area, but that a {{convert|900|m|ft}} would be more viable: the mouth of the Monte Brasil channel would have to be expanded in order to support this limited service area.<ref name=AZCruise/>\n\n==Archaeology==\nThe following locations are of archaeological interest:\n* [[Cemetery of Anchors]] ({{lang-pt|Cemit\u00e9rio das \u00c2ncoras}})\n* Shipwreck of the ''Lidador'', a [[Brazil]]ian steamboat (1878)\n* [[Shipwreck of the Run'her|Shipwreck of the ''Run'her'']], a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] steamboat (1863)\n* Underwater Archaeological Park of the Bay of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo ({{lang-pt|[[Parque Arqueol\u00f3gico Subaqu\u00e1tico da Ba\u00eda de Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]]}})\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of bays in the Azores]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Angra do Hero\u00edsmo}}\n\n\n[[Category:Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water of the Azores|Bay Angra]]\n[[Category:Bays of Portugal|Angra]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Angra"}

It ended in a decisive Portuguese victory.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Background ===\nBy 1659, the Portuguese Restoration War had been raging for 18 years and had degenerated into a stalemate. Other than cross border raids, little fighting had occurred and neither the Spanish-Habsburg Army nor the Portuguese had managed to claim a decisive battlefield victory. [[Philip IV of Spain|King Philip IV of Spain]] sought to end the conflict by laying siege to and capturing a major Portuguese position, thereby luring out and destroying any Portuguese army that tried to aid the embattled garrison.\n\nThe town of Elvas was chosen as a target due to the threat it posed to the Spanish city of [[Badajoz]], as seen during the [[Battle of Montijo]] in 1644 when a Portuguese army based at Elvas had crossed the border, raided Spanish towns, and attacked a Spanish army. The capture of Elvas and Fort Santa Luzia would also allow the Spanish Army to proceed down the Estremoz road to the Portuguese capital of [[Lisbon]] if they so chose. The Portuguese court was aware of the Spanish threat to the city and had greatly reinforced the strength of the city's defensive fortifications during the course of the war. However, years of only minor military action in the area had degraded the readiness of the garrison, and the city was unprepared for a siege. In addition, though the Spanish preparation for the offensive was detected, the vast majority the Portuguese Army was deployed in the north of the country in preparation for a suspected Spanish attack there.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=History of War in the Iberian Peninsula|last=Marcus|first=Tuell|publisher=William & Wilkins Publishing House|year=1952|isbn=|location=Baltimore|pages=235\u2013237|quote=|via=}}</ref>[[File:Retrato de D.
