A tendency away from the [[narrative]], which was characteristic for the traditional arts, toward [[abstraction]] is characteristic of much modern art. More recent artistic production is often called [[contemporary art]] or [[postmodern art]].\n\nModern art begins with the heritage of painters like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] all of whom were essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the [[Proto-Cubism|pre-cubists]] [[Georges Braque]], [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. Matisse's two versions of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signified a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.<ref>Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.</ref> It reflected Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm color of the figures against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]].\n\nInitially influenced by [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Gauguin]] and other late-19th-century innovators, [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on C\u00e9zanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907), Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Cubist]] inventions. [[Analytic cubism]] was jointly developed by Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], exemplified by ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris,'' from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], practiced by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and several other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier coll\u00e9]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe notion of modern art is closely related to [[modernism]].<ref>\"One way of understanding the relation of the terms 'modern,' 'modernity,' and 'modernism' is that aesthetic modernism is a form of art characteristic of high or actualized late modernity, that is, of that period in which social, economic, and cultural life in the widest sense [was] revolutionized by modernity ... [this means] that modernist art is scarcely thinkable outside the context of the modernized society of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Social modernity is the home of modernist art, even where that art rebels against it.\" Cahoone 1996, p. 13.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[\u00c9douard Manet]], ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass]]'' (''Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe''), 1863, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], [[Paris]]]]\n\n=== Roots in the 19th century ===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Van Gogh - la courtisane.jpg\n| width1    = 94\n| caption1  = [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''Courtesan (after [[Keisai Eisen|Eisen]])'' (1887), [[Van Gogh Museum]]\n| alt1      = Multi-colored portrait of a far eastern cortesan with elaborate hair ornamentation, colorful robelike garment, and a border depicting marshland waters and reeds.\n| image2    = Vincent van Gogh - Bloeiende pruimenboomgaard- naar Hiroshige - Google Art Project.jpg\n| width2    = 133\n| caption2  = [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''The Blooming Plumtree (after [[Hiroshige]])'' (1887), [[Van Gogh Museum]]\n| alt2      = Portrait of a tree with blossoms and with far eastern alphabet letters both in the portrait and along the left and right borders.\n| image3    = Van Gogh - Portrait of Pere Tanguy 1887-8.JPG\n| width3    = 126\n| caption3  = [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''[[Portrait of P\u00e8re Tanguy]]'' (1887), [[Mus\u00e9e Rodin]]\n| alt3      = Portrait of a man of a bearded man facing forward, holding his own hands in his lap; wearing a hat, blue coat, beige collared shirt and brown pants; sitting in front of a background with various tiles of far eastern and nature themed art.\n}}\n\nAlthough modern [[sculpture]] and [[architecture]] are reckoned to have emerged at the end of the 19th century, the beginnings of modern [[painting]] can be located earlier.<ref>Arnason 1998, p. 10.</ref> The date perhaps most commonly identified as marking the birth of modern art is 1863,<ref name=\"Arn13\">Arnason 1998, p. 17.</ref> the year that [[\u00c9douard Manet]] showed his painting ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' in the ''[[Salon des Refus\u00e9s]]'' in Paris. Earlier dates have also been proposed, among them 1855 (the year [[Gustave Courbet]] exhibited ''[[The Artist's Studio]]'') and 1784 (the year [[Jacques-Louis David]] completed his painting ''[[The Oath of the Horatii]]'').<ref name=\"Arn13\" /> In the words of art historian [[H. Harvard Arnason]]: \"Each of these dates has significance for the development of modern art, but none categorically marks a completely new beginning ....  A gradual metamorphosis took place in the course of a hundred years.\"<ref name=\"Arn13\" />\n\nThe strands of thought that eventually led to modern art can be traced back to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref>\"In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries momentum began to gather behind a new ''view'' of the world, which would eventually create a new ''world'', the modern world\". Cahoone 1996, p. 27.</ref> The important modern art critic [[Clement Greenberg]], for instance, called [[Immanuel Kant]] \"the first real Modernist\" but also drew a distinction: \"The Enlightenment criticized from the outside ... .

This gave rise to what art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] called a \"self-consciousness that made people select the style of their building as one selects the pattern of a wallpaper.\"<ref>Gombrich 1958, pp. 358\u2013359.</ref>\n\nThe pioneers of modern art were [[Romanticism|Romantics]], [[Realism (visual arts)|Realists]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionists]].<ref>Arnason 1998, p. 22.</ref> By the late 19th century, additional movements which were to be influential in modern art had begun to emerge: [[post-Impressionism]] as well as [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]].\n\nInfluences upon these movements were varied: from exposure to Eastern decorative arts, particularly [[Japonism|Japanese printmaking]], to the coloristic innovations of [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], to a search for more [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in the depiction of common life, as found in the work of painters such as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]]. The advocates of realism stood against the [[idealism]] of the tradition-bound [[academic art]] that enjoyed public and official favor.<ref>Corinth, Schuster, Brauner, Vitali, and Butts 1996, p.25.</ref> The most successful painters of the day worked either through commissions or through large public exhibitions of their own work. There were official, government-sponsored painters' unions, while governments regularly held public exhibitions of new fine and decorative arts.\n\nThe Impressionists argued that people do not see objects but only the light which they reflect, and therefore painters should paint in natural light ([[en plein air]]) rather than in studios and should capture the effects of light in their work.<ref>Cogniat 1975, p. 61.</ref> Impressionist artists formed a group, ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Coop\u00e9rative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs'' (\"Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers\") which, despite internal tensions, mounted a series of independent exhibitions.<ref>Cogniat 1975, pp. 43\u201349.</ref> The style was adopted by artists in different nations, in preference to a \"national\" style. These factors established the view that it was a [[Art movement|\"movement\"]]. These traits\u2014establishment of a working method integral to the art, establishment of a movement or visible active core of support, and international adoption\u2014would be repeated by artistic movements in the Modern period in art.\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pablo Picasso]] ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' 1907, [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|New York]]]]\n[[File:La danse (I) by Matisse.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Dance (Matisse)|The Dance I]]'', 1909, [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|New York]]]]\nAmong the movements which flowered in the first decade of the 20th century were [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Expressionism]], and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]].\n\nDuring the years between 1910 and the end of World War I and after the heyday of [[cubism]], several movements emerged in Paris. [[Giorgio de Chirico]] moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as [[Alberto Savinio]]). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade, a member of the jury at the [[Salon d'Automne]] where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: ''Enigma of the Oracle'', ''Enigma of an Afternoon'' and ''Self-Portrait''. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]] and Salon d\u2019Automne, and his work was noticed by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], and several others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of [[Surrealism]]. ''[[The Song of Love (Giorgio de Chirico)|Song of Love]]'' (1914) is one of the most famous works by de Chirico and is an early example of the [[Surrealism|surrealist]] style, though it was painted ten years before the movement was \"founded\" by [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] in 1924.\n\nWorld War I brought an end to this phase but indicated the beginning of a number of [[anti-art]] movements, such as [[Dada]], including the work of [[Marcel Duchamp]], and of [[Surrealism]]. Artist groups like [[de Stijl]] and [[Bauhaus]] developed new ideas about the interrelation of the arts, architecture, design, and art education.\n\nModern art was introduced to the United States with the [[Armory Show]] in 1913 and through European artists who moved to the U.S. during World War I.\n\n=== After World War II ===\nIt was only after World War II, however, that the U.S. became the focal point of new artistic movements.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html CIA and AbEx] Retrieved November 7, 2010</ref> The 1950s and 1960s saw the emergence of [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Color field painting]], [[Conceptual art]]ists of [[Art & Language]], [[Pop art]], [[Op art]], [[Hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Photorealism]] and various other movements.

A tendency away from the [[narrative]], which was characteristic for the traditional arts, toward [[abstraction]] is characteristic of much modern art. More recent artistic production is often called [[contemporary art]] or [[postmodern art]].\n\nModern art begins with the heritage of painters like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] all of whom were essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the [[Proto-Cubism|pre-cubists]] [[Georges Braque]], [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. Matisse's two versions of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signified a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.<ref>Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.</ref> It reflected Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm color of the figures against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]].\n\nInitially influenced by [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Gauguin]] and other late-19th-century innovators, [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on C\u00e9zanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907), Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Cubist]] inventions. [[Analytic cubism]] was jointly developed by Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], exemplified by ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris,'' from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], practiced by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and several other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier coll\u00e9]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe notion of modern art is closely related to [[modernism]].<ref>\"One way of understanding the relation of the terms 'modern,' 'modernity,' and 'modernism' is that aesthetic modernism is a form of art characteristic of high or actualized late modernity, that is, of that period in which social, economic, and cultural life in the widest sense [was] revolutionized by modernity ... [this means] that modernist art is scarcely thinkable outside the context of the modernized society of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Social modernity is the home of modernist art, even where that art rebels against it.\" Cahoone 1996, p. 13.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[\u00c9douard Manet]], ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass]]'' (''Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe''), 1863, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], [[Paris]]]]\n\n=== Roots in the 19th century ===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Van Gogh - la courtisane.jpg\n| width1    = 94\n| caption1  = [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''Courtesan (after [[Keisai Eisen|Eisen]])'' (1887), [[Van Gogh Museum]]\n| alt1      = Multi-colored portrait of a far eastern cortesan with elaborate hair ornamentation, colorful robelike garment, and a border depicting marshland waters and reeds.\n| image2    = Vincent van Gogh - Bloeiende pruimenboomgaard- naar Hiroshige - Google Art Project.jpg\n| width2    = 133\n| caption2  = [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''The Blooming Plumtree (after [[Hiroshige]])'' (1887), [[Van Gogh Museum]]\n| alt2      = Portrait of a tree with blossoms and with far eastern alphabet letters both in the portrait and along the left and right borders.\n| image3    = Van Gogh - Portrait of Pere Tanguy 1887-8.JPG\n| width3    = 126\n| caption3  = [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''[[Portrait of P\u00e8re Tanguy]]'' (1887), [[Mus\u00e9e Rodin]]\n| alt3      = Portrait of a man of a bearded man facing forward, holding his own hands in his lap; wearing a hat, blue coat, beige collared shirt and brown pants; sitting in front of a background with various tiles of far eastern and nature themed art.\n}}\n\nAlthough modern [[sculpture]] and [[architecture]] are reckoned to have emerged at the end of the 19th century, the beginnings of modern [[painting]] can be located earlier.<ref>Arnason 1998, p. 10.</ref> The date perhaps most commonly identified as marking the birth of modern art is 1863,<ref name=\"Arn13\">Arnason 1998, p. 17.</ref> the year that [[\u00c9douard Manet]] showed his painting ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' in the ''[[Salon des Refus\u00e9s]]'' in Paris. Earlier dates have also been proposed, among them 1855 (the year [[Gustave Courbet]] exhibited ''[[The Artist's Studio]]'') and 1784 (the year [[Jacques-Louis David]] completed his painting ''[[The Oath of the Horatii]]'').<ref name=\"Arn13\" /> In the words of art historian [[H. Harvard Arnason]]: \"Each of these dates has significance for the development of modern art, but none categorically marks a completely new beginning ....  A gradual metamorphosis took place in the course of a hundred years.\"<ref name=\"Arn13\" />\n\nThe strands of thought that eventually led to modern art can be traced back to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref>\"In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries momentum began to gather behind a new ''view'' of the world, which would eventually create a new ''world'', the modern world\". Cahoone 1996, p. 27.</ref> The important modern art critic [[Clement Greenberg]], for instance, called [[Immanuel Kant]] \"the first real Modernist\" but also drew a distinction: \"The Enlightenment criticized from the outside ... . Modernism criticizes from the inside.\"<ref>Frascina and Harrison 1982, p. 5.</ref> The [[French Revolution]] of 1789 uprooted assumptions and institutions that had for centuries been accepted with little question and accustomed the public to vigorous political and social debate. This gave rise to what art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] called a \"self-consciousness that made people select the style of their building as one selects the pattern of a wallpaper.\"<ref>Gombrich 1958, pp. 358\u2013359.</ref>\n\nThe pioneers of modern art were [[Romanticism|Romantics]], [[Realism (visual arts)|Realists]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionists]].<ref>Arnason 1998, p. 22.</ref> By the late 19th century, additional movements which were to be influential in modern art had begun to emerge: [[post-Impressionism]] as well as [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]].\n\nInfluences upon these movements were varied: from exposure to Eastern decorative arts, particularly [[Japonism|Japanese printmaking]], to the coloristic innovations of [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], to a search for more [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in the depiction of common life, as found in the work of painters such as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]]. The advocates of realism stood against the [[idealism]] of the tradition-bound [[academic art]] that enjoyed public and official favor.<ref>Corinth, Schuster, Brauner, Vitali, and Butts 1996, p.25.</ref> The most successful painters of the day worked either through commissions or through large public exhibitions of their own work. There were official, government-sponsored painters' unions, while governments regularly held public exhibitions of new fine and decorative arts.\n\nThe Impressionists argued that people do not see objects but only the light which they reflect, and therefore painters should paint in natural light ([[en plein air]]) rather than in studios and should capture the effects of light in their work.<ref>Cogniat 1975, p. 61.</ref> Impressionist artists formed a group, ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Coop\u00e9rative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs'' (\"Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers\") which, despite internal tensions, mounted a series of independent exhibitions.<ref>Cogniat 1975, pp. 43\u201349.</ref> The style was adopted by artists in different nations, in preference to a \"national\" style. These factors established the view that it was a [[Art movement|\"movement\"]]. These traits\u2014establishment of a working method integral to the art, establishment of a movement or visible active core of support, and international adoption\u2014would be repeated by artistic movements in the Modern period in art.\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pablo Picasso]] ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' 1907, [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|New York]]]]\n[[File:La danse (I) by Matisse.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Dance (Matisse)|The Dance I]]'', 1909, [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|New York]]]]\nAmong the movements which flowered in the first decade of the 20th century were [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Expressionism]], and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]].\n\nDuring the years between 1910 and the end of World War I and after the heyday of [[cubism]], several movements emerged in Paris. [[Giorgio de Chirico]] moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as [[Alberto Savinio]]). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade, a member of the jury at the [[Salon d'Automne]] where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: ''Enigma of the Oracle'', ''Enigma of an Afternoon'' and ''Self-Portrait''. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]] and Salon d\u2019Automne, and his work was noticed by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], and several others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of [[Surrealism]]. ''[[The Song of Love (Giorgio de Chirico)|Song of Love]]'' (1914) is one of the most famous works by de Chirico and is an early example of the [[Surrealism|surrealist]] style, though it was painted ten years before the movement was \"founded\" by [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] in 1924.\n\nWorld War I brought an end to this phase but indicated the beginning of a number of [[anti-art]] movements, such as [[Dada]], including the work of [[Marcel Duchamp]], and of [[Surrealism]]. Artist groups like [[de Stijl]] and [[Bauhaus]] developed new ideas about the interrelation of the arts, architecture, design, and art education.\n\nModern art was introduced to the United States with the [[Armory Show]] in 1913 and through European artists who moved to the U.S. during World War I.\n\n=== After World War II ===\nIt was only after World War II, however, that the U.S. became the focal point of new artistic movements.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html CIA and AbEx] Retrieved November 7, 2010</ref> The 1950s and 1960s saw the emergence of [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Color field painting]], [[Conceptual art]]ists of [[Art & Language]], [[Pop art]], [[Op art]], [[Hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Photorealism]] and various other movements.

Relatively little-known for a half-century after its introduction, it achieved iconic status in the [[post-war period]] as the preferred typeface of many [[Switzerland|Swiss]] graphic designers in what became called the [[International Typographic Style|'International' or 'Swiss' design style]] which became popular across the [[Western world]] in the 1950s and 1960s.

[http://www.enterprise-architecture.info/Images/Documents/Federal%20EA%20Framework.pdf Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework Version 1.1]. September 1999.</ref>\n\nDeveloped late-1980s by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) and others, the [[federal government of the United States]] promoted this reference model in the 1990s as the foundation for enterprise architectures of individual U.S. government agencies and in the overall [[federal enterprise architecture]].<ref name=\"CIOC99\"/>\n\n== Overview ==\nThe NIST Enterprise Architecture Model is a five-layered model for [[enterprise architecture]], designed for organizing, planning, and building an integrated set of information and information technology architectures. The five layers are defined separately but are interrelated and interwoven.<ref name=\"CIOC99\"/> The model defined the interrelation as follows:<ref name=\"FG89\"/> \n* Business Architecture drives the information architecture\n* Information architecture prescribes the information systems architecture\n* Information systems architecture identifies the data architecture\n* Data Architecture suggests specific data delivery systems, and \n* Data Delivery Systems (Software, Hardware, Communications) support the data architecture. \nThe hierarchy in the model is based on the notion that an organization operates a number of business functions, each function requires information from a number of source, and each of these sources may operate one or more operation systems, which in turn contain data organized and stored in any number of data systems.<ref>John O'Looney (2002). ''Wiring Governments: Challenges and Possibilities for Public Managers''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p.67.</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe NIST Enterprise Architecture Model is initiated in 1988 in the fifth workshop on Information Management Directions sponsored by the NIST in cooperation with the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM), the [[IEEE Computer Society]], and the Federal Data Management Users Group (FEDMUG). The results of this research project were published as the NIST Special Publication 500-167, ''Information Management Directions: The Integration Challenge''.<ref name=\"FG89\">Elizabeth N.

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 500-167, September 1989.</ref>\n\n=== The emerging field of information management ===\nWith the proliferation of [[information technology]] starting in the 1970s, the job of [[information management]] had taken a new light, and also began to include the field of [[data maintenance]]. No longer was information management a simple job that could be performed by almost anyone. An understanding of the technology involved, and the theory behind it became necessary. As [[information storage]] shifted to electronic means, this became more and more difficult.<ref name=\"FG89\"/>\n\n[[Image:4-2 ANSI-SPARC three level architecture.svg|thumb|320px|The notion of a three-schema model was first introduced in 1975 by the [[ANSI-SPARC Architecture|ANSI/X3/SPARC three level architecture]], which determined three levels to model data.<ref name=\"MW99\">Matthew West and Julian Fowler (1999). [http://www.matthew-west.org.uk/publications/princ03.pdf High Quality Data Models]. The European Process Industries STEP Technical Liaison Executive (EPISTLE).</ref>]]\nOne of the first overall approaches to building [[information systems]] and systems [[information management]] from the 1970s was the [[three-schema approach]]. It proposes to use three different [[view model|views]] in systems development, in which [[conceptual model]]ling is considered to be the key to achieving [[data integration]]:<ref name=\"STRAP08\">[http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/strap/strpsec2.htm STRAP SECTION 2 APPROACH].

The physical schema according to Sowa (2004) \"describes the internal formats of the [[data]] stored in the [[database]], and the external schema defines the view of the data presented to the [[application program]]s\".<ref name =\"JFS04\">[[John F.

Chunawala, Homi Bhabha Centre, Mumbai, 2006.</ref>\n\nSince the 1970s the NIST had held a series of four workshops on Database and Information Management Directions. Each of the workshops addresses a specific theme:<ref>Fong and Goldfine (1989, p. 5)</ref> \n* \"What information about [[database]] technology does the manager need to make prudent decisions about using new technology\", in 1975.\n* \"What information can help a manager assess the impact on a database system?\" in 1977.\n* \"[[Information management]] tools from the standpoint of: uses; policies and controls; logical and physical database design\" in 1980; and \n* \"The nature of information [[resource management]] practice and problems\" in 1985.\n\nThe fifth workshop in 1989 was held by the National Computer Systems Laboratory (NCSL) of the NIST. By then this was one of the four institutes, that performed the technical work of the NIST. The specific goal of the NCSL was to conduct research and provide scientific and technical services to aid Federal agencies in the selection, acquisition, application, and use of computer technology.<ref>Fong and Goldfine (1989, p. i)</ref>\n\n=== NIST workshop on Information Management Directions  ===\nThe fifth Information Management Directions workshop in 1989 focused on integration and productivity in [[information management]]. Five working groups considered specific aspects of the integration of knowledge, [[data management]], systems planning, development and maintenance, computing environments, architectures and standards. Participants came from academia, industry, government and consulting firms. Among the 72 participants were [[Tom DeMarco]], [[Ahmed K. Elmagarmid]], Elizabeth N. Fong, [[Andrew U.

Bradford Rigdon]] of the McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Company (MDISC), a division of [[McDonnell Douglas]]. Rigdon et al. (1989) <ref name=\"WBR 1989\" >[[W. Bradford Rigdon]] (1989) \"Architectures and Standards\". In: ''Information Management Directions: The Integration Challenge''. E.N. Fong and A.H. Goldfine (eds.). NIST Sept 1989. p. 135-150</ref> explained that discussions about architecture in that time mostly focus on technology concerns. Their aim was to \"takes a broader view, and describes the need for an ''enterprise architecture'' that includes an emphasis on business and information requirements. These higher level issues impact data and technology architectures and decisions.\"<ref name=\"Rigdon\">Rigdon (1989), p. 136</ref> In order to do so, the working group addressed three issues:<ref>Fong and Goldfine (1989, p. 136)</ref>\n* The levels of architecture in an enterprise\n* Problems addressed by architecture\n* Benefits and risks of having architecture\nTo illustrate the levels of architecture, what has become known as the NIST Enterprise Architecture Model, was presented (see image). In this concept the three layers of the [[three-schema approach]] are divided into five layers.\n\n=== Application in the 1990s ===\nIn a way the NIST Enterprise Architecture Model was ahead of his time. According to Zachman (1993) in the 1980s the \"architecture\" was acknowledged as a topic of interest, but there was still little consolidated theory concerning this concept.<ref>J.A Zachman (1993) ''[http://www.ies.aust.com/pdf-papers/zachman3.pdf Concepts for Framework for EA - Enterprise Architecture Resources]''. Zachman International, Inc. paper. p. 1</ref> [[Software architecture]], for example. become an important topic not until the second half of the nineties.<ref>Leonor Barroca, Jon Hall and Patrick Hall (200) \"[http://mcs.open.ac.uk/lmb3/introduction.pdf An Introduction and History of Software Architectures, Components, and Reuse]\" in: ''Software Architectures'', 2000 p. 1</ref>\n\nTo support the NIST Enterprise Architecture Model in the 1990s, it was widely promoted within the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] as Enterprise Architecture management tool.<ref name=\"CIOC99\"/> The NIST Enterprise Architecture Model is applied as foundation in multiple Enterprise Architecture frameworks of U.S. Federal government agencies and in the overall [[Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework]].<ref name=\"CIOC99\"/> In coordinating this effort the NIST model was further explained and extended in the 1997 \"Memoranda 97-16 (Information Technology Architectures)\" issued by the US Office of Management and Budget.,<ref name=\"M-97-16\">Franklin D. Raines, US OBM (1997) ''[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda_m97-16 Memoranda 97-16 (Information Technology Architectures)]'' M-97-16, issued June 18, 1997.</ref> see further [[#Information Technology Architecture|Information Technology Architecture]].\n\n== NIST Enterprise Architecture Model topics ==\n\n=== Foundations ===\nAccording to Rigdon et al. (1989) an architecture is \"a clear representation of a conceptual framework of components and their relationship at a point in time\".<ref>Rigdon et al. (1989, p. 136)</ref> It may for example represent \"a view of a current situation with islands of automation, redundant processes and data inconsistencies\"<ref name= \"Rig 1989, 137\">Rigdon (1989), p. 137</ref> or a \"future integrated automation information structure towards which the enterprise will move in a prescribed number on years.\"<ref>Rigdon et al. (1989, p. 137-38)</ref> The role of standards in architecture is to \"enable or constrain the architecture and serve as its foundation\".<ref name=\"Rig 1989, 137\"/>\n\nIn order to develop an enterprise architecture Rigdon acknowledge:<ref name=\"Rigdon\" />\n* There are multiple ways to develop an architecture  \n* There are multiple ways to implement standards \n* Development and implementation should be customized to the environment\n* Yet, every architecture itself can be divided into different levels. \nThe different levels of an enterprise architecture can be visualized as a pyramid: On top the business unit of an enterprise, and at the bottom the delivery system within the enterprise. The enterprise can consist of one or more business units, working in specific business area. The five levels of architecture are defined as: Business Unit, Information, Information System, Data and Delivery System.<ref name=\"Rig 1989, 137\"/>\n\nThe separate levels of an enterprise architecture are interrelated in a special way. On every level the architectures assumes or dictates the architectures at the higher level. The illustration on the right gives an example of which elements can constitute an Enterprise Architecture.\n[[File:Sample Elements of an Enterprise Architecture (1989).jpg|thumb|Sample elements of an Enterprise Architecture (1989).]]\n\n=== Levels of architecture ===\nEach layer of architecture in the model has a specific intention:<ref>Rigdon et al. (1989, p. 139-140)</ref>\n\n* Business Architecture level: This level can picture the total or a subunit of any corporation, which are in contact with external organizations.    \n* Information architecture level: This level specifies types of content, presentation forms, and format of the information required.   \n* Information systems architecture level: Specifications for automated and procedure-oriented information systems. \n* Data Architecture level: Framework for maintenance, access and use of data, with data dictionary and other naming conventions.   \n* Data Delivery Systems level: Technical implementation level of software, hardware, and communications that support the data architecture.\n\nSome sample elements of how the [[Enterprise Architecture]] can be described in more detail is shown in the illustration.\n\n=== Information Technology Architecture ===\nThe \"Memoranda 97-16 (Information Technology Architectures)\" gave the following definition of enterprise architecture:<ref name=\"M-97-16\"/>\n\n:''The Enterprise Architecture is the explicit description of the current and desired relationships among business and management process and information technology. It describes the \"target\" situation which the agency wishes to create and maintain by managing its IT portfolio.''\n:''The documentation of the Enterprise Architecture should include a discussion of principles and goals.<ref>Examples of published architectural \"frameworks\" include the [[Treasury Information System Architecture Framework]] (TISAF), the US Department of Defense [[Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management]] (TAFIM), and the [[:commons:Category:DOE Information Architecture|Department of Energy's Information Architecture Volume 1]].</ref> For example, the agency's overall management environment, including the balance between centralization and decentralization and the pace of change within the agency, should be clearly understood when developing the Enterprise Architecture. Within that environment, principles and goals set direction on such issues as the promotion of interoperability, open systems, public access, end-user satisfaction, and security.''\n\nIn this guidance the five component model of the NIST was adopted and further explained. Agencies were permitted to identify different components as appropriate and to specify the organizational level at which specific aspects of the components will be implemented. Although the substance of these components, sometimes called \"architectures\" or \"sub-architectures,\" must be addressed in every agency's complete Enterprise Architecture, agencies have great flexibility in describing, combining, and renaming the components, which consist of:<ref name=\"M-97-16\"/>\n\n* ''Business Processes'': This component of the Enterprise Architecture describes the core business processes which support the organization's missions. The Business Processes component is a high-level analysis of the work the agency performs to support the organizations's mission, vision, and goals, and is the foundation of the ITA. Analysis of the business processes determine the information needed and processed by the agency. This aspect of the ITA must be developed by senior program managers in conjunction with IT managers. Without a thorough understanding of its business processes and their relation to the agency missions, the agency will not be able to use its ITA effectively. <br>Business processes can be described by decomposing the processes into derivative business activities. There are a number of methodologies and related tools available to help agencies decompose processes. Irrespective of the tool used, the model should remain at a high enough level to allow a broad agency focus, yet sufficiently detailed to be useful in decision-making as the agency identifies its information needs. Agencies should avoid excessive emphasis on modeling business processes, which can result in a waste of agency resources.<ref group=Note>The US Department of Defense includes aspects of the Business Processes element in its Operational Architecture; the US Department of Treasury incorporates it into its business view.</ref>\n* ''Information Flows and Relationships'': This component analyzes the information utilized by the organization in its business processes, identifying the information used and the movement of the information within the agency. The relationships among the various flows of information are described in this component. These information flows indicate where the information is needed and how the information is shared to support mission functions.<ref group=Note>The US Department of Agriculture has incorporated this component into its Business Architecture, while the US Department of Defense and Treasury have built it into their Operational Architectures.</ref>\n* ''Applications'' : The Applications component identifies, defines, and organizes the activities that capture, manipulate, and manage the business information to support mission operations. It also describes the logical dependencies and relationships among business activities.<ref group=Note>The US Department of Energy incorporates Business Applications into its Applications Subarchitecture, while the US Department of Treasury includes them in its Functional Architecture.</ref>\n* ''Data Descriptions'': This component of the Enterprise Architecture identifies how data is maintained, accessed, and used. At a high level, agencies define the data and describe the relationships among data elements used in the agency's information systems. The Data Descriptions and Relationships component can include data models that describe the data underlying the business and information needs of the agency. Clearly representing the data and data relationships is important for identifying data that can be shared corporately, for minimizing redundancy, and for supporting new applications<ref group=Note>The US Department of Agriculture has included in this element in its Business/Data Architecture, while the US Department of Treasury incorporates it in its Information Architecture.</ref>\n* ''Technology Infrastructure'' : The Technology Infrastructure component describes and identifies the physical layer including, the functional characteristics, capabilities, and interconnections of the hardware, software, and communications, including networks, protocols, and nodes. It is the \"wiring diagram\" of the physical [[IT infrastructure]].<ref group=Note>The US Department of Agriculture had incorporated this architecture into its Technical Standard and Telecommunications Architectures. US DoD uses its System Architecture, and US Treasury its Infrastrucsture to describe the physical layer.</ref>\n\nWith the exception of the Business Processes component, the interrelationships among and priorities of these components are not prescribed by this guidance; there is no hierarchy of relationships implied. Furthermore, agencies should document not only their current environment for each of these components, but also the target environment that is desired.<ref name=\"M-97-16\"/>\n\n== Applications ==\n<!-- [[File:DoE Information Architecture View.jpg|thumb|DoE Information Architecture View.<ref name=\"FAA98\"/>]]-->\n[[File:FDIC\u2019s Enterprise Architecture Framework.jpg|thumb|FDIC EA Framework.<ref>OIG (2005).

September 1999.</ref>\n\nDeveloped late-1980s by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) and others, the [[federal government of the United States]] promoted this reference model in the 1990s as the foundation for enterprise architectures of individual U.S. government agencies and in the overall [[federal enterprise architecture]].<ref name=\"CIOC99\"/>\n\n== Overview ==\nThe NIST Enterprise Architecture Model is a five-layered model for [[enterprise architecture]], designed for organizing, planning, and building an integrated set of information and information technology architectures. The five layers are defined separately but are interrelated and interwoven.<ref name=\"CIOC99\"/> The model defined the interrelation as follows:<ref name=\"FG89\"/> \n* Business Architecture drives the information architecture\n* Information architecture prescribes the information systems architecture\n* Information systems architecture identifies the data architecture\n* Data Architecture suggests specific data delivery systems, and \n* Data Delivery Systems (Software, Hardware, Communications) support the data architecture. \nThe hierarchy in the model is based on the notion that an organization operates a number of business functions, each function requires information from a number of source, and each of these sources may operate one or more operation systems, which in turn contain data organized and stored in any number of data systems.<ref>John O'Looney (2002). ''Wiring Governments: Challenges and Possibilities for Public Managers''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p.67.</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe NIST Enterprise Architecture Model is initiated in 1988 in the fifth workshop on Information Management Directions sponsored by the NIST in cooperation with the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM), the [[IEEE Computer Society]], and the Federal Data Management Users Group (FEDMUG). The results of this research project were published as the NIST Special Publication 500-167, ''Information Management Directions: The Integration Challenge''.<ref name=\"FG89\">Elizabeth N. Fong and Alan H. Goldfine (1989) ''[http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/specpubs/NIST%20SP%20500-167.pdf Information Management Directions: The Integration Challenge]''. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 500-167, September 1989.</ref>\n\n=== The emerging field of information management ===\nWith the proliferation of [[information technology]] starting in the 1970s, the job of [[information management]] had taken a new light, and also began to include the field of [[data maintenance]]. No longer was information management a simple job that could be performed by almost anyone. An understanding of the technology involved, and the theory behind it became necessary. As [[information storage]] shifted to electronic means, this became more and more difficult.<ref name=\"FG89\"/>\n\n[[Image:4-2 ANSI-SPARC three level architecture.svg|thumb|320px|The notion of a three-schema model was first introduced in 1975 by the [[ANSI-SPARC Architecture|ANSI/X3/SPARC three level architecture]], which determined three levels to model data.<ref name=\"MW99\">Matthew West and Julian Fowler (1999).

The European Process Industries STEP Technical Liaison Executive (EPISTLE).</ref>]]\nOne of the first overall approaches to building [[information systems]] and systems [[information management]] from the 1970s was the [[three-schema approach]]. It proposes to use three different [[view model|views]] in systems development, in which [[conceptual model]]ling is considered to be the key to achieving [[data integration]]:<ref name=\"STRAP08\">[http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/strap/strpsec2.htm STRAP SECTION 2 APPROACH].

Each of the workshops addresses a specific theme:<ref>Fong and Goldfine (1989, p. 5)</ref> \n* \"What information about [[database]] technology does the manager need to make prudent decisions about using new technology\", in 1975.\n* \"What information can help a manager assess the impact on a database system?\" in 1977.\n* \"[[Information management]] tools from the standpoint of: uses; policies and controls; logical and physical database design\" in 1980; and \n* \"The nature of information [[resource management]] practice and problems\" in 1985.\n\nThe fifth workshop in 1989 was held by the National Computer Systems Laboratory (NCSL) of the NIST. By then this was one of the four institutes, that performed the technical work of the NIST. The specific goal of the NCSL was to conduct research and provide scientific and technical services to aid Federal agencies in the selection, acquisition, application, and use of computer technology.<ref>Fong and Goldfine (1989, p. i)</ref>\n\n=== NIST workshop on Information Management Directions  ===\nThe fifth Information Management Directions workshop in 1989 focused on integration and productivity in [[information management]]. Five working groups considered specific aspects of the integration of knowledge, [[data management]], systems planning, development and maintenance, computing environments, architectures and standards. Participants came from academia, industry, government and consulting firms. Among the 72 participants were [[Tom DeMarco]], [[Ahmed K. Elmagarmid]], Elizabeth N. Fong, [[Andrew U.

Bradford Rigdon]] of the McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Company (MDISC), a division of [[McDonnell Douglas]]. Rigdon et al. (1989) <ref name=\"WBR 1989\" >[[W. Bradford Rigdon]] (1989) \"Architectures and Standards\". In: ''Information Management Directions: The Integration Challenge''. E.N. Fong and A.H. Goldfine (eds.). NIST Sept 1989. p. 135-150</ref> explained that discussions about architecture in that time mostly focus on technology concerns. Their aim was to \"takes a broader view, and describes the need for an ''enterprise architecture'' that includes an emphasis on business and information requirements. These higher level issues impact data and technology architectures and decisions.\"<ref name=\"Rigdon\">Rigdon (1989), p. 136</ref> In order to do so, the working group addressed three issues:<ref>Fong and Goldfine (1989, p. 136)</ref>\n* The levels of architecture in an enterprise\n* Problems addressed by architecture\n* Benefits and risks of having architecture\nTo illustrate the levels of architecture, what has become known as the NIST Enterprise Architecture Model, was presented (see image). In this concept the three layers of the [[three-schema approach]] are divided into five layers.\n\n=== Application in the 1990s ===\nIn a way the NIST Enterprise Architecture Model was ahead of his time. According to Zachman (1993) in the 1980s the \"architecture\" was acknowledged as a topic of interest, but there was still little consolidated theory concerning this concept.<ref>J.A Zachman (1993) ''[http://www.ies.aust.com/pdf-papers/zachman3.pdf Concepts for Framework for EA - Enterprise Architecture Resources]''. Zachman International, Inc. paper. p. 1</ref> [[Software architecture]], for example. become an important topic not until the second half of the nineties.<ref>Leonor Barroca, Jon Hall and Patrick Hall (200) \"[http://mcs.open.ac.uk/lmb3/introduction.pdf An Introduction and History of Software Architectures, Components, and Reuse]\" in: ''Software Architectures'', 2000 p. 1</ref>\n\nTo support the NIST Enterprise Architecture Model in the 1990s, it was widely promoted within the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] as Enterprise Architecture management tool.<ref name=\"CIOC99\"/> The NIST Enterprise Architecture Model is applied as foundation in multiple Enterprise Architecture frameworks of U.S. Federal government agencies and in the overall [[Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework]].<ref name=\"CIOC99\"/> In coordinating this effort the NIST model was further explained and extended in the 1997 \"Memoranda 97-16 (Information Technology Architectures)\" issued by the US Office of Management and Budget.,<ref name=\"M-97-16\">Franklin D. Raines, US OBM (1997) ''[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda_m97-16 Memoranda 97-16 (Information Technology Architectures)]'' M-97-16, issued June 18, 1997.</ref> see further [[#Information Technology Architecture|Information Technology Architecture]].\n\n== NIST Enterprise Architecture Model topics ==\n\n=== Foundations ===\nAccording to Rigdon et al. (1989) an architecture is \"a clear representation of a conceptual framework of components and their relationship at a point in time\".<ref>Rigdon et al. (1989, p. 136)</ref> It may for example represent \"a view of a current situation with islands of automation, redundant processes and data inconsistencies\"<ref name= \"Rig 1989, 137\">Rigdon (1989), p. 137</ref> or a \"future integrated automation information structure towards which the enterprise will move in a prescribed number on years.\"<ref>Rigdon et al. (1989, p. 137-38)</ref> The role of standards in architecture is to \"enable or constrain the architecture and serve as its foundation\".<ref name=\"Rig 1989, 137\"/>\n\nIn order to develop an enterprise architecture Rigdon acknowledge:<ref name=\"Rigdon\" />\n* There are multiple ways to develop an architecture  \n* There are multiple ways to implement standards \n* Development and implementation should be customized to the environment\n* Yet, every architecture itself can be divided into different levels. \nThe different levels of an enterprise architecture can be visualized as a pyramid: On top the business unit of an enterprise, and at the bottom the delivery system within the enterprise. The enterprise can consist of one or more business units, working in specific business area. The five levels of architecture are defined as: Business Unit, Information, Information System, Data and Delivery System.<ref name=\"Rig 1989, 137\"/>\n\nThe separate levels of an enterprise architecture are interrelated in a special way. On every level the architectures assumes or dictates the architectures at the higher level. The illustration on the right gives an example of which elements can constitute an Enterprise Architecture.\n[[File:Sample Elements of an Enterprise Architecture (1989).jpg|thumb|Sample elements of an Enterprise Architecture (1989).]]\n\n=== Levels of architecture ===\nEach layer of architecture in the model has a specific intention:<ref>Rigdon et al. (1989, p. 139-140)</ref>\n\n* Business Architecture level: This level can picture the total or a subunit of any corporation, which are in contact with external organizations.    \n* Information architecture level: This level specifies types of content, presentation forms, and format of the information required.   \n* Information systems architecture level: Specifications for automated and procedure-oriented information systems. \n* Data Architecture level: Framework for maintenance, access and use of data, with data dictionary and other naming conventions.   \n* Data Delivery Systems level: Technical implementation level of software, hardware, and communications that support the data architecture.\n\nSome sample elements of how the [[Enterprise Architecture]] can be described in more detail is shown in the illustration.\n\n=== Information Technology Architecture ===\nThe \"Memoranda 97-16 (Information Technology Architectures)\" gave the following definition of enterprise architecture:<ref name=\"M-97-16\"/>\n\n:''The Enterprise Architecture is the explicit description of the current and desired relationships among business and management process and information technology. It describes the \"target\" situation which the agency wishes to create and maintain by managing its IT portfolio.''\n:''The documentation of the Enterprise Architecture should include a discussion of principles and goals.<ref>Examples of published architectural \"frameworks\" include the [[Treasury Information System Architecture Framework]] (TISAF), the US Department of Defense [[Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management]] (TAFIM), and the [[:commons:Category:DOE Information Architecture|Department of Energy's Information Architecture Volume 1]].</ref> For example, the agency's overall management environment, including the balance between centralization and decentralization and the pace of change within the agency, should be clearly understood when developing the Enterprise Architecture. Within that environment, principles and goals set direction on such issues as the promotion of interoperability, open systems, public access, end-user satisfaction, and security.''\n\nIn this guidance the five component model of the NIST was adopted and further explained. Agencies were permitted to identify different components as appropriate and to specify the organizational level at which specific aspects of the components will be implemented. Although the substance of these components, sometimes called \"architectures\" or \"sub-architectures,\" must be addressed in every agency's complete Enterprise Architecture, agencies have great flexibility in describing, combining, and renaming the components, which consist of:<ref name=\"M-97-16\"/>\n\n* ''Business Processes'': This component of the Enterprise Architecture describes the core business processes which support the organization's missions. The Business Processes component is a high-level analysis of the work the agency performs to support the organizations's mission, vision, and goals, and is the foundation of the ITA. Analysis of the business processes determine the information needed and processed by the agency. This aspect of the ITA must be developed by senior program managers in conjunction with IT managers. Without a thorough understanding of its business processes and their relation to the agency missions, the agency will not be able to use its ITA effectively. <br>Business processes can be described by decomposing the processes into derivative business activities. There are a number of methodologies and related tools available to help agencies decompose processes. Irrespective of the tool used, the model should remain at a high enough level to allow a broad agency focus, yet sufficiently detailed to be useful in decision-making as the agency identifies its information needs. Agencies should avoid excessive emphasis on modeling business processes, which can result in a waste of agency resources.<ref group=Note>The US Department of Defense includes aspects of the Business Processes element in its Operational Architecture; the US Department of Treasury incorporates it into its business view.</ref>\n* ''Information Flows and Relationships'': This component analyzes the information utilized by the organization in its business processes, identifying the information used and the movement of the information within the agency. The relationships among the various flows of information are described in this component. These information flows indicate where the information is needed and how the information is shared to support mission functions.<ref group=Note>The US Department of Agriculture has incorporated this component into its Business Architecture, while the US Department of Defense and Treasury have built it into their Operational Architectures.</ref>\n* ''Applications'' : The Applications component identifies, defines, and organizes the activities that capture, manipulate, and manage the business information to support mission operations. It also describes the logical dependencies and relationships among business activities.<ref group=Note>The US Department of Energy incorporates Business Applications into its Applications Subarchitecture, while the US Department of Treasury includes them in its Functional Architecture.</ref>\n* ''Data Descriptions'': This component of the Enterprise Architecture identifies how data is maintained, accessed, and used. At a high level, agencies define the data and describe the relationships among data elements used in the agency's information systems. The Data Descriptions and Relationships component can include data models that describe the data underlying the business and information needs of the agency. Clearly representing the data and data relationships is important for identifying data that can be shared corporately, for minimizing redundancy, and for supporting new applications<ref group=Note>The US Department of Agriculture has included in this element in its Business/Data Architecture, while the US Department of Treasury incorporates it in its Information Architecture.</ref>\n* ''Technology Infrastructure'' : The Technology Infrastructure component describes and identifies the physical layer including, the functional characteristics, capabilities, and interconnections of the hardware, software, and communications, including networks, protocols, and nodes. It is the \"wiring diagram\" of the physical [[IT infrastructure]].<ref group=Note>The US Department of Agriculture had incorporated this architecture into its Technical Standard and Telecommunications Architectures. US DoD uses its System Architecture, and US Treasury its Infrastrucsture to describe the physical layer.</ref>\n\nWith the exception of the Business Processes component, the interrelationships among and priorities of these components are not prescribed by this guidance; there is no hierarchy of relationships implied. Furthermore, agencies should document not only their current environment for each of these components, but also the target environment that is desired.<ref name=\"M-97-16\"/>\n\n== Applications ==\n<!-- [[File:DoE Information Architecture View.jpg|thumb|DoE Information Architecture View.<ref name=\"FAA98\"/>]]-->\n[[File:FDIC\u2019s Enterprise Architecture Framework.jpg|thumb|FDIC EA Framework.<ref>OIG (2005).

Three of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front [[paw]]s, its facial mask, and its ringed tail, which are themes in the [[mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. Raccoons are noted for their [[animal cognition|intelligence]], with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for at least three years.{{sfn|Hohmann|Bartussek|B\u00f6er|2001|pp=71\u201372}} They are usually [[nocturnal]] and [[omnivorous]], eating about 40% [[invertebrate]]s, 33% [[plant]]s, and 27% [[vertebrate]]s.\n\nThe original [[habitat]]s of the raccoon are [[deciduous]] and [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]], but due to their adaptability they have extended their range to mountainous areas, [[coastal marsh]]es, and [[urban area]]s, where some homeowners consider them to be [[Pest (organism)|pests]]. As a result of escapes and deliberate [[introduced species|introductions]] in the mid-20th century, raccoons are now also distributed across much of mainland Europe, [[Caucasus]], and [[Japan]].\n\nThough previously thought to be generally solitary, there is now evidence that raccoons engage in sex-specific [[social behavior]]. Related females often share a common area, while unrelated males live together in groups of up to four raccoons to maintain their positions against foreign males during the mating season, and other potential invaders. [[Home range]] sizes vary anywhere from {{convert|3|ha|acre}} for females in cities to {{convert|5000|ha|acre}} for males in [[prairie]]s. After a [[gestation]] period of about 65 days, two to five young, known as \"kits\", are born in spring. The kits are subsequently raised by their mother until dispersal in late fall. Although captive raccoons have been known to live over 20 years, their life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1&nbsp;years. In many areas, [[hunting]] and vehicular injury are the two most common causes of death.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Raccoon (Procyon lotor) 2.jpg|thumb|The mask of a raccoon is often interrupted by a brown-black streak that extends from forehead to nose.{{sfn|MacClintock|1981|p=5}}]]\n\nThe word \"raccoon\" was adopted into English from the native [[Powhatan language|Powhatan]] term, as used in the [[Colony of Virginia]].

[[bear]]s.{{sfn|Holmgren|1990|pp=47\u201367}} [[Carl Linnaeus]], the father of modern taxonomy, placed the raccoon in the genus ''[[Ursus (genus)|Ursus]]'', first as ''Ursus cauda elongata'' (\"long-tailed bear\") in the second edition of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1740), then as ''Ursus Lotor'' (\"washer bear\") in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition

which can be translated as either \"before the dog\" or \"doglike\".{{sfn|Holmgren|1990|pp=68\u201369}}{{sfn|Zeveloff|2002|p=6}} It is also possible that Storr had its [[nocturnality|nocturnal]]

America.{{sfn|Zeveloff|2002|pp=20, 23}} [[Coati]]s (''Nasua'' and ''Nasuella'') and raccoons (''Procyon'') have been considered to share common descent from a species in the genus ''Paranasua''

In the wild, raccoons often dabble for underwater food near the shore-line. They then often pick up the food item with their front paws to examine it and rub the item, sometimes to remove unwanted parts. This gives the appearance of the raccoon \"washing\" the food. The tactile sensitivity of raccoons' paws is increased if this rubbing action is performed underwater, since the water softens the hard layer covering the paws.{{sfn|Hohmann|Bartussek|B\u00f6er|2001|p=55}}{{sfn|Zeveloff|2002|p=7}} However, the behavior observed in captive raccoons in which they carry their food to water to \"wash\" or douse it before eating has not been observed in the wild.{{sfn|Lagoni-Hansen|1981|p=41}}{{sfn|MacClintock|1981|pp=56\u201357}} [[Natural history|Naturalist]] [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], believed that raccoons do not have adequate [[salivary gland|saliva production]] to moisten food thereby necessitating dousing, but this hypothesis is now considered to be incorrect.{{sfn|Zeveloff|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Lagoni-Hansen|1981|p=41}}{{sfn|Holmgren|1990|p=70}}{{sfn|MacClintock|1981|p=57}} Captive raccoons douse their food more frequently when a watering hole with a layout similar to a stream is not farther away than {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|MacClintock|1981|p=57}} The widely accepted theory is that dousing in captive raccoons is a [[fixed action pattern]] from the dabbling behavior performed when foraging at shores for aquatic foods.{{sfn|Zeveloff|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|MacClintock|1981|p=57}}{{sfn|Hohmann|Bartussek|B\u00f6er|2001|pp=44\u201345}}{{sfn|Lagoni-Hansen|1981|pp=41\u201342}} This is supported by the observation that aquatic foods are doused more frequently.

For example, while raccoons in southern states typically mate later than average, the mating season in [[Manitoba]] also peaks later than usual in March and extends until June.{{sfn|Zeveloff|2002|p=122}} During the mating season, males restlessly roam their home ranges in search of females in an attempt to court them during the three- to four-day period when conception is possible. These encounters will often occur at central meeting places.{{sfn|Hohmann|Bartussek|B\u00f6er|2001|pp=148\u2013150}}{{sfn|Lagoni-Hansen|1981|p=47}}{{sfn|MacClintock|1981|pp=81\u201382}} [[Copulation

group'' also are assumed to get the opportunity to mate, since the stronger ones cannot mate with all available females.{{sfn|Hohmann|Bartussek|B\u00f6er|2001|pp=153\u2013154}} In a study in southern

Three of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front [[paw]]s, its facial mask, and its ringed tail, which are themes in the [[mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. Raccoons are noted for their [[animal cognition|intelligence]], with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for at least three years.{{sfn|Hohmann|Bartussek|B\u00f6er|2001|pp=71\u201372}} They are usually [[nocturnal]] and [[omnivorous]], eating about 40% [[invertebrate]]s, 33% [[plant]]s, and 27% [[vertebrate]]s.\n\nThe original [[habitat]]s of the raccoon are [[deciduous]] and [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]], but due to their adaptability they have extended their range to mountainous areas, [[coastal marsh]]es, and [[urban area]]s, where some homeowners consider them to be [[Pest (organism)|pests]]. As a result of escapes and deliberate [[introduced species|introductions]] in the mid-20th century, raccoons are now also distributed across much of mainland Europe, [[Caucasus]], and [[Japan]].\n\nThough previously thought to be generally solitary, there is now evidence that raccoons engage in sex-specific [[social behavior]]. Related females often share a common area, while unrelated males live together in groups of up to four raccoons to maintain their positions against foreign males during the mating season, and other potential invaders. [[Home range]] sizes vary anywhere from {{convert|3|ha|acre}} for females in cities to {{convert|5000|ha|acre}} for males in [[prairie]]s. After a [[gestation]] period of about 65 days, two to five young, known as \"kits\", are born in spring. The kits are subsequently raised by their mother until dispersal in late fall. Although captive raccoons have been known to live over 20 years, their life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1&nbsp;years. In many areas, [[hunting]] and vehicular injury are the two most common causes of death.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Raccoon (Procyon lotor) 2.jpg|thumb|The mask of a raccoon is often interrupted by a brown-black streak that extends from forehead to nose.{{sfn|MacClintock|1981|p=5}}]]\n\nThe word \"raccoon\" was adopted into English from the native [[Powhatan language|Powhatan]] term, as used in the [[Colony of Virginia]].

the species, [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] thought the raccoon was related to many different species, including [[Canidae|dogs]], [[Felidae|cats]], [[badger]]s and particularly [[bear]]s.{{sfn|Holmgren|1990|pp=47\u201367}} [[Carl Linnaeus]], the father of modern taxonomy, placed the raccoon in the genus ''[[Ursus (genus)|Ursus]]'', first as ''Ursus cauda elongata'' (\"long-tailed bear\") in the second edition of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1740), then as ''Ursus Lotor'' (\"washer bear\") in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition (1758\u201359)]].{{sfn|Holmgren|1990|pp=64\u201367}}{{sfn|Zeveloff|2002|pp=4\u20136}} In 1780, [[Gottlieb Conrad Christian Storr]] placed the raccoon in its own genus ''[[Procyon (genus)|Procyon]]'', which can be translated as either \"before the dog\" or \"doglike\".{{sfn|Holmgren|1990|pp=68\u201369}}{{sfn|Zeveloff|2002|p=6}} It is also possible that Storr had its [[nocturnality|nocturnal]] lifestyle in mind and chose the star [[Procyon]] as eponym for the species.{{sfn|Hohmann|Bartussek|B\u00f6er|2001|p=44}}{{sfn|Holmgren|1990|p=68}}\n\n=== Evolution ===\nBased on [[fossil]] evidence from Russia and Bulgaria, the first known members of the family [[Procyonidae]] lived in Europe in the late [[Oligocene]] about 25 million years ago.{{sfn|Zeveloff|2002|p=19}} Similar tooth and skull structures suggest procyonids and [[Mustelidae|weasels]] share a common ancestor, but molecular analysis indicates a closer relationship between raccoons and bears.{{sfn|Zeveloff|2002|pp=16\u201318, 26}} After the then-existing species crossed the [[Bering Strait]] at least six million years later in the early [[Miocene]], the center of its distribution was probably in Central America.{{sfn|Zeveloff|2002|pp=20, 23}} [[Coati]]s (''Nasua'' and ''Nasuella'') and raccoons (''Procyon'') have been considered to share common descent from a species in the genus ''Paranasua'' present between 5.2 and 6.0&nbsp;million years ago.{{sfn|Zeveloff|2002|p=24}} This assumption, based on morphological comparisons of fossils, conflicts with a 2006 genetic analysis which indicates raccoons are more closely related to [[Bassariscus|ringtails]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Koepfli|first=Klaus-Peter|last2=Gompper |first2=Matthew E. |last3=Eizirik |first3=Eduardo |last4=Ho

They then often pick up the food item with their front paws to examine it and rub the item, sometimes to remove unwanted parts. This gives the appearance of the raccoon \"washing\" the food.

Overall, 1,222 individuals were released, 64 of which came from zoos and fur farms (38 of them having been imports from western Europe). The remainder originated from a population previously established in [[Transcaucasia]]. The range of Soviet raccoons was never single or continuous, as they were often introduced to different locations far from each other. All introductions into the [[Russian Far East]] failed; melanistic raccoons were released on Petrov Island near [[Vladivostok]] and some areas of southern [[Primorsky Krai]], but died. In [[Middle Asia]], raccoons were released in [[Kyrgyzstan]]'s [[Jalal-Abad Province]], though they were later recorded as \"practically absent\" there in January 1963. A large and stable raccoon population (yielding 1000\u20131500 catches a year) was established in [[Azerbaijan]] after an introduction to the area in 1937. Raccoons apparently survived an introduction near [[Terek River|Terek]], along the [[Sulak River]] into the [[Dagestan]]i lowlands. Attempts to settle raccoons on the [[Kuban River]]'s left tributary and [[Kabardino-Balkaria]] were unsuccessful. A successful acclimatization occurred in [[Belarus]], where three introductions (consisting of 52, 37 and 38 individuals in 1954 and 1958) took place.

Despite the name \"Karelian question\", the term may refer also to the return of [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]], ceded parts of [[Salla]] and [[Kuusamo]], and four islands in the [[Gulf of Finland]]. Sometimes the phrase \"debate on the return of the ceded territories\" (''luovutettujen alueiden palautuskeskustelu'') is used. The Karelian question remains a matter of public debate rather than a political issue.\n\n== History ==\nThe Karelian question arose when Finland was forced to cede territories to the Soviet Union after the [[Winter War]] in the [[Moscow peace treaty]] in 1940. Most [[Finnish citizen]]s were [[Evacuation of Finnish Karelia|evacuated from the ceded areas]]. Most of them returned during the [[Continuation War]] and eventually were evacuated again in 1944. The Soviet Union insisted the ceded areas be  completely evacuated in 10 days. The evacuees were partly compensated for their losses; farmers, for example, received land in proportion to their earlier holdings. Usually, the compensation was about one third of the original farm. Compensation for movable property was much less. However, all evacuee families had a right to receive a small farm, and/or a plot for a detached house or a flat. The land used for these grants was confiscated by the state from municipalities and private owners. Financial compensation was funded by a general property tax of 10 to 30%, levied over a period of several years.<ref>[http://aluepalautus.net/uusi/arkisto/2003/15092003a.htm Karjalan suomalaistilojen korvaukset Sodan j\u00e4lkeeen.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408061845/http://aluepalautus.net/uusi/arkisto/2003/15092003a.htm |date=2008-04-08 }} Reino Paju 9-15-2003.

The standard of living on the Russian side of the border is much lower than on the Finnish side. The [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP (PPP) per capita]] in Finland is about double that of Russia.\n\nThe costs of bringing Karelia to the same level with the rest of Finland have been researched only by supporters of the idea. According to a survey conducted by ProKarelia, the area has natural advantages that, under Finnish rule, would make it a centre of trade with Russia and industry and thus bring economic growth fast enough to solve the entire problem.

Despite the name \"Karelian question\", the term may refer also to the return of [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]], ceded parts of [[Salla]] and [[Kuusamo]], and four islands in the [[Gulf of Finland]]. Sometimes the phrase \"debate on the return of the ceded territories\" (''luovutettujen alueiden palautuskeskustelu'') is used. The Karelian question remains a matter of public debate rather than a political issue.\n\n== History ==\nThe Karelian question arose when Finland was forced to cede territories to the Soviet Union after the [[Winter War]] in the [[Moscow peace treaty]] in 1940. Most [[Finnish citizen]]s were [[Evacuation of Finnish Karelia|evacuated from the ceded areas]]. Most of them returned during the [[Continuation War]] and eventually were evacuated again in 1944. The Soviet Union insisted the ceded areas be  completely evacuated in 10 days. The evacuees were partly compensated for their losses; farmers, for example, received land in proportion to their earlier holdings. Usually, the compensation was about one third of the original farm. Compensation for movable property was much less. However, all evacuee families had a right to receive a small farm, and/or a plot for a detached house or a flat. The land used for these grants was confiscated by the state from municipalities and private owners. Financial compensation was funded by a general property tax of 10 to 30%, levied over a period of several years.<ref>[http://aluepalautus.net/uusi/arkisto/2003/15092003a.htm Karjalan suomalaistilojen korvaukset Sodan j\u00e4lkeeen.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408061845/http://aluepalautus.net/uusi/arkisto/2003/15092003a.htm |date=2008-04-08 }} Reino Paju 9-15-2003.

According to another poll conducted by ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', 42% of Finns opposing the return list that as the most important single reason. The standard of living on the Russian side of the border is much lower than on the Finnish side. The [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP (PPP) per capita]] in Finland is about double that of Russia.\n\nThe costs of bringing Karelia to the same level with the rest of Finland have been researched only by supporters of the idea. According to a survey conducted by ProKarelia, the area has natural advantages that, under Finnish rule, would make it a centre of trade with Russia and industry and thus bring economic growth fast enough to solve the entire problem. According to both ProKarelian research and Arto Lahti's estimate, the price of return would be about 30 billion [[euro]].<ref name=\"reform\">[http://www.prokarelia.net/en/?x=reform  ProKarelia's Reform]</ref><ref>[http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/cgi-bin/pika/jutut.pl?/arkisto/Arkisto_1999/3.joulukuu/base+1643  Karjalan palauttamisen lasketaan kannattavan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408094839/http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/cgi-bin/pika/jutut.pl?%2Farkisto%2FArkisto_1999%2F3.joulukuu%2Fbase+1643 |date=2008-04-08 }}</ref><ref>Arto Lahti's lecture in Karjala seminar 23 August 2005 [http://prokarelia.net/fi/?x=artikkeli&article_id=656&author=65 abridgement]</ref>\n\n=== Population ===\n[[Image:Sortavalan maaseutua.jpg|thumb|Countryside houses. A picture from [[Sortavala]].]]\nThe area is inhabited mostly by people who moved there from [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and Russia, and their descendants. The fate of these people is a major issue in discussions of the return of Karelia to Finland. According to the poll by ''Helsingin Sanomat'', 14% of people opposing return consider its greatest flaw the tensions that would be caused by a Russian-speaking minority being formed in Finland. In 2004, there were about 370,000 Russians living in the region.<ref>[http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/html/TOM_01_04_2.htm 2004 Russian Census]</ref>\n\nIf the inhabitants were allowed to stay in their homes, Finland would receive a few hundred thousand new Russian-speaking people with no experience of living in Finnish society. If services for them in their own language were to be provided, Finland would need many more officials capable of speaking Russian. In ProKarelia's vision, nearly half of the Russian population in Karelia would be [[deportation|expelled]] to Russia, and even more would leave if Finland paid their expenses for doing so.<ref name=\"reform\"/> However most of the Russian speaking population of Karelia were born there and have spent all their life in the region.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Continuation War]]\n* [[Former eastern territories of Germany]]\n* [[Greater Finland]]\n* [[Interim Peace]]\n* [[Irredentism]]\n* [[Kaliningrad question]]\n* [[Lapland War]]\n* [[Moscow Armistice]]\n* [[Moscow Peace Treaty]]\n* [[Reunification]]\n* [[Territorial changes of the Baltic states]]\n* [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Finnish)]]\n* [[Unification of Romania and Moldova]]\n* [[Winter War]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=172062&contentlan=2&culture=en-US Saimaa Canal links two Karelias, thisisFINLAND]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131018015359/http://www.hs.fi/english/article/ProKarelia+movement+wants+back+ceded+areas+as+well+as+war+reparations+paid+to+the+Soviet+Union+/1101978717301 Helsingin Sanomat 3 March 2005.

Kesri was arrested for his political activities several times between 1930 and 1942. Kesri was a part of the famous Young Turks of Bihar Congress during the independence movement along with [[Bindeshwari Dubey]], [[Bhagwat Jha Azad]], [[Chandrashekhar Singh]], [[Satyendra Narayan Sinha]], [[Kedar Pandey]] and  [[Abdul Gafoor]] all future [[Chief Ministers of Bihar]].\n\n===Political Career in Independent India===\nKesri was elected president of the [[Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee]] in 1973 and treasurer of the [[All India Congress Committee]] (AICC) in 1980.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sitaram Kesri: President \u2013 Indian National Congress|url=http://www.congresssandesh.com/AICC/history/presidents/sitaramkesri.htm |publisher=Congress Sandesh }}</ref>\n\nKesri was elected to the [[Lok Sabha]] from the [[Katihar (Lok Sabha constituency)|Katihar]] [[List of Constituencies of the Lok Sabha|Lok Sabha Constituency]] in 1967 as a candidate of Congress party. He represented Bihar in the [[Rajya Sabha]] for five terms between July 1971 and April 2000, being reelected on April 1974, July 1980, April 1988, and April 1994.<ref name=\"Rajya Sabha\">{{cite web|url=http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/alphabeticallist_all_terms.aspx |title=List of Rajya Sabha members Since 1952 }}</ref> He was Union Minister during the regimes of [[Indira Gandhi]], [[Rajiv Gandhi]] and [[P.V. Narasimha Rao]] as [[Prime Minister of India]].\n\nKesri served as treasurer of the Congress party for more than a decade. In addition, he was elected unanimously as President of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Parliamentary Party]] on 3 January 1997. After his exit from office in March 1998, he maintained a relatively low profile in politics. He was also denied party candidature for the [[Rajya Sabha]] once his last term ended in April 2000.\n\n===As the President of the Indian National Congress===\nAfter P.V. Narasimha Rao stepped down as president of the Congress in September 1996, Kesri was appointed as the new president of the Indian National Congress.\n\nThe following years were difficult for the Congress Party. Kesri's lack of popular support among the masses caused further damage to the party. Kesri's most controversial act was the sudden withdrawal of support to H.D. Deva Gowda's United Front government, which led to the fall of the government in April 1997. However, a compromise was reached and the United Front elected [[I.K. Gujral]] as the subsequent new leader with continued support from the Congress party.\n\nIn the first week of November 1997, part of the [[Milap Chand Jain|Jain Commission's]] report inquiring into the conspiracy angle of the assassination of [[Rajiv Gandhi]] was leaked to the press.\n\nIt was reported that the Jain Commission had indicted [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)]] for its ties with the [[LTTE]], the organisation involved in the assassination of Gandhi.\n\nThe DMK was one of the constituents of the United Front that was in power at the center. Moreover the party had three ministers on the council of ministers headed by Prime Minister [[Inder Kumar Gujral]]. The Congress demanded removal from the government the ministers belonging to the DMK.\n\nBetween 20 and 28 November 1997, an exchange of letters took place between Kesri and Prime Minister [[Inder Kumar Gujral|Gujral]]; however, the prime minister refused to meet the demands of the Congress. Finally, on 28 November 1997, Congress withdrew its support for the [[I. K. Gujral ministry|Gujral government]]. When no alternative government could be formed, the Lok Sabha was dissolved, paving the way for midterm elections.\n\nThe Congress did not adequately prepare for the midterm elections. A number of senior leaders of the party, such as [[Rangarajan Kumaramangalam]], [[Aslam Sher Khan]], and other leaders, openly expressed displeasure with Kesri's leadership and left the party.\n\nAfter [[Sonia Gandhi]] decided to campaign for the party, she replaced Kesri as the main party campaigner. Sonia attracted huge crowds in her campaign rallies but did not win the election for the party.\n\nNevertheless, the Congress did maintain a respectable tally of 140 seats. During the election campaign, there were a series of bomb blasts in [[Coimbatore]], where [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP President]] [[Lal Krishna Advani]] was scheduled to address an election rally. About 50 people were killed in the blasts.\n\nAfter the blasts, Kesri made a statement that the bomb blasts were the handiwork of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] and moreover, he had the proof of RSS involvement in the blasts. The RSS sued Kesri for defamation, but Kesri was granted bail by a city court in 1998.<ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19980505/12550234.html Sitaram Kesri gets bail in RSS defamation case] Indian Express \u2013 5 May 1998</ref>\n\nAfter the electoral defeat, Kesri was stripped of his post in March 1998 by the [[Congress Working Committee]].<ref name=\"TH\">[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2000/10/26/stories/02260001.htm Kesri and three transitions in Cong.] The Hindu \u2013 26 October 2000</ref> Sonia Gandhi was appointed president of the Congress party in his place.

Over time, more areas have been protected as the ecological importance and uniqueness of different ecosystems were realized.<ref name=Pringle2017/> Much of the acquired land was subjected to human use for around 400 years. Such activities included [[deforestation]], agriculture, hunting, and animal grazing. A major issue with this was fire spreading from the new grasslands that resulted from land clearing to the remaining tropical dry forest fragments.<ref name=\"num 1\"/> Today, the Guanacaste area has experienced some successful [[secondary forest]] re-growth. After forests were heavily felled due to increased colonization and a growing beef industry between the 1950s and 1980s, Guanacaste tropical dry forest cover expanded to 47.9% in 2005.<ref name=\"num 1\"/>\n\n===Formation===\nGuanacaste Conservation Area started with the creation of the 10,400-acre [[Santa Rosa National Park]] in 1971 under the Executive Decree 1562-A/71. In 1973, the Rinc\u00f3n de la Vieja National Park was created under law No. 5398. In 1988, [[Junquillal Bay Wildlife Refuge]] was donated and incorporated into the conservation area. Originally proposed by [[Daniel H. Janzen|Dr. Daniel H. Janzen]] and his wife, Winnie Hallwachs, in 1986, Guanacaste National Park was established in 1989 by Executive Decree 19124-MIRENEM/89. 1989 also saw the creation of \u00c1rea de Conservaci\u00f3n Guanacaste (ACG). This area is composed of Santa Rosa National Park, Rinc\u00f3n de la Vieja National Park, [[Junquillal Bay Wildlife Refuge]], and Guanacaste National Park. The most recent addition to this grouping is the Santa Elena Sector, added in 2004. The ACG was legally added as a part of the [[National System of Conservation Areas]] (SINAC) in 1994 by Executive Decree 22909.<ref name=\"num 2\"/><ref name=\"num 7\">{{cite journal|last1=Bussing|first1=William|title=A new species of poeciliid fish, ''Poeciliopsis santaelena'', from Peninsula Santa Elena, Area de Conservaci\u00f3n Guanacaste, Costa Rica |journal=Revista de Biolog\u00eda Tropical |date=2008 |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=829\u2013838 |url=http://www.scielo.sa.cr/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0034-77442008000200031 |accessdate=14 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, the area was admitted as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].

Also in 1987 was the incorporation of 7,000 hectares of donated experimental forest stations. Further adding to the protected area was the acquisition of 2,000 acres of farms with forests and pastures between the Cacao and Rinc\u00f3n de la Vieja volcanos.<ref name=\"num 7\"/> This great level of historical (and ongoing) land acquisition results in the Guanacaste Conservation Area housing a plethora of plant and animals species; it is approximated that it protects approximately 2.4% of the world\u2019s terrestrial biodiversity (around 375,000 species).<ref name=\"num 8\">{{cite book|last1=Janzen|first1=D.H. |chapter=Guanacaste National Park: tropical ecological and biocultural restoration|title=Rehabilitating Damaged Ecosystems |editor=J.J.

Dry forest, coastal region, and wet forest are among the different ecosystems that Guanacaste has to offer for the Biological Education Program.<ref name=\"num 1\"/> Neighboring schools take scheduled visits to the conservation area for the sole purpose of acquiring knowledge by hands-on learning. The program works with 53 surrounding schools, with most park visitors being in grades 4th through 6th.<ref name=\"num 1\"/> The goal of this program is for humans to coexist with their biological surroundings, and for people to use personal experience to become more sensitive to the importance of biology and ecology.\n\n===Marine Biosensitivity Program===\nThe Marine Biosensitivity Program at Guanacaste Conservation Area introduces students to marine life through interactive studies and instructs them on how to conserve and improve the aquatic environment. Summer camps are held between the months of January and April at the bat sector. This area is great for river and beach access, as well as being rich with resources that help with certain educational activities.<ref name=\"num 1\"/> Researching specific marine species and learning the natural history of the living organisms in the area are a few of the many activities that students participate in to engage with their surroundings.<ref name=\"num 1\"/>\n\n===Environmental Education Program===\nThe purpose of the program is to use education to instill the ideas of environmental conservation and protection in students. Workshops are provided for students to create and plan different projects that aim to preserve the tropical forests. Some projects that have been conducted include science fairs, waste separation, and the use of waste materials in arts and crafts. Each project is either centered around, or develops, a topic that deals with the environment. Some topics include the importance of water, recycling, and natural resources.<ref name=\"num 1\"/>\n\n===Ecotourism program===\nThe ecotourism program allows visitors to explore the area of Guanacaste and its attractions while learning about the conservation of the ecosystems. The program aims to make tourism a part of the conservation effort, while also informing visitors of the biodiversity that the park has to offer. Planning and management examine tourist sites to fit the needs of both the tourists and the environment. The information section writes brochures and pamphlets that visitors can use while exploring the conservation area. With the efforts put in by both management and tourists, Guanacaste Conservation Area is able to use its natural surroundings for both pleasurable and educational purposes.<ref name=\"num 1\"/>\n\n===Research program===\nThe ACG has a research program that is intended to help researchers on their own scientific projects. The research program allows people to use the conservation area to study organisms and their habitat as long as they abide by the rules of protection.

Over time, more areas have been protected as the ecological importance and uniqueness of different ecosystems were realized.<ref name=Pringle2017/> Much of the acquired land was subjected to human use for around 400 years. Such activities included [[deforestation]], agriculture, hunting, and animal grazing. A major issue with this was fire spreading from the new grasslands that resulted from land clearing to the remaining tropical dry forest fragments.<ref name=\"num 1\"/> Today, the Guanacaste area has experienced some successful [[secondary forest]] re-growth. After forests were heavily felled due to increased colonization and a growing beef industry between the 1950s and 1980s, Guanacaste tropical dry forest cover expanded to 47.9% in 2005.<ref name=\"num 1\"/>\n\n===Formation===\nGuanacaste Conservation Area started with the creation of the 10,400-acre [[Santa Rosa National Park]] in 1971 under the Executive Decree 1562-A/71. In 1973, the Rinc\u00f3n de la Vieja National Park was created under law No. 5398. In 1988, [[Junquillal Bay Wildlife Refuge]] was donated and incorporated into the conservation area. Originally proposed by [[Daniel H. Janzen|Dr. Daniel H. Janzen]] and his wife, Winnie Hallwachs, in 1986, Guanacaste National Park was established in 1989 by Executive Decree 19124-MIRENEM/89. 1989 also saw the creation of \u00c1rea de Conservaci\u00f3n Guanacaste (ACG). This area is composed of Santa Rosa National Park, Rinc\u00f3n de la Vieja National Park, [[Junquillal Bay Wildlife Refuge]], and Guanacaste National Park. The most recent addition to this grouping is the Santa Elena Sector, added in 2004. The ACG was legally added as a part of the [[National System of Conservation Areas]] (SINAC) in 1994 by Executive Decree 22909.<ref name=\"num 2\"/><ref name=\"num 7\">{{cite journal|last1=Bussing|first1=William|title=A new species of poeciliid fish, ''Poeciliopsis santaelena'', from Peninsula Santa Elena, Area de Conservaci\u00f3n Guanacaste, Costa Rica |journal=Revista de Biolog\u00eda Tropical |date=2008 |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=829\u2013838 |url=http://www.scielo.sa.cr/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0034-77442008000200031 |accessdate=14 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, the area was admitted as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]. According to UNESCO, \u201cit contains important natural habitats for the conservation of biological diversity, including the best dry forest habitats from Central America to northern Mexico and key habitats for endangered or rare plant and animal species.

In 1987, the Murci\u00e9lago Islands archipelago and 6 kilometers of ocean extending out from the Santa Elena Peninsula were added to ACG. Also in 1987 was the incorporation of 7,000 hectares of donated experimental forest stations. Further adding to the protected area was the acquisition of 2,000 acres of farms with forests and pastures between the Cacao and Rinc\u00f3n de la Vieja volcanos.<ref name=\"num 7\"/> This great level of historical (and ongoing) land acquisition results in the Guanacaste Conservation Area housing a plethora of plant and animals species; it is approximated that it protects approximately 2.4% of the world\u2019s terrestrial biodiversity (around 375,000 species).<ref name=\"num 8\">{{cite book|last1=Janzen|first1=D.H. |chapter=Guanacaste National Park: tropical ecological and biocultural restoration|title=Rehabilitating Damaged Ecosystems |editor=J.J.

The program works with 53 surrounding schools, with most park visitors being in grades 4th through 6th.<ref name=\"num 1\"/> The goal of this program is for humans to coexist with their biological surroundings, and for people to use personal experience to become more sensitive to the importance of biology and ecology.\n\n===Marine Biosensitivity Program===\nThe Marine Biosensitivity Program at Guanacaste Conservation Area introduces students to marine life through interactive studies and instructs them on how to conserve and improve the aquatic environment. Summer camps are held between the months of January and April at the bat sector. This area is great for river and beach access, as well as being rich with resources that help with certain educational activities.<ref name=\"num 1\"/> Researching specific marine species and learning the natural history of the living organisms in the area are a few of the many activities that students participate in to engage with their surroundings.<ref name=\"num 1\"/>\n\n===Environmental Education Program===\nThe purpose of the program is to use education to instill the ideas of environmental conservation and protection in students. Workshops are provided for students to create and plan different projects that aim to preserve the tropical forests. Some projects that have been conducted include science fairs, waste separation, and the use of waste materials in arts and crafts. Each project is either centered around, or develops, a topic that deals with the environment. Some topics include the importance of water, recycling, and natural resources.<ref name=\"num 1\"/>\n\n===Ecotourism program===\nThe ecotourism program allows visitors to explore the area of Guanacaste and its attractions while learning about the conservation of the ecosystems. The program aims to make tourism a part of the conservation effort, while also informing visitors of the biodiversity that the park has to offer. Planning and management examine tourist sites to fit the needs of both the tourists and the environment. The information section writes brochures and pamphlets that visitors can use while exploring the conservation area. With the efforts put in by both management and tourists, Guanacaste Conservation Area is able to use its natural surroundings for both pleasurable and educational purposes.<ref name=\"num 1\"/>\n\n===Research program===\nThe ACG has a research program that is intended to help researchers on their own scientific projects. The research program allows people to use the conservation area to study organisms and their habitat as long as they abide by the rules of protection. Any research project is welcome to the program, and at least 20 projects are started every year.<ref name=\"num 1\"/> There are two coordinators of the park who support and guide students, and researchers, on their individual projects.

It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and is the home ground of [[FK Vojvodina]]. The stadium is one of the most modern stadiums in Serbia and has one of the best pitches in the country. The stadium has a total of 14,458 [[seating capacity|seats]] after new renovations were made in 2013. The stadium is also the home ground for the Serbian U-21 football team.\n\n==History==\nIn late May 2007, the stadium was the site of [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107|Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107's]] testimonial match. In 2009, the stadium was given a new athletic track, the southeast stand and a modern Philips scoreboard. After the reconstruction in 2009, it was the venue of the [[2009 European Athletics Junior Championships]] and the [[2011 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship]]. In 2011, FK Vojvodina installed floodlights with strength of 1,400 lux. The largest attendance was on 1 March 1967 when Vojvodina played against Scottish side [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in the [[1966&ndash;67 European Cup]] quarter-final.<ref name = \"scotland\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/top-football-stories/ticket-rush-as-scotland-play-serbia-in-novi-sad-1-2720101 |title=Ticket rush as Scotland play Serbia in Novi Sad |work=sport.scotsman.com |publisher=Johnston Publishing |date=5 January 2013 |accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref> There was about 30,000 spectators.<ref name = \"scotland\"/>\n\nFormerly, it was known as the ''Vojvodina Stadium'' ({{lang-sr|\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e\u043d \u0412\u043e\u0458\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435}}, {{lang|sr-Latn|Stadion Vojvodine}}) or ''City Stadium'' (Serbian: \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e\u043d, ''Gradski stadion''). In 2007, the stadium was renamed to Kara\u0111or\u0111e Stadium after [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]] \"Black George\", the leader of the [[First Serbian uprising]]. However, Kara\u0111or\u0111e Stadium was in fact the older and original name of the stadium that was used from its foundation in 1924 until the end of the [[Second World War]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fkvojvodina.rs/stadion/stadion-detaljno/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702073846/http://www.fkvojvodina.rs/stadion/stadion-detaljno/ |archivedate=2012-07-02 }} FK Vojvodina: Stadion detaljno (Serbian)</ref>\n\n==Recent upgrades and developments==\nIn early 2012, the executive board announced further reconstructions of the Kara\u0111or\u0111e stadium.
