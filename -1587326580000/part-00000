Roxas claimed that in [[Baguio City]] in 1961 he met the son of a former member of the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]] who mapped for him the location of the legendary Yamashita Treasure. Roxas claimed a second man, who served as Yamashita's interpreter during the World War II, told him of visiting an underground chamber there where stores of gold and silver were kept, and who told of a golden [[Buddharupa|buddha]] kept at a convent located near the underground chambers. Roxas claimed that within the next few years he formed a group to search for the treasure, and obtained a permit for the purpose from a relative of Ferdinand, Judge Pio Marcos. In 1971, Roxas claimed, he and his group uncovered an enclosed chamber on state lands near Baguio City where he found bayonets, [[samurai sword]]s, radios, and skeletal remains dressed in a Japanese military uniform. Also found in the chamber, Roxas claimed, were a {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} golden-colored Buddha and numerous stacked crates which filled an area approximately 6 feet x 6 feet x 35 feet. He claimed he opened just one of the boxes, and found it packed with gold bullion. He said he took from the chamber the golden Buddha, which he estimated to weigh 1,000 kilograms, and one box with twenty-four gold bars, and hid them in his home. He claimed he resealed the chamber for safekeeping until he could arrange the removal of the remaining boxes, which he suspected were also filled with gold bars. Roxas said he sold seven of the gold bars from the opened box, and sought potential buyers for the golden Buddha. Two individuals representing prospective buyers examined and tested the metal in the Buddha, Roxas said, and reported it was made of solid, 20-carat gold. It was soon after this, Roxas claimed, that President Ferdinand Marcos learned of Roxas' discovery and ordered him arrested, beaten, and the Buddha and remaining gold seized. Roxas alleged that in retaliation to his vocal campaign to reclaim the Buddha and the remainder of the treasure taken from him, Ferdinand continued to have Roxas threatened, beaten and eventually incarcerated for over a year.<ref name=\"uniset.ca\"/>\n\nFollowing his release, Roxas put his claims against Marcos on hold until Ferdinand lost the presidency in 1986. But in 1988, Roxas and the Golden Budha Corporation, which now held the ownership rights to the treasure Roxas claims was stolen from him, filed suit against Ferdinand and wife Imelda in a Hawaiian state court seeking damages for the theft and the surrounding human rights abuses committed against Roxas. Roxas died on the eve of trial,<ref>\"22-billion award vs. Marcoses reversed\", ''Filipino Express'', November 29, 1998</ref> but prior to his death he gave the deposition testimony that would be later used in evidence. In 1996, the Roxas estate and the Golden Budha Corporation received what was then-largest judgment ever awarded in history, $22 billion, which with interest increased to $40.5 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://starbulletin.com/2000/02/29/news/story3.html |title=Lawyers Debate Value of Stolen Gold|publisher=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |date=2000-02-29 |accessdate=2012-03-26}}</ref> In 1998, the Hawaii Supreme Court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Roxas found the treasure and that Marcos converted it. However, the court reversed the damage award, holding that the $22 billion award of damages for the chamber full of gold was too speculative, as there was no evidence of quantity or quality, and ordered a new hearing on the value of the golden Buddha and 17 bars of gold only.<ref name=\"uniset.ca\"/> After several more years of legal proceedings, the Golden Budha Corporation obtained a final judgment against Imelda Marcos to the extent of her interest in the Marcos estate in the principal amount of $13,275,848.37 and Roxas\u2019 estate obtained a $6 million judgment on the claim for human right abuse.<ref>See:\n* [http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news05_jan28_2006 \"Manila Standard Today, Marcos Victims Dying To Get Paid, January 28, 2006\"]\n* [http://www.metnews.com/articles/2006/marc050506.htm Marcos Torture Victims Entitled to Millions, Ninth Circuit Says, Metropolitan News-Enterprise, May 5, 2006]\n* ''Republic of the Philippines v Pimentel, [http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/Arelma_Petitionfinal.pdf Petition for a Writ for Certiorari, United States Supreme Court]\n* ''Judge allots $35 million to plaintiffs vs. Marcos'' [http://archives.starbulletin.com/2004/07/13/news/story3.html Honolulu Star-Bulletin, July 13, 2004]</ref>\n\nThis lawsuit ultimately concluded that Roxas found a treasure, and although the Hawaiian state court was not required to determine whether this particular treasure was the legendary Yamashita\u2019s gold, the testimony relied upon by the court in reaching its conclusion pointed in that direction. Roxas was allegedly following a map from the son of a Japanese soldier; Roxas allegedly relied on tips provided from Yamashita\u2019s interpreter; and Roxas allegedly found samurai swords and the skeletons of dead Japanese soldiers in the treasure chamber.

Two individuals representing prospective buyers examined and tested the metal in the Buddha, Roxas said, and reported it was made of solid, 20-carat gold. It was soon after this, Roxas claimed, that President Ferdinand Marcos learned of Roxas' discovery and ordered him arrested, beaten, and the Buddha and remaining gold seized. Roxas alleged that in retaliation to his vocal campaign to reclaim the Buddha and the remainder of the treasure taken from him, Ferdinand continued to have Roxas threatened, beaten and eventually incarcerated for over a year.<ref name=\"uniset.ca\"/>\n\nFollowing his release, Roxas put his claims against Marcos on hold until Ferdinand lost the presidency in 1986. But in 1988, Roxas and the Golden Budha Corporation, which now held the ownership rights to the treasure Roxas claims was stolen from him, filed suit against Ferdinand and wife Imelda in a Hawaiian state court seeking damages for the theft and the surrounding human rights abuses committed against Roxas. Roxas died on the eve of trial,<ref>\"22-billion award vs. Marcoses reversed\", ''Filipino Express'', November 29, 1998</ref> but prior to his death he gave the deposition testimony that would be later used in evidence. In 1996, the Roxas estate and the Golden Budha Corporation received what was then-largest judgment ever awarded in history, $22 billion which with interest increased to $40.5 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://starbulletin.com/2000/02/29/news/story3.html |title=Lawyers Debate Value of Stolen Gold|publisher=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |date=2000-02-29 |accessdate=2012-03-26}}</ref> In 1998, the Hawaii Supreme Court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Roxas found the treasure and that Marcos converted it. However, the court reversed the damage award, holding that the $22 billion award of damages for the chamber full of gold was too speculative, as there was no evidence of quantity or quality, and ordered a new hearing on the value of the golden Buddha and 17 bars of gold only.<ref name=\"uniset.ca\"/> After several more years of legal proceedings, the Golden Budha Corporation obtained a final judgment against Imelda Marcos to the extent of her interest in the Marcos estate in the principal amount of $13,275,848.37 and Roxas\u2019 estate obtained a $6 million judgment on the claim for human right abuse.<ref>See:\n* [http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news05_jan28_2006 \"Manila Standard Today, Marcos Victims Dying To Get Paid, January 28, 2006\"]\n* [http://www.metnews.com/articles/2006/marc050506.htm Marcos Torture Victims Entitled to Millions, Ninth Circuit Says, Metropolitan News-Enterprise, May 5, 2006]\n* ''Republic of the Philippines v Pimentel, [http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/Arelma_Petitionfinal.pdf Petition for a Writ for Certiorari, United States Supreme Court]\n* ''Judge allots $35 million to plaintiffs vs. Marcos'' [http://archives.starbulletin.com/2004/07/13/news/story3.html Honolulu Star-Bulletin, July 13, 2004]</ref>\n\nThis lawsuit ultimately concluded that Roxas found a treasure, and although the Hawaiian state court was not required to determine whether this particular treasure was the legendary Yamashita\u2019s gold, the testimony relied upon by the court in reaching its conclusion pointed in that direction. Roxas was allegedly following a map from the son of a Japanese soldier; Roxas allegedly relied on tips provided from Yamashita\u2019s interpreter; and Roxas allegedly found samurai swords and the skeletons of dead Japanese soldiers in the treasure chamber.

On [[Earth]], sunlight is [[light scattering by particles|scattered]] and [[attenuation|filtered]] through [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], and is obvious as [[daylight]] when the Sun is above the [[horizon]]. When direct [[solar radiation]] is not blocked by [[cloud]]s, it is experienced as '''sunshine''', a combination of bright [[light]] and [[radiant heat]]. When [[cloud cover|blocked]] by clouds or [[diffuse reflection|reflected off other objects]], sunlight is [[diffuser (optics)|diffused]]. The [[World Meteorological Organization]] uses the term \"[[sunshine duration]]\" to mean the cumulative time during which an area receives direct [[irradiance]] from the Sun of at least 120 [[watt]]s per [[square meter]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/CIMO-Guide/CIMO%20Guide%207th%20Edition,%202008/Part%20I/Chapter%208.pdf | title=Chapter 8 \u2013 Measurement of sunshine duration | work=CIMO Guide | publisher=[[World Meteorological Organization]] | access-date=2008-12-01 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002230747/http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/CIMO-Guide/CIMO%20Guide%207th%20Edition,%202008/Part%20I/Chapter%208.pdf | archive-date=2012-10-02 | df= }}</ref> Other sources indicate an \"Average over the entire earth\" of \"164 Watts per square meter over a 24 hour day\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://zebu.uoregon.edu/disted/ph162/l4.html | title=Basics of Solar | access-date=2016-12-06 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128021408/http://zebu.uoregon.edu/disted/ph162/l4.html | archive-date=2016-11-28 | df= }}</ref>\n\nThe ultraviolet radiation in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects, as it is both a requisite for [[vitamin D3|vitamin D<sub>3</sub>]] synthesis and a [[mutagen]]. \n\nSunlight takes about 8.3&nbsp;minutes to reach Earth from the surface of the Sun. A photon starting at the center of the Sun and changing direction every time it encounters a [[charged particle]] would take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to get to the surface.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://sunearthday.nasa.gov/2007/locations/ttt_sunlight.php |title= The 8-minute travel time to Earth by sunlight hides a thousand-year journey that actually began in the core |publisher= [[NASA]] |website= SunEarthDay.NASA.gov |access-date= 2012-02-12 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120122162340/http://sunearthday.nasa.gov/2007/locations/ttt_sunlight.php |archive-date= 2012-01-22 |df=  }}</ref>\n\nSunlight is a key factor in [[photosynthesis]], the process used by plants and other [[autotroph]]ic organisms to convert [[light energy]], normally from the Sun, into [[chemical energy]] that can be used to synthesize carbohydrates and to fuel the organisms' activities.\n\n==Measurement==\nResearchers can measure the intensity of sunlight using a [[sunshine recorder]], [[pyranometer]], or [[pyrheliometer]]. To calculate the amount of sunlight reaching the ground, both the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of Earth's [[elliptic orbit]] and the [[Extinction (astronomy)#Atmospheric extinction|attenuation]] by [[Earth's atmosphere]] have to be taken into account. The extraterrestrial solar illuminance ({{math|''E''<sub>ext</sub>}}), corrected for the elliptic orbit by using the day number of the year (dn), is given to a good approximation by<ref>{{cite journal|author=C. KANDILLI|author2=K. ULGEN|last-author-amp=yes|title=Solar Illumination and Estimating Daylight Availability of Global Solar Irradiance|journal=Energy Sources}}</ref>\n:<math>E_{\\rm ext}= E_{\\rm sc} \\cdot \\left(1+0.033412 \\cdot \\cos\\left(2\\pi\\frac{{\\rm dn}-3}{365}\\right)\\right),</math>\nwhere dn=1 on January&nbsp;1st; dn=32 on February&nbsp;1st; dn=59 on March 1 (except on leap years, where dn=60), etc. In this formula dn\u20133 is used, because in modern times [[Apsis#Earth's perihelion and aphelion|Earth's perihelion]], the closest approach to the Sun and, therefore, the maximum {{math|''E''<sub>ext</sub>}} occurs around January&nbsp;3 each year. The value of 0.033412 is determined knowing that the ratio between the perihelion (0.98328989&nbsp;AU) squared and the aphelion (1.01671033&nbsp;AU) squared should be approximately 0.935338.\n\nThe solar illuminance constant ({{math|''E''<sub>sc</sub>}}), is equal to 128\u00d710<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;[[lux]].

When the direct radiation is not blocked by clouds, it is experienced as ''sunshine''. The warming of the ground (and other objects) depends on the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption of the electromagnetic radiation]] in the form of [[heat]].\n\nThe amount of radiation intercepted by a planetary body varies inversely with the square of the distance between the star and the planet. Earth's [[orbit]] and [[obliquity]] change with time (over thousands of years), sometimes forming a nearly perfect circle, and at other times stretching out to an [[orbital eccentricity]] of 5% (currently 1.67%). As the orbital eccentricity changes, the average distance from the Sun (the [[semimajor axis]] does not significantly vary, and so the total [[insolation]] over a year remains almost constant due to [[Kepler's second law]],\n:<math>\\tfrac{2A}{r^2}dt = d\\theta,</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> is the \"areal velocity\" invariant. That is, the integration over the orbital period (also invariant) is a constant.\n\n:<math>\\int_{0}^{T} \\tfrac{2A}{r^2}dt = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = \\mathrm{constant}.</math>\n\nIf we assume the solar radiation power&nbsp;{{mvar|P}} as a constant over time and the solar irradiation given by the [[inverse-square law]], we obtain also the average insolation as a constant.\n\nBut the [[seasonal]] and latitudinal distribution and intensity of solar radiation received at Earth's surface does vary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/insolation_graph.html |title=Graph of variation of seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation |publisher=Museum.state.il.us |date=2007-08-30 |access-date=2012-02-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112043906/http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/insolation_graph.html |archive-date=2012-01-12 |df= }}</ref> The [[effect of Sun angle on climate]] results in the change in solar energy in summer and winter.  For example, at [[latitude]]s of 65&nbsp;degrees, this can vary by more than 25% as a result of Earth's orbital variation. Because changes in winter and summer tend to offset, the change in the annual average insolation at any given location is near zero, but the redistribution of energy between summer and winter does strongly affect the intensity of seasonal cycles. Such changes associated with the redistribution of solar energy are considered a likely cause for the coming and going of recent [[ice age]]s (see: [[Milankovitch cycles]]).\n\n===Solar intensity variation===\n{{Further|Solar variation}}\nSpace-based observations of solar irradiance started in 1978. These measurements show that the solar constant is not constant. It varies on many time scales, including the 11-year sunspot solar cycle.<ref name=\"acrim\"/> When going further back in time, one has to rely on irradiance reconstructions, using sunspots for the past 400&nbsp;years or cosmogenic radionuclides for going back&nbsp;10,000 years.\nSuch reconstructions have been done.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Modeling the Sun's Magnetic Field and Irradiance since 1713 | last1 = Wang | display-authors = etal   | date = 2005 | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 625 | issue = 1| pages = 522\u2013538 | doi = 10.1086/429689 | bibcode=2005ApJ...625..522W}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Total solar irradiance since 1996: is there a long-term variation unrelated to solar surface magnetic phenomena? | last1 = Steinhilber | display-authors = etal   | date = 2009 | url =https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/eawag/islandora/object/eawag%3A6539/datastream/PDF/view | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 36 | issue = | page = L19704 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/200811446 | bibcode=2010A&A...523A..39S| doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Evolution of the solar irradiance during the Holocene | last1 = Vieira | display-authors = etal   | date = 2011 | url = | journal = Astronomy & Astrophysics | volume = 531 | issue = | page = A6 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201015843 | bibcode=2011A&A...531A...6V|arxiv = 1103.4958 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = 9,400 years of cosmic radiation and solar activity from ice cores and tree rings | last1 = Steinhilber | display-authors = etal   | date = 2012 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109| issue = 16| pages = 5967\u20135971| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1118965109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.5967S | pmid=22474348 | pmc=3341045| url = http://epic.awi.de/30297/1/PNAS-2012-Steinhilber-1118965109.pdf}}</ref> These studies show that in addition to the solar irradiance variation with the solar cycle (the (Schwabe) cycle), the solar activity varies with longer cycles, such as the proposed 88 year ([[Gleisberg cycle]]), 208 year ([[DeVries cycle]]) and 1,000 year ([[Eddy cycle]]).\n\n==Life on Earth==\nThe existence of nearly all [[Organism|life on Earth]] is fueled by light from the Sun. Most [[autotroph]]s, such as plants, use the energy of sunlight, combined with carbon dioxide and water, to produce simple sugars\u2014a process known as [[photosynthesis]]. These sugars are then used as building-blocks and in other synthetic pathways that allow the organism to grow.\n\n[[Heterotroph]]s, such as animals, use light from the Sun indirectly by consuming the products of autotrophs, either by consuming autotrophs, by consuming their products, or by consuming other heterotrophs. The sugars and other molecular components produced by the autotrophs are then broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the heterotroph the energy required for survival. This process is known as [[cellular respiration]].\n\nIn [[prehistory]], humans began to further extend this process by putting plant and animal materials to other uses. They used animal skins for warmth, for example, or wooden weapons to hunt. These skills allowed humans to harvest more of the sunlight than was possible through glycolysis alone, and human population began to grow.\n\nDuring the [[Neolithic Revolution]], the domestication of plants and animals further increased human access to solar energy. Fields devoted to crops were enriched by inedible plant matter, providing sugars and [[nutrients]] for future harvests. Animals that had previously provided humans with only meat and tools once they were killed were now used for labour throughout their lives, fueled by [[grasses]] inedible to humans.\n\nThe more recent discoveries of [[coal]], [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] are modern extensions of this trend. These [[fossil fuel]]s are the remnants of ancient plant and animal matter, formed using energy from sunlight and then trapped within Earth for millions of years. Because the stored energy in these fossil fuels has accumulated over many millions of years, they have allowed modern humans to massively increase the production and consumption of [[primary energy]]. As the amount of fossil fuel is large but finite, this cannot continue indefinitely, and various theories exist as to what will follow this stage of human civilization (e.g., [[alternative fuels]], [[Malthusian catastrophe]], [[new urbanism]], [[peak oil]]).\n\n==Cultural aspects==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\n[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|[[Eduard Manet]]: ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (1862-63)]]\nThe effect of sunlight is relevant to [[painting]], evidenced for instance in works of [[Eduard Manet]] and [[Claude Monet]] on outdoor scenes and landscapes.\n[[File:Winter Sunshine.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|''T\u00e9li ver\u0151f\u00e9ny'' (\"Winter Sunshine\") by [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Medny\u00e1nszky]], early 20th century]]\nMany people find direct sunlight to be too [[brightness|bright]] for comfort, especially when reading from white paper upon which the sunlight is directly shining. Indeed, looking directly at the Sun can cause long-term vision damage. To compensate for the brightness of sunlight, many people wear [[sunglasses]]. [[Automobile|Cars]], many [[helmet]]s and [[cap]]s are equipped with [[visor]]s to block the Sun from direct vision when the Sun is at a low angle. Sunshine is often blocked from entering buildings through the use of [[wall]]s, [[window blind]]s, [[awning]]s, [[Window shutter|shutters]], [[curtain]]s, or nearby [[shade tree]]s. Sunshine exposure is needed biologically for the creation of [[Vitamin D]] in the skin, a vital compound needed to make strong bone and muscle in the body.\n\nIn colder countries, many people prefer sunnier days and often avoid the [[Shade (shadow)|shade]]. In hotter countries, the converse is true; during the midday hours, many people prefer to stay inside to remain cool. If they do go outside, they seek shade that may be provided by trees, [[Umbrella|parasols]], and so on.\n\nIn many world religions, such as [[Hinduism]], the Sun is considered to be a god, as it is the source of life and energy on Earth. It also formed the basis for religion in [[Ancient Egypt]].\n\n===Sunbathing===<!-- This section is linked from [[Naturism]] -->\n{{main|Sun tanning}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nSunbathing is a popular [[leisure]] activity in which a person sits or lies in direct sunshine. People often sunbathe in comfortable places where there is ample sunlight. Some common places for sunbathing include [[beach]]es, open air [[swimming pool]]s, [[park]]s, [[garden]]s, and [[sidewalk cafe]]s. Sunbathers typically wear limited amounts of clothing or some simply go [[Nudity|nude]]. For some, an alternative to sunbathing is the use of a [[Tanning bed|sunbed]] that generates [[ultraviolet]] light and can be used indoors regardless of weather conditions. Tanning beds have been banned in a number of states in the world.\n\nFor many people with light skin, one purpose for sunbathing is to darken one's [[Human skin color|skin color]] (get a sun tan), as this is considered in some cultures to be attractive, associated with outdoor activity, [[Vacation|vacations/holidays]], and health. Some people prefer [[Naturism|naked]] sunbathing so that an \"all-over\" or \"even\" tan can be obtained, sometimes as part of a specific lifestyle.\n\nControlled [[heliotherapy]], or sunbathing, has been used as a treatment for [[psoriasis]] and other maladies.\n\nSkin tanning is achieved by an increase in the dark pigment inside skin cells called [[melanocyte]]s, and is an automatic response mechanism of the body to sufficient exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun or from artificial sunlamps. Thus, the tan gradually disappears with time, when one is no longer exposed to these sources.\n\n==Effects on human health==\n{{main|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}\nThe [[ultraviolet radiation]] in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects, as it is both a principal source of [[vitamin D3|vitamin D<sub>3</sub>]] and a [[mutagen]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12174089 | volume=147 | issue=2 | title=Vitamin D and systemic cancer: is this relevant to malignant melanoma? |date=August 2002 | journal=Br.

The extraterrestrial solar illuminance ({{math|''E''<sub>ext</sub>}}), corrected for the elliptic orbit by using the day number of the year (dn), is given to a good approximation by<ref>{{cite journal|author=C.

When the direct radiation is not blocked by clouds, it is experienced as ''sunshine''. The warming of the ground (and other objects) depends on the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption of the electromagnetic radiation]] in the form of [[heat]].\n\nThe amount of radiation intercepted by a planetary body varies inversely with the square of the distance between the star and the planet. Earth's [[orbit]] and [[obliquity]] change with time (over thousands of years), sometimes forming a nearly perfect circle, and at other times stretching out to an [[orbital eccentricity]] of 5% (currently 1.67%). As the orbital eccentricity changes, the average distance from the Sun (the [[semimajor axis]] does not significantly vary, and so the total [[insolation]] over a year remains almost constant due to [[Kepler's second law]],\n:<math>\\tfrac{2A}{r^2}dt = d\\theta,</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> is the \"areal velocity\" invariant. That is, the integration over the orbital period (also invariant) is a constant.\n\n:<math>\\int_{0}^{T} \\tfrac{2A}{r^2}dt = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = \\mathrm{constant}.</math>\n\nIf we assume the solar radiation power&nbsp;{{mvar|P}} as a constant over time and the solar irradiation given by the [[inverse-square law]], we obtain also the average insolation as a constant.\n\nBut the [[seasonal]] and latitudinal distribution and intensity of solar radiation received at Earth's surface does vary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/insolation_graph.html |title=Graph of variation of seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation |publisher=Museum.state.il.us |date=2007-08-30 |access-date=2012-02-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112043906/http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/insolation_graph.html |archive-date=2012-01-12 |df= }}</ref> The [[effect of Sun angle on climate]] results in the change in solar energy in summer and winter.  For example, at [[latitude]]s of 65&nbsp;degrees, this can vary by more than 25% as a result of Earth's orbital variation. Because changes in winter and summer tend to offset, the change in the annual average insolation at any given location is near zero, but the redistribution of energy between summer and winter does strongly affect the intensity of seasonal cycles. Such changes associated with the redistribution of solar energy are considered a likely cause for the coming and going of recent [[ice age]]s (see: [[Milankovitch cycles]]).\n\n===Solar intensity variation===\n{{Further|Solar variation}}\nSpace-based observations of solar irradiance started in 1978. These measurements show that the solar constant is not constant. It varies on many time scales, including the 11-year sunspot solar cycle.<ref name=\"acrim\"/> When going further back in time, one has to rely on irradiance reconstructions, using sunspots for the past 400&nbsp;years or cosmogenic radionuclides for going back&nbsp;10,000 years.\nSuch reconstructions have been done.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Modeling the Sun's Magnetic Field and Irradiance since 1713 | last1 = Wang | display-authors = etal   | date = 2005 | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 625 | issue = 1| pages = 522\u2013538 | doi = 10.1086/429689 | bibcode=2005ApJ...625..522W}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Total solar irradiance since 1996: is there a long-term variation unrelated to solar surface magnetic phenomena? | last1 = Steinhilber | display-authors = etal   | date = 2009 | url =https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/eawag/islandora/object/eawag%3A6539/datastream/PDF/view | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 36 | issue = | page = L19704 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/200811446 | bibcode=2010A&A...523A..39S| doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Evolution of the solar irradiance during the Holocene | last1 = Vieira | display-authors = etal   | date = 2011 | url = | journal = Astronomy & Astrophysics | volume = 531 | issue = | page = A6 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201015843 | bibcode=2011A&A...531A...6V|arxiv = 1103.4958 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = 9,400 years of cosmic radiation and solar activity from ice cores and tree rings | last1 = Steinhilber | display-authors = etal   | date = 2012 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109| issue = 16| pages = 5967\u20135971| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1118965109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.5967S | pmid=22474348 | pmc=3341045| url = http://epic.awi.de/30297/1/PNAS-2012-Steinhilber-1118965109.pdf}}</ref> These studies show that in addition to the solar irradiance variation with the solar cycle (the (Schwabe) cycle), the solar activity varies with longer cycles, such as the proposed 88 year ([[Gleisberg cycle]]), 208 year ([[DeVries cycle]]) and 1,000 year ([[Eddy cycle]]).\n\n==Life on Earth==\nThe existence of nearly all [[Organism|life on Earth]] is fueled by light from the Sun. Most [[autotroph]]s, such as plants, use the energy of sunlight, combined with carbon dioxide and water, to produce simple sugars\u2014a process known as [[photosynthesis]]. These sugars are then used as building-blocks and in other synthetic pathways that allow the organism to grow.\n\n[[Heterotroph]]s, such as animals, use light from the Sun indirectly by consuming the products of autotrophs, either by consuming autotrophs, by consuming their products, or by consuming other heterotrophs. The sugars and other molecular components produced by the autotrophs are then broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the heterotroph the energy required for survival. This process is known as [[cellular respiration]].\n\nIn [[prehistory]], humans began to further extend this process by putting plant and animal materials to other uses. They used animal skins for warmth, for example, or wooden weapons to hunt. These skills allowed humans to harvest more of the sunlight than was possible through glycolysis alone, and human population began to grow.\n\nDuring the [[Neolithic Revolution]], the domestication of plants and animals further increased human access to solar energy. Fields devoted to crops were enriched by inedible plant matter, providing sugars and [[nutrients]] for future harvests. Animals that had previously provided humans with only meat and tools once they were killed were now used for labour throughout their lives, fueled by [[grasses]] inedible to humans.\n\nThe more recent discoveries of [[coal]], [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] are modern extensions of this trend. These [[fossil fuel]]s are the remnants of ancient plant and animal matter, formed using energy from sunlight and then trapped within Earth for millions of years. Because the stored energy in these fossil fuels has accumulated over many millions of years, they have allowed modern humans to massively increase the production and consumption of [[primary energy]]. As the amount of fossil fuel is large but finite, this cannot continue indefinitely, and various theories exist as to what will follow this stage of human civilization (e.g., [[alternative fuels]], [[Malthusian catastrophe]], [[new urbanism]], [[peak oil]]).\n\n==Cultural aspects==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\n[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|[[Eduard Manet]]: ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (1862-63)]]\nThe effect of sunlight is relevant to [[painting]], evidenced for instance in works of [[Eduard Manet]] and [[Claude Monet]] on outdoor scenes and landscapes.\n[[File:Winter Sunshine.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|''T\u00e9li ver\u0151f\u00e9ny'' (\"Winter Sunshine\") by [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Medny\u00e1nszky]], early 20th century]]\nMany people find direct sunlight to be too [[brightness|bright]] for comfort, especially when reading from white paper upon which the sunlight is directly shining. Indeed, looking directly at the Sun can cause long-term vision damage. To compensate for the brightness of sunlight, many people wear [[sunglasses]]. [[Automobile|Cars]], many [[helmet]]s and [[cap]]s are equipped with [[visor]]s to block the Sun from direct vision when the Sun is at a low angle. Sunshine is often blocked from entering buildings through the use of [[wall]]s, [[window blind]]s, [[awning]]s, [[Window shutter|shutters]], [[curtain]]s, or nearby [[shade tree]]s. Sunshine exposure is needed biologically for the creation of [[Vitamin D]] in the skin, a vital compound needed to make strong bone and muscle in the body.\n\nIn colder countries, many people prefer sunnier days and often avoid the [[Shade (shadow)|shade]]. In hotter countries, the converse is true; during the midday hours, many people prefer to stay inside to remain cool. If they do go outside, they seek shade that may be provided by trees, [[Umbrella|parasols]], and so on.\n\nIn many world religions, such as [[Hinduism]], the Sun is considered to be a god, as it is the source of life and energy on Earth. It also formed the basis for religion in [[Ancient Egypt]].\n\n===Sunbathing===<!-- This section is linked from [[Naturism]] -->\n{{main|Sun tanning}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nSunbathing is a popular [[leisure]] activity in which a person sits or lies in direct sunshine. People often sunbathe in comfortable places where there is ample sunlight. Some common places for sunbathing include [[beach]]es, open air [[swimming pool]]s, [[park]]s, [[garden]]s, and [[sidewalk cafe]]s. Sunbathers typically wear limited amounts of clothing or some simply go [[Nudity|nude]]. For some, an alternative to sunbathing is the use of a [[Tanning bed|sunbed]] that generates [[ultraviolet]] light and can be used indoors regardless of weather conditions. Tanning beds have been banned in a number of states in the world.\n\nFor many people with light skin, one purpose for sunbathing is to darken one's [[Human skin color|skin color]] (get a sun tan), as this is considered in some cultures to be attractive, associated with outdoor activity, [[Vacation|vacations/holidays]], and health. Some people prefer [[Naturism|naked]] sunbathing so that an \"all-over\" or \"even\" tan can be obtained, sometimes as part of a specific lifestyle.\n\nControlled [[heliotherapy]], or sunbathing, has been used as a treatment for [[psoriasis]] and other maladies.\n\nSkin tanning is achieved by an increase in the dark pigment inside skin cells called [[melanocyte]]s, and is an automatic response mechanism of the body to sufficient exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun or from artificial sunlamps. Thus, the tan gradually disappears with time, when one is no longer exposed to these sources.\n\n==Effects on human health==\n{{main|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}\nThe [[ultraviolet radiation]] in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects, as it is both a principal source of [[vitamin D3|vitamin D<sub>3</sub>]] and a [[mutagen]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12174089 | volume=147 | issue=2 | title=Vitamin D and systemic cancer: is this relevant to malignant melanoma? |date=August 2002 | journal=Br.

It is part to the [[Kampinmalmi]] district and [[L\u00e4nsisatama neighbourhood]]. It was the location of the main container harbour in Helsinki until late 2008, when the harbour moved to the [[Vuosaari harbour|new facilities]] in [[Vuosaari]]. The terminal for passenger ferries to Tallinn, Estonia, remains in [[West Harbour, Helsinki|L\u00e4nsisatama]] (literally ''West Harbour'' in Finnish).\n\nWhat is now known as J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari (literally ''Docker Island'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]), was originally a group of three islands: J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari, Hietasaari, and Saukko. The sea between the islands and the continent was filled, creating a peninsula to house harbour facilities. The area became an island once more with the construction of the [[Ruoholahti]] Canal. With most of the harbour operations having moved to the new [[Vuosaari Harbour]], the construction of a new mixed-use city district began in late 2009, after a clean-up of contaminated soil was completed.\n\n[[Image:Celebrity Eclipse at J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari.JPG|thumb|left|A construction site in J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari.

It is part to the [[Kampinmalmi]] district and [[L\u00e4nsisatama neighbourhood]]. It was the location of the main container harbour in Helsinki until late 2008, when the harbour moved to the [[Vuosaari harbour|new facilities]] in [[Vuosaari]]. The terminal for passenger ferries to Tallinn, Estonia, remains in [[West Harbour, Helsinki|L\u00e4nsisatama]] (literally ''West Harbour'' in Finnish).\n\nWhat is now known as J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari (literally ''Docker Island'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]), was originally a group of three islands: J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari, Hietasaari, and Saukko. The sea between the islands and the continent was filled, creating a peninsula to house harbour facilities. The area became an island once more with the construction of the [[Ruoholahti]] Canal. With most of the harbour operations having moved to the new [[Vuosaari Harbour]], the construction of a new mixed-use city district began in late 2009, after a clean-up of contaminated soil was completed.\n\n[[Image:Celebrity Eclipse at J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari.JPG|thumb|left|A construction site in J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari.

The area will have several schools, kindergartens, sports facilities and public services.
