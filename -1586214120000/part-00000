Originally, the dam was a mere four feet high, which was raised to sixteen feet in 1907. The dam was the main source of water and electricity for the town of [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]] until 1923.<ref name=\"Winchester Dam\">{{cite web|title=Fish Counts: Winchester Dam|url=http://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/fish_counts/winchester_dam.asp|publisher=Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife|accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref> The dam's hydropower facilities have long since been removed, and the structure is now maintained solely for the recreational benefit of the Winchester Water Control District, composed of the private landowners surrounding the reservoir pool.<ref>https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/ec88eb6d-93ef-4c39-ac23-5eaaa374142f</ref>\n\n== Public Safety ==\nThe dam is officially categorized as \u201chigh hazard\u201d by the Oregon Department of Water Resources[https://apps.wrd.state.or.us/apps/misc/dam_inventory/], primarily due to likely loss of life in the case of dam failure among the people who frequent the river, parks, and boat ramps just downstream.[http://waterwatch.org/owrd_memo_to_gov_atiyeh_11-29-86_clean/] Following an annual inspection in October 2019, state officials downgraded Winchester Dam\u2019s condition to \u201cpoor,\u201d requested that the owners hire an engineer to comprehensively inspect its structure, and warned the owners to address known dam safety issues soon. According to the 2019 inspection report, Winchester Dam has not received a comprehensive structural inspection, nor have the owners updated the dam's required emergency action plan, since 1987.[https://waterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Winchester__letter_from_2019.pdf] \n\n== Drinking Water Impacts ==\nIn January 2020, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality levied a $58,378 fine for violations during a repair at Winchester Dam in late 2018. According to DEQ, pollution from this repair degraded aquatic habitat, killed numerous fish, and harmed the primary drinking water source for the [[Roseburg, Oregon|City of Roseburg]] and the Umpqua Basin Water Association \u2013 serving approximately 37,700 people combined. Officials found that dam repairs were conducted without following established best management practices, even after state and federal agencies provided information in advance on how to protect water quality and fish.[http://waterwatch.org/basco-logging-inc_wq-np-wr-2019-231_cpissued/] \n\n== Harm to Fish ==\nIn 1994, conservation group Oregon Natural Resources Council released a report titled \"Damnable Dams\" which called for the removal of a number of Pacific Northwest dams, including Winchester Dam, because of the harm these structures caused to salmon and other fish.<ref>http://www.hcn.org/issues/3/88</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/573a143a746fb9ea3f1376e5/t/5c912360f9619afdf7ae783e/1553015722460/15DamnableDamsOCRVLQ.pdf|title=15 Damnable Dams|last=Oregon Natural Resources Council|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 6, 2020}}</ref> Since then, other dams on the \"Damnable Dams\" list have come down, including Savage Rapids<ref>http://waterwatch.org/programs/savage-rapids-dam-removal</ref>, Elk Creek<ref>http://www.oregonwild.org/waters/rivers-and-dams/elk-creek-dam/timeline</ref>, and Gold Ray<ref>http://waterwatch.org/gold-ray-dam-comes-down</ref> dams in southern Oregon. However, Winchester Dam has remained. \n\nIn 2013, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife placed Winchester Dam on the Statewide Fish Passage Priority List, an official listing of Oregon's top artificial obstructions to native migratory fish.<ref>http://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/passage/docs/2013_Statewide_Prioritization_List.pdf</ref> In 2019, Winchester Dam was raised to the second highest ranked privately-owned dam on the Statewide Fish Passage Priority List, where it is noted for impeding passage to 160 miles of high quality habitat for spring Chinook, fall Chinook, summer steelhead, winter steelhead, cutthroat trout, and Pacific Lamprey, as well as Southern Oregon Coast Coho which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. \n\nOregon Department of Fish and Wildlife staff maintain and operate the Winchester Dam\u2019s fish ladder through an easement providing access, but lack a substantive written system or analysis for maximizing fish passage efficiency at different flows.

Originally, the dam was a mere four feet high, which was raised to sixteen feet in 1907. The dam was the main source of water and electricity for the town of [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]] until 1923.<ref name=\"Winchester Dam\">{{cite web|title=Fish Counts: Winchester Dam|url=http://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/fish_counts/winchester_dam.asp|publisher=Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife|accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref> The dam's hydropower facilities have long since been removed, and the structure is now maintained solely for the recreational benefit of the Winchester Water Control District, composed of the private landowners surrounding the reservoir pool.<ref>https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/ec88eb6d-93ef-4c39-ac23-5eaaa374142f</ref>\n\n== Public Safety ==\nThe dam is officially categorized as \u201chigh hazard\u201d by the Oregon Department of Water Resources[https://apps.wrd.state.or.us/apps/misc/dam_inventory/], primarily due to likely loss of life in the case of dam failure among the people who frequent the river, parks, and boat ramps just downstream.[http://waterwatch.org/owrd_memo_to_gov_atiyeh_11-29-86_clean/] Following an annual inspection in October 2019, state officials downgraded Winchester Dam\u2019s condition to \u201cpoor,\u201d requested that the owners hire an engineer to comprehensively inspect its structure, and warned the owners to address known dam safety issues soon. According to the 2019 inspection report, Winchester Dam has not received a comprehensive structural inspection, nor have the owners updated the dam's required emergency action plan, since 1987.[https://waterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Winchester__letter_from_2019.pdf] \n\n== Drinking Water Impacts ==\nIn January 2020, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality levied a $58,378 fine for violations during a repair at Winchester Dam in late 2018. According to DEQ, pollution from this repair degraded aquatic habitat, killed numerous fish, and harmed the primary drinking water source for the City of Roseburg and the Umpqua Basin Water Association \u2013 serving approximately 37,700 people combined. Officials found that dam repairs were conducted without following established best management practices, even after state and federal agencies provided information in advance on how to protect water quality and fish.[http://waterwatch.org/basco-logging-inc_wq-np-wr-2019-231_cpissued/] \n\n== Harm to Fish ==\nIn 1994, conservation group Oregon Natural Resources Council released a report titled \"Damnable Dams\" which called for the removal of a number of Pacific Northwest dams, including Winchester Dam, because of the harm these structures caused to salmon and other fish.<ref>http://www.hcn.org/issues/3/88</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/573a143a746fb9ea3f1376e5/t/5c912360f9619afdf7ae783e/1553015722460/15DamnableDamsOCRVLQ.pdf|title=15 Damnable Dams|last=Oregon Natural Resources Council|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 6, 2020}}</ref> Since then, other dams on the \"Damnable Dams\" list have come down, including Savage Rapids<ref>http://waterwatch.org/programs/savage-rapids-dam-removal</ref>, Elk Creek<ref>http://www.oregonwild.org/waters/rivers-and-dams/elk-creek-dam/timeline</ref>, and Gold Ray<ref>http://waterwatch.org/gold-ray-dam-comes-down</ref> dams in southern Oregon. However, Winchester Dam has remained. \n\nIn 2013, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife placed Winchester Dam on the Statewide Fish Passage Priority List, an official listing of Oregon's top artificial obstructions to native migratory fish.<ref>http://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/passage/docs/2013_Statewide_Prioritization_List.pdf</ref> In 2019, Winchester Dam was raised to the second highest ranked privately-owned dam on the Statewide Fish Passage Priority List, where it is noted for impeding passage to 160 miles of high quality habitat for spring Chinook, fall Chinook, summer steelhead, winter steelhead, cutthroat trout, and Pacific Lamprey, as well as Southern Oregon Coast Coho which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. \n\nOregon Department of Fish and Wildlife staff maintain and operate the Winchester Dam\u2019s fish ladder through an easement providing access, but lack a substantive written system or analysis for maximizing fish passage efficiency at different flows. Winchester\u2019s ladder has a number of right angle turns and the ability to control flow velocities in the ladder is limited, making it difficult to pass fish at a wide range of flows.

expanding in volume to propel the xenobot forward.\nThe shape of a xenobot's body, and its distribution of skin and heart cells, are automatically designed in simulation to perform a specific task, using a process of trial and error (an [[Evolutionary algorithm|evolutionary algorithm]]).\nXenobots have been designed to walk, swim, push pellets, carry payloads, and work together in a swarm to aggregate debris scattered along the surface of their dish into neat piles.\nThey can survive for weeks without food and heal themselves after lacerations.<ref name=PNAS />\n\n== Potential Applications ==\n\nCurrently, xenobots are primarily used as a scientific tool to understand how cells cooperate to build complex bodies during [[morphogenesis]].<ref name=Wired />\nHowever, the behavior and [[biocompatibility]] of current xenobots suggest several potential applications to which they may be put in the future.\n\nGiven that xenobots composed of solely of frog cells, they are biodegradable.\nAnd as swarms of xenobots tend to work together to push microscopic pellets in their dish into central piles,<ref name=PNAS />\nit has been speculated that future xenobots might be able do the same thing with [[microplastics]] in the ocean: \nfind and aggregate tiny bits of plastic into a large ball of plastic that a traditional boat or drone can gather and bring to a recycling center.\nUnlike traditional technologies, xenobots do not add additional pollution as they work and degrade: \nthey behave using energy from fat and protein naturally stored in their tissue, which
