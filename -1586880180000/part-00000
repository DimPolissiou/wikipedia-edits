Meetings were still small, and Hans' close relationship with his students continued. In 1963, the first of many large public programs was held in the Ram Lila grounds in New Delhi, reportedly attended by 15,000. In 1964, an event took place on [[Gandhi Maidan]] in the heart of old Delhi that attracted even larger crowds. Several ashrams were opened during that time, including a small one in Rajasthan and another larger one called ''Satlok'' (\"Place of Truth\") located between Delhi and Haridwar.<ref name=HJY />\n\nIn 1965, Hans attended a religious conference in New Delhi's Constitution Club that was chaired by the then Speaker of the India Parliament, Mr. Ayengar.

In May 1974, Maharaj Ji married an American girl, Marolyn Johnson (now called Durga Ji), in direct defiance of his mother's wishes and the event shook the mission to its foundations. This marriage brought about an exodus from the ashrams, the stable core of the mission which had been a vital means of social control, as premies flocked to get married and began to produce their own children, within customary marriage structures. It was an important turning point for the mission. The followers seemed to grow up overnight into adults with normal family responsibilities and ties. The base of support inevitably shifted from the ashrams to the wider premie community. This meant that central control was very much weakened and that the ordinary, non-ashram premie began to play a more important role in determining the mission's fortunes. At the same time, many premies were shaken by the marriage and felt almost betrayed by their leader. It is apparent that the marriage was responsible for a loss of morale and therefore of support for the mission by many premies. \"</ref><ref>Richardson, James T., in ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society'', William H.

Meetings were still small, and Hans' close relationship with his students continued. In 1963, the first of many large public programs was held in the Ram Lila grounds in New Delhi, reportedly attended by 15,000. In 1964, an event took place on [[Gandhi Maidan]] in the heart of old Delhi that attracted even larger crowds. Several ashrams were opened during that time, including a small one in Rajasthan and another larger one called ''Satlok'' (\"Place of Truth\") located between Delhi and Haridwar.<ref name=HJY />\n\nIn 1965, Hans attended a religious conference in New Delhi's Constitution Club that was chaired by the then Speaker of the India Parliament, Mr. Ayengar.

In May 1974, Maharaj Ji married an American girl, Marolyn Johnson (now called Durga Ji), in direct defiance of his mother's wishes and the event shook the mission to its foundations. This marriage brought about an exodus from the ashrams, the stable core of the mission which had been a vital means of social control, as premies flocked to get married and began to produce their own children, within customary marriage structures. It was an important turning point for the mission. The followers seemed to grow up overnight into adults with normal family responsibilities and ties. The base of support inevitably shifted from the ashrams to the wider premie community. This meant that central control was very much weakened and that the ordinary, non-ashram premie began to play a more important role in determining the mission's fortunes. At the same time, many premies were shaken by the marriage and felt almost betrayed by their leader. It is apparent that the marriage was responsible for a loss of morale and therefore of support for the mission by many premies. \"</ref><ref>Richardson, James T., in ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society'', William H.

The series stars [[Ross Lynch]], [[Laura Marano]], [[Raini Rodriguez]], and [[Calum Worthy]].\n\n== Plot ==\nSet in [[Miami]], ''Austin & Ally'' is about the relationship between two very different musicians: extroverted and fun-loving singer and instrumentalist Austin Moon, and introverted and awkward songwriter Ally Dawson, who is also a singer, but has a bad case of stage fright.\n\nIn \"[[List of Austin & Ally episodes#ep1|Rockers & Writers]]\", Austin overhears Ally singing a song she's written.  Later, he changes the tempo of the song and sings it himself, although he's completely forgotten it's the same song he heard Ally singing.  He becomes famous from it after his best friend, Dez, directs Austin in a music video for the song and posts it on the Internet, making Austin an overnight sensation. Once Ally takes credit for her song, she and Austin work together on a second song.  At the end of the episode, Austin convinces her to become his partner, and the two agree to work together and eventually become close friends. Ally's best friend, Trish, pitches in as Austin's manager and Dez continues to direct Austin's music videos. At the end of the first season, Austin gets signed to Jimmy Starr's record label.\n\nThe second season sees both Austin and Ally taking bigger steps. Ally conquers her stage fright by performing a duet with Austin. By the end of the second season, Ally signs a record deal and records an album with Ronnie Ramone, while Austin goes on his first national tour. Due to her schedule with Ronnie Ramone, Ally is unable to attend the first half of Austin's tour, but in the first two episodes of the third season, Ally does attend the second half of the tour.\n\nIn the third season, Ally's career takes off. Later, Ally is making her first album. By the end of the third season, Austin sacrifices his music career when his record label forbids him from being together with Ally. Austin chooses to be with Ally as they confess their love for each other. In the end, Austin goes with Ally on her first tour, Trish starts her own management company, and Dez goes to film school in Los Angeles.\n\nIn the fourth season, the group reunites after the tour and turns Sonic Boom into a music school called A&A Music Factory, where they help students pursue their musical dreams. They combine their talents to become business partners, and the store's success explodes.\n\nThe series has been described as a \"pint-sized\" version of [[HBO]]'s [[comedy-drama]] ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2010/tv/news/teens-go-showbiz-for-disney-channel-1118028677/|title=Teens Go Showbiz for Disney Channel|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|author=Michael Schneider|date=December 8, 2010|access-date=February 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Austin & Ally episodes}}\n{{:List of Austin & Ally episodes}}\n\n=== ''Jessie'' crossover ===\nIn November 2012, Disney Channel announced that the series would crossover with ''[[Jessie (2011 TV series)|Jessie]]'' as an hour-long special episode titled \"[[Austin & Jessie & Ally All Star New Year]]\". The special aired on December 7, 2012, in which Austin finally gets to perform in Times Square on New Year's Eve like he has always dreamed of, with help from Jessie and the Ross children. Later, Jessie and the children travel to Miami with the group. Jessie inadvertently steals lyrics that were written by Zuri and tries to get Austin to sing them with her. Meanwhile, Ravi is jealous to see that the family's pet lizard, Mrs. Kipling, may have a crush on Dez, though it turns out that Mrs. Kipling does not like Dez at all.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n<imagemap>\nFile:AustinandAllyCast.jpg|right|thumb|The main characters, from left to right: Trish, Austin Moon, Ally Dawson, and Dez.\n\nrect 31 31 82 188 [[#Trish|Trish]]\nrect 87 7 129 188 [[#Austin Moon|Austin]]\nrect 131 19 165 188 [[#Ally Dawson|Ally]]\nrect 170 1 212 188 [[#Dez|Dez]]\n\ndesc none\n</imagemap>\n\n* [[Ross Lynch]] as {{visible anchor|Austin Moon}}, an outgoing, confident, and talented singer. After becoming an overnight Internet sensation by performing a song he overheard Ally singing, Ally tracks him down to confront him for theft, but they eventually become friends instead and decide to form a musical partnership. His partnership with Ally is initially built on the idea that \"he rocks; she writes\". Ally is a brilliant songwriter, but is too timid to perform her own music, while Austin loves to perform, but is unable to write songs for himself. Their radically different personalities tend to clash early on, though they find they're much more alike than they think as their friendship develops, leading to an on-again, off-again romance starting in the second season. In the third season, they begin to date again and are found in a healthy, secure relationship throughout the fourth season. Austin's best friend is Dez, who directs and films all of his music videos, and his manager is Trish.

He and Penny, Ally's mother, are divorced.\n* Richard Whiten as Jimmy Starr, the owner of Starr Records who signs Austin to his record label.\n* Aubrey Miller as Megan Simms, a 10-year-old reporter and photographer for Cheetah Beat Magazine.

The series stars [[Ross Lynch]], [[Laura Marano]], [[Raini Rodriguez]], and [[Calum Worthy]].\n\n== Plot ==\nSet in [[Miami]], ''Austin & Ally'' is about the relationship between two very different musicians: extroverted and fun-loving singer and instrumentalist Austin Moon, and introverted and awkward songwriter Ally Dawson, who is also a singer, but has a bad case of stage fright.\n\nIn \"[[List of Austin & Ally episodes#ep1|Rockers & Writers]]\", Austin overhears Ally singing a song she's written.  Later, he changes the tempo of the song and sings it himself, although he's completely forgotten it's the same song he heard Ally singing.  He becomes famous from it after his best friend, Dez, directs Austin in a music video for the song and posts it on the Internet, making Austin an overnight sensation. Once Ally takes credit for her song, she and Austin work together on a second song.  At the end of the episode, Austin convinces her to become his partner, and the two agree to work together and eventually become close friends. Ally's best friend, Trish, pitches in as Austin's manager and Dez continues to direct Austin's music videos. At the end of the first season, Austin gets signed to Jimmy Starr's record label.\n\nThe second season sees both Austin and Ally taking bigger steps. Ally conquers her stage fright by performing a duet with Austin. By the end of the second season, Ally signs a record deal and records an album with Ronnie Ramone, while Austin goes on his first national tour. Due to her schedule with Ronnie Ramone, Ally is unable to attend the first half of Austin's tour, but in the first two episodes of the third season, Ally does attend the second half of the tour.\n\nIn the third season, Ally's career takes off. Later, Ally is making her first album. By the end of the third season, Austin sacrifices his music career when his record label forbids him from being together with Ally. Austin chooses to be with Ally as they confess their love for each other. In the end, Austin goes with Ally on her first tour, Trish starts her own management company, and Dez goes to film school in Los Angeles.\n\nIn the fourth season, the group reunites after the tour and turns Sonic Boom into a music school called A&A Music Factory, where they help students pursue their musical dreams. They combine their talents to become business partners, and the store's success explodes.\n\nThe series has been described as a \"pint-sized\" version of [[HBO]]'s [[comedy-drama]] ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2010/tv/news/teens-go-showbiz-for-disney-channel-1118028677/|title=Teens Go Showbiz for Disney Channel|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|author=Michael Schneider|date=December 8, 2010|access-date=February 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Austin & Ally episodes}}\n{{:List of Austin & Ally episodes}}\n\n=== ''Jessie'' crossover ===\nIn November 2012, Disney Channel announced that the series would crossover with ''[[Jessie (2011 TV series)|Jessie]]'' as an hour-long special episode titled \"[[Austin & Jessie & Ally All Star New Year]]\". The special aired on December 7, 2012, in which Austin finally gets to perform in Times Square on New Year's Eve like he has always dreamed of, with help from Jessie and the Ross children. Later, Jessie and the children travel to Miami with the group. Jessie inadvertently steals lyrics that were written by Zuri and tries to get Austin to sing them with her. Meanwhile, Ravi is jealous to see that the family's pet lizard, Mrs. Kipling, may have a crush on Dez, though it turns out that Mrs. Kipling does not like Dez at all.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n<imagemap>\nFile:AustinandAllyCast.jpg|right|thumb|The main characters, from left to right: Trish, Austin Moon, Ally Dawson, and Dez.\n\nrect 31 31 82 188 [[#Trish|Trish]]\nrect 87 7 129 188 [[#Austin Moon|Austin]]\nrect 131 19 165 188 [[#Ally Dawson|Ally]]\nrect 170 1 212 188 [[#Dez|Dez]]\n\ndesc none\n</imagemap>\n\n* [[Ross Lynch]] as {{visible anchor|Austin Moon}}, an outgoing, confident, and talented singer. After becoming an overnight Internet sensation by performing a song he overheard Ally singing, Ally tracks him down to confront him for theft, but they eventually become friends instead and decide to form a musical partnership. His partnership with Ally is initially built on the idea that \"he rocks; she writes\". Ally is a brilliant songwriter, but is too timid to perform her own music, while Austin loves to perform, but is unable to write songs for himself. Their radically different personalities tend to clash early on, though they find they're much more alike than they think as their friendship develops, leading to an on-again, off-again romance starting in the second season. In the third season, they begin to date again and are found in a healthy, secure relationship throughout the fourth season. Austin's best friend is Dez, who directs and films all of his music videos, and his manager is Trish.

In the series finale, it is revealed that Austin is married to Ally and they have two children named Alex and Ava.\n* [[Laura Marano]] as {{visible anchor|Ally Dawson}}, a smart girl and a singer-songwriter with severe stage fright and a quiet, shy personality.

She is sarcastic, snarky, lazy, vindictive, has little patience, and has a bit of a temper, but cares very much for her friends.

Incumbent Democratic Senator [[Bill Nelson]] ran for re-election to a fourth term, but was very narrowly defeated by Republican Governor [[Rick Scott]], in one of the closest statewide elections in the state's history.\n\nThe results of the race were in dispute for 12 days following the election. The results showed that Nelson was narrowly trailing Scott, but the margin remained below 0.5%, triggering an [[Election recount|automatic recount]] under Florida law. A controversial recount ensued, with both campaigns claiming irregularities. Following the recount, Florida elections officials confirmed Scott's victory on November 18, 2018. Scott received 50.05% of the vote, while Nelson received 49.93%; the margin of victory was 10,033 votes out of 8.19 million votes cast. Both in terms of raw vote margin and by percentage of difference, this was the closest [[2018 United States Senate elections|Senate]] election in the [[2018 United States elections|2018 cycle]].

Incumbent Democratic Senator [[Bill Nelson]] ran for re-election to a fourth term, but was very narrowly defeated by Republican Governor [[Rick Scott]], in one of the closest statewide elections in the state's history.\n\nThe results of the race were in dispute for 12 days following the election. The results showed that Nelson was narrowly trailing Scott, but the margin remained below 0.5%, triggering an [[Election recount|automatic recount]] under Florida law. A controversial recount ensued, with both campaigns claiming irregularities. Following the recount, Florida elections officials confirmed Scott's victory on November 18, 2018. Scott received 50.05% of the vote, while Nelson received 49.93%; the margin of victory was 10,033 votes out of 8.19 million votes cast. Both in terms of raw vote margin and by percentage of difference, this was the closest [[2018 United States Senate elections|Senate]] election in the [[2018 United States elections|2018 cycle]].
