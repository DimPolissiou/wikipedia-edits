They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, [[Shankarananda_(Ramakrishna_monk)|Swami Shankarananda]] and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992),p.48</ref> [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009),p.20</ref> [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]].\n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction [[sannyasa]] for women.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, ''Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions'' (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref> But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]].<ref>''Udbodhan'' (Phalgun issue B.S.1379)</ref> Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion.\n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission's main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two institutions run by the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] for women, the [[Matri Bhavan]] (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Entally Ashrama, Women's Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]] in 1961.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the [[Sister Nivedita Girls' School]]<ref>http://www.sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory.html</ref> to the [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]].<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity.

[[Swami Vivekananda]] realized the dire necessity of women's Math which he expressed through his letters from 1894 to 1901.\n\n\u201cThere is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved\u2026 Hence it is that my first endeavor is to start a Math for women.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.201 \n</ref>\n\n\"Mother (Sri Sarada Devi) has been born to revive...[[Shakti]] in India; and making her the nucleus, once more will [[Gargi Vachaknavi|Gargis]] and [[Maitreyi]]s be born into the world...

He has witnessed some outstanding women of renunciation among the women disciples of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] such as [[Gauri Ma]], [[Yogin Ma]], and [[Golap Ma]]. He wanted them to spread the message of Sri Ramakrishna through an organisation.<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.112</ref>\n\nIncidently, [[Sri Sarada Devi]] too, cherished the dream to start a monastery for women. This came to light from the letters of [[Swami Saradananda]] written to [[Sara Bull]], '[[Sister Nivedita]] and myself have found out by talking to Mother that she would like to see a convent started in the fashion of the Math, Belur, for women. Miss Glen who was here to visit the Holy Mother... also had a talk with Mother about it, and is very sanguine about the work.'<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.126</ref>\n\n== Activities ==\n6 November 1981, the stone temple was consecrated as per the Hindu tradition.

[[Swami Vivekananda]] realized the dire necessity of women's Math which he expressed through his letters from 1894 to 1901.\n\n\u201cThere is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved\u2026 Hence it is that my first endeavor is to start a Math for women.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.201 \n</ref>\n\n\"Mother (Sri Sarada Devi) has been born to revive...[[Shakti]] in India; and making her the nucleus, once more will [[Gargi Vachaknavi|Gargis]] and [[Maitreyi]]s be born into the world... Hence it is her Math that I want first... Without the grace of [[Shakti]] nothing is to be accomplished.... Hence we must first build a Math for Mother.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.181</ref>\n\n\u201cBrother, in this terrible winter I am lecturing from place to place and fighting against odds, so that funds may be collected for Mother\u2019s Math.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.181</ref>\n\n\u201cWith the Holy Mother (Sri Sarada Devi) as the centre of inspiration, a Math is to be established on the eastern bank of the [[Ganga]].\u201d<ref>''Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1989), vol.7, p.214</ref>\n\n\u201cIn the Women's Math there shall be no connection with monks, and in the Math for Men no connection with nuns.\u201d<ref>''Rules and Regulations of the Ramakrishna Math'', Belur, (1967), p.2</ref>\n\n[[Swami Vivekananda]] wanted women to set right their own problems. He has witnessed some outstanding women of renunciation among the women disciples of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] such as [[Gauri Ma]], [[Yogin Ma]], and [[Golap Ma]]. He wanted them to spread the message of Sri Ramakrishna through an organisation.<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.112</ref>\n\nIncidently, [[Sri Sarada Devi]] too, cherished the dream to start a monastery for women. This came to light from the letters of [[Swami Saradananda]] written to [[Sara Bull]], '[[Sister Nivedita]] and myself have found out by talking to Mother that she would like to see a convent started in the fashion of the Math, Belur, for women. Miss Glen who was here to visit the Holy Mother... also had a talk with Mother about it, and is very sanguine about the work.'<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.126</ref>\n\n== Activities ==\n6 November 1981, the stone temple was consecrated as per the Hindu tradition. Daily ritual worships are performed here by the nuns. The birthdays of Sri Ramakrishna, Sri Sarada Devi, Swami Vivekananda, and other holy personalities are celebrated here, besides the Hindu festivals.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vMMN2iqrag</ref> Religious discourse and lectures are also done regularly.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/mathhq.php</ref>\n\nThe training of brahmacharinis and novices are an essential activity of the Sri Sarada Math.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.302</ref>\n\nSri Sarada Math also has some prominent speakers on Vedanta and Hinduism who have been travelling the various parts of the world to deliver lectures, talks, and discourses. To name a few, Pravrajika Ajayaprana Mataji, Pravrajika Divyanandaprana<ref>http://vedantadc.org/sri-ramakrishna-and-vedanta-pravrajika-divyanandaprana</ref>, are some well-known nuns of Sri Sarada Math.\n\n== Publication ==\n''Nibodhata'', is the Bengali journal published every two months. It contains articles on various matters related to religion, science, art, culture, society, history.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/nibodhata.php</ref>\n\n''Samvit'' is the English journal published by Sri Sarada Math's New Delhi Center. Samvit was first published in 1980, through the efforts of Revered Pravrajika Muktiprana, the first General Secretary of Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The journal covers various religio-spiritual issues.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/samvit.php</ref>\n\nBesides journals, the Sri Sarada Math and its branch centres also have published several biographies of holy personalities, and books on Ramakrishna-Vedanta.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* http://www.srisaradamath.org/\n* http://srisaradamathrb.org/\n* https://saradavedanta.org/sri-sarada-math/\n* http://www.sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory.html\n\n[[Category:Hindu new religious movements]]\n[[Category:Ramakrishna Mission]]\n[[Category:Hindu organisations based in India]]\n[[Category:Hindu monasteries in India]]\n[[Category:Hinduism]]\n", "name_user": "Ranee Narendranath", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCurrent President", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Sarada_Math"}

Perception is our study over time of a particular object with our senses. It is necessarily incomplete; one can only see one side of a chair at a time, for example. Thus, perception involves observation. By contrast, imagination is total. In the chair that appears in our imagination, we have all sides of the chair given to us at once. However, Sartre points out that imaginary objects cannot teach us anything. The totality of the chair that appears in our imagination comes from a synthesis of our knowledge of the chair and our intention toward it. We expect the chair to be X or Y, therefore, in our imagination, it appears to us this way. Thus, Sartre calls what goes on when we picture something imaginary, \"quasi-observation\". Imaginary objects are a \"melange of past impressions and recent knowledge\" (''The Imaginary'' 90). In short, imaginary objects are what we intend them to be. Because imaginary objects appear to us in a way which is like perception but is not perception, we have a tendency to treat them as if they were real. That is not to say we are deluded; we know that they're imaginary. But we tend to ascribe emotions, traits, and beliefs to these irreal objects as if they were real.\n\nThroughout the book Sartre offers arguments against conceiving images as something inside a spatial consciousness. Sartre refers to this idea as the \"illusion of immanence\".\n\nSartre says that what is required for the imaginary process to occur is an ''analogon''\u2014that is, an equivalent of perception. This can be a painting, a photograph, a sketch, or even the [[mental image]] we conjure when we think of someone or something. Through the imaginary process, the ''analogon'' loses its own sense and takes on the sense of the object it represents. Again, we are not deluded. But at some level the photograph of my father ceases being merely colors on paper and instead stands in for my absent father. I then have a tendency to ascribe the feelings I have about my father to the picture of him. Thus, an ''analogon'' can take on new qualities based on my own intention toward it.\n\nUltimately, Sartre argues that because we can imagine, we are ontologically free. A consciousness that could not imagine, he points out, would be hopelessly mired in the \"real\", incapable of the perception of unrealized possibilities, and thus any real freedom of thought or choice. In order to imagine, a consciousness must be able to posit an object as irreal\u2014nonexistent, absent, somewhere else and it does so always from a particular point of view. All of our engagements with the world have the potential to activate the imaginary process. And because the imaginary process relies on intentionality, the world is constituted not from the outside into our consciousness, but rather ''we'' constitute the world based on our intentions toward it.\n\n==English translation==\nThe philosopher [[Thomas Baldwin (philosopher)|Thomas Baldwin]] writes in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'' (1995) that ''L'Imaginaire'' has been translated into English under the title ''The Psychology of Imagination''.

Professional genealogists may also conduct research for others, publish books on genealogical methods, teach, or produce their own databases. They may work for companies that provide software or produce materials of use to other professionals and to amateurs. Both try to understand not just where and when people lived, but also their lifestyles, biographies, and motivations. This often requires\u2014or leads to\u2014knowledge of antiquated laws, old political boundaries, migration trends, and historical socioeconomic or religious conditions.\n\nGenealogists sometimes specialize in a particular group, e.g. a [[Scottish clan]]; a particular [[surname]], such as in a [[one-name study]]; a small community, e.g. a single village or parish, such as in a [[one-place study]]; or a particular, often famous, person. [[Bloodlines of Salem]] is an example of a specialized family-history group. It welcomes members who can prove descent from a participant of the Salem Witch Trials or who simply choose to support the group.\n\nGenealogists and family historians often join [[Family history society|family history societies]], where novices can learn from more experienced researchers. Such societies generally serve a specific geographical area. Their members may also index records to make them more accessible, and engage in advocacy and other efforts to preserve public records and cemeteries.

He corresponded with other antiquarians in New England, where antiquarianism and genealogy were well established, and became a coordinator, booster, and contributor to the growing movement. In the 1820s, he and fellow antiquarians began to produce genealogical and antiquarian tracts in earnest, slowly gaining a devoted audience among the American people. Though Farmer died in 1839, his efforts led to the creation of the [[New England Historic Genealogical Society]] (NEHGS), one of New England's oldest and most prominent organizations dedicated to the preservation of public records.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Weil, \"John Farmer and the Making of American Genealogy,\" ''New England Quarterly'' 2007 80(3): 408\u2013434.</ref> NEHGS publishes the ''New England Historical and Genealogical Register.''\n\nThe [[Genealogical Society of Utah]], founded in 1894, later became the Family History Department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Reliable conclusions are based on the quality of sources, ideally original records, the information within those sources, ideally primary or firsthand information, and the evidence that can be drawn, directly or indirectly, from that information. In many instances, genealogists must skillfully assemble indirect or [[circumstantial evidence]] to build a case for identity and kinship. All evidence and conclusions, together with the documentation that supports them, is then assembled to create a cohesive genealogy or [[family history]].<ref>Board for Certification of Genealogists, ''The BCG Genealogical Standards Manual'' (Provo, Utah: Ancestry, 2000); National Genealogical Society, ''American Genealogy'' (Arlington, Virginia: 2005); Val D. Greenwood, ''The Researcher's Guide to American Genealogy,'' 3d ed. (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2000)\"</ref>\n\nGenealogists begin their research by collecting family documents and stories. This creates a foundation for [[documentary research]], which involves examining and evaluating historical records for evidence about ancestors and other relatives, their kinship ties, and the events that occurred in their lives. As a rule, genealogists begin with the present and work backward in time. Historical, social, and family context is essential to achieving correct identification of individuals and relationships. Source citation is also important when conducting genealogical research.<ref name=\"evidence\">Elizabeth Shown Mills, ''Evidence Explained: Citing History Sources from Artifacts to Cyberspace'', (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2007).</ref> To keep track of collected material, family group sheets and [[pedigree chart]]s are used.

Three DNA types are of particular interest: [[mitochondrial DNA]] that we all possess and that is passed down with only minor mutations through the matrilineal (direct female) line; the [[Y-chromosome]], present only in males, which is passed down with only minor mutations through the patrilineal (direct male) line; and the [[Autosomal DNA]], which is found in the 22 non-gender specific chromosomes (autosomes) inherited from both parents, which can uncover relatives from any branch of the family.  A [[genealogical DNA test]] allows two individuals to find the probability that they are, or are not, related within an estimated number of generations. Individual [[Genealogical DNA test|genetic test results]] are collected in databases to match people descended from a relatively recent common ancestor. See, for example, the [[Molecular Genealogy Research Project]]. These tests are limited to either the patrilineal or the matrilineal line.<ref>CeCe Moore, \"The History of Genetic Genealogy and Unknown Parentage Research: An Insider\u2019s View.\" ''Journal of Genetic Genealogy'' 8.1 (2016): 35-37.</ref>\n\n===Collaboration===\nMost [[genealogy software]] programs can export information about persons and their relationships in a standardized format called [[GEDCOM]]. In that format it can be shared with other genealogists, added to databases, or converted into family web sites. [[Social networking service]] (SNS) websites allow genealogists to share data and build their family trees online. Members can upload their family trees and contact other family historians to fill in gaps in their research.

These forums can be used to try to find relatives, request record lookups, obtain research advice, and much more. Many genealogists participate in loosely organized projects, both online and off. These collaborations take numerous forms. Some projects prepare name indexes for records, such as [[probate]] cases, and publish the indexes, either online or off. These indexes can be used as [[finding aid]]s to locate original records. Other projects transcribe or abstract records. Offering record lookups for particular geographic areas is another common service. Volunteers do record lookups or take photos in their home areas for researchers who are unable to travel.<ref>Heather Lynn Willever-Farr, ''Finding Family Facts in the Digital Age: Family History Research and Production Literacies'' (Drexel University Press, 2017).</ref>\n\nThose looking for a structured volunteer environment can join one of thousands of [[genealogical societies]] worldwide.

In order to do thorough research, genealogists keep track of which records have been destroyed so they know when information they need may be missing. Of particular note for North American genealogy is the [[1890 United States Census]], which was destroyed in a fire in 1921. Although fragments survive, most of the 1890 census no longer exists. Those looking for genealogical information for families that lived in the United States in 1890 must rely on other information to fill that gap.<ref>{{cite magazine | last = Blake | first = Kellee | date = 1996 | title = First in the Path of the Firemen: The Fate of the 1890 Population Census | url = https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1996/spring/1890-census-1.html | magazine = Prologue Magazine | location = Washington, D.C. | publisher = U.S. National Archives and Records Administration | access-date = 2 Aug 2019 | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6JMMUiJ8D?url=http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1996/spring/1890-census-1.html | archive-date = 3 September 2013 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nWar is another cause of record destruction.

Since genealogical records are often kept on paper and stacked in high-density storage, they are prone to fire, mold, insect damage, and eventual disintegration. Sometimes records of genealogical value are deliberately destroyed by governments or organizations because the records are considered to be unimportant or a privacy risk. Because of this, genealogists often organize efforts to preserve records that are at risk of destruction. [[FamilySearch]] has an ongoing program that assesses what useful genealogical records have the most risk of being destroyed, and sends volunteers to digitize such records.<ref name=\"familysearch preservation\">{{cite web |url=https://media.familysearch.org/familysearch-strategy-to-help-preserve-the-worlds-archives/ |title=FamilySearch's Strategy to Help Preserve the World's Archives |last=Hutchinson |first=Angelyn |date=20 Apr 2018 |website=FamilySearch |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |access-date=2 Aug 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713032311/https://media.familysearch.org/familysearch-strategy-to-help-preserve-the-worlds-archives/ |archive-date=13 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2017, the government of [[Sierra Leone]] asked FamilySearch for help preserving their rapidly deteriorating vital records.

Traditionally, the basic information needed to ensure correct identification of each person are place names, occupations, [[family name]]s, first names, and dates. However, modern genealogists greatly expand this list, recognizing the need to place this information in its historical context in order to properly evaluate genealogical evidence and distinguish between same-name individuals. A great deal of information is available for British ancestry<ref>Mark D. Herber, ''Ancestral Trails: The Complete Guide to British Genealogy and Family History'' 2nd ed.

J. A. Guth, \"Surname Spellings and Computerised Record Linkage,\" ''Historical Methods Newsletter'', vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 10\u201319, 1976.</ref>\n\nIn many cultures, the name of a person refers to the family to which he or she belongs. This is called the ''[[family name]]'', ''surname'', or ''last name''. [[Patronymic]]s are names that identify an individual based on the father's name. For example, Marga Olafsdottir is Marga, daughter of Olaf, and Olaf Thorsson is Olaf, son of Thor. Many cultures used patronymics before surnames were adopted or came into use. The Dutch in New York, for example, used the patronymic system of names until 1687 when the advent of English rule mandated surname usage.<ref>{{cite web | author=Lorine McGinnis Schulze | title=Dutch Patronymics of the 1600s | publisher=Olive Tree Genealogy | url=http://olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/pat.shtml | accessdate=2008-01-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501113910/http://www.olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/pat.shtml | archive-date=2008-05-01 | url-status=live }}</ref> In Iceland, patronymics are used by a majority of the population.<ref>Surnames made their way into the language in the 19th and 20th century, but are not widely used.

Not until 1856 in Denmark<ref>An earlier law was in effect in 1828, but was largely ignored in the rural areas.</ref> and 1923 in Norway<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Lov av 9. februar 1923 nr. 2 om personnavn (Norwegian Name Law of 1923) | url=http://www.geocities.com/dagtho/act19230209-002.html | publisher= | language=Norwegian | accessdate=2008-01-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610181013/http://www.geocities.com/dagtho/act19230209-002.html|archivedate=2007-06-10}}</ref> were there laws requiring surnames.\n\nThe transmission of names across generations, marriages and other relationships, and immigration may cause difficulty in genealogical research. For instance, women in many cultures have routinely used their spouse's surnames. When a woman remarried, she may have changed her name and the names of her children; only her name; or changed no names. Her birth name ([[maiden name]]) may be reflected in her children's middle names; her own middle name; or dropped entirely.<ref>E. A. Wrigley, ''English population history from family reconstitution, 1580\u20131837'' (1997); Catherine Quantin et al., \"Which are the best identifiers for record linkage?,\" ''Informatics for Health and Social Care'' 2004, Vol. 29, No. 3-4, Pages 221\u2013227</ref> Children may sometimes assume stepparent, foster parent, or adoptive parent names. Because official records may reflect many kinds of surname change, without explaining the underlying reason for the change, the correct identification of a person recorded identified with more than one name is challenging.  Immigrants to America often Americanized their names.<ref>Marc Picard, \"Genealogical Evidence and the Americanization of European Family Names,\" ''Names: American Name Society'' 2009 57(1): 30\u201351</ref>\n\nSurname data may be found in trade directories, census returns, birth, death, and marriage records.\n\n===Given names===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\nGenealogical data regarding [[given name]]s (first names) is subject to many of the same problems as are family names and place names. Additionally, the use of [[nicknames]] is very common. For example, Beth, Lizzie or Betty are all common for Elizabeth, and Jack, John and Jonathan may be interchanged.\n\nMiddle names provide additional information. Middle names may be inherited, follow naming customs, or be treated as part of the family name. For instance, in some Latin cultures, both the mother's family name and the father's family name are used by the children.\n\nHistorically, naming traditions existed in some places and cultures. Even in areas that tended to use naming conventions, however, they were by no means universal. Families may have used them some of the time, among some of their children, or not at all. A pattern might also be broken to name a newborn after a recently deceased sibling, aunt or uncle.\n\nAn example of a naming tradition from England, Scotland and Ireland:\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n{|width=50% |gap=4em\n| '''Child'''\n| '''Namesake'''\n|-\n| 1st son\n| paternal grandfather\n|-\n| 2nd son\n| maternal grandfather\n|-\n| 3rd son\n| father\n|-\n| 4th son\n| father's oldest brother\n|-\n| 1st daughter\n| maternal grandmother\n|-\n| 2nd daughter\n| paternal grandmother\n|-\n| 3rd daughter\n| mother\n|-\n| 4th daughter\n| mother's oldest sister\n|}\n</div>\n\nAnother example is in some areas of Germany, where siblings were given the same first name, often of a favourite saint or local nobility, but different second names by which they were known (''Rufname''). If a child died, the next child of the same gender that was born may have been given the same name. It is not uncommon that a list of a particular couple's children will show one or two names repeated.\n\nPersonal names have periods of popularity, so it is not uncommon to find many similarly named people in a generation, and even similarly named families; e.g., \"William and Mary and their children David, Mary, and John\".\n\nMany names may be identified strongly with a particular gender; e.g., William for boys, and Mary for girls. Others may be [[unisex names|ambiguous]], e.g., Lee, or have only slightly variant spellings based on gender, e.g., Frances (usually female) and Francis (usually male).\n\n===Place names===\nWhile the locations of ancestors' residences and life events are core elements of the genealogist's quest, they can often be confusing. Place names may be subject to variant spellings by partially literate scribes. Locations may have identical or very similar names. For example, the village name [[Brockton (disambiguation)|Brockton]] occurs six times in the border area between the English counties of [[Shropshire]] and [[Staffordshire]]. Shifts in political borders must also be understood. Parish, county, and national borders have frequently been modified. Old records may contain references to farms and villages that have ceased to exist. When working with older records from Poland, where borders and place names have changed frequently in past centuries, a source with maps and sample records such as ''[[A Translation Guide to 19th-Century Polish-Language Civil-Registration Documents]]'' can be invaluable.\n\nAvailable sources may include vital records (civil or church registration), censuses, and tax assessments. Oral tradition is also an important source, although it must be used with caution. When no source information is available for a location, circumstantial evidence may provide a probable answer based on a person's or a family's place of residence at the time of the event.\n\nMaps and gazetteers are important sources for understanding the places researched. They show the relationship of an area to neighboring communities and may be of help in understanding migration patterns. [[Family tree mapping]] using online mapping tools such as [[Google Earth]] (particularly when used with Historical Map overlays such as those from the [[David Rumsey Historical Map Collection]]) assist in the process of understanding the significance of geographical locations.\n\n===Dates===\nIt is wise to exercise extreme caution with dates. Dates are more difficult to recall years after an event, and are more easily mistranscribed than other types of genealogical data.<ref name=\"knights\">Peter R. Knights, \"The Accuracy of Age Reporting in the Manuscript Federal Census of 1850 and 1860,\" ''Historical Methods Newsletter,'' 4 (1971), 79\u201383; Karen Oppenheim Mason and Lisa G. Cope, \"Sources of Age and Date-of-Birth Misreporting in the 1900 U.S. Census,\" ''Demography'' vol. 24, no. 4 (Nov., 1987), pp. 563\u2013573.</ref> Therefore, one should determine whether the date was recorded at the time of the event or at a later date. Dates of birth in vital records or civil registrations and in church records at baptism are generally accurate because they were usually recorded near the time of the event. Family Bibles are often a source for dates, but can be written from memory long after the event. When the same ink and handwriting is used for all entries, the dates were probably written at the same time and therefore will be less reliable since the earlier dates were probably recorded well after the event. The publication date of the Bible also provides a clue about when the dates were recorded since they could not have been recorded at any earlier date.\n\nPeople sometimes reduce their age on marriage, and those under \"full age\" may increase their age in order to marry or to join the armed forces. [[Census]] returns are notoriously unreliable for ages or for assuming an approximate death date. Ages over 15 in the [[UK Census|1841 census in the UK]] are rounded down to the next lower multiple of five years.\n\nAlthough baptismal dates are often used to approximate birth dates, some families waited years before baptizing children, and adult baptisms are the norm in some religions. Both birth and marriage dates may have been adjusted to cover for pre-wedding pregnancies.\n\nCalendar changes must also be considered. In 1752, England and her American colonies changed from the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. In the same year, the date the new year began was changed. Prior to 1752 it was [[Lady Day|25 March]]; this was changed to 1 January. Many other European countries had already made the calendar changes before England had, sometimes centuries earlier. By 1751 there was an 11-day discrepancy between the date in England and the date in other European countries.\n\nFor further detail on the changes involved in moving from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, see: [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nThe [[French Republican Calendar]] or French Revolutionary Calendar was a calendar proposed during the French Revolution, and used by the French government for about 12 years from late 1793 to 1805, and for 18 days in 1871 in Paris. Dates in official records at this time use the revolutionary calendar and need \"translating\" into the Gregorian calendar for calculating ages etc. There are various websites which do this.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/ |title=Calendar Converter |publisher=Fourmilab.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913160427/http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/ |archive-date=2017-09-13 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Occupations===\nOccupational information may be important to understanding an ancestor's life and for distinguishing two people with the same name. A person's occupation may have been related to his or her social status, political interest, and migration pattern. Since skilled trades are often passed from father to son, occupation may also be indirect evidence of a family relationship.\n\nIt is important to remember that a person may change occupations, and that titles change over time as well. Some workers no longer fit for their primary trade often took less prestigious jobs later in life, while others moved upwards in prestige.<ref>Robert M. Hauser, [http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch/publications/files/public/Hauser_Occupational.Status.N.T.C.pdf \"Occupational Status in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621014531/http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch/publications/files/public/Hauser_Occupational.Status.N.T.C.pdf |date=2010-06-21 }}, ''Historical Methods'' (1982) vol. 15, no. 3, 111\u2013126.</ref> Many unskilled ancestors had a variety of jobs depending on the season and local trade requirements. Census returns may contain some embellishment; e.g., from [[labourer]] to [[masonry|mason]], or from [[journeyman]] to [[master craftsman]]. Names for old or unfamiliar local occupations may cause confusion if poorly legible. For example, an ostler (a keeper of horses) and a hostler (an innkeeper) could easily be confused for one another. Likewise, descriptions of such occupations may also be problematic. The perplexing description \"ironer of rabbit burrows\" may turn out to describe an ironer (profession) in the [[Bristol]] district named Rabbit Burrows. Several trades have regionally preferred terms. For example, \"shoemaker\" and \"cordwainer\" have the same meaning. Finally, many apparently obscure jobs are part of a larger trade community, such as watchmaking, [[Stocking frame|framework knitting]] or gunmaking.\n\nOccupational data may be reported in occupational licenses, tax assessments, membership records of professional organizations, trade directories, census returns, and vital records (civil registration). Occupational dictionaries are available to explain many obscure and archaic trades.<ref>For example, United States Bureau of Employment Security, ''The Dictionary of Occupational Titles'' (1939)</ref>\n\n==Reliability of sources==\nInformation found in historical or genealogical sources can be unreliable and it is good practice to evaluate all sources with a critical eye. Factors influencing the reliability of genealogical information include: the knowledge of the informant (or writer); the bias and mental state of the informant (or write; the passage of time and the potential for copying and compiling errors.\n\nThe quality of census data has been of special interest to historians, who have investigated reliability issues.<ref name=\"knights\"/><ref>Richard H. Steckel, \"The Quality of Census Data for Historical Inquiry: A Research Agenda,\" ''Social Science History,'' vol. 15, no. 4 (Winter, 1991), pp. 579\u2013599.</ref>\n\n===Knowledge of the informant===\nThe informant is the individual who provided the recorded information. Genealogists must carefully consider who provided the information and what he or she knew. In many cases the informant is identified in the record itself. For example, a death certificate usually has two informants: a physician who provides information about the time and cause of death and a family member who provides the birth date, names of parents, etc.\n\nWhen the informant is not identified, one can sometimes deduce information about the identity of the person by careful examination of the source. One should first consider who was alive (and nearby) when the record was created. When the informant is also the person recording the information, the handwriting can be compared to other handwriting samples.\n\nWhen a source does not provide clues about the informant, genealogists should treat the source with caution. These sources can be useful if they can be compared with independent sources. For example, a census record by itself cannot be given much weight because the informant is unknown. However, when censuses for several years concur on a piece of information that would not likely be guessed by a neighbor, it is likely that the information in these censuses was provided by a family member or other informed person. On the other hand, information in a single census cannot be confirmed by information in an undocumented compiled genealogy since the genealogy may have used the census record as its source and might therefore be dependent on the same misinformed individual.\n\n===Motivation of the informant===\nEven individuals who had knowledge of the fact, sometimes intentionally or unintentionally provided false or misleading information. A person may have lied in order to obtain a government benefit (such as a military pension), avoid taxation, or cover up an embarrassing situation (such as the existence of a non-marital child). A person with a distressed state of mind may not be able to accurately recall information. Many genealogical records were recorded at the time of a loved one's death, and so genealogists should consider the effect that grief may have had on the informant of these records.\n\n===The effect of time===\nThe passage of time often affects a person's ability to recall information. Therefore, as a general rule, data recorded soon after the event are usually more reliable than data recorded many years later. However, some types of data are more difficult to recall after many years than others. One type especially prone to recollection errors is dates. Also the ability to recall is affected by the significance that the event had to the individual. These values may have been affected by cultural or individual preferences.\n\n===Copying and compiling errors===\nGenealogists must consider the effects that copying and compiling errors may have had on the information in a source. For this reason, sources are generally categorized in two categories: original and derivative. An original source is one that is not based on another source. A derivative source is information taken from another source. This distinction is important because each time a source is copied, information about the record may be lost and errors may result from the copyist misreading, mistyping, or miswriting the information. Genealogists should consider the number of times information has been copied and the types of derivation a piece of information has undergone. The types of derivatives include: photocopies, transcriptions, abstracts, translations, extractions, and compilations.\n\nIn addition to copying errors, compiled sources (such as published genealogies and online pedigree databases) are susceptible to misidentification errors and incorrect conclusions based on circumstantial evidence. Identity errors usually occur when two or more individuals are assumed to be the same person. Circumstantial or indirect evidence does not explicitly answer a genealogical question, but either may be used with other sources to answer the question, suggest a probable answer, or eliminate certain possibilities. Compilers sometimes draw hasty conclusions from circumstantial evidence without sufficiently examining all available sources, without properly understanding the evidence, and without appropriately indicating the level of uncertainty.\n\n===Primary and secondary sources===\nIn genealogical research, information can be obtained from primary or secondary sources. Primary sources are records that were made at the time of the event, for example a death certificate would be a primary source for a person's death date and place. Secondary sources are records that are made days, weeks, months, or even years after an event.\n\n==Standards and Ethics==\n\nOrganizations that educate and certify genealogists have established standards and ethical guidelines they instruct genealogists to follow.\n\n===Research standards===\n\nGenealogy research requires analyzing documents and drawing conclusions based on the evidence provided in the available documents. Genealogists need standards to determine whether or not their evaluation of the evidence is accurate. In the past, genealogists in the [[United States]] borrowed terms from [[Burden of proof (law)|judicial law]] to examine evidence found in documents and how they relate to the researcher's conclusions. However, the differences between the two disciplines created a need for genealogists to develop their own standards. In 2000, the [[Board for Certification of Genealogists]] published their first manual of standards. The [[Genealogical Proof Standard]] created by the Board for Certification of Genealogists is widely distributed in seminars, workshops, and educational materials for genealogists in the United States. Other genealogical organizations around the world have created similar standards they invite genealogists to follow. Such standards provide guidelines for genealogists to evaluate their own research as well as the research of others.\n\nStandards for genealogical research include:<ref name=bcgstandards>{{cite web |url=https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/ |title=Ethics and Standards |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Board for Certification of Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721085908/https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/ |archive-date=21 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=sogstandards>{{cite web |url=http://www.sog.org.uk/learn/education-sub-page-for-testing-navigation/hints-tips-six-standards-and-good-practice-in-genealogy/ |title=Hints & Tips Five: Standards and Good Practice in Genealogy |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Society of Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704053351/http://www.sog.org.uk/learn/education-sub-page-for-testing-navigation/hints-tips-six-standards-and-good-practice-in-genealogy/ |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=iajgs>{{cite web |url=http://www.iajgs.org/blog/code-of-conduct/ |title=Code of Conduct/Ethics |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702023319/http://www.iajgs.org/blog/code-of-conduct/ |archive-date=2 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Clearly document and organize findings.\n* Cite all sources in a specific manner so that others can locate them and properly evaluate them.\n* Locate all available sources that may contain information relevant to the research question.\n* Analyze findings thoroughly, without ignoring conflicts in records or negative evidence.\n* Rely on original, rather than derivative sources, wherever possible.\n* Use logical reasoning based on reliable sources to reach conclusions.\n* Acknowledge when a specific conclusion is only \"possible\" or \"probable\" rather than \"proven.\"\n* Acknowledge that other records that have not yet been discovered may overturn a conclusion.\n\n===Ethical guidelines===\n\nGenealogists often handle sensitive information and share and publish such information. Because of this, there is a need for ethical standards and boundaries for when information is too sensitive to be published. Historically, some genealogists have fabricated information or have otherwise been untrustworthy. Genealogical organizations around the world have outlined ethical standards as an attempt to eliminate such problems. Ethical standards adopted by various genealogical organizations include:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/code/ |title=Genealogist's Code of Ethics |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Board for Certification of Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603030723/https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/code/ |archive-date=3 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.apgen.org/ethics/ |title=Code of Ethics and Professional Practices |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Association of Professional Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704030324/https://www.apgen.org/ethics/ |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=iajgs /><ref name=sogstandards /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://affho.org/about/ethics/ |title=Code of Ethics |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Australasian Federation of Family History Organisations |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704030325/http://affho.org/about/ethics/ |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Respect copyright laws\n* Acknowledge where one consulted another's work and do not plagiarize the work of other researchers.\n* Treat original records with respect and avoid causing damage to them or removing them from repositories.\n* Treat archives and archive staff with respect.\n* Protect the privacy of living individuals by not publishing or otherwise disclosing information about them without their permission.\n* Disclose any conflicts of interest to clients.\n* When doing paid research, be clear with the client about scope of research and fees involved.\n* Do not fabricate information or publish false or unproven information as proven.\n* Be sensitive about information found through genealogical research that may make the client or family members uncomfortable.\nIn 2015, a committee presented standards for [[genetic genealogy]] at the Salt Lake Institute of Genealogy. The standards emphasize that genealogists and testing companies should respect the privacy of clients and recognize the limits of DNA tests. It also discusses how genealogists should thoroughly document conclusions made using DNA evidence.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geneticgenealogystandards.com |title=The Genetic Genealogy Standards |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Genetic Genealogy Standartds |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724004323/https://www.geneticgenealogystandards.com/ |archive-date=24 July 2019 |url-status=live }}[/]</ref> In 2019, the Board for the Certification of Genealogists officially updated their standards and code of ethics to include standards for genetic genealogy.<ref name=bcgstandards />\n\n==See also==\n\n{{collist|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Ahnentafel]]\n* [[Cluster genealogy]]\n* [[Descent from antiquity]]\n* [[Family tree]]\n* [[Genealogical DNA test]]\n* [[Genealogical numbering systems]]\n* [[International Museum for Family History]]\n* [[Genealogy software]]\n* [[Genealogy tourism]]\n* [[List of genealogy databases]]\n* [[List of Mormon family organizations]]\n* [[Forensic genealogy]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''General'''\n* {{cite book |last=Christian |first=Peter |title=The Genealogist's Internet |edition=5th |location=London, England |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2012 |isbn=978-1-4081-5957-6 }}\n* Hopwood, Nick, Rebecca Flemming, Lauren Kassell, eds.

Genealogists use oral interviews, historical records, genetic analysis, and other records to obtain information about a family and to demonstrate [[kinship]] and [[Pedigree chart|pedigrees]] of its members. The results are often displayed in charts or written as narratives. Although generally used interchangeably, the traditional definition of \"genealogy\" begins with a person who is usually deceased and traces his or her descendants forward in time, whereas, \"family history\" begins with a person who is usually living and traces his or her ancestors.<ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|genealogy|accessdate=2019-06-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|family history|accessdate=2019-06-25}}</ref> Both the [[National Genealogical Society]] in the [[United States]] and the [[Society of Genealogists]] in the [[United Kingdom]] state that the word \"genealogy\" often refers to the scholarly discipline of researching lineages and connecting generations, whereas \"family history\" often refers to biographical studies of ones family, including family narratives and traditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ngsgenealogy.org/family-history/|title=Interested in Family History?

Professional genealogists may also conduct research for others, publish books on genealogical methods, teach, or produce their own databases. They may work for companies that provide software or produce materials of use to other professionals and to amateurs. Both try to understand not just where and when people lived, but also their lifestyles, biographies, and motivations. This often requires\u2014or leads to\u2014knowledge of antiquated laws, old political boundaries, migration trends, and historical socioeconomic or religious conditions.\n\nGenealogists sometimes specialize in a particular group, e.g. a [[Scottish clan]]; a particular [[surname]], such as in a [[one-name study]]; a small community, e.g. a single village or parish, such as in a [[one-place study]]; or a particular, often famous, person. [[Bloodlines of Salem]] is an example of a specialized family-history group. It welcomes members who can prove descent from a participant of the Salem Witch Trials or who simply choose to support the group.\n\nGenealogists and family historians often join [[Family history society|family history societies]], where novices can learn from more experienced researchers. Such societies generally serve a specific geographical area. Their members may also index records to make them more accessible, and engage in advocacy and other efforts to preserve public records and cemeteries. Some schools engage students in such projects as a means to reinforce lessons regarding immigration and history.<ref>{{cite news | first= | url=http://www.byubroadcasting.org/ancestors/teachersguide/ | title=Teacher's guide for PBS Ancestors series | publisher=BYU | date= | accessdate=2006-09-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006122948/http://byubroadcasting.org/ancestors/teachersguide/ | archive-date=2006-10-06 | url-status=live }}</ref> Other benefits include family medical histories with families with serious medical conditions that are hereditary.\n\nThe terms \"genealogy\" and \"family history\" are often used synonymously, but some offer a slight difference in definition.

In the 1820s, he and fellow antiquarians began to produce genealogical and antiquarian tracts in earnest, slowly gaining a devoted audience among the American people.

Reliable conclusions are based on the quality of sources, ideally original records, the information within those sources, ideally primary or firsthand information, and the evidence that can be drawn, directly or indirectly, from that information. In many instances, genealogists must skillfully assemble indirect or [[circumstantial evidence]] to build a case for identity and kinship. All evidence and conclusions, together with the documentation that supports them, is then assembled to create a cohesive genealogy or [[family history]].<ref>Board for Certification of Genealogists, ''The BCG Genealogical Standards Manual'' (Provo, Utah: Ancestry, 2000); National Genealogical Society, ''American Genealogy'' (Arlington, Virginia: 2005); Val D. Greenwood, ''The Researcher's Guide to American Genealogy,'' 3d ed. (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2000)\"</ref>\n\nGenealogists begin their research by collecting family documents and stories. This creates a foundation for [[documentary research]], which involves examining and evaluating historical records for evidence about ancestors and other relatives, their kinship ties, and the events that occurred in their lives. As a rule, genealogists begin with the present and work backward in time. Historical, social, and family context is essential to achieving correct identification of individuals and relationships.

Three DNA types are of particular interest: [[mitochondrial DNA]] that we all possess and that is passed down with only minor mutations through the matrilineal (direct female) line; the [[Y-chromosome]], present only in males, which is passed down with only minor mutations through the patrilineal (direct male) line; and the [[Autosomal DNA]], which is found in the 22 non-gender specific chromosomes (autosomes) inherited from both parents, which can uncover relatives from any branch of the family.  A [[genealogical DNA test]] allows two individuals to find the probability that they are, or are not, related within an estimated number of generations. Individual [[Genealogical DNA test|genetic test results]] are collected in databases to match people descended from a relatively recent common ancestor. See, for example, the [[Molecular Genealogy Research Project]]. These tests are limited to either the patrilineal or the matrilineal line.<ref>CeCe Moore, \"The History of Genetic Genealogy and Unknown Parentage Research: An Insider\u2019s View.\" ''Journal of Genetic Genealogy'' 8.1 (2016): 35-37.</ref>\n\n===Collaboration===\nMost [[genealogy software]] programs can export information about persons and their relationships in a standardized format called [[GEDCOM]].

At a minimum, genealogy software accommodates basic information about individuals, including births, marriages, and deaths. Many programs allow for additional biographical information, including occupation, residence, and notes, and most also offer a method for keeping track of the sources for each piece of evidence.<ref>Drew Smith,  ''Organize Your Genealogy: Strategies and Solutions for Every Researcher'' (F+ W Media, Inc., 2016).</ref>\nMost programs can generate basic kinship charts and reports, allow for the import of digital photographs and the export of data in the [[GEDCOM]] format (short for GEnealogical Data COMmunication) so that data can be shared with those using other genealogy software. More advanced features include the ability to restrict the information that is shared, usually by removing information about living people out of [[privacy]] concerns; the import of sound files; the generation of family history books, web pages and other publications; the ability to handle [[same-sex marriage]]s and children born out of wedlock; searching the Internet for data; and the provision of research guidance.  Programs may be geared toward a specific religion, with fields relevant to that religion, or to specific nationalities or ethnic groups, with source types relevant for those groups.

Since genealogical records are often kept on paper and stacked in high-density storage, they are prone to fire, mold, insect damage, and eventual disintegration. Sometimes records of genealogical value are deliberately destroyed by governments or organizations because the records are considered to be unimportant or a privacy risk. Because of this, genealogists often organize efforts to preserve records that are at risk of destruction.

Traditionally, the basic information needed to ensure correct identification of each person are place names, occupations, [[family name]]s, first names, and dates. However, modern genealogists greatly expand this list, recognizing the need to place this information in its historical context in order to properly evaluate genealogical evidence and distinguish between same-name individuals. A great deal of information is available for British ancestry<ref>Mark D. Herber, ''Ancestral Trails: The Complete Guide to British Genealogy and Family History'' 2nd ed.

J. A. Guth, \"Surname Spellings and Computerised Record Linkage,\" ''Historical Methods Newsletter'', vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 10\u201319, 1976.</ref>\n\nIn many cultures, the name of a person refers to the family to which he or she belongs. This is called the ''[[family name]]'', ''surname'', or ''last name''. [[Patronymic]]s are names that identify an individual based on the father's name. For example, Marga Olafsdottir is Marga, daughter of Olaf, and Olaf Thorsson is Olaf, son of Thor. Many cultures used patronymics before surnames were adopted or came into use. The Dutch in New York, for example, used the patronymic system of names until 1687 when the advent of English rule mandated surname usage.<ref>{{cite web | author=Lorine McGinnis Schulze | title=Dutch Patronymics of the 1600s | publisher=Olive Tree Genealogy | url=http://olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/pat.shtml | accessdate=2008-01-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501113910/http://www.olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/pat.shtml | archive-date=2008-05-01 | url-status=live }}</ref> In Iceland, patronymics are used by a majority of the population.<ref>Surnames made their way into the language in the 19th and 20th century, but are not widely used.

Not until 1856 in Denmark<ref>An earlier law was in effect in 1828, but was largely ignored in the rural areas.</ref> and 1923 in Norway<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Lov av 9. februar 1923 nr. 2 om personnavn (Norwegian Name Law of 1923) | url=http://www.geocities.com/dagtho/act19230209-002.html | publisher= | language=Norwegian | accessdate=2008-01-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610181013/http://www.geocities.com/dagtho/act19230209-002.html|archivedate=2007-06-10}}</ref> were there laws requiring surnames.\n\nThe transmission of names across generations, marriages and other relationships, and immigration may cause difficulty in genealogical research. For instance, women in many cultures have routinely used their spouse's surnames. When a woman remarried, she may have changed her name and the names of her children; only her name; or changed no names. Her birth name ([[maiden name]]) may be reflected in her children's middle names; her own middle name; or dropped entirely.<ref>E. A. Wrigley, ''English population history from family reconstitution, 1580\u20131837'' (1997); Catherine Quantin et al., \"Which are the best identifiers for record linkage?,\" ''Informatics for Health and Social Care'' 2004, Vol. 29, No. 3-4, Pages 221\u2013227</ref> Children may sometimes assume stepparent, foster parent, or adoptive parent names. Because official records may reflect many kinds of surname change, without explaining the underlying reason for the change, the correct identification of a person recorded identified with more than one name is challenging.  Immigrants to America often Americanized their names.<ref>Marc Picard, \"Genealogical Evidence and the Americanization of European Family Names,\" ''Names: American Name Society'' 2009 57(1): 30\u201351</ref>\n\nSurname data may be found in trade directories, census returns, birth, death, and marriage records.\n\n===Given names===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\nGenealogical data regarding [[given name]]s (first names) is subject to many of the same problems as are family names and place names. Additionally, the use of [[nicknames]] is very common. For example, Beth, Lizzie or Betty are all common for Elizabeth, and Jack, John and Jonathan may be interchanged.\n\nMiddle names provide additional information. Middle names may be inherited, follow naming customs, or be treated as part of the family name. For instance, in some Latin cultures, both the mother's family name and the father's family name are used by the children.\n\nHistorically, naming traditions existed in some places and cultures. Even in areas that tended to use naming conventions, however, they were by no means universal. Families may have used them some of the time, among some of their children, or not at all. A pattern might also be broken to name a newborn after a recently deceased sibling, aunt or uncle.\n\nAn example of a naming tradition from England, Scotland and Ireland:\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n{|width=50% |gap=4em\n| '''Child'''\n| '''Namesake'''\n|-\n| 1st son\n| paternal grandfather\n|-\n| 2nd son\n| maternal grandfather\n|-\n| 3rd son\n| father\n|-\n| 4th son\n| father's oldest brother\n|-\n| 1st daughter\n| maternal grandmother\n|-\n| 2nd daughter\n| paternal grandmother\n|-\n| 3rd daughter\n| mother\n|-\n| 4th daughter\n| mother's oldest sister\n|}\n</div>\n\nAnother example is in some areas of Germany, where siblings were given the same first name, often of a favourite saint or local nobility, but different second names by which they were known (''Rufname''). If a child died, the next child of the same gender that was born may have been given the same name. It is not uncommon that a list of a particular couple's children will show one or two names repeated.\n\nPersonal names have periods of popularity, so it is not uncommon to find many similarly named people in a generation, and even similarly named families; e.g., \"William and Mary and their children David, Mary, and John\".\n\nMany names may be identified strongly with a particular gender; e.g., William for boys, and Mary for girls. Others may be [[unisex names|ambiguous]], e.g., Lee, or have only slightly variant spellings based on gender, e.g., Frances (usually female) and Francis (usually male).\n\n===Place names===\nWhile the locations of ancestors' residences and life events are core elements of the genealogist's quest, they can often be confusing. Place names may be subject to variant spellings by partially literate scribes. Locations may have identical or very similar names. For example, the village name [[Brockton (disambiguation)|Brockton]] occurs six times in the border area between the English counties of [[Shropshire]] and [[Staffordshire]]. Shifts in political borders must also be understood. Parish, county, and national borders have frequently been modified. Old records may contain references to farms and villages that have ceased to exist. When working with older records from Poland, where borders and place names have changed frequently in past centuries, a source with maps and sample records such as ''[[A Translation Guide to 19th-Century Polish-Language Civil-Registration Documents]]'' can be invaluable.\n\nAvailable sources may include vital records (civil or church registration), censuses, and tax assessments. Oral tradition is also an important source, although it must be used with caution. When no source information is available for a location, circumstantial evidence may provide a probable answer based on a person's or a family's place of residence at the time of the event.\n\nMaps and gazetteers are important sources for understanding the places researched. They show the relationship of an area to neighboring communities and may be of help in understanding migration patterns. [[Family tree mapping]] using online mapping tools such as [[Google Earth]] (particularly when used with Historical Map overlays such as those from the [[David Rumsey Historical Map Collection]]) assist in the process of understanding the significance of geographical locations.\n\n===Dates===\nIt is wise to exercise extreme caution with dates. Dates are more difficult to recall years after an event, and are more easily mistranscribed than other types of genealogical data.<ref name=\"knights\">Peter R. Knights, \"The Accuracy of Age Reporting in the Manuscript Federal Census of 1850 and 1860,\" ''Historical Methods Newsletter,'' 4 (1971), 79\u201383; Karen Oppenheim Mason and Lisa G. Cope, \"Sources of Age and Date-of-Birth Misreporting in the 1900 U.S. Census,\" ''Demography'' vol. 24, no. 4 (Nov., 1987), pp. 563\u2013573.</ref> Therefore, one should determine whether the date was recorded at the time of the event or at a later date. Dates of birth in vital records or civil registrations and in church records at baptism are generally accurate because they were usually recorded near the time of the event. Family Bibles are often a source for dates, but can be written from memory long after the event. When the same ink and handwriting is used for all entries, the dates were probably written at the same time and therefore will be less reliable since the earlier dates were probably recorded well after the event. The publication date of the Bible also provides a clue about when the dates were recorded since they could not have been recorded at any earlier date.\n\nPeople sometimes reduce their age on marriage, and those under \"full age\" may increase their age in order to marry or to join the armed forces. [[Census]] returns are notoriously unreliable for ages or for assuming an approximate death date. Ages over 15 in the [[UK Census|1841 census in the UK]] are rounded down to the next lower multiple of five years.\n\nAlthough baptismal dates are often used to approximate birth dates, some families waited years before baptizing children, and adult baptisms are the norm in some religions. Both birth and marriage dates may have been adjusted to cover for pre-wedding pregnancies.\n\nCalendar changes must also be considered. In 1752, England and her American colonies changed from the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. In the same year, the date the new year began was changed. Prior to 1752 it was [[Lady Day|25 March]]; this was changed to 1 January. Many other European countries had already made the calendar changes before England had, sometimes centuries earlier. By 1751 there was an 11-day discrepancy between the date in England and the date in other European countries.\n\nFor further detail on the changes involved in moving from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, see: [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nThe [[French Republican Calendar]] or French Revolutionary Calendar was a calendar proposed during the French Revolution, and used by the French government for about 12 years from late 1793 to 1805, and for 18 days in 1871 in Paris. Dates in official records at this time use the revolutionary calendar and need \"translating\" into the Gregorian calendar for calculating ages etc. There are various websites which do this.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/ |title=Calendar Converter |publisher=Fourmilab.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913160427/http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/ |archive-date=2017-09-13 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Occupations===\nOccupational information may be important to understanding an ancestor's life and for distinguishing two people with the same name. A person's occupation may have been related to his or her social status, political interest, and migration pattern. Since skilled trades are often passed from father to son, occupation may also be indirect evidence of a family relationship.\n\nIt is important to remember that a person may change occupations, and that titles change over time as well. Some workers no longer fit for their primary trade often took less prestigious jobs later in life, while others moved upwards in prestige.<ref>Robert M. Hauser, [http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch/publications/files/public/Hauser_Occupational.Status.N.T.C.pdf \"Occupational Status in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621014531/http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch/publications/files/public/Hauser_Occupational.Status.N.T.C.pdf |date=2010-06-21 }}, ''Historical Methods'' (1982) vol. 15, no. 3, 111\u2013126.</ref> Many unskilled ancestors had a variety of jobs depending on the season and local trade requirements. Census returns may contain some embellishment; e.g., from [[labourer]] to [[masonry|mason]], or from [[journeyman]] to [[master craftsman]]. Names for old or unfamiliar local occupations may cause confusion if poorly legible. For example, an ostler (a keeper of horses) and a hostler (an innkeeper) could easily be confused for one another. Likewise, descriptions of such occupations may also be problematic. The perplexing description \"ironer of rabbit burrows\" may turn out to describe an ironer (profession) in the [[Bristol]] district named Rabbit Burrows. Several trades have regionally preferred terms. For example, \"shoemaker\" and \"cordwainer\" have the same meaning. Finally, many apparently obscure jobs are part of a larger trade community, such as watchmaking, [[Stocking frame|framework knitting]] or gunmaking.\n\nOccupational data may be reported in occupational licenses, tax assessments, membership records of professional organizations, trade directories, census returns, and vital records (civil registration). Occupational dictionaries are available to explain many obscure and archaic trades.<ref>For example, United States Bureau of Employment Security, ''The Dictionary of Occupational Titles'' (1939)</ref>\n\n==Reliability of sources==\nInformation found in historical or genealogical sources can be unreliable and it is good practice to evaluate all sources with a critical eye. Factors influencing the reliability of genealogical information include: the knowledge of the informant (or writer); the bias and mental state of the informant (or write; the passage of time and the potential for copying and compiling errors.\n\nThe quality of census data has been of special interest to historians, who have investigated reliability issues.<ref name=\"knights\"/><ref>Richard H. Steckel, \"The Quality of Census Data for Historical Inquiry: A Research Agenda,\" ''Social Science History,'' vol. 15, no. 4 (Winter, 1991), pp. 579\u2013599.</ref>\n\n===Knowledge of the informant===\nThe informant is the individual who provided the recorded information. Genealogists must carefully consider who provided the information and what he or she knew. In many cases the informant is identified in the record itself. For example, a death certificate usually has two informants: a physician who provides information about the time and cause of death and a family member who provides the birth date, names of parents, etc.\n\nWhen the informant is not identified, one can sometimes deduce information about the identity of the person by careful examination of the source. One should first consider who was alive (and nearby) when the record was created. When the informant is also the person recording the information, the handwriting can be compared to other handwriting samples.\n\nWhen a source does not provide clues about the informant, genealogists should treat the source with caution. These sources can be useful if they can be compared with independent sources. For example, a census record by itself cannot be given much weight because the informant is unknown. However, when censuses for several years concur on a piece of information that would not likely be guessed by a neighbor, it is likely that the information in these censuses was provided by a family member or other informed person. On the other hand, information in a single census cannot be confirmed by information in an undocumented compiled genealogy since the genealogy may have used the census record as its source and might therefore be dependent on the same misinformed individual.\n\n===Motivation of the informant===\nEven individuals who had knowledge of the fact, sometimes intentionally or unintentionally provided false or misleading information. A person may have lied in order to obtain a government benefit (such as a military pension), avoid taxation, or cover up an embarrassing situation (such as the existence of a non-marital child). A person with a distressed state of mind may not be able to accurately recall information. Many genealogical records were recorded at the time of a loved one's death, and so genealogists should consider the effect that grief may have had on the informant of these records.\n\n===The effect of time===\nThe passage of time often affects a person's ability to recall information. Therefore, as a general rule, data recorded soon after the event are usually more reliable than data recorded many years later. However, some types of data are more difficult to recall after many years than others. One type especially prone to recollection errors is dates. Also the ability to recall is affected by the significance that the event had to the individual. These values may have been affected by cultural or individual preferences.\n\n===Copying and compiling errors===\nGenealogists must consider the effects that copying and compiling errors may have had on the information in a source. For this reason, sources are generally categorized in two categories: original and derivative. An original source is one that is not based on another source. A derivative source is information taken from another source. This distinction is important because each time a source is copied, information about the record may be lost and errors may result from the copyist misreading, mistyping, or miswriting the information. Genealogists should consider the number of times information has been copied and the types of derivation a piece of information has undergone. The types of derivatives include: photocopies, transcriptions, abstracts, translations, extractions, and compilations.\n\nIn addition to copying errors, compiled sources (such as published genealogies and online pedigree databases) are susceptible to misidentification errors and incorrect conclusions based on circumstantial evidence. Identity errors usually occur when two or more individuals are assumed to be the same person. Circumstantial or indirect evidence does not explicitly answer a genealogical question, but either may be used with other sources to answer the question, suggest a probable answer, or eliminate certain possibilities. Compilers sometimes draw hasty conclusions from circumstantial evidence without sufficiently examining all available sources, without properly understanding the evidence, and without appropriately indicating the level of uncertainty.\n\n===Primary and secondary sources===\nIn genealogical research, information can be obtained from primary or secondary sources. Primary sources are records that were made at the time of the event, for example a death certificate would be a primary source for a person's death date and place. Secondary sources are records that are made days, weeks, months, or even years after an event.\n\n==Standards and Ethics==\n\nOrganizations that educate and certify genealogists have established standards and ethical guidelines they instruct genealogists to follow.\n\n===Research standards===\n\nGenealogy research requires analyzing documents and drawing conclusions based on the evidence provided in the available documents. Genealogists need standards to determine whether or not their evaluation of the evidence is accurate. In the past, genealogists in the [[United States]] borrowed terms from [[Burden of proof (law)|judicial law]] to examine evidence found in documents and how they relate to the researcher's conclusions. However, the differences between the two disciplines created a need for genealogists to develop their own standards. In 2000, the [[Board for Certification of Genealogists]] published their first manual of standards. The [[Genealogical Proof Standard]] created by the Board for Certification of Genealogists is widely distributed in seminars, workshops, and educational materials for genealogists in the United States. Other genealogical organizations around the world have created similar standards they invite genealogists to follow. Such standards provide guidelines for genealogists to evaluate their own research as well as the research of others.\n\nStandards for genealogical research include:<ref name=bcgstandards>{{cite web |url=https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/ |title=Ethics and Standards |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Board for Certification of Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721085908/https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/ |archive-date=21 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=sogstandards>{{cite web |url=http://www.sog.org.uk/learn/education-sub-page-for-testing-navigation/hints-tips-six-standards-and-good-practice-in-genealogy/ |title=Hints & Tips Five: Standards and Good Practice in Genealogy |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Society of Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704053351/http://www.sog.org.uk/learn/education-sub-page-for-testing-navigation/hints-tips-six-standards-and-good-practice-in-genealogy/ |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=iajgs>{{cite web |url=http://www.iajgs.org/blog/code-of-conduct/ |title=Code of Conduct/Ethics |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702023319/http://www.iajgs.org/blog/code-of-conduct/ |archive-date=2 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Clearly document and organize findings.\n* Cite all sources in a specific manner so that others can locate them and properly evaluate them.\n* Locate all available sources that may contain information relevant to the research question.\n* Analyze findings thoroughly, without ignoring conflicts in records or negative evidence.\n* Rely on original, rather than derivative sources, wherever possible.\n* Use logical reasoning based on reliable sources to reach conclusions.\n* Acknowledge when a specific conclusion is only \"possible\" or \"probable\" rather than \"proven.\"\n* Acknowledge that other records that have not yet been discovered may overturn a conclusion.\n\n===Ethical guidelines===\n\nGenealogists often handle sensitive information and share and publish such information. Because of this, there is a need for ethical standards and boundaries for when information is too sensitive to be published. Historically, some genealogists have fabricated information or have otherwise been untrustworthy. Genealogical organizations around the world have outlined ethical standards as an attempt to eliminate such problems. Ethical standards adopted by various genealogical organizations include:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/code/ |title=Genealogist's Code of Ethics |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Board for Certification of Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603030723/https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/code/ |archive-date=3 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.apgen.org/ethics/ |title=Code of Ethics and Professional Practices |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Association of Professional Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704030324/https://www.apgen.org/ethics/ |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=iajgs /><ref name=sogstandards /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://affho.org/about/ethics/ |title=Code of Ethics |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Australasian Federation of Family History Organisations |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704030325/http://affho.org/about/ethics/ |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Respect copyright laws\n* Acknowledge where one consulted another's work and do not plagiarize the work of other researchers.\n* Treat original records with respect and avoid causing damage to them or removing them from repositories.\n* Treat archives and archive staff with respect.\n* Protect the privacy of living individuals by not publishing or otherwise disclosing information about them without their permission.\n* Disclose any conflicts of interest to clients.\n* When doing paid research, be clear with the client about scope of research and fees involved.\n* Do not fabricate information or publish false or unproven information as proven.\n* Be sensitive about information found through genealogical research that may make the client or family members uncomfortable.\nIn 2015, a committee presented standards for [[genetic genealogy]] at the Salt Lake Institute of Genealogy. The standards emphasize that genealogists and testing companies should respect the privacy of clients and recognize the limits of DNA tests. It also discusses how genealogists should thoroughly document conclusions made using DNA evidence.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geneticgenealogystandards.com |title=The Genetic Genealogy Standards |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Genetic Genealogy Standartds |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724004323/https://www.geneticgenealogystandards.com/ |archive-date=24 July 2019 |url-status=live }}[/]</ref> In 2019, the Board for the Certification of Genealogists officially updated their standards and code of ethics to include standards for genetic genealogy.<ref name=bcgstandards />\n\n==See also==\n\n{{collist|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Ahnentafel]]\n* [[Cluster genealogy]]\n* [[Descent from antiquity]]\n* [[Family tree]]\n* [[Genealogical DNA test]]\n* [[Genealogical numbering systems]]\n* [[International Museum for Family History]]\n* [[Genealogy software]]\n* [[Genealogy tourism]]\n* [[List of genealogy databases]]\n* [[List of Mormon family organizations]]\n* [[Forensic genealogy]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''General'''\n* {{cite book |last=Christian |first=Peter |title=The Genealogist's Internet |edition=5th |location=London, England |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2012 |isbn=978-1-4081-5957-6 }}\n* Hopwood, Nick, Rebecca Flemming, Lauren Kassell, eds.

The duo produced the tracks without plans to release an album. After working on projects that were intended to be separate singles over five months, they considered the material good enough for an album.\n\n''Homework''{{'s}} success brought worldwide attention to [[French house]] music. ''Homework'' charted in 14 different countries, peaking at number 3 on the French Albums Chart, number 150 on the United States [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and at number 8 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. By February 2001, the album had sold more than two million copies worldwide and received several [[Gold certification|gold]] and [[Platinum certification|platinum]] certifications. Overall, ''Homework'' received positive critical response. The album features singles that had significant impact in French house and global dance music scenes, including the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Play|Hot Dance/Club Play]] number-one singles \"[[Da Funk]]\" and \"[[Around the World (Daft Punk song)|Around the World]]\", the latter of which reached number 61 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 1993, [[Thomas Bangalter]] and [[Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo]] presented a demo of their [[electronic music]] to [[Disc jockey|DJ]] Stuart Macmillan at a [[rave]] at [[Disneyland Resort Paris|EuroDisney]].<ref name=\"Interview at Mixmag 1997\">Collin, Matthew (August 1997).

The duo produced the tracks without plans to release an album. After working on projects that were intended to be separate singles over five months, they considered the material good enough for an album.\n\n''Homework''{{'s}} success brought worldwide attention to [[French house]] music. ''Homework'' charted in 14 different countries, peaking at number 3 on the French Albums Chart, number 150 on the United States [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and at number 8 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. By February 2001, the album had sold more than two million copies worldwide and received several [[Gold certification|gold]] and [[Platinum certification|platinum]] certifications. Overall, ''Homework'' received positive critical response. The album features singles that had significant impact in French house and global dance music scenes, including the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Play|Hot Dance/Club Play]] number-one singles \"[[Da Funk]]\" and \"[[Around the World (Daft Punk song)|Around the World]]\", the latter of which reached number 61 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 1993, [[Thomas Bangalter]] and [[Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo]] presented a demo of their [[electronic music]] to [[Disc jockey|DJ]] Stuart Macmillan at a [[rave]] at [[Disneyland Resort Paris|EuroDisney]].<ref name=\"Interview at Mixmag 1997\">Collin, Matthew (August 1997).

{"title_page": "Stage name", "text_new": "{{short description|Pseudonym used by performing artist}}\n\n{{use mdy dates|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Monroe 1953 publicity.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Norma Jeane Mortenson (pictured) rose to prominence under the name of ''[[Marilyn Monroe]]'', a combination of her mother's maiden name and the name of the Broadway star [[Marilyn Miller]].]]\n\nA '''stage name''' is a [[pseudonym]] used by [[performer]]s and [[entertainer]]s, such as [[actor]]s, [[comedian]]s, [[singing|singers]] and [[musician]]s. Such titles are adopted for a wide variety of reasons and may be similar or nearly identical to an individual's [[birth name]]. In some situations, a performer will eventually adopt their title as a [[legal name]], although this is often not the case. [[Nickname]]s are sometimes used as part of a person's professional name.\n\n==Motivation to use a stage name==\nA performer will often take a stage name because their real name is considered unattractive, dull, or unintentionally amusing, is difficult to pronounce or spell, has been used by another notable individual, or projects an undesired image. Sometimes a performer adopts a name which is unusual or outlandish to attract attention. Other performers use a stage name in order to retain anonymity. The equivalent concept among [[writer]]s is called a [[nom de plume]] or pen name. In [[radio]], the term \"radio name\" or \"air name\" is used.\n\n=== Family connection ===\nSome individuals who are related to a celebrity take a different last name so they are not perceived to have received [[Nepotism|undue advantage from their family connection]]. Actor [[Nicolas Cage]], born Nicolas Coppola, chose a new last name to avoid comparisons with his uncle, director [[Francis Ford Coppola]], who gave him his big break in the movie ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} \n\nConversely, individuals who wish to receive benefit from their family connections may take that person's first or last name. [[Lon Chaney Sr.]]'s son Creighton spent a number of years appearing in minor roles before renaming himself [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] [[Emilio Estevez]] and his sister [[Ren\u00e9e Estevez|Renee]] chose not to take their father [[Martin Sheen]]\u2019s professional name and use their birth names; however, their brother Carlos chose to use their father's professional name, and took the name [[Charlie Sheen]]. \n\nWomen who achieve fame after marriage often use their married name as part of their professional name, while women who achieved fame before marriage may continue to use their maiden name or a [[Hyphenated surname]].\n\nIn some cases, the individual may adopt a stage name to avoid confusion with other family members who have similar names. Actor [[Mark Harmon]] (Thomas Mark Harmon) uses his middle name professionally to avoid confusion with his father [[Heisman Trophy]] winner and former broadcaster [[Tom Harmon]] (Thomas Dudley Harmon).\n\n=== Guild and association rules ===\nGuilds and associations that represent actors, such as the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) in the [[United States]] and [[British Actors' Equity Association]] in the [[United Kingdom]], stipulate that no two members may have identical working names. An actor whose name has already been taken must choose a new name. \n\nNotable examples include: [[Nathan Lane]], whose birth name (Joseph Lane) was already in use; [[Stewart Granger]], born James Stewart; and [[Michael Keaton]], born Michael Douglas.  [[Diane Keaton]], whose birth name is Diane Hall, took her mother's maiden name as a stage name after learning that there was already a registered actress named Diane Hall in the [[Actors' Equity Association]]. ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' actress [[Vanessa L. Williams|Vanessa Williams]] officially uses \"Vanessa L. Williams\" due to SAG guidelines, although the other actress with same first and last name ([[Vanessa E. Williams]]) is arguably less notable. Similarly, [[David Walliams]] changed one letter in his surname due to there being another \"David Williams\". [[Terry O'Quinn]] of ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' fame changed his surname from Quinn to O'Quinn as another registered actor already had the name Terrance Quinn.  Long-time ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' writer and ''[[Futurama]]'' executive producer [[David X. Cohen]] changed his middle initial from S to X because there was already a David S.

Their choice of the name \"Patty\" was inspired by another child actress named [[Patty McCormack]] (Patty Duke later entitled her autobiography ''Call Me Anna'' ({{ISBN|0-553-27205-5}}).\n\n[[Cary Grant]] (born Archibald Leach) had his name selected for him by [[Paramount Pictures]].

German-born actor Hans Gudegast adopted the stage name of [[Eric Braeden]].\n\nActors [[Anthony Quinn]] and [[Anne Bancroft]] were advised to anglicize their names because 'Antonio Rodolfo Quinn Oaxaca' and 'Anna Maria Louisa Italiano', respectively, were considered too 'ethnic' for Hollywood and Broadway at the time. [[Eydie Gorme]] (born Edith Garmezano), [[Sophia Loren]] (born Sofia Villani Scicolone), [[Charles Bronson]] (born Charles Dennis Buchinsky), and [[Rita Hayworth]] (born Margarita Carmen Cansino), are four more well-known examples of this trend.\n\nBroadcaster [[Dave Roberts (broadcaster)|Dave Roberts]] was born David T. Boreanaz but was known professionally as Dave Thomas and later Dave Roberts as ethnic surnames were discouraged when he first began his career during the 1950s; his son, actor [[David Boreanaz]], chose not to adopt a stage name.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ex-Vampire Turns Into Regular Guy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/27/arts/television/27bore.html?ref=television&_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 27, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe use of stage names for ethnic purposes may vary widely depending on the [[media market]] the personality is representing. For example, in [[Buffalo, New York]], a city with a large [[Polish-American]] population, Polish-American media personalities typically work freely using their birth names.\n\nSicilian-American actor Espera Oscar de Corti, who built his film career portraying [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], reinvented himself as [[Iron Eyes Cody]].<ref name=Picayune/> He not only took his stage name as his legal name, but eventually began [[Passing (racial identity)#Passing as indigenous Americans|insisting that he actually was Native American]].<ref name=Picayune/>\n\n[[Chloe Bennet]] had used her birth name, Chloe Wang, for her singing career in China.

The [[Actors' Equity Association]] (AEA) advises performers to select a name that is easy for others to pronounce, spell, and remember. Some performers, while paying great attention to their skills and abilities, give little thought to the difference that a well-thought-out name can make to their career. Often a person or group decides on a different name only after they realize that a poorly chosen name gives a bad impression.\n\nActor [[Michael Caine]] was born Maurice Micklewhite and chose the name \"Michael\" because he preferred the sound of it to the less glamorous-sounding \"Maurice\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} He reputedly chose the name \"Caine\" because at that precise instant he saw a cinema marquee for the then-current movie ''[[The Caine Mutiny (film)|The Caine Mutiny]]'', and thought that it would make a good last name in conjunction with Michael. (\"Had I looked the other direction,\" he later quipped, \"I'd be known as Michael [[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|The One Hundred and One Dalmatians]].\")<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/1998/nov/06/1|title=Michael Caine (I)|last=Staff|first=Guardian|date=1998-11-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-07-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Similarly, actor [[Pete Postlethwaite]] was advised to adopt a different surname by peers who quipped that his \"would never be put [[Marquee (sign)|up in lights]] outside theaters because they couldn't afford the electricity\" (Postlethwaite rejected the advice).<ref name=\"Postlethwaitename\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/04/local/la-me-pete-postlethwaite-20110104|title=Pete Postlethwaite dies at 64; actor was nominated for an Oscar for 'In the Name of the Father'|author=McLellan, Dennis|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 4, 2011|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref> Conversely, Doris Kappelhoff heeded the suggestion of a bandleader who said that her name would never fit on the marquee; since \"Day By Day\" had become a signature song for her, she became known to the public as [[Doris Day]].\n\n=== Relevance to image ===\n[[Ching Lau Lauro]] (flourished 1827\u20131839) used a Chinese stage name to represent his stage image as a [[contortion]]ist in Chinese costume. He was probably the first magician to dress in Chinese costume on stage.<ref>During, Simon (2004). ''Modern Enchantments: The Cultural Power of Secular Magic''. London: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|9780674013711}}. Retrieved December 12, 2013.</ref>\n\nCommonly in the music world, and especially those of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[punk rock]], [[industrial music|industrial]], and [[hip hop music|hip hop]], musicians will rename themselves with names more menacing or striking than their birth names. Every member of the punk band [[Ramones]] took the pseudonymous \"Ramone\" surname as part of their collective stage persona. Members of New Zealand art-rock band [[Split Enz]] all took their middle names as stage names, so as to keep their private image separate from their public personae.\n\nOther performers may assume stage names as a means of distancing themselves from publicly known childhood names that could be considered professionally embarrassing, outlandish, or otherwise inappropriate.  Film director [[Duncan Jones]] (son of singer [[David Bowie]]) was known publicly as a child as Zowie Bowie.\n\nHip-hop artists are known to use stage names, such as [[Jay-Z]] (born Shawn Carter), [[50 Cent]] (born Curtis Jackson), [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] (born Sean Combs), [[Ludacris]] (born Chris Bridges), [[Lil Wayne]] (born Dwayne Carter Jr.), and [[Soulja Boy]] (born DeAndre Way). At times, these artists will use their real names to make promoted material seem more authentic or personal. [[Eminem]] has used his real name, Marshall Mathers, in various public events and as an [[alter ego]] as his real name gained recognition following the release of his multi-platinum album, ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]''.  Similarly, [[LL Cool J]] released the albums ''[[Mr. Smith (album)|Mr. Smith]]'' and ''[[Todd Smith (album)|Todd Smith]]'' in 1995 and 2006, respectively, under his real name, James Todd Smith. Rapper-singer-actress [[Queen Latifah]] released ''[[The Dana Owens Album]]'' under her own given name, Dana Owens, after changing her musical focus from hip-hop to vocal jazz. Rapper and sometime actor [[Xzibit]] has been credited by his real name Alvin Joiner in several television shows.\n\n===Euphony and ease of remembrance===\nSome performers and artists may choose to simplify their name to make it easier to spell and pronounce, and easier for others to remember. For instance, [[Fall Out Boy]] vocalist and guitarist [[Patrick Stump]] removed the \"h\" from his original name, Stumph. It was still pronounced \"stump,\" but the change ensured his audience wouldn't think to pronounce it \"stumf.\"  Singer [[Jason Derulo]] uses the phonetic spelling of his given name, Jason Desrouleaux.\n\n[[Andy Warhol]] dropped an \"a\" from his original name, Warhola, while couturier [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Mathieu-Saint-Laurent]] dropped the first of his two surnames. Rodolfo Alfonso Raffaello Piero Filiberto Guglielmi adopted the stage name [[Rudolph Valentino]] in part because American casting directors found his original surname difficult to pronounce. Singer [[George Michael]] (the son of a Greek Cypriot restaurateur in North London) was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou.\n\nSome surnames may carry unfortunate connotations. [[Hal Linden]], born Harold Lipshitz, adopted his stage name for fear that the embedded obscenity in his original surname could cost him work. [[Ralph Lauren]]'s brother (who was his guardian) changed their family name from Lifshitz for a similar reason: fear of mockery.  [[Duran Duran]]'s [[Nick Rhodes]], born Nicholas James Bates, changed his name to escape childhood ridicule (as a child, children would often tease him by calling him \"[[Masturbation|Master Bates]]\"; he adopted the surname \"Rhodes\" after a brand of [[Synthesizer|keyboard]]). [[Diana Dors]] was born Diana Fluck (one letter away from [[Fuck|a profanity]]); this prompted her to change her name to a more benign one in order to avoid an accidental obscenity (which could have been exacerbated by her status as a [[sex symbol]]).\n\n=== Musical use ===\nSome types of music are more associated with stage names than others. For example, [[hip hop]] and [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] artists almost always use stage names, whereas \"classical\" composers and performers virtually never do.  Classical violinist [[Amad\u00e9us Leopold]] (born in South Korea as Yoo Hanbin) and opera singers [[Beverly Sills]] (born Belle Miriam Silverman) and [[Nellie Melba]] (born Helen Porter Mitchell) are rare exceptions.\n\nSome Algerian ra\u00ef musicians use the prefix [[Cheb (disambiguation)|Cheb]] (for men) or Chaba (Chebba) for women. Both [[Arabic]] words mean \"young\" (e.g. as in [[Khaled (musician)|Cheb Khaled]], or \"Young Khaled\").\n\nSome performers take a series of different stage names. The British pop singer successful in the 1970s as [[Alvin Stardust]] previously went by the stage name of ''Shane Fenton'' in the 1960s. He had been born ''Bernard William Jewry''. Some performers will use different names in different settings. Charles Thompson, singer-songwriter for the alternative band the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], was known in that band as ''[[Black Francis]]''. He was called ''Frank Black'' as a solo performer, and again called ''Black Francis'' in a reunited Pixies.\n\nMany performers refer to their stage name as their \"professional name\". In some cases, performers subsequently adopt their stage name as their legal name. For instance, the former Robert Allen Zimmerman's legal name has been Robert Dylan ([[Bob Dylan]]) since he changed it in [[New York City]] [[New York Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in August 1962.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} [[Elton John]] was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight but changed his name by [[deed poll]], making Elton Hercules John his real name. When he was [[knighting|knighted]], he became Sir Elton Hercules John rather than Sir Reginald Kenneth Dwight. [[Elvis Costello]] (born Declan MacManus), who had adopted his professional name as a legal name, changed it back to his birth name in 1986. Another example is Marvin Lee Aday, known by his stage name [[Meat Loaf]].  {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} In a similar way, actress and singer [[Miley Cyrus]] was born Destiny Hope Cyrus but found \"Miley\" more comfortable, making it her legal name. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nEntire musical groups have been known to adopt a common stage [[surname]], the most notable arguably being the [[Ramones]]. Recent examples include [[Those Darlins]], [[Los Campesinos!]] and [[Ween]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Alter ego]]\n* [[Bardic name]]\n* [[List of stage names]]\n* [[Nickname]]\n* [[Nom de guerre]]\n* [[Notname]] for historical artists\n* [[Passing (racial identity)]]\n* [[Pen name]]\n* [[Pseudonym]]\n* [[Ring name]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Personal names|state=expanded}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stage name}}\n[[Category:Acting]]\n[[Category:Pseudonyms]]\n[[Category:Stand-up comedy]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Pseudonym used by performing artist}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{original research|date=August 2013}} the the the the first\n{{use mdy dates|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Monroe 1953 publicity.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Norma Jeane Mortenson (pictured) rose to prominence under the name of ''[[Marilyn Monroe]]'', a combination of her mother's maiden name and the name of the Broadway star [[Marilyn Miller]].]]\n\nA '''stage name''' is a [[pseudonym]] used by [[performer]]s and [[entertainer]]s, such as [[actor]]s, [[comedian]]s, [[singing|singers]] and [[musician]]s. Such titles are adopted for a wide variety of reasons and may be similar or nearly identical to an individual's [[birth name]]. In some situations, a performer will eventually adopt their title as a [[legal name]], although this is often not the case. [[Nickname]]s are sometimes used as part of a person's professional name.\n\n==Motivation to use a stage name==\nA performer will often take a stage name because their real name is considered unattractive, dull, or unintentionally amusing, is difficult to pronounce or spell, has been used by another notable individual, or projects an undesired image. Sometimes a performer adopts a name which is unusual or outlandish to attract attention. Other performers use a stage name in order to retain anonymity. The equivalent concept among [[writer]]s is called a [[nom de plume]] or pen name. In [[radio]], the term \"radio name\" or \"air name\" is used.\n\n=== Family connection ===\nSome individuals who are related to a celebrity take a different last name so they are not perceived to have received [[Nepotism|undue advantage from their family connection]]. Actor [[Nicolas Cage]], born Nicolas Coppola, chose a new last name to avoid comparisons with his uncle, director [[Francis Ford Coppola]], who gave him his big break in the movie ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} \n\nConversely, individuals who wish to receive benefit from their family connections may take that person's first or last name. [[Lon Chaney Sr.]]'s son Creighton spent a number of years appearing in minor roles before renaming himself [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] [[Emilio Estevez]] and his sister [[Ren\u00e9e Estevez|Renee]] chose not to take their father [[Martin Sheen]]\u2019s professional name and use their birth names; however, their brother Carlos chose to use their father's professional name, and took the name [[Charlie Sheen]]. \n\nWomen who achieve fame after marriage often use their married name as part of their professional name, while women who achieved fame before marriage may continue to use their maiden name or a [[Hyphenated surname]].\n\nIn some cases, the individual may adopt a stage name to avoid confusion with other family members who have similar names. Actor [[Mark Harmon]] (Thomas Mark Harmon) uses his middle name professionally to avoid confusion with his father [[Heisman Trophy]] winner and former broadcaster [[Tom Harmon]] (Thomas Dudley Harmon).\n\n=== Guild and association rules ===\nGuilds and associations that represent actors, such as the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) in the [[United States]] and [[British Actors' Equity Association]] in the [[United Kingdom]], stipulate that no two members may have identical working names. An actor whose name has already been taken must choose a new name. \n\nNotable examples include: [[Nathan Lane]], whose birth name (Joseph Lane) was already in use; [[Stewart Granger]], born James Stewart; and [[Michael Keaton]], born Michael Douglas.  [[Diane Keaton]], whose birth name is Diane Hall, took her mother's maiden name as a stage name after learning that there was already a registered actress named Diane Hall in the [[Actors' Equity Association]]. ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' actress [[Vanessa L. Williams|Vanessa Williams]] officially uses \"Vanessa L. Williams\" due to SAG guidelines, although the other actress with same first and last name ([[Vanessa E. Williams]]) is arguably less notable. Similarly, [[David Walliams]] changed one letter in his surname due to there being another \"David Williams\".

[[Jon Stewart]] did not anglicize his name for career reasons, but because of his estranged relationship with his father.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/330372182809133057|title=The Daily Show on Twitter|publisher=}}</ref> Israeli-American [[Natalie Portman]] changed her name to protect her privacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2830800236/portman-natalie-1981.html|title=Portman, Natalie (1981\u2013) - Dictionary definition of Portman, Natalie (1981\u2013) - Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nRam\u00f3n Est\u00e9vez changed his name to [[Martin Sheen]] as he felt it affected his job prospects due to racial discrimination and bias, although he maintains his birth name for legal documents such as his passport;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latina.com/entertainment/buzz/true-identity-charlie-sheen-tracing-roots-estevez-family|title=The True Identity of Charlie Sheen: Tracing The Roots of The Estevez Family|last=Ramirez|first=Erika|date=February 28, 2011|publisher=[[Latina magazine]]|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}</ref> his sons made divergent choices: Carlos Irwin Est\u00e9vez is now [[Charlie Sheen]], while [[Emilio Estevez]] left his name unchanged. German-born actor Hans Gudegast adopted the stage name of [[Eric Braeden]].\n\nActors [[Anthony Quinn]] and [[Anne Bancroft]] were advised to anglicize their names because 'Antonio Rodolfo Quinn Oaxaca' and 'Anna Maria Louisa Italiano', respectively, were considered too 'ethnic' for Hollywood and Broadway at the time. [[Eydie Gorme]] (born Edith Garmezano), [[Sophia Loren]] (born Sofia Villani Scicolone), [[Charles Bronson]] (born Charles Dennis Buchinsky), and [[Rita Hayworth]] (born Margarita Carmen Cansino), are four more well-known examples of this trend.\n\nBroadcaster [[Dave Roberts (broadcaster)|Dave Roberts]] was born David T. Boreanaz but was known professionally as Dave Thomas and later Dave Roberts as ethnic surnames were discouraged when he first began his career during the 1950s; his son, actor [[David Boreanaz]], chose not to adopt a stage name.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ex-Vampire Turns Into Regular Guy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/27/arts/television/27bore.html?ref=television&_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 27, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe use of stage names for ethnic purposes may vary widely depending on the [[media market]] the personality is representing. For example, in [[Buffalo, New York]], a city with a large [[Polish-American]] population, Polish-American media personalities typically work freely using their birth names.\n\nSicilian-American actor Espera Oscar de Corti, who built his film career portraying [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], reinvented himself as [[Iron Eyes Cody]].<ref name=Picayune/> He not only took his stage name as his legal name, but eventually began [[Passing (racial identity)#Passing as indigenous Americans|insisting that he actually was Native American]].<ref name=Picayune/>\n\n[[Chloe Bennet]] had used her birth name, Chloe Wang, for her singing career in China.

The [[Actors' Equity Association]] (AEA) advises performers to select a name that is easy for others to pronounce, spell, and remember. Some performers, while paying great attention to their skills and abilities, give little thought to the difference that a well-thought-out name can make to their career. Often a person or group decides on a different name only after they realize that a poorly chosen name gives a bad impression.\n\nActor [[Michael Caine]] was born Maurice Micklewhite and chose the name \"Michael\" because he preferred the sound of it to the less glamorous-sounding \"Maurice\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} He reputedly chose the name \"Caine\" because at that precise instant he saw a cinema marquee for the then-current movie ''[[The Caine Mutiny (film)|The Caine Mutiny]]'', and thought that it would make a good last name in conjunction with Michael. (\"Had I looked the other direction,\" he later quipped, \"I'd be known as Michael [[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|The One Hundred and One Dalmatians]].\")<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/1998/nov/06/1|title=Michael Caine (I)|last=Staff|first=Guardian|date=1998-11-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-07-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Similarly, actor [[Pete Postlethwaite]] was advised to adopt a different surname by peers who quipped that his \"would never be put [[Marquee (sign)|up in lights]] outside theaters because they couldn't afford the electricity\" (Postlethwaite rejected the advice).<ref name=\"Postlethwaitename\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/04/local/la-me-pete-postlethwaite-20110104|title=Pete Postlethwaite dies at 64; actor was nominated for an Oscar for 'In the Name of the Father'|author=McLellan, Dennis|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 4, 2011|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref> Conversely, Doris Kappelhoff heeded the suggestion of a bandleader who said that her name would never fit on the marquee; since \"Day By Day\" had become a signature song for her, she became known to the public as [[Doris Day]].\n\n=== Relevance to image ===\n[[Ching Lau Lauro]] (flourished 1827\u20131839) used a Chinese stage name to represent his stage image as a [[contortion]]ist in Chinese costume. He was probably the first magician to dress in Chinese costume on stage.<ref>During, Simon (2004). ''Modern Enchantments: The Cultural Power of Secular Magic''. London: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|9780674013711}}. Retrieved December 12, 2013.</ref>\n\nCommonly in the music world, and especially those of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[punk rock]], [[industrial music|industrial]], and [[hip hop music|hip hop]], musicians will rename themselves with names more menacing or striking than their birth names. Every member of the punk band [[Ramones]] took the pseudonymous \"Ramone\" surname as part of their collective stage persona. Members of New Zealand art-rock band [[Split Enz]] all took their middle names as stage names, so as to keep their private image separate from their public personae.\n\nOther performers may assume stage names as a means of distancing themselves from publicly known childhood names that could be considered professionally embarrassing, outlandish, or otherwise inappropriate.  Film director [[Duncan Jones]] (son of singer [[David Bowie]]) was known publicly as a child as Zowie Bowie.\n\nHip-hop artists are known to use stage names, such as [[Jay-Z]] (born Shawn Carter), [[50 Cent]] (born Curtis Jackson), [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] (born Sean Combs), [[Ludacris]] (born Chris Bridges), [[Lil Wayne]] (born Dwayne Carter Jr.), and [[Soulja Boy]] (born DeAndre Way). At times, these artists will use their real names to make promoted material seem more authentic or personal. [[Eminem]] has used his real name, Marshall Mathers, in various public events and as an [[alter ego]] as his real name gained recognition following the release of his multi-platinum album, ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]''.  Similarly, [[LL Cool J]] released the albums ''[[Mr. Smith (album)|Mr. Smith]]'' and ''[[Todd Smith (album)|Todd Smith]]'' in 1995 and 2006, respectively, under his real name, James Todd Smith. Rapper-singer-actress [[Queen Latifah]] released ''[[The Dana Owens Album]]'' under her own given name, Dana Owens, after changing her musical focus from hip-hop to vocal jazz. Rapper and sometime actor [[Xzibit]] has been credited by his real name Alvin Joiner in several television shows.\n\n===Euphony and ease of remembrance===\nSome performers and artists may choose to simplify their name to make it easier to spell and pronounce, and easier for others to remember. For instance, [[Fall Out Boy]] vocalist and guitarist [[Patrick Stump]] removed the \"h\" from his original name, Stumph. It was still pronounced \"stump,\" but the change ensured his audience wouldn't think to pronounce it \"stumf.\"  Singer [[Jason Derulo]] uses the phonetic spelling of his given name, Jason Desrouleaux.\n\n[[Andy Warhol]] dropped an \"a\" from his original name, Warhola, while couturier [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Mathieu-Saint-Laurent]] dropped the first of his two surnames. Rodolfo Alfonso Raffaello Piero Filiberto Guglielmi adopted the stage name [[Rudolph Valentino]] in part because American casting directors found his original surname difficult to pronounce. Singer [[George Michael]] (the son of a Greek Cypriot restaurateur in North London) was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou.\n\nSome surnames may carry unfortunate connotations. [[Hal Linden]], born Harold Lipshitz, adopted his stage name for fear that the embedded obscenity in his original surname could cost him work. [[Ralph Lauren]]'s brother (who was his guardian) changed their family name from Lifshitz for a similar reason: fear of mockery.  [[Duran Duran]]'s [[Nick Rhodes]], born Nicholas James Bates, changed his name to escape childhood ridicule (as a child, children would often tease him by calling him \"[[Masturbation|Master Bates]]\"; he adopted the surname \"Rhodes\" after a brand of [[Synthesizer|keyboard]]). [[Diana Dors]] was born Diana Fluck (one letter away from [[Fuck|a profanity]]); this prompted her to change her name to a more benign one in order to avoid an accidental obscenity (which could have been exacerbated by her status as a [[sex symbol]]).\n\n=== Musical use ===\nSome types of music are more associated with stage names than others. For example, [[hip hop]] and [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] artists almost always use stage names, whereas \"classical\" composers and performers virtually never do.  Classical violinist [[Amad\u00e9us Leopold]] (born in South Korea as Yoo Hanbin) and opera singers [[Beverly Sills]] (born Belle Miriam Silverman) and [[Nellie Melba]] (born Helen Porter Mitchell) are rare exceptions.\n\nSome Algerian ra\u00ef musicians use the prefix [[Cheb (disambiguation)|Cheb]] (for men) or Chaba (Chebba) for women. Both [[Arabic]] words mean \"young\" (e.g. as in [[Khaled (musician)|Cheb Khaled]], or \"Young Khaled\").\n\nSome performers take a series of different stage names. The British pop singer successful in the 1970s as [[Alvin Stardust]] previously went by the stage name of ''Shane Fenton'' in the 1960s. He had been born ''Bernard William Jewry''. Some performers will use different names in different settings. Charles Thompson, singer-songwriter for the alternative band the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], was known in that band as ''[[Black Francis]]''. He was called ''Frank Black'' as a solo performer, and again called ''Black Francis'' in a reunited Pixies.\n\nMany performers refer to their stage name as their \"professional name\". In some cases, performers subsequently adopt their stage name as their legal name. For instance, the former Robert Allen Zimmerman's legal name has been Robert Dylan ([[Bob Dylan]]) since he changed it in [[New York City]] [[New York Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in August 1962.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} [[Elton John]] was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight but changed his name by [[deed poll]], making Elton Hercules John his real name. When he was [[knighting|knighted]], he became Sir Elton Hercules John rather than Sir Reginald Kenneth Dwight. [[Elvis Costello]] (born Declan MacManus), who had adopted his professional name as a legal name, changed it back to his birth name in 1986. Another example is Marvin Lee Aday, known by his stage name [[Meat Loaf]].  {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} In a similar way, actress and singer [[Miley Cyrus]] was born Destiny Hope Cyrus but found \"Miley\" more comfortable, making it her legal name. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nEntire musical groups have been known to adopt a common stage [[surname]], the most notable arguably being the [[Ramones]]. Recent examples include [[Those Darlins]], [[Los Campesinos!]] and [[Ween]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Alter ego]]\n* [[Bardic name]]\n* [[List of stage names]]\n* [[Nickname]]\n* [[Nom de guerre]]\n* [[Notname]] for historical artists\n* [[Passing (racial identity)]]\n* [[Pen name]]\n* [[Pseudonym]]\n* [[Ring name]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Personal names|state=expanded}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stage name}}\n[[Category:Acting]]\n[[Category:Pseudonyms]]\n[[Category:Stand-up comedy]]\n", "name_user": "Vignesh.Mukund", "label": "safe", "comment": "cleaned display preview", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_name"}

The development of the Waja began at the end of the 1999, together with the [[Campro engine]], however, the development of the Campro engine was still in progress at the time of its launch, and therefore Proton had to outsource various engines for the Waja between 2000 and 2006 such as the 4G18 engine for the Waja from [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]].\n\nMore than 292,556 Proton Wajas have been sold between 2000 and 2012, and of which, the variants powered by the 1.6 litre [[Mitsubishi Orion engine|Mitsubishi 4G18]] engine made up for the bulk of total sales, followed by the 1.6 litre [[Campro engine|Proton CamPro S4PH / CPS]] and lastly, the 1.8 litre [[Renault F-Type engine|Renault F4P]].{{lower|0.2em|{{#tag:ref|'''Disclaimer''': Sales data taken from an archived official source.

The Proton Waja was also subjected to two recalls. The first recall affected only the manual transmission variants, where the bolts used for the manual transmission were incorrectly tightened. The subsequent recall in 2005, involved approximately 3000 units due to defective alloy wheels. <ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motortrader.com.my/news/an-open-letter-to-tun-dr-mahathir-mohamad-chairman-of-proton/|title=An open letter to Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Chairman of Proton|last=MotorTraderMY|date=2016-02-15|website=Motor Trader Car News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stcars.sg/guides-articles/malaysia-recalls-nearly-3000-waja-cars-for-wheel-rim-defect-83706|title=Malaysia recalls nearly 3,000 Waja cars for wheel rim defect|website=STCars|language=en-us|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref>\n\n== Specifications ==\n{{Expand list|date=May 2011}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Mitsubishi 4G18\n!Renault F4P\n!Proton Campro S4PH\n!Proton Campro CPS\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |  '''Powertrain & Performance'''\n|-\n| Engine || 16-Valve 4G18P SOHC 5MT\n|\n|16-Valve S4PH DOHC 5MT\n|\n|-\n| Maximum Speed (km/h) || 186&nbsp;km/h\n|\n|190&nbsp;km/h\n|\n|-\n| Acceleration 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (sec) || 12 sec\n|\n|12 sec\n|\n|-\n| Maximum Output kW(hp)/rpm || 76&nbsp;kW (102&nbsp;hp) / 6,000rpm\n|\n|82&nbsp;kW (110&nbsp;hp) / 6,000rpm\n|\n|-\n| Maximum Torque (Nm/rpm) || 140&nbsp;Nm / 2,750rpm\n|\n|148&nbsp;Nm / 4,000rpm\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |  Chassis \n|-\n| Power Steering || colspan=\"4\" | Hydraulic Power Steering\n|-\n| Suspension (Front/Rear) || colspan=\"4\" | MacPherson Strut with Stabiliser Bar/ Multi-link with Stabiliser Bar \n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|2|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Malaysia '07\">{{cite web|author=Matthias Gasnier |url=http://bestsellingcarsblog.com/2008/01/28/malaysia-2006-2007-perodua-myvi-takes-control-of-the-market/ |title=Malaysia 2006-2007: Perodua Myvi takes control of the market |publisher=bestsellingcarsblog.com |date=28 January 2008 |accessdate=25 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Malaysia '08,'09\">{{cite web|author=Matthias Gasnier |url=http://bestsellingcarsblog.com/2010/01/28/malaysia-2008-2009-perodua-myvi-viva-proton-saga-on-podium/ |title=Malaysia 2008-2009: Perodua Myvi, Viva & Proton Saga on podium |publisher=bestsellingcarsblog.com |date=28 January 2010 |accessdate=13 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Malaysia '10,'11\">{{cite web|author=Matthias Gasnier |url=http://bestsellingcarsblog.com/2012/02/13/malaysia-full-year-2011-perodua-myvi-and-proton-saga-rule/ |title=Malaysia Full Year 2011: Perodua Myvi and Proton Saga rule |publisher=bestsellingcarsblog.com |date=13 February 2012 |accessdate=13 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Malaysia '12\">{{cite web|author=Matthias Gasnier |url=http://bestsellingcarsblog.com/2012/07/02/malaysia-may-2012-proton-preve-up-to-7/ |title=Malaysia May 2012: Proton Prev\u00e9 up to #7 |publisher=bestsellingcarsblog.com |date=2 July 2012 |accessdate=13 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Proton Production Data 2009-2015\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.marklines.com/en/vehicle_production/month_malaysia |title=Monthly Production by Maker/Brand in Malaysia, 2009-2015 |publisher=marklines.com |date=21 May 2015 |accessdate=21 May 2015 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Proton Chancellor pre-launch\">{{cite web|author=[[Paul Tan]] |url=http://paultan.org/2005/11/22/proton-chancellor-20-v6/ |title=Proton Chancellor 2.0 V6 |publisher=paultan.org |date=22 November 2005 |accessdate=3 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603123743/http://paultan.org/2005/11/22/proton-chancellor-20-v6/ |archivedate=3 June 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n{{Reflist|2|group=N\n\n}}\n\n{{commons}}\n\n{{Proton vehicles}}\n\n[[Category:Proton vehicles|Waja]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 2000]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n", "name_user": "Bindydad123", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_Waja"}

In modern times, various economists within the [[Georgism]] movement propose measures like the [[land value tax]] to enhance access to the natural world for all. Poverty occurs in both [[developing country|developing countries]] and [[developed country|developed countries]]. While poverty is much more widespread in developing countries, both types of countries undertake poverty reduction measures.\n\nPoverty has been historically accepted in some parts of the world as inevitable as non-industrialized economies produced very little, while populations grew almost as fast, making wealth scarce.<ref>\"Under traditional (i.e., non-industrialized) modes of economic production, widespread poverty had been accepted as inevitable. The total output of goods and services, even if equally distributed, would still have been insufficient to give the entire population a [[right to an adequate standard of living]] by prevailing standards.

According to the [[UNRISD]], increasing labour productivity appears to have a negative impact on job creation: in the 1960s, a 1% increase in output per worker was associated with a reduction in employment growth of 0.07%, by the first decade of this century the same productivity increase implies reduced employment growth by 0.54%.<ref name=ODI2/>\n\nIncreases in employment without increases in productivity leads to a rise in the number of \"[[working poor]]\", which is why some experts are now promoting the creation of \"quality\" and not \"quantity\" in labour market policies.<ref name=ODI2/> This approach does highlight how higher productivity has helped reduce poverty in East Asia, but the negative impact is beginning to show.<ref name=ODI2/> In [[Vietnam]], for example, employment growth has slowed while productivity growth has continued.<ref name=ODI2/> Furthermore, productivity increases do not always lead to increased wages, as can be seen in the US, where the gap between productivity and wages has been rising since the 1980s.<ref name=ODI2/> The ODI study showed that other sectors were just as important in reducing unemployment, as [[manufacturing]].<ref name=ODI2/> The [[services sector]] is most effective at translating productivity growth into employment growth.

The study assessed the potential economic and poverty impact of 11 improved chickpea varieties, released by the national agricultural research organization of Ethiopia in collaboration with the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]], ([[ICRISAT]]). The researchers estimated that using the varieties would bring about a total benefit of US$111 million for 30 years with consumers receiving 39% of the benefit and producers 61%. They expected the generated benefit would lift more than 0.7 million people (both producers and consumers) out of poverty. The authors concluded that further investments in the [[chickpea]] and other legume research in [[Ethiopia]] were therefore justified as a means of poverty alleviation.<ref>Macharia I, Orr A, Simtowe F and Asfaw, S., ''Potential economic and poverty impact of improved chickpea technologies in Ethiopia'' http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/chickpea/685/107. [[ICRISAT]]. Downloaded 26 January 2014.</ref>\n\nImproving water management is an effective way to help reduce poverty among farmers. With better water management, they can improve productivity and potentially move beyond subsistence-level farming. During the Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, for example, irrigation was a key factor in unlocking Asia's agricultural potential and reducing poverty. Between 1961 and 2002, the irrigated area almost doubled, as governments sought to achieve food security, improve public welfare and generate economic growth. In South Asia, cereal production rose by 137% from 1970 to 2007. This was achieved with only 3% more land.<ref>Mukherji, A.

One project its scientists worked on demonstrates the impact that improving water management in agriculture can have. The study, funded by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, initially upgraded and irrigated the irrigation system on the Walawe Left Bank, Sri Lanka, in 1997. In 2005, irrigation was extended to a further area. An analysis of the whole area was carried out in 2007 and 2008. This study found that access to irrigation provided families with opportunities to diversify their livelihood activities and potentially increase their incomes. For example, people with land could reliably grow rice or vegetables instead of working as labourers or relying on rainfall to water their crops. Those without land could benefit by working within new inland fisheries. Within the project's control area, 57% of households were below the poverty line in 2002 compared with 43% in 2007.<ref>[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/Landing_Pages/WIB8.aspx ''Water, poverty and equity''].

Poverty activist [[Paul Polak]] has based his career around doing both at once, creating companies that employ the poor while creating \"radically\" affordable goods. In his book ''Out of Poverty'' he argues that traditional poverty eradication strategies have been misguided and fail to address underlying problems. He lists \"Three Great Poverty Eradication Myths\": that we can donate people out of poverty, that national economic growth will end poverty, and that Big Business, operating as it does now, will end poverty.<ref>{{cite web|last=Polak|first=Paul|title=Out of Poverty|url=http://www.bkconnection.com/ProdDetails.asp?ID=9781605092768&PG=1&Type=BL&PCS=BKP}}</ref> Economic models which lead to national growth and more big business will not necessarily lead to more opportunities for self-sufficiency.

During their reform periods, all three have reduced their poverty rates, but through a different mix of approaches. The report used a common poverty line of $1.25 per person, per day, at purchasing parity power for consumption in 2008. Using that metric and evaluating the period between 1981 and 2005, the poverty rate in China dropped from 84% to 16%; India from 60% to 42%; and Brazil from 17% to 8%. The report sketches an overall scorecard of the countries on the two basic dimensions of pro-poor growth and pro-poor policy intervention: \"China clearly scores well on the pro-poor growth side of the card, but neither Brazil nor India do; in Brazil's case for lack of growth and in India's case for lack of poverty-reducing growth. Brazil scores well on the social policies side, but China and India do not; in China's case progress has been slow in implementing new social policies more relevant to the new market economy (despite historical advantages in this area, inherited from the past regime) and in India's case the bigger problems are the extent of capture of the many existing policies by non-poor groups and the weak capabilities of the state for delivering better basic public services.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/international/poverty-reduction-brazil-china-india/ |title = Comparative Perspective on Poverty Reduction in Brazil, China, and India |publisher=Journalist's Resource.org }}</ref>\n\n==Aid==\n{{main|Aid}}\n\n===Welfare===\n{{Main|Welfare's effect on poverty}}\nAid in its simplest form is a [[basic income grant]], a form of [[social security]] periodically providing citizens with money. In pilot projects in [[Namibia]], where such a program pays just $13 a month, people were able to pay tuition fees, raising the proportion of children going to school by 92%, child [[malnutrition]] rates fell from 42% to 10% and economic activity grew 10%.<ref name=\"Spiegel\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/a-new-approach-to-aid-how-a-basic-income-program-saved-a-namibian-village-a-642310.html|title=A New Approach to Aid: How a Basic Income Program Saved a Namibian Village|last=Krahe|first=Dialika|date=2009-08-10|work=Spiegel Online|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref><ref name=\"Namibians line up\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7415814.stm|title=Namibians line up for free cash|date=2008-05-23|access-date=2019-11-01|language=en-GB}}</ref> Aid could also be rewarded based on doing certain requirements.

Funding tends to be used in a selective manner where the highest ranked health problem is the only thing treated, rather than funding basic health care development. This can occur due to a foundation's underlying political aspects to their development plan, where the politics outweigh the science of disease. The diseases then treated are ranked by their prevalence, morbidity, risk of mortality, and the feasibility of control.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Julia A.|author2=Kenneth S.

The argument occurs because once these people are treated, they are sent back to the conditions that led to the disease in the first place. By doing this, money and resources from aid can be wasted when people are re-infected. This was seen in the Rockefeller Foundation's Hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s, where people were treated for hookworm and then contracted the disease again once back in the conditions from which they came. To prevent this, money could be spent on teaching citizens of the developing countries health education, basic sanitation, and providing adequate access to prevention methods and medical infrastructure. Not only would NGO money be better spent, but it would be more sustainable. These arguments suggest that the NGO development aid should be used for prevention and determining root causes rather acting upon political endeavours and treating for the sake of saying they helped.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Birn|first=Anne-Emanuelle|author2=Armando Sol\u00f3rzano|title=Public health policy paradoxes: science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s.|journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=49|issue=9|year=1999|page=1209|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(99)00160-4|pmid=10501641}}</ref>\n\nSome [[think tanks]] and NGOs have argued that Western monetary aid often only serves to increase poverty and social inequality, either because it is conditioned with the implementation of harmful economic policies in the recipient countries,<ref>[http://www.heritagekonpa.com/archives/Haiti;s%20rice%20farmers%20suffered%20since%20trade%20barrier%20in%201994.htm Haiti's rice farmers and poultry growers have suffered greatly since trade barriers were lowered in 1994.] By Jane Regan</ref> or because it is tied to the importing of products from the donor country over cheaper alternatives.<ref name=tiedaid/> Sometimes foreign aid is seen to be serving the interests of the donor more than the recipient,<ref>[http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp US and Foreign Aid], GlobalIssues.org</ref> and critics also argue that some of the foreign aid is stolen by corrupt governments and officials, and that higher aid levels erode the quality of governance.

Given that many less developed nations have gotten themselves into extensive debt to banks and governments from the rich nations, and given that the interest payments on these debts are often more than a country can generate per year in profits from exports, cancelling part or all of these debts may allow poor nations \"to get out of the hole\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldbank.org/|title=World Bank Group - International Development, Poverty, & Sustainability|website=World Bank|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> If poor countries do not have to spend so much on debt payments, they can use the money instead for priorities which help reduce poverty such as basic health-care and education.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4081220.stm|title=Q&A: African debt relief|date=2005-06-11|access-date=2019-11-01|language=en-GB}}</ref> Many nations began offering services, such as free health care even while overwhelming the health care infrastructure, because of savings that resulted from the rounds of debt relief in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4883062.stm|title= Zambia overwhelmed by free health care|publisher=BBC NEWS \u2013 Africa}}</ref>\n\n== The role of education and skillbuilding as precursors to economic development ==\n\n[[File:Working Together To End Poverty One Nail At A Time - 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.jpg|thumb|right|\"Working together to end poverty one nail at a time,\" T-shirt, 50th anniversary of the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]]]]\nUniversal public education has some role in preparing youth for basic academic skills and perhaps many trade skills, as well. Apprenticeships clearly build needed trade skills. If modest amounts of cash and land can be combined with a modicum of agricultural skills in a temperate climate, subsistence can give way toward modest societal wealth. As has been mentioned, education for women will allow for reduced family size\u2014an important poverty reduction event in its own right. While all components mentioned above are necessary, the portion of education pertaining to the variety of skills needed to build and maintain the infrastructure of a developing (moving out of poverty) society: building trades; plumbing; electrician; well-drilling; farm and transport mechanical skills (and others) are clearly needed in large numbers of individuals, if the society is to move out of poverty or subsistence. Yet, many well-developed western economies are moving strongly away from the essential apprenticeships and skill training which affords a clear vocational path out of modern urban poverty.\n\n===Microloans===\n\nOne of the most popular of the new technical tools for economic development and poverty reduction are microloans made famous in 1976 by the [[Grameen Bank]] in Bangladesh. The idea is to loan small amounts of money to farmers or villages so these people can obtain the things they need to increase their economic rewards. A small pump costing only $50 could make a very big difference in a village without the means of [[irrigation]]. A specific example is the Thai government's People's Bank which is making loans of $100 to $300 to help farmers buy equipment or seeds, help street vendors acquire an inventory to sell, or help others set up small shops. [[IFAD|The International Fund for Agricultural Development]] [[IFAD Vietnam|(IFAD) Vietnam]] country programme supports operations in 11 poor provinces. Between 2002 and 2010 around 1,000 saving and credit groups (SCGs) were formed, with over 17,000 members; these SCGs increased their access to [[microcredit]] for taking up small-scale farm activities.<ref>RIDP, PCR and Validation, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Empowering women==\n{{See also|Women's education and development}}\nThe [[empowerment]] of women has relatively recently become a significant area of discussion with respect to development and economics; however it is often regarded as a topic that only addresses and primarily deals with [[gender inequality]]. Because women and men experience poverty differently, they hold dissimilar poverty reduction priorities and are affected differently by development interventions and poverty reduction strategies.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Zuckerman, Elaine. 2002 \"Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and Gender\".

These \"hard states\" have the will and authority to create and maintain policies that lead to long-term development that helps all their citizens, not just the wealthy. Multinational corporations are regulated so that they follow reasonable standards for [[wage|pay]] and labor conditions, pay reasonable taxes to help develop the country, and keep some of the profits in the country, reinvesting them to provide further development.\n\nThe [[United Nations Development Program]] published a report in April 2000 which focused on good governance in poor countries as a key to economic development and overcoming the selfish interests of wealthy elites often behind state actions in developing nations. The report concludes that \"Without [[good governance]], reliance on [[trickle-down economics|trickle-down]] economic development and a host of other strategies will not work.\"<ref name=\"undp2000\">United Nations Development Report. 2000.

Ancient civilizations with more developed government organization before [[colonialism]], as well as elite responsibility, have helped create strong states with the means and efficiency to carry out development policies today. On the other hand, strong states are not always the form of political organization most conducive to economic development. Other historical factors, especially the experiences of colonialism for each country, have intervened to make a strong state and/or good governance less likely for some countries, especially in Africa. Another important factor that has been found to affect the quality of institutions and governance was the pattern of colonization (how it took place) and even the identity of colonizing power. International agencies may be able to promote good governance through various policies of intervention in developing nations as indicated in a few African countries, but comparative analysis suggests it may be much more difficult to achieve in most poor nations around the world.<ref name=\"kerbo\"/>\n\n==Other approaches==\nAnother approach that has been proposed for alleviating poverty is [[Fair Trade]] which advocates the payment of an above market price as well as social and environmental standards in areas related to the production of goods. The efficacy of this approach to poverty reduction is controversial.\n\nCommunity and monetary economist [[Thomas H. Greco, Jr.]] has argued that the mainstream [[international finance|global economy]] with its debt-based currency has built-in structural incentives that create poverty through keeping money scarce. Greco points to the success of modern [[barter]] clubs and historical local currencies such as the [[W\u00f6rgl Experiment]] at revitalizing stagnant local economies, and calls for the creation of [[community currency]] as a means to reduce or eliminate poverty.<ref>Thomas Greco, Jr., ''Money Understanding and Creating Alternatives to Legal Tender'', Chelsea Green Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|978-1-890132-37-8}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Toronto Dollar]] is an example of a [[local currency]] oriented towards reducing poverty. Toronto Dollars are sold and redeemed in such a way that raise funds which are then given as grants to local charities, primarily ones oriented towards reducing poverty.<ref name=\"milestone\">[https://www.thestar.com/printArticle/347455 Barbara Turnbull, \"Milestone for the `Toronto Dollar'\", ''Toronto Star'', 22 Mar. 2008.]</ref> Toronto Dollars also provide a means to create an [[incentive]] for welfare recipients to work: Toronto dollars can be given as gifts to welfare recipients who perform volunteer work for charitable and non-profit organizations, and these gifts do not affect welfare benefits.<ref>[http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/view/58941 Mark Herpel, \"The Toronto Dollar: Community Alternative Dollar\", ''California Chronicle'', 18 Apr. 2008.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716073246/http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/view/58941 |date=16 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nSome have argued for radical economic change in the system. There are several fundamental proposals for restructuring existing economic relations, and many of their supporters argue that their ideas would reduce or even eliminate poverty entirely if they were implemented. Such proposals have been put forward by both left-wing and right-wing groups: socialism, communism, [[anarchism]], [[libertarianism]], [[binary economics]] and [[participatory economics]], among others.\n\nInequality can be reduced by [[progressive tax]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diversity.berkeley.edu/6-policies-to-reduce-economic-inequality|title=Six policies to reduce economic inequality|accessdate=14 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn law, there has been a move to establish the absence of poverty as a [[human right]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/poverty/expert/docs/Thomas_Pogge_Summary.pdf|title=Poverty and Human Rights |author= Thomas Pogge|accessdate=14 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/poverty|title=Poverty and Human Rights  |publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=14 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe IMF and member countries have produced [[Poverty Reduction Strategy]] papers or PRSPs.<ref>[http://www.imf.org/external/np/prsp/prsp.asp Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP)]</ref>\n\nIn his book ''The End of Poverty'',<ref>[http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/endofpoverty/ ''The End of Poverty'']</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1034738,00.html The End of Poverty] by JEFFREY D.

Following his recommendations, international organizations such as the Global Solidarity Network<ref>[http://www.globalsolidaritynetwork.org Global Solidarity Network]</ref> are working to help eradicate poverty worldwide with intervention in the areas of housing, food, education, basic health, agricultural inputs, safe drinking water, transportation and communications.\n\nThe [[Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign]] is an organization in the United States working to secure freedom from poverty for all by organizing the poor themselves. The Campaign believes that a human rights framework, based on the value of inherent dignity and worth of all persons, offers the best means by which to organize for a political solution to poverty. \n\n===Climate change adaptation===\n{{main|Climate change and poverty}}\nThe increase in extreme weather events, linked to climate change, and resulting disasters is expected to continue.  Disasters are a major cause of impoverishment and can reverse progress towards poverty reduction.<ref name=ODI2013>Andrew Shepherd, Tom Mitchell, Kirsty Lewis, Amanda Lenhardt, Lindsey Jones, Lucy Scott and Robert Muir-Wood (2013) [http://www.odi.org/publications/7491-geography-poverty-disasters-climate-change-2030 \"The geography of poverty, disasters and climate extremes in 2030\"] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref>\n\nIt is predicted that by 2030, 325 million (plus) extremely poor people will be living in the 49 most hazard prone countries.

For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3\u201310 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate poverty in poor nations.\n\n===Millennium Development Goals ===\nEradication of [[extreme poverty]] and hunger by 2015 is one of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs). In addition to broader approaches, the [[Jeffrey Sachs|Sachs]] Report (for the UN Millennium Project)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/reports/|title=UN Millennium Project \u2013 Publications}}</ref> proposes a series of \"quick wins\", approaches identified by development experts which would cost relatively little but could have a major constructive effect on world poverty. The quick wins are:\n* Access to information on [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexual and reproductive health]].\n* Action against [[domestic violence]].\n* Appointing government scientific advisors in every country.\n* Deworming school children in affected areas.\n* Drugs for AIDS, [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]].\n* Eliminating [[tuition|school fees]].\n* Ending [[Fee-for-service|user fees]] for basic health care in [[Developing country|developing countries]].\n* [[Free school meal]]s for schoolchildren.\n* Legislation for [[women's rights]], including rights to property.\n* [[Planting trees]].\n* Providing [[fertilizer|soil nutrients]] to farmers in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].\n* Providing [[mosquito net]]s.\n* [[Rural electrification|Access to electricity]], water and [[sanitation]].\n* Supporting [[breast-feeding]].\n* Training programs for [[community health]] in rural areas.\n* Upgrading slums, and providing land for [[public housing]].\n\n=== Sustainable Development Goals ===\nThe first of the 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) calls for an end to poverty by 2030 and seeks to ensure social protection for the poor and supporting people affected by climate-related extreme events.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg1|title=Goal 1 .:.

If during those 10 years growth rates prevailed over the next 15 years,{{clarify|date=July 2019}} it is possible to decrease the rate of extreme poverty in the world to 4 per cent by 2030, assuming that growth will benefit all income groups of the population on an equal footing. However, if the growth rates over a longer period of 20 years, the rate of prevalent global poverty is likely to be about 6 per cent. In other words, the eradication of extreme poverty will require a significant change from its historical growth rates.\n\n===Poverty targeting===\nPoverty reduction requires governments to identify and reach out to extremely poor and help them out of poverty through sustainable measures. One such approach supported by many international donors is of targeted poverty reduction programmes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Costs and benefits of poverty targeting|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/more-accurate-poverty-targeting-strategy-more-expensive-it|author=James G.

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx|title=Outcome |publisher=Copenhagen Consensus Center}}</ref>\n\nThe main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the recently approved [[Sustainable Development Goals]].

It has many worked through viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world.\n\nAnother initiative focused on improving the hunger situation by improving nutrition is the Scaling up Nutrition movement (SUN). Started in 2010, this movement of people from governments, civil society, the United Nations, donors, businesses and researchers publishes a yearly progress report on the changes in their 57 partner countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scalingupnutrition.org/about|title=SUN communication materials}}</ref>\n\n=== Poverty reduction in Taiwan ===\nIn spite of the intensive reduction [[Strategy|strategies]] deployed in the previous two decades, poverty levels in several countries of the world has not been reduced.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chinn|first=Dennis|title=The University of Chicago Press Journals|journal=Rural Poverty and the Structure of Farm Household Income in Developing Countries: Evidence from Taiwan|volume=27|issue=2|pages=283\u2013301|jstor=1153441|year=1979|doi=10.1086/451093}}</ref> Recent research has demonstrated that the low wage levels of the needy families have risen gradually, although in some scenarios they have declined.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rajamann|title=Poverty inequality and economic growth: Rural Punjab|journal=Journal of Development Studies|volume=11}}</ref> While wage level is the main median pointer of welfare, such results  suggest that past poverty reduction procedures have not been precise.

According to the [[UNRISD]], increasing labour productivity appears to have a negative impact on job creation: in the 1960s, a 1% increase in output per worker was associated with a reduction in employment growth of 0.07%, by the first decade of this century the same productivity increase implies reduced employment growth by 0.54%.<ref name=ODI2/>\n\nIncreases in employment without increases in productivity leads to a rise in the number of \"[[working poor]]\", which is why some experts are now promoting the creation of \"quality\" and not \"quantity\" in labour market policies.<ref name=ODI2/> This approach does highlight how higher productivity has helped reduce poverty in East Asia, but the negative impact is beginning to show.<ref name=ODI2/> In [[Vietnam]], for example, employment growth has slowed while productivity growth has continued.<ref name=ODI2/> Furthermore, productivity increases do not always lead to increased wages, as can be seen in the US, where the gap between productivity and wages has been rising since the 1980s.<ref name=ODI2/> The ODI study showed that other sectors were just as important in reducing unemployment, as [[manufacturing]].<ref name=ODI2/> The [[services sector]] is most effective at translating productivity growth into employment growth.

The researchers estimated that using the varieties would bring about a total benefit of US$111 million for 30 years with consumers receiving 39% of the benefit and producers 61%. They expected the generated benefit would lift more than 0.7 million people (both producers and consumers) out of poverty.

With better water management, they can improve productivity and potentially move beyond subsistence-level farming. During the Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, for example, irrigation was a key factor in unlocking Asia's agricultural potential and reducing poverty. Between 1961 and 2002, the irrigated area almost doubled, as governments sought to achieve food security, improve public welfare and generate economic growth. In South Asia, cereal production rose by 137% from 1970 to 2007. This was achieved with only 3% more land.<ref>Mukherji, A.

One project its scientists worked on demonstrates the impact that improving water management in agriculture can have. The study, funded by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, initially upgraded and irrigated the irrigation system on the Walawe Left Bank, Sri Lanka, in 1997. In 2005, irrigation was extended to a further area. An analysis of the whole area was carried out in 2007 and 2008. This study found that access to irrigation provided families with opportunities to diversify their livelihood activities and potentially increase their incomes. For example, people with land could reliably grow rice or vegetables instead of working as labourers or relying on rainfall to water their crops. Those without land could benefit by working within new inland fisheries. Within the project's control area, 57% of households were below the poverty line in 2002 compared with 43% in 2007.<ref>[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/Landing_Pages/WIB8.aspx ''Water, poverty and equity''].

Poverty activist [[Paul Polak]] has based his career around doing both at once, creating companies that employ the poor while creating \"radically\" affordable goods. In his book ''Out of Poverty'' he argues that traditional poverty eradication strategies have been misguided and fail to address underlying problems. He lists \"Three Great Poverty Eradication Myths\": that we can donate people out of poverty, that national economic growth will end poverty, and that Big Business, operating as it does now, will end poverty.<ref>{{cite web|last=Polak|first=Paul|title=Out of Poverty|url=http://www.bkconnection.com/ProdDetails.asp?ID=9781605092768&PG=1&Type=BL&PCS=BKP}}</ref> Economic models which lead to national growth and more big business will not necessarily lead to more opportunities for self-sufficiency.

During their reform periods, all three have reduced their poverty rates, but through a different mix of approaches. The report used a common poverty line of $1.25 per person, per day, at purchasing parity power for consumption in 2008. Using that metric and evaluating the period between 1981 and 2005, the poverty rate in China dropped from 84% to 16%; India from 60% to 42%; and Brazil from 17% to 8%. The report sketches an overall scorecard of the countries on the two basic dimensions of pro-poor growth and pro-poor policy intervention: \"China clearly scores well on the pro-poor growth side of the card, but neither Brazil nor India do; in Brazil's case for lack of growth and in India's case for lack of poverty-reducing growth. Brazil scores well on the social policies side, but China and India do not; in China's case progress has been slow in implementing new social policies more relevant to the new market economy (despite historical advantages in this area, inherited from the past regime) and in India's case the bigger problems are the extent of capture of the many existing policies by non-poor groups and the weak capabilities of the state for delivering better basic public services.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/international/poverty-reduction-brazil-china-india/ |title = Comparative Perspective on Poverty Reduction in Brazil, China, and India |publisher=Journalist's Resource.org }}</ref>\n\n==Aid==\n{{main|Aid}}\n\n===Welfare===\n{{Main|Welfare's effect on poverty}}\nAid in its simplest form is a [[basic income grant]], a form of [[social security]] periodically providing citizens with money.

Funding tends to be used in a selective manner where the highest ranked health problem is the only thing treated, rather than funding basic health care development. This can occur due to a foundation's underlying political aspects to their development plan, where the politics outweigh the science of disease. The diseases then treated are ranked by their prevalence, morbidity, risk of mortality, and the feasibility of control.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Julia A.|author2=Kenneth S. Warren|title=Selective primary health care: An interim strategy for disease control in developing countries.|journal=Social Science & Medicine.

The argument occurs because once these people are treated, they are sent back to the conditions that led to the disease in the first place. By doing this, money and resources from aid can be wasted when people are re-infected. This was seen in the Rockefeller Foundation's Hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s, where people were treated for hookworm and then contracted the disease again once back in the conditions from which they came. To prevent this, money could be spent on teaching citizens of the developing countries health education, basic sanitation, and providing adequate access to prevention methods and medical infrastructure. Not only would NGO money be better spent, but it would be more sustainable. These arguments suggest that the NGO development aid should be used for prevention and determining root causes rather acting upon political endeavours and treating for the sake of saying they helped.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Birn|first=Anne-Emanuelle|author2=Armando Sol\u00f3rzano|title=Public health policy paradoxes: science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s.|journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=49|issue=9|year=1999|page=1209|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(99)00160-4|pmid=10501641}}</ref>\n\nSome [[think tanks]] and NGOs have argued that Western monetary aid often only serves to increase poverty and social inequality, either because it is conditioned with the implementation of harmful economic policies in the recipient countries,<ref>[http://www.heritagekonpa.com/archives/Haiti;s%20rice%20farmers%20suffered%20since%20trade%20barrier%20in%201994.htm Haiti's rice farmers and poultry growers have suffered greatly since trade barriers were lowered in 1994.] By Jane Regan</ref> or because it is tied to the importing of products from the donor country over cheaper alternatives.<ref name=tiedaid/> Sometimes foreign aid is seen to be serving the interests of the donor more than the recipient,<ref>[http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp US and Foreign Aid], GlobalIssues.org</ref> and critics also argue that some of the foreign aid is stolen by corrupt governments and officials, and that higher aid levels erode the quality of governance.

Given that many less developed nations have gotten themselves into extensive debt to banks and governments from the rich nations, and given that the interest payments on these debts are often more than a country can generate per year in profits from exports, cancelling part or all of these debts may allow poor nations \"to get out of the hole\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldbank.org/|title=World Bank Group - International Development, Poverty, & Sustainability|website=World Bank|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> If poor countries do not have to spend so much on debt payments, they can use the money instead for priorities which help reduce poverty such as basic health-care and education.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4081220.stm|title=Q&A: African debt relief|date=2005-06-11|access-date=2019-11-01|language=en-GB}}</ref> Many nations began offering services, such as free health care even while overwhelming the health care infrastructure, because of savings that resulted from the rounds of debt relief in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4883062.stm|title= Zambia overwhelmed by free health care|publisher=BBC NEWS \u2013 Africa}}</ref>\n\n== The role of education and skillbuilding as precursors to economic development ==\n\n[[File:Working Together To End Poverty One Nail At A Time - 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.jpg|thumb|right|\"Working together to end poverty one nail at a time,\" T-shirt, 50th anniversary of the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]]]]\nUniversal public education has some role in preparing youth for basic academic skills and perhaps many trade skills, as well. Apprenticeships clearly build needed trade skills. If modest amounts of cash and land can be combined with a modicum of agricultural skills in a temperate climate, subsistence can give way toward modest societal wealth. As has been mentioned, education for women will allow for reduced family size\u2014an important poverty reduction event in its own right. While all components mentioned above are necessary, the portion of education pertaining to the variety of skills needed to build and maintain the infrastructure of a developing (moving out of poverty) society: building trades; plumbing; electrician; well-drilling; farm and transport mechanical skills (and others) are clearly needed in large numbers of individuals, if the society is to move out of poverty or subsistence. Yet, many well-developed western economies are moving strongly away from the essential apprenticeships and skill training which affords a clear vocational path out of modern urban poverty.\n\n===Microloans===\n\nOne of the most popular of the new technical tools for economic development and poverty reduction are microloans made famous in 1976 by the [[Grameen Bank]] in Bangladesh. The idea is to loan small amounts of money to farmers or villages so these people can obtain the things they need to increase their economic rewards. A small pump costing only $50 could make a very big difference in a village without the means of [[irrigation]]. A specific example is the Thai government's People's Bank which is making loans of $100 to $300 to help farmers buy equipment or seeds, help street vendors acquire an inventory to sell, or help others set up small shops. [[IFAD|The International Fund for Agricultural Development]] [[IFAD Vietnam|(IFAD) Vietnam]] country programme supports operations in 11 poor provinces. Between 2002 and 2010 around 1,000 saving and credit groups (SCGs) were formed, with over 17,000 members; these SCGs increased their access to [[microcredit]] for taking up small-scale farm activities.<ref>RIDP, PCR and Validation, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Empowering women==\n{{See also|Women's education and development}}\nThe [[empowerment]] of women has relatively recently become a significant area of discussion with respect to development and economics; however it is often regarded as a topic that only addresses and primarily deals with [[gender inequality]]. Because women and men experience poverty differently, they hold dissimilar poverty reduction priorities and are affected differently by development interventions and poverty reduction strategies.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Zuckerman, Elaine. 2002 \"Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and Gender\". Berlin, Germany: Conference on Sustainable Poverty Reduction and PRSPs.</ref> In response to the socialized phenomenon known as the [[feminization of poverty]], policies aimed to reduce poverty have begun to address poor women separately from poor men.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In addition to engendering poverty and poverty interventions, a correlation between greater gender equality and greater poverty reduction and economic growth has been illustrated by research through the [[World Bank]], suggesting that promoting [[gender equality]] through empowerment of women is a qualitatively significant poverty reduction strategy.<ref>World Bank. 2001a \"Engendering Development: Through Gender Equality in Rights, Resources, and Voice\".

Encouraging more economic and political participation by women increases financial independence from and social investment in the government, both of which are critical to pulling society out of poverty.<ref>Narayan, Deepa and Nicholas Stern. 2002. \"Empowerment and Poverty Reduction: A Sourcebook\", pp. 1\u2013272.

These \"hard states\" have the will and authority to create and maintain policies that lead to long-term development that helps all their citizens, not just the wealthy. Multinational corporations are regulated so that they follow reasonable standards for [[wage|pay]] and labor conditions, pay reasonable taxes to help develop the country, and keep some of the profits in the country, reinvesting them to provide further development.\n\nThe [[United Nations Development Program]] published a report in April 2000 which focused on good governance in poor countries as a key to economic development and overcoming the selfish interests of wealthy elites often behind state actions in developing nations. The report concludes that \"Without [[good governance]], reliance on [[trickle-down economics|trickle-down]] economic development and a host of other strategies will not work.\"<ref name=\"undp2000\">United Nations Development Report. 2000.

Ancient civilizations with more developed government organization before [[colonialism]], as well as elite responsibility, have helped create strong states with the means and efficiency to carry out development policies today. On the other hand, strong states are not always the form of political organization most conducive to economic development. Other historical factors, especially the experiences of colonialism for each country, have intervened to make a strong state and/or good governance less likely for some countries, especially in Africa. Another important factor that has been found to affect the quality of institutions and governance was the pattern of colonization (how it took place) and even the identity of colonizing power. International agencies may be able to promote good governance through various policies of intervention in developing nations as indicated in a few African countries, but comparative analysis suggests it may be much more difficult to achieve in most poor nations around the world.<ref name=\"kerbo\"/>\n\n==Other approaches==\nAnother approach that has been proposed for alleviating poverty is [[Fair Trade]] which advocates the payment of an above market price as well as social and environmental standards in areas related to the production of goods. The efficacy of this approach to poverty reduction is controversial.\n\nCommunity and monetary economist [[Thomas H. Greco, Jr.]] has argued that the mainstream [[international finance|global economy]] with its debt-based currency has built-in structural incentives that create poverty through keeping money scarce. Greco points to the success of modern [[barter]] clubs and historical local currencies such as the [[W\u00f6rgl Experiment]] at revitalizing stagnant local economies, and calls for the creation of [[community currency]] as a means to reduce or eliminate poverty.<ref>Thomas Greco, Jr., ''Money Understanding and Creating Alternatives to Legal Tender'', Chelsea Green Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|978-1-890132-37-8}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Toronto Dollar]] is an example of a [[local currency]] oriented towards reducing poverty.

There are several fundamental proposals for restructuring existing economic relations, and many of their supporters argue that their ideas would reduce or even eliminate poverty entirely if they were implemented.

The bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate poverty in poor nations.\n\n===Millennium Development Goals ===\nEradication of [[extreme poverty]] and hunger by 2015 is one of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs). In addition to broader approaches, the [[Jeffrey Sachs|Sachs]] Report (for the UN Millennium Project)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/reports/|title=UN Millennium Project \u2013 Publications}}</ref> proposes a series of \"quick wins\", approaches identified by development experts which would cost relatively little but could have a major constructive effect on world poverty. The quick wins are:\n* Access to information on [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexual and reproductive health]].\n* Action against [[domestic violence]].\n* Appointing government scientific advisors in every country.\n* Deworming school children in affected areas.\n* Drugs for AIDS, [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]].\n* Eliminating [[tuition|school fees]].\n* Ending [[Fee-for-service|user fees]] for basic health care in [[Developing country|developing countries]].\n* [[Free school meal]]s for schoolchildren.\n* Legislation for [[women's rights]], including rights to property.\n* [[Planting trees]].\n* Providing [[fertilizer|soil nutrients]] to farmers in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].\n* Providing [[mosquito net]]s.\n* [[Rural electrification|Access to electricity]], water and [[sanitation]].\n* Supporting [[breast-feeding]].\n* Training programs for [[community health]] in rural areas.\n* Upgrading slums, and providing land for [[public housing]].\n\n=== Sustainable Development Goals ===\nThe first of the 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) calls for an end to poverty by 2030 and seeks to ensure social protection for the poor and supporting people affected by climate-related extreme events.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg1|title=Goal 1 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|accessdate=14 July 2017}}</ref> As the decade that began in 2002, the percentage of the world's population living under the poverty line by half, from 26 per cent to 13 per cent. If during those 10 years growth rates prevailed over the next 15 years,{{clarify|date=July 2019}} it is possible to decrease the rate of extreme poverty in the world to 4 per cent by 2030, assuming that growth will benefit all income groups of the population on an equal footing. However, if the growth rates over a longer period of 20 years, the rate of prevalent global poverty is likely to be about 6 per cent. In other words, the eradication of extreme poverty will require a significant change from its historical growth rates.\n\n===Poverty targeting===\nPoverty reduction requires governments to identify and reach out to extremely poor and help them out of poverty through sustainable measures. One such approach supported by many international donors is of targeted poverty reduction programmes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Costs and benefits of poverty targeting|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/more-accurate-poverty-targeting-strategy-more-expensive-it|author=James G. Bennett|work=D+C, development and cooperation |date=10 October 2018 |accessdate=5 February 2019}}</ref> There are several poverty targeting methods through which poor communities are identified and tracked for poverty reduction programmes. For instance, one common method of poverty targeting is 'means testing' that uses a certain income or expenditure threshold for an individual or the a household to be considered as poor and eligible for support.<ref>{{cite news |title=Six main methodologies|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/how-identify-poor-people-provision-support|author=James G.

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx|title=Outcome |publisher=Copenhagen Consensus Center}}</ref>\n\nThe main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the recently approved [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. In particular Goal 2: Zero Hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/|title=Hunger and food security |publisher=United Nations Sustainable Development}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 Caritas International started a Caritas-wide initiative aimed at ending systemic hunger by 2025. The One human family, food for all campaign focuses on awareness raising, improving the impact of Caritas programs and advocating the implementation of the right to food.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caritas.org/2013/12/pope-francis-denounces-global-scandal-hunger/|title=Pope Francis denounces 'global scandal' of hunger|date=9 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe partnership Compact2025, led by [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]] with the involvement of UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.compact2025.org/about-compact2025/governance/leadership-council/|title=Leadership Council}}</ref> develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ifpri.org/publication/compact-2025-ending-hunger-and-undernutrition|title=Compact2025: Ending hunger and undernutrition |publisher=IFPRI}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations#Online campaign against hunger|EndingHunger]] campaign is an online communication campaign aimed at raising awareness of the hunger problem. It has many worked through viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world.\n\nAnother initiative focused on improving the hunger situation by improving nutrition is the Scaling up Nutrition movement (SUN). Started in 2010, this movement of people from governments, civil society, the United Nations, donors, businesses and researchers publishes a yearly progress report on the changes in their 57 partner countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scalingupnutrition.org/about|title=SUN communication materials}}</ref>\n\n=== Poverty reduction in Taiwan ===\nIn spite of the intensive reduction [[Strategy|strategies]] deployed in the previous two decades, poverty levels in several countries of the world has not been reduced.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chinn|first=Dennis|title=The University of Chicago Press Journals|journal=Rural Poverty and the Structure of Farm Household Income in Developing Countries: Evidence from Taiwan|volume=27|issue=2|pages=283\u2013301|jstor=1153441|year=1979|doi=10.1086/451093}}</ref> Recent research has demonstrated that the low wage levels of the needy families have risen gradually, although in some scenarios they have declined.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rajamann|title=Poverty inequality and economic growth: Rural Punjab|journal=Journal of Development Studies|volume=11}}</ref> While wage level is the main median pointer of welfare, such results  suggest that past poverty reduction procedures have not been precise.

Families are determined to be low-pay if their monthly income does not surpass the evaluated monthly minimum set by every city or region. To meet the family's essential needs (shelter, food, clothing, and education) in [[Taipei]], one would need to have $337 every month.
