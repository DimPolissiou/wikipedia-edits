{"title_page": "Resource Public Key Infrastructure", "text_new": "'''Resource Public Key Infrastructure''' ('''RPKI'''), also known as '''Resource Certification''', is a specialized [[public key infrastructure]] (PKI) framework designed to secure the [[Internet]]'s [[routing]] infrastructure.\n\nRPKI provides a way to connect Internet number resource information (such as [[Autonomous System (Internet)|Autonomous System]] numbers and [[IP address]]es) to a [[trust anchor]]. The certificate structure mirrors the way in which [[Internet number]] resources are distributed. That is, resources are initially distributed by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] to the [[regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]] (RIRs), who in turn distribute them to [[local Internet registry|local Internet registries]] (LIRs), who then distribute the resources to their customers. RPKI can be used by the legitimate holders of the resources to control the operation of Internet [[routing protocol]]s to prevent [[route hijacking]] and other attacks. In particular, RPKI is used to secure the [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP) through BGP Route Origin Validation (ROV), as well as [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol]] (ND) for [[IPv6]] through the [[Secure Neighbor Discovery]] protocol (SEND).\n\nThe RPKI architecture is documented in RFC 6480.  The RPKI specification is documented in a spread out series of RFCs: RFC 6481, RFC 6482, RFC 6483, RFC 6484, RFC 6485, RFC 6486, RFC 6487, RFC 6488, RFC 6489, RFC 6490, RFC 6491, RFC 6492, and RFC 6493. SEND is documented in RFC 6494 and RFC 6495.  These RFCs are a product of the [[IETF]]'s sidr working group,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/sidr/charter/|title=Secure Inter-Domain Routing (sidr) |website=datatracker.ietf.org}}</ref> and are based on a threat analysis which was documented in RFC 4593. These standards cover BGP origin validation, while work on path validation (BGPSEC)<ref>[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-reqs-01 Security Requirements for BGP Path Validation], S. Bellovin, R. Bush, D. Ward, October 19, 2011</ref> is underway. Several implementations for prefix origin validation already exist.<ref>[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7128 Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Router Implementation Report (RFC 7128)], R. Bush, R. Austein, K. Patel, H. Gredler, M. Waehlisch, February, 2014</ref>\n\n== Resource Certificates and child objects ==\nRPKI uses [[X.509]] PKI certificates (RFC 5280) with extensions for IP addresses and AS identifiers (RFC 3779). It allows the members of [[regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]], known as [[local Internet registry|local Internet registries]] (LIRs), to obtain a resource certificate listing the [[Internet number]] resources they hold. This offers them validatable proof of holdership, though the certificate does not contain identity information. Using the resource certificate, LIRs can create cryptographic attestations about the route announcements they authorise to be made with the prefixes they hold. These attestations, called Route Origination Authorizations<ref>[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sidr-roa-format-12 A Profile for Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs)], M. Lepinski, S. Kent, D. Kong, May 9, 2011</ref> (ROAs), are described below.\n\n=== Route Origination Authorizations ===\nA [[Route Origination Authorization]] states which [[Autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]] (AS) is authorised to originate certain [[IP prefix]]es. In addition, it can determine the maximum length of the prefix that the AS is authorised to advertise.\n\n==== Maximum prefix length ====\nThe maximum prefix length is an optional field. When not defined, the AS is only authorised to advertise exactly the prefix specified. Any more specific announcement of the prefix will be considered invalid. This is a way to enforce aggregation and prevent hijacking through the announcement of a more specific prefix.\n\nWhen present, this specifies the length of the most specific IP prefix that the AS is authorised to advertise. For example, if the IP address prefix is <tt>10.0.0.0/16</tt> and the maximum length is 22, the AS is authorised to advertise any prefix under {{mono|10.0.0.0/16}}, as long as it is no more specific than <tt>/22</tt>. So, in this example, the AS would be authorised to advertise <tt>10.0.0.0/16</tt>, <tt>10.0.128.0/20</tt> or <tt>10.0.252.0/22</tt>, but not <tt>10.0.255.0/24</tt>.\n\n==== RPKI route announcement validity ====\nWhen a ROA is created for a certain combination of origin AS and prefix, this will have an effect on the RPKI validity<ref>[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6483 Validation of Route Origination using the Resource Certificate PKI and ROAs], G. Huston, G. Michaelson, November 11, 2010</ref> of one or more route announcements. They can be:\n\n* '''VALID'''\n** The route announcement is covered by at least one ROA\n* '''INVALID'''\n** The prefix is announced from an unauthorised AS. This means:\n*** There is a ROA for this prefix for another AS, but no ROA authorising this AS; or\n*** This could be a hijacking attempt\n** The announcement is more specific than is allowed by the maximum length set in a ROA that matches the prefix and AS\n* '''UNKNOWN'''\n** The prefix in this announcement is not covered (or only partially covered) by an existing ROA\n\nNote that invalid BGP updates may also be due to incorrectly configured ROAs.<ref>M.

In addition, the RIRs have a hosted RPKI platform available in their member portals. This allows LIRs to choose to rely on a hosted system, or run their own software.\n\n== Publication ==\nThe system does not use a single repository publication point to publish RPKI objects. Instead, the RPKI repository system consists of multiple repository publication points. Each repository publication point is associated with one or more RPKI certificates' publication points. In practice this means that when running a certificate authority, an LIR can either publish all cryptographic material themselves, or they can rely on a third party for publication. When an LIR chooses to use the hosted system provided by the RIR, in principle publication is done in the RIR repository.\n\n== Validation ==\nRelying parties run local RPKI validation tools, which are pointed at the different RPKI trust anchors and using [[rsync]] gather all cryptographic objects from the different repositories used for publication. This creates a local validated cache which can be used for making BGP routing decisions.\n\n== Routing decisions ==\nAfter validation of ROAs, the attestations can be compared to BGP routing and aid network operators in their decision making process. This can be done manually, but the validated prefix origin data can also be sent to a supported router using the RPKI to Router Protocol (RFC 6810),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6810/|title=RFC 6810 - The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to Router Protocol|website=datatracker.ietf.org}}</ref> [[Cisco Systems]] offers native support on many platforms<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ripe.net/lir-services/resource-management/certification/router-configuration#Cisco|title=RPKI Configuration with Cisco IOS|work=[[RIPE]]}}</ref> for fetching the RPKI data set and using it in the router configuration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_bgp/command/irg-cr-book/bgp-m1.html|title=Cisco IOS IP Routing: BGP Command Reference - BGP Commands: M through N [Support]|website=Cisco}}</ref> Juniper offers support on all platforms<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos12.2/topics/topic-map/bgp-origin-as-validation.html|title=Example: Configuring Origin Validation for BGP - Technical Documentation - Support - Juniper Networks|website=www.juniper.net}}</ref> that run version 12.2 or newer.

Astyages then asked his [[Magi]] (priests) for their advice about the fate of Cyrus. They told him that the boy, who had been discovered while playing [[King of the Hill (game)|king of the mountain]] with his friends, had fulfilled the prophecy of becoming a king, albeit in play, and was no longer a danger. On their advice, Astyages sent Cyrus to his parents, [[Cambyses I]] and Mandane, in [[Anshan (Persia)|An\u0161an]] (southwestern [[Iran]] near [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]]).\n\nHarpagus bided his time, sending gifts to Cyrus to keep contact with him, as he worked to turn the nobles of Media against Astyages.

It is owned by Connecticut Public Broadcasting Network, which also owns [[Connecticut Public Television]].\n\nThe radio network airs primarily news and talk from NPR along with several locally produced programs. It is headquartered with CPTV in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], and operates an additional studio in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:CPTV and WNPR building in Hartford, Connecticut, 2009-09-02.jpg|thumb|180px|The headquarters of WNPR and CPTV in Hartford, Connecticut]]\n\nIn the early 1970s, [[WTIC (AM)|WTIC]] in Hartford dropped its longtime [[classical music]] format in favor of [[adult contemporary]] music, and sold its library to CPTV. Looking for a way to put the library to use, CPTV decided to get into radio. At the time, while Hartford got a fairly decent signal from [[WFCR]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]] and much of southwestern Connecticut was covered by [[WNYC|WNYC-AM-FM]] in [[New York City]], most of the rest of the state did not even get a grade B signal from an NPR station. New Haven, for instance, had to content itself with a translator of WFCR on 90.5 FM. Finding available frequencies proved difficult, however. In addition to the crowded state of the noncommercial end of the FM dial in the Northeast, there was a considerable glut of 10-watt stations in the state. Ultimately, CPTV bought the 90.5 frequency from the Friends of WFCR, the New Haven group that owned the WFCR translator, and used it as the linchpin for what would become Connecticut Public Radio.<ref name=CTMag>{{cite news|url=http://www.connecticutmag.com/Connecticut-Magazine/April-2013/CPTV-Celebrates-50-Years-Present-at-the-Creation |title=CPTV Celebrates 50 Years: Present at the Creation|last=Grandjean|first=Pat|work=[[Connecticut Magazine]] |date=April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe network's first station, '''WPBH''',<ref name=\"fccMeriden\" /> signed on in June 1978.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History |url=http://www.cpbn.org/our-history |publisher=Connecticut Public Broadcasting Network |accessdate=May 2, 2013}}</ref> The station was licensed to [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]], halfway between Hartford and New Haven, in order to serve both cities (Hartford and New Haven, then as now, are separate radio markets).  CPBI originally wanted the WNPR calls, but the FCC turned it down due to objections from [[WPLR]] in New Haven, who claimed the calls sounded too similar. It became '''WPKT''' in 1984<ref name=\"fccMeriden\" /> after board chairman Homer Babbidge requested the FCC change the call letters to honor CPBN head Paul K. Taff.\n\n'''WNPR''' (89.1 FM) in Norwich followed in 1981,<ref name=\"fccNorwich\" /> '''WEDW-FM''' (88.5 FM) in Stamford in 1985<ref name=\"fccStamford\" /> and '''WRLI-FM''' (91.3 FM) on Long Island in 1993.<ref name=\"fccLI\" />\n\nOn September 15, 2011, '''WPKT''' and '''WNPR''' swapped callsigns.<ref name=\"fccMeriden\" /><ref name=\"fccNorwich\" /> Although 90.5 FM has always been the [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]], the network had been using WNPR as its on-air name since the 1990s.\n\nFor the first 20 years of its existence, the network broadcast a mix of classical music, jazz and NPR talk. However, starting in the late 1990s, WNPR began gradually increasing the news programming on its schedule. One of the first casualties of this change was the popular classical music program ''[[Morning pro musica]],'' which was fed from [[WGBH-FM]] in [[Boston]]. The program had aired on WNPR as part of the terms by which the Friends of WFCR sold the 90.5 frequency to CPBI. However, by the late 1990s, this resulted in WNPR only being able to run the first hour of ''[[Morning Edition]].'' Ultimately, WNPR decided to cancel ''Morning pro musica,'' even though network executives knew it would cause a major loss in funding, though the change of direction in news-heavy NPR member stations, especially after the [[September 11 attacks]] occurred, made the format change palatable.<ref name=CTMag/> Ultimately, in 2006, WNPR dropped classical music altogether in favor of a full-time news and information format. In 2013, the station launched a new online service, WNPR News.\n\n=== WAIC ===\n{{main|WAIC}}\nFrom 2011 to 2016, Connecticut Public Radio operated WAIC (91.9 FM), the college radio station of [[American International College]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. WAIC first went on air in February 1967, going stereo in 1985.  Initially programmed from American International College (at various points programming [[top 40]] and [[adult hits]]), it became a full-time relay of Connecticut Public Radio on November 1, 2011.<ref name=\"wnpr-wnpronwaic\">{{cite press release|title=WAIC and WNPR Launch Collaboration to Bring New Programming to the Springfield Market|publisher=Connecticut Public Broadcasting|date=November 1, 2011|url=http://www.cpbn.org/waic-and-wnpr-launch-collaboration-bring-new-programming-springfield-market|accessdate=November 2, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331220659/http://www.cpbn.org/waic-and-wnpr-launch-collaboration-bring-new-programming-springfield-market|archivedate=March 31, 2012}}</ref> This ended in 2016, when WNPR turned over operation of WAIC to [[WFCR]], the NPR member for Western Massachusetts.

All are based out of Hartford except ''The Faith Middleton Show'', which has been based at the New Haven studio since it first went on the air.

The documentary was released in late 2018 to coincide with the one year mark since the storm ravaged Puerto Rico.\n\n== Awards ==\nWNPR has received many awards over the past few decades. It has received two [[Peabody Award|George Foster Peabody Awards]], five Ohio State Awards and two [[Gracie Awards|Gracie Allen Awards.]] It has also gotten over 60 [[Associated Press]] Awards, which include eight [[Mark Twain Readers Award|Mark Twain Awards]] for Overall Station Excellence. \n\n[[Faith Middleton]] has been voted Best Radio Talk-Show Host by ''[[Connecticut Magazine]]'' readers for the past 10 years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ctpublic.org/honors-awards-for-cpbn/|title=Honors & Awards for CPBN \u00b7 Connecticut Public|publisher=Connecticut Public|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Stations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

[[western Massachusetts]], and [[East End (Long Island)|eastern Long Island]], affiliated with [[NPR]] (National Public Radio). It is owned by Connecticut Public Broadcasting Network, which also owns [[Connecticut Public Television]].\n\nThe radio network airs primarily news and talk from NPR along with several locally produced programs. It is headquartered with CPTV in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], and operates an additional studio in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:CPTV and WNPR building in Hartford, Connecticut, 2009-09-02.jpg|thumb|180px|The headquarters of WNPR and CPTV in Hartford, Connecticut]]\n\nIn the early 1970s, [[WTIC (AM)|WTIC]] in Hartford dropped its longtime [[classical music]] format in favor of [[adult contemporary]] music, and sold its library to CPTV. Looking for a way to put the library to use, CPTV decided to get into radio. At the time, while Hartford got a fairly decent signal from [[WFCR]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]] and much of southwestern Connecticut was covered by [[WNYC|WNYC-AM-FM]] in [[New York City]], most of the rest of the state did not even get a grade B signal from an NPR station. New Haven, for instance, had to content itself with a translator of WFCR on 90.5 FM. Finding available frequencies proved difficult, however. In addition to the crowded state of the noncommercial end of the FM dial in the Northeast, there was a considerable glut of 10-watt stations in the state. Ultimately, CPTV bought the 90.5 frequency from the Friends of WFCR, the New Haven group that owned the WFCR translator, and used it as the linchpin for what would become Connecticut Public Radio.<ref name=CTMag>{{cite news|url=http://www.connecticutmag.com/Connecticut-Magazine/April-2013/CPTV-Celebrates-50-Years-Present-at-the-Creation |title=CPTV Celebrates 50 Years: Present at the Creation|last=Grandjean|first=Pat|work=[[Connecticut Magazine]] |date=April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe network's first station, '''WPBH''',<ref name=\"fccMeriden\" /> signed on in June 1978.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History |url=http://www.cpbn.org/our-history |publisher=Connecticut Public Broadcasting Network |accessdate=May 2, 2013}}</ref> The station was licensed to [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]], halfway between Hartford and New Haven, in order to serve both cities (Hartford and New Haven, then as now, are separate radio markets).  CPBI originally wanted the WNPR calls, but the FCC turned it down due to objections from [[WPLR]] in New Haven, who claimed the calls sounded too similar. It became '''WPKT''' in 1984<ref name=\"fccMeriden\" /> after board chairman Homer Babbidge requested the FCC change the call letters to honor CPBN head Paul K. Taff.\n\n'''WNPR''' (89.1 FM) in Norwich followed in 1981,<ref name=\"fccNorwich\" /> '''WEDW-FM''' (88.5 FM) in Stamford in 1985<ref name=\"fccStamford\" /> and '''WRLI-FM''' (91.3 FM) on Long Island in 1993.<ref name=\"fccLI\" />\n\nOn September 15, 2011, '''WPKT''' and '''WNPR''' swapped callsigns.<ref name=\"fccMeriden\" /><ref name=\"fccNorwich\" /> Although 90.5 FM has always been the [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]], the network had been using WNPR as its on-air name since the 1990s.\n\nFor the first 20 years of its existence, the network broadcast a mix of classical music, jazz and NPR talk. However, starting in the late 1990s, WNPR began gradually increasing the news programming on its schedule. One of the first casualties of this change was the popular classical music program ''[[Morning pro musica]],'' which was fed from [[WGBH-FM]] in [[Boston]]. The program had aired on WNPR as part of the terms by which the Friends of WFCR sold the 90.5 frequency to CPBI. However, by the late 1990s, this resulted in WNPR only being able to run the first hour of ''[[Morning Edition]].'' Ultimately, WNPR decided to cancel ''Morning pro musica,'' even though network executives knew it would cause a major loss in funding, though the change of direction in news-heavy NPR member stations, especially after the [[September 11 attacks]] occurred, made the format change palatable.<ref name=CTMag/> Ultimately, in 2006, WNPR dropped classical music altogether in favor of a full-time news and information format. In 2013, the station launched a new online service, WNPR News.\n\n=== WAIC ===\n{{main|WAIC}}\nFrom 2011 to 2016, Connecticut Public Radio operated WAIC (91.9 FM), the college radio station of [[American International College]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. WAIC first went on air in February 1967, going stereo in 1985.  Initially programmed from American International College (at various points programming [[top 40]] and [[adult hits]]), it became a full-time relay of Connecticut Public Radio on November 1, 2011.<ref name=\"wnpr-wnpronwaic\">{{cite press release|title=WAIC and WNPR Launch Collaboration to Bring New Programming to the Springfield Market|publisher=Connecticut Public Broadcasting|date=November 1, 2011|url=http://www.cpbn.org/waic-and-wnpr-launch-collaboration-bring-new-programming-springfield-market|accessdate=November 2, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331220659/http://www.cpbn.org/waic-and-wnpr-launch-collaboration-bring-new-programming-springfield-market|archivedate=March 31, 2012}}</ref> This ended in 2016, when WNPR turned over operation of WAIC to [[WFCR]], the NPR member for Western Massachusetts.

The documentary was released in late 2018 to coincide with the one year mark since the storm ravaged Puerto Rico.\n\n== Awards ==\nWNPR has received many awards over the past few decades. It has received two [[Peabody Award|George Foster Peabody Awards]], five Ohio State Awards and two [[Gracie Awards|Gracie Allen Awards.]] It has also gotten over 60 [[Associated Press]] Awards, which include eight [[Mark Twain Readers Award|Mark Twain Awards]] for Overall Station Excellence. \n\n[[Faith Middleton]] has been voted Best Radio Talk-Show Host by ''[[Connecticut Magazine]]'' readers for the past 10 years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ctpublic.org/honors-awards-for-cpbn/|title=Honors & Awards for CPBN \u00b7 Connecticut Public|publisher=Connecticut Public|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Stations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Registration interfaces were first defined in the ''Universal Service Ordering Code'' (USOC) system of the [[Bell System]] in the United States for complying with the registration program for customer-supplied telephone equipment mandated by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in the 1970s.<ref>AT&T, ''Registration Interface\u2014Selection and General Information, Bell System Practices, Section 463-400-100 Issue 1, May 1976</ref> They were subsequently codified in title 47 of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] Part 68.<ref name=FCC47Part68 /><ref name=T1.TR5-1999 /><ref name=ACTAdocs />\n\nThe specification includes physical construction, wiring, and signal semantics. Accordingly, registered jacks are primarily named by the letters ''RJ'', followed by two digits that express the type. Additional letter suffixes indicate minor variations. For example, '''RJ11''', '''RJ14''', and '''RJ25''' are the most commonly used interfaces for telephone connections for one-, two-, and three-line service, respectively. Although these standards are legal definitions in the United States, some interfaces are used worldwide.\n\nThe connectors used for registered jack installations are primarily the [[modular connector]] and the 50-pin [[micro ribbon connector|miniature ribbon connector]]. For example, RJ11 uses a six-position two-conductor connector ([[6P2C]]), RJ14 uses a six-position four-conductor ([[6P4C]]) modular jack, while RJ21 uses a 25-pair (50-pin) miniature ribbon connector.\n\n==Naming standard==\nThe registered jack designations originated in the standardization processes in the Bell System in the United States, and describe application circuits and not just the physical geometry of the connectors; inspection of the connector does not necessarily show which registered jack wiring is used. The same modular connector type may be used for different registered jack applications.\n\nStrictly, ''Registered Jack'' refers to both the female physical connector ([[modular connector]]) and its wiring, but the term is often used loosely to refer to modular connectors regardless of wiring or gender, such as in [[Ethernet over twisted pair]]. There is much confusion over these connection standards. The same six-position plug and jack commonly used for telephone line connections may be used for RJ11, RJ14 or even RJ25, all of which are names of interface standards that use this physical connector. The RJ11 standard dictates a single wire pair connection, while RJ14 is a configuration for two lines, and RJ25 uses all six wires for three telephones lines. The RJ designations, though, only pertain to the wiring of the jack, hence the name ''Registered Jack''; it is commonplace, but not strictly correct, to refer to an unwired plug by any of these names.\n\nModular connectors were developed to replace older telephone installation methods that used either hardwired cords, or bulkier varieties of [[telephone plug]]s. The common nomenclature for modular connectors includes the number of contact positions and the number of wires connected, for example ''6P'' indicates a six-position modular plug or jack. A six-position modular plug with conductors in the middle two positions and the other four positions unused has the designation 6P2C. RJ11 uses a 6P2C connector. The connectors could be supplied with more pins, but if more pins are actually wired, the interface is not an RJ11.\n\n==History and authority==\nRegistration interfaces were created by the Bell System under a 1976 [[Federal Communications Commission]] order for the standard [[interconnection]] between telephone company equipment and [[customer premises equipment]]. These interfaces used newly standardized jacks and plugs, primarily based on miniature [[modular connector]]s.\n\nThe wired communications provider (telephone company) is responsible for delivery of services to a minimum (or main) point of entry ([[MPOE]]). The MPOE is a utility box, usually containing surge protective circuitry, which connects the wiring on the customer's property to the communication provider's network. Customers are responsible for all jacks, wiring, and equipment on their side of the MPOE. The intent was to establish a universal standard for wiring and interfaces, and to separate ownership of in-home (or in-office) telephone wiring from the wiring owned by the service provider.\n\nIn the [[Bell System]], following the [[Communications Act of 1934]], the telephone companies owned all telecommunications equipment and they did not allow [[interconnection]] of third-party equipment.  Telephones were generally hardwired, but may have been installed with Bell System connectors to permit portability. The legal case ''[[Hush-A-Phone v. United States]]'' (1956) and the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) ''[[Carterfone]]'' (1968) decision brought changes to this policy, and required the Bell System to allow some interconnection, culminating in the development of registered interfaces using new types of miniature connectors.\n\nRegistered jacks replaced the use of protective couplers provided exclusively by the telephone company. The new modular connectors were much smaller and cheaper to produce than the earlier, bulkier connectors that were used in the Bell System since the 1930s. The Bell System issued specifications for the modular connectors and their wiring as ''Universal Service Order Codes'' (USOC), which were the only standards at the time. Large customers of telephone services commonly use the USOC to specify the interconnection type and, when necessary, pin-assignments, when placing service orders with a network provider.\n\nWhen the U.S. telephone industry was reformed to foster competition in the 1980s, the connection specifications became federal law, ordered by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] and codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), [[Title 47 CFR Part 68]], Subpart F,<ref name=FCC47Part68>[http://www.tscm.com/FCC47CFRpart68.pdf FCC 47 CFR Part 68 ''Connection of Terminal Equipment to the Telephone Network''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705131407/http://www.tscm.com/FCC47CFRpart68.pdf |date=2017-07-05 }}, Section 68.502 superseded by T1.TR5-1999</ref> superseded by T1.TR5-1999.<ref name=T1.TR5-1999 />\n\nIn January 2001, the FCC delegated responsibility for standardizing connections to the telephone network to a new private industry organization, the [[Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments]] (ACTA).<ref name=ACTAdocs>{{cite web|url=http://www.part68.org/documents.aspx|title=ACTA Documents Main - Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments|website=www.part68.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110055347/http://www.part68.org/documents.aspx|archivedate=10 November 2010}}</ref> For this delegation, the FCC removed Subpart F from the CFR and added Subpart G.

This is a modular connector wired for one telephone line, using the center two contacts of six available positions. This configuration is also used for single-line telephones in many countries other than the United States. It may also use a 6P4C connector, to use an additional wire pair for powering lamps on the telephone set. RJ14 is similar to RJ11, but is wired for two lines and RJ25 has three lines. RJ61 is a similar registered jack for four lines, but uses an 8P8C connector.\n\nThe RJ45(S) jack is rarely used.\n\nThe officially recognized types of registered jacks are listed in the following table:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

A cord can be plugged into an RJ11W as well.\n\n==RJ11, RJ14, RJ25 wiring {{anchor|RJ11|RJ14|RJ25}} ==<!-- Redirect target for [[RJ11]], [[RJ14]], [[RJ25]] -->\n[[File:Rj25 connector.jpg|thumb|6P6C connector showing the location of pin 1]]\n\nAll of these registered jacks are described as containing a number of potential [[Electrical connector|contact]] positions and the actual number of contacts installed within these positions. RJ11, RJ14, and RJ25 all use the same six-position [[modular connector]], thus are physically identical except for the different number of contacts (two, four and six respectively) allowing connections for one, two, or three telephone lines respectively.\n\nCords connecting to an RJ11 interface require a 6P2C connector. Nevertheless, cords sold as RJ11 often use 6P4C connectors (six position, four conductor) with four wires. Two of the six possible contact positions connect tip and ring, and the other two conductors are unused.\n\nThe conductors other than the two central tip and ring conductors are in practice variously used for a second or third telephone line, a [[Ground (electricity)|ground]] for [[Party line (telephony)|selective ringers]], low-voltage power for a [[Rotary dial|dial]] light, or for anti-tinkle circuitry to prevent [[pulse dialing]] phones from sounding the bell on other extensions.\n\n===Pinout===\nObserving the male connector from the cable opening, with prong facing downward, the pins are numbered 1\u20136, left to right:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!

It is used to implement [[telecommunication connection|connections]] for up to 25 [[telephone line|lines]], or circuits that require many wire pairs, such as used in the [[1A2 Key System|1A2 key telephone system]]. The [[miniature ribbon connector]] of this interface is also known as a 50-pin telco connector, CHAMP(AMP), or ''Amphenol'' connector, the latter being a [[genericized trademark]], as [[Amphenol]] was a prominent [[manufacturer]] of these at one time.\n\nA cable color scheme, known as [[even-count color code]], is determined for 25 pairs of conductors as follows:<ref>{{cite book |last=Ogletree |first=Terry William |title=Upgrading and Repairing Networks |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHXeT01OSXcC&pg=PA84 |year=2004 |edition=4 |publisher=Que Publishing |isbn=0-7897-2817-6 |page=84 |chapter=Cables, Connectors, Concentrators, and Other Network Components |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626201456/http://books.google.com/books?id=ZHXeT01OSXcC&pg=PA84 |archivedate=2014-06-26 }}</ref> For each ring, the primary, more prominent color is chosen from the set blue, orange, green, brown, and slate, in that order, and the secondary, thinner stripe color from the set of white, red, black, yellow, and violet colors, in that order. The tip conductor color scheme uses the same colors as the matching ring but switches the thickness of the primary and secondary colored stripes. Since the sets are ordered, an orange (color 2 in its set) with a yellow (color 4) is the color scheme for the 4\u00b75 + 2 \u2212 5 = 17th pair of wires. If the yellow is the more prominent, thicker stripe, then the wire is a tip conductor connecting to the pin numbered 25 + the pair #, which is pin 42 in this case. Ring conductors connect to the same pin number as the pair number.\n\nA conventional enumeration of wire color pairs then begins blue (and white), orange (and white), green (and white) and brown (and white), which subsumes a color-coding convention used in cables of 4 or fewer pairs (8 wires or less) with 8P and 6P connectors.\n\nDual 50-pin ribbon connectors are often used on [[punch block]]s to create a [[breakout box]] for [[private branch exchange]] (PBX) and other [[key telephone system]]s.\n{{clear}}\n\n==RJ45S==\n[[File:RJ45 female connector.jpg|thumb|8P8C keyed female connector (jack).]]\nThe RJ45S, a standard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leviton.com/en/support/product-support/network-solutions/wiring-diagrams/usoc-codes|title=Wiring Diagrams|author=|date=|website=www.leviton.com|accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref> jack once specified for modem or data interfaces, uses a mechanically-keyed variation of the 8P8C body with an extra tab that prevents it from mating with other connectors; the visual difference from the more-common 8P8C is subtle.

It uses the eight-position [[modular connector]] (8P8C).\n\nRJ48C is commonly used for [[Digital Signal 1|T1]] circuits and uses pin numbers 1, 2, 4 and 5.\n\nRJ48X is a variation of RJ48C that contains shorting blocks in the jack so that a loopback is created for troubleshooting when unplugged by connecting pins 1 and 4, and 2 and 5. Sometimes this is referred to as a ''self-looping jack''.\n\nRJ48S is typically used for local area data channels and subrate digital services, and carries one or two lines. It uses a keyed variety of the 8P8C modular connector.\n\nRJ48 connectors are fastened to shielded twisted pair (STP) cables, not the standard unshielded twisted pair (UTP) CAT-(1\u20135).\n{{clear}}\n\n==RJ61==\n{{See also|8P8C|Ethernet over twisted pair}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1.5em; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0;\"\n|+ RJ61 wiring (USOC)\n!

It uses an eight position, eight conductor (8P8C) [[modular connector]].\n\nThis pinout is for multi-line telephone use only; RJ61 is unsuitable for use with high-speed data, because the pins for pairs 3 and 4 are too widely spaced for high signaling frequencies. [[Digital Signal 1|T1 line]]s use another wiring for the same connector, designated RJ48. [[Ethernet over twisted pair]] ([[10BASE-T]], [[100BASE-TX]] and [[1000BASE-T]]) also use a different wiring for the same connector, either [[T568A]] or [[T568B]]. RJ48, T568A, and T568B are all designed to keep pins close together for pairs 3 and 4.\n\nThe flat eight-conductor silver-satin cable traditionally used with four-line analog telephones and RJ61 jacks is also unsuitable for use with high-speed data. Twisted pair cabling is required for data applications. Twisted-pair data patch cable used with the three data standards is not a direct replacement for RJ61 cable, because RJ61 pairs 3 and 4 would be split among different patch cable twisted pairs, causing cross-talk between voice lines 3 and 4 that might be noticeable for long patch cables.\n\nWith the advent of structured wiring systems and TIA/EIA-568-B conventions, the RJ61 pinout is falling into disuse. The T568A and T568B standards are used in place of RJ61 so that a single wiring standard in a facility can be used for both voice and data.\n\n==Similar jacks and unofficial names==\nThe following ''RJ''-style names do not refer to official ACTA types.\n\nThe labels ''RJ9'', ''RJ10'', ''RJ22'' are variously used for [[4P4C]] and 4P2C modular connectors, most typically installed on telephone handsets and their cordage. Telephone handsets do not connect directly to the public network, and therefore have no registered jack designation.\n\n''RJ45'' is often used when referring to an [[8P8C]] connector used for [[TIA/EIA-568-B|T568A/T568B]] and [[Ethernet]]. It is distinct from the official RJ45S interface.\n\n''RJ50'' is often a [[10P10C]] interface, often used for data applications.\n\nThe micro ribbon connector, first made by Amphenol, that is used in the RJ21 interface, has also been used to connect [[Ethernet]] ports in bulk from a switch with 50-pin ports to a [[CAT-5]] rated [[patch panel]], or between two patch panels. A cable with a 50-pin connector on one end can support 6 fully wired [[8P8C]] connectors or Ethernet ports on a patch panel with one spare pair. Alternatively, only the necessary pairs for 10/100 Ethernet can be wired allowing twelve Ethernet ports with a single spare pair.\n\nThis connector is also used with spring bail locks for [[SCSI-1]] connections. Some [[computer printer]]s use a shorter 36-pin version known as a [[Centronics connector]].\n\nThe [[8P8C]] modular jack was chosen as a candidate for [[ISDN]] systems. In order to be considered, the connector system had to be defined by an international standard, leading to the creation of the ISO 8877 standard. Under the rules of the [[IEEE 802]] standards project, international standards are to be preferred over national standards, so when the original [[10BASE-T]] twisted-pair wiring version of [[Ethernet]] was developed, this modular connector was chosen as the basis for IEEE 802.3i-1990.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Modified Modular Jack]]{{snd}} a variation used by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] for serial computer connections\n* [[BS 6312]]{{snd}} British equivalent to RJ25\n* [[EtherCON]]{{snd}} ruggedized 8P8C Ethernet connector\n* [[Key telephone system]]\n* [[Protea (telephone)]]{{snd}} South African telephone jack standard\n* [[Telecommunications Industry Association]]{{snd}} Standards Developing Organization for ACTA\n* [[Audio and video interfaces and connectors]]{{snd}} generic article\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.arcelect.com/RJ_Jack_Glossary.htm RJ glossary]\n* [http://global.ihs.com/search_res.cfm?RID=TIA&INPUT_DOC_NUMBER=ANSI/TIA-968 ANSI/TIA-968-B] documents of [http://www.fcc.gov/wcb/iatd/part_68.html FCC] specifications from the [http://www.part68.org/ Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments], section 6.2 in particular\n* [http://global.ihs.com/search_res.cfm?RID=TIA&INPUT_DOC_NUMBER=TIA-1096 ANSI/TIA-1096-A]\n* [http://www.part68.org/ Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments]\n* [http://www.wire-your-phones.com/ Doing your own telephone wiring]\n* [http://www.hometech.com/learn/hdi11.html Connecting a second phone line]\n\n{{Registered jacks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Registered Jack}}\n[[Category:Telephone connectors]]\n[[Category:Computer connectors]]\n[[Category:Networking hardware]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Telecommunication network interface}}\n{{About|the registered jack (RJ) wiring standard|other uses of modular connectors|Modular connector}}\n[[File:rjxx.jpg|300px|thumb|Left to right, modular connectors: {{unordered list\n | eight-contact 8P8C plug used for RJ45S, RJ49, RJ61 and others.\n | six-contact 6P6C plug used for RJ25\n | four-contact 6P4C plug used for RJ14\n | four-contact 4P4C [[handset]] plug\n | 6P6C jack, may be used for RJ11, RJ14, and RJ25.\n}}]]\n\nA '''registered jack''' ('''RJ''') is a standardized [[telecommunication]] [[network interface device|network interface]] for connecting voice and data equipment to a service provided by a [[local exchange carrier]] or [[long distance carrier]]. Registration interfaces were first defined in the ''Universal Service Ordering Code'' (USOC) system of the [[Bell System]] in the United States for complying with the registration program for customer-supplied telephone equipment mandated by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in the 1970s.<ref>AT&T, ''Registration Interface\u2014Selection and General Information, Bell System Practices, Section 463-400-100 Issue 1, May 1976</ref> They were subsequently codified in title 47 of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] Part 68.<ref name=FCC47Part68 /><ref name=T1.TR5-1999 /><ref name=ACTAdocs />\n\nThe specification includes physical construction, wiring, and signal semantics. Accordingly, registered jacks are primarily named by the letters ''RJ'', followed by two digits that express the type. Additional letter suffixes indicate minor variations. For example, '''RJ11''', '''RJ14''', and '''RJ25''' are the most commonly used interfaces for telephone connections for one-, two-, and three-line service, respectively. Although these standards are legal definitions in the United States, some interfaces are used worldwide.\n\nThe connectors used for registered jack installations are primarily the [[modular connector]] and the 50-pin [[micro ribbon connector|miniature ribbon connector]]. For example, RJ11 uses a six-position two-conductor connector ([[6P2C]]), RJ14 uses a six-position four-conductor ([[6P4C]]) modular jack, while RJ21 uses a 25-pair (50-pin) miniature ribbon connector.\n\n==Naming standard==\nThe registered jack designations originated in the standardization processes in the Bell System in the United States, and describe application circuits and not just the physical geometry of the connectors; inspection of the connector does not necessarily show which registered jack wiring is used. The same modular connector type may be used for different registered jack applications.\n\nStrictly, ''Registered Jack'' refers to both the female physical connector ([[modular connector]]) and its wiring, but the term is often used loosely to refer to modular connectors regardless of wiring or gender, such as in [[Ethernet over twisted pair]]. There is much confusion over these connection standards. The same six-position plug and jack commonly used for telephone line connections may be used for RJ11, RJ14 or even RJ25, all of which are names of interface standards that use this physical connector. The RJ11 standard dictates a single wire pair connection, while RJ14 is a configuration for two lines, and RJ25 uses all six wires for three telephones lines. The RJ designations, though, only pertain to the wiring of the jack, hence the name ''Registered Jack''; it is commonplace, but not strictly correct, to refer to an unwired plug by any of these names.\n\nModular connectors were developed to replace older telephone installation methods that used either hardwired cords, or bulkier varieties of [[telephone plug]]s. The common nomenclature for modular connectors includes the number of contact positions and the number of wires connected, for example ''6P'' indicates a six-position modular plug or jack. A six-position modular plug with conductors in the middle two positions and the other four positions unused has the designation 6P2C. RJ11 uses a 6P2C connector. The connectors could be supplied with more pins, but if more pins are actually wired, the interface is not an RJ11.\n\n==History and authority==\nRegistration interfaces were created by the Bell System under a 1976 [[Federal Communications Commission]] order for the standard [[interconnection]] between telephone company equipment and [[customer premises equipment]]. These interfaces used newly standardized jacks and plugs, primarily based on miniature [[modular connector]]s.\n\nThe wired communications provider (telephone company) is responsible for delivery of services to a minimum (or main) point of entry ([[MPOE]]). The MPOE is a utility box, usually containing surge protective circuitry, which connects the wiring on the customer's property to the communication provider's network. Customers are responsible for all jacks, wiring, and equipment on their side of the MPOE. The intent was to establish a universal standard for wiring and interfaces, and to separate ownership of in-home (or in-office) telephone wiring from the wiring owned by the service provider.\n\nIn the [[Bell System]], following the [[Communications Act of 1934]], the telephone companies owned all telecommunications equipment and they did not allow [[interconnection]] of third-party equipment.  Telephones were generally hardwired, but may have been installed with Bell System connectors to permit portability. The legal case ''[[Hush-A-Phone v. United States]]'' (1956) and the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) ''[[Carterfone]]'' (1968) decision brought changes to this policy, and required the Bell System to allow some interconnection, culminating in the development of registered interfaces using new types of miniature connectors.\n\nRegistered jacks replaced the use of protective couplers provided exclusively by the telephone company. The new modular connectors were much smaller and cheaper to produce than the earlier, bulkier connectors that were used in the Bell System since the 1930s. The Bell System issued specifications for the modular connectors and their wiring as ''Universal Service Order Codes'' (USOC), which were the only standards at the time. Large customers of telephone services commonly use the USOC to specify the interconnection type and, when necessary, pin-assignments, when placing service orders with a network provider.\n\nWhen the U.S. telephone industry was reformed to foster competition in the 1980s, the connection specifications became federal law, ordered by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] and codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), [[Title 47 CFR Part 68]], Subpart F,<ref name=FCC47Part68>[http://www.tscm.com/FCC47CFRpart68.pdf FCC 47 CFR Part 68 ''Connection of Terminal Equipment to the Telephone Network''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705131407/http://www.tscm.com/FCC47CFRpart68.pdf |date=2017-07-05 }}, Section 68.502 superseded by T1.TR5-1999</ref> superseded by T1.TR5-1999.<ref name=T1.TR5-1999 />\n\nIn January 2001, the FCC delegated responsibility for standardizing connections to the telephone network to a new private industry organization, the [[Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments]] (ACTA).<ref name=ACTAdocs>{{cite web|url=http://www.part68.org/documents.aspx|title=ACTA Documents Main - Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments|website=www.part68.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110055347/http://www.part68.org/documents.aspx|archivedate=10 November 2010}}</ref> For this delegation, the FCC removed Subpart F from the CFR and added Subpart G.

This is a modular connector wired for one telephone line, using the center two contacts of six available positions. This configuration is also used for single-line telephones in many countries other than the United States. It may also use a 6P4C connector, to use an additional wire pair for powering lamps on the telephone set. RJ14 is similar to RJ11, but is wired for two lines and RJ25 has three lines. RJ61 is a similar registered jack for four lines, but uses an 8P8C connector.\n\nThe RJ45(S) jack is rarely used.\n\nThe officially recognized types of registered jacks are listed in the following table:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

A cord can be plugged into an RJ11W as well.\n\n==RJ11, RJ14, RJ25 wiring {{anchor|RJ11|RJ14|RJ25}} ==<!-- Redirect target for [[RJ11]], [[RJ14]], [[RJ25]] -->\n[[File:Rj25 connector.jpg|thumb|6P6C connector showing the location of pin 1]]\n\nAll of these registered jacks are described as containing a number of potential [[Electrical connector|contact]] positions and the actual number of contacts installed within these positions. RJ11, RJ14, and RJ25 all use the same six-position [[modular connector]], thus are physically identical except for the different number of contacts (two, four and six respectively) allowing connections for one, two, or three telephone lines respectively.\n\nCords connecting to an RJ11 interface require a 6P2C connector. Nevertheless, cords sold as RJ11 often use 6P4C connectors (six position, four conductor) with four wires. Two of the six possible contact positions connect tip and ring, and the other two conductors are unused.\n\nThe conductors other than the two central tip and ring conductors are in practice variously used for a second or third telephone line, a [[Ground (electricity)|ground]] for [[Party line (telephony)|selective ringers]], low-voltage power for a [[Rotary dial|dial]] light, or for anti-tinkle circuitry to prevent [[pulse dialing]] phones from sounding the bell on other extensions.\n\n===Pinout===\nObserving the male connector from the cable opening, with prong facing downward, the pins are numbered 1\u20136, left to right:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!

It is used to implement [[telecommunication connection|connections]] for up to 25 [[telephone line|lines]], or circuits that require many wire pairs, such as used in the [[1A2 Key System|1A2 key telephone system]]. The [[miniature ribbon connector]] of this interface is also known as a 50-pin telco connector, CHAMP(AMP), or ''Amphenol'' connector, the latter being a [[genericized trademark]], as [[Amphenol]] was a prominent [[manufacturer]] of these at one time.\n\nA cable color scheme, known as [[even-count color code]], is determined for 25 pairs of conductors as follows:<ref>{{cite book |last=Ogletree |first=Terry William |title=Upgrading and Repairing Networks |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHXeT01OSXcC&pg=PA84 |year=2004 |edition=4 |publisher=Que Publishing |isbn=0-7897-2817-6 |page=84 |chapter=Cables, Connectors, Concentrators, and Other Network Components |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626201456/http://books.google.com/books?id=ZHXeT01OSXcC&pg=PA84 |archivedate=2014-06-26 }}</ref> For each ring, the primary, more prominent color is chosen from the set blue, orange, green, brown, and slate, in that order, and the secondary, thinner stripe color from the set of white, red, black, yellow, and violet colors, in that order. The tip conductor color scheme uses the same colors as the matching ring but switches the thickness of the primary and secondary colored stripes. Since the sets are ordered, an orange (color 2 in its set) with a yellow (color 4) is the color scheme for the 4\u00b75 + 2 \u2212 5 = 17th pair of wires. If the yellow is the more prominent, thicker stripe, then the wire is a tip conductor connecting to the pin numbered 25 + the pair #, which is pin 42 in this case. Ring conductors connect to the same pin number as the pair number.\n\nA conventional enumeration of wire color pairs then begins blue (and white), orange (and white), green (and white) and brown (and white), which subsumes a color-coding convention used in cables of 4 or fewer pairs (8 wires or less) with 8P and 6P connectors.\n\nDual 50-pin ribbon connectors are often used on [[punch block]]s to create a [[breakout box]] for [[private branch exchange]] (PBX) and other [[key telephone system]]s.\n{{clear}}\n\n==RJ45S==\n[[File:RJ45 female connector.jpg|thumb|8P8C keyed female connector (jack).]]\nThe RJ45S, a standard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leviton.com/en/support/product-support/network-solutions/wiring-diagrams/usoc-codes|title=Wiring Diagrams|author=|date=|website=www.leviton.com|accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref> jack once specified for modem or data interfaces, uses a mechanically-keyed variation of the 8P8C body with an extra tab that prevents it from mating with other connectors; the visual difference from the more-common 8P8C is subtle.

It is used for [[Digital Signal 1|T1]] and [[ISDN]] termination and local area data channels/subrate digital services. It uses the eight-position [[modular connector]] (8P8C).\n\nRJ48C is commonly used for [[Digital Signal 1|T1]] circuits and uses pin numbers 1, 2, 4 and 5.\n\nRJ48X is a variation of RJ48C that contains shorting blocks in the jack so that a loopback is created for troubleshooting when unplugged by connecting pins 1 and 4, and 2 and 5. Sometimes this is referred to as a ''self-looping jack''.\n\nRJ48S is typically used for local area data channels and subrate digital services, and carries one or two lines. It uses a keyed variety of the 8P8C modular connector.\n\nRJ48 connectors are fastened to shielded twisted pair (STP) cables, not the standard unshielded twisted pair (UTP) CAT-(1\u20135).\n{{clear}}\n\n==RJ61==\n{{See also|8P8C|Ethernet over twisted pair}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1.5em; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0;\"\n|+ RJ61 wiring (USOC)\n!

It uses an eight position, eight conductor (8P8C) [[modular connector]].\n\nThis pinout is for multi-line telephone use only; RJ61 is unsuitable for use with high-speed data, because the pins for pairs 3 and 4 are too widely spaced for high signaling frequencies. [[Digital Signal 1|T1 line]]s use another wiring for the same connector, designated RJ48. [[Ethernet over twisted pair]] ([[10BASE-T]], [[100BASE-TX]] and [[1000BASE-T]]) also use a different wiring for the same connector, either [[T568A]] or [[T568B]]. RJ48, T568A, and T568B are all designed to keep pins close together for pairs 3 and 4.\n\nThe flat eight-conductor silver-satin cable traditionally used with four-line analog telephones and RJ61 jacks is also unsuitable for use with high-speed data. Twisted pair cabling is required for data applications. Twisted-pair data patch cable used with the three data standards is not a direct replacement for RJ61 cable, because RJ61 pairs 3 and 4 would be split among different patch cable twisted pairs, causing cross-talk between voice lines 3 and 4 that might be noticeable for long patch cables.\n\nWith the advent of structured wiring systems and TIA/EIA-568-B conventions, the RJ61 pinout is falling into disuse. The T568A and T568B standards are used in place of RJ61 so that a single wiring standard in a facility can be used for both voice and data.\n\n==Similar jacks and unofficial names==\nThe following ''RJ''-style names do not refer to official ACTA types.\n\nThe labels ''RJ9'', ''RJ10'', ''RJ22'' are variously used for [[4P4C]] and 4P2C modular connectors, most typically installed on telephone handsets and their cordage. Telephone handsets do not connect directly to the public network, and therefor have no registered jack designation.\n\n''RJ45'' is often used when referring to an [[8P8C]] connector used for [[TIA/EIA-568-B|T568A/T568B]] and [[Ethernet]]. It is distinct from the official RJ45S interface. \n\n''RJ50'' is often a [[10P10C]] interface, often used for data applications.\n\nThe micro ribbon connector, first made by Amphenol, that is used in the RJ21 interface, has also been used to connect [[Ethernet]] ports in bulk from a switch with 50-pin ports to a [[CAT-5]] rated [[patch panel]], or between two patch panels. A cable with a 50-pin connector on one end can support 6 fully wired [[8P8C]] connectors or Ethernet ports on a patch panel with one spare pair. Alternatively, only the necessary pairs for 10/100 Ethernet can be wired allowing twelve Ethernet ports with a single spare pair.\n\nThis connector is also used with spring bail locks for [[SCSI-1]] connections. Some [[computer printer]]s use a shorter 36-pin version known as a [[Centronics connector]].\n\nThe [[8P8C]] modular jack was chosen as a candidate for [[ISDN]] systems. In order to be considered, the connector system had to be defined by an international standard, leading to the creation of the ISO 8877 standard. Under the rules of the [[IEEE 802]] standards project, international standards are to be preferred over national standards, so when the original [[10BASE-T]] twisted-pair wiring version of [[Ethernet]] was developed, this modular connector was chosen as the basis for IEEE 802.3i-1990.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Modified Modular Jack]]{{snd}} a variation used by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] for serial computer connections\n* [[BS 6312]]{{snd}} British equivalent to RJ25\n* [[EtherCON]]{{snd}} ruggedized 8P8C Ethernet connector\n* [[Key telephone system]]\n* [[Protea (telephone)]]{{snd}} South African telephone jack standard\n* [[Telecommunications Industry Association]]{{snd}} Standards Developing Organization for ACTA\n* [[Audio and video interfaces and connectors]]{{snd}} generic article\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.arcelect.com/RJ_Jack_Glossary.htm RJ glossary]\n* [http://global.ihs.com/search_res.cfm?RID=TIA&INPUT_DOC_NUMBER=ANSI/TIA-968 ANSI/TIA-968-B] documents of [http://www.fcc.gov/wcb/iatd/part_68.html FCC] specifications from the [http://www.part68.org/ Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments], section 6.2 in particular\n* [http://global.ihs.com/search_res.cfm?RID=TIA&INPUT_DOC_NUMBER=TIA-1096 ANSI/TIA-1096-A]\n* [http://www.part68.org/ Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments]\n* [http://www.wire-your-phones.com/ Doing your own telephone wiring]\n* [http://www.hometech.com/learn/hdi11.html Connecting a second phone line]\n\n{{Registered jacks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Registered Jack}}\n[[Category:Telephone connectors]]\n[[Category:Computer connectors]]\n[[Category:Networking hardware]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: therefor \u2192 therefore", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_jack"}

Of the four canonical schools of Sunni Islam, the family adhered to the relatively liberal [[Hanafi]] [[fiqh]]. Hosayn-e Khatibi enjoyed such renown in his youth\u2014so says Aflaki with characteristic exaggeration\u2014that Razi al-Din Nayshapuri and other famous scholars came to study with him (Af 9; for the legend about Baha al-Din, see below, \u201cThe Mythical Baha al-Din\u201d). Another report indicates that Baha al-Din\u2019s grandfather, Ahmad al-Khatibi, was born to Ferdows Khatun, a daughter of the reputed Hanafite jurist and author Shams al-A\u2019emma Abu Bakr of Sarakhs, who died circa 1088 (Af 75; FB 6 n.4; Mei 74 n. 17). This is far from implausible and, if true, would tend to suggest that Ahmad al-Khatabi had studied under Shams al-A\u2019emma. Prior to that the family could supposedly trace its roots back to Isfahan. We do not learn the name of Baha al-Din\u2019s mother in the sources, only that he referred to her as \u201cMama\u201d (Mami), and that she lived to the 1200s.\u201d (p. 44)</ref> and that she was a simple woman who lived to the 1200s. The mother of Rumi was Mu'mina Kh\u0101t\u016bn. The profession of the family for several generations was that of Islamic preachers of the liberal [[Hanafi]] rite, and this family tradition was continued by Rumi (see his Fihi Ma Fih and Seven Sermons) and [[Sultan Walad]] (see Ma'rif Waladi for examples of his everyday sermons and lectures).\n\nWhen the [[Mongol]]s invaded [[Central Asia]] sometime between 1215 and 1220, Baha ud-Din Walad, with his whole family and a group of disciples, set out westwards. According to hagiographical account which is not agreed upon by all Rumi scholars, Rumi encountered one of the most famous mystic Persian poets, [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]], in the Iranian city of [[Nishapur]], located in the province of Khor\u0101s\u0101n. Attar immediately recognized Rumi's spiritual eminence. He saw the father walking ahead of the son and said, \"Here comes a sea followed by an ocean.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Suspended Somewhere Between: A Book of Verse|last=Ahmed|first=Akbar|publisher=PM Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-60486-485-4|location=|pages=i}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi|last=El-Fers|first=Mohamed|publisher=MokumTV|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4092-9291-3|location=|pages=45}}</ref> Attar gave the boy his ''Asr\u0101rn\u0101ma'', a book about the entanglement of the soul in the material world. This meeting had a deep impact on the eighteen-year-old Rumi and later on became the inspiration for his works.\n\nFrom Nishapur, Walad and his entourage set out for [[Baghdad]], meeting many of the scholars and Sufis of the city.<ref>Ahmed, Nazeer, ''Islam in Global History: From the Death of Prophet Muhammed to the First World War'', p.58, Xlibris Corporation (2000), {{ISBN|978-0-7388-5962-0}}{{self-published source|date=December 2017}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} From Baghdad they went to [[Hejaz]] and performed the [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] at [[Mecca]]. The migrating caravan then passed through [[Damascus]], [[Malatya]], [[Erzincan]], [[Sivas]], [[Kayseri]] and [[Nigde]]. They finally settled in [[Karaman]] for seven years; Rumi's mother and brother both died there. In 1225, Rumi married Gowhar Khatun in Karaman. They had two sons: [[Sultan Walad]] and Ala-eddin Chalabi. When his wife died, Rumi married again and had a son, Amir Alim Chalabi, and a daughter, Malakeh Khatun.\n\nOn 1 May 1228, most likely as a result of the insistent invitation of [[Kayqubad I|'Al\u0101' ud-D\u012bn Key-Qob\u0101d]], ruler of Anatolia, [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari|Baha' ud-Din]] came and finally settled in Konya in [[Anatolia]] within the westernmost territories of the [[Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm]].\n\n=== Education and encounters with Shams-e Tabrizi ===\n\nBaha' ud-Din became the head of a [[madrassa]] (religious school) and when he died, Rumi, aged twenty-five, inherited his position as the Islamic molvi. One of Baha' ud-Din's students, Sayyed Burhan ud-Din Muhaqqiq Termazi, continued to train Rumi in the [[Shariah]] as well as the [[Tariqa]], especially that of Rumi's father. For nine years, Rumi practised Sufism as a disciple of Burhan ud-Din until the latter died in 1240 or 1241. Rumi's public life then began: he became an Islamic Jurist, issuing [[fatwas]] and giving sermons in the mosques of Konya. He also served as a Molvi (Islamic teacher) and taught his adherents in the madrassa.\n\nDuring this period, Rumi also travelled to [[Damascus]] and is said to have spent four years there.\n\nIt was his meeting with the dervish [[Shams-e Tabrizi]] on 15 November 1244 that completely changed his life. From an accomplished teacher and jurist, Rumi was transformed into an ascetic.\n[[File:Tomb of Shams Tabrizi 9.JPG|thumb|Tomb shrine of Shams Tabrizi, [[Khoy]]]]\nShams had travelled throughout the Middle East searching and praying for someone who could \"endure my company\". A voice said to him, \"What will you give in return?\" Shams replied, \"My head!\" The voice then said, \"The one you seek is Jalal ud-Din of Konya.\" On the night of 5 December 1248, as Rumi and Shams were talking, Shams was called to the back door. He went out, never to be seen again. It is rumoured that Shams was murdered with the connivance of Rumi's son, 'Ala' ud-Din; if so, Shams indeed gave his head for the privilege of mystical friendship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.semazen.net/eng/show_text_main.php?id=166&menuId=17|title=Hz. Mawlana and Shams|work=semazen.net}}</ref>\n\nRumi's love for, and his bereavement at the death of, Shams found their expression in an outpouring of lyric poems, [[Diwan-e Shams-e Tabrizi|''Divan-e Shams-e Tabrizi'']]. He himself went out searching for Shams and journeyed again to Damascus. There, he realised:\n{{quote|\nWhy should I seek? I am the same as<br />\nHe.

Rumi found another companion in Sala\u1e25 ud-Din-e Zarkub, a goldsmith. After Salah ud-Din's death, Rumi's scribe and favourite student, Hussam-e Chalabi, assumed the role of Rumi's companion. One day, the two of them were wandering through the Meram vineyards outside Konya when Hussam described to Rumi an idea he had had: \"If you were to write a book like the ''Il\u0101h\u012bn\u0101ma'' of Sanai or the ''Mantiq ut-Tayr'' of 'Attar, it would become the companion of many troubadours. They would fill their hearts from your work and compose music to accompany it.\" Rumi smiled and took out a piece of paper on which were written the opening eighteen lines of his ''Masnavi'', beginning with:\n\n{{quote|\nListen to the reed and the tale it tells,<br />\nHow it sings of separation...<ref>{{cite web|first=Camille |last=Helminski| title=Introduction to Rumi: Daylight | url = http://www.sufism.org/books/dayex.html|accessdate=2007-05-06|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716155558/http://www.sufism.org/books/dayex.html |archivedate = July 16, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n}}\n\nHussam implored Rumi to write more. Rumi spent the next twelve years of his life in Anatolia dictating the six volumes of this masterwork, the ''Masnavi'', to Hussam.\n\nIn December 1273, Rumi fell ill; he predicted his own death and composed the well-known ''ghazal'', which begins with the verse:\n\n{{quote|\nHow doest thou know what sort of king I have within me as companion?<br />\nDo not cast thy glance upon my golden face, for I have iron legs.<ref>{{cite book | last =Nasr | first =Seyyed Hossein  | title =Islamic Art and Spirituality | publisher =SUNY Press | year= 1987 | page =120 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=EBu6gWcT0DsC&pg=PA120 | isbn=978-0-88706-174-5 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nRumi died on 17 December 1273 in [[Konya]].

See [[Rumi ghazal 163]].]]\nLike other mystic and Sufi poets of Persian literature, Rumi's poetry speaks of love which infuses the world. Rumi's teachings also express the tenets summarized in the Quranic verse which Shams-e Tabrizi cited as the essence of prophetic guidance: \"Know that \u2018There is no god but He,\u2019 and ask forgiveness for your sin\" (Q. 47:19). In the interpretation attributed to Shams, the first part of the verse commands the humanity to seek knowledge of ''[[tawhid]]'' (oneness of God), while the second instructs them to negate their own existence. In Rumi's terms, ''tawhid'' is lived most fully through love, with the connection being made explicit in his verse that describes love as \"that flame which, when it blazes up, burns away everything except the Everlasting Beloved.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=William C.

For Rumi, music helped devotees to focus their whole being on the divine and to do this so intensely that the soul was both destroyed and resurrected. It was from these ideas that the practice of [[Sufi whirling|whirling Dervishes]] developed into a ritual form. His teachings became the base for the order of the Mevlevi, which his son Sultan Walad organised. Rumi encouraged [[Sama (Sufism)|Sama]], listening to music and turning or doing the sacred dance. In the Mevlevi tradition, ''sam\u0101\u02bf'' represents a mystical journey of spiritual ascent through mind and love to the Perfect One. In this journey, the seeker symbolically turns towards the truth, grows through love, abandons the ego, finds the truth and arrives at the Perfect. The seeker then returns from this spiritual journey, with greater maturity, to love and to be of service to the whole of creation without discrimination with regard to beliefs, races, classes and nations.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn other verses in the ''Masnavi'', Rumi describes in detail the universal message of love:\n\n{{quote|\nThe lover\u2019s cause is separate from all other causes<br />\nLove is the astrolabe of God's mysteries.<ref>{{cite book | last =Naini | first =Majid| title =The Mysteries of the Universe and Rumi's Discoveries on the Majestic Path of Love | authorlink=Majid Naini}}</ref>\n}}\n\nRumi's favourite musical instrument was the [[ney]] (reed flute).<ref name=\"BBC-Haviland\" />\n\n== Major works ==\n[[File:Meeting of Jalal al-Din Rumi and Molla Shams al-Din.jpg|thumb|An [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era manuscript depicting Rumi and [[Shams-e Tabrizi]].]]\n\nRumi's poetry is often divided into various categories: the quatrains (''[[Ruba'i|rubay\u0101t]]'') and odes (''[[ghazal]]'') of the ''Divan'', the six books of the ''Masnavi''.

The sermons themselves give a commentary on the deeper meaning of Qur'an and [[Hadith]]. The sermons also include quotations from poems of [[Sana'i]], [[Attar of Nishapur|'Attar]], and other poets, including Rumi himself. As Aflak\u012b relates, after Shams-e Tabr\u012bz\u012b, Rumi gave sermons at the request of notables, especially Sal\u0101h al-D\u012bn Zark\u016bb. The style of Persian is rather simple, but quotation of Arabic and knowledge of history and the Hadith show Rumi's knowledge in the Islamic sciences.

On 13 December 1925, a law was passed closing all the ''[[Khanqah|tekke]]''s (dervish lodges) and ''z\u0101wiyas'' (chief dervish lodges), and the centres of veneration to which visits (''ziy\u0101rat'') were made. Istanbul alone had more than 250 ''tekke''s as well as small centres for gatherings of various fraternities; this law dissolved the Sufi Orders, prohibited the use of mystical names, titles and costumes pertaining to their titles, impounded the Orders' assets, and banned their ceremonies and meetings. The law also provided penalties for those who tried to re-establish the Orders. Two years later, in 1927, the Mausoleum of Mevl\u00e2na in Konya was allowed to reopen as a Museum.<ref>Mango, Andrew, ''Atat\u00fcrk: The Biography of the Founder of Modern Turkey'', (2002), {{ISBN|978-1-58567-011-6}}.</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, the Turkish government began allowing the Whirling Dervishes to perform once a year in Konya.

Hosayn-e Khatibi enjoyed such renown in his youth\u2014so says Aflaki with characteristic exaggeration\u2014that Razi al-Din Nayshapuri and other famous scholars came to study with him (Af 9; for the legend about Baha al-Din, see below, \u201cThe Mythical Baha al-Din\u201d). Another report indicates that Baha al-Din\u2019s grandfather, Ahmad al-Khatibi, was born to Ferdows Khatun, a daughter of the reputed Hanafite jurist and author Shams al-A\u2019emma Abu Bakr of Sarakhs, who died circa 1088 (Af 75; FB 6 n.4; Mei 74 n. 17). This is far from implausible and, if true, would tend to suggest that Ahmad al-Khatabi had studied under Shams al-A\u2019emma. Prior to that the family could supposedly trace its roots back to Isfahan. We do not learn the name of Baha al-Din\u2019s mother in the sources, only that he referred to her as \u201cMama\u201d (Mami), and that she lived to the 1200s.\u201d (p. 44)</ref> and that she was a simple woman who lived to the 1200s.

According to hagiographical account which is not agreed upon by all Rumi scholars, Rumi encountered one of the most famous mystic Persian poets, [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]], in the Iranian city of [[Nishapur]], located in the province of Khor\u0101s\u0101n.

The migrating caravan then passed through [[Damascus]], [[Malatya]], [[Erzincan]], [[Sivas]], [[Kayseri]] and [[Nigde]]. They finally settled in [[Karaman]] for seven years; Rumi's mother and brother both died there. In 1225, Rumi married Gowhar Khatun in Karaman. They had two sons: [[Sultan Walad]] and Ala-eddin Chalabi. When his wife died, Rumi married again and had a son, Amir Alim Chalabi, and a daughter, Malakeh Khatun.\n\nOn 1 May 1228, most likely as a result of the insistent invitation of [[Kayqubad I|'Al\u0101' ud-D\u012bn Key-Qob\u0101d]], ruler of Anatolia, [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari|Baha' ud-Din]] came and finally settled in Konya in [[Anatolia]] within the westernmost territories of the [[Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm]].\n\n=== Education and encounters with Shams-e Tabrizi ===\n\nBaha' ud-Din became the head of a [[madrassa]] (religious school) and when he died, Rumi, aged twenty-five, inherited his position as the Islamic molvi. One of Baha' ud-Din's students, Sayyed Burhan ud-Din Muhaqqiq Termazi, continued to train Rumi in the [[Shariah]] as well as the [[Tariqa]], especially that of Rumi's father. For nine years, Rumi practised Sufism as a disciple of Burhan ud-Din until the latter died in 1240 or 1241. Rumi's public life then began: he became an Islamic Jurist, issuing [[fatwas]] and giving sermons in the mosques of Konya. He also served as a Molvi (Islamic teacher) and taught his adherents in the madrassa.\n\nDuring this period, Rumi also travelled to [[Damascus]] and is said to have spent four years there.\n\nIt was his meeting with the dervish [[Shams-e Tabrizi]] on 15 November 1244 that completely changed his life. From an accomplished teacher and jurist, Rumi was transformed into an ascetic.\n[[File:Tomb of Shams Tabrizi 9.JPG|thumb|Tomb shrine of Shams Tabrizi, [[Khoy]]]]\nShams had travelled throughout the Middle East searching and praying for someone who could \"endure my company\". A voice said to him, \"What will you give in return?\" Shams replied, \"My head!\" The voice then said, \"The one you seek is Jalal ud-Din of Konya.\" On the night of 5 December 1248, as Rumi and Shams were talking, Shams was called to the back door. He went out, never to be seen again. It is rumoured that Shams was murdered with the connivance of Rumi's son, 'Ala' ud-Din; if so, Shams indeed gave his head for the privilege of mystical friendship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.semazen.net/eng/show_text_main.php?id=166&menuId=17|title=Hz.

He himself went out searching for Shams and journeyed again to Damascus. There, he realised:\n{{quote|\nWhy should I seek? I am the same as<br />\nHe.

Rumi found another companion in Sala\u1e25 ud-Din-e Zarkub, a goldsmith. After Salah ud-Din's death, Rumi's scribe and favourite student, Hussam-e Chalabi, assumed the role of Rumi's companion. One day, the two of them were wandering through the Meram vineyards outside Konya when Hussam described to Rumi an idea he had had: \"If you were to write a book like the ''Il\u0101h\u012bn\u0101ma'' of Sanai or the ''Mantiq ut-Tayr'' of 'Attar, it would become the companion of many troubadours. They would fill their hearts from your work and compose music to accompany it.\" Rumi smiled and took out a piece of paper on which were written the opening eighteen lines of his ''Masnavi'', beginning with:\n\n{{quote|\nListen to the reed and the tale it tells,<br />\nHow it sings of separation...<ref>{{cite web|first=Camille |last=Helminski| title=Introduction to Rumi: Daylight | url = http://www.sufism.org/books/dayex.html|accessdate=2007-05-06|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716155558/http://www.sufism.org/books/dayex.html |archivedate = July 16, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n}}\n\nHussam implored Rumi to write more. Rumi spent the next twelve years of his life in Anatolia dictating the six volumes of this masterwork, the ''Masnavi'', to Hussam.\n\nIn December 1273, Rumi fell ill; he predicted his own death and composed the well-known ''ghazal'', which begins with the verse:\n\n{{quote|\nHow doest thou know what sort of king I have within me as companion?<br />\nDo not cast thy glance upon my golden face, for I have iron legs.<ref>{{cite book | last =Nasr | first =Seyyed Hossein  | title =Islamic Art and Spirituality | publisher =SUNY Press | year= 1987 | page =120 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=EBu6gWcT0DsC&pg=PA120 | isbn=978-0-88706-174-5 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nRumi died on 17 December 1273 in [[Konya]].

For Rumi, music helped devotees to focus their whole being on the divine and to do this so intensely that the soul was both destroyed and resurrected. It was from these ideas that the practice of [[Sufi whirling|whirling Dervishes]] developed into a ritual form. His teachings became the base for the order of the Mevlevi, which his son Sultan Walad organised. Rumi encouraged [[Sama (Sufism)|Sama]], listening to music and turning or doing the sacred dance. In the Mevlevi tradition, ''sam\u0101\u02bf'' represents a mystical journey of spiritual ascent through mind and love to the Perfect One. In this journey, the seeker symbolically turns towards the truth, grows through love, abandons the ego, finds the truth and arrives at the Perfect. The seeker then returns from this spiritual journey, with greater maturity, to love and to be of service to the whole of creation without discrimination with regard to beliefs, races, classes and nations.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn other verses in the ''Masnavi'', Rumi describes in detail the universal message of love:\n\n{{quote|\nThe lover\u2019s cause is separate from all other causes<br />\nLove is the astrolabe of God's mysteries.<ref>{{cite book | last =Naini | first =Majid| title =The Mysteries of the Universe and Rumi's Discoveries on the Majestic Path of Love | authorlink=Majid Naini}}</ref>\n}}\n\nRumi's favourite musical instrument was the [[ney]] (reed flute).<ref name=\"BBC-Haviland\" />\n\n== Major works ==\n[[File:Meeting of Jalal al-Din Rumi and Molla Shams al-Din.jpg|thumb|An [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era manuscript depicting Rumi and [[Shams-e Tabrizi]].]]\n\nRumi's poetry is often divided into various categories: the quatrains (''[[Ruba'i|rubay\u0101t]]'') and odes (''[[ghazal]]'') of the ''Divan'', the six books of the ''Masnavi''.

The sermons themselves give a commentary on the deeper meaning of Qur'an and [[Hadith]]. The sermons also include quotations from poems of [[Sana'i]], [[Attar of Nishapur|'Attar]], and other poets, including Rumi himself. As Aflak\u012b relates, after Shams-e Tabr\u012bz\u012b, Rumi gave sermons at the request of notables, especially Sal\u0101h al-D\u012bn Zark\u016bb. The style of Persian is rather simple, but quotation of Arabic and knowledge of history and the Hadith show Rumi's knowledge in the Islamic sciences.

The letters testify that Rumi kept very busy helping family members and administering a community of disciples that had grown up around them.

Worst episode ever.is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and record producer. The only son of country music singers [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Jessi Colter]], he has been active since 1996, releasing seven albums and numerous EPs. He also has made some appearances and cameos in films. Jennings is active mainly in [[outlaw country]] and [[Southern rock]] genres.\n\nJennings made his debut with the single \"4th of July\" of his 2005 album ''[[Put the \"O\" Back in Country]]'' on  [[Universal South Records|Universal South]], which peaked at No.&nbsp;22 on the Billboard country charts.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Shooter Jennings - Chart history {{!}} Billboard|url = http://www.billboard.com/artist/279176/shooter-jennings/chart?f=320|website = www.billboard.com|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}</ref> Jennings has since followed with six more full-length studio albums: ''[[Electric Rodeo (Shooter Jennings album)|Electric Rodeo]]'' (2006), ''[[The Wolf (Shooter Jennings album)|The Wolf]]'' (2007), ''[[Black Ribbons]]'' (2009), ''Family Man'' (2012), ''The Other Life'' (2013) and ''[[Countach (For Giorgio)]]'' (2016), in addition to a live album, a compilation, and numerous [[Extended play|EPs]].\n\nIn 2018 Jennings released his eighth album called ''Shooter'', under [[Dave Cobb]]\u2019s [[Low Country Sound]] imprint label.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/lists/2018-country-music-preview-30-most-anticipated-albums-tours-w514999/shooter-jennings-shooter-w515082|title= 30 Most Anticipated Albums Shooter Jennings\u2019s Shooter|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2018-04-07}}</ref>\n\n== Musical career ==\n=== Early life ===\nJennings was born in Nashville, Tennessee on May 19, 1979. There are two different accounts regarding how he got his nickname \"Shooter\". His mother cited her, and husband Waylon Jennings', love of western culture and cowboy art for inspiring the gun-derived moniker. But his father said he came up with the name when, moments after the newborn emerged from his mother's womb, the boy sprayed a nurse before anyone could put on his first diaper. \u201cI love my mom,\u201d says Jennings, \u201cbut I like Dad\u2019s version better. And I believe it\u2019s true. He didn\u2019t make [stuff] like that up.\"\n\nHe lived the first few years of his life in a crib on his parents' tour bus surrounded by the likes of [[Johnny Cash]], [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. By age five, he was playing drums. At 8 years old, he began taking piano lessons. He started playing guitar at fourteen and on occasion he'd play percussion in his father's band.\n\nIn high school Jennings fronted an industrial rock band called KilRaven for his high school's talent show. In 2011, he released the KilRaven track \"Only You\" on the album \"Missed The Boat\".\n\nIn 1996, Jennings and his father recorded an album together. They called it ''Fenixon'' (a play on the words \"phoenix\" and \"sun\") but could not find a label to distribute it.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Waylon and Son, Reunited on Disc|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122471459623460261|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-11-21|issn = 0099-9660|first = Jim|last = Fusilli}}</ref> Some of the material was remastered and used for the album ''Waylon Forever''. The full ''Fenixon'' recording was finally released by Jennings' label Black Country Rock in 2014.\n\n=== Stargunn ===\nIn 2001, Jennings left [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to seek his fortunes in [[Los Angeles]]. He assembled and performed with Stargunn, a [[rock music|rock]] band. The band featured Jennings on piano and lead vocals, Carter Falco, and Kevin Sciou on guitar and background vocals, Curtis Roach on bass, and Lex Lipsitz on drums.\n\nTowards the end of 2001, Stargunn released their first album ''The Only Way Up Is Down'' and toured with [[Saliva (band)|Saliva]], [[Tesla (band)|Tesla]], Mark Ford and others in support of the album. That same year ''Music Connection'' magazine listed Stargunn as one of the Hot 100 Unsigned Artists of 2001.\n\nIn 2002 Stargunn was featured on ''I've Always Been Crazy: A Tribute to Waylon Jennings'', and the soundtrack to the [[Vince Vaughn]] film ''[[Made (2001 film)|Made]]''. Shortly after, [[Touchstone Pictures]] licensed the song \"White Lines N Black Ties\" for the film ''[[The Crew (2000 film)|The Crew]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]].\n\nStargunn performed together for three years, built an avid following, and earned praise from the local music press. On March 30, 2003, Jennings dissolved Stargunn and began working on his solo career.\n\n\nAfter the band's breakup, Jennings was twice presented with the opportunity to front the hard rock supergroup [[Velvet Revolver]], but chose instead to pursue a career in country music.<ref>{{Cite web|title = SHOOTER JENNINGS Claims He Was Offered VELVET REVOLVER Job Twice|url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/shooter-jennings-claims-he-was-offered-velvet-revolver-job-twice/|website = BLABBERMOUTH.NET|date = 2009-03-19|accessdate = 2015-11-21|language = en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Jennings' label Black Country Rock released Stargunn's debut album \"The Only Way Up Is Down\" on vinyl as part of Record Store Day.\n\n=== ''Put the \"O\" Back in Country'' ===\nHe returned to Los Angeles in 2004 to begin working on new material. In 2005 Jennings signed his first recording contract, with [[Universal South Records]], releasing his debut album ''[[Put the \"O\" Back in Country]]'' that same year.\n\n\"Put the \"O\" Back in Country\" produced his only entry on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts in its lead-off single \"Fourth of July\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;22. The album version of this song features a cameo appearance by George Jones, who sings the chorus to his signature song \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" at the end; this guest appearance was removed from the song's radio edit. Despite the edit, Jones was credited on the Billboard charts. The album featured his new band The .357's, which consisted of Leroy Powell on guitar, Bryan Keeling on drums, [[Ted Russell Kamp|Ted Kamp]] on bass with [[Robby Turner]] on steel, and backing vocals by [[Bonnie Bramlett]].\n\nLater that year his song \"Busted In Baylor County\" was then featured in the 2005 film version of ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', furthermore Jennings portrayed his father in the [[Johnny Cash]] [[Biographical film|biopic]] ''[[Walk the Line]]'' alongside [[Joaquin Phoenix]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]]. His rendition of his father's song \"Long Way From Home\" was featured on the film's soundtrack.\n\n=== ''Electric Rodeo'' and ''The Wolf'' ===\nThough recorded before ''Put the \"O\" Back in Country'', released on April 4, 2006,{{clarify|reason=is this the release date of Put the O Back in Country or the release date of Electric Rodeo?|date=April 2017}} ''[[Electric Rodeo (Shooter Jennings album)|Electric Rodeo]]'' was released as Jennings's second solo album. Sonically, ''Electric Rodeo'' is louder, rawer, more upfront rock and roll than its predecessor.\n\n''Electric Rodeo'' was followed by ''[[The Wolf (Shooter Jennings album)|The Wolf]]'' on October 23, 2007. The album varied from his previous records in that the .357s had opted for a decidedly 1970s feel to the instrumentals. It featured collaborations with [[Doug Kershaw]] and [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], as well as a cover of the [[Dire Straits]] song \"[[Walk of Life]]\".\n\nThat same year Jennings was featured on a duet of \"[[Good Hearted Woman (song)|Good Hearted Woman]]\" on [[Deana Carter]]'s sixth studio album, ''[[The Chain (Deana Carter album)|The Chain]]''.\n\n=== Departure from Universal ===\nIn 2009, Jennings, having issues with his label and wanting out of his four-album contract released his first compilation album, ''[[Bad Magick: The Best of Shooter Jennings and the .357's]]''. The album featured four new tracks; live versions of \"Lonesome Blues\", and \"Daddy's Farm\", as well as covers of his father's \"Lonesome, Onry and Mean\", and the [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] song \"Living Proof\".\n\nAfter the release of ''Bad Magick: The Best of Shooter Jennings and the .357's'', having fulfilled his four-album contract; Jennings parted ways with Universal records.\n\nOn March 23, 2009 Jennings took part in ''[[CMT Crossroads]]'', a television show in which two musicians are paired with one another and perform a small concert together for an intimate crowd. The episode paired Jennings with close friend and fellow musician [[Jamey Johnson]]. The evening's set list consisted entirely of duets, including a cover of \"Outlaw Shit\" from the ''[[Waylon Forever]]'' album, two songs from Jennings' discography; \"God Bless Alabama\", \"It Ain't Easy\". As well as four songs from Johnson's album ''[[That Lonesome Song]]''; \"High Cost Of Living\", \"Mowing Down The Roses\", \"Between Jennings and Jones\" and \"In Color\".\n\n=== ''Black Ribbons'' ===\nHaving left Universal, Jennings changed the name of his backing band from The .357's to Hierophant. With the news that he and his band would be joining the likes of [[Paramore]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Jefree Star]], and various other popular rock bands on the 2009 [[Warped Tour]] it became apparent that Jennings next album would differ drastically from his previous efforts.\n\nIn February 2009, it was announced that the album would be titled ''[[Black Ribbons]]''. It was also announced that it would be a dystopian concept rock opera and that writer [[Stephen King]] would play a major role in the album as Will O' The Wisp.\n\nIt was released independently on March 2, 2010 through Black Country Rock Records, and although it was seen as a complete departure from his country sound, the album showed off the diversity as an artist and gained him much critical acclaim, as well as a brand new underground following.\n\nOn May 1, 2010, Jennings announced \"Black Ribbons: The Living Album\" on his Twitter account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ShooterJennings |title=Shooter Jennings (ShooterJennings) on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2014-06-03 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}</ref> The \"Living Album\" includes the full studio record and live shows with [[Hierophant]] on a [[USB flash drive]] shaped like a tarot card.\nTowards the end of 2010, Jennings with the help of various other artists launched the \"XXX\" movement to help musicians who struggle to receive mainstream recognition.\n\n=== ''Family Man'' ===\nIn 2011, along with childhood friend and master pianist Erik Deutsch, Jennings formed The Triple Crown, a new backing band featuring Erik Deutsch on piano, Tony Leone on drums, Jeff Hill on bass, Jon Graboff on pedal steel, Eleanor Whitmore on fiddle and Chris Masterson on lead guitar.\n\nOn March 13, 2012, having signed a record deal with [[E1 Music]], and with The Triple Crown along for the ride, Jennings returned to his country roots with the release of the album ''Family Man'', his first self-produced outing. The album was originally meant to contain eighteen tracks, but was instead split into two albums: ''Family Man'' and 2013's ''The Other Life''.\n\nOn July 31, 2012 Jennings was featured in [[Bucky Covington]]'s debut single \"The Drinking Side of Country\" from the album ''Good Guys''.\n\nJennings took part in the February 25 Johnny Cash 80th Birthday Bash, in which he sang [[Cocaine Blues]] With [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Amy Nelson]]. The performance was released in a DVD/CD combo.\n\nIn October 2012 Jennings was one of six commentators for the Ovation mini-series ''Song By Song: Johnny Cash''.\n\n=== ''The Other Life'' ===\nWhile recording ''Family Man'', Jennings decided to cut the darker tracks from the album, and instead use them for the album's follow-up, ''The Other Life''.\n\n\"Five of these songs were recorded when we were doing ''Family Man'', and when we were deciding what to do with it we broke it up into two records. ''The Other Life'' is representative of the other side of the coin from ''Family Man'' and the way my life has been going in a lot of ways, At first we were going to call it ''The Outsider'', but once we got into the film we thought, 'Well, it's like a mirror, a dark mirror of what ''Family Man'' was.'&thinsp;\" - Jennings told TheBoot.com.\n\nJennings premiered the track \"Wild & Lonesome\" (featuring [[Patti Griffin]]) on the 4th season of the FX original series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]''. Followed by the release of first official single from the album \"The White Trash Song\" (featuring [[Scott H. Biram]]) which premiered on RollingStones.com along with the announcement that the album would be accompanied by a film.\n\nThe album featured seven new songs, as well as two cover songs ([[Harry Nilsson]]'s \"Flying Saucer song\" and [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]]'s \"The White Trash song\") and \"Outlaw You\", which was put out in early 2012 as a digital release.\n\nJennings along with filmmaker Blake Judd released ''The Other Life'' film. Running at 32 minutes long, it utilizes six of the songs from the album as a sort of narration. The film is about a musician leaving his family to tour, but when he does so he finds the road is not the same, and becomes haunted by a mysterious woman. Throughout the film, the musician is forced to face his darker urges and deal with self-discovery, temptation, isolation and rebirth. The film closes with a short adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]''.\n\nThe Other Life went on to win Best Short Film at the 2013 Horror Hound Festival.\n\n=== Black Country Rock Media ===\n{{main|Black Country Rock Media}}\nOn October 2013, Jennings announced the formation of his new label and multi-format recording company, Black Country Rock. Their initial releases included: a remastered release of the [[Waylon Jennings]] album ''[[Right for the Time]]'', two live albums (one from [[Jessi Colter]] titled ''Live from Cain's Ballroom'', and one from Jennings titled ''The Other Live''), as well as a recording of \"[[You Are My Sunshine]]\" featuring vocals from both [[Jamey Johnson]] and Jennings. All four were released on vinyl, cassette, CD, as well as digitally.\n\n=== ''The Magic'' ===\nOn February 27, 2014, Jennings revealed he would be releasing a spoken word follow-up to Hierophant's 2010 album, ''[[Black Ribbons]]'', titled ''The Magic'', inspired by first story in the controversially interactive horror series thirteen.\n\nIn addition to ''The Magic'' Jennings also announced, that after nearly a decade of waiting, he would be releasing the 1995 collaborative album,  ''Fenixon''.\n\nBoth projects were released during 2014's Record Store Day, and subsequently sold out.\n\n=== \"George/Giorgio\" releases ===\nTowards the end of May 2014, Jennings announced his intention to release two EP's later in the year. ''Don't Wait Up (for George)'' is a tribute to his close friend and mentor [[George Jones]], which was released in August 2014. Jennings' seventh studio album, ''[[Countach (For Giorgio)]]'', was originally scheduled to be released in November 2014, but its release was delayed due to the sudden death of [[Jon Hensley (radio personality)|Jon Hensley]], Jennings' longtime manager and friend and Black Country Rock co-founder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/how-daft-punk-and-the-muppets-inspired-shooter-jennings-giorgio-moroder-tribute-album-6616503 |title=How Daft Punk and the Muppets Inspired Shooter Jennings' Giorgio Moroder Tribute Album |first=Daniel |last=Kohn |work=[[LA Weekly]] |publisher=[[Voice Media Group]] |date=February 23, 2016 |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> A tribute to 1970s electronic-music pioneer and producer, [[Giorgio Moroder]], the album was released on February 26, 2016 and features guest vocals from [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/6882805/shooter-jennings-giorgio-moroder-tribute-album-countach-david-bowie-interview |title=Shooter Jennings on Giorgio Moroder Tribute Album & How His David Bowie Cover 'Ended Up Meaning So Much More' |first=Chuck |last=Dauphin |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=February 19, 2016 |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> [[Brandi Carlile]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/shooter-jennings-enlists-marilyn-manson-brandi-carlile-for-countach-20160104 |title=Shooter Jennings Enlists Marilyn Manson, Brandi Carlile for 'Countach' |first=Andrew |last=Leahey |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=January 4, 2016 |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> [[Marilyn Manson]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/02/marilyn-manson-covers-the-hell-out-of-david-bowies-cat-people-listen/ |title=Marilyn Manson covers the hell out of David Bowie's \"Cat People\" \u2014 listen |first=Ben |last=Kaye |work=[[Consequence of Sound]] |date=February 18, 2016 |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> and [[Richard Garriott|Richard Garriott de Cayeux]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/neon-noir-meets-outlaw-country-shooter-jennings-tr-230314 |title=Neon noir meets outlaw country in Shooter Jennings' tribute to Giorgio Moroder |first=Mike |last=Vanderbilt |work=[[The A.V.

The only son of country music singers [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Jessi Colter]], he has been active since 1996, releasing seven albums and numerous EPs. He also has made some appearances and cameos in films. Jennings is active mainly in [[outlaw country]] and [[Southern rock]] genres.\n\nJennings made his debut with the single \"4th of July\" of his 2005 album ''[[Put the \"O\" Back in Country]]'' on  [[Universal South Records|Universal South]], which peaked at No.&nbsp;22 on the Billboard country charts.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Shooter Jennings - Chart history {{!}} Billboard|url = http://www.billboard.com/artist/279176/shooter-jennings/chart?f=320|website = www.billboard.com|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}</ref> Jennings has since followed with six more full-length studio albums: ''[[Electric Rodeo (Shooter Jennings album)|Electric Rodeo]]'' (2006), ''[[The Wolf (Shooter Jennings album)|The Wolf]]'' (2007), ''[[Black Ribbons]]'' (2009), ''Family Man'' (2012), ''The Other Life'' (2013) and ''[[Countach (For Giorgio)]]'' (2016), in addition to a live album, a compilation, and numerous [[Extended play|EPs]].\n\nIn 2018 Jennings released his eighth album called ''Shooter'', under [[Dave Cobb]]\u2019s [[Low Country Sound]] imprint label.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/lists/2018-country-music-preview-30-most-anticipated-albums-tours-w514999/shooter-jennings-shooter-w515082|title= 30 Most Anticipated Albums Shooter Jennings\u2019s Shooter|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2018-04-07}}</ref>\n\n== Musical career ==\n=== Early life ===\nJennings was born in Nashville, Tennessee on May 19, 1979. There are two different accounts regarding how he got his nickname \"Shooter\". His mother cited her, and husband Waylon Jennings', love of western culture and cowboy art for inspiring the gun-derived moniker. But his father said he came up with the name when, moments after the newborn emerged from his mother's womb, the boy sprayed a nurse before anyone could put on his first diaper. \u201cI love my mom,\u201d says Jennings, \u201cbut I like Dad\u2019s version better. And I believe it\u2019s true. He didn\u2019t make [stuff] like that up.\"\n\nHe lived the first few years of his life in a crib on his parents' tour bus surrounded by the likes of [[Johnny Cash]], [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. By age five, he was playing drums. At 8 years old, he began taking piano lessons. He started playing guitar at fourteen and on occasion he'd play percussion in his father's band.\n\nIn high school Jennings fronted an industrial rock band called KilRaven for his high school's talent show. In 2011, he released the KilRaven track \"Only You\" on the album \"Missed The Boat\".\n\nIn 1996, Jennings and his father recorded an album together. They called it ''Fenixon'' (a play on the words \"phoenix\" and \"sun\") but could not find a label to distribute it.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Waylon and Son, Reunited on Disc|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122471459623460261|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-11-21|issn = 0099-9660|first = Jim|last = Fusilli}}</ref> Some of the material was remastered and used for the album ''Waylon Forever''. The full ''Fenixon'' recording was finally released by Jennings' label Black Country Rock in 2014.\n\n=== Stargunn ===\nIn 2001, Jennings left [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to seek his fortunes in [[Los Angeles]]. He assembled and performed with Stargunn, a [[rock music|rock]] band. The band featured Jennings on piano and lead vocals, Carter Falco, and Kevin Sciou on guitar and background vocals, Curtis Roach on bass, and Lex Lipsitz on drums.\n\nTowards the end of 2001, Stargunn released their first album ''The Only Way Up Is Down'' and toured with [[Saliva (band)|Saliva]], [[Tesla (band)|Tesla]], Mark Ford and others in support of the album. That same year ''Music Connection'' magazine listed Stargunn as one of the Hot 100 Unsigned Artists of 2001.\n\nIn 2002 Stargunn was featured on ''I've Always Been Crazy: A Tribute to Waylon Jennings'', and the soundtrack to the [[Vince Vaughn]] film ''[[Made (2001 film)|Made]]''. Shortly after, [[Touchstone Pictures]] licensed the song \"White Lines N Black Ties\" for the film ''[[The Crew (2000 film)|The Crew]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]].\n\nStargunn performed together for three years, built an avid following, and earned praise from the local music press. On March 30, 2003, Jennings dissolved Stargunn and began working on his solo career.\n\n\nAfter the band's breakup, Jennings was twice presented with the opportunity to front the hard rock supergroup [[Velvet Revolver]], but chose instead to pursue a career in country music.<ref>{{Cite web|title = SHOOTER JENNINGS Claims He Was Offered VELVET REVOLVER Job Twice|url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/shooter-jennings-claims-he-was-offered-velvet-revolver-job-twice/|website = BLABBERMOUTH.NET|date = 2009-03-19|accessdate = 2015-11-21|language = en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Jennings' label Black Country Rock released Stargunn's debut album \"The Only Way Up Is Down\" on vinyl as part of Record Store Day.\n\n=== ''Put the \"O\" Back in Country'' ===\nHe returned to Los Angeles in 2004 to begin working on new material. In 2005 Jennings signed his first recording contract, with [[Universal South Records]], releasing his debut album ''[[Put the \"O\" Back in Country]]'' that same year.\n\n\"Put the \"O\" Back in Country\" produced his only entry on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts in its lead-off single \"Fourth of July\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;22. The album version of this song features a cameo appearance by George Jones, who sings the chorus to his signature song \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" at the end; this guest appearance was removed from the song's radio edit. Despite the edit, Jones was credited on the Billboard charts. The album featured his new band The .357's, which consisted of Leroy Powell on guitar, Bryan Keeling on drums, [[Ted Russell Kamp|Ted Kamp]] on bass with [[Robby Turner]] on steel, and backing vocals by [[Bonnie Bramlett]].\n\nLater that year his song \"Busted In Baylor County\" was then featured in the 2005 film version of ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', furthermore Jennings portrayed his father in the [[Johnny Cash]] [[Biographical film|biopic]] ''[[Walk the Line]]'' alongside [[Joaquin Phoenix]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]]. His rendition of his father's song \"Long Way From Home\" was featured on the film's soundtrack.\n\n=== ''Electric Rodeo'' and ''The Wolf'' ===\nThough recorded before ''Put the \"O\" Back in Country'', released on April 4, 2006,{{clarify|reason=is this the release date of Put the O Back in Country or the release date of Electric Rodeo?|date=April 2017}} ''[[Electric Rodeo (Shooter Jennings album)|Electric Rodeo]]'' was released as Jennings's second solo album. Sonically, ''Electric Rodeo'' is louder, rawer, more upfront rock and roll than its predecessor.\n\n''Electric Rodeo'' was followed by ''[[The Wolf (Shooter Jennings album)|The Wolf]]'' on October 23, 2007. The album varied from his previous records in that the .357s had opted for a decidedly 1970s feel to the instrumentals. It featured collaborations with [[Doug Kershaw]] and [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], as well as a cover of the [[Dire Straits]] song \"[[Walk of Life]]\".\n\nThat same year Jennings was featured on a duet of \"[[Good Hearted Woman (song)|Good Hearted Woman]]\" on [[Deana Carter]]'s sixth studio album, ''[[The Chain (Deana Carter album)|The Chain]]''.\n\n=== Departure from Universal ===\nIn 2009, Jennings, having issues with his label and wanting out of his four-album contract released his first compilation album, ''[[Bad Magick: The Best of Shooter Jennings and the .357's]]''. The album featured four new tracks; live versions of \"Lonesome Blues\", and \"Daddy's Farm\", as well as covers of his father's \"Lonesome, Onry and Mean\", and the [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] song \"Living Proof\".\n\nAfter the release of ''Bad Magick: The Best of Shooter Jennings and the .357's'', having fulfilled his four-album contract; Jennings parted ways with Universal records.\n\nOn March 23, 2009 Jennings took part in ''[[CMT Crossroads]]'', a television show in which two musicians are paired with one another and perform a small concert together for an intimate crowd. The episode paired Jennings with close friend and fellow musician [[Jamey Johnson]]. The evening's set list consisted entirely of duets, including a cover of \"Outlaw Shit\" from the ''[[Waylon Forever]]'' album, two songs from Jennings' discography; \"God Bless Alabama\", \"It Ain't Easy\". As well as four songs from Johnson's album ''[[That Lonesome Song]]''; \"High Cost Of Living\", \"Mowing Down The Roses\", \"Between Jennings and Jones\" and \"In Color\".\n\n=== ''Black Ribbons'' ===\nHaving left Universal, Jennings changed the name of his backing band from The .357's to Hierophant. With the news that he and his band would be joining the likes of [[Paramore]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Jefree Star]], and various other popular rock bands on the 2009 [[Warped Tour]] it became apparent that Jennings next album would differ drastically from his previous efforts.\n\nIn February 2009, it was announced that the album would be titled ''[[Black Ribbons]]''. It was also announced that it would be a dystopian concept rock opera and that writer [[Stephen King]] would play a major role in the album as Will O' The Wisp.\n\nIt was released independently on March 2, 2010 through Black Country Rock Records, and although it was seen as a complete departure from his country sound, the album showed off the diversity as an artist and gained him much critical acclaim, as well as a brand new underground following.\n\nOn May 1, 2010, Jennings announced \"Black Ribbons: The Living Album\" on his Twitter account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ShooterJennings |title=Shooter Jennings (ShooterJennings) on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2014-06-03 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}</ref> The \"Living Album\" includes the full studio record and live shows with [[Hierophant]] on a [[USB flash drive]] shaped like a tarot card.\nTowards the end of 2010, Jennings with the help of various other artists launched the \"XXX\" movement to help musicians who struggle to receive mainstream recognition.\n\n=== ''Family Man'' ===\nIn 2011, along with childhood friend and master pianist Erik Deutsch, Jennings formed The Triple Crown, a new backing band featuring Erik Deutsch on piano, Tony Leone on drums, Jeff Hill on bass, Jon Graboff on pedal steel, Eleanor Whitmore on fiddle and Chris Masterson on lead guitar.\n\nOn March 13, 2012, having signed a record deal with [[E1 Music]], and with The Triple Crown along for the ride, Jennings returned to his country roots with the release of the album ''Family Man'', his first self-produced outing. The album was originally meant to contain eighteen tracks, but was instead split into two albums: ''Family Man'' and 2013's ''The Other Life''.\n\nOn July 31, 2012 Jennings was featured in [[Bucky Covington]]'s debut single \"The Drinking Side of Country\" from the album ''Good Guys''.\n\nJennings took part in the February 25 Johnny Cash 80th Birthday Bash, in which he sang [[Cocaine Blues]] With [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Amy Nelson]]. The performance was released in a DVD/CD combo.\n\nIn October 2012 Jennings was one of six commentators for the Ovation mini-series ''Song By Song: Johnny Cash''.\n\n=== ''The Other Life'' ===\nWhile recording ''Family Man'', Jennings decided to cut the darker tracks from the album, and instead use them for the album's follow-up, ''The Other Life''.\n\n\"Five of these songs were recorded when we were doing ''Family Man'', and when we were deciding what to do with it we broke it up into two records. ''The Other Life'' is representative of the other side of the coin from ''Family Man'' and the way my life has been going in a lot of ways, At first we were going to call it ''The Outsider'', but once we got into the film we thought, 'Well, it's like a mirror, a dark mirror of what ''Family Man'' was.'&thinsp;\" - Jennings told TheBoot.com.\n\nJennings premiered the track \"Wild & Lonesome\" (featuring [[Patti Griffin]]) on the 4th season of the FX original series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]''. Followed by the release of first official single from the album \"The White Trash Song\" (featuring [[Scott H. Biram]]) which premiered on RollingStones.com along with the announcement that the album would be accompanied by a film.\n\nThe album featured seven new songs, as well as two cover songs ([[Harry Nilsson]]'s \"Flying Saucer song\" and [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]]'s \"The White Trash song\") and \"Outlaw You\", which was put out in early 2012 as a digital release.\n\nJennings along with filmmaker Blake Judd released ''The Other Life'' film. Running at 32 minutes long, it utilizes six of the songs from the album as a sort of narration. The film is about a musician leaving his family to tour, but when he does so he finds the road is not the same, and becomes haunted by a mysterious woman. Throughout the film, the musician is forced to face his darker urges and deal with self-discovery, temptation, isolation and rebirth. The film closes with a short adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]''.\n\nThe Other Life went on to win Best Short Film at the 2013 Horror Hound Festival.\n\n=== Black Country Rock Media ===\n{{main|Black Country Rock Media}}\nOn October 2013, Jennings announced the formation of his new label and multi-format recording company, Black Country Rock. Their initial releases included: a remastered release of the [[Waylon Jennings]] album ''[[Right for the Time]]'', two live albums (one from [[Jessi Colter]] titled ''Live from Cain's Ballroom'', and one from Jennings titled ''The Other Live''), as well as a recording of \"[[You Are My Sunshine]]\" featuring vocals from both [[Jamey Johnson]] and Jennings. All four were released on vinyl, cassette, CD, as well as digitally.\n\n=== ''The Magic'' ===\nOn February 27, 2014, Jennings revealed he would be releasing a spoken word follow-up to Hierophant's 2010 album, ''[[Black Ribbons]]'', titled ''The Magic'', inspired by first story in the controversially interactive horror series thirteen.\n\nIn addition to ''The Magic'' Jennings also announced, that after nearly a decade of waiting, he would be releasing the 1995 collaborative album,  ''Fenixon''.\n\nBoth projects were released during 2014's Record Store Day, and subsequently sold out.\n\n=== \"George/Giorgio\" releases ===\nTowards the end of May 2014, Jennings announced his intention to release two EP's later in the year. ''Don't Wait Up (for George)'' is a tribute to his close friend and mentor [[George Jones]], which was released in August 2014. Jennings' seventh studio album, ''[[Countach (For Giorgio)]]'', was originally scheduled to be released in November 2014, but its release was delayed due to the sudden death of [[Jon Hensley (radio personality)|Jon Hensley]], Jennings' longtime manager and friend and Black Country Rock co-founder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/how-daft-punk-and-the-muppets-inspired-shooter-jennings-giorgio-moroder-tribute-album-6616503 |title=How Daft Punk and the Muppets Inspired Shooter Jennings' Giorgio Moroder Tribute Album |first=Daniel |last=Kohn |work=[[LA Weekly]] |publisher=[[Voice Media Group]] |date=February 23, 2016 |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> A tribute to 1970s electronic-music pioneer and producer, [[Giorgio Moroder]], the album was released on February 26, 2016 and features guest vocals from [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/6882805/shooter-jennings-giorgio-moroder-tribute-album-countach-david-bowie-interview |title=Shooter Jennings on Giorgio Moroder Tribute Album & How His David Bowie Cover 'Ended Up Meaning So Much More' |first=Chuck |last=Dauphin |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=February 19, 2016 |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> [[Brandi Carlile]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/shooter-jennings-enlists-marilyn-manson-brandi-carlile-for-countach-20160104 |title=Shooter Jennings Enlists Marilyn Manson, Brandi Carlile for 'Countach' |first=Andrew |last=Leahey |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=January 4, 2016 |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> [[Marilyn Manson]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/02/marilyn-manson-covers-the-hell-out-of-david-bowies-cat-people-listen/ |title=Marilyn Manson covers the hell out of David Bowie's \"Cat People\" \u2014 listen |first=Ben |last=Kaye |work=[[Consequence of Sound]] |date=February 18, 2016 |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> and [[Richard Garriott|Richard Garriott de Cayeux]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/neon-noir-meets-outlaw-country-shooter-jennings-tr-230314 |title=Neon noir meets outlaw country in Shooter Jennings' tribute to Giorgio Moroder |first=Mike |last=Vanderbilt |work=[[The A.V.

[[Nationalism]] emerged as a uniting ideology not only between competing powers, but also for groups that felt subordinated or disenfranchised inside larger states; in this situation, self-determination can be seen as a reaction to imperialism.  Such groups often pursued independence and sovereignty over territory, but sometimes a different sense of autonomy has been pursued or achieved.\n\n==== Empires ====\n\nThe world possessed several traditional, continental empires such as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]], [[Austrian Empire|Austrian/Habsburg]], and the [[Qing Empire]].  Political scientists often define competition in Europe during the [[Modern Era]] as a [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] struggle, which also induced various European states to pursue colonial empires, beginning with the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], and later including the [[British Empire|British]], [[French colonial empire|French]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], and [[German colonial empire|German]].\nDuring the early 19th century, competition in Europe produced multiple wars, most notably the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  After this conflict, the British Empire became dominant and entered its [[Britain's Imperial Century|\"imperial century\"]], while nationalism became a powerful political ideology in Europe.\n\nLater, after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870, \"[[New Imperialism]]\" was unleashed with [[Second French colonial empire|France]] and later [[German colonial empire|Germany]] establishing colonies in Asia, the Pacific, and Africa.  Japan also emerged as a new power.  Multiple theaters of competition developed across the world:\n\n* Africa: multiple European states competed for colonies in the \"[[Scramble for Africa]]\";\n* Central Asia: [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[British Empire|Britain]] competed for domination in the \"[[Great Game]]\"\n* Eastern Asia: colonies and various [[spheres of influence]] were established, largely to the detriment of the [[Qing Empire]].\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, Austrian Empire, Russian Empire, Qing Empire and the new [[Empire of Japan]] maintained themselves, often expanding or contracting at the expense of another empire.  All ignored notions of self-determination for those governed.<ref>Jackson J. Spielvogel, ''Western Civilization: Since 1500 '', [https://books.google.com/books?id=fwxLkRmd-4QC&pg=PT421 p. 767], Cengage Learning, 2008, {{ISBN|0-495-50287-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-495-50287-6}}.</ref>\n\n==== Rebellions and emergence of nationalism ====\n{{Nationalism sidebar |Core}}\nThe revolt of [[New World]] British colonists in North America, during the mid-1770s, has been seen as the first assertion of the right of national and democratic self-determination, because of the explicit invocation of natural law, the natural rights of man, as well as the consent of, and sovereignty by, the people governed; these ideas were inspired particularly by [[John Locke]]'s [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened]] writings of the previous century. [[Thomas Jefferson]] further promoted the notion that the will of the people was supreme, especially through authorship of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] which inspired Europeans throughout the 19th century.<ref name=\"Unterberger\" /> The French Revolution was motivated similarly and legitimatized the ideas of self-determination on that [[Old World]] continent.<ref>Chim\u00e8ne Keitner, [[Oxford University]], [http://www.ciaonet.org/isa/woc01/National Self-Determination: The Legacy of the French Revolution], paper presented at International Studies Association Annual Meeting, March 2000.</ref><ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B16FD3D5C147A93C2AB178CD85F4D8185F9 \"Self-Determination Not a New Expedient; First Plebiscite Was Held in Avignon During the French Revolution\u2014Forthcoming Book Traces History and Growth of the Movement\"], ''[[New York Times]]'', July 20, 1919, 69.</ref>\n\nWithin the New World during the early 19th century, most of the nations of [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] achieved [[Spanish American wars of independence|independence from Spain]]. The United States supported that status, as policy in the hemisphere relative to European colonialism, with the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. The American public, organized associated groups, and Congressional resolutions, often supported such movements, particularly the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821\u201329) and the [[12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848|demands of Hungarian revolutionaries in 1848]]. Such support, however, never became official government policy, due to balancing of other [[national interests]]. After the [[American Civil War]] and with increasing capability, the United States government did not accept self-determination as a basis during its [[Purchase of Alaska]] and attempted purchase of the West Indian islands of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]] and [[St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint John]] in the 1860s, or its growing influence in the [[Hawaii]]an Islands, that led to annexation in 1898. With its victory in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1899 and its growing stature in the world, the United States supported annexation of the former Spanish colonies of [[Guam]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the Philippines, without the consent of their peoples, and it retained \"quasi-[[suzerainty]]\" over Cuba, as well.<ref name=\"Unterberger\" />\n\nNationalist sentiments emerged inside the traditional empires including: [[Pan-Slavism]] in Russia; [[Ottomanism]], [[Kemalist ideology]] and [[Arab nationalism]] in the Ottoman Empire; [[State Shintoism]] and [[Japanese nationalism|Japanese identity]] in Japan; and [[Chinese nationalism|Han identity]] in juxtaposition to the [[Manchu people|Manchurian ruling class]] in China. Meanwhile, in Europe itself there was a [[Rise of nationalism in Europe|rise of nationalism]], with nations such as [[Greek War of Independence|Greece]], [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungary]], [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|Poland]] and [[Bulgarian unification|Bulgaria]] seeking or winning their independence.\n\n[[Karl Marx]] supported such nationalism, believing it might be a \"prior condition\" to social reform and international alliances.<ref>Erica Benner, \u2018\u2019Really existing nationalisms: a post-communist view from Marx and Engels\u2019\u2018, [https://books.google.com/books?id=N-7Xc8WtCLgC&pg=PA188&dq=%22self-determination%22+of+colonies+marx&ei=HLAGS6bRHafgyASj-_2_Dw#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 188], Oxford University Press, 1995 {{ISBN|0-19-827959-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-827959-4}}</ref> In 1914 [[Vladimir Lenin]] wrote: \"[It] would be wrong to interpret the right to self-determination as meaning anything but the right to existence as a separate state.\"<ref name=\"Lenin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/self-det/ch01.htm#v20pp72-395 |title=What Is Meant By The Self-Determination of Nations? |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref>\n\n=== World Wars I and II ===\n\n==== Europe, Asia and Africa ====\n\n[[File:Map Europe 1923-en.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Map of [[Aftermath of World War I|territorial changes]] in Europe after World War I (as of 1923)]]\n\n[[File:Decolonization - World In 1945 en.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|Map of the world in 1945, showing [[United Nations Trusteeship Council]] territories in green<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/world45.pdf |title=The World in 1945 |date=May 2010 |work=United nations |accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref>]]\n\n[[Woodrow Wilson]] revived America's commitment to self-determination, at least for European states, during World War I. When the [[Bolsheviks]] came to power in Russia in November 1917, they called for Russia's immediate withdrawal as a member of the [[Allies of World War I]]. They also supported the right of all nations, including colonies, to self-determination.\"<ref name=\"Lenin\" /> The 1918 [[1918 Soviet Constitution|Constitution of the Soviet Union]] acknowledged the right of [[secession]] for its constituent republics.<ref name=\"Unterberger\" />\n\nThis presented a challenge to Wilson's more limited demands. In January 1918 Wilson issued his [[Fourteen Points]] of January 1918 which, among other things, called for adjustment of colonial claims, insofar as the interests of colonial powers had equal weight with the claims of subject peoples.<ref name=\"Unterberger\" /> The [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] in March 1918 led to Soviet Russia's exit from the war and the nominal independence of Armenia, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Georgia and Poland, though in fact those territories were under German control. The end of the war led to the dissolution of the defeated [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and [[Czechoslovakia]] and the union of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] as new states out of the wreckage of the Habsburg empire. However, this imposition of states where some nationalities (especially Poles, Czechs, and Serbs and [[Romanians]]) were given power over nationalities who disliked and distrusted them eventually used as a pretext for German aggression in World War II.\n\nWilson publicly argued that the agreements made in the aftermath of the war would be a \"readjustment of those great injustices which underlie the whole structure of European and Asiatic society\", which he attributed to the absence of democratic rule. The new order emerging in the postwar period would, according to Wilson, place governments \"in the hands of the people and taken out of the hands of coteries and of sovereigns, who had to right to rule over the people.\" The [[League of Nations]] was established as the symbol of the emerging postwar order; one of its earliest tasks was to legitimize the territorial boundaries of the new nations-states created in the territories of the former [[Ottoman Empire]], Asia, and Africa. The principle of self-determination did not extend so far as to end colonialism; under the reasoning that the local populations were not civilized enough the League of Nations was to assign each of the post-Ottoman, Asian and African states and colonies to a European power by the grant of a [[League of Nations mandate]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Fezzes in the River |author=Sarah D. Shields |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\nOne of the German objections to the Treaty of Versailles was a somewhat selective application of the principle of self-determination as the majority of the people in Austria and in the [[Sudetenland]] region of Czechoslovakia wanted to join Germany while the majority of people in Danzig wanted to remain within the ''Reich'', but the Allies ignored the German objections. Wilson's 14 Points had called for Polish independence to be restored and Poland to have \"secure access to the sea\", which would imply that the German city of Danzig (modern Gda\u0144sk, Poland), which occupied a strategic location where the Vistula river flowed into the Baltic sea, be ceded to Poland.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 211\">Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 211.</ref>  At the Paris peace conference in 1919, the Polish delegation led by [[Roman Dmowski]] asked for Wilson to honor point 14 of the 14 points by transferring Danzig to Poland. arguing that Poland would not be economically viable without Danzig.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 211\"/> However, as the 90% of the people in Danzig in this period were German, the Allied leaders at the Paris peace conference compromised by creating the [[Free City of Danzig]], a city-state in which Poland had certain special rights.<ref>Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 218.</ref> Through the city of Danzig was 90% German and 10% Polish, the surrounding countryside around Danzig was overwhelmingly Polish, and the ethnically Polish rural areas included in the Free City of Danzig objected, arguing that they wanted to be part of Poland.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 211\"/> Neither the Poles nor the Germans were happy with this compromise and the Danzig issue became a flash-point of German-Polish tension throughout the interwar period.<ref>Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 219.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s there were some successful movements for self-determination in the beginnings of the process of [[decolonization]]. In the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] the United Kingdom granted independence to Canada, New Zealand, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], the [[Irish Free State]], the Commonwealth of Australia, and the [[Union of South Africa]] after the [[British parliament]] declared itself as incapable of passing laws over them without their consent. Egypt, Afghanistan and Iraq also achieved independence from Britain and Lebanon from France. Other efforts were unsuccessful, like the [[Indian independence movement]]. And Italy, Japan and Germany all initiated new efforts to bring certain territories under their control, leading to World War II. In particular, the [[National Socialist Program]] invoked this right of nations in its first point (out of 25), as it was publicly proclaimed on 24 February 1920 by [[Adolf Hitler]].\n\nIn Asia, Japan became a rising power and gained more respect from Western powers after its victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]].  Japan joined the Allied Powers in World War I and [[Japan during World War I|attacked German colonial possessions]] in the Far East, adding former German possessions to its own empire.  In the 1930s, Japan gained significant influence in [[Inner Mongolia]] and [[Manchuria]] after it [[Mukden Incident|invaded Manchuria]].  It established [[Manchukuo]], a [[puppet state]] in Manchuria and eastern Inner Mongolia. This was essentially the model Japan followed as it invaded other areas in Asia and established the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. Japan went to considerable trouble to argue that Manchukuo was justified by the principle of self-determination, claiming that people of Manchuria wanted to break away from China and asked the [[Kwantung Army]] to intervene on their behalf. However, the Lytton commission which had been appointed by the League of Nations to decide if Japan had committed aggression or not, stated the majority of people in Manchuria who were Han Chinese who did not wish to leave China.\n\nIn 1912, the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] officially [[successor state|succeeded]] the Qing Dynasty, while [[Outer Mongolia]], [[Tibet (1912\u20131951)|Tibet]] and [[Tannu Uriankhai|Tuva]] proclaimed their independence. Independence was not accepted by the [[Beiyang government|government of China]]. By the [[Treaty of Kyakhta (1915)]] [[Outer Mongolia, 1911-1919|Outer Mongolia]] recognized China's sovereignty. However, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat of seizing parts of Inner Mongolia induced China to recognize [[Mongolian People's Republic|Outer Mongolia's independence]], provided that a referendum was held. The referendum took place on October 20, 1945, with (according to official numbers) 100% of the electorate voting for independence.\n\nMany of Eastern Asia's current disputes to sovereignty and self-determination stem from unresolved disputes from World War II.  After its fall, the [[Empire of Japan]] renounced control over many of its former possessions including Korea, [[Sakhalin Island]], and [[Taiwan]].  In none of these areas were the opinions of affected people consulted, or given significant priority. Korea was specifically granted independence but the receiver of various other areas was not stated in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]], giving Taiwan ''de facto'' independence although its political status continues to be ambiguous.\n\n=== The Cold War world ===\n\n==== The UN Charter and resolutions====\n\nIn 1941 [[Allies of World War II]] declared the [[Atlantic Charter]] and accepted the principle of self-determination. In January 1942 twenty-six states signed the [[Declaration by United Nations]], which accepted those principles. The ratification of the United Nations Charter in 1945 at the end of World War II placed the right of self-determination into the framework of international law and diplomacy.\n\n* Chapter 1, Article 1, part 2 states that purpose of the UN Charter is: \"To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/ |title=United Nations Charter |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-08}}</ref>\n* Article 1 in both the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |title=Text of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |publisher=.ohchr.org |accessdate=2012-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303001412/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |archivedate=March 3, 2012 }}</ref> and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm |title=Text of International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights |publisher=.ohchr.org |accessdate=2012-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303114220/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm |archivedate=March 3, 2012 }}</ref> reads: \"All peoples have the right of self-determination.

[[People's Republic of Tuva|Tuva]] and several regional states in [[Eastern Europe]], the Baltic, and Central Asia had been fully annexed by the Soviet Union during World War II. Now, it extended its influence by establishing the [[satellite states]] of Eastern Germany and the countries of Eastern Europe, along with support for revolutionary movements in China and North Korea. Although satellite states were independent and possessed sovereignty, the Soviet Union violated principles of self-determination by suppressing the [[Hungarian revolution of 1956]] and the [[Prague Spring]] Czechoslovak reforms of 1968. It [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|invaded Afghanistan]] to support a communist government assailed by local tribal groups.<ref name=\"Unterberger\" /> However, [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] and its theory of imperialism were also strong influences in the national emancipation movements of [[Third World]] nations rebelling against colonial or puppet regimes. In many [[Third World]] countries, communism became an ideology that united groups to oppose imperialism or colonization.\n\nSoviet actions were [[Containment|contained]] by the United States which saw communism as a menace to its interests. Throughout the cold war, the United States created, supported, and sponsored regimes with various success that served their economic and political interests, among them [[anti-communist]] regimes such as that of [[Augusto Pinochet]] in [[Chile]] and [[Suharto]] in [[Indonesia]]. To achieve this, a variety of means was implemented, including the orchestration of coups, sponsoring of anti-communist countries and military interventions. Consequently, many self-determination movements, which spurned some type of anti-communist government, were accused of being Soviet-inspired or controlled.<ref name=\"Unterberger\" />\n\n==== Asia ====\nIn Asia, the Soviet Union had already converted Mongolia into a satellite state but abandoned propping up the [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] and gave up its [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|Manchurian claims]] to China. The new [[People's Republic of China]] had gained control of mainland China in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. The [[Korean War]] shifted the focus of the Cold War from Europe to Asia, where competing superpowers took advantage of [[decolonization]] to spread their influence.\n\nIn 1947, India gained independence from the [[British Empire]]. The empire was in decline but adapted to these circumstances by creating the British Commonwealth\u2014since 1949 the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]\u2014which is a free association of equal states.  As India obtained its independence, multiple ethnic conflicts emerged in relation to the formation of a statehood during the [[Partition of India]] which resulted in Islamic Pakistan and Secular India. Before the [[British Raj|advent of the British]], no empire based in mainland India had controlled any part of what now makes up the country's Northeast, part of the reason for the ongoing [[insurgency in Northeast India]].<ref>http://www.apcss.org/Publications/Edited%20Volumes/ReligiousRadicalism/PagesfromReligiousRadicalismandSecurityinSouthAsiach10.pdf p. 220</ref> In 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladesh obtained independence]] from Pakistan.\n\nBurma also gained independence from the British Empire, but declined membership in the Commonwealth.\n\nIndonesia gained independence from the Netherlands in 1949 after the latter failed to restore colonial control.  As mentioned above, Indonesia also wanted a powerful position in the region that could be lessened by the creation of united [[Malaysia]]. The Netherlands retained [[Dutch New Guinea]], but Indonesia threatened to invade and annex it. A vote was supposedly taken under the UN sponsored [[Act of Free Choice]] to allow West New Guineans to decide their fate, although many dispute its veracity.  Later, Portugal relinquished control over [[East Timor]] in 1975, at which time Indonesia promptly invaded and annexed it.\n\n=== After the Cold War ===\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|upright=1.5|[[List of national border changes since World War I|Changes in national boundaries]] after the end of the Cold War]]\nThe Cold War began to wind down after [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] assumed power in March 1985. With the cooperation of the American president [[Ronald Reagan]], Gorbachev wound down the size of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] and reduced nuclear arms in Europe, while liberalizing the [[economy of the Soviet Union|economy]].\n\nIn 1989 \u2013 90, the communist regimes of Soviet satellite states collapsed in rapid succession in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, and Mongolia.  East and West Germany united, Czechoslovakia peacefully split into [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], while in 1990 Yugoslavia began a [[Yugoslavia#Breakup|violent break up]] into 6 states. [[Kosovo]], which was previously an autonomous unit of Serbia declared independence in 2008, but has received less international recognition.<ref name=\"Unterberger\" />\n\nIn December 1991, Gorbachev resigned as president and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] relatively peacefully into fifteen sovereign republics, all of which rejected communism and most of which adopted democratic reforms and free-market economies.  Inside those new republics, [[Commonwealth of Unrecognized States|four major areas]] have claimed their own independence, but not received widespread international recognition.\n\nAfter decades of civil war, Indonesia finally recognized the independence of [[East Timor]] in 2002.\n\nIn 1949, the [[Communists]] won the civil war and established the [[People's Republic of China]] in Mainland China. The [[Kuomintang]]-led [[Republic of China]] government retreated to [[Taipei]], its jurisdiction now limited to [[Taiwan]] and several outlying islands. Since then, the People's Republic of China has been involved in disputes with the ROC over issues of sovereignty and the political status of Taiwan.\n\nAs noted, self-determination movements remain [[List of active autonomist and secessionist movements|strong in some areas of the world]].  Some areas possess ''de facto'' independence, such as Taiwan, [[North Cyprus]], [[Kosovo]], and [[South Ossetia]], but their independence is disputed by one or more major states. Significant movements for self-determination also persist for locations that lack ''de facto'' independence, such as [[Kurdistan]], [[Balochistan]], [[Chechnya]], and the [[State of Palestine]]\n\n== Current issues ==\n\n[[File:South Sudan Independence Celebration (5963420792).jpg|thumb|[[Southern Sudan]]ese expressed joy and jubilation on their day of independence, July 9, 2011, from Sudan.]]\n\nSince the early 1990s, the legitimatization of the principle of national self-determination has led to an increase in the number of conflicts within states, as sub-groups seek greater self-determination and full secession, and as their conflicts for leadership within groups and with other groups and with the dominant state become violent.<ref>Martin Griffiths, [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MqLJ/2003/3.html Self-determination, International Society And World Order], [[Macquarie University]] Law Journal, 1, 2003.</ref> The international reaction to these new movements has been uneven and often dictated more by politics than principle.

This policy was pursued by the major powers during the Cold War.\n* Liberal internationalism has become an alternative since that time. It promotes the abolition of war among states as well as increased individual liberty within states, and holds the expansion of global markets and cross-border cooperation diminishes the significance of territorial integrity, allowing for somewhat greater recognition of greater self-determination of peoples.\n* Cosmopolitan liberalism calls for political power to shift to a world government which would make secession and change of boundaries a relatively easy administrative matter. However, it also would mean the de facto end of self-determination of national groups.<ref name=\"Pavkovic\" />\n\n[[File:2014-05-11. \u0420\u0435\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u043c \u0432 \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0435 011.jpg|thumb|[[2014 Donetsk and Luhansk status referendums|Donetsk status referendum]] organized by separatists in [[Ukraine]]. A line to enter a polling place, 11 May 2014]]\n\n[[Allen Buchanan]], author of seven books on self-determination and secession, supports territorial integrity as a moral and legal aspect of constitutional democracy. However, he also advances a \"Remedial Rights Only Theory\" where a group has \"a general right to secede if and only if it has suffered certain injustices, for which secession is the appropriate remedy of last resort. \" He also would recognize secession if the state grants, or the constitution includes, a right to secede.<ref name=\"Gudeleviciute\" />\n\nVita Gudeleviciute holds that in cases of non-self-governing peoples and foreign military occupation the principle of self-determination trumps that of territorial integrity. In cases where people lack representation by a state's government, they also may be considered a separate people, but under current law cannot claim the right to self-determination. On the other hand, she finds that secession within a single state is a domestic matter not covered by international law. Thus there are no on what groups may constitute a seceding people.<ref name=\"Gudeleviciute\" />\n\nA number of states have laid claim to territories, which they allege were removed from them as a result of colonialism.  This is justified by reference to Paragraph 6 of UN Resolution 1514(XV), which states that any attempt \"aimed at partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter\".  This, it is claimed, applies to situations where the territorial integrity of a state had been disrupted by colonisation, so that the people of a territory subject to a historic territorial claim are prevented from exercising a right to self-determination.  This interpretation is rejected by many states, who argue that Paragraph 2 of UN Resolution 1514(XV) states that \"all peoples have the right to self-determination\" and Paragraph 6 cannot be used to justify territorial claims.  The original purpose of Paragraph 6 was \"to ensure that acts of self-determination occur within the established boundaries of colonies, rather than within sub-regions\".  Further, the use of the word ''attempt'' in Paragraph 6 denotes future action and cannot be construed to justify territorial redress for past action.<ref name=\"Musgrave2000\">{{cite book|author=Thomas D.

More limited measures might include restricting demands to the maintenance of national cultures or granting non-territorial autonomy in the form of national associations which would assume control over cultural matters. This would be available only to groups that abandoned secessionist demands and the territorial state would retain political and judicial control, but only if would remain with the territorially organized state.<ref name=\"Pavkovic\" />\n\n=== Self-determination versus majority rule/equal rights ===\n\nPavkovi\u0107 explores how national self-determination, in the form of creation of a new state through secession, could override the principles of [[majority rule]] and of [[Civil rights|equal rights]], which are primary liberal principles. This includes the question of how an unwanted state can be imposed upon a minority. He explores five contemporary theories of secession. In \"anarcho-capitalist\" theory only landowners have the right to secede. In communitarian theory, only those groups that desire direct or greater political participation have the right, including groups deprived of rights, per Allen Buchanan. In two nationalist theories, only national cultural groups have a right to secede. Australian professor Harry Beran's democratic theory endorses the equality of the right of secession to all types of groups. Unilateral secession against majority rule is justified if the group allows secession of any other group within its territory.<ref>Aleksandar Pavkovi\u0107, [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MqLJ/2003/5.html Majority Rule and Equal Rights: a Few Questions], [[Macquarie University]] Law Journal, 1, 2003.</ref><ref>Harry Beran, \"A Democratic Theory of Political Self-Determination for a New World Order\" in Percy Lehning (ed), Theories of Secession (1998) 36, 39, 42 \u2013 43.</ref>\n\n=== Constitutional law ===\n\nMost [[sovereign state]]s do not recognize the right to self-determination through secession in their constitutions.

However, the Party eliminated the right to secession in later years, and had anti-secession clause written into the Constitution before and after the founding the People's Republic of China. The 1947 Constitution of the [[Burma|Union of Burma]] contained an express state right to secede from the union under a number of procedural conditions. It was eliminated in the 1974 constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma (officially the \"Union of Myanmar\"). Burma still allows \"local autonomy under central leadership\".<ref name=\"Kreptul\" />\n\nAs of 1996 the constitutions of Austria, Ethiopia, France, and [[Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Saint Kitts and Nevis]] have express or implied rights to secession. Switzerland allows for the secession from current and the creation of new [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]]. In the case of proposed [[Quebec]] separation from Canada the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in 1998 ruled that only both a clear majority of the province and a constitutional amendment confirmed by all participants in the Canadian federation could allow secession.<ref name=\"Kreptul\" />\n\nThe 2003 draft of the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Union Constitution]] allowed for the voluntary withdrawal of member states from the union, although the State which wanted to leave could not be involved in the vote deciding whether or not they can leave the Union.<ref name=\"Kreptul\" /> There was much discussion about such self-determination by minorities<ref>Xenophon Contiades, [http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/AUD/s6.htm Sixth Scholarly Panel: Cultural Identity in the New Europe], 1st Global Conference on Federalism and the Union of European Democracies, March 2004. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105214649/http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/AUD/s6.htm |date=January 5, 2009 }}</ref> before the final document underwent the unsuccessful ratification process in 2005.\n\nAs a result of the successful [[2003 Liechtenstein constitutional referendum|constitutional referendum]] held in 2003, every municipality in the [[Liechtenstein|Principality of Liechtenstein]] has the right to secede from the Principality by a vote of a majority of the citizens residing in this municipality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fuerstenhaus.li/en/monarchy/the-reform-of-the-constitution-in-2003/|title=The Reform of the Constitution in 2003|website=fuerstenhaus.li|access-date=2017-01-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Drawing new borders ===\n\nIn determining international borders between sovereign states, self-determination has yielded to a number of other principles.<ref name=\"Anstis\">Sebastian Anstis, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09592296.2010.482477 The Normative Bases of the Global Territorial Order], [[Diplomacy & Statecraft]], Volume 21, no. 2 (June 2010), pp. 306 \u2013 323.</ref> Once groups exercise self-determination through secession, the issue of the proposed borders may prove more controversial than the fact of secession. The bloody Yugoslav wars in the 1990s were related mostly to border issues because the international community applied a version of [[uti possidetis juris]] in transforming the existing internal borders of the various Yugoslav republics into international borders, despite the conflicts of ethnic groups within those boundaries. In the 1990s indigenous populations of the northern two-thirds of Quebec province opposed being incorporated into a Quebec nation and stated a determination to resist it by force.<ref name=\"Pavkovic\" />\n\nThe border between [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Irish Free State]] was based on the borders of existing counties and did not include all of historic [[Ulster]].  A [[Irish Boundary Commission|Boundary Commission]] was established to consider re-drawing it. Its proposals, which amounted to a small net transfer to Northern Ireland, were leaked to the press and then not acted upon. In December 1925, the governments of the Irish Free State, Northern Ireland, and the United Kingdom agreed to accept the existing border.\n\n== Notable cases ==\n\n[[File:Graffiti on Belfast Walls3.jpg|thumb|A republican mural in [[Belfast]] showing support for [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]]]\n\nThere have been a number of notable cases of self-determination.

It successfully defended its independence in subsequent [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|war with Azerbaijan]], but remains largely unrecognized by UN states today. It is a member of the [[Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations]] along with three other [[Post-Soviet]] disputed republics.\n\n=== Australia ===\n{{Main|Self-determination of Australian Aborigines}}\n\nFrom 2003 onwards, self-determination has become the topic of some debate in Australia in relation to [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders]]. In the 1970s, the Indigenous community approached the Federal Government and requested the right to administer their own communities. This encompassed basic local government functions, ranging from land dealings and management of community centres to road maintenance and garbage collection, as well as setting education programmes and standards in their local schools.\n[[File:Les rebelles touaregs joignent leurs forces dans le nord du Mali (8248043080).jpg|thumb|Tuareg rebels in the short-lived [[proto-state]] of Azawad in 2012]]\n\n===Azawad===\n{{Main|Northern Mali conflict}}\n\nThe traditional homeland of the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] peoples was divided up by the modern borders of [[Mali]], [[Algeria]] and [[Niger]].

International Affairs, Vol 44 (1968), pp. 463\u2013481.\"Much is made in successive presentations of the Argentine case of the next episode in the history of the islands: the supposed fact that Great Britain 'brutally' and 'forcefully' expelled the Argentine garrison in 1833. The record is not nearly so dramatic. After the commander of the Lexington had declared, in December 1831, the Falklands 'free of all government', they remained without any visible authority. However, in September 1832, the Buenos Aires Government appointed, in place of Vernet, an interim commandant, Juan Mestivier. The British representative immediately lodged a protest, but Mes- tivier sailed on the Sarandi at the end of the year to take charge of a penal settlement at San Carlos, his Government's reserve on East Falkland. There was a mutiny, led by a sergeant of the garrison, and Mestivier was murdered. At this juncture, on January 11, 1833, H.M. sloop Clio arrived at Puerto de la Soledad when Pinedo, the commander of the Sarandi and 25 soldiers were attempting to re-establish order. The so-called 'brutal' eviction is laconically recorded in Captain Onslow's log: Tuesday 1 Jany. 1833. P.M. Mod. with rain 12.20 shortened sails and came to Port Louis (Soledad), Berkeley Sound ... found here a Buenos Ayrean flag flying on shore. 2.30 out boats. 3 furled sails. 5.30 Moored ship . . . Wednesday Jany. 2. Moored at Port Louis A.M. Mod. cloudy ... loosed sails and landed a party of marines and seamen and hoisted the Union Jack and hauled down the Buenos Ayrean flag and sent it on board the schooner to the Commandante. Sailmaker repairing the Main top Gallant sails.... In the interval between these two entries, Onslow had 'civilly' (his report) told Pinedo that he had come 'to exercise the right of sovereignty' on the islands and asked him to haul down his flag on shore. Pinedo protested, but said that if the Buenos Aires flag were allowed to fly until January 5, he would leave with his soldiers and anyone else who wished to go. When Onslow proved adamant, Pinedo agreed to embark his soldiers, but he left his flag flying on shore. This was why Onslow sent it to him by one of the Clio's officers. Pinedo sailed on January 4 and was later punished by the Buenos Aires Government for failing to offer any resistance\"</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Laurio Hedelvio Dest\u00e9fani|title=The Malvinas, the South Georgias, and the South Sandwich Islands, the conflict with Britain|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sGAJSfxqd7oC|year=1982|publisher=Edipress|isbn=978-950-01-6904-2|page=91|quote=Before Pinedo sailed from the Malvinas he appointed Political and Military Commander of the Islands, a Frenchman name Juan Simon who had been Vernet's trusted foreman in charge of his gauchos}}</ref> and there was no attempt to settle the islands until 1841.<ref name=\"Harper1998\">{{cite book|author=Marjory Harper|title=Emigration from Scotland Between the Wars: Opportunity Or Exile?|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L4x2UdzPB4cC&pg=PA91|year=1998|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4927-9|page=91}}</ref>\n\n=== Gibraltar ===\n{{Main|Disputed status of Gibraltar}}\n\n[[File:Gibraltar National Day 027 (9719742224) (2).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Gibraltar National Day, September 2013]]\n\nThe right to self-determination is referred to in the pre-amble of Chapter 1 of the [[Gibraltar Constitution Order 2006|Gibraltar constitution]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/constitution/Gibraltar_Constitution_Order_2006.pdf |title=The Gibraltar Constitution Order 2006 |publisher=Gibraltarlaws.gov.gi |date=2006-12-14 |accessdate=2013-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115055815/http://www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/constitution/Gibraltar_Constitution_Order_2006.pdf |archive-date=2012-11-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and, since the United Kingdom also gave assurances that the right to self-determination of Gibraltarians would be respected in any transfer of sovereignty over the territory, is a factor in the dispute with Spain over the territory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.uoregon.edu/org/oril/docs/9-1/Leathley.pdf |title=Gibraltar's Quest for Self-Determination: A Critique of Gibraltar's New Constitution |publisher=OREGON REVIEW OF INT\u2019L LAW [Vol. 9, 2007] |year=2007 |accessdate=2013-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117100124/http://law.uoregon.edu/org/oril//docs/9-1/Leathley.pdf |archive-date=2013-01-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The impact of the right to self-determination of Gibraltarians was seen in the [[2002 Gibraltar sovereignty referendum]], where Gibraltarian voters overwhelmingly rejected a plan to share sovereignty over Gibraltar between the UK and Spain.

This sparked several nation's protest along with Great Britain's declaration on 14 December that the decision is invalid. \nDecades later {{When|date=August 2019}}, a nationalist independence movement, dubbed as the Hong Kong independence&nbsp;movement emerged in the now Communist Chinese controlled territory. It advocates the autonomous region to become a fully independent sovereign state.\n\nThe city is considered a [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative region]]&nbsp;(SAR) which, according to the PRC, enjoys a high degree of autonomy under the People's Republic of China (PRC), guaranteed under Article 2 of&nbsp;[[Hong Kong Basic Law]]<sup>[[Hong Kong independence#cite note-1|[1]]]</sup>&nbsp;(which is ratified under the&nbsp;[[Sino-British Joint Declaration]]), since the&nbsp;[[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong]]&nbsp;from the United Kingdom to the PRC in 1997. Since the handover, many Hongkongers are increasingly concerned about Beijing's growing encroachment on the territory's freedoms and the failure of the Hong Kong government to deliver 'true' democracy.<sup>[[Hong Kong independence#cite note-rally-2|[2]]]</sup>\n[[File:Hong Kong Flag 6048.JPG|thumb|upright=1.05|Pro-independence [[Flag of Hong Kong|Hong Kong flag]] put up before a football match between the [[Hong Kong national football team|Hong Kong Football Team]] and the [[China national football team]].]]\nThe&nbsp;[[2014\u201315 Hong Kong electoral reform]]&nbsp;package deeply divided the city, as it allowed Hongkongers to have universal suffrage, but Beijing would have authority to screen the candidates to restrict the electoral method for the&nbsp;[[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]]&nbsp;(CE), the highest-ranking official of the territory.

Maharaja Hari Singh, the ruler of Kashmir at the time of accession, signed the Instrument of Accession Act on October 26, 1947 as his territory was being attacked by Pakistani tribesmen. The passing of this Act allowed Jammu and Kashmir to accede to India on legal terms. When this Act was taken to Lord Mountbatten, the last viceroy of British India, he agreed to it and stated that a referendum needed to be held by the citizens in India, Pakistan, and Kashmir so that they could vote as to where Kashmir should accede to. This referendum that Mountbatten called for never took place and framed one of the legal disputes for Kashmir. In 1948 the United Nations intervened and ordered a plebiscite to be taken in order to hear the voices of the Kashmiris if they would like to accede to Pakistan or India. This plebiscite left out the right for Kashmiris to have the right of self-determination and become an autonomous state. To this date the Kashmiris have been faced with numerous human rights violations committed by both India and Pakistan and have yet to gain complete autonomy which they have been seeking through self-determination.{{POV check inline|This whole paragraph is the only edit by a new user on a contentious topic, so I suspect NPOV issues.|date=September 2018}} {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable sources needed for the entire paragraph.|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe insurgency in Kashmir against Indian rule has existed in various forms. A widespread armed insurgency started in Kashmir against India rule in 1989 after allegations of rigging by the Indian government in the 1987 Jammu and Kashmir state election. This led to some parties in the state assembly forming militant wings, which acted as a catalyst for the emergence of armed insurgency in the region. The conflict over Kashmir has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.\n[[File:Indian soldiers, Kashmir (8138898130).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Indian soldiers on the streets of Kashmir during the [[Kashmir conflict|2016 unrests]].]]\nThe Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan has been accused by India of supporting and training both pro-Pakistan and pro-independence militants to fight Indian security forces in Jammu and Kashmir, a charge that Pakistan denies. According to official figures released in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly, there were 3,400 disappearance cases and the conflict has left more than 47,000 to 100,000 people dead as of July 2009. However, violence in the state had fallen sharply after the start of a slow-moving peace process between India and Pakistan. After the peace process failed in 2008, mass demonstrations against Indian rule, and also low-scale militancy have emerged again.\n\nHowever, despite boycott calls by separatist leaders in 2014, the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections saw highest voters turnout in last 25 years since insurgency erupted. As per the Indian government, it recorded more than 65% of voters turnout which was more than usual voters turnout in other state assembly elections of India. It considered as increase in faith of Kashmiri people in democratic process of India. However, activists say that the voter turnout is highly exaggerated and that elections are held under duress. Votes are cast because the people want stable governance of the state and this cannot be mistaken as an endorsement of Indian rule.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.solidarity-us.org/node/707|title=A Way Out for Kashmir? - Solidarity|publisher=}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kashmiri.com/newsletters/archive/view/listid-1-mailinglist/mailid-67-joomlacontent44typetitlelink/tmpl-component|title=January 5th \u2013 Remembrance of Self-determination in Kashmir|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Kurdistan ===\n[[File:YPJ fighters Raqqa (February 2017).jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|Kurdish [[People's Protection Units|YPG]]'s female fighters during the [[Syrian Civil War|Syrian War]]]]\n{{Main|Kurdish\u2013Turkish conflict (1978\u2013present)|Iraqi\u2013Kurdish conflict|Kurdish separatism in Iran|2012 Syrian Kurdistan rebellion}}\n[[File:Pre-referendum, pro-Kurdistan, pro-independence rally in Erbil, Kurdistan Region of Iraq 25.jpg|thumb|Pro-independence rally in [[Erbil]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] in September 2017]]\n\n[[Kurdistan]] is a historical region primarily inhabited by the [[Kurdish people]] of the Middle East. The territory is currently part of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran. There are Kurdish self-determination movements in each of the 4 states. Iraqi Kurdistan has to date achieved the largest degree of self-determination through the formation of the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]], an entity recognised by the Iraqi Federal Constitution.\n\nAlthough the right of the creation of a Kurdish state was recognized following World War I in the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], the treaty was then annulled by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]]. To date two separate Kurdish republics and one Kurdish Kingdom have declared sovereignty. The [[Republic of Ararat]] ([[A\u011fr\u0131 Province]], Turkey), the [[Republic of Mehabad]] ([[West Azerbaijan Province]], Iran) and the [[Kingdom of Kurdistan]] ([[Sulaymaniyah Governorate]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], Iraq), each of these fledgling states was crushed by military intervention. The [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] which currently holds the [[President of Iraq|Iraqi presidency]] and the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party]] which governs the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] both explicitly commit themselves to the development of Kurdish self-determination, but opinions vary as to the question of self-determination sought within the current borders and countries.\n\nEfforts towards Kurdish self-determination are considered illegal separatism by the governments of Turkey and Iran, and the movement is politically repressed in both states. This is intertwined with Kurdish nationalist insurgencies [[Kurdish separatism in Iran|in Iran]] and [[Kurdish\u2013Turkish conflict (1978\u2013present)|in Turkey]], which in turn justify and are justified by the repression of peaceful advocacy.

As a strategic location in the Middle East, it was subsequently occupied by several major powers, including the empires of the Assyrians, Egyptians and Persians, from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great. Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt, the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire, Arab caliphates for a short period and the French Lusignan dynasty. Following the death in 1473 of James II, the last Lusignan king, the Republic of Venice assumed control of the island, while the late king's Venetian widow, Queen Catherine Cornaro, reigned as figurehead. Venice formally annexed the Kingdom of Cyprus in 1489, following the abdication of Catherine. The Venetians fortified Nicosia by building the Walls of Nicosia, and used it as an important commercial hub.\n\nAlthough the Lusignan French aristocracy remained the dominant social class in Cyprus throughout the medieval period, the former assumption that Greeks were treated only as serfs on the island is no longer considered by academics to be accurate. It is now accepted that the medieval period saw increasing numbers of Greek Cypriots elevated to the upper classes, a growing Greek middle ranks, and the Lusignan royal household even marrying Greeks. This included King John II of Cyprus who married Helena Palaiologina.\n\nThroughout Venetian rule, the Ottoman Empire frequently raided Cyprus. In 1539 the Ottomans destroyed Limassol and so fearing the worst, the Venetians also fortified Famagusta and Kyrenia.\n\nInvaded in 1570, Turks controlled and solely governed all of the Cyprus island from 1571 till its leasing to the United Kingdom in 1878. Cyprus was placed under British administration based on Cyprus Convention in 1878 and formally annexed by Britain in 1914. While Turkish Cypriots made up 18% of the population, the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s.

[[Nationalism]] emerged as a uniting ideology not only between competing powers, but also for groups that felt subordinated or disenfranchised inside larger states; in this situation, self-determination can be seen as a reaction to imperialism.  Such groups often pursued independence and sovereignty over territory, but sometimes a different sense of autonomy has been pursued or achieved.\n\n==== Empires ====\n\nThe world possessed several traditional, continental empires such as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]], [[Austrian Empire|Austrian/Habsburg]], and the [[Qing Empire]].  Political scientists often define competition in Europe during the [[Modern Era]] as a [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] struggle, which also induced various European states to pursue colonial empires, beginning with the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], and later including the [[British Empire|British]], [[French colonial empire|French]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], and [[German colonial empire|German]].\nDuring the early 19th century, competition in Europe produced multiple wars, most notably the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  After this conflict, the British Empire became dominant and entered its [[Britain's Imperial Century|\"imperial century\"]], while nationalism became a powerful political ideology in Europe.\n\nLater, after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870, \"[[New Imperialism]]\" was unleashed with [[Second French colonial empire|France]] and later [[German colonial empire|Germany]] establishing colonies in Asia, the Pacific, and Africa.  Japan also emerged as a new power.  Multiple theaters of competition developed across the world:\n\n* Africa: multiple European states competed for colonies in the \"[[Scramble for Africa]]\";\n* Central Asia: [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[British Empire|Britain]] competed for domination in the \"[[Great Game]]\"\n* Eastern Asia: colonies and various [[spheres of influence]] were established, largely to the detriment of the [[Qing Empire]].\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, Austrian Empire, Russian Empire, Qing Empire and the new [[Empire of Japan]] maintained themselves, often expanding or contracting at the expense of another empire.  All ignored notions of self-determination for those governed.<ref>Jackson J.

[[Thomas Jefferson]] further promoted the notion that the will of the people was supreme, especially through authorship of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] which inspired Europeans throughout the 19th century.<ref name=\"Unterberger\" /> The French Revolution was motivated similarly and legitimatized the ideas of self-determination on that [[Old World]] continent.<ref>Chim\u00e8ne Keitner, [[Oxford University]], [http://www.ciaonet.org/isa/woc01/National Self-Determination: The Legacy of the French Revolution], paper presented at International Studies Association Annual Meeting, March 2000.</ref><ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B16FD3D5C147A93C2AB178CD85F4D8185F9 \"Self-Determination Not a New Expedient; First Plebiscite Was Held in Avignon During the French Revolution\u2014Forthcoming Book Traces History and Growth of the Movement\"], ''[[New York Times]]'', July 20, 1919, 69.</ref>\n\nWithin the New World during the early 19th century, most of the nations of [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] achieved [[Spanish American wars of independence|independence from Spain]]. The United States supported that status, as policy in the hemisphere relative to European colonialism, with the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. The American public, organized associated groups, and Congressional resolutions, often supported such movements, particularly the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821\u201329) and the [[12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848|demands of Hungarian revolutionaries in 1848]]. Such support, however, never became official government policy, due to balancing of other [[national interests]]. After the [[American Civil War]] and with increasing capability, the United States government did not accept self-determination as a basis during its [[Purchase of Alaska]] and attempted purchase of the West Indian islands of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]] and [[St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint John]] in the 1860s, or its growing influence in the [[Hawaii]]an Islands, that led to annexation in 1898. With its victory in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1899 and its growing stature in the world, the United States supported annexation of the former Spanish colonies of [[Guam]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the Philippines, without the consent of their peoples, and it retained \"quasi-[[suzerainty]]\" over Cuba, as well.<ref name=\"Unterberger\" />\n\nNationalist sentiments emerged inside the traditional empires including: [[Pan-Slavism]] in Russia; [[Ottomanism]], [[Kemalist ideology]] and [[Arab nationalism]] in the Ottoman Empire; [[State Shintoism]] and [[Japanese nationalism|Japanese identity]] in Japan; and [[Chinese nationalism|Han identity]] in juxtaposition to the [[Manchu people|Manchurian ruling class]] in China. Meanwhile, in Europe itself there was a [[Rise of nationalism in Europe|rise of nationalism]], with nations such as [[Greek War of Independence|Greece]], [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungary]], [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|Poland]] and [[Bulgarian unification|Bulgaria]] seeking or winning their independence.\n\n[[Karl Marx]] supported such nationalism, believing it might be a \"prior condition\" to social reform and international alliances.<ref>Erica Benner, \u2018\u2019Really existing nationalisms: a post-communist view from Marx and Engels\u2019\u2018, [https://books.google.com/books?id=N-7Xc8WtCLgC&pg=PA188&dq=%22self-determination%22+of+colonies+marx&ei=HLAGS6bRHafgyASj-_2_Dw#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 188], Oxford University Press, 1995 {{ISBN|0-19-827959-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-827959-4}}</ref> In 1914 [[Vladimir Lenin]] wrote: \"[It] would be wrong to interpret the right to self-determination as meaning anything but the right to existence as a separate state.\"<ref name=\"Lenin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/self-det/ch01.htm#v20pp72-395 |title=What Is Meant By The Self-Determination of Nations? |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref>\n\n=== World Wars I and II ===\n\n==== Europe, Asia and Africa ====\n\n[[File:Map Europe 1923-en.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Map of [[Aftermath of World War I|territorial changes]] in Europe after World War I (as of 1923)]]\n\n[[File:Decolonization - World In 1945 en.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|Map of the world in 1945, showing [[United Nations Trusteeship Council]] territories in green<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/world45.pdf |title=The World in 1945 |date=May 2010 |work=United nations |accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref>]]\n\n[[Woodrow Wilson]] revived America's commitment to self-determination, at least for European states, during World War I. When the [[Bolsheviks]] came to power in Russia in November 1917, they called for Russia's immediate withdrawal as a member of the [[Allies of World War I]]. They also supported the right of all nations, including colonies, to self-determination.\"<ref name=\"Lenin\" /> The 1918 [[1918 Soviet Constitution|Constitution of the Soviet Union]] acknowledged the right of [[secession]] for its constituent republics.<ref name=\"Unterberger\" />\n\nThis presented a challenge to Wilson's more limited demands. In January 1918 Wilson issued his [[Fourteen Points]] of January 1918 which, among other things, called for adjustment of colonial claims, insofar as the interests of colonial powers had equal weight with the claims of subject peoples.<ref name=\"Unterberger\" /> The [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] in March 1918 led to Soviet Russia's exit from the war and the nominal independence of Armenia, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Georgia and Poland, though in fact those territories were under German control. The end of the war led to the dissolution of the defeated [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and [[Czechoslovakia]] and the union of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] as new states out of the wreckage of the Habsburg empire. However, this imposition of states where some nationalities (especially Poles, Czechs, and Serbs and [[Romanians]]) were given power over nationalities who disliked and distrusted them eventually used as a pretext for German aggression in World War II.\n\nWilson publicly argued that the agreements made in the aftermath of the war would be a \"readjustment of those great injustices which underlie the whole structure of European and Asiatic society\", which he attributed to the absence of democratic rule. The new order emerging in the postwar period would, according to Wilson, place governments \"in the hands of the people and taken out of the hands of coteries and of sovereigns, who had to right to rule over the people.\" The [[League of Nations]] was established as the symbol of the emerging postwar order; one of its earliest tasks was to legitimize the territorial boundaries of the new nations-states created in the territories of the former [[Ottoman Empire]], Asia, and Africa. The principle of self-determination did not extend so far as to end colonialism; under the reasoning that the local populations were not civilized enough the League of Nations was to assign each of the post-Ottoman, Asian and African states and colonies to a European power by the grant of a [[League of Nations mandate]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Fezzes in the River |author=Sarah D. Shields |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\nOne of the German objections to the Treaty of Versailles was a somewhat selective application of the principle of self-determination as the majority of the people in Austria and in the [[Sudetenland]] region of Czechoslovakia wanted to join Germany while the majority of people in Danzig wanted to remain within the ''Reich'', but the Allies ignored the German objections. Wilson's 14 Points had called for Polish independence to be restored and Poland to have \"secure access to the sea\", which would imply that the German city of Danzig (modern Gda\u0144sk, Poland), which occupied a strategic location where the Vistula river flowed into the Baltic sea, be ceded to Poland.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 211\">Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 211.</ref>  At the Paris peace conference in 1919, the Polish delegation led by [[Roman Dmowski]] asked for Wilson to honor point 14 of the 14 points by transferring Danzig to Poland. arguing that Poland would not be economically viable without Danzig.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 211\"/> However, as the 90% of the people in Danzig in this period were German, the Allied leaders at the Paris peace conference compromised by creating the [[Free City of Danzig]], a city-state in which Poland had certain special rights.<ref>Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 218.</ref> Through the city of Danzig was 90% German and 10% Polish, the surrounding countryside around Danzig was overwhelmingly Polish, and the ethnically Polish rural areas included in the Free City of Danzig objected, arguing that they wanted to be part of Poland.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 211\"/> Neither the Poles nor the Germans were happy with this compromise and the Danzig issue became a flash-point of German-Polish tension throughout the interwar period.<ref>Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 219.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s there were some successful movements for self-determination in the beginnings of the process of [[decolonization]]. In the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] the United Kingdom granted independence to Canada, New Zealand, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], the [[Irish Free State]], the Commonwealth of Australia, and the [[Union of South Africa]] after the [[British parliament]] declared itself as incapable of passing laws over them without their consent. Egypt, Afghanistan and Iraq also achieved independence from Britain and Lebanon from France. Other efforts were unsuccessful, like the [[Indian independence movement]]. And Italy, Japan and Germany all initiated new efforts to bring certain territories under their control, leading to World War II. In particular, the [[National Socialist Program]] invoked this right of nations in its first point (out of 25), as it was publicly proclaimed on 24 February 1920 by [[Adolf Hitler]].\n\nIn Asia, Japan became a rising power and gained more respect from Western powers after its victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]].  Japan joined the Allied Powers in World War I and [[Japan during World War I|attacked German colonial possessions]] in the Far East, adding former German possessions to its own empire.  In the 1930s, Japan gained significant influence in [[Inner Mongolia]] and [[Manchuria]] after it [[Mukden Incident|invaded Manchuria]].  It established [[Manchukuo]], a [[puppet state]] in Manchuria and eastern Inner Mongolia. This was essentially the model Japan followed as it invaded other areas in Asia and established the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. Japan went to considerable trouble to argue that Manchukuo was justified by the principle of self-determination, claiming that people of Manchuria wanted to break away from China and asked the [[Kwantung Army]] to intervene on their behalf. However, the Lytton commission which had been appointed by the League of Nations to decide if Japan had committed aggression or not, stated the majority of people in Manchuria who were Han Chinese who did not wish to leave China.\n\nIn 1912, the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] officially [[successor state|succeeded]] the Qing Dynasty, while [[Outer Mongolia]], [[Tibet (1912\u20131951)|Tibet]] and [[Tannu Uriankhai|Tuva]] proclaimed their independence. Independence was not accepted by the [[Beiyang government|government of China]]. By the [[Treaty of Kyakhta (1915)]] [[Outer Mongolia, 1911-1919|Outer Mongolia]] recognized China's sovereignty. However, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat of seizing parts of Inner Mongolia induced China to recognize [[Mongolian People's Republic|Outer Mongolia's independence]], provided that a referendum was held. The referendum took place on October 20, 1945, with (according to official numbers) 100% of the electorate voting for independence.\n\nMany of Eastern Asia's current disputes to sovereignty and self-determination stem from unresolved disputes from World War II.  After its fall, the [[Empire of Japan]] renounced control over many of its former possessions including Korea, [[Sakhalin Island]], and [[Taiwan]].  In none of these areas were the opinions of affected people consulted, or given significant priority. Korea was specifically granted independence but the receiver of various other areas was not stated in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]], giving Taiwan ''de facto'' independence although its political status continues to be ambiguous.\n\n=== The Cold War world ===\n\n==== The UN Charter and resolutions====\n\nIn 1941 [[Allies of World War II]] declared the [[Atlantic Charter]] and accepted the principle of self-determination. In January 1942 twenty-six states signed the [[Declaration by United Nations]], which accepted those principles. The ratification of the United Nations Charter in 1945 at the end of World War II placed the right of self-determination into the framework of international law and diplomacy.\n\n* Chapter 1, Article 1, part 2 states that purpose of the UN Charter is: \"To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/ |title=United Nations Charter |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-08}}</ref>\n* Article 1 in both the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |title=Text of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |publisher=.ohchr.org |accessdate=2012-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303001412/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |archivedate=March 3, 2012 }}</ref> and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm |title=Text of International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights |publisher=.ohchr.org |accessdate=2012-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303114220/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm |archivedate=March 3, 2012 }}</ref> reads: \"All peoples have the right of self-determination.

[[People's Republic of Tuva|Tuva]] and several regional states in [[Eastern Europe]], the Baltic, and Central Asia had been fully annexed by the Soviet Union during World War II. Now, it extended its influence by establishing the [[satellite states]] of Eastern Germany and the countries of Eastern Europe, along with support for revolutionary movements in China and North Korea. Although satellite states were independent and possessed sovereignty, the Soviet Union violated principles of self-determination by suppressing the [[Hungarian revolution of 1956]] and the [[Prague Spring]] Czechoslovak reforms of 1968. It [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|invaded Afghanistan]] to support a communist government assailed by local tribal groups.<ref name=\"Unterberger\" /> However, [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] and its theory of imperialism were also strong influences in the national emancipation movements of [[Third World]] nations rebelling against colonial or puppet regimes. In many [[Third World]] countries, communism became an ideology that united groups to oppose imperialism or colonization.\n\nSoviet actions were [[Containment|contained]] by the United States which saw communism as a menace to its interests. Throughout the cold war, the United States created, supported, and sponsored regimes with various success that served their economic and political interests, among them [[anti-communist]] regimes such as that of [[Augusto Pinochet]] in [[Chile]] and [[Suharto]] in [[Indonesia]]. To achieve this, a variety of means was implemented, including the orchestration of coups, sponsoring of anti-communist countries and military interventions. Consequently, many self-determination movements, which spurned some type of anti-communist government, were accused of being Soviet-inspired or controlled.<ref name=\"Unterberger\" />\n\n==== Asia ====\nIn Asia, the Soviet Union had already converted Mongolia into a satellite state but abandoned propping up the [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] and gave up its [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|Manchurian claims]] to China. The new [[People's Republic of China]] had gained control of mainland China in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. The [[Korean War]] shifted the focus of the Cold War from Europe to Asia, where competing superpowers took advantage of [[decolonization]] to spread their influence.\n\nIn 1947, India gained independence from the [[British Empire]]. The empire was in decline but adapted to these circumstances by creating the British Commonwealth\u2014since 1949 the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]\u2014which is a free association of equal states.  As India obtained its independence, multiple ethnic conflicts emerged in relation to the formation of a statehood during the [[Partition of India]] which resulted in Islamic Pakistan and Secular India. Before the [[British Raj|advent of the British]], no empire based in mainland India had controlled any part of what now makes up the country's Northeast, part of the reason for the ongoing [[insurgency in Northeast India]].<ref>http://www.apcss.org/Publications/Edited%20Volumes/ReligiousRadicalism/PagesfromReligiousRadicalismandSecurityinSouthAsiach10.pdf p. 220</ref> In 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladesh obtained independence]] from Pakistan.\n\nBurma also gained independence from the British Empire, but declined membership in the Commonwealth.\n\nIndonesia gained independence from the Netherlands in 1949 after the latter failed to restore colonial control.  As mentioned above, Indonesia also wanted a powerful position in the region that could be lessened by the creation of united [[Malaysia]]. The Netherlands retained [[Dutch New Guinea]], but Indonesia threatened to invade and annex it. A vote was supposedly taken under the UN sponsored [[Act of Free Choice]] to allow West New Guineans to decide their fate, although many dispute its veracity.  Later, Portugal relinquished control over [[East Timor]] in 1975, at which time Indonesia promptly invaded and annexed it.\n\n=== After the Cold War ===\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|upright=1.5|[[List of national border changes since World War I|Changes in national boundaries]] after the end of the Cold War]]\nThe Cold War began to wind down after [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] assumed power in March 1985. With the cooperation of the American president [[Ronald Reagan]], Gorbachev wound down the size of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] and reduced nuclear arms in Europe, while liberalizing the [[economy of the Soviet Union|economy]].\n\nIn 1989 \u2013 90, the communist regimes of Soviet satellite states collapsed in rapid succession in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, and Mongolia.  East and West Germany united, Czechoslovakia peacefully split into [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], while in 1990 Yugoslavia began a [[Yugoslavia#Breakup|violent break up]] into 6 states. [[Kosovo]], which was previously an autonomous unit of Serbia declared independence in 2008, but has received less international recognition.<ref name=\"Unterberger\" />\n\nIn December 1991, Gorbachev resigned as president and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] relatively peacefully into fifteen sovereign republics, all of which rejected communism and most of which adopted democratic reforms and free-market economies.  Inside those new republics, [[Commonwealth of Unrecognized States|four major areas]] have claimed their own independence, but not received widespread international recognition.\n\nAfter decades of civil war, Indonesia finally recognized the independence of [[East Timor]] in 2002.\n\nIn 1949, the [[Communists]] won the civil war and established the [[People's Republic of China]] in Mainland China. The [[Kuomintang]]-led [[Republic of China]] government retreated to [[Taipei]], its jurisdiction now limited to [[Taiwan]] and several outlying islands. Since then, the People's Republic of China has been involved in disputes with the ROC over issues of sovereignty and the political status of Taiwan.\n\nAs noted, self-determination movements remain [[List of active autonomist and secessionist movements|strong in some areas of the world]].  Some areas possess ''de facto'' independence, such as Taiwan, [[North Cyprus]], [[Kosovo]], and [[South Ossetia]], but their independence is disputed by one or more major states. Significant movements for self-determination also persist for locations that lack ''de facto'' independence, such as [[Kurdistan]], [[Balochistan]], [[Chechnya]], and the [[State of Palestine]]\n\n== Current issues ==\n\n[[File:South Sudan Independence Celebration (5963420792).jpg|thumb|[[Southern Sudan]]ese expressed joy and jubilation on their day of independence, July 9, 2011, from Sudan.]]\n\nSince the early 1990s, the legitimatization of the principle of national self-determination has led to an increase in the number of conflicts within states, as sub-groups seek greater self-determination and full secession, and as their conflicts for leadership within groups and with other groups and with the dominant state become violent.<ref>Martin Griffiths, [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MqLJ/2003/3.html Self-determination, International Society And World Order], [[Macquarie University]] Law Journal, 1, 2003.</ref> The international reaction to these new movements has been uneven and often dictated more by politics than principle.

This policy was pursued by the major powers during the Cold War.\n* Liberal internationalism has become an alternative since that time. It promotes the abolition of war among states as well as increased individual liberty within states, and holds the expansion of global markets and cross-border cooperation diminishes the significance of territorial integrity, allowing for somewhat greater recognition of greater self-determination of peoples.\n* Cosmopolitan liberalism calls for political power to shift to a world government which would make secession and change of boundaries a relatively easy administrative matter. However, it also would mean the de facto end of self-determination of national groups.<ref name=\"Pavkovic\" />\n\n[[File:2014-05-11. \u0420\u0435\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u043c \u0432 \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0435 011.jpg|thumb|[[2014 Donetsk and Luhansk status referendums|Donetsk status referendum]] organized by separatists in [[Ukraine]]. A line to enter a polling place, 11 May 2014]]\n\n[[Allen Buchanan]], author of seven books on self-determination and secession, supports territorial integrity as a moral and legal aspect of constitutional democracy. However, he also advances a \"Remedial Rights Only Theory\" where a group has \"a general right to secede if and only if it has suffered certain injustices, for which secession is the appropriate remedy of last resort. \" He also would recognize secession if the state grants, or the constitution includes, a right to secede.<ref name=\"Gudeleviciute\" />\n\nVita Gudeleviciute holds that in cases of non-self-governing peoples and foreign military occupation the principle of self-determination trumps that of territorial integrity. In cases where people lack representation by a state's government, they also may be considered a separate people, but under current law cannot claim the right to self-determination. On the other hand, she finds that secession within a single state is a domestic matter not covered by international law. Thus there are no on what groups may constitute a seceding people.<ref name=\"Gudeleviciute\" />\n\nA number of states have laid claim to territories, which they allege were removed from them as a result of colonialism.  This is justified by reference to Paragraph 6 of UN Resolution 1514(XV), which states that any attempt \"aimed at partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter\".  This, it is claimed, applies to situations where the territorial integrity of a state had been disrupted by colonisation, so that the people of a territory subject to a historic territorial claim are prevented from exercising a right to self-determination.  This interpretation is rejected by many states, who argue that Paragraph 2 of UN Resolution 1514(XV) states that \"all peoples have the right to self-determination\" and Paragraph 6 cannot be used to justify territorial claims.  The original purpose of Paragraph 6 was \"to ensure that acts of self-determination occur within the established boundaries of colonies, rather than within sub-regions\".  Further, the use of the word ''attempt'' in Paragraph 6 denotes future action and cannot be construed to justify territorial redress for past action.<ref name=\"Musgrave2000\">{{cite book|author=Thomas D.

More limited measures might include restricting demands to the maintenance of national cultures or granting non-territorial autonomy in the form of national associations which would assume control over cultural matters. This would be available only to groups that abandoned secessionist demands and the territorial state would retain political and judicial control, but only if would remain with the territorially organized state.<ref name=\"Pavkovic\" />\n\n=== Self-determination versus majority rule/equal rights ===\n\nPavkovi\u0107 explores how national self-determination, in the form of creation of a new state through secession, could override the principles of [[majority rule]] and of [[Civil rights|equal rights]], which are primary liberal principles. This includes the question of how an unwanted state can be imposed upon a minority. He explores five contemporary theories of secession. In \"anarcho-capitalist\" theory only landowners have the right to secede. In communitarian theory, only those groups that desire direct or greater political participation have the right, including groups deprived of rights, per Allen Buchanan. In two nationalist theories, only national cultural groups have a right to secede. Australian professor Harry Beran's democratic theory endorses the equality of the right of secession to all types of groups. Unilateral secession against majority rule is justified if the group allows secession of any other group within its territory.<ref>Aleksandar Pavkovi\u0107, [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MqLJ/2003/5.html Majority Rule and Equal Rights: a Few Questions], [[Macquarie University]] Law Journal, 1, 2003.</ref><ref>Harry Beran, \"A Democratic Theory of Political Self-Determination for a New World Order\" in Percy Lehning (ed), Theories of Secession (1998) 36, 39, 42 \u2013 43.</ref>\n\n=== Constitutional law ===\n\nMost [[sovereign state]]s do not recognize the right to self-determination through secession in their constitutions.

However, the Party eliminated the right to secession in later years, and had anti-secession clause written into the Constitution before and after the founding the People's Republic of China. The 1947 Constitution of the [[Burma|Union of Burma]] contained an express state right to secede from the union under a number of procedural conditions. It was eliminated in the 1974 constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma (officially the \"Union of Myanmar\"). Burma still allows \"local autonomy under central leadership\".<ref name=\"Kreptul\" />\n\nAs of 1996 the constitutions of Austria, Ethiopia, France, and [[Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Saint Kitts and Nevis]] have express or implied rights to secession. Switzerland allows for the secession from current and the creation of new [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]].

The bloody Yugoslav wars in the 1990s were related mostly to border issues because the international community applied a version of [[uti possidetis juris]] in transforming the existing internal borders of the various Yugoslav republics into international borders, despite the conflicts of ethnic groups within those boundaries. In the 1990s indigenous populations of the northern two-thirds of Quebec province opposed being incorporated into a Quebec nation and stated a determination to resist it by force.<ref name=\"Pavkovic\" />\n\nThe border between [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Irish Free State]] was based on the borders of existing counties and did not include all of historic [[Ulster]].  A [[Irish Boundary Commission|Boundary Commission]] was established to consider re-drawing it. Its proposals, which amounted to a small net transfer to Northern Ireland, were leaked to the press and then not acted upon. In December 1925, the governments of the Irish Free State, Northern Ireland, and the United Kingdom agreed to accept the existing border.\n\n== Notable cases ==\n\n[[File:Graffiti on Belfast Walls3.jpg|thumb|A republican mural in [[Belfast]] showing support for [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]]]\n\nThere have been a number of notable cases of self-determination.

In the 1970s, the Indigenous community approached the Federal Government and requested the right to administer their own communities. This encompassed basic local government functions, ranging from land dealings and management of community centres to road maintenance and garbage collection, as well as setting education programmes and standards in their local schools.\n[[File:Les rebelles touaregs joignent leurs forces dans le nord du Mali (8248043080).jpg|thumb|Tuareg rebels in the short-lived [[proto-state]] of Azawad in 2012]]\n\n===Azawad===\n{{Main|Northern Mali conflict}}\n\nThe traditional homeland of the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] peoples was divided up by the modern borders of [[Mali]], [[Algeria]] and [[Niger]].

International Affairs, Vol 44 (1968), pp. 463\u2013481.\"Much is made in successive presentations of the Argentine case of the next episode in the history of the islands: the supposed fact that Great Britain 'brutally' and 'forcefully' expelled the Argentine garrison in 1833. The record is not nearly so dramatic. After the commander of the Lexington had declared, in December 1831, the Falklands 'free of all government', they remained without any visible authority. However, in September 1832, the Buenos Aires Government appointed, in place of Vernet, an interim commandant, Juan Mestivier. The British representative immediately lodged a protest, but Mes- tivier sailed on the Sarandi at the end of the year to take charge of a penal settlement at San Carlos, his Government's reserve on East Falkland. There was a mutiny, led by a sergeant of the garrison, and Mestivier was murdered. At this juncture, on January 11, 1833, H.M. sloop Clio arrived at Puerto de la Soledad when Pinedo, the commander of the Sarandi and 25 soldiers were attempting to re-establish order. The so-called 'brutal' eviction is laconically recorded in Captain Onslow's log: Tuesday 1 Jany. 1833. P.M. Mod. with rain 12.20 shortened sails and came to Port Louis (Soledad), Berkeley Sound ... found here a Buenos Ayrean flag flying on shore. 2.30 out boats. 3 furled sails. 5.30 Moored ship . . . Wednesday Jany. 2. Moored at Port Louis A.M. Mod. cloudy ... loosed sails and landed a party of marines and seamen and hoisted the Union Jack and hauled down the Buenos Ayrean flag and sent it on board the schooner to the Commandante. Sailmaker repairing the Main top Gallant sails.... In the interval between these two entries, Onslow had 'civilly' (his report) told Pinedo that he had come 'to exercise the right of sovereignty' on the islands and asked him to haul down his flag on shore. Pinedo protested, but said that if the Buenos Aires flag were allowed to fly until January 5, he would leave with his soldiers and anyone else who wished to go. When Onslow proved adamant, Pinedo agreed to embark his soldiers, but he left his flag flying on shore. This was why Onslow sent it to him by one of the Clio's officers. Pinedo sailed on January 4 and was later punished by the Buenos Aires Government for failing to offer any resistance\"</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Laurio Hedelvio Dest\u00e9fani|title=The Malvinas, the South Georgias, and the South Sandwich Islands, the conflict with Britain|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sGAJSfxqd7oC|year=1982|publisher=Edipress|isbn=978-950-01-6904-2|page=91|quote=Before Pinedo sailed from the Malvinas he appointed Political and Military Commander of the Islands, a Frenchman name Juan Simon who had been Vernet's trusted foreman in charge of his gauchos}}</ref> and there was no attempt to settle the islands until 1841.<ref name=\"Harper1998\">{{cite book|author=Marjory Harper|title=Emigration from Scotland Between the Wars: Opportunity Or Exile?|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L4x2UdzPB4cC&pg=PA91|year=1998|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4927-9|page=91}}</ref>\n\n=== Gibraltar ===\n{{Main|Disputed status of Gibraltar}}\n\n[[File:Gibraltar National Day 027 (9719742224) (2).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Gibraltar National Day, September 2013]]\n\nThe right to self-determination is referred to in the pre-amble of Chapter 1 of the [[Gibraltar Constitution Order 2006|Gibraltar constitution]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/constitution/Gibraltar_Constitution_Order_2006.pdf |title=The Gibraltar Constitution Order 2006 |publisher=Gibraltarlaws.gov.gi |date=2006-12-14 |accessdate=2013-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115055815/http://www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/constitution/Gibraltar_Constitution_Order_2006.pdf |archive-date=2012-11-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and, since the United Kingdom also gave assurances that the right to self-determination of Gibraltarians would be respected in any transfer of sovereignty over the territory, is a factor in the dispute with Spain over the territory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.uoregon.edu/org/oril/docs/9-1/Leathley.pdf |title=Gibraltar's Quest for Self-Determination: A Critique of Gibraltar's New Constitution |publisher=OREGON REVIEW OF INT\u2019L LAW [Vol. 9, 2007] |year=2007 |accessdate=2013-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117100124/http://law.uoregon.edu/org/oril//docs/9-1/Leathley.pdf |archive-date=2013-01-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The impact of the right to self-determination of Gibraltarians was seen in the [[2002 Gibraltar sovereignty referendum]], where Gibraltarian voters overwhelmingly rejected a plan to share sovereignty over Gibraltar between the UK and Spain.

This sparked several nation's protest along with Great Britain's declaration on 14 December that the decision is invalid. \nDecades later {{When|date=August 2019}}, a nationalist independence movement, dubbed as the Hong Kong independence&nbsp;movement emerged in the now Communist Chinese controlled territory. It advocates the autonomous region to become a fully independent sovereign state.\n\nThe city is considered a [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative region]]&nbsp;(SAR) which, according to the PRC, enjoys a high degree of autonomy under the People's Republic of China (PRC), guaranteed under Article 2 of&nbsp;[[Hong Kong Basic Law]]<sup>[[Hong Kong independence#cite note-1|[1]]]</sup>&nbsp;(which is ratified under the&nbsp;[[Sino-British Joint Declaration]]), since the&nbsp;[[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong]]&nbsp;from the United Kingdom to the PRC in 1997. Since the handover, many Hongkongers are increasingly concerned about Beijing's growing encroachment on the territory's freedoms and the failure of the Hong Kong government to deliver 'true' democracy.<sup>[[Hong Kong independence#cite note-rally-2|[2]]]</sup>\n[[File:Hong Kong Flag 6048.JPG|thumb|upright=1.05|Pro-independence [[Flag of Hong Kong|Hong Kong flag]] put up before a football match between the [[Hong Kong national football team|Hong Kong Football Team]] and the [[China national football team]].]]\nThe&nbsp;[[2014\u201315 Hong Kong electoral reform]]&nbsp;package deeply divided the city, as it allowed Hongkongers to have universal suffrage, but Beijing would have authority to screen the candidates to restrict the electoral method for the&nbsp;[[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]]&nbsp;(CE), the highest-ranking official of the territory.

Maharaja Hari Singh, the ruler of Kashmir at the time of accession, signed the Instrument of Accession Act on October 26, 1947 as his territory was being attacked by Pakistani tribesmen. The passing of this Act allowed Jammu and Kashmir to accede to India on legal terms. When this Act was taken to Lord Mountbatten, the last viceroy of British India, he agreed to it and stated that a referendum needed to be held by the citizens in India, Pakistan, and Kashmir so that they could vote as to where Kashmir should accede to. This referendum that Mountbatten called for never took place and framed one of the legal disputes for Kashmir. In 1948 the United Nations intervened and ordered a plebiscite to be taken in order to hear the voices of the Kashmiris if they would like to accede to Pakistan or India. This plebiscite left out the right for Kashmiris to have the right of self-determination and become an autonomous state. To this date the Kashmiris have been faced with numerous human rights violations committed by both India and Pakistan and have yet to gain complete autonomy which they have been seeking through self-determination.{{POV check inline|This whole paragraph is the only edit by a new user on a contentious topic, so I suspect NPOV issues.|date=September 2018}} {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable sources needed for the entire paragraph.|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe insurgency in Kashmir against Indian rule has existed in various forms. A widespread armed insurgency started in Kashmir against India rule in 1989 after allegations of rigging by the Indian government in the 1987 Jammu and Kashmir state election. This led to some parties in the state assembly forming militant wings, which acted as a catalyst for the emergence of armed insurgency in the region. The conflict over Kashmir has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.\n[[File:Indian soldiers, Kashmir (8138898130).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Indian soldiers on the streets of Kashmir during the [[Kashmir conflict|2016 unrests]].]]\nThe Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan has been accused by India of supporting and training both pro-Pakistan and pro-independence militants to fight Indian security forces in Jammu and Kashmir, a charge that Pakistan denies. According to official figures released in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly, there were 3,400 disappearance cases and the conflict has left more than 47,000 to 100,000 people dead as of July 2009. However, violence in the state had fallen sharply after the start of a slow-moving peace process between India and Pakistan. After the peace process failed in 2008, mass demonstrations against Indian rule, and also low-scale militancy have emerged again.\n\nHowever, despite boycott calls by separatist leaders in 2014, the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections saw highest voters turnout in last 25 years since insurgency erupted. As per the Indian government, it recorded more than 65% of voters turnout which was more than usual voters turnout in other state assembly elections of India. It considered as increase in faith of Kashmiri people in democratic process of India. However, activists say that the voter turnout is highly exaggerated and that elections are held under duress. Votes are cast because the people want stable governance of the state and this cannot be mistaken as an endorsement of Indian rule.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.solidarity-us.org/node/707|title=A Way Out for Kashmir? - Solidarity|publisher=}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kashmiri.com/newsletters/archive/view/listid-1-mailinglist/mailid-67-joomlacontent44typetitlelink/tmpl-component|title=January 5th \u2013 Remembrance of Self-determination in Kashmir|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Kurdistan ===\n[[File:YPJ fighters Raqqa (February 2017).jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|Kurdish [[People's Protection Units|YPG]]'s female fighters during the [[Syrian Civil War|Syrian War]]]]\n{{Main|Kurdish\u2013Turkish conflict (1978\u2013present)|Iraqi\u2013Kurdish conflict|Kurdish separatism in Iran|2012 Syrian Kurdistan rebellion}}\n[[File:Pre-referendum, pro-Kurdistan, pro-independence rally in Erbil, Kurdistan Region of Iraq 25.jpg|thumb|Pro-independence rally in [[Erbil]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] in September 2017]]\n\n[[Kurdistan]] is a historical region primarily inhabited by the [[Kurdish people]] of the Middle East. The territory is currently part of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran. There are Kurdish self-determination movements in each of the 4 states. Iraqi Kurdistan has to date achieved the largest degree of self-determination through the formation of the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]], an entity recognised by the Iraqi Federal Constitution.\n\nAlthough the right of the creation of a Kurdish state was recognized following World War I in the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], the treaty was then annulled by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]]. To date two separate Kurdish republics and one Kurdish Kingdom have declared sovereignty. The [[Republic of Ararat]] ([[A\u011fr\u0131 Province]], Turkey), the [[Republic of Mehabad]] ([[West Azerbaijan Province]], Iran) and the [[Kingdom of Kurdistan]] ([[Sulaymaniyah Governorate]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], Iraq), each of these fledgling states was crushed by military intervention. The [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] which currently holds the [[President of Iraq|Iraqi presidency]] and the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party]] which governs the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] both explicitly commit themselves to the development of Kurdish self-determination, but opinions vary as to the question of self-determination sought within the current borders and countries.\n\nEfforts towards Kurdish self-determination are considered illegal separatism by the governments of Turkey and Iran, and the movement is politically repressed in both states. This is intertwined with Kurdish nationalist insurgencies [[Kurdish separatism in Iran|in Iran]] and [[Kurdish\u2013Turkish conflict (1978\u2013present)|in Turkey]], which in turn justify and are justified by the repression of peaceful advocacy. In Syria, a self-governing [[Rojava|local Kurdish-dominated polity]] was established in 2012, amongst the upheaval of the [[Syrian Civil War]], but has not been recognized by any foreign state.\n\n=== Nagalim ===\n{{Main|Naga nationalism}}\n\n[[Naga people|Naga]] refers to a vaguely-defined conglomeration of distinct tribes living on the border of India and Burma.

After the British left India, a section of Nagas under the leadership of [[Angami Zapu Phizo]] sought to establish a separate country for the Nagas. Phizo's group, the [[Naga National Council]] (NNC), claimed that 99. 9% of the Nagas wanted an independent Naga country according to a referendum conducted by it.

As a strategic location in the Middle East, it was subsequently occupied by several major powers, including the empires of the Assyrians, Egyptians and Persians, from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great. Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt, the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire, Arab caliphates for a short period and the French Lusignan dynasty. Following the death in 1473 of James II, the last Lusignan king, the Republic of Venice assumed control of the island, while the late king's Venetian widow, Queen Catherine Cornaro, reigned as figurehead. Venice formally annexed the Kingdom of Cyprus in 1489, following the abdication of Catherine. The Venetians fortified Nicosia by building the Walls of Nicosia, and used it as an important commercial hub.\n\nAlthough the Lusignan French aristocracy remained the dominant social class in Cyprus throughout the medieval period, the former assumption that Greeks were treated only as serfs on the island is no longer considered by academics to be accurate. It is now accepted that the medieval period saw increasing numbers of Greek Cypriots elevated to the upper classes, a growing Greek middle ranks, and the Lusignan royal household even marrying Greeks. This included King John II of Cyprus who married Helena Palaiologina.\n\nThroughout Venetian rule, the Ottoman Empire frequently raided Cyprus. In 1539 the Ottomans destroyed Limassol and so fearing the worst, the Venetians also fortified Famagusta and Kyrenia.\n\nInvaded in 1570, Turks controlled and solely governed all of the Cyprus island from 1571 till its leasing to the United Kingdom in 1878. Cyprus was placed under British administration based on Cyprus Convention in 1878 and formally annexed by Britain in 1914. While Turkish Cypriots made up 18% of the population, the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s.

Private support from listeners, corporations, foundations and partners accounts for approximately 95 percent of CPR's total budget.\n\n==History==\nThe first station in what would become Colorado Public Radio,  [[KCFR]] (90.1 FM) in Denver, went on the air in 1970. The station was initially licensed to the [[University of Denver]]. In 1973, KCFR began carrying programming from [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), beginning with \"[[All Things Considered]].\" \"[[Morning Edition]]\" was added in 1979. More NPR programming was added the following year when the network began to distribute programming via satellite.\n\nKCFR separated from the University of Denver in 1984, becoming a community-licensed public radio station. That same year, [[KPRN]] in [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]] signed on the air. In 1991, KPRN merged with KCFR, forming the new entity Colorado Public Radio.  The original plan as proposed to the Western Slope listeners and the FCC during the license acquisition phase was to continue providing original localized programming for the needs of the Western Slope audience.  But despite protests from those listeners, within a few years the KPRN studios were closed, all volunteers and news staff positions were eliminated and it became a [[Broadcast relay station|satellite station]] of KCFR.<ref name=\"westword\">{{cite news\n | url=http://www.westword.com/music/feedback-5057557\n | title=Feedback - - Music - Denver\n | work=[[Westword]]\n | author=Michael Roberts\n | date=1997-06-12\n | accessdate=2013-08-12 }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.current.org/wp-content/themes/current/archive-site/radio/radio110kprn.html\n | title=Battle of Grand Junction, 1991\n | work=Current.org\n | author=Steve Behrens\n | date=1991-05-27\n | accessdate=2013-08-12\n | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130813013737/http://www.current.org/wp-content/themes/current/archive-site/radio/radio110kprn.html\n | archive-date=2013-08-13\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nCPR added more satellite stations in the following years, including [[KPRE]] Vail in 1994, [[KCFP]] Pueblo in 1996 and [[KPRH]] Montrose in 1998. CPR also began adding other low-power translators, sometimes in competition with existing public radio stations.  Stations in other areas not served by CPR, like [[KDNK]] in Carbondale, complained that CPR would also send out fundraising solicitation letters to KDNK listeners leaving the impression that they could thank CPR for receiving popular [[National Public Radio|NPR]] programs like All Things Considered or Morning Edition, sometimes resulting in misdirected donations.<ref name=\"westword\"/>\n\nUntil 2001, CPR's format was a mix of NPR programming and [[classical music]].  However, in 1999, CPR bought Denver classical music station [[KVOD]], a prelude to providing both a 24-hour news format and a 24-hour classical format<ref>{{cite web|title=Application Search Details, File Number: BPED-19960926MD, KVOD|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=232859|website=Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, CPR attempted to purchasing the University of Northern Colorado's FM station [[KUNC]] in a closed-door deal with then UNC President Hank Brown.  When the pending deal was announced to the public, irate devoted KUNC listeners immediately raised over $1,000,000 in a week of emergency fundraising as a successful counteroffer to CPR's, thus ending CPR's plans to acquire the KUNC radio network.\n\nIn 2001, [[KCFC]] Boulder, [[KKPC]] Pueblo and [[KPRU]] on the Western Slope joined the CPR network. In 2004, CPR brought [[KVOV]] in Glenwood Springs on the air as part of its statewide network. In 2008, CPR's news service moved to 90.1 FM, and 88.1 FM carried CPR's classical service in Denver. In 2011, CPR launched the new-music station OpenAir on [[KDCO (AM)|1340 AM as KVOQ]], and in 2015, OpenAir switched to broadcasting as [[KVOQ (FM)|KVOQ-FM]] on 102.3 FM in Denver/Boulder, and KVXQ (now Classical KVXO) on 88.3 FM in Fort Collins.\n\n== CPR News ==\nCPR News includes a locally produced program called \u201cColorado Matters,\u201d local newscasts throughout the day and national/international news from sources like NPR and the BBC. As of 2015, 13 signals broadcast CPR News throughout the state of Colorado. Over the years, Colorado Public Radio's newsroom has received a number of journalism awards, including [[Edward R.

Private support from listeners, corporations, foundations and partners accounts for approximately 95 percent of CPR's total budget.\n\n==History==\nThe first station in what would become Colorado Public Radio,  [[KCFR]] (90.1 FM) in Denver, went on the air in 1970. The station was initially licensed to the [[University of Denver]]. In 1973, KCFR began carrying programming from [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), beginning with \"[[All Things Considered]].\" \"[[Morning Edition]]\" was added in 1979. More NPR programming was added the following year when the network began to distribute programming via satellite.\n\nKCFR separated from the University of Denver in 1984, becoming a community-licensed public radio station. That same year, [[KPRN]] in [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]] signed on the air. In 1991, KPRN merged with KCFR, forming the new entity Colorado Public Radio.  The original plan as proposed to the Western Slope listeners and the FCC during the license acquisition phase was to continue providing original localized programming for the needs of the Western Slope audience.  But despite protests from those listeners, within a few years the KPRN studios were closed, all volunteers and news staff positions were eliminated and it became a [[Broadcast relay station|satellite station]] of KCFR.<ref name=\"westword\">{{cite news\n | url=http://www.westword.com/music/feedback-5057557\n | title=Feedback - - Music - Denver\n | work=[[Westword]]\n | author=Michael Roberts\n | date=1997-06-12\n | accessdate=2013-08-12 }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.current.org/wp-content/themes/current/archive-site/radio/radio110kprn.html\n | title=Battle of Grand Junction, 1991\n | work=Current.org\n | author=Steve Behrens\n | date=1991-05-27\n | accessdate=2013-08-12\n | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130813013737/http://www.current.org/wp-content/themes/current/archive-site/radio/radio110kprn.html\n | archive-date=2013-08-13\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nCPR added more satellite stations in the following years, including [[KPRE]] Vail in 1994, [[KCFP]] Pueblo in 1996 and [[KPRH]] Montrose in 1998. CPR also began adding other low-power translators, sometimes in competition with existing public radio stations.  Stations in other areas not served by CPR, like [[KDNK]] in Carbondale, complained that CPR would also send out fundraising solicitation letters to KDNK listeners leaving the impression that they could thank CPR for receiving popular [[National Public Radio|NPR]] programs like All Things Considered or Morning Edition, sometimes resulting in misdirected donations.<ref name=\"westword\"/>\n\nUntil 2001, CPR's format was a mix of NPR programming and [[classical music]].  However, in 1999, CPR bought Denver classical music station [[KVOD]], a prelude to providing both a 24-hour news format and a 24-hour classical format<ref>{{cite web|title=Application Search Details, File Number: BPED-19960926MD, KVOD|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=232859|website=Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, CPR attempted to purchasing the University of Northern Colorado's FM station [[KUNC]] in a closed-door deal with then UNC President Hank Brown.  When the pending deal was announced to the public, irate devoted KUNC listeners immediately raised over $1,000,000 in a week of emergency fundraising as a successful counteroffer to CPR's, thus ending CPR's plans to acquire the KUNC radio network.\n\nIn 2001, [[KCFC]] Boulder, [[KKPC]] Pueblo and [[KPRU]] on the Western Slope joined the CPR network. In 2004, CPR brought [[KVOV]] in Glenwood Springs on the air as part of its statewide network. In 2008, CPR's news service moved to 90.1 FM, and 88.1 FM carried CPR's classical service in Denver. In 2011, CPR launched the new-music station OpenAir on [[KDCO (AM)|1340 AM as KVOQ]], and in 2015, OpenAir switched to broadcasting as [[KVOQ (FM)|KVOQ-FM]] on 102.3 FM in Denver/Boulder, and KVXQ (now Classical KVXO) on 88.3 FM in Fort Collins.\n\n== CPR News ==\nCPR News includes a locally produced program called \u201cColorado Matters,\u201d local newscasts throughout the day and national/international news from sources like NPR and the BBC. As of 2015, 13 signals broadcast CPR News throughout the state of Colorado. Over the years, Colorado Public Radio's newsroom has received a number of journalism awards, including [[Edward R. Murrow Award (Radio Television Digital News Association)|RTNDA Edward R. Murrow Awards]],<ref>{{cite web|title=2015 Edward R.

Produced by Rachel Estabrook, Nathaniel Minor and Ben Markus, it gives the story about the Taxpayers Bill of Rights, or [[TABOR]], in Colorado.

It was a normal practice for any ruler, Muslim or Hindu, on his accession or on the conquest of new territory.\n\nNoted for his persecution of Christians, historian Thomas Paul notes that Tipu had shifted his hatred for the British to Catholics of Mangalore and other Christian communities of [[South India]].<ref>Thomas, Paul (1954), Christians and Christianity in India and Pakistan: a general survey of the progress of Christianity in India from apostolic times to the present day, Allen & Unwin, p. 235</ref> According to historian Praxy Fernandes, Tipu Sultan was \"an enlightened monarch who followed a secular policy towards his subjects.\"<ref name=\"mehta\"/>\n\n[[C. Hayavadana Rao]] wrote about Tipu in his encyclopaedic court history of Mysore. He asserted that Tipu's \"religious fanaticism and the excesses committed in the name of religion, both in Mysore and in the provinces, stand condemned for all time. His bigotry, indeed, was so great that it precluded all ideas of toleration\". He further asserts that the acts of Tipu that were constructive towards Hindus were largely political and ostentatious rather than an indication of genuine tolerance.<ref name=\"Rao\">{{cite book\n| last = Rao\n| first = Hayavadana C.\n| title = History of Mysore 1399\u20131799: Incorporating the latest Epigraphical, Literary and Historical Researches Vol. 3 pgs 1047\u201353\n| publisher = Bangalore Government Press\n}}</ref>\n\n=====Persecution of Lingayats=====\nAfter Haider Ali was appointed the military chief of the Hindu [[Wadiyar dynasty]] of Mysore and led a coup, the [[Lingayats]] of Karnataka came under Islamic rule in the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aya Ikegame|title=Princely India Re-imagined: A Historical Anthropology of Mysore from 1799 to the present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJkn2ukhLgUC&pg=PA123 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-23910-6|pages=123\u2013125}}</ref> During this period, the followers of Lingayatism were persecuted.

There were repeated attempts to capture Kodagu by the sultan and his father [[Hyder Ali]] before him. The primary reason for Sultan's interest in Kodagu was that annexing Kodagu would provide access to Mangalore port. The Kodavas knew their lands and mountains very well which made them excellent at guerrilla warfare. Kodavas were outnumbered 3 to 1 in most of Tippu's attempts to annex Kodagu but they managed to beat back Tippu most of the times by drawing his army towards hilly regions of their land. On few occasions Tippu's army managed to reach Madikeri (Capital of Kodagu) but the Kodavas always ambushed the contingent left behind by Tippu. Kodavas refusal to bow to the sultan was primarily because throughout their history they enjoyed independence, though there were Rajahs ruling over them, governance of the land mainly rested with Kodavas. After capturing Kodagu on another occasion, Tippu proclaimed, \"If you ever dare to ambush my men again, I will honor everyone of you with Islam\", undeterred, the resilient Kodavas ambushed his men yet again and drove them back to Mysore. By now Tippu realised conventional warfare would never yield him Kodagu. He devised a plan to annex Kodagu by offering his friendship. His offer of friendship was welcomed by Kodavas as the battles with the Sultan over the years had cost them dearly. When Kodavas welcomed Sultan to their land in the name of friendship, the Sultan and his men attacked them and took thousands as prisoners. -->\nTipu got Runmust Khan, the ''[[Kurnool|Nawab of Kurnool]]'', to launch a surprise attack upon the [[Kodava people|Kodava]] Hindus who were besieged by the invading Muslim army. 500 were killed and over 40,000 Kodavas fled to the woods and concealed themselves in the mountains.<ref name=\"Prabhu\">{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=223}}</ref> Thousands of Kodavas were seized along with the Raja and held captive at Seringapatam.

For instance, there were a significant number of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the 1780 [[Battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ''[[ghagra cholis]]'' and entertain the court as ''nautch'' girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of [[negro]]es, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes.<ref>William Dalrymple ''White Mughals'' (2006) p.28</ref>\n\nDuring the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the [[Mestizos]] and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics. Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n\nThe Archbishop of Goa wrote in 1800, ''\"It is notoriously known in all Asia and all other parts of the globe of the oppression and sufferings experienced by the Christians in the Dominion of the King of Kanara, during the usurpation of that country by Tipu Sultan from an implacable hatred he had against them who professed Christianity.\"''<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n[[File:James Scurry.jpg|thumb|left|The British officer [[James Scurry]], who was detained a prisoner for 10 years by Tipu Sultan along with the Mangalorean Catholics]]\nTipu Sultan's invasion of the Malabar had an adverse impact on the [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani]] community of the Malabar coast. Many churches in the [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] and [[Cochin]] were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers. A lot of centuries old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Syrian Malabar Nasrani were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Syrian Malabar farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses.

Local South India coinage had been struck in the area that became [[Mysore]] since ancient times, with the first gold coinage introduced about the 11th century (the elephant [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]), and other pagodas continuing through the following centuries. These [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]] were always in the South Indian style until the reign of [[Hyder Ali|Haidar Ali]] (1761-1782), who added pagodas with Persian legends, plus a few very rare gold mohurs and silver rupees, always in the name of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Alam II]] plus the Arabic letter \"\u062d\" as the first letter of his name. His successor, Tipu Sultan, continued to issue [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]<nowiki/>s, mohurs and [[rupee]]s, with legends that were completely new. As for copper, the new large [[paisa]] was commenced by Haidar Ali in AH1195, two years before his death, with the elephant on the obverse, the mint on the reverse, and was continued throughout the reign of Tipu Sultan, who added other denominations. Tipu Sultan introduced a set of new [[Persian language|Persian]] names for the various denominations, which appear on all of the gold and silver coins and on some of the copper. They were:\n\n'''Copper''': Qutb \"\u0642\u0637\u0628\" for the 1/8 paisa ([[Persian language|Persian]] for the [[pole star]]) -- Akhtar \"\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0631\" for the 1/4 paisa (star) -- Bahram \"\u0628\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645\" for the 1/2 paisa (the planet [[Mars]]) -- Zohra \"\u0632\u0647\u0631\u0647\" for the paisa (the planet [[Venus]]) -- either Othmani \"\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc\" for the double-paisa ([[Uthman|the third caliph]] of the Rashidun) or Mushtari \"\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc\" (the planet [[Jupiter]]).\n\n'''Silver''': Khizri \"\u062e\u0636\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/32 rupee ([[Khidr|Khizr]] the prophet) -- Kazimi \"\u06a9\u0627\u0638\u0645\u06cc\" for the 1/16 rupee (for [[Musa al-Kadhim|Musa]], the seventh Shi'ite Imam) -- Ja'fari \"\u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/8 rupee ([[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the sixth Shi'ite Imam) -- B\u00e2qiri \"\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/4 rupee ([[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the fifth Imam) -- Abidi \"\u0639\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\" for the 1/2 rupee ([[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Ali Zain al-'Abidin]], the fourth Imam) -- Imami for the rupee (reference to the [[The Twelve Imams|12 Shi'ite Imams]]) -- Haidari \"\u062d\u06cc\u062f\u0631\u06cc\" for the double-rupee (lion, for [[Ali|Ali b.

During his first 4 years, the large gold coin was the [[mohur]], with an average weight of about 10.95g (AH1197-1200), replaced with the four-pagoda of 13.74g with the calendar change to the Mauludi \"\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062f\u06cc\" system (AM1215-1219).\n\n===Coinage dating system===\nThe denomination does not appear on the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dated gold coins, but was added on all the Mauludi dated pieces.\n\nAt the beginning of his first year, Tipu Sultan abandoned the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dating system and introduced the Mauludi system (from the Arabic word \"walad \", which means \"birth \"), based on the [[Solar calendar|solar]] year and the birth year of the Prophet [[Muhammad]] (actually 571 AD, but for some perplexing reason reckoned as 572 by Tipu Sultan for his staff).\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Tipu Sultan added the name of the Indian cyclic year on the large silver and gold coins, including this double-pagoda, together with his regnal year. Each of the names is Persian, though in several examples, the meaning of the names in India was different from the Iranian meaning (not indicated here). According to the Indian meanings, these are the cyclic years: Zaki \"\u0632\u06a9\u064a\" for cyclic 37, which corresponded to his year 1 ( \"pure \") -- Az\u00e2l \"\u0623\u0632\u0644\" for 38 ( \"[[eternity]] \", year 2) -- Jalal \"\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0627\u0644\" for 39 ( \"splendor \", year 3) -- Dalv \"\u062f\u064e\u0644\u0648\" for 40 (the sign of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], year 4) -- Sh\u00e2 \"\u0634\u0627\u0647\" for 41 ( \"king \", year 5) -- S\u00e2r\u00e2 \"\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627\" for 42 ( \"fragrant \", year 6) -- Sar\u00e2b \"\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0628\" for 43 ( \"[[mirage]] \", for year 7) -- Shit\u00e2 \"\u0634\u062a\u0627\" for 44 ( \"winter \", year 8) -- Zabarjad \"\u0632\u0628\u0631\u062c\u062f\" for 45 ( \"topaz \", year 9) -- sahar \"\u0633\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0631\" ( \"[[dawn]] \", year 10) -- S\u00e2her \"\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0650\u0631\" ( \"magician \", year 11).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coinarchives.com/w/lotviewer.php?LotID=3800760&AucID=3949&Lot=2596&Val=8b527bcdc15cad93b00771f495bbf0ca|title=CoinArchives.com Lot Viewer|website=www.coinarchives.com|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==Assessment and legacy==\n[[File:Double paisa of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|right|Among his many innovations, Tipu introduced new coin denominations and new coin types, including this handsome copper double paisa weighing over 23 gm.

Successive [[Indian National Congress]] governments have often celebrated Tipu Sultan's memory and monuments and relics of his rule while the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] has been largely critical.

Kirkpatrick ''Select Letters of Tipu Sultan'', London 1811</ref> and [[Mark Wilks]],<ref>M.

A bunch of about 30 letters written in [[Kannada]], which were exchanged between Tipu Sultan's court and the [[Sringeri]] [[Shankaracharya]] were discovered in 1916 by the Director of Archaeology in [[Mysore]].

There were repeated attempts to capture Kodagu by the sultan and his father [[Hyder Ali]] before him. The primary reason for Sultan's interest in Kodagu was that annexing Kodagu would provide access to Mangalore port. The Kodavas knew their lands and mountains very well which made them excellent at guerrilla warfare. Kodavas were outnumbered 3 to 1 in most of Tippu's attempts to annex Kodagu but they managed to beat back Tippu most of the times by drawing his army towards hilly regions of their land. On few occasions Tippu's army managed to reach Madikeri (Capital of Kodagu) but the Kodavas always ambushed the contingent left behind by Tippu. Kodavas refusal to bow to the sultan was primarily because throughout their history they enjoyed independence, though there were Rajahs ruling over them, governance of the land mainly rested with Kodavas. After capturing Kodagu on another occasion, Tippu proclaimed, \"If you ever dare to ambush my men again, I will honor everyone of you with Islam\", undeterred, the resilient Kodavas ambushed his men yet again and drove them back to Mysore. By now Tippu realised conventional warfare would never yield him Kodagu. He devised a plan to annex Kodagu by offering his friendship. His offer of friendship was welcomed by Kodavas as the battles with the Sultan over the years had cost them dearly. When Kodavas welcomed Sultan to their land in the name of friendship, the Sultan and his men attacked them and took thousands as prisoners. -->\nTipu got Runmust Khan, the ''[[Kurnool|Nawab of Kurnool]]'', to launch a surprise attack upon the [[Kodava people|Kodava]] Hindus who were besieged by the invading Muslim army. 500 were killed and over 40,000 Kodavas fled to the woods and concealed themselves in the mountains.<ref name=\"Prabhu\">{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=223}}</ref> Thousands of Kodavas were seized along with the Raja and held captive at Seringapatam.

For instance, there were a significant number of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the 1780 [[Battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ''[[ghagra cholis]]'' and entertain the court as ''nautch'' girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of [[negro]]es, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes.<ref>William Dalrymple ''White Mughals'' (2006) p.28</ref>\n\nDuring the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the [[Mestizos]] and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics. Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n\nThe Archbishop of Goa wrote in 1800, ''\"It is notoriously known in all Asia and all other parts of the globe of the oppression and sufferings experienced by the Christians in the Dominion of the King of Kanara, during the usurpation of that country by Tipu Sultan from an implacable hatred he had against them who professed Christianity.\"''<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n[[File:James Scurry.jpg|thumb|left|The British officer [[James Scurry]], who was detained a prisoner for 10 years by Tipu Sultan along with the Mangalorean Catholics]]\nTipu Sultan's invasion of the Malabar had an adverse impact on the [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani]] community of the Malabar coast. Many churches in the [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] and [[Cochin]] were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers. A lot of centuries old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Syrian Malabar Nasrani were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Syrian Malabar farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses.

Local South India coinage had been struck in the area that became [[Mysore]] since ancient times, with the first gold coinage introduced about the 11th century (the elephant [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]), and other pagodas continuing through the following centuries. These [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]] were always in the South Indian style until the reign of [[Hyder Ali|Haidar Ali]] (1761-1782), who added pagodas with Persian legends, plus a few very rare gold mohurs and silver rupees, always in the name of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Alam II]] plus the Arabic letter \"\u062d\" as the first letter of his name. His successor, Tipu Sultan, continued to issue [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]<nowiki/>s, mohurs and [[rupee]]s, with legends that were completely new. As for copper, the new large [[paisa]] was commenced by Haidar Ali in AH1195, two years before his death, with the elephant on the obverse, the mint on the reverse, and was continued throughout the reign of Tipu Sultan, who added other denominations. Tipu Sultan introduced a set of new [[Persian language|Persian]] names for the various denominations, which appear on all of the gold and silver coins and on some of the copper. They were:\n\n'''Copper''': Qutb \"\u0642\u0637\u0628\" for the 1/8 paisa ([[Persian language|Persian]] for the [[pole star]]) -- Akhtar \"\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0631\" for the 1/4 paisa (star) -- Bahram \"\u0628\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645\" for the 1/2 paisa (the planet [[Mars]]) -- Zohra \"\u0632\u0647\u0631\u0647\" for the paisa (the planet [[Venus]]) -- either Othmani \"\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc\" for the double-paisa ([[Uthman|the third caliph]] of the Rashidun) or Mushtari \"\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc\" (the planet [[Jupiter]]).\n\n'''Silver''': Khizri \"\u062e\u0636\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/32 rupee ([[Khidr|Khizr]] the prophet) -- Kazimi \"\u06a9\u0627\u0638\u0645\u06cc\" for the 1/16 rupee (for [[Musa al-Kadhim|Musa]], the seventh Shi'ite Imam) -- Ja'fari \"\u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/8 rupee ([[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the sixth Shi'ite Imam) -- B\u00e2qiri \"\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/4 rupee ([[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the fifth Imam) -- Abidi \"\u0639\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\" for the 1/2 rupee ([[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Ali Zain al-'Abidin]], the fourth Imam) -- Imami for the rupee (reference to the [[The Twelve Imams|12 Shi'ite Imams]]) -- Haidari \"\u062d\u06cc\u062f\u0631\u06cc\" for the double-rupee (lion, for [[Ali|Ali b. Abi Talib]], who was both the fourth caliph and the first Shi'ite Imam).\n\n'''Gold''': Faruqi \"\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0642\u06cc\" for the pagoda ([[Umar|Umar al-Faruq]], the second caliph) -- Sad\u00eeqi \"\u0635\u062f\u06cc\u0642\u06cc\" for the double-pagoda ([[Abu Bakr]] al-Sadiq, the first caliph) -- Ahmadi \"\u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f\u06cc\" for the four-pagoda ( \"most praised \", one of the name of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]). During his first 4 years, the large gold coin was the [[mohur]], with an average weight of about 10.95g (AH1197-1200), replaced with the four-pagoda of 13.74g with the calendar change to the Mauludi \"\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062f\u06cc\" system (AM1215-1219).\n\n===Coinage dating system===\nThe denomination does not appear on the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dated gold coins, but was added on all the Mauludi dated pieces.\n\nAt the beginning of his first year, Tipu Sultan abandoned the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dating system and introduced the Mauludi system (from the Arabic word \"walad \", which means \"birth \"), based on the [[Solar calendar|solar]] year and the birth year of the Prophet [[Muhammad]] (actually 571 AD, but for some perplexing reason reckoned as 572 by Tipu Sultan for his staff).\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Tipu Sultan added the name of the Indian cyclic year on the large silver and gold coins, including this double-pagoda, together with his regnal year. Each of the names is Persian, though in several examples, the meaning of the names in India was different from the Iranian meaning (not indicated here). According to the Indian meanings, these are the cyclic years: Zaki \"\u0632\u06a9\u064a\" for cyclic 37, which corresponded to his year 1 ( \"pure \") -- Az\u00e2l \"\u0623\u0632\u0644\" for 38 ( \"[[eternity]] \", year 2) -- Jalal \"\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0627\u0644\" for 39 ( \"splendor \", year 3) -- Dalv \"\u062f\u064e\u0644\u0648\" for 40 (the sign of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], year 4) -- Sh\u00e2 \"\u0634\u0627\u0647\" for 41 ( \"king \", year 5) -- S\u00e2r\u00e2 \"\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627\" for 42 ( \"fragrant \", year 6) -- Sar\u00e2b \"\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0628\" for 43 ( \"[[mirage]] \", for year 7) -- Shit\u00e2 \"\u0634\u062a\u0627\" for 44 ( \"winter \", year 8) -- Zabarjad \"\u0632\u0628\u0631\u062c\u062f\" for 45 ( \"topaz \", year 9) -- sahar \"\u0633\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0631\" ( \"[[dawn]] \", year 10) -- S\u00e2her \"\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0650\u0631\" ( \"magician \", year 11).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coinarchives.com/w/lotviewer.php?LotID=3800760&AucID=3949&Lot=2596&Val=8b527bcdc15cad93b00771f495bbf0ca|title=CoinArchives.com Lot Viewer|website=www.coinarchives.com|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==Assessment and legacy==\n[[File:Double paisa of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|right|Among his many innovations, Tipu introduced new coin denominations and new coin types, including this handsome copper double paisa weighing over 23 gm.
