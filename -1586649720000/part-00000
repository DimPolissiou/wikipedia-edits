He described the religious prohibitions thereof as criminal, and argued that the United Nations' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|declaration]] of the human \"[[right to life]]\" played into the hands of religious campaigners.\nAccording to Rajneesh, one has no right to knowingly inflict a lifetime of suffering: life should begin only at birth, and even then, \"If a child is born [[deaf-mute|deaf, dumb]], and we cannot do anything, and the parents are willing, the child should be put to eternal sleep\" rather than \"take the risk of burdening the earth with a crippled, blind child.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} He argued that this simply freed the soul to inhabit a healthy body instead: \"Only the body goes back into its basic elements; the soul will fly into another womb. Nothing is destroyed. If you really love the child, you will not want him to live a seventy-year-long life in misery, suffering, sickness, old age. So even if a child is born, if he is not medically capable of enjoying life fully with all the senses, healthy, then it is better that he goes to eternal sleep and is born somewhere else with a better body.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nHe stated that the decision to have a child should be a medical matter, and that oversight of population and genetics must be kept in the realm of science, outside of politicians' control: \"If genetics is in the hands of Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, what will be the fate of the world?\" He believed that in the right hands, these measures could be used for good: \"Once we know how to change the program, thousands of possibilities open up. We can give every man and woman the best of everything. There is no need for anyone to suffer unnecessarily.

India, and as the \"Rolls-Royce guru\" in the United States.<ref name=\"Gordon114\" /> He attacked traditional concepts of nationalism, openly expressed contempt for politicians, and poked fun at the

movement was widely considered a [[cult]]. Rajneesh was seen to live \"in ostentation and offensive opulence\", while his followers, most of whom had severed ties with outside friends and family and donated all or most of their money and possessions to the commune, might be at a mere \"subsistence level\".<ref name=Zaitz4 /><ref name=Galanter>{{harvnb|Galanter|1989|pp=95\u201396, 102}}</ref>\n\n=== Appraisal by scholars of religion ===\nAcademic assessments of Rajneesh's work have been mixed and often directly contradictory. Uday Mehta saw errors in his interpretation of Zen and [[Mahayana Buddhism]], speaking of \"gross contradictions and inconsistencies in his teachings\" that \"exploit\" the \"ignorance and gullibility\" of his listeners.<ref name=Mehta>{{harvnb|Mehta|1993|p=151}}</ref> The sociologist Bob Mullan wrote in 1983 of \"a borrowing of truths, half-truths and occasional misrepresentations from the great traditions\"... often bland, inaccurate, spurious and extremely contradictory\".<ref name=\"BM48\">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=48}}</ref> American religious studies professor [[Hugh B. Urban]] also said Rajneesh's teaching was neither original nor especially profound, and concluded that most of its content had been borrowed from various Eastern and Western philosophies.<ref name=\"HBU-ZTB169\" /> [[George Chryssides]], on the other hand, found such descriptions of Rajneesh's teaching as a \"potpourri\" of various religious teachings unfortunate because Rajneesh was \"no amateur philosopher\". Drawing attention to Rajneesh's academic background he stated that; \"Whether or not one accepts his teachings, he was no charlatan when it came to expounding the ideas of others.\"<ref name=\"Chryss207-208\" /> He described Rajneesh as primarily a Buddhist teacher, promoting an independent form of \"Beat Zen\"<ref name=\"Chryss207-208\">{{harvnb|Chryssides|1999|pp=207\u2013208}}</ref> and viewed the unsystematic, contradictory and outrageous aspects of Rajneesh's teachings as seeking to induce a change in people, not as philosophy lectures aimed at intellectual understanding of the subject.<ref name=\"Chryss207-208\" />\n\nSimilarly with respect to Rajneesh's embracing of Western counter-culture and the human potential movement, though Mullan acknowledged that Rajneesh's range and imagination were second to none,<ref name=\"BM48\" /> and that many of his statements were quite insightful and moving, perhaps even profound at times,<ref name=\"BM32\">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=32}}</ref> he perceived \"a potpourri of counter-culturalist and post-counter-culturalist ideas\" focusing on love and freedom, the need to live for the moment, the importance of self, the feeling of \"being okay\", the mysteriousness of life, the fun ethic, the individual's responsibility for their own destiny, and the need to drop the ego, along with fear and guilt.<ref name=\"BM48-89-90\">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|pp=48, 89\u201390}}</ref> Mehta notes that Rajneesh's appeal to his Western disciples was based on his social experiments, which established a philosophical connection between the Eastern [[Guru-shishya tradition|guru tradition]] and the Western [[growth movement]].<ref name=Mehta133 /> He saw this as a [[marketing strategy]] to meet the desires of his audience.<ref name=\"HBU-ZTB169\" /> Urban, too, viewed Rajneesh as negating a dichotomy between spiritual and material desires, reflecting the preoccupation with the body and sexuality characteristic of late [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[consumer culture]] and in tune with the socio-economic conditions of his time.<ref name=GIA183 />\n\nThe British professor of religious studies [[Peter B. Clarke]] said that most participators felt they had made progress in self-actualisation as defined by American psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]] and the [[human potential movement]].<ref name=\"Clarke466\" /> He stated that the style of therapy Rajneesh devised, with its liberal attitude towards sexuality as a sacred part of life, had proved influential among other therapy practitioners and new age groups.<ref name=\"Clarke432-433\" /> Yet Clarke believes that the main motivation of seekers joining the movement was \"neither therapy nor sex, but the prospect of becoming enlightened, in the classical Buddhist sense\".<ref name=\"Clarke466\" />\n\nIn 2005, Urban observed that Rajneesh had undergone a \"remarkable [[apotheosis]]\" after his return to India, and especially in the years since his death, going on to describe him as a powerful illustration of what [[F. Max M\u00fcller]], over a century ago, called \"that world-wide circle through which, like an electric current, Oriental thought could run to the West and Western thought return to the East\".<ref name=GIA183>{{harvnb|Forsthoefel|Humes|2005|pp=181\u2013185}}</ref> Clarke also said that Rajneesh has come to be \"seen as an important teacher within India itself\" who is \"increasingly recognised as a major spiritual teacher of the twentieth century, at the forefront of the current 'world-accepting' trend of spirituality based on self-development\".<ref name=\"Clarke432-433\">{{harvnb|Clarke|2006|pp=432\u2013433}}</ref>\n\n=== Appraisal as charismatic leader ===\nA number of commentators have remarked upon Rajneesh's charisma. Comparing Rajneesh with [[Gurdjieff]], [[Anthony Storr]] wrote that Rajneesh was \"personally extremely impressive\", noting that \"many of those who visited him for the first time felt that their most intimate feelings were instantly understood, that they were accepted and unequivocally welcomed rather than judged.

Nothing is destroyed. If you really love the child, you will not want him to live a seventy-year-long life in misery, suffering, sickness, old age.

spiritual leaders to have emerged from India in the twentieth century.<ref name=Mehta133>{{harvnb|Mehta|1993|p=133}}</ref><ref name=\"Chryss207-208\" /> His message of sexual, emotional, spiritual, and institutional liberation, as well as the pleasure he took in causing offence, ensured that his life was surrounded by controversy.<ref name=\"JMF7\"/> Rajneesh became known as the \"sex guru\" in India, and as the \"Rolls-Royce guru\" in the United States.<ref name=\"Gordon114\" /> He attacked traditional concepts of nationalism, openly expressed contempt for politicians, and poked fun at the leading figures of various religions, who in turn found his arrogance insufferable.<ref>{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=1}}</ref><ref name=Mehta83>{{harvnb|Mehta|1993|p=83}}</ref> His teachings on sex, marriage, family, and relationships contradicted traditional values and aroused a great deal of anger and opposition around the world.<ref name=\"NYT160981\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=2}}</ref> His movement was widely considered a [[cult]]. Rajneesh was seen to live \"in ostentation and offensive opulence\", while his followers, most of whom had severed ties with outside friends and family and donated all or most of their money and possessions to the commune, might be at a mere \"subsistence level\".<ref name=Zaitz4 /><ref name=Galanter>{{harvnb|Galanter|1989|pp=95\u201396, 102}}</ref>\n\n=== Appraisal by scholars of religion ===\nAcademic assessments of Rajneesh's work have been mixed and often directly contradictory. Uday Mehta saw errors in his interpretation of Zen and [[Mahayana Buddhism]], speaking of \"gross contradictions and inconsistencies in his teachings\" that \"exploit\" the \"ignorance and gullibility\" of his listeners.<ref name=Mehta>{{harvnb|Mehta|1993|p=151}}</ref> The sociologist Bob Mullan wrote in 1983 of \"a borrowing of truths, half-truths and occasional misrepresentations from the great traditions\"... often bland, inaccurate, spurious and extremely contradictory\".<ref name=\"BM48\">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=48}}</ref> American religious studies professor [[Hugh B. Urban]] also said Rajneesh's teaching was neither original nor especially profound, and concluded that most of its content had been borrowed from various Eastern and Western philosophies.<ref name=\"HBU-ZTB169\" /> [[George Chryssides]], on the other hand, found such descriptions of Rajneesh's teaching as a \"potpourri\" of various religious teachings unfortunate because Rajneesh was \"no amateur philosopher\". Drawing attention to Rajneesh's academic background he stated that; \"Whether or not one accepts his teachings, he was no charlatan when it came to expounding the ideas of others.\"<ref name=\"Chryss207-208\" /> He described Rajneesh as primarily a Buddhist teacher, promoting an independent form of \"Beat Zen\"<ref name=\"Chryss207-208\">{{harvnb|Chryssides|1999|pp=207\u2013208}}</ref> and viewed the unsystematic, contradictory and outrageous aspects of Rajneesh's teachings as seeking to induce a change in people, not as philosophy lectures aimed at intellectual understanding of the subject.<ref name=\"Chryss207-208\" />\n\nSimilarly with respect to Rajneesh's embracing of Western counter-culture and the human potential movement, though Mullan acknowledged that Rajneesh's range and imagination were second to none,<ref name=\"BM48\" /> and that many of his statements were quite insightful and moving, perhaps even profound at times,<ref name=\"BM32\">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=32}}</ref> he perceived \"a potpourri of counter-culturalist and post-counter-culturalist ideas\" focusing on love and freedom, the need to live for the moment, the importance of self, the feeling of \"being okay\", the mysteriousness of life, the fun ethic, the individual's responsibility for their own destiny, and the need to drop the ego, along with fear and guilt.<ref name=\"BM48-89-90\">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|pp=48, 89\u201390}}</ref> Mehta notes that Rajneesh's appeal to his Western disciples was based on his social experiments, which established a philosophical connection between the Eastern [[Guru-shishya tradition|guru tradition]] and the Western [[growth movement]].<ref name=Mehta133 /> He saw this as a [[marketing strategy]] to meet the desires of his audience.<ref name=\"HBU-ZTB169\" /> Urban, too, viewed Rajneesh as negating a dichotomy between spiritual and material desires, reflecting the preoccupation with the body and sexuality characteristic of late [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[consumer culture]] and in tune with the socio-economic conditions of his time.<ref name=GIA183 />\n\nThe British professor of religious studies [[Peter B. Clarke]] said that most participators felt they had made progress in self-actualisation as defined by American psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]] and the [[human potential movement]].<ref name=\"Clarke466\" /> He stated that the style of therapy Rajneesh devised, with its liberal attitude towards sexuality as a sacred part of life, had proved influential among other therapy practitioners and new age groups.<ref name=\"Clarke432-433\" /> Yet Clarke believes that the main motivation of seekers joining the movement was \"neither therapy nor sex, but the prospect of becoming enlightened, in the classical Buddhist sense\".<ref name=\"Clarke466\" />\n\nIn 2005, Urban observed that Rajneesh had undergone a \"remarkable [[apotheosis]]\" after his return to India, and especially in the years since his death, going on to describe him as a powerful illustration of what [[F. Max M\u00fcller]], over a century ago, called \"that world-wide circle through which, like an electric current, Oriental thought could run to the West and Western thought return to the East\".<ref name=GIA183>{{harvnb|Forsthoefel|Humes|2005|pp=181\u2013185}}</ref> Clarke also said that Rajneesh has come to be \"seen as an important teacher within India itself\" who is \"increasingly recognised as a major spiritual teacher of the twentieth century, at the forefront of the current 'world-accepting' trend of spirituality based on self-development\".<ref name=\"Clarke432-433\">{{harvnb|Clarke|2006|pp=432\u2013433}}</ref>\n\n=== Appraisal as charismatic leader ===\nA number of commentators have remarked upon Rajneesh's charisma. Comparing Rajneesh with [[Gurdjieff]], [[Anthony Storr]] wrote that Rajneesh was \"personally extremely impressive\", noting that \"many of those who visited him for the first time felt that their most intimate feelings were instantly understood, that they were accepted and unequivocally welcomed rather than judged. [Rajneesh] seemed to radiate energy and to awaken hidden possibilities in those who came into contact with him\".<ref name=Storr47>{{harvnb|Storr|1996|p=47}}</ref> Many sannyasins have stated that hearing Rajneesh speak, they \"fell in love with him\".<ref name=\"SJP122\">{{harvnb|Palmer|1988|p=122}}, reprinted in {{harvnb|Aveling|1999|p=368}}</ref><ref name=\"BM67\">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=67}}</ref> Susan J. Palmer noted that even critics attested to the power of his presence.<ref name=\"SJP122\" /> James S. Gordon, a psychiatrist and researcher, recalls inexplicably finding himself laughing like a child, hugging strangers and having tears of gratitude in his eyes after a glance by Rajneesh from within his passing Rolls-Royce.<ref name=Gordon109>{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|p=109}}</ref> [[Frances FitzGerald (journalist)|Frances FitzGerald]] concluded upon listening to Rajneesh in person that he was a brilliant lecturer, and expressed surprise at his talent as a comedian, which had not been apparent from reading his books, as well as the hypnotic quality of his talks, which had a profound effect on his audience.<ref name=\"FF2-106\">{{harvnb|FitzGerald|1986b|p=106}}</ref> Hugh Milne (Swami Shivamurti), an ex-devotee who between 1973 and 1982 worked closely with Rajneesh as leader of the Poona Ashram Guard<ref>{{harvnb|Wallis|1986|p=159}}</ref> and as his personal bodyguard,<ref>{{harvnb|Clarke|1988|p=67}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Belfrage|1981|p=137}}</ref> noted that their first meeting left him with a sense that far more than words had passed between them: \"There is no invasion of privacy, no alarm, but it is as if his soul is slowly slipping inside mine, and in a split second transferring vital information.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Milne|1986|p=48}}</ref> Milne also observed another facet of Rajneesh's charismatic ability in stating that he was \"a brilliant manipulator of the unquestioning disciple\".<ref>{{harvnb|Milne|1986|p=307}}</ref>\n\nHugh B. Urban said that Rajneesh appeared to fit with [[Max Weber]]'s classical image of [[charismatic authority|the charismatic figure]], being held to possess \"an extraordinary supernatural power or 'grace', which was essentially irrational and affective\".<ref name=\"HBU-ZTB168\">{{harvnb|Urban|1996|p=168}}</ref> Rajneesh corresponded to Weber's pure charismatic type in rejecting all rational laws and institutions and claiming to subvert all hierarchical authority, though Urban said that the promise of absolute freedom inherent in this resulted in bureaucratic organisation and institutional control within larger communes.<ref name=\"HBU-ZTB168\" />\n\nSome scholars have suggested that Rajneesh, may have had a [[narcissism|narcissistic]] personality.<ref>{{harvnb|Storr|1996|p=50}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Huth|1993|pp=204\u2013226}}</ref><ref name=clarke /> In his paper ''The Narcissistic Guru: A Profile of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh'', Ronald O. Clarke, Emeritus Professor of Religious Studies at [[Oregon State University]], argued that Rajneesh exhibited all the typical features of [[narcissistic personality disorder]], such as a grandiose sense of self-importance and uniqueness; a preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success; a need for constant attention and admiration; a set of characteristic responses to threats to self-esteem; disturbances in interpersonal relationships; a preoccupation with [[personal grooming]] combined with frequent resorting to prevarication or outright lying; and a lack of empathy.<ref name=clarke /> Drawing on Rajneesh's reminiscences of his childhood in his book ''Glimpses of a Golden Childhood'', he suggested that Rajneesh suffered from a fundamental lack of [[parental discipline]], due to his growing up in the care of overindulgent grandparents.<ref name=clarke /> Rajneesh's self-avowed Buddha status, he concluded, was part of a [[delusion]]al system associated with his narcissistic personality disorder; a condition of ego-inflation rather than egolessness.<ref name=clarke>{{harvnb|Clarke|1988|p=}}, reprinted in {{harvnb|Aveling|1999|pp=55\u201389}}</ref>\n\n=== Wider appraisal as a thinker and speaker ===\nThere are widely divergent assessments of Rajneesh's qualities as a thinker and speaker. [[Khushwant Singh]], an eminent author, historian, and former editor of the ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', has described Rajneesh as \"the most original thinker that India has produced: the most erudite, the most clearheaded and the most innovative\".<ref name=Bhawuk>{{harvnb|Bhawuk|2003|p=14}}</ref> Singh believes that Rajneesh was a \"free-thinking agnostic\" who had the ability to explain the most abstract concepts in simple language, illustrated with witty anecdotes, who mocked gods, [[prophet]]s, scriptures, and religious practices, and gave a totally new dimension to religion.<ref>Khushwant Singh, writing in the ''[[Indian Express]]'', 25 December 1988, quoted e.g., [https://web.archive.org/web/20030523024043/http://www.indiaclub.com/Shop/SearchResults.asp?prodstock=11216 here]</ref> German philosopher [[Peter Sloterdijk]], a one time devotee of Rajneesh's (living at the Pune ashram from 1978 to 1980), described him as a \"[[Wittgenstein]] of religions\", ranking him as one of the greatest figures of the 20th century; in his view, Rajneesh had performed a radical deconstruction of the word games played by the world's religions.<ref>{{harvnb|Sloterdijk|1996|p=105}}</ref><ref>[https://petersloterdijk.net/vita/ Peter Sloterdijk vita]. Retrieved 16 October 2019.</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1980s, a number of commentators in the popular press were dismissive of Rajneesh.<ref name=\"BM8-9\" /> The Australian critic [[Clive James]] scornfully referred to him as \"Bagwash\", likening the experience of listening to one of his discourses to sitting in a laundrette and watching \"your tattered underwear revolve soggily for hours while exuding grey suds. The Bagwash talks the way that looks.\"<ref name=\"BM8-9\">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|pp=8\u20139}}</ref><ref name=Bagwash /> James finished by saying that Rajneesh, though a \"fairly benign example of his type\", was a \"rebarbative dingbat who manipulates the manipulable into manipulating one another\".<ref name=\"BM8-9\" /><ref name=Bagwash /><ref>\"Adieu to God: Why Psychology Leads to Atheism\" Mick Power. p114</ref> Responding to an enthusiastic review of Rajneesh's talks by [[Bernard Levin]] in ''[[The Times]]'', Dominik Wujastyk, also writing in ''The Times'', similarly expressed his opinion that the talk he heard while visiting the Poona ''ashram'' was of a very low standard, wearyingly repetitive and often factually wrong, and stated that he felt disturbed by the [[personality cult]] surrounding Rajneesh.<ref name=\"BM8-9\" /><ref>(10 August 2004) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090621002100/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1469028/Bernard-Levin.html Obituary of Bernard Levin], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

Robbins, while stressing that he was not a disciple, further stated that he had \"read enough vicious propaganda and slanted reports to suspect that he was one of the most maligned figures in history\".<ref name=Bhawuk /> Rajneesh's commentary on the [[Sikh]] scripture known as ''[[Japuji]]'' was hailed as the best available by [[Giani Zail Singh]], the former [[President of India]].<ref name=\"TJ\" /> In 2011, author [[Farrukh Dhondy]] reported that film star [[Kabir Bedi]] was a fan of Rajneesh, and viewed Rajneesh's works as \"the most sublime interpretations of Indian philosophy that he had come across\". Dhondy himself said Rajneesh was \"the cleverest intellectual confidence trickster that India has produced. His output of the 'interpretation' of Indian texts is specifically slanted towards a generation of disillusioned westerners who wanted (and perhaps still want) to 'have their cake, eat it' [and] claim at the same time that cake-eating is the highest virtue according to ancient-fused-with-scientific wisdom.\"<ref>(25 April 2011) [[Farrukh Dhondy]].

It includes all unified [[CJK characters]] found in GB13000.1-93, i.e. ISO/IEC 10646:1993, or [[Unicode]] 1.1. Since its initial release in 1993, GBK has been extended by Microsoft in '''[[Code page 1386|Code page 936/1386]]''', which was then extended into '''[[#GBK 1.0|GBK 1.0]]'''. '''GBK''' is also the IANA-registered internet name for the Microsoft mapping,<ref name=iana>{{cite web|title=Character Sets|url=https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml|accessdate=3 October 2016}}</ref> which differs from other implementations primarily by the single-byte [[euro sign]] at 0x80.\n\n''GB'' abbreviates [[guobiao|Guojia Biaozhun]], which means ''national standard'' in Chinese, while ''K'' stands for ''Extension'' (\u6269\u5c55 ''ku\u00f2zh\u01cen''). GBK not only extended the old standard GB2312 with Traditional Chinese characters, but also with Chinese characters that were simplified after the establishment of GB2312 in 1981. With the arrival of GBK, certain names with characters formerly unrepresentable, like the \u9555 (''r\u00f3ng'') character in former Chinese Premier [[Zhu Rongji|Zhu Rongji's]] name, are now representable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/unicode/936.txt |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001194325/http://www.microsoft.com/typography/unicode/936.txt |title=Code Page 936 - PRC GBK (XGB) |archivedate=2002-10-01 |url-status=dead}} Conversion map between [[Code page 1386|Codepage 936]] and Unicode.

Following this, China released GB13000.1-93, the [[Guobiao standard]] equivalent of Unicode 1.1.\n\n{{anchor|1993}}The '''GBK''' character set was defined in 1993 as an extension of [[GB2312]]-80, while also including the characters of GB13000.1-93 through the unused codepoints available in GB2312.  Hence GBK is backward compatible with GB2312.\n\n{{anchor|cp936}}Microsoft implemented GBK in [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows NT 3.51]] as '''[[Code page 1386|Code Page 936]]'''.  While GBK was never an official standard, widespread usage of Windows 95 led to GBK becoming the ''de facto'' standard. While GBK included all the Chinese characters defined in Unicode 1.1 and GB13000.1-93, these standards used different code tables. The primary reason for its existence was simply to bridge the gap between GB2312-80 and GB13000.1-93.\n\n{{anchor|GBK 1.0}}In 1995, China National Information Technology Standardization Technical Committee set down the Chinese Internal Code Extension Specification ({{lang-zh|s=\u6c49\u5b57\u5185\u7801\u6269\u5c55\u89c4\u8303 (GBK)|p=H\u00e0nz\u00ec N\u00e8im\u01ce Ku\u00f2zh\u01cen Gu\u012bf\u00e0n (GBK)}}), Version 1.0, known as '''GBK&nbsp;1.0''', which is a slight extension of Codepage 936. The newly added 95 characters were not found in GB&nbsp;13000.1-1993, and were provisionally assigned Unicode [[Private Use Areas|PUA]] code points.<ref name=\"gb18030-2005\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/GB18030-2005|title=GB 18030-2005: Information Technology\u2014Chinese coded character set|last=Standardization Administration of China (SAC)|date=2005-11-18}}</ref>{{Rp|534}}\n\nMicrosoft later added the [[euro sign]] to Code page 936 and assigned the code 0x80 to it. This is not a valid code point in GBK&nbsp;1.0.\n\n{{anchor|gb18030}}In 2000, the [[GB18030]]-2000 standard was released, superseding yet maintaining compatibility with GBK&nbsp;1.0. It increased the number of definitions of Chinese characters and extended the number of possible characters through the implementation of four-byte character spaces. The subset of GB&nbsp;18030 consisting of one-byte and two-byte characters is sometimes also referred to as '''GBK'''. Mapping to Unicode has been slightly changed, though, as some characters are now defined in Unicode. In the most up-to-date form of the standard, GB&nbsp;18030-2005, only 24<ref>GB 18030-2005 Standard p.9, 79</ref> characters are still mapped to Unicode PUA (see [[GB 18030#PUA]].)\n\nIn 2002, '''GBK''' was registered as an IANA charset; the registration uses [[Code page 1386|code page 936]] mapping as well as CP936/MS936 aliases, but refers to GBK&nbsp;1.0 specification.<ref name=iana/> {{anchor|W3C}}[[W3C]]'s technical recommendation published in 2015<ref>{{cite web|title=Encoding Standard # gbk-encoder|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/encoding/#gbk-encoder|website=W3C|accessdate=2016-10-02}}</ref> defines a '''GBK''' encoder as a GB&nbsp;18030 encoder with a single-byte euro sign and without four-byte sequences.\n\n==Encoding==\nA character is encoded as 1 or 2 bytes.  A byte in the range <code>00</code>\u2013<code>7F</code> is a single byte that means the same thing as it does in [[ASCII]].  Strictly speaking, there are 95 characters and 33 control codes in this range.\n\nA byte with the high bit set indicates that it is the first of 2 bytes.  Loosely speaking, the first byte is in the range <code>81</code>\u2013<code>FE</code> (that is, never <code>80</code> or <code>FF</code>), and the second byte is <code>40</code>\u2013<code>A0</code> except <code>7F</code> for some areas and <code>A1</code>\u2013<code>FE</code> for others.\n\nMore specifically, the following ranges of bytes are defined:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+GBK Encoding Ranges\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|range || rowspan=\"2\"|byte 1 || rowspan=\"2\"|byte 2 || rowspan=\"2\"|code points || colspan=\"4\"|characters\n|-\n!GB 18030 || GBK 1.0 || Codepage 936 || GB 2312\n|-\n|Level [[GB2312 Blocks#Block 1-9: Signs|GBK/1]] || <code>A1</code>\u2013<code>A9</code> || <code>A1</code>\u2013<code>FE</code>\n|align=\"right\"|846 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|718<ref name=gb18030-2005/>{{rp|8&ndash;10}} || style=\"text-align:right;\"|717 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|715 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|682\n|-\n|Level [[GBK/2]] || <code>B0</code>\u2013<code>F7</code> || <code>A1</code>\u2013<code>FE</code> || style=\"text-align:right;\"|6,768 || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right;\"|6,763 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|6,763 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|6,763\n|-\n|Level GBK/3 || <code>81</code>\u2013<code>A0</code> || <code>40</code>\u2013<code>FE</code> except <code>7F</code>|| style=\"text-align:right;\"|6,080 || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right;\"|6,080 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|6,080 || rowspan=\"6\"|\n|-\n|Level GBK/4 || <code>AA</code>\u2013<code>FE</code> || <code>40</code>\u2013<code>A0</code> except <code>7F</code> || style=\"text-align:right;\"|8,160 || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right;\"|8,160 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|8,080\n|-\n|Level [[GBK/5]] || <code>A8</code>\u2013<code>A9</code> || <code>40</code>\u2013<code>A0</code> except <code>7F</code> || style=\"text-align:right;\"|192 || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right;\"|166 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|153\n|-\n|user-defined 1<ref name=gb18030-2005/> || <code>AA</code>\u2013<code>AF</code> || <code>A1</code>\u2013<code>FE</code> || style=\"text-align:right;\"|564 || colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|user-defined 2 || <code>F8</code>\u2013<code>FE</code> || <code>A1</code>\u2013<code>FE</code> || style=\"text-align:right;\"|658\n|-\n|user-defined 3 || <code>A1</code>\u2013<code>A7</code> || <code>40</code>\u2013<code>A0</code> except <code>7F</code> || style=\"text-align:right;\"|672\n|-\n!total: || || || style=\"text-align:right;\"|23,940 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|21,887 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|21,886 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|21,791 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|7,445\n|}\n\n===Layout diagram===\nIn graphical form, the following figure shows the space of all 64K possible 2-byte codes.

This corresponds to the lower-right quarter of the illustration above.  However, GB2312 does not assign any code points to the rows located at <code>AA</code>\u2013<code>B0</code> and <code>F8</code>\u2013<code>FE</code>, even though it had staked out the territory.  GBK added extensions to these rows.  You can see that the two gaps were filled in with user-defined areas.\n\nMore significantly, GBK extended the range of the bytes.  Having two-byte characters in the ISO-2022 GR range gives a limit of 94\u00b2=8,836 possibilities.  Abandoning the ISO-2022 model of strict regions for graphics and control characters, but retaining the feature of low bytes being 1-byte characters and pairs of high bytes denoting a character, you could potentially have 128\u00b2=16,384 positions.  GBK takes part of that, extending the range from <code>A1</code>\u2013<code>FE</code> (94 choices for each byte) to <code>81</code>\u2013<code>FE</code> (126 choices) for the first byte and <code>40</code>\u2013<code>FE</code> (191 choices) for the second byte, for a total of 24,066 positions.\n\nMicrosoft's Code Page 936 is generally thought of as being GBK.<ref name=iana/>  However, the [[GB 18030#History|95 PUA characters]] added in GBK 1.0 are not included in Code Page 936.

It includes all unified [[CJK characters]] found in GB13000.1-93, i.e. ISO/IEC 10646:1993, or [[Unicode]] 1.1. Since its initial release in 1993, GBK has been extended by Microsoft in '''[[Code page 1386|Code page 936/1386]]''', which was then extended into '''[[#GBK 1.0|GBK 1.0]]'''. '''GBK''' is also the IANA-registered internet name for the Microsoft mapping,<ref name=iana>{{cite web|title=Character Sets|url=https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml|accessdate=3 October 2016}}</ref> which differs from other implementations primarily by the single-byte [[euro sign]] at 0x80.\n\n''GB'' abbreviates [[guobiao|Guojia Biaozhun]], which means ''national standard'' in Chinese, while ''K'' stands for ''Extension'' (\u6269\u5c55 ''ku\u00f2zh\u01cen''). GBK not only extended the old standard GB2312 with Traditional Chinese characters, but also with Chinese characters that were simplified after the establishment of GB2312 in 1981. With the arrival of GBK, certain names with characters formerly unrepresentable, like the \u9555 (''r\u00f3ng'') character in former Chinese Premier [[Zhu Rongji|Zhu Rongji's]] name, are now representable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/unicode/936.txt |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001194325/http://www.microsoft.com/typography/unicode/936.txt |title=Code Page 936 - PRC GBK (XGB) |archivedate=2002-10-01 |url-status=dead}} Conversion map between [[Code page 1386|Codepage 936]] and Unicode.

Following this, China released GB13000.1-93, the [[Guobiao standard]] equivalent of Unicode 1.1.\n\n{{anchor|1993}}The '''GBK''' character set was defined in 1993 as an extension of [[GB2312]]-80, while also including the characters of GB13000.1-93 through the unused codepoints available in GB2312.  Hence GBK is backward compatible with GB2312.\n\n{{anchor|cp936}}Microsoft implemented GBK in [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows NT 3.51]] as '''[[Code page 1386|Code Page 936]]'''.  While GBK was never an official standard, widespread usage of Windows 95 led to GBK becoming the ''de facto'' standard. While GBK included all the Chinese characters defined in Unicode 1.1 and GB13000.1-93, these standards used different code tables. The primary reason for its existence was simply to bridge the gap between GB2312-80 and GB13000.1-93.\n\n{{anchor|GBK 1.0}}In 1995, China National Information Technology Standardization Technical Committee set down the Chinese Internal Code Extension Specification ({{lang-zh|s=\u6c49\u5b57\u5185\u7801\u6269\u5c55\u89c4\u8303 (GBK)|p=H\u00e0nz\u00ec N\u00e8im\u01ce Ku\u00f2zh\u01cen Gu\u012bf\u00e0n (GBK)}}), Version 1.0, known as '''GBK&nbsp;1.0''', which is a slight extension of Codepage 936. The newly added 95 characters were not found in GB&nbsp;13000.1-1993, and were provisionally assigned Unicode [[Private Use Areas|PUA]] code points.<ref name=\"gb18030-2005\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/GB18030-2005|title=GB 18030-2005: Information Technology\u2014Chinese coded character set|last=Standardization Administration of China (SAC)|date=2005-11-18}}</ref>{{Rp|534}}\n\nMicrosoft later added the [[euro sign]] to Code page 936 and assigned the code 0x80 to it. This is not a valid code point in GBK&nbsp;1.0.\n\n{{anchor|gb18030}}In 2000, the [[GB18030]]-2000 standard was released, superseding yet maintaining compatibility with GBK&nbsp;1.0. It increased the number of definitions of Chinese characters and extended the number of possible characters through the implementation of four-byte character spaces. The subset of GB&nbsp;18030 consisting of one-byte and two-byte characters is sometimes also referred to as '''GBK'''. Mapping to Unicode has been slightly changed, though, as some characters are now defined in Unicode. In the most up-to-date form of the standard, GB&nbsp;18030-2005, only 24<ref>GB 18030-2005 Standard p.9, 79</ref> characters are still mapped to Unicode PUA (see [[GB 18030#PUA]].)\n\nIn 2002, '''GBK''' was registered as an IANA charset; the registration uses [[Code page 1386|code page 936]] mapping as well as CP936/MS936 aliases, but refers to GBK&nbsp;1.0 specification.<ref name=iana/> {{anchor|W3C}}[[W3C]]'s technical recommendation published in 2015<ref>{{cite web|title=Encoding Standard # gbk-encoder|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/encoding/#gbk-encoder|website=W3C|accessdate=2016-10-02}}</ref> defines a '''GBK''' encoder as a GB&nbsp;18030 encoder with a single-byte euro sign and without four-byte sequences.\n\n==Encoding==\nA character is encoded as 1 or 2 bytes.
