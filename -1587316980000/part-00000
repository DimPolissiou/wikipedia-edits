{"title_page": "Constructed script", "text_new": "{{short description|New writing system specifically created by an individual or group, rather than having evolved as part of a language or culture like a natural script}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=January 2013}}\nA '''constructed script''' is a new [[writing system]] specifically created by an individual or group, rather than having evolved as part of a language or culture like a natural script.

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\". Squier's best selling album, 1981's [[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|''Don't Say No'']], is considered a landmark release within the arena rock genre and bridging the gap between power pop and hard rock.\n\nDescribed as a personification of early 80's rock music,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Fz2GbraVXhcpXnoi2Oe1r|title=Billy Squier|website=Spotify|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> Squier's most successful period ranges from 1981 to 1984, during which he scored five Top 10 Mainstream Rock hits (two of which were number ones), two Top 20 singles and three consecutive platinum selling albums, along with cyclic MTV rotation and radio airplay. Even after largely falling out from favour and chart success mostly because of the disastrous video for his 1984 hit \"Rock Me Tonite\", Squier has maintained his presence on the rock radio up to this day and attracted a strong cult following during the last decades, with his music being featured on many films and video games. Squier stepped out of music business after the release of his 1993 release ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]]'', but he has occasionally continued performing smaller tours and one-off performances.\n\nHis 1980 song \"The Big Beat\" is one of the most sampled drum breaks ever, being used by artists such as [[Run-DMC]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Jay-Z]], [[UTFO]] and [[Dizzee Rascal]], to name a few. \"The Stroke\" has also shared its fair amount of sampling, most notably in [[Eminem]]'s 2013 hit \"[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life and first bands (1950-1975) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as another story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971.\n\n=== Piper and solo career startoff (1975-1980) ===\nSquier had a short stint with a band called Sidewinders, but his first real experience with the music industry occurred when he left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait.'' The band was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper was managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. Squier served both as the main songwriter and frontman of the group, whose style shared similarities with power pop acts such as [[Cheap Trick]] and [[The Knack]], who were enjoying great success at the time.\n\nDespite receiving moderate success at the local rock scene, Piper broke up. Squier signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in spring 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (who has previously had short jobs in [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success: ''Don't Say No'' and ''Emotions in Motion'' (1981-1983) ===\nFollowing a small but fairly successful summer tour with [[Alice Cooper]] in 1980, Squier got in contact with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] and proposed him to produce his next album. Due to scheduling conflicts, May declined, but he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]], who had produced Queen's most recent album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack joined forces to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which attracted rave reviews and spawned three hit singles, catapulting him to stardom. The first, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well as charting high in Canada and even in Britain, where the song remains his only chart entry. \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-ups each. The album also featured \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", which became a radio favourite and one of his signature songs, despite not being released as a single (however, in Britain, it was featured as the b-side for \"In the Dark\"). Squier was also popular on the new MTV cable channel, where his straightforward performance-based videos received heavy rotation. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling over 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Retrospectively, ''Don't Say No'' is hailed as Squier's best solo album and one of the greatest rock albums of the 1980's.\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became also very successful, yet in the long run, it didn't catch its predecessor in sales. Nevertheless, the album hit #5 in both US and Canada, sold approximately 3 million copies and spawned the successful radio and video hits \"[[Emotions in Motion (Billy Squier song)|Emotions in Motion]]\" and especially \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for six weeks straight. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 [[Hot Space Tour]] and during his own tour for ''Emotions'' he finally became an arena headliner. British newcomer [[Def Leppard]] supported him and he helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their breakthrough album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> However, Leppard ended up soon overtaking Squier as the biggest arena act in the US.\n\n=== Career pinnacle and downfall: The bombastly failed ''Signs of Life'' (1984) ===\nSquier began working on his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in late 1983. After parting ways with Mack, he had planned [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]] - the man behind [[AC/DC]]'s ''[[Back in Black]]'' and [[For Those About to Rock We Salute You|''For Those About to Rock'']] as well as more recently, Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania -'' to produce the product, but he was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and suffered a breakdown afterward, which prompted Lange to retreat and Squier to continue his search just a few days before the recording process was set to start. He then brought in famed songwriter and producer [[Jim Steinman]], who was better known for his grandiose pop ballads and operatic rock songs. Both Squier's older fans and the music press reacted demurely to the Squier-Steinman team up, but since Squier admired Steinman's work on [[Meat Loaf]]'s ''[[Bat Out of Hell]] -'' which he had described as \"the most passionate and exciting rock record of our time\" - and Steinman was willing to work with a rock band, Squier stuck with him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/lick.htm|title=I'm Just Licking Them|website=Dream Pollution The Jim Steinman Web Site|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\nAt the time ''Signs of Life'' finally arrived escorted by a great anticipation in late July 1984, Squier was at the very peak of his career. Fueled by a successful radio hits \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\" and \"All Night Long\", the album brought him his third consecutive platinum certification. However, Squier's fortunes took a hit soon after the homoerotic music video for \"Rock Me Tonite\", which ironically became his highest charting single, premiered in the fall. Featuring Squier prancing around suggestively and manicly in a dark room with pink decorations and ultimately ripping his shirt (which he then changes to a pink tanktop), the video attracted embarrassed responses from critics, fans and even fellow musicians alike. It has been later cited as one of the worst music videos of all time.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales took a damage; ''Signs of Life'' ended up narrowly missing the top 10 and he stopped selling out shows, on some occasions he even played for half-empty stadiums. Squier lost his patience after realizing what was happening: he fired both of his managers and insulted the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and for altering his original concepts. Whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'', let alone \"Rock Me Tonite\", made him look like a sellout for the most of his fans.\n\n=== Brief resurgance and departure from Capitol (1985-1993) ===\nApart from a few live appearances and a new song, \"Shake Down\" for the soundtrack of the film ''[[St. Elmo's Fire]]'', Squier stayed out of the spotlight for the majority of 1985, taking some time off to prepare his next album with British producer [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]], who was known for his work with [[Nik Kershaw]], [[Gary Moore]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlists/billy-squier-2bd680be.html|title=Billy Squier Concert Setlists (page 12)|website=setlist.fm|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://performingsongwriter.com/articles-interviews/producers-engineers/peter-collins/|title=An interview with Peter Collins|publisher=www.performingsongwriter.com}}</ref> 1986 saw the release of his fifth album ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'', which was carefully crafted but still a commercial flop. The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold an estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. Squier chose not to embark on a tour since Capitol decided not to promote the album, which built strong tensions between him and the label.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' and is often regarded as one of the most consistent inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"[[Don't Say You Love Me (Billy Squier song)|Don't Say You Love Me]]\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart. It was his best charting single on both charts since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaborations \"Stronger\" and \"Tied Up\", both of which were praised. The album did briefly restore Squier's mainstream success by harking back to his early 1980's hard rock. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled All Excess was also well received. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return after the turn of the decade.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critical and audience reception were mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and one of its songs, \"The Girl's All Right\", was later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists.\n=== Later career (1994-) ===\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|date=February 18, 1998|newspaper=The New York Times|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on a concert tour that was his first bigger one since the 1991 tour for ''Creatures of Habit.''\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout! Factory released ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]: 30th Anniversary Edition'' on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years.

During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, NY in support of his friend, rock photographer [[Rob Shanahan]] and his new book, \"Volume One.\" In June, Squier performed at the \"Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner\" in New York, in another fundraising effort for '[[Little Kids Rock]].' In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for \"The American Revolution,\" a documentary on legendary rock FM station WBCN at the House Of Blues in Boston.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Squier performed his 'Electric Man' show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player. They divided their time between a home in [[Bridgehampton]], [[Long Island]] and an apartment in [[The San Remo]] on [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Squier had been, as of 2016, an active volunteer for the [[Central Park Conservancy]] for more than 17 years, physically maintaining 20 acres (81,000 m2) of the park, as well as promoting the Conservancy in articles and interviews. He also supported the Group for the East End and its native planting programs on eastern Long Island.<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Post|date=May 14, 2000|url=https://nypost.com/2000/05/14/rocker-billys-a-country-squier/|title=Rocker Billy's A Country \u2018Squier\u2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=New York Social Diary|date=September 2, 2015|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/guest-diary/2015/end-of-summer-doings-at-madoo|title=End of Summer Doings at Madoo}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Billy Squier discography}}\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n*''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' (1981)\n*''[[Emotions in Motion]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' (1986)\n*''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'' (1991)\n*''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]]'' (1993)\n*''[[Happy Blue (Billy Squier album)|Happy Blue]]'' (1998)\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n* ''[[A Rock and Roll Christmas]]'' (Various Artists Compilation) (1994)\n* ''16 Strokes: The Best of Billy Squier'' (1995)\n* ''Reach for the Sky: The Anthology'' (1996) (PolyGram)\n* ''Classic Masters'' (2002)\n* ''Absolute Hits'' (2005)\n* ''Essential Billy Squier'' (2011)\n* ''ICON'' (2013)\n\n=== Live albums ===\n* ''King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Billy Squier'' (1996)\n* ''Live In The Dark'' (DVD)\n\n===Non-album soundtrack contributions===\n*''Fast Times (The Best Years Of Our Lives)'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Fast Times At Ridgemont High]]'' (1982)\n*''On Your Own'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1984)\n*''Shake Down'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' (1985)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<!--unused<ref name=\"parker\">{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Lyndsey|title=Martha, Martha, Martha! 35 Years Later, Original VJ Quinn Remembers MTV's Early Days|url=https://www.yahoo.com/music/martha-martha-martha-35-years-later-original-vj-quinn-remembers-mtvs-early-days-042906236.html|website=Yahoo!

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\". Squier's best selling album, 1981's [[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|''Don't Say No'']], is considered a landmark release within the arena rock genre and bridging the gap between power pop and hard rock.\n\nDescribed as a personification of early 80's rock music,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Fz2GbraVXhcpXnoi2Oe1r|title=Billy Squier|website=Spotify|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> Squier's most successful period ranges from 1981 to 1984, during which he scored five Top 10 Mainstream Rock hits (two of which were number ones), two Top 20 singles and three consecutive platinum selling albums, along with cyclic MTV rotation and radio airplay. Even after largely falling out from favour and chart success mostly because of the disastrous video for his 1984 hit \"Rock Me Tonite\", Squier has maintained his presence on the rock radio up to this day and attracted a strong cult following during the last decades, with his music being featured on many films and video games. Squier stepped out of music business after the release of his 1993 release ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]]'', but he has occasionally continued performing smaller tours and one-off performances.\n\nHis 1980 song \"The Big Beat\" is one of the most sampled drum breaks ever, being used by artists such as [[Run-DMC]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Jay-Z]], [[UTFO]] and [[Dizzee Rascal]], to name a few. \"The Stroke\" has also shared its fair amount of sampling, most notably in [[Eminem]]'s 2013 hit \"[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life and first bands (1950-1975) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as another story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971.\n\n=== Piper and solo career startoff (1975-1980) ===\nSquier had a short stint with a band called Sidewinders, but his first real experience with the music industry occurred when he left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait.'' The band was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper was managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. Squier served both as the main songwriter and frontman of the group, whose style shared similarities with power pop acts such as [[Cheap Trick]] and [[The Knack]], who were enjoying great success at the time.\n\nDespite receiving moderate success at the local rock scene, Piper broke up. Squier signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in spring 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (who has previously had short jobs in [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success: ''Don't Say No'' and ''Emotions in Motion'' (1981-1983) ===\nFollowing a small but fairly successful summer tour with [[Alice Cooper]] in 1980, Squier got in contact with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] and proposed him to produce his next album. Due to scheduling conflicts, May declined, but he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]], who had produced Queen's most recent album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack joined forces to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which attracted rave reviews and spawned three hit singles, catapulting him to stardom. The first, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well as charting high in Canada and even in Britain, where the song remains his only chart entry. \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-ups each. The album also featured \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", which became a radio favourite and one of his signature songs, despite not being released as a single (however, in Britain, it was featured as the b-side for \"In the Dark\"). Squier was also popular on the new MTV cable channel, where his straightforward performance-based videos received heavy rotation. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling over 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Retrospectively, ''Don't Say No'' is hailed as Squier's best solo album and one of the greatest rock albums of the 1980's.\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became also very successful, yet in the long run, it didn't catch its predecessor in sales. Nevertheless, the album hit #5 in both US and Canada, sold approximately 3 million copies and spawned the successful radio and video hits \"[[Emotions in Motion (Billy Squier song)|Emotions in Motion]]\" and especially \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for six weeks straight. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 [[Hot Space Tour]] and during his own tour for ''Emotions'' he finally became an arena headliner. British newcomer [[Def Leppard]] supported him and he helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their breakthrough album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> However, Leppard ended up soon overtaking Squier as the biggest arena act in the US.\n\n=== Career pinnacle and downfall: The bombastly failed ''Signs of Life'' (1984) ===\nSquier began working on his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in late 1983. After parting ways with Mack, he had planned [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]] - the man behind [[AC/DC]]'s ''[[Back in Black]]'' and [[For Those About to Rock We Salute You|''For Those About to Rock'']] as well as more recently, Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania -'' to produce the product, but he was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and suffered a breakdown afterward, which prompted Lange to retreat and Squier to continue his search just a few days before the recording process was set to start. He then brought in famed songwriter and producer [[Jim Steinman]], who was better known for his grandiose pop ballads and operatic rock songs. Both Squier's older fans and the music press reacted demurely to the Squier-Steinman team up, but since Squier admired Steinman's work on [[Meat Loaf]]'s ''[[Bat Out of Hell]] -'' which he had described as \"the most passionate and and exciting rock record of our time\" - and Steinman was willing to work with a rock band, Squier stuck with him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/lick.htm|title=I'm Just Licking Them|website=Dream Pollution The Jim Steinman Web Site|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\nAt the time ''Signs of Life'' finally arrived escorted by a great anticipation in late July 1984, Squier was at the very peak of his career. Fueled by a successful radio hits \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\" and \"All Night Long\", the album brought him his third consecutive platinum certification. However, Squier's fortunes took a hit soon after the homoerotic music video for \"Rock Me Tonite\", which ironically became his highest charting single, premiered in the fall. Featuring Squier prancing around suggestively and manicly in a dark room with pink decorations and ultimately ripping his shirt (which he then changes to a pink tanktop), the video attracted embarrassed responses from critics, fans and even fellow musicians alike. It has been later cited as one of the worst music videos of all time.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales took a damage; ''Signs of Life'' ended up narrowly missing the top 10 and he stopped selling out shows, on some occasions he even played for half-empty stadiums. Squier lost his patience after realizing what was happening: he fired both of his managers and insulted the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and for altering his original concepts. Whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'', let alone \"Rock Me Tonite\", made him look like a sellout for the most of his fans.\n\n=== Brief resurgance and departure from Capitol (1985-1993) ===\nApart from a few live appearances and a new song, \"Shake Down\" for the soundtrack of the film ''[[St. Elmo's Fire]]'', Squier stayed out of the spotlight for the majority of 1985, taking some time off to prepare his next album with British producer [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]], who was known for his work with [[Nik Kershaw]], [[Gary Moore]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlists/billy-squier-2bd680be.html|title=Billy Squier Concert Setlists (page 12)|website=setlist.fm|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://performingsongwriter.com/articles-interviews/producers-engineers/peter-collins/|title=An interview with Peter Collins|publisher=www.performingsongwriter.com}}</ref> 1986 saw the release of his fifth album ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'', which was carefully crafted but still a commercial flop. The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold an estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. Squier chose not to embark on a tour since Capitol decided not to promote the album, which built strong tensions between him and the label.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' and is often regarded as one of the most consistent inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"[[Don't Say You Love Me (Billy Squier song)|Don't Say You Love Me]]\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart. It was his best charting single on both charts since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaborations \"Stronger\" and \"Tied Up\", both of which were praised. The album did briefly restore Squier's mainstream success by harking back to his early 1980's hard rock. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled All Excess was also well received. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return after the turn of the decade.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critical and audience reception were mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and one of its songs, \"The Girl's All Right\", was later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists.\n=== Later career (1994-) ===\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|date=February 18, 1998|newspaper=The New York Times|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on a concert tour that was his first bigger one since the 1991 tour for ''Creatures of Habit.''\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout! Factory released ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]: 30th Anniversary Edition'' on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years.

During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, NY in support of his friend, rock photographer [[Rob Shanahan]] and his new book, \"Volume One.\" In June, Squier performed at the \"Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner\" in New York, in another fundraising effort for '[[Little Kids Rock]].' In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for \"The American Revolution,\" a documentary on legendary rock FM station WBCN at the House Of Blues in Boston.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Squier performed his 'Electric Man' show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player. They divided their time between a home in [[Bridgehampton]], [[Long Island]] and an apartment in [[The San Remo]] on [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Squier had been, as of 2016, an active volunteer for the [[Central Park Conservancy]] for more than 17 years, physically maintaining 20 acres (81,000 m2) of the park, as well as promoting the Conservancy in articles and interviews. He also supported the Group for the East End and its native planting programs on eastern Long Island.<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Post|date=May 14, 2000|url=https://nypost.com/2000/05/14/rocker-billys-a-country-squier/|title=Rocker Billy's A Country \u2018Squier\u2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=New York Social Diary|date=September 2, 2015|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/guest-diary/2015/end-of-summer-doings-at-madoo|title=End of Summer Doings at Madoo}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Billy Squier discography}}\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n*''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' (1981)\n*''[[Emotions in Motion]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' (1986)\n*''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'' (1991)\n*''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]]'' (1993)\n*''[[Happy Blue (Billy Squier album)|Happy Blue]]'' (1998)\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n* ''[[A Rock and Roll Christmas]]'' (Various Artists Compilation) (1994)\n* ''16 Strokes: The Best of Billy Squier'' (1995)\n* ''Reach for the Sky: The Anthology'' (1996) (PolyGram)\n* ''Classic Masters'' (2002)\n* ''Absolute Hits'' (2005)\n* ''Essential Billy Squier'' (2011)\n* ''ICON'' (2013)\n\n=== Live albums ===\n* ''King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Billy Squier'' (1996)\n* ''Live In The Dark'' (DVD)\n\n===Non-album soundtrack contributions===\n*''Fast Times (The Best Years Of Our Lives)'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Fast Times At Ridgemont High]]'' (1982)\n*''On Your Own'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1984)\n*''Shake Down'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' (1985)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<!--unused<ref name=\"parker\">{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Lyndsey|title=Martha, Martha, Martha! 35 Years Later, Original VJ Quinn Remembers MTV's Early Days|url=https://www.yahoo.com/music/martha-martha-martha-35-years-later-original-vj-quinn-remembers-mtvs-early-days-042906236.html|website=Yahoo!

Tisza supported the [[dual monarchy]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and was representative of the then ''liberal-conservative consent''.\n[[File:Istvan Tisza.

He himself supported the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]]. A social reactionary to the end, Tisza stubbornly opposed on principle the break-up of the large landed estates as well as even the most modest reform proposals that would have granted the [[universal suffrage|suffrage]] to soldiers fighting at the front<ref>Robert A. Kann, ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526\u20131918'', University of California Press, 1974, p. 494-495.</ref> (before 1918 only 10% of the Hungarian population could vote and hold office). However, in economic affairs, he tended to be a modernizer who encouraged and supported industrialization and, in that respect, he was an opponent of [[anti-Semitism]], which he feared could jeopardize Hungary's economic development.  Among the Hungarian political leaders, Tisza was the most zealous adherent of Dualism and the partnership with Austria.<ref>Stephen Tisza article of the 1922 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</ref> The [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise]], the Liberal party and Istv\u00e1n Tisza remained bitterly unpopular<ref>Cieger Andr\u00e1s.

As an economist, he followed the concepts of the [[English historical school of economics]], as a lawyer and political scientist, Tisza favored the societal and political development of England,  which he considered as the \"ideal way of development\".<ref>Zolt\u00e1n Maruzsa, Political scientist, [[ELTE]] University:{{cite web |url= http://tiszaistvan.hu/index.php/english |title= The standpoint of the Tisza Istv\u00e1n Friends Society concerning the historical figure of Count Istv\u00e1n Tisza |publisher= tiszaistvan.hu |date=March 2016 |accessdate= 2018-08-29 }}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nIstv\u00e1n Tisza was the son of [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tisza]] de Borosjen\u0151, prime minister of Hungary between 1875\u20131890 from the [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party]]. The Tiszas were originally a [[Calvinist]] untitled lower nobility (regarded as equivalent to the British [[gentry]]). His mother, Ilona Degenfeld-Schomburg, was a Hungarian-German aristocrat from [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] (born: Helene Johanna Josepha Mathilde Gr\u00e4fin von Degenfeld-Schonburg).<ref>[http://www.degenfeldkastely.com/degenfeld-ilona Degenfeld Kastely biographical data]</ref>\n\nThe young Stephen raised in a puritanical and authoritarian Calvinist environment with high expectations. Stephen has studied at home until the age of twelve, then he entered the Calvinist Gymnasium (a college-preparatory school) of [[Debrecen]]. Tisza took legal studies in Budapest, international law in [[Heidelberg University Faculty of Law|Heidelberg University]], economics in [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], where he received PHD, and political science in [[Oxford University]], where he received a doctorate in [[political science]].\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Tisza as member of the parliament===\nHe then took care of the family land at [[Bihar County]] and [[Geszt]] for five years.  He won his first parliamentary electoral mandate in 1886 with the Liberal Party in [[V\u00edzakna]] (Now: [[Ocna Sibiului]], Romania), a Transylvanian electoral district, and he represented the district until 1892. He won his second seat in 1892 as representative of [[\u00dajb\u00e1nya]] district (Now: [[Nov\u00e1 Ba\u0148a]], Slovakia). In 1896 he won the seat of [[Ungra|Ugra]] district (Now: [[Ungra]], Romania) and he became also a member of the economic committee of Hungarian parliament, where he plunged himself into the macroeconomic discussions.\n\nIn the 1890s he served a number of [[sinecure]]s which provided extraordinary income, a common situation among prestigious European politicians of the time. He was the president of the [[Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank]] (Magyar Ipar- \u00e9s Kereskedelmi Bank) and was a member of the boards of numerous joint-stock companies and industrial enterprises. Despite the financial crisis of the 1890s, under his control many of these enterprises became the fastest emerging companies of the realm, some of them became unavoidable enterprises in their own sectors. His instructions and rule transformed the mediocre Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank into the largest Bank of Hungary within a decade.\n\nHis uncle, the childless [[Lajos Tisza]] received the title of Count from Emperor Franz Joseph in 1897. However, Lajos Tisza conferred his new title on his nephew Stephen with the consent of the Monarch on 16 February 1897.<ref name=\"kir\u00e1lyik\u00f6nyvekgr\u00f3fi\">{{Cite web|url=https://archives.hungaricana.hu/en/libriregii/hu_mnl_ol_a057_70_0020/?list=eyJxdWVyeSI6ICJ0aXN6YSJ9|title=Ferenc J\u00f3zsef; B\u00e9cs; 1897.02.16; gr\u00f3fi c\u00edm \u00e1truh\u00e1z\u00e1sa; el\u0151n\u00e9v \u00e1truh\u00e1z\u00e1sa}}</ref>\n\n===Prime minister for first time, 1903\u20131905===\n\nHe was chairman and board member of several financial institutions (eg the Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank) and many industrial companies, but resigned from all of his memberships before he was appointed as Prime minister.\n\n====Target of Leftist and socialist circles====\nIn this period he managed to get the remains of [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] repatriated from Turkey and interred in the cathedral of Kassa, today [[Ko\u0161ice]]. On April 19, 1904, nationwide strike of railroad workers broke out, which paralyzed the Hungarian economy. Tisza solved the crisis quickly but drastically:  the organizers of the strike were arrested, and participant railway workers were recruited into the Hungarian Honv\u00e9d army. The Parliament approved the increase of conscriptees. The police crushed a Socialist gathering for peasants in Bihar, leaving 33 dead and several hundred wounded.\n\n====Target of anti-Semite circles====\nTisza often used his influence in parliament to grant titles to wealthy Jewish families, especially successful industrialists and bankers, and set them and their success as an example for the people. Many families of young middle class were Jews or baptized Jews. Tisza often gathered influential men of Jewish extraction to advise him. He even offered many positions in his cabinet to Jews. His first appointment was [[Samu Hazai]] as Minister of War. Two years later he picked [[J\u00e1nos Teleszky]] as minister of finance. The third Jewish member of his cabinet was J\u00e1nos Hark\u00e1nyi, minister of trade. Tisza appointed Samu Hazai as Minister of War during his second premiere. They all served for the duration of Tisza's seven years in office.  The Liberal Party passed legislation for [[Jewish emancipation]] in 1867, and appointed many Jewish origin MEPs to the  parliament (both the upper and lower houses). In return, many Jews supported the party. Many districts of Budapest, where Jews made up half of the voters, reliably voted for the Liberal candidate.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lorman |first1=Thomas |title=The Making of the Slovak People\u2019s Party: Religion, Nationalism and the Culture War in Early 20th-Century Europe |date=2019 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-350-10938-4 |language=en|p=48}}</ref> Similarly to the policy of his father, Istv\u00e1n Tisza allowed the unrestricted immigration of Jewish refugees from the Russian Empire, who fled from the Tzarist pogroms.  His philosemitic political attitude made him a target of anti-Semite politicians and political circles.\n\n====Target of radical nationalists====\nDuring the era, only 54.5% (1910 census<ref>1910. \u00e9vi n\u00e9psz\u00e1ml\u00e1l\u00e1s adatai. (Magyar Statisztikai K\u00f6zlem\u00e9nyek, Budapest, 1912. pp 30\u201333)</ref>) of the population of kingdom of Hungary considered themselves as Hungarians. Tisza's party (The [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party of Hungary]]) urgently needed the support of minorities to maintain the majority of the party in the Hungarian parliament. The liberal party was the most popular political force in the electoral districts where the ethnic minorities represented the local majority. However his main political opponents (The nationalist [[National Independence Kossuth Party|Party of Independence and '48]] and Catholic People's Party) could collect mandates only from the Hungarian majority electoral districts.<ref>See: Zolt\u00e1n Maruzsa</ref>\n\n===\"Election by handkerchief\" and the victory of nationalist opposition===\nHe passed a modification to the rules of the House of Parliament on 18 November 1904 to crush the [[obstructing government administration|obstruction]] of the opposition. In earlier era, the members of the parliament had unrestricted time to give speech or talk in the parliament.\n\nFrom the first his ministry was exposed to the most unscrupulous opposition, exacerbated by the new and stringent rules of procedure which Tisza felt it his duty to introduce if any business were to be done. The motion for their introduction was made by the deputy G\u00e1bor Daniel, supported by the premier, and after scenes of unheard-of obstruction and violence (16\u201318 November) the speaker, in the midst of an ear-splitting tumult, declared that the new regulations had been adopted by the house, and produced a royal message suspending the session. But the Andr\u00e1ssy group, immediately afterwards, separated from the Liberal Party, and the rest of the year the Opposition made the legislation impossible. By January 1905 the situation had become ex lex or anarchical. Tisza stoutly stood by his rules, on the ground that this was a case in which the form must be sacrificed to the substance of parliamentary government.<ref>\"Stephen Tisza\" in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 11th ed. 1911., VOLUME: XXVI, page:1017</ref>\n\n[[Dezs\u0151 Perczel]], the President of the House, called for immediate voting on the modification. It is not clear what exactly happened, but some sources say that the Speaker of the House of Parliament waved a handkerchief, signalling for the governing party to vote \"yes\"; this act later became known as the \"election by handkerchief\", which became a large scandal and, as a consequence, [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Sz\u00e9ll]] and [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]] left the Liberal Party and the opposition unified into the \"Federal Opposition\".\nThe political powers polarised and in new elections the 30 years of governing by the Liberal Party was ended, with the side effect that the party was dissolved.\n\nAfter the defeat of his Liberal Party by the nationalist coalition in the 1905 elections, Tisza only took part in the operations of the Upper House of Parliament (similar to House of Lords in Britain), staying away from political struggles. However, his political opponent the governing [[National Independence Kossuth Party|Independence and '48 Party]] was unable to withhold positions to protect the interests of Hungary so it resigned on 25 April 1909.\n\n===National Party of Work, electoral victory in 1910===\n[[File:Tisza Istvan and his wife.jpg|thumb|Tisza and his wife in 1904.]]\n\nOn 19 February 1910, Tisza established the [[National Party of Work]] (Nemzeti Munkap\u00e1rt) which subsequently won the election of 1910. He did not desire to form a government, primarily due to his conflict with [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] who sought to centralise the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] with [[universal suffrage]]. Tisza opposed this initiative, as he believed that this would lead to the weakening of the Magyar supremacy over ethnic minorities in Hungary.  In addition, he claimed \"[[demagogue]]s (i.e. Communists and agrarian socialist movements) would manipulate peasants with the majority of the votes to put in power such groups whose aims are against democracy, supported by the urban intellectuals\".<ref>A magyar jobboldali hagyom\u00e1ny (Hungarian Right-Wing Heritage), 1900\u20131948. Edited by Ign\u00e1c Romcsics, Osiris, 2009. pp. 65.</ref> Tisza was supported by [[Franz Josef]], but he feared a repeat of the faults of his first prime ministry and thus called for [[K\u00e1roly Khuen-H\u00e9derv\u00e1ry]] to form the new government.\n[[File:Ferenc Jozsef es Tisza Istvan.jpg|thumb|right|Istv\u00e1n Tisza (right) with Emperor-King Francis Joseph]]\n[[File:Tisza I. electoral speech 1910.jpg|thumb|Tisza gives an electoral speech in [[Sopron]] in April 1910]]\n\n====Act of Protection====\n[[File:Tisza1914.PNG|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza in 1914]]\n\nAs Speaker of the House of Representatives from 22 May 1912 to 12 June 1913 Tisza supported the reform of the common Austro-Hungarian army to enhance the military power of the dual monarchy. The Hungarian side was fighting for more Hungarian interests (i.e. use of the Magyar language in the army). Tisza and his party refused the idea of universal suffrage. According to his threatening prediction, the majority votes of peasants  - manipulated by primitive demagogues - would result in the domination of groups whose goals are just contrary to the ideals of metropolitan intellectuals and socialists who call for democracy. The Socialists strongly opposed his acts and decided to organize a protest march. Socialist agents organised a worker rebellion on 22 May 1912 (Blood-Red Thursday), calling for Tisza to resign as President of the House and calling for universal suffrage. On the next day, the protesters and workers marched toward the Parliament building, meanwhile the events transformed to violence, protesters broke the shop windows in the surrounding streets, automobiles and tramcard were damaged by the masses.  However the protesters were stopped by the storm of hussar cavalry units, and they were arrested by the police. Six people died in the clashes, nearly two hundred were injured and three hundred were arrested. This event became known as \"Blood-Red Thursday\" in the contemporary press and later in the history books.\n\nTisza tried to solve the question of ethnic minorities based on a [[cleric]]al approach (like the representation of Orthodox and Greek Catholic Church in The Upper House of the parliament).\n\nHe was convinced that the challenging foreign situation called for military preparation and he strongly pushed against opposition obstruction. He did not allow the opposition to speak up regarding rules of House of Parliament. Referring to an act of 1848, he called for the [[police force]] to force out numerous opposition representatives. He managed to pass the Act of Protection, resulting in the removal  of some members of the opposition party.\n\nAs a result, [[Gyula Kov\u00e1cs]], an opposition party representative, tried to assassinate Tisza in the Parliament Building on 7 June 1912. His shots missed and the marks are still visible in the Hungarian Parliament Building to this day. With his last shot Kov\u00e1cs shot himself, but he survived. Tisza then continued the session.\n\n===Prime minister for second time, 1913\u20131917 ===\n\nTisza became prime minister again on 7 June 1913.\n\n====Freedom of the press====\nInspired by the Western European model, Tisza's cabinet introduced for the first time in the history of Hungarian journalism the legal category of [[defamation]], libel and \"scare-mongering\", thus the press became actionable before the courts. Journalists and newspapers had to pay compensations for the victims of defamation and libel. Despite these institutions and laws worked well in Western Europe and in the United States, the contemporary Hungarian newspapers and journalists considered it as the violation of the Freedom of Speech and the Freedom of Press.\n\n====Croatia====\nCount Istv\u00e1n Tisza tried to solve the Hungarian-Croatian issue, which had long lasted at that time, to clarify the relationship; for this matter, he met Count Tivadar Pej\u00e1csevich, Count of Verovce, Croatian Ban, and a year later, Baron Lomnica, Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz, the new Croatian Ban.\n\n==Foreign policy and the Great War==\n\n[[File:Istv\u00e1n Tisza and Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf.jpg|thumb|Tisza and H\u00f6tzendorf left Vienna after 3 days long fierce debate.]]\n\nA few days before the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]], which resulted in World War I, Tisza supported a strong stand against [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. However, after the assassination he was against going to war against Serbia, a rare view in Austria-Hungary. He knew the army's strength, and he was afraid that with the increase of more [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] territories the equilibrium inside the monarchy would be upset. Moreover, he was afraid that [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] would attack [[Transylvania]].<ref>K\u00f6peczy-Makkai-M\u00f3csy-Sz\u00e1sz: History of Transylvania</ref> The loss of the alliance with the [[German Empire]] would have meant the end of Austria-Hungary as a [[Great Power]], so he gave in and supported the war. He then became a relentless supporter of the war until its end.\n\nTisza believed Romania to be an enemy from the beginning. He was afraid that if Romania attacked Hungary then the Romanians in Transylvania would revolt against Hungary. In the end, 40,000 soldiers were moved to protect Transylvania.\n\nDuring the war, the reformists became more and more powerful, but he continued to oppose them. At the time, Tisza was seen as forcing the continuation of the war and was losing a great deal of support. He opposed the ideas of the new Emperor, [[Charles I of Austria|Karl I]], and was asked to resign; he did so on 23 May 1917.<ref>https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/crisis-in-austria-hungary</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=0RuDCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=istvan+tisza+austria+forced+to+resign#v=onepage&q=istvan%20tisza%20austria%20forced%20to%20resign&f=false | title=The Age of Catastrophe: A History of the West 1914\u20131945| isbn=9780300213096| last1=Winkler| first1=Heinrich August| date=28 September 2015}}</ref> However, he retained great political influence, and was able to delay the enactment of universal [[suffrage]].\n\nDuring this period of international insecurity, he wanted to solidify the government.

As a ''homo regius'' (\"king's man\"), he went to Sarajevo to attempt this, but without success.\n\n===His judgement from abroad during and after the war===\nIt is clear that after the outbreak of World War I, all opposing sides pointed to the other side as the party guilty of initiating the greater war.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The British newspaper \"New Europe\" printed a comment that Hungary was the only responsible party for the war, ''\"where Hungary\u2032s responsibility is greater than Austria\u2032s\"'' and that Tisza was the militaristic politician who dragged all sides into war. As a consequence the \"[[Little Entente]]\" took this view and pushed to punish Hungary at the end of the war. Later, the propaganda of these nations augmented and even invented Tisza's guilt, claiming that he took pains to point out in a report of 8 July that \"there should at any rate be no question of the annihilation or annexation of Serbia, and that if Serbia gave way, Austria-Hungary must be content.\" According to recent findings these accusations are without merit.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe accusations are rooted in the common belief that Tisza carried out a policy of forced [[Magyarization]] towards the ethnic minorities in Hungary. His minority policy was (directly or indirectly) often confused with the policy of his radical nationalist political opponents in the 1906 -1910 period (like the [[Party of Independence and '48]]).\n\n===His view on the war===\n[[File:Graf Stefan Tisza (BildID 15720072).jpg|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza served on the Italian front between 1917-1918, where he had opportunity to experience the circumstances and dangers of trench warfare on a daily basis]]\n\nTisza opposed the expansion of the empire on the Balkan (see [[Bosnian crisis]] in 1908), because \"the Dual Monarchy already had too many Slavs\", which would further threaten the integrity of the Dual Monarchy.<ref>William Jannen: Lions of July: Prelude to War, 1914 - PAGE:456</ref>\n\nIn March 1914, Tisza wrote a memorandum to Emperor Francis Joseph. His letter had strongly apocalyptic predictive and embittered tone. He used exactly the hitherto unknown \"Weltkrieg\" (means World War) phrase in his letter.\n\"It is my firm conviction that Germany's two neighbors [Russia and France] are carefully proceeding with military preparations, but will not start the war so long as they have not attained a grouping of the Balkan states against us that confronts the monarchy with an attack from three sides and pins down the majority of our forces on our eastern and southern front.\"<ref>David G. Herrmann: The Arming of Europe and the Making of the First World War - PAGE: 211, Princeton University Press, (1997) {{ISBN|9780691015958}}</ref>\n\nOn the day of the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], Tisza immediately traveled to [[Vienna]] where he met Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Berchtold and Army Commander Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf. They proposed to solve the dispute with arms, attacking [[Serbia]]. Tisza proposed to give the government of Serbia time to take a stand as to whether it was involved in the organisation of the murder and proposed a peaceful resolution, arguing that the international situation would settle soon. Returning to Budapest, he wrote to [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] saying he would not take any responsibility for the armed conflict because there was no proof that Serbia had plotted the assassination. Tisza opposed a war with Serbia, stating (correctly, as it turned out) that any war with the Serbs was bound to trigger a war with Russia and hence a general European war.<ref>Fischer, Fritz: Germany\u2019s Aims in the First World War, New York, W.W. Norton, 1967, {{ISBN|978-0-393-09798-6}}  (PAGE: 52)</ref> He thought that even a successful Austro-Hungarian war would be disastrous for the integrity of Kingdom of Hungary, where Hungary would be the next victim of Austrian politics. After a successful war against Serbia, Tisza adumbrated a possible Austrian military attack against Kingdom of Hungary, where the Austrians want to break up the territory of Hungary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/tisza.htm |first=Michael |last=Duffy |title=Who's Who - Count Istvan Tisza de Boros-Jeno |publisher=firstworldwar.com}}</ref> He did not trust in the Italian alliance, due to the political aftermath of the [[Second Italian War of Independence]]. He felt the threat of [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] after the [[Balkan wars]] and was afraid of [[Romania]]n attack from the east. He was also not sure about the stand of the [[Germans]]. Germany's stand was of ultimate importance due to the security of the state. \n \nDuring a conversation between Franz Joseph and Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf, Conrad asked, \"If Germany's reply is that they are on our side, do we engage in war with Serbia?\" The emperor replied, \"Then yes\", \"But what if they reply differently?\", \"Then the Monarchy will be alone\".\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II supported the war, promised to neutralize a Romanian attack, and put pressure on [[Sofia]]. After this, Tisza still sought a peaceful solution, but most of all he wanted to wait for the result of the official examination into the assassination. The only proposal of Tisza, which was accepted, was that the Monarchy should not annihilate Serbia completely in order to avoid Russian support for Serbia. The council finally addressed an [[ultimatum]] to the Serbian government and immediately started the [[mobilisation]] of troops.\n\nAfter sending the ultimatum, his view changed. The ultimatum was obsolete within 48 hours, so Tisza wrote: \"it was a difficult decision to take a stand to propose war, but now I am firmly convinced of its necessity\"<ref>Tschirschky's report to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 14 July 1914</ref> He was, however, still opposed to the annexation of Serbia to the Monarchy, but failed. On 4 August 1914 Russia, Germany, Britain and France also entered the war, enlarging it to a world war.\n\nTisza did not resign from the Prime Ministry, as he thought remaining in this position was the best way he could represent Hungarian interests inside Austria-Hungary, as he had connections in Vienna. Moreover, his resignation would have sent a message of weakness to the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] at the outbreak of war.\n\nHis initial opposition to the conflict, only became public after the end of World War 1, on 17 October 1918, when he spoke in the Parliament. He said, \"the Monarchy and the Hungarian nation were longing for peace all the way until there were proofs that the enemy was systematically trying to humiliate and destroy us as soon as possible (...) As we have found proofs that the Serbian government took part in organising the assassination, we could not but address an ultimatum to Serbia&nbsp;... where we stipulated that the war is preventive.\"\n\n=== The struggle of a WW1 political leader in the trenches ===\n\nThe 57 years old Tisza joined to the 2nd Hussar Regiment of Hungary - which served on the Italian front - as a hussar colonel, and personally led his hussar units during the attacks.\n\nTisza at the front: \"Tisza already felt the not too friendly atmosphere surrounding him at the first days of his joining up to the regiment and at first he tried to ease the general mood by informal behavior. (...) He has made an effort from the beginning to use an informal tone both with the staff of officers and -of course within the limits of the service regulations- with the rank and file. To better get to know each other with his fellow officers, every day he invited some young officers to his table, this way he tried to establish better personal relations with his environment. The troops had slowly started to recognize him as \"tough to the upwards and humane to the downwards\" kind of a commander. He distributed his tobacco provisions among the officers and he used his commander pay to improve the catering of the troops, and these of course left a good impression on everybody.\nTisza's paternalistic attitude towards his subordinates also manifested itself in civil law cases: he helped with his personal influence in getting done of those petitions what he considered fair, he interceded with notaries, judges, alisp\u00e1ns (deputy-lieutenants) for advancing the home affairs of his men, due to this both the officers and the troops more and more came to like and embrace him. Tisza himself also felt that the front service had been quite useful and productive since on the one hand he could personally experience the dangers of the battleground an on the other hand-at least he was thinking that way and there is a lot of truth in it-he could truly become familiar with the real nature of the simple, peasant origin soldiers. He wrote about peasant soldiers in this way in a letter to Archduke Joseph: \"I\u2019ve got to truly know the ordinary [peasants] people now. This is the most extraordinary race of the world that can only be loved and respected. How unfortunate that the political intelligentia doesn\u2019t do anything else, just corrupts this great and God-blessed people.\" <ref>Peter Strausz: (Hungarian) \"Istv\u00e1n Tisza and the Second Hussar Regiment\" [http://mek.oszk.hu/03200/03296/03296.doc]</ref>\n\n==Assassination attempts==\n[[File:Monument to Tisza Istvan outside the Budapest Parliament building.jpg|thumb|Monument to Tisza Istvan outside the Budapest Parliament building]]\n\nFor many, he was the representative of the war policy in the Monarchy, so he was an assassination target. The fourth assassination attempt against him was successful.\n\nThe first attempt was made in the Hungarian parliament in 1912 by Gyula Kov\u00e1cs, an opposition politician. He shot two bullets, but missed Tisza. Kov\u00e1cs was arrested by the police, but he was acquitted by the court, the justification was \"temporary insanity\".\n\nThe second was made by a soldier when Tisza was returning from the front line during the war. The bullet missed him.\n\nThe third attempt came on 16 October 1918 when [[J\u00e1nos L\u00e9kai]], a member of the society [[Galilei-circle]] and an anti-military group led by [[Ott\u00f3 Korvin]], tried to kill Tisza while he was leaving the [[Hungarian Parliament]], but the revolver malfunctioned and Tisza managed to flee.<ref>Andr\u00e1s Sikl\u00f3s.

The prominent event in his life was [[Austria-Hungary]]'s entry into the First World War when he was prime minister for the second time. He was later assassinated during the [[Aster Revolution]] on 31 October 1918 - the same day that Hungary terminated its [[Austria-Hungary|real union]] with Austria.

He himself supported the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]]. A social reactionary to the end, Tisza stubbornly opposed on principle the break-up of the large landed estates as well as even the most modest reform proposals that would have granted the [[universal suffrage|suffrage]] to soldiers fighting at the front<ref>Robert A. Kann, ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526\u20131918'', University of California Press, 1974, p. 494-495.</ref> (before 1918 only 10% of the Hungarian population could vote and hold office). However, in economic affairs, he tended to be a modernizer who encouraged and supported industrialization and, in that respect, he was an opponent of [[anti-Semitism]], which he feared could jeopardize Hungary's economic development.  Among the Hungarian political leaders, Tisza was the most zealous adherent of Dualism and the partnership with Austria.<ref>Stephen Tisza article of the 1922 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</ref> The [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise]], the Liberal party and Istv\u00e1n Tisza remained bitterly unpopular<ref>Cieger Andr\u00e1s.

As an economist, he followed the concepts of the [[English historical school of economics]], as a lawyer and political scientist, Tisza favored the societal and political development of England,  which he considered as the \"ideal way of development\".<ref>Zolt\u00e1n Maruzsa, Political scientist, [[ELTE]] University:{{cite web |url= http://tiszaistvan.hu/index.php/english |title= The standpoint of the Tisza Istv\u00e1n Friends Society concerning the historical figure of Count Istv\u00e1n Tisza |publisher= tiszaistvan.hu |date=March 2016 |accessdate= 2018-08-29 }}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nIstv\u00e1n Tisza was the son of [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tisza]] de Borosjen\u0151, prime minister of Hungary between 1875\u20131890 from the [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party]]. The Tiszas were originally a [[Calvinist]] untitled lower nobility (regarded as equivalent to the British [[gentry]]). His mother, Ilona Degenfeld-Schomburg, was a Hungarian-German aristocrat from [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] (born: Helene Johanna Josepha Mathilde Gr\u00e4fin von Degenfeld-Schonburg).<ref>[http://www.degenfeldkastely.com/degenfeld-ilona Degenfeld Kastely biographical data]</ref>\n\nThe young Stephen raised in a puritanical and authoritarian Calvinist environment with high expectations. Stephen has studied at home until the age of twelve, then he entered the Calvinist Gymnasium (a college-preparatory school) of [[Debrecen]]. Tisza took legal studies in Budapest, international law in [[Heidelberg University Faculty of Law|Heidelberg University]], economics in [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], where he received PHD, and political science in [[Oxford University]], where he received a doctorate in [[political science]].\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Tisza as member of the parliament===\nHe then took care of the family land at [[Bihar County]] and [[Geszt]] for five years.  He won his first parliamentary electoral mandate in 1886 with the Liberal Party in [[V\u00edzakna]] (Now: [[Ocna Sibiului]], Romania), a Transylvanian electoral district, and he represented the district until 1892. He won his second seat in 1892 as representative of [[\u00dajb\u00e1nya]] district (Now: [[Nov\u00e1 Ba\u0148a]], Slovakia). In 1896 he won the seat of [[Ungra|Ugra]] district (Now: [[Ungra]], Romania) and he became also a member of the economic committee of Hungarian parliament, where he plunged himself into the macroeconomic discussions.\n\nIn the 1890s he served a number of [[sinecure]]s which provided extraordinary income, a common situation among prestigious European politicians of the time. He was the president of the [[Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank]] (Magyar Ipar- \u00e9s Kereskedelmi Bank) and was a member of the boards of numerous joint-stock companies and industrial enterprises. Despite the financial crisis of the 1890s, under his control many of these enterprises became the fastest emerging companies of the realm, some of them became unavoidable enterprises in their own sectors. His instructions and rule transformed the mediocre Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank into the largest Bank of Hungary within a decade.\n\nHis uncle, the childless [[Lajos Tisza]] received the title of Count from Emperor Franz Joseph in 1897. However, Lajos Tisza conferred his new title on his nephew Stephen with the consent of the Monarch on 16 February 1897.<ref name=\"kir\u00e1lyik\u00f6nyvekgr\u00f3fi\">{{Cite web|url=https://archives.hungaricana.hu/en/libriregii/hu_mnl_ol_a057_70_0020/?list=eyJxdWVyeSI6ICJ0aXN6YSJ9|title=Ferenc J\u00f3zsef; B\u00e9cs; 1897.02.16; gr\u00f3fi c\u00edm \u00e1truh\u00e1z\u00e1sa; el\u0151n\u00e9v \u00e1truh\u00e1z\u00e1sa}}</ref>\n\n===Prime minister for first time, 1903\u20131905===\n\nHe was chairman and board member of several financial institutions (eg the Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank) and many industrial companies, but resigned from all of his memberships before he was appointed as Prime minister.\n\n====Target of Leftist and socialist circles====\nIn this period he managed to get the remains of [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] repatriated from Turkey and interred in the cathedral of Kassa, today [[Ko\u0161ice]]. On April 19, 1904, nationwide strike of railroad workers broke out, which paralyzed the Hungarian economy. Tisza solved the crisis quickly but drastically:  the organizers of the strike were arrested, and participant railway workers were recruited into the Hungarian Honv\u00e9d army. The Parliament approved the increase of conscriptees. The police crushed a Socialist gathering for peasants in Bihar, leaving 33 dead and several hundred wounded.\n\n====Target of anti-Semite circles====\nTisza often used his influence in parliament to grant titles to wealthy Jewish families, especially successful industrialists and bankers, and set them and their success as an example for the people. Many families of young middle class were Jews or baptized Jews. Tisza often gathered influential men of Jewish extraction to advise him. He even offered many positions in his cabinet to Jews. His first appointment was [[Samu Hazai]] as Minister of War. Two years later he picked [[J\u00e1nos Teleszky]] as minister of finance. The third Jewish member of his cabinet was J\u00e1nos Hark\u00e1nyi, minister of trade. Tisza appointed Samu Hazai as Minister of War during his second premiere. They all served for the duration of Tisza's seven years in office.  The Liberal Party passed legislation for [[Jewish emancipation]] in 1867, and appointed many Jewish origin MEPs to the  parliament (both the upper and lower houses). In return, many Jews supported the party. Many districts of Budapest, where Jews made up half of the voters, reliably voted for the Liberal candidate.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lorman |first1=Thomas |title=The Making of the Slovak People\u2019s Party: Religion, Nationalism and the Culture War in Early 20th-Century Europe |date=2019 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-350-10938-4 |language=en|p=48}}</ref> Similarly to the policy of his father, Istv\u00e1n Tisza allowed the unrestricted immigration of Jewish refugees from the Russian Empire, who fled from the Tzarist pogroms.  His philosemitic political attitude made him a target of anti-Semite politicians and political circles.\n\n====Target of radical nationalists====\nDuring the era, only 54.5% (1910 census<ref>1910. \u00e9vi n\u00e9psz\u00e1ml\u00e1l\u00e1s adatai. (Magyar Statisztikai K\u00f6zlem\u00e9nyek, Budapest, 1912. pp 30\u201333)</ref>) of the population of kingdom of Hungary considered themselves as Hungarians. Tisza's party (The [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party of Hungary]]) urgently needed the support of minorities to maintain the majority of the party in the Hungarian parliament. The liberal party was the most popular political force in the electoral districts where the ethnic minorities represented the local majority. However his main political opponents (The nationalist [[National Independence Kossuth Party|Party of Independence and '48]] and Catholic People's Party) could collect mandates only from the Hungarian majority electoral districts.<ref>See: Zolt\u00e1n Maruzsa</ref>\n\n===\"Election by handkerchief\" and the victory of nationalist opposition===\nHe passed a modification to the rules of the House of Parliament on 18 November 1904 to crush the [[obstructing government administration|obstruction]] of the opposition. In earlier era, the members of the parliament had unrestricted time to give speech or talk in the parliament.\n\nFrom the first his ministry was exposed to the most unscrupulous opposition, exacerbated by the new and stringent rules of procedure which Tisza felt it his duty to introduce if any business were to be done. The motion for their introduction was made by the deputy G\u00e1bor Daniel, supported by the premier, and after scenes of unheard-of obstruction and violence (16\u201318 November) the speaker, in the midst of an ear-splitting tumult, declared that the new regulations had been adopted by the house, and produced a royal message suspending the session. But the Andr\u00e1ssy group, immediately afterwards, separated from the Liberal Party, and the rest of the year the Opposition made the legislation impossible. By January 1905 the situation had become ex lex or anarchical. Tisza stoutly stood by his rules, on the ground that this was a case in which the form must be sacrificed to the substance of parliamentary government.<ref>\"Stephen Tisza\" in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 11th ed. 1911., VOLUME: XXVI, page:1017</ref>\n\n[[Dezs\u0151 Perczel]], the President of the House, called for immediate voting on the modification. It is not clear what exactly happened, but some sources say that the Speaker of the House of Parliament waved a handkerchief, signalling for the governing party to vote \"yes\"; this act later became known as the \"election by handkerchief\", which became a large scandal and, as a consequence, [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Sz\u00e9ll]] and [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]] left the Liberal Party and the opposition unified into the \"Federal Opposition\".\nThe political powers polarised and in new elections the 30 years of governing by the Liberal Party was ended, with the side effect that the party was dissolved.\n\nAfter the defeat of his Liberal Party by the nationalist coalition in the 1905 elections, Tisza only took part in the operations of the Upper House of Parliament (similar to House of Lords in Britain), staying away from political struggles. However, his political opponent the governing [[National Independence Kossuth Party|Independence and '48 Party]] was unable to withhold positions to protect the interests of Hungary so it resigned on 25 April 1909.\n\n===National Party of Work, electoral victory in 1910===\n[[File:Tisza Istvan and his wife.jpg|thumb|Tisza and his wife in 1904.]]\n\nOn 19 February 1910, Tisza established the [[National Party of Work]] (Nemzeti Munkap\u00e1rt) which subsequently won the election of 1910. He did not desire to form a government, primarily due to his conflict with [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] who sought to centralise the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] with [[universal suffrage]]. Tisza opposed this initiative, as he believed that this would lead to the weakening of the Magyar supremacy over ethnic minorities in Hungary.  In addition, he claimed \"[[demagogue]]s (i.e. Communists and agrarian socialist movements) would manipulate peasants with the majority of the votes to put in power such groups whose aims are against democracy, supported by the urban intellectuals\".<ref>A magyar jobboldali hagyom\u00e1ny (Hungarian Right-Wing Heritage), 1900\u20131948. Edited by Ign\u00e1c Romcsics, Osiris, 2009. pp. 65.</ref> Tisza was supported by [[Franz Josef]], but he feared a repeat of the faults of his first prime ministry and thus called for [[K\u00e1roly Khuen-H\u00e9derv\u00e1ry]] to form the new government.\n[[File:Ferenc Jozsef es Tisza Istvan.jpg|thumb|right|Istv\u00e1n Tisza (right) with Emperor-King Francis Joseph]]\n[[File:Tisza I. electoral speech 1910.jpg|thumb|Tisza gives an electoral speech in [[Sopron]] in April 1910]]\n\n====Act of Protection====\n[[File:Tisza1914.PNG|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza in 1914]]\n\nAs Speaker of the House of Representatives from 22 May 1912 to 12 June 1913 Tisza supported the reform of the common Austro-Hungarian army to enhance the military power of the dual monarchy. The Hungarian side was fighting for more Hungarian interests (i.e. use of the Magyar language in the army). Tisza and his party refused the idea of universal suffrage. According to his threatening prediction, the majority votes of peasants  - manipulated by primitive demagogues - would result in the domination of groups whose goals are just contrary to the ideals of metropolitan intellectuals and socialists who call for democracy. The Socialists strongly opposed his acts and and decided to organize a protest march. Socialist agents organised a worker rebellion on 22 May 1912 (Blood-Red Thursday), calling for Tisza to resign as President of the House and calling for universal suffrage. On the next day, the protesters and workers marched toward the Parliament building, meanwhile the events transformed to violence, protesters broke the shop windows in the surrounding streets, automobiles and tramcard were damaged by the masses.  However the protesters were stopped by the storm of hussar cavalry units, and they were arrested by the police. Six people died in the clashes, nearly two hundred were injured and three hundred were arrested. This event became known as \"Blood-Red Thursday\" in the contemporary press and later in the history books.\n\nTisza tried to solve the question of ethnic minorities based on a [[cleric]]al approach (like the representation of Orthodox and Greek Catholic Church in The Upper House of the parliament).\n\nHe was convinced that the challenging foreign situation called for military preparation and he strongly pushed against opposition obstruction. He did not allow the opposition to speak up regarding rules of House of Parliament. Referring to an act of 1848, he called for the [[police force]] to force out numerous opposition representatives. He managed to pass the Act of Protection, resulting in the removal  of some members of the opposition party.\n\nAs a result, [[Gyula Kov\u00e1cs]], an opposition party representative, tried to assassinate Tisza in the Parliament Building on 7 June 1912. His shots missed and the marks are still visible in the Hungarian Parliament Building to this day. With his last shot Kov\u00e1cs shot himself, but he survived. Tisza then continued the session.\n\n===Prime minister for second time, 1913\u20131917 ===\n\nTisza became prime minister again on 7 June 1913.\n\n====Freedom of the press====\nInspired by the Western European model, Tisza's cabinet introduced for the first time in the history of Hungarian journalism the legal category of [[defamation]], libel and \"scare-mongering\", thus the press became actionable before the courts. Journalists and newspapers had to pay compensations for the victims of defamation and libel. Despite these institutions and laws worked well in Western Europe and in the United States, the contemporary Hungarian newspapers and journalists considered it as the violation of the Freedom of Speech and the Freedom of Press.\n\n====Croatia====\nCount Istv\u00e1n Tisza tried to solve the Hungarian-Croatian issue, which had long lasted at that time, to clarify the relationship; for this matter, he met Count Tivadar Pej\u00e1csevich, Count of Verovce, Croatian Ban, and a year later, Baron Lomnica, Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz, the new Croatian Ban.\n\n==Foreign policy and the Great War==\n\n[[File:Istv\u00e1n Tisza and Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf.jpg|thumb|Tisza and H\u00f6tzendorf left Vienna after 3 days long fierce debate.]]\n\nA few days before the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]], which resulted in World War I, Tisza supported a strong stand against [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. However, after the assassination he was against going to war against Serbia, a rare view in Austria-Hungary. He knew the army's strength, and he was afraid that with the increase of more [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] territories the equilibrium inside the monarchy would be upset. Moreover, he was afraid that [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] would attack [[Transylvania]].<ref>K\u00f6peczy-Makkai-M\u00f3csy-Sz\u00e1sz: History of Transylvania</ref> The loss of the alliance with the [[German Empire]] would have meant the end of Austria-Hungary as a [[Great Power]], so he gave in and supported the war. He then became a relentless supporter of the war until its end.\n\nTisza believed Romania to be an enemy from the beginning. He was afraid that if Romania attacked Hungary then the Romanians in Transylvania would revolt against Hungary. In the end, 40,000 soldiers were moved to protect Transylvania.\n\nDuring the war, the reformists became more and more powerful, but he continued to oppose them. At the time, Tisza was seen as forcing the continuation of the war and was losing a great deal of support. He opposed the ideas of the new Emperor, [[Charles I of Austria|Karl I]], and was asked to resign; he did so on 23 May 1917.<ref>https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/crisis-in-austria-hungary</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=0RuDCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=istvan+tisza+austria+forced+to+resign#v=onepage&q=istvan%20tisza%20austria%20forced%20to%20resign&f=false | title=The Age of Catastrophe: A History of the West 1914\u20131945| isbn=9780300213096| last1=Winkler| first1=Heinrich August| date=28 September 2015}}</ref> However, he retained great political influence, and was able to delay the enactment of universal [[suffrage]].\n\nDuring this period of international insecurity, he wanted to solidify the government.

As a ''homo regius'' (\"king's man\"), he went to Sarajevo to attempt this, but without success.\n\n===His judgement from abroad during and after the war===\nIt is clear that after the outbreak of World War I, all opposing sides pointed to the other side as the party guilty of initiating the greater war.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The British newspaper \"New Europe\" printed a comment that Hungary was the only responsible party for the war, ''\"where Hungary\u2032s responsibility is greater than Austria\u2032s\"'' and that Tisza was the militaristic politician who dragged all sides into war. As a consequence the \"[[Little Entente]]\" took this view and pushed to punish Hungary at the end of the war. Later, the propaganda of these nations augmented and even invented Tisza's guilt, claiming that he took pains to point out in a report of 8 July that \"there should at any rate be no question of the annihilation or annexation of Serbia, and that if Serbia gave way, Austria-Hungary must be content.\" According to recent findings these accusations are without merit.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe accusations are rooted in the common belief that Tisza carried out a policy of forced [[Magyarization]] towards the ethnic minorities in Hungary. His minority policy was (directly or indirectly) often confused with the policy of his radical nationalist political opponents in the 1906 -1910 period (like the [[Party of Independence and '48]]).\n\n===His view on the war===\n[[File:Graf Stefan Tisza (BildID 15720072).jpg|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza served on the Italian front between 1917-1918, where he had opportunity to experience the circumstances and dangers of trench warfare on a daily basis]]\n\nTisza opposed the expansion of the empire on the Balkan (see [[Bosnian crisis]] in 1908), because \"the Dual Monarchy already had too many Slavs\", which would further threaten the integrity of the Dual Monarchy.<ref>William Jannen: Lions of July: Prelude to War, 1914 - PAGE:456</ref>\n\nIn March 1914, Tisza wrote a memorandum to Emperor Francis Joseph. His letter had strongly apocalyptic predictive and embittered tone. He used exactly the hitherto unknown \"Weltkrieg\" (means World War) phrase in his letter.\n\"It is my firm conviction that Germany's two neighbors [Russia and France] are carefully proceeding with military preparations, but will not start the war so long as they have not attained a grouping of the Balkan states against us that confronts the monarchy with an attack from three sides and pins down the majority of our forces on our eastern and southern front.\"<ref>David G. Herrmann: The Arming of Europe and the Making of the First World War - PAGE: 211, Princeton University Press, (1997) {{ISBN|9780691015958}}</ref>\n\nOn the day of the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], Tisza immediately traveled to [[Vienna]] where he met Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Berchtold and Army Commander Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf. They proposed to solve the dispute with arms, attacking [[Serbia]]. Tisza proposed to give the government of Serbia time to take a stand as to whether it was involved in the organisation of the murder and proposed a peaceful resolution, arguing that the international situation would settle soon. Returning to Budapest, he wrote to [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] saying he would not take any responsibility for the armed conflict because there was no proof that Serbia had plotted the assassination. Tisza opposed a war with Serbia, stating (correctly, as it turned out) that any war with the Serbs was bound to trigger a war with Russia and hence a general European war.<ref>Fischer, Fritz: Germany\u2019s Aims in the First World War, New York, W.W. Norton, 1967, {{ISBN|978-0-393-09798-6}}  (PAGE: 52)</ref> He thought that even a successful Austro-Hungarian war would be disastrous for the integrity of Kingdom of Hungary, where Hungary would be the next victim of Austrian politics. After a successful war against Serbia, Tisza adumbrated a possible Austrian military attack against Kingdom of Hungary, where the Austrians want to break up the territory of Hungary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/tisza.htm |first=Michael |last=Duffy |title=Who's Who - Count Istvan Tisza de Boros-Jeno |publisher=firstworldwar.com}}</ref> He did not trust in the Italian alliance, due to the political aftermath of the [[Second Italian War of Independence]]. He felt the threat of [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] after the [[Balkan wars]] and was afraid of [[Romania]]n attack from the east. He was also not sure about the stand of the [[Germans]]. Germany's stand was of ultimate importance due to the security of the state. \n \nDuring a conversation between Franz Joseph and Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf, Conrad asked, \"If Germany's reply is that they are on our side, do we engage in war with Serbia?\" The emperor replied, \"Then yes\", \"But what if they reply differently?\", \"Then the Monarchy will be alone\".\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II supported the war, promised to neutralize a Romanian attack, and put pressure on [[Sofia]]. After this, Tisza still sought a peaceful solution, but most of all he wanted to wait for the result of the official examination into the assassination. The only proposal of Tisza, which was accepted, was that the Monarchy should not annihilate Serbia completely in order to avoid Russian support for Serbia. The council finally addressed an [[ultimatum]] to the Serbian government and immediately started the [[mobilisation]] of troops.\n\nAfter sending the ultimatum, his view changed. The ultimatum was obsolete within 48 hours, so Tisza wrote: \"it was a difficult decision to take a stand to propose war, but now I am firmly convinced of its necessity\"<ref>Tschirschky's report to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 14 July 1914</ref> He was, however, still opposed to the annexation of Serbia to the Monarchy, but failed. On 4 August 1914 Russia, Germany, Britain and France also entered the war, enlarging it to a world war.\n\nTisza did not resign from the Prime Ministry, as he thought remaining in this position was the best way he could represent Hungarian interests inside Austria-Hungary, as he had connections in Vienna. Moreover, his resignation would have sent a message of weakness to the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] at the outbreak of war.\n\nHis initial opposition to the conflict, only became public after the end of World War 1, on 17 October 1918, when he spoke in the Parliament. He said, \"the Monarchy and the Hungarian nation were longing for peace all the way until there were proofs that the enemy was systematically trying to humiliate and destroy us as soon as possible (...) As we have found proofs that the Serbian government took part in organising the assassination, we could not but address an ultimatum to Serbia&nbsp;... where we stipulated that the war is preventive.\"\n\n=== The struggle of a WW1 political leader in the trenches ===\n\nThe 57 years old Tisza joined to the 2nd Hussar Regiment of Hungary - which served on the Italian front - as a hussar colonel, and personally led his hussar units during the attacks.\n\nTisza at the front: \"Tisza already felt the not too friendly atmosphere surrounding him at the first days of his joining up to the regiment and at first he tried to ease the general mood by informal behavior. (...) He has made an effort from the beginning to use an informal tone both with the staff of officers and -of course within the limits of the service regulations- with the rank and file. To better get to know each other with his fellow officers, every day he invited some young officers to his table, this way he tried to establish better personal relations with his environment. The troops had slowly started to recognize him as \"tough to the upwards and humane to the downwards\" kind of a commander. He distributed his tobacco provisions among the officers and he used his commander pay to improve the catering of the troops, and these of course left a good impression on everybody.\nTisza's paternalistic attitude towards his subordinates also manifested itself in civil law cases: he helped with his personal influence in getting done of those petitions what he considered fair, he interceded with notaries, judges, alisp\u00e1ns (deputy-lieutenants) for advancing the home affairs of his men, due to this both the officers and the troops more and more came to like and embrace him. Tisza himself also felt that the front service had been quite useful and productive since on the one hand he could personally experience the dangers of the battleground an on the other hand-at least he was thinking that way and there is a lot of truth in it-he could truly become familiar with the real nature of the simple, peasant origin soldiers. He wrote about peasant soldiers in this way in a letter to Archduke Joseph: \"I\u2019ve got to truly know the ordinary [peasants] people now. This is the most extraordinary race of the world that can only be loved and respected. How unfortunate that the political intelligentia doesn\u2019t do anything else, just corrupts this great and God-blessed people.\" <ref>Peter Strausz: (Hungarian) \"Istv\u00e1n Tisza and the Second Hussar Regiment\" [http://mek.oszk.hu/03200/03296/03296.doc]</ref>\n\n==Assassination attempts==\n[[File:Monument to Tisza Istvan outside the Budapest Parliament building.jpg|thumb|Monument to Tisza Istvan outside the Budapest Parliament building]]\n\nFor many, he was the representative of the war policy in the Monarchy, so he was an assassination target. The fourth assassination attempt against him was successful.\n\nThe first attempt was made in the Hungarian parliament in 1912 by Gyula Kov\u00e1cs, an opposition politician. He shot two bullets, but missed Tisza. Kov\u00e1cs was arrested by the police, but he was acquitted by the court, the justification was \"temporary insanity\".\n\nThe second was made by a soldier when Tisza was returning from the front line during the war. The bullet missed him.\n\nThe third attempt came on 16 October 1918 when [[J\u00e1nos L\u00e9kai]], a member of the society [[Galilei-circle]] and an anti-military group led by [[Ott\u00f3 Korvin]], tried to kill Tisza while he was leaving the [[Hungarian Parliament]], but the revolver malfunctioned and Tisza managed to flee.<ref>Andr\u00e1s Sikl\u00f3s.

{"title_page": "African humid period", "text_new": "{{good article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{Short description|Holocene climate period during which northern Africa was wetter than today}}\n[[File:Sahara satellite hires.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|The Sahara was not a [[Hot desert|desert]] during the African humid period. Instead, most of northern Africa was covered by grass, trees, and lakes.]]\nThe '''African humid period''' (AHP) is a climate period in Africa during the late [[Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene]] geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in [[Earth's orbit|Earth's orbit around the Sun]]; changes in vegetation and dust in the [[Sahara]] which strengthened the [[African monsoon]]; and increased [[greenhouse gas]]es, which may imply that [[anthropogenic global warming]] will also result in a shrinkage of the Sahara desert.\n\nDuring the preceding [[last glacial maximum]], the Sahara contained extensive [[dune]] fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, but its lakes and rivers such as [[Lake Victoria]] and the [[White Nile]] were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600\u201314,500 years ago at the end of [[Heinrich event|Heinrich event 1]], simultaneously to the [[B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d warming]]. Rivers and lakes such as [[Lake Chad]] formed or expanded, [[glacier]]s grew on [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the [[Younger Dryas]] and the short [[8.2 kiloyear event]]. The African humid period ended 6,000\u20135,000 years ago during the [[Piora Oscillation]] cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the [[Sahel]], Arabia and East Africa the period appears to have taken place in several steps such as the [[4.2 kiloyear event]].\n\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Deserts, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the [[Ancient Egypt|Pharaonic civilization]]. They lived as [[hunter-gatherer]]s until the [[First Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]] and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left [[archeological site]]s and artifacts such as one of the [[Dufuna canoe|oldest ships in the world]], and [[rock painting]]s such as those in the [[Cave of Swimmers]] and in the [[Acacus Mountains]]. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the [[Nile Valley]] and [[Mesopotamia]], where they gave rise to early complex societies.\n\n== Research history ==\n\n[[Herodotus]] in 440 [[Before Christ|BC]] and [[Strabon]] in 23 [[AD]] discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher [[Heinrich Barth]] discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering [[petroglyph]]s in the [[Murzuq Desert]], and further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy]] to coin the concept of a ''[[Green Sahara]]'' in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes<ref name=\"Bader2017\" />{{sfn|Hoelzmann|Holmes|2017|p=3}} and higher [[Nile]] flow levels was increasingly reported{{sfn|McCool|2019|p=5}} and it was recognized that the [[Holocene]] featured a humid period in the Sahara.{{sfn|Dawelbeit|Jaillard|Eisawi|2019|p=12}}\n\nThe idea that changes in Earth's orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such [[orbit]]al controls on climate was found.<ref name=\"Bader2017\" /> At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"[[pluvial hypothesis]]\") before [[radiocarbon dating]] became widespread.{{sfn|Wendorf|Karl\u00e9n|Schild|2007|p=190}}\n\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with [[archeology]], [[climate

have included the drying of soils and loss of vegetation after decreased rainfall,{{sfn|Menocal|2015|p=1}} which would have led to wind-driven [[deflation]] of the soils.{{sfn|Menocal|2015|p=2}}\n* An expansion of [[sea ice]] around [[Antarctica]] about 5,000 calibrated years ago may have provided another positive feedback.{{sfn|Guilderson|Charles|Crosta|Shemesh|2001|p=197}}\n* The expanding dry

Specifically, about 6,000\u20135,000 years ago the [[Arctic]] became colder, with [[sea ice]] expanding, temperatures in Europe and off Northern Africa decreasing and the [[Atlantic meridional overturning circulation]] weakening.{{sfn|Schefu\u00df|Roche|Skonieczny|Mulitza|2017|p=7}} This cooling tendency may have weakened the [[Tropical Easterly Jet]] and thus reduced the amount of precipitation falling over Africa.{{sfn|Schefu\u00df|Roche|Skonieczny|Mulitza|2017|p=9}}\n\nThe orbitally-induced changes of precipitation may have been modified by the [[solar cycle]]; specifically, solar activity maxima during the ending phase of the AHP may have offset the orbital effect and thus stabilized precipitation levels, while solar activity minima compounded the orbital effects and thus induced rapid decreases in lake water levels of [[Lake Turkana]].{{sfn|Schuster|Nutz|2016|p=1616}} At Lake Victoria on the other hand, solar variations appear to sometimes lead to drough and

today}}\n[[File:Sahara satellite hires.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|The Sahara was not a [[Hot desert|desert]] during the African humid period. Instead, most of northern Africa was covered by grass, trees, and lakes.]]\nThe '''African humid period''' (AHP) is a climate period in Africa during the late [[Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene]] geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in [[Earth's orbit|Earth's orbit around the Sun]]; changes in vegetation and dust in the [[Sahara]] which strengthened the [[African monsoon]]; and increased [[greenhouse gas]]es, which may imply that [[anthropogenic global warming]] will also result in a shrinkage of the Sahara desert.\n\nDuring the preceding [[last glacial maximum]], the Sahara contained extensive [[dune]] fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, but its lakes and rivers such as [[Lake Victoria]] and the [[White Nile]] were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600\u201314,500 years ago at the end of [[Heinrich event|Heinrich event 1]], simultaneously to the [[B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d warming]]. Rivers and lakes such as [[Lake Chad]] formed or expanded, [[glacier]]s grew on [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the [[Younger Dryas]] and and the short [[8.2 kiloyear event]]. The African humid period ended 6,000\u20135,000 years ago during the [[Piora Oscillation]] cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the [[Sahel]], Arabia and East Africa the period appears to have taken place in several steps such as the [[4.2 kiloyear event]].\n\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Deserts, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the [[Ancient Egypt|Pharaonic civilization]]. They lived as [[hunter-gatherer]]s until the [[First Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]] and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left [[archeological site]]s and artifacts such as one of the [[Dufuna canoe|oldest ships in the world]], and [[rock painting]]s such as those in the [[Cave of Swimmers]] and in the [[Acacus Mountains]]. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the [[Nile Valley]] and [[Mesopotamia]], where they gave rise to early complex societies.\n\n== Research history ==\n\n[[Herodotus]] in 440 [[Before Christ|BC]] and [[Strabon]] in 23 [[AD]] discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher [[Heinrich Barth]] discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering [[petroglyph]]s in the [[Murzuq Desert]], and further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy]] to coin the concept of a ''[[Green Sahara]]'' in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes<ref name=\"Bader2017\" />{{sfn|Hoelzmann|Holmes|2017|p=3}} and higher [[Nile]] flow levels was increasingly reported{{sfn|McCool|2019|p=5}} and it was recognized that the [[Holocene]] featured a humid period in the Sahara.{{sfn|Dawelbeit|Jaillard|Eisawi|2019|p=12}}\n\nThe idea that changes in Earth's orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such [[orbit]]al controls on climate was found.<ref name=\"Bader2017\" /> At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"[[pluvial hypothesis]]\") before [[radiocarbon dating]] became widespread.{{sfn|Wendorf|Karl\u00e9n|Schild|2007|p=190}}\n\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with [[archeology]], [[climate model]]ling and [[paleoproxies]],{{sfn|Timm|K\u00f6hler|Timmermann|Menviel|2010|p=2612}} with [[archeological site]]s,{{sfn|Hoelzmann|Keding|Berke|Kr\u00f6pelin|2001|p=193}} [[dune]]s and deposits left by lakes, the sea and wetlands playing an important role.{{sfn|Hoelzmann|Holmes|2017|p=3}} [[Pollen]], lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period,{{sfn|Stivers|Dutheil|Moots|Cocca|2008|p=2}} and [[charcoal]] and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes.{{sfn|Watrin|L\u00e9zine|H\u00e9ly|2009|p=657}}\n\n=== Research issues ===\n\nWhile the precipitation changes since the last glacial cycle are well established, the magnitude and timing of the changes are unclear.{{sfn|L\u00e9zine|Duplessy|Cazet|2005|p=227}} Depending on how and where measurements and reconstructions are made, different beginning dates, ending dates, durations{{sfn|McCool|2019|p=5}} and precipitation levels{{sfn|Junginger|Roller|Olaka|Trauth|2014|p=1}} have been determined for the African humid period.{{sfn|McCool|2019|p=5}} The amounts of precipitation reconstructed from [[paleoclimate]] records and simulated by climate modelling are often inconsistent with each other;{{sfn|Skinner|Poulsen|2016|p=349}} in general, the simulation of the Green Sahara is considered a problem for [[earth system]] models.{{sfn|Hopcroft|Valdes|Harper|Beerling|2017|p=6805}} Erosion of lake sediments and carbon [[reservoir effect]]s make it difficult to date when they dried up.{{sfn|Menocal|Ortiz|Guilderson|Adkins|2000|p=348}} Vegetation changes by themselves do not necessarily indicate precipitation changes, as changes in seasonality, plant species composition and changes in [[land use]] also play a role in vegetation changes.{{sfn|Peck|Scholz|King|Heil|2015|p=140}} [[Isotope ratio]]s such as the [[hydrogen]]/[[deuterium]] ratio that have been used to reconstruct past precipitation values likewise are under the influence of various physical effects, which complicates their interpretation.{{sfn|Hoelzmann|Holmes|2017|p=11}}\n\n=== Terminology ===\n\nEarlier humid periods are sometimes known as \"African humid periods\"{{sfn|Kr\u00fcger|Beuscher|Schmiedl|Ehrmann|2017|p=1}} and a number of dry/wet periods have been defined for the Central Africa region.{{sfn|Sangen|2012|p=144}} In general, these types of climate fluctuations between wetter and drier periods are known as \"[[pluvial]]s\" and \"[[interpluvial]]s\", respectively.{{sfn|M\u00e9dail|Duong|Roig|Fady|2013|p=1}}{{efn|Other terms that have been applied to the [[Holocene]] AHP or correlative climate phases are \"Holocene humid period\", which also covers an analogous episode in Arabia and Asia;{{sfn|L\u00e9zine|Ivory|Braconnot|Marti|2017|p=68}}  \"Holocene Pluvial\";{{sfn|Runge|2013|p=81}} \"Holocene Wet Phase\";{{sfn|Olsen|2017|p=90}} \"{{lang|fr|Kibangien A}}\" in Central Africa;{{sfn|Sangen|2012|p=213}}  \"Makalian\" for the [[Neolithic]] period of northern Sudan;{{sfn|Spinage|2012|p=71}} \"Nabtian Wet Phase\"{{sfn|Said|1993|p=128}} or \"Nabtian period\" for the 14,000\u20136,000 humid period over the Eastern Mediterranean and [[Levant]];{{sfn|Revel|Ducassou|Grousset|Bernasconi|2010|p=1357}} \"[[Neolithic pluvial]]\";<ref name=\"Brass2018\" /> \"[[Neolithic Subpluvial]]\";{{sfn|Olsen|2017|p=90}} \"{{lang|fr|Nouakchottien}}\" of the Western Sahara 6,500 - 4,000 years before present;{{sfn|Baumhauer|Runge|2009|p=10}} and \"{{lang|fr|Tchadien}}\" in the Central Sahara 14,000 - 7,500 years before present.{{sfn|Baumhauer|Runge|2009|p=10}}}}{{efn|The terms \"{{lang|fr|L\u00e9opoldvillien}}\"{{sfn|Sangen|2012|p=211}} and {{ill|Ogolien|fr}} have been applied to the dry period in the [[last glacial maximum]],{{sfn|Soriano|Tribolo|Maggetti|Ozainne|2009|p=2}} the latter is equivalent to the \"Kanemian\";{{sfn|Pachur|Altmann|2006|p=32}} \"Kanemian dry period\" refers to a dry period between 20,000\u201313,000 years [[before present]] in the [[Lake Chad]] area.{{sfn|Sepulchre|Schuster|Ramstein|Krinnezr|2008|p=42}}}}\n\n== Background and beginning ==\n\nThe African humid period took place in the late [[Pleistocene]]{{sfn|Menocal|Ortiz|Guilderson|Adkins|2000|p=347}} and early-middle Holocene,{{sfn|Quade|Dente|Armon|Ben Dor|2018|p=1}} and saw increased precipitation in Northern and Western Africa due to a northward migration of the tropical rainbelt.{{sfn|Peck|Scholz|King|Heil|2015|p=140}}{{sfn|Costa|Russell|Konecky|Lamb|2014|p=58}} Within the otherwise relatively climatically stable Holocene, the AHP is considered to be a major fluctuation.{{sfn|Blanchet|Tjallingii|Frank|Lorenzen|2013|p=98}} It is part of the so-called [[Holocene climatic optimum]], during which summers in the Northern Hemisphere were warmer than today.{{sfn|Petoukhov|Kubatzki|Ganopolski|Brovkin|2003|p=99}}{{efn|The hypsithermal, which coincides with the AHP,<ref name=\"Badino2018\" /> has been recorded from Arabia,{{sfn|Vahrenholt|L\u00fcning|2019|p=507}} the [[Caribbean]]<ref name=\"GreerSwart2006\" /> and the [[Mediterranean]].<ref name=\"Sbaffi2004\" />}} Liu ''et al.'' 2017{{sfn|Liu|Rendle-B\u00fchring|Kuhlmann|Li|2017|p=123}} subdivided the humid period into an \"AHP I\" which lasted until 8,000 years ago, and an \"AHP II\" from 8,000 years

have included the drying of soils and loss of vegetation after decreased rainfall,{{sfn|Menocal|2015|p=1}} which would have led to wind-driven [[deflation]] of the soils.{{sfn|Menocal|2015|p=2}}\n* An expansion of [[sea ice]] around [[Antarctica]] about 5,000 calibrated years ago may have provided another positive feedback.{{sfn|Guilderson|Charles|Crosta|Shemesh|2001|p=197}}\n* The expanding dry

Specifically, about 6,000\u20135,000 years ago the [[Arctic]] became colder, with [[sea ice]] expanding, temperatures in Europe and off Northern Africa decreasing and the [[Atlantic meridional overturning circulation]] weakening.{{sfn|Schefu\u00df|Roche|Skonieczny|Mulitza|2017|p=7}} This cooling tendency may have weakened the [[Tropical Easterly Jet]] and thus reduced the amount of precipitation falling over Africa.{{sfn|Schefu\u00df|Roche|Skonieczny|Mulitza|2017|p=9}}\n\nThe orbitally-induced changes of precipitation may have been modified by the [[solar cycle]]; specifically, solar activity maxima during the ending phase of the AHP may have offset the orbital effect and thus stabilized precipitation levels, while solar activity minima compounded the orbital effects and thus induced rapid decreases in lake water levels of [[Lake Turkana]].{{sfn|Schuster|Nutz|2016|p=1616}} At Lake Victoria on the other hand, solar variations appear to sometimes lead to drough and
