UROD makes an enzyme called [[uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase]], which is critical to the chemical process that leads to heme production. The activity of this enzyme is usually reduced by 50% in all tissues in people with the inherited form of the condition.\n\nNongenetic factors such as [[alcohol abuse]], excess [[iron]], and others listed above can increase the demand for heme and the enzymes required to make heme. The combination of this increased demand and reduced activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase disrupts heme production and allows byproducts of the process to accumulate in the body, triggering the signs and symptoms of porphyria cutanea tarda.\n\nThe ''[[HFE gene|HFE]]'' gene makes a protein that helps cells regulate the absorption of iron from the digestive tract and into the cells of the body. Certain mutations in the ''HFE'' gene cause [[hemochromatosis]] (an [[iron overload disorder]]). People who have these mutations are also at an increased risk of developing porphyria cutanea tarda.\n\nIn the 20% of cases where porphyria cutanea tarda is inherited, it is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to decrease enzyme activity and cause the signs and symptoms of the disorder.\n\n===Other===\nWhile inherited deficiencies in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase often lead to the development of PCT, there are a number of risk factors that can both cause and exacerbate the symptoms of this disease.

Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase occurs in nature as a homodimer of two subunits.  It participates in the fifth step in heme synthesis pathway, and is active in the cytosol.  This enzymatic conversion results in coproporphyrinogen III as the primary product.  This is accomplished by the clockwise removal of the four carboxyl groups present in the cyclic uroporphyrinogen III molecule. Therefore, a deficiency in this enzyme causes the aforementioned buildup of uroporphyrinogen and hepta-carboxylic [[porphyrinogen]], and to a lesser extent hexa-carboxylic porphyrinogen, and penta-carboxylic porphyrinogen in the urine, which can be helpful in the diagnosis of this disorder.<ref>https://labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/porphyrins/tab/test/{{full citation needed|date=December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1008499 |year=1976 |last1=Jackson |first1=A.

Due to the highly conjugated structure of porphyrins involving alternating single and double carbon bonds, these compounds exhibit a deep purple color, resulting in the discoloration observed in the skin.  Excess alcohol intake decreases [[hepcidin]] production which leads to increased iron absorption from the gut and an increase in oxidative stress.  This oxidative stress then leads to inhibition of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, creating an excess of uroporphyrinogen III which is oxidized from  the relatively harmless porphyrinogens into their reduced porphyrins form.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1478-3231.2012.02794.x |pmid=22510500 |pmc=3418709 |title=Hepatitis C, porphyria cutanea tarda and liver iron: An update |journal=Liver International |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=880\u201393 |year=2012 |last1=Ryan Caballes |first1=F. |last2=Sendi |first2=Hossein |last3=Bonkovsky |first3=Herbert L. }}</ref>  Concentrated instances of oxidative stress (alcohol, physical trauma, psychological stress, etc.) cause the liver to hemorrhage these porphyrins into the blood stream where they are then susceptible to oxidation.\nThe strong association of PCT with Hepatitis C infection is not entirely understood.

This iron can disrupt the activity of cytochrome p450, releasing activated oxygen species.

It is thought to do so by causing oxidative damage to liver cells, resulting in oxidized species of uroporphyrinogen that inhibit the activity of hepatic UROD.  It is also felt to increase the uptake of iron in liver cells, leading to further oxidation of uroporphyrinogen by the release of activated oxygen species. Additionally, exposure to chlorinated cyclic hydrocarbons can lead to a deficiency in the activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, causing the buildup of excess uroporphyrinogen. Additionally, alcohol has been shown to increase the activity of the delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase (ALA synthetase), the rate-limiting enzymatic step in heme synthesis in the mitochondria, in rats.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000197995 |pmid=838185 |title=Effect of Alcohol on the Heme and Porphyrin Synthesis Interaction with Phenobarbital and Pyrazole |journal=Digestion |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=136\u201346 |year=2009 |last1=Held |first1=H. }}</ref> Therefore, alcohol consumption may increase the production of uroporphyrinogen, exacerbating symptoms in individuals with porphyria cutanea tarda.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Diagnosis==\nWhile the most common symptom of PCT is the appearance of skin lesions and blistering, their appearance does not single-handedly lead to a conclusive diagnosis.  Laboratory testing will commonly reveal high levels of uroporphyrinogen in the urine, clinically referred to as uroporphyrinogenuria.  Additionally, testing for common risk factors such as Hepatitis C and hemochromatosis is strongly suggested, as their high prevalence in patients with PCT may require additional treatment.

Type\n! [[OMIM]]\n! Description\n|-\n| Type I (\"sporadic\")\n| {{OMIM2|176090}}\n| Type I porphyria cutanea tarda, the sporadic form, is indicated by UROD deficiency that is observed only in hepatic cells and nowhere else in the body.  Genetically, these individuals will not exhibit deficiency in the UROD gene, although other genetic factors such as HFE deficiency (resulting in hemochromatosis and the buildup of iron in the liver) are thought to play a key role.  Typically in these individuals, a variety of risk factors such as alcohol abuse and Hepatitis C infection conspire to result in the clinical manifestation of PCT.\n|-\n| Type II (\"familial\")\n| {{OMIM2|176100}}\n| Patients exhibiting Type II PCT have a specific deficiency in the UROD gene, passed down in an autosomal dominant pattern.  Those possessing this deficiency are heterozygous for the UROD gene.  They do not show a complete lack of functional uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, only a deficient form of the enzyme that is marked by reduced conversion of uroporphyrinogen to coproporphyrinogen.  Therefore, the expression of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase will be reduced throughout the body of these individuals, while it is isolated to the liver in Type I patients.  While this genetic deficiency is the main distinction between Type I and Type II PCT, the risk factors mentioned before are often seen in patients presenting with Type II PCT.  In fact, many people who possess the deficient UROD gene often go their entire lives without having a clinical manifestation of PCT symptoms.\n|-\n| Type III\n| -\n| The least common is Type III, which is no different from Type I insofar as the patients possess normal UROD genes.  Despite this, Type III PCT is observed in more than one family member, indicating a genetic component unrelated to the expression of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.\n|}\n\nOne study used 74% as the cutoff for UROD activity, with those patients under that number being classified as type II, and those above classified as type III if there was a family history, and type I if there was not.<ref name=\"pmid12699242\">{{cite journal |pmid=12699242 |year=2002 |last1=Cruz-Rojo |first1=J |title=Precipitating/aggravating factors of porphyria cutanea tarda in Spanish patients |journal=Cellular and Molecular Biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France) |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=845\u201352 |last2=Fontanellas |first2=A |last3=Mor\u00e1n-Jim\u00e9nez |first3=M.

Primarily, it is key that patients diagnosed with PCT avoid alcohol consumption, iron supplements, excess exposure to sunlight (especially in the summer), as well as estrogen and chlorinated cyclic hydrocarbons, all of which can potentially exacerbate the disorder.  Additionally, the management of excess iron (due to the commonality of hemochromatosis in PCT patients) can be achieved through [[phlebotomy]], whereby blood is systematically drained from the patient. A borderline iron deficiency has been found to have a protective effect by limiting heme synthesis.  In the absence of iron, which is to be incorporated in the porphyrin formed in the last step of the synthesis, the mRNA of erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS-2) is blocked by attachment of an iron-responsive element (IRE) binding cytosolic protein, and transcription of this key enzyme is inhibited.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11202048 |year=2000 |last1=Thunell |first1=S |title=Porphyrins, porphyrin metabolism and porphyrias.

Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase occurs in nature as a homodimer of two subunits.  It participates in the fifth step in heme synthesis pathway, and is active in the cytosol.  This enzymatic conversion results in coproporphyrinogen III as the primary product.  This is accomplished by the clockwise removal of the four carboxyl groups present in the cyclic uroporphyrinogen III molecule. Therefore, a deficiency in this enzyme causes the aforementioned buildup of uroporphyrinogen and hepta-carboxylic [[porphyrinogen]], and to a lesser extent hexa-carboxylic porphyrinogen, and penta-carboxylic porphyrinogen in the urine, which can be helpful in the diagnosis of this disorder.<ref>https://labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/porphyrins/tab/test/{{full citation needed|date=December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1008499 |year=1976 |last1=Jackson |first1=A.

Due to the highly conjugated structure of porphyrins involving alternating single and double carbon bonds, these compounds exhibit a deep purple color, resulting in the discoloration observed in the skin.  Excess alcohol intake decreases [[hepcidin]] production which leads to increased iron absorption from the gut and an increase in oxidative stress.  This oxidative stress then leads to inhibition of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, creating an excess of uroporphyrinogen III which is oxidized from  the relatively harmless porphyrinogens into their reduced porphyrins form.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1478-3231.2012.02794.x |pmid=22510500 |pmc=3418709 |title=Hepatitis C, porphyria cutanea tarda and liver iron: An update |journal=Liver International |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=880\u201393 |year=2012 |last1=Ryan Caballes |first1=F. |last2=Sendi |first2=Hossein |last3=Bonkovsky |first3=Herbert L. }}</ref>  Concentrated instances of oxidative stress (alcohol, physical trauma, psychological stress, etc.) cause the liver to hemorrhage these porphyrins into the blood stream where they are then susceptible to oxidation.\nThe strong association of PCT with Hepatitis C infection is not entirely understood.  Studies have suggested that the cytopathic effect of the virus on hepatocytes can lead to the release of free iron.  This iron can disrupt the activity of cytochrome p450, releasing activated oxygen species.  These can oxidize the UROD substrate uroporphyrinogen, which can result in the inhibition of UROD and lead to deficient activity of this key enzyme.\n\nExcess alcohol abuse is frequently associated with both inducing PCT<ref name=\"urleMedicine/Stedman Medical Dictionary Lookup!\">{{EMedicine|article|1103643|Porphyria Cutanea Tarda}}</ref> and aggravating a preexisting diagnosis of the disorder.  It is thought to do so by causing oxidative damage to liver cells, resulting in oxidized species of uroporphyrinogen that inhibit the activity of hepatic UROD.  It is also felt to increase the uptake of iron in liver cells, leading to further oxidation of uroporphyrinogen by the release of activated oxygen species. Additionally, exposure to chlorinated cyclic hydrocarbons can lead to a deficiency in the activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, causing the buildup of excess uroporphyrinogen.

Laboratory testing will commonly reveal high levels of uroporphyrinogen in the urine, clinically referred to as uroporphyrinogenuria.  Additionally, testing for common risk factors such as Hepatitis C and hemochromatosis is strongly suggested, as their high prevalence in patients with PCT may require additional treatment.

Type\n! [[OMIM]]\n! Description\n|-\n| Type I (\"sporadic\")\n| {{OMIM2|176090}}\n| Type I porphyria cutanea tarda, the sporadic form, is indicated by UROD deficiency that is observed only in hepatic cells and nowhere else in the body.  Genetically, these individuals will not exhibit deficiency in the UROD gene, although other genetic factors such as HFE deficiency (resulting in hemochromatosis and the buildup of iron in the liver) are thought to play a key role.  Typically in these individuals, a variety of risk factors such as alcohol abuse and Hepatitis C infection conspire to result in the clinical manifestation of PCT.\n|-\n| Type II (\"familial\")\n| {{OMIM2|176100}}\n| Patients exhibiting Type II PCT have a specific deficiency in the UROD gene, passed down in an autosomal dominant pattern.  Those possessing this deficiency are heterozygous for the UROD gene.  They do not show a complete lack of functional uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, only a deficient form of the enzyme that is marked by reduced conversion of uroporphyrinogen to coproporphyrinogen.  Therefore, the expression of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase will be reduced throughout the body of these individuals, while it is isolated to the liver in Type I patients.  While this genetic deficiency is the main distinction between Type I and Type II PCT, the risk factors mentioned before are often seen in patients presenting with Type II PCT.  In fact, many people who possess the deficient UROD gene often go their entire lives without having a clinical manifestation of PCT symptoms.\n|-\n| Type III\n| -\n| The least common is Type III, which is no different from Type I insofar as the patients possess normal UROD genes.  Despite this, Type III PCT is observed in more than one family member, indicating a genetic component unrelated to the expression of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.\n|}\n\nOne study used 74% as the cutoff for UROD activity, with those patients under that number being classified as type II, and those above classified as type III if there was a family history, and type I if there was not.<ref name=\"pmid12699242\">{{cite journal |pmid=12699242 |year=2002 |last1=Cruz-Rojo |first1=J |title=Precipitating/aggravating factors of porphyria cutanea tarda in Spanish patients |journal=Cellular and Molecular Biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France) |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=845\u201352 |last2=Fontanellas |first2=A |last3=Mor\u00e1n-Jim\u00e9nez |first3=M.

Primarily, it is key that patients diagnosed with PCT avoid alcohol consumption, iron supplements, excess exposure to sunlight (especially in the summer), as well as estrogen and chlorinated cyclic hydrocarbons, all of which can potentially exacerbate the disorder.  Additionally, the management of excess iron (due to the commonality of hemochromatosis in PCT patients) can be achieved through [[phlebotomy]], whereby blood is systematically drained from the patient. A borderline iron deficiency has been found to have a protective effect by limiting heme synthesis.  In the absence of iron, which is to be incorporated in the porphyrin formed in the last step of the synthesis, the mRNA of erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS-2) is blocked by attachment of an iron-responsive element (IRE) binding cytosolic protein, and transcription of this key enzyme is inhibited.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11202048 |year=2000 |last1=Thunell |first1=S |title=Porphyrins, porphyrin metabolism and porphyrias.

Retrieved June 24, 2018]</ref>\n\nThe film was controversial for fictionalizing aspects of the case and for neglecting significant evidence presented by the real life prosecution, leading to accusations that the movie was created as an advocacy piece in Spector's favor. Spector was not involved with the film, and according to his lawyer, \"certainly doesn't regard the film as an accurate portrayal of what went on because it's not. It has invented events.\" Although it is based on real people and an actual event, it opens with an unusually worded disclaimer that states \"This is a work of fiction. It's not 'based on a true story.' ... It is a drama inspired by actual persons on a trial, but it is neither an attempt to depict the actual persons, nor to comment upon the trial or its outcome.\"\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=August 2018}}\nSuffering from an illness eventually revealed to be [[pneumonia]], attorney Linda Kenney Baden ([[Helen Mirren]]) arrives at the law office of [[Bruce Cutler]] ([[Jeffrey Tambor]]) in [[Los Angeles]]. Cutler's law firm is providing the legal defense for [[music producer]] [[Phil Spector]] ([[Al Pacino]]), who is accused of murdering actress [[Lana Clarkson]] in his home on February 3, 2003, by firing a handgun into her mouth. Spector's defense is that Clarkson committed suicide, and he recently has switched attorneys and retained Cutler's firm.\n\nKenney Baden and Cutler argue the evidence for and against Spector. Kenney Baden believes that Spector is guilty and that a [[jury]] will convict him, citing the [[grand jury]] testimony of five women who claim Spector pulled a gun on them and demanded sex, outtakes from a television interview in which one of Spector's associates claims that Spector felt he needed to have a gun to keep women from leaving his home once he got them there, and a statement by Spector's chauffeur that Spector emerged from the house on the night of Clarkson's death and said he had killed somebody. Cutler says he believes Spector is innocent and offers the arguments in favor of Spector's acquittal. He says that Spector had overcome a drinking problem and been sober for ten years at the time of Clarkson's death, that an audio recording of Spector talking to police officers responding to the report of her death sounds to Cutler more like a man angry at her for killing herself in his house than someone who had just committed a murder, that the relatively small amount of blood found on Spector's clothes indicates Spector was 10 feet (3 meters) away from Clarkson and had made a defensive movement at the moment of the shooting, that the angle of the bullet's path is inconsistent with Spector firing it, and that ample evidence exists that Clarkson was depressed and may have been prone to suicide. Cutler also describes a major contention of the defense case, which is that the lack of a blood spatter on the wall behind Clarkson indicated that the bullet did not exit the back of her skull, meaning that the bullet fired into her mouth should have caused her blood and brain matter to exit explosively through her nose and mouth and cause a massive blood spatter on Spector's clothes if he was standing close enough to her to fire the bullet into her mouth, but there is no such blood stain on Spector's clothes. Cutler also suggests that a jury will be sympathetic to Spector because of his genius in producing popular music over the years, but Kenney Baden counters that younger people have no memory of the reclusive Spector or the era of his recordings and that his flamboyance and eccentricity will cause a jury to view him merely as a murderous \"freak.\" She also says that a jury will be disinclined to let another celebrity go free after the acquittals of [[O. J. Simpson]] and [[Michael Jackson]]. She believes that the only way to defend Spector will be to attack the sanity of Lana Clarkson in court, but she also believes that this strategy will be self-defeating, because it will make the jury sympathetic to Clarkson. Despite her belief in his guilt and misgivings about the strength of evidence for his acquittal, Kenney Baden agrees to take Spector's case, and Cutler begs her to find another way to defend him in court.\n\nIn her hotel room, Kenney Baden watches a television interview in which another Spector associate claims that Spector cannot distinguish sex from love, that Spector in his younger days was a powerful man who became accustomed to using that power to seduce many of the female recording artists for whom he produced music, and that later, as his career waned, Spector became obsessed with retaining his sexual power over women, even hiring [[private investigator]]s to follow his former wife, [[Ronnie Spector]] (Linda Miller), constantly. Kenney Baden discovers that Spector's father Ben had committed suicide by inhaling [[carbon monoxide]] in 1949 when Phil was ten years old. She visits Spector's home to gain firsthand knowledge of the scene of Clarkson's death and encounters Spector for the first time. He immediately launches into a lengthy, rambling monologue discussing what he views as his unfair treatment compared to that of other celebrities, the lack of public appreciation of his seminal role in the creation of the music industry and of his empowerment of [[African Americans|African American]] artists, and the importance of his work as a producer on a large number of popular songs, all the while dropping the names of celebrities he worked with or knew well. As he speaks he gives her a tour of his home, and she sees the room in which he kept a large collection of guns until the police confiscated them, as well as his large collection of wigs. Kenney Baden is cold, and Spector gets a blanket, which he drapes over her tenderly. Kenney Baden tries to focus him on the facts of the case against him, and, aware that he has spoken to the press and accused the prosecutor of [[Nazi]] tactics, asks him not to discuss his case with anyone. She asks him about Clarkson, and he says Clarkson was depressed and was drunk and on drugs when she allegedly killed herself. Kenney Baden says that [[toxicology]] reports do not support this contention, but Spector angrily rejects the findings of the reports. Spector asserts that the case against him is contrived to punish him for being too powerful and explains that he keeps to himself not because he is an unlikable eccentric, but merely because he craves privacy. He concludes by saying that he takes prescription drugs that make his hands shake too much for him to play the piano anymore, much less aim and fire a gun.\n\nDriving to Spector's [[arraignment]], Kenney Baden continues to search for a defense strategy, discussing the case with the Cutler firm's private investigator, Nick Stavros (John Pirruccello). Kenney Baden opines that the chauffeur's statement is the prosecution's only hard evidence, and that of her two options \u2013 putting Spector on the stand or breaking the chauffeur on the stand \u2013 only the latter is practicable. Stavros responds that he thinks that the police have threatened to charge the chauffeur as an [[accessory to murder]] for helping Spector get Clarkson to his house on the night of the shooting, and therefore the chauffeur probably will not break. While the prosecution makes its opening statement to the jury, Kenney Baden notes Spector scribbling musical notes on a pad of paper. Among a crowd of angry protesters outside the courthouse, one young woman hurls red liquid at Spector to symbolize Clarkson's blood.\n\nCutler's law firm lays out its case and the prosecution's case to a [[focus group]], which votes to convict Spector, and Cutler says it is because Spector is a wealthy figure without redeeming qualities who people of lesser means will be inclined to side against. The attorneys also view a television segment in which a younger Spector casually interrupts an interview at a recording studio to enter the studio with a gun and threaten the musicians, firing two shots into the ceiling, before returning to the interviewer. Cutler and Kenney Baden argue about the case, Cutler accusing her of working even though she is becoming too sick to work and suddenly becoming convinced of Spector's innocence because he gave her a blanket and won her over during her visit to his house. Cutler says that the prosecution will present [[ballistics]] evidence to counter theirs, and that the only way to win is to attack Clarkson, but Kenney Baden counters that the prosecution's case is in reality a retrial of O. J. Simpson and that the prosecution cannot prove Spector's guilt beyond a [[reasonable doubt]] thanks to the defense's argument about the lack of a large blood stain on Spector's clothes. She also says that the case is really about bias against \"freaks,\" that from her own childhood experiences she understands how unfair society is to unpopular people, and that Spector should not be convicted merely because of that bias, regardless of his past behaviors and transgressions. Her newfound commitment to Spector's defense and combative attitude quietly please Cutler.\n\nAnother focus group Kenney Baden and Cutler observe sees an interview with Spector in which he angrily asserts that the women who have accused him of pulling a gun on him are doing it merely to gain publicity for themselves and that the prosecution is simply trying to punish him for being \"the most successful music producer in the history of the world.\" He also expresses sorrow over Clarkson's emotional suffering and death, and proclaims his innocence. The focus group then sees video of the young woman throwing the red liquid at Spector outside the court house from 10 feet (3 meters) away while Spector assumes a defensive posture, hears the defense's contention that the amount and pattern of paint that spattered on his clothes mimics that of the blood on Spector's clothes after Clarkson's death, and sees an animation of the defense's theory that there should have been a much larger amount of blood on Spector's clothes if he had pulled the trigger. Kenney Baden later watches a video of an interview with Spector's ex-wife Ronnie Spector in which she asserts that the press's adulation of Spector during the period of his greatest professional success secretly tormented him because he wondered whether he deserved the adulation. In the hallway outside the Cutler firm's offices, Kenney Baden encounters a focus group member who says that the animations of how the bullet traveled and how the blood would have spattered are merely \"cartoons\" that prove nothing.\n\nKenney Baden arranges for, and witnesses, a live ballistics laboratory test that supports the defense's contention about the blood stain and further convinces her of Spector's innocence, and the Cutler firm hires a [[medical doctor]] to testify as an [[expert witness]] that Clarkson's gunshot wound was self-inflicted. Kenney Baden decides that a live demonstration in the courtroom similar to the laboratory experiment will convince the jury to acquit Spector. A court hearing determines, however, that the demonstration is inadmissible under the [[rules of evidence]] because it merely illustrates a theory. Informed of this, Spector angrily declares that it makes no sense that he would have thrown his life away over an actress working as a cocktail waitress just to demonstrate his \"power\" over women, laments that in earlier times the police simply would have accepted his explanation of her death and would not have arrested him, and demands to testify in his own defense at his trial. Kenney Baden tells him this would ensure his conviction and asks him what really happened on the night of Clarkson's death. He tells her that he was drunk and Clarkson was on drugs and alcohol when he brought her home and, after Clarkson asked to see his gun collection \u2013 which he says many women found exciting \u2013 he discovered her with the gun in her mouth. He says he shouted \"No!\" at Clarkson, startling her and causing her to flinch and accidentally pull the trigger. Kenney Baden arranges for another experiment which supports Spector's contention that startling someone in the manner Spector claims he did could cause that person to flinch and pull the trigger. Observing the experiment, Kenney Baden believes it is the key to Spector's acquittal. Cutler opposes the idea, saying that bringing into the courtroom the plastic skull used to model the defense's theory of how the bullet traveled will convince the jury that Spector is a monster, and that in any event under the rules of evidence Spector's version of events is not admissible unless he takes the stand and testifies about them. Cutler then turns the case over to Kenney Baden and leaves for [[New York City]], which angers Spector even though Kenny Baden reminds him he had agreed to Cutler's withdrawal in a court hearing. Spector says he did not understand the implications of the hearing and accuses Cutler of leaving just to star in a [[reality television]] show, saying he expected more loyalty out of Cutler.\n\nAfter he calms down, Spector expresses complete confidence in Kenney Baden's ability to defend him and agrees to testify in court. She stages a [[mock trial]] to prepare Spector for it. When the mock prosecutor ([[Chiwetel Ejiofor]]) asks about statements Ronnie Spector made, Spector flies into a rage, ending the mock trial with a lengthy rant about how cowardly and ungrateful Ronnie Spector is, how much she owes him, and how mistreated he has been all his life. Kenney Baden advises him that he cannot rant in the trial and must control his behavior, just as he does in other aspects of his life. He promises to be prepared, sober, and on his best behavior at his trial the next day because, although he does not care what anyone else in the court room thinks about him, he does care what Kenney Baden thinks. He thanks the mock trial participants for their help and Kenney Baden both for working to defend him even though she is sick and for being someone he can talk to. After Spector leaves, Kenney Baden tells Stavros that at the trial she plans to change Spector's image in the public eye from an \"oddity\" to a \"beloved eccentric\" who is an innocent man. At her hotel, Kenney Baden encounters a woman who criticizes her for defending a \"terrible man\" and asks her what she will do if Spector is acquitted and \"kills the next girl.\" Kenney Baden tells the woman that her husband is cheating on her, and when the woman says that it is not true, Kenney Baden replies that Spector, like the woman's husband, deserves the benefit of the doubt unless proven guilty.\n\nSpector's trial begins the next morning. He arrives at the court house wearing an outlandish wig which raises eyebrows among onlookers. When Kenney Baden criticizes his appearance, Spector claims it is an homage to [[Jimi Hendrix]], who \"suffered and was persecuted,\" and asks her to accept his expertise on costumes and how to put on a show, which she admits. He says he is ready to testify and, if asked, to explain his appearance in court as he did to her. As the trial begins, Kenney Baden crosses out all of her notes on what to ask Spector during his testimony, calls the medical doctor the Cutler firm hired as an expert witness to the stand instead of Spector, and quietly tells Spector that he might testify the next day, depending on how things go. In Cutler's law offices that evening, Kenney Baden watches television coverage of Spector's limousine arriving at his home. She asks Stavros, \"Why does the monster live in a castle?\" and \"Why does the [[Minotaur]] live in a cave?\" and tells Stavros the Minotaur does it to keep himself from doing harm. She also tells Stavros that she believes that Spector is innocent. When Stavros asks her if she is sure, she says, \"No, but I have a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nAs the film ends, text appears which reads, \"On September 26, the jury reported itself dead-locked, ten to two in favor of conviction, and incapable of reaching a decision. The Judge declared a mistrial. On October 3rd, the Prosecution announced that they would retry the case.

In Brown's view, the movie selectively included evidence supporting Spector's defense and glossed over or ignored prosecution evidence.<ref name=brown20130629/>  Specific examples of inaccuracies that Brown cites are:\n\n*The fictional Bruce Cutler's assertion at the beginning of the movie that a magazine article \u2013 a real-life article based on an interview Brown had with Spector in December 2002 \u2013 that appeared in the ''Telegraph'' magazine had been faxed to Spector on the day of the shooting and had \"set him off\" is incorrect.<ref name=brown20130629/>  The article was not published until after Clarkson's death.<ref name=brown20130629/> \n*The fictional Cutler's assertion in the film that Spector had been \"cold sober\" for ten years prior to Clarkson's death is incorrect.<ref name=brown20130629/>  Spector began drinking again two months before her death.<ref name=brown20130629/> \n*The fictional Linda Kenney Baden declares in the film that she will not \"attack the girl,\" i.e., Clarkson, in court to defend Spector.<ref name=brown20130629/>  In fact, Kenney Baden's defense of Spector did include attacking Clarkson in court,<ref name=brown20130629/> and the real Kenney Baden showed a video of Clarkson in [[blackface]] imitating [[Little Richard]] during the trial, unlike the fictional Kenney Baden, who rejects it.<ref name=brown20130629/> \n*The film emphasizes the defense's real-life argument about how Spector pulling the trigger in Clarkson's mouth would have created a massive blood spatter on his clothes and that no such blood stain occurred, and this was a major part of Kenney Baden's defense. However, the movie ignores the prosecution's ballistics evidence that Spector pulling the trigger at arm's length would instead have resulted in a misting pattern of blood stains that was found on both Spector's and Clarkson's clothes, consistent with Spector pulling the trigger.<ref name=brown20130629/>\n*In real life, the defense countered the prosecution's evidence that Spector told his chauffeur that he had just killed somebody by arguing that the chauffeur simply misheard Spector. In the movie, the Nick Stavros character introduces a fictitious theory that corrupt detectives were coercing the chauffeur into his testimony about Spector's statement, but in real life the chauffeur never wavered in his statements about what Spector said.<ref name=brown20130629/>\n*Brown claims that the film's depiction of Spector's arrival at his trial in an outlandish wig is a \"distortion,\" but he declines to give a reason for this opinion.<ref name=brown20130629/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film has received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics.

The film is based on the murder trials of [[music producer]], songwriter and musician [[Phil Spector]] and was released in the [[United States]] by [[HBO Films]], premiering on [[HBO]] on March 24, 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Al Pacino's Phil Spector moment: HBO's film still deconstructed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2013/feb/05/al-pacino-phil-spector-film|accessdate=March 10, 2013|newspaper=guardian.co.uk|date=February 5, 2013}}</ref> It stars [[Al Pacino]] as [[Phil Spector]], [[Helen Mirren]] as defense attorney Linda Kenney Baden, and [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as defense attorney [[Bruce Cutler]]. It focuses primarily on the relationship between Phil Spector and Linda Kenney Baden, his defense attorney in 2007 during the first of his two murder trials for the 2003 death of [[Lana Clarkson]] in his California mansion, and is billed as \u201can exploration of the client-attorney relationship\u201d between Spector and Kenney Baden.<ref name=brown20130629>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10148042/David-Mamet-on-Phil-Spector-I-dont-give-a-damn-about-the-facts.html Brown, Mick, \"David Mamet on Phil Spector: 'I don't give a damn about the facts',\" telegraph.co.uk, June 29, 2013, 8:00 a.m. BST. Retrieved June 24, 2018]</ref>\n\nThe film was controversial for fictionalizing aspects of the case and for neglecting significant evidence presented by the real life prosecution, leading to accusations that the movie was created as an advocacy piece in Spector's favor. Spector was not involved with the film, and according to his lawyer, \"certainly doesn't regard the film as an accurate portrayal of what went on because it's not. It has invented events.\" Although it is based on real people and an actual event, it opens with an unusually worded disclaimer that states \"This is a work of fiction. It's not 'based on a true story.' ... It is a drama inspired by actual persons on a trial, but it is neither an attempt to depict the actual persons, nor to comment upon the trial or its outcome.\"\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=August 2018}}\nSuffering from an illness eventually revealed to be [[pneumonia]], attorney Linda Kenney Baden ([[Helen Mirren]]) arrives at the law office of [[Bruce Cutler]] ([[Jeffrey Tambor]]) in [[Los Angeles]]. Cutler's law firm is providing the legal defense for [[music producer]] [[Phil Spector]] ([[Al Pacino]]), who is accused of murdering actress [[Lana Clarkson]] in his home on February 3, 2003, by firing a handgun into her mouth. Spector's defense is that Clarkson committed suicide, and he recently has switched attorneys and retained Cutler's firm.\n\nKenney Baden and Cutler argue the evidence for and against Spector. Kenney Baden believes that Spector is guilty and that a [[jury]] will convict him, citing the [[grand jury]] testimony of five women who claim Spector pulled a gun on them and demanded sex, outtakes from a television interview in which one of Spector's associates claims that Spector felt he needed to have a gun to keep women from leaving his home once he got them there, and a statement by Spector's chauffeur that Spector emerged from the house on the night of Clarkson's death and said he had killed somebody. Cutler says he believes Spector is innocent and offers the arguments in favor of Spector's acquittal. He says that Spector had overcome a drinking problem and been sober for ten years at the time of Clarkson's death, that an audio recording of Spector talking to police officers responding to the report of her death sounds to Cutler more like a man angry at her for killing herself in his house than someone who had just committed a murder, that the relatively small amount of blood found on Spector's clothes indicates Spector was 10 feet (3 meters) away from Clarkson and had made a defensive movement at the moment of the shooting, that the angle of the bullet's path is inconsistent with Spector firing it, and that ample evidence exists that Clarkson was depressed and may have been prone to suicide. Cutler also describes a major contention of the defense case, which is that the lack of a blood spatter on the wall behind Clarkson indicated that the bullet did not exit the back of her skull, meaning that the bullet fired into her mouth should have caused her blood and brain matter to exit explosively through her nose and mouth and cause a massive blood spatter on Spector's clothes if he was standing close enough to her to fire the bullet into her mouth, but there is no such blood stain on Spector's clothes. Cutler also suggests that a jury will be sympathetic to Spector because of his genius in producing popular music over the years, but Kenney Baden counters that younger people have no memory of the reclusive Spector or the era of his recordings and that his flamboyance and eccentricity will cause a jury to view him merely as a murderous \"freak.\" She also says that a jury will be disinclined to let another celebrity go free after the acquittals of [[O. J. Simpson]] and [[Michael Jackson]]. She believes that the only way to defend Spector will be to attack the sanity of Lana Clarkson in court, but she also believes that this strategy will be self-defeating, because it will make the jury sympathetic to Clarkson. Despite her belief in his guilt and misgivings about the strength of evidence for his acquittal, Kenney Baden agrees to take Spector's case, and Cutler begs her to find another way to defend him in court.\n\nIn her hotel room, Kenney Baden watches a television interview in which another Spector associate claims that Spector cannot distinguish sex from love, that Spector in his younger days was a powerful man who became accustomed to using that power to seduce many of the female recording artists for whom he produced music, and that later, as his career waned, Spector became obsessed with retaining his sexual power over women, even hiring [[private investigator]]s to follow his former wife, [[Ronnie Spector]] (Linda Miller), constantly. Kenney Baden discovers that Spector's father Ben had committed suicide by inhaling [[carbon monoxide]] in 1949 when Phil was ten years old. She visits Spector's home to gain firsthand knowledge of the scene of Clarkson's death and encounters Spector for the first time. He immediately launches into a lengthy, rambling monologue discussing what he views as his unfair treatment compared to that of other celebrities, the lack of public appreciation of his seminal role in the creation of the music industry and of his empowerment of [[African Americans|African American]] artists, and the importance of his work as a producer on a large number of popular songs, all the while dropping the names of celebrities he worked with or knew well. As he speaks he gives her a tour of his home, and she sees the room in which he kept a large collection of guns until the police confiscated them, as well as his large collection of wigs. Kenney Baden is cold, and Spector gets a blanket, which he drapes over her tenderly. Kenney Baden tries to focus him on the facts of the case against him, and, aware that he has spoken to the press and accused the prosecutor of [[Nazi]] tactics, asks him not to discuss his case with anyone. She asks him about Clarkson, and he says Clarkson was depressed and was drunk and on drugs when she allegedly killed herself. Kenney Baden says that [[toxicology]] reports do not support this contention, but Spector angrily rejects the findings of the reports. Spector asserts that the case against him is contrived to punish him for being too powerful and explains that he keeps to himself not because he is an unlikable eccentric, but merely because he craves privacy. He concludes by saying that he takes prescription drugs that make his hands shake too much for him to play the piano anymore, much less aim and fire a gun.\n\nDriving to Spector's [[arraignment]], Kenney Baden continues to search for a defense strategy, discussing the case with the Cutler firm's private investigator, Nick Stavros (John Pirruccello). Kenney Baden opines that the chauffeur's statement is the prosecution's only hard evidence, and that of her two options \u2013 putting Spector on the stand or breaking the chauffeur on the stand \u2013 only the latter is practicable. Stavros responds that he thinks that the police have threatened to charge the chauffeur as an [[accessory to murder]] for helping Spector get Clarkson to his house on the night of the shooting, and therefore the chauffeur probably will not break. While the prosecution makes its opening statement to the jury, Kenney Baden notes Spector scribbling musical notes on a pad of paper. Among a crowd of angry protesters outside the courthouse, one young woman hurls red liquid at Spector to symbolize Clarkson's blood.\n\nCutler's law firm lays out its case and the prosecution's case to a [[focus group]], which votes to convict Spector, and Cutler says it is because Spector is a wealthy figure without redeeming qualities who people of lesser means will be inclined to side against. The attorneys also view a television segment in which a younger Spector casually interrupts an interview at a recording studio to enter the studio with a gun and threaten the musicians, firing two shots into the ceiling, before returning to the interviewer. Cutler and Kenney Baden argue about the case, Cutler accusing her of working even though she is becoming too sick to work and suddenly becoming convinced of Spector's innocence because he gave her a blanket and won her over during her visit to his house. Cutler says that the prosecution will present [[ballistics]] evidence to counter theirs, and that the only way to win is to attack Clarkson, but Kenney Baden counters that the prosecution's case is in reality a retrial of O. J. Simpson and that the prosecution cannot prove Spector's guilt beyond a [[reasonable doubt]] thanks to the defense's argument about the lack of a large blood stain on Spector's clothes. She also says that the case is really about bias against \"freaks,\" that from her own childhood experiences she understands how unfair society is to unpopular people, and that Spector should not be convicted merely because of that bias, regardless of his past behaviors and transgressions. Her newfound commitment to Spector's defense and combative attitude quietly please Cutler.\n\nAnother focus group Kenney Baden and Cutler observe sees an interview with Spector in which he angrily asserts that the women who have accused him of pulling a gun on him are doing it merely to gain publicity for themselves and that the prosecution is simply trying to punish him for being \"the most successful music producer in the history of the world.\" He also expresses sorrow over Clarkson's emotional suffering and death, and proclaims his innocence. The focus group then sees video of the young woman throwing the red liquid at Spector outside the court house from 10 feet (3 meters) away while Spector assumes a defensive posture, hears the defense's contention that the amount and pattern of paint that spattered on his clothes mimics that of the blood on Spector's clothes after Clarkson's death, and sees an animation of the defense's theory that there should have been a much larger amount of blood on Spector's clothes if he had pulled the trigger. Kenney Baden later watches a video of an interview with Spector's ex-wife Ronnie Spector in which she asserts that the press's adulation of Spector during the period of his greatest professional success secretly tormented him because he wondered whether he deserved the adulation. In the hallway outside the Cutler firm's offices, Kenney Baden encounters a focus group member who says that the animations of how the bullet traveled and how the blood would have spattered are merely \"cartoons\" that prove nothing.\n\nKenney Baden arranges for, and witnesses, a live ballistics laboratory test that supports the defense's contention about the blood stain and further convinces her of Spector's innocence, and the Cutler firm hires a [[medical doctor]] to testify as an [[expert witness]] that Clarkson's gunshot wound was self-inflicted. Kenney Baden decides that a live demonstration in the courtroom similar to the laboratory experiment will convince the jury to acquit Spector. A court hearing determines, however, that the demonstration is inadmissible under the [[rules of evidence]] because it merely illustrates a theory. Informed of this, Spector angrily declares that it makes no sense that he would have thrown his life away over an actress working as a cocktail waitress just to demonstrate his \"power\" over women, laments that in earlier times the police simply would have accepted his explanation of her death and would not have arrested him, and demands to testify in his own defense at his trial. Kenney Baden tells him this would ensure his conviction and asks him what really happened on the night of Clarkson's death. He tells her that he was drunk and Clarkson was on drugs and alcohol when he brought her home and, after Clarkson asked to see his gun collection \u2013 which he says many women found exciting \u2013 he discovered her with the gun in her mouth. He says he shouted \"No!\" at Clarkson, startling her and causing her to flinch and accidentally pull the trigger. Kenney Baden arranges for another experiment which supports Spector's contention that startling someone in the manner Spector claims he did could cause that person to flinch and pull the trigger. Observing the experiment, Kenney Baden believes it is the key to Spector's acquittal. Cutler opposes the idea, saying that bringing into the courtroom the plastic skull used to model the defense's theory of how the bullet traveled will convince the jury that Spector is a monster, and that in any event under the rules of evidence Spector's version of events is not admissible unless he takes the stand and testifies about them. Cutler then turns the case over to Kenney Baden and leaves for [[New York City]], which angers Spector even though Kenny Baden reminds him he had agreed to Cutler's withdrawal in a court hearing. Spector says he did not understand the implications of the hearing and accuses Cutler of leaving just to star in a [[reality television]] show, saying he expected more loyalty out of Cutler.\n\nAfter he calms down, Spector expresses complete confidence in Kenney Baden's ability to defend him and agrees to testify in court. She stages a [[mock trial]] to prepare Spector for it. When the mock prosecutor ([[Chiwetel Ejiofor]]) asks about statements Ronnie Spector made, Spector flies into a rage, ending the mock trial with a lengthy rant about how cowardly and ungrateful Ronnie Spector is, how much she owes him, and how mistreated he has been all his life. Kenney Baden advises him that he cannot rant in the trial and must control his behavior, just as he does in other aspects of his life. He promises to be prepared, sober, and on his best behavior at his trial the next day because, although he does not care what anyone else in the court room thinks about him, he does care what Kenney Baden thinks. He thanks the mock trial participants for their help and Kenney Baden both for working to defend him even though she is sick and for being someone he can talk to. After Spector leaves, Kenney Baden tells Stavros that at the trial she plans to change Spector's image in the public eye from an \"oddity\" to a \"beloved eccentric\" who is an innocent man. At her hotel, Kenney Baden encounters a woman who criticizes her for defending a \"terrible man\" and asks her what she will do if Spector is acquitted and \"kills the next girl.\" Kenney Baden tells the woman that her husband is cheating on her, and when the woman says that it is not true, Kenney Baden replies that Spector, like the woman's husband, deserves the benefit of the doubt unless proven guilty.\n\nSpector's trial begins the next morning. He arrives at the court house wearing an outlandish wig which raises eyebrows among onlookers. When Kenney Baden criticizes his appearance, Spector claims it is an homage to [[Jimi Hendrix]], who \"suffered and was persecuted,\" and asks her to accept his expertise on costumes and how to put on a show, which she admits. He says he is ready to testify and, if asked, to explain his appearance in court as he did to her. As the trial begins, Kenney Baden crosses out all of her notes on what to ask Spector during his testimony, calls the medical doctor the Cutler firm hired as an expert witness to the stand instead of Spector, and quietly tells Spector that he might testify the next day, depending on how things go. In Cutler's law offices that evening, Kenney Baden watches television coverage of Spector's limousine arriving at his home. She asks Stavros, \"Why does the monster live in a castle?\" and \"Why does the [[Minotaur]] live in a cave?\" and tells Stavros the Minotaur does it to keep himself from doing harm. She also tells Stavros that she believes that Spector is innocent. When Stavros asks her if she is sure, she says, \"No, but I have a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nAs the film ends, text appears which reads, \"On September 26, the jury reported itself dead-locked, ten to two in favor of conviction, and incapable of reaching a decision. The Judge declared a mistrial. On October 3rd, the Prosecution announced that they would retry the case. Due to her illness, Linda Kenney Baden was unable to participate in the second trial, whose jury, on April 13th, 2009, found Phil Spector guilty of [[Second-degree murder|Second Degree Murder]] and sentenced him to nineteen years to life in [[California State Prison, Corcoran]] where he resides today.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Phil Spector]]\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as Linda Kenney Baden\n* [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as Mock Prosecutor\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as [[Bruce Cutler]]\n*John Pirruccello as Nick Stavros\n* [[Clara Mamet]] as Paint Girl\n* [[James Tolkan]] as Larry Fidler\n* [[Natalia Nogulich]] as Giovonetta Ricci\n* Matthew Rauch as Mike\n* [[Linda Miller (actress)|Linda Miller]] as [[Ronnie Spector]]\n* [[Rebecca Pidgeon]] as Dr. Fallon (and also sings \"[[Spanish Harlem (song)|Spanish Harlem]]\" over the closing credits)\n* [[George Aguilar]] as Mr. Spector's driver\n\n==Production==\n\n===Script===\n\nIn an interview in 2013, ''Phil Spector''\u2032s writer and director, [[David Mamet]], explained that, although he enjoyed Phil Spector's music, he knew nothing about Spector and paid little attention to the murder case against him until 2010, the year after Spector's conviction for murder in his second trial, when he viewed [[Vikram Jayanti]]\u2032s 2009 [[BBC]] documentary ''[[The Agony and the Ecstasy of Phil Spector]]''.<ref name=brown20130629/> The documentary included a compelling interview with Spector that took place just before his first trial in 2007 and news footage of the trial itself,<ref name=brown20130629/> and Jayanti said he intended it to leave the audience with the impression that the charges against Spector were unproved.<ref name=brown20130629/> Mamet said that the documentary gave him an idea to dramatize the story of Spector's first trial by depicting Spector as \u201ca mythological character\"<ref name=brown20130629/> and \"a man avowed by all to be a monster\"<ref name=brown20130629/> like \"the [[Minotaur]].\u201d<ref name=brown20130629/> Mamet also said he found it challenging \u201cto take an irrefutable proposition \u2013 the guy\u2032s obviously guilty \u2013 and see if I could refute it\u201d<ref name=brown20130629/> by writing a drama about Spector's case.

In Brown's view, the movie selectively included evidence supporting Spector's defense and glossed over or ignored prosecution evidence.<ref name=brown20130629/>  Specific examples of inaccuracies that Brown cites are:\n\n*The fictional Bruce Cutler's assertion at the beginning of the movie that a magazine article \u2013 a real-life article based on an interview Brown had with Spector in December 2002 \u2013 that appeared in the ''Telegraph'' magazine had been faxed to Spector on the day of the shooting and had \"set him off\" is incorrect.<ref name=brown20130629/>  The article was not published until after Clarkson's death.<ref name=brown20130629/> \n*The fictional Cutler's assertion in the film that Spector had been \"cold sober\" for ten years prior to Clarkson's death is incorrect.<ref name=brown20130629/>  Spector began drinking again two months before her death.<ref name=brown20130629/> \n*The fictional Linda Kenney Baden declares in the film that she will not \"attack the girl,\" i.e., Clarkson, in court to defend Spector.<ref name=brown20130629/>  In fact, Kenney Baden's defense of Spector did include attacking Clarkson in court,<ref name=brown20130629/> and the real Kenney Baden showed a video of Clarkson in [[blackface]] imitating [[Little Richard]] during the trial, unlike the fictional Kenney Baden, who rejects it.<ref name=brown20130629/> \n*The film emphasizes the defense's real-life argument about how Spector pulling the trigger in Clarkson's mouth would have created a massive blood spatter on his clothes and that no such blood stain occurred, and this was a major part of Kenney Baden's defense. However, the movie ignores the prosecution's ballistics evidence that Spector pulling the trigger at arm's length would instead have resulted in a misting pattern of blood stains that was found on both Spector's and Clarkson's clothes, consistent with Spector pulling the trigger.<ref name=brown20130629/>\n*In real life, the defense countered the prosecution's evidence that Spector told his chauffeur that he had just killed somebody by arguing that the chauffeur simply misheard Spector. In the movie, the Nick Stavros character introduces a fictitious theory that corrupt detectives were coercing the chauffeur into his testimony about Spector's statement, but in real life the chauffeur never wavered in his statements about what Spector said.<ref name=brown20130629/>\n*Brown claims that the film's depiction of Spector's arrival at his trial in an outlandish wig is a \"distortion,\" but he declines to give a reason for this opinion.<ref name=brown20130629/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film has received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator site [[Metacritic]] has given the film a score of 60 out of 100, signifying \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/phil-spector |title=Phil Spector - Season 1 Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |date=2013-03-24 |accessdate=2017-05-12}}</ref>\n\nIn his June 2013 article in ''The Telegraph'', Mick Brown wrote that \"''Phil Spector'' is a masterfully executed piece of drama. The dialogue crackles in vintage Mamet fashion, and the performances are uniformly excellent.

And see, the point of the legal system is that nobody has any idea. That\u2019s why the opposite of a guilty verdict is not 'innocent,' it\u2019s 'not guilty.'

M\u0101ori originated with settlers from eastern [[Polynesia]], who arrived in New Zealand in several waves of {{lang|mi|[[Waka (canoe)|waka]]}} (canoe) voyages roughly between 1320 and 1350.<ref name=\"Walters et al (2017)\">{{Cite journal | last1=Walters | first1=Richard | last2=Buckley | first2=Hallie|last3=Jacomb|first3=Chris|last4=Matisoo-Smith|first4=Elizabeth|title=Mass Migration and the Polynesian Settlement of New Zealand|journal=Journal of World Prehistory|volume=30| issue=4 |pages=351\u2013376|doi=10.1007/s10963-017-9110-y|date=7 October 2017}}</ref> Over several centuries in isolation, these settlers developed [[M\u0101ori culture|their own distinctive culture]], whose language, mythology, crafts and performing arts evolved independently from other eastern Polynesian cultures.\n\nThe arrival of Europeans in New Zealand, starting in the 17th century, brought enormous changes to the M\u0101ori way of life. M\u0101ori people gradually adopted many aspects of Western society and culture. Initial relations between M\u0101ori and Europeans were largely amicable, and with the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in 1840, the two cultures coexisted. Rising tensions over disputed land sales led to conflict in the 1860s, and massive land confiscations. Social upheaval, and epidemics of introduced disease took a devastating toll on the M\u0101ori population, which fell dramatically. By the start of the 20th century, the M\u0101ori population had begun to recover, and efforts have been made to increase their standing in wider New Zealand society and achieve social justice.\n\nTraditional M\u0101ori culture has thereby enjoyed a significant revival, which was further bolstered by a [[M\u0101ori protest movement]] that emerged in the 1960s. However, disproportionate numbers of M\u0101ori face significant economic and social obstacles, and generally have lower life expectancies and incomes compared with other New Zealand ethnic groups. They suffer higher levels of crime, health problems, and educational under-achievement. A number of socioeconomic initiatives have been instigated with the aim of \"closing the gap\" between M\u0101ori and other New Zealanders. Political and economic redress for historical grievances is also ongoing (see [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements]]).\n\nIn the [[2018 New Zealand census|2018 census]], there were 775,836 people in New Zealand identifying as M\u0101ori, making up 16.5 per cent of the national population. They are the second-largest ethnic group in New Zealand, after European New Zealanders (\"{{lang|mi|[[P\u0101keh\u0101]]}}\"). In addition, more than 140,000 M\u0101ori live in Australia. The [[M\u0101ori language]] is spoken to some extent by about a fifth of all M\u0101ori, representing 3 per cent of the total population. M\u0101ori are active in all spheres of New Zealand culture and society, with independent representation in areas such as media, politics and sport.\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn the [[M\u0101ori language]], the word {{Lang|mi|m\u0101ori}} means \"normal\", \"natural\" or \"ordinary\". In legends and oral traditions, the word distinguished ordinary mortal human beings\u2014{{Lang|mi|t\u0101ngata m\u0101ori}}\u2014from [[M\u0101ori religion|deities]] and spirits ({{Lang|mi|wairua}}).<ref>Atkinson, A.

Social groups were tribal, with no unified society or single M\u0101ori identity until after the arrival of Europeans. Nevertheless, common elements could be found in all M\u0101ori groups in pre-European New Zealand, including a shared Polynesian heritage, a common basic language, familial associations, traditions of warfare, and similar mythologies and religious beliefs.<ref>King (1996), pp 37, 43</ref>\n\nMost M\u0101ori lived in villages, which were inhabited by several {{lang|mi|[[wh\u0101nau]]}} (extended families) who collectively formed a {{lang|mi|[[hap\u016b]]}} (clan or subtribe). Members of a {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} cooperated with food production, gathering resources, raising families and defence. M\u0101ori society across New Zealand was broadly stratified into three classes of people: {{lang|mi|[[rangatira]]}}, chiefs and ruling families; {{lang|mi|t\u016bt\u016b\u0101}}, commoners; and {{lang|mi|m\u014dkai}}, slaves. {{lang|mi|[[Tohunga]]}} also held special standing in their communities as specialists of revered arts, skills and esoteric knowledge.<ref name=King-p42p43>King (1996), pp 42\u20133</ref><ref name=TeAra-Taonui>{{cite web |last=Taonui |first=R\u0101wiri |title=Tribal organisation |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/tribal-organisation |date=4 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nShared ancestry, intermarriage and trade strengthened relationships between different groups. Many {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} with mutually-recognised shared ancestry formed {{lang|mi|[[iwi]]}}, or tribes, which were the largest social unit in M\u0101ori society. {{lang|mi|Hap\u016b}} and {{lang|mi|iwi}} often united for expeditions to gather food and resources, or in times of conflict. In contrast, warfare developed as an integral part of traditional life, as different groups competed for food and resources, settled personal disputes, and sought to increase their prestige and authority.<ref name=King-p42p43/>\n\n[[File:Famille Maori 1998-1361-139.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=M\u0101ori wh\u0101nau from Rotorua in the 1880s|M\u0101ori wh\u0101nau from [[Rotorua]] in the 1880s. Many aspects of Western life and culture, including European clothing and architecture, became incorporated into M\u0101ori society during the 19th century.]]\nEarly European settlers introduced tools, weapons, clothing and foods to M\u0101ori across New Zealand, in exchange for resources, land and labour. M\u0101ori began selectively adopting elements of Western society during the 19th century, including European clothing and food, and later Western education, religion and architecture.<ref>King (1996), pp 46\u20137, 73\u20135</ref> However, as the 19th century wore on, relations between European colonial settlers and different M\u0101ori groups became increasingly strained. Tensions led to widespread conflict in the 1860s, and the [[New Zealand land confiscations|confiscation of millions of acres of M\u0101ori land]]. Significant amounts of land were also purchased by the colonial government and later through the [[Native Land Court]].\n\n==== 20th century ====\nBy the start of the 20th century, a greater awareness had emerged of a unified M\u0101ori identity, particularly in comparison to P\u0101keh\u0101, who now overwhelmingly outnumbered the M\u0101ori as a whole. M\u0101ori and P\u0101keh\u0101 societies remained largely separate\u2014socially, culturally, economically and geographically\u2014for much of the 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref>King (1996), pp 195\u20136</ref> The key reason for this was that M\u0101ori remained almost exclusively a rural population, whereas increasingly the European population was urban especially after 1900. Nevertheless, M\u0101ori groups continued to engage with the government and in legal processes to increase their standing in (and ultimately further their incorporation into) wider New Zealand society.<ref>Hill (2009), pp 519\u201329</ref> The main point of contact with the government were the four M\u0101ori Members of Parliament.\n\nMany M\u0101ori [[urbanisation|migrated to larger rural towns and cities]] during the Depression and post-WWII periods in search of employment, leaving rural communities depleted and disconnecting many urban M\u0101ori from their traditional social controls and tribal homelands. Yet while standards of living improved among M\u0101ori, they continued to lag behind P\u0101keh\u0101 in areas such as health, income, skilled employment and access to higher levels of education. M\u0101ori leaders and government policymakers alike struggled to deal with [[social issues]] stemming from increased urban migration, including a shortage of housing and jobs, and a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems.<ref name=\"Sorrenson 1997, pp 339\u201341\">Sorrenson (1997), pp 339\u201341</ref>\n\nIn regards to housing, a 1961 census revealed significant differences in the living conditions of M\u0101ori and Europeans. That year, out of all the (unshared) non-M\u0101ori private dwellings in New Zealand, 96.8 per cent had a bath or shower, 94.1 per cent a hot water service, 88.7 per cent a flush toilet, 81.6 per cent a refrigerator, and 78.6 per cent an electric washing machine. By contrast, for all (unshared) M\u0101ori private dwellings that same year, 76.8 per cent had a bath or shower, 68.9 per cent a hot water service, 55.8 per cent a refrigerator, 54.1 per cent a flush toilet, and 47 per cent an electric washing machine.<ref>The Quest for security in New Zealand 1840 to 1966 by William Ball Sutch</ref>\n\nWhile the arrival of Europeans had a profound impact on the M\u0101ori way of life, many aspects of traditional society have survived into the 21st century. M\u0101ori participate fully in all spheres of New Zealand culture and society, leading largely Western lifestyles while also maintaining their own cultural and social customs. The traditional social strata of {{lang|mi|rangatira}}, {{lang|mi|t\u016bt\u016b\u0101}} and {{lang|mi|m\u014dkai}} have all but disappeared from M\u0101ori society, while the roles of {{lang|mi|tohunga}} and {{lang|mi|[[kaum\u0101tua]]}} are still present.

M\u0101ori advocates continue to push for further redress claiming that their concerns are being marginalised or ignored. A 2007 [[Department of Corrections (New Zealand)|Department of Corrections]] report found that M\u0101ori are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system not only because they commit more crimes but also because they face prejudice at many levels: \"a number of studies have shown evidence of greater likelihood, associated only with ethnicity, for M\u0101ori offenders to have police contact, be charged, lack legal representation, not be granted bail, plead guilty, be convicted, be sentenced to non-monetary penalties, and be denied release to Home Detention\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Over-representation of M\u0101ori in the criminal justice system: An exploratory report |author=Policy, Strategy and Research Group, Department of Corrections |publisher=[[Department of Corrections (New Zealand)]] |url=http://www.corrections.govt.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/672574/Over-representation-of-Maori-in-the-criminal-justice-system.pdf |date=September 2007 |accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref> Conversely, critics denounce the scale of assistance given to M\u0101ori as amounting to preferential treatment for a select group of people based on race.<ref name=\"WaitangiDebateTVNZ\">{{cite news|title=The Treaty of Waitangi debate|publisher=TVNZ|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/The-Treaty-of-Waitangi-debate/tabid/1348/articleID/229627/Default.aspx|date=15 October 2011|accessdate=15 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301131125/http://www.3news.co.nz/The-Treaty-of-Waitangi-debate/tabid/1348/articleID/229627/Default.aspx|archivedate=1 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Both sentiments were highlighted during the [[New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy|foreshore and seabed controversy]] in 2004, in which the New Zealand government claimed sole ownership of the New Zealand foreshore and seabed, over the objections of M\u0101ori groups who were seeking customary title.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Ford, Chris |title=Race relations in New Zealand|magazine=[[Global Politician]] |url=http://www.globalpolitician.com/21740-race-new-zealand |date=24 April 2006 |accessdate=27 November 2010}}</ref><!--Better reference needed-->\n\n== Commerce ==\n{{seealso|Cultural appropriation}}\nWider commercial exposure has increased public awareness of the M\u0101ori culture, but has also resulted in several legal disputes.

The [[M\u0101ori King Movement]] originated in the 1860s as an attempt by several {{lang|mi|iwi}} to unify under one leader: in modern times, it serves a largely ceremonial role.

M\u0101ori people gradually adopted many aspects of Western society and culture. Initial relations between M\u0101ori and Europeans were largely amicable, and with the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in 1840, the two cultures coexisted. Rising tensions over disputed land sales led to conflict in the 1860s, and massive land confiscations. Social upheaval, and epidemics of introduced disease took a devastating toll on the M\u0101ori population, which fell dramatically. By the start of the 20th century, the M\u0101ori population had begun to recover, and efforts have been made to increase their standing in wider New Zealand society and achieve social justice.\n\nTraditional M\u0101ori culture has thereby enjoyed a significant revival, which was further bolstered by a [[M\u0101ori protest movement]] that emerged in the 1960s. However, disproportionate numbers of M\u0101ori face significant economic and social obstacles, and generally have lower life expectancies and incomes compared with other New Zealand ethnic groups. They suffer higher levels of crime, health problems, and educational under-achievement. A number of socioeconomic initiatives have been instigated with the aim of \"closing the gap\" between M\u0101ori and other New Zealanders. Political and economic redress for historical grievances is also ongoing (see [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements]]).\n\nIn the [[2018 New Zealand census|2018 census]], there were 775,836 people in New Zealand identifying as M\u0101ori, making up 16.5 per cent of the national population. They are the second-largest ethnic group in New Zealand, after European New Zealanders (\"{{lang|mi|[[P\u0101keh\u0101]]}}\"). In addition, more than 140,000 M\u0101ori live in Australia. The [[M\u0101ori language]] is spoken to some extent by about a fifth of all M\u0101ori, representing 3 per cent of the total population. M\u0101ori are active in all spheres of New Zealand culture and society, with independent representation in areas such as media, politics and sport.\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn the [[M\u0101ori language]], the word {{Lang|mi|m\u0101ori}} means \"normal\", \"natural\" or \"ordinary\". In legends and oral traditions, the word distinguished ordinary mortal human beings\u2014{{Lang|mi|t\u0101ngata m\u0101ori}}\u2014from [[M\u0101ori religion|deities]] and spirits ({{Lang|mi|wairua}}).<ref>Atkinson, A.

Social groups were tribal, with no unified society or single M\u0101ori identity until after the arrival of Europeans. Nevertheless, common elements could be found in all M\u0101ori groups in pre-European New Zealand, including a shared Polynesian heritage, a common basic language, familial associations, traditions of warfare, and similar mythologies and religious beliefs.<ref>King (1996), pp 37, 43</ref>\n\nMost M\u0101ori lived in villages, which were inhabited by several {{lang|mi|[[wh\u0101nau]]}} (extended families) who collectively formed a {{lang|mi|[[hap\u016b]]}} (clan or subtribe). Members of a {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} cooperated with food production, gathering resources, raising families and defence. M\u0101ori society across New Zealand was broadly stratified into three classes of people: {{lang|mi|[[rangatira]]}}, chiefs and ruling families; {{lang|mi|t\u016bt\u016b\u0101}}, commoners; and {{lang|mi|m\u014dkai}}, slaves. {{lang|mi|[[Tohunga]]}} also held special standing in their communities as specialists of revered arts, skills and esoteric knowledge.<ref name=King-p42p43>King (1996), pp 42\u20133</ref><ref name=TeAra-Taonui>{{cite web |last=Taonui |first=R\u0101wiri |title=Tribal organisation |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/tribal-organisation |date=4 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nShared ancestry, intermarriage and trade strengthened relationships between different groups. Many {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} with mutually-recognised shared ancestry formed {{lang|mi|[[iwi]]}}, or tribes, which were the largest social unit in M\u0101ori society. {{lang|mi|Hap\u016b}} and {{lang|mi|iwi}} often united for expeditions to gather food and resources, or in times of conflict. In contrast, warfare developed as an integral part of traditional life, as different groups competed for food and resources, settled personal disputes, and sought to increase their prestige and authority.<ref name=King-p42p43/>\n\n[[File:Famille Maori 1998-1361-139.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=M\u0101ori wh\u0101nau from Rotorua in the 1880s|M\u0101ori wh\u0101nau from [[Rotorua]] in the 1880s. Many aspects of Western life and culture, including European clothing and architecture, became incorporated into M\u0101ori society during the 19th century.]]\nEarly European settlers introduced tools, weapons, clothing and foods to M\u0101ori across New Zealand, in exchange for resources, land and labour. M\u0101ori began selectively adopting elements of Western society during the 19th century, including European clothing and food, and later Western education, religion and architecture.<ref>King (1996), pp 46\u20137, 73\u20135</ref> However, as the 19th century wore on, relations between European colonial settlers and different M\u0101ori groups became increasingly strained. Tensions led to widespread conflict in the 1860s, and the [[New Zealand land confiscations|confiscation of millions of acres of M\u0101ori land]]. Significant amounts of land were also purchased by the colonial government and later through the [[Native Land Court]].\n\n==== 20th century ====\nBy the start of the 20th century, a greater awareness had emerged of a unified M\u0101ori identity, particularly in comparison to P\u0101keh\u0101, who now overwhelmingly outnumbered the M\u0101ori as a whole. M\u0101ori and P\u0101keh\u0101 societies remained largely separate\u2014socially, culturally, economically and geographically\u2014for much of the 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref>King (1996), pp 195\u20136</ref> The key reason for this was that M\u0101ori remained almost exclusively a rural population, whereas increasingly the European population was urban especially after 1900. Nevertheless, M\u0101ori groups continued to engage with the government and in legal processes to increase their standing in (and ultimately further their incorporation into) wider New Zealand society.<ref>Hill (2009), pp 519\u201329</ref> The main point of contact with the government were the four M\u0101ori Members of Parliament.\n\nMany M\u0101ori [[urbanisation|migrated to larger rural towns and cities]] during the Depression and post-WWII periods in search of employment, leaving rural communities depleted and disconnecting many urban M\u0101ori from their traditional social controls and tribal homelands. Yet while standards of living improved among M\u0101ori, they continued to lag behind P\u0101keh\u0101 in areas such as health, income, skilled employment and access to higher levels of education. M\u0101ori leaders and government policymakers alike struggled to deal with [[social issues]] stemming from increased urban migration, including a shortage of housing and jobs, and a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems.<ref name=\"Sorrenson 1997, pp 339\u201341\">Sorrenson (1997), pp 339\u201341</ref>\n\nIn regards to housing, a 1961 census revealed significant differences in the living conditions of M\u0101ori and Europeans. That year, out of all the (unshared) non-M\u0101ori private dwellings in New Zealand, 96.8 per cent had a bath or shower, 94.1 per cent a hot water service, 88.7 per cent a flush toilet, 81.6 per cent a refrigerator, and 78.6 per cent an electric washing machine. By contrast, for all (unshared) M\u0101ori private dwellings that same year, 76.8 per cent had a bath or shower, 68.9 per cent a hot water service, 55.8 per cent a refrigerator, 54.1 per cent a flush toilet, and 47 per cent an electric washing machine.<ref>The Quest for security in New Zealand 1840 to 1966 by William Ball Sutch</ref>\n\nWhile the arrival of Europeans had a profound impact on the M\u0101ori way of life, many aspects of traditional society have survived into the 21st century. M\u0101ori participate fully in all spheres of New Zealand culture and society, leading largely Western lifestyles while also maintaining their own cultural and social customs. The traditional social strata of {{lang|mi|rangatira}}, {{lang|mi|t\u016bt\u016b\u0101}} and {{lang|mi|m\u014dkai}} have all but disappeared from M\u0101ori society, while the roles of {{lang|mi|tohunga}} and {{lang|mi|[[kaum\u0101tua]]}} are still present.

M\u0101ori advocates continue to push for further redress claiming that their concerns are being marginalised or ignored. A 2007 [[Department of Corrections (New Zealand)|Department of Corrections]] report found that M\u0101ori are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system not only because they commit more crimes but also because they face prejudice at many levels: \"a number of studies have shown evidence of greater likelihood, associated only with ethnicity, for M\u0101ori offenders to have police contact, be charged, lack legal representation, not be granted bail, plead guilty, be convicted, be sentenced to non-monetary penalties, and be denied release to Home Detention\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Over-representation of M\u0101ori in the criminal justice system: An exploratory report |author=Policy, Strategy and Research Group, Department of Corrections |publisher=[[Department of Corrections (New Zealand)]] |url=http://www.corrections.govt.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/672574/Over-representation-of-Maori-in-the-criminal-justice-system.pdf |date=September 2007 |accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref> Conversely, critics denounce the scale of assistance given to M\u0101ori as amounting to preferential treatment for a select group of people based on race.<ref name=\"WaitangiDebateTVNZ\">{{cite news|title=The Treaty of Waitangi debate|publisher=TVNZ|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/The-Treaty-of-Waitangi-debate/tabid/1348/articleID/229627/Default.aspx|date=15 October 2011|accessdate=15 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301131125/http://www.3news.co.nz/The-Treaty-of-Waitangi-debate/tabid/1348/articleID/229627/Default.aspx|archivedate=1 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Both sentiments were highlighted during the [[New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy|foreshore and seabed controversy]] in 2004, in which the New Zealand government claimed sole ownership of the New Zealand foreshore and seabed, over the objections of M\u0101ori groups who were seeking customary title.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Ford, Chris |title=Race relations in New Zealand|magazine=[[Global Politician]] |url=http://www.globalpolitician.com/21740-race-new-zealand |date=24 April 2006 |accessdate=27 November 2010}}</ref><!--Better reference needed-->\n\n== Commerce ==\n{{seealso|Cultural appropriation}}\nWider commercial exposure has increased public awareness of the M\u0101ori culture, but has also resulted in several legal disputes.

M\u0101ori have had [[M\u0101ori electorates|reserved seats]] in the [[New Zealand Parliament]] since 1868: presently, this accounts for seven of the 122 seats in New Zealand's unicameral parliament. The contesting of these seats was the first opportunity for many M\u0101ori to participate in New Zealand elections, although the elected M\u0101ori representatives initially struggled to assert significant influence. M\u0101ori received universal suffrage with other New Zealand citizens in 1893.\n\nBeing a traditionally tribal people, no one organisation ostensibly speaks for all M\u0101ori nationwide. The [[M\u0101ori King Movement]] originated in the 1860s as an attempt by several {{lang|mi|iwi}} to unify under one leader: in modern times, it serves a largely ceremonial role. Another attempt at political unity was the Kotahitanga Movement, which established a separate M\u0101ori Parliament that held annual sessions from 1892 until its last sitting in 1902.<ref>{{cite web|title=Te Kotahitanga \u2013 the M\u0101ori Parliament|publisher=[[Ministry of Women's Affairs (New Zealand)|Ministry of Women's Affairs]]|url=http://www.mwa.govt.nz/women-in-nz/maori-women-and-the-vote/te-kotahitanga-the-maori-parliament|date=16 September 2010|accessdate=5 November 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724195319/http://www.mwa.govt.nz/women-in-nz/maori-women-and-the-vote/te-kotahitanga-the-maori-parliament|archivedate=24 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThere are seven designated [[M\u0101ori seats]] in the [[New Zealand Parliament]] (and M\u0101ori can and do stand in and win general roll seats), and consideration of and consultation with M\u0101ori have become routine requirements for councils and government organisations.<ref name=\"seats\">{{cite web |title=The Origins of the M\u0101ori Seats |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/research-papers/document/00PLLawRP03141/origins-of-the-m\u0101ori-seats |accessdate=4 June 2018 |date=31 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nDebate occurs frequently as to the relevance and legitimacy of the M\u0101ori electoral roll and seats.

Renate Aschauer-Knaup, 1 July 1948).\n\nThe band was founded after Weinzierl and the others met at the [[Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl]] 'art commune' in [[Munich]]. The commune consisted mainly of university students, who formed a music group initially to fund the commune, with everyone who lived there joining in to play music whether or not they had any experience or ability. The commune split when they were offered an opportunity to record, which was boycotted by the more musically proficient members of the commune (who went on to form Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl II). Recordings were made by the other members but were of very poor quality and were only released later (under the name Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl) to capitalise on the success of ADII's albums. As Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl II grew and personnel changed, they still remained a commune, living together as a band.<ref name=\"Interview with John Weinzierl\">{{cite web |url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/amonduulii.html |title=Interview with John Weinzierl |first=Jason |last=Gross |date=August 2008 |work=[[Perfect Sound Forever (magazine)|Perfect Sound Forever]] |accessdate=13 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nTheir first album ''[[Phallus Dei]]'' ('God's Phallus'), released in 1969, consisted of pieces drawn from the group's live set at the time. By this time the line-up was built around a core of Karrer (mainly violin and guitar), Weinzierl (guitar, bass, piano), Rogner on keyboards, bass player [[Dave Anderson (musician)|Dave Anderson]], and two drummers (Peter Leopold (b. 15 August 1945) who had joined the group from Berlin, and Dieter Serfas). Renate Knaup at this point was only contributing minimal vocals but was very much part of the group. According to Weinzierl by this time \"The band played almost every day. We played universities, academies, underground clubs, and every hall with a power socket and an audience\".<ref name=\"Interview with John Weinzierl\"/> Releasing an album brought the group greater prominence and they began to tour more widely in Germany and abroad, playing alongside groups such as [[Tangerine Dream]], and in Germany staying in other communes including the pioneering [[Kommune 1]] in Berlin.\n\nTheir second album ''[[Yeti (album)|Yeti]]'' (1970) saw them introducing arranged compositions along with the bluesy violin and guitar jams such as the long improvised title track. The next album [[Tanz der Lemminge]] (1971) was based on four extended progressive rock suites.

The group is generally considered to be one of the pioneers of the West German [[krautrock]] scene. Their 1970 album ''[[Yeti (album)|Yeti]]'' was described by British magazine ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' as \"one of the cornerstones of [...] the entire Krautrock movement.\"<ref>[[Savage Pencil|Pouncey, Edwin]] (February 1996) \"Communing With Chaos\" ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' '''144'''</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe band emerged from the radical [[West Germany|West German]] [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] scene of the late 1960s, with others in the same commune including some of the future founders of the [[Red Army Faction]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nf10k |title=Krautrock: The Rebirth of Germany |work=[[BBC4]] |date=October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://drmarkgriffiths.wordpress.com/2014/12/30/germanic-street-preachers-the-psychology-of-krautrock/ |first=Mark |last=Griffiths |title=Germanic street preachers: The psychology of Krautrock |date=30 December 2014 |work=drmarkgriffiths |accessdate=22 May 2017}}</ref> Founding members are [[Chris Karrer]], Dieter Serfas, Falk Rogner (b. 14 September 1943), John Weinzierl (b. 4 April 1949), and Renate Knaup-Kr\u00f6tenschwanz (b. Renate Aschauer-Knaup, 1 July 1948).\n\nThe band was founded after Weinzierl and the others met at the [[Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl]] 'art commune' in [[Munich]]. The commune consisted mainly of university students, who formed a music group initially to fund the commune, with everyone who lived there joining in to play music whether or not they had any experience or ability. The commune split when they were offered an opportunity to record, which was boycotted by the more musically proficient members of the commune (who went on to form Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl II). Recordings were made by the other members but were of very poor quality and were only released later (under the name Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl) to capitalise on the success of ADII's albums. As Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl II grew and personnel changed, they still remained a commune, living together as a band.<ref name=\"Interview with John Weinzierl\">{{cite web |url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/amonduulii.html |title=Interview with John Weinzierl |first=Jason |last=Gross |date=August 2008 |work=[[Perfect Sound Forever (magazine)|Perfect Sound Forever]] |accessdate=13 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nTheir first album ''[[Phallus Dei]]'' ('God's Phallus'), released in 1969, consisted of pieces drawn from the group's live set at the time. By this time the line-up was built around a core of Karrer (mainly violin and guitar), Weinzierl (guitar, bass, piano), Rogner on keyboards, bass player [[Dave Anderson (musician)|Dave Anderson]], and two drummers (Peter Leopold (b. 15 August 1945) who had joined the group from Berlin, and Dieter Serfas). Renate Knaup at this point was only contributing minimal vocals but was very much part of the group. According to Weinzierl by this time \"The band played almost every day. We played universities, academies, underground clubs, and every hall with a power socket and an audience\".<ref name=\"Interview with John Weinzierl\"/> Releasing an album brought the group greater prominence and they began to tour more widely in Germany and abroad, playing alongside groups such as [[Tangerine Dream]], and in Germany staying in other communes including the pioneering [[Kommune 1]] in Berlin.\n\nTheir second album ''[[Yeti (album)|Yeti]]'' (1970) saw them introducing arranged compositions along with the bluesy violin and guitar jams such as the long improvised title track. The next album [[Tanz der Lemminge]] (1971) was based on four extended progressive rock suites. By this time bassist Anderson had returned to England and joined [[Hawkwind]], to be replaced by Lothar Meid (born 28 August 1942), and the group was augmented by synthman Karl-Heinz Hausmann (Karrer had formed a short-lived group in 1966 - supposedly named 'Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl O' - with future [[Embryo (band)|Embryo]] founders Lothar Meid and drummer [[Christian Burchard]]).<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/60/?pageno=1 |title=Communing With Chaos |first=Edwin |last=Pouncey |authorlink=Edwin Pouncey |magazine=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] |issue=144 |date=February 1996 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529071222/http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/60/ |archivedate=29 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nStill touring widely, they recorded their ''Live in London'' album in late 1972 and in 1975 signed with [[Atlantic Records]] in the US, and [[United Artists Records]] Germany and initially disbanded in 1981.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book |first=Martin C. |last=Strong |year=2000 |title=The Great Rock Discography |edition=5th |publisher=Mojo Books |location=Edinburgh |pages=20\u201321 |isbn=1-84195-017-3}}</ref>\n\nAs well as their albums and live shows ADII received offers to write music for films, winning a German film award, the [[Deutscher Filmpreis]], for their contribution to the film ''[[San Domingo (film)|San Domingo]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gepr.net/amfram.html |title=Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl II |work=Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock}}</ref>\n\nAmon D\u00fc\u00fcl II's drummer, Peter Leopold, died on 8 November 2006.

The brothers discover that their mother has lost her house in a foreclosure. The brothers hold the new owners and their guests hostage. When their mother arrives, she takes control of the situation.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAn unknown woman enters a maternity ward and, with help from an accomplice, steals a newborn baby, Terry ([[J. Larose]]), one of the guards catches them in the act but ends up being stabbed to death.\n\nBeth Sohapi ([[Jaime King]]) is having a birthday party for her husband, Daniel Sohapi ([[Frank Grillo]]) with the help of their friends, married couple Treshawn ([[Lyriq Bent]]) and Gina Jackson ([[Kandyse McClure]]); Dave Lowe ([[Tony Nappo]]) and his fiancee, Annette Langston ([[Briana Evigan]]); George Barnum ([[Shawn Ashmore]]) and his girlfriend, Melissa McGuire (Jessie Rusu); and Daniel's co worker, and friend, Julie Ross ([[Lisa Marcos]]). The news reports a tornado is heading their way; Daniel assures his guests that the basement is tornado proof.\n\nAfter a bank robbery gone wrong, three brothers, eldest and leader Ike ([[Patrick Flueger]]), irrational and irresponsible Addley ([[Warren Kole]]) and Johnny ([[Matt O'Leary]]), who has been badly injured, are on the run from the law. They reach their mother's house only to find it unrecognizable. Daniel and Beth, hearing noise upstairs, leave the basement party only to find the brothers holding them hostage within their home at gunpoint. Terrified, Beth offers the brothers the help of George, a doctor, who begins to tend to Johnny's injuries. Addley forces Beth and Daniel downstairs, trapping all the party-goers in the basement at gunpoint. Ike calls his sister Lydia ([[Deborah Ann Woll]]), who informs him that she and their mother lost the house and will be on their way to help the boys.\n\nA short time later, an [[Recreational vehicle|RV]] arrives with Lydia and Mother ([[Rebecca De Mornay]]) with Lydia rushing to Johnny's side, showing she only has compassion for him. Mother becomes very angry at Ike for losing the emergency phone they use to contact one another, telling him she was unable to alert him of losing the house. Realizing the gravity of the situation, Mother arranges help to sneak over the border into Canada, however it will cost ten thousand dollars. She learns of her sons sending money to the house which she never received, before going into the basement. Mother is initially nice to the hostages, explaining to them that no one has to get hurt. She confronts Beth and Daniel about the money, however both deny knowing about it. Mother believes Beth, however she has Addley and Ike torture Daniel for information. Just then Melissa attempts to escape, only to be shot by Addley. Mother strikes Addley for his behavior then takes the cellphones, bank cards and pin numbers of the others and makes Ike take Beth to a cash machine to collect the money. Meanwhile, Mother informs George to keep Johnny alive, or they will all die, with Lydia told to help George and Johnny.\n\nA police officer (Mike O'Brien) arrives after the three suspects of the bank robbery are identified as the old residents of the house, but Daniel makes him leave assuring him everything is fine, thus alerting Mother of Daniel's lying skills. She further becomes suspicious after Lydia discovers a Valentine's card from Daniel to Julie, as well as photographs and newspaper articles of a child killed in a car accident.\n\nIke and Beth dispose of Melissa's body behind a dumpster, where she is soon found to be alive by two sanitation workers who rush her to a hospital. While at the ATM, Beth and Ike encounter two party girls, Vicky Rice ([[A. J. Cook]]) and Jenna Luther ([[Alexa Vega]]), who Ike quickly kills after they realize he has a gun. The pair travel to Treshawn's laundromat business to take money out of the safe, where Beth attempts to escape but fails, while later encountering the same police officer who Ike then kills. Back at the house, George realizes Mother has been lying to Lydia about a rare skin condition and tries to convince her to help his friends, but Mother sends Lydia away. Johnny, now in critical condition, has to be resuscitated by Lydia and George when he goes into cardiac arrest, telling his mother he doesn't want to die a virgin. Mother forces Treshawn and Dave to fight over which one of their partners will be forced to have sex with Johnny. Dave loses and Annette is forced upstairs. However Johnny's injuries prove too severe to rape Annette and she is forced back into the basement by Addley. Dave attacks Addley, resulting in Addley accidentally shooting Dave in the face, killing him. Gina takes the opportunity to try and escape, however is brought back to the house by Daniel in order to save Beth.\n\nIn the basement, Mother informs Gina that disobedience has consequences, before pouring boiling water over Treshawn. Mother then attempts to find her money by burning the photographs of the boy, revealed to be Daniel and Beth's deceased son. Mother then sets Julie's hair on fire, but extinguishes it when she realizes Daniel is telling the truth about the money. Mother leaves the basement, before the group manage to arm themselves with knives. They lure Addley into the basement and stab him to death. Treshawn, now deaf and having difficulty seeing, takes Addley's gun and goes upstairs. Gina follows him, startling him and causing him to shoot her in the side. As Treshawn attempts to help his wife, Mother shoots him in the back, killing him. Mother discovers Addley's body and phones Ike, before forcing Beth to listen to her shoot Daniel. Annette and Julie are then taken upstairs and tied up.\n\nAt the hospital, Melissa regains consciousness and alerts authorities to the house. George confronts Mother, telling her that none of her kids look like one another, and look nothing like her. Mother, enraged, threatens to kill him, but Lydia convinces her that they still need George to help Johnny. Ike and Beth then burst through the front door with the money, Ike heading downstairs to mourn his loss. Mother instructs Ike, Lydia and George to take Johnny to the RV while she has a chat with the ladies.\n\nInside the RV, Johnny, hoping to please his mother and older brother, shoots George in spite of Lydia's pleas to let him live. Mother reveals to Julie and Annette that Beth was the one who hid the money and is the one responsible for all the deaths. Beth reveals that she was hiding the money for the baby she is expecting. She also reveals she knew Daniel was cheating on her with Julie, and wanted to leave him. Mother forces Beth to take a pregnancy test to prove it, before Beth knocks Mother unconscious. Beth unties Julie - who is shot in the head by Ike while trying to escape the house - and Annette, who hides with Beth in the garage. Together they manage to overpower Ike and kill him. Annette escapes to the neighbours, while Beth fights with Mother in the house. Beth is knocked unconscious and Mother sets the house on fire. However, Beth wakes up and overpowers Mother, hitting her with a wooden chopping board, before escaping the house along with Gina, who has survived her injuries.\n\nMonths later, a very pregnant Beth goes into labor and is taken to the hospital by Annette, Gina and Melissa. That night, Beth wakes up to the emergency alarms going off in the maternity ward. She gets up and goes to check on her baby, but the bassinette is empty. The film ends with Lydia, Johnny and Mother leaving the country in the RV with Beth's baby.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Rebecca De Mornay]] as Natalie \"Mother\" Koffin, mother of Ike, Addley, Johnny, and Lydia.

The brothers discover that their mother has lost her house in a foreclosure. The brothers hold the new owners and their guests hostage. When their mother arrives, she takes control of the situation.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAn unknown woman enters a maternity ward and, with help from an accomplice, steals a newborn baby, Terry ([[J. Larose]]), one of the guards catches them in the act but ends up being stabbed to death.\n\nBeth Sohapi ([[Jaime King]]) is having a birthday party for her husband, Daniel Sohapi ([[Frank Grillo]]) with the help of their friends, married couple Treshawn ([[Lyriq Bent]]) and Gina Jackson ([[Kandyse McClure]]); Dave Lowe ([[Tony Nappo]]) and his fiancee, Annette Langston ([[Briana Evigan]]); George Barnum ([[Shawn Ashmore]]) and his girlfriend, Melissa McGuire (Jessie Rusu); and Daniel's co worker, and friend, Julie Ross ([[Lisa Marcos]]). The news reports a tornado is heading their way; Daniel assures his guests that the basement is tornado proof.\n\nAfter a bank robbery gone wrong, three brothers, eldest and leader Ike ([[Patrick Flueger]]), irrational and irresponsible Addley ([[Warren Kole]]) and Johnny ([[Matt O'Leary]]), who has been badly injured, are on the run from the law. They reach their mother's house only to find it unrecognizable. Daniel and Beth, hearing noise upstairs, leave the basement party only to find the brothers holding them hostage within their home at gunpoint. Terrified, Beth offers the brothers the help of George, a doctor, who begins to tend to Johnny's injuries. Addley forces Beth and Daniel downstairs, trapping all the party-goers in the basement at gunpoint. Ike calls his sister Lydia ([[Deborah Ann Woll]]), who informs him that she and their mother lost the house and will be on their way to help the boys.\n\nA short time later, an [[Recreational vehicle|RV]] arrives with Lydia and Mother ([[Rebecca De Mornay]]) with Lydia rushing to Johnny's side, showing she only has compassion for him. Mother becomes very angry at Ike for losing the emergency phone they use to contact one another, telling him she was unable to alert him of losing the house. Realizing the gravity of the situation, Mother arranges help to sneak over the border into Canada, however it will cost ten thousand dollars. She learns of her sons sending money to the house which she never received, before going into the basement. Mother is initially nice to the hostages, explaining to them that no one has to get hurt. She confronts Beth and Daniel about the money, however both deny knowing about it. Mother believes Beth, however she has Addley and Ike torture Daniel for information. Just then Melissa attempts to escape, only to be shot by Addley. Mother strikes Addley for his behavior then takes the cellphones, bank cards and pin numbers of the others and makes Ike take Beth to a cash machine to collect the money. Meanwhile, Mother informs George to keep Johnny alive, or they will all die, with Lydia told to help George and Johnny.\n\nA police officer (Mike O'Brien) arrives after the three suspects of the bank robbery are identified as the old residents of the house, but Daniel makes him leave assuring him everything is fine, thus alerting Mother of Daniel's lying skills. She further becomes suspicious after Lydia discovers a Valentine's card from Daniel to Julie, as well as photographs and newspaper articles of a child killed in a car accident.\n\nIke and Beth dispose of Melissa's body behind a dumpster, where she is soon found to be alive by two sanitation workers who rush her to a hospital. While at the ATM, Beth and Ike encounter two party girls, Vicky Rice ([[A. J. Cook]]) and Jenna Luther ([[Alexa Vega]]), who Ike quickly kills after they realize he has a gun. The pair travel to Treshawn's laundromat business to take money out of the safe, where Beth attempts to escape but fails, while later encountering the same police officer who Ike then kills. Back at the house, George realizes Mother has been lying to Lydia about a rare skin condition and tries to convince her to help his friends, but Mother sends Lydia away. Johnny, now in critical condition, has to be resuscitated by Lydia and George when he goes into cardiac arrest, telling his mother he doesn't want to die a virgin. Mother forces Treshawn and Dave to fight over which one of their partners will be forced to have sex with Johnny. Dave loses and Annette is forced upstairs. However Johnny's injuries prove too severe to rape Annette and she is forced back into the basement by Addley. Dave attacks Addley, resulting in Addley accidentally shooting Dave in the face, killing him. Gina takes the opportunity to try and escape, however is brought back to the house by Daniel in order to save Beth.\n\nIn the basement, Mother informs Gina that disobedience has consequences, before pouring boiling water over Treshawn. Mother then attempts to find her money by burning the photographs of the boy, revealed to be Daniel and Beth's deceased son. Mother then sets Julie's hair on fire, but extinguishes it when she realizes Daniel is telling the truth about the money. Mother leaves the basement, before the group manage to arm themselves with knives. They lure Addley into the basement and stab him to death. Treshawn, now deaf and having difficulty seeing, takes Addley's gun and goes upstairs. Gina follows him, startling him and causing him to shoot her in the side. As Treshawn attempts to help his wife, Mother shoots him in the back, killing him. Mother discovers Addley's body and phones Ike, before forcing Beth to listen to her shoot Daniel. Annette and Julie are then taken upstairs and tied up.\n\nAt the hospital, Melissa regains consciousness and alerts authorities to the house. George confronts Mother, telling her that none of her kids look like one another, and look nothing like her. Mother, enraged, threatens to kill him, but Lydia convinces her that they still need George to help Johnny. Ike and Beth then burst through the front door with the money, Ike heading downstairs to mourn his loss. Mother instructs Ike, Lydia and George to take Johnny to the RV while she has a chat with the ladies.\n\nInside the RV, Johnny, hoping to please his mother and older brother, shoots George in spite of Lydia's pleas to let him live. Mother reveals to Julie and Annette that Beth was the one who hid the money and is the one responsible for all the deaths. Beth reveals that she was hiding the money for the baby she is expecting. She also reveals she knew Daniel was cheating on her with Julie, and wanted to leave him. Mother forces Beth to take a pregnancy test to prove it, before Beth knocks Mother unconscious. Beth unties Julie - who is shot in the head by Ike while trying to escape the house - and Annette, who hides with Beth in the garage. Together they manage to overpower Ike and kill him. Annette escapes to the neighbours, while Beth fights with Mother in the house. Beth is knocked unconscious and Mother sets the house on fire. However, Beth wakes up and overpowers Mother, hitting her with a wooden chopping board, before escaping the house along with Gina, who has survived her injuries.\n\nMonths later, a very pregnant Beth goes into labor and is taken to the hospital by Annette, Gina and Melissa. That night, Beth wakes up to the emergency alarms going off in the maternity ward. She gets up and goes to check on her baby, but the bassinette is empty. The film ends with Lydia, Johnny and Mother leaving the country in the RV with Beth's baby.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Rebecca De Mornay]] as Natalie \"Mother\" Koffin, mother of Ike, Addley, Johnny, and Lydia.

Consequently, a diagnosis of MALS is typically only entertained after more common conditions have been ruled out. Once suspected, screening for MALS can be done with [[ultrasonography]] and confirmed with [[CT angiography|computed tomography]] (CT) or [[MR angiography|magnetic resonance]] (MR) [[angiography]].\n\nTreatment is generally surgical, the mainstay being [[open surgery|open]] or [[Laparoscopy|laparascopic]] division, or separation, of the median arcuate ligament combined with removal of the [[celiac ganglia]]. The majority of patients benefit from surgical intervention. Poorer responses to treatment tend to occur in patients of older age, those with a [[mental disorder|psychiatric condition]] or who use alcohol, have abdominal pain unrelated to meals, or who have not experienced weight loss.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nPatients with MALS reportedly experience [[abdominal pain]], particularly in the [[epigastrium]], which may be associated with eating and which may result in [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] and [[weight loss]]. The pain can be in the left or right side, but usually where the ribs meet.<ref name=\"mals-horton\"/> Other signs are persistent nausea, lassitude (especially after a heavy meal) and exercise intolerance.

''Right'' In MALS, the ligament is anterior, rather than superior, to the celiac artery, resulting in compression of the vessel and a characteristic hook-shaped contour.</div></div></div>\n\nThe [[median arcuate ligament]] is a [[ligament]] formed at the base of the [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] where the left and right [[diaphragmatic crura]] join near the 12th [[thoracic vertebra]]. This fibrous arch forms the anterior aspect of the [[aortic hiatus]], through which the [[aorta]], [[thoracic duct]], and [[azygos vein]] pass. The median arcuate ligament usually comes into contact with the aorta above the branch point of the [[celiac artery]]. However, in up to one quarter of normal individuals, the median arcuate ligament passes in front of the celiac artery, compressing the celiac artery and nearby structures such as the [[celiac ganglia]].<ref name=\"mals-horton\"/> In some of these individuals, this compression is pathologic and leads to the median arcuate ligament syndrome.<ref name=\"mals-horton\"/>\n\nSeveral theories attempt to explain the origin of pain caused by compression of the celiac artery.<ref name=\"duncan\"/> One proposes that compression of the celiac artery causes [[ischemia]], or decreased blood flow, to abdominal organs, leading to pain.

Consequently, a diagnosis of MALS is typically only entertained after more common conditions have been ruled out. Once suspected, screening for MALS can be done with [[ultrasonography]] and confirmed with [[CT angiography|computed tomography]] (CT) or [[MR angiography|magnetic resonance]] (MR) [[angiography]].\n\nTreatment is generally surgical, the mainstay being [[open surgery|open]] or [[Laparoscopy|laparascopic]] division, or separation, of the median arcuate ligament combined with removal of the [[celiac ganglia]]. The majority of patients benefit from surgical intervention. Poorer responses to treatment tend to occur in patients of older age, those with a [[mental disorder|psychiatric condition]] or who use alcohol, have abdominal pain unrelated to meals, or who have not experienced weight loss.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nPatients with MALS reportedly experience [[abdominal pain]], particularly in the [[epigastrium]], which may be associated with eating and which may result in [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] and [[weight loss]]. The pain can be in the left or right side, but usually where the ribs meet.<ref name=\"mals-horton\"/> Other signs are persistent nausea, lassitude (especially after a heavy meal) and exercise intolerance. Diarrhea is a common symptom, some experience constipation. While some experience vomiting, not everyone does. Exercise or certain postures can aggravate the symptoms.

''Left'' The [[median arcuate ligament]] is normally several millimeters to centimeters superior to the origin of the [[celiac artery]]. ''Right'' In MALS, the ligament is anterior, rather than superior, to the celiac artery, resulting in compression of the vessel and a characteristic hook-shaped contour.</div></div></div>\n\nThe [[median arcuate ligament]] is a [[ligament]] formed at the base of the [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] where the left and right [[diaphragmatic crura]] join near the 12th [[thoracic vertebra]]. This fibrous arch forms the anterior aspect of the [[aortic hiatus]], through which the [[aorta]], [[thoracic duct]], and [[azygos vein]] pass. The median arcuate ligament usually comes into contact with the aorta above the branch point of the [[celiac artery]]. However, in up to one quarter of normal individuals, the median arcuate ligament passes in front of the celiac artery, compressing the celiac artery and nearby structures such as the [[celiac ganglia]].<ref name=\"mals-horton\"/> In some of these individuals, this compression is pathologic and leads to the median arcuate ligament syndrome.<ref name=\"mals-horton\"/>\n\nSeveral theories attempt to explain the origin of pain caused by compression of the celiac artery.<ref name=\"duncan\"/> One proposes that compression of the celiac artery causes [[ischemia]], or decreased blood flow, to abdominal organs, leading to pain.
