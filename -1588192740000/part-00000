A different court, the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] (CCA) is the court of last resort in criminal cases. \n\nThe Court has its seat at the Supreme Court Building on the [[Texas State Capitol|State Capitol]] grounds in Austin, Texas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.txcourts.gov/media/9160/CapitolComplex2008-forCourts.pdf|title=Supreme Court Building on Map of Texas Capitol Complex|last=|first=|date=|website=Texas Judiciary Website|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> \n\nLike the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], the Texas Supreme Court consists of a Chief Justice and eight associate justices. Unlike the SCOTUS, however, all nine positions are elected, with a term of office of six years with no term limit, rather than life tenure. All members typically belong to the same party because all are elected in statewide races, rather than by the electorates of smaller appellate districts, as the justices on the intermediate appellate courts are. Although there are fourteen such courts, the state is geographically divided into thirteen. Two districts (the 1st and the 14th) are coextensive. The First and Fourteenth Courts of Appeals serve the same ten counties, sit in the same Downtown Houston Courthouse, and also share a single clerk.       \n\nThe Texas Supreme Court was established in 1846 to replace the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas]]. It meets in [[Downtown Austin|Downtown]] [[Austin, Texas]] in an office building near the [[Texas State Capitol]].  \n\n==Regulation of the practice of law in Texas courts==\nBy statute, the Texas Supreme Court has administrative control over the [[State Bar of Texas]], an agency of the judiciary.<ref>Tex. Gov't Code section 81.011.</ref>  The Texas Supreme Court has the sole authority to license attorneys in Texas,<ref>Tex. Gov't Code sections 81.061 and 82.021</ref> and also appoints the members of the Board of Law Examiners<ref>Tex. Gov't Code section 82.001</ref> which, under instructions of the Supreme Court, administers the Texas bar exam.<ref>Tex. Gov't Code section 82.004.</ref> The Court has the last word in attorney disciplinary proceedings brought by the Commission for Lawyer Discipline, a committee of the [[State Bar of Texas]], but rarely exercises discretionary review in such cases. The Supreme Court accepts fewer than 100 cases per year to be decided on the merits. In addition to its adjudicatory and administrative functions, the Supreme Court promulgates, and occasionally revises, court rules of procedure, which include the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure (TRCP), the Texas Rules of Evidence (TRE), and the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure (TRAP).[https://www.txcourts.gov/rules-forms/rules-standards/]  \n\n==Unique procedural aspects==\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court is the only [[state supreme court]] in the United States in which the manner in which it denies [[certiorari|discretionary review]] can actually imply approval or disapproval of the merits of the lower court's decision and in turn may affect the geographic extent of the precedential effect of that decision. In March 1927, the Texas Legislature enacted a law directing the Texas Supreme Court to summarily ''refuse'' to hear applications for writs of error when it believed the Court of Appeals opinion correctly stated the law.<ref name=\"Steiner\">{{cite journal|last1=Steiner|first1=Mark E.|title=Not Fade Away: The Continuing Relevance of 'Writ Refused' Opinions|journal=The Appellate Advocate|date=February 1999|volume=12|pages=3\u20136}} Available via [[HeinOnline]].</ref> Thus, since June 1927, over 4,100 decisions of the [[Texas Courts of Appeals]] have become valid binding precedent of the Texas Supreme Court itself because the high court refused applications for writ of error rather than denying them and thereby signaled that it approved of their holdings as the law of the state.<ref name=\"Steiner\" />\n\nWhile Texas's unique practice saved the state supreme court from having to hear relatively minor cases just to create uniform statewide precedents on those issues, it also makes for lengthy citations to the opinions of the Courts of Appeals, since the subsequent writ history of the case must always be noted (e.g., no writ, writ refused, writ denied, etc.) in order for the reader to determine at a glance whether the cited opinion is binding precedent only in the district of the Court of Appeals in which it was decided, or binding precedent for the entire state.<ref name=\"Steiner\" /> Citations to cases from the Houston-based Courts of Appeals are also longer than others because they require identification of the appellate district number -- [1st Dist.] or [14th Dist.] -- in addition to the name of the city. \n\n==Justices of the Court==\nThe Texas Supreme Court consists of a [[Chief Justice]] and eight associate justices, each of whom has one vote. Each member of the Court must be at least 35 years of age, a [[citizenship|citizen]] of Texas, licensed to practice [[law]] in Texas, and must have practiced law (or have been a [[lawyers|lawyer]] and a judge of a court of record together) for at least ten years.<ref>[[Texas Constitution|Tex. Const.]], Art. 5, Sec. 2.</ref> The [[court clerk|Clerk of the Court]], currently Blake A. Hawthorne, is appointed by the Justices and serves a four-year term, which is renewable.[https://www.txcourts.gov/supreme/about-the-court/clerks-office/] \n\n===Election of members of the Court and appointments ===\n[[File:TexasSupremeCourtBuilding.JPG|thumb|Texas Supreme Court Building]]\nAll members of the court are elected to six-year terms in statewide partisan [[elections in Texas|elections]]. Because their terms are staggered, only a subset of justices is up for re-election in any one election cycle.  When a vacancy arises, the [[Governor of Texas]] appoints a replacement, subject to Senate confirmation, to serve out the unexpired term until  December 31 after the next general election. The initial term of tenure is therefore often less than six years. Most of the current justices were originally appointed either by former [[Governor]] [[Rick Perry]] or by the current Governor of Texas, [[Greg Abbott]], who is himself a former member of the SCOTX. \n\nLike the judges on the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]], all members of the Texas Supreme Court are [[United States Republican Party|Republican]]<nowiki/>s.\n\nThe most recent appointees are Jane Bland, [[Jimmy Blacklock]], and Brett Busby.  \n\n[[J. Brett Busby|Brett Busby]] and [[Jane Bland]] are former Court of Appeals justices from Houston, whose re-election bids failed in November 2018 when Democrats won all of the judicial races. Blacklock formerly served Governor [[Greg Abbott]] as general counsel.  \n\nBlacklock replaced [[Don Willett]], who now sits on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the federal appellate court that hears appeals from federal district courts in Texas. Busby succeeds [[Phil Johnson (judge)|Phil Johnson]], who retired in 2018, and was sworn in on\u00a0 March 20, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2019/03/20/brett-busby-confirmed-texas-supreme-court-senate/|title=Texas Senate confirms Brett Busby for Supreme Court post|last=Tribune|first=The Texas|last2=Platoff|first2=Emma|date=2019-03-20|website=The Texas Tribune|language=en|access-date=2019-04-13}}</ref> Jane Bland was appointed in September 2019 to fill the vacancy left by [[Jeff Brown (judge)|Jeff Brown]], who resigned from the SCOTX to accept appointment to a U.S. district court bench.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2019/08/26/greg-abbott-appoints-jane-bland-texas-supreme-court/|title=Gov.

It was previously held by [[Wallace B. Jefferson]], who is now a frequent advocate before the high court on behalf of private clients, as are several other former members of the Court.  \n\nThe other eight position numbers have no special significance except for identification purposes on the ballot. Informally, justices are ranked by seniority, and their profiles appear on the Court's website in that order.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.txcourts.gov/supreme/about-the-court/justices/|title=TJB {{!}} SC {{!}} About the Court {{!}} Justices|website=www.txcourts.gov|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref> \n\nEach member of the Texas Supreme Court is elected in a statewide contest, which is a key reason why there is no representation of the minority party on the Court, even though Democrats are now well-represented at the lower levels of the judicial hierarchy, whose judges are elected from smaller appellate districts and from counties.  \n\nSingle-party control of the Court has a distorting impact on the High Court's jurisprudence, which was true when Democrats were dominant, as is true now after decades of the Republican lock on the high court. There are no liberal and conservative wings on the Court, and no swing votes. Most decisions are unanimous. Republican Governor Greg Abbott does his best to assure preservation of partisan Republican control of the judiciary. His appointees to vacancies are screened for ideological acceptability with a questionnaire that asks the candidate what U.S. Supreme Court decision they disagree with.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/organization/appointments/Abbott_Judicial_Questionnaire.pdf|title=Judicial Questionnaire|last=Governor Greg Abbott|first=|date=|website=Office of the Governor|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 23, 2019}}</ref>  \n\n===Women on the Court===\n[[Hortense Sparks Ward]], who became the first woman to pass the Texas [[bar examination|Bar Exam]] in 1910, was appointed Special Chief Justice of an [[All-Woman Supreme Court|all-female Texas Supreme Court]] 15 years later. All of the court's male justices recused themselves from ''Johnson'' v. ''Darr'', a 1924 case involving the [[Woodmen of the World]], and, since nearly every member of the Texas Bar was a member of that fraternal organization, paying personal insurance premiums that varied with the claims decided against it, no male judges or attorneys could be found to hear the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/jpa01|title=ALL-WOMAN SUPREME COURT|first=COTTRELL, DEBBIE|last=MAULDIN|date=June 9, 2010|website=www.tshaonline.org|access-date=May 4, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103193520/https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/jpa01|archive-date=January 3, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref> After ten months of searching for suitable male replacements to decide the case, Governor [[Pat Neff]] decided on January 1, 1925, to appoint a special court composed of three women.

Court technology, and the information it carries, are sprawling topics, and Texas is a diverse state with decentralized funding and decision-making for trial court technology. JCIT provides a forum for discussion of court technology and information projects. With this forum, JCIT reaches out to external partners such as the Conference of Urban Counties, the County Information Resource Agency, Texas.gov, and TIJIS (Texas Integrated Justice Information Systems), and advises or is consulted by the Office of Court Administration on a variety of projects.\n\nThree themes consistently recur in the JCIT conversation: expansion and governance of electronic filing; the evolution and proliferation of court case management systems; and the evolution and governance of technology standards for reporting and sharing information across systems in civil, family, juvenile, and criminal justice.\n\nThe Founding Chair of JCIT from 1997\u20132009 was Peter S. Vogel, a partner at Gardere Wynne Sewell LLP in Dallas, and since 2009 the JCIT Chair has been [[Rebecca Simmons|Justice Rebecca Simmons]].\n\n== 2018 Texas Supreme Court judicial election ==\nWhile Republican incumbents suffered massive defeats in the Courts of Appeals on November 6, 2018, bringing about a switch of majorities from Republicans to Democrats in Dallas, Houston,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/GOP-Free-Zone-Republican-judges-swept-out-by-13376806.php|title=Republican judges swept out by voters in Harris County election|last=Rogers|first=Brian|date=2018-11-08|website=Houston Chronicle|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref> and Austin, the three Republican incumbents on the Texas Supreme Court who faced the entire Texas electorate in statewide races won comfortably.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Texas_Supreme_Court_elections,_2018|title=Texas Supreme Court elections, 2018|website=Ballotpedia|language=en|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref>\n\nIncumbent John Devine prevailed over his opponent R.K. Sandill, a sitting district court judge of Asian-American descent in Houston, with 53.75% of the vote and secured a second term. Justice Jeff Brown beat off a challenge by Democratic candidate Kathy Cheng (who unlike her fellow Democratic challengers did not have comparable judicial experience) with the same vote margin. The high court\u2019s most recent appointed member, Jimmy Blacklock, defeated Steven Kirkland, who like Sandill serves as a district court judge in Houston, with 53.17% of the vote. Neither Sandill nor Kirkland were up for reelection this year and are expected to remain on their respective district court benches.\n\nJustice Blacklock faced the electorate for the first time, having recently been appointed. Blacklock was Governor Abbott\u2019s replacement for Justice Don Willett, who ascended to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals before his term on the Texas Supreme Court had expired, thus creating a vacancy and an opportunity for the Governor to fill it with an already-vetted candidate of his own.\n\nAll appellate court races were clearly driven by party-line voting. That worked in favor of Republican incumbents at the statewide level as usual, but against Republican incumbents in the court of appeals, whose members are each elected from one of fourteen appellate districts. Some of those districts favored Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections, which entailed heavy Republican losses at the trial court level likewise.<ref>Texas Secretary of State 2018 General Election - Unofficial Election Results as of 11/7/2018 2:53 PM\n\nhttps://enrpages.sos.state.tx.us/public/nov06_331_state.htm?x=0&y=9589&id=472</ref>\n\nUnder the leadership of Governor Greg Abbott Texas Republicans have since moved to change the way Texas selects judges and justices in the major metropolitan jurisdictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facingsouth.org/2019/11/texas-considers-ending-judicial-elections-democrats-gain-ground|title=Texas considers ending judicial elections as Democrats gain ground|date=2019-11-06|website=Facing South|language=en|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2019/07/15/texas-partisan-judicial-elections-reform-abbott-support/|title=State leaders again want to review how Texas elects judges.

A different court, the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] (CCA) is the court of last resort in criminal cases. \n\nThe Court has its seat at the Supreme Court Building on the [[Texas State Capitol|State Capitol]] grounds in Austin, Texas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.txcourts.gov/media/9160/CapitolComplex2008-forCourts.pdf|title=Supreme Court Building on Map of Texas Capitol Complex|last=|first=|date=|website=Texas Judiciary Website|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> \n\nLike the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], the Texas Supreme Court consists of a Chief Justice and eight associate justices. Unlike the SCOTUS, however, all nine positions are elected, with a term of office of six years with no term limit, rather than life tenure. All members typically belong to the same party because all are elected in statewide races, rather than by the electorates of smaller appellate districts, as the justices on the intermediate appellate courts are. Although there are fourteen such courts, the state is geographically divided into thirteen. Two districts (the 1st and the 14th) are coextensive. The First and Fourteenth Courts of Appeals serve the same ten counties, sit in the same Downtown Houston Courthouse, and also share a single clerk.       \n\nThe Texas Supreme Court was established in 1846 to replace the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas]]. It meets in [[Downtown Austin|Downtown]] [[Austin, Texas]] in an office building near the [[Texas State Capitol]].  \n\n==Regulation of the practice of law in Texas courts==\nBy statute, the Texas Supreme Court has administrative control over the [[State Bar of Texas]], an agency of the judiciary.<ref>Tex. Gov't Code section 81.011.</ref>  The Texas Supreme Court has the sole authority to license attorneys in Texas,<ref>Tex. Gov't Code sections 81.061 and 82.021</ref> and also appoints the members of the Board of Law Examiners<ref>Tex. Gov't Code section 82.001</ref> which, under instructions of the Supreme Court, administers the Texas bar exam.<ref>Tex. Gov't Code section 82.004.</ref> The Court has the last word in attorney disciplinary proceedings brought by the Commission for Lawyer Discipline, a committee of the [[State Bar of Texas]], but rarely exercises discretionary review in such cases. The Supreme Court accepts fewer than 100 cases per year to be decided on the merits. In addition to its adjudicatory and administrative functions, the Supreme Court promulgates, and occasionally revises, court rules of procedure, which include the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure (TRCP), the Texas Rules of Evidence (TRE), and the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure (TRAP).[https://www.txcourts.gov/rules-forms/rules-standards/]  \n\n==Unique procedural aspects==\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court is the only [[state supreme court]] in the United States in which the manner in which it denies [[certiorari|discretionary review]] can actually imply approval or disapproval of the merits of the lower court's decision and in turn may affect the geographic extent of the precedential effect of that decision. In March 1927, the Texas Legislature enacted a law directing the Texas Supreme Court to summarily ''refuse'' to hear applications for writs of error when it believed the Court of Appeals opinion correctly stated the law.<ref name=\"Steiner\">{{cite journal|last1=Steiner|first1=Mark E.|title=Not Fade Away: The Continuing Relevance of 'Writ Refused' Opinions|journal=The Appellate Advocate|date=February 1999|volume=12|pages=3\u20136}} Available via [[HeinOnline]].</ref> Thus, since June 1927, over 4,100 decisions of the [[Texas Courts of Appeals]] have become valid binding precedent of the Texas Supreme Court itself because the high court refused applications for writ of error rather than denying them and thereby signaled that it approved of their holdings as the law of the state.<ref name=\"Steiner\" />\n\nWhile Texas's unique practice saved the state supreme court from having to hear relatively minor cases just to create uniform statewide precedents on those issues, it also makes for lengthy citations to the opinions of the Courts of Appeals, since the subsequent writ history of the case must always be noted (e.g., no writ, writ refused, writ denied, etc.) in order for the reader to determine at a glance whether the cited opinion is binding precedent only in the district of the Court of Appeals in which it was decided, or binding precedent for the entire state.<ref name=\"Steiner\" /> Citations to cases from the Houston-based Courts of Appeals are also longer than others because they require identification of the appellate district number -- [1st Dist.] or [14th Dist.] -- in addition to the name of the city. \n\n==Justices of the Court==\nThe Texas Supreme Court consists of a [[Chief Justice]] and eight associate justices, each of whom has one vote. Each member of the Court must be at least 35 years of age, a [[citizenship|citizen]] of Texas, licensed to practice [[law]] in Texas, and must have practiced law (or have been a [[lawyers|lawyer]] and a judge of a court of record together) for at least ten years.<ref>[[Texas Constitution|Tex. Const.]], Art. 5, Sec. 2.</ref> The [[court clerk|Clerk of the Court]], currently Blake A. Hawthorne, is appointed by the Justices and serves a four-year term, which is renewable.[https://www.txcourts.gov/supreme/about-the-court/clerks-office/] \n\n===Election of members of the Court and appointments ===\n[[File:TexasSupremeCourtBuilding.JPG|thumb|Texas Supreme Court Building]]\nAll members of the court are elected to six-year terms in statewide partisan [[elections in Texas|elections]]. Because their terms are staggered, only a subset of justices is up for re-election in any one election cycle.  When a vacancy arises, the [[Governor of Texas]] appoints a replacement, subject to Senate confirmation, to serve out the unexpired term until  December 31 after the next general election. The initial term of tenure is therefore often less than six years. Most of the current justices were originally appointed either by former [[Governor]] [[Rick Perry]] or by the current Governor of Texas, [[Greg Abbott]], who is himself a former member of the SCOTX. \n\nLike the judges on the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]], all members of the Texas Supreme Court are [[United States Republican Party|Republican]]<nowiki/>s.\n\nThe most recent appointees are Jane Bland, [[Jimmy Blacklock]], and Brett Busby.  \n\n[[J. Brett Busby|Brett Busby]] and [[Jane Bland]] are former Court of Appeals justices from Houston, whose re-election bids failed in November 2018 when Democrats won all of the judicial races. Blacklock formerly served Governor [[Greg Abbott]] as general counsel.  \n\nBlacklock replaced [[Don Willett]], who now sits on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the federal appellate court that hears appeals from federal district courts in Texas.

It was previously held by [[Wallace B. Jefferson]], who is now a frequent advocate before the high court on behalf of private clients, as are several other former members of the Court.  \n\nThe other eight position numbers have no special significance except for identification purposes on the ballot. Informally, justices are ranked by seniority, and their profiles appear on the Court's website in that order.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.txcourts.gov/supreme/about-the-court/justices/|title=TJB {{!}} SC {{!}} About the Court {{!}} Justices|website=www.txcourts.gov|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref> \n\nEach member of the Texas Supreme Court is elected in a statewide contest, which is a key reason why there is no representation of the minority party on the Court, even though Democrats are now well-represented at the lower levels of the judicial hierarchy, whose judges are elected from smaller appellate districts and from counties.  \n\nSingle-party control of the Court has a distorting impact on the High Court's jurisprudence, which was true when Democrats were dominant, as is true now after decades of the Republican lock on the high court. There are no liberal and conservative wings on the Court, and no swing votes. Most decisions are unanimous. Republican Governor Greg Abbott does his best to assure preservation of partisan Republican control of the judiciary. His appointees to vacancies are screened for ideological acceptability with a questionnaire that asks the candidate what U.S. Supreme Court decision they disagree with.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/organization/appointments/Abbott_Judicial_Questionnaire.pdf|title=Judicial Questionnaire|last=Governor Greg Abbott|first=|date=|website=Office of the Governor|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 23, 2019}}</ref>  \n\n===Women on the Court===\n[[Hortense Sparks Ward]], who became the first woman to pass the Texas [[bar examination|Bar Exam]] in 1910, was appointed Special Chief Justice of an [[All-Woman Supreme Court|all-female Texas Supreme Court]] 15 years later.

Court technology, and the information it carries, are sprawling topics, and Texas is a diverse state with decentralized funding and decision-making for trial court technology. JCIT provides a forum for discussion of court technology and information projects. With this forum, JCIT reaches out to external partners such as the Conference of Urban Counties, the County Information Resource Agency, Texas.gov, and TIJIS (Texas Integrated Justice Information Systems), and advises or is consulted by the Office of Court Administration on a variety of projects.\n\nThree themes consistently recur in the JCIT conversation: expansion and governance of electronic filing; the evolution and proliferation of court case management systems; and the evolution and governance of technology standards for reporting and sharing information across systems in civil, family, juvenile, and criminal justice.\n\nThe Founding Chair of JCIT from 1997\u20132009 was Peter S. Vogel, a partner at Gardere Wynne Sewell LLP in Dallas, and since 2009 the JCIT Chair has been [[Rebecca Simmons|Justice Rebecca Simmons]].\n\n== 2018 Texas Supreme Court judicial election ==\nWhile Republican incumbents suffered massive defeats in the Courts of Appeals on November 6, 2018, bringing about a switch of majorities from Republicans to Democrats in Dallas, Houston,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/GOP-Free-Zone-Republican-judges-swept-out-by-13376806.php|title=Republican judges swept out by voters in Harris County election|last=Rogers|first=Brian|date=2018-11-08|website=Houston Chronicle|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref> and Austin, the three Republican incumbents on the Texas Supreme Court who faced the entire Texas electorate in statewide races won comfortably.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Texas_Supreme_Court_elections,_2018|title=Texas Supreme Court elections, 2018|website=Ballotpedia|language=en|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref>\n\nIncumbent John Devine prevailed over his opponent R.K. Sandill, a sitting district court judge of Asian-American descent in Houston, with 53.75% of the vote and secured a second term. Justice Jeff Brown beat off a challenge by Democratic candidate Kathy Cheng (who unlike her fellow Democratic challengers did not have comparable judicial experience) with the same vote margin. The high court\u2019s most recent appointed member, Jimmy Blacklock, defeated Steven Kirkland, who like Sandill serves as a district court judge in Houston, with 53.17% of the vote. Neither Sandill nor Kirkland were up for reelection this year and are expected to remain on their respective district court benches.\n\nJustice Blacklock faced the electorate for the first time, having recently been appointed. Blacklock was Governor Abbott\u2019s replacement for Justice Don Willett, who ascended to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals before his term on the Texas Supreme Court had expired, thus creating a vacancy and an opportunity for the Governor to fill it with an already-vetted candidate of his own.\n\nAll appellate court races were clearly driven by party-line voting. That worked in favor of Republican incumbents at the statewide level as usual, but against Republican incumbents in the court of appeals, whose members are each elected from one of fourteen appellate districts. Some of those districts favored Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections, which entailed heavy Republican losses at the trial court level likewise.<ref>Texas Secretary of State 2018 General Election - Unofficial Election Results as of 11/7/2018 2:53 PM\n\nhttps://enrpages.sos.state.tx.us/public/nov06_331_state.htm?x=0&y=9589&id=472</ref>\n\nUnder the leadership of Governor Greg Abbott Texas Republicans have since moved to change the way Texas selects judges and justices in the major metropolitan jurisdictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facingsouth.org/2019/11/texas-considers-ending-judicial-elections-democrats-gain-ground|title=Texas considers ending judicial elections as Democrats gain ground|date=2019-11-06|website=Facing South|language=en|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2019/07/15/texas-partisan-judicial-elections-reform-abbott-support/|title=State leaders again want to review how Texas elects judges.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized on September 15, 1915, as an exclusively Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began on October 23, 1915.   \n  \nMore than 4,213 men served in the 87th Battalion, representing all regions of Canada, but predominantly Ontario, until&nbsp; the last few months of the&nbsp; war&nbsp; when the balance was furnished by soldiers from Quebec (included the need to form a&nbsp; francophone coy.) The Battalion earned 17  Battle Honours at a cost&nbsp; of 886 dead & 2,246 wounded, many of them wounded multiple times.  \n[[File:87th Battalion badges.jpg|thumb|Badges of the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF - Hayes-Rivet (MHR) collection]]\n\n== Unit distinctions & achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n* CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.\n* The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada. The other 2 were the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].\n* The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War. The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77th Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF. The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4th and 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF, but these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.\n* Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by [[King George V]] in 1919 as a permanent distinction in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n* 87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918. Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n* The 87th Battalion had within it\u2019s ranks 4 members who Founded/Formed CEF Battalions during WWI: BGen Frank S. Meighen (14th and 87th Bns); Col. Hercule Barre (150th Bn) ; Maj. Olivar F-J. Asselin (163rd Bn); and LCol J. V. O'Donahoe, (199th Bn)\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced and indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning August 18, 1916 in the Ypres area. Their first casualties, two wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 36 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n===  Battle of the Somme ===\nOn 10 October, 1916, the 87th Battalion was relocated to Albert area along the Ancre area and on the 21 October, attacked and took a section of Regina Trench. The first gallantry awards earned by the 87th Battalion were awarded to four members for the attack on Regina Trench, CSM W. Blaney, Sgt. J.C. Noon, Ptes J.E. Blaney, and J.D. Hunter. After some routine activities and tours along the front, on November 18, the 87th Battalion was assigned to capture a section of Desire Trench, as well as its support systems. The attack was launched from Regina Trench. It succeeded well beyond expectations, and in addition to capturing Desire, Major Franklin Hall, with 41 volunteers, with only their rifles, bayonets, grenades and 2 Lewis Guns advanced a further 500 yards and captured part of Grandcourt Trench, including taking 115 prisoners. 80 of these were taken unaided by four privates; Roy, Thompson, Garneau and Winke.  \n[[File:Plan of Attack Vimy Ridge.jpg|thumb|87th Battalion was to advance as part of the 11th Brigage, 4th Division. (2nd from top) Plan of Attack for Vimy Ridge 9 April 1917]]\n\n=== Battle of Vimy Ridge ===\nThe Battle of Vimy Ridge was a gallant yet terrible tragedy for the battalion. One Military Cross (MC), 14 Military Medals(MM), and 1 Mentioned in Dispatches (MID) were awarded to members of the 87th Bn .Total casualties for the Battle were 315 all ranks out of an attacking force of 520 (60.6%). 10 of the 11 officers who led the first wave, were casualties.<ref>Soldiers Of The Queen The Canadian Grenadier Guards 1859-2009, BGen (retired) William J. Patterson, OMM, CD</ref>\n\n\"The 4th Canadian Division's principal objective was Hill 145, the highest and most important feature of the whole Ridge. Once taken, its summit would give the Canadians a commanding view of German rearward defences. Because of its importance, the Germans had fortified Hill 145 with well-wired trenches and a series of deep dug-outs beneath its rear slope. The brigades of the 4th Division were hampered by fire from the Pimple, the other prominent height, which inflicted costly losses on the advancing waves of infantry.\"<ref>https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/history/first-world-war/road-to-vimy-ridge/vimy5</ref> \n\nFrom the start of the battle, progress on the right was slow because, for a time, the centre had practically collapsed.The 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) were in the first wave but for some reason, a section of enemy trench barely a hundred metres in front of them had been left untouched by the artillery bombardment. Subsequently, the lead assault company was virtually wiped out within the first few minutes. This caused a delay of the other guardsmen so that they lost the barrage, and those who tried to continue the advance were cut down by German machine gunners firing from positions of relative safety in the untouched trenches.   \n\n\"The 87th Battalion War diaries reports that six of the seven officers leading the 87th into battle were killed or wounded within the first hours. \"Word had been received that Captain Harry Sare, MID (Officer Commanding the Assault), had been shot through the head with a bullet and could no longer carry on. Lieutenant Yonkles had also been hit in the left arm, Majors Joy and Ross and Lieut. Savage had been killed, and Lieut. Sinclair badly wounded, leaving Lieutenant Hannaford the only available officer of those who went over.\" \nThe 87th Battalion first day casualties for April 9th at Vimy Ridge were 7 officers & 149 men killed; 4 officers and 155 men wounded with most having occurred have occurred within the first few minutes of the battle.\n\n==Officers Commanding==\n*Lieut.-Col.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized on September 15, 1915, as an exclusively Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began on October 23, 1915.   \n  \nMore than 4,213 men served in the 87th Battalion, representing all regions of Canada, but predominantly Ontario, until&nbsp; the last few months of the&nbsp; war&nbsp; when the balance was furnished by soldiers from Quebec (included the need to form a&nbsp; francophone coy.) The Battalion earned 17  Battle Honours at a cost&nbsp; of 886 dead & 2,246 wounded, many of them wounded multiple times.  \n[[File:87th Battalion badges.jpg|thumb|Badges of the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF - Hayes-Rivet (MHR) collection]]\n\n== Unit distinctions & achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n* CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.\n* The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada. The other 2 were the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].\n* The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War. The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77th Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF. The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4th and 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF, but these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.\n* Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by [[King George V]] in 1919 as a permanent distinction in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n* 87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918. Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n* The 87th Battalion had within it\u2019s ranks 4 members who Founded/Formed CEF Battalions during WWI: BGen Frank S. Meighen (14th and 87th Bns); Col. Hercule Barre (150th Bn) ; Maj. Olivar F-J. Asselin (163rd Bn); and LCol J. V. O'Donahoe, (199th Bn)\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced and indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning August 18, 1916 in the Ypres area. Their first casualties, two wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 36 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n===  Battle of the Somme ===\nOn 10 October, 1916, the 87th Battalion was relocated to Albert area along the Ancre area and on the 21 October, attacked and took a section of Regina Trench. The first gallantry awards earned by the 87th Battalion were awarded to four members for the attack on Regina Trench, CSM W. Blaney, Sgt. J.C. Noon, Ptes J.E. Blaney, and J.D. Hunter. After some routine activities and tours along the front, on November 18, the 87th Battalion was assigned to capture a section of Desire Trench, as well as its support systems. The attack was launched from Regina Trench. It succeeded well beyond expectations, and in addition to capturing Desire, Major Franklin Hall, with 41 volunteers, with only their rifles, bayonets, grenades and 2 Lewis Guns advanced a further 500 yards and captured part of Grandcourt Trench, including taking 115 prisoners. 80 of these were taken unaided by four privates; Roy, Thompson, Garneau and Winke.  \n[[File:Plan of Attack Vimy Ridge.jpg|thumb|87th Battalion was to advance as part of the 11th Brigage, 4th Division. (2nd from top) Plan of Attack for Vimy Ridge 9 April 1917]]\n\n=== Battle of Vimy Ridge ===\nThe Battle of Vimy Ridge was a gallant yet terrible tragedy for the battalion. One Military Cross (MC), 14 Military Medals(MM), and 1 Mentioned in Dispatches (MID) were awarded to members of the 87th Bn .Total casualties for the Battle were 315 all ranks out of an attacking force of 520 (60.6%). 10 of the 11 officers who led the first wave, were casualties.<ref>Soldiers Of The Queen The Canadian Grenadier Guards 1859-2009, BGen (retired) William J. Patterson, OMM, CD</ref>\n\n\"The 4th Canadian Division's principal objective was Hill 145, the highest and most important feature of the whole Ridge. Once taken, its summit would give the Canadians a commanding view of German rearward defences. Because of its importance, the Germans had fortified Hill 145 with well-wired trenches and a series of deep dug-outs beneath its rear slope. The brigades of the 4th Division were hampered by fire from the Pimple, the other prominent height, which inflicted costly losses on the advancing waves of infantry.\"<ref>https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/history/first-world-war/road-to-vimy-ridge/vimy5</ref> \n\nFrom the start of the battle, progress on the right was slow because, for a time, the centre had practically collapsed.The 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) were in the first wave but for some reason, a section of enemy trench barely a hundred metres in front of them had been left untouched by the artillery bombardment. Subsequently, the lead assault company was virtually wiped out within the first few minutes. This caused a delay of the other guardsmen so that they lost the barrage, and those who tried to continue the advance were cut down by German machine gunners firing from positions of relative safety in the untouched trenches.   \n\n\"The 87th Battalion War diaries reports that six of the seven officers leading the 87th into battle were killed or wounded within the first hours. \"Word had been received that Captain Harry Sare, MID (Officer Commanding the Assault), had been shot through the head with a bullet and could no longer carry on. Lieutenant Yonkles had also been hit in the left arm, Majors Joy and Ross and Lieut. Savage had been killed, and Lieut. Sinclair badly wounded, leaving Lieutenant Hannaford the only available officer of those who went over.\" \nThe 87th Battalion first day casualties for April 9th at Vimy Ridge were 7 officers & 149 men killed; 4 officers and 155 men wounded with most having occurred have occurred within the first few minutes of the battle.\n\n==Officers Commanding==\n*Lieut.-Col.

I-787 is the main highway for those traveling into and out of downtown [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. The southern terminus is, per New York traffic data, at the [[toll plaza]] for [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]]) exit&nbsp;23 southwest of downtown Albany. However, current signage indicates the terminus as along I-787's ramp to [[U.S. Route 9W|US 9W]]. The northern terminus of the route is unclear, with some sources placing the terminus at 8th Street in [[Troy, New York|Troy]], creating an overlap with [[New York State Route&nbsp;7]] (NY&nbsp;7) between [[Green Island, New York|Green Island]] and Troy. Other documents show I-787 as terminating at its interchange with NY&nbsp;7 and [[New York State Route 787|NY&nbsp;787]] in the town of [[Colonie, New York|Colonie]]. Regardless, the route is {{convert|10.16|mi|km|2}} long if extended to Troy, or {{convert|9.55|mi|km|2}} excluding the NY&nbsp;7 overlap.\n\nNorth of NY&nbsp;7, I-787 continues north as [[New York State Route 787|NY&nbsp;787]] to the city of [[Cohoes, New York|Cohoes]].\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:2015-08-20 14 59 23 View north from the south end of Interstate 787 at the junction with U.S. Route 9W in Albany, New York.jpg|thumb|left|View from just past the toll barriers at the south end of I-787, looking north at Exit 1.]]\nI-787 officially begins at the [[toll barrier]] for I-87/Thruway exit&nbsp;23; however, a short {{convert|0.57|mi|km|2|sing=on}} spur between [[U.S. Route&nbsp;9W]] (US&nbsp;9W) and the interchange connecting I-787 to the Thruway, designated as '''New York State Route 912S''' ('''NY&nbsp;912S'''), an unsigned [[reference route (New York)|reference route]], is signed as I-787.<ref name=\"2008tdr\" /><ref name=\"ne\" /> At the east end of the interchange (exit&nbsp;1) with I-87, I-787 northbound merges with NY&nbsp;912S, progressing due east for a short distance before curving to the northeast ahead of the [[Delaware and Hudson Railway]] mainline near exit&nbsp;2 ([[New York State Route 32|NY&nbsp;32]]). Past NY&nbsp;32, I-787 parallels the [[Hudson River]] as it heads northward into the heart of downtown Albany, featuring a pair of exits with [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]] and [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]] at a massive interchange southeast of the [[Empire State Plaza]] on the west bank of the Hudson.\n\nNorth of downtown Albany, I-787 interchanges with [[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]] at exit&nbsp;5 prior to crossing into [[Menands, New York|Menands]] and meeting NY&nbsp;32 once more at exit&nbsp;6 by way of a [[trumpet interchange]].

In [[Watervliet, New York|Watervliet]], I-787 has one interchange with 23rd Street (exit&nbsp;8) before reaching another near-cloverleaf interchange with NY&nbsp;7 and NY&nbsp;787 (exit&nbsp;9) in Green Island. \n[[File:I787US9Split.jpg|thumb|right|I-787 southbound at exit 4B  (US 9 north).]]\nI-787's alignment after exit 9 is unclear.

I-787 is the main highway for those traveling into and out of downtown [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. The southern terminus is, per New York traffic data, at the [[toll plaza]] for [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]]) exit&nbsp;23 southwest of downtown Albany. However, current signage indicates the terminus as along I-787's ramp to [[U.S. Route 9W|US 9W]]. The northern terminus of the route is unclear, with some sources placing the terminus at 8th Street in [[Troy, New York|Troy]], creating an overlap with [[New York State Route&nbsp;7]] (NY&nbsp;7) between [[Green Island, New York|Green Island]] and Troy. Other documents show I-787 as terminating at its interchange with NY&nbsp;7 and [[New York State Route 787|NY&nbsp;787]] in the town of [[Colonie, New York|Colonie]].

Past NY&nbsp;32, I-787 parallels the [[Hudson River]] as it heads northward into the heart of downtown Albany, featuring a pair of exits with [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]] and [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]] at a massive interchange southeast of the [[Empire State Plaza]] on the west bank of the Hudson.\n\nNorth of downtown Albany, I-787 interchanges with [[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]] at exit&nbsp;5 prior to crossing into [[Menands, New York|Menands]] and meeting NY&nbsp;32 once more at exit&nbsp;6 by way of a [[trumpet interchange]].

Those potential future plans included the conversion of the entirety of the interstate to an at-grade urban arterial.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://787waterfrontstudy.blogspot.com/|title=I-787/Hudson Waterfront Corridor Study|website=787waterfrontstudy.blogspot.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref>\n\n==Exit list==\n{{jcttop|exit|state=NY|county=Albany|length_ref=<ref name=\"2008tdr\"/>}}\n{{NYint|exit\n|location=Albany\n|lspan=7\n|mile=0.00\n|exit=1\n|type=toll\n|road={{jct|state=NY|I|87|NYST||city1=New York City|location2=[[Mass Pike]]|city3=Buffalo|location4=[[Montreal]]}}\n|notes=Exit 23 on I-87 / Thruway\n}}\n{{NYint|exit\n|mile=0.32\n|exit=\u2013\n|road={{jct|state=NY|US|9W|city1=Albany}}\n|notes=Access via {{convert|0.57|mi}} of [[New York State Route 912S|NY 912S]]<ref name=2008tdr/>\n}}\n{{NYint|exit\n|mile=0.94\n|exit=2\n|road={{jct|state=NY|NY|32|name1=South Pearl Street|location1=[[Port of Albany]]}}\n|notes=NY 32 / South Pearl Street only on southbound signage\n}}\n{{NYint|exit\n|mile=1.97\n|exit=3\n|road={{jct|state=NY|US|9|dir1=south|US|20|dir2=east|city1=Rensselaer|location2=[[Empire State Plaza|Empire Plaza]]}}\n|notes=Signed as exit 3A southbound; also serves [[Albany\u2013Rensselaer station]]\n}}\n{{NYint|exit\n|mile=2.40\n|exit=4\n|road={{jct|state=NY|US|9|US|20|dir1=north|dir2=west|name1=Clinton Street|name2=Madison Avenue|location1=[[Albany, New York|Downtown Albany]]|location2=[[Port of Albany]]}}\n|notes=Signed as exits 3B (US 20) and 4B (US 9) southbound\n}}\n{{NYint|exit\n|exit=4A\n|type=incomplete\n|mile=2.80\n|road=Colonie Street / Columbia Street\n|notes=Southbound exit only\n}}\n{{NYint|exit\n|mile=3.36\n|exit=5\n|road={{jct|state=NY|I|90|city1=Buffalo|location2=[[Boston|Boston, MA]]}}\n|notes=Exit 6A on I-90\n}}\n{{NYint|exit\n|location=Menands\n|lspan=2\n|mile=4.20\n|exit=6\n|road={{jct|state=NY|NY|32|city1=Menands}}\n}}\n{{NYint|exit\n|mile=6.27\n|exit=7\n|road={{jct|state=NY|NY|378|city1=Watervliet|city2=Loudonville|city3=Menands|city4=South Troy|city5=Troy}}\n|notes=Signed as 7E (east) and 7W (west); serves [[Hudson Valley Community College]] and [[Joseph L.
