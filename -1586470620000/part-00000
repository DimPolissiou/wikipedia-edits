[[Hilduin]], abbot (822\u201330), in 826 obtained from [[Pope Eugene II]] relics of [[St. Sebastian]] and [[St. Gregory the Great]]; he caused the relics of [[St. Godard]] and [[St. Remi]] to be transferred to the abbey; he rebuilt the church which was consecrated 27 August 841, in the presence of [[Charles the Bald]] and seventy-two prelates. The king bore the body of St. M\u00e9dard into the new basilica.  In 853 Charles the Bald presided over the Council of Soissons at Saint-Medard, in the company of fifty-one bishops.  Bishop Rothadus of Soissons was deposed, due to the malevolence of Archbishop Hincmar of Reims, but restored on orders of [[Pope Nicholas I]].<ref>Fisquet, pp. 150-154.</ref>\n\nThe church was pulled down but rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1131 by [[Pope Innocent II]], who granted those visiting the church indulgences known as \"St. M\u00e9dard's pardons\". In this abbey [[Louis the Pious]] was imprisoned in 833, and there he underwent a public penance. Among the abbots of St. M\u00e9dard's are: [[St. Arnoul]], who in 1081 became Bishop of Soissons; [[Gerald of Sauve-Majeure|St. Gerard]] (close of the eleventh century); [[Cardinal de Bernis]], made commendatory abbot of St. M\u00e9dard in 1756.\n\nThe Benedictine Abbey of Note Dame de Soissons was founded in 660 by [[Ebroin]] and his wife Leutrude. The Cistercian abbey of [[Longpont]], founded in 1131, counted among its monks the theologian [[Pierre Cantor]], who died in 1197, and Blessed [[John de Montmirail]] (1167\u20131217), who abandoned the court of [[Phillipe-Auguste]] in order to become a monk.\n\nThe abbey of St. Vincent at Laon was founded in 580 by Queen Brunehaut. Among its earlier monks were: St. Gobain, who, through love of solitude, retired to a desert place near Oise and was slain there; St. Chagnoaldus, afterward Bishop of Laon, who wished to die in his monastery; St. Humbert, first abbot of Maroilles in Hainaut. The abbey adopted the rule of St. Benedict. It was reformed in 961 by Blessed Malcaleine, a Scotchman, abbot of St. Michael at Thierache, and in 1643 by the [[Benedictines]] of St. Maur. Among the abbots of St. Vincent were: St. Gerard (close of the eleventh century), who wrote the history of St. Adelard, abbot of Corde; Jean de Nouelles (d. 1396), who wrote a history of the world, and began the cartulary of his monastery. The Abbey of St. John at Laon was founded in 650 by St. Salaberga, who built seven churches there; she was its first abbess; St. Austruda (d. 688) succeeded her. In 1128 the abbey became a Benedictine monastery. The Abbey of Nogent sous Coucy was founded in 1076 by Alb\u00e9ric, Lord of Coucy. Among its abbots were St. Geoffroy (end of the eleventh century) and the historian Guibert de Nogent, who died in 1112 and whose autobiography, \"De Vita Sua\" is one of the most interesting documents of the century. Under the title \"Gesta Dei per Francos\" he wrote an account of the First Crusade.\n\nThe Abbey of Cuissy in the Diocese of Laon was founded in 1116 by Blessed [[Lucas de Roucy]], dean of Laon, and followed the rule of [[Premonstratensians]]. In the Diocese of Soissons, the Premonstratensians had the abbeys: Chartreuve, Valsery, [[Saint-Yved de Braine]], Villers Cotterets, Val Secret, Vauchr\u00e9tien, Lieurestaur\u00e9.\n\nThe portion of the ancient [[Diocese of Noyon]] within the jurisdiction of the present Diocese of Soissons includes the town, St-Quentin (Augusta Vermanduorum) where St-Quentin was martyred under Diocletian. It was the chief town of a diocese until 532, when St. M\u00e9dard, the titular, removed the see to Noyon. Abbott Fulrade built the Church of St-Quentin in the eighth century and Pope Stephan II blessed it (816). From the time of Charles Martel until 771, and again from 844 the abbots of St-Quentin were laymen and counts of Vermandois. The abbey church became the [[Saint-Quentin Basilica]], built from the 12th to 15th centuries. During the Middle Ages a distinct type of religious architecture sprang up in Soissons; Eug\u00e9ne Lef\u00e8vre Pontalis has recently brought out a work dealing with its artistic affiliations. After investigation Canon Bauxin concludes that the cathedral of Laon, as it exists, is not the one consecrated in 1114 and visited by Innocent II in 1132; that was the restored ancient Romanesque building; the present one was built 1150\u20131225. Louyis d'Outremer (936), Robert the Pious (996), and [[Philip I of France|Philip I]] (1059) were anointed in Notre Dame de Laon; in the twelfth century Hermann, Abbot of St. Martin's of Tournai, wrote a volume on the miracles of Notre Dame of Laon. The H\u00f4tel-Dieu of Laon, once known as H\u00f4tellerie Notre Dame, was founded in 1019 by the Laon chapter. The H\u00f4tel-Dieu of Ch\u00e2teau Thierry was founded in 1304 by Jeanne, wife of Philip the Fair.\n\n==Saints==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nThe following are honoured as connected with the religious history of the diocese: [[St. Marculfus]], Abbot of [[Nanteuil]] (sixth century) in the [[Diocese of Coutances]], whose relics, transferred to [[Corbeny]] in the [[Diocese of Laon]], were visited by the kings of France who, after their anointing at Reims, were wont to go to the tomb of St. Marculfus to cure the [[king's evil]].\n\nAmong the natives of the diocese may be mentioned: [[Petrus Ramus]] (1515\u201372), [[Jean Racine]] (1639\u201399), [[La Fontaine]] (1621\u201395), Dom [[Luc d'Achery]] (1609\u20131685), [[Charlevoix]] (1683\u20131761), [[Camille Desmoulins]] (1760\u20131794).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nBefore the application of the Congregations Law (1901), there were in the Diocese of Soissons Jesuits, Trinitarians, and several teaching congregations of brothers. Some congregations of women had their origin in the diocese: the Nursing and Teaching Sisters of the Child Jesus, with mother-house at Soissons, founded in 1714 by the Madame Brulard de Genlis; the Sisters of Notre Dame de Bon Secours, a nursing and teaching order, founded in 1806, with mother-house at Charly; Sisters of Notre Dame, nursing and teaching order, with mother-house at Saint-Erme, founded in 1820 by the Abb\u00e9 Chr\u00e9tien; the Franciscan nuns of the Sacred Heart, a nursing order, founded in 1867, with mother-house at St-Quentin; the Servants of the Heart of Jesus, of whom there are two branches, the \"Marys\" who lead a contemplative life, and the \"Marthas\" who nurse the sick; they were founded at Strasburg in 1867, and brought to St-Quentin after the war of 1870\u20131.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Councils of Soissons]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Books==\n===Reference works===\n*{{cite book|last=Gams|first=Pius Bonifatius |title=Series episcoporum Ecclesiae catholicae: quotquot innotuerunt a beato Petro apostolo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=os9DAQAAMAAJ|year=1873|publisher=Typis et Sumptibus Georgii Josephi Manz|location=Ratisbon}} (Use with caution; obsolete)\n*{{cite book|last1=Eubel|first1=Conradus (ed.)|title=Hierarchia catholica, Tomus 1|date=1913|publisher=Libreria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|edition=second|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol01eubeuoft}}  (in Latin) \n*{{cite book|last1=Eubel|first1=Conradus (ed.)|title=Hierarchia catholica, Tomus 2|date=1914|publisher=Libreria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|edition=second|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol02eubeuoft}} (in Latin) \n*{{cite book|last1=Eubel|first1=Conradus (ed.)|last2=Gulik|first2=Guilelmus|title=Hierarchia catholica, Tomus 3|date=1923|publisher=Libreria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|edition=second|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol02eubeuoft}} \n*{{cite book|last1=Gauchat|first1=Patritius (Patrice)|title=Hierarchia catholica  IV (1592-1667)|date=1935|publisher=Libraria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol04eubeuoft|accessdate=2016-07-06}} \n*{{cite book|last1=Ritzler|first1=Remigius|last2=Sefrin|first2=Pirminus|title=Hierarchia catholica medii et recentis aevi  V (1667-1730)|date=1952|publisher=Messagero di S.

According to [[Louis Duchesne]], the establishment of a see at Soissons dates from about 300.\n\nThe territory of Soissons and Laon played an important political part under the [[Merovingians]]. After the death of [[Clovis I|Clovis]] (511), Soissons was the capital of one of the four kingdoms into which his states were divided. The [[Kingdom of Soissons]], which ceased to exist in 558, when [[Clotaire I]] reunited all the [[Franks|Frankish]] states, came into being again in 561 when the death of Clotaire led to a redivision of the territory. It finally disappeared in 613 when the Frankish lands were once more reunited under [[Clotaire II]].\n\nIt was re-established by the [[Concordat of 1802]] as suffragan of [[Paris]], but in 1821 it became [[suffragan]] of [[Reims]].

[[Hilduin]], abbot (822\u201330) in 826 obtained from [[Pope Eugene II]] relics of [[St. Sebastian]] and [[St. Gregory the Great]]; he caused the relics of [[St. Godard]] and [[St. Remi]] to be transferred to the abbey; he rebuilt the church which was consecrated 27 August, 841, in the presence of [[Charles the Bald]] and seventy-two prelates. The king bore the body of St. M\u00e9dard into the new basilica.  In 853 Charles the Bald presided over the Council of Soissons at Saint-Medard, in the company of fifty-one bishops.  Bishop Rothadus of Soissons was deposed, due to the malevolence of Archbishop Hincmar of Reims, but restored on orders of [[Pope Nicholas I]].<ref>Fisquet, pp. 150-154.</ref>\n\nThe church was pulled down but rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1131 by [[Pope Innocent II]], who granted those visiting the church indulgences known as \"St. M\u00e9dard's pardons\". In this abbey [[Louis the Pious]] was imprisoned in 833, and there he underwent a public penance. Among the abbots of St. M\u00e9dard's are: [[St. Arnoul]], who in 1081 became Bishop of Soissons; [[Gerald of Sauve-Majeure|St. Gerard]] (close of the eleventh century); [[Cardinal de Bernis]], made commendatory abbot of St. M\u00e9dard in 1756.\n\nThe Benedictine Abbey of Note Dame de Soissons was founded in 660 by [[Ebroin]] and his wife Leutrude. The Cistercian abbey of [[Longpont]], founded in 1131, counted among its monks the theologian [[Pierre Cantor]], who died in 1197, and Blessed [[John de Montmirail]] (1167\u20131217), who abandoned the court of [[Phillipe-Auguste]] in order to become a monk.\n\nThe abbey of St. Vincent at Laon was founded in 580 by Queen Brunehaut. Among its earlier monks were: St. Gobain, who, through love of solitude, retired to a desert place near Oise and was slain there; St. Chagnoaldus, afterward Bishop of Laon, who wished to die in his monastery; St. Humbert, first abbot of Maroilles in Hainaut. The abbey adopted the rule of St. Benedict. It was reformed in 961 by Blessed Malcaleine, a Scotchman, abbot of St. Michael at Thierache, and in 1643 by the Benedictines of St. Maur. Among the abbots of St. Vincent were: St. Gerard (close of the eleventh century), who wrote the history of St. Adelard, abbot of Corde; Jean de Nouelles (d. 1396), who wrote a history of the world, and began the cartulary of his monastery. The Abbey of St. John at Laon was founded in 650 by St. Salaberga, who built seven churches there; she was its first abbess; St. Austruda (d. 688) succeeded her. In 1128 the abbey became a Benedictine monastery. The Abbey of Nogent sous Coucy was founded in 1076 by Alb\u00e9ric, Lord of Coucy. Among its abbots were St. Geoffroy (end of the eleventh century) and the historian Guibert de Nogent, who died in 1112, and whose autobiography, \"De Vita Sua\" is one of the most interesting documents of the century. Under the title \"Gesta Dei per Francos\" he wrote an account of the First Crusade.\n\nThe Abbey of Cuissy in the Diocese of Laon was founded in 1116 by Blessed [[Lucas de Roucy]], dean of Laon, and followed the rule of [[Premonstratensians]]. In the Diocese of Soissons, the Premonstratensians had the abbeys: Chartreuve, Valsery, [[Saint-Yved de Braine]], Villers Cotterets, Val Secret, Vauchr\u00e9tien, Lieurestaur\u00e9.\n\nThe portion of the ancient [[Diocese of Noyon]] within the jurisdiction of the present Diocese of Soissons includes the town, St-Quentin (Augusta Vermanduorum) where St-Quentin was martyred under Diocletian. It was the chief town of a diocese until 532, when St. M\u00e9dard, the titular, removed the see to Noyon. Abbott Fulrade built the Church of St-Quentin in the eighth century and Pope Stephan II blessed it (816). From the time of Charles Martel until 771, and again from 844 the abbots of St-Quentin were laymen and counts of Vermandois. The abbey church became the [[Saint-Quentin Basilica]], built from the 12th to 15th centuries. During the Middle Ages a distinct type of religious architecture sprang up in Soissons; Eug\u00e9ne Lef\u00e8vre Pontalis has recently brought out a work dealing with its artistic affiliations. After investigation Canon Bauxin concludes that the cathedral of Laon, as it exists, is not the one consecrated in 1114 and visited by Innocent II in 1132; that was the restored ancient Romanesque building; the present one was built 1150\u20131225. Louyis d'Outremer (936), Robert the Pious (996), [[Philip I of France|Philip I]] (1059) were anointed in Notre Dame de Laon; in the twelfth century Hermann, Abbot of St. Martin's of Tournai, wrote a volume on the miracles of Notre Dame of Laon. The H\u00f4tel-Dieu of Laon, once known as H\u00f4tellerie Notre Dame, was founded in 1019 by the Laon chapter. The H\u00f4tel-Dieu of Ch\u00e2teau Thierry was founded in 1304 by Jeanne, wife of Philip the Fair.\n\n==Saints==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nThe following are honoured as connected with the religious history of the diocese: [[St. Marculfus]], Abbot of [[Nanteuil]] (sixth century) in the [[Diocese of Coutances]], whose relics, transferred to [[Corbeny]] in the [[Diocese of Laon]], were visited by the kings of France who, after their anointing at Reims, were wont to go to the tomb of St. Marculfus to cure the [[king's evil]].\n\nAmong the natives of the diocese may be mentioned: [[Petrus Ramus]] (1515\u201372), [[Jean Racine]] (1639\u201399), [[La Fontaine]] (1621\u201395), Dom [[Luc d'Achery]] (1609\u20131685), [[Charlevoix]] (1683\u20131761), [[Camille Desmoulins]] (1760\u20131794).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nBefore the application of the Congregations Law (1901), there were in the Diocese of Soissons Jesuits, Trinitarians, and several teaching congregations of brothers. Some congregations of women had their origin in the diocese: the Nursing and Teaching Sisters of the Child Jesus, with mother-house at Soissons, founded in 1714 by the Madame Brulard de Genlis; the Sisters of Notre Dame de Bon Secours, a nursing and teaching order, founded in 1806, with mother-house at Charly; Sisters of Notre Dame, nursing and teaching order, with mother-house at Saint-Erme, founded in 1820 by the Abb\u00e9 Chr\u00e9tien; the Franciscan nuns of the Sacred Heart, a nursing order, founded in 1867, with mother-house at St-Quentin; the Servants of the Heart of Jesus, of whom there are two branches, the \"Marys\" who lead a contemplative life, and the \"Marthas\" who nurse the sick; they were founded at Strasburg in 1867, and brought to St-Quentin after the war of 1870\u20131.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Councils of Soissons]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Books==\n===Reference works===\n*{{cite book|last=Gams|first=Pius Bonifatius |title=Series episcoporum Ecclesiae catholicae: quotquot innotuerunt a beato Petro apostolo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=os9DAQAAMAAJ|year=1873|publisher=Typis et Sumptibus Georgii Josephi Manz|location=Ratisbon}} (Use with caution; obsolete)\n*{{cite book|last1=Eubel|first1=Conradus (ed.)|title=Hierarchia catholica, Tomus 1|date=1913|publisher=Libreria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|edition=second|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol01eubeuoft}}  (in Latin) \n*{{cite book|last1=Eubel|first1=Conradus (ed.)|title=Hierarchia catholica, Tomus 2|date=1914|publisher=Libreria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|edition=second|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol02eubeuoft}} (in Latin) \n*{{cite book|last1=Eubel|first1=Conradus (ed.)|last2=Gulik|first2=Guilelmus|title=Hierarchia catholica, Tomus 3|date=1923|publisher=Libreria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|edition=second|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol02eubeuoft}} \n*{{cite book|last1=Gauchat|first1=Patritius (Patrice)|title=Hierarchia catholica  IV (1592-1667)|date=1935|publisher=Libraria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol04eubeuoft|accessdate=2016-07-06}} \n*{{cite book|last1=Ritzler|first1=Remigius|last2=Sefrin|first2=Pirminus|title=Hierarchia catholica medii et recentis aevi  V (1667-1730)|date=1952|publisher=Messagero di S.

Archeological evidence shows that wine was produced throughout ancient Israel. The traditional and religious use of wine continued within the [[Jewish diaspora]] community. In the United States, kosher wines came to be associated with [[Sweetness of wine|sweet]] [[Concord (grape)|Concord]] wines produced by wineries founded by Jewish immigrants to [[New York (wine)|New York]].\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, a trend towards producing dry, premium-quality kosher wines began with the revival of the [[Israeli wine]] industry.

Grape juice is also suitable on these occasions. If no wine or grape juice is present on Shabbat, the blessing over [[challah]] suffices.\n\n[[File:Rabbi in a kosher wine shop 8d21905v.jpg|thumb|Rabbi in a kosher wine shop in [[New York City]], circa 1942]]\n\nAt [[Jewish view of marriage|Jewish marriages]], [[Brit milah|circumcisions]], and at [[Redemption of First-born]] ceremonies, the obligatory blessing of ''Borei Pri HaGafen'' (\"Blessed are you O Lord, Who created the fruit of the vine\") is almost always recited over kosher wine (or grape juice).\n\nAccording to the teachings of the [[Midrash]], the forbidden fruit that [[Eve]] ate and which she gave to [[Adam]] was the grape from which wine is derived, though others contest this and say that it was in fact a fig.<ref>[[Rashi]] On Genesis 3:7</ref><ref>Rabbi Nehemiah in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] Tractate Berachot 40a and Sanhedrin 70b</ref> The capacity of wine to cause drunkenness with its consequent loosening of inhibitions is described by the ancient rabbis in Hebrew as ''nichnas yayin, yatza sod'' (\"wine enters, [and one's personal] secret[s] exit\"), similar to the Latin \"[[in vino veritas]]\".

It is not known whence the ancient Jewish authorities derived this claim; there are no records concerning \"boiled wine\" and its fitness for use in the cults of any of the religions of the peoples surrounding ancient Israel. Indeed, in [[Orthodox Christianity]], it is common to add boiling water to the [[sacramental wine]]. Another opinion holds that mevushal wine was not included in the rabbinic edict against drinking wine touched by an idolater simply because such wine was uncommon in those times.\n\nMevushal wine is frequently used in kosher restaurants and by kosher caterers so as to allow the wine to be handled by non-Jewish or non-observant waiters.\n\nThe process of fully boiling a wine kills off most of the fine mold on the grapes, and greatly alters the [[tannin (wine)|tannin]]s and flavors of the wine. Therefore, great care is taken to satisfy the legal requirements while exposing the wine to as little heat as necessary. There is significant disagreement between halachic deciders as to the precise temperature a wine must reach to be considered mevushal, ranging from 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) to 194\u00b0F (90\u00b0C). (At this temperature, the wine is not at a rolling boil, but it is cooking, in the sense that it will evaporate much more quickly than usual.)

Generally, they will attend the winery to physically tip the fruit into the crush, and operate the pasteurization equipment. Once the wine emerges from the process, it can be handled and aged in the normal fashion.\n\n===According to Conservative Judaism===\nIn the 1960s, the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] approved a ''[[responsum]]'' (\"legal ruling\") by Rabbi Israel Silverman on this subject. Silverman noted that some classical Jewish authorities believed that Christians are not considered idolaters, and that their products cannot be considered forbidden in this regard. He also noted that most winemaking in the United States is fully automated. Based on 15th\u201319th century precedents in the ''[[responsa]]'' literature, he concluded that wines manufactured by this automated process may not be classified as wine \"manufactured by gentiles\", and thus are not prohibited by Jewish law. This ''responsum'' makes no attempt to change ''halakhah'' in any way, but rather argues that most American wine, made in an automated fashion, is already kosher by traditional halakhic standards. Some criticism was later made against this ''[[teshuvah]]'', because (a) some wines are not made by automated processes but rather, at least in some steps, by hand, and (b) on rare occasions non-kosher fining ingredients are used in wine preparation. Silverman later retracted his position.\n\nA later ''responsum'' on this subject was written by Rabbi [[Elliot N. Dorff]] and also accepted by the CJLS.<ref>[https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/assets/public/halakhah/teshuvot/19861990/dorff_wines.pdf Elliot Dorff, \"On the Use of All Wines\" YD 123:1.1985] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222083350/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19861990/dorff_wines.pdf |date=2009-12-22 }}</ref> Dorff noted that not all wines are made by automated processes, and thus the reasoning behind Silverman's responsum was not conclusively reliable in all cases. On the other hand, Dorff points out that even if we can avoid the issue of \"wine handled by a gentile\", there is a separate prohibition against wine produced from wineries owned by a gentile, in which case automation is irrelevant, and all non-certified wines are prohibited. Therefore, he explored the possibility to change the halacha, arguing that the prohibition no longer applies. He cites rabbinic thought on Jewish views of Christians, also finding that most ''[[Posek|poskim]]'' refused to consign Christians to the status of idolater. Dorff then critiqued the traditional halakhic argument that avoiding such wine would prevent [[interfaith marriage|intermarriage]]. Dorff asserted, however, that those who were strict about the laws of ''kashrut'' were not likely to intermarry, and those that did not follow the laws would not care if a wine has a ''[[heksher]]'' or not. He also noted that a number of non-kosher ingredients may be used in the manufacturing process, including animal blood.\n\nDorff concluded a number of points including that there is no reason to believe that the production of such wines is conducted as part of pagan (or indeed, ''any'') religious practice. Most wines have no non-kosher ingredients whatsoever. Some wines use a non-kosher ingredient as part of a fining process, but not as an ingredient in the wine as such. Dorff noted that material from this matter is not intended to infiltrate the wine product. The inclusion of any non-kosher ingredient within the wine occurs by accident, and in such minute quantities that the ingredient is nullified. All wines made in the US and Canada may be considered kosher, regardless of whether or not their production is subject to rabbinical supervision. Many foods once considered forbidden if produced by non-Jews (such as [[wheat]] and oil products) were eventually declared kosher. Based on the above points, Dorff's responsum extends this same ruling to wine and other grape-products.\n\nHowever, this teshuvah also notes that this is a lenient view. Some Conservative rabbis disagree with it, e.g. [[Isaac Klein]]. As such Dorff's teshuvah states that synagogues should hold themselves to a stricter standard so that all in the Jewish community will view the synagogue's kitchen as fully kosher. As such, Conservative synagogues are encouraged to use only wines with a heksher, and preferably wines from Israel.\n\n==Regional kosher wine consumption==\n[[File:Yarden wine israel.jpg|thumb|upright|Photo of Yarden wine bottle from Israel, 2007]]\n\n===United States===\nThe United States of America contains roughly 40% of the Jewish population of the world, and most US wine stores, particularly in the [[Northeast United States|Northeast]], have a small kosher section.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nHistorically, kosher wine has been associated in the US with the [[Manischewitz]] brand, which produce a sweetened wine with a distinctive taste, made of [[labrusca]] rather than [[vitis vinifera]] grapes.

With ''[[Mortadelo y Filem\u00f3n]]'', they are the most popular and most translated Spanish comic books. Their name is derived from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''zipizape'', meaning \"turmoil\" or \"chaos.\"\n\nZipi and Zape Zapatilla are two young [[twin]]s who do poorly in school. Mischievous and energetic, they are fans of [[soccer]]. They are distinguished solely by their hair color: Zipi is blond, Zape black-haired. Other featured characters are their father, ''Don Pantuflo Zapatilla'', a professor of [[Philately]] and [[Colombophilia]] (''pantuflo/a'' and ''zapatilla'' are both Spanish names for [[slipper]]s); their mother, the hard-pressed ''Do\u00f1a Jaimita''; ''Don Minervo'', their strict teacher; ''Peloto'', the teacher\u2019s pet (and thus the twins\u2019 enemy); ''Sapient\u00edn'' (sometimes called \"Pitagorin\", as a reference to [[Pithagoras]]), their genius cousin and ''Pepe and Felisa Pl\u00f3mez'', the extremely annoying friends of their parents, whose undesirable visits they try to avoid or cut short.\n\nTheir stories are usually short, about one to eight pages long, but occasionally some are longer, about 44 or 48 pages, like \"El tonel del tiempo\" (The barrel of time) o \"El laboratorio secreto\" (The secret laboratory). They are humorous, based on the twins antics and their effects, since often they backfire spectacularly, including popular culture elements like [[extraterrestrial life in popular culture|aliens]] and [[mad scientist]]s.\n\n==Publication history==\nEscobar's stories were published by Editorial Bruguera in the ''[[Pulgarcito (Spain)|Pulgarcito]]'' magazine, which contained several comic strips. They later got their own magazine, ''ZipiZape'', which also contained several comic strips apart from the title one. The strips were later compiled in softcover and hardcover albums. When Bruguera went bankrupt, its catalog was bought by Ediciones B, the current owners of the characters rights.

With ''[[Mortadelo y Filem\u00f3n]]'', they are the most popular and most translated Spanish comic books. Their name is derived from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''zipizape'', meaning \"turmoil\" or \"chaos.\"\n\nZipi and Zape Zapatilla are two young [[twin]]s who do poorly in school. Mischievous and energetic, they are fans of [[soccer]]. They are distinguished solely by their hair color: Zipi is blond, Zape black-haired. Other featured characters are their father, ''Don Pantuflo Zapatilla'', a professor of [[Philately]] and [[Colombophilia]] (''pantuflo/a'' and ''zapatilla'' are both Spanish names for [[slipper]]s); their mother, the hard-pressed ''Do\u00f1a Jaimita''; ''Don Minervo'', their strict teacher; ''Peloto'', the teacher\u2019s pet (and thus the twins\u2019 enemy); ''Sapient\u00edn'' (sometimes called \"Pitagorin\", as a reference to [[Pithagoras]]), their genius cousin and ''Pepe and Felisa Pl\u00f3mez'', the extremely annoying friends of their parents, whose undesirable visits they try to avoid or cut short.\n\nTheir stories are usually short, about one to eight pages long, but occasionally some are longer, about 44 or 48 pages, like \"El tonel del tiempo\" (The barrel of time) o \"El laboratorio secreto\" (The secret laboratory). They are humorous, based on the twins antics and their effects, since often they backfire spectacularly, including popular culture elements like [[extraterrestrial life in popular culture|aliens]] and [[mad scientist]]s.\n\n==Publication history==\nEscobar's stories were published by Editorial Bruguera in the ''[[Pulgarcito (Spain)|Pulgarcito]]'' magazine, which contained several comic strips. They later got their own magazine, ''ZipiZape'', which also contained several comic strips apart from the title one. The strips were later compiled in softcover and hardcover albums. When Bruguera went bankrupt, its catalog was bought by Ediciones B, the current owners of the characters rights. These classical stories can be found in softcover under the \"Colecci\u00f3n Ol\u00e9\" label and in hardcover under the \"Super Humor\" label.\n\nThe series continues after Escobar's death, now in the hands of cartoonists [[Juan Carlos Ramis]] and [[Joaqu\u00edn Cera]] who have put them forward to the 21st century.
