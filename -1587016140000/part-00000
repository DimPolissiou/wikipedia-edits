It is the native creole language of virtually all Cape Verdeans and is used as a second creole language by the [[Cape Verdean diaspora]].\n\nThe creole has particular importance for [[creolistics]] studies since it is the oldest (still-spoken) creole.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dulce Pereira|title = Crioulos de Base Portuguesa|publisher=Caminho|date = October 2006|ISBN = 978-972-21-1822-4|quote = o [crioulo] de Cabo Verde [\u00e9] o mais antigo que se conhece|page = 24|language=pt}}</ref> It is the most widely spoken Portuguese-based creole language.\n\n== Name ==\nThe correct designation of this creole is Cape Verdean Creole. However, in everyday usage the creole is simply called {{lang|kea|Kriolu}} ('Creole') by its speakers. The names Cape Verdean ({{lang|pt|cabo-verdiano}} in Portuguese, {{lang|kea|kabuverdianu}} in Cape Verdean Creole) and Cape Verdean language ({{lang|pt|l\u00edngua cabo-verdiana}} in Portuguese, {{lang|kea|l\u00edngua kabuverdianu}} in the Sotavento dialect of Cape Verdean Creole and {{lang|kea|l\u00edngua kabverdian}} in the [[Barlavento Islands|Barlavento]] dialect) have been proposed for whenever the creole will be standardized.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[Image:0LivroET.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''[[Morna (music)|Mornas]] \u2013 cantigas crioulas'' by Eug\u00e9nio Tavares,<br>one of the first books with creole texts.]]\n\nThe history of Cape Verdean Creole is hard to trace due to a lack of written documentation and to ostracism during the Portuguese administration of Cape Verde.\n\nThere are presently three theories about the formation of Creole.<ref>Santos, C., \"Cultura e comunica\u00e7\u00e3o: um estudo no \u00e2mbito da sociolingu\u00edstica\"</ref> The [[monogenetic theory of pidgins|monogenetic theory]] claims that the creole was formed by the Portuguese by simplifying the Portuguese language in order to make it accessible to African slaves. That is the point of view of authors like Prudent, Waldman, Chaudenson and Lopes da Silva. Authors like Adam and Quint argue that Creole was formed by African slaves using the grammar of Western African languages and replacing the African lexicon with the Portuguese one. Linguists like [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] and [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton]] argue that Creole was formed spontaneously, not by slaves from continental Africa, but by the population born in the islands, using the grammar with which all human beings are born; this would explain how creoles located many miles apart have [[language bioprogram theory#Syntactic similarities|similar grammatical structures]], even though they have a different lexical basis.\n\nAccording to A. Carreira,<ref>Carreira, A. (1982)</ref> Cape Verdean Creole was formed from a Portuguese [[pidgin]], on the island of Santiago, starting from the 15th century. That pidgin was then transported to the west coast of Africa by the ''[[lan\u00e7ados]]''. From there, that pidgin diverged into two [[proto-Creoles]], one that was the base of all Cape Verdean Creoles, and another that was the base of the [[Guinea-Bissau Creole]].\n\nCross referencing information regarding the settlement of each island with the linguistic comparisons, it is possible to form some conjectures. The spreading of Cape Verdean Creole within the islands was done in three phases:<ref>Pereira, D. (2006)</ref>\n* In a first phase, the island of Santiago was occupied (2nd half of the 15th century), followed by Fogo (end of the 16th century).\n* In a second phase, the island of S\u00e3o Nicolau was occupied (mostly in the 2nd half of the 17th century), followed by Santo Ant\u00e3o (mostly in the 2nd half of the 17th century).\n* In a third phase, the remaining islands were occupied by settlers from the first islands: Brava was occupied by people from Fogo (mostly in the beginning of the 18th century), Boa Vista by people from S\u00e3o Nicolau and Santiago (mostly in the 1st half of the 18th century), Maio by people from Santiago and Boa Vista (mostly in the 2nd half of the 18th century), S\u00e3o Vicente by people from Santo Ant\u00e3o and S\u00e3o Nicolau (mostly in the 19th century), Sal by people from S\u00e3o Nicolau and Boa Vista (mostly in the 19th century).\n\n== Status ==\n[[Image:2006.07.28.cv.sv.Mindelo.di.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Diglossia: a sign in Portuguese prohibits the entry and presence of minors, while underneath, beer is advertised in Cape Verdean Creole.]]\n\nIn spite of Creole being the [[first language]] of nearly all the population in Cape Verde, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is still the [[official language]]. As Portuguese is used in everyday life (at school, in administration, in official acts, in relations with foreign countries, etc.), Portuguese and Cape Verdean Creole live in a state of [[diglossia]].<ref>Duarte, D.

This [[Official language|officialization]] has not yet occurred, mostly because the language is not yet [[Standard language|standardized]], for several reasons:\n* There is significant dialectal fragmentation. Speakers are reluctant to speak a variant that is not their own.\n* Absence of rules to establish which is the right form (and also the right spelling) to be adopted for each word. For example, for the word corresponding to the Portuguese word ''algibeira'' (\u201cpocket\u201d), A. Fernandes<ref>Fernandes, A. N.

For ex.: in the Santiago variant, when there are two sentences and one is subordinated to the other, there is a tense agreement in the verbs (''b\u00fa cr\u00eda p\u00e2 m\u2019 d\u00e1ba'' \u201cyou wanted me to give\u201d{{spaced ndash}}both ''cr\u00eda'' and ''d\u00e1ba'' are past tense), but some speakers do not practice it (''b\u00fa cr\u00eda p\u00e2 m\u2019 d\u00e2''{{spaced ndash}}past then present{{spaced ndash}}or ''b\u00fa cr\u00ea p\u00e2 m\u2019 d\u00e1ba''{{spaced ndash}}present then past).\n* The writing system ([[ALUPEC]]) has not been well accepted by all Creole users.\n* The language levels (formal, informal, scientific, slang, etc.) are not well differentiated yet.\n\nThat is the reason why, each speaker when speaking (or writing) uses his/her own [[dialect]], his/her own [[sociolect]] and his/her own [[idiolect]].\n\nTo overcome these problems, some Creole advocates<ref name=\"Veiga\">Veiga, M. (2000)</ref> propose the development of two standards: a North (Barlavento) standard, centered on the S\u00e3o Vicente variant, and a South (Sotavento) standard, centered on that of Santiago. If so, Creole would become a [[pluricentric language]]\n\nThere exists no complete translation of the Bible. However, the \u201cAsosiason Kabuverdianu pa Traduson di B\u00edblia\u201d was established with the goal of translating the entire Bible in Kabuverdianu-Sotaventu and Kabuverdianu-Barlaventu (see https://web.archive.org/web/20180809164421/http://aktb.org/). They have translated approximately 40% of the [[New Testament]] in the Kabuverdianu-Sotaventu, and they have published Luke and Acts. The publication of Luke has won two awards in Cape Verde.  S\u00e9rgio Frusoni translated [[Bartolomeo Rossetti]]'s version of the [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco Italian]] poem ''Er Vangelo Seconno Noantri'', which is a poem based on the [[Gospel#Canonical gospels|Four Gospels]]. Frusoni translated the poem in the S\u00e3o Vicente Creole, ''Vang\u00eale cont\u00f3d d'n\u00f4s m\u00f3da''.\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{Main|ALUPEC}}\n\nThe only writing system officially recognized by the authorities in Cape Verde is called [[ALUPEC]]. In spite of having been officially recognized by the government, the ALUPEC is neither officially nor mandatorily used, instead used only by enthusiasts.\n\nIn spite of being the only system officially recognized, the same law allows the use of alternative writing models, \u201cas long as they are presented in a systematic and scientific way\u201d. As not all users are familiarized with ALUPEC or the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], in this article a slightly different system will be used to make it easier for the reader:\n*The sound {{IPA|[s]}} will be represented in an etymological way (\u201c'''s'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''s'''\u201d, \u201c'''ss'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''ss'''\u201d, \u201c'''c'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''c'''\u201d, \u201c'''\u00e7'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''\u00e7'''\u201d) instead of ALUPEC always \u201c'''s'''\u201d.\n*The sound {{IPA|[z]}} will be represented in an etymological way (\u201c'''s'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''s'''\u201d, \u201c'''z'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''z'''\u201d) instead of ALUPEC always \u201c'''z'''\u201d.\n*The sound {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} will be represented by \u201c'''tch'''\u201d instead of ALUPEC \u201c'''tx'''\u201d.\n*The sound {{IPA|[\u0283]}} will be represented in an etymological way (\u201c'''x'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''x'''\u201d, \u201c'''ch'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''ch'''\u201d) instead of ALUPEC always \u201c'''x'''\u201d.\n*The sound {{IPA|[\u0292]}} will be represented in an etymological way (\u201c'''j'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''j'''\u201d, \u201c'''g'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''g'''\u201d) instead of ALUPEC always \u201c'''j'''\u201d.\n*The sound {{IPA|[k]}} will be represented in an etymological way (\u201c'''c'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''c'''\u201d, \u201c'''qu'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''qu'''\u201d) instead of ALUPEC always \u201c'''k'''\u201d.\n*The sound {{IPA|[\u0261]}} will be represented in an etymological way (\u201c'''g'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''g'''\u201d, \u201c'''gu'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''gu'''\u201d) instead of ALUPEC always \u201c'''g'''\u201d.\n*The nasality of the vowels will be represented by an \u201c'''m'''\u201d after the vowel, when this vowel is at the end of the word or before the letters \u201c'''p'''\u201d and \u201c'''b'''\u201d. In the other cases the nasality will be represented by the letter \u201c'''n'''\u201d.\n*The words will always have a graphic accent. This will be an overwhelming use of accents, but it is the only way to effectively represent both the stressed syllable and vowel aperture.\n*To show an elided vowel in certain variants an apostrophe '''\u2019''' will be used.\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n\nThe vocabulary of Cape Verdean Creole comes mainly from Portuguese. Although the several sources do not agree, the figures oscillate between 90 to 95% of words from Portuguese. The remaining comes from several languages from Western Africa ([[Mandinka language|Mandingo]], [[Wolof language|Wolof]], [[Fula language|Fulani]], [[Temne language|Temne]], [[Balanta language|Balanta]], [[Mandjak language|Mandjak]], etc.), and the vocabulary from other languages (English, French, [[Latin]]) is negligible.\n\n== Phonology ==\n\nCape Verdean Creole's phonological system comes mainly from 15th-through-17th-century Portuguese. In terms of conservative features, Creole has kept the [[affricate consonant]]<nowiki/>s {{IPA|/d\u0292/}} and {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} (written \u201cj\u201d (in the beginning of words) and \u201cch\u201d, in old Portuguese) which are not in use in today's Portuguese, and the pre-tonic vowels were not reduced as in today's [[European Portuguese]]. In terms of innovative features, the phoneme {{IPA|/\u028e/}} (written \u201clh\u201d in Portuguese) has evolved to {{IPA|/d\u0292/}} and the vowels have undergone several phonetic phenomena.\n\n===Vowels===\nThere are eight oral vowels and their corresponding nasal counterparts, making a total of sixteen vowels:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2| &nbsp; ||colspan=2|[[Front vowel|Front]]||colspan=2|[[Central vowel|Central]]||colspan=2|[[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-align=center\n!<small>oral</small>\n!<small>nasal</small>\n!<small>oral</small>\n!<small>nasal</small>\n!<small>oral</small>\n!<small>nasal</small>\n|-align=center\n![[Close vowel|Close]]\n|{{IPA|i}} || {{IPA|\u0129}}|| colspan=2|&nbsp; ||{{IPA|u}} || {{IPA|\u0169}}\n|-align=center\n![[Close-mid vowel|Close-mid]]\n|{{IPA|e}} || {{IPA|\u1ebd}}|| colspan=2|&nbsp; ||{{IPA|o}} || {{IPA|\u00f5}}\n|-align=center\n![[Open-mid vowel|Open-mid]]\n|{{IPA|\u025b}}||{{IPA|\u025b\u0303}} ||{{IPA|\u0250}} || {{IPA|\u0250\u0303}} ||{{IPA|\u0254}}||{{IPA|\u0254\u0303}}\n|-align=center\n![[Open vowel|Open]]\n| colspan=2|&nbsp; ||{{IPA|a}}||{{IPA|\u00e3}} || colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|}\n\n<!---Hiding text while the translation is not finished\n====Descriptions====\n{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n!Phoneme ||Example ||Translation to English ||Description\n|-\n|{{IPA|/i/}} ||''l'''\u00ed''''' {{IPA|/li/}}<br>''s'''\u00ed''''' {{IPA|[si]}} ||here<br>if ||Close front unrounded, <br>like in Portuguese ''b'''i'''co''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u0129/}} ||''s'''\u00edm''''' {{IPA|/s\u0129/}} ||yes ||Close front unrounded nasal, <br>like in Portuguese ''f'''im'''''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/e/}} ||''l'''\u00ea''''' {{IPA|/le/}}<br>''b'''\u00ea'''ra'' {{IPA|/\u02c8be\u027e\u0250/}}<br>''s'''\u00ea''''' {{IPA|/se/}} ||to read<br>edge<br>his, her ||Close-mid front unrounded, <br> like in Portuguese ''d'''e'''do''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u1ebd/}} ||''s'''\u00eam''''' {{IPA|/s\u1ebd/}} ||without ||Close-mid front unrounded nasal, <br>like in Portuguese ''p'''en'''sar''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u025b/}} ||''b'''\u00e9'''ra'' {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u025b\u027e\u0250/}}<br>''B'''\u00e9'''la'' {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u025bl\u0250/}}<br>''s'''\u00e9'''da'' {{IPA|/\u02c8s\u025bd\u0250/}} ||mean (adj.)<br>Bela (name)<br>silk ||Open-mid front unrounded, <br>like in Portuguese ''f'''\u00e9'''''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u025b}}\u0303/ ||''s'''\u00e9n'''da'' {{IPA|/\u02c8s\u025b\u0303d\u0250/}} ||path ||Open-mid front unrounded nasal, <br>close to Portuguese ''f'''\u00e9''''', but with nasality.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u0250/}} ||''c'''a'''b'''\u00e2''''' {{IPA|/k\u0250\u02c8b\u0250/}}<br>''p'''\u00e2''''' ||to finish<br>for, by ||Near-open central, <br>like in (European) Portuguese ''p'''a'''r'''a'''''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u0250\u0303/}} ||''c'''am'''b\u00e2'' {{IPA|/k\u0250\u0303\u02c8b\u0250/}} ||TRANSLATE: enfiar-se, desaparecer ||Near-open central nasal, <br>like in Portuguese ''d'''an'''\u00e7ar''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/a/}} ||''b'''\u00e1'''la'' {{IPA|/\u02c8bal\u0250/}}<br>''b'''\u00e1'''da'' {{IPA|/\u02c8bad\u0250/}}<br>''p'''\u00e1''''' ||bullet<br>TRANSLATE: ida<br>shovel ||Open front unrounded, <br>like in Portuguese ''p'''\u00e1'''''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u00e3/}} ||''b'''\u00e1n'''da'' {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u00e3d\u0250/}} ||side ||Open front unrounded nasal, <br>close to Portuguese ''p'''\u00e1''''', but with nasality.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/u/}} ||''b'''\u00fa''''' {{IPA|/bu/}}<br>''m'''\u00fa'''d'''u''''' {{IPA|/\u02c8mudu/}} ||you<br>dumb ||Close back rounded, <br>like in Portuguese ''t'''u'''''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u0169/}} ||''m'''\u00fan'''du'' {{IPA|/\u02c8m\u0169du/}} ||world ||Close back rounded nasal, <br>like in Portuguese '''''um'''''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/o/}} ||''cin'''\u00f4'''ra'' {{IPA|/si\u02c8no\u027e\u0250/}}<br>''b'''\u00f4''''' {{IPA|/bo/}}<br>''p'''\u00f4''''' {{IPA|/po/}} ||carrot<br>you<br>to put ||Close-mid back rounded, <br>like in Portuguese ''b'''o'''ca''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u00f5/}} ||''p'''\u00f5''''' {{IPA|/p\u00f5/}} ||bread ||Close-mid back rounded nasal, <br>like in Portuguese ''c'''on'''vite''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u0254/}} ||''b'''\u00f3'''la'' {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u0254l\u0250/}}<br>''sinh'''\u00f3'''ra'' {{IPA|/si\u02c8\u0272\u0254\u027e\u0250/}}<br>''m'''\u00f3'''da'' {{IPA|/\u02c8m\u0254d\u0250/}} ||ball<br>lady<br>like (prep.) ||Open-mid back rounded, <br>like in Portuguese ''s'''\u00f3'''''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u0254}}\u0303/ ||''m'''\u00f3n'''da'' {{IPA|/\u02c8m\u0254\u0303d\u0250/}} ||TRANSLATE: acto de tirar ervas daninhas ||Open-mid back rounded nasal, <br>close to Portuguese ''s'''\u00f3''''', but with nasality.\n|}\n--->\n\n===Consonants and semi-vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! colspan=2 | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Dental consonant|Dental]]/<br>[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Postalveolar consonant|Postalveolar]]/<br>[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n|-align=center\n!

In the Sotavento variants that consonant {{IPA|[m]}} was reduced to a simple nasality {{IPA|[n\u0329]}}. For example: ''m\u2019 and\u00e2'' {{IPA|[n\u0329 \u0250\u0303\u02c8d\u0250]}} ('I have walked'), ''m\u2019 st\u00e2 t\u00e2 sint\u00ed'' {{IPA|[n\u0329 st\u0250 t\u0250 s\u0129\u02c8ti]}} ('I am feeling'), ''m\u2019 lab\u00e1ba'' {{IPA|[n\u0329 l\u0250\u02c8bab\u0250]}} ('I had washed'). Before plosive or affricate consonants this nasality becomes [[homorganic]] nasal of the following consonant. For ex.: ''m\u2019 b\u00eam'' {{IPA|[m b\u1ebd]}} ('I came'), ''m\u2019 t\u00eam'' {{IPA|[n t\u1ebd]}} ('I have'), ''m\u2019 tchig\u00e2'' {{IPA|[\u0272 t\u0283i\u02c8\u0261\u0250]}} ('I arrived'), ''m\u2019 cr\u00ea'' {{IPA|[\u014b k\u027ee]}} ('I want').\n\nSpeakers who are strongly influenced by the Portuguese language tend to pronounce this pronoun as a '''nasal vowel''' ''\u00fam'' {{IPA|[\u0169]}} instead of ''m\u2019'' {{IPA|[m]}}.\n\nBefore some forms of the verb ''s\u00ear'' this pronoun takes back its full form '''''m\u00ed''''' {{IPA|[mi]}}, in whatever variant: ''m\u00ed \u00ea'' {{IPA|[mi e]}} (\u2018I am\u2019), ''m\u00ed \u00e9ra'' {{IPA|[mi \u02c8\u025b\u027e\u0250]}} (\u2018I was\u2019).\n\nIn this article, this pronoun is conventionally written ''m\u2019'', no matter the variant.\n\n<!---\n====Semivowels====\n{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n!Phoneme ||Example ||Translation to English ||Description\n|-\n|{{IPA|/j/}} ||''b\u00e1'''i''''' {{IPA|/baj/}} ||to go ||Palatal approximant, <br>like in English '''y'''es.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/w/}} ||''c\u00ea'''u''''' {{IPA|/sew/}} ||sky ||Labial-velar approximant, <br>like in English '''w'''ater.\n|}\n--->\n\n[[Image:Cape Verdean Creole linguistic books.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Some linguistic books about the creole.]]\n\n== Grammar ==\n\nEven though over 90% of Cape Verdean Creole words are derived from Portuguese, the grammar is very different, which makes it extremely difficult for an untrained Portuguese native speaker even to understand a basic conversation. On the other hand, the grammar shows a lot of similarities with other creoles, Portuguese-based or not (check [[syntactic similarities of creoles]]).\n\n===Sentence structure===\nThe basic sentence structure in Creole is Subject{{spaced ndash}}Verb{{spaced ndash}}Object. Ex.:\n*''\u00cal t\u00e2 cum\u00ea p\u00eaxi.'' \u201cHe eats fish.\u201d\n\nWhen there are two objects, the indirect object comes first while the direct object comes after, and the sentence structure becomes Subject{{spaced ndash}}Verb{{spaced ndash}}Indirect Object{{spaced ndash}}Direct Object. Ex.:\n*''\u00cal t\u00e2 d\u00e2 p\u00eaxi cum\u00edda.'' \u201cHe gives food to the fish.\u201d\n\nA feature that makes Cape Verdean Creole closer to other creoles is the possibility of [[double negation]] (ex.: ''N\u00e1da m\u2019 c\u00e2 atch\u00e2.'' liter. \u201cNothing I didn\u2019t find.\u201d), or sometimes even triple negation (ex.: ''N\u00fanca ningu\u00eam c\u00e2 t\u00e2 b\u00e1ba l\u00e2.'' liter. \u201cNever nobody didn\u2019t go there.\u201d). Although double negation is common in Portuguese (e.g. \"Nunca ningu\u00e9m foi l\u00e1\"), triple negation is a little bit uncommon.\n\n===Nouns===\n\n====Gender inflection====\nOnly the animated nouns (human beings and animals) have gender inflection. Ex.:\n*''ingl\u00eas'' / ''ingl\u00e9sa'' \u201cEnglishman / Englishwoman\u201d\n*''p\u00f4rcu'' / ''p\u00f3rca'' \u201cpig (male) / pig (female)\u201d\n\nIn some cases the distinction between sexes is made putting the adjectives ''m\u00e1tchu'' \u201cmale\u201d and ''f\u00e9mia'' \u201cfemale\u201d after the nouns. Ex.:\n*''f\u00eddju-m\u00e1tchu'' / ''f\u00eddju-f\u00e9mia'' \u201cson / daughter\u201d\n*''catch\u00f4rr\u2019-m\u00e1tchu'' / ''catch\u00f4rr\u2019-f\u00e9mia'' \u201cdog (male) / dog (female)\u201d\n\n====Number inflection====\nThe nouns in Creole have number inflection (plural marks) only when they are well determined or known in the context. Ex.:\n* ''Min\u00ednus d\u00ed B\u00eda \u00ea b\u00eam comport\u00e1du.'' (\u201cThe children of Bia are well behaved.\u201d)\n\nWhen the noun refers to something in general that noun does not have number inflection. Ex.:\n* ''Min\u00ednu dev\u00ea ruspet\u00e2 algu\u00eam gr\u00e1ndi.'' (\u201cChildren must respect grown up people.\u201d)\n\nIf in a sentence there are several grammatical categories, only the first bears the plural marker. Ex.:\n* ''min\u00ednu'''s''''' (\u201cboys\u201d)\n* ''nh\u00e2'''s''' min\u00edna'' (\u201cmy girls\u201d)\n* ''min\u00ednu'''s''' bun\u00edtu'' (\u201cbeautiful boys\u201d)\n* ''nh\u00e2'''s''' d\u00f4s min\u00edna bun\u00edta \u00ed simp\u00e1tica'' (\u201cmy two kind and beautiful girls\u201d)\n\n:''Further reading:'' {{cite book |title=Introdu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 Gram\u00e1tica do Crioulo |author=Manuel Veiga |edition=2 |p=139\u2013141 |chapter=5.2 \u2013 Flex\u00f5es dos substantivos |language=pt}}\n\n===Personal pronouns===\nAccording to their function, the pronouns can be '''subject''' pronouns or '''object''' pronouns. Furthermore, in each of these functions, according to the position within the sentence the pronouns can be '''unstressed''' or '''stressed'''.\n\nThe '''unstressed''' subject pronouns generally bear the function of the subject and the come before the verb. Ex.:\n*'''''N\u00fa''' cr\u00ea.'' \u201c'''We''' want.\u201d\n\nThe '''stressed''' subject pronouns bear the function of some kind of vocative and usually are separated from the verb ([[disjunctive pronoun]]s). Ex.:\n*'''''M\u00ed''', m\u2019 st\u00e2 l\u00ed, \u00ed '''b\u00f4''', b\u00fa st\u00e2 l\u00e2.'' \u201c'''Me''', I am here, and '''you''', you are there.\u201d\n\nThe object pronouns, as the name shows, bear the function of the object (direct or indirect). The '''unstressed''' object pronouns are used with the present-tense forms of verbs. Ex.:\n*''M\u2019 odj\u00e1-'''\u2019l'''.'' \u201cI have seen '''it'''.\u201d\n*''M\u2019 t\u00e2 bej\u00e1-'''bu'''.'' \u201cI kiss '''you'''.\u201d\n\nThe '''stressed''' object pronouns are used with the past-tense forms of verbs, when they are the second pronoun in a series of two pronouns, and after prepositions ([[prepositional pronoun]]s). Ex.:\n*''\u00cas t\u00e2 odj\u00e1ba-'''\u00eal'''.'' \u201cThey saw '''it'''.\u201d\n*''B\u00fa d\u00e2-m\u2019-'''\u00eal'''.'' \u201cYou gave '''it''' to me.\u201d\n*''M\u2019 st\u00e2 f\u00e1rtu d\u00ed '''b\u00f4'''!'' \u201cI\u2019m fed up of '''you'''!\u201d\n\nWhen there are two object pronouns, the indirect pronoun comes first while the direct pronoun comes after, and the sentence structure becomes Subject{{spaced ndash}}Verb{{spaced ndash}}Indirect Pronoun{{spaced ndash}}Direct Pronoun.\n\nThere are no reflexive pronouns. To indicate reflexivity, Creole uses the expression ''cab\u00e9\u00e7a'' (\"head\") after the possessive determiner. Ex.:\n*''\u00cas mord\u00ea s\u00eas cab\u00e9\u00e7a.'' \u201cThey have bitten themselves.\u201d\n\nThere are no reciprocal pronouns. To indicate reciprocity, Creole uses the expression ''cumpanh\u00earu'' (\"companion\"). Ex.:\n*''\u00cas mord\u00ea cumpanh\u00earu.'' \u201cThey have bitten each other.\u201d\n\n===Verbs===\nThe verbs have only minimal inflection (two forms). They have the same form for all the persons, and the notions of tense, mood and aspect are expressed through the presence (or absence) of certain morphemes (called \u201c'''verbal actualizers'''\u201d by Veiga<ref name=\"Veiga\" />), as in the majority of creoles.\n\nThe verbs are generally reduced to two base forms, one for the '''present''', another for the '''past'''. The form for the '''present''' is the same to the form for the '''infinitive''' (exception: ''s\u00ear'' \u201cto be\u201d), that in turn comes, in the majority of the verbs, from the infinitive in Portuguese but without the final ''r''. Ex.: ''cant\u00e2'' {{IPA|/k\u0250\u0303\u02c8t\u0250/}} (from Portuguese ''cantar''), ''mex\u00ea'' {{IPA|/me\u02c8\u0283e/}} (from Portuguese ''mexer''), ''part\u00ed'' {{IPA|/p\u0250\u027e\u02c8ti/}} (from Portuguese ''partir''), ''comp\u00f4'' {{IPA|/k\u00f5\u02c8po/}} (from Portuguese ''compor''), ''*lumb\u00fa'' {{IPA|/l\u0169\u02c8bu/}} (from Portuguese ''lombo''). The form for the '''past''' is formed from the infinitive to which is joined the particle for the past ''~ba''. Ex.: ''cant\u00e1ba'' {{IPA|/k\u0250\u0303\u02c8tab\u0250/}}, ''mex\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/me\u02c8\u0283eb\u0250/}}, ''part\u00edba'' {{IPA|/p\u0250\u027e\u02c8tib\u0250/}}, ''comp\u00f4ba'' {{IPA|/k\u00f5\u02c8pob\u0250/}}, ''*lumb\u00faba'' {{IPA|/l\u0169\u02c8bub\u0250/}} (in the Barlavento variants, the particle for the past ''~va'' (or ''~ba'') is joined to the '''imperfective actualizer''', and not to the verb). It is noteworthy that the Upper Guinea creoles (Cape Verdean Creole and [[Guinea-Bissau Creole]]) put the past tense marker after the verbs, and not before like the majority of creoles (check [[syntactic similarities of creoles]]).\n\nIt is important to mention that in the Santiago variant, the stress goes back to before the last syllable in the present tense forms of the verbs. Therefore, we have: ''c\u00e1nta'' {{IPA|/\u02c8k\u00e3t\u0250/}} instead of ''cant\u00e2'' {{IPA|/k\u0250\u0303\u02c8t\u0250/}}, ''m\u00eaxe'' {{IPA|/\u02c8me\u0283e/}} or ''m\u00eaxi'' {{IPA|/\u02c8me\u0283i/}} instead of ''mex\u00ea'' {{IPA|/me\u02c8\u0283e/}}, ''p\u00e2rti'' {{IPA|/\u02c8p\u0250\u027eti/}} instead of ''part\u00ed'' {{IPA|/p\u0250\u027e\u02c8ti/}}, ''c\u00f4mpo'' {{IPA|/\u02c8k\u00f5po/}} or ''c\u00f4mpu'' {{IPA|/\u02c8k\u00f5pu/}} instead of ''comp\u00f4'' {{IPA|/k\u00f5\u02c8po/}}, ''b\u00fambu'' {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u0169bu/}} instead of ''bumb\u00fa'' {{IPA|/b\u0169\u02c8bu/}}. In the pronominal forms, however, the stress remains on the last syllable: ''cant\u00e2-m\u2019'' {{IPA|/k\u0250\u0303\u02c8t\u0250\u0303/}}, ''mex\u00ea-bu'' {{IPA|/me\u02c8\u0283ebu/}}, ''part\u00ed-\u2019l'' {{IPA|/p\u0250\u027e\u02c8til/}}, ''comp\u00f4-nu'' {{IPA|/k\u00f5\u02c8ponu/}}, ''bumb\u00fa-\u2019s'' {{IPA|/b\u0169\u02c8buz/}}.\n\n====Regular verbs====\nAs was said before, the regular verbs are reduced to a form for the present tense and a form for the past tense, and the notions of mood and aspect are expressed through verbal actualizers.\n\nThe following table shows a paradigm of the indicative mood with the verb ''d\u00e2'' \u201cto give\u201d in the first-person singular:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! &nbsp; ||Present Tense ||Past Tense\n|-\n|[[Perfective aspect]] ||''M\u2019 d\u00e2'' ||''M\u2019 d\u00e1ba''\n|-\n|[[Imperfective aspect]] ||''M\u2019 t\u00e2 d\u00e2'' ||''M\u2019 t\u00e2 d\u00e1ba''\n|-\n|[[Progressive aspect]] ||''M\u2019 st\u00e2 t\u00e2 d\u00e2'' ||''M\u2019 st\u00e1ba t\u00e2 da''\n|}\n\nThe '''perfective''' aspect of the '''present''' is used when the speech refers to present situations, but that are finished, that are complete. Ex.:\n:''M\u2019 d\u00e2.'' {{IPA|[m d\u0250]}} \u201cI gave. / I have given.\u201d\n:It corresponds roughly, according to context, to the '''past tense''' or '''present perfect''' in English.\n\nThe '''imperfective''' aspect of the '''present''' is used when the speech refers to present situations, but that are not finished yet, that are incomplete. Ex.:\n:''M\u2019 t\u00e2 d\u00e2.'' {{IPA|[m t\u0250 d\u0250]}} \u201cI give.\u201d\n:It corresponds roughly to the '''present tense''' in English.\n\nThe '''progressive''' aspect of the '''present''' is used when the speech refers to present situations that are happening in a continuous, uninterrupted way. Ex.:\n:''M\u2019 st\u00e2 t\u00e2 d\u00e2.'' {{IPA|[m st\u0250 t\u0250 d\u0250]}} \u201cI am giving.\u201d\n:It corresponds roughly to the '''present continuous tense''' in English.\n::<small>Note: Actually, this model doesn\u2019t exist anymore.

The '''future of the present''' may be expressed through three resources:\n#Using the imperfective of the present but bearing the function of the future. Ex.: ''M\u2019 t\u00e2 d\u00e2 manh\u00e3.'' {{IPA|[m t\u0250 d\u0250 m\u0250\u02c8\u0272\u0250\u0303]}} liter. \u201cI give tomorrow.\u201d\n#Using the auxiliary verb \u201cto go\u201d.

They are the '''auxiliary verbs''' ''s\u00ear'' {{IPA|/se\u027e/}} \u201cto be\u201d, ''st\u00e2'' {{IPA|/st\u0250/}} \u201cto be\u201d, ''t\u00eam'' {{IPA|/t\u1ebd/}} \u201cto have\u201d and ''ten\u00ea'' {{IPA|/te\u02c8ne/}} \u201cto have\u201d, and the '''modal verbs''' ''cr\u00ea'' {{IPA|/k\u027ee/}} \u201cto want\u201d, ''sab\u00ea'' {{IPA|/s\u0250\u02c8be/}} \u201cto know\u201d, ''pod\u00ea'' {{IPA|/po\u02c8de/}} \u201ccan\u201d, ''dev\u00ea'' {{IPA|/de\u02c8ve/}} \u201cmust\u201d and ''mest\u00ea'' {{IPA|/mes\u02c8te/}} \u201cto need\u201d.\n: <small>Note.: The designation \u201cauxiliary verbs\u201d is not consensual.</small>\n\nThere exist two registers for these verbs.\n\nIn the ''first register'' (in older speakers, in rural areas speakers or in speakers with little exposure to Portuguese) there are only two forms for the verbs: one for the present (''\u00ea'' {{IPA|/e/}}, ''st\u00e2'' {{IPA|/st\u0250/}}, ''t\u00eam'' {{IPA|/t\u1ebd/}}, ''ten\u00ea'' {{IPA|/te\u02c8ne/}}, ''cr\u00ea'' {{IPA|/k\u027ee/}}, ''sab\u00ea'' {{IPA|/s\u0250\u02c8be/}}, ''pod\u00ea'' {{IPA|/po\u02c8de/}}, ''dev\u00ea'' {{IPA|/de\u02c8ve/}}, ''mest\u00ea'' {{IPA|/mes\u02c8te/}}) and one for the past (''\u00e9ra'' {{IPA|/\u02c8\u025b\u027e\u0250/}}, ''st\u00e1ba'' {{IPA|/stab\u0250/}}, ''t\u00eamba'' /t\u1ebd{{IPA|b\u0250/}}, ''ten\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/te\u02c8neb\u0250/}}, ''cr\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/k\u027eeb\u0250/}}, ''sab\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/s\u0250\u02c8beb\u0250/}}, ''pod\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/po\u02c8deb\u0250/}}, ''dev\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/de\u02c8veb\u0250/}}, ''mest\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/mes\u02c8teb\u0250/}}). However, on the contrary of regular verbs, when the base form is used alone it represents the '''imperfective aspect''' and not the '''perfective aspect'''.

However that designation is contested: not all those verbs are in fact stative; not all those verbs are irregular (for ex. ''mor\u00e2''); some of those verbs are regular in some variants (''m\u2019 t\u00e2 gost\u00e2''{{spaced ndash}}imperfective of the present with ''t\u00e2''), and irregulars in other variants (''m\u2019 gost\u00e2''{{spaced ndash}}imperfective of the present but '''without''' ''t\u00e2'').</small>\n\nThere is a parallelism between the pair of the verbs ''s\u00ear'' / ''st\u00e2'' \u201cto be\u201d and the pair of the verbs ''t\u00eam'' / ''ten\u00ea'' \u201cto have\u201d.\n*The verb ''s\u00ear'' is a copulative verb that expresses a permanent quality.

The verb ''ten\u00ea'' does not exist in the Barlavento variants. In S\u00e3o Vicente and Santo Ant\u00e3o the verb ''st\u00e2'' has the form ''st\u00f3d\u2019'' for the infinitive, ''t\u00e2'' for the imperfective of the present, ''t\u00edv\u2019'' for the perfective of the present, and ''t\u00e1va'' for the imperfective of the past.</small>\n\n====Passive====\nCape Verdean Creole has two '''voices'''. The '''active''' voice is used when the subject is explicit. The '''passive''' voice is used when the subject is indeterminate or unknown. There is also two forms for the passive. The form for the present is made with the infinitive to which is joined the particle ''~du''. The form for the past is made with the infinitive to which is joined the particle ''~da''. Ex.:\n* ''T\u00e2 papi\u00e1du ingl\u00eas n\u00e2 M\u00e9rca.'' {{IPA|/t\u0250 p\u0250pi\u02c8adu}} {{IPA|\u0129\u02c8\u0261lez}} {{IPA|n\u0250 \u02c8m\u025b\u027ek\u0250/}} \u201cEnglish is spoken in America.\u201d\n* ''M\u2019 inxin\u00e1du t\u00e2 and\u00e2.'' {{IPA|/m \u0129\u0283i\u02c8nadu t\u0250 \u0250\u0303\u02c8d\u0250/}} \u201cI was taught to walk.\u201d\n* ''\u00dam v\u00eaz, t\u00e2 cum\u00eada tch\u00eau m\u00eddju.'' {{IPA|/\u0169 vez t\u0250 ku\u02c8med\u0250 t\u0283ew \u02c8mid\u0292u/}} \u201cOnce, one used to eat a lot of corn.\u201d\n:<small>Note.: In the Barlavento variants the form for the past does not exist.</small>\n\n====Negative====\nTo negate a verb, the negative adverb ''c\u00e2'' {{IPA|/k\u0250/}} is used after the subject and before any verbal actualizer. Ex.:\n*''N\u00fa c\u00e2 t\u00e2 beb\u00ea.'' {{IPA|/nu k\u0250 t\u0250 be\u02c8be/}} \u201cWe don\u2019t drink.\u201d\n*''\u00cal c\u00e2 t\u00e2 odj\u00e1ba.'' {{IPA|/el k\u0250 t\u0250 o\u02c8d\u0292ab\u0250/}} \u201cHe didn\u2019t see.\u201d\n*''B\u00fa c\u00e2 b\u00e1i.'' {{IPA|/bu k\u0250 baj/}} \u201cYou haven\u2019t gone.\u201d\n\nIn the Santo Ant\u00e3o variant, the negative adverb is ''n\u2019'' {{IPA|/n/}}. Ex.:\n*''N\u00f4 n\u2019 d\u00e2 bib\u00ea.'' {{IPA|/no n d\u0250 bi\u02c8be/}} \u201cWe don\u2019t drink.\u201d\n*''\u00cal n\u2019 d\u00e1va o\u2019\u00e1.'' {{IPA|/el n dav\u0250 o\u02c8a/}} \u201cHe didn\u2019t see.\u201d\n*''B\u00f4 n\u2019 b\u00e9.'' {{IPA|/bo n b\u025b/}} \u201cYou haven\u2019t gone.\u201d\n\nIn imperative sentences the negative adverb ''c\u00e2'' {{IPA|/k\u0250/}} is always in the beginning. Ex.:\n*''C\u00e2 b\u00fa b\u00e1i!'' {{IPA|/k\u0250 bu baj/}} \u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d (you{{spaced ndash}}singular)\n*''C\u00e2 nh\u00f4s faz\u00ea!'' {{IPA|/k\u0250 \u0272oz f\u0250\u02c8ze/}} (Sotavento), ''C\u00e2 b\u2019s\u00f4t\u2019 faz\u00ea!'' {{IPA|/k\u0250 bzot f\u0250\u02c8ze/}} (Barlavento) \u201cDon\u2019t do!\u201d (you-plural)\n\nAnd in the Santo Ant\u00e3o variant:\n*''N\u2019 b\u00f4 b\u00e9!'' /n bo {{IPA|b\u025b/}} \u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d (you{{spaced ndash}}singular)\n*''N\u2019 b\u2019s\u00f4t\u2019 fez\u00ea!'' {{IPA|/n bzot fe\u02c8ze/}} \u201cDon\u2019t do!\u201d (you{{spaced ndash}}plural)\n\n===Adjectives===\nAdjectives in Creole almost always come after the noun. Only the animated nouns (human beings and animals) demand gender inflection in their adjectives. Ex.:\n*''\u00f3mi f\u00eaiu'' / ''mudj\u00ear f\u00eaia'' \u201cugly man / ugly woman\u201d\n*''b\u00f3di pr\u00eatu'' / ''c\u00e1bra pr\u00e9ta'' \u201cblack buck / black goat\u201d\n\nThe adjectives for unanimated nouns have the same form as the masculine adjectives. Ex.:\n*''bist\u00eddu br\u00e1ncu'' \u201cwhite dress\u201d\n*''cam\u00edsa br\u00e1ncu'' \u201cwhite shirt\u201d\n\nIn general the plural marker does not appear on adjectives since it comes in a preceding grammatical category.\n\n===Determiners===\nIn Creole there are no definite articles. If it is absolutely necessary to determine the noun, the [[demonstrative]] determiners are used instead.\n\nFor the indefinite articles there are two forms, one for the singular, another for the plural:\n*''\u00fam\u2026'' {{IPA|/\u0169/}} \u201ca, an (singular)\u201d, ''\u00fans\u2026'' {{IPA|/\u0169z/}} \u201ca, an (plural)\u201d\n\nThe possessive determiners have number inflexion, but the plural refers to the objects possessed, and not to the owners. Ex.:\n*''nh\u00e2 c\u00e1rru'' \u201cmy car\u201d\n*''nh\u00e2s c\u00e1rru'' \u201cmy cars\u201d\n*''n\u00f4s c\u00e1rru'' can be either \u201cour car\u201d or \u201cour cars\u201d\n\nThe demonstrative determiners have only two degrees of proximity: close to the speaker (''\u00eass'' \u201cthis, these\u201d) and away from the speaker (''qu\u00eal'' \u201cthat\u201d, ''qu\u00eas'' \u201cthose\u201d).\n:<small>Note.: Only the S\u00e3o Vicente and Santo Ant\u00e3o Creoles make a phonetic distinction between the singular ''\u00eass'' {{IPA|/es/}} (\u201cthis\u201d) and the plural ''\u00eas'' {{IPA|/e\u0292/}} (\u201cthese\u201d).</small>\n\n===Designatives===\nCreole possesses a special grammatical category for presenting or announcing something. It appears in two forms, one to present something near, (''al\u00ed\u2026'' {{IPA|/\u0250\u02c8li/}}) and another to present something far (''al\u00e2\u2026'' {{IPA|/\u0250\u02c8l\u0250/}}). Ex.:\n*''Al\u00ed nh\u00e2 f\u00eddju.'' \u201cHere is my son.\u201d\n*''Al\u00e1-\u2019l t\u00e2 b\u00e1i.'' \u201cThere he goes.\u201d\n\n==Dialects==\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2013}}\nIn spite of Cape Verde's small size, each island has developed its own way of speaking Creole. Each of these nine ways (there are 10 islands, one of which is uninhabited) is justifiably a different [[dialect]], but the scholars in Cape Verde usually call them \u201cvariants\u201d. These variants can be classified into two branches: in the South there are the Sotavento Creoles, which comprise the [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]], [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]], [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] and [[Maio, Cape Verde|Maio]] variants; in the North there are the Barlavento Creoles, which comprise the [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]], [[Sal, Cape Verde|Sal]], [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]], [[S\u00e3o Vicente, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Vicente]] and [[Santo Ant\u00e3o, Cape Verde|Santo Ant\u00e3o]] variants.\n\nSince some [[Word|lexical]] forms of Cape Verdean Creole can be different according to each variant, the words and the sentences in this article will be presented in compromise model, a kind of \u201cmiddle Creole\u201d, in order to ease the understanding and in order not to favor any variant. Whenever it will be necessary the [[Phoneme#Notation|phonemic transcription]] (or sometimes the [[phonetic transcription]]) will be shown immediately after the word.\n\nFor the writing system, check the section [[Cape Verdean Creole#Writing system|Writing system]].\n\nFrom a linguistic point of view, the most important variants are the Fogo, Santiago, S\u00e3o Nicolau and Santo Ant\u00e3o ones, and any deep study of Creole should approach at least these four. They are the only islands that have received slaves directly from the African continent, that possess the most conservative linguistic features, and that are the most distinct from each other.\n\nFrom a social point of view, the most important variants are the Santiago and S\u00e3o Vicente ones, and any light study of Creole should approach at least these two. They are the variants of the two bigger cities ([[Praia]] and [[Mindelo]]), the variants with the greatest number of speakers, and the variants with a [[glottophagy|glottophagist]] tendency over the neighboring ones.\n\nThese variants have significant literature:\n* Brava: Eug\u00e9nio Tavares\n* Fogo: [[Elsie Clews Parsons]]\n* Santiago: Carlos Barbosa, Tom\u00e9 Varela da Silva, Daniel Sp\u00ednola\n* S\u00e3o Vicente: S\u00e9rgio Frusoni, Ov\u00eddio Martins\n* Santo Ant\u00e3o: Lu\u00eds Romano Madeira de Melo\n\n;Dialectal differences:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Sotavento Creoles]] ||colspan=\"3\"|[[Barlavento Creoles]] ||rowspan=\"2\"|English\n|-\n!

However, in everyday usage the creole is simply called {{lang|kea|Kriolu}} ('Creole') by its speakers. The names Cape Verdean ({{lang|pt|cabo-verdiano}} in Portuguese, {{lang|kea|kabuverdianu}} in Cape Verdean Creole) and Cape Verdean language ({{lang|pt|l\u00edngua cabo-verdiana}} in Portuguese, {{lang|kea|l\u00edngua kabuverdianu}} in the Sotavento dialect of Cape Verdean Creole and {{lang|kea|l\u00edngua kabverdian}} in the [[Barlavento Islands|Barlavento]] dialect) have been proposed for whenever the creole will be standardized.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[Image:0LivroET.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''[[Morna (music)|Mornas]] \u2013 cantigas crioulas'' by Eug\u00e9nio Tavares,<br>one of the first books with creole texts.]]\n\nThe history of Cape Verdean Creole is hard to trace due to a lack of written documentation and to ostracism during the Portuguese administration of Cape Verde.\n\nThere are presently three theories about the formation of Creole.<ref>Santos, C., \"Cultura e comunica\u00e7\u00e3o: um estudo no \u00e2mbito da sociolingu\u00edstica\"</ref> The [[monogenetic theory of pidgins|monogenetic theory]] claims that the creole was formed by the Portuguese by simplifying the Portuguese language in order to make it accessible to African slaves. That is the point of view of authors like Prudent, Waldman, Chaudenson and Lopes da Silva. Authors like Adam and Quint argue that Creole was formed by African slaves using the grammar of Western African languages and replacing the African lexicon with the Portuguese one. Linguists like [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] and [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton]] argue that Creole was formed spontaneously, not by slaves from continental Africa, but by the population born in the islands, using the grammar with which all human beings are born; this would explain how creoles located many miles apart have [[language bioprogram theory#Syntactic similarities|similar grammatical structures]], even though they have a different lexical basis.\n\nAccording to A. Carreira,<ref>Carreira, A. (1982)</ref> Cape Verdean Creole was formed from a Portuguese [[pidgin]], on the island of Santiago, starting from the 15th century. That pidgin was then transported to the west coast of Africa by the ''[[lan\u00e7ados]]''. From there, that pidgin diverged into two [[proto-Creoles]], one that was the base of all Cape Verdean Creoles, and another that was the base of the [[Guinea-Bissau Creole]].\n\nCross referencing information regarding the settlement of each island with the linguistic comparisons, it is possible to form some conjectures. The spreading of Cape Verdean Creole within the islands was done in three phases:<ref>Pereira, D. (2006)</ref>\n* In a first phase, the island of Santiago was occupied (2nd half of the 15th century), followed by Fogo (end of the 16th century).\n* In a second phase, the island of S\u00e3o Nicolau was occupied (mostly in the 2nd half of the 17th century), followed by Santo Ant\u00e3o (mostly in the 2nd half of the 17th century).\n* In a third phase, the remaining islands were occupied by settlers from the first islands: Brava was occupied by people from Fogo (mostly in the beginning of the 18th century), Boa Vista by people from S\u00e3o Nicolau and Santiago (mostly in the 1st half of the 18th century), Maio by people from Santiago and Boa Vista (mostly in the 2nd half of the 18th century), S\u00e3o Vicente by people from Santo Ant\u00e3o and S\u00e3o Nicolau (mostly in the 19th century), Sal by people from S\u00e3o Nicolau and Boa Vista (mostly in the 19th century).\n\n== Status ==\n[[Image:2006.07.28.cv.sv.Mindelo.di.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Diglossia: a sign in Portuguese prohibits the entry and presence of minors, while underneath, beer is advertised in Cape Verdean Creole.]]\n\nIn spite of Creole being the [[first language]] of nearly all the population in Cape Verde, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is still the [[official language]]. As Portuguese is used in everyday life (at school, in administration, in official acts, in relations with foreign countries, etc.), Portuguese and Cape Verdean Creole live in a state of [[diglossia]].<ref>Duarte, D. A. (1998)</ref> Due to this overall presence of Portuguese, a [[decreolization]] process occurs for all the different Cape Verdean Creole variants.\n\nCheck in this fictional text:\n: Santiago variant:\n:: Qu\u00eal mudj\u00ear c\u00fa qu\u00eam m\u2019 enc\u00f4ntra \u00f3nti st\u00e1ba priocup\u00e1da p\u00farqui \u00eal sq\u00eaci d\u00ed s\u00eas min\u00ednus n\u00e2 sc\u00f3la, \u00ed c\u00e1ndu \u00eal b\u00e2i procur\u00e2-\u2019s \u00eal c\u00e2 olh\u00e2-\u2019s.

Speakers are reluctant to speak a variant that is not their own.\n* Absence of rules to establish which is the right form (and also the right spelling) to be adopted for each word. For example, for the word corresponding to the Portuguese word ''algibeira'' (\u201cpocket\u201d), A. Fernandes<ref>Fernandes, A. N. Rodrigues (1969)</ref> records the forms ''algib\u00eara'', ''agib\u00eara'', ''albig\u00eara'', ''aljub\u00eara'', ''alj\u2019b\u00eara'', ''gilb\u00eara'', ''julb\u00eara'', ''lijb\u00eara''.\n* Absence of rules to establish which are the lexical limits to be adopted. It is frequent for speakers of Creole, when writing, to join different grammatical classes.<ref>Pereira, D., \u00ab[http://caboverde.vozdipovo-online.com/index2.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=38&pop=1&page=1&Itemid=30 Pa Nu Skrebe Na Skola] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918113801/http://caboverde.vozdipovo-online.com/index2.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=38&pop=1&page=1&Itemid=30 |date=18 September 2007 }}\u00bb</ref> For ex.: ''p\u00e2m...'' instead of ''p\u00e2 m\u2019...'' \u201cfor me to...\u201d.\n* Absence of rules to establish which are the grammatical structures to be adopted. It is not just about dialectal differences; even within a single variant there are fluctuations. For ex.: in the Santiago variant, when there are two sentences and one is subordinated to the other, there is a tense agreement in the verbs (''b\u00fa cr\u00eda p\u00e2 m\u2019 d\u00e1ba'' \u201cyou wanted me to give\u201d{{spaced ndash}}both ''cr\u00eda'' and ''d\u00e1ba'' are past tense), but some speakers do not practice it (''b\u00fa cr\u00eda p\u00e2 m\u2019 d\u00e2''{{spaced ndash}}past then present{{spaced ndash}}or ''b\u00fa cr\u00ea p\u00e2 m\u2019 d\u00e1ba''{{spaced ndash}}present then past).\n* The writing system ([[ALUPEC]]) has not been well accepted by all Creole users.\n* The language levels (formal, informal, scientific, slang, etc.) are not well differentiated yet.\n\nThat is the reason why, each speaker when speaking (or writing) uses his/her own [[dialect]], his/her own [[sociolect]] and his/her own [[idiolect]].\n\nTo overcome these problems, some Creole advocates<ref name=\"Veiga\">Veiga, M. (2000)</ref> propose the development of two standards: a North (Barlavento) standard, centered on the S\u00e3o Vicente variant, and a South (Sotavento) standard, centered on that of Santiago. If so, Creole would become a [[pluricentric language]]\n\nThere exists no complete translation of the Bible. However, the \u201cAsosiason Kabuverdianu pa Traduson di B\u00edblia\u201d was established with the goal of translating the entire Bible in Kabuverdianu-Sotaventu and Kabuverdianu-Barlaventu (see https://web.archive.org/web/20180809164421/http://aktb.org/). They have translated approximately 40% of the [[New Testament]] in the Kabuverdianu-Sotaventu, and they have published Luke and Acts. The publication of Luke has won two awards in Cape Verde.  S\u00e9rgio Frusoni translated [[Bartolomeo Rossetti]]'s version of the [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco Italian]] poem ''Er Vangelo Seconno Noantri'', which is a poem based on the [[Gospel#Canonical gospels|Four Gospels]]. Frusoni translated the poem in the S\u00e3o Vicente Creole, ''Vang\u00eale cont\u00f3d d'n\u00f4s m\u00f3da''.\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{Main|ALUPEC}}\n\nThe only writing system officially recognized by the authorities in Cape Verde is called [[ALUPEC]]. In spite of having been officially recognized by the government, the ALUPEC is neither officially nor mandatorily used, instead used only by enthusiasts.\n\nIn spite of being the only system officially recognized, the same law allows the use of alternative writing models, \u201cas long as they are presented in a systematic and scientific way\u201d. As not all users are familiarized with ALUPEC or the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], in this article a slightly different system will be used to make it easier for the reader:\n*The sound {{IPA|[s]}} will be represented in an etymological way (\u201c'''s'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''s'''\u201d, \u201c'''ss'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''ss'''\u201d, \u201c'''c'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''c'''\u201d, \u201c'''\u00e7'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''\u00e7'''\u201d) instead of ALUPEC always \u201c'''s'''\u201d.\n*The sound {{IPA|[z]}} will be represented in an etymological way (\u201c'''s'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''s'''\u201d, \u201c'''z'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''z'''\u201d) instead of ALUPEC always \u201c'''z'''\u201d.\n*The sound {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} will be represented by \u201c'''tch'''\u201d instead of ALUPEC \u201c'''tx'''\u201d.\n*The sound {{IPA|[\u0283]}} will be represented in an etymological way (\u201c'''x'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''x'''\u201d, \u201c'''ch'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''ch'''\u201d) instead of ALUPEC always \u201c'''x'''\u201d.\n*The sound {{IPA|[\u0292]}} will be represented in an etymological way (\u201c'''j'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''j'''\u201d, \u201c'''g'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''g'''\u201d) instead of ALUPEC always \u201c'''j'''\u201d.\n*The sound {{IPA|[k]}} will be represented in an etymological way (\u201c'''c'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''c'''\u201d, \u201c'''qu'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''qu'''\u201d) instead of ALUPEC always \u201c'''k'''\u201d.\n*The sound {{IPA|[\u0261]}} will be represented in an etymological way (\u201c'''g'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''g'''\u201d, \u201c'''gu'''\u201d when in Portuguese is \u201c'''gu'''\u201d) instead of ALUPEC always \u201c'''g'''\u201d.\n*The nasality of the vowels will be represented by an \u201c'''m'''\u201d after the vowel, when this vowel is at the end of the word or before the letters \u201c'''p'''\u201d and \u201c'''b'''\u201d. In the other cases the nasality will be represented by the letter \u201c'''n'''\u201d.\n*The words will always have a graphic accent. This will be an overwhelming use of accents, but it is the only way to effectively represent both the stressed syllable and vowel aperture.\n*To show an elided vowel in certain variants an apostrophe '''\u2019''' will be used.\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n\nThe vocabulary of Cape Verdean Creole comes mainly from Portuguese. Although the several sources do not agree, the figures oscillate between 90 to 95% of words from Portuguese. The remaining comes from several languages from Western Africa ([[Mandinka language|Mandingo]], [[Wolof language|Wolof]], [[Fula language|Fulani]], [[Temne language|Temne]], [[Balanta language|Balanta]], [[Mandjak language|Mandjak]], etc.), and the vocabulary from other languages (English, French, [[Latin]]) is negligible.\n\n== Phonology ==\n\nCape Verdean Creole's phonological system comes mainly from 15th-through-17th-century Portuguese. In terms of conservative features, Creole has kept the [[affricate consonant]]<nowiki/>s {{IPA|/d\u0292/}} and {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} (written \u201cj\u201d (in the beginning of words) and \u201cch\u201d, in old Portuguese) which are not in use in today's Portuguese, and the pre-tonic vowels were not reduced as in today's [[European Portuguese]]. In terms of innovative features, the phoneme {{IPA|/\u028e/}} (written \u201clh\u201d in Portuguese) has evolved to {{IPA|/d\u0292/}} and the vowels have undergone several phonetic phenomena.\n\n===Vowels===\nThere are eight oral vowels and their corresponding nasal counterparts, making a total of sixteen vowels:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2| &nbsp; ||colspan=2|[[Front vowel|Front]]||colspan=2|[[Central vowel|Central]]||colspan=2|[[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-align=center\n!<small>oral</small>\n!<small>nasal</small>\n!<small>oral</small>\n!<small>nasal</small>\n!<small>oral</small>\n!<small>nasal</small>\n|-align=center\n![[Close vowel|Close]]\n|{{IPA|i}} || {{IPA|\u0129}}|| colspan=2|&nbsp; ||{{IPA|u}} || {{IPA|\u0169}}\n|-align=center\n![[Close-mid vowel|Close-mid]]\n|{{IPA|e}} || {{IPA|\u1ebd}}|| colspan=2|&nbsp; ||{{IPA|o}} || {{IPA|\u00f5}}\n|-align=center\n![[Open-mid vowel|Open-mid]]\n|{{IPA|\u025b}}||{{IPA|\u025b\u0303}} ||{{IPA|\u0250}} || {{IPA|\u0250\u0303}} ||{{IPA|\u0254}}||{{IPA|\u0254\u0303}}\n|-align=center\n![[Open vowel|Open]]\n| colspan=2|&nbsp; ||{{IPA|a}}||{{IPA|\u00e3}} || colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|}\n\n<!---Hiding text while the translation is not finished\n====Descriptions====\n{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n!Phoneme ||Example ||Translation to English ||Description\n|-\n|{{IPA|/i/}} ||''l'''\u00ed''''' {{IPA|/li/}}<br>''s'''\u00ed''''' {{IPA|[si]}} ||here<br>if ||Close front unrounded, <br>like in Portuguese ''b'''i'''co''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u0129/}} ||''s'''\u00edm''''' {{IPA|/s\u0129/}} ||yes ||Close front unrounded nasal, <br>like in Portuguese ''f'''im'''''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/e/}} ||''l'''\u00ea''''' {{IPA|/le/}}<br>''b'''\u00ea'''ra'' {{IPA|/\u02c8be\u027e\u0250/}}<br>''s'''\u00ea''''' {{IPA|/se/}} ||to read<br>edge<br>his, her ||Close-mid front unrounded, <br> like in Portuguese ''d'''e'''do''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u1ebd/}} ||''s'''\u00eam''''' {{IPA|/s\u1ebd/}} ||without ||Close-mid front unrounded nasal, <br>like in Portuguese ''p'''en'''sar''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u025b/}} ||''b'''\u00e9'''ra'' {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u025b\u027e\u0250/}}<br>''B'''\u00e9'''la'' {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u025bl\u0250/}}<br>''s'''\u00e9'''da'' {{IPA|/\u02c8s\u025bd\u0250/}} ||mean (adj.)<br>Bela (name)<br>silk ||Open-mid front unrounded, <br>like in Portuguese ''f'''\u00e9'''''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u025b}}\u0303/ ||''s'''\u00e9n'''da'' {{IPA|/\u02c8s\u025b\u0303d\u0250/}} ||path ||Open-mid front unrounded nasal, <br>close to Portuguese ''f'''\u00e9''''', but with nasality.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u0250/}} ||''c'''a'''b'''\u00e2''''' {{IPA|/k\u0250\u02c8b\u0250/}}<br>''p'''\u00e2''''' ||to finish<br>for, by ||Near-open central, <br>like in (European) Portuguese ''p'''a'''r'''a'''''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u0250\u0303/}} ||''c'''am'''b\u00e2'' {{IPA|/k\u0250\u0303\u02c8b\u0250/}} ||TRANSLATE: enfiar-se, desaparecer ||Near-open central nasal, <br>like in Portuguese ''d'''an'''\u00e7ar''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/a/}} ||''b'''\u00e1'''la'' {{IPA|/\u02c8bal\u0250/}}<br>''b'''\u00e1'''da'' {{IPA|/\u02c8bad\u0250/}}<br>''p'''\u00e1''''' ||bullet<br>TRANSLATE: ida<br>shovel ||Open front unrounded, <br>like in Portuguese ''p'''\u00e1'''''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u00e3/}} ||''b'''\u00e1n'''da'' {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u00e3d\u0250/}} ||side ||Open front unrounded nasal, <br>close to Portuguese ''p'''\u00e1''''', but with nasality.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/u/}} ||''b'''\u00fa''''' {{IPA|/bu/}}<br>''m'''\u00fa'''d'''u''''' {{IPA|/\u02c8mudu/}} ||you<br>dumb ||Close back rounded, <br>like in Portuguese ''t'''u'''''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u0169/}} ||''m'''\u00fan'''du'' {{IPA|/\u02c8m\u0169du/}} ||world ||Close back rounded nasal, <br>like in Portuguese '''''um'''''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/o/}} ||''cin'''\u00f4'''ra'' {{IPA|/si\u02c8no\u027e\u0250/}}<br>''b'''\u00f4''''' {{IPA|/bo/}}<br>''p'''\u00f4''''' {{IPA|/po/}} ||carrot<br>you<br>to put ||Close-mid back rounded, <br>like in Portuguese ''b'''o'''ca''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u00f5/}} ||''p'''\u00f5''''' {{IPA|/p\u00f5/}} ||bread ||Close-mid back rounded nasal, <br>like in Portuguese ''c'''on'''vite''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u0254/}} ||''b'''\u00f3'''la'' {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u0254l\u0250/}}<br>''sinh'''\u00f3'''ra'' {{IPA|/si\u02c8\u0272\u0254\u027e\u0250/}}<br>''m'''\u00f3'''da'' {{IPA|/\u02c8m\u0254d\u0250/}} ||ball<br>lady<br>like (prep.) ||Open-mid back rounded, <br>like in Portuguese ''s'''\u00f3'''''.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u0254}}\u0303/ ||''m'''\u00f3n'''da'' {{IPA|/\u02c8m\u0254\u0303d\u0250/}} ||TRANSLATE: acto de tirar ervas daninhas ||Open-mid back rounded nasal, <br>close to Portuguese ''s'''\u00f3''''', but with nasality.\n|}\n--->\n\n===Consonants and semi-vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! colspan=2 | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Dental consonant|Dental]]/<br>[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Postalveolar consonant|Postalveolar]]/<br>[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n|-align=center\n!

In the Sotavento variants that consonant {{IPA|[m]}} was reduced to a simple nasality {{IPA|[n\u0329]}}. For example: ''m\u2019 and\u00e2'' {{IPA|[n\u0329 \u0250\u0303\u02c8d\u0250]}} ('I have walked'), ''m\u2019 st\u00e2 t\u00e2 sint\u00ed'' {{IPA|[n\u0329 st\u0250 t\u0250 s\u0129\u02c8ti]}} ('I am feeling'), ''m\u2019 lab\u00e1ba'' {{IPA|[n\u0329 l\u0250\u02c8bab\u0250]}} ('I had washed'). Before plosive or affricate consonants this nasality becomes [[homorganic]] nasal of the following consonant. For ex.: ''m\u2019 b\u00eam'' {{IPA|[m b\u1ebd]}} ('I came'), ''m\u2019 t\u00eam'' {{IPA|[n t\u1ebd]}} ('I have'), ''m\u2019 tchig\u00e2'' {{IPA|[\u0272 t\u0283i\u02c8\u0261\u0250]}} ('I arrived'), ''m\u2019 cr\u00ea'' {{IPA|[\u014b k\u027ee]}} ('I want').\n\nSpeakers who are strongly influenced by the Portuguese language tend to pronounce this pronoun as a '''nasal vowel''' ''\u00fam'' {{IPA|[\u0169]}} instead of ''m\u2019'' {{IPA|[m]}}.\n\nBefore some forms of the verb ''s\u00ear'' this pronoun takes back its full form '''''m\u00ed''''' {{IPA|[mi]}}, in whatever variant: ''m\u00ed \u00ea'' {{IPA|[mi e]}} (\u2018I am\u2019), ''m\u00ed \u00e9ra'' {{IPA|[mi \u02c8\u025b\u027e\u0250]}} (\u2018I was\u2019).\n\nIn this article, this pronoun is conventionally written ''m\u2019'', no matter the variant.\n\n<!---\n====Semivowels====\n{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n!Phoneme ||Example ||Translation to English ||Description\n|-\n|{{IPA|/j/}} ||''b\u00e1'''i''''' {{IPA|/baj/}} ||to go ||Palatal approximant, <br>like in English '''y'''es.\n|-\n|{{IPA|/w/}} ||''c\u00ea'''u''''' {{IPA|/sew/}} ||sky ||Labial-velar approximant, <br>like in English '''w'''ater.\n|}\n--->\n\n[[Image:Cape Verdean Creole linguistic books.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Some linguistic books about the creole.]]\n\n== Grammar ==\n\nEven though over 90% of Cape Verdean Creole words are derived from Portuguese, the grammar is very different, which makes it extremely difficult for an untrained Portuguese native speaker even to understand a basic conversation. On the other hand, the grammar shows a lot of similarities with other creoles, Portuguese-based or not (check [[syntactic similarities of creoles]]).\n\n===Sentence structure===\nThe basic sentence structure in Creole is Subject{{spaced ndash}}Verb{{spaced ndash}}Object. Ex.:\n*''\u00cal t\u00e2 cum\u00ea p\u00eaxi.'' \u201cHe eats fish.\u201d\n\nWhen there are two objects, the indirect object comes first while the direct object comes after, and the sentence structure becomes Subject{{spaced ndash}}Verb{{spaced ndash}}Indirect Object{{spaced ndash}}Direct Object. Ex.:\n*''\u00cal t\u00e2 d\u00e2 p\u00eaxi cum\u00edda.'' \u201cHe gives food to the fish.\u201d\n\nA feature that makes Cape Verdean Creole closer to other creoles is the possibility of [[double negation]] (ex.: ''N\u00e1da m\u2019 c\u00e2 atch\u00e2.'' liter. \u201cNothing I didn\u2019t find.\u201d), or sometimes even triple negation (ex.: ''N\u00fanca ningu\u00eam c\u00e2 t\u00e2 b\u00e1ba l\u00e2.'' liter. \u201cNever nobody didn\u2019t go there.\u201d). Although double negation is common in Portuguese (e.g. \"Nunca ningu\u00e9m foi l\u00e1\"), triple negation is a little bit uncommon.\n\n===Nouns===\n\n====Gender inflection====\nOnly the animated nouns (human beings and animals) have gender inflection. Ex.:\n*''ingl\u00eas'' / ''ingl\u00e9sa'' \u201cEnglishman / Englishwoman\u201d\n*''p\u00f4rcu'' / ''p\u00f3rca'' \u201cpig (male) / pig (female)\u201d\n\nIn some cases the distinction between sexes is made putting the adjectives ''m\u00e1tchu'' \u201cmale\u201d and ''f\u00e9mia'' \u201cfemale\u201d after the nouns. Ex.:\n*''f\u00eddju-m\u00e1tchu'' / ''f\u00eddju-f\u00e9mia'' \u201cson / daughter\u201d\n*''catch\u00f4rr\u2019-m\u00e1tchu'' / ''catch\u00f4rr\u2019-f\u00e9mia'' \u201cdog (male) / dog (female)\u201d\n\n====Number inflection====\nThe nouns in Creole have number inflection (plural marks) only when they are well determined or known in the context. Ex.:\n* ''Min\u00ednus d\u00ed B\u00eda \u00ea b\u00eam comport\u00e1du.'' (\u201cThe children of Bia are well behaved.\u201d)\n\nWhen the noun refers to something in general that noun does not have number inflection. Ex.:\n* ''Min\u00ednu dev\u00ea ruspet\u00e2 algu\u00eam gr\u00e1ndi.'' (\u201cChildren must respect grown up people.\u201d)\n\nIf in a sentence there are several grammatical categories, only the first bears the plural marker. Ex.:\n* ''min\u00ednu'''s''''' (\u201cboys\u201d)\n* ''nh\u00e2'''s''' min\u00edna'' (\u201cmy girls\u201d)\n* ''min\u00ednu'''s''' bun\u00edtu'' (\u201cbeautiful boys\u201d)\n* ''nh\u00e2'''s''' d\u00f4s min\u00edna bun\u00edta \u00ed simp\u00e1tica'' (\u201cmy two kind and beautiful girls\u201d)\n\n:''Further reading:'' {{cite book |title=Introdu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 Gram\u00e1tica do Crioulo |author=Manuel Veiga |edition=2 |p=139\u2013141 |chapter=5.2 \u2013 Flex\u00f5es dos substantivos |language=pt}}\n\n===Personal pronouns===\nAccording to their function, the pronouns can be '''subject''' pronouns or '''object''' pronouns. Furthermore, in each of these functions, according to the position within the sentence the pronouns can be '''unstressed''' or '''stressed'''.\n\nThe '''unstressed''' subject pronouns generally bear the function of the subject and the come before the verb. Ex.:\n*'''''N\u00fa''' cr\u00ea.'' \u201c'''We''' want.\u201d\n\nThe '''stressed''' subject pronouns bear the function of some kind of vocative and usually are separated from the verb ([[disjunctive pronoun]]s). Ex.:\n*'''''M\u00ed''', m\u2019 st\u00e2 l\u00ed, \u00ed '''b\u00f4''', b\u00fa st\u00e2 l\u00e2.'' \u201c'''Me''', I am here, and '''you''', you are there.\u201d\n\nThe object pronouns, as the name shows, bear the function of the object (direct or indirect). The '''unstressed''' object pronouns are used with the present-tense forms of verbs. Ex.:\n*''M\u2019 odj\u00e1-'''\u2019l'''.'' \u201cI have seen '''it'''.\u201d\n*''M\u2019 t\u00e2 bej\u00e1-'''bu'''.'' \u201cI kiss '''you'''.\u201d\n\nThe '''stressed''' object pronouns are used with the past-tense forms of verbs, when they are the second pronoun in a series of two pronouns, and after prepositions ([[prepositional pronoun]]s). Ex.:\n*''\u00cas t\u00e2 odj\u00e1ba-'''\u00eal'''.'' \u201cThey saw '''it'''.\u201d\n*''B\u00fa d\u00e2-m\u2019-'''\u00eal'''.'' \u201cYou gave '''it''' to me.\u201d\n*''M\u2019 st\u00e2 f\u00e1rtu d\u00ed '''b\u00f4'''!'' \u201cI\u2019m fed up of '''you'''!\u201d\n\nWhen there are two object pronouns, the indirect pronoun comes first while the direct pronoun comes after, and the sentence structure becomes Subject{{spaced ndash}}Verb{{spaced ndash}}Indirect Pronoun{{spaced ndash}}Direct Pronoun.\n\nThere are no reflexive pronouns. To indicate reflexivity, Creole uses the expression ''cab\u00e9\u00e7a'' (\"head\") after the possessive determiner. Ex.:\n*''\u00cas mord\u00ea s\u00eas cab\u00e9\u00e7a.'' \u201cThey have bitten themselves.\u201d\n\nThere are no reciprocal pronouns. To indicate reciprocity, Creole uses the expression ''cumpanh\u00earu'' (\"companion\"). Ex.:\n*''\u00cas mord\u00ea cumpanh\u00earu.'' \u201cThey have bitten each other.\u201d\n\n===Verbs===\nThe verbs have only minimal inflection (two forms). They have the same form for all the persons, and the notions of tense, mood and aspect are expressed through the presence (or absence) of certain morphemes (called \u201c'''verbal actualizers'''\u201d by Veiga<ref name=\"Veiga\" />), as in the majority of creoles.\n\nThe verbs are generally reduced to two base forms, one for the '''present''', another for the '''past'''. The form for the '''present''' is the same to the form for the '''infinitive''' (exception: ''s\u00ear'' \u201cto be\u201d), that in turn comes, in the majority of the verbs, from the infinitive in Portuguese but without the final ''r''. Ex.: ''cant\u00e2'' {{IPA|/k\u0250\u0303\u02c8t\u0250/}} (from Portuguese ''cantar''), ''mex\u00ea'' {{IPA|/me\u02c8\u0283e/}} (from Portuguese ''mexer''), ''part\u00ed'' {{IPA|/p\u0250\u027e\u02c8ti/}} (from Portuguese ''partir''), ''comp\u00f4'' {{IPA|/k\u00f5\u02c8po/}} (from Portuguese ''compor''), ''*lumb\u00fa'' {{IPA|/l\u0169\u02c8bu/}} (from Portuguese ''lombo''). The form for the '''past''' is formed from the infinitive to which is joined the particle for the past ''~ba''. Ex.: ''cant\u00e1ba'' {{IPA|/k\u0250\u0303\u02c8tab\u0250/}}, ''mex\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/me\u02c8\u0283eb\u0250/}}, ''part\u00edba'' {{IPA|/p\u0250\u027e\u02c8tib\u0250/}}, ''comp\u00f4ba'' {{IPA|/k\u00f5\u02c8pob\u0250/}}, ''*lumb\u00faba'' {{IPA|/l\u0169\u02c8bub\u0250/}} (in the Barlavento variants, the particle for the past ''~va'' (or ''~ba'') is joined to the '''imperfective actualizer''', and not to the verb). It is noteworthy that the Upper Guinea creoles (Cape Verdean Creole and [[Guinea-Bissau Creole]]) put the past tense marker after the verbs, and not before like the majority of creoles (check [[syntactic similarities of creoles]]).\n\nIt is important to mention that in the Santiago variant, the stress goes back to before the last syllable in the present tense forms of the verbs. Therefore, we have: ''c\u00e1nta'' {{IPA|/\u02c8k\u00e3t\u0250/}} instead of ''cant\u00e2'' {{IPA|/k\u0250\u0303\u02c8t\u0250/}}, ''m\u00eaxe'' {{IPA|/\u02c8me\u0283e/}} or ''m\u00eaxi'' {{IPA|/\u02c8me\u0283i/}} instead of ''mex\u00ea'' {{IPA|/me\u02c8\u0283e/}}, ''p\u00e2rti'' {{IPA|/\u02c8p\u0250\u027eti/}} instead of ''part\u00ed'' {{IPA|/p\u0250\u027e\u02c8ti/}}, ''c\u00f4mpo'' {{IPA|/\u02c8k\u00f5po/}} or ''c\u00f4mpu'' {{IPA|/\u02c8k\u00f5pu/}} instead of ''comp\u00f4'' {{IPA|/k\u00f5\u02c8po/}}, ''b\u00fambu'' {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u0169bu/}} instead of ''bumb\u00fa'' {{IPA|/b\u0169\u02c8bu/}}. In the pronominal forms, however, the stress remains on the last syllable: ''cant\u00e2-m\u2019'' {{IPA|/k\u0250\u0303\u02c8t\u0250\u0303/}}, ''mex\u00ea-bu'' {{IPA|/me\u02c8\u0283ebu/}}, ''part\u00ed-\u2019l'' {{IPA|/p\u0250\u027e\u02c8til/}}, ''comp\u00f4-nu'' {{IPA|/k\u00f5\u02c8ponu/}}, ''bumb\u00fa-\u2019s'' {{IPA|/b\u0169\u02c8buz/}}.\n\n====Regular verbs====\nAs was said before, the regular verbs are reduced to a form for the present tense and a form for the past tense, and the notions of mood and aspect are expressed through verbal actualizers.\n\nThe following table shows a paradigm of the indicative mood with the verb ''d\u00e2'' \u201cto give\u201d in the first-person singular:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! &nbsp; ||Present Tense ||Past Tense\n|-\n|[[Perfective aspect]] ||''M\u2019 d\u00e2'' ||''M\u2019 d\u00e1ba''\n|-\n|[[Imperfective aspect]] ||''M\u2019 t\u00e2 d\u00e2'' ||''M\u2019 t\u00e2 d\u00e1ba''\n|-\n|[[Progressive aspect]] ||''M\u2019 st\u00e2 t\u00e2 d\u00e2'' ||''M\u2019 st\u00e1ba t\u00e2 da''\n|}\n\nThe '''perfective''' aspect of the '''present''' is used when the speech refers to present situations, but that are finished, that are complete. Ex.:\n:''M\u2019 d\u00e2.'' {{IPA|[m d\u0250]}} \u201cI gave. / I have given.\u201d\n:It corresponds roughly, according to context, to the '''past tense''' or '''present perfect''' in English.\n\nThe '''imperfective''' aspect of the '''present''' is used when the speech refers to present situations, but that are not finished yet, that are incomplete.

The '''future of the present''' may be expressed through three resources:\n#Using the imperfective of the present but bearing the function of the future. Ex.: ''M\u2019 t\u00e2 d\u00e2 manh\u00e3.'' {{IPA|[m t\u0250 d\u0250 m\u0250\u02c8\u0272\u0250\u0303]}} liter. \u201cI give tomorrow.\u201d\n#Using the auxiliary verb \u201cto go\u201d.

Ex.: ''M\u2019 t\u00e2 b\u00e1ba d\u00e2.'' {{IPA|[m t\u0250 \u02c8bab\u0250 d\u0250]}} liter. \u201cI went to give.\u201d\n#Using a periphrasis showing an eventuality. Ex.: ''M\u2019 \u00e1l d\u00e1ba. '' [m al {{IPA|\u02c8dab\u0250]}} \u201cI would give.\u201d\n:It corresponds roughly to the '''conditional''' in English.\n\nThe remaining moods{{spaced ndash}}subjunctive, conditional (not the same as \u201cconditional\u201d in English), eventual{{spaced ndash}}do not have different aspects, only present and past tense, except the injunctive (imperative) mood which has only the present tense.\n\n====Irregular verbs====\nThere is a group of verbs that do not follow the paradigmatic model presented above. They are the '''auxiliary verbs''' ''s\u00ear'' {{IPA|/se\u027e/}} \u201cto be\u201d, ''st\u00e2'' {{IPA|/st\u0250/}} \u201cto be\u201d, ''t\u00eam'' {{IPA|/t\u1ebd/}} \u201cto have\u201d and ''ten\u00ea'' {{IPA|/te\u02c8ne/}} \u201cto have\u201d, and the '''modal verbs''' ''cr\u00ea'' {{IPA|/k\u027ee/}} \u201cto want\u201d, ''sab\u00ea'' {{IPA|/s\u0250\u02c8be/}} \u201cto know\u201d, ''pod\u00ea'' {{IPA|/po\u02c8de/}} \u201ccan\u201d, ''dev\u00ea'' {{IPA|/de\u02c8ve/}} \u201cmust\u201d and ''mest\u00ea'' {{IPA|/mes\u02c8te/}} \u201cto need\u201d.\n: <small>Note.: The designation \u201cauxiliary verbs\u201d is not consensual.</small>\n\nThere exist two registers for these verbs.\n\nIn the ''first register'' (in older speakers, in rural areas speakers or in speakers with little exposure to Portuguese) there are only two forms for the verbs: one for the present (''\u00ea'' {{IPA|/e/}}, ''st\u00e2'' {{IPA|/st\u0250/}}, ''t\u00eam'' {{IPA|/t\u1ebd/}}, ''ten\u00ea'' {{IPA|/te\u02c8ne/}}, ''cr\u00ea'' {{IPA|/k\u027ee/}}, ''sab\u00ea'' {{IPA|/s\u0250\u02c8be/}}, ''pod\u00ea'' {{IPA|/po\u02c8de/}}, ''dev\u00ea'' {{IPA|/de\u02c8ve/}}, ''mest\u00ea'' {{IPA|/mes\u02c8te/}}) and one for the past (''\u00e9ra'' {{IPA|/\u02c8\u025b\u027e\u0250/}}, ''st\u00e1ba'' {{IPA|/stab\u0250/}}, ''t\u00eamba'' /t\u1ebd{{IPA|b\u0250/}}, ''ten\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/te\u02c8neb\u0250/}}, ''cr\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/k\u027eeb\u0250/}}, ''sab\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/s\u0250\u02c8beb\u0250/}}, ''pod\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/po\u02c8deb\u0250/}}, ''dev\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/de\u02c8veb\u0250/}}, ''mest\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/mes\u02c8teb\u0250/}}). However, on the contrary of regular verbs, when the base form is used alone it represents the '''imperfective aspect''' and not the '''perfective aspect'''. Therefore, ''m\u00ed \u00ea'', ''m\u2019 t\u00eam'', ''m\u2019 cr\u00ea'', ''m\u2019 sab\u00ea'' mean \u201cI am, I have, I want, I know\u201d, and not \u201cI\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve had, I\u2019ve wanted, I\u2019ve known\u201d, as it would be expected. Parallelly, ''m\u00ed \u00e9ra'', ''m\u2019 t\u00eamba'', ''m\u2019 cr\u00eaba'', ''m\u2019 sab\u00eaba'' mean \u201cI was, I had, I wanted, I knew\u201d, and not \u201cI had been, I had had, I had wanted, I had known\u201d, as would be expected.\n\nIn the ''second register'' (among younger speakers, in urban areas or in speakers with more exposure to Portuguese) the system has been enriched with other forms influenced by Portuguese. Therefore, we have:\n*''\u00ea'' {{IPA|/e/}}, ''st\u00e2'' {{IPA|/st\u0250/}}, ''t\u00eam'' {{IPA|/t\u1ebd/}}, ''cr\u00ea'' {{IPA|/k\u027ee/}}, ''sab\u00ea'' {{IPA|/s\u0250\u02c8be/}}, ''pod\u00ea'' {{IPA|/po\u02c8de/}}, ''dev\u00ea'' {{IPA|/de\u02c8ve/}}, ''mest\u00ea'' {{IPA|/mes\u02c8te/}} for the imperfective of the present;\n*''f\u00f4i'' {{IPA|/foj/}}, ''st\u00eavi'' {{IPA|/\u02c8st}}evi/, ''t\u00eavi'' {{IPA|/\u02c8te}}vi/, ''cr\u00eds'' {{IPA|/k\u027eis/}}, ''s\u00f4bi'' {{IPA|/\u02c8so}}bi/, ''p\u00fadi'' {{IPA|/\u02c8pu}}di/ for the perfective of the present;\n*''\u00e9ra'' {{IPA|/\u02c8\u025b\u027e\u0250/}}, ''st\u00e1ba'' {{IPA|/\u02c8stab\u0250/}}, ''t\u00ednha'' {{IPA|/\u02c8ti\u0272\u0250/}}, ''cr\u00eda'' {{IPA|/\u02c8k\u027ei\u0250/}}, ''sab\u00eda'' {{IPA|/s\u0250\u02c8bi\u0250/}}, ''pud\u00eda'' {{IPA|/pu\u02c8di\u0250/}}, ''div\u00eda'' {{IPA|/di\u02c8vi\u0250/}}, ''mist\u00eda'' {{IPA|/mis\u02c8ti\u0250/}} for the imperfective of the past;\n*''s\u00earba'' {{IPA|/\u02c8se\u027eb\u0250/}}, ''st\u00e1ba'' {{IPA|/\u02c8stab\u0250/}}, ''t\u00eamba'' {{IPA|/\u02c8t}}\u1ebd{{IPA|b\u0250/}}, ''cr\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/\u02c8k\u027eeb\u0250/}}, ''sab\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/s\u0250\u02c8beb\u0250/}}, ''pod\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/po\u02c8deb\u0250/}}, ''dev\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/de\u02c8veb\u0250/}}, ''mest\u00eaba'' {{IPA|/mes\u02c8teb\u0250/}} for the perfective of the past;\n:<small>Note.: Some authors<ref>Quint, N.{{spaced ndash}}2000</ref> call these verbs \u201cstative verbs\u201d and to these verbs they add others: ''gost\u00e2'', ''conx\u00ea'', ''merec\u00ea'', ''mor\u00e2'', ''tchom\u00e2'', ''val\u00ea''. However that designation is contested: not all those verbs are in fact stative; not all those verbs are irregular (for ex. ''mor\u00e2''); some of those verbs are regular in some variants (''m\u2019 t\u00e2 gost\u00e2''{{spaced ndash}}imperfective of the present with ''t\u00e2''), and irregulars in other variants (''m\u2019 gost\u00e2''{{spaced ndash}}imperfective of the present but '''without''' ''t\u00e2'').</small>\n\nThere is a parallelism between the pair of the verbs ''s\u00ear'' / ''st\u00e2'' \u201cto be\u201d and the pair of the verbs ''t\u00eam'' / ''ten\u00ea'' \u201cto have\u201d.\n*The verb ''s\u00ear'' is a copulative verb that expresses a permanent quality. Ex.:\n::''M\u00ed \u00ea \u00fam \u00f3mi.'' {{IPA|/mi e \u0169 \u02c8\u0254mi/}} \u201cI am (I\u2019ve always been and I will always be) a man.\u201d\n*The verb ''st\u00e2'' is a copulative verb that expresses a temporary state.

The verb ''ten\u00ea'' does not exist in the Barlavento variants. In S\u00e3o Vicente and Santo Ant\u00e3o the verb ''st\u00e2'' has the form ''st\u00f3d\u2019'' for the infinitive, ''t\u00e2'' for the imperfective of the present, ''t\u00edv\u2019'' for the perfective of the present, and ''t\u00e1va'' for the imperfective of the past.</small>\n\n====Passive====\nCape Verdean Creole has two '''voices'''. The '''active''' voice is used when the subject is explicit. The '''passive''' voice is used when the subject is indeterminate or unknown. There is also two forms for the passive. The form for the present is made with the infinitive to which is joined the particle ''~du''. The form for the past is made with the infinitive to which is joined the particle ''~da''. Ex.:\n* ''T\u00e2 papi\u00e1du ingl\u00eas n\u00e2 M\u00e9rca.'' {{IPA|/t\u0250 p\u0250pi\u02c8adu}} {{IPA|\u0129\u02c8\u0261lez}} {{IPA|n\u0250 \u02c8m\u025b\u027ek\u0250/}} \u201cEnglish is spoken in America.\u201d\n* ''M\u2019 inxin\u00e1du t\u00e2 and\u00e2.'' {{IPA|/m \u0129\u0283i\u02c8nadu t\u0250 \u0250\u0303\u02c8d\u0250/}} \u201cI was taught to walk.\u201d\n* ''\u00dam v\u00eaz, t\u00e2 cum\u00eada tch\u00eau m\u00eddju.'' {{IPA|/\u0169 vez t\u0250 ku\u02c8med\u0250 t\u0283ew \u02c8mid\u0292u/}} \u201cOnce, one used to eat a lot of corn.\u201d\n:<small>Note.: In the Barlavento variants the form for the past does not exist.</small>\n\n====Negative====\nTo negate a verb, the negative adverb ''c\u00e2'' {{IPA|/k\u0250/}} is used after the subject and before any verbal actualizer. Ex.:\n*''N\u00fa c\u00e2 t\u00e2 beb\u00ea.'' {{IPA|/nu k\u0250 t\u0250 be\u02c8be/}} \u201cWe don\u2019t drink.\u201d\n*''\u00cal c\u00e2 t\u00e2 odj\u00e1ba.'' {{IPA|/el k\u0250 t\u0250 o\u02c8d\u0292ab\u0250/}} \u201cHe didn\u2019t see.\u201d\n*''B\u00fa c\u00e2 b\u00e1i.'' {{IPA|/bu k\u0250 baj/}} \u201cYou haven\u2019t gone.\u201d\n\nIn the Santo Ant\u00e3o variant, the negative adverb is ''n\u2019'' {{IPA|/n/}}. Ex.:\n*''N\u00f4 n\u2019 d\u00e2 bib\u00ea.'' {{IPA|/no n d\u0250 bi\u02c8be/}} \u201cWe don\u2019t drink.\u201d\n*''\u00cal n\u2019 d\u00e1va o\u2019\u00e1.'' {{IPA|/el n dav\u0250 o\u02c8a/}} \u201cHe didn\u2019t see.\u201d\n*''B\u00f4 n\u2019 b\u00e9.'' {{IPA|/bo n b\u025b/}} \u201cYou haven\u2019t gone.\u201d\n\nIn imperative sentences the negative adverb ''c\u00e2'' {{IPA|/k\u0250/}} is always in the beginning. Ex.:\n*''C\u00e2 b\u00fa b\u00e1i!'' {{IPA|/k\u0250 bu baj/}} \u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d (you{{spaced ndash}}singular)\n*''C\u00e2 nh\u00f4s faz\u00ea!'' {{IPA|/k\u0250 \u0272oz f\u0250\u02c8ze/}} (Sotavento), ''C\u00e2 b\u2019s\u00f4t\u2019 faz\u00ea!'' {{IPA|/k\u0250 bzot f\u0250\u02c8ze/}} (Barlavento) \u201cDon\u2019t do!\u201d (you-plural)\n\nAnd in the Santo Ant\u00e3o variant:\n*''N\u2019 b\u00f4 b\u00e9!'' /n bo {{IPA|b\u025b/}} \u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d (you{{spaced ndash}}singular)\n*''N\u2019 b\u2019s\u00f4t\u2019 fez\u00ea!'' {{IPA|/n bzot fe\u02c8ze/}} \u201cDon\u2019t do!\u201d (you{{spaced ndash}}plural)\n\n===Adjectives===\nAdjectives in Creole almost always come after the noun. Only the animated nouns (human beings and animals) demand gender inflection in their adjectives. Ex.:\n*''\u00f3mi f\u00eaiu'' / ''mudj\u00ear f\u00eaia'' \u201cugly man / ugly woman\u201d\n*''b\u00f3di pr\u00eatu'' / ''c\u00e1bra pr\u00e9ta'' \u201cblack buck / black goat\u201d\n\nThe adjectives for unanimated nouns have the same form as the masculine adjectives. Ex.:\n*''bist\u00eddu br\u00e1ncu'' \u201cwhite dress\u201d\n*''cam\u00edsa br\u00e1ncu'' \u201cwhite shirt\u201d\n\nIn general the plural marker does not appear on adjectives since it comes in a preceding grammatical category.\n\n===Determiners===\nIn Creole there are no definite articles. If it is absolutely necessary to determine the noun, the [[demonstrative]] determiners are used instead.\n\nFor the indefinite articles there are two forms, one for the singular, another for the plural:\n*''\u00fam\u2026'' {{IPA|/\u0169/}} \u201ca, an (singular)\u201d, ''\u00fans\u2026'' {{IPA|/\u0169z/}} \u201ca, an (plural)\u201d\n\nThe possessive determiners have number inflexion, but the plural refers to the objects possessed, and not to the owners. Ex.:\n*''nh\u00e2 c\u00e1rru'' \u201cmy car\u201d\n*''nh\u00e2s c\u00e1rru'' \u201cmy cars\u201d\n*''n\u00f4s c\u00e1rru'' can be either \u201cour car\u201d or \u201cour cars\u201d\n\nThe demonstrative determiners have only two degrees of proximity: close to the speaker (''\u00eass'' \u201cthis, these\u201d) and away from the speaker (''qu\u00eal'' \u201cthat\u201d, ''qu\u00eas'' \u201cthose\u201d).\n:<small>Note.: Only the S\u00e3o Vicente and Santo Ant\u00e3o Creoles make a phonetic distinction between the singular ''\u00eass'' {{IPA|/es/}} (\u201cthis\u201d) and the plural ''\u00eas'' {{IPA|/e\u0292/}} (\u201cthese\u201d).</small>\n\n===Designatives===\nCreole possesses a special grammatical category for presenting or announcing something. It appears in two forms, one to present something near, (''al\u00ed\u2026'' {{IPA|/\u0250\u02c8li/}}) and another to present something far (''al\u00e2\u2026'' {{IPA|/\u0250\u02c8l\u0250/}}). Ex.:\n*''Al\u00ed nh\u00e2 f\u00eddju.'' \u201cHere is my son.\u201d\n*''Al\u00e1-\u2019l t\u00e2 b\u00e1i.'' \u201cThere he goes.\u201d\n\n==Dialects==\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2013}}\nIn spite of Cape Verde's small size, each island has developed its own way of speaking Creole. Each of these nine ways (there are 10 islands, one of which is uninhabited) is justifiably a different [[dialect]], but the scholars in Cape Verde usually call them \u201cvariants\u201d. These variants can be classified into two branches: in the South there are the Sotavento Creoles, which comprise the [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]], [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]], [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] and [[Maio, Cape Verde|Maio]] variants; in the North there are the Barlavento Creoles, which comprise the [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]], [[Sal, Cape Verde|Sal]], [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]], [[S\u00e3o Vicente, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Vicente]] and [[Santo Ant\u00e3o, Cape Verde|Santo Ant\u00e3o]] variants.\n\nSince some [[Word|lexical]] forms of Cape Verdean Creole can be different according to each variant, the words and the sentences in this article will be presented in compromise model, a kind of \u201cmiddle Creole\u201d, in order to ease the understanding and in order not to favor any variant. Whenever it will be necessary the [[Phoneme#Notation|phonemic transcription]] (or sometimes the [[phonetic transcription]]) will be shown immediately after the word.\n\nFor the writing system, check the section [[Cape Verdean Creole#Writing system|Writing system]].\n\nFrom a linguistic point of view, the most important variants are the Fogo, Santiago, S\u00e3o Nicolau and Santo Ant\u00e3o ones, and any deep study of Creole should approach at least these four. They are the only islands that have received slaves directly from the African continent, that possess the most conservative linguistic features, and that are the most distinct from each other.\n\nFrom a social point of view, the most important variants are the Santiago and S\u00e3o Vicente ones, and any light study of Creole should approach at least these two. They are the variants of the two bigger cities ([[Praia]] and [[Mindelo]]), the variants with the greatest number of speakers, and the variants with a [[glottophagy|glottophagist]] tendency over the neighboring ones.\n\nThese variants have significant literature:\n* Brava: Eug\u00e9nio Tavares\n* Fogo: [[Elsie Clews Parsons]]\n* Santiago: Carlos Barbosa, Tom\u00e9 Varela da Silva, Daniel Sp\u00ednola\n* S\u00e3o Vicente: S\u00e9rgio Frusoni, Ov\u00eddio Martins\n* Santo Ant\u00e3o: Lu\u00eds Romano Madeira de Melo\n\n;Dialectal differences:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Sotavento Creoles]] ||colspan=\"3\"|[[Barlavento Creoles]] ||rowspan=\"2\"|English\n|-\n!

Its runway was operated by [[RAF St Mawgan]] before 2008, and is now owned by [[Cornwall Council]].\n\nThe airport handled 461,300 passengers in 2017, a 24.2% increase over the previous year.<ref name=\"stats\"/> Newquay has a [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|CAA]] Public Use Aerodrome Licence that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction. The [[Cornwall Air Ambulance]] is based at the airport. Since 2012, the airport has hosted the '''Aerohub''' [[enterprise zone]].\n\nThe runway is able to take the largest and fastest of civil and military aircraft, having been built and maintained for decades as an RAF maritime operations base. The US Navy were present with the USN AWD storage facility and Joint Maritime Facility. With the end of the [[Cold War]] and changes in American political priorities, the Americans pulled out of all involvement with the base by the end of 2009. The last RAF flying squadron based at St Mawgan was [[No. 203 Squadron RAF|203(R) Squadron]] which moved out in 2008, but the RAF continues to use part of the site.\n\n==History==\n\n===Military use===\nThe airfield was opened in 1933 as a civilian facility, but was requisitioned at the outbreak of [[World War II]] and named RAF Trebelzue to support other bases in the Cornwall area. The base was renamed RAF St Mawgan 1943, after expansion. The facility was then handed to the USAAF and a number of improvements took place, including the building of a new [[control tower]] and expansion of the current runway. The airfield was put under maintenance in 1947, and reopened as a [[RAF Coastal Command|Coastal Command]] base in 1951.\n\nSince 1951, aircraft squadron which have operated at the station have included 7 Sqn., [[No. 22 Squadron RAF|22 Sqn.]], [[No. 203 Squadron RAF|203 Sqn.]] (Sea King OCU, 1996-2008); 220 Sqn (later renamed 201); 228 Sqn. (later renamed 206), both Long Range Reconnaissance Squadrons; [[No. 42 Squadron RAF]] ([[BAe Nimrod]]) (disbanded 1992), [[No. 236 Operational Conversion Unit RAF]], the Nimrod front-line conversion-to-type unit (1970-1992). In addition, [[Royal Air Force Regiment]] squadrons [[No. 1 Squadron RAF Regiment]] and 2625 Sqn ([[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]]) were present. 2625 Sqn was disbanded on 1 November 2006, whilst 1 Sqn RAF Regt relocated to [[RAF Honington]]. The others relocated or closed. In 2005, RAF St Mawgan was one of the bases shortlisted to house the new [[Joint Combat Aircraft]] (JCA) in 2013, but in November 2005, it was announced by [[Minister of State for the Armed Forces]] [[Adam Ingram (Labour politician)|Adam Ingram]] that the operation would be based from Scotland. Helicopter maintenance (HMF) also ceased here in late 2006.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nFlying operations at RAF St Mawgan (on the opposite side of the runway to the civil terminal) ceased in December 2008.\n\n===Transition to fully civilian airport===\n[[File:Nqyramp.JPG|thumb|Looking over the ramp at some of the airlines that serve NQY in Summer 2007]]\nIn 2006 the airport introduced a \u00a35 per passenger airport development fee, payable by all departing passengers via an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] type machine prior to passing security.<ref>[http://www.newquaycornwallairport.com/index.cfm?articleid=40523] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220054448/http://www.newquaycornwallairport.com/index.cfm?articleid=40523 |date=20 December 2008}}</ref> This resulted in [[Monarch Airlines]] axing its route from the airport (to [[M\u00e1laga Airport|M\u00e1laga]]) and in [[Ryanair]] reducing the number of flights, though this was later restored. In 2015, it was announced that the \u00a35 development fee would be scrapped in March 2016.\n\nIn 2008, the airport closed from 1 to 19 December, to allow time for the takeover of the airfield navigation services (i.e. [[Air traffic control|Air Traffic Control]]) from [[RAF St Mawgan]] and to fully meet CAA standards. Following further inspections by the CAA, flights recommenced on 20 December 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/defence-notes/newquay-cornwall-airport-reopens-to-comm/ |title=Newquay Cornwall Airport reopens to commercial flights under new civilian licence - DN - Defence Notes - Shephard Media |website=www.shephardmedia.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111165115/https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/defence-notes/newquay-cornwall-airport-reopens-to-comm/ |archive-date=11 January 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nBy virtue of a Statutory Instrument issued on 22 September 2009, Newquay Airport is subject to current airport bylaws, per Section 63 of the Airports Act 1986.<ref>The Airports Byelaws (Designation) Order SI 2576/2009</ref>\n\nAn extension opened in 2006 increased the [[Airport terminal|terminal]]'s size by 20%, allowing the airport to handle up to 450,000 passengers a year. In January 2008, [[Cornwall County Council]] approved plans for an expanded arrivals hall and departure lounge; a new retail outlet; a business lounge; and new airfield structures. In May 2008, the new arrivals and [[Baggage claim|baggage reclaim]] area was opened; unlike the old arrivals hall, this allowed domestic and international flights to be processed simultaneously. It also added a [[Gate (airport)|gate]] to the departures lounge.\n\nThe expansion of the airport was criticised in 2007 by a number of [[Environmental movement|environmental groups]]. This opposition was based not only on environmental concerns (given that the majority of flights are [[Flight length|short-haul]] and to destinations that could be served by rail), but also [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] concerns that airport expansion would lead to a greater demand for second homes in Cornwall, adding to already inflated local house prices.<ref>Groundswellcornwall.org, [http://www.groundswellcornwall.org/files/u1/y_Airport_The_Case_Examined_revised_Oct_2007.pdf Newquay Airport The Case Examined] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121210758/http://www.groundswellcornwall.org/files/u1/y_Airport_The_Case_Examined_revised_Oct_2007.pdf |date=21 November 2008 }}, revised October 2007.

Its runway was operated by [[RAF St Mawgan]] before 2008, and is now owned by [[Cornwall Council]].\n\nThe airport handled 461,300 passengers in 2017, a 24.2% increase over the previous year.<ref name=\"stats\"/> Newquay has a [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|CAA]] Public Use Aerodrome Licence that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction. The [[Cornwall Air Ambulance]] is based at the airport. Since 2012, the airport has hosted the '''Aerohub''' [[enterprise zone]].\n\nThe runway is able to take the largest and fastest of civil and military aircraft, having been built and maintained for decades as an RAF maritime operations base. The US Navy were present with the USN AWD storage facility and Joint Maritime Facility. With the end of the [[Cold War]] and changes in American political priorities, the Americans pulled out of all involvement with the base by the end of 2009. The last RAF flying squadron based at St Mawgan was [[No. 203 Squadron RAF|203(R) Squadron]] which moved out in 2008, but the RAF continues to use part of the site.\n\n==History==\n\n===Military use===\nThe airfield was opened in 1933 as a civilian facility, but was requisitioned at the outbreak of [[World War II]] and named RAF Trebelzue to support other bases in the Cornwall area. The base was renamed RAF St Mawgan 1943, after expansion. The facility was then handed to the USAAF and a number of improvements took place, including the building of a new [[control tower]] and expansion of the current runway. The airfield was put under maintenance in 1947, and reopened as a [[RAF Coastal Command|Coastal Command]] base in 1951.\n\nSince 1951, aircraft squadron which have operated at the station have included 7 Sqn., [[No. 22 Squadron RAF|22 Sqn.]], [[No. 203 Squadron RAF|203 Sqn.]] (Sea King OCU, 1996-2008); 220 Sqn (later renamed 201); 228 Sqn. (later renamed 206), both Long Range Reconnaissance Squadrons; [[No. 42 Squadron RAF]] ([[BAe Nimrod]]) (disbanded 1992), [[No. 236 Operational Conversion Unit RAF]], the Nimrod front-line conversion-to-type unit (1970-1992). In addition, [[Royal Air Force Regiment]] squadrons [[No. 1 Squadron RAF Regiment]] and 2625 Sqn ([[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]]) were present. 2625 Sqn was disbanded on 1 November 2006, whilst 1 Sqn RAF Regt relocated to [[RAF Honington]]. The others relocated or closed. In 2005, RAF St Mawgan was one of the bases shortlisted to house the new [[Joint Combat Aircraft]] (JCA) in 2013, but in November 2005, it was announced by [[Minister of State for the Armed Forces]] [[Adam Ingram (Labour politician)|Adam Ingram]] that the operation would be based from Scotland. Helicopter maintenance (HMF) also ceased here in late 2006.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nFlying operations at RAF St Mawgan (on the opposite side of the runway to the civil terminal) ceased in December 2008.\n\n===Transition to fully civilian airport===\n[[File:Nqyramp.JPG|thumb|Looking over the ramp at some of the airlines that serve NQY in Summer 2007]]\nIn 2006 the airport introduced a \u00a35 per passenger airport development fee, payable by all departing passengers via an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] type machine prior to passing security.<ref>[http://www.newquaycornwallairport.com/index.cfm?articleid=40523] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220054448/http://www.newquaycornwallairport.com/index.cfm?articleid=40523 |date=20 December 2008}}</ref> This resulted in [[Monarch Airlines]] axing its route from the airport (to [[M\u00e1laga Airport|M\u00e1laga]]) and in [[Ryanair]] reducing the number of flights, though this was later restored. In 2015, it was announced that the \u00a35 development fee would be scrapped in March 2016.\n\nIn 2008, the airport closed from 1 to 19 December, to allow time for the takeover of the airfield navigation services (i.e. [[Air traffic control|Air Traffic Control]]) from [[RAF St Mawgan]] and to fully meet CAA standards. Following further inspections by the CAA, flights recommenced on 20 December 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/defence-notes/newquay-cornwall-airport-reopens-to-comm/ |title=Newquay Cornwall Airport reopens to commercial flights under new civilian licence - DN - Defence Notes - Shephard Media |website=www.shephardmedia.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111165115/https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/defence-notes/newquay-cornwall-airport-reopens-to-comm/ |archive-date=11 January 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nBy virtue of a Statutory Instrument issued on 22 September 2009, Newquay Airport is subject to current airport bylaws, per Section 63 of the Airports Act 1986.<ref>The Airports Byelaws (Designation) Order SI 2576/2009</ref>\n\nAn extension opened in 2006 increased the [[Airport terminal|terminal]]'s size by 20%, allowing the airport to handle up to 450,000 passengers a year. In January 2008, [[Cornwall County Council]] approved plans for an expanded arrivals hall and departure lounge; a new retail outlet; a business lounge; and new airfield structures. In May 2008, the new arrivals and [[Baggage claim|baggage reclaim]] area was opened; unlike the old arrivals hall, this allowed domestic and international flights to be processed simultaneously. It also added a [[Gate (airport)|gate]] to the departures lounge.\n\nThe expansion of the airport was criticised in 2007 by a number of [[Environmental movement|environmental groups]]. This opposition was based not only on environmental concerns (given that the majority of flights are [[Flight length|short-haul]] and to destinations that could be served by rail), but also [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] concerns that airport expansion would lead to a greater demand for second homes in Cornwall, adding to already inflated local house prices.<ref>Groundswellcornwall.org, [http://www.groundswellcornwall.org/files/u1/y_Airport_The_Case_Examined_revised_Oct_2007.pdf Newquay Airport The Case Examined] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121210758/http://www.groundswellcornwall.org/files/u1/y_Airport_The_Case_Examined_revised_Oct_2007.pdf |date=21 November 2008 }}, revised October 2007.

Created by the renowned designer [[Kenneth Grange]] based on a detailed brief,<ref> See Malcolm Toak, ''Pen to Paper, The Story of Newhaven's Pen Factory'', New Anzac Publications, 2005</ref> it was manufactured in [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]], England and produced in a variety of different versions until 1999.<ref>See Parker Pens website, by Swedish pen historian Tony Fischier http://parkerpens.net/parker25.html</ref> An eye-catching, contemporary-looking pen, with mainly steel components, the Parker 25 was intended to revive the company's fortunes. As ''The Guardian'' wrote, '(Grange's) classic Parker pen had the machined lustre of a bullet. In fact, its tapering barrel was inspired by an American space rocket, a form that enabled the lid to be the same diameter as the pen no matter which end it was attached to.'<ref>Justin McQuirk, 'Kenneth Grange, a very British modernist', ''The Guardian'', 19 July 2011, https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jul/19/kenneth-grange-british-modernist</ref> It was affordable enough to become a staple entry-level pen for both work and leisure uses - and for secondary school students at a time when fountain pens were still obligatory in many British schools. Advertising slogans used to market Parker 25s included 'Modern as Tomorrow', 'Space Age Design, Space Age Performance', 'European Styled' and 'Contemporary, Highly Functional Design'.<ref>See examples at More Engineering website created by former Parker engineer, http://www.moreengineering.co.uk/publications-and-prices/4584108238</ref>\n\nParker 25s were issued in several variants: initially, fountain pen, ballpoint, fibre point and mechanical pencil.<ref>http://www.moreengineering.co.uk/models/458277434</ref> A rollerball model was introduced in 1981, and fibre tips were phased out a couple of years later. While the great majority of Parker 25s were 'flighters', with a brushed steel finish, matte black and later white versions were issued between 1978 and 1987. The pens had four different trim colours - blue (the most common), black, green, and most rarely of all, orange. Orange trim Parker 25s were discontinued in 1976 following a copyright dispute with [[Rotring]], and surviving examples are very sought after. A striking feature of all Parker 25s is the square plastic tassie logo on the clip.\n\nThe earliest Mark I Parker 25 fountain pens dating from the first year of production feature a distinctive breather hole in the nib. While the original models had a flat plastic circle on top of the cap, Mark III and IV pens have a round ridge on this inner cap. Pens manufactured from 1980 feature letter date codes which were changed every quarter. Those manufactured from 1990 are stamped 'Made in UK'; earlier pens were inscribed 'Made in England'. Pens without any manufacture stamps, or inscribed 'Made in Aust', are very rare. Parker 25s were all assembled in Britain by hand<ref>http://www.moreengineering.co.uk/introduction/4582901246</ref> - unlike Jotters, Vectors and other mass market pens - and were very minimalist, comprising between 9 and 11 components.\n\nThe 25 was an extremely successful pen for Parker commercially, especially during its first decade or so of production.<ref>https://parkerpens.net/parker25.html</ref> A number of promotional versions were made up to order, featuring company logos on the barrel (the matte black and white versions were often branded in this way), clip or cap.\n\nSome pen aficionados are rather disparaging about the Parker 25, which lacks the status of the legendary [[Parker Duofold]]<ref>See David Shepherd and Dan Zazove, ''Parker Duofold'', Surrenden Pens Ltd, 2006.</ref> or the storied [[Parker 51]]. <ref>See David Shepherd and Mark Shepherd, ''Parker \"51\"'', Surrenden Pens Ltd, 2004.</ref> But in recent years they have been enjoying a revival, their space age look evoking nostalgia for the final quarter of the twentieth century. The Parker 25 was even given the accolade of an exhibition stand at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].<ref>Kenneth Grange at the Boilerhouse, Parker 25, ''Design Council Slide Collection'', Victoria and Albert Museum, https://vads.ac.uk/large.php?uid=53760&sos=0</ref>.\n\n\n===Parker Vector===\nThe precursor to the Parker Vector was introduced in 1981.  It was a simple cylindrical plastic cap and barrel [[roller-ball pen]] called the \"Parker RB1\".<ref>Note: The RB1 name stands for \"Rollerball 1\".</ref>  In 1984, Parker added the FP1 (\"Fountain Pen 1\"), with essentially the same design.  The RB1 and FP1 models were produced until 1986, at which time Parker revised the pen by lengthening the cap and shortening the barrel and renaming the new pen the \"Vector Standard\".  Presently, there are four models available (in plastic and steel): the fountain pen, capped rollerball, pushbutton ballpoint, and pushbutton pencil.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703493504576007640835661876 ''When Parker Pens Ruled''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812073307/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703493504576007640835661876 |date=12 August 2017 }}; Tuesday, December 7, 2010; article; [[The Wall Street Journal]]; comment: about the relaunch of Parker Pens held at the Museum of Arts and Design on Columbus Circle.

Parker 25s were all assembled in Britain by hand<ref>http://www.moreengineering.co.uk/introduction/4582901246</ref> - unlike Jotters, Vectors and other mass market pens - and were very minimalist, comprising between 9 and 11 components.\n\nThe 25 was an extremely successful pen for Parker commercially, especially during its first decade or so of production.<ref>https://parkerpens.net/parker25.html</ref> A number of promotional versions were made up to order, featuring company logos on the barrel (the matte black and white versions were often branded in this way), clip or cap.\n\nSome pen aficionados are rather disparaging about the Parker 25, which lacks the status of the legendary [[Parker Duofold]]<ref>See David Shepherd and Dan Zazove, ''Parker Duofold'', Surrenden Pens Ltd, 2006.</ref> or the storied [[Parker 51]]. <ref>See David Shepherd and Mark Shepherd, ''Parker \"51\"'', Surrenden Pens Ltd, 2004.</ref> But in recent years they have been enjoying a revival, their space age look evoking nostalgia for the final quarter of the twentieth century. The Parker 25 was even given the accolade of an exhibition stand at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].<ref>Kenneth Grange at the Boilerhouse, Parker 25, ''Design Council Slide Collection'', Victoria and Albert Museum, https://vads.ac.uk/large.php?uid=53760&sos=0</ref>.\n\n\n===Parker Vector===\nThe precursor to the Parker Vector was introduced in 1981.  It was a simple cylindrical plastic cap and barrel [[roller-ball pen]] called the \"Parker RB1\".<ref>Note: The RB1 name stands for \"Rollerball 1\".</ref>  In 1984, Parker added the FP1 (\"Fountain Pen 1\"), with essentially the same design.  The RB1 and FP1 models were produced until 1986, at which time Parker revised the pen by lengthening the cap and shortening the barrel and renaming the new pen the \"Vector Standard\".  Presently, there are four models available (in plastic and steel): the fountain pen, capped rollerball, pushbutton ballpoint, and pushbutton pencil.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703493504576007640835661876 ''When Parker Pens Ruled''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812073307/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703493504576007640835661876 |date=12 August 2017 }}; Tuesday, December 7, 2010; article; [[The Wall Street Journal]]; comment: about the relaunch of Parker Pens held at the Museum of Arts and Design on Columbus Circle.

It was among the most powerful states in Europe and a [[great power]] since the [[Late Middle Ages]]. It was also an early [[French colonial empire|colonial power]], with possessions around the world.\n\nFrance originated as [[West Francia]] (''Francia Occidentalis''), the western half of the [[Carolingian Empire]], with the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843). A branch of the Carolingian dynasty continued to rule until 987, when [[Hugh Capet]] was elected king and founded the [[Capetian dynasty]]. The territory remained known as ''Francia'' and its ruler as ''rex Francorum'' (\"king of the Franks\") well into the [[High Middle Ages]]. The first king calling himself ''Roi de France'' (\"King of France\") was [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], in 1190. France continued to be ruled by the Capetians and their cadet lines\u2014the [[House of Valois|Valois]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]]\u2014until the monarchy was abolished in 1792 during the [[French Revolution]].\n\n[[France in the Middle Ages]] was a de-centralised, [[Feudalism|feudal]] monarchy. In [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]] and [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]] (now a part of Spain) the authority of the French king was barely felt. [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] and [[Kingdom of Arles|Provence]] were states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and not yet a part of France. Initially, West Frankish kings were elected by the secular and ecclesiastic magnates, but the regular coronation of the eldest son of the reigning king during his father's lifetime established the principle of male primogeniture, which became codified in the [[Salic law]]. During the [[Late Middle Ages]], the [[Kings of England]] laid claim to the French throne, resulting in a series of conflicts known as the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337\u20131453). Emerging victorious from said conflicts, France subsequently sought to extend its influence into Italy, but was defeated by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in the ensuing [[Italian Wars]] (1494\u20131559).\n\n[[Early modern France|France in the early modern era]] was increasingly centralised; the [[French language]] began to displace other languages from official use, and the monarch expanded his [[Absolute monarchy|absolute power]], albeit in an administrative system (the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'') complicated by historic and regional irregularities in taxation, legal, judicial, and ecclesiastic divisions, and local prerogatives. Religiously France became divided between the Catholic majority and a Protestant minority, the [[Huguenots]], which led to a series of civil wars, the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] (1562\u20131598). The Wars of Religion crippled France but triumph over [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in the Thirty Years' War made France the most powerful nation on the continent once more as the kingdom became Europe's dominant cultural, political, and military power in the 17th century under the [[Louis XIV|Sun King]].<ref>{{cite book |author=R.R.

Wars with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] led to the loss of much of its [[New France|North American holdings]] by 1763. [[France in the American Revolutionary War|French intervention in the American Revolutionary War]] helped secure the independence of  the new United States of America but was costly and achieved little for France.\n\nThe Kingdom of France [[Kingdom of France (1791\u201392)|adopted a written constitution]] in 1791, but the Kingdom was abolished a year later and replaced with the [[First French Republic]]. The [[Bourbon Restoration|monarchy was restored]] by the other great powers in 1814 and lasted (except for the [[Hundred Days]] in 1815) until the [[French Revolution of 1848]].\n\n==Political history==\n===West Francia===\n{{Main article|West Francia}}\n{{Further information|Carolingian Empire}}\n\nDuring the later years of the elderly [[Charlemagne]]'s rule, the [[Viking]]s made advances along the northern and western perimeters of the [[Kingdom of the Franks]]. After Charlemagne's death in 814 his heirs were incapable of maintaining political unity and the empire began to crumble. The [[Treaty of Verdun]] of 843 divided the Carolingian Empire into three parts, with  [[Charles the Bald]] ruling over [[West Francia]], the nucleus of what would develop into the kingdom of France.<ref>{{cite book |author=Roger Price|title=A Concise History of France |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AYjB2-RnWUwC&pg=PA30 |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=30 |isbn = 9780521844802 }}</ref>\nCharles the Bald was also crowned [[kingdom of Lotharingia|King of Lotharingia]] after the death of [[Lothair II]] in 869, but in the  [[Treaty of Meerssen]] (870) was forced to cede much of Lotharingia to his brothers, retaining the [[Rhone]] and [[Meuse]] basins (including [[Verdun]], [[Vienne]] and [[Besan\u00e7on]]) but leaving the [[Rhineland]] with [[Aachen]], [[Metz]] and [[Trier]] in [[East Francia]].\n\nViking advances were allowed to increase, and their dreaded [[longship]]s were sailing up the [[Loire]] and [[Seine]] rivers and other inland waterways, wreaking havoc and spreading terror. During the reign of [[Charles the Simple]] (898\u2013922), Normans under [[Rollo]] from [[Norway]], were settled in an area on either side of the River Seine, downstream from Paris, that was to become [[Normandy]].<ref>Jim Bradbury.

With its offshoots, the houses of [[House of Valois|Valois]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]], it was to rule France for more than 800 years.<ref>{{cite book|author=William W.

After defeating a [[Revolt of 1173\u20131174|revolt]] led by Eleanor and three of their four sons, Henry had Eleanor imprisoned, made the [[List of rulers of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] his vassal, and in effect ruled the western half of France as a greater power than the French throne. However, disputes among Henry's descendants over the division of his French territories, coupled with [[John of England]]'s lengthy quarrel with Philip II, allowed [[Philip II of France|Philip II]] to recover influence over most of this territory. After the French victory at the [[Battle of Bouvines]] in 1214, the English monarchs maintained power only in southwestern Duchy of [[Guyenne]].<ref>Peter Shervey Lewis, ''Later medieval France: the polity'' (1968).</ref>\n\n===Late Middle Ages and the Hundred Years' War===\n{{Main article|France in the Middle Ages|Hundred Years' War}}\n\nThe death of [[Charles IV of France]] in 1328 without male heirs ended the main Capetian line. Under [[Salic law]] the crown could not pass through a woman (Philip IV's daughter was Isabella, whose son was [[Edward III of England]]), so the throne passed to [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]], son of [[Charles of Valois]]. This, in addition to a long-standing dispute over the rights to Gascony in the south of France, and the relationship between England and the Flemish cloth towns, led to the [[Hundred Years' War]] of 1337\u20131453. The following century was to see devastating warfare, peasant revolts (the [[English peasants' revolt of 1381]] and the ''[[Jacquerie]]'' of 1358 in France) and the growth of nationalism in both countries.<ref>Alice Minerva Atkinson, ''A Brief History of the Hundred Years' War'' (2012)</ref>\n\nThe losses of the century of war were enormous, particularly owing to the plague (the [[Black Death]], usually considered an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]]), which arrived from Italy in 1348, spreading rapidly up the Rhone valley and thence across most of the country: it is estimated that a population of some 18\u201320 million in modern-day France at the time of the 1328 [[hearth tax]] returns had been reduced 150 years later by 50 percent or more.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joseph P.

Articles 110 and 111, the most famous, called for the use of the [[French language]] in all legal acts, notarised contracts and official legislation.\n\n====Italian Wars====\n{{Main article|Italian Wars}}\nAfter the Hundred Years' War, [[Charles VIII of France]] signed three additional treaties with [[Henry VII of England]], [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I of Habsburg]], and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] respectively at [[Peace of Etaples|\u00c9taples]] (1492), [[Treaty of Senlis|Senlis]] (1493) and in [[Treaty of Barcelona|Barcelona]] (1493). These three treaties cleared the way for France to undertake the long [[Italian Wars]] (1494\u20131559), which marked the beginning of early modern France. French efforts to gain dominance resulted only in the increased power of the [[Habsburg]] house.\n\n====Wars of Religion====\n{{Main article|French Wars of Religion}}\n\nBarely were the Italian Wars over, when France was plunged into a domestic crisis with far-reaching consequences. Despite the conclusion of [[Concordat of Bologna|a Concordat]] between France and the Papacy (1516), granting the crown unrivalled power in senior ecclesiastical appointments, France was deeply affected by the [[Protestant Reformation]]'s attempt to break the hegemony of Catholic Europe. A growing urban-based Protestant minority (later dubbed ''[[Huguenots]]'') faced ever harsher repression under the rule of Francis I's son [[Henry II of France|King Henry II]]. After Henry II's death in a joust, the country was ruled by his widow [[Catherine de' Medici]] and her sons [[Francis II of France|Francis II]], [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] and [[Henry III of France|Henry III]]. Renewed Catholic reaction headed by the powerful dukes of [[Guise]] culminated in a massacre of Huguenots (1562), starting the first of the [[French Wars of Religion]], during which English, German, and Spanish forces intervened on the side of rival Protestant and Catholic forces. Opposed to absolute monarchy, the Huguenot [[Monarchomachs]] theorized during this time the [[right of rebellion]] and the legitimacy of [[tyrannicide]].<ref>Mack P. Holt, ''The French wars of religion, 1562\u20131629'' (2005).</ref>\n\nThe Wars of Religion culminated in the [[War of the Three Henrys (1584-1598)|War of the Three Henrys]] in which [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] assassinated [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Henry de Guise]], leader of the Spanish-backed [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic league]], and the king was murdered in return. After the assassination of both Henry of Guise (1588) and Henry III (1589), the conflict was ended by the accession of the Protestant king of [[Navarre]] as [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (first king of the [[Bourbon dynasty]]) and his subsequent abandonment of Protestantism (Expedient of 1592) effective in 1593, his acceptance by most of the Catholic establishment (1594) and by the Pope (1595), and his issue of the toleration decree known as the [[Edict of Nantes]] (1598), which guaranteed freedom of private worship and civil equality.<ref>David Buisseret, ''Henry IV, King of France'' (1990).</ref>\n\n===Early Modern period===\n{{Main article|Early modern France}}\n{{Multiple image\n| total_width = 300\n| image1 = Henry IV of france by pourbous younger.jpg\n| image2 = Louis XIIIval grace.jpg\n| footer = [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (left), by [[Frans Pourbus the younger]] (1610), [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] (right), by [[Philippe de Champaigne]] (1647)\n| align = right\n| direction = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\n====Colonial France====\n{{Main article|New France}}\nFrance's pacification under [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] laid much of the ground for the beginnings of France's rise to European hegemony. France was expansive during all but the end of the seventeenth century: the French began trading in [[India]] and [[Madagascar]], founded [[Quebec City|Quebec]] and penetrated the North American [[Great Lakes]] and [[Mississippi]], established plantation economies in the [[West Indies]] and extended their trade contacts in the [[Levant]] and enlarged their [[merchant marine]].\n\n====Thirty Years' War====\nHenry IV's son [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] and his minister (1624\u20131642) [[Cardinal Richelieu]], elaborated a policy against Spain and the Holy Roman Empire during the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348) which had broken out in Germany. After the death of both king and cardinal, the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) secured universal acceptance of Germany's political and religious fragmentation, but the Regency of [[Anne of Austria]] and her minister [[Cardinal Mazarin]] experienced a civil uprising known as the [[Fronde]] (1648\u20131653) which expanded into a [[Fronde|Franco-Spanish War]] (1653\u201359). The [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] (1659) formalised France's seizure (1642) of the Spanish territory of [[Roussillon]] after the crushing of the ephemeral [[Catalan Republic (1641)|Catalan Republic]] and ushered a short period of peace.<ref>Peter H. Wilson, ''Europe's Tragedy: A History of the Thirty Years' War'' (2009).</ref>\n\n====Administrative structures====\n{{Main article|Ancien R\u00e9gime}}\n\nThe ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', a French term rendered in English as \"Old Rule\", or simply \"Former Regime\", refers primarily to the aristocratic, social and political system of early modern France under the [[Valois dynasty|late Valois]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] dynasties.  The administrative and social structures of the Ancien R\u00e9gime were the result of years of state-building, legislative acts (like the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats]]), internal conflicts and civil wars, but they remained a confusing patchwork of local [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] and historic differences until the [[French Revolution]] brought about a radical suppression of administrative incoherence.\n\n====Louis XIV, the Sun King====\n{{Main article|Louis XIV of France}}\n\n[[File:Louis XIV of France.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], by [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]], 1701]]\n\nFor most of the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] (1643\u20131715), (\"The Sun King\"), France was the dominant power in Europe, aided by the diplomacy of Cardinal Richelieu's successor as the King's chief minister, (1642\u201361) [[Cardinal Jules Mazarin]], (1602\u201361). Cardinal Mazarin oversaw the creation of a French Royal Navy that rivalled [[Royal Navy|England's]], expanding it from 25 ships to almost 200. The size of the Army was also considerably increased. Renewed wars (the [[War of Devolution]], 1667\u201368 and the [[Franco-Dutch War]], 1672\u201378) brought further territorial gains ([[Artois]] and western [[Flanders]] and the free [[county of Burgundy]], previously left to the Empire in 1482), but at the cost of the increasingly concerted opposition of rival royal powers, and a legacy of an increasingly enormous national debt. An adherent of the theory of the [[divine right of kings|\"Divine Right of Kings\"]], which advocates the divine origin of temporal power and any lack of earthly restraint of monarchical rule, Louis XIV continued his predecessors' work of creating a [[Centralized government|centralized state]] governed from the capital of Paris. He sought to eliminate the remnants of [[feudalism]] still persisting in parts of France and, by compelling the noble elite to regularly inhabit his lavish [[Palace of Versailles]], built on the outskirts of Paris, succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy, many members of which had participated in the earlier \"[[Fronde]]\" rebellion during Louis' minority youth. By these means he consolidated a system of absolute monarchy in France that endured 150 years until the [[French Revolution]].<ref>William Beik, ''Louis XIV and Absolutism: A Brief Study with Documents'' (2000)</ref>  McCabe says critics used fiction to portray the degraded Turkish Court, using \"the harem, the Sultan court, oriental despotism, luxury, gems and spices, carpets, and silk cushions\" as an unfavorable analogy to the corruption of the French royal court.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ina Baghdiantz McCabe|title=Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade, Exoticism, and the Ancien R\u00e9gime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3MmvAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA134|year=2008|publisher=Berg|page=134|isbn=9781847884633}}</ref>\n\nThe king sought to impose total religious uniformity on the country, repealing the \"[[Edict of Nantes]]\" in 1685. The infamous practice of \"[[dragonnades]]\" was adopted, whereby intentionally rough soldiers were quartered in the homes of Protestant families and allowed to have their way with them \u2014 stealing, raping, torturing and killing adults and infants in their hovels. It is estimated that anywhere between 150,000 and 300,000 Protestants fled France during the wave of persecution that followed the repeal,<ref>[https://www.letemps.ch/monde/rome-protestante-face-aux-exiles-foi La Rome protestante face aux exil\u00e9s de la foi]</ref><ref>[http://books.openedition.org/pur/5650  Le Refuge protestant urbain au temps de la r\u00e9vocation de l\u2019\u00c9dit de Nantes]</ref> (following \"[[Huguenots]]\" beginning a hundred and fifty years earlier until the end of the 18th century) costing the country a great many intellectuals, artisans, and other valuable people. Persecution extended to unorthodox Roman Catholics like the [[Jansenists]], a group that denied free will and had already been condemned by the popes. Louis was no theologian and understood little of the complex doctrines of Jansenism, satisfying himself with the fact that they threatened the unity of the state. In this, he garnered the friendship of the papacy, which had previously been hostile to France because of its policy of putting all church property in the country under the jurisdiction of the state rather than that of Rome.<ref>John B. Wolf, ''Louis XIV'' (1974)</ref>\n\nIn November 1700, the Spanish king [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] died, ending the Habsburg line in that country. Louis had long waited for this moment, and now planned to put a Bourbon relative, [[Philip, Duke of Anjou]], (1683\u20131746), on the throne. Essentially, [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]] was to become a perpetual ally and even obedient satellite of France, ruled by a king who would carry out orders from Versailles. Realizing how this would upset the balance of power, the other European rulers were outraged. However, most of the alternatives were equally undesirable. For example, putting another Habsburg on the throne would end up recreating the grand multi-national empire of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (1500\u201358), of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (German First Reich), [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]], and the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Two Sicilies]] which would also grossly upset the power balance. After nine years of exhausting war, the last thing Louis wanted was another conflict. However, the rest of Europe would not stand for his ambitions in Spain, and so the long [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began (1701\u201314), a mere three years after the [[War of the Grand Alliance]], (1688\u201397, aka \"War of the League of Augsburg\") had just concluded.<ref>Daniel Roche, France in the Enlightenment (1998)</ref>\n\n====Dissent and revolution====\n{{main article|French Revolution}}\n[[File:France anciennes provinces 1789.jpg|upright=1.15|left|thumb|Provinces in 1789]]\n\nThe reign (1715\u201374) of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] saw an initial return to peace and prosperity under the regency (1715\u201323) of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], whose policies were largely continued (1726\u20131743) by [[Cardinal Fleury]], prime minister in all but name. The exhaustion of Europe after two major wars resulted in a long period of peace, only interrupted by minor conflicts like the [[War of the Polish Succession]] from 1733\u201335. Large-scale warfare resumed with the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740\u201348). But alliance with the traditional Habsburg enemy (the \"[[Diplomatic Revolution]]\" of 1756) against the rising power of Britain and [[Prussia]] led to costly failure in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u201363) and the loss of France's North American colonies.<ref>Colin Jones, ''The Great Nation: France from Louis XV to Napoleon'' (2003)</ref>\n{{Multiple image\n|total_width=300\n|image1=Louis XV by Maurice-Quentin de La Tour.jpg\n|image2=Antoine-Fran\u00e7ois Callet - Louis XVI, roi de France et de Navarre (1754-1793), rev\u00eatu du grand costume royal en 1779 - Google Art Project.jpg\n|footer=[[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] (left), by [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] (1748); [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] (right), by [[Antoine-Fran\u00e7ois Callet]] (1775)\n}}\nOn the whole, the 18th century saw growing discontent with the monarchy and the established order. Louis XV was a highly unpopular king for his sexual excesses, overall weakness, and for losing Canada to the British. A strong ruler like Louis XIV could enhance the position of the monarchy, while Louis XV weakened it. The writings of the [[philosophes]] such as [[Voltaire]] were a clear sign of discontent, but the king chose to ignore them. He died of [[smallpox]] in 1774, and the French people shed few tears at his passing. While France had not yet experienced the [[Industrial Revolution]] that was beginning in Britain, the rising middle class of the cities felt increasingly frustrated with a system and rulers that seemed silly, frivolous, aloof, and antiquated, even if true feudalism no longer existed in France.\n\nUpon Louis XV's death, his grandson [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] became king. Initially popular, he too came to be widely detested by the 1780s. He was married to an Austrian archduchess, [[Marie Antoinette]]. French intervention in the American War of Independence was also very expensive.<ref>William Doyle, ''The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction'' (2001)</ref>\n\nWith the country deeply in debt, Louis XVI permitted the radical reforms of [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] and [[Guillaume-Chr\u00e9tien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Malesherbes]], but noble disaffection led to Turgot's dismissal and Malesherbes' resignation in 1776. They were replaced by [[Jacques Necker]]. Necker had resigned in 1781 to be replaced by [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne|Calonne]] and [[\u00c9tienne Charles de Lom\u00e9nie de Brienne|Brienne]], before being restored in 1788. A harsh winter that year led to widespread food shortages, and by then France was a powder keg ready to explode.<ref>Sylvia Neely, ''A Concise History of the French Revolution '' (2008)</ref>\nOn the eve of the [[French Revolution]] of July 1789, France was in a profound institutional and financial crisis, but the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] had begun to permeate the educated classes of society.<ref>Daniel Roche, ''France in the Enlightenment'' (1998)</ref>\n\n=== Limited monarchy ===\nOn September 3, 1791, the absolute monarchy which had governed France for 948 years was forced to limit its power and become a provisional constitutional monarchy. However, this too would not last very long and on September 21, 1792 the French monarchy was effectively abolished by the proclamation of the [[French First Republic]]. The role of the King in France was finally ended with the execution of [[Louis XVI]] by [[guillotine]] on Monday, January 21, 1793, followed by the \"[[Reign of Terror]]\", mass executions and the provisional \"[[French Directory|Directory]]\" form of [[French First Republic|republican government]], and the eventual beginnings of twenty-five years of reform, upheaval, dictatorship, wars and renewal, with the various [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\n===Restoration===\n{{Main article|Bourbon Restoration}}\n{{Multiple image\n|total_width=300\n|image1=G\u00e9rard - Louis XVIII of France in Coronation Robes.jpg\n|image2=Carlos X de Francia (Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard).jpg\n|footer=The two kings of the Restoration: [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] (left) by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]] (1820s), [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] (right) by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]] (1825)\n}}\n\nThe monarchy was briefly restored following the successive events of the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u201399), and the [[First French Empire|First French Empire under Napoleon]] (1804\u20131814/15)&nbsp;\u2013 when a [[War of the Sixth Coalition|coalition of European powers]] restored by arms the monarchy to the heirs of the [[House of Bourbon]] in 1814. However the deposed Emperor [[Napoleon I]] returned triumphantly to Paris from his exile in [[Elba]] and ruled France for a short period known as the [[Hundred Days]].\n\nWhen a [[War of the Seventh Coalition|Seventh European Coalition]] deposed Napoleon after the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815, the Bourbon monarchy was once again restored. \nThe [[Count of Provence]], brother of Louis XVI, who was guillotined in 1793, was crowned as [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], nicknamed \"The Desired\". Louis XVIII tried to conciliate the legacies of the Revolution and Ancien R\u00e9gime both, also permitting the formation of a [[French Parliament|Parliament]] and [[Charter of 1814|constitutional Charter]], usually \"''Charte octroy\u00e9e''\" (\"Granted Charter\"). His reign was characterized by disagreements between the [[Doctrinaires]], liberal thinkers who supported the Charter and rising [[bourgeoisie]], and the [[Ultra-royalist]]s, aristocrats and clergymen who totally refused the Revolution's heritage. However, peace was maintained by statesmen like [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]] and the [[Armand-Emmanuel de Vignerot du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu|Duke of Richelieu]], as well as the King's moderation and prudent intervention.<ref>Actes du congr\u00e8s \u2013 vol. 3, 1961, p.&nbsp;441.</ref><ref>Emmanuel de Waresquiel, 2003, pp.&nbsp;460\u2013461.</ref> In 1823, the liberal agitations in Spain led to a [[Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis|French intervention]] on the royalist's side, who permitted to King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] to reject the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Constitution]]. {{clarify|it's not clear if someone has been messing with the text, but at present the last two sentences are a bit incomprehensible|date=May 2018}}\n\nHowever, the work of Louis XVIII was frustrated when, after his death in 16 September 1824, his brother the [[Count of Artois]] became King under the name of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]]. Charles X was a strong [[reactionary]] who supported ultra-royalists and [[Catholic Church in France|Catholic Church]]. Under his reign, the censorship of newspapers was reinforced, the [[Anti-Sacrilege Act]] passed and compensations to [[French emigration (1789\u20131815)|French \u00c9migr\u00e9]] were increased.

in the north there were Viking incursions leading to the formation of the [[Duchy of Normandy]]; in the west, the [[counts of Anjou]] established themselves as powerful rivals of the king, by the late 11th century ruling over the \"[[Angevin Empire]]\", which included the [[kingdom of England]]. \nIt was only with [[Philip II of France]] that the bulk of the territory of Western Francia came under the rule of the Frankish kings, and Philip was consequently the first king to call himself \"king of France\" (1190). \nThe division of France between the Angevin (Plantagenet) kings of England and the Capetian kings of France would lead to the [[Hundred Years' War]], and France would regain control over these territories only by the mid 15th century.\nWhat is now eastern France (Lorraine,

France|early modern]] monarchy in [[Western Europe]]. It was among the most powerful states in Europe and a [[great power]] since the [[Late Middle Ages]]. It was also an early [[French colonial empire|colonial power]], with possessions around the world.\n\nFrance originated as [[West Francia]] (''Francia Occidentalis''), the western half of the [[Carolingian Empire]], with the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843). A branch of the Carolingian dynasty continued to rule until 987, when [[Hugh Capet]] was elected king and founded the [[Capetian dynasty]]. The territory remained known as ''Francia'' and its ruler as ''rex Francorum'' (\"king of the Franks\") well into the [[High Middle Ages]]. The first king calling himself ''Roi de France'' (\"King of France\") was [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], in 1190. France continued to be ruled by the Capetians and their cadet lines\u2014the [[House of Valois|Valois]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]]\u2014until the monarchy was abolished in 1792 during the [[French Revolution]].\n\n[[France in the Middle Ages]] was a de-centralised, [[Feudalism|feudal]] monarchy. In [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]] and [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]] (now a part of Spain) the authority of the French king was barely felt. [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] and [[Kingdom of Arles|Provence]] were states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and not yet a part of France. Initially, West Frankish kings were elected by the secular and ecclesiastic magnates, but the regular coronation of the eldest son of the reigning king during his father's lifetime established the principle of male primogeniture, which became codified in the [[Salic law]]. During the [[Late Middle Ages]], the [[Kings of England]] laid claim to the French throne, resulting in a series of conflicts known as the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337\u20131453). Emerging victorious from said conflicts, France subsequently sought to extend its influence into Italy, but was defeated by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in the ensuing [[Italian Wars]] (1494\u20131559).\n\n[[Early modern France|France in the early modern era]] was increasingly centralised; the [[French language]] began to displace other languages from official use, and the monarch expanded his [[Absolute monarchy|absolute power]], albeit in an administrative system (the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'') complicated by historic and regional irregularities in taxation, legal, judicial, and ecclesiastic divisions, and local prerogatives. Religiously France became divided between the Catholic majority and a Protestant minority, the [[Huguenots]], which led to a series of civil wars, the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] (1562\u20131598). The Wars of Religion crippled France but triumph over [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in the Thirty Years' War made France the most powerful nation on the continent once more as the kingdom became Europe's dominant cultural, political, and military power in the 17th century under the [[Louis XIV|Sun King]].<ref>{{cite book |author=R.R.

Wars with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] led to the loss of much of its [[New France|North American holdings]] by 1763. [[France in the American Revolutionary War|French intervention in the American Revolutionary War]] helped secure the independence of  the new United States of America but was costly and achieved little for France.\n\nThe Kingdom of France [[Kingdom of France (1791\u201392)|adopted a written constitution]] in 1791, but the Kingdom was abolished a year later and replaced with the [[First French Republic]]. The [[Bourbon Restoration|monarchy was restored]] by the other great powers in 1814 and lasted (except for the [[Hundred Days]] in 1815) until the [[French Revolution of 1848]].\n\n==Political history==\n===West Francia===\n{{Main article|West Francia}}\n{{Further information|Carolingian Empire}}\n\nDuring the later years of the elderly [[Charlemagne]]'s rule, the [[Viking]]s made advances along the northern and western perimeters of the [[Kingdom of the Franks]]. After Charlemagne's death in 814 his heirs were incapable of maintaining political unity and the empire began to crumble. The [[Treaty of Verdun]] of 843 divided the Carolingian Empire into three parts, with  [[Charles the Bald]] ruling over [[West Francia]], the nucleus of what would develop into the kingdom of France.<ref>{{cite book |author=Roger Price|title=A Concise History of France |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AYjB2-RnWUwC&pg=PA30 |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=30 |isbn = 9780521844802 }}</ref>\nCharles the Bald was also crowned [[kingdom of Lotharingia|King of Lotharingia]] after the death of [[Lothair II]] in 869, but in the  [[Treaty of Meerssen]] (870) was forced to cede much of Lotharingia to his brothers, retaining the [[Rhone]] and [[Meuse]] basins (including [[Verdun]], [[Vienne]] and [[Besan\u00e7on]]) but leaving the [[Rhineland]] with [[Aachen]], [[Metz]] and [[Trier]] in [[East Francia]].\n\nViking advances were allowed to increase, and their dreaded [[longship]]s were sailing up the [[Loire]] and [[Seine]] rivers and other inland waterways, wreaking havoc and spreading terror. During the reign of [[Charles the Simple]] (898\u2013922), Normans under [[Rollo]] from [[Norway]], were settled in an area on either side of the River Seine, downstream from Paris, that was to become [[Normandy]].<ref>Jim Bradbury.

With its offshoots, the houses of [[House of Valois|Valois]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]], it was to rule France for more than 800 years.<ref>{{cite book|author=William W.

After defeating a [[Revolt of 1173\u20131174|revolt]] led by Eleanor and three of their four sons, Henry had Eleanor imprisoned, made the [[List of rulers of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] his vassal, and in effect ruled the western half of France as a greater power than the French throne. However, disputes among Henry's descendants over the division of his French territories, coupled with [[John of England]]'s lengthy quarrel with Philip II, allowed [[Philip II of France|Philip II]] to recover influence over most of this territory. After the French victory at the [[Battle of Bouvines]] in 1214, the English monarchs maintained power only in southwestern Duchy of [[Guyenne]].<ref>Peter Shervey Lewis, ''Later medieval France: the polity'' (1968).</ref>\n\n===Late Middle Ages and the Hundred Years' War===\n{{Main article|France in the Middle Ages|Hundred Years' War}}\n\nThe death of [[Charles IV of France]] in 1328 without male heirs ended the main Capetian line. Under [[Salic law]] the crown could not pass through a woman (Philip IV's daughter was Isabella, whose son was [[Edward III of England]]), so the throne passed to [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]], son of [[Charles of Valois]]. This, in addition to a long-standing dispute over the rights to Gascony in the south of France, and the relationship between England and the Flemish cloth towns, led to the [[Hundred Years' War]] of 1337\u20131453. The following century was to see devastating warfare, peasant revolts (the [[English peasants' revolt of 1381]] and the ''[[Jacquerie]]'' of 1358 in France) and the growth of nationalism in both countries.<ref>Alice Minerva Atkinson, ''A Brief History of the Hundred Years' War'' (2012)</ref>\n\nThe losses of the century of war were enormous, particularly owing to the plague (the [[Black Death]], usually considered an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]]), which arrived from Italy in 1348, spreading rapidly up the Rhone valley and thence across most of the country: it is estimated that a population of some 18\u201320 million in modern-day France at the time of the 1328 [[hearth tax]] returns had been reduced 150 years later by 50 percent or more.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joseph P.

Articles 110 and 111, the most famous, called for the use of the [[French language]] in all legal acts, notarised contracts and official legislation.\n\n====Italian Wars====\n{{Main article|Italian Wars}}\nAfter the Hundred Years' War, [[Charles VIII of France]] signed three additional treaties with [[Henry VII of England]], [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I of Habsburg]], and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] respectively at [[Peace of Etaples|\u00c9taples]] (1492), [[Treaty of Senlis|Senlis]] (1493) and in [[Treaty of Barcelona|Barcelona]] (1493). These three treaties cleared the way for France to undertake the long [[Italian Wars]] (1494\u20131559), which marked the beginning of early modern France. French efforts to gain dominance resulted only in the increased power of the [[Habsburg]] house.\n\n====Wars of Religion====\n{{Main article|French Wars of Religion}}\n\nBarely were the Italian Wars over, when France was plunged into a domestic crisis with far-reaching consequences. Despite the conclusion of [[Concordat of Bologna|a Concordat]] between France and the Papacy (1516), granting the crown unrivalled power in senior ecclesiastical appointments, France was deeply affected by the [[Protestant Reformation]]'s attempt to break the hegemony of Catholic Europe. A growing urban-based Protestant minority (later dubbed ''[[Huguenots]]'') faced ever harsher repression under the rule of Francis I's son [[Henry II of France|King Henry II]]. After Henry II's death in a joust, the country was ruled by his widow [[Catherine de' Medici]] and her sons [[Francis II of France|Francis II]], [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] and [[Henry III of France|Henry III]]. Renewed Catholic reaction headed by the powerful dukes of [[Guise]] culminated in a massacre of Huguenots (1562), starting the first of the [[French Wars of Religion]], during which English, German, and Spanish forces intervened on the side of rival Protestant and Catholic forces. Opposed to absolute monarchy, the Huguenot [[Monarchomachs]] theorized during this time the [[right of rebellion]] and the legitimacy of [[tyrannicide]].<ref>Mack P. Holt, ''The French wars of religion, 1562\u20131629'' (2005).</ref>\n\nThe Wars of Religion culminated in the [[War of the Three Henrys (1584-1598)|War of the Three Henrys]] in which [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] assassinated [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Henry de Guise]], leader of the Spanish-backed [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic league]], and the king was murdered in return. After the assassination of both Henry of Guise (1588) and Henry III (1589), the conflict was ended by the accession of the Protestant king of [[Navarre]] as [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (first king of the [[Bourbon dynasty]]) and his subsequent abandonment of Protestantism (Expedient of 1592) effective in 1593, his acceptance by most of the Catholic establishment (1594) and by the Pope (1595), and his issue of the toleration decree known as the [[Edict of Nantes]] (1598), which guaranteed freedom of private worship and civil equality.<ref>David Buisseret, ''Henry IV, King of France'' (1990).</ref>\n\n===Early Modern period===\n{{Main article|Early modern France}}\n{{Multiple image\n| total_width = 300\n| image1 = Henry IV of france by pourbous younger.jpg\n| image2 = Louis XIIIval grace.jpg\n| footer = [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (left), by [[Frans Pourbus the younger]] (1610), [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] (right), by [[Philippe de Champaigne]] (1647)\n| align = right\n| direction = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\n====Colonial France====\n{{Main article|New France}}\nFrance's pacification under [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] laid much of the ground for the beginnings of France's rise to European hegemony. France was expansive during all but the end of the seventeenth century: the French began trading in [[India]] and [[Madagascar]], founded [[Quebec City|Quebec]] and penetrated the North American [[Great Lakes]] and [[Mississippi]], established plantation economies in the [[West Indies]] and extended their trade contacts in the [[Levant]] and enlarged their [[merchant marine]].\n\n====Thirty Years' War====\nHenry IV's son [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] and his minister (1624\u20131642) [[Cardinal Richelieu]], elaborated a policy against Spain and the Holy Roman Empire during the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348) which had broken out in Germany. After the death of both king and cardinal, the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) secured universal acceptance of Germany's political and religious fragmentation, but the Regency of [[Anne of Austria]] and her minister [[Cardinal Mazarin]] experienced a civil uprising known as the [[Fronde]] (1648\u20131653) which expanded into a [[Fronde|Franco-Spanish War]] (1653\u201359). The [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] (1659) formalised France's seizure (1642) of the Spanish territory of [[Roussillon]] after the crushing of the ephemeral [[Catalan Republic (1641)|Catalan Republic]] and ushered a short period of peace.<ref>Peter H. Wilson, ''Europe's Tragedy: A History of the Thirty Years' War'' (2009).</ref>\n\n====Administrative structures====\n{{Main article|Ancien R\u00e9gime}}\n\nThe ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', a French term rendered in English as \"Old Rule\", or simply \"Former Regime\", refers primarily to the aristocratic, social and political system of early modern France under the [[Valois dynasty|late Valois]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] dynasties.  The administrative and social structures of the Ancien R\u00e9gime were the result of years of state-building, legislative acts (like the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats]]), internal conflicts and civil wars, but they remained a confusing patchwork of local [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] and historic differences until the [[French Revolution]] brought about a radical suppression of administrative incoherence.\n\n====Louis XIV, the Sun King====\n{{Main article|Louis XIV of France}}\n\n[[File:Louis XIV of France.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], by [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]], 1701]]\n\nFor most of the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] (1643\u20131715), (\"The Sun King\"), France was the dominant power in Europe, aided by the diplomacy of Cardinal Richelieu's successor as the King's chief minister, (1642\u201361) [[Cardinal Jules Mazarin]], (1602\u201361). Cardinal Mazarin oversaw the creation of a French Royal Navy that rivalled [[Royal Navy|England's]], expanding it from 25 ships to almost 200. The size of the Army was also considerably increased. Renewed wars (the [[War of Devolution]], 1667\u201368 and the [[Franco-Dutch War]], 1672\u201378) brought further territorial gains ([[Artois]] and western [[Flanders]] and the free [[county of Burgundy]], previously left to the Empire in 1482), but at the cost of the increasingly concerted opposition of rival royal powers, and a legacy of an increasingly enormous national debt. An adherent of the theory of the [[divine right of kings|\"Divine Right of Kings\"]], which advocates the divine origin of temporal power and any lack of earthly restraint of monarchical rule, Louis XIV continued his predecessors' work of creating a [[Centralized government|centralized state]] governed from the capital of Paris. He sought to eliminate the remnants of [[feudalism]] still persisting in parts of France and, by compelling the noble elite to regularly inhabit his lavish [[Palace of Versailles]], built on the outskirts of Paris, succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy, many members of which had participated in the earlier \"[[Fronde]]\" rebellion during Louis' minority youth. By these means he consolidated a system of absolute monarchy in France that endured 150 years until the [[French Revolution]].<ref>William Beik, ''Louis XIV and Absolutism: A Brief Study with Documents'' (2000)</ref>  McCabe says critics used fiction to portray the degraded Turkish Court, using \"the harem, the Sultan court, oriental despotism, luxury, gems and spices, carpets, and silk cushions\" as an unfavorable analogy to the corruption of the French royal court.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ina Baghdiantz McCabe|title=Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade, Exoticism, and the Ancien R\u00e9gime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3MmvAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA134|year=2008|publisher=Berg|page=134|isbn=9781847884633}}</ref>\n\nThe king sought to impose total religious uniformity on the country, repealing the \"[[Edict of Nantes]]\" in 1685. The infamous practice of \"[[dragonnades]]\" was adopted, whereby intentionally rough soldiers were quartered in the homes of Protestant families and allowed to have their way with them \u2014 stealing, raping, torturing and killing adults and infants in their hovels. It is estimated that anywhere between 150,000 and 300,000 Protestants fled France during the wave of persecution that followed the repeal,<ref>[https://www.letemps.ch/monde/rome-protestante-face-aux-exiles-foi La Rome protestante face aux exil\u00e9s de la foi]</ref><ref>[http://books.openedition.org/pur/5650  Le Refuge protestant urbain au temps de la r\u00e9vocation de l\u2019\u00c9dit de Nantes]</ref> (following \"[[Huguenots]]\" beginning a hundred and fifty years earlier until the end of the 18th century) costing the country a great many intellectuals, artisans, and other valuable people. Persecution extended to unorthodox Roman Catholics like the [[Jansenists]], a group that denied free will and had already been condemned by the popes. Louis was no theologian and understood little of the complex doctrines of Jansenism, satisfying himself with the fact that they threatened the unity of the state. In this, he garnered the friendship of the papacy, which had previously been hostile to France because of its policy of putting all church property in the country under the jurisdiction of the state rather than that of Rome.<ref>John B. Wolf, ''Louis XIV'' (1974)</ref>\n\nIn November 1700, the Spanish king [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] died, ending the Habsburg line in that country. Louis had long waited for this moment, and now planned to put a Bourbon relative, [[Philip, Duke of Anjou]], (1683\u20131746), on the throne. Essentially, [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]] was to become a perpetual ally and even obedient satellite of France, ruled by a king who would carry out orders from Versailles. Realizing how this would upset the balance of power, the other European rulers were outraged. However, most of the alternatives were equally undesirable. For example, putting another Habsburg on the throne would end up recreating the grand multi-national empire of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (1500\u201358), of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (German First Reich), [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]], and the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Two Sicilies]] which would also grossly upset the power balance. After nine years of exhausting war, the last thing Louis wanted was another conflict. However, the rest of Europe would not stand for his ambitions in Spain, and so the long [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began (1701\u201314), a mere three years after the [[War of the Grand Alliance]], (1688\u201397, aka \"War of the League of Augsburg\") had just concluded.<ref>Daniel Roche, France in the Enlightenment (1998)</ref>\n\n====Dissent and revolution====\n{{main article|French Revolution}}\n[[File:France anciennes provinces 1789.jpg|upright=1.15|left|thumb|Provinces in 1789]]\n\nThe reign (1715\u201374) of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] saw an initial return to peace and prosperity under the regency (1715\u201323) of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], whose policies were largely continued (1726\u20131743) by [[Cardinal Fleury]], prime minister in all but name. The exhaustion of Europe after two major wars resulted in a long period of peace, only interrupted by minor conflicts like the [[War of the Polish Succession]] from 1733\u201335. Large-scale warfare resumed with the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740\u201348). But alliance with the traditional Habsburg enemy (the \"[[Diplomatic Revolution]]\" of 1756) against the rising power of Britain and [[Prussia]] led to costly failure in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u201363) and the loss of France's North American colonies.<ref>Colin Jones, ''The Great Nation: France from Louis XV to Napoleon'' (2003)</ref>\n{{Multiple image\n|total_width=300\n|image1=Louis XV by Maurice-Quentin de La Tour.jpg\n|image2=Antoine-Fran\u00e7ois Callet - Louis XVI, roi de France et de Navarre (1754-1793), rev\u00eatu du grand costume royal en 1779 - Google Art Project.jpg\n|footer=[[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] (left), by [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] (1748); [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] (right), by [[Antoine-Fran\u00e7ois Callet]] (1775)\n}}\nOn the whole, the 18th century saw growing discontent with the monarchy and the established order. Louis XV was a highly unpopular king for his sexual excesses, overall weakness, and for losing Canada to the British. A strong ruler like Louis XIV could enhance the position of the monarchy, while Louis XV weakened it. The writings of the [[philosophes]] such as [[Voltaire]] were a clear sign of discontent, but the king chose to ignore them. He died of [[smallpox]] in 1774, and the French people shed few tears at his passing. While France had not yet experienced the [[Industrial Revolution]] that was beginning in Britain, the rising middle class of the cities felt increasingly frustrated with a system and rulers that seemed silly, frivolous, aloof, and antiquated, even if true feudalism no longer existed in France.\n\nUpon Louis XV's death, his grandson [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] became king. Initially popular, he too came to be widely detested by the 1780s. He was married to an Austrian archduchess, [[Marie Antoinette]]. French intervention in the American War of Independence was also very expensive.<ref>William Doyle, ''The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction'' (2001)</ref>\n\nWith the country deeply in debt, Louis XVI permitted the radical reforms of [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] and [[Guillaume-Chr\u00e9tien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Malesherbes]], but noble disaffection led to Turgot's dismissal and Malesherbes' resignation in 1776. They were replaced by [[Jacques Necker]]. Necker had resigned in 1781 to be replaced by [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne|Calonne]] and [[\u00c9tienne Charles de Lom\u00e9nie de Brienne|Brienne]], before being restored in 1788. A harsh winter that year led to widespread food shortages, and by then France was a powder keg ready to explode.<ref>Sylvia Neely, ''A Concise History of the French Revolution '' (2008)</ref>\nOn the eve of the [[French Revolution]] of July 1789, France was in a profound institutional and financial crisis, but the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] had begun to permeate the educated classes of society.<ref>Daniel Roche, ''France in the Enlightenment'' (1998)</ref>\n\n=== Limited monarchy ===\nOn September 3, 1791, the absolute monarchy which had governed France for 948 years was forced to limit its power and become a provisional constitutional monarchy. However, this too would not last very long and on September 21, 1792 the French monarchy was effectively abolished by the proclamation of the [[French First Republic]]. The role of the King in France was finally ended with the execution of [[Louis XVI]] by [[guillotine]] on Monday, January 21, 1793, followed by the \"[[Reign of Terror]]\", mass executions and the provisional \"[[French Directory|Directory]]\" form of [[French First Republic|republican government]], and the eventual beginnings of twenty-five years of reform, upheaval, dictatorship, wars and renewal, with the various [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\n===Restoration===\n{{Main article|Bourbon Restoration}}\n{{Multiple image\n|total_width=300\n|image1=G\u00e9rard - Louis XVIII of France in Coronation Robes.jpg\n|image2=Carlos X de Francia (Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard).jpg\n|footer=The two kings of the Restoration: [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] (left) by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]] (1820s), [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] (right) by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]] (1825)\n}}\n\nThe monarchy was briefly restored following the successive events of the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u201399), and the [[First French Empire|First French Empire under Napoleon]] (1804\u20131814/15)&nbsp;\u2013 when a [[War of the Sixth Coalition|coalition of European powers]] restored by arms the monarchy to the heirs of the [[House of Bourbon]] in 1814. However the deposed Emperor [[Napoleon I]] returned triumphantly to Paris from his exile in [[Elba]] and ruled France for a short period known as the [[Hundred Days]].\n\nWhen a [[War of the Seventh Coalition|Seventh European Coalition]] deposed Napoleon after the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815, the Bourbon monarchy was once again restored. \nThe [[Count of Provence]], brother of Louis XVI, who was guillotined in 1793, was crowned as [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], nicknamed \"The Desired\". Louis XVIII tried to conciliate the legacies of the Revolution and Ancien R\u00e9gime both, also permitting the formation of a [[French Parliament|Parliament]] and [[Charter of 1814|constitutional Charter]], usually \"''Charte octroy\u00e9e''\" (\"Granted Charter\"). His reign was characterized by disagreements between the [[Doctrinaires]], liberal thinkers who supported the Charter and rising [[bourgeoisie]], and the [[Ultra-royalist]]s, aristocrats and clergymen who totally refused the Revolution's heritage. However, peace was maintained by statesmen like [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]] and the [[Armand-Emmanuel de Vignerot du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu|Duke of Richelieu]], as well as the King's moderation and prudent intervention.<ref>Actes du congr\u00e8s \u2013 vol. 3, 1961, p.&nbsp;441.</ref><ref>Emmanuel de Waresquiel, 2003, pp.&nbsp;460\u2013461.</ref> In 1823, the liberal agitations in Spain led to a [[Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis|French intervention]] on the royalist's side, who permitted to King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] to reject the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Constitution]]. {{clarify|it's not clear if someone has been messing with the text, but at present the last two sentences are a bit incomprehensible|date=May 2018}}\n\nHowever, the work of Louis XVIII was frustrated when, after his death in 16 September 1824, his brother the [[Count of Artois]] became King under the name of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]]. Charles X was a strong [[reactionary]] who supported ultra-royalists and [[Catholic Church in France|Catholic Church]]. Under his reign, the censorship of newspapers was reinforced, the [[Anti-Sacrilege Act]] passed and compensations to [[French emigration (1789\u20131815)|French \u00c9migr\u00e9]] were increased.

11th century ruling over the \"[[Angevin Empire]]\", which included the [[kingdom of England]]. \nIt was only with [[Philip II of France]] that the bulk of the territory of Western Francia came under the rule of the Frankish kings, and Philip was consequently the first king to call himself \"king of France\" (1190). \nThe division of France between the Angevin (Plantagenet) kings of England and the Capetian kings of France would lead to the [[Hundred Years' War]], and France would regain control over these territories only by the mid 15th century.\nWhat is now eastern France (Lorraine,
