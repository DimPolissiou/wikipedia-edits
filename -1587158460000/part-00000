This suggests people's beliefs influence their actions. The principle behind this phenomenon is people create consequences regarding people or events, based on their previous knowledge toward that specific subject. Additionally, a self-fulfilling prophecy is applicable to negative and positive outcomes.\n\nAmerican sociologist [[William Isaac Thomas]] was the first to discover this phenomenon. In 1928 he developed the [[Thomas theorem]] (also known as the Thomas dictum), stating,\n{{cquote|If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.<ref>''The child in America: Behavior problems and programs.'' W.I. Thomas and D.S. Thomas. New York: Knopf, 1928: 571\u2013572</ref>}}\nIn other words, the consequence will come to fruition based on how one interprets the situation. Using Thomas' idea, another American sociologist, [[Robert K. Merton]], coined the term ''self-fulfilling prophecy'', popularizing the idea \u201c...a belief or expectation, correct or incorrect, could bring about a desired or expected outcome.\u201d<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\nMerton applied this concept to a fictional situation. In  his book ''[[Social Theory and Social Structure]]'', he uses the example of a [[bank run]] to show how self-fulfilling thoughts can make unwanted situations happen. He mentions how a number of people falsely believe the bank was going to file for bankruptcy. Because of this false fear, many people decide to go to the bank and ask for all of their cash at once. These actions cause the bank to indeed go bankrupt because banks rarely have the amount of cash on hand to satisfy a large number of customers asking for all of their deposited cash at once. \n\nMerton concludes this example with the analysis, \u201cThe prophecy of collapse led to its own fulfillment.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=On social structure and science|last=Merton, Robert King, 1910-2003.|date=1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226520706|oclc=34116334}}</ref>\n\nWhile Merton\u2019s example focused on self-fulfilling prophecies within a business, his theory is also applicable to interpersonal communication since it is found to have a \u201cpotential for triggering self-fulfilling prophecy effects\u201d<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|chapter=Self-Fulfilling Prophecy|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|doi=10.1007/springerreference_180548|title=Springer ''Reference''|year=2011}}</ref> .

I had called this the \"Oedipus effect\", because the oracle played a most important role in the sequence of events which led to the fulfilment of its prophecy. \u2026 For a time I thought that the existence of the Oedipus effect distinguished the social from the natural sciences.

However, psychologist Robert Barnsley showed that in any elite group of hockey players, 40% are born between January and March, versus the approximately 25% as would be predicted by statistics. The explanation is that in Canada, the eligibility cutoff for age-class hockey is January 1, and the players who are born in the first months of the year are older by 0\u201311 months, which at the preadolescent age of selection (nine or ten) manifests into an important physical advantage.

Instead, the teacher and the counselor recommended classes that were dominated by females.\n\n==Literature, media, and the arts==\nIn literature, self-fulfilling prophecies are often used as [[plot device]]s. They have been used in stories for millennia, but have gained a lot of popularity recently in the [[science fiction]] genre. They are typically used ironically, with the prophesied events coming to pass due to the actions of one trying to prevent the prophecy (a recent example would be the life of [[Anakin Skywalker]], the fictional Jedi-turned-Sith Lord in [[George Lucas]]' [[Star Wars (franchise)|''Star Wars'' saga]]). They are also sometimes used as comic relief.\n\n===Classical===\nMany myths, legends, and fairy tales make use of this motif as a central element of narratives that are designed to illustrate [[Destiny|inexorable fate]], fundamental to the Hellenic world-view.<ref>See [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]], [[Moirai]], [[Erinyes]]. \"Very often the bases for false definitions and consequent self-fulfilling prophecies are deeply rooted in the individual or group norms and are subsequently difficult to change\". (Wilkins 1976:177).</ref> In a common motif, a child, whether newborn or not yet conceived, is prophesied to cause something that those in power do not want to happen. This may be the death of the powerful person; in more light-hearted versions, it is often the marriage of a poor or lower-class child to his own.<!--own what?--> The events come about, nevertheless, as a result of the actions taken to prevent them: frequently [[Child abandonment#Child abandonment in literature|child abandonment]] sets the chain of events in motion.\n\n====Greek====\n[[File:Oedipe enfant.JPG|thumb|[[Oedipus]] in the arms of [[Phorbas]].]]\nThe best-known example from Greek legend is that of [[Oedipus]]. Warned that his child would one day kill him, [[Laius]] abandoned his newborn son Oedipus to die, but Oedipus was found and raised by others, and thus in ignorance of his true origins. When he grew up, Oedipus was warned that he would kill his father and marry his mother. Believing his foster parents were his real parents, he left his home and travelled to Greece, eventually reaching the city where his biological parents lived. There, he got into a fight with a stranger, his real father, killed him and married his widow, Oedipus' real mother.\n\nAlthough the legend of [[Perseus]] opens with the prophecy that he will kill his grandfather [[Acrisius]], and his abandonment with his mother [[Dana\u00eb]], the prophecy is only self-fulfilling in some variants. In some, he accidentally spears his grandfather at a competition\u2014an act that could have happened regardless of [[Acrisius]]' response to the prophecy. In other variants, his presence at the games is explained by his hearing of the prophecy, so that his attempt to evade it does cause the prophecy to be fulfilled. In still others, [[Acrisius]] is one of the wedding guests when [[Polydectes]] tried to force Dana\u00eb to marry him, and when [[Perseus]] turns them to stone with the [[Medusa|Gorgon]]'s head; as Polydectes fell in love with Dana\u00eb because Acrisius abandoned her at sea, and Perseus killed the Gorgon as a consequence of Polydectes' attempt to get rid of Dana\u00eb's son so that he could marry her, the prophecy fulfilled itself in these variants.\n\nGreek historiography provides a famous variant: when the Lydian king [[Croesus]] asked the [[Delphic Oracle]] if he should invade Persia, the response came that if he did, he would destroy a great kingdom. Assuming this meant he would succeed, he attacked\u2014but the kingdom he destroyed was his own.<ref>Herodotus ''Histories'' 1.88</ref> In such an example, the prophecy prompts someone to action because he is led to expect a favorable result; but he achieves another, disastrous result which nonetheless fulfills the prophecy.\n\nWhen it was predicted that [[Cronus|Cronos]] would be overthrown by his son, and usurp his throne as King of the Gods, Cronus ate his children, each shortly after they were born. When Zeus was born, Cronos was thwarted by Rhea, who gave him a stone to eat instead, sending Zeus to be raised by [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]]. Cronos' attempt to avoid the prophecy made Zeus his enemy,  ultimately leading to its fulfilment.\n\n====Roman====\n[[File:Lupa romana.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Romulus and Remus]] feeding from a wolf.]]\nThe story of [[Romulus and Remus]] is another example. According to legend, a man overthrew his brother, the king. He then ordered that his two nephews, Romulus and Remus, be drowned, fearing that they would someday kill him as he did to his brother. The boys were placed in a basket and thrown in the [[Tiber River]]. A wolf found the babies and she raised them. Later, a shepherd found the twins and named them Romulus and Remus. As teenagers, they found out who they were. They killed their uncle, fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n====Arabic====\nA variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy is the self-fulfilling dream, which dates back to medieval [[Arabic literature]]. Several tales in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights'', use this device to [[Foreshadowing|foreshadow]] what is going to happen, as a special form of literary [[Flashforward|prolepsis]]. A notable example is \"[[The Ruined Man Who Became Rich Again Through a Dream]]\", in which a man is told in his dream to leave his native city of [[Baghdad]] and travel to [[Cairo]], where he will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man travels there and experiences misfortune after losing belief in the prophecy, ending up in jail, where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant of this story later appears in [[English folklore]] as the \"[[Pedlar of Swaffham]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|pages=193\u2013194}}</ref>\n\nAnother variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy can be seen in \"[[The Tale of Attaf]]\", where [[Harun al-Rashid]] consults his library (the [[House of Wisdom]]), reads a random book, \"falls to laughing and weeping and dismisses the faithful ''[[vizier]]''\" [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] from sight. Ja'far, \"disturbed and upset flees Baghdad and plunges into a series of adventures in [[Damascus]], involving Attaf and the woman whom Attaf eventually marries.\" After returning to Baghdad, Ja'far reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In other words, it was Harun's reading of the book that provoked the adventures described in the book to take place. This is an early example of [[Retrocausality|reverse causality]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=199}}</ref> In the 12th century, this tale was [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by [[Petrus Alphonsi]] and included in his ''Disciplina Clericalis''. In the 14th century, a version of this tale also appears in the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]'' and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|page=109}}</ref>\n\n====Hinduism====\n[[File:Radhakrishna manor.JPG|thumb|right|[[Krishna]] playing his flute with [[Radha]].]]\nSelf-fulfilling prophecies appear in classical [[Sanskrit literature]]. In the story of [[Krishna]] in the [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the ruler of the [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] kingdom, [[Kamsa|Kansa]], afraid of a prophecy that predicted his death at the hands of his sister [[Devaki]]'s son, had her cast into prison where he planned to kill all of her children at birth. After killing the first six children, and Devaki's apparent miscarriage of the seventh, Krishna (the eighth son) was born. As his life was in danger he was smuggled out to be raised by his foster parents [[Yashoda]] and [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]] in the village of [[Gokula]]. Years later, Kansa learned about the child's escape and kept sending various demons to put an end to him. The demons were defeated at the hands of Krishna and his brother [[Balarama]]. Krishna, as a young man returned to Mathura to overthrow his uncle, and Kansa was eventually killed by his nephew Krishna. It was due to Kansa's attempts to prevent the prophecy that led to it coming true, thus fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n====Rusan====\n[[Oleg of Novgorod]] was a [[Varangian]] prince who ruled over the [[Rus (people)|Rus people]] during the early tenth century. As old [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]] chronicles say, it was prophesied by the pagan priests that Oleg's stallion would be the source of Oleg's death. To avoid this he sent the horse away. Many years later he asked where his horse was, and was told it had died. He asked to see the remains and was taken to the place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse's skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull and bit him. Oleg died, thus fulfilling the prophecy. In the [[Primary Chronicle]], Oleg is known as the Prophet, ironically referring to the circumstances of his death. The story was romanticized by [[Alexander Pushkin]] in his celebrated ballad \"The Song of the Wise Oleg\". In Scandinavian traditions, this legend lived on in the saga of [[Orvar-Odd]].\n\n====European fairy tales====\nMany fairy tales, such as ''[[The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs]]'', ''[[The Fish and the Ring]]'', ''[[The Story of Three Wonderful Beggars]]'', or ''[[The King Who Would Be Stronger Than Fate]]'', revolve about a prophecy that a poor boy will marry a rich girl (or, less frequently, a poor girl a rich boy).<ref>Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p 139, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977</ref> This is story type 930 in the [[Aarne\u2013Thompson classification system|Aarne\u2013Thompson]] classification scheme. The girl's father's efforts to prevent it are the reason why the boy ends up marrying her.\n\nAnother fairy tale occurs with older children. In ''[[The Language of the Birds]]'', a father forces his son to tell him what the birds say: that the father would be the son's servant. In ''[[The Ram (fairy tale)|The Ram]]'', the father forces his daughter to tell him her dream: that her father would hold an ewer for her to wash her hands in. In all such tales, the father takes the child's response as evidence of ill-will and drives the child off; this allows the child to change so that the father will not recognize his own offspring later and so offer to act as the child's servant.\n\nIn some variants of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', such as ''[[Sun, Moon, and Talia]]'', the sleep is not brought about by a curse, but a prophecy that she will be endangered by flax (or hemp) results in the royal order to remove all the flax or hemp from the castle, resulting in her ignorance of the danger and her curiosity.\n\n====Shakespeare====\n[[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' is another classic example of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The three witches give Macbeth a prophecy that Macbeth will eventually become king, but afterwards, the offspring of his best friend will rule instead of his own. Macbeth tries to make the first half true while trying to keep his bloodline on the throne instead of his friend's. Spurred by the prophecy, he kills the king and his friend, something he, arguably, never would have done before. In the end, the evil actions he committed to avoid his succession by another's bloodline get him killed in a revolution.\n\nThe later prophecy by the first apparition of the witches that Macbeth should \"Beware Macduff\" is also a self-fulfilling prophecy. If Macbeth had not been told this, then he might not have regarded Macduff as a threat. Therefore, he would not have killed Macduff's family, and Macduff would not have sought revenge and killed Macbeth.\n\n===Modern===\nSimilar to Oedipus above, a more modern example would be [[Darth Vader]] in the ''Star Wars'' films, or [[Lord Voldemort]] in the [[Harry Potter (franchise)|Harry Potter]] franchise and the Big Three in [[Percy Jackson & the Olympians]] - each attempted to take steps to prevent action against them which had been predicted could cause their downfall, but instead ''created'' the conditions leading to it. Another, less well-known, modern example occurred with the character John Mitchell on [[BBC Three]]'s ''[[Being Human (UK TV series)|Being Human]]''. The Disney television series ''[[That's So Raven]]'' stars [[Raven-Symon\u00e9]] as the title character with the ability to see into the future with a strange situation. The extreme steps that the character takes to prevent the situation are almost always what lead to it. In [[George R. R.

This suggests people's beliefs influence their actions. The principle behind this phenomenon is people create consequences regarding people or events, based on their previous knowledge toward that specific subject. Additionally, a self-fulfilling prophecy is applicable to negative and positive outcomes.\n\nAmerican sociologist [[William Isaac Thomas]] was the first to discover this phenomenon. In 1928 he developed the [[Thomas theorem]] (also known as the Thomas dictum), stating,\n{{cquote|If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.<ref>''The child in America: Behavior problems and programs.'' W.I. Thomas and D.S. Thomas. New York: Knopf, 1928: 571\u2013572</ref>}}\nIn other words, the consequence will come to fruition based on how one interprets the situation. Using Thomas' idea, another American sociologist, [[Robert K. Merton]], coined the term ''self-fulfilling prophecy'', popularizing the idea \u201c...a belief or expectation, correct or incorrect, could bring about a desired or expected outcome.\u201d<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\nMerton applied this concept to a fictional situation. In  his book ''[[Social Theory and Social Structure]]'', he uses the example of a [[bank run]] to show how self-fulfilling thoughts can make unwanted situations happen. He mentions how a number of people falsely believe the bank was going to file for bankruptcy. Because of this false fear, many people decide to go to the bank and ask for all of their cash at once. These actions cause the bank to indeed go bankrupt because banks rarely have the amount of cash on hand to satisfy a large number of customers asking for all of their deposited cash at once. \n\nMerton concludes this example with the analysis, \u201cThe prophecy of collapse led to its own fulfillment.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=On social structure and science|last=Merton, Robert King, 1910-2003.|date=1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226520706|oclc=34116334}}</ref>\n\nWhile Merton\u2019s example focused on self-fulfilling prophecies within a business, his theory is also applicable to interpersonal communication since it is found to have a \u201cpotential for triggering self-fulfilling prophecy effects\u201d<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|chapter=Self-Fulfilling Prophecy|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|doi=10.1007/springerreference_180548|title=Springer ''Reference''|year=2011}}</ref> .

I had called this the \"Oedipus effect\", because the oracle played a most important role in the sequence of events which led to the fulfilment of its prophecy. \u2026 For a time I thought that the existence of the Oedipus effect distinguished the social from the natural sciences.

However, psychologist Robert Barnsley showed that in any elite group of hockey players, 40% are born between January and March, versus the approximately 25% as would be predicted by statistics. The explanation is that in Canada, the eligibility cutoff for age-class hockey is January 1, and the players who are born in the first months of the year are older by 0\u201311 months, which at the preadolescent age of selection (nine or ten) manifests into an important physical advantage.

They have been used in stories for millennia, but have gained a lot of popularity recently in the [[science fiction]] genre. They are typically used ironically, with the prophesied events coming to pass due to the actions of one trying to prevent the prophecy (a recent example would be the life of [[Anakin Skywalker]], the fictional Jedi-turned-Sith Lord in [[George Lucas]]' [[Star Wars (franchise)|''Star Wars'' saga]]). They are also sometimes used as comic relief.\n\n===Classical===\nMany myths, legends, and fairy tales make use of this motif as a central element of narratives that are designed to illustrate [[Destiny|inexorable fate]], fundamental to the Hellenic world-view.<ref>See [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]], [[Moirai]], [[Erinyes]]. \"Very often the bases for false definitions and consequent self-fulfilling prophecies are deeply rooted in the individual or group norms and are subsequently difficult to change\". (Wilkins 1976:177).</ref> In a common motif, a child, whether newborn or not yet conceived, is prophesied to cause something that those in power do not want to happen. This may be the death of the powerful person; in more light-hearted versions, it is often the marriage of a poor or lower-class child to his own.<!--own what?--> The events come about, nevertheless, as a result of the actions taken to prevent them: frequently [[Child abandonment#Child abandonment in literature|child abandonment]] sets the chain of events in motion.\n\n====Greek====\n[[File:Oedipe enfant.JPG|thumb|[[Oedipus]] in the arms of [[Phorbas]].]]\nThe best-known example from Greek legend is that of [[Oedipus]]. Warned that his child would one day kill him, [[Laius]] abandoned his newborn son Oedipus to die, but Oedipus was found and raised by others, and thus in ignorance of his true origins. When he grew up, Oedipus was warned that he would kill his father and marry his mother. Believing his foster parents were his real parents, he left his home and travelled to Greece, eventually reaching the city where his biological parents lived. There, he got into a fight with a stranger, his real father, killed him and married his widow, Oedipus' real mother.\n\nAlthough the legend of [[Perseus]] opens with the prophecy that he will kill his grandfather [[Acrisius]], and his abandonment with his mother [[Dana\u00eb]], the prophecy is only self-fulfilling in some variants. In some, he accidentally spears his grandfather at a competition\u2014an act that could have happened regardless of [[Acrisius]]' response to the prophecy. In other variants, his presence at the games is explained by his hearing of the prophecy, so that his attempt to evade it does cause the prophecy to be fulfilled. In still others, [[Acrisius]] is one of the wedding guests when [[Polydectes]] tried to force Dana\u00eb to marry him, and when [[Perseus]] turns them to stone with the [[Medusa|Gorgon]]'s head; as Polydectes fell in love with Dana\u00eb because Acrisius abandoned her at sea, and Perseus killed the Gorgon as a consequence of Polydectes' attempt to get rid of Dana\u00eb's son so that he could marry her, the prophecy fulfilled itself in these variants.\n\nGreek historiography provides a famous variant: when the Lydian king [[Croesus]] asked the [[Delphic Oracle]] if he should invade Persia, the response came that if he did, he would destroy a great kingdom. Assuming this meant he would succeed, he attacked\u2014but the kingdom he destroyed was his own.<ref>Herodotus ''Histories'' 1.88</ref> In such an example, the prophecy prompts someone to action because he is led to expect a favorable result; but he achieves another, disastrous result which nonetheless fulfills the prophecy.\n\nWhen it was predicted that [[Cronus|Cronos]] would be overthrown by his son, and usurp his throne as King of the Gods, Cronus ate his children, each shortly after they were born. When Zeus was born, Cronos was thwarted by Rhea, who gave him a stone to eat instead, sending Zeus to be raised by [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]]. Cronos' attempt to avoid the prophecy made Zeus his enemy,  ultimately leading to its fulfilment.\n\n====Roman====\n[[File:Lupa romana.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Romulus and Remus]] feeding from a wolf.]]\nThe story of [[Romulus and Remus]] is another example. According to legend, a man overthrew his brother, the king. He then ordered that his two nephews, Romulus and Remus, be drowned, fearing that they would someday kill him as he did to his brother. The boys were placed in a basket and thrown in the [[Tiber River]]. A wolf found the babies and she raised them. Later, a shepherd found the twins and named them Romulus and Remus. As teenagers, they found out who they were. They killed their uncle, fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n====Arabic====\nA variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy is the self-fulfilling dream, which dates back to medieval [[Arabic literature]]. Several tales in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights'', use this device to [[Foreshadowing|foreshadow]] what is going to happen, as a special form of literary [[Flashforward|prolepsis]]. A notable example is \"[[The Ruined Man Who Became Rich Again Through a Dream]]\", in which a man is told in his dream to leave his native city of [[Baghdad]] and travel to [[Cairo]], where he will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man travels there and experiences misfortune after losing belief in the prophecy, ending up in jail, where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant of this story later appears in [[English folklore]] as the \"[[Pedlar of Swaffham]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|pages=193\u2013194}}</ref>\n\nAnother variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy can be seen in \"[[The Tale of Attaf]]\", where [[Harun al-Rashid]] consults his library (the [[House of Wisdom]]), reads a random book, \"falls to laughing and weeping and dismisses the faithful ''[[vizier]]''\" [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] from sight. Ja'far, \"disturbed and upset flees Baghdad and plunges into a series of adventures in [[Damascus]], involving Attaf and the woman whom Attaf eventually marries.\" After returning to Baghdad, Ja'far reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In other words, it was Harun's reading of the book that provoked the adventures described in the book to take place. This is an early example of [[Retrocausality|reverse causality]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=199}}</ref> In the 12th century, this tale was [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by [[Petrus Alphonsi]] and included in his ''Disciplina Clericalis''. In the 14th century, a version of this tale also appears in the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]'' and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|page=109}}</ref>\n\n====Hinduism====\n[[File:Radhakrishna manor.JPG|thumb|right|[[Krishna]] playing his flute with [[Radha]].]]\nSelf-fulfilling prophecies appear in classical [[Sanskrit literature]]. In the story of [[Krishna]] in the [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the ruler of the [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] kingdom, [[Kamsa|Kansa]], afraid of a prophecy that predicted his death at the hands of his sister [[Devaki]]'s son, had her cast into prison where he planned to kill all of her children at birth. After killing the first six children, and Devaki's apparent miscarriage of the seventh, Krishna (the eighth son) was born. As his life was in danger he was smuggled out to be raised by his foster parents [[Yashoda]] and [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]] in the village of [[Gokula]]. Years later, Kansa learned about the child's escape and kept sending various demons to put an end to him. The demons were defeated at the hands of Krishna and his brother [[Balarama]]. Krishna, as a young man returned to Mathura to overthrow his uncle, and Kansa was eventually killed by his nephew Krishna. It was due to Kansa's attempts to prevent the prophecy that led to it coming true, thus fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n====Rusan====\n[[Oleg of Novgorod]] was a [[Varangian]] prince who ruled over the [[Rus (people)|Rus people]] during the early tenth century. As old [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]] chronicles say, it was prophesied by the pagan priests that Oleg's stallion would be the source of Oleg's death. To avoid this he sent the horse away. Many years later he asked where his horse was, and was told it had died. He asked to see the remains and was taken to the place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse's skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull and bit him. Oleg died, thus fulfilling the prophecy. In the [[Primary Chronicle]], Oleg is known as the Prophet, ironically referring to the circumstances of his death. The story was romanticized by [[Alexander Pushkin]] in his celebrated ballad \"The Song of the Wise Oleg\". In Scandinavian traditions, this legend lived on in the saga of [[Orvar-Odd]].\n\n====European fairy tales====\nMany fairy tales, such as ''[[The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs]]'', ''[[The Fish and the Ring]]'', ''[[The Story of Three Wonderful Beggars]]'', or ''[[The King Who Would Be Stronger Than Fate]]'', revolve about a prophecy that a poor boy will marry a rich girl (or, less frequently, a poor girl a rich boy).<ref>Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p 139, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977</ref> This is story type 930 in the [[Aarne\u2013Thompson classification system|Aarne\u2013Thompson]] classification scheme. The girl's father's efforts to prevent it are the reason why the boy ends up marrying her.\n\nAnother fairy tale occurs with older children. In ''[[The Language of the Birds]]'', a father forces his son to tell him what the birds say: that the father would be the son's servant. In ''[[The Ram (fairy tale)|The Ram]]'', the father forces his daughter to tell him her dream: that her father would hold an ewer for her to wash her hands in. In all such tales, the father takes the child's response as evidence of ill-will and drives the child off; this allows the child to change so that the father will not recognize his own offspring later and so offer to act as the child's servant.\n\nIn some variants of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', such as ''[[Sun, Moon, and Talia]]'', the sleep is not brought about by a curse, but a prophecy that she will be endangered by flax (or hemp) results in the royal order to remove all the flax or hemp from the castle, resulting in her ignorance of the danger and her curiosity.\n\n====Shakespeare====\n[[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' is another classic example of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The three witches give Macbeth a prophecy that Macbeth will eventually become king, but afterwards, the offspring of his best friend will rule instead of his own. Macbeth tries to make the first half true while trying to keep his bloodline on the throne instead of his friend's. Spurred by the prophecy, he kills the king and his friend, something he, arguably, never would have done before. In the end, the evil actions he committed to avoid his succession by another's bloodline get him killed in a revolution.\n\nThe later prophecy by the first apparition of the witches that Macbeth should \"Beware Macduff\" is also a self-fulfilling prophecy. If Macbeth had not been told this, then he might not have regarded Macduff as a threat. Therefore, he would not have killed Macduff's family, and Macduff would not have sought revenge and killed Macbeth.\n\n===Modern===\nSimilar to Oedipus above, a more modern example would be [[Darth Vader]] in the ''Star Wars'' films, or [[Lord Voldemort]] in the [[Harry Potter (franchise)|Harry Potter]] franchise and the Big Three in [[Percy Jackson & the Olympians]] - each attempted to take steps to prevent action against them which had been predicted could cause their downfall, but instead ''created'' the conditions leading to it. Another, less well-known, modern example occurred with the character John Mitchell on [[BBC Three]]'s ''[[Being Human (UK TV series)|Being Human]]''. The Disney television series ''[[That's So Raven]]'' stars [[Raven-Symon\u00e9]] as the title character with the ability to see into the future with a strange situation. The extreme steps that the character takes to prevent the situation are almost always what lead to it. In [[George R. R. Martin]]\u2019s book series [[a Song of Ice and Fire]], [[Cersei Lannister]] kills a friend of hers after hearing a prophecy, from Maggy the Frog, that said friend will soon die.\n\nThe song \"Iron Man\" by British heavy metal band [[Black Sabbath]] follows the story of a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n====New Thought====\nThe [[law of attraction (New Thought)|law of attraction]] is a typical example of self-fulfilling prophecy. It is the name given to the belief that \"like attracts like\" and that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, one can bring about positive or negative results.<ref name=gazette>Whittaker, S.

{"title_page": "Participism", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=May 2015}}\n{{Libertarianism sidebar}}\n{{Libertarian socialism sidebar}}\n\n'''Participism''' is a [[libertarian socialist]] political philosophy consisting of two independently created economic and political systems: [[participatory economics]] (\"parecon\") and [[participatory politics]] (\"parpolity\"). Participism is intended as an alternative to both [[capitalism]] and centrally-planned [[state socialism]]. Participism has significantly informed the International Organization for a Participatory Society.\n{{Socialism sidebar}}\n\n==Overview==\nAdvocates of participism envision remaking all of [[human]] [[society]] from the bottom up according to principles of [[Radical democracy|direct participatory democracy]] and replacing economic and social competition with cooperation. Supporters of what is termed a \"participatory society\" support the eventual dissolution of the centralized [[Sovereign state|state]], [[market (economics)|market]]s, and [[money]] (in its current form) placing it in the tradition of anti-authoritarian libertarian socialism. To elucidate their vision for a new society, advocates of participism categorize their aspirations into what they term a \"liberating theory\".\n\nLiberating theory is a [[holistic]] framework for understanding society that looks at the whole of society and the interrelations among different parts of people's social lives. Participism groups human society into four primary \"spheres\", all of which are set within an international and [[ecological]] context, and each of which has a set of defining functions:\n\n*The [[Participatory politics|political]] sphere: policy-making, administration, and collective implementation.\n*The [[Participatory Economics|economic]] sphere: production, consumption, and allocation of the material means of life.\n*The [[Femminism|kinship]] sphere: procreation, nurturance, socialisation, gender, sexuality, and organisation of daily home life.\n*The [[Polyculturalism|community]] sphere: development of collectively shared historical identities, culture, religion, spirituality, linguistic relations, lifestyles, and social celebrations.\n\nWithin each sphere there are two components. The first component is the ''Human Centre'', the collection of people living within a society. Each person has needs, desires, personalities, characteristics, skills, capacities, and consciousness. The second component is the ''Institutional Boundary'', all of society\u2019s social institutions that come together to form interconnected roles, relationships, and commonly held expectations and patterns of behaviour, that produce and reproduce societal outcomes. These institutions come together to help shape who people are as individuals.\n\n===Participatory politics===\n\n{{Main|Participatory politics}}\n\n''Parpolity'' is the political system first proposed by [[Stephen R. Shalom]], professor of [[political science]] at William Paterson University in New Jersey. Shalom has stated that Parpolity is meant as a long range vision of where [[social justice]] should reach its apex within the field of politics and should complement the level of participation in the economy with an equal degree of participation in policy and administrative matters.\n[[File:Nested council.png|thumb|right|upright=2.0|A diagram of the nested council structure.]]\nThe values on which parpolity is based are:\n*[[Political freedom|freedom]]\n*[[Workers' self-management|self-management]]\n*[[justice]]\n*[[solidarity]]\n*and [[Toleration|tolerance]].\n\nThe goal, according to Shalom, is to create a political system that will allow people to participate, as much as possible in a direct and face to face manner. The proposed decision-making principle is that every person should have say in a decision proportionate to the degree to which she or he is affected by that decision.\n\nThe vision is critical of aspects of modern representative democracies arguing that the level of political control by the people isn't sufficient. To address this problem parpolity suggests a system of Nested Councils, which would include every adult member of a given society.\n\nIn a country or society run according to participism, there would be local councils of voting citizens consisting of 25-50 members. These local councils would be able to pass any law that affected only the local council. No higher council would be able to override the decisions of a lower council, only a council court would be able to challenge a local law on [[human rights]] grounds. The councils would be based on [[consensus]], though majority votes are allowed when issues cannot be agreed upon.\n\nEach local council would send a delegate to a higher level council, until that council fills with 25-50 members. These second level councils would pass laws on matters that effect the 625 to 2500 citizens that it represents. A delegate to a higher level council is bound to communicate the views of her or his sending council, but is not bound to vote as the sending council might wish. Otherwise, Shalom points out that there is no point in having nested councils, and everyone might as well vote on everything. A delegate is recallable at any time by her or his sending council. Rotation of delegates would be mandatory, and delegates would be required to return to their sending councils frequently.\n\nThe second level council sends a delegate to a third level council, the third level councils send delegates to a fourth level and so on until all citizens are represented. Five levels with 50 people on every council would represent 312,500,000 voters (around the population of the United States). However, the actual number of people represented would be even higher, given that young children would not be voting. Thus, with a further sixth level nested council, the entire human population could be represented. This would not however be equatable to a global world state, but rather would involve the dissolution of all existing [[nation-states]] and their replacement with a worldwide [[confederal]] \"coordinating body\" made of delegates immediately recallable by the nested council below them.\n\nLower level councils have the opportunity to hold referendums at any time to challenge the decisions of a higher level council. This would theoretically be an easy procedure, as when a threshold of lower level councils call for a referendum, one would then be held. Shalom points out that sending every issue to lower level councils is a waste of time, as it is equivalent to [[referendum]] democracy.\n\nThere would be staff employed to help manage council affairs. Their duties would perhaps include minute taking and researching issues for the council. These council staff would work in a balanced job complex defined by a participatory economy.\n\n===Participatory economics===\n\n{{Main|Participatory economics}}\n\n''Parecon (participatory economics)'' is an economic system proposed primarily by activist and political theorist [[Michael Albert]] and radical economist [[Robin Hahnel]]. It uses participatory decision making as an economic mechanism to guide the [[Production (economics)|production]], [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] and [[Resource allocation|allocation]] of resources in a given society. It is described as \"an anarchistic economic vision\", and a form of [[socialism]], the means of production are [[common ownership|owned in common]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The theory is proposed as an alternative to both contemporary capitalist market economies and centrally planned socialism. It distinguishes between two parts of the working class. The 'coordinator class' that does the conceptual, creative and managerial work and the rest of the class doing rote work. This situation is deemed 'coordinatorism', which the theory claims it to be a major flaw with [[Marxism]].{{r|looking|p=4-8}}\n\nThe underlying values that parecon seeks to implement are equity, solidarity, diversity, [[workers' self-management]] and efficiency. (Efficiency here means accomplishing goals without wasting valued assets.) It proposes to attain these ends mainly through the following principles and institutions:\n* [[Workers councils|workers' and consumers' councils]] utilizing self-managerial methods for making decisions,\n* balanced job complexes,\n* remuneration according to effort and sacrifice, and\n* [[Economic democracy|participatory planning]].\n\nIn place of money parecon would have a form of currency in which [[Labour voucher|personal vouchers]] or \"credits\" would be awarded for work done to purchase goods and services. Unlike money, credits would disappear upon purchase, and would be non-transferable between individuals, making bribery and monetary theft impossible. Also, the only items or services with a price attached would most likely be those considered wants or non-essentials and anything deemed a need would be completely free of charge (e.g.: health care, public transportation).\n\nAlbert and Hahnel have stressed that parecon is only meant to address an alternative ''economic'' theory and must be accompanied by equally important alternative visions in the fields of politics, culture and kinship. The authors have also discussed elements of [[social anarchism]] in the field of politics, [[polyculturalism]] in the field of culture, and [[feminism]] in the field of family/kinship and gender relations as being possible foundations for future alternative visions in these other spheres of society. Since the publication of Albert's book \"Parecon\", other thinkers have come forward and incorporated these concepts which have rounded participism into a more fully formed political and social ideology.\n\n===Feminist kinship===\n''See also [[Nurture kinship]] and [[Free love]]''\n\nOutside of both political and economic relations there still exists the sphere of human kinship. Participism sees this as a vital component in a liberated society and applies feminist principles to this aspect of human relations. Feminist kinship relations are seen to seek to free people from oppressive definitions that have been socially imposed and to abolish all sexual divisions of labour and [[sexist]] and [[heterosexist]] demarcation of individuals according to gender and sexuality.\n\nParticipism holds that a participatory society must be respectful on an individual\u2019s nature, inclinations, and choices and all people must be provided with the means to pursue the lives they want regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, or age. Feminist kinship relations are dependent on the liberation of women, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] persons, youth, the elderly, and intersex ([[true hermaphroditism|hermaphroditic]] and [[pseudohermaphroditism|pseudohermaphroditic]]) individuals.\n\nTo extend liberation into daily home life, a participatory society aims to provide the means for traditional couples, single parents, [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transsexualism|transsexual]], [[transgender]], and [[intersex]] parents, communal parenting, [[polygamy]] (especially [[polyandry]]), [[polyamory|polyamorous]] and multiple parenting arrangements to develop and flourish. It is believed that within the home and the community, the task of raising children must be elevated in status. Highly personalised interaction between children and adults should be encouraged, and responsibilities for these interactions must be distributed equitably throughout society without segregating tasks by gender. A participatory society would provide parents with access to high quality day-care, flexible work hours, and parental leave options allowing them to play a more active role in the lives of their children.\n\nThe liberation of women and society from patriarchal and [[heteronormativity|heteronormative]] oppression, according to participism, requires total reproductive freedom. Society must provide all members with the right to family planning, without shame or guilt for performing or soliciting an abortion or for engaging in alternative sexual behavior and without fear of sterilization or economic deprivation; the right to have or not to have children and to terminate undesired pregnancies through unhindered access to [[birth control]] and unregulated [[abortion]], respectively; and the right to comprehensive sexual education and [[healthcare]] that provide every citizen with information and resources to live a healthy and fulfilling sex life.\n\nIn such [[sex-positivity|sex-positive]] participatory societies the full exploration of human sexuality, with the possible exception of [[child sexuality]], would be accepted and embraced as normative. Participism encourages the exercise of and experimentation of different forms of sexuality by consenting partners.\n\n===Polycultural community===\nHuman society is held to have long and brutal history of conquest, [[colonisation]], [[genocide]], and slavery which cannot be transcended easily. To begin the step-by-step process of building a new historical legacy and set of behavioural expectations between [[community|communities]], a participatory society would construct intercommunalist institutions to provide communities with the means to assure the preservation of their diverse cultural traditions and to allow for their continual development. With [[Polyculturalism|polycultural]] intercommunalism, all material and psychological privileges that are currently granted to a section of the population at the expense of the dignity and standards of living for oppressed communities, as well as the division of communities into subservient positions according to culture, ethnicity, nationality, and religion, will be dissolved.\n \nThe multiplicity of cultural communities and the historical contributions of different communities would be respected, valued, and preserved by guaranteeing each sufficient material and communicative means to reproduce, self-define, develop their own cultural traditions, and represent their culture to all other communities. Through construction of intercommunalist relations and institutions that guarantee each community the means necessary to carry on and develop their traditions, a participatory society assists eliminating negative inter-community relations and encourages positive interaction between communities that can enhance the internal characteristics of each.\n \nIn a participatory society, individuals would be free to choose the cultural communities they prefer and members of every community would have the right of dissent and to leave. Intervention would not be permitted except to preserve this right for all. Those outside a community would also be free to criticize cultural practices that they believe violate acceptable social norms, but the majority would not have the power to impose its will on a vulnerable minority.\n\n==Criticisms==\n\n===Anarchism===\nCertain [[anarchism|anarchists]] of the libcom community (an internet community of [[Anarcho-communism|libertarian communists]]) have criticized the [[parpolity]] aspect of participism for deciding beforehand the scale and scope of the councils whilst only practice, they argue, can accurately indicate the size and scale of anarchist confederations and other organizational platforms, especially since each region is unique with unique residents and unique solutions and unique wants. Anarchists argue that such blueprints containing detailed information are either dangerous or pointless. Furthermore, some anarchists have criticized the potential use of referendums to challenge decisions taken by higher councils as this implies both a top-down structure and an absence of [[participatory democracy|vis-\u00e0-vis democracy]] as they argue that referendums are not participatory.<ref name=\"libcom1\">[http://libcom.org/library/participatory-society-or-libertarian-communism Parecon or libertarian communism?]. libcom.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.</ref>\n\nThey have also criticized the enforcement of laws passed by councils rather than the use of supposed voluntary custom or [[customary law]] which develops through mutual recognition rather than being enforced by an external authority, as they argue the laws passed by such councils would need to be.<ref name=\"libcom1\"/>\n\n===Capitalism===\nThe [[criticism of socialism]] could be applied to participism as well, as advocates of capitalism object to the absence of a market and [[private property]] in a hypothetical participatory society. However, in a debate with David Horowitz, Michael Albert argued that those criticisms could not apply to parecon, as it was especially designed to take them into account. New specific criticisms should then be formulated. For instance, in an answer to the comments of David Kotz and John O'Neill about one of their articles on the subject, Albert and Hahnel assert that they designed parecon understanding \"that knowledge is distributed unequally throughout society\",<ref>Albert, Michael and Robin Hahnel. 2002. \"Reply\".

For instance, in an answer to the comments of David Kotz and John O'Neill about one of their articles on the subject, Albert and Hahnel assert that they designed parecon understanding \"that knowledge is distributed unequally throughout society\",<ref>Albert, Michael and Robin Hahnel. 2002. \"Reply\". In ''Science and Society'', vol. 66, no. 1, p. 26, [online]. http://gesd.free.fr/albert.pdf</ref> hypothetically answering to the famous criticisms of Friedrich Von Hayek on the possibility of planning.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Participatory culture]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"looking\">{{cite book|last1=Albert|first1=Michael|last2=Hanhel|first2=Robin|title=Looking Forward: Participatory Economics for the Twenty First Century|date=1990|publisher=[[South End Press]]|isbn=9780896084056|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingforward00albe}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.zcommunications.org/znet/topics/parecon Participatory economics website]\n* [http://vanparecon.resist.ca/ Vancouver Participatory Economics Collective]\n* [http://www.a-zone.org/ Old Market Autonomous Zone (Winnipeg)]\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024175828/http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/4957 |title=Article about Parpolity: Political Vision for a Good Society by Stephen R.

To counter this, Brave Seijin chose seven (initially, only five; Geki and Rai joined later on) youngsters from Earth to receive the DagBraces and turn into Dagwon, the alien equivalent to \"brave\".\n\nDrawing inspiration from [[Super Sentai]], the youngsters can don [[Power Armor|battle suits]] by activating their braces with the voice command '''''\"Try Dagwon!\"''''', which grant them pseudo-elemental powers and attacks as well as amplified physical power and advanced protection. If that is not enough, they have personal vehicles at their disposal which can turn into humanoid robots. Through '''{{Nihongo|''Fusion Combine''|\u878d\u5408\u5408\u4f53|''Y\u016bg\u014d Gattai''}}''', they merge with their vehicles and control their humanoid forms as if they were their own bodies. If even greater power is needed, the heroes can merge with additional support units, or even with each other to create stronger robotic warriors.\n\nIn addition to the heroes, other friendly mechanical aliens arrive to aid their quest. Lian, last survivor of his race, is essentially a huge sword who helped the team after they've proven their worth to him. Gunkid, who can take on the form of a jet or a bazooka, was initially on Sargasso's side before he decided to help the Dagwon team. Lian proceeded to become the teacher of Gunkid. The team also have a large robotic base called Dag Base at their disposal.\n\n==Composition==\n''Dagwon'' consists of 48 episodes, first aired on [[Nagoya TV]] from February 3, 1996 to January 25, 1997. Its success warranted the two-episode OVA {{Nihongo|\"The Boy with Crystal Eyes\"|\u6c34\u6676\u306e\u77b3\u306e\u5c11\u5e74|Suish\u014d no Hitomi no Sh\u014dnen}}, which came out in September 1997. The show currently is not licensed in the US as is the status with all the other Brave Series, except GaoGaiGar.\n\nDespite the series' lack of popularity among children, it found an audience among young females, who enjoyed the bish\u014dnen main characters.\n\n==The Team==\n\n==={{Nihongo|En Daidouji|\u5927\u5802\u5bfa \u708e|Daid\u014dji En}}===\nVoiced by [[K\u014dichi T\u014dchika]]\n\nThe [[fire]] warrior. The stereotypical hot-headed and determined type. Reckless, short-tempered and stubborn to a fault, but also brave, fearless and a loyal friend. En often locks heads with Kai, who just so happens to be his superior in school. He develops a close friendship with Ryu in the beginning of the series. He's the only one on the team who has two different vehicular bodies (that can merge into one). His robots are stand alone versions and do not combine with his teammates'. En's vehicle's are Fire Stratos, based on a Lancia Stratos. Fire Jumbo, based on a Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet. Fire Ladder, based on a Japanese Fire Truck. Fire Rescue, based on a Japanese Ambulance. And Fire Shovel, based on an Excavator .\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|Try Dagwon|| En = Fire En\n|-\n|Y\u016bg\u014d Gattai|| Fire En + [[Lancia Stratos HF|Fire Stratos]] = DagFire\n|-\n|{{Nihongo|Kaen Gattai|\u706b\u708e\u5408\u4f53|extra=Blaze Combine}}|| DagFire + [[Boeing 747|Fire Jumbo]] + [[Fire apparatus|Fire Ladder]] + [[Ambulance|Fire Rescue]] = Fire Dagwon\n|-\n|{{Nihongo|G\u014driki Gattai|\u525b\u529b\u5408\u4f53|extra=Strength Combine}}|| DagFire + [[Excavator|Fire Shovel]] = Power Dagwon\n|-\n|{{Nihongo|Ch\u014d Kaen Gattai|\u8d85\u706b\u708e\u5408\u4f53|extra=Super Blaze Combine}}|| Fire Dagwon + Power Dagwon = Super Fire Dagwon\n|}\n\n==={{Nihongo|Kai Hirose|\u5e83\u702c \u6d77|Hirose Kai}}===\nVoiced by [[Takehito Koyasu]]\n\nThe [[speed]] warrior. Kai is head of the student council and practitioner of [[Kendo]]. He is almost always seen carrying a [[Shinai]], which he uses to enforce the rules at school. He also tries to remind the team of their job and that it's not only fun and games, but does not always succeed since his strict, no-nonsense personality tends to rub them the wrong way. Kai vehicle is Turbo Liner, based on a 300 Series Shinkansen.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|Try Dagwon|| Kai = Turbo Kai\n|-\n|Y\u016bg\u014d Gattai|| Turbo Kai + [[300 Series Shinkansen|Turbo Liner]] = DagTurbo\n|-\n|{{Nihongo|J\u016bren Gattai|\u91cd\u9023\u5408\u4f53|extra=Coupling Combine}}|| DagTurbo + DagArmor + DagWing = Liner Dagwon\n|-\n|{{Nihongo|Ch\u014d J\u016bren Gattai|\u8d85\u91cd\u9023\u5408\u4f53|extra=Super Coupling Combine}}|| DagTurbo + DagArmor + DagWing + DagDrill = Super Liner Dagwon\n|}\n\n==={{Nihongo|Shin Sawamura|\u6ca2\u9091 \u68ee|Sawamura Shin}}===\nVoiced by [[Jin Yamanoi]]\n\nThe [[weapons]] warrior. Shin is a luckless flirt with girls and has an alarming tendency to get shot down whenever he talks to one. In spite of this, Shin is friendly and good-natured. He is also skilled at martial arts, as seen when he uses [[Judo]] to stop a purse-snatching in the first episode. Shin's vehicle is Armor Liner, based on an E1 Series Shinkansen.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|Try Dagwon|| Shin = Armor Shin\n|-\n|Y\u016bg\u014d Gattai|| Armor Shin + [[E1 Series Shinkansen|Armor Liner]] = DagArmor\n|-\n|{{Nihongo|J\u016bren Gattai|\u91cd\u9023\u5408\u4f53|extra=Coupling Combine}}|| DagTurbo + DagArmor + DagWing = Liner Dagwon\n|-\n|{{Nihongo|Ch\u014d J\u016bren Gattai|\u8d85\u91cd\u9023\u5408\u4f53|extra=Super Coupling Combine}}|| DagTurbo + DagArmor + DagWing + DagDrill = Super Liner Dagwon\n|}\n\n==={{Nihongo|Yoku Kazamatsuri|\u98a8\u796d \u7ffc|Kazamatsuri Yoku}}===\nVoiced by [[Hiro Y\u016bki]]\n\nThe [[sky]] warrior. Shy and a bit geeky, Yoku is the brains of the team. He is very knowledgeable and computer savvy. He also likes to study strange and unusual things. Yoku's vehicle is the Wing Liner, based on a 400 Series Shinkansen.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|Try Dagwon|| Yoku = Wing Yoku\n|-\n|Y\u016bg\u014d Gattai|| Wing Yoku + [[400 Series Shinkansen|Wing Liner]] = DagWing\n|-\n|{{Nihongo|J\u016bren Gattai|\u91cd\u9023\u5408\u4f53|extra=Coupling Combine}}|| DagTurbo + DagArmor + DagWing = Liner Dagwon\n|-\n|{{Nihongo|Ch\u014d J\u016bren Gattai|\u8d85\u91cd\u9023\u5408\u4f53|extra=Super Coupling Combine}}|| DagTurbo + DagArmor + DagWing + DagDrill = Super Liner Dagwon\n|}\n\n==={{Nihongo|Ryu Hashiba|\u5203\u67f4 \u7adc|Hashiba Ry\u016b}}===\nVoiced by [[Atsushi Kisaichi]]\n\nThe [[shadow]] warrior. Calm, mysterious and a puzzle even to his team members. He's the only one to have \"subordinates\", animal robots stored in the form of cards. He was the last of the team to achieve his mecha fusion. Ryu develops a close friendship with En in the beginning of the series. Ryu is one of two members of the team who doesn't get an upgrade combination. Ryu's Vehicle is the Shadow Jet, based on a F-15 Eagle.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|Try Dagwon|| Ryu = Shadow Ryu\n|-\n|Y\u016bg\u014d Gattai|| Shadow Ryu + [[F-15 Eagle|Shadow Jet]] = DagShadow/Shadow Dragon\n|-\n|{{Nihongo|Kij\u016b Gattai|\u6a5f\u7363\u5408\u4f53|extra=Mecha-beast Combine}}|| DagShadow/Shadow Dragon + Guard Tiger + Guard Wolf + Guard Hawk = Shadow Dagwon\n|}\n\n==={{Nihongo|Geki Kuroiwa|\u9ed2\u5ca9 \u6fc0|Kuroiwa Geki}}===\nVoiced by [[Hisao Egawa]]\n\nThe [[Earth's surface|ground]] warrior. Geki has a rivalry with En, who injured his arm in a fight at Geki's old school. He is even more short tempered and impatient than En and has a serious crush on Maria. Geki had something of a misguided view on being a hero at first, but eventually became a valuable member of the group. His robot, Dag Drill combines with Kai's, Shin's and Yoku's. Geki's vehicle is Drill Liner, based on a JRN Class C62 Steam engine.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|Try Dagwon|| Geki = Drill Geki\n|-\n|Y\u016bg\u014d Gattai|| Drill Geki + [[C62 steam locomotive|Drill Liner]] = DagDrill\n|-\n|{{Nihongo|Ch\u014d J\u016bren Gattai|\u8d85\u91cd\u9023\u5408\u4f53|extra=Super Coupling Combine}}|| DagTurbo + DagArmor + DagWing + DagDrill = Super Liner Dagwon\n|}\n\n==={{Nihongo|Rai Utsumi|\u5b87\u6d25\u7f8e \u96f7|Utsumi Rai}}===\nVoiced by [[Kappei Yamaguchi]]\n\nThe [[thunder]] warrior. An alien Dagwon officer, Rai appears late in the series. He is very good looking, which earns him the unwanted advances of practically every female student at the boys' school. Rai hates the attention and gets embarrassed and flustered by it easily. Like En, his robot, DagThunder is a stand-alone mecha and does not combine with the others. Thunder Dagwon is based on Galaxy Shuttle from [[Transformers: Victory]]. Like Ryu, Rai doesn't combine with any other mechs to achieve an upgrade.Rai's vehicle's are the Thunder Bike, based on a Sidecar Motorcycle. And the Thunder Shuttle, based on a Space Shuttle.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|Try Dagwon|| Rai = Thunder Rai\n|-\n|Y\u016bg\u014d Gattai|| Thunder Rai + [[Sidecar|Thunder Bike]] = DagThunder\n|-\n|{{Nihongo|Raimei Gattai|\u96f7\u9cf4\u5408\u4f53|extra=Thunder Combine}}|| DagThunder + [[Space Shuttle|Thunder Shuttle]] = Thunder Dagwon\n|}\n\n==The Allies==\n\n===Humans===\n; {{Nihongo|Maria Tobe|\u6238\u90e8 \u771f\u7406\u4e9c|Tobe Maria}}\n: Voiced by [[Miki Nagasawa]]\n: En's classmate.

To counter this, Brave Seijin chose seven (initially, only five; Geki and Rai joined later on) youngsters from Earth to receive the DagBraces and turn into Dagwon, the alien equivalent to \"brave\".\n\nDrawing inspiration from [[Super Sentai]], the youngsters can don [[Power Armor|battle suits]] by activating their braces with the voice command '''''\"Try Dagwon!\"''''', which grant them pseudo-elemental powers and attacks as well as amplified physical power and advanced protection. If that is not enough, they have personal vehicles at their disposal which can turn into humanoid robots. Through '''{{Nihongo|''Fusion Combine''|\u878d\u5408\u5408\u4f53|''Y\u016bg\u014d Gattai''}}''', they merge with their vehicles and control their humanoid forms as if they were their own bodies. If even greater power is needed, the heroes can merge with additional support units, or even with each other to create stronger robotic warriors.\n\nIn addition to the heroes, other friendly mechanical aliens arrive to aid their quest. Lian, last survivor of his race, is essentially a huge sword who helped the team after they've proven their worth to him. Gunkid, who can take on the form of a jet or a bazooka, was initially on Sargasso's side before he decided to help the Dagwon team. Lian proceeded to become the teacher of Gunkid. The team also have a large robotic base called Dag Base at their disposal.\n\n==Composition==\n''Dagwon'' consists of 48 episodes, first aired on [[Nagoya TV]] from February 3, 1996 to January 25, 1997. Its success warranted the two-episode OVA {{Nihongo|\"The Boy with Crystal Eyes\"|\u6c34\u6676\u306e\u77b3\u306e\u5c11\u5e74|Suish\u014d no Hitomi no Sh\u014dnen}}, which came out in September 1997. The show currently is not licensed in the US as is the status with all the other Brave Series, except GaoGaiGar.\n\nDespite the series' lack of popularity among children, it found an audience among young females, who enjoyed the bish\u014dnen main characters.\n\n==The Team==\n\n==={{Nihongo|En Daidouji|\u5927\u5802\u5bfa \u708e|Daid\u014dji En}}===\nVoiced by [[K\u014dichi T\u014dchika]]\n\nThe [[fire]] warrior. The stereotypical hot-headed and determined type. Reckless, short-tempered and stubborn to a fault, but also brave, fearless and a loyal friend. En often locks heads with Kai, who just so happens to be his superior in school. He develops a close friendship with Ryu in the beginning of the series. He's the only one on the team who has two different vehicular bodies (that can merge into one). His robots are stand alone versions and do not combine with his teammates'. En\u2019s vehicle\u2019s are Fire Stratos, based on a Lancia Stratos. Fire Jumbo, based on a Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet. Fire Ladder, based on a Japanese Fire Truck. Fire Rescue, based on a Japanese Ambulance.

Kai is head of the student council and practitioner of [[Kendo]]. He is almost always seen carrying a [[Shinai]], which he uses to enforce the rules at school. He also tries to remind the team of their job and that it's not only fun and games, but does not always succeed since his strict, no-nonsense personality tends to rub them the wrong way. Kai vehicle is Turbo Liner, based on a 300 Series Shinkansen.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|Try Dagwon|| Kai = Turbo Kai\n|-\n|Y\u016bg\u014d Gattai|| Turbo Kai + [[300 Series Shinkansen|Turbo Liner]] = DagTurbo\n|-\n|{{Nihongo|J\u016bren Gattai|\u91cd\u9023\u5408\u4f53|extra=Coupling Combine}}|| DagTurbo + DagArmor + DagWing = Liner Dagwon\n|-\n|{{Nihongo|Ch\u014d J\u016bren Gattai|\u8d85\u91cd\u9023\u5408\u4f53|extra=Super Coupling Combine}}|| DagTurbo + DagArmor + DagWing + DagDrill = Super Liner Dagwon\n|}\n\n==={{Nihongo|Shin Sawamura|\u6ca2\u9091 \u68ee|Sawamura Shin}}===\nVoiced by [[Jin Yamanoi]]\n\nThe [[weapons]] warrior. Shin is a luckless flirt with girls and has an alarming tendency to get shot down whenever he talks to one. In spite of this, Shin is friendly and good-natured. He is also skilled at martial arts, as seen when he uses [[Judo]] to stop a purse-snatching in the first episode. Shin\u2019s vehicle is Armor Liner, based on a E1 Series Shinkansen.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|Try Dagwon|| Shin = Armor Shin\n|-\n|Y\u016bg\u014d Gattai|| Armor Shin + [[E1 Series Shinkansen|Armor Liner]] = DagArmor\n|-\n|{{Nihongo|J\u016bren Gattai|\u91cd\u9023\u5408\u4f53|extra=Coupling Combine}}|| DagTurbo + DagArmor + DagWing = Liner Dagwon\n|-\n|{{Nihongo|Ch\u014d J\u016bren Gattai|\u8d85\u91cd\u9023\u5408\u4f53|extra=Super Coupling Combine}}|| DagTurbo + DagArmor + DagWing + DagDrill = Super Liner Dagwon\n|}\n\n==={{Nihongo|Yoku Kazamatsuri|\u98a8\u796d \u7ffc|Kazamatsuri Yoku}}===\nVoiced by [[Hiro Y\u016bki]]\n\nThe [[sky]] warrior.

Calm, mysterious and a puzzle even to his team members. He's the only one to have \"subordinates\", animal robots stored in the form of cards. He was the last of the team to achieve his mecha fusion. Ryu develops a close friendship with En in the beginning of the series. Ryu is one of two members of the team who doesn\u2019t get an upgrade combination. Ryu\u2019s Vehicle is the Shadow Jet, based on a F-15 Eagle. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|Try Dagwon|| Ryu = Shadow Ryu\n|-\n|Y\u016bg\u014d Gattai|| Shadow Ryu + [[F-15 Eagle|Shadow Jet]] = DagShadow/Shadow Dragon\n|-\n|{{Nihongo|Kij\u016b Gattai|\u6a5f\u7363\u5408\u4f53|extra=Mecha-beast Combine}}|| DagShadow/Shadow Dragon + Guard Tiger + Guard Wolf + Guard Hawk = Shadow Dagwon\n|}\n\n==={{Nihongo|Geki Kuroiwa|\u9ed2\u5ca9 \u6fc0|Kuroiwa Geki}}===\nVoiced by [[Hisao Egawa]]\n\nThe [[Earth's surface|ground]] warrior. Geki has a rivalry with En, who injured his arm in a fight at Geki's old school. He is even more short tempered and impatient than En and has a serious crush on Maria. Geki had something of a misguided view on being a hero at first, but eventually became a valuable member of the group. His robot, Dag Drill combines with Kai's, Shin's and Yoku's. Geki\u2019s vehicle is Drill Liner, based on a JRN Class C62 Steam engine.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|Try Dagwon|| Geki = Drill Geki\n|-\n|Y\u016bg\u014d Gattai|| Drill Geki + [[C62 steam locomotive|Drill Liner]] = DagDrill\n|-\n|{{Nihongo|Ch\u014d J\u016bren Gattai|\u8d85\u91cd\u9023\u5408\u4f53|extra=Super Coupling Combine}}|| DagTurbo + DagArmor + DagWing + DagDrill = Super Liner Dagwon\n|}\n\n==={{Nihongo|Rai Utsumi|\u5b87\u6d25\u7f8e \u96f7|Utsumi Rai}}===\nVoiced by [[Kappei Yamaguchi]]\n\nThe [[thunder]] warrior. An alien Dagwon officer, Rai appears late in the series. He is very good looking, which earns him the unwanted advances of practically every female student at the boys' school. Rai hates the attention and gets embarrassed and flustered by it easily. Like En, his robot, DagThunder is a stand-alone mecha and does not combine with the others. Thunder Dagwon is based on Galaxy Shuttle from [[Transformers: Victory]]. Like Ryu, Rai doesn\u2019t combine with any other mechs to achieve an upgrade.Rai\u2019s vehicle\u2019s are the Thunder Bike, based on a Sidecar Motorcycle.
