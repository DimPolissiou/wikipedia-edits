''Democracy'' introduced acoustic guitar to several songs and featured more explicitly political lyrics. The title track was released as a single and made the UK Top 40. Much of ''Pandemonium'' and all of ''Democracy'' featured session drummer Geoff Dugmore, who also played live with the band during this era.

The songs were all credited to Coleman/Walker/Youth/Gill, although Raven's name is also on the list of musicians on the liner notes, marking his return to the band after more than a decade. The album was accompanied by a tour of the United States, Europe and Australia in 2003-2004, with ex-Prong drummer [[Ted Parsons]] on board.\n\nIn February 2005, now with young drummer Ben Calvert (Twin Zero, [[Sack Trick]]), Killing Joke played two consecutive shows at London's [[Shepherds Bush Empire]] to commemorate their 25th anniversary. [[DVD]] and CD recordings from these concerts were released in the fall of the same year as ''XXV Gathering: The Band that Preys Together Stays Together''. In June, remastered and expanded editions of ''Pandemonium'' and ''Democracy'', were released by [[Cooking Vinyl]]. These were followed in July by remasters of their first four albums (''Killing Joke'' to ''Ha!'') on [[EMI]], who by then owned the E.G. Records catalogue. The second batch of EMI remasters would not appear until January 2008. That year, Reza Udhin joined the band on keyboards when they supported [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]'s British tour; they then began work on their next album in [[Prague]]. Killing Joke's contribution to the world of rock was recognised when they were awarded the \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" at the 2005 ''[[Kerrang]]'' Awards.<ref>Smith, Alexander.

He's in the trench, he knows his life is gone and that within the next ten minutes he's gonna be dead ... and then suddenly he realises that some cunt back in Westminster's got him sussed - 'What am I doing this for?

Former [[The Smiths|Smiths]] member [[Andy Rourke]] was hired, then dismissed after only three days. Eventually the band settled on Welsh bass player Dave \"Taif\" Ball, and played their first gigs in almost two years in December 1988.<ref>{{cite web| url        = http://www.taif.co.uk/taifbass/index.cfm?page=biog&more=6| title      = taif-bass: Killing Joke| accessdate = 15 December 2008| format     = CFM| publisher  = taif.co.uk}}</ref> Touring continued across the UK, Europe and the US until August 1989, when the band took a break to record new material in Germany and allow Coleman time to record ''[[Songs from the Victorious City]]'' with [[Anne Dudley]] of [[Art of Noise]].\n\nFor reasons which remain unclear, the German sessions were shelved and bass player Taif left the band. He was replaced by former member Paul Raven and the revised line-up began recording again, this time in London. The result was Killing Joke's eighth album, ''[[Extremities, Dirt & Various Repressed Emotions]]'', released on the German [[Noise Records (Germany)|Noise International]] label in 1990. It marked a return to a heavier, industrial sound.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/mar/19/old-music-killing-joke-age-greed|title=Old music: Killing Joke \u2013 Age of Greed|first=Martin|last=Belam|date=19 March 2012|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/extremities-dirt-and-various-repressed-emotions-mw0000311317|title=Extremities, Dirt and Various Repressed Emotions - Killing Joke &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref> \"[[Money Is Not Our God]]\" was the lead single. The band toured Europe and North America until unexpectedly disbanding again in mid-1991. Coleman emigrated to New Zealand to live on a remote Pacific island, and Killing Joke entered a hiatus.\n\nAtkins continued with Walker, Raven and the band's live keyboard player, [[John Bechdel]], as the short-lived [[Murder, Inc. (band)|Murder, Inc.]], recruiting Scottish vocalist [[Chris Connelly (musician)|Chris Connelly]] and reuniting with Ferguson as second drummer.\n\n===Return of Youth (1992\u20131996)===\n[[File:Killing Joke-1994-Nottingham.jpg|thumb|Youth and Coleman (1994)]]\nA Killing Joke anthology, ''Laugh? I Nearly Bought One!'', was released in 1992; during its production, Walker became reacquainted with Youth, who suggested that they reform the band with himself back on bass. That same year, two singles (on cassette and CD) appeared featuring the early songs \"Change\" and \"Wardance\" remixed by Youth, who was by then a successful producer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/youth-killing-joke-paul-mccartney|title=Youth: From Killing Joke to Paul McCartney|website=Soundonsound.com}}</ref>\n\n''[[Pandemonium (Killing Joke album)|Pandemonium]]'' was released in 1994 on Youth's [[Butterfly Recordings]] label, featuring a heavy and diverse new style. [[Tom Larkin]], of New Zealand band [[Shihad]],  performed drums on the album. Coleman had earlier produced Shihad's 1993 debut album, but relations later soured due to a dispute over Coleman's producer's fee. ''Pandemonium'' also featured several Egyptian musicians that Coleman had previously worked with on ''Songs from the Victorious City'', including percussionist [[Hossam Ramzy]] and violinist Aboud Abdel Al.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/pandemonium-mw0000119138|title=Pandemonium - Killing Joke &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/|title=Kerrang!|website=Kerrang!}}</ref>, and earned Killing Joke a memorable ''Top of the Pops'' appearance for the single \"Millennium\", which was a UK Top 40 hit (the album itself made the Top 20). The title track was also released as a single and made the UK Top 30. The album itself became Killing Joke's best-selling work.<ref>Coleman, Jaz (2013). ''Letters from Cythera'', p. 378. Self-published.</ref>\n\nIn 1995, the band recorded the song \"Hollywood Babylon\" for the soundtrack of [[Paul Verhoeven]]'s movie ''[[Showgirls]]''.\n\nA follow-up album, ''[[Democracy (album)|Democracy]]'', was released in 1996 and also produced by Youth. ''Democracy'' introduced acoustic guitar to several songs and featured more explicitly political lyrics. The title track was released as a single and made the UK Top 40. Much of ''Pandemonium'' and all of ''Democracy'' featured session drummer Geoff Dugmore, who also played live with the band during this era. [[Nick Holywell-Walker]] joined the band on keyboards and programming for 11 years from 1994 to 2005, notably on ''Democracy'' and ''XXV Gathering''. Youth bowed out of live performance early in the ''Democracy'' tour and was replaced by [[Troy Gregory]], previously of [[Prong (band)|Prong]].<ref name=\"Hightower-Volume_30\" />\n\nAfter the ''Democracy'' tour, the band went on their longest hiatus to date. Coleman and Youth produced a string of orchestral rock albums based on the music of [[classic rock]] artists such as Led Zeppelin, [[Pink Floyd]] and [[the Doors]]. Coleman became [[Artist-in-residence|Composer in Residence]] for New Zealand and Czech [[symphony orchestra]]s,<ref name=\"decibelmagazine.com-Killing_Joke\">{{cite web|url=http://decibelmagazine.com/features/jul2007/killingjoke.aspx |title=Killing Joke |accessdate=7 January 2007 |last=Bennett |first=J. |format=ASPX |publisher=Decibel Magazine|quote=Coleman is a Composer in Residence to the Prague Symphony Orchestra, the nation of New Zealand and, as of October 2006, the entire European Union.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016193752/http://decibelmagazine.com/features/jul2007/killingjoke.aspx |archivedate=16 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and made his acting debut with the main role in the film ''Rok \u010f\u00e1bla'' (''Year of the Devil'') by Czech filmmaker [[Petr Zelenka]].\n\n===Reformation and the death of Paul Raven (2002\u20132007)===\nIn 2002, Coleman, Walker and Youth recorded their [[Killing Joke 2003 (album)|second self-titled album]] with special guest [[Dave Grohl]] on drums.

The [[War on Terror]] and the [[invasion of Iraq]] were cited as major factors in their reforming, reflected in the lyrical content of much of the album, based on themes of war, government control and [[Armageddon]]. The album, which fell just short of the UK Top 40 and spawned two singles, \"Loose Cannon\" (a UK Top 25 hit) and \"Seeing Red\". The songs were all credited to Coleman/Walker/Youth/Gill, although Raven's name is also on the list of musicians on the liner notes, marking his return to the band after more than a decade. The album was accompanied by a tour of the United States, Europe and Australia in 2003-2004, with ex-Prong drummer [[Ted Parsons]] on board.\n\nIn February 2005, now with young drummer Ben Calvert (Twin Zero, [[Sack Trick]]), Killing Joke played two consecutive shows at London's [[Shepherds Bush Empire]] to commemorate their 25th anniversary. [[DVD]] and CD recordings from these concerts were released in the fall of the same year as ''XXV Gathering: The Band that Preys Together Stays Together''. In June, remastered and expanded editions of ''Pandemonium'' and ''Democracy'', were released by [[Cooking Vinyl]]. These were followed in July by remasters of their first four albums (''Killing Joke'' to ''Ha!'') on [[EMI]], who by then owned the E.G. Records catalogue. The second batch of EMI remasters would not appear until January 2008. That year, Reza Udhin joined the band on keyboards when they supported [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]'s British tour; they then began work on their next album in [[Prague]]. Killing Joke's contribution to the world of rock was recognised when they were awarded the \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" at the 2005 ''[[Kerrang]]'' Awards.<ref>Smith, Alexander.

Its capital is [[Asadabad, Afghanistan|Asadabad]]. It has a population of about 428,800.<ref name=\"cso\"/>\n\nIt is one of the four \"[[N2KL]]\" provinces ([[Nangarhar Province]], [[Nuristan Province]], Kunar Province and [[Laghman Province]]). N2KL is the designation used by the US and Coalition Forces in Afghanistan for the rugged and very violent region along the [[Durand Line]] border opposite Pakistan's [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. Kunar is the center of the N2KL region. Kunar is the birthplace of [[Sayyed Jamaluddin Afghani]] (al-Afghani), an influential Muslim scholar and philosopher.\n\n==Geography==\n{{Further|Geography of Afghanistan}}\n[[File:Korengal Valley-2009.jpg|thumb|left|View of the [[Korangal Valley]]]]\nKunar province is located in the northeast of Afghanistan. It borders with [[Nangarhar Province]] to the south, [[Nuristan Province]] to the north, [[Laghman Province]] to the west and has a border with Pakistan in the east. The province covers an area of 4339&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Nearly nine tenths (86%) of the province is mountainous or semi mountainous terrain while one eighth (12%) of the area is made up of relatively flat land.  The primary geographic features of the province are (1) the lower [[Hindu Kush]] mountains which are cut by the [[Kunar River]] to form the [[Kunar Valley]]. The river flows south and southwest from its source in the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] area and is part of the [[Indus River]] watershed via the [[Kabul River]] which it meets at Jalalabad. The Kunar is a primary draining conduit for the Hindu Kush basin and several tributaries, including the [[Pech River|Pech]], which form distinct and significant valleys in the area. The mountains, narrow valleys with steep walls, and rivers present formidable natural obstacles and have historically constrained all movement through the province.  Even in the early 21st century, movement on foot, with pack animals, or with motorized vehicles is extremely limited and channeled due to the significant geographic restrictions.\n\n==History==\n{{Further|History of Afghanistan}}\n{{History of Afghanistan}}\n\n===Early history===\nThe region has been part of many empires in the past, from the [[Seleucid Empire]]  to the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]]. Many famous historical figures are believed to have visited the area, including [[Alexander the Great]], [[Mahmud Ghaznavi]], [[Xuanzang]], [[Ibn Battuta]], and others.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Archaeologists have dated to AD 800-1000 a fortification system overlooking a Muslim cemetery at Chaga Serai (near the Pech-Kunar confluence).<ref>[http://www.cemml.colostate.edu/cultural/09476/afgh05-032.html Cultural Property Training Resource, Afghanistan Significant Site 32] US DoD Central Command, from Colorado State, citing  Source: Warwick Ball, ''Archaeological Gazetteer of Afghanistan'', 1982, n. 154</ref>\n\n[[Babur]] wrote about Kunar in ''[[Baburnama]]''. He claimed that there was a shrine in Kunar of a preacher and poet [[Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani]], who is said to have died there in 1384 AD (786 AH). He also describes agricultural products: citron, oranges, coriander, orchards, strong yellow wines, and a burial custom wherein a woman whose corpse moved was considered to have done good things in life. He mentions [[Chaghan-Sarai]] as a small town, and describes the towns folk as Muslims who mixed with the [[Kafir]]s of nearby [[Kafiristan]] and followed some of their customs. He also claims to have later captured the town, even as the Pech river Kafirs tried to help the Chaghan Sarai residents repel his attack.<ref>''Baburnama'', translated by Annette Susannah Beveridge, 1922, 1979, from [https://archive.org/details/baburnama017152mbp] at archive.org</ref>\n\nWalter Hamilton's writing in 1828 mentions that the [[padishah]] of Cooner was joined in alliance with the neighboring [[Nuristanis|Kafirs (non Muslims) of Nuristan]] in battles against Muslim invaders.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/eastindiangazet00hamigoog ''The East Indian gazetteer: containing particular descriptions of . . .

Hekmatyar was victorious and eventually his troops sacked [[Asadabad, Afghanistan|Asadabad]].<ref name=ctc1/> By 1996 however, [[Mullah Omar]]'s [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban]] had invaded Kunar and driven out Hekmatyar.<ref name=ctc1/>\n\n=== 21st century ===\n{{Further|International Security Assistance Force|Presidency of Hamid Karzai}}\n[[File:US soldiers with cows in Kunar Province of Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|US soldiers near FOB (Forward Operating Base) [[Nari district|Naray]].]]\n\nAfter the [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001, Afghanistan was invaded by United States and other NATO countries provided direct support to the Northern Alliance forces fighting the Taliban regime, which was quickly toppled and fled to remote areas. It was part of the [[War on Terror]] and to assist the new [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|government]] that was led by [[Hamid Karzai]].\n\nDuring the 19th century British military expeditions, the 1980s Soviet occupation, and the latest conflict, Kunar has been a favoured spot of [[Taliban insurgency|insurgent groups]]. Its impenetrable terrain, cave networks and border with the semi-autonomous Pakistani Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provides significant advantages for unconventional warfare and militant groups. The province is informally known as \"Enemy Central\" and \"Indian Country\" by Western armed forces serving in Afghanistan. Between January 2006 and March 2010 more than 65% of all insurgent incidents in Afghanistan occurred in Kunar province.\n\nLike many of the mountainous eastern provinces of Afghanistan, the groups involved in armed conflict vary greatly in strength and purpose.

It borders with [[Nangarhar Province]] to the south, [[Nuristan Province]] to the north, [[Laghman Province]] to the west and has a border with Pakistan in the east. The province covers an area of 4339&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Nearly nine tenths (86%) of the province is mountainous or semi mountainous terrain while one eighth (12%) of the area is made up of relatively flat land.  The primary geographic features of the province are (1) the lower [[Hindu Kush]] mountains which are cut by the [[Kunar River]] to form the [[Kunar Valley]]. The river flows south and southwest from its source in the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] area and is part of the [[Indus River]] watershed via the [[Kabul River]] which it meets at Jalalabad. The Kunar is a primary draining conduit for the Hindu Kush basin and several tributaries, including the [[Pech River|Pech]], which form distinct and significant valleys in the area. The mountains, narrow valleys with steep walls, and rivers present formidable natural obstacles and have historically constrained all movement through the province.  Even in the early 21st century, movement on foot, with pack animals, or with motorized vehicles is extremely limited and channeled due to the significant geographic restrictions.\n\n==History==\n{{Further|History of Afghanistan}}\n{{History of Afghanistan}}\n\n===Early history===\nThe region has been part of many empires in the past, from the [[Seleucid Empire]]  to the latest Afghan [[Durrani Empire]].

She and her ex-husband, Mangal, were a popular musical duo who dominated the Afghan music scene during the 1980s and early 1990s. Naghma sings mostly in [[Pashto language|Pashto]] but has also recorded in the [[Dari Persian]] language. Her music is popular in [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]] and among [[Pashtuns]] in [[Pakistan]]. She is considered to be the greatest female artist in Afghanistan and continues to be the voice and face of [[List of Pashto-language singers|Pashtun traditional music]].\n\n==Early years==\n\nNaghma was born as Shaperai (Pashto: \u069a\u0627\u067e\u06d0\u0631\u06cd meaning Head Fairy) on 1 January 1964, in Afghanistan. The city of her birth cannot be verified. She was the eldest daughter in a family of five boys and three girls. Her father's name was Syed Suleiman Shah and her mother is Bibi Mashala. Her father died when Naghma was five years old. As a young girl, she developed an interest in music. At sixteen she moved to [[Kabul]] with her paternal uncle. She continued her secondary education at [[List of schools in Kabul|Rabia Balkhi Lece]] where she was performing in the girl's band as a vocalist. A year before finishing her high school she married Mangal, an already popular Pashto singer from [[Laghman Province]], and consequently left school to advance her musical career. They were instant celebrities, recording hits that are famous to this day.\n\nHer early songs were based on southern Afghan music, most of which were folkloric in nature. Coming from a traditional family, she met with much resistance from relatives who saw singing as taboo for Afghan woman. Naghma has often stated in interviews that till today her mother is still not happy with her career choice. However, Naghma was not discouraged by this. In Mangal she found a supporting husband and as duo the pressure from society was much more bearable as opposed to being solo. \n\nWith impending civil war, the couple left Afghanistan for [[India]] in 1992. Eventually they settled in [[Islamabad]], Pakistan. There, they became very successful with an enthusiastic crowd of Afghan exiles who were nostalgic for their native music. Their financial situation by this time had improved significantly. In 2000, they left Pakistan and immigrated to the [[United States]].\n\n==Personal life==\n\nAfter establishing contact with the [[Afghan Americans|Afghan community]] of [[Northern California]], the duo held a series of performances. In 2006, after years of ups and downs in their marriage, the couple divorced. Though no specific reasons have been shared by the couple, some believe Mangal's alleged alcohol abuse was the reason for why the marriage dissolved. The couples have held a dignified silence about their divorce and never mention anything relating to it in public. Their divorce has also cast a doubt as to whether this former pair can reconcile at least on a professional level. While Mangal performs solo in private events and television programs, Naghma is continuing her career as a professional artist.\n\nNaghma remarried after her divorce and mentioned that he is from [[Logar Province]]. \n\nNaghma's daughter married Afghan singer Safiq Mureed, in a private ceremony in 2014. Naghma's main home and her children are in California but she has also made a place for herself in Kabul and Islamabad.\n\nIn March 2014, she became the first Afghan to receive the [[Tamgha-e-Imtiaz]] and the [[Pride of Performance]], the highest Pakistani Presidential Awards handed to artists, sportsmen, scientists, and writers. It was a proud moment for Naghma who has always been a strong voice for the Afghan refugees in Pakistan. Naghma encourages Afghan refugees to try and go back to Afghanistan through her aid work and music to rebuild the country.\n\n==Discography==\nShe has recorded over 500 songs in a period of 32 years in Afghanistan, Pakistan and also in the United States.\n''This list is incomplete''\n\nAlbum: Bachi Hamsaya\n\n* '' Bachi Hamsaya ''\n* '' Aros ''\n* '' O Bacha ''\n* '' Maida Maida ''\n* '' Nazi Jan ''\n* '' Ba Yin Sazi Mahali ''\n* '' Ghataghani ''\n* '' Shekesta Chelamey''\n* '' Imroz ''\n* '' Tu Ra Meparastam ''\n* '' O Dilbar Janim ''\n* '' O Bacha ''\n* '' Jama Narinje ''\n\nAlbum: Best Of Naghma\n\n* '' Charsi Halika Stargi ''\n* '' Janana ke Pashton ''\n* '' Halka Daroghjan Mee ''\n* '' Raghlay Yama Damor ''\n* '' Za Ba Gidi Rawdim ''\n* '' Chita Che Zi Mat ''\n* '' Raza Da Zandgi Sra ''\n* '' Yara Rana Wrak Nashi ''\n* '' Janana Rasha Da Shamali ''\n* '' Hagha Sra Oshan ''\n* '' Allah Wi Zamazda ''\n\nAlbum: Kabul Nazaneen\n\n* '' Salam Afghanistan ''\n* '' Delbar Jan ''\n* '' Ghataghani ''\n* '' Yaram Nest ''\n* '' Darbigeri ''\n* '' O Dilbar Janam ''\n* '' Nazi Jan ''\n* '' O Bachi Afghan ''\n* '' Maida Maida Baran ''\n* '' Em Roz Che Roz Ast ''\n\nAlbum: O Khoda Jan\n\n* '' Az America Wa Alman ''\n* '' O Khuda Jan ''\n* '' Sharshara Baran ''\n* '' Shab Amadam ''\n* '' Bebe Roko Jan ''\n* '' Kashki Ma ''\n* '' Man Dokhtari Sherazam ''\n* '' Mara Az Ashiqi Bas ''\n* '' Mohabat ''\n* '' Pesta Forosh ''\n\nPopular Singles:\n\n* '' Mazdigar De Ka Nade ''\n* '' O Bacha Jane Bacha ''\n* '' Lalaya Hawa Baza ''\n* '' Kandahar Halika ''\n* '' Adam Khana Charsi ''\n* '' Mohabbat ''\n* '' Mohabbat (Slow Version) ''\n* '' Lalo Lalo ''\n* '' Mala Chal Ne Razi ''\n* '' Akh Janan Me Laro ''\n* '' Zma Afghanistana''\n* '' Loya Khudaya ''\n* '' Orbal Chapa Kra Bya Rasta ''\n* '' Akhshe na ni na (Attan De Gada Da)''\n* '' Mubarak Di Sha Akhtar ''\n* '' Lalai de ''\n* '' Dilbar Zalim Zalim ''\n* '' Wa Grana ''\n* '' Nor e Newranawo ''\n* '' Ay Da Watan Da Abay Roka Zoya ''\n* '' Afghani Mashoma ''\n\n;Contributing artist\n* ''[[The Rough Guide To The Music Of Afghanistan]]'', 2010\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* Afghanistan Online.
