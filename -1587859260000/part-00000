These two murders are commonly referred to as the \"double event\".<ref name=\"Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 114\u2013140\">Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 114\u2013140</ref>\n\nPart of a left kidney was later sent to the leader of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] accompanied by a letter addressed [[From Hell letter|From Hell]]. The author of this letter claimed the section of kidney was from Eddowes, whose left kidney had been removed. Most experts, however, do not believe this kidney was actually the one taken from Eddowes's body.\n\n== Early life ==\nCatherine Eddowes (also known as \"Kate Conway\" and \"Kate Kelly\" after her two successive [[Common-law marriage|common-law husbands]]) was born in Graiseley Green, [[Wolverhampton]] on 14 April 1842. Her parents were [[tinplate]] worker George Eddowes and his wife, Catherine (''[[n\u00e9e]]'' Evans). The family moved to London a year after her birth, and her mother ultimately bore 10 other children.\n\nBy 1857, both of Eddowes's parents had died,<ref>''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'' {{ISBN|978-1-405-80712-8}} p. 211</ref> resulting in Eddowes being admitted as an orphan to a [[Bermondsey]] [[Workhouse]].<ref>''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'' {{ISBN|978-1-317-86633-6}} p. 235</ref> She later returned to Wolverhampton where an aunt obtained employment for her as a tinplate stamper at the Old Hall Works. Eddowes was soon fired from this employment, possibly due to her having been caught stealing. She is known to have relocated from Wolverhampton to [[Birmingham]], where she briefly lived with an uncle. Eddowes worked as a tray polisher in Birmingham for four months before returning to Wolverhampton. Nine months later, she again relocated to Birmingham.<ref>''Jack the Ripper: The Facts'' {{ISBN|978-0-760-77121-1}} p. 165</ref>\n\nWhile residing in Birmingham, she began a relationship with a former soldier named Thomas Conway, with whom she had two children.<ref>''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'' {{ISBN|978-1-317-86633-6}} p. 235</ref> At one stage in this relationship, Eddowes had a tattoo of the initials of her common-law husband (\"TC\") inscribed in blue ink upon her left forearm.<ref name=\"Casebook: Jack The Ripper\">Casebook: Jack The Ripper</ref>\n\nEddowes was five feet tall, with dark auburn hair and hazel eyes. Friends would later describe her as \"a very jolly woman, always singing\"<ref>Inquest testimony of lodging-house deputy Frederick William Wilkinson, quoted in Evans and Skinner, p. 218 and Marriott, p. 136</ref> and an \"intelligent and scholarly (individual), but possessed of a fierce temper.\"<ref name=\"Casebook: Jack The Ripper\"/>\n\n===Relocation to London===\nIn 1868, Eddowes and Conway relocated to London, taking lodgings in [[Westminster]]. A third child was born.<ref>''Naming Jack the Ripper: New Crime Scene Evidence, A Stunning Forensic Breakthrough'' {{ISBN|978-1-447-26423-1}} p. 60</ref>\n\nWhile in London, Eddowes took to drinking. She left her family in 1880. By the following year, she was living with a new partner named John Kelly at Cooney's [[common lodging-house]] at 55 [[Flower and Dean Street]], [[Spitalfields]], at the centre of London's most notorious criminal [[Rookery (slum)|rookery]]. Here she took to casual [[prostitution|sex work]] to pay the rent.<ref>Begg (2006), pp. 166\u2013167; White, pp. 323\u2013349</ref> To avoid contact with his former partner, Conway drew his army pension under the assumed name of Quinn, and kept their sons' addresses secret from her.<ref>Fido, p. 67</ref>\n\n==1888==\nIn the summer of 1888, Eddowes, Kelly, and a friend named Emily Birrell took casual work [[hop-picking]] in [[Kent]]. At harvest's end they returned to London and quickly spent their pay. Eddowes and Kelly split their last sixpence between them; he took fourpence to pay for a bed in the common lodging-house, and she took twopence, just enough for her to stay a night at [[Mile End]] Casual Ward in the neighbouring parish.<ref>Fido, p. 68</ref>\n\n===29 September===\nThey met up the following morning, 29 September, and in the early afternoon Eddowes told Kelly she would go to [[Bermondsey]] to try to get some money from her daughter, Annie Phillips,<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 114</ref> who was married to a gun-maker in [[Southwark]].<ref>Evans and Skinner, p. 197; Fido, p. 67</ref> With money from pawning his boots, a bare-footed Kelly took a bed at the lodging-house just after 8:00&nbsp;p.m., and according to the deputy keeper remained there all night.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\nAt 8:30&nbsp;p.m. on Saturday, 29 September, Eddowes was found lying drunk in the road on [[Aldgate|Aldgate High Street]] by [[Police constable|PC]] Louis Robinson. She was taken into custody and then to [[Bishopsgate]] police station, where she was detained, giving the name \"Nothing\", until she was sober enough to leave at 1:00&nbsp;a.m. on the morning of 30 September.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 115; Evans and Skinner, pp. 209\u2013210; Fido, p. 43</ref>\n[[File:Mitre Square Corner.jpg|220px|thumb|[[Mitre Square]]. The body of Catherine Eddowes was discovered close to the fence seen at the centre of this image on 30 September 1888]]\n\n===30 September===\nPrior to her release, Eddowes gave her name and address as \"Mary Ann Kelly of 6 Fashion Street\".<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 116; Evans and Skinner, pp. 195, 210</ref>\n\nUpon leaving the station, instead of turning right to take the shortest route to her home in Flower and Dean Street, Eddowes turned left in the general direction of [[Aldgate]].<ref>Evans and Skinner, p. 195; Fido, p. 43</ref> She was last seen alive at 1:35&nbsp;a.m. by three witnesses, [[Joseph Lawende]], Joseph Hyam Levy and Harry Harris, who themselves had just left a club on Duke Street. She was standing talking with a man at the entrance to Church Passage, which led south-west from Duke Street to [[Mitre Square]] along the south wall of the [[Great Synagogue of London]]. Only Lawende could furnish a description of the man, whom he described as a fair-moustached man wearing a navy jacket, peaked cloth cap, and red scarf.<ref>Fido, pp. 43\u201345</ref> Chief Inspector [[Donald Swanson]] intimated in his report that Lawende's identification of the woman as Eddowes was doubtful. He wrote that Lawende had said that some clothing of the deceased's that he was shown resembled that of the woman he saw<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 122</ref>\u2014\"which was black&nbsp;... that was the extent of his identity [sic]\".<ref>Evans and Skinner, p. 185</ref> A patrolling policeman, PC James Harvey, walked down Church Passage from Duke Street very shortly afterwards but his beat took him back down Church Passage to Duke Street, without entering the square.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 120; Fido, p. 44</ref>\n\n==Murder==\nAt 1:45&nbsp;a.m., Eddowes's mutilated body was found in the south-west corner of Mitre Square by the square's beat policeman PC Edward Watkins.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 117; Fido, p. 45</ref>{{refn|group=n|Watkins was to later testify at the formal [[inquest]] into Eddowes's death that his initial impression upon viewing her body was that it had been \"cut up like a pig in the market\".<ref>''Foul Deeds and Suspicious Deaths in London's East End'' {{ISBN|978-1-939-43000-7}} p. 88</ref>}} Watkins was to state that he entered the square at 1:44&nbsp;a.m. having previously been there at 1:30&nbsp;a.m. He called for assistance at a tea warehouse in the square, where night watchman George James Morris, who was an ex-policeman, had noticed nothing unusual.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 120; Evans and Skinner, p. 211; Fido, p. 45</ref> Neither had another watchman (George Clapp) at 5 Mitre Square or an off-duty policeman (Richard Pearse) at 3 Mitre Square.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 122; Evans and Skinner, p. 212; Fido, p. 45</ref>\n[[File:Catherine Eddowes123.jpg|150px|thumb|Eddowes's body, photographed prior to her [[post-mortem]] at the Golden Lane mortuary<ref>''Jack the Ripper: An Encyclopedia'' {{ISBN|978-1-844-54982-5}} p. 52</ref>]]\n\n==Post-mortem==\nThe subsequent [[Autopsy|post-mortem]] records of police surgeon Dr. Frederick Gordon Brown\u2014who arrived at the crime scene after 2:00&nbsp;a.m.\u2014state:\n\n{{Quote|The body was on its back, the head turned to left shoulder.

The mutilation of Eddowes's body and the abstraction of her left kidney and part of her womb by her murderer bore the signature of [[Jack the Ripper]] and was very similar in nature to that of earlier victim [[Annie Chapman]].<ref name=\"Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 114\u2013140\"/>\n\nDue to the location of Mitre Square, the [[City of London Police]] under Detective Inspector James McWilliam joined the murder enquiry alongside the [[Metropolitan Police]] who had been engaged in the previous murders. At about 3 a.m. on the same day as Eddowes was murdered, a blood-stained fragment of her apron contaminated with fecal matter was found lying in the passage of the doorway leading to Flats 108 and 119, Model Dwellings, Goulston Street, Whitechapel. Above it on the wall was a [[Goulston Street graffito|graffito in chalk]] commonly held to have read: \"The Juwes are the men that Will not be Blamed for nothing\".<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 132; Fido, pp. 47\u201349</ref> The writing may or may not have been related to the murder, but either way it was washed away before dawn on the orders of Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir [[Charles Warren]], who feared that it would spark anti-Jewish riots.<ref>Letter from Charles Warren to the Home Office Undersecretary of State, 6 November 1888, quoted in Begg (2003), p. 197; Evans and Skinner, pp. 183\u2013184 and Marriott, p. 159</ref> Mitre Square had three connecting streets: Church Passage to the north-east, Mitre Street to the south-west, and St James's Place to the north-west. As PC Harvey saw no-one from Church Passage, and PC Watkins saw no-one from Mitre Street, the murderer must have left the square northwards through St James's Place towards Goulston Street.<ref>Fido, p. 77; Marriott, p. 127</ref> Goulston Street was within a quarter of an hour's walk from Mitre Square, on a direct route to Flower and Dean Street where Eddowes lived, hinting that her murderer also resided nearby and headed back there after the killing.<ref>Inquest testimony of surveyor Frederick William Foster, quoted in Evans and Skinner, pp. 201\u2013202, 220 and Fido, p. 76</ref>\n\nMajor Henry Smith, acting Commissioner of the City Police, claimed in his memoirs to have discovered bloodied water in a public sink in a court off Dorset Street, and as the water was slowly running out of the basin, he calculated that the Ripper had been there only moments before. Ripper author [[Martin Fido]] thought it unlikely that the culprit would wait to wash his hands in a semi-public place about forty minutes after the crime, and Smith's memoirs are both unreliable and embellished for dramatic effect.<ref>Fido, pp. 50, 120</ref> There is no mention of the sink in the official police reports.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 133</ref>\n[[File:FromHellLetter.jpg|150px|thumb|alt=Scrawled and misspelled note reading: From hell\u2014Mr Lusk\u2014Sir I send you half the kidne I took from one woman prasarved it for you tother piece I fried and ate it was very nise I may send you the bloody knif that took it out if you only wate a whil longer\u2014Signed Catch me when you can Mishter Lusk|The [[From Hell letter|\"From Hell\"]] letter, received by [[George Lusk]] of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] on 16 October 1888]]\n==Correspondence==\n{{main article|From Hell letter}}\nOn 1 October, [[Saucy Jacky postcard|a postcard, dubbed the \"Saucy Jacky\" postcard]] and signed \"Jack the Ripper\", was received by the [[Central News Agency (London)|Central News Agency]].

The note has become known as the \"Lusk letter\" or the [[From Hell (letter)|\"From hell\" letter]], because of a phrase \"from hell\" used by the writer, who claimed to have \"fried and ate\" the missing kidney half.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 167\u2013168</ref> The handwriting and style were unlike that of the \"Saucy Jacky\" postcard. The kidney was taken to Dr [[Thomas Horrocks Openshaw]] at the nearby [[Royal London Hospital|London Hospital]]. He believed that the kidney was human, from the left side, and preserved in spirit.<ref>Fido, p. 78</ref> The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' reported on 19 October that he said it was a recent \"ginny kidney\" from a 45-year-old female, but in the ''[[The Star (London)|Star]]'' newspaper the same day Openshaw denied the report strongly, saying it was impossible to detect the age or gender of the individual whom the kidney had belonged to,<ref>Cook, p. 146; Fido, p. 78</ref> or how long it had been preserved in spirits. Major Smith claimed in his memoirs that the sent kidney matched the one missing from Eddowes, because the length of renal artery attached to the kidney matched the missing length from the body, and both the body and kidney showed signs of [[Bright's disease]]. Smith's later recollection does not match the medical reports submitted by the examining pathologists or the police records.<ref>Cook, pp. 147\u2013148; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 168; Fido, pp. 78\u201379</ref> Police surgeon Dr Brown said that the kidney had been trimmed up, and that the renal artery was entirely absent.<ref>Cook, p. 148; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 168; Evans and Skinner, p. 189</ref> Metropolitan police memos state that the kidney could have come from any body, such as those found in a hospital morgue.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 168; Evans and Skinner, p. 187; Fido, pp. 78\u201379</ref> Smith's story is thought by historians to be dramatic licence on his part, and the kidney could have been a medical student's prank.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 168; Fido, pp. 78\u201379</ref> Dr Saunders, who attended the post-mortem, told the press, \"the right kidney of the woman Eddowes was perfectly normal in its structure and healthy&nbsp;... my opinion is that it was a student's antic.\"<ref>''Manchester Evening News'', 19 October 1888, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 168; ''Evening News'', 20 October 1888, quoted in Fido, pp. 79\u201380</ref> Chief Inspector [[Donald Swanson]], who co-ordinated the inquiry, wrote: \"similar kidneys might and could be obtained from any dead person upon whom a post mortem had been made for any cause, by students or dissecting room porter.\"<ref>Home Office report quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 170 and Fido, p. 79</ref>\n[[File:Catherine Eddowes grave at City of London Cemetery.jpg|160px|thumb|Catherine Eddowes's grave marker at the City of London Cemetery]]\n\n==Funeral and aftermath==\nCatherine Eddowes was buried on Monday, 8 October 1888 in an elm coffin in the [[City of London Cemetery and Crematorium|City of London Cemetery]], in an unmarked (public) grave 49336, square 318.

These two murders are commonly referred to as the \"double event\".<ref name=\"Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 114\u2013140\">Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 114\u2013140</ref>\n\nPart of a left kidney was later sent to the leader of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] accompanied by a letter addressed [[From Hell letter|From Hell]]. The author of this letter claimed the section of kidney was from Eddowes, whose left kidney had been removed. Most experts, however, do not believe this kidney was actually the one taken from Eddowes's body.\n\n== Early life ==\nCatherine Eddowes (also known as \"Kate Conway\" and \"Kate Kelly\" after her two successive [[Common-law marriage|common-law husbands]]) was born in Graiseley Green, [[Wolverhampton]] on 14 April 1842. Her parents were [[tinplate]] worker George Eddowes and his wife, Catherine (''[[n\u00e9e]]'' Evans). The family moved to London a year after her birth, and her mother ultimately bore 10 other children.\n\nBy 1857, both of Eddowes's parents had died,<ref>''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'' {{ISBN|978-1-405-80712-8}} p. 211</ref> resulting in Eddowes being admitted as an orphan to a [[Bermondsey]] [[Workhouse]].<ref>''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'' {{ISBN|978-1-317-86633-6}} p. 235</ref> She later returned to Wolverhampton where an aunt obtained employment for her as a tinplate stamper at the Old Hall Works. Eddowes was soon fired from this employment, possibly due to her having been caught stealing. She is known to have relocated from Wolverhampton to [[Birmingham]], where she briefly lived with an uncle. Eddowes worked as a tray polisher in Birmingham for four months before returning to Wolverhampton. Nine months later, she again relocated to Birmingham.<ref>''Jack the Ripper: The Facts'' {{ISBN|978-0-760-77121-1}} p. 165</ref>\n\nWhile residing in Birmingham, she began a relationship with a former soldier named Thomas Conway, with whom she had two children.<ref>''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'' {{ISBN|978-1-317-86633-6}} p. 235</ref> At one stage in this relationship, Eddowes had a tattoo of the initials of her common-law husband (\"TC\") inscribed in blue ink upon her left forearm.<ref name=\"Casebook: Jack The Ripper\">Casebook: Jack The Ripper</ref>\n\nEddowes was five feet tall, with dark auburn hair and hazel eyes. Friends would later describe her as \"a very jolly woman, always singing\"<ref>Inquest testimony of lodging-house deputy Frederick William Wilkinson, quoted in Evans and Skinner, p. 218 and Marriott, p. 136</ref> and an \"intelligent and scholarly (individual), but possessed of a fierce temper.\"<ref name=\"Casebook: Jack The Ripper\"/>\n\n===Relocation to London===\nIn 1868, Eddowes and Conway relocated to London, taking lodgings in [[Westminster]]. A third child was born.<ref>''Naming Jack the Ripper: New Crime Scene Evidence, A Stunning Forensic Breakthrough'' {{ISBN|978-1-447-26423-1}} p. 60</ref>\n\nWhile in London, Eddowes took to drinking. She left her family in 1880. By the following year, she was living with a new partner named John Kelly at Cooney's [[common lodging-house]] at 55 [[Flower and Dean Street]], [[Spitalfields]], at the centre of London's most notorious criminal [[Rookery (slum)|rookery]]. Here she took to casual [[prostitution|sex work]] to pay the rent.<ref>Begg (2006), pp. 166\u2013167; White, pp. 323\u2013349</ref> To avoid contact with his former partner, Conway drew his army pension under the assumed name of Quinn, and kept their sons' addresses secret from her.<ref>Fido, p. 67</ref>\n\n==1888==\nIn the summer of 1888, Eddowes, Kelly, and a friend named Emily Birrell took casual work [[hop-picking]] in [[Kent]]. At harvest's end they returned to London and quickly spent their pay. Eddowes and Kelly split their last sixpence between them; he took fourpence to pay for a bed in the common lodging-house, and she took twopence, just enough for her to stay a night at [[Mile End]] Casual Ward in the neighbouring parish.<ref>Fido, p. 68</ref>\n\n===29 September===\nThey met up the following morning, 29 September, and in the early afternoon Eddowes told Kelly she would go to [[Bermondsey]] to try to get some money from her daughter, Annie Phillips,<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 114</ref> who was married to a gun-maker in [[Southwark]].<ref>Evans and Skinner, p. 197; Fido, p. 67</ref> With money from pawning his boots, a bare-footed Kelly took a bed at the lodging-house just after 8:00&nbsp;p.m., and according to the deputy keeper remained there all night.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\nAt 8:30&nbsp;p.m. on Saturday, 29 September, Eddowes was found lying drunk in the road on [[Aldgate|Aldgate High Street]] by [[Police constable|PC]] Louis Robinson. She was taken into custody and then to [[Bishopsgate]] police station, where she was detained, giving the name \"Nothing\", until she was sober enough to leave at 1:00&nbsp;a.m. on the morning of 30 September.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 115; Evans and Skinner, pp. 209\u2013210; Fido, p. 43</ref>\n[[File:Mitre Square Corner.jpg|220px|thumb|[[Mitre Square]].

Only Lawende could furnish a description of the man, whom he described as a fair-moustached man wearing a navy jacket, peaked cloth cap, and red scarf.<ref>Fido, pp. 43\u201345</ref> Chief Inspector [[Donald Swanson]] intimated in his report that Lawende's identification of the woman as Eddowes was doubtful.

At about 3 a.m. on the same day as Eddowes was murdered, a blood-stained fragment of her apron contaminated with fecal matter was found lying in the passage of the doorway leading to Flats 108 and 119, Model Dwellings, Goulston Street, Whitechapel. Above it on the wall was a [[Goulston Street graffito|graffito in chalk]] commonly held to have read: \"The Juwes are the men that Will not be Blamed for nothing\".<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 132; Fido, pp. 47\u201349</ref> The writing may or may not have been related to the murder, but either way it was washed away before dawn on the orders of Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir [[Charles Warren]], who feared that it would spark anti-Jewish riots.<ref>Letter from Charles Warren to the Home Office Undersecretary of State, 6 November 1888, quoted in Begg (2003), p. 197; Evans and Skinner, pp. 183\u2013184 and Marriott, p. 159</ref> Mitre Square had three connecting streets: Church Passage to the north-east, Mitre Street to the south-west, and St James's Place to the north-west. As PC Harvey saw no-one from Church Passage, and PC Watkins saw no-one from Mitre Street, the murderer must have left the square northwards through St James's Place towards Goulston Street.<ref>Fido, p. 77; Marriott, p. 127</ref> Goulston Street was within a quarter of an hour's walk from Mitre Square, on a direct route to Flower and Dean Street where Eddowes lived, hinting that her murderer also resided nearby and headed back there after the killing.<ref>Inquest testimony of surveyor Frederick William Foster, quoted in Evans and Skinner, pp. 201\u2013202, 220 and Fido, p. 76</ref>\n\nMajor Henry Smith, acting Commissioner of the City Police, claimed in his memoirs to have discovered bloodied water in a public sink in a court off Dorset Street, and as the water was slowly running out of the basin, he calculated that the Ripper had been there only moments before. Ripper author [[Martin Fido]] thought it unlikely that the culprit would wait to wash his hands in a semi-public place about forty minutes after the crime, and Smith's memoirs are both unreliable and embellished for dramatic effect.<ref>Fido, pp. 50, 120</ref> There is no mention of the sink in the official police reports.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 133</ref>\n[[File:FromHellLetter.jpg|150px|thumb|alt=Scrawled and misspelled note reading: From hell\u2014Mr Lusk\u2014Sir I send you half the kidne I took from one woman prasarved it for you tother piece I fried and ate it was very nise I may send you the bloody knif that took it out if you only wate a whil longer\u2014Signed Catch me when you can Mishter Lusk|The [[From Hell letter|\"From Hell\"]] letter, received by [[George Lusk]] of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] on 16 October 1888]]\n==Correspondence==\n{{main article|From Hell letter}}\nOn 1 October, [[Saucy Jacky postcard|a postcard, dubbed the \"Saucy Jacky\" postcard]] and signed \"Jack the Ripper\", was received by the [[Central News Agency (London)|Central News Agency]]. It claimed responsibility for Stride's and Eddowes's murders, and described the killing of the two women as the \"double event\", a designation which has endured.<ref>Evans and Skinner, p. 30; Rumbelow, p. 118</ref> It has been argued that the postcard was mailed before the murders were publicised, making it unlikely that a crank would have such knowledge of the crime,<ref>e.g. Cullen, Tom (1965), ''Autumn of Terror'', London: The Bodley Head, p. 103</ref> but it was postmarked more than 24 hours after the killings took place, long after details were known by journalists and residents of the area.<ref name=saucy>Cook, pp. 79\u201380; Fido, pp. 8\u20139; Marriott, pp. 219\u2013222; Rumbelow, p. 123</ref> Police officials later claimed to have identified a journalist as the author of the postcard,<ref>Cook, pp. 94\u201395; Evans and Skinner, pp. 624\u2013633; Marriott, pp. 219\u2013222; Rumbelow, pp. 121\u2013122</ref> and dismissed it as a hoax,<ref>e.g. Letter from Charles Warren to Godfrey Lushington, 10 October 1888, Metropolitan Police Archive MEPO 1/48, quoted in Cook, p. 78; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 140 and Evans and Skinner, p. 43</ref> an assessment shared by most Ripper historians.<ref>e.g. \"the majority view of the Ripper historians, myself included, is that ''all'' the Ripper correspondence was fake.\" Beadle, William (2009) ''Jack the Ripper: Unmasked'', London: John Blake, {{ISBN|978-1-84454-688-6}}, p. 168</ref>\n\nOn 16 October 1888 a parcel containing half a human kidney accompanied by a note was received by [[George Lusk]], Chairman of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]]. The note has become known as the \"Lusk letter\" or the [[From Hell (letter)|\"From hell\" letter]], because of a phrase \"from hell\" used by the writer, who claimed to have \"fried and ate\" the missing kidney half.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 167\u2013168</ref> The handwriting and style were unlike that of the \"Saucy Jacky\" postcard. The kidney was taken to Dr [[Thomas Horrocks Openshaw]] at the nearby [[Royal London Hospital|London Hospital]]. He believed that the kidney was human, from the left side, and preserved in spirit.<ref>Fido, p. 78</ref> The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' reported on 19 October that he said it was a recent \"ginny kidney\" from a 45-year-old female, but in the ''[[The Star (London)|Star]]'' newspaper the same day Openshaw denied the report strongly, saying it was impossible to detect the age or gender of the individual whom the kidney had belonged to,<ref>Cook, p. 146; Fido, p. 78</ref> or how long it had been preserved in spirits. Major Smith claimed in his memoirs that the sent kidney matched the one missing from Eddowes, because the length of renal artery attached to the kidney matched the missing length from the body, and both the body and kidney showed signs of [[Bright's disease]]. Smith's later recollection does not match the medical reports submitted by the examining pathologists or the police records.<ref>Cook, pp. 147\u2013148; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 168; Fido, pp. 78\u201379</ref> Police surgeon Dr Brown said that the kidney had been trimmed up, and that the renal artery was entirely absent.<ref>Cook, p. 148; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 168; Evans and Skinner, p. 189</ref> Metropolitan police memos state that the kidney could have come from any body, such as those found in a hospital morgue.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 168; Evans and Skinner, p. 187; Fido, pp. 78\u201379</ref> Smith's story is thought by historians to be dramatic licence on his part, and the kidney could have been a medical student's prank.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 168; Fido, pp. 78\u201379</ref> Dr Saunders, who attended the post-mortem, told the press, \"the right kidney of the woman Eddowes was perfectly normal in its structure and healthy&nbsp;... my opinion is that it was a student's antic.\"<ref>''Manchester Evening News'', 19 October 1888, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 168; ''Evening News'', 20 October 1888, quoted in Fido, pp. 79\u201380</ref> Chief Inspector [[Donald Swanson]], who co-ordinated the inquiry, wrote: \"similar kidneys might and could be obtained from any dead person upon whom a post mortem had been made for any cause, by students or dissecting room porter.\"<ref>Home Office report quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 170 and Fido, p. 79</ref>\n[[File:Catherine Eddowes grave at City of London Cemetery.jpg|160px|thumb|Catherine Eddowes's grave marker at the City of London Cemetery]]\n\n==Funeral and aftermath==\nCatherine Eddowes was buried on Monday, 8 October 1888 in an elm coffin in the [[City of London Cemetery and Crematorium|City of London Cemetery]], in an unmarked (public) grave 49336, square 318. Kelly and Eddowes's sister attended.<ref>Evans and Skinner, p. 225</ref> Today, square 318 has been re-used for part of the Memorial Gardens for cremated remains. Eddowes lies beside the Garden Way in front of Memorial Bed 1849. In late 1996, the cemetery authorities decided to mark her grave with a plaque.\n\nIn 2014, [[mitochondrial DNA]] that matched that of one of Eddowes's descendants was extracted from a shawl said to have come from the scene of her murder. The DNA match was based on one of seven small segments taken from the hypervariable regions.<ref>Edwards, kindle locations 2442\u20132485</ref> The segment contained a sequence variation described as 314.1C, and claimed to be uncommon, with a frequency of only 1 in 290,000 worldwide. However, Professor Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]] and others pointed out this was in fact an error in nomenclature for the common sequence variation 315.1C,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/jack-the-ripper-id-hinges-on-a-decimal-point-as-scientists-flag-up-dna-error-in-book-that-claims-to-identify-the-whitechapel-killer-9804325.html|title=Jack the Ripper: Scientist who claims to have identified notorious killer has 'made serious DNA error'|last=Connor|first=Steve|date=19 October 2014|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=}}</ref> which is present in more than 99% of the sequences in the EMPOP database.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://empop.org/modules/haplotype/|title=EMPOP.org \u2013 Mitochondrial DNA Control Region Database|publisher=EMPOP|date=|accessdate=2014-10-08}}</ref>\n\nOther DNA on the shawl matched DNA from a relation of [[Aaron Kosminski]], one of the suspects. This match was also based on a segment of mitochondrial DNA,<ref>Edwards, kindle location 3506</ref> but no information was given that would enable the commonness of the sequence to be estimated.\n\nThe owner of the shawl, British author Russell Edwards, claimed the matches proved Kosminski was Jack the Ripper.

It is loosely based on the life of [[silent film]] actor [[Rudolph Valentino]], as recounted in the book ''Valentino, an Intimate Expos\u00e9 of the Sheik'', written by Chaw Mank and [[Brad Steiger]].\n\nThe genesis of ''Valentino'' began with producers [[Irwin Winkler]] and [[Robert Chartoff]], who began developing the project in 1975. Russell was selected to direct, and he co-wrote the film with [[Mardik Martin]]. Told through [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] following Valentino's 1926 death, the screenplay focuses heavily on Valentino's relationships with several women, chiefly his second wife [[Natacha Rambova]], as well as addresses the published rumors of his alleged [[homosexuality]]. \n\nFilming of ''Valentino'' was originally planned to occur in [[Los Angeles]], but Russell chose to film in Spain and England's [[Elstree Studios]] instead due to budgetary issues. Principal photography laster 21 weeks from August 1975 to January 1976, and the shoot was marked by tensions between stars Nureyev and Phillips, who clashed over their approaches to the material, as well as between Nureyev and Russell.\n\nReleased in October 1977, the film received mixed reviews from critics, some of whom lambasted it for its critical, and sometimes [[satire|satirical]] depiction of [[Hollywood]] and the pressures of the film studio system; other critics praised the film for its lush visuals and performances. Despite the mixed critical response, the film received three [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] nominations, for [[BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], and [[BAFTA Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]]. Russell later described his decision to make the film instead of The Rose with Bette Midler as the biggest mistake of his career.<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article2870480.ece Ten big things I have learnt from my mistakes - Times Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{registration required}}</ref>\n\nIn his memoirs, Winkler called ''Valentino'' his \"least favorite or worst film... by a large margin\".<ref name=\"wink\">{{cite book|first=Irwin|last=Winkler|title=A Life in Movies: Stories from Fifty Years in Hollywood|page=1232/3917|edition=Kindle|publisher=Abrams Press|year=2019}}</ref>\n==Plot==\nIn 1926, thousands of fans mob the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] of recently-deceased film star [[Rudolph Valentino]] in New York City. When order is restored at the funeral home, a series of important women in Valentino's life come to mourn. Each remembers him via [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s: The first of these women, Bianca de Saulles, knew Valentino when he was a  [[taxi dancer]] and [[gigolo]] in New York City, working under a woman named Billie Streeter. Upon meeting him, he shares with her his dream of owning an orange grove in [[California]]. After mobsters rob Valentino, he decides he must make the move west. Specifically, Bianca reminisces of a day when she witnessed Valentino romantically dancing with male ballet dancer [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], teaching him how to do the [[tango]].\n\nNext is a young movie executive and screenwriter named [[June Mathis]], who has an unrequited love for Valentino. She first meets Valentino in California, where he upsets [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]] by grabbing the [[wikt:starlet|starlet]] next to Arbuckle and romancing her into becoming his first wife, actress [[Jean Acker]]. Acker's glamorous and luxurious life motivates Valentino to try acting himself. Mathis recalls seeing him in a bit part in a movie and, based on that alone, recommending him for a larger role in her next project, ''[[The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921 film)|The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]''. The hugely successful 1921 film launches Valentino to superstardom, and she is proud to have discovered him.\n\n[[Alla Nazimova]] subsequently makes a flamboyant entrance at Valentino's funeral.  She proceeds to make a scene and, when the photographers ask her to repeat it for the cameras, she obliges. Nazimova claims a relationship with Valentino and recalls working on ''[[Camille (1921 film)|Camille]]'' with him. Next, Nazimova's friend, art designer [[Natacha Rambova]] (and second wife of Valentino) enters and tells reporters that, even though she and Valentino are physically separated, they are still close via the spirit world. Her flashback shows that she was at first Nazimova's lover, but took advantage of Valentino's infatuation with her to help her [[social climber|social climb]]. During the filming of ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'', Rambova seduces Valentino with a seven veils dance. Despite knowing he is in the midst of divorcing Acker, she insists on going to Mexico so they can marry.  Once they return to the United States, Valentino is arrested for bigamy. Because [[Jesse Lasky]] refuses to pay bail for Valentino, he has to spend the night in jail, where the guards deny him bathroom privileges and, with the other prisoners, taunt him about his lack of masculinity. The result is his complete humiliation.\n\nOn the set of Valentino's subsequent film, ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (1924 film)|Monsieur Beaucaire]]'', Rambova and [[Sidney Olcott]] take over directing.  Two stage hands, wondering if 'Rambova calls the shots in bed, too', toss a pink powder puff onto Valentino's lap. Rambova demands that whoever did it come forward or she and Valentino will walk off the set for good. Valentino finishes the picture, but Rambova insists he refuse future work at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] until Lasky meets certain demands. Lasky suspends them and the couple end up broke. A man named George Melford approaches them, offering to help them book personal appearances for Mineralava, a beauty product company. The tour is a success, and, with Melford's help, Valentino and Rambova negotiate a good deal with Lasky.\n\nLater, Valentino reads a newspaper article questioning his manhood and implies he is [[homosexual]]. The article outrages Valentino, who challenges the reporter to a duel. For 'legal reasons' the duel becomes a boxing match. Rory O'Neil, who happens to be a professional [[Boxing|boxer]], stands in for the reporter. The fight becomes a [[ballet]] of sorts, and flashbacks to the dance with Nijinsky parallel the match. Valentino eventually lands a blow which wins him the fight. However, he now begins to exhibit signs of an ulcer.\n\nO'Neil asks for a rematch, this time a drinking contest. Despite his ulcer, Valentino accepts. Although Valentino defeats O'Neil again, his excessive drinking exacerbates the ulcer, which perforates when he returns to his home that night. He dies crawling on the floor, unable to reach an orange he had drunkenly played with and dropped on the floor.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Rudolf Nureyev]] as [[Rudolph Valentino]]\n* [[Leslie Caron]] as [[Alla Nazimova]]\n* [[Michelle Phillips]] as [[Natacha Rambova]]\n* [[Carol Kane]] as [[Jean Acker]], Fatty's girl\n* [[Felicity Kendal]] as [[June Mathis]]\n* [[Seymour Cassel]] as George Ullman\n* [[Huntz Hall]] as [[Jesse Lasky]]\n* [[Alfred Marks]] as Richard Rowland\n* [[David de Keyser]] as [[Joseph Schenck]]\n* [[Linda Thorson]] as Billie Streeter\n* [[Leland Palmer (actress)|Leland Palmer]] as Marjorie Tain\n* [[Lindsay Kemp]] as Angus McBride\n* [[Peter Vaughan]] as Rory O'Neil\n* [[Penelope Milford]] as Lorna Sinclair\n* [[Emily Bolton]] as Bianca de Saulles\n* [[Anthony Dowell]] as [[Vaslav Nijinsky]]\n* [[William Hootkins]] as [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]]\n* [[Don Fellows]] as George Melford\n* [[John Justin]] as [[Sidney Olcott]]\n* [[Anton Diffring]] as Baron Long\n* [[Jennie Linden]] as [[Agnes Ayres]]\n* [[Dudley Sutton]] as Willie\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\n===Historical accuracy===\nFilm historian Gene D. Phillips notes that the grand set pieces and events exhibited in ''Valentino'', including the dramatic prison sequence, the lavish ''Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'' film set, and the climactic boxing match, all fit neatly within the narrative framework as they are rooted in some historical basis.{{sfn|Phillips|1979|p=144}} \"They are in each case founded on facts which are magnified but not distorted,\" Phillips suggests.{{sfn|Phillips|1979|p=144}} Alexander Bland, who wrote ''The Nureyev Valentino: Portrait of a Film'' (1977) which chronicles the making of the film, states that \"only in isolated sequences\u2014Lasky communicating with an ape, a powder-puff cabaret, couples fox-trotting round the boxing ring\u2014has Russell let his fancy of the lead...&nbsp; Russell has taken liberties, but he has not strayed into license.\"{{sfn|Bland|1977|pages=48\u201349}} Summarizing Russell's handling of the film's historical accuracy, Bland further elaborated:\n\n{{quote|His problem was to enclose a many-layered, multi-faceted story within a simple framework. He had to show Valentino as the victim of commercial society, Valentino as a symbol of innocence blighted by success, Valentino as a fly caught in the monstrous but glittering web of show business, Valentino as the supreme [[sex symbol]]. He was all of that, but he was also a human individual. That dilemma is what Russell's film is all about.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=49}}}} \n\nSome scholars have noted the film's interpolation of certain events and characters, particularly the film's presentation of Alla Nazimova as she dramatically enters the funeral home to mourn Valentino: Film scholar Joseph Lanza suggests that Russell \"folds the personages\" of Nazimova and actress [[Pola Negri]]\u2014another woman who had a close relationship with Valentino, but who does not appear as a character in the film\u2014together.{{sfn|Lanza|2007|p=200}} Lanza cites the fact that, per contemporaneous press accounts, Negri famously fainted several times during her visit to Valentino's wake, while there is no evidence suggesting the same of Nazimova.{{sfn|Lanza|2007|pages=200\u2013201}} \n\n===Treatment of Valentino's sexuality===\nRussell sought to explore elements of Valentino's sexual life, including documented rumors encircling Valentino during his lifetime that he was [[homosexual]], which no film adaptations of his life had done before.{{sfn|Phillips|1979|p=135}} Russell attempted to contact [[Jean Acker]], Valentino's first wife, to discuss the reasons for their short-lived marriage (the two separated the day after they were married), but Acker, eighty years old at the time of production, refused to speak to Russell.{{sfn|Phillips|1979|p=135}}\n\nFilm scholar Brian Faucette notes that the film continually shows how \"the people who interact with Valentino are constantly trying to discover his [[sexual orientation]]...&nbsp;Russell does imply that women value Valentino as a sexual object but that Valentino is not a man interested in selling his body for money.\"{{sfn|Faucette|2009|p=163}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe idea of a [[biopic]] of [[Rudolph Valentino]] was considered by producers [[Irwin Winkler]] and [[Robert Chartoff]].{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=7}} \"What excited us was the idea of Valentino as the first personality created by the mass media instrument in its infancy, and the inconsistency between his own life and his screen persona,\" Chartoff said.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=7}} Winkler and Chartoff commissioned writer [[Mardik Martin]] to begin researching Valentino's life and develop a screenplay.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=7}} Both Winkler and Chartoff were admirers of [[Ken Russell]]'s films, and sought him to direct the project.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=7}} The three had a meeting in [[London]], and he ultimately agreed to direct.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=7}}\n\nRussell helped write the screenplay along with Martin, which went through several drafts, making sure to \"zoom in on a few incidents and expand them to produce the maximum effect.\"{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=49}} Faucette further observes that the film's opening dance sequence between Valentino and Nijinsky \"allows Russell to hint at the idea that Valentino may be dancing with this man because of sexual desire, rather than out of mere professional obligation...&nbsp; The way that this scene is staged implies that the viewer has become a voyeur of an intimate moment between lovers.\"{{sfn|Faucette|2009|p=162}}\n\n===Casting===\n{{Multiple images\n | align = right\n | width1 = 126\n | image1 = Nureyev Allan Warren.jpg\n | width2 = 160\n | image2 = Michelle Phillips 1971 Golden Globes.jpg\n | footer = [[Rudolf Nureyev]] and [[Michelle Phillips]] were cast in the lead roles of [[Rudolph Valentino]] and [[Natacha Rambova]], respectively\n}}\nRudolf Nureyev, a Russian-born dancer, was initially asked by Russell to appear as dancer [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], after Russell had uncovered lore that Valentino had taught Nijinsky the [[tango]] in New York; Russell envisioned the film's opening sequence consisting of this interaction.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=7}} However, after several unsuccessful attempts at casting the role of Valentino (Paul Clarke, a dancer who was initially cast, died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] prior to production),<ref name=afi/> Russell proposed to the producers that they ask Nureyev to instead star in the title role.{{sfn|Bland|1977|pages=7\u20138}} Nureyev had previously been considered to play Valentino by director [[Vittorio De Sica]] in a biopic that never came to fruition.{{sfn|Phillips|1979|p=133}} After meeting with Nureyev in [[Amsterdam]] in 1975, Winkler and Chartoff concluded: \"There was no doubt in any of our minds as the evening ended that the part was his.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=8}} The Nijinsky role was subsequently granted to [[Anthony Dowell]].<ref name=afi/> Because Nureyev had a years' worth of dancing obligations booked at the time, the production was postponed until 1976 when Nureyev had availability.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=10}} Though he agreed to the project, Nureyev had some reservations based on Russell's reputation for being strong willed: \"We both have strong personalities and opinions, but it was his film, and naturally he knows far more about films than I do.\"{{sfn|Bland|1977|pages=22\u201323}}\n\nMichelle Phillips, a former vocalist in [[The Mamas and the Papas]] who had made her major feature film debut in ''[[Dillinger (1973 film)|Dillinger]]'' (1973), was cast as [[Natacha Rambova]], Valentino's lover and eventual wife.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=59}} Russell had been impressed by Phillips's performance in the aforementioned film, and felt she embodied both the sexuality and toughness that he envisioned for his version of Rambova.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=59}} \"I asked [Russell] to dinner at a Mexican restaurant,\" Phillips recalled. \"When he arrived I had my hair done up in braids as I thought Rambova would have been. I didn't want to leave everything to chance.\"{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=59}} To prepare for the role, Phillips contacted Rambova's sister, Katherine Peterson, who resided in California, and spoke with her on the phone for several hours about Rambova's life.{{sfn|Bland|1977|pages=59\u201360}} Phillips approached the role under the supposition that Rambova was a [[lesbian]], but \"about as asexual as you can get; [I think] her real turn-ons were artistic.\"{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=61}} She also read Valentino's own autobiography, ''My Private Diary'', in order to glean an understanding of Rambova from his point of view.{{sfn|Lanza|2007|p=201}}\n\nFrench actress Leslie Caron was cast as [[Alla Nazimova]], Rambova's friend and confidant.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=62}} Caron felt that Nazimova had \"been made more extravagant in the film than she actually was,\" but said she still \"loved\" the character.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=62}} In smaller supporting roles, William Hootkins appears as [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]], while Carol Kane was cast as Fatty's girlfriend, a young starlet who becomes a friend of Valentino.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=62}} British actress Felicity Kendal, then known for her work in British television, was cast as [[June Mathis]], a studio executive who was infatuated with Valentino.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=64}} Several of the cast members, including Nureyev and Caron, screened several of Valentino's films to prepare for their roles.{{sfn|Bland|1977|pages=27\u201329}}\n\n===Filming===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|bgcolor=#ffffe0|quote=\"He's generous and vital artistically and he's vulnerable in quite an overt way.

He inspires you. You aren't locked up in the dialogue or script, he's always willing to talk about it.\"{{sfn|Bland|1977|pages=44\u201345}}\n\nCinematographer [[Peter Suschitzky]] noted that Russell was especially meticulous about the framing of shots: \"Russell's very visual approach is a great help but he can be demanding. He has strong obsessions which are sometimes difficult to understand. He has an obsessive fear of things being cut off, for instance, and will do retakes just to get a fraction of an inch more headroom or space around the feet, retakes not for an improved performance but for camera.\"{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=56}} Filming was officially completed in January 1977, after what Russell characterized as \"twenty-one weeks of concentrated anxiety.\"{{sfn|Phillips|1979|p=133}}\n\n===Music===\nRussell chose to score the film largely with compositions by American composer [[Ferde Grof\u00e9]].{{sfn|Phillips|1979|pages=134\u2013135}} Grof\u00e9 had died fifteen years prior to the making of the film, but Russell was given access to numerous recordings by Grof\u00e9's son in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Phillips|1979|p=135}} Russell felt that music was vital to the film, as important \"as if I were making a movie on a composer...&nbsp;I realized that Grof\u00e9s type of tuneful, rather dated and idiosyncratic style would well suit our slightly [[satire|satirical]] film.\"{{sfn|Phillips|1979|p=135}} Grof\u00e9's compositions were adapted and arranged by English composer [[Stanley Black]].{{sfn|Phillips|1979|p=196}}\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\nThe film topped the British box-office for two weeks, but was not a hit in America.\n\n===Critical response===\n''Valentino'' garnered mixed reviews from film critics.<ref name=afi/> [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the performance of Caron, but felt that Nureyev \"has trouble delivery snappy patter with much conviction,\" and that Phillips, though \" suitably steely-eyed,\" lacked authenticity.<ref name=maslin>{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City, New York|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=Film:Film: Vital Nureyev Upstages 'Valentino'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/06/archives/film-vital-nureyev-upstages-valentino.html|date=October 6, 1977|archive-url=http://archive.is/wip/YPAYm|archive-date=February 8, 2020}}</ref> However, Maslin praised the film's visuals as \"extremely handsome.\"<ref name=maslin/> \n\nHowever, ''[[The Village Voice]]'' called the film \"so embarrassingly and extensively bad that it achieves a kind of excruciating consistency with the rest of his [Russell's] career.\" [[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' dismissed the film as \"superficial and silly\".{{sfn|Wilson|2005|p=204}} Although [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave a three-star rating to the film, sensing that it was a critique of the [[Hollywood]] studio machine, he noted that it suffered from what he felt was Russell's apparent dislike and disregard for Valentino.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1977/10/07/page/25/article/loves-labor-lost-in-valentino | title=Love's labor lost in 'Valentino' | first=Gene | last=Siskel | author-link=Gene Siskel | date=October 7, 1977 | work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref> \n\nSeveral critics commented on the film's wry depiction of Hollywood as an oppressive industry, such as Maslin, who felt that \"the best parts of the film are those that pit Valentino against Hollywood, which both he and Mr. Russell seem to see as the biggest affront of them all.\"<ref name=maslin/> Richard Schnickel of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine alternately excoriated the film for its \"relentless anti-Americanism, implying that the unfortunate inhabitants of these shores are the only citizens of the world capable of materialism or vulgarity.\"{{sfn|Phillips|1979|p=136}} Russell himself responded to the criticisms suggesting the film had an anti-American or anti-Hollywood tone: \"I don't hate Hollywood. I am passionately dispassionate of my treatment of it in ''Valentino''. Some studio executives like Jesse Lasky were hard on Valentino, so I show them being hard on him.{{sfn|Phillips|1979|p=137}} Commenting on claims that Russell's depictions blended fact with fiction, he said: \"I only want to be accurate up to a point.

[[biographical film]] directed by [[Ken Russell]] and starring [[Rudolf Nureyev]], [[Leslie Caron]], [[Michelle Phillips]], and [[Carol Kane]]. It is loosely based on the life of [[silent film]] actor [[Rudolph Valentino]], as recounted in the book ''Valentino, an Intimate Expos\u00e9 of the Sheik'', written by Chaw Mank and [[Brad Steiger]].\n\nThe genesis of ''Valentino'' began with producers [[Irwin Winkler]] and [[Robert Chartoff]], who began developing the project in 1975. Russell was selected to direct, and he co-wrote the film with [[Mardik Martin]]. Told through [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] following Valentino's 1926 death, the screenplay focuses heavily on Valentino's relationships with several women, chiefly his second wife [[Natacha Rambova]], as well as addresses the published rumors of his alleged [[homosexuality]]. \n\nFilming of ''Valentino'' was originally planned to occur in [[Los Angeles]], but Russell chose to film in Spain and England's [[Elstree Studios]] instead due to budgetary issues. Principal photography laster 21 weeks from August 1975 to January 1976, and the shoot was marked by tensions between stars Nureyev and Phillips, who clashed over their approaches to the material, as well as between Nureyev and Russell.\n\nReleased in October 1977, the film received mixed reviews from critics, some of whom lambasted it for its critical, and sometimes [[satire|satirical]] depiction of [[Hollywood]] and the pressures of the film studio system; other critics praised the film for its lush visuals and performances. Despite the mixed critical response, the film received three [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] nominations, for [[BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], and [[BAFTA Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]]. Russell later described his decision to make the film instead of The Rose with Bette Midler as the biggest mistake of his career.<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article2870480.ece Ten big things I have learnt from my mistakes - Times Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{registration required}}</ref>\n\nIn his memoirs, Winker called ''Valentino'' his \"least favorite or worst film... by a large margin\".<ref name=\"wink\">{{cite book|first=Irwin|last=Winkler|title=A Life in Movies: Stories from Fifty Years in Hollywood|page=1232/3917|edition=Kindle|publisher=Abrams Press|year=2019}}</ref>\n==Plot==\nIn 1926, thousands of fans mob the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] of recently-deceased film star [[Rudolph Valentino]] in New York City. When order is restored at the funeral home, a series of important women in Valentino's life come to mourn. Each remembers him via [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s: The first of these women, Bianca de Saulles, knew Valentino when he was a  [[taxi dancer]] and [[gigolo]] in New York City, working under a woman named Billie Streeter. Upon meeting him, he shares with her his dream of owning an orange grove in [[California]]. After mobsters rob Valentino, he decides he must make the move west. Specifically, Bianca reminisces of a day when she witnessed Valentino romantically dancing with male ballet dancer [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], teaching him how to do the [[tango]].\n\nNext is a young movie executive and screenwriter named [[June Mathis]], who has an unrequited love for Valentino. She first meets Valentino in California, where he upsets [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]] by grabbing the [[wikt:starlet|starlet]] next to Arbuckle and romancing her into becoming his first wife, actress [[Jean Acker]]. Acker's glamorous and luxurious life motivates Valentino to try acting himself. Mathis recalls seeing him in a bit part in a movie and, based on that alone, recommending him for a larger role in her next project, ''[[The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921 film)|The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]''. The hugely successful 1921 film launches Valentino to superstardom, and she is proud to have discovered him.\n\n[[Alla Nazimova]] subsequently makes a flamboyant entrance at Valentino's funeral.  She proceeds to make a scene and, when the photographers ask her to repeat it for the cameras, she obliges. Nazimova claims a relationship with Valentino and recalls working on ''[[Camille (1921 film)|Camille]]'' with him. Next, Nazimova's friend, art designer [[Natacha Rambova]] (and second wife of Valentino) enters and tells reporters that, even though she and Valentino are physically separated, they are still close via the spirit world. Her flashback shows that she was at first Nazimova's lover, but took advantage of Valentino's infatuation with her to help her [[social climber|social climb]]. During the filming of ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'', Rambova seduces Valentino with a seven veils dance. Despite knowing he is in the midst of divorcing Acker, she insists on going to Mexico so they can marry.  Once they return to the United States, Valentino is arrested for bigamy. Because [[Jesse Lasky]] refuses to pay bail for Valentino, he has to spend the night in jail, where the guards deny him bathroom privileges and, with the other prisoners, taunt him about his lack of masculinity. The result is his complete humiliation.\n\nOn the set of Valentino's subsequent film, ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (1924 film)|Monsieur Beaucaire]]'', Rambova and [[Sidney Olcott]] take over directing.  Two stage hands, wondering if 'Rambova calls the shots in bed, too', toss a pink powder puff onto Valentino's lap. Rambova demands that whoever did it come forward or she and Valentino will walk off the set for good. Valentino finishes the picture, but Rambova insists he refuse future work at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] until Lasky meets certain demands. Lasky suspends them and the couple end up broke. A man named George Melford approaches them, offering to help them book personal appearances for Mineralava, a beauty product company. The tour is a success, and, with Melford's help, Valentino and Rambova negotiate a good deal with Lasky.\n\nLater, Valentino reads a newspaper article questioning his manhood and implies he is [[homosexual]]. The article outrages Valentino, who challenges the reporter to a duel. For 'legal reasons' the duel becomes a boxing match. Rory O'Neil, who happens to be a professional [[Boxing|boxer]], stands in for the reporter. The fight becomes a [[ballet]] of sorts, and flashbacks to the dance with Nijinsky parallel the match. Valentino eventually lands a blow which wins him the fight. However, he now begins to exhibit signs of an ulcer.\n\nO'Neil asks for a rematch, this time a drinking contest. Despite his ulcer, Valentino accepts. Although Valentino defeats O'Neil again, his excessive drinking exacerbates the ulcer, which perforates when he returns to his home that night. He dies crawling on the floor, unable to reach an orange he had drunkenly played with and dropped on the floor.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Rudolf Nureyev]] as [[Rudolph Valentino]]\n* [[Leslie Caron]] as [[Alla Nazimova]]\n* [[Michelle Phillips]] as [[Natacha Rambova]]\n* [[Carol Kane]] as [[Jean Acker]], Fatty's girl\n* [[Felicity Kendal]] as [[June Mathis]]\n* [[Seymour Cassel]] as George Ullman\n* [[Huntz Hall]] as [[Jesse Lasky]]\n* [[Alfred Marks]] as Richard Rowland\n* [[David de Keyser]] as [[Joseph Schenck]]\n* [[Linda Thorson]] as Billie Streeter\n* [[Leland Palmer (actress)|Leland Palmer]] as Marjorie Tain\n* [[Lindsay Kemp]] as Angus McBride\n* [[Peter Vaughan]] as Rory O'Neil\n* [[Penelope Milford]] as Lorna Sinclair\n* [[Emily Bolton]] as Bianca de Saulles\n* [[Anthony Dowell]] as [[Vaslav Nijinsky]]\n* [[William Hootkins]] as [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]]\n* [[Don Fellows]] as George Melford\n* [[John Justin]] as [[Sidney Olcott]]\n* [[Anton Diffring]] as Baron Long\n* [[Jennie Linden]] as [[Agnes Ayres]]\n* [[Dudley Sutton]] as Willie\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\n===Historical accuracy===\nFilm historian Gene D. Phillips notes that the grand set pieces and events exhibited in ''Valentino'', including the dramatic prison sequence, the lavish ''Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'' film set, and the climactic boxing match, all fit neatly within the narrative framework as they are rooted in some historical basis.{{sfn|Phillips|1979|p=144}} \"They are in each case founded on facts which are magnified but not distorted,\" Phillips suggests.{{sfn|Phillips|1979|p=144}} Alexander Bland, who wrote ''The Nureyev Valentino: Portrait of a Film'' (1977) which chronicles the making of the film, states that \"only in isolated sequences\u2014Lasky communicating with an ape, a powder-puff cabaret, couples fox-trotting round the boxing ring\u2014has Russell let his fancy of the lead...&nbsp; Russell has taken liberties, but he has not strayed into license.\"{{sfn|Bland|1977|pages=48\u201349}} Summarizing Russell's handling of the film's historical accuracy, Bland further elaborated:\n\n{{quote|His problem was to enclose a many-layered, multi-faceted story within a simple framework. He had to show Valentino as the victim of commercial society, Valentino as a symbol of innocence blighted by success, Valentino as a fly caught in the monstrous but glittering web of show business, Valentino as the supreme [[sex symbol]]. He was all of that, but he was also a human individual. That dilemma is what Russell's film is all about.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=49}}}} \n\nSome scholars have noted the film's interpolation of certain events and characters, particularly the film's presentation of Alla Nazimova as she dramatically enters the funeral home to mourn Valentino: Film scholar Joseph Lanza suggests that Russell \"folds the personages\" of Nazimova and actress [[Pola Negri]]\u2014another woman who had a close relationship with Valentino, but who does not appear as a character in the film\u2014together.{{sfn|Lanza|2007|p=200}} Lanza cites the fact that, per contemporaneous press accounts, Negri famously fainted several times during her visit to Valentino's wake, while there is no evidence suggesting the same of Nazimova.{{sfn|Lanza|2007|pages=200\u2013201}} \n\n===Treatment of Valentino's sexuality===\nRussell sought to explore elements of Valentino's sexual life, including documented rumors encircling Valentino during his lifetime that he was [[homosexual]], which no film adaptations of his life had done before.{{sfn|Phillips|1979|p=135}} Russell attempted to contact [[Jean Acker]], Valentino's first wife, to discuss the reasons for their short-lived marriage (the two separated the day after they were married), but Acker, eighty years old at the time of production, refused to speak to Russell.{{sfn|Phillips|1979|p=135}}\n\nFilm scholar Brian Faucette notes that the film continually shows how \"the people who interact with Valentino are constantly trying to discover his [[sexual orientation]]...&nbsp;Russell does imply that women value Valentino as a sexual object but that Valentino is not a man interested in selling his body for money.\"{{sfn|Faucette|2009|p=163}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe idea of a [[biopic]] of [[Rudolph Valentino]] was considered by producers [[Irwin Winkler]] and [[Robert Chartoff]].{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=7}} \"What excited us was the idea of Valentino as the first personality created by the mass media instrument in its infancy, and the inconsistency between his own life and his screen persona,\" Chartoff said.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=7}} Winkler and Chartoff commissioned writer [[Mardik Martin]] to begin researching Valentino's life and develop a screenplay.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=7}} Both Winkler and Chartoff were admirers of [[Ken Russell]]'s films, and sought him to direct the project.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=7}} The three had a meeting in [[London]], and he ultimately agreed to direct.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=7}}\n\nRussell helped write the screenplay along with Martin, which went through several drafts, making sure to \"zoom in on a few incidents and expand them to produce the maximum effect.\"{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=49}} Faucette further observes that the film's opening dance sequence between Valentino and Nijinsky \"allows Russell to hint at the idea that Valentino may be dancing with this man because of sexual desire, rather than out of mere professional obligation...&nbsp; The way that this scene is staged implies that the viewer has become a voyeur of an intimate moment between lovers.\"{{sfn|Faucette|2009|p=162}}\n\n===Casting===\n{{Multiple images\n | align = right\n | width1 = 126\n | image1 = Nureyev Allan Warren.jpg\n | width2 = 160\n | image2 = Michelle Phillips 1971 Golden Globes.jpg\n | footer = [[Rudolf Nureyev]] and [[Michelle Phillips]] were cast in the lead roles of [[Rudolph Valentino]] and [[Natacha Rambova]], respectively\n}}\nRudolf Nureyev, a Russian-born dancer, was initially asked by Russell to appear as dancer [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], after Russell had uncovered lore that Valentino had taught Nijinsky the [[tango]] in New York; Russell envisioned the film's opening sequence consisting of this interaction.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=7}} However, after several unsuccessful attempts at casting the role of Valentino (Paul Clarke, a dancer who was initially cast, died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] prior to production),<ref name=afi/> Russell proposed to the producers that they ask Nureyev to instead star in the title role.{{sfn|Bland|1977|pages=7\u20138}} Nureyev had previously been considered to play Valentino by director [[Vittorio De Sica]] in a biopic that never came to fruition.{{sfn|Phillips|1979|p=133}} After meeting with Nureyev in [[Amsterdam]] in 1975, Winkler and Chartoff concluded: \"There was no doubt in any of our minds as the evening ended that the part was his.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=8}} The Nijinsky role was subsequently granted to [[Anthony Dowell]].<ref name=afi/> Because Nureyev had a years' worth of dancing obligations booked at the time, the production was postponed until 1976 when Nureyev had availability.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=10}} Though he agreed to the project, Nureyev had some reservations based on Russell's reputation for being strong willed: \"We both have strong personalities and opinions, but it was his film, and naturally he knows far more about films than I do.\"{{sfn|Bland|1977|pages=22\u201323}}\n\nMichelle Phillips, a former vocalist in [[The Mamas and the Papas]] who had made her major feature film debut in ''[[Dillinger (1973 film)|Dillinger]]'' (1973), was cast as [[Natacha Rambova]], Valentino's lover and eventual wife.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=59}} Russell had been impressed by Phillips's performance in the aforementioned film, and felt she embodied both the sexuality and toughness that he envisioned for his version of Rambova.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=59}} \"I asked [Russell] to dinner at a Mexican restaurant,\" Phillips recalled. \"When he arrived I had my hair done up in braids as I thought Rambova would have been. I didn't want to leave everything to chance.\"{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=59}} To prepare for the role, Phillips contacted Rambova's sister, Katherine Peterson, who resided in California, and spoke with her on the phone for several hours about Rambova's life.{{sfn|Bland|1977|pages=59\u201360}} Phillips approached the role under the supposition that Rambova was a [[lesbian]], but \"about as asexual as you can get; [I think] her real turn-ons were artistic.\"{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=61}} She also read Valentino's own autobiography, ''My Private Diary'', in order to glean an understanding of Rambova from his point of view.{{sfn|Lanza|2007|p=201}}\n\nFrench actress Leslie Caron was cast as [[Alla Nazimova]], Rambova's friend and confidant.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=62}} Caron felt that Nazimova had \"been made more extravagant in the film than she actually was,\" but said she still \"loved\" the character.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=62}} In smaller supporting roles, William Hootkins appears as [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]], while Carol Kane was cast as Fatty's girlfriend, a young starlet who becomes a friend of Valentino.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=62}} British actress Felicity Kendal, then known for her work in British television, was cast as [[June Mathis]], a studio executive who was infatuated with Valentino.{{sfn|Bland|1977|p=64}} Several of the cast members, including Nureyev and Caron, screened several of Valentino's films to prepare for their roles.{{sfn|Bland|1977|pages=27\u201329}}\n\n===Filming===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|bgcolor=#ffffe0|quote=\"He's generous and vital artistically and he's vulnerable in quite an overt way.

He inspires you.

Japan's 1993\u201394 recession was U-shaped and its 8-out-of-9 quarters of contraction in 1997\u201399 can be described as L-shaped. [[Korea]], [[Hong Kong]] and South-east Asia experienced U-shaped recessions in 1997\u201398, although [[Thailand]]\u2019s eight consecutive quarters of decline should be termed L-shaped.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Key_Indicators/2001/default.asp |title=Key Indicators 2001: Growth and Change in Asia and the Pacific |publisher=ADB.org |accessdate=31 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317155544/http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Key_Indicators/2001/default.asp |archivedate=17 March 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Psychological aspects===\nRecessions have psychological and confidence aspects.

This is when large numbers of consumers or corporations pay down debt (i.e., save) rather than spend or invest, which slows the economy. The term [[balance sheet]] derives from an accounting identity that holds that assets must always equal the sum of liabilities plus equity. If asset prices fall below the value of the debt incurred to purchase them, then the equity must be negative, meaning the consumer or corporation is insolvent. Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2014 that \"the best working hypothesis seems to be that the [[subprime mortgage crisis|financial crisis]] was only one manifestation of a broader problem of excessive debt\u2014that it was a so-called \"balance sheet recession\". In Krugman's view, such crises require debt reduction strategies combined with higher government spending to offset declines from the private sector as it pays down its debt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jul/10/geithner-does-he-pass-test/|title=Does He Pass the Test?|first=Paul|last=Krugman|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nFor example, economist Richard Koo wrote that Japan's \"Great Recession\" that began in 1990 was a \"balance sheet recession\". It was triggered by a collapse in land and stock prices, which caused Japanese firms to have [[negative equity]], meaning their assets were worth less than their liabilities. Despite zero [[interest rate]]s and expansion of the [[money supply]] to encourage borrowing, Japanese corporations in aggregate opted to pay down their debts from their own business earnings rather than borrow to invest as firms typically do. Corporate investment, a key demand component of GDP, fell enormously (22% of GDP) between 1990 and its peak decline in 2003. Japanese firms overall became net savers after 1998, as opposed to borrowers. Koo argues that it was massive fiscal stimulus (borrowing and spending by the government) that offset this decline and enabled Japan to maintain its level of GDP. In his view, this avoided a U.S. type [[Great Depression]], in which U.S. GDP fell by 46%. He argued that monetary policy was ineffective because there was limited demand for funds while firms paid down their liabilities.  In a balance sheet recession, GDP declines by the amount of debt repayment and un-borrowed individual savings, leaving government stimulus spending as the primary remedy.<ref name=\"Koo 2009\"/><ref name=\"Koo 2011\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Gregory White|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-koo-recession-2010-4#-1 |title=Presentation by Richard Koo \u2013 The Age of Balance Sheet Recessions |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=14 April 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue58/Koo58.pdf|title=Richard Koo \u2013 The World In Balance Sheet Recession \u2013 Real World Economics Review \u2013 December 2011|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nKrugman discussed the balance sheet recession concept during 2010, agreeing with Koo's situation assessment and view that sustained [[deficit spending]] when faced with a balance sheet recession would be appropriate. However, Krugman argued that monetary policy could also affect savings behavior, as inflation or credible promises of future inflation (generating negative real interest rates) would encourage less savings. In other words, people would tend to spend more rather than save if they believe inflation is on the horizon. In more technical terms, Krugman argues that the private sector savings curve is elastic even during a balance sheet recession (responsive to changes in real interest rates) disagreeing with Koo's view that it is inelastic (non-responsive to changes in real interest rates).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/notes-on-koo-wonkish/|title=Notes On Koo (Wonkish)|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/debt-deleveraging-and-liquidity-trap-new-model|title=Debt, deleveraging, and the liquidity trap|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=18 November 2010|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nA July 2012 survey of balance sheet recession research reported that consumer demand and employment are affected by [[Household debt|household leverage]] levels. Both durable and non-durable goods consumption declined as households moved from low to high leverage with the decline in property values experienced during the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. Further, reduced consumption due to higher household leverage can account for a significant decline in employment levels. Policies that help reduce mortgage debt or household leverage could therefore have stimulative effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/06/grim-natural-experiments/|title=Grim Natural Experiments|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nextnewdeal.net/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016030017/http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/new-report-literature-summary-new-balance-sheet-recession-research|url-status=dead|title=New Report: A Literature Summary on New Balance-Sheet Recession Research|archivedate=October 16, 2015|website=Next New Deal}}</ref>\n\n===Liquidity trap===\nA [[liquidity trap]] is a [[Keynesian]] theory that a situation can develop in which interest rates reach near zero ([[zero interest-rate policy]]) yet do not effectively stimulate the economy. In theory, near-zero interest rates should encourage firms and consumers to borrow and spend. However, if too many individuals or corporations focus on saving or paying down debt rather than spending, lower interest rates have less effect on investment and consumption behavior; the lower interest rates are like \"[[pushing on a string]]\". Economist [[Paul Krugman]] described the [[Subprime mortgage crisis|U.S. 2009 recession]] and [[Lost decade (Japan)|Japan's lost decade]] as liquidity traps. One remedy to a liquidity trap is expanding the money supply via [[quantitative easing]] or other techniques in which money is effectively printed to purchase assets, thereby creating [[inflationary]] expectations that cause savers to begin spending again. Government stimulus spending and [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] policies to stimulate exports and reduce imports are other techniques to stimulate demand.<ref name=\"Krugman 2009\">{{cite book\n| last = Krugman\n| first = Paul\n| year = 2009\n| title = The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008\n| publisher = W.W.

Too many consumers attempting to save (or pay down debt) simultaneously is called the [[paradox of thrift]] and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist [[Hyman Minsky]] also described a \"paradox of deleveraging\" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\">{{cite web|url=https://www.frbsf.org/our-district/press/presidents-speeches/yellen-speeches/2009/april/yellen-minsky-meltdown-central-bankers/|title=A Minsky Meltdown: Lessons for Central Bankers|website=Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco}}</ref>\n\nDuring April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair [[Janet Yellen]] discussed these paradoxes: \"Once this [[subprime mortgage crisis|massive credit crunch]] hit, it didn\u2019t take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse [[feedback]] loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms\u2014and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state\u2014nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.\"<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\" />\n\n==Predictors==\nThe U.S. Conference Board's Present Situation Index year-over-year change turns negative by more than 15 points before a recession.<ref>[http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2013/09/consumer-confidence-a-useful-indicator-of-the-labor-market.html Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Consumer Confidence: A Useful Indicator of . . . the Labor Market?]\nJason Bram, Robert Rich, and Joshua Abel ...

Strategies favored for moving an economy out of a recession vary depending on which economic school the policymakers follow. [[Monetarism|Monetarists]] would favor the use of expansionary [[monetary policy]], while [[Keynesian]] economists may advocate increased [[government spending]] to spark economic growth. [[Supply-side]] economists may suggest tax cuts to promote business [[capital (economics)|capital]] investment.  When interest rates reach the boundary of an interest rate of zero percent ([[zero interest-rate policy]]) conventional monetary policy can no longer be used and government must use other measures to stimulate recovery.  Keynesians argue that [[fiscal policy]]\u2014tax cuts or increased government spending\u2014works when monetary policy fails.  Spending is more effective because of its larger [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] but tax cuts take effect faster.\n\nFor example, [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in December 2010 that significant, sustained government spending was necessary because [[household debt|indebted households]] were paying down debts and unable to carry the U.S. economy as they had previously: \"The root of our current troubles lies in the debt American families ran up during the Bush-era housing bubble...highly indebted Americans not only can\u2019t spend the way they used to, they\u2019re having to pay down the debts they ran up in the bubble years. This would be fine if someone else were taking up the slack. But what\u2019s actually happening is that some people are spending much less while nobody is spending more \u2014 and this translates into a depressed economy and high unemployment. What the government should be doing in this situation is spending more while the private sector is spending less, supporting employment while those debts are paid down. And this government spending needs to be sustained...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/opinion/13krugman.html|title=Opinion \u2013 Block Those Economic Metaphors|first=Paul|last=Krugman|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Keynes on Government Response==\n[[John Maynard Keynes]] believed that government institutions could stimulate aggregate demand in a crisis. \n\u201cKeynes showed that if somehow the level of aggregate demand could be triggered, possibly by the government printing currency notes to employ people to dig holes and fill them up, the wages that would be paid out would resuscitate the economy by generating successive rounds of demand through the multiplier process\u201d<ref>Anatomy of the Financial Crisis: Between Keynes and Schumpeter. Economic and Political Weekly, 44</ref>\n==Schumpeter on Government Response==\nThe likely reason that [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s theories have not been called upon in an economic crisis is because his theory called for inaction in the face of recession. Schumpeter pointed out that rescission is a natural part of the business cycle that should be left to run its course. \u201cThe idea was that the best way to deal with an economic depression is to simply let things be and allow the inefficient units and institutions to either reform themselves or die out, and let the robust actors survive and in time prosper. This was very much akin to the Darwinian notion of self-selection and Schumpeter fundamentally concurred with this\u201d <ref> Anatomy of the Financial Crisis: Between Keynes and Schumpeter.

In ''[[Stocks for the Long Run]]'', Siegel mentions that since 1948, ten recessions were preceded by a stock market decline, by a lead time of 0 to 13 months (average 5.7 months), while ten stock market declines of greater than 10% in the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] were not followed by a recession.<ref>Siegel, Jeremy J.

Many economists working within the neoclassical paradigm argue that there is a [[natural rate of unemployment]] which, when subtracted from the actual rate of unemployment, can be used to calculate the negative [[GDP]] gap during a recession. In other words, unemployment never reaches 0 percent, and thus is not a negative indicator of the health of an economy unless above the \"natural rate,\" in which case it corresponds directly to a loss in the gross domestic product, or [[GDP]].<ref>[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SAYLOR.ORG-ECON102-UNEMPLOYMENT-RATE.pdf  Unemployment Rate] p. 1.

The unemployment level increased to 10.8%, employment declined by 3.4% and the GDP also decreased as much as 1.7%. Inflation, however, was successfully reduced.

This is when large numbers of consumers or corporations pay down debt (i.e., save) rather than spend or invest, which slows the economy. The term [[balance sheet]] derives from an accounting identity that holds that assets must always equal the sum of liabilities plus equity. If asset prices fall below the value of the debt incurred to purchase them, then the equity must be negative, meaning the consumer or corporation is insolvent. Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2014 that \"the best working hypothesis seems to be that the [[subprime mortgage crisis|financial crisis]] was only one manifestation of a broader problem of excessive debt\u2014that it was a so-called \"balance sheet recession\". In Krugman's view, such crises require debt reduction strategies combined with higher government spending to offset declines from the private sector as it pays down its debt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jul/10/geithner-does-he-pass-test/|title=Does He Pass the Test?|first=Paul|last=Krugman|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nFor example, economist Richard Koo wrote that Japan's \"Great Recession\" that began in 1990 was a \"balance sheet recession\". It was triggered by a collapse in land and stock prices, which caused Japanese firms to have [[negative equity]], meaning their assets were worth less than their liabilities. Despite zero [[interest rate]]s and expansion of the [[money supply]] to encourage borrowing, Japanese corporations in aggregate opted to pay down their debts from their own business earnings rather than borrow to invest as firms typically do. Corporate investment, a key demand component of GDP, fell enormously (22% of GDP) between 1990 and its peak decline in 2003. Japanese firms overall became net savers after 1998, as opposed to borrowers. Koo argues that it was massive fiscal stimulus (borrowing and spending by the government) that offset this decline and enabled Japan to maintain its level of GDP. In his view, this avoided a U.S. type [[Great Depression]], in which U.S. GDP fell by 46%. He argued that monetary policy was ineffective because there was limited demand for funds while firms paid down their liabilities.  In a balance sheet recession, GDP declines by the amount of debt repayment and un-borrowed individual savings, leaving government stimulus spending as the primary remedy.<ref name=\"Koo 2009\"/><ref name=\"Koo 2011\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Gregory White|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-koo-recession-2010-4#-1 |title=Presentation by Richard Koo \u2013 The Age of Balance Sheet Recessions |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=14 April 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue58/Koo58.pdf|title=Richard Koo \u2013 The World In Balance Sheet Recession \u2013 Real World Economics Review \u2013 December 2011|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nKrugman discussed the balance sheet recession concept during 2010, agreeing with Koo's situation assessment and view that sustained [[deficit spending]] when faced with a balance sheet recession would be appropriate. However, Krugman argued that monetary policy could also affect savings behavior, as inflation or credible promises of future inflation (generating negative real interest rates) would encourage less savings. In other words, people would tend to spend more rather than save if they believe inflation is on the horizon. In more technical terms, Krugman argues that the private sector savings curve is elastic even during a balance sheet recession (responsive to changes in real interest rates) disagreeing with Koo's view that it is inelastic (non-responsive to changes in real interest rates).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/notes-on-koo-wonkish/|title=Notes On Koo (Wonkish)|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/debt-deleveraging-and-liquidity-trap-new-model|title=Debt, deleveraging, and the liquidity trap|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=18 November 2010|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nA July 2012 survey of balance sheet recession research reported that consumer demand and employment are affected by [[Household debt|household leverage]] levels. Both durable and non-durable goods consumption declined as households moved from low to high leverage with the decline in property values experienced during the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. Further, reduced consumption due to higher household leverage can account for a significant decline in employment levels. Policies that help reduce mortgage debt or household leverage could therefore have stimulative effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/06/grim-natural-experiments/|title=Grim Natural Experiments|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nextnewdeal.net/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016030017/http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/new-report-literature-summary-new-balance-sheet-recession-research|url-status=dead|title=New Report: A Literature Summary on New Balance-Sheet Recession Research|archivedate=October 16, 2015|website=Next New Deal}}</ref>\n\n===Liquidity trap===\nA [[liquidity trap]] is a [[Keynesian]] theory that a situation can develop in which interest rates reach near zero ([[zero interest-rate policy]]) yet do not effectively stimulate the economy. In theory, near-zero interest rates should encourage firms and consumers to borrow and spend. However, if too many individuals or corporations focus on saving or paying down debt rather than spending, lower interest rates have less effect on investment and consumption behavior; the lower interest rates are like \"[[pushing on a string]]\". Economist [[Paul Krugman]] described the [[Subprime mortgage crisis|U.S. 2009 recession]] and [[Lost decade (Japan)|Japan's lost decade]] as liquidity traps. One remedy to a liquidity trap is expanding the money supply via [[quantitative easing]] or other techniques in which money is effectively printed to purchase assets, thereby creating [[inflationary]] expectations that cause savers to begin spending again. Government stimulus spending and [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] policies to stimulate exports and reduce imports are other techniques to stimulate demand.<ref name=\"Krugman 2009\">{{cite book\n| last = Krugman\n| first = Paul\n| year = 2009\n| title = The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008\n| publisher = W.W.

Too many consumers attempting to save (or pay down debt) simultaneously is called the [[paradox of thrift]] and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist [[Hyman Minsky]] also described a \"paradox of deleveraging\" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\">{{cite web|url=https://www.frbsf.org/our-district/press/presidents-speeches/yellen-speeches/2009/april/yellen-minsky-meltdown-central-bankers/|title=A Minsky Meltdown: Lessons for Central Bankers|website=Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco}}</ref>\n\nDuring April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair [[Janet Yellen]] discussed these paradoxes: \"Once this [[subprime mortgage crisis|massive credit crunch]] hit, it didn\u2019t take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse [[feedback]] loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms\u2014and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state\u2014nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.\"<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\" />\n\n==Predictors==\nThe U.S. Conference Board's Present Situation Index year-over-year change turns negative by more than 15 points before a recession.<ref>[http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2013/09/consumer-confidence-a-useful-indicator-of-the-labor-market.html Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Consumer Confidence: A Useful Indicator of . . . the Labor Market?]\nJason Bram, Robert Rich, and Joshua Abel ...

Strategies favored for moving an economy out of a recession vary depending on which economic school the policymakers follow. [[Monetarism|Monetarists]] would favor the use of expansionary [[monetary policy]], while [[Keynesian]] economists may advocate increased [[government spending]] to spark economic growth. [[Supply-side]] economists may suggest tax cuts to promote business [[capital (economics)|capital]] investment.  When interest rates reach the boundary of an interest rate of zero percent ([[zero interest-rate policy]]) conventional monetary policy can no longer be used and government must use other measures to stimulate recovery.  Keynesians argue that [[fiscal policy]]\u2014tax cuts or increased government spending\u2014works when monetary policy fails.  Spending is more effective because of its larger [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] but tax cuts take effect faster.\n\nFor example, [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in December 2010 that significant, sustained government spending was necessary because [[household debt|indebted households]] were paying down debts and unable to carry the U.S. economy as they had previously: \"The root of our current troubles lies in the debt American families ran up during the Bush-era housing bubble...highly indebted Americans not only can\u2019t spend the way they used to, they\u2019re having to pay down the debts they ran up in the bubble years. This would be fine if someone else were taking up the slack. But what\u2019s actually happening is that some people are spending much less while nobody is spending more \u2014 and this translates into a depressed economy and high unemployment. What the government should be doing in this situation is spending more while the private sector is spending less, supporting employment while those debts are paid down. And this government spending needs to be sustained...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/opinion/13krugman.html|title=Opinion \u2013 Block Those Economic Metaphors|first=Paul|last=Krugman|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Keynes on Government Response==\n[[John Maynard Keynes]] believed that government institutions could stimulate aggregate demand in a crisis. \n\u201cKeynes showed that if somehow the level of aggregate demand could be triggered, possibly by the government printing currency notes to employ people to dig holes and fill them up, the wages that would be paid out would resuscitate the economy by generating successive rounds of demand through the multiplier process\u201d<ref>Anatomy of the Financial Crisis: Between Keynes and Schumpeter. Economic and Political Weekly, 44</ref>\n==Schumpeter on Government Response==\nThe likely reason that [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s theories have not been called upon in an economic crisis is because his theory called for inaction in the face of recession. Schumpeter pointed out that rescission is a natural part of the business cycle that should be left to run its course. \u201cThe idea was that the best way to deal with an economic depression is to simply let things be and allow the inefficient units and institutions to either reform themselves or die out, and let the robust actors survive and in time prosper.

Many economists working within the neoclassical paradigm argue that there is a [[natural rate of unemployment]] which, when subtracted from the actual rate of unemployment, can be used to calculate the negative [[GDP]] gap during a recession. In other words, unemployment never reaches 0 percent, and thus is not a negative indicator of the health of an economy unless above the \"natural rate,\" in which case it corresponds directly to a loss in the gross domestic product, or [[GDP]].<ref>[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SAYLOR.ORG-ECON102-UNEMPLOYMENT-RATE.pdf  Unemployment Rate] p. 1.

The variation in [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] between firms rises sharply. The fall in productivity could also be attributed to several macro-economic factors, such as the loss in productivity observed across UK due to [[Brexit]], which may create a mini-recession in the region. [[Pandemic|Global epidemics]], such as [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], could be another example, since they disrupt the global supply chain or prevent movement of goods, services and people.\n\nRecessions have also provided opportunities for [[anti-competitive]] [[merger]]s, with a negative impact on the wider economy: the suspension of [[competition policy]] in the United States in the 1930s may have extended the Great Depression.<ref name=\"ESRC\" />\n\n===Social effects===\nThe [[living standards]] of people dependent on wages and [[salaries]] are not more affected by recessions than those who rely on [[fixed income]]s or [[welfare benefits]]. The loss of a job is known to have a negative impact on the stability of families, and individuals' health and well-being.

It fared better than other nations, that underwent [[depression (economics)|depressions]], but their poor economic states influenced Australia's as well, that depended on them for export, as well as [[foreign investments]]. The nation also benefited from bigger productivity in manufacturing, facilitated by trade protection, which also helped with feeling the effects less.\n\nDue to a credit squeeze, the economy had gone into a brief recession in 1961\nAustralia was facing a rising level of [[inflation]] in 1973, caused partially by the oil crisis happening in that same year, which brought inflation at a 13% increase. Economic recession hit by the middle of the year 1974, with no change in policy enacted by the government as a measure to counter the economic situation of the country. Consequently, the unemployment level rose and the trade deficit increased significantly.<ref>{{citation | title= Australian Economic Indicators | publisher = Australian Bureau of Statistics | date=27 February 1998 | url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/90a12181d877a6a6ca2568b5007b861c/d4a22ad91e0348bfca256fd3007baf93!OpenDocument }}</ref>\n\nAnother recession \u2013 the most recent one to date \u2013 came in the 1990s, at the beginning of the decade.

Although the collapse was larger than the one in 1929, the global economy recovered quickly, but North America still suffered a decline in lumbering savings and loans, which led to a crisis. The recession wasn't limited to only America, but it also affected partnering nations, such as Australia. The unemployment level increased to 10.8%, employment declined by 3.4% and the GDP also decreased as much as 1.7%. Inflation, however, was successfully reduced.
