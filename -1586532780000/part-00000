In 1972 Ferrari 365 GTB/4s took the first 5 places of the GT class.\n\nThe final major success of the car was in 1979 (five years after production ended), when a 1973 car achieved a class victory (2nd overall) in the [[24 Hours of Daytona]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\nIn 1971, the Daytona gained fame when one was driven by [[Dan Gurney]] and [[Brock Yates]] in the inaugural [[Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash]]. Showcasing the car's potential for sustained high speed travel, the pair won with an average speed of {{convert|80.1|mph|km/h|0.0}}, completing the distance from [[New York City]] to [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] - {{convert|2876|mi|km|0}} - in 35 hours 54 minutes. Gurney was later quoted as saying \"We never once exceeded 175 miles per hour.\"\n\nIt appears on the cover of 1973's ''[[Now & Then (The Carpenters album)|Now & Then]]'', the fifth studio album of the American pop band [[The Carpenters]]. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Ferrari 365 Daytona Spider Corvette Miami Vice replica\">\nFile:Ferrari-daytona-rc.jpg\nFile:Ferrari 365 Daytona Spider Corvette \"Miami Vice\" - I.jpg\nFile:Ferrari 365 Daytona Spider Corvette \"Miami Vice\" - II.jpg\nFile:Ferrari 365 Daytona Spider Corvette \"Miami Vice\" - III.jpg\n</gallery>\nIn the 1980s, a Daytona was prominently featured on the first two seasons of [[NBC]]'s hit television series ''[[Miami Vice]]''. The black car seen in early episodes was a replica built on a [[Corvette C3]] chassis. Altogether, two nearly identical cars were used simultaneously in the production of the TV series.

The Daytona replicas were retired at the beginning of the show's third season and replaced by two Ferrari-donated [[Ferrari Testarossa|Testarossas]], the company's newest flagship model at the time.\n\nIn 2004, the Daytona was voted top sports car of the 1970s by ''[[Sports Car International]]'' magazine.

The game follows [[janitor]] Ed, who drops a container of unidentified fluid from his spaceship to [[Earth]], transforming the planet into a mutated version of itself. Drunkard Gr\u00f6gh drinks from the container and is granted powers that lead him to conquer Earth. Assuming the role of Ed, the player is tasked with solving puzzles and defeating enemies to acquire the tools to conquer Gr\u00f6gh and repossess the container with the aim of creating an antidote.\n\n''Tonic Trouble'' was conceptualized by [[Michel Ancel]] and developed by a team of around 120 people, starting pre-production in June 1996. After multiple delays, the game was released for [[Nintendo 64]] in August 1999, with a [[Microsoft Windows]] version following that December. A [[Game Boy Color]] adaptation was made by RFX Interactive and released in Europe in 2000. ''Tonic Trouble'' received a mixed response from critics, who approved of the controls, score, level design, and graphics, but criticized the camera system, gameplay, visuals, and its derivative nature. The game sold 1.1 million copies.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Tonic Trouble gameplay.png|thumb|left|Ed traversing a [[ski slope]]]]\n''Tonic Trouble'' is an [[action-adventure game]] played from a [[third-person view]].<ref name=\"GI: Review\" /><ref name=\"GamePro: Review\" /> The playable character, Ed, navigates [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] environments through [[Platform game|platforming]] and entering portals, while wielding a [[Peashooter (toy)|peashooter]] (used in a [[First-person (gaming)|first-person]] perspective); new gadgets are rewarded as more levels are completed.<ref name=\"GI: Review\" /><ref name=\"GamePro: Review\" /><ref name=\"GameRev: Review\" /><ref name=\"GSpot: Review\" /> Gadgets are created by a \"[[mad doctor]]\" character,<ref name=\"NGen: Review\" /> who builds the peashooter, a [[bow tie]] that enables Ed to fly, a [[diving helmet]] for underwater exploration, a belt that functions as a [[cloaking device]] by letting him take the appearance of enemies, and a [[pogo stick]] that allows him to traverse lava and stomp open trap doors.<ref name=\"NintendoPower-1999\" /> There are six levels on the [[Game Boy Color]] version,<ref name=\"IGN: GBC Review\" /> contrary to the twelve featured in the [[Nintendo 64]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] versions.<ref name=\"IGN: N64 Review\" /><ref name=\"Jeuxvideo: Test\" /> \n\nEd can jump, climb, fly, swim, and crawl. To unlock the ability to kick and slap enemies, he must enlarge himself into Super Ed with popcorn [[consumables]].<ref name=\"GameRev: Review\" /><ref name=\"NintendoPower-1999\" /><ref name=\"IGN: N64 Review\" /> The [[health bar]] increases from obtaining golden thermometers.<ref name=\"IGN: GBC Review\" /> Ed can use a stick to beat enemies, activate switches, and pry open doorways to areas containing bonus items.<ref name=\"NintendoPower-1999\" /> [[Fetch quest]]s include collecting red orbs and other items;<ref name=\"GameRev: Review\" /><ref name=\"GSpot: Review\" /> solving puzzles can grant [[power-up]]s and help defeat enemies.<ref name=\"GamePro: Review\" /> Collecting bonus spheres will unlock a secret level.<ref name=\"NintendoPower-1999\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nEd, a purple alien working as a janitor on his mothership, finds himself cleaning a storage room. He starts hunting a bug, trying to squash it. Exhausted from the hunt, Ed proceeds to drink an unidentified liquid from a container, but as he spits it out onto the floor, screws come alive and open a trapdoor. The container falls through the door and down to Earth, polluting a river and causing the entire planet to mutate. Gr\u00f6gh, a drunkard sleeping nearby, swallows the liquid and gains supernatural powers that help him conquer Earth.\n\nShortly following the incident, Ed is recruited by resistance leader Agent Xyz to obtain the container so that an antidote can be created against the mutations. Ed takes a small spaceship to Earth to meet the inventor Doc and his daughter Suzy, who Xyz said would give aid in his mission. On his way there, he crashes into a snowy mountain, causing him to continue by sled. At the foot of the mountain, Ed takes the direct way to South Plain, where he encounters Suzy. She implores Ed to save her father, who was imprisoned by his own robot following the contamination.\n\nOnce liberated, the Doc informs Ed that before his capture, he was building a catapult that could get someone into Gr\u00f6gh's Castle and recover the container. However, Gr\u00f6gh's henchmen took the items required to finish the contraption, which the Doc instructs Ed to retrieve. The last item is stolen by an enemy called Magic Mushroom, but Ed defeats him. With the Doc's catapult completed, Ed is flung into Gr\u00f6gh's Castle, where he engages in battle against Gr\u00f6gh and wins. Ed reclaims the container, enabling him to finally remedy the infestation of Earth.\n\n== Development ==\n''Tonic Trouble'' was conceived and initially designed by [[Michel Ancel]], who had created ''[[Rayman (video game)|Rayman]]'' in 1995.<ref name=\"EGM: Previews\" /> Ancel was largely inspired by the storyline of ''[[Day of the Tentacle]]'' and the world-travelling mechanic from ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]''.<ref name=\"IGN: Q & A\" /><ref name=\"IGN: Intro\" /> Starting pre-production in June 1996,<ref name=\"IGN: Q & A\" /> ''Tonic Trouble'' was the first project to be developed by the previously established [[Ubi Soft Montreal]],<ref name=\"GRadar: Montreal\" /> which devoted a team of sixty [[Video game programmer|programmers]], thirty [[animator]]s, twelve [[level designer]]s, twelve [[Video game artist|3D artists]], and four audio department employees.<ref name=\"IGN: Team\" /> The [[game engine]], known as \"Architecture Commune Programmation\",<ref name=\"IGN: Q & A\" /> was built by fifty in-house staff over a course of eighteen months, with a total cost of {{US$|4&nbsp;million|link=yes}}.<ref name=\"CSoon: Engine\" /> Using the engine, the developers wanted to take full advantage of [[Intel]]'s newest [[Pentium II]] generation of [[central processing unit]]s.<ref name=\"IGN: Q & A\" /> ''Tonic Trouble'' was one of the first games to be distributed on [[DVD-ROM]],<ref name=\"Wired: Just Outta\" /> a rarity at the time.<ref name=\"NGen: Alpha\" /> The additional storage of DVDs allowed Ubi Soft to include a longer introduction and more music tracks.<ref name=\"Boot: Pony\" /> Designer Pierre Olivier Clement stated that the design team aimed at making the player rationalize every step they took, contrary to what was done in games like ''[[Duke Nukem]]'' and ''[[Quake (series)|Quake]]''.<ref name=\"IGN: Q & A\" /> Furthermore, they opted to differentiate the game from its sister project, ''[[Rayman 2: The Great Escape]]'', by focusing more strongly on [[Adventure game|adventure]], whereas ''Rayman 2'' relied on [[action game|action]].<ref name=\"IGN: Interview\" /> The soundtrack was created in six months by [[Video game composer|composer]] Eric Chevalier and five in-house [[Audio engineer|sound editors]].<ref name=\"IGN: Q & A\" />\n\nThe game was first previewed as Ubi Soft's first Nintendo 64 title in ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]''{{'s}} January 1997 issue, under the working title \"''HED''{{-\"}} (then also the protagonist's name),<ref name=\"EGM: HED\" /> and later listed on Ubi Soft's website as ''Ed''.<ref name=\"IGN: Mystery\" /> By that time, it had already been renamed eight times.<ref name=\"IGN: December\" /> The game was announced by Ubi Soft in April 1997, with a release slated for December 1997.<ref name=\"IGN: December\" /> The company held an online contest to determine the final name;<ref name=\"IGN: December\" /> the name \"''Tonic Trouble''\" was chosed by late April.<ref name=\"IGN: Identity\" /> It premiered as a Nintendo 64 and Microsoft Windows title at June 1997's [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3), revealing it would have four-player [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative multiplayer]] and a [[64DD]] add-on once the [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] version had been released,<ref name=\"IGN: 64DD\" /><ref name=\"IGN: What\" /> however, representatives later stated an unwillingness to focus on the 64DD, explaining that the device was still in development and puzzle-solving gameplay was incompatible with multiplayer.<ref name=\"IGN: Q & A\" /> Critics noticed early that ''Tonic Trouble'' strongly resembled the appeal of ''Rayman'', judging from Ed's limbless design, the colourful worlds, and similar platforming gameplay, though renewed in [[3D computer graphics|3D]], in contrast to ''Rayman''{{'s}} [[2D computer graphics|2D]] visuals.<ref name=\"IGN: Screen-shots\" /> Ubi Soft also entered into a partnership with [[Newman's Own]] in May 1998, which would see ''Tonic Trouble''{{'s}} Microsoft Windows include a package of Newman's Own Popcorn in the retail box, as well as Newman's Own branding on the popcorn dispensers within the game.<ref name=\"GSpot: Newman's\" />{{efn|In some versions, the dispensers bear [[Nestl\u00e9 Crunch]] branding instead.<ref name=\"IGN: PC Review\" />}} In November 1998, Newman's Own started packing {{US$|10|long=no}} [[Rebate (marketing)|rebate]] coupons for ''Tonic Trouble'' with four million boxes of its popcorn products, where the coupons would expire on 1 June 1999.<ref name=\"GSpot: Tonic Corn\" /> For every coupon redeemed with Ubi Soft, the company was to donate {{US$|1|long=no}} to the [[Hole in the Wall Gang Camp]] in France.<ref name=\"GSpot: Tonic Corn\" />\n\n''Tonic Trouble'' saw multiple delays, with its release being publicly pushed back to early 1998 by November 1997,<ref name=\"CSoon: Engine\" /> April 1998 by March 1998,<ref name=\"Wired: Just Outta\" /> June 1998 by April 1998,<ref name=\"IGN: Q & A\" /> Q4 1998 by May 1998,<ref name=\"IGN: Interview\" /> and 15 February 1999 by November 1998.<ref name=\"GSpot: Preview\" /> According to an editor at ''[[IGN]]'', the version shown at E3 was in a rough state, lacking animation and suffering heavily from low [[framerate]]s and stiff controls, though all of these issues had been resolved by the time they received a new preview copy in December 1998.<ref name=\"IGN: Framerate\" /> From 9\u201311 October 1998, it was exhibited at the [[Tokyo Game Show]] (TGS) alongside ''Rayman 2''.<ref name=\"IGN: TGS\" /> A critic from ''IGN'' noted that, although both showed great attention to detail, ''Rayman 2'' looked \"significantly sharper\".<ref name=\"IGN: Strings\" /> Early versions were distributed as part of the software bundles shipped with [[graphics card]]s, including those of the [[Matrox G200|Marvel G200-TV]], Mystique 200, and Marvel G400-TV models by [[Matrox]],<ref name=\"PCM: Matrox\" /><ref name=\"GSpot: Matrox\" /><ref name=\"MaxPC: Matrox\" /><ref name=\"MaxPC: VCR\" /> and Guillemot's MaxiGamer Phoenix PCI.<ref name=\"MaxPC: Banshee\" /><ref name=\"GSpot: Banshee\" /> Around February 1999, it was rumoured that ''Tonic Trouble'' and ''Rayman 2'' would be releasing for [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]],<ref name=\"IGN: Record\" /> with that year's TGS line-up also shortlisting such versions for both games.<ref name=\"IGN: Record\" /> In March 1999, Ubi Soft acquired a [[Dolby Pro Logic]] surround sound licence for usage within ''Tonic Trouble'' and ''Rayman 2''.<ref name=\"IGN: Surround\" /> ''Tonic Trouble'' was released for Nintendo 64 on 31 August 1999 and Microsoft Windows on 7 December 1999.<ref name=\"Ubi Soft NA: N64\" /><ref name=\"IGN: PC Review\" /> An eponymous Game Boy Color counterpart was developed by RFX Interactive and first shown at France's Milia [[Trade fair|expo]] in February 2000.<ref name=\"IGN: GBC Review\" /><ref name=\"IGN: Milia\" /> The conversion featured the same cast and story as the main game, while the gameplay was adapted from 3D to 2D.<ref name=\"GSpot: GBC\" /> It was released for Game Boy Color the same year, exclusively in Europe; Ubi Soft did not plan to bring it to the United States.<ref name=\"IGN: GBC Review\" /><ref name=\"GameRankings: GBC\" /> A potential sequel to ''Tonic Trouble'', titled ''Tonic Adventure'', was planned but later abandoned.<ref name=\"Unseen64: Tonic Adventure\" /> The only known remnants of this was Ubi Soft artist Yann Jouette's [[concept art]].<ref

reception upon release, according to review aggregator [[GameRankings]].<ref name=\"GameRankings: N64\" /><ref name=\"GameRankings: PC\" /> It sold 1.1 million copies as of 2001.<ref name=\"Industrial Brands\" /> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' thought that, in terms of level design, ''Tonic Trouble'' was \"a tightly developed platformer\"; the control scheme was similarly praised.<ref name=\"EGM: Review\" /> ''[[Game Informer]]'' wrote that the \"wide variety\" of gameplay and \"solid\" controls would be enjoyable to platformer fans.<ref name=\"GI: Review\" /> ''[[GamePro]]'' commended the musical score and sound effects, noting the puzzles as what kept the gameplay \"diverse\" and \"challenging\".<ref name=\"GamePro: Review\" /> Suzi Sez, reviewing the PC version for ''GameZone'', enjoyed ''Tonic Trouble''{{'s}} \"stunning\" 3D graphics, \"great\" sound effects and music, \"cute and fun\" storyline, and unrelenting [[replay value]].<ref name=\"GameZone: Review\" /> ''IGN''{{'s}} Matt Casamassina considered the visuals to be \"good\", the characters and levels to be \"well designed\", and the music to be one of the game's strong points.<ref name=\"IGN: N64 Review\" /> ''IGN''{{'s}} Game Boy Color review of ''Tonic Trouble'', written by Tim Jones, described the controls as \"tight and responsive\" and the humor and visuals as \"enjoyable\". Jones thought the graphics, seen as \"clear\" and colourful, complemented the level design, adding that the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] boasted \"excellent\" and detailed animation. He felt the music was also well made.<ref name=\"IGN: GBC Review\" /> Jeffrey Adam Young of ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' approved of the game world and its blend of platforming, exploration, and puzzle-solving elements. In agreement with Jones, Young lauded the \"responsive\" controls as well as the humor.<ref name=\"NGen: Review\" /> ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' appreciated that the controls made the characters and world more enjoyable. The music was said to offer a sufficient match for the graphics.<ref name=\"NP: Review\" />\n\nConversely, ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' blamed the Nintendo 64 for the visual shortcomings, criticized boss battles for their lack of difficulty, and saw the music as insignificant, while also calling the main character \"annoying\" and camera system \"confusing\".<ref name=\"EGM: Review\" /> ''Game Informer'' disliked the graphics and noted some camera problems.<ref name=\"GI: Review\" /> ''GamePro'' disparaged the \"sparse textures\" and \"low-res and fuzzy\" characters, whose voices were regarded as \"forced\". Their primary issue was with the controls for being incongruent with the camera.<ref name=\"GamePro: Review\" /> Johnny Liu of ''[[GameRevolution]]'' gave Ed the award for \"Worst Video Game Character of 1999\", citing an \"awful performance in the equally bad game\". He slighted the \"inane\" story and unrefined controls, agreeing with other critics on the \"irritating\" camera angles and \"jumbled\" visuals.<ref name=\"GameRev: Review\" /> ''[[GameSpot|VideoGames.com]]''{{'s}} Ben Stahl declared ''Tonic Trouble'' \"a shining example of how not to do a platform game\". He termed most the colours of the environments as \"an eyesore\", the graphics as \"simply horrible\", and the level design as \"bland and unoriginal\". Disagreeing with ''GamePro'', the soundtrack was rather interpreted as \"cheesy\" and of low production value. Stahl expressed disdain for the lack of sound effects, felt the gameplay was \"downright lame\", and also met hardship with the camera.<ref name=\"GSpot: Review\" /> Casamassina dubbed ''Tonic Trouble'' the [[S. S. Minnow|S. S. ''Minnow'']] to ''Rayman 2''{{'s}} [[MS Pacific|Love Boat]], observing the \"generic feel\" as its largest obstacle. Echoing Stahl, Casamassina found there to be too few sound effects.<ref name=\"IGN: N64 Review\" /> Reviewing the game on PC, Vincent Lopez of ''IGN'' compared the game to ''Rayman 2'' like Casamassina, faulting ''Tonic Trouble'' for being too much like past platformers. The camera was subject to reproval for how it would inherently worsen the gameplay experience, adding to his dissatisfaction with the \"wonky\" controls.<ref name=\"IGN: PC Review\" /> Jones derided the game's \"shamelessly derivative\" nature.<ref name=\"IGN: GBC Review\" /> ''Nintendo Power'' complained about certain areas where \"hit detection\" failed to give effect.<ref name=\"NP: Review\"

Soft Montreal]] and published by [[Ubi Soft]]. The game follows [[janitor]] Ed, who drops a container of unidentified fluid from his spaceship to [[Earth]], transforming the planet into a mutated version of itself. Drunkard Gr\u00f6gh drinks from the container and is granted powers that lead him to conquer Earth. Assuming the role of Ed, the player is tasked with solving puzzles and defeating enemies to acquire the tools to conquer Gr\u00f6gh and repossess the container with the aim of creating an antidote.\n\n''Tonic Trouble'' was conceptualized by [[Michel Ancel]] and developed by a team of around 120 people, starting pre-production in June 1996. After multiple delays, the game was released for [[Nintendo 64]] in August 1999, with a [[Microsoft Windows]] version following that December. A [[Game Boy Color]] adaptation was made by RFX Interactive and released in Europe in 2000. ''Tonic Trouble'' received a mixed response from critics, who approved of the controls, score, level design, and graphics, but criticized the camera system, gameplay, visuals, and its derivative nature. The game sold 1.1 million copies.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Tonic Trouble gameplay.png|thumb|left|Ed traversing a [[ski slope]]]]\n''Tonic Trouble'' is an [[action-adventure game]] played from a [[third-person view]].<ref name=\"GI: Review\" /><ref name=\"GamePro: Review\" /> The playable character, Ed, navigates [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] environments through [[Platform game|platforming]] and entering portals, while wielding a [[Peashooter (toy)|peashooter]] (used in a [[First-person (gaming)|first-person]] perspective); new gadgets are rewarded as more levels are completed.<ref name=\"GI: Review\" /><ref name=\"GamePro: Review\" /><ref name=\"GameRev: Review\" /><ref name=\"GSpot: Review\" /> Gadgets are created by a \"[[mad doctor]]\" character,<ref name=\"NGen: Review\" /> who builds the peashooter, a [[bow tie]] that enables Ed to fly, a [[diving helmet]] for underwater exploration, a belt that functions as a [[cloaking device]] by letting him take the appearance of enemies, and a [[pogo stick]] that allows him to traverse lava and stomp open trap doors.<ref name=\"NintendoPower-1999\" /> There are six levels on the [[Game Boy Color]] version,<ref name=\"IGN: GBC Review\" /> contrary to the twelve featured in the [[Nintendo 64]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] versions.<ref name=\"IGN: N64 Review\" /><ref name=\"Jeuxvideo: Test\" /> \n\nEd can jump, climb, fly, swim, and crawl.

He starts hunting a bug, trying to squash it. Exhausted from the hunt, Ed proceeds to drink an unidentified liquid from a container, but as he spits it out onto the floor, screws come alive and open a trapdoor. The container falls through the door and down to Earth, polluting a river and causing the entire planet to mutate. Gr\u00f6gh, a drunkard sleeping nearby, swallows the liquid and gains supernatural powers that help him conquer Earth.\n\nShortly following the incident, Ed is recruited by resistance leader Agent Xyz to obtain the container so that an antidote can be created against the mutations. Ed takes a small spaceship to Earth to meet the inventor Doc and his daughter Suzy, who Xyz said would give aid in his mission. On his way there, he crashes into a snowy mountain, causing him to continue by sled. At the foot of the mountain, Ed takes the direct way to South Plain, where he encounters Suzy. She implores Ed to save her father, who was imprisoned by his own robot following the contamination.\n\nOnce liberated, the Doc informs Ed that before his capture, he was building a catapult that could get someone into Gr\u00f6gh's Castle and recover the container. However, Gr\u00f6gh's henchmen took the items required to finish the contraption, which the Doc instructs Ed to retrieve. The last item is stolen by an enemy called Magic Mushroom, but Ed defeats him. With the Doc's catapult completed, Ed is flung into Gr\u00f6gh's Castle, where he engages in battle against Gr\u00f6gh and wins. Ed reclaims the container, enabling him to finally remedy the infestation of Earth.\n\n== Development ==\n''Tonic Trouble'' was conceived and initially designed by [[Michel Ancel]], who had created ''[[Rayman (video game)|Rayman]]'' in 1995.<ref name=\"EGM: Previews\" /> Ancel was largely inspired by the storyline of ''[[Day of the Tentacle]]'' and the world-travelling mechanic from ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]''.<ref name=\"IGN: Q & A\" /><ref name=\"IGN: Intro\" /> Starting pre-production in June 1996,<ref name=\"IGN: Q & A\" /> ''Tonic Trouble'' was the first project to be developed by the previously established [[Ubi Soft Montreal]],<ref name=\"GRadar: Montreal\" /> which devoted a team of sixty [[Video game programmer|programmers]], thirty [[animator]]s, twelve [[level designer]]s, twelve [[Video game artist|3D artists]], and four audio department employees.<ref name=\"IGN: Team\" /> The [[game engine]], known as \"Architecture Commune Programmation\",<ref name=\"IGN: Q & A\" /> was built by fifty in-house staff over a course of eighteen months, with a total cost of {{US$|4&nbsp;million|link=yes}}.<ref name=\"CSoon: Engine\" /> Using the engine, the developers wanted to take full advantage of [[Intel]]'s newest [[Pentium II]] generation of [[central processing unit]]s.<ref name=\"IGN: Q & A\" /> ''Tonic Trouble'' was one of the first games to be distributed on [[DVD-ROM]],<ref name=\"Wired: Just Outta\" /> a rarity at the time.<ref name=\"NGen: Alpha\" /> The additional storage of DVDs allowed Ubi Soft to include a longer introduction and more music tracks.<ref name=\"Boot: Pony\" /> Designer Pierre Olivier Clement stated that the design team aimed at making the player rationalize every step they took, contrary to what was done in games like ''[[Duke Nukem]]'' and ''[[Quake (series)|Quake]]''.<ref name=\"IGN: Q & A\" /> Furthermore, they opted to differentiate the game from its sister project, ''[[Rayman 2: The Great Escape]]'', by focusing more strongly on [[Adventure game|adventure]], whereas ''Rayman 2'' relied on [[action game|action]].<ref name=\"IGN: Interview\" /> The soundtrack was created in six months by [[Video game composer|composer]] Eric Chevalier and five in-house [[Audio engineer|sound editors]].<ref name=\"IGN: Q & A\" />\n\nThe game was first previewed as Ubi Soft's first Nintendo 64 title in ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]''{{'s}} January 1997 issue, under the working title \"''HED''{{-\"}} (then also the protagonist's name),<ref name=\"EGM: HED\" /> and later listed on Ubi Soft's website as ''Ed''.<ref name=\"IGN: Mystery\" /> By that time, it had already been renamed eight times.<ref name=\"IGN: December\" /> The game was announced by Ubi Soft in April 1997, with a release slated for December 1997.<ref name=\"IGN: December\" /> The company held an online contest to determine the final name;<ref name=\"IGN: December\" /> the name \"''Tonic Trouble''\" was chosed by late April.<ref name=\"IGN: Identity\" /> It premiered as a Nintendo 64 and Microsoft Windows title at June 1997's [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3), revealing it would have four-player [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative multiplayer]] and a [[64DD]] add-on once the [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] version had been released,<ref name=\"IGN: 64DD\" /><ref name=\"IGN: What\" /> however, representatives later stated an unwillingness to focus on the 64DD, explaining that the device was still in development and puzzle-solving gameplay was incompatible with multiplayer.<ref name=\"IGN: Q & A\" /> Critics noticed early that ''Tonic Trouble'' strongly resembled the appeal of ''Rayman'', judging from Ed's limbless design, the colourful worlds, and similar platforming gameplay, though renewed in [[3D computer graphics|3D]], in contrast to ''Rayman''{{'s}} [[2D computer graphics|2D]] visuals.<ref name=\"IGN: Screen-shots\" /> Ubi Soft also entered into a partnership with [[Newman's Own]] in May 1998, which would see ''Tonic Trouble''{{'s}} Microsoft Windows include a package of Newman's Own Popcorn in the retail box, as well as Newman's Own branding on the popcorn dispensers within the game.<ref name=\"GSpot: Newman's\" />{{efn|In some versions, the dispensers bear [[Nestl\u00e9 Crunch]] branding instead.<ref name=\"IGN: PC Review\" />}} In November 1998, Newman's Own started packing {{US$|10|long=no}} [[Rebate (marketing)|rebate]] coupons for ''Tonic Trouble'' with four million boxes of its popcorn products, where the coupons would expire on 1 June 1999.<ref name=\"GSpot: Tonic Corn\" /> For every coupon redeemed with Ubi Soft, the company was to donate {{US$|1|long=no}} to the [[Hole in the Wall Gang Camp]] in France.<ref name=\"GSpot: Tonic Corn\" />\n\n''Tonic Trouble'' saw multiple delays, with its release being publicly pushed back to early 1998 by November 1997,<ref name=\"CSoon: Engine\" /> April 1998 by March 1998,<ref name=\"Wired: Just Outta\" /> June 1998 by April 1998,<ref name=\"IGN: Q & A\" /> Q4 1998 by May 1998,<ref name=\"IGN: Interview\" /> and 15 February 1999 by November 1998.<ref name=\"GSpot: Preview\" /> According to an editor at ''[[IGN]]'', the version shown at E3 was in a rough state, lacking animation and suffering heavily from low [[framerate]]s and stiff controls, though all of these issues had been resolved by the time they received a new preview copy in December 1998.<ref name=\"IGN: Framerate\" /> From 9\u201311 October 1998, it was exhibited at the [[Tokyo Game Show]] (TGS) alongside ''Rayman 2''.<ref name=\"IGN: TGS\" /> A critic from ''IGN'' noted that, although both showed great attention to detail, ''Rayman 2'' looked \"significantly sharper\".<ref name=\"IGN: Strings\" /> Early versions were distributed as part of the software bundles shipped with [[graphics card]]s, including those of the [[Matrox G200|Marvel G200-TV]], Mystique 200, and Marvel G400-TV models by [[Matrox]],<ref name=\"PCM: Matrox\" /><ref name=\"GSpot: Matrox\" /><ref name=\"MaxPC: Matrox\" /><ref name=\"MaxPC: VCR\" /> and Guillemot's MaxiGamer Phoenix PCI.<ref name=\"MaxPC: Banshee\" /><ref name=\"GSpot: Banshee\" /> Around February 1999, it was rumoured that ''Tonic Trouble'' and ''Rayman 2'' would be releasing for [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]],<ref name=\"IGN: Record\" /> with that year's TGS line-up also shortlisting such versions for both games.<ref name=\"IGN: Record\" /> In March 1999, Ubi Soft acquired a [[Dolby Pro Logic]] surround sound licence for usage within ''Tonic Trouble'' and ''Rayman 2''.<ref name=\"IGN: Surround\" /> ''Tonic Trouble'' was released for Nintendo 64 on 31 August 1999 and Microsoft Windows on 7 December 1999.<ref name=\"Ubi Soft NA: N64\" /><ref name=\"IGN: PC Review\" /> An eponymous Game Boy Color counterpart was developed by RFX Interactive and first shown at France's Milia [[Trade fair|expo]] in February 2000.<ref name=\"IGN: GBC Review\" /><ref name=\"IGN: Milia\" /> The conversion featured the same cast and story as the main game, while the gameplay was adapted from 3D to 2D.<ref name=\"GSpot: GBC\" /> It was released for Game Boy Color the same year, exclusively in Europe; Ubi Soft did not plan to bring it to the United States.<ref name=\"IGN: GBC Review\" /><ref name=\"GameRankings: GBC\" /> A potential sequel to ''Tonic Trouble'', titled ''Tonic Adventure'', was planned but later abandoned.<ref name=\"Unseen64: Tonic Adventure\" /> The only known remnants of this was Ubi Soft artist Yann Jouette's [[concept art]].<ref

reception upon release, according to review aggregator [[GameRankings]].<ref name=\"GameRankings: N64\" /><ref name=\"GameRankings: PC\" /> It sold 1.1 million copies as of 2001.<ref name=\"Industrial Brands\" /> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' thought that, in terms of level design, ''Tonic Trouble'' was \"a tightly developed platformer\"; the control scheme was similarly praised.<ref name=\"EGM: Review\" /> ''[[Game Informer]]'' wrote that the \"wide variety\" of gameplay and \"solid\" controls would be enjoyable to platformer fans.<ref name=\"GI: Review\" /> ''[[GamePro]]'' commended the musical score and sound effects, noting the puzzles as what kept the gameplay \"diverse\" and \"challenging\".<ref name=\"GamePro: Review\" /> Suzi Sez, reviewing the PC version for ''GameZone'', enjoyed ''Tonic Trouble''{{'s}} \"stunning\" 3D graphics, \"great\" sound effects and music, \"cute and fun\" storyline, and unrelenting [[replay value]].<ref name=\"GameZone: Review\" /> ''IGN''{{'s}} Matt Casamassina considered the visuals to be \"good\", the characters and levels to be \"well designed\", and the music to be one of the game's strong points.<ref name=\"IGN: N64 Review\" /> ''IGN''{{'s}} Game Boy Color review of ''Tonic Trouble'', written by Tim Jones, described the controls as \"tight and responsive\" and the humor and visuals as \"enjoyable\". Jones thought the graphics, seen as \"clear\" and colourful, complemented the level design, adding that the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] boasted \"excellent\" and detailed animation. He felt the music was also well made.<ref name=\"IGN: GBC Review\" /> Jeffrey Adam Young of ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' approved of the game world and its blend of platforming, exploration, and puzzle-solving elements. In agreement with Jones, Young lauded the \"responsive\" controls as well as the humor.<ref name=\"NGen: Review\" /> ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' appreciated that the controls made the characters and world more enjoyable. The music was said to offer a sufficient match for the graphics.<ref name=\"NP: Review\" />\n\nConversely, ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' blamed the Nintendo 64 for the visual shortcomings, criticized boss battles for their lack of difficulty, and saw the music as insignificant, while also calling the main character \"annoying\" and camera system \"confusing\".<ref name=\"EGM: Review\" /> ''Game Informer'' disliked the graphics and noted some camera problems.<ref name=\"GI: Review\" /> ''GamePro'' disparaged the \"sparse textures\" and \"low-res and fuzzy\" characters, whose voices were regarded as \"forced\". Their primary issue was with the controls for being incongruent with the camera.<ref name=\"GamePro: Review\" /> Johnny Liu of ''[[Game Revolution]]'' gave Ed the award for \"Worst Video Game Character of 1999\", citing an \"awful performance in the equally bad game\". He slighted the \"inane\" story and unrefined controls, agreeing with other critics on the \"irritating\" camera angles and \"jumbled\" visuals.<ref name=\"GameRev: Review\" /> ''[[GameSpot|VideoGames.com]]''{{'s}} Ben Stahl declared ''Tonic Trouble'' \"a shining example of how not to do a platform game\". He termed most the colours of the environments as \"an eyesore\", the graphics as \"simply horrible\", and the level design as \"bland and unoriginal\". Disagreeing with ''GamePro'', the soundtrack was rather interpreted as \"cheesy\" and of low production value. Stahl expressed disdain for the lack of sound effects, felt the gameplay was \"downright lame\", and also met hardship with the camera.<ref name=\"GSpot: Review\" /> Casamassina dubbed ''Tonic Trouble'' the [[S. S. Minnow|S. S. ''Minnow'']] to ''Rayman 2''{{'s}} [[MS Pacific|Love Boat]], observing the \"generic feel\" as its largest obstacle. Echoing Stahl, Casamassina found there to be too few sound effects.<ref name=\"IGN: N64 Review\" /> Reviewing the game on PC, Vincent Lopez of ''IGN'' compared the game to ''Rayman 2'' like Casamassina, faulting ''Tonic Trouble'' for being too much like past platformers. The camera was subject to reproval for how it would inherently worsen the gameplay experience, adding to his dissatisfaction with the \"wonky\" controls.<ref name=\"IGN: PC Review\" /> Jones derided the game's \"shamelessly derivative\" nature.<ref name=\"IGN: GBC Review\" /> ''Nintendo Power'' complained about certain areas where \"hit detection\" failed to give effect.<ref name=\"NP: Review\"

It starred [[Shia LaBeouf]], [[Elden Henson]], [[Kathleen Quinlan]], [[Amy Smart]], and [[Shiri Appleby]]. The film was the winning script for the second season of ''[[Project Greenlight]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nKelly Ernswiler, a young [[Combat reenactment|war reenactment]] enthusiast, works at his local store with love interest Sarah and Bart Bowland. Kelly's father, Abe, works with [[Drug addiction|drug addict]]s, being clean himself for over 5 years. His mother, Eve, is a [[commercial art]]ist. \n\nKelly attempts to woo Bart's older sister, Tabby, even though she's set to marry Miner Weber, a handsome businessman. Kelly becomes a regular at Bart's house, being over for dinner often, and he impresses Bart's father, Harrison, with their common fondness for war memorabilia, and Bart's mother by complimenting her on her flowers, and he often talks to Tabby in her workshop. During this time, Sarah asks him to go to an [[Aerosmith]] concert, which she has a spare ticket for, telling him it would be good for him to get out more. When he bluntly makes it clear that he knows it would be a date, he tells her he is seeing someone else, obviously meaning Tabby. Before Kelly and Bart perform their plan for Lance's humiliation, Bart makes it clear to Kelly that he knows he has \"his own agenda\", at which Kelly is insulted and angry, and Bart displaces it as \"pre-mission nervous energy\". They recreate an invasion on the street where Lance lives and drag him out of the house pointing guns at him and shouting at him with German accents. They videotape the whole thing and he urinates out of fear.\n\nAfterwards, the boys are drinking whiskey at Bart's house and Bart passes out in a chair by the fire. Kelly makes to go home and goes to the workshop to say goodbye to Tabby. He walks in on her crying, as she now thinks the marriage will be off and goes to comfort her, and they kiss. As Kelly is leaving, Bart sees him and is furious as he knew he was in the workshop. The next day, as Kelly is on a set for a war program that Bart got them in, Bart hasn't turned up. Kelly is cast in a role to be a jeep driver and when his cue is called, Bart turns up out of the bushes and confronts him about Tabby. Kelly denies it at first and then becomes speechless. As he is about to drive for his cue, Bart attacks him in the jeep and they make a mess of the set.\n\nThe next day, Abe is taken into care again for relapsing and Kelly is emotionless. He goes to the wedding the same day, only to have an annoyed Bart tell him that he can't let him in. He sneaks into Tabby's limo before it pulls in and he talks to her, and it is a moment in which he finally realizes he must grow up. He gets out of the car and everyone at the wedding sees him and are all confused. He goes round the back of the church to get his bike and leave and meets Minor again, who has no idea of what happened with Kelly and Tabby, and is civil towards him. Kelly cycles to the clinic where his father is staying and is surprised. They begin to watch television and his mother walks in and is surprised and happy to see Kelly.\n\nIn the end, it shows the voicemail message where Kelly apologizes to the Bowlands for his behavior and asks Bart if he will meet him where he will be selling all his old memorabilia, and gives a hat Bart acquired for him back. He is shown walking down the street with Sarah and they hold hands. Kelly sees Lance again on his lawn where they faked the invasion, and goes over to him and confesses, only to be punched in the jaw. The film ends with Kelly lying on the lawn, holding his bruised jaw saying, \"I deserved it\".\n\n==Filming Locations==\nThe film was shot in and around the greater Los Angeles region.  Sites included the Los Angeles County Arboretum, Reseda and Santa Monica.  No live action footage featuring the stars was filmed in [[Shaker Heights, Ohio]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Kelly Ernswiler\n* [[Elden Henson]] as Bart Bowland\n* [[Amy Smart]] as Tabitha \"Tabby\" Bowland \n* [[Shiri Appleby]] as Sarah\n* [[Kathleen Quinlan]] as Eve Ernswiler\n* [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]] as Abraham \"Abe\" Ernswiler\n* [[Ray Wise]] as Harrison Bowland\n* [[Dana Wheeler-Nicholson]] as Mathilda Bowland\n* [[Billy Kay (actor)|Billy Kay]] as Lance Norway\n* [[Mike McShane|Michael McShane]] as Mr. Norway\n* [[Anson Mount]] as Miner Weber\n* Hattie Wilson as Principal Holmstead\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Sources\n* \"Shaker lends only its name; weather gets blame\", ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'', August 24, 2003.\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0357470|The Battle of Shaker Heights}}\n* {{allrovi movie|281578|The Battle of Shaker Heights}}\n* {{mojo title|battleofshakerheights|The Battle of Shaker Heights}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|battle_of_shaker_heights|The Battle of Shaker Heights}}\n* {{metacritic film|the-battle-of-shaker-heights|The Battle of Shaker Heights}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battle Of Shaker Heights, The}}\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:2000s comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:2000s independent films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:German-language films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Ben Affleck]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Matt Damon]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2003 film by Efram Potelle, Kyle Rankin}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Battle of Shaker Heights\n| image          = Poster of the movie The Battle of Shaker Heights.jpg\n| image_size     = 215px\n| alt            = \n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| director       = [[Efram Potelle]]<br />[[Kyle Rankin]]\n| producer       = [[Ben Affleck]]<br />[[Matt Damon]]\n| writer         = [[Erica Beeney]]\n| starring       = [[Shia LaBeouf]]<br />[[Elden Henson]]<br />[[Amy Smart]]<br />[[Shiri Appleby]]<br />[[Kathleen Quinlan]]<br />[[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]\n| music          = [[Richard Marvin (composer)|Richard Marvin]]\n| cinematography = [[Thomas E.

They videotape the whole thing and he urinates out of fear.\n\nAfterwards, the boys are drinking whiskey at Bart's house and Bart passes out in a chair by the fire. Kelly makes to go home and goes to the workshop to say goodbye to Tabby. He walks in on her crying, as she now thinks the marriage will be off and goes to comfort her, and they kiss. As Kelly is leaving, Bart sees him and is furious as he knew he was in the workshop. The next day, as Kelly is on a set for a war program that Bart got them in, Bart hasn't turned up. Kelly is cast in a role to be a jeep driver and when his cue is called, Bart turns up out of the bushes and confronts him about Tabby. Kelly denies it at first and then becomes speechless. As he is about to drive for his cue, Bart attacks him in the jeep and they make a mess of the set.\n\nThe next day, Abe is taken into care again for relapsing and Kelly is emotionless. He goes to the wedding the same day, only to have an annoyed Bart tell him that he can't let him in. He sneaks into Tabby's limo before it pulls in and he talks to her, and it is a moment in which he finally realizes he must grow up. He gets out of the car and everyone at the wedding sees him and are all confused. He goes round the back of the church to get his bike and leave and meets Minor again, who has no idea of what happened with Kelly and Tabby, and is civil towards him. Kelly cycles to the clinic where his father is staying and is surprised. They begin to watch television and his mother walks in and is surprised and happy to see Kelly.\n\nIn the end, it shows the voicemail message where Kelly apologizes to the Bowlands for his behavior and asks Bart if he will meet him where he will be selling all his old memorabilia, and gives a hat Bart acquired for him back. He is shown walking down the street with Sarah and they hold hands. Kelly sees Lance again on his lawn where they faked the invasion, and goes over to him and confesses, only to be punched in the jaw. The film ends with Kelly lying on the lawn, holding his bruised jaw saying, \"I deserved it\".\n\n==Filming Locations==\nThe film was shot in and around the greater Los Angeles region.  Sites included the Los Angeles County Arboretum, Reseda and Santa Monica.
