(Although these were the final sketches of ''The Carol Burnett Show'', the characters would end up being reprised one year later in a different four-week series, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'').\n\nAs a special surprise for Burnett, Conway introduces a piano player and \u2013 when the curtain goes up \u2013 it is legendary screen actor [[James Stewart]] playing the piano and singing \"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\". Burnett, a lifelong fan of Stewart's, breaks down in tears and expresses how much she admires and loves him, and Stewart reciprocates by saying: \"Carol, I just feel so wonderful to be here, to be a part of all these millions of people to thank you for all the wonderful beautiful times you've given all of us, all of these eleven years. And I'm frankly speaking for all the millions of people\".\n\nIn the final moments of the show, Burnett, as the Charwoman, is backstage and waves goodbye to the show's staff and celebrities from the audience as they silently walk by to wish her farewell. Harvey Korman, who was appearing as a guest, stops and gives her a kiss; Lawrence comes out of a stage door, signs Burnett's autograph book, kisses and hugs her and leaves; Conway comes down the stairs and does the same.\n\nShe then walks across the empty stage towards a sign reading THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW and flips it over to read CLOSED. Sitting on her Charwoman's bucket, Burnett talks about how hard it is to leave and why she decided to end the show despite a season 12 renewal. She says it felt like the time to move on to do other things while the show was still doing well. She talks about the crew and each member of her cast and how much she loves and respects them. Finally, she thanks the audience and tearfully sings a soulful rendition of the show's closing theme-song \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\".

It is the 279th overall episode of the show and the 24th episode of the eleventh and final season which aired on [[CBS]] on Wednesday, March 29, 1978 from 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. EST.\n\nThe episode, directed by [[Dave Powers (director)|Dave Powers]] and written by a large number of collaborators, was videotaped in front of a live audience on [[Saint Patrick's Day]], March 17, 1978 on Stage 33 at [[CBS Television City]] in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19780325&id=lPROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cAIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6386,2976506&hl=en \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at [[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Toledo Blade]], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Summary==\n[[Carol Burnett]], [[Tim Conway]] and [[Vicki Lawrence]] reminisce about past shows and introduce excerpts spanning eleven seasons of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which include the following highlights: Burnett does her [[Tarzan yell]] and performs in duets with such guests as [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]; in comic skits, [[Burt Reynolds]] sings \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\"; [[Harvey Korman]] sings \"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\"; and Burnett sings \"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]],\" \"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]],\" and \"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\"; movie parodies include ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' and ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]''.\n\nAdditional highlights include Lawrence singing \"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" and a spoof of a country-and-western song; Bing Crosby and [[Bob Hope]] appear in a restaurant skit; Conway performs the role of a sports commentator in his very first sketch on the series; a ''[[Columbo]]'' parody is featured and [[Dick Van Dyke]] appears in a comic sketch; a series of bloopers and outtakes are included from previous shows featuring the regular cast.\n\nAlso featured is a final sketch of \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" with Burnett and Lawrence as Eunice and Mama where Eunice consults a psychiatrist (played by [[Craig Richard Nelson]]) trying to figure out what went wrong with her life, as well as a final sketch of \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" with Burnett and Conway as Mrs. Wiggins and Mr. Tudball in which Mr. Tudball is moving his office to a new location and has a flashback to when he first met and interviewed Mrs. Wiggins. (Although these were the final sketches of ''The Carol Burnett Show'', the characters would end up being reprised one year later in a different four-week series, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'').\n\nAs a special surprise for Burnett, Conway introduces a piano player and \u2013 when the curtain goes up \u2013 it is legendary screen actor [[James Stewart]] playing the piano and singing \"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\". Burnett, a lifelong fan of Stewart's, breaks down in tears and expresses how much she admires and loves him, and Stewart reciprocates by saying: \"Carol, I just feel so wonderful to be here, to be a part of all these millions of people to thank you for all the wonderful beautiful times you've given all of us, all of these eleven years. And I'm frankly speaking for all the millions of people\".\n\nIn the final moments of the show, Burnett, as the Charwoman, is backstage and waves goodbye to the show's staff and celebrities from the audience as they silently walk by to wish her farewell. Harvey Korman, who was appearing as a guest, stops and gives her a kiss; Lawrence comes out of a stage door, signs Burnett's autograph book, kisses and hugs her and leaves; Conway comes down the stairs and does the same.\n\nShe then walks across the empty stage towards a sign reading THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW and flips it over to read CLOSED. Sitting on her Charwoman's bucket, Burnett talks about how hard it is to leave and why she decided to end the show despite a season 12 renewal. She says it felt like the time to move on to do other things while the show was still doing well. She talks about the crew and each member of her cast and how much she loves and respects them. Finally, she thanks the audience and tearfully sings a soulful rendition of the show's closing theme-song \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\". She blows a kiss to the audience, tugs at her ear one last time and says goodnight.<ref>[http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-carol-burnett-show/ ''The Carol Burnett Show'' TV series finale], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Production notes==\nAlthough [[CBS]] wanted to renew the show for another year, by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre.

A preview issue was released at E3 2001, with another preview issue in November 2001. The magazine was bundled with a [[dvd|disc]] that included [[game demo]]s, preview [[video]]s and trailers, and other content, such as game or Xbox updates and free gamerpics. The discs also provided the software for the [[Xbox 360]] for backward compatibility of original [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] games for those without [[broadband]] and [[Xbox Live]] access. As of January 2012, OXM no longer includes a demo disc.  In mid-2014, the U.S. version was merged into the UK version on the website, which lasted only a few months until Future plc announced that it was closing its website along with all the other websites that Future has published, including ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' and ''[[Computer and Video Games]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/media-pr/future-will-close-cvg/|title=Future will close CVG|last=|first=|date=2014-11-28|website=[[MCV/Develop]]|publisher=|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/media-pr/future-plans-170-uk-job-cuts-as-it-sells-bikes-and-craft-magazines/|title=Future plans 170 UK job cuts as it sells bikes and craft magazines|date=2014-05-29|website=MCV/DEVELOP|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>  In February 2015, ''OXM'' and all of Future's video game websites were redirected into [[GamesRadar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104093244/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/483033/features/messages-from-the-editors/|title=Messages from the editors - CVG|date=2015-01-04|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref> \n\nThe magazine was shut down in March 2020 by owners Future Publishing, in a review of titles.

However, beginning in January 2012, OXM stopped including demo discs, saying \"You've told us you don't want the DVD anymore, and we listened....\".\nEach demo contained unlockable content like gamer pics and hidden demos. There was also a sim-like game called 'OXM Universe'. Gamers played the games on disc and viewed the videos on the disc to gain points, but only 800 points were needed for the unlockable content. The points had another use in which gamers used their points to research and build equipment for the in-game game 'OXM Universe'. 'OXMU' was discontinued in OXM's 100th issue.\n\n;We Heart Xbox\n:In this section, new games which were not yet shown to the mainstream public or user-modified hardware such as consoles or faceplates were shown here.\n\n;Message Center\n:Besides showing readers' mail, the OXM crew revealed their 'Top 5' things on their mind at the moment. The 'Top 5' tradition was broken in Issue #85 of July 2008, when the staff instead answered to the question \"What's your worst habit - and do you even want to break it?\"\n;Xbox Next\n:In this section, upcoming games were highlighted and previewed.\n\n;Features\n:In this section, games may get prolonged previews, or OXM may have an exclusive 6-10 page review for a certain game. There may also be special featured content like Issue #77's '[[HDTV]] Buyer's Guide'.\n\n;Xbox Now\n:This was the section where every Xbox, Xbox 360, and [[Xbox Live Arcade]] game, and [[downloadable content]] is reviewed.\n\n;Xbox 365\nThis section contained Xbox business articles, gaming news, 'Hard Stuff' (a section that reviews contraptions related to an Xbox console), '2,000 Pennies or Less' (a section that showed the best cheap games that can be bought for either Xbox or Xbox 360), the codes of the month, 'Forza Showroom' (a brief column that showed some of the best ''[[Forza Motorsport 2]]'' car designs that people have made), a section for competing against the OXM crew in games like ''[[Lost Planet]]'', ''[[Halo 3]]'', ''[[Gears of War]]'', and more, 'Media Ho!' (a section that talked about movies, books, and other items related to games), 'Live Space' (a section which showed gamers' Xbox Live gamertags, 'Ask Dr. Gamer' (a section in which gamers would ask Health doctor, Freddy Chen, gaming related information), and 'The (insert something here) of Xbox' (a section that talked about business and other things of the Xbox gaming world. The column 'The Business of Xbox' was written by [[Geoff Keighley]] through the May 2007 issue, but until 2015, the column was written, on a less frequent basis, by [[Chris Morris (columnist)]]. As of Issue #71, the end page rotated columnists, with guests including game creators [[Tim Schafer]], [[Denis Dyack]], and [[Randy Pitchford]].\n\n==Staff==\n'''UK and US Edition'''\n*Editor: Chris Burke\n*Games Editor: Dave Meikleham\n*Staff Writer: Adam Bryant\n*Production Editor: Drew Sleep\n*Senior Art Editor: Warren Brown\n\n== Review system ==\nUntil issue #52, the ''Official Xbox Magazine (OXM)'' used a 100-point system, scoring games out of 10.0 with .1 increments. The games that received at least a 9.0 were given an Editor's Choice award. Beginning with issue #53 (Holiday 2005), the US ''OXM'' switched to a 20-point scoring system, scoring games out of 10.0 with increments of 0.5. The UK edition though switched to a 10-point scoring system, scoring games out of 10. This ratings scale was detailed on the introduction page to every issue's review section. A score of 10.0 was not considered perfect, but is called \"Classic\" and is considered to be \"one of those rare and very best of games.\" ''OXM'''s review scale did include a score of 11.0 (termed \"Mecha Godzilla's Choice\") as \"Perfect,\" however the description for that score was \"The unicorn. Will never happen. Never.\"\n\nTwenty games received a 10/10 score from OXM, but only ''[[BioShock]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' had been given this score by both the US and UK editions. The nine 10/10 games from the US edition included: ''[[Fight Night Round 3]]'', ''[[Gears of War]]'', ''[[Fallout 3]]'', ''[[Halo 3]]'', ''[[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare]]'', ''[[Mass Effect]]'', ''[[Gears of War 3]]'' and ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]''. Whereas the nine 10/10 games from the UK edition included: ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', ''[[Project Gotham Racing 4]]'', ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'', ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', ''[[Halo: Reach]]'', ''[[Portal 2]]'', ''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]]'' and ''[[Mass Effect 3]]''.\n\n''OXM'' also had begun reviewing [[Xbox Live]] Downloadable Content (DLC), on a three-point scale: Buy, Fanboys Only, and Deny. The exception was ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Shivering Isles]]'' expansion pack in issue 70, which, due to the game's size, being \"much more than a simple map pack\" was reviewed on the normal 20-point scale, receiving an 8.5 (Great). (The game was later released as an expansion on DVD.)\n\n==Bonus materials==\nSome disks came with additional material for Xbox games. Early issues' demo disk included a costume expansion to ''[[Dead or Alive 3]]'' and Easter eggs unlockable via inputting a code via the controller. Some material seen only available for download on [[Xbox Live]] was included on demo disks. Until 2015, most US demo discs included gamer pics centered on a game.\n\n*Issue #53 contained the free exclusive beta for ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]''.\n*Issue #67 contained the Wizard's Tower and Thieves Den quests for ''The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion''.\n*Issue #69 contained Chapter 2 for ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter]]''.\n*Issue #73 contained an exclusive demo for the Japanese RPG ''[[Eternal Sonata]]''.\n*Issue #74 contained an exclusive demo for ''[[Beautiful Katamari]]''.\n*Issue #77 contained a special demo for ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''. (The demo is also found in copies of ''[[Tony Hawk's Proving Ground]]''.)\n*Issue #80 contained the Harmonix Track Pack 01: 3 exclusive songs for the popular video game ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]''.\n*Issue #82 contained the downloadable song ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]] [[Halo 2 Original Soundtrack#Track listings|Theme MJOLNIR Mix]]'' for ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock''.\n*Issue #46 (UK edition) contained the NXE update for the Xbox 360 dashboard.\n*Issue #54 (UK edition) contained a ''[[Left 4 Dead 2]]'' Xbox 360 theme.\n*Issue #116 contained an [[Assassin's Creed]] pamphlet.\n\n== Podcasts ==\n\n;Audio Podcast\n'''KOXM''' was the weekly [https://web.archive.org/web/20150108070206/http://www.oxmonline.com/xbox-360/games/10318/oxm-podcast/ Official Xbox Magazine podcast], hosted by OXM Senior Editor Dave Rudden.  The show was previously hosted by Ryan McCaffrey until he left Official Xbox Magazine to work at IGN. [[Dan Amrich]] used to be a McCaffrey's co-host, but he left the magazine and podcast to work at Activision/Blizzard. The audio podcast featured a recap in the week's past events and game releases, two trivia contests (''Name That Xbox Sound Effect'' and ''Stick it to the Dan'' (formerly Dan's Useless Trivia)) for a prize (usually a [[tee shirt]] or [[Xbox Live Arcade]] game), and developer interviews.

A preview issue was released at E3 2001, with another preview issue in November 2001. The magazine was bundled with a [[dvd|disc]] that included [[game demo]]s, preview [[video]]s and trailers, and other content, such as game or Xbox updates and free gamerpics. The discs also provided the software for the [[Xbox 360]] for backward compatibility of original [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] games for those without [[broadband]] and [[Xbox Live]] access. As of January 2012, OXM no longer includes a demo disc.  In mid-2014, the U.S. version was merged into the UK version on the website, which lasted only a few months until Future plc announced that it was closing its website along with all the other websites that Future has published, including ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' and ''[[Computer and Video Games]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/media-pr/future-will-close-cvg/|title=Future will close CVG|last=|first=|date=2014-11-28|website=[[MCV/Develop]]|publisher=|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/media-pr/future-plans-170-uk-job-cuts-as-it-sells-bikes-and-craft-magazines/|title=Future plans 170 UK job cuts as it sells bikes and craft magazines|date=2014-05-29|website=MCV/DEVELOP|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>  In February 2015, ''OXM'' and all of Future's video game websites were redirected into [[GamesRadar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104093244/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/483033/features/messages-from-the-editors/|title=Messages from the editors - CVG|date=2015-01-04|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref> It was shut down in March 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gamasutra.com/view/news/360316/Future_shuts_down_Official_Xbox_Magazine_after_almost_two_decades.php|title=Future shuts down Official Xbox Magazine after almost two decades|first=Chris|last=Kerr|date=30 March 2020|website=Gamasutra|accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Content==\n'''On the Disc''' '''(Discontinued in 2012)'''\n\nEach issue originally contained a demo disc with both [[Xbox 360]] and [[Xbox Live Arcade]] games. However, beginning in January 2012, OXM stopped including demo discs, saying \"You've told us you don't want the DVD anymore, and we listened....\".\nEach demo contained unlockable content like gamer pics and hidden demos. There was also a sim-like game called 'OXM Universe'. Gamers played the games on disc and viewed the videos on the disc to gain points, but only 800 points were needed for the unlockable content. The points had another use in which gamers used their points to research and build equipment for the in-game game 'OXM Universe'. 'OXMU' was discontinued in OXM's 100th issue.\n\n;We Heart Xbox\n:In this section, new games which were not yet shown to the mainstream public or user-modified hardware such as consoles or faceplates were shown here.\n\n;Message Center\n:Besides showing readers' mail, the OXM crew revealed their 'Top 5' things on their mind at the moment. The 'Top 5' tradition was broken in Issue #85 of July 2008, when the staff instead answered to the question \"What's your worst habit - and do you even want to break it?\"\n;Xbox Next\n:In this section, upcoming games were highlighted and previewed.\n\n;Features\n:In this section, games may get prolonged previews, or OXM may have an exclusive 6-10 page review for a certain game. There may also be special featured content like Issue #77's '[[HDTV]] Buyer's Guide'.\n\n;Xbox Now\n:This was the section where every Xbox, Xbox 360, and [[Xbox Live Arcade]] game, and [[downloadable content]] is reviewed.\n\n;Xbox 365\nThis section contained Xbox business articles, gaming news, 'Hard Stuff' (a section that reviews contraptions related to an Xbox console), '2,000 Pennies or Less' (a section that showed the best cheap games that can be bought for either Xbox or Xbox 360), the codes of the month, 'Forza Showroom' (a brief column that showed some of the best ''[[Forza Motorsport 2]]'' car designs that people have made), a section for competing against the OXM crew in games like ''[[Lost Planet]]'', ''[[Halo 3]]'', ''[[Gears of War]]'', and more, 'Media Ho!' (a section that talked about movies, books, and other items related to games), 'Live Space' (a section which showed gamers' Xbox Live gamertags, 'Ask Dr. Gamer' (a section in which gamers would ask Health doctor, Freddy Chen, gaming related information), and 'The (insert something here) of Xbox' (a section that talked about business and other things of the Xbox gaming world. The column 'The Business of Xbox' was written by [[Geoff Keighley]] through the May 2007 issue, but until 2015, the column was written, on a less frequent basis, by [[Chris Morris (columnist)]]. As of Issue #71, the end page rotated columnists, with guests including game creators [[Tim Schafer]], [[Denis Dyack]], and [[Randy Pitchford]].\n\n==Staff==\n'''UK and US Edition'''\n*Editor: Chris Burke\n*Games Editor: Dave Meikleham\n*Staff Writer: Adam Bryant\n*Production Editor: Drew Sleep\n*Senior Art Editor: Warren Brown\n\n== Review system ==\nUntil issue #52, the ''Official Xbox Magazine (OXM)'' used a 100-point system, scoring games out of 10.0 with .1 increments. The games that received at least a 9.0 were given an Editor's Choice award. Beginning with issue #53 (Holiday 2005), the US ''OXM'' switched to a 20-point scoring system, scoring games out of 10.0 with increments of 0.5. The UK edition though switched to a 10-point scoring system, scoring games out of 10. This ratings scale was detailed on the introduction page to every issue's review section. A score of 10.0 was not considered perfect, but is called \"Classic\" and is considered to be \"one of those rare and very best of games.\" ''OXM'''s review scale did include a score of 11.0 (termed \"Mecha Godzilla's Choice\") as \"Perfect,\" however the description for that score was \"The unicorn. Will never happen. Never.\"\n\nTwenty games received a 10/10 score from OXM, but only ''[[BioShock]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' had been given this score by both the US and UK editions. The nine 10/10 games from the US edition included: ''[[Fight Night Round 3]]'', ''[[Gears of War]]'', ''[[Fallout 3]]'', ''[[Halo 3]]'', ''[[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare]]'', ''[[Mass Effect]]'', ''[[Gears of War 3]]'' and ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]''. Whereas the nine 10/10 games from the UK edition included: ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', ''[[Project Gotham Racing 4]]'', ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'', ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', ''[[Halo: Reach]]'', ''[[Portal 2]]'', ''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]]'' and ''[[Mass Effect 3]]''.\n\n''OXM'' also had begun reviewing [[Xbox Live]] Downloadable Content (DLC), on a three-point scale: Buy, Fanboys Only, and Deny. The exception was ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Shivering Isles]]'' expansion pack in issue 70, which, due to the game's size, being \"much more than a simple map pack\" was reviewed on the normal 20-point scale, receiving an 8.5 (Great). (The game was later released as an expansion on DVD.)\n\n==Bonus materials==\nSome disks came with additional material for Xbox games. Early issues' demo disk included a costume expansion to ''[[Dead or Alive 3]]'' and Easter eggs unlockable via inputting a code via the controller. Some material seen only available for download on [[Xbox Live]] was included on demo disks. Until 2015, most US demo discs included gamer pics centered on a game.\n\n*Issue #53 contained the free exclusive beta for ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]''.\n*Issue #67 contained the Wizard's Tower and Thieves Den quests for ''The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion''.\n*Issue #69 contained Chapter 2 for ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter]]''.\n*Issue #73 contained an exclusive demo for the Japanese RPG ''[[Eternal Sonata]]''.\n*Issue #74 contained an exclusive demo for ''[[Beautiful Katamari]]''.\n*Issue #77 contained a special demo for ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''. (The demo is also found in copies of ''[[Tony Hawk's Proving Ground]]''.)\n*Issue #80 contained the Harmonix Track Pack 01: 3 exclusive songs for the popular video game ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]''.\n*Issue #82 contained the downloadable song ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]] [[Halo 2 Original Soundtrack#Track listings|Theme MJOLNIR Mix]]'' for ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock''.\n*Issue #46 (UK edition) contained the NXE update for the Xbox 360 dashboard.\n*Issue #54 (UK edition) contained a ''[[Left 4 Dead 2]]'' Xbox 360 theme.\n*Issue #116 contained an [[Assassin's Creed]] pamphlet.\n\n== Podcasts ==\n\n;Audio Podcast\n'''KOXM''' was the weekly [https://web.archive.org/web/20150108070206/http://www.oxmonline.com/xbox-360/games/10318/oxm-podcast/ Official Xbox Magazine podcast], hosted by OXM Senior Editor Dave Rudden.  The show was previously hosted by Ryan McCaffrey until he left Official Xbox Magazine to work at IGN. [[Dan Amrich]] used to be a McCaffrey's co-host, but he left the magazine and podcast to work at Activision/Blizzard. The audio podcast featured a recap in the week's past events and game releases, two trivia contests (''Name That Xbox Sound Effect'' and ''Stick it to the Dan'' (formerly Dan's Useless Trivia)) for a prize (usually a [[tee shirt]] or [[Xbox Live Arcade]] game), and developer interviews. The show was produced by [[Andy Bauman]].\n\n;Video Podcast\nUntil 2015, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060818154946/http://www.oxmpodcast.com/video/ OXM Video Podcast] was updated much less frequently, with gaps over a month or more.
