Master masons included Richard of Crundale, Roger of Crundale (probably Richard's brother), Michael of Canterbury, Richard of Stow, John of Battle and Nicholas Dymenge.<ref name=\"colv483_4\"/> Sculptors included [[Alexander of Abingdon]] and William of Ireland, both of whom had worked at Westminster Abbey, who were paid \u00a33 6s. 8d. apiece for the statues; and Ralph of Chichester.<ref>Hastings 1955, pp. 20\u201321.</ref><ref>Powrie 1990, p. 65.</ref><ref>Cockerill 2014, p. 357.</ref><ref>Liversidge 1989.</ref>\n\n===Purpose and parallels===\nEleanor's crosses appear to have been intended in part as expressions of royal power; and in part as [[cenotaph]]s to encourage [[chantry chapel|prayers for her soul]] from travellers.<ref>''Chronicle of St Albans''.</ref><ref>Colvin 1963, p. 485.</ref><ref>Cockerill 2014, pp. 351\u201352.</ref> On the pedestal of each was inscribed the phrase ''Orate pro anima'' (\"Pray for [her] soul\").<ref>Hunter 1842, p. 180.</ref>\n\nIt was not unknown for [[memorial cross]]es to be constructed in the middle ages, although they were normally isolated instances and relatively simple in design. A cross in the [[Strand, London|Strand]], near London, was said to have been erected by [[William II of England|William II]] in memory of his mother, [[Matilda of Flanders|Queen Matilda]] (d. 1083). [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] erected one at [[Merton (parish)|Merton]], Surrey, for his cousin the [[William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey|Earl of Surrey]] (d. 1240). Another was erected at [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] for Edward I's sister [[Beatrice of England|Beatrice]] (d. 1275). Yet another, almost contemporary with the Eleanor crosses, was erected near [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] for Edward's mother, [[Eleanor of Provence]] (d.1291).<ref name=\"colv484_5\">Colvin 1963, pp. 484\u201385.</ref><ref>Parsons 1991, pp. 18, 60.</ref><ref>Parsons 1995, p. 209.</ref>\n\nThe closest precedent for the Eleanor crosses, and almost certainly their model, was the series of nine crosses known as ''montjoies'' erected along the funeral route of King [[Louis IX of France]] in 1271. These were elaborate structures incorporating sculptural representations of the King, and were erected in part to promote his [[canonisation]] (a campaign that in 1297 succeeded).

The crosses stood at [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], [[Grantham]] and [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], all in [[Lincolnshire]]; [[Geddington]] and [[Hardingstone]] in [[Northamptonshire]]; [[Stony Stratford]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]; [[Woburn, Bedfordshire|Woburn]] and [[Dunstable]] in [[Bedfordshire]]; [[St Albans]] and Waltham (now [[Waltham Cross]]) in [[Hertfordshire]]; [[Cheapside]] in London; and Charing (now [[Charing Cross]]) in [[Westminster]].

Their construction is documented in the executors' account rolls, which survive from 1291 to March 1294, but not thereafter.<ref>Botfield and Turner 1841.</ref> By the end of that period, the crosses at Lincoln, Hardingstone, Stony Stratford, Woburn, Dunstable, St Albans and Waltham were complete or nearly so, and those at Cheapside and Charing in progress; but those at Grantham, Stamford and Geddington apparently not yet begun.

Master masons included Richard of Crundale, Roger of Crundale (probably Richard's brother), Michael of Canterbury, Richard of Stow, John of Battle and Nicholas Dymenge.<ref name=\"colv483_4\"/> Sculptors included [[Alexander of Abingdon]] and William of Ireland, both of whom had worked at Westminster Abbey, who were paid \u00a33 6s. 8d. apiece for the statues; and Ralph of Chichester.<ref>Hastings 1955, pp. 20\u201321.</ref><ref>Powrie 1990, p. 65.</ref><ref>Cockerill 2014, p. 357.</ref><ref>Liversidge 1989.</ref>\n\n===Purpose and parallels===\nEleanor's crosses appear to have been intended in part as expressions of royal power; and in part as [[cenotaph]]s to encourage [[chantry chapel|prayers for her soul]] from travellers.<ref>''Chronicle of St Albans''.</ref><ref>Colvin 1963, p. 485.</ref><ref>Cockerill 2014, pp. 351\u201352.</ref> On the pedestal of each was inscribed the phrase ''Orate pro anima'' (\"Pray for [her] soul\").<ref>Hunter 1842, p. 180.</ref>\n\nIt was not unknown for [[memorial cross]]es to be constructed in the middle ages, although they were normally isolated instances and relatively simple in design. A cross in the [[Strand, London|Strand]], near London, was said to have been erected by [[William II of England|William II]] in memory of his mother, [[Matilda of Flanders|Queen Matilda]] (d. 1083). [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] erected one at [[Merton (parish)|Merton]], Surrey, for his cousin the [[William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey|Earl of Surrey]] (d. 1240). Another was erected at [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] for Edward I's sister [[Beatrice of England|Beatrice]] (d. 1275). Yet another, almost contemporary with the Eleanor crosses, was erected near [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] for Edward's mother, [[Eleanor of Provence]] (d.1291).<ref name=\"colv484_5\">Colvin 1963, pp. 484\u201385.</ref><ref>Parsons 1991, pp. 18, 60.</ref><ref>Parsons 1995, p. 209.</ref>\n\nThe closest precedent for the Eleanor crosses, and almost certainly their model, was the series of nine crosses known as ''montjoies'' erected along the funeral route of King [[Louis IX of France]] in 1271. These were elaborate structures incorporating sculptural representations of the King, and were erected in part to promote his [[canonisation]] (a campaign that in 1297 succeeded). Eleanor's crosses never aspired to this last purpose, but in design were even larger and more ornate than the ''montjoies'', being of at least three rather than two tiers.<ref name=\"evans\">{{cite journal |first=Joan |last=Evans |authorlink=Joan Evans (art historian) |title=A prototype of the Eleanor crosses |journal=[[Burlington Magazine]] |volume=91 |year=1949 |pages=96\u201397 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Branner |authorlink=Robert Branner |chapter=The Montjoies of Saint Louis |editor1-first=Douglas |editor1-last=Fraser |editor2-first=Howard |editor2-last=Hibbard |editor2-link=Howard Hibbard |editor3-first=Milton J. |editor3-last=Lewine |title=Essays in the History of Architecture presented to Rudolf Wittkower |location=London |publisher=Phaidon |year=1967 |pages=13\u201316 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=John |last=Zukowsky |title=Montjoies and Eleanor Crosses reconsidered |journal=[[Gesta (journal)|Gesta]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |year=1974 |pages=39\u201344 }}</ref><ref name=\"colv484_5\"/><ref>Cockerill 2014, p. 351.</ref>\n\n==The twelve crosses==\n===Lincoln===\n[[File:Lincoln 128a.jpg|thumb|upright|The surviving fragment of the Lincoln cross]]\n<small>({{Coord|53|12|51|N|00|32|47|W|region:GB}})</small><br/>\nEleanor's viscera were buried in Lincoln Cathedral on 3 December 1290.

Dempsey's bid of $9.15M was enough to secure Tully's over the bids of six others including Starbucks. Dempsey's company will control 47 Tully's locations in the Seattle area, but not the online business which had been purchased by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/04/showbiz/patrick-dempsey-coffee-chain/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|title=Patrick Dempsey: Winning bid for coffee-shop chain 'just felt right'|date=January 5, 2013|accessdate=January 6, 2013|publisher=CNN}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a legal dispute with investor group Global Baristas, Dempsey left the group, in effect officially leaving his managerial positions with Tully's. Dempsey filed a lawsuit on behalf of Global Baristas, claiming [[Michael Avenatti]] borrowed $2 million against Tully's assets without informing Dempsey, rather than fully financing the coffee chain as was promised, calling the 15 percent interest rate on the loan \"exorbitant\" and sued for Avenatti to fund Tully's operations and meet its working capital needs, as well as for any damages owed the company. Soon after, Dempsey's lawyer's office issued a statement saying the partnership was dissolved and that Dempsey wished the lawyer and the company \"all the best\". Avenatti has stated the dispute was a \"misunderstanding\" and will continue operating with other investors and new management.<ref>{{cite news|title=Patrick Dempsey Says Goodbye to the Coffee Chain He Rescued|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-27/patrick-dempsey-says-goodbye-to-the-coffee-chain-he-rescued|accessdate=November 13, 2013|newspaper=businessweek.com|date=August 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Dempsey walks away from Tully's after suing partner|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2021672793_dempseytullysxml.html|accessdate=November 13, 2013|newspaper=seattletimes.com|date=August 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nDempsey was diagnosed with [[dyslexia]] at age 12.

Dempsey's bid of $9.15M was enough to secure Tully's over the bids of six others including Starbucks. Dempsey's company will control 47 Tully's locations in the Seattle area, but not the online business which had been purchased by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/04/showbiz/patrick-dempsey-coffee-chain/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|title=Patrick Dempsey: Winning bid for coffee-shop chain 'just felt right'|date=January 5, 2013|accessdate=January 6, 2013|publisher=CNN}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a legal dispute with investor group Global Baristas, Dempsey left the group, in effect officially leaving his managerial positions with Tully's. Dempsey filed a lawsuit on behalf of Global Baristas, claiming [[Michael Avenatti]] borrowed $2 million against Tully's assets without informing Dempsey, rather than fully financing the coffee chain as was promised, calling the 15 percent interest rate on the loan \"exorbitant\" and sued for Avenatti to fund Tully's operations and meet its working capital needs, as well as for any damages owed the company. Soon after, Dempsey's lawyer's office issued a statement saying the partnership was dissolved and that Dempsey wished the lawyer and the company \"all the best\". Avenatti has stated the dispute was a \"misunderstanding\" and will continue operating with other investors and new management.<ref>{{cite news|title=Patrick Dempsey Says Goodbye to the Coffee Chain He Rescued|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-27/patrick-dempsey-says-goodbye-to-the-coffee-chain-he-rescued|accessdate=November 13, 2013|newspaper=businessweek.com|date=August 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Dempsey walks away from Tully's after suing partner|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2021672793_dempseytullysxml.html|accessdate=November 13, 2013|newspaper=seattletimes.com|date=August 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nDempsey was diagnosed with [[dyslexia]] at age 12.

In a series of small studies in [[Europe]] it had been shown that [[Rifampicin]], a drug used to treat [[tuberculosis]], could limit the effectiveness of [[Efavirenz]], a drug used to treat [[HIV]]. The drugs interact through a liver enzyme ([[cytochrome P450]]), which is produced at elevated levels in patients who take [[Rifampicin]], but breaks down the [[Efavirenz]].
