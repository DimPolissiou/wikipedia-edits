This is often done by replacing a letter with another letter (for example, in English, ''[[k]]'' replacing ''[[c]]''), or [[symbol]] (for example, in languages using the [[Latin character|Latin character set]], ''[[$]]'' replacing ''[[s]]'', or ''[[\u00a2]]'' replacing ''c'').  [[Satiric]] misspelling is found widely today in [[Internet slang|informal writing on the Internet]], but can also be found in some serious [[Political philosophy|political writing]] that opposes the [[status quo]].\n<!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Examples in this article should be cited in the style described at [[WP:CITE#HOW]] whenever possible, instead of simply providing an external link. -->\n\n== ''K'' replacing ''c'' ==\n===In political writing===\nReplacing the letter ''c'' with ''k'' in the first letter of a word came into use by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] during its early years in the mid-to-late 19th century. The concept is continued today within the group.

This is often done by replacing a letter with another letter (for example, in English, ''[[k]]'' replacing ''[[c]]''), or [[symbol]] (for example, in languages using the [[Latin character|Latin character set]], ''[[$]]'' replacing ''[[s]]'', or ''[[\u00a2]]'' replacing ''c'').

This is especially effective if the misspelling is done by replacing part of the word with another that has identical phonetic qualities.\n\nSome [[toponyms|place names]] are also spelled differently in order to emphasize some political view. For instance, ''Brasil'' (the Portuguese spelling of \"Brazil\"), is sometimes misconstrued as a typo for ''Brazil'' in English texts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/brasil |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190200/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/brasil |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nJournalists may make a politicized editorial decision by choosing to differentially retain (or even create) misspellings, mispronunciations, ungrammaticisms, dialect variants, or interjections.\n\n[[Marilyn Manson]] intentionally misspells the word [[crucifixion]] as \"cruci-fiction\" in the title of the song \"Cruci-fiction in Space\" on his 2000 album ''[[Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)|Holy Wood]]''.  The lyrics in the album's booklet also stylize \"god\" without capitalization while retaining capitalization for other proper names, such as Abraham Lincoln.\n\n===Backronyms===\n{{Main|Backronym}}\nPlays on [[acronym]]s and [[initialism]]s are also common, when the full name is spelled out but one of the component words is replaced by another. For example, [[Richard Stallman]] and other [[Free Software Foundation]] executives often refer to [[digital rights management]]  as \"digital '''restrictions''' management\",<ref>[[Digital rights management#Opposition to DRM]]</ref> a reference to the tendency for DRM to stifle the end user's ability to reshare music or write CDs more than a certain number of times.
