described by reviewers as [[trance music|trance]], [[dubstep]], [[bass music]], and [[electro (music)|electro]], though he incorporates other genres as well. When asked in 2013 how he would define his genre, he stated, \"I like a little bit of everything to be honest, so I try and make a little bit of everything... I try and keep my style on what I want to do, so I have dubstep songs, glitch-hop, electro, trance.\"<ref name=\"tenquestions\"/>\n\nCritics have in particular noted his blend of trance and dubstep.<ref name=\"seveaakkallmusic\"/> [[Vice (magazine)|Thump]] clarified in April 2014 that \"Seven Lions is currently one the biggest names in EDM, thanks to his unique and powerful brand of melodic, larger-than-life soundscapes that... mesh massive bass drops with emotional progressive-trance breakdowns.\"<ref name=\"thumpvice\"/> In 2014, Seven Lions' explained that \"I think that whole dubstep/trance sound was basically just from having an open mind about different genres and realizing that most of the trance I liked was at 140 bpm and most dubstep I liked was at 140 bpm, so it naturally made sense.\"<ref name=\"sevenlionseyouredm\"/>\n\nSeven Lions' has described himself as a fan of \"epic\" music, and he is a long-time metal and fantasy fan, inspired by groups such as his favorite band [[Opeth]]. Although he produces electronic music, he doesn't always listen to it, unless actively looking for music to put into his DJ set. He has stated that \"I\u2019m always into [[Viking Metal]], I like folky stuff. I like stuff that really takes you out of somewhere you are and puts you somewhere else.\"<ref name=\"tenquestions\"/> Among his favorite metal bands are [[Ensiferum]], [[M\u00e5negarm]], Opeth, and [[Storm Corrosion]].<ref name=\"tenquestions\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nAs of 2016, Seven Lions lives in Woodinville, WA<ref name=\"sevlionbio\" /> with his wife.<ref name=\"daystocomeearmlk\"/>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Year\n!Award\n!Nominated work\n!Category\n!Result\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|2011\n|rowspan=\"1\"|[[Beatport|Beatport Remix Competition]]\n|\"[[Above & Beyond (band)|You Got To Go (Seven Lions Remix)]]\"\n| Best Remix\n|{{Won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|2014\n|rowspan=\"1\"|America's Best DJ Competition\n|Seven Lions\n| America's Best DJ<ref name=\"sevenlionsbdjtimes\"/>\n|{{Nominated}}\n|-\n|}\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Seven Lions discography}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of dubstep musicians]]\n*[[List of Republic Records artists#S|List of Republic Records artists]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"sevenlionsdidolator\">\n{{cite news\n| title    =Kerli Stars In Seven Lions\u2019 Fantasy-Themed \"Worlds Apart\" Video: Watch\n| first    = Mike\n| last    =Wass\n| url     =http://www.idolator.com/7531150/kerli-stars-in-seven-lions-fantasy-themed-worlds-apart-video-watch\n| newspaper  =\n| publisher  =idolator\n| date    =August 15, 2014\n| accessdate = October 8, 2014\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"sevenlionsg\">\n{{cite web\n| title    =World's Apart\n| first    = Will\n| last    =Robinson\n| url     =https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/63138/Seven-Lions-Worlds-Apart/\n| website  =[[Sputnik Music]]\n| date    =July 6, 2014\n| accessdate = October 8, 2014\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"soundlogikdrops\">{{cite web|title=Seven Lions Drops His Massive Days To Come EP on OWSLA|url=http://soundlogik.com/seven-lions-drops-his-massive-days-to-come-ep-on-owsla/|publisher=Sound Logik|accessdate=April 18, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102163329/http://soundlogik.com/seven-lions-drops-his-massive-days-to-come-ep-on-owsla/|archivedate=November 2, 2013}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"beaportones\">{{cite web|title=Seven Lions - Days to Come EP |url=http://fastforwardandrewind.com/12118/seven-lions-days-to-come-ep/ |publisher=Fast Forward and Rewind |accessdate=April 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022093052/http://fastforwardandrewind.com/12118/seven-lions-days-to-come-ep/ |archivedate=October 22, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"hottestrecord\">{{cite web|title=Hottest Record - Seven Lions Feat.

According to ''[[Mixmag]]'', \"His take on 'On My Way To Heaven' retained the original's euphoric opening before plunging into a maelstrom of super-sized beats and gurgling bass.\"<ref name=\"helloryosk\"/>\n\n===2012: ''Polarize'' and ''Days to Come''===\nHis first EP ''Polarize'' was released on April 23, 2012 on the British [[drum and bass]] label Viper Recordings.<ref name=\"sevlionbio\" /> The EP includes six tracks, which incorporate a blend of genres such as [[dubstep]], drum and bass, and [[house music|house]].

It not only excluded Black and Mexican patrons from white-owned businesses, but also equated them with a subhuman status. ca. 1940s.<ref>Abel 2010, p. 170-171.</ref><ref>Wilson, Gutierrez, Chao 2003, p. 9.</ref> Similar signs could be found posted at Texas restaurants into the 1960s.<ref>Virtue 2007, p. 10.</ref>]]'''Black-Brown unity''', variations include '''Black-Brown-Yellow unity'''<ref>Jung 2006, p. 221.</ref><ref>Cooks 1992, p. 11.</ref> and '''Black-Brown-Yellow-Red unity''',<ref>Eisenstein 2004, p. 132.</ref> is a racial-political ideology which initially developed among [[Black people|Black]] scholars, writers, and activists who pushed for global activist associations between [[Black people]] and [[Brown (racial classification)|Brown people]] (including [[Chicano|Chicanos]] and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]]), as well as [[Asian people]] (referred to as \"Yellow\") and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] (referred to as \"Red\") to unify against [[white supremacy]], [[colonialism]], [[capitalism]], and, in some cases, European conceptualizations of [[masculinity]], which were recognized as interrelated in maintaining white racial privilege and power over [[People of Color|people of color]] globally.<ref name=\":4\">Eisenstein 2004, p. 37-39.</ref><ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe formation of unity struggles among people of color widely emerged in the 20th century and have been discussed by scholars as an attempt to forge a united struggle, emphasize the similar forms of oppression people of color confront under white supremacy, and recognize the immensity of their opposition, including shared experiences of servitude under colonial capitalism, [[Jim Crow laws]], ''[[de jure]]'' and ''[[de facto]]'' [[School segregation in the United States|school]] and [[Racial segregation in the United States|community segregation]], [[voter disenfranchisement]], [[economic oppression]], exclusion from white-owned communities (e.g. \"No Dogs, Negroes, Mexicans,\" \"No Colored Served Here,\" \"We Cater to White Trade Only\"), and the perception by white people that people of color were biologically and racially predisposed to be inferior, criminal, disorderly, and degenerate.<ref>Behnken 2012, p. 6-7</ref><ref name=\":7\" />\n\nBroadly speaking, unity becomes possible when the person of color who is oppressed in a white supremacist society first recognizes their status as a subject of racism and then moves to identifying with a community of other similarly oppressed peoples who are already working towards change. In some instances, such as in the case of forging an understanding of ''Yellow Power'', scholars have noted that the need to create a pan-Asian identity and dismantle existing stereotypes (e.g. \"[[model minority]]\") are also necessary steps which precede the formation of cross-racial unity, as Asian-American activists, writers, and scholars such as [[Amy Uyematsu]], [[Franklin Odo]], Larry Kubota, Keith Osajima, and [[Daniel Okimoto]] have addressed since the late 1960s.<ref>Watkins 2012, p. 35-42.</ref>\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe racial-political ideology of Black-Brown unity is based on acknowledging the similarities of oppression endured by Black and Brown people. Scholars examining this racial-political ideology demonstrate how the social and economic oppression of Black and Brown people is not isolated from one another, but rather shares many similarities, which may serve \"as a major potential resource for greater Black-Brown unity,\" as described by scholars Tatcho Mindiola Jr., Yolanda Flores Niemann, and Nestor Rodriguez.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mindiola, Jr.|first=Tatcho|title=Black-Brown Relations and Stereotypes|last2=Flores Niemann|first2=Yolanda|last3=Rodriguez|first3=Nestor|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2009|isbn=9780292778542|location=|pages=126}}</ref> The range of scholarship regarding Black-Brown(-Yellow-Red) unity is broad, yet works toward emphasizing the common goal of unity in the face of oppression.<ref>Eisenstein 2004, p. 55.</ref> \n\n[[Zillah R. Eisenstein|Zillah Eisenstein]] and other scholars recognize how the need for unity among people of color emerged from the global nature of oppression and its relationship with capitalism, colonialism, masculinity, and white supremacy. As a result of this force, unity among people of color therefore operates as a means of resistance against this structure.<ref name=\":4\" /><blockquote>The language of otherness and difference became naturalized as the empire's continents become dark, and races become savage. There is a colonialist history to this becoming. Capitalism is the story of colonial conquest, of the Americas, then of Asia and Africa. And this conquest is part and parcel of an imperial masculinity which fantasizes the protection of white femininity. Dominance and domination are white and male. Colonialism simply presents itself as civilization and attempts to naturalize theft, rape, and dehumanization.<ref name=\":4\" /></blockquote>Similarly, [[Gary Okihiro]] recognizes how European colonialism was built on an ideology which justified \"their expansion and appropriation of land, labor, and resources in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.\" This ideology of white superiority was justified \"in the name of religion and science\" which was wielded by the Europeans to assert their own purported superiority and \"civilized\" status in comparison to the \"anti-Christian, uncivilized non-Europeans.\" According to Okihiro, when enacted through colonialism, this ideology led to a plundering of the world by Europeans and the global [[Slave Trade|slave trade]], which dehumanized enslaved peoples as units of production \u2013 a system of European development constructed on the underdevelopment of the [[Third World]].<ref name=\":6\">Okihiro 1994, p. 37-38.</ref>\n== History ==\n{{Black Power sidebar}}The first wave of movements asserting the objective of forming unity or coalitions between people of color and economically disadvantaged whites, began in the late 1960s in the United States and declined by the 1970s. Chicano activists such as [[Cesar Chavez]] in 1965-1966 and [[Reies L\u00f3pez Tijerina]] in 1967-1969 collaborated with civil rights and Black Power organizations to forge Black-Brown collaborative activist work. Organizations such as the [[Poor People's Campaign]], organized by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] in 1968 and Fred Hampton's [[Rainbow Coalition (Fred Hampton)|Rainbow Coalition]] in 1969 attempted to construct multiracial coalitions based on the common interest of dismantling the structures which created poverty.<ref>Mantler 2013, p. 5-6.</ref> However, as a result of police brutality, government surveillance and harassment, sabotage campaigns by government agencies and local police departments which targeted activist organizations with the intention of producing distrust and disunity among activists and organizations, and the assassination of leaders such as King and Hampton, this wave of multiracial coalition building declined by the 1970s.<ref>Mantler 2013, p. 9-10.</ref>\n\n=== Black-Brown unity ===\n{{Chicano and Mexican-American series}}\nAn unprecedented meeting of African American and Mexican American activists occurred in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] at the [[Alianza Federal de Pueblos Libres]] 1967 conference hosted by Reies Tijerina to explore Black and Brown unity, cooperation, and forge a cross-racial alliance. Representatives from nearly every major [[Black Power]] organization were present, including Anthony Akku Babu of the [[Black Panther Party]], [[Ron Karenga]] of the [[US Organization|Us organization]], James Dennis of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], Ralph Featherstone of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], and Walter Bremond of the Black Congress. Representatives of Chicano groups were also present, including [[Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Guti\u00e9rrez|Jos\u00e9 Angel Guti\u00e9rrez]] of the [[Mexican American Youth Organization]], [[Bert Corona]] of the [[Mexican American Political Association]], D\u00e1vid Sanchez of the [[Brown Berets]], and [[Rodolfo \"Corky\" Gonzales]] of the Crusade for Justice.<ref name=\":0\">Behnken 2012, p. 1-3.</ref> Activist [[Maria Varela]] was also invited to the conference and to join the Alianza by Tijerina.<ref name=\":9\" /> \n\nThe meeting ultimately produced the [[Treaty of Peace, Harmony, and Mutual Assistance]], a seven-part pact which acknowledged mutual respect and cooperative alliance. Along with the other representatives, Hopi spiritual leader [[Thomas Banyacya]], who was present at the conference along with many northern New Mexican villagers, also signed the treaty, which began with the following five articles:<ref name=\":9\">Mantler 2013, p. 74-75.</ref><blockquote>Article I: \"Both peoples do promise not to permit the members of either of said peoples to  make false propaganda of any kind whatsoever against each other, either by SPEECH or WRITING.\"\n\nArticle II: \"Both peoples (races) do promise, never to permit violence or hate, to break this SOLEMN TREATY between said peoples.\"\n\nArticle III: Both peoples, make a SOLEMN promise, to cure and remedy the historical errors and differences that exist between said peoples.\n\nArticle IV: Let it be known, that there will be a RECIPROCAL right to send an EMISSARY or DELEGATE to the conventions, Congresses, and National reunions of each of said peoples.\n\nArticle V: Let it be known that both peoples will have a political delegate to represent his interests and relations with the other.</blockquote>The treaty concluded with the following statement: \"this TREATY, will be valid between the two said peoples, as long as the Sun and Moon shall shine.\" While this agreement recognized that disagreements and conflicts between Black and Brown people had been present in a society which actively oppressed both groups, it signified an attempt to forge a coalitive liberation movement, and has been noted by scholars in comparative civil rights scholarship to represent the inception of an attempt to forge Black-Brown unity.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nAttempts at coalition work between Black and Brown people largely occurred in the [[southwestern United States]] and had notable regional differences. In [[California]], Black and Brown unity was exemplified through groups such as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the [[National Farm Workers Association]] to combat racial segregation and fight for economic rights for farm workers. In [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], many Black Americans united with Mexican American groups in order to strengthen their civil rights struggle. In [[Texas]], both Black and Brown Americans had their own widespread civil rights movements and unification was often not accentuated. Scholar Brian D. Behnken noted that \"when African American and Mexican American activists moderated the divisive power of race by focusing on economics, they recognized the shared oppression of each group\" and collectively fought for improved wages, hours, and working conditions.<ref>Behnken 2012, p. 8-9.</ref>\n\nInfluenced by the [[Black Power]] movement, some Chicanos accentuated the similarities between Black and Brown political struggles. In 1968, the [[La Raza (newspaper)|''La Raza'']] newspaper claimed the following on the relationship and shared struggle of Black Americans and Chicano communities: \"Our oppressions are one. Our dreams are one. Our demands are one. We suffer as one, we react as one, we struggle as one!\"<ref name=\":3\">L\u00f3pez 2009, p. 210-211.</ref> This new position was a considerable shift from previous generations of Mexican Americans, especially among community leaders, many of whom were openly [[assimilationist]] and sought to assert Mexican identity as white.<ref name=\":1\" /> One East Los Angeles study found that twice as many Mexican Americans favored cooperation with Black Americans in 1972 than in 1965, and concluded that \"when one takes into account traditional animosities marring Black-Mexican American relations,\" this was an \"impressive finding.\" However, while animosity from Mexican Americans notably lessened as a result of new expressions of solidarity among Chicanos, the total number of Mexican Americans who favored cooperation was still in the minority at 39%.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn Los Angeles, school segregation became a focal point of Black-Brown unity throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In the mid-1960s, 80% of Black students attended schools which were predominately Black. Similarly, 50% of Mexican students attended schools which were predominately Mexican. These schools were often overcrowded and poorly funded whereas white schools were newly built and not filled to capacity. The [[Chicano Blowouts]] of 1968, in which tens of thousands of students protested unequal conditions in Los Angeles schools, were accompanied by walkouts of thousands of Black students in South Los Angeles, who also participated. As noted by academic Daniel Martinez HoSang, Black and Mexican American parents and students were often \"plaintiffs in litigation related to educational adequacy and reform\" in court cases into the early 1970s.<ref>Martinez HoSang 2013, p. 120-123.</ref>\n\n=== Black-Yellow unity ===\nScholars have emphasized how Black-Yellow unity may be found in the shared experience of being subjected to slavery and servitude by European capitalism. Okihiro documents the \"[[coolie]]\" slave trade, in which approximately one-third of Asian enslaved peoples perished en route to the Americas under the forced authority of European and American ship captains, to assert that \"the African and Asian coolie were kinsmen and kinswomen in that world created by European masters. For example, over 124,000 Chinese \"coolies\" were shipped to [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]] to service Cuba's plantation system. Historian [[Franklin W. Knight]] writes that the Chinese became \"coinheritors with the Negroes of the lowliness of caste, the abuse, the ruthless exploitation.... Chinese labor in Cuba in the nineteenth century was slavery in every social aspect except the name.\" African and Asian forced laborers \"were related insofar as they were both essential for the maintenance of white supremacy, they were both members of an oppressed class of 'colored laborers, and they both were tied historically to the global network of labor migration as slaves and coolies.\"<ref>Okihiro 1994, p. 42-45.</ref> African American community and political leaders, such as [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[Blanche Bruce|Blanche K. Bruce]], recognized this shared oppression openly.<ref name=\":7\">Okihiro 1994, p. 48.</ref> \n\nRacism against African and Asian Americans was expressed via American law and proposed legislation. In [[California]] case ''The People v. George W. Hall'' (1854), Justice Charles J. Murray reversed the conviction of Hall, who had been convicted of murder based on the testimony of Chinese witnesses, based on legal precedents which had determined that \"no black or mulatto person, or Indian, shall be allowed to give evidence in favor of, or against a white man\" applied to Asian persons, since, in the American legal perception, \"''black'' meant ''nonwhite'' and ''white'' excluded all persons of color.\" The court upheld this decision on the grounds that white men should be shielded from the testimony \"of the degraded and demoralized caste\" of racially inferior peoples.<ref>Okihiro 1994, p. 50-51.</ref> In 1860, California legally banned African, Asian, and Amerindian children from attending schools designated for whites. In 1880, California enacted an anti-miscegenation law which prohibited marriages between white and nonwhite persons, whether \"negro, mulatto, or Mongolian.\"<ref>Okihiro 1994, p. 51-52.</ref> In 1927, challenged by [[Gong Lum v. Rice|Gong Lum]] regarding segregation in Jim Crow schools, the [[United States Supreme Court]] upheld segregation and concluded that Chinese were \"colored.\"<ref name=\":8\">Okihiro 1994, p. 53-54.</ref>\n\nThe American capitalist system was instituted along racial lines with the intention of creating divisions and preventing racial solidarity through pitting \"African against Asian workers, whereby Asian workers were used to discipline African workers and to depress their wages.\" Ethnocentrism and prejudice between African and Asian American workers often directly developed from \"ideas and practices of the master class.\" However, as Okihiro notes, while some African Americans were opposed to acts of cooperation and solidarity with Asian workers, the majority recognized that \"the enemy was white supremacy and that anti-Asianism was anti-Africanism in another guise.\" In 1925, following the establishment of [[A. Philip Randolph|A. Phillip Randolph]]'s [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]], the Pullman Company hired Filipinos, which the Brotherhood initially referred to as \"scab laborers.\" However, by the 1930s, unlike the [[American Federation of Labor]] which excluded both Africans and Asians, the Brotherhood recognized the common struggle between Asian and African workers:<ref name=\":8\" /><blockquote>We wish it understood, that the Brotherhood has nothing against Filipinos.

They have become white in every respect but color.\"<ref>Watkins 2012, p. 39-40.</ref>\n\n=== \"Mexican Americans\" and whiteness ===\n{{See also|Chicano}}\nPrior to the establishment of the [[Chicano Movement]] and the consolidation of [[Chicano]] identity in the late 1960s and 1970s, most Mexican American community leaders were fixated on attempting to appeal to the white establishment by claiming a white identity. Lisa Y.

In the 1940s and 1950s, as a precursor to the Chicano Movement, Mexican youth rejected the previous generation's racial aspirations and developed an \"alienated [[Pachuco]] culture that fashioned itself neither as Mexican nor American.\" As a result, some scholars designate a difference between Chicanos and Mexican Americans.

In some instances, such as in the case of forging an understanding of ''Yellow Power'', scholars have noted that the need to create a pan-Asian identity and dismantle existing stereotypes (e.g. \"[[model minority]]\") are also necessary steps which precede the formation of cross-racial unity, as Asian-American activists, writers, and scholars such as [[Amy Uyematsu]], [[Franklin Odo]], Larry Kubota, Keith Osajima, and [[Daniel Okimoto]] have addressed since the late 1960s.<ref>Watkins 2012, p. 35-42.</ref>\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe racial-political ideology of Black-Brown(-Yellow-Red) unity is inherently based in recognizing the similarities regarding historical and contemporary oppression endured by people of color globally. Scholars examining this racial-political ideology examine histories to demonstrate how the social and economic oppression of various groups of people of color are not isolated from one another, but rather share many similarities. As a result, the range of potential scholarship regarding Black-Brown-Yellow-Red unity may be broad, yet ultimately works toward a common goal of emphasizing the need for unity.<ref>Eisenstein 2004, p. 55.</ref> \n\n[[Zillah R. Eisenstein|Zillah Eisenstein]] and other scholars recognize how the need for unity among people of color emerged from the global nature of oppression and its relationship with capitalism, colonialism, masculinity, and white supremacy. As a result of this force, unity among people of color therefore operates as a means of resistance against this structure.<ref name=\":4\" /><blockquote>The language of otherness and difference became naturalized as the empire's continents become dark, and races become savage. There is a colonialist history to this becoming. Capitalism is the story of colonial conquest, of the Americas, then of Asia and Africa. And this conquest is part and parcel of an imperial masculinity which fantasizes the protection of white femininity. Dominance and domination are white and male. Colonialism simply presents itself as civilization and attempts to naturalize theft, rape, and dehumanization.<ref name=\":4\" /></blockquote>Similarly, [[Gary Okihiro]] recognizes how European colonialism was built on an ideology which justified \"their expansion and appropriation of land, labor, and resources in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.\" This ideology of white superiority was justified \"in the name of religion and science\" which was wielded by the Europeans to assert their own purported superiority and \"civilized\" status in comparison to the \"anti-Christian, uncivilized non-Europeans.\" According to Okihiro, when enacted through colonialism, this ideology led to a plundering of the world by Europeans and the global [[Slave Trade|slave trade]], which dehumanized enslaved peoples as units of production \u2013 a system of European development constructed on the underdevelopment of the [[Third World]].<ref name=\":6\">Okihiro 1994, p. 37-38.</ref>\n== History ==\n{{Black Power sidebar}}The first wave of movements asserting the objective of forming unity or coalitions between people of color and economically disadvantaged whites, began in the late 1960s in the United States and declined by the 1970s. Chicano activists such as [[Cesar Chavez]] in 1965-1966 and [[Reies L\u00f3pez Tijerina]] in 1967-1969 collaborated with civil rights and Black Power organizations to forge Black-Brown collaborative activist work. Organizations such as the [[Poor People's Campaign]], organized by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] in 1968 and Fred Hampton's [[Rainbow Coalition (Fred Hampton)|Rainbow Coalition]] in 1969 attempted to construct multiracial coalitions based on the common interest of dismantling the structures which created poverty.<ref>Mantler 2013, p. 5-6.</ref> However, as a result of police brutality, government surveillance and harassment, sabotage campaigns by government agencies and local police departments which targeted activist organizations with the intention of producing distrust and disunity among activists and organizations, and the assassination of leaders such as King and Hampton, this wave of multiracial coalition building declined by the 1970s.<ref>Mantler 2013, p. 9-10.</ref>\n\n=== Black-Brown unity ===\n{{Chicano and Mexican-American series}}\nAn unprecedented meeting of African American and Mexican American activists occurred in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] at the [[Alianza Federal de Pueblos Libres]] 1967 conference hosted by Reies Tijerina to explore Black and Brown unity, cooperation, and forge a cross-racial alliance. Representatives from nearly every major [[Black Power]] organization were present, including Anthony Akku Babu of the [[Black Panther Party]], [[Ron Karenga]] of the [[US Organization|Us organization]], James Dennis of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], Ralph Featherstone of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], and Walter Bremond of the Black Congress. Representatives of Chicano groups were also present, including [[Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Guti\u00e9rrez|Jos\u00e9 Angel Guti\u00e9rrez]] of the [[Mexican American Youth Organization]], [[Bert Corona]] of the [[Mexican American Political Association]], D\u00e1vid Sanchez of the [[Brown Berets]], and [[Rodolfo \"Corky\" Gonzales]] of the Crusade for Justice.<ref name=\":0\">Behnken 2012, p. 1-3.</ref> Activist [[Maria Varela]] was also invited to the conference and to join the Alianza by Tijerina.<ref name=\":9\" /> \n\nThe meeting ultimately produced the [[Treaty of Peace, Harmony, and Mutual Assistance]], a seven-part pact which acknowledged mutual respect and cooperative alliance. Along with the other representatives, Hopi spiritual leader [[Thomas Banyacya]], who was present at the conference along with many northern New Mexican villagers, also signed the treaty, which began with the following five articles:<ref name=\":9\">Mantler 2013, p. 74-75.</ref><blockquote>Article I: \"Both peoples do promise not to permit the members of either of said peoples to  make false propaganda of any kind whatsoever against each other, either by SPEECH or WRITING.\"\n\nArticle II: \"Both peoples (races) do promise, never to permit violence or hate, to break this SOLEMN TREATY between said peoples.\"\n\nArticle III: Both peoples, make a SOLEMN promise, to cure and remedy the historical errors and differences that exist between said peoples.\n\nArticle IV: Let it be known, that there will be a RECIPROCAL right to send an EMISSARY or DELEGATE to the conventions, Congresses, and National reunions of each of said peoples.\n\nArticle V: Let it be known that both peoples will have a political delegate to represent his interests and relations with the other.</blockquote>The treaty concluded with the following statement: \"this TREATY, will be valid between the two said peoples, as long as the Sun and Moon shall shine.\" While this agreement recognized that disagreements and conflicts between Black and Brown people had been present in a society which actively oppressed both groups, it signified an attempt to forge a coalitive liberation movement, and has been noted by scholars in comparative civil rights scholarship to represent the inception of an attempt to forge Black-Brown unity.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nAttempts at coalition work between Black and Brown people largely occurred in the [[southwestern United States]] and had notable regional differences. In [[California]], Black and Brown unity was exemplified through groups such as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the [[National Farm Workers Association]] to combat racial segregation and fight for economic rights for farm workers. In [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], many Black Americans united with Mexican American groups in order to strengthen their civil rights struggle. In [[Texas]], both Black and Brown Americans had their own widespread civil rights movements and unification was often not accentuated. Scholar Brian D. Behnken noted that \"when African American and Mexican American activists moderated the divisive power of race by focusing on economics, they recognized the shared oppression of each group\" and collectively fought for improved wages, hours, and working conditions.<ref>Behnken 2012, p. 8-9.</ref>\n\nInfluenced by the [[Black Power]] movement, some Chicanos accentuated the similarities between Black and Brown political struggles. In 1968, the [[La Raza (newspaper)|''La Raza'']] newspaper claimed the following on the relationship and shared struggle of Black Americans and Chicano communities: \"Our oppressions are one. Our dreams are one. Our demands are one. We suffer as one, we react as one, we struggle as one!\"<ref name=\":3\">L\u00f3pez 2009, p. 210-211.</ref> This new position was a considerable shift from previous generations of Mexican Americans, especially among community leaders, many of whom were openly [[assimilationist]] and sought to assert Mexican identity as white.<ref name=\":1\" /> One East Los Angeles study found that twice as many Mexican Americans favored cooperation with Black Americans in 1972 than in 1965, and concluded that \"when one takes into account traditional animosities marring Black-Mexican American relations,\" this was an \"impressive finding.\" However, while animosity from Mexican Americans notably lessened as a result of new expressions of solidarity among Chicanos, the total number of Mexican Americans who favored cooperation was still in the minority at 39%.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn Los Angeles, school segregation became a focal point of Black-Brown unity throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In the mid-1960s, 80% of Black students attended schools which were predominately Black. Similarly, 50% of Mexican students attended schools which were predominately Mexican. These schools were often overcrowded and poorly funded whereas white schools were newly built and not filled to capacity. The [[Chicano Blowouts]] of 1968, in which tens of thousands of students protested unequal conditions in Los Angeles schools, were accompanied by walkouts of thousands of Black students in South Los Angeles, who also participated. As noted by academic Daniel Martinez HoSang, Black and Mexican American parents and students were often \"plaintiffs in litigation related to educational adequacy and reform\" in court cases into the early 1970s.<ref>Martinez HoSang 2013, p. 120-123.</ref>\n\n=== Black-Yellow unity ===\nScholars have emphasized how Black-Yellow unity may be found in the shared experience of being subjected to slavery and servitude by European capitalism. Okihiro documents the \"[[coolie]]\" slave trade, in which approximately one-third of Asian enslaved peoples perished en route to the Americas under the forced authority of European and American ship captains, to assert that \"the African and Asian coolie were kinsmen and kinswomen in that world created by European masters. For example, over 124,000 Chinese \"coolies\" were shipped to [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]] to service Cuba's plantation system. Historian [[Franklin W. Knight]] writes that the Chinese became \"coinheritors with the Negroes of the lowliness of caste, the abuse, the ruthless exploitation.... Chinese labor in Cuba in the nineteenth century was slavery in every social aspect except the name.\" African and Asian forced laborers \"were related insofar as they were both essential for the maintenance of white supremacy, they were both members of an oppressed class of 'colored laborers, and they both were tied historically to the global network of labor migration as slaves and coolies.\"<ref>Okihiro 1994, p. 42-45.</ref> African American community and political leaders, such as [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[Blanche Bruce|Blanche K. Bruce]], recognized this shared oppression openly.<ref name=\":7\">Okihiro 1994, p. 48.</ref> \n\nRacism against African and Asian Americans was expressed via American law and proposed legislation. In [[California]] case ''The People v. George W. Hall'' (1854), Justice Charles J. Murray reversed the conviction of Hall, who had been convicted of murder based on the testimony of Chinese witnesses, based on legal precedents which had determined that \"no black or mulatto person, or Indian, shall be allowed to give evidence in favor of, or against a white man\" applied to Asian persons, since, in the American legal perception, \"''black'' meant ''nonwhite'' and ''white'' excluded all persons of color.\" The court upheld this decision on the grounds that white men should be shielded from the testimony \"of the degraded and demoralized caste\" of racially inferior peoples.<ref>Okihiro 1994, p. 50-51.</ref> In 1860, California legally banned African, Asian, and Amerindian children from attending schools designated for whites. In 1880, California enacted an anti-miscegenation law which prohibited marriages between white and nonwhite persons, whether \"negro, mulatto, or Mongolian.\"<ref>Okihiro 1994, p. 51-52.</ref> In 1927, challenged by [[Gong Lum v. Rice|Gong Lum]] regarding segregation in Jim Crow schools, the [[United States Supreme Court]] upheld segregation and concluded that Chinese were \"colored.\"<ref name=\":8\">Okihiro 1994, p. 53-54.</ref>\n\nThe American capitalist system was instituted along racial lines with the intention of creating divisions and preventing racial solidarity through pitting \"African against Asian workers, whereby Asian workers were used to discipline African workers and to depress their wages.\" Ethnocentrism and prejudice between African and Asian American workers often directly developed from \"ideas and practices of the master class.\" However, as Okihiro notes, while some African Americans were opposed to acts of cooperation and solidarity with Asian workers, the majority recognized that \"the enemy was white supremacy and that anti-Asianism was anti-Africanism in another guise.\" In 1925, following the establishment of [[A. Philip Randolph|A. Phillip Randolph]]'s [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]], the Pullman Company hired Filipinos, which the Brotherhood initially referred to as \"scab laborers.\" However, by the 1930s, unlike the [[American Federation of Labor]] which excluded both Africans and Asians, the Brotherhood recognized the common struggle between Asian and African workers:<ref name=\":8\" /><blockquote>We wish it understood, that the Brotherhood has nothing against Filipinos. They have been used against the unionization of Pullman porters just as Negroes have been used against the unionization of white workers... We will take in Filipinos as members... We want our Filipino brothers to understand that it is necessary for them to join the Brotherhood in order to help secure conditions and wages which they too will benefit from.<ref name=\":8\" /></blockquote>\n\n== Challenges ==\nAttempts at fostering Black-Brown-Yellow-Red unity have confronted several challenges both historically and contemporarily, some which have originated external to Black and Brown communities and organizations, and others which have originated from within them.\n\n=== Asian Americans and the \"model minority\" ===\n{{Main article|Model minority}}\nIn 1956, social scientists [[William Caudill]] and George De Vos initially hypothesized on the commonalities between Japanese culture and \"the value systems found in American middle class culture\" and positioned Asian Americans as reflecting similarities with white culture or existing as a \"model minority.\" Gary Okihiro notes that, although Caudill and De Vos had attempted to \"distinguish between identity and compatibility, similarity and sharing, subsequent variations on the theme depicted Asians as 'just like whites'.\" Okihiro notes that because of the manner in which race is conceptualized in the [[United States]], as a binary between white and black, Asian, Amerindian, and Latinos are positioned as \"somewhere along the divide between black and white.\" While Okihiro acknowledges that Asian Americans have \"served the master class,\" whether as an oppressed class on a similar status to Black Americans or as a model minority class who presently may be perceived as \"near whites,\" he ultimately concludes that \"yellow is emphatically neither white nor black; but insofar as Asians and Africans share a subordinate position to the master class, yellow is a shade of black, and black, a shade of yellow.\"<ref name=\":5\">Okihiro 1994, p. 32-34.</ref>\n\nIn his 1973 essay entitled \"Yellow Power,\" Larry Kubota echoes the sentiments of [[Frantz Fanon]]'s notion regarding the psychic violence of colonialism and refers to the model minority stereotype as a myth which had conditioned some Asians in the United States to believe that \"there was no need for change because their own social and economic status was assured.\" As scholar Rychetta Watkins notes of Kubota's perceptions on the notion of the Asian model minority, \"this myth not only flattened the image of the community to a small group of successful second- and third- generation Chinese Americans and Japanese Americans, it also isolated Asian Americans from other ethnic minorities, hindering the coalitions which would be necessary for creating a revolutionary coalition in America.\" Amy Uyematsu similarly reflects that \"Asian Americans are perpetuating white racism [...] as they allow white America to hold up the ''successful'' Oriental image before other minority groups as the model to emulate.\" Keith Osajima addresses Asians in America who use the model minority myth to uphold white supremacy: \"fully committed to a system that subordinates them on the basis of non-whiteness, Asian Americans still tried to gain complete acceptance by denying their yellowness.

It is operated by the South Carolina Educational Television Commission, an agency of the South Carolina state government.  It is a sister network to [[South Carolina Educational Television]].\n\nThe network's primary operations are located on George Rogers Boulevard in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], across from [[Williams-Brice Stadium]].  Satellite studios are located in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina|Spartanburg]], [[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort]], [[Sumter, South Carolina|Sumter]] and [[Rock Hill, South Carolina|Rock Hill]].\n\nThe network's eight stations provide at least secondary coverage to nearly all of South Carolina, plus portions of [[North Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U. S. state)|Georgia]].\n\n==History==\nThe Educational Television Commission had its mission broadened to include radio in the late 1960s.  In 1972, WEPR in [[Clemson, South Carolina|Clemson]] (now in [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]]) signed on the air as the state's first public radio station.  Seven more transmitters signed on in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nUntil 2001, the stations were known as the \"South Carolina Educational Radio Network,\" airing a mix of [[classical music]] and NPR news and talk.  However, since much of the state gets grade B coverage from at least two full NPR member stations, the ETV Commission opted to split the radio stations into two networks.  Four stations continued to air a mix of classical music and NPR programming, while three aired an expanded schedule of NPR news and talk.  The eighth station, WNSC-FM in Rock Hill, began airing exclusively [[jazz]] music in order to avoid programming duplication with [[WFAE]] in Charlotte.\n\nIn 2003, SCERN rebranded as \"ETV Radio\" in order to link the radio stations more closely with their television sisters.\n\nIn 2009, ETV Radio began streaming both the Classical and News networks on the Internet; prior to this, it had been one of the few NPR members not to offer live streaming online.\n\nIn 2011, listeners gave $1.5 million in donations toward the construction of a new studio facility, which opened in April 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scetv.org/index.php/press/release/etv_radio_unveils_new_radio_facilities_grand_opening_on_thursday_nov._/ |title=\"In Our Schools\" Features Finalists in Teacher of the Year Program |publisher=SCETV |date=April 9, 2013 |accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2015, ETV president Linda O'Byron announced that in response to a listener survey, ETV Radio would rebrand as South Carolina Public Radio.<ref>O'Byron, Linda.

The island is the second largest in the [[Alor Archipelago|Alor archipelago]], lying just west of the largest island [[Alor Island|Alor]].\n\nTeiwa is a morphosyntactically simple language with little inflection and is as such described as an [[isolating language]], also known as an analytic language. It is pronounced by a complex pronoun system.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nTeiwa is also known as ''Bahasa Teiwa'' (the Teiwa language) in Indonesia. Teiwa itself is a [[nominal compound]] and can be translated as ''tei wa'',  meaning \"tree leaf\". The term \"Teiwa\" derives from the name of the main clan that speaks it. Generally, when Teiwa speakers refer to their own language, especially to differentiate it from the national language Indonesian, they call it \"pitarau\"<!--1p.inclusive-language--> (our language).\n\n==Classification==\nTeiwa is often classified as part of the [[Trans\u2013New Guinea languages|Trans-New Guinea language]] family, but this is disputed. One reason is little lexical proof as well as the large geographical distance from the main island of New Guinea. An alternative classification is as part of the [[Timor\u2013Alor\u2013Pantar languages|Timor-Alor-Pantar]] language family, which is approximately 3000 years old. Within this language family, Teiwa is further categorized within the sub-family of the Alor-Pantar languages, which are 20 in number. This classification bases on the high number of [[cognate]]s as well as very similar pronoun systems.\n\n==Background==\nTeiwa is spoken on the island of [[Pantar]], which is part of the [[Alor Archipelago]], located between [[Australia]] and [[Indonesia]]. The island is located approximately 1000 km from the main island of [[New Guinea]]. It stretches 50 km from north to south, and between 11 and 29 km from east to west. The island is split into two distinct geographic regions: the dry and less populated lowlands in the west, and the highlands in the east, which are mountainous, volcanic and densely populated.\n\nThere were 4000 documented native speakers of Teiwa in 2010. The speakers live primarily in the ''desas'' (administrative villages in Indonesia) Lebang, Boweli, Kalib, Nule, Kadir, and Madar, a village of 460 inhabitants (as of 2007). Lebang is the main village, where Teiwa was still spoken by most people, young and old. Nevertheless, the national language of [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] as well as the Chinese-influenced Alor-[[Malay_trade_and_creole_languages#Alor_Malay|Malay]] tend to be spoken by the younger generations and used for teaching in schools. As a result of this dwindling number of native speakers, Teiwa is listed as an [[endangered language]].\n\nThe ''Grammar of Teiwa'' by Margaret Klamer is the only linguistic documentation besides a short word list from Stokhof (1975). Klamer gathered most of her data in the village of Madar.\n\n==Phonology==\nThe following is a phonological description of Teiwa:<ref name=\"Klamer 2010\" />\n\n===Consonants===\nTeiwa has an inventory of 20 consonants, a high amount relative to other Papuan languages. In the table below, the orthographic representation of the sound is given in parentheses to the right. The contrast between the [[Pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] and [[Glottal consonant|glottal]] [[Fricative consonant|fricative]] shows itself as exceptional within the languages of Eastern Indonesia, as is the existence of both liquids /l/ and /\u026d/. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! colspan=\"1\" |Bilabial\n! colspan=\"1\" |Labiodental\n! colspan=\"1\" |Alveolar\n! colspan=\"1\" |Retroflex\n! colspan=\"1\" |Palatal\n! colspan=\"1\" |Velar\n! colspan=\"1\" |Uvular\n! colspan=\"1\" |Pharyngeal\n! colspan=\"1\" |Glottal\n|-\n!Plosive (Stop/Oral Occlusive)\n|[[Voiceless bilabial stop|p]] [[Voiced bilabial stop|b]]\n|\n|[[Voiceless alveolar stop|t]] [[Voiced alveolar stop|d]]\n|\n|\n|[[Voiceless velar stop|k]] [[Voiced velar stop|\u0261]]\n|[[Voiceless uvular stop|q]] (q)\n|\n|[[Voiceless glottal stop|\u0294]] (')\n|-\n!Nasal\n|[[Voiced bilabial nasal|m]]\n|\n| [[Voiced alveolar nasal|n]]\n|\n|\n|[[Voiced velar nasal|\u014b]] (ng)\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Fricative\n|[[Voiceless bilabial fricative|\u0278]] (f)\n|   [[Voiced labiodental fricative|v]] \n|[[Voiceless alveolar fricative|s]]\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|[[Voiceless pharyngeal fricative|\u0127]] (x)\n|[[Voiceless glottal fricative|h]] (h)\n|-\n!Approximant (Glide)\n|[[Voiced labio-velar approximant|w]]\n|\n|\n|\n|  [[Voiced palatal approximant|j]] (y)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Lateral Approximant (Liquid)\n|\n|\n|  [[Voiced alveolar lateral|l]] \n|   [[Voiced retroflex lateral approximant|\u026d]] \n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nThe [[allophone]]s of /\u0278/ are [\u0278] and [p]. The allophones of /v/ are [v] and [f].\n\n===Vowels===\nTeiwa has an inventory of 5 [[cardinal vowels]]. The two [[high vowel]]s occur as short (/i/, /u/) and long (/u\u02d0/, /i\u02d0/).  As in the consonant table, the orthographic representations are given in the parentheses to the right. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Front\n!Back\n|-\n|High/Close\n|/[[Close front unrounded vowel|i]]/ /i\u02d0/ (ii)\n|/[[Close back rounded vowel|u]]/ /u\u02d0/ (uu)\n|-\n|Mid\n|/[[Open-mid front unrounded vowel|\u025b]]/ (e)\n|/[[Open-mid back rounded vowel|\u0254]]/ (o)\n|-\n|Low/Open\n|/[[Open front unrounded vowel|a]]/ (aa)\n|/[[Open back unrounded vowel|\u0251]]/ (a)\n|}\nThe allophones of /a/ are the short [a] and the long [a\u02d0].\n\n==Grammar==\nThe grammar of Teiwa is as follows:<ref name=\"Klamer 2010\" />\n===Grammatical relations===\nGrammatical relations are the relations between [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]] and [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]]. In '''Teiwa''', these are formally expressed through pronouns from the object and subject paradigms, as well as a strict [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] order.\n\nThe '''subject relation''' is the agent argument of a transitive verb, from hereon denoted with '''A''', or the single argument of an intransitive predicate, from hereon denoted with '''S'''. Both are encoded similarly.\n\nThe '''object relation''' is the non-agent argument of a transitive verb, from hereon denoted with '''P'''.\n\n===Basic constituent order===\nTeiwa is syntactically '''head-final''', with Object-Verb constituent order: preverbal subject and object, sentence final verbs, negations, and conjunctions.\n\nWith intransitive verbs, there is '''SV-order'''. With transitive verbs, there is '''APV-order'''.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!S\n!V\n!A\n!P\n!V\n|-\n|'''''[...ki uwaad nuk]'''''\n|'''''yaa'''''\n|'''''\u00f8'''''\n|'''''[bif ga'an]'''''\n|'''''tu'u'''''\n|-\n|eagle big one\n|descend\n|\n|child 3s\n|knock\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |'...a big eagle came down [and] picked that child...'\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |<small>Abbreviations: 3s = third person singular</small>\n|}\nThe '''A''' of the second (transitive) verb ''tu'uk'' coreferences with (shares the same reference as) the '''S''' of the first (intransitive) verb ''yaa'' in the example above.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!A\n!P\n!V\n!S\n!V\n|-\n|'''''...qau ba    a'''''\n|'''''[a-sepatu       qas]'''''\n|'''''usan ga-luxun-luxun ta'''''\n|'''''a'''''\n|'''''xer-an      pati.'''''\n|-\n|good SEQ 3s\n|3s-shoe(IND) split\n|lift      3s-RDP-high   TOP\n|3s\n|yell-REAL PROG\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |'...so he lifts up one side of a shoe very high while he is yelling...'\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |<small>Abbreviations: 3s = third person singular, SEQ = sequential marker, RDP = reduplication, TOP = topic (marked with ''ta''), REAL = realis, PROG = progressive</small>\n|}\nIn this example, the Subject ('''A''') is the pronominal, and the object ('''P''') is the lexical NP (noun phrase).\n\n=== Personal pronouns ===\nThere are three pronoun paradigms in Teiwa: '''subject''', '''object''', and '''possessiv'''. The 'theme vowel' for singular pronouns is '''''<a>''''', and for plural pronouns it is '''''<nowiki><i></nowiki>'''''. The second syllable of the long pronoun is a copy of the theme vowel with the addition of an '''''-n.'''''<ref name=\"Klamer 2010\" />\n\nThere is a contrast of '''inclusive-exclusive first person plural''', one of the most prominent features to diffuse from the [[austronesian languages]] into the Papuan languages.\n\n====Subject pronouns====\nSubject pronouns appear before the object and verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n|Long subject pronoun\n|Short subject pronoun\n|-\n|1s\n|'''''na'an'''''\n|'''''na'''''\n|-\n|2s\n|'''''ha'an'''''\n|'''''ha'''''\n|-\n|3s\n|'''''a'an'''''\n|'''''a'''''\n|-\n|1p.exclusive\n|'''''ni'in'''''\n|'''''ni'''''\n|-\n|1p.inclusive\n|'''''pi'in'''''\n|'''''pi'''''\n|-\n|2p\n|'''''yi'in'''''\n|'''''yi'''''\n|-\n|3p\n|'''''iman'''''\n|'''''i, a'''''\n|-\n|3p.elsewhere\n|'''''i'in'''''\n|'''''i, a'''''\n|-\n|distributive\n|'''''ta'an'''''\n|'''''ta'''''\n|}\nThe '''long subject pronoun is''' used to set [[Focus (linguistics)|contrastive focus]] (me, not you), which can further be marked with '''''la''''' as the focus NP. They look nearly identical to the <u>free object pronouns</u>, save for the 3s and 3p.elsewhere pronouns.\n\nExamples:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!'''''<u>Na'an</u>'''''\n! colspan=\"2\" |'''''hamar.'''''\n|-\n|<u>1s.long</u>\n| colspan=\"2\" |pray\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |'<u>I</u> pray [not you].'\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|'''''<u>Na'an</u>'''''\n|'''''la'''''\n|'''''hamar.'''''\n|-\n|<u>1s.long</u>\n|FOC\n|pray\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |'<u>I</u> am the one who prays.'\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |<small>Abbreviations: 1s = first person singular</small>\n|}\nThe '''short subject pronoun''' is a \"reduced pronoun\" which can stand alone in place of nominal constituents, and is separable from the verb.

In this case, number is specified through use of the additional pronoun '''''ga'an''''' (singular), '''''iman''''' (plural), or the plural word '''''non''''' in the object NP.\n\nThe 3s (third person singular) object pronoun maintains a further purpose as a [[Demonstrative pronoun|demonstrative]] pronoun to introduce new participants into the discourse.\n\n=====[[Possessive pronouns]]=====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n|Long pronoun\n|Short pronoun\n|Prefix\n|-\n|1s\n|'''''na'an'''''\n|'''''na'''''\n|'''''n(a)-'''''\n|-\n|2s\n|'''''ha'an'''''\n|'''''ha'''''\n|'''''h(a)-'''''\n|-\n|3s\n|'''''a'an'''''\n|'''''a'''''\n|'''g(a)-, a-'''\n|-\n|1p.exclusive\n|'''''ni'in'''''\n|'''''ni'''''\n|'''''n(i)-'''''\n|-\n|1p.inclusive\n|'''''pi'in'''''\n|'''''pi'''''\n|'''''p(i)-'''''\n|-\n|2p\n|'''''yi'in'''''\n|'''''yi'''''\n|'''''y(i),'''''\n|-\n|3p\n|'''''iman'''''\n| -\n|'''g(i)-, a-, ga-'''\n|-\n|3p.elsewhere\n|'''''gi'in'''''\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|distributive\n|'''''ta'an'''''\n|'''''ta'''''\n|'''''t(a)-'''''\n|}\nThe final two pronouns, '''elsewhere''' and '''distributive,''' are unique. The 3p.elsewhere pronoun is used in a situation where the speaker cannot see the referent, because the referent is somewhere else.\n\nFor example:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!''<u>I'in</u>''\n!''g-oqai''\n!''ga-wei.''\n|-\n|<u>they.elsewhere</u>\n|3s.child\n|3s.bathe\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |'They (elsewhere) bathe/have bathed his child.'\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |<small>Abbreviations: 3s = third person singular</small>\n|}\nContrast this with the standard, unmarked form (3p):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!''<u>Iman</u>''\n!''g-oqai''\n!''ga-wei.''\n|-\n|<u>they</u>\n|3s.child\n|3s.bathe\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |'They bathe/have bathed his child.'\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |<small>Abbreviations: 3s = third person singular</small>\n|}\nThe '''distributive possessive pronoun''' ('''''ta'an, ta''''', or '''''ta'''-'') refers to a (non-collective) plural number of human referents, often in reciprocal contexts.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!''Ta'an''\n!''tara'''\n!''mis!''\n|-\n|DISTR\n|be.in.a.row\n|sit\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |'Let's sit in a row!'

The noun, with a few exceptions, cannot be reduplicated, unlike verbs, adverbs, and adjectives. (See '''Reduplication''' below.)\n\nThere is no marking for number, gender, or case on nouns. Instead, [[Grammatical person|person]] and [[Grammatical number|number]] is marked via a '''possessor prefix''' on the noun.\n\n====Noun phrases====\nIn '''possessed NP's,''' the possessor (the noun which possesses) precedes the possessee (the noun which is possessed), as in the examples below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''''<u>Rai</u>'''''\n|'''''<u>ga-yaf</u>'''''\n|-\n|<u>king</u>\n|<u>3s-house</u>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |'The king's house.'\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |<small>Abbreviations: 3s = third person singular</small>\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''''<u>Pi</u>'''''\n|'''''<u>pi-krian</u>'''''\n|'''i'''\n|'''er'''\n|'''a'''\n|'''gula''''\n|'''sin.'''\n|-\n|<u>1pi</u>\n|<u>1pi.work</u>\n|PROX\n|make\n|3s\n|finish\n|first\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |'We first finish our work here.'\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |<small>Abbreviations: 1pi = first person plural inclusive, PROX = proximal</small>\n|}\nIn '''non-possessed NP's,''' the noun comes first, followed by the modifying element, such as an adjective.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''''Xaf'''''\n|'''''uwaad'''''\n|-\n|fish\n|big\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |'A big fish.'\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''''Uy'''''\n|'''''a'''''\n|-\n|person\n|PROX\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |'This person.'\n|}\n\n====Noun classes====\nThe Teiwa nouns can be divided into two main classes: '''Proper nouns''' and '''common nouns'''.\n\n===== Proper nouns =====\nProper nouns are not modifiable. Examples are listed below.<ref name=\"Klamer 2010\" />\n\n<u>Male names</u>: '''''Edi, Goli, Lius, Mase, Nabas, Ribu'''''\n\n<u>Female names</u>: '''''Bruang, Leti, Malai, Mani, Sam'''''\n\n<u>Family names</u>: '''''Biri, Blegar, Bui, Lau, Qoli, Ribu, Unu'''''\n\n<u>Clan names</u>: '''''Barawasi, Burilak, Loxoq, Perang Tubi, Qailipi'''''\n\n===== Common nouns =====\nThe '''common nouns''' can be further divided into subclasses:\n\n====== Nouns with [[Alienable possession|alienable]] possession ======\nIn this subclass the <u>possessor prefix is optional</u>. [[Focus (linguistics)|Focus]] can be placed with use of a long pronoun. Examples include: ''yaf'' 'house', ''kon'' 'shirt', ''qavif'' 'goat'.\n\n====== Nouns with [[Inalienable possession|inalienable]] possession ======\nHere the <u>possessor prefix is obligatory</u>, to the point that native speakers will not recognize the word without the prefix. Nouns with inalienable possession include body parts, and kinship terms (except for ''emaq'' 'wife' where the prefix is optional as with alienable possession).\n\n====== Locational nouns ======\nThis last subclass of nouns denote location. Examples include: '''''wanan''''' 'side', '''''fan''''' 'front', '''''siban''''' 'behind', '''''ragan''''' 'outside', '''''tag''''' 'up(stairs); above speaker (relatively close)'.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!''Uy''\n!''ragan''\n!''me'''\n|-\n|people \n|outside\n|be.in\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |'Some people are outside' / 'Someone is outside'\n|}\n\n====[[Nominalization]]====\nThere is no dedicated morphology for nominalization in Teiwa. Instead the third person (3p) possessor prefix ''-ga'' has a secondary function of attaching to the root form of adjectives, locational nouns, adverbs, and question words.<ref name=\"Klamer 2010\" />\n\n===Verbs===\nTeiwa verbs carry no marking for [[Case (linguistics)|case]] or [[Gender (linguistics)|gender]]. There is only one verbal [[Suffix (linguistics)|suffix]];\n\n'''-''(a)n''''' for the marking of [[Realis mood|realis]] status. Only verbs take an object [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]. Inflected prefixes index person and number traits of animate objects on the verb. Subjects and inanimate objects are <u>not</u> indexed on the verb.\n\nTeiwa has [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]] and [[transitive verb]]s. The transitive verbs are monotransitive, meaning they have a single grammatical object.\n\n====Verb classes====\n\n=====Transitive verbs=====\nThe transitive verbs in Teiwa can be divided into numerous sub classes, based on how they encode [[Animacy|animate and inanimate objects]] differently. In this case, animate or inanimate refers explicitly to a third person referent, since first and second person referents are inherently animate.\n\n;Class (i): Verbs with an object [[prefix]], with an animate object (\"sb-somebody\")\nThis class expresses the object with an object-marking prefix on the verb.

This means that the children of same-sex siblings are considered to be siblings (brother, sister), and therefore not fit for marriage with one another. Children of non-same sex siblings of the parents are seen as cross-cousins and are the perfect candidates for marriage with each other. These children are also in a different clan than the children of the same-sex siblings of the parents.\n\n=== Kinship terms ===\nThe main kinship terms are listed here:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''''emaq'''''\n|wife\n|-\n|'''''misi'''''\n|husband\n|-\n|'''''bif'''''\n|child, 'younger sibling'\n|-\n|'''''biar (kriman)'''''\n|children\n|-\n|'''''na-gas qai'''''\n|my sister\n|-\n|'''''n-ian qai'''''\n|my brother\n|-\n|'''''n-ian'''''\n|(female) cousin of ego, in other clan\n|-\n|'''''na-dias'''''\n|(male) cousin of ego, in other clan\n|-\n|'''''na-rat (emaq)'''''\n|daughter of ego's brother, in other clan (potential daughter-in-law)\n|-\n|'''''na'ii''''' \n|son of ego's brother, in other clan (potential son-in-law)\n|-\n|'''''na-rata''''''\n|my grandfather/mother\n|-\n|'''''na-rat qai'''''\n|my grandchild\n|}\nFrom the point of view of female ego:\n\nThe \"classificatory siblings\" refer to the actual siblings, as well as the children of the <u>mother's sister</u> and the <u>father's brother</u>. As it is considered rude to call family members by their given name, these siblings are addressed as '''''matu'''''' when older and '''''bif''''' when younger, and '''''ka'au''''' when the same sex as the speaker.\n\nThe \"classificatory parents\" are the <u>father's brother</u> ('''''n-oma''''' 'my father'), as well as the <u>mother's sister</u> ('''''na-xala''''' 'my mother').

The island is the second largest in the [[Alor Archipelago|Alor archipelago]], lying just west of the largest island [[Alor Island|Alor]].\n\nTeiwa is a morphosyntactically simple language with little inflection and is as such described as an [[isolating language]], also known as an analytic language. It is pronounced by a complex pronoun system.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nTeiwa is also known as ''Bahasa Teiwa'' (the Teiwa language) in Indonesia. Teiwa itself is a [[nominal compound]] and can be translated as ''tei wa'',  meaning \"tree leaf\". The term \"Teiwa\" derives from the name of the main clan that speaks it. Generally, when Teiwa speakers refer to their own language, especially to differentiate it from the national language Indonesian, they call it \"pitarau\"<!--1p.inclusive-language--> (our language).\n\n==Classification==\nTeiwa is often classified as part of the [[Trans\u2013New Guinea languages|Trans-New Guinea language]] family, but this is disputed. One reason is little lexical proof as well as the large geographical distance from the main island of New Guinea. An alternative classification is as part of the [[Timor\u2013Alor\u2013Pantar languages|Timor-Alor-Pantar]] language family, which is approximately 3000 years old. Within this language family, Teiwa is further categorized within the sub-family of the Alor-Pantar languages, which are 20 in number. This classification bases on the high number of [[cognate]]s as well as very similar pronoun systems.\n\n==Background==\nTeiwa is spoken on the island of [[Pantar]], which is part of the [[Alor Archipelago]], located between [[Australia]] and [[Indonesia]]. The island is located approximately 1000 km from the main island of [[New Guinea]]. It stretches 50 km from north to south, and between 11 and 29 km from east to west. The island is split into two distinct geographic regions: the dry and less populated lowlands in the west, and the highlands in the east, which are mountainous, volcanic and densely populated.\n\nThere were 4000 documented native speakers of Teiwa in 2010. The speakers live primarily in the ''desas'' (administrative villages in Indonesia) Lebang, Boweli, Kalib, Nule, Kadir, and Madar, a village of 460 inhabitants (as of 2007). Lebang is the main village, where Teiwa was still spoken by most people, young and old. Nevertheless, the national language of [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] as well as the Chinese-influenced Alor-[[Malay_trade_and_creole_languages#Alor_Malay|Malay]] tend to be spoken by the younger generations and used for teaching in schools. As a result of this dwindling number of native speakers, Teiwa is listed as an [[endangered language]].\n\nThe ''Grammar of Teiwa'' by Margaret Klamer is the only linguistic documentation besides a short word list from Stokhof (1975). Klamer gathered most of her data in the village of Madar.\n\n==Phonology==\nThe following is a phonological description of Teiwa:<ref name=\"Klamer 2010\" />\n\n===Consonants===\nTeiwa has an inventory of 20 consonants, a high amount relative to other Papuan languages. In the table below, the orthographic representation of the sound is given in parentheses to the right. The contrast between the [[Pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] and [[Glottal consonant|glottal]] [[Fricative consonant|fricative]] shows itself as exceptional within the languages of Eastern Indonesia, as is the existence of both liquids /l/ and /\u026d/. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! colspan=\"1\" |Bilabial\n! colspan=\"1\" |Labiodental\n! colspan=\"1\" |Alveolar\n! colspan=\"1\" |Retroflex\n! colspan=\"1\" |Palatal\n! colspan=\"1\" |Velar\n! colspan=\"1\" |Uvular\n! colspan=\"1\" |Pharyngeal\n! colspan=\"1\" |Glottal\n|-\n!Plosive (Stop/Oral Occlusive)\n|[[Voiceless bilabial stop|p]] [[Voiced bilabial stop|b]]\n|\n|[[Voiceless alveolar stop|t]] [[Voiced alveolar stop|d]]\n|\n|\n|[[Voiceless velar stop|k]] [[Voiced velar stop|\u0261]]\n|[[Voiceless uvular stop|q]] (q)\n|\n|[[Voiceless glottal stop|\u0294]] (')\n|-\n!Nasal\n|[[Voiced bilabial nasal|m]]\n|\n| [[Voiced alveolar nasal|n]]\n|\n|\n|[[Voiced velar nasal|\u014b]] (ng)\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Fricative\n|[[Voiceless bilabial fricative|\u0278]] (f)\n|   [[Voiced labiodental fricative|v]] \n|[[Voiceless alveolar fricative|s]]\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|[[Voiceless pharyngeal fricative|\u0127]] (x)\n|[[Voiceless glottal fricative|h]] (h)\n|-\n!Approximant (Glide)\n|[[Voiced labio-velar approximant|w]]\n|\n|\n|\n|  [[Voiced palatal approximant|j]] (y)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Lateral Approximant (Liquid)\n|\n|\n|  [[Voiced alveolar lateral|l]] \n|   [[Voiced retroflex lateral approximant|\u026d]] \n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nThe [[allophone]]s of /\u0278/ are [\u0278] and [p]. The allophones of /v/ are [v] and [f].\n\n===Vowels===\nTeiwa has an inventory of 5 [[cardinal vowels]]. The two [[high vowel]]s occur as short (/i/, /u/) and long (/u:/, /i:/).  As in the consonant table, the orthographic representations are given in the parentheses to the right. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Front\n!Back\n|-\n|High/Close\n|/[[Close front unrounded vowel|i]]/ /i:/ (ii)\n|/[[Close back rounded vowel|u]]/ /u:/ (uu)\n|-\n|Mid\n|/[[Open-mid front unrounded vowel|\u025b]]/ (e)\n|/[[Open-mid back rounded vowel|\u0254]]/ (o)\n|-\n|Low/Open\n|/[[Open front unrounded vowel|a]]/ (aa)\n|/[[Open back unrounded vowel|\u0251]]/ (a)\n|}\nThe allophones of /a/ are the short [a] and the long [a:].\n\n==Grammar==\nThe grammar of Teiwa is as follows:<ref name=\"Klamer 2010\" />\n===Grammatical relations===\nGrammatical relations are the relations between [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]] and [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]]. In '''Teiwa''', these are formally expressed through pronouns from the object and subject paradigms, as well as a strict [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] order.\n\nThe '''subject relation''' is the agent argument of a transitive verb, from hereon denoted with '''A''', or the single argument of an intransitive predicate, from hereon denoted with '''S'''. Both are encoded similarly.\n\nThe '''object relation''' is the non-agent argument of a transitive verb, from hereon denoted with '''P'''.\n\n===Basic constituent order===\nTeiwa is syntactically '''head-final''', with Object-Verb constituent order: preverbal subject and object, sentence final verbs, negations, and conjunctions.\n\nWith intransitive verbs, there is '''SV-order'''. With transitive verbs, there is '''APV-order'''.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!S\n!V\n!A\n!P\n!V\n|-\n|'''''[...ki uwaad nuk]'''''\n|'''''yaa'''''\n|'''''\u00f8'''''\n|'''''[bif ga'an]'''''\n|'''''tu'u'''''\n|-\n|eagle big one\n|descend\n|\n|child 3s\n|knock\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |'...a big eagle came down [and] picked that child...'\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |<small>Abbreviations: 3s = third person singular</small>\n|}\nThe '''A''' of the second (transitive) verb ''tu'uk'' coreferences with (shares the same reference as) the '''S''' of the first (intransitive) verb ''yaa'' in the example above.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!A\n!P\n!V\n!S\n!V\n|-\n|'''''...qau ba    a'''''\n|'''''[a-sepatu       qas]'''''\n|'''''usan ga-luxun-luxun ta'''''\n|'''''a'''''\n|'''''xer-an      pati.'''''\n|-\n|good SEQ 3s\n|3s-shoe(IND) split\n|lift      3s-RDP-high   TOP\n|3s\n|yell-REAL PROG\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |'...so he lifts up one side of a shoe very high while he is yelling...'\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |<small>Abbreviations: 3s = third person singular, SEQ = sequential marker, RDP = reduplication, TOP = topic (marked with ''ta''), REAL = realis, PROG = progressive</small>\n|}\nIn this example, the Subject ('''A''') is the pronominal, and the object ('''P''') is the lexical NP (noun phrase).\n\n=== Personal pronouns ===\nThere are three pronoun paradigms in Teiwa: '''subject''', '''object''', and '''possessiv'''. The 'theme vowel' for singular pronouns is '''''<a>''''', and for plural pronouns it is '''''<nowiki><i></nowiki>'''''. The second syllable of the long pronoun is a copy of the theme vowel with the addition of an '''''-n.'''''<ref name=\"Klamer 2010\" />\n\nThere is a contrast of '''inclusive-exclusive first person plural''', one of the most prominent features to diffuse from the [[austronesian languages]] into the Papuan languages.\n\n====Subject pronouns====\nSubject pronouns appear before the object and verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n|Long subject pronoun\n|Short subject pronoun\n|-\n|1s\n|'''''na'an'''''\n|'''''na'''''\n|-\n|2s\n|'''''ha'an'''''\n|'''''ha'''''\n|-\n|3s\n|'''''a'an'''''\n|'''''a'''''\n|-\n|1p.exclusive\n|'''''ni'in'''''\n|'''''ni'''''\n|-\n|1p.inclusive\n|'''''pi'in'''''\n|'''''pi'''''\n|-\n|2p\n|'''''yi'in'''''\n|'''''yi'''''\n|-\n|3p\n|'''''iman'''''\n|'''''i, a'''''\n|-\n|3p.elsewhere\n|'''''i'in'''''\n|'''''i, a'''''\n|-\n|distributive\n|'''''ta'an'''''\n|'''''ta'''''\n|}\nThe '''long subject pronoun is''' used to set [[Focus (linguistics)|contrastive focus]] (me, not you), which can further be marked with '''''la''''' as the focus NP.

In this case, number is specified through use of the additional pronoun '''''ga'an''''' (singular), '''''iman''''' (plural), or the plural word '''''non''''' in the object NP.\n\nThe 3s (third person singular) object pronoun maintains a further purpose as a [[Demonstrative pronoun|demonstrative]] pronoun to introduce new participants into the discourse.\n\n=====[[Possessive pronouns]]=====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n|Long pronoun\n|Short pronoun\n|Prefix\n|-\n|1s\n|'''''na'an'''''\n|'''''na'''''\n|'''''n(a)-'''''\n|-\n|2s\n|'''''ha'an'''''\n|'''''ha'''''\n|'''''h(a)-'''''\n|-\n|3s\n|'''''a'an'''''\n|'''''a'''''\n|'''g(a)-, a-'''\n|-\n|1p.exclusive\n|'''''ni'in'''''\n|'''''ni'''''\n|'''''n(i)-'''''\n|-\n|1p.inclusive\n|'''''pi'in'''''\n|'''''pi'''''\n|'''''p(i)-'''''\n|-\n|2p\n|'''''yi'in'''''\n|'''''yi'''''\n|'''''y(i),'''''\n|-\n|3p\n|'''''iman'''''\n| -\n|'''g(i)-, a-, ga-'''\n|-\n|3p.elsewhere\n|'''''gi'in'''''\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|distributive\n|'''''ta'an'''''\n|'''''ta'''''\n|'''''t(a)-'''''\n|}\nThe final two pronouns, '''elsewhere''' and '''distributive,''' are unique.

The noun, with a few exceptions, cannot be reduplicated, unlike verbs, adverbs, and adjectives. (See '''Reduplication''' below.)\n\nThere is no marking for number, gender, or case on nouns. Instead, [[Grammatical person|person]] and [[Grammatical number|number]] is marked via a '''possessor prefix''' on the noun.\n\n====Noun phrases====\nIn '''possessed NP's,''' the possessor (the noun which possesses) precedes the possessee (the noun which is possessed), as in the examples below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''''<u>Rai</u>'''''\n|'''''<u>ga-yaf</u>'''''\n|-\n|<u>king</u>\n|<u>3s-house</u>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |'The king's house.'\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |<small>Abbreviations: 3s = third person singular</small>\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''''<u>Pi</u>'''''\n|'''''<u>pi-krian</u>'''''\n|'''i'''\n|'''er'''\n|'''a'''\n|'''gula''''\n|'''sin.'''\n|-\n|<u>1pi</u>\n|<u>1pi.work</u>\n|PROX\n|make\n|3s\n|finish\n|first\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |'We first finish our work here.'\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |<small>Abbreviations: 1pi = first person plural inclusive, PROX = proximal</small>\n|}\nIn '''non-possessed NP's,''' the noun comes first, followed by the modifying element, such as an adjective.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''''Xaf'''''\n|'''''uwaad'''''\n|-\n|fish\n|big\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |'A big fish.'\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''''Uy'''''\n|'''''a'''''\n|-\n|person\n|PROX\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |'This person.'\n|}\n\n====Noun classes====\nThe Teiwa nouns can be divided into two main classes: '''Proper nouns''' and '''common nouns'''.\n\n===== Proper nouns =====\nProper nouns are not modifiable. Examples are listed below.<ref name=\"Klamer 2010\" />\n\n<u>Male names</u>: '''''Edi, Goli, Lius, Mase, Nabas, Ribu'''''\n\n<u>Female names</u>: '''''Bruang, Leti, Malai, Mani, Sam'''''\n\n<u>Family names</u>: '''''Biri, Blegar, Bui, Lau, Qoli, Ribu, Unu'''''\n\n<u>Clan names</u>: '''''Barawasi, Burilak, Loxoq, Perang Tubi, Qailipi'''''\n\n===== Common nouns =====\nThe '''common nouns''' can be further divided into subclasses:\n\n====== Nouns with [[Alienable possession|alienable]] possession ======\nIn this subclass the <u>possessor prefix is optional</u>. [[Focus (linguistics)|Focus]] can be placed with use of a long pronoun. Examples include: ''yaf'' 'house', ''kon'' 'shirt', ''qavif'' 'goat'.\n\n====== Nouns with [[Inalienable possession|inalienable]] possession ======\nHere the <u>possessor prefix is obligatory</u>, to the point that native speakers will not recognize the word without the prefix. Nouns with inalienable possession include body parts, and kinship terms (except for ''emaq'' 'wife' where the prefix is optional as with alienable possession).\n\n====== Locational nouns ======\nThis last subclass of nouns denote location. Examples include: '''''wanan''''' 'side', '''''fan''''' 'front', '''''siban''''' 'behind', '''''ragan''''' 'outside', '''''tag''''' 'up(stairs); above speaker (relatively close)'.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!''Uy''\n!''ragan''\n!''me'''\n|-\n|people \n|outside\n|be.in\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |'Some people are outside' / 'Someone is outside'\n|}\n\n====[[Nominalization]]====\nThere is no dedicated morphology for nominalization in Teiwa. Instead the third person (3p) possessor prefix ''-ga'' has a secondary function of attaching to the root form of adjectives, locational nouns, adverbs, and question words.<ref name=\"Klamer 2010\" />\n\n===Verbs===\nTeiwa verbs carry no marking for [[Case (linguistics)|case]] or [[Gender (linguistics)|gender]]. There is only one verbal [[Suffix (linguistics)|suffix]];\n\n'''-''(a)n''''' for the marking of [[Realis mood|realis]] status. Only verbs take an object [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]. Inflected prefixes index person and number traits of animate objects on the verb. Subjects and inanimate objects are <u>not</u> indexed on the verb.\n\nTeiwa has [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]] and [[transitive verb]]s. The transitive verbs are monotransitive, meaning they have a single grammatical object.\n\n====Verb classes====\n\n=====Transitive verbs=====\nThe transitive verbs in Teiwa can be divided into numerous sub classes, based on how they encode [[Animacy|animate and inanimate objects]] differently. In this case, animate or inanimate refers explicitly to a third person referent, since first and second person referents are inherently animate.\n\n;Class (i): Verbs with an object [[prefix]], with an animate object (\"sb-somebody\")\nThis class expresses the object with an object-marking prefix on the verb. The [[prefix]] marks for person and number. The lexical NP is optional and may be used to clarify or disambiguate the referent.\n\nExamples of verbs are: '''''an''''' \u2018give sb\u2019, '''''\u2018an''''' \u2018sell to sb\u2019, '''''ayas''''' \u2018throw at sb\u2019, '''''bun''''' \u2018answer sb\u2019, '''''fin''''' \u2018catch sb\u2019, '''''liin''''' \u2018invite sb\u2019, '''''regan''''' \u2018ask sb\u2019, '''''sas''''' \u2018feed sb\u2019, '''''walas''''' \u2018tell sb\u2019, '''''wei''''' \u2018bathe sb\u2019\n\nExamples of such verbs in sentence constructions:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!''A''\n!''qavif''\n!''<u>ga</u>-uyan''\n!''gi''\n!''si...''\n|-\n|3s\n|<u>goat</u>\n|3s.search\n|go\n|SIM\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |'He went searching for [a] goat...'\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |<small>Abbreviations: 3s = third person singular, SIM = simultaneous marker</small>\n|}\nThe prefix '''ga-''' on the verb '''''-uyan''''' marks for third person singular object, that is for '''''qavif''''',  'goat'. Goat is an <u>animate object</u>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!''A''\n!''yivar''\n!''<u>ga</u>-walas''\n!''a''\n!''wa...''\n|-\n|3s\n|<u>dog</u>\n|3s.tell\n|3s\n|say\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |'He told [his] dog...'\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |<small>Abbreviations: 3s = third person singular</small>\n|}\nHere similarly, the prefix '''ga-''' on the verb '''''-walas''''' marks for third person singular object, that is for '''''yivar''''',  'dog'. Dog is an <u>animate object</u>.\n\n;Class (ii): Verbs without an object prefix, with inanimate object (\"sth-something\")\nHere the verb encodes the object as a separate nominal constituent. In this class the encoding with a prefix is disallowed.\n\nExamples of such verbs are: '''''bali''''' \u2018see sth\u2019, '''''ol''''' \u2018buy sth\u2019, '''''paai''''' \u2018cut sth in many small pieces\u2019, '''''put''''' \u2018cut off (grass)\u2019\nAn example in a sentence construction:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!''...i'in''\n!''<u>i-xaf</u>''\n!''<u>uwaad</u>''\n!''la''\n!''boqai''\n!''dau-an''\n!''na.''\n|-\n|they.elsewhere\n|<u>3p.fish</u>\n|<u>big</u>\n|FOC\n|cut.up\n|cook-REAL\n|eat\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |'...they cut up their big fish, cooked and ate [it]'\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |<small>Abbreviations: 3p = third person plural, FOC = focus, REAL = realis</small>\n|}\nThe verbs in this sentence have no object prefix, and the object 'fish' is inanimate (because it is no longer living).\n\n;Class (iii): Transitive verbs that take either animate or inanimate objects\niiia. Transitive verbs with <u>prefixed animate object</u> OR f<u>ree (unfixed) inanimate object</u>\n\nWith free inanimate object (object prefix not bound to verb).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!''Na''\n!''<u>ga'an</u>''\n!''mar.''\n|-\n|1s\n|3s\n|take\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |'I take/get it.'\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |<small>Abbreviations: 3s = third person singular</small>\n|}\n<big>With prefixed animate object</big>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!''Na''\n!''<u>ga-</u>mar.''\n|-\n|1s\n|3s-take\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |'I follow him/her.'\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |<small>Abbreviations: 1s = first person singular, 3s = third person singular</small>\n|}\nNotice the important difference in meaning with the use a prefixed pronoun versus a free pronoun!\n\niiib.

This means that the children of same-sex siblings are considered to be siblings (brother, sister), and therefore not fit for marriage with one another. Children of non-same sex siblings of the parents are seen as cross-cousins and are the perfect candidates for marriage with each other. These children are also in a different clan than the children of the same-sex siblings of the parents.\n\n=== Kinship terms ===\nThe main kinship terms are listed here:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''''emaq'''''\n|wife\n|-\n|'''''misi'''''\n|husband\n|-\n|'''''bif'''''\n|child, 'younger sibling'\n|-\n|'''''biar (kriman)'''''\n|children\n|-\n|'''''na-gas qai'''''\n|my sister\n|-\n|'''''n-ian qai'''''\n|my brother\n|-\n|'''''n-ian'''''\n|(female) cousin of ego, in other clan\n|-\n|'''''na-dias'''''\n|(male) cousin of ego, in other clan\n|-\n|'''''na-rat (emaq)'''''\n|daughter of ego's brother, in other clan (potential daughter-in-law)\n|-\n|'''''na'ii''''' \n|son of ego's brother, in other clan (potential son-in-law)\n|-\n|'''''na-rata''''''\n|my grandfather/mother\n|-\n|'''''na-rat qai'''''\n|my grandchild\n|}\nFrom the point of view of female ego:\n\nThe \"classificatory siblings\" refer to the actual siblings, as well as the children of the <u>mother's sister</u> and the <u>father's brother</u>. As it is considered rude to call family members by their given name, these siblings are addressed as '''''matu'''''' when older and '''''bif''''' when younger, and '''''ka'au''''' when the same sex as the speaker.\n\nThe \"classificatory parents\" are the <u>father's brother</u> ('''''n-oma''''' 'my father'), as well as the <u>mother's sister</u> ('''''na-xala''''' 'my mother').

This is usually due to lack of compliance with postal regulations, an incomplete address and [[return address]], or the inability to [[mail forwarding|forward the mail]] when both correspondents move before the letter can be delivered. Largely based on the British model that emerged in the late eighteenth century, many countries developed similar systems for processing undeliverable mail.\n\nThe term 'dead mail' is perhaps a misnomer, and several jurisdictions have opted for the use of the term 'undeliverable mail' as more clearly representing the status of the item whose transmission has been impeded. As it is performed by internal departments within postal administrations, little information about the dead letter office function has ever been made public. A few journal articles and at least one recently published book (Canadian) dealing with this topic have appeared.<ref>{{cite book |last=Plain |first=Brian C. |title=The dead letter office in Canada, 1830-2002: an illustrated postal history |edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=British North America Philatelic Society |location=Surrey, BC   |isbn=0-919854-88-5 |oclc= 84985892|pages=148}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Allison  | first = Sue  | title = No Return Address | url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/no-return-address-29982057/ | journal = Smithsonian  | volume = 31  | issue = 4  | date = July 2000  | accessdate = 2017-02-17 }}</ref>\n\nClassification as a dead letter is one of the few instances where postal personnel are allowed to violate [[secrecy of correspondence]], ostensibly to search for clues as to the letter's origin or destination. Countries must also set up regulations for the disposal of dead letters, particularly when they contain items of value.  Some very valuable items have turned up in undeliverable mail, including a stolen painting by [[Marc Chagall]] which turned up in a [[United States Postal Service]] sorting center in [[Topeka, Kansas]] in January, 2002.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Real Chagall |work=USPS Memo to Mailers |publisher=[[USPS]] |date=March 2002 |url=http://www.usps.com/memotomailers/march2002.htm |accessdate=2009-10-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606083631/http://www.usps.com/memotomailers/march2002.htm |archivedate=2002-06-06 }}</ref>\n\nWith increased collection and study of the [[postal marking]]s originating from such offices, the body of literature on this obscure topic may grow.  Many countries, including [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], have issued special labels for envelopes that have travelled through the dead letter office.  Genuinely used examples are highly prized by collectors, although mint labels, because they have no postage value, are often fairly common.\n\nPeople interested in [[Mail|postal service]]s throughout the world sometimes deliberately send mail to fictional addresses throughout the world to see if a particular nation's postal authority would return the mail to the sender. Collectors of postal markings also use this method in order to receive uncommon postal markings seldom seen in everyday mail.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Dead letter office==\n{{about|the postal facility|the album by R.E.M.|Dead Letter Office (album)|the film|Dead Letter Office (film)|section=TRUE}}\n[[File:Dead letter office.png|right|thumb|Dead letter office, probably in [[Washington, D.C.]]; September 1922]]\n\nA '''dead letter office''' ('''DLO''') is a facility within a [[mail|postal system]] where [[Dead letter mail|undeliverable mail]] is processed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Patrick|first1=Douglas & Mary|title=The Musson Stamp Dictionary|date=1973|publisher=Musson Book Company|location=[[Toronto]]|isbn=0773700064|page=[https://archive.org/details/mussonstampdicti00doug/page/64 64]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mussonstampdicti00doug/page/64}}</ref> Mail is considered to be undeliverable when the address is invalid so it cannot be delivered to the addressee, and there is no [[return address]] so it cannot be returned to the sender.\n\nAt a DLO, mail is usually opened to try to find an address to forward to.

This is usually due to lack of compliance with postal regulations, an incomplete address and [[return address]], or the inability to [[mail forwarding|forward the mail]] when both correspondents move before the letter can be delivered. Largely based on the British model that emerged in the late eighteenth century, many countries developed similar systems for processing undeliverable mail.\n\nThe term 'dead mail' is perhaps a misnomer, and several jurisdictions have opted for the use of the term 'undeliverable mail' as more clearly representing the status of the item whose transmission has been impeded. As it is performed by internal departments within postal administrations, little information about the dead letter office function has ever been made public. A few journal articles and at least one recently published book (Canadian) dealing with this topic have appeared.<ref>{{cite book |last=Plain |first=Brian C. |title=The dead letter office in Canada, 1830-2002: an illustrated postal history |edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=British North America Philatelic Society |location=Surrey, BC   |isbn=0-919854-88-5 |oclc= 84985892|pages=148}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Allison  | first = Sue  | title = No Return Address | url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/no-return-address-29982057/ | journal = Smithsonian  | volume = 31  | issue = 4  | date = July 2000  | accessdate = 2017-02-17 }}</ref>\n\nClassification as a dead letter is one of the few instances where postal personnel are allowed to violate [[secrecy of correspondence]], ostensibly to search for clues as to the letter's origin or destination. Countries must also set up regulations for the disposal of dead letters, particularly when they contain items of value.  Some very valuable items have turned up in undeliverable mail, including a stolen painting by [[Marc Chagall]] which turned up in a [[United States Postal Service]] sorting center in [[Topeka, Kansas]] in January, 2002.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Real Chagall |work=USPS Memo to Mailers |publisher=[[USPS]] |date=March 2002 |url=http://www.usps.com/memotomailers/march2002.htm |accessdate=2009-10-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606083631/http://www.usps.com/memotomailers/march2002.htm |archivedate=2002-06-06 }}</ref>\n\nWith increased collection and study of the [[postal marking]]s originating from such offices, the body of literature on this obscure topic may grow.  Many countries, including [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], have issued special labels for envelopes that have travelled through the dead letter office.  Genuinely used examples are highly prized by collectors, although mint labels, because they have no postage value, are often fairly common.\n\nPeople interested in [[Mail|postal service]]s throughout the world sometimes deliberately send mail to fictional addresses throughout the world to see if a particular nation's postal authority would return the mail to the sender. Collectors of postal markings also use this method in order to receive uncommon postal markings seldom seen in everyday mail.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Dead letter office==\n{{about|the postal facility|the album by R.E.M.|Dead Letter Office (album)|the film|Dead Letter Office (film)|section=TRUE}}\n[[File:Dead letter office.png|right|thumb|Dead letter office, probably in [[Washington, D.C.]]; September 1922]]\n\nA '''dead letter office''' ('''DLO''') is a facility within a [[mail|postal system]] where [[Dead letter mail|undeliverable mail]] is processed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Patrick|first1=Douglas & Mary|title=The Musson Stamp Dictionary|date=1973|publisher=Musson Book Company|location=[[Toronto]]|isbn=0773700064|page=[https://archive.org/details/mussonstampdicti00doug/page/64 64]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mussonstampdicti00doug/page/64}}</ref> Mail is considered to be undeliverable when the address is invalid so it cannot be delivered to the addressee, and there is no [[return address]] so it cannot be returned to the sender.\n\nAt a DLO, mail is usually opened to try to find an address to forward to.
