It is the largest party represented in the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] and coexists ''[[de jure]]'' with two other legal parties making up the [[Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland]]. However, these minor parties are completely subservient to the WPK,{{sfn|Cha|Hwang|2009|p=214}} and must accept the WPK's \"[[vanguard party|leading role]]\" as a condition of their existence.\n\nWPK was founded in 1949 with the merger of the [[Workers' Party of North Korea]] and the [[Workers' Party of South Korea]]. The WPK also controls the [[Korean People's Army]]. WPK (and all of the other parties in the DPRK) remains illegal in [[South Korea]] under South Korea's own [[National Security Act (South Korea)|National Security Act]] and is sanctioned by [[Australia]], the [[European Union]], the [[United Nations]] and the [[United States]].<ref>[https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/16/executive-order-blocking-property-government-north-korea-and-workers Executive Order -- Blocking Property of the Government of North Korea and the Workers' Party of Korea, and Prohibiting Certain Transactions with Respect to North Korea]</ref>\n\nThe WPK is organized according to the [[Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System|Monolithic Ideological System]] and the [[Great Leader (concept)|Great Leader]], a system and theory conceived by [[Kim Yong-ju]] and [[Kim Jong-il]]. The highest body of the WPK is formally the Congress, but in practice a Congress occurs infrequently. Between 1980 and 2016, there were no congresses held. Although the WPK is organizationally similar to [[Communist party|communist parties]], in practice it is far less institutionalized and informal politics plays a larger role than usual. Institutions such as the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central Committee]], the [[Executive Policy Bureau of the Workers' Party of Korea|Executive Policy Bureau]], the [[Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central Military Commission]] (CMC), the [[Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Politburo]] and the Politburo's [[Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Presidium]] have much less power than that formally bestowed on them by [[Charter of the Workers' Party of Korea|the party's charter]], which is little more than a nominal document. [[Kim Jong-un]] is the current WPK leader, serving as [[Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea|Chairman]] and CMC chairman.\n\nThe WPK is committed to ''[[Juche]]'', an ideology which has been described as a combination of [[collectivism]] and [[Korean nationalism|nationalism]]; and at the 4th Conference (held in 2012), the party charter was amended to state that [[Kimilsungism\u2013Kimjongilism]] was \"the only guiding idea of the party\". At the 3rd Conference (held in 2010), the WPK removed a sentence from the preamble which expressed the party's commitment \"to building a [[pure communism|communist society]]\", replacing it with a new adherence to ''[[Songun]]'', the [[Militarism|\"military-first\" policies]] developed by Kim Jong-il. The 2009 revision had already removed all references to communism. Party ideology has recently focused on perceived [[Imperialism|imperialist]] enemies of the party and state; and on legitimizing the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]]'s dominance of the political system. Before the rise of ''Juche'' and later ''Songun'', the party was committed to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist thought]] as well, with its importance becoming greatly diminished over time.\n\nThe party's emblem is an adaptation of the communist [[hammer and sickle]], with a traditional [[Korean calligraphy]] brush. The symbols represent the industrial workers (hammer), peasants (sickle) and intelligentsia (ink brush).\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Workers' Party of Korea}}\n{{Infobox Korean name\n|title      = '''Workers' Party of Korea'''\n|image      = Workers' Party of Korea.svg\n|caption    = \"Workers' Party of Korea\" in [[Hancha]] (top) and [[Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl]] (bottom) scripts\n|context    = north\n|hangul     = {{linktext|\uc870\uc120|\ub85c\ub3d9|\ub2f9}}, {{linktext|\ubd81\ud55c|\ub178\ub3d9|\ub2f9}}\n|hanja      = {{linktext|lang=ko-Hant|\u671d\u9bae|\u52de\u52d5|\u9ee8}}, {{linktext|lang=ko-Hant|\u5317\u97d3|\u52de\u52d5|\u9ee8}}\n|mr         = Chos\u014fn Rodongdang, Bukhan Nodongdang\n|rr         = Joseon Rodongdang, Pukhan Nodongdang\n|tablewidth = 288\n|fontcolor  = #FFFF00\n|color      = {{Workers' Party of Korea/meta/color}}\n}}\n\n===Founding and early years (1945\u20131953)===\nOn 13 October 1945, the {{ill|North Korean Bureau of the Communist Party of Korea|ko|\ubd81\uc870\uc120\uacf5\uc0b0\ub2f9}} (NKB\u2013CPK) was established,{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=20}} with [[Kim Yong-bom]] its first chairman.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=21}} However, the NKB\u2013CPK remained subordinate to the [[Communist Party of Korea|CPK]] Central Committee (headquartered in Seoul and headed by [[Pak Hon-yong]]).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=22}} Two months later, at the 3rd Plenum of the NKB, Kim Yong-bom was replaced by [[Kim Il-sung]] (an event probably orchestrated by the Soviet Union).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=21\u201322}} In spring 1946 the North Korean Bureau became the [[Communist Party of North Korea]], with Kim Il-sung its elected chairman.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=28\u201329}} On 22 July 1946 Soviet authorities in North Korea established the [[Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland|United Democratic National Front]], a [[popular front]] led by the Communist Party of North Korea.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=29}} The Communist Party of North Korea soon merged with the [[New People's Party of Korea]], a party primarily composed of communists from China.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=29}} On 28 July 1946 a special commission of the two parties ratified the merger, and it became official the following day.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=31}} One month later (28\u201330 August 1946) the party held its [[1st Congress of the Workers' Party of North Korea|founding congress]], establishing the [[Workers' Party of North Korea]] (WPNK).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=31}} The congress elected former leader of the New People's Party of Korea [[Kim Tu-bong]] as the first WPNK chairman, with Kim Il-sung its appointed deputy chairman.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=31}} However, despite his formal downgrade in the party's hierarchy Kim Il-sung remained its leader.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n[[File:Kim Il-sung and Pak Hon-yong, Baik Namun in Pyungyang.jpg|thumb|[[Kim Il-sung]] (left) with [[Pak Hon-yong]] in [[Pyongyang]], 1948]]\nParty control increased throughout the country after the congress.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=33\u201340}} From 27\u201330 March 1948, the WPNK convened its [[2nd Congress of the Workers' Party of North Korea|2nd Congress]].{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=40}} While Kim Tu-bong was still the party's formal head, Kim Il-sung presented the main report to the congress.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=42}} In it he claimed that North Korea was \"a base of democracy\", in contrast to South Korea (which was, he believed, dictatorial).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=42}} On 28 April 1948 a special session of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] approved the constitution (proposed and written by WPNK cadres), which led to the official establishment of an independent North Korea.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=44}} It did not call for the establishment of an independent North Korea, but for a unified (communist) Korea; the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) would be Seoul, not Pyongyang.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=45}} Kim Il-sung was the appointed head of government of the new state, with Kim Tu-bong heading the legislative branch.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=47}} A year later on 30 June 1949, the Workers' Party of Korea was created with the merger of the WPNK and the [[Workers' Party of South Korea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/event/nkorea_nuclear/general_03c.htm|title=KBS WORLD Radio|work=kbs.co.kr}}</ref>\n\nKim Il-sung was not the most ardent supporter of a military reunification of Korea; that role was played by the South Korean communists, headed by Pak Hon-yong.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=60}} After several meetings with [[Joseph Stalin]] (the [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|leader of the Soviet Union]]), North Korea invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950\u2014and thus began the [[Korean War]].{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=61}} With American intervention in the war the DPRK nearly collapsed, but it was saved by Chinese intervention in the conflict.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=61}} The war had the effect of weakening Soviet influence over Kim Il-sung and the WPK.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=62}} Around this time, the main fault lines in early WPK politics were created. Four factions formed: domestic (a group of WPK cadres who had remained in Korea during Japanese rule), Soviet Koreans (Koreans sent from the Soviet Union), Yanan (Koreans from China) and guerrillas (Kim Il-sung's personal faction).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=62}} However, Kim would be unable to further strengthen his position until the end of the war.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=62}}\n\n===Kim Il-sung's consolidation of power (1953\u20131980)===\n[[File:Mosaic Depicting Kim Il Sungs Homecoming, Pyongyang, North Korea (2907648510).jpg|thumb|left|Propaganda mosaic commemorating the triumphant homecoming of Kim Il-sung after he liberated Korea from Japan]]\nRelations worsened between the WPK and the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) when Stalin's successor, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], began pursuing a policy of [[de-Stalinization]].{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} During the [[Sino\u2013Soviet conflict]], an ideological conflict between the CPSU and the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), Kim Il-sung maneuvered between the two socialist superpowers; by doing so, he weakened their influence on the WPK.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} By 1962 Kim Il-sung and the WPK favored the CPC over the CPSU in the ideological struggle, and \"for a few years North Korea almost unconditionally supported the Chinese position on all important issues.\"{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} The primary conflict between the WPK and the CPSU during this period was that Kim Il-sung did not support the denunciation of [[Stalinism]] (including Stalin's [[cult of personality]]), the creation of a [[collective leadership]] and the theory of [[peaceful coexistence]] between the capitalist and socialist worlds.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} Kim Il-sung believed peaceful coexistence synonymous with capitulation, and knew that de-Stalinization in North Korea would effectively end his unlimited power over the WPK.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} The result of the souring of relations between the CPSU and the WPK was that the Soviet Union discontinued aid to North Korea.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}} As a result, several industries were on the brink of disaster; China was unwilling to increase aid to North Korea.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}} [[Mao Zedong]] began the [[Cultural Revolution]] shortly thereafter, an event criticized by the WPK as \"left-wing opportunism\" and a manifestation of the \"[[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] theory of a [[permanent revolution]].\"{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}} Relations towards the CPSU and the CPC stabilized during the 1960s, with the WPK making it clear it would remain neutral in the Sino\u2013Soviet conflict,{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}} thus resulting in the 1966 launch of the ''Juche'' program aimed at national self-determination at all levels. This, in turn, strengthened Kim Il-Sung's position in the WPK.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}}\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, Kim Il-sung's cult of personality reached new heights.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=70}} It had been no greater than Stalin's or Mao's until 1972, when [[Day of the Sun|his birthday]] on April 15 became the country's main [[Public holidays in North Korea|public holiday]] and statues of him began to be built nationwide.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=70}} Kim became known as \"Great Leader\", the \"Sun of the Nation\", \"The Iron All-Victorious General\" and \"Marshal of the All-Mighty Republic\" in WPK and state publications; official propaganda stated that \"burning loyalty to the leader\" was one of the main characteristics of any Korean.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=70}}\n\nKim Il-sung and his guerilla faction had purged the WPK of its opposing factions during the 1950s and the 1960s, to the dismay of both the CPC and the CPSU.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=62}} The domestic faction was the first to go (in 1953\u201355), followed by the Yan'an faction in 1957\u201358 and the Soviet Koreans (along with anyone else deemed unfaithful to the WPK leadership) in the 1957\u201362 purge.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=62\u201363}} According to historian [[Andrei Lankov]], \"Kim Il-sung had become not only supreme, but also the omnipotent ruler of North Korea\u2014no longer merely 'first amongst equals', as had been the case in the late 1940s\".{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=63}} After purging his WPK opposition, Kim Il-sung consolidated his power base with [[nepotism]] and hereditary succession in the Kim family and the guerilla faction.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=72}} Beginning in the late 1980s, \"a high (and increasing) proportion of North Korean high officials have been sons of high officials.\"{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=72}} Since the 1960s, Kim Il-sung had appointed family members to positions of power.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=73}} By the early 1990s, a number of leading national offices were held by people in his family: [[Kang Song-san]] ([[Premier of North Korea|Premier]] of the [[Government of North Korea|Administrative Council]] and member of the WPK Secretariat), [[Pak Song-chol]] ([[Vice President of North Korea|Vice President]]), [[Hwang Jang-yop]] and [[Kim Chung-rin]] (members of the WPK Secretariat), [[Kim Yong-sun]] (Head of the [[International Department of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK International Department]] and member of the WPK Secretariat), [[Kang Hui-won]] (Secretary of the [[Pyongyang Municipal Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK Pyongyang Municipal Committee]] and Deputy Premier of the Administrative Council), [[Kim Tal-hyon]] ([[Ministry of Foreign Trade (North Korea)|Minister of Foreign Trade]]), [[Kim Chan-ju]] ([[Ministry of Agriculture (North Korea)|Minister of Agriculture]] and Deputy Chairman of the Administrative Council) and [[Yang Hyong-sop]] (President of the [[Academy of Social Sciences (North Korea)|Academy of Social Sciences]] and chairman of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]]).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=73}} These individuals were appointed solely because of their ties to the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]], and presumably retain their positions as long as the Kim family controls the WPK and the country.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=73}} The reason for Kim's support of nepotism (his own and that of the guerrilla faction) can be explained by the fact that he did not want the [[nomenklatura|party bureaucracy]] to threaten his\u2014and his son's\u2014rule as it did in other socialist states.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=73}}\n\nIt was first generally believed by foreign observers that Kim Il-sung was planning for his brother, [[Kim Yong-ju]], to succeed him.{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=442}} Kim Yong-ju's authority gradually increased, until he became co-chairman of the North\u2013South Coordination Committee.{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=442}} From late 1972 to the [[6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea|6th WPK Congress]], Kim Yong-ju became an increasingly remote figure in the regime. At the 6th Congress he lost his Politburo and Central Committee seats,{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=442}} and rumors that Kim Il-sung had begun grooming Kim Jong-il in 1966 were confirmed.{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=442}} From 1974 to the 6th Congress, Kim Jong-il (called the \"Party centre\" by North Korean media) was the second most powerful man in North Korea.{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=442}} His selection was criticized, with his father accused of creating a dynasty or turning North Korea into a [[Feudalism|feudal state]].{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=434}}\n\n===Kim Jong-il's apprenticeship and rule (1980\u20132011)===\n[[File:Kim Jong il Portrait-2.jpg|thumb|Although [[Kim Jong-il]] headed the WPK with no pretense of following the party charter, it was revitalized at the 3rd Conference at the end of his rule]]\nWith Kim Jong-il's official appointment as [[heir apparent]] at the 6th Congress, power became more centralized in the Kim family.{{sfn|Buzo|1999|p=105}} WPK officials began to speak openly about his succession, and beginning in 1981 he began to participate in (and lead) tours.{{sfn|Buzo|1999|p=105}} In 1982 he was made a [[Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] and wrote ''[[On the Juche Idea]]''.{{sfn|Buzo|1999|p=105}} While foreign observers believed that Kim Jong-il's appointment would increase participation by the younger generation, in ''On the Juche Idea'' he made it clear that his leadership would not mark the beginning of a new generation of leaders.{{sfn|Buzo|1999|pp=105\u2013106}} The WPK could not address the crisis facing Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il's leadership at home and abroad, in part because of the [[gerontocracy]] at the highest level of the WPK and the state.{{sfn|Buzo|1999|p=106}}\n\nWith the death of [[O Jin-u]] on 25 February 1995, Kim Jong-il became the sole remaining living member of the Presidium (the highest body of the WPK when the Politburo and the Central Committee are not in session).{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=7}} While no member list of the [[Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK Central Military Commission]] (CMC, the highest party organ on military affairs) was published from 1993 to 2010, there were clear signs of movement in the military hierarchy during 1995.{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=8}} For the WPK's 50th anniversary, Kim Jong-il initiated a reshuffling of the CMC (and the military leadership in general) to appease the old guard and younger officials.{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=8}} He did not reshuffle the WPK Central Committee or the government, however, and during the 1990s the changes to its membership were caused mostly by its members [[Death by natural causes|dying of natural causes]].{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=11}}\n\nBeginning in 1995, Kim Jong-il favored the military over the WPK and the state.{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=11}} Problems began to mount as an [[economic crisis]], coupled with a [[North Korean famine|famine]] in which at least half a million people died, weakened his control of the country.{{sfn|Gause|2011|pp=11\u201313}} Instead of recommending structural reforms Kim began to criticize the WPK's lack of control over the economy, lambasting its local and provincial branches for their inability to implement central-level instructions.{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=13}} At a speech celebrating the 50th anniversary of [[Kim Il-sung University]], he said: \"The reason why people are loyal to the instructions of the Central Committee is not because of party organizations and workers, but because of my authority.\"{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=13}} Kim Jong-il said that his father had told him to avoid economics, claiming that it was better left to experts. After this speech, the WPK's responsibility to control the economy was given to the Administrative Council (the central government).{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=13}} By late 1996 Kim Jong-il concluded that

Although the WPK claims to be [[socialist patriotism|socialist-patriotic]],{{sfn|Suh|1988|p=309}} some analysts claim its socialist patriotism would be more similar to [[bourgeois nationalism]]; the chief difference is that socialist patriotism is nationalism in a [[socialist state]].{{sfn|Suh|1988|pp=309\u2013310}} ''Juche'' developed as a reaction to foreign occupation, involvement and influence (primarily by the Chinese and Soviets) in North Korean affairs, and may be described \"as a normal and healthy reaction of the Korean people to the deprivation they suffered under foreign domination.\"{{sfn|Suh|1988|p=310}} However, there is nothing uniquely Marxist or Leninist in this reaction; the primary reason for its description as \"communist\" is that it occurred in a self-proclaimed socialist state.{{sfn|Suh|1988|p=310}} The WPK (and the North Korean leadership in general) have not explained in detail how their policies are Marxist, Leninist or communist; ''Juche'' is defined as \"Korean\", and the others as \"foreign\".{{sfn|Suh|1988|pp=310\u2013313}}\n\n====Basic tenets====\n{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|bgcolor=ivory|quote=You requested me to give a detailed explanation of the Juche idea.

he believed it would threaten the country's ability to develop socialism, which only a state with a strong, independent economy could do.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} ''Charip'' emphasizes an independent national economy based on [[heavy industry]]; this sector, in theory, would then drive the rest of the economy.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} Kim Jong-il said:{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}}\n<blockquote>Building an independent national economy means building an economy which is free from dependence on others and which stands on its own feet, an economy which serves one\u2019s own people and develops on the strength of the resources of one\u2019s own country and by the efforts of one\u2019s people.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}}</blockquote>\n\nKim Il-sung considered military independence (''chawi'') crucial.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}} Acknowledging that North Korea might need military support in a war against [[imperialism|imperialist enemies]], he emphasized a domestic response and summed up the party's (and state's) attitude towards military confrontation: \"We do not want war, nor are we afraid of it, nor do we beg peace from the imperialists.\"{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}}\n\nAccording to ''Juche'', because of his [[consciousness]] man has ultimate control over himself and the ability to change the world.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=109}} This differs from classical Marxism, which believes that humans depend on their [[relations of production|relationship]] to the [[means of production]] more than on themselves.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=111}} The ''Juche'' view of a revolution led by a Great Leader, rather than a group of knowledgeable revolutionaries, is a break from [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] concept of a [[vanguard party]].{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=111}}\n\n===Nationalism===\n[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] did not clarify the difference between state and law, focusing on class divisions within nations.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=139}} They argued that nation and law (as it existed then) would be overthrown and replaced by [[proletariat|proletarian rule]].{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=139}} This was the mainstream view of Soviet theoreticians during the 1920s; however, with Stalin at the helm in 1929 it was under attack.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} He criticized [[Nikolai Bukharin]]'s position that the proletariat was hostile to the [[Marx's theory of the state|inclinations of the state]], arguing that since the state (the Soviet Union) was in transition from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]] the relationship between the state and the proletariat was harmonious.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} By 1936, Stalin argued that the state would still exist if the Soviet Union reached the [[pure communism|communist mode of production]] if the socialist world was encircled by capitalist forces.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} Kim Il-sung took this position to its logical conclusion, arguing that the state would exist after North Korea reached the communist mode of production until a future [[world revolution]].{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} As long as capitalism survived, even if the socialist world predominated, North Korea could still be threatened by the restoration of capitalism.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}}\n\nThe revival of the term \"state\" in the Soviet Union under Stalin led to the revival of \"nation\" in North Korea under Kim Il-sung.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} Despite official assertions that the Soviet Union was based on \"class\" rather than \"state\", the latter was revived during the 1930s.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} In 1955 Kim Il-sung expressed a similar view in his speech, \"On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing Juche in Ideological Work\":{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} <blockquote>What we are doing now is not a revolution in some foreign country but our Korean revolution. Therefore, every ideological action must benefit the Korean revolution. To fulfill the Korean revolution, one should be perfectly cognizant of the history of our national struggle, of Korea's geography, and our customs.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}}</blockquote>\nFrom then on, he and the WPK stressed the roles of \"revolutionary tradition\" and Korea's cultural tradition in its revolution.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} At party meetings, members and cadres learned about North Korea's national prestige and its coming rejuvenation.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} Traditional customs were revived, to showcase Korean-ness.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} By 1965, Kim Il-sung claimed that if communists continued opposing [[Individualism|individuality]] and [[sovereign state|sovereignty]], the movement would be threatened by [[dogmatism]] and [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]].{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}} He criticized those communists who, he believed, subscribed to \"national [[nihilism]] by praising all things foreign and vilifying all things national\" and tried to impose foreign models on their own country.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}} By the 1960s, ''Juche'' was a full-fledged ideology calling for a distinct path for North Korean socialist construction and non-interference in its affairs; however, a decade later it was defined as a system whose \"fundamental principle was the realization of sovereignty\".{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}}\n\nAlthough WPK theoreticians were initially hostile towards the terms \"nation\" and \"nationalism\" because of the influence of the Stalinist definition of \"state\", by the 1970s their definition was changed from [[Marxism and the National Question|\"a stable, historically formed community of people based on common language, territory, economic life, and culture\"]] to include \"shared bloodline\".{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}} During the 1980s a common economic life was removed from the definition, with shared bloodline receiving increased emphasis.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}} With a democratic transition in South Korea and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the WPK revised the meaning of nationalism.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}} Previously defined in Stalinist terms as a bourgeois weapon to exploit the workers, nationalism changed from a [[reactionary]] to a [[progressivism|progressive]] idea.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}} Kim Il-sung differentiated \"nationalism\" from what he called \"genuine nationalism\"; while genuine nationalism was a progressive idea, nationalism remained reactionary:{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}}\n<blockquote>True nationalism (genuine nationalism) is similar to [[patriotism]]. Only a genuine patriot can become a devoted and true [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]]. In this sense, when I say communist, at the same time, I mean nationalist and internationalist.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}}</blockquote>\n\n====Allegations of xenophobia====\nDuring the 1960s the WPK began forcing ethnic Koreans to divorce their European spouses (who were primarily from the [[Eastern Bloc]]), with a high-ranking WPK official calling the marriages \"a crime against the Korean race\" and [[Eastern Bloc]] embassies in the country beginning to accuse the regime of [[fascism]].{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}} In May 1963, a Soviet diplomat described Kim Il-sung's political circle as a \"political [[Gestapo]]\".{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}} Similar remarks were made by other Eastern Bloc officials in North Korea, with the East German ambassador calling the policy \"Goebbelsian\" (a reference to [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|minister of propaganda]]).{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}} Although this was said during a [[nadir]] in relations between North Korea and the Eastern Bloc, it illustrated a perception of racism in Kim Il-sung's policies.{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}}\n\nIn his book ''[[The Cleanest Race]]'' (2010), [[Brian Reynolds Myers]] dismisses the idea that ''Juche'' is North Korea's leading ideology.

It is the largest party represented in the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] and coexists ''[[de jure]]'' with two other legal parties making up the [[Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland]]. However, these minor parties are completely subservient to the WPK,{{sfn|Cha|Hwang|2009|p=214}} and must accept the WPK's \"[[vanguard party|leading role]]\" as a condition of their existence.\n\nWPK was founded in 1949 with the merger of the [[Workers' Party of North Korea]] and the [[Workers' Party of South Korea]]. The WPK also controls the [[Korean People's Army]]. WPK (and all of the other parties in the DPRK) remains illegal in [[South Korea]] under South Korea's own [[National Security Act (South Korea)|National Security Act]] and is sanctioned by [[Australia]], the [[European Union]], the [[United Nations]] and the [[United States]].<ref>[https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/16/executive-order-blocking-property-government-north-korea-and-workers Executive Order -- Blocking Property of the Government of North Korea and the Workers' Party of Korea, and Prohibiting Certain Transactions with Respect to North Korea]</ref>\n\nThe WPK is organized according to the [[Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System|Monolithic Ideological System]] and the [[Great Leader (concept)|Great Leader]], a system and theory conceived by [[Kim Yong-ju]] and [[Kim Jong-il]]. The highest body of the WPK is formally the Congress, but in practice a Congress occurs infrequently. Between 1980 and 2016, there were no congresses held. Although the WPK is organizationally similar to [[Communist party|communist parties]], in practice it is far less institutionalized and informal politics plays a larger role than usual. Institutions such as the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central Committee]], the [[Executive Policy Bureau of the Workers' Party of Korea|Executive Policy Bureau]], the [[Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central Military Commission]] (CMC), the [[Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Politburo]] and the Politburo's [[Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Presidium]] have much less power than that formally bestowed on them by [[Charter of the Workers' Party of Korea|the party's charter]], which is little more than a nominal document. [[Kim Jong-un]] is the current WPK leader, serving as [[Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea|Chairman]] and CMC chairman.\n\nThe WPK is committed to ''[[Juche]]'', an ideology which has been described as a combination of [[collectivism]] and [[Korean nationalism|nationalism]]; and at the 4th Conference (held in 2012), the party charter was amended to state that [[Kimilsungism\u2013Kimjongilism]] was \"the only guiding idea of the party\". At the 3rd Conference (held in 2010), the WPK removed a sentence from the preamble which expressed the party's commitment \"to building a [[pure communism|communist society]]\", replacing it with a new adherence to ''[[Songun]]'', the [[Militarism|\"military-first\" policies]] developed by Kim Jong-il. The 2009 revision had already removed all references to communism. Party ideology has recently focused on perceived [[Imperialism|imperialist]] enemies of the party and state; and on legitimizing the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]]'s dominance of the political system. Before the rise of ''Juche'' and later ''Songun'', the party was committed to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist thought]] as well, with its importance becoming greatly diminished over time.\n\nThe party's emblem is an adaptation of the communist [[hammer and sickle]], with a traditional [[Korean calligraphy]] brush.

All the policies and lines of our Party emanate from the Juche idea and they embody this idea.|source=\u2014Kim Il-sung, when asked by a Japanese interviewer to define ''[[Juche]]''{{sfn|Oh|Hassig|2000|p=18}}}}\n''Juche''{{'}}s primary objective for North Korea is political, economic and military independence.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=105}} Kim Il-sung, in his \"Let Us Defend the Revolutionary Spirit of Independence, Self-Reliance, and Self-defense More Thoroughly in All Fields of State Activities\" speech to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] in 1967, summarized ''Juche'':{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=105}} <blockquote>The government of the republic will implement with all consistency the line of independence, self-sustenance, and self-defense to consolidate the political independence of the country (''chaju''), build up more solidly the foundations of an independent national economy capable of insuring the complete unification, independence, and prosperity of our nation (''charip'') and increasing the country's defense capabilities, so as to safeguard the security of the fatherland reliably by our own force (''chawi''), by splendidly embodying our Party's idea of Juche in all fields.\"{{sfn|Lee|2003|pp=105\u2013106}}</blockquote>\n\nThe principle of political independence known as ''chaju'' is one of ''Juche''{{'}}s central tenets.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} ''Juche'' stresses equality and mutual respect among nations, asserting that every state has the right of self-determination.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} In practice, the beliefs in self-determination and equal sovereignty have turned North Korea into a [[hermit kingdom]].{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} As interpreted by the WPK, yielding to foreign pressure or intervention would violate ''chaju'' and threaten the country's ability to defend its sovereignty.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} This may explain why Kim Jong-il believed that the Korean revolution would fail if North Korea became dependent on a foreign entity.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} In relations with fellow socialist countries China and the Soviet Union Kim Il-sung urged cooperation, mutual support and dependence, acknowledging that it was important for North Korea to learn from other countries.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} Despite this, he abhorred the idea that North Korea could (or should) depend on the two nations and did not want to dogmatically follow their example.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} Kim Il-sung said that the WPK needed to \"resolutely repudiate the tendency to swallow things of others undigested or imitate them mechanically\", attributing the success of North Korea on the WPK's independence in implementing policies.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} To ensure North Korean independence, official pronouncements stressed the need for the people to unite under the WPK and the Great Leader.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}}\n\nEconomic independence (''charip'') is seen as the material basis of ''chaju''.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} One of Kim Il-sung's greatest fears involved North Korean dependence on foreign aid; he believed it would threaten the country's ability to develop socialism, which only a state with a strong, independent economy could do.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} ''Charip'' emphasizes an independent national economy based on [[heavy industry]]; this sector, in theory, would then drive the rest of the economy.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} Kim Jong-il said:{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}}\n<blockquote>Building an independent national economy means building an economy which is free from dependence on others and which stands on its own feet, an economy which serves one\u2019s own people and develops on the strength of the resources of one\u2019s own country and by the efforts of one\u2019s people.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}}</blockquote>\n\nKim Il-sung considered military independence (''chawi'') crucial.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}} Acknowledging that North Korea might need military support in a war against [[imperialism|imperialist enemies]], he emphasized a domestic response and summed up the party's (and state's) attitude towards military confrontation: \"We do not want war, nor are we afraid of it, nor do we beg peace from the imperialists.\"{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}}\n\nAccording to ''Juche'', because of his [[consciousness]] man has ultimate control over himself and the ability to change the world.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=109}} This differs from classical Marxism, which believes that humans depend on their [[relations of production|relationship]] to the [[means of production]] more than on themselves.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=111}} The ''Juche'' view of a revolution led by a Great Leader, rather than a group of knowledgeable revolutionaries, is a break from [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] concept of a [[vanguard party]].{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=111}}\n\n===Nationalism===\n[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] did not clarify the difference between state and law, focusing on class divisions within nations.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=139}} They argued that nation and law (as it existed then) would be overthrown and replaced by [[proletariat|proletarian rule]].{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=139}} This was the mainstream view of Soviet theoreticians during the 1920s; however, with Stalin at the helm in 1929 it was under attack.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} He criticized [[Nikolai Bukharin]]'s position that the proletariat was hostile to the [[Marx's theory of the state|inclinations of the state]], arguing that since the state (the Soviet Union) was in transition from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]] the relationship between the state and the proletariat was harmonious.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} By 1936, Stalin argued that the state would still exist if the Soviet Union reached the [[pure communism|communist mode of production]] if the socialist world was encircled by capitalist forces.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} Kim Il-sung took this position to its logical conclusion, arguing that the state would exist after North Korea reached the communist mode of production until a future [[world revolution]].{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} As long as capitalism survived, even if the socialist world predominated, North Korea could still be threatened by the restoration of capitalism.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}}\n\nThe revival of the term \"state\" in the Soviet Union under Stalin led to the revival of \"nation\" in North Korea under Kim Il-sung.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} Despite official assertions that the Soviet Union was based on \"class\" rather than \"state\", the latter was revived during the 1930s.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} In 1955 Kim Il-sung expressed a similar view in his speech, \"On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing Juche in Ideological Work\":{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} <blockquote>What we are doing now is not a revolution in some foreign country but our Korean revolution. Therefore, every ideological action must benefit the Korean revolution. To fulfill the Korean revolution, one should be perfectly cognizant of the history of our national struggle, of Korea's geography, and our customs.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}}</blockquote>\nFrom then on, he and the WPK stressed the roles of \"revolutionary tradition\" and Korea's cultural tradition in its revolution.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} At party meetings, members and cadres learned about North Korea's national prestige and its coming rejuvenation.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} Traditional customs were revived, to showcase Korean-ness.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} By 1965, Kim Il-sung claimed that if communists continued opposing [[Individualism|individuality]] and [[sovereign state|sovereignty]], the movement would be threatened by [[dogmatism]] and [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]].{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}} He criticized those communists who, he believed, subscribed to \"national [[nihilism]] by praising all things foreign and vilifying all things national\" and tried to impose foreign models on their own country.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}} By the 1960s, ''Juche'' was a full-fledged ideology calling for a distinct path for North Korean socialist construction and non-interference in its affairs; however, a decade later it was defined as a system whose \"fundamental principle was the realization of sovereignty\".{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}}\n\nAlthough WPK theoreticians were initially hostile towards the terms \"nation\" and \"nationalism\" because of the influence of the Stalinist definition of \"state\", by the 1970s their definition was changed from [[Marxism and the National Question|\"a stable, historically formed community of people based on common language, territory, economic life, and culture\"]] to include \"shared bloodline\".{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}} During the 1980s a common economic life was removed from the definition, with shared bloodline receiving increased emphasis.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}} With a democratic transition in South Korea and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the WPK revised the meaning of nationalism.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}} Previously defined in Stalinist terms as a bourgeois weapon to exploit the workers, nationalism changed from a [[reactionary]] to a [[progressivism|progressive]] idea.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}} Kim Il-sung differentiated \"nationalism\" from what he called \"genuine nationalism\"; while genuine nationalism was a progressive idea, nationalism remained reactionary:{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}}\n<blockquote>True nationalism (genuine nationalism) is similar to [[patriotism]]. Only a genuine patriot can become a devoted and true [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]]. In this sense, when I say communist, at the same time, I mean nationalist and internationalist.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}}</blockquote>\n\n====Allegations of xenophobia====\nDuring the 1960s the WPK began forcing ethnic Koreans to divorce their European spouses (who were primarily from the [[Eastern Bloc]]), with a high-ranking WPK official calling the marriages \"a crime against the Korean race\" and [[Eastern Bloc]] embassies in the country beginning to accuse the regime of [[fascism]].{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}} In May 1963, a Soviet diplomat described Kim Il-sung's political circle as a \"political [[Gestapo]]\".{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}} Similar remarks were made by other Eastern Bloc officials in North Korea, with the East German ambassador calling the policy \"Goebbelsian\" (a reference to [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|minister of propaganda]]).{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}} Although this was said during a [[nadir]] in relations between North Korea and the Eastern Bloc, it illustrated a perception of racism in Kim Il-sung's policies.{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}}\n\nIn his book ''[[The Cleanest Race]]'' (2010), [[Brian Reynolds Myers]] dismisses the idea that ''Juche'' is North Korea's leading ideology. He views its public exaltation as designed to deceive foreigners; it exists to be praised rather than followed.<ref name=\"Rank\">{{cite news |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/LD10Dg02.html |title=Lifting the cloak on North Korean secrecy: ''The Cleanest Race, How North Koreans See Themselves'' by B R Myers |first=Michael |last=Rank |date=10 April 2012 |accessdate=13 December 2012 |publisher=Asia Times}}</ref> Myers writes that ''Juche'' is a sham ideology, developed to extol Kim Il-sung as a political thinker comparable to [[Mao Zedong]].<ref name=\"3quarksdaily\">{{cite web |url=http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2010/04/immersion-in-propaganda-racebased-nationalism-and-the-unfigureoutable-vortex-of-juche-thought-colin-.html |title=Immersion in propaganda, race-based nationalism and the un-figure-outable vortex of Juche Thought: Colin Marshall talks to B.R.

{"title_page": "Orthogonal coordinates", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], '''orthogonal coordinates''' are defined as a set of ''d'' coordinates '''q''' = (''q''<sup>1</sup>, ''q''<sup>2</sup>, ..., ''q''<sup>''d''</sup>) in which the [[Coordinate system#Coordinate surface|coordinate surfaces]] all meet at right angles (note: superscripts are [[Einstein notation|indices]], not exponents).  A coordinate surface for a particular coordinate ''q''<sup>''k''</sup> is the curve, surface, or hypersurface on which ''q''<sup>''k''</sup> is a constant.  For example, the three-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') is an orthogonal coordinate system, since its coordinate surfaces ''x'' = constant, ''y'' = constant, and ''z'' = constant are planes that meet at right angles to one another, i.e., are perpendicular. Orthogonal coordinates are a special but extremely common case of [[curvilinear coordinates]].\n\n==Motivation==\n\n[[Image:Conformal map.svg|right|thumb|A [[conformal map]] acting on a rectangular grid. Note that the orthogonality of the curved grid is retained.]]\n\nWhile vector operations and physical laws are normally easiest to derive in [[Cartesian coordinates]], non-Cartesian orthogonal coordinates are often used instead for the solution of various problems, especially [[boundary value problem]]s, such as those arising in field theories of [[quantum mechanics]], [[fluid flow]], [[electrodynamics]], [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] physics and the [[diffusion]] of [[chemical species]] or [[heat]].\n\nThe chief advantage of non-Cartesian coordinates is that they can be chosen to match the symmetry of the problem. For example, the pressure wave due to an explosion far from the ground (or other barriers) depends on 3D space in Cartesian coordinates, however the pressure predominantly moves away from the center, so that in [[spherical coordinates]] the problem becomes very nearly one-dimensional (since the pressure wave dominantly depends only on time and the distance from the center). Another example is (slow) fluid in a straight circular pipe: in Cartesian coordinates, one has to solve a (difficult) two dimensional boundary value problem involving a partial differential equation, but in [[cylindrical coordinates]] the problem becomes one-dimensional with an [[ordinary differential equation]] instead of a [[partial differential equation]].\n\nThe reason to prefer orthogonal coordinates instead of general [[curvilinear coordinates]] is simplicity: many complications arise when coordinates are not orthogonal. For example, in orthogonal coordinates many problems may be solved by [[separation of variables]].  Separation of variables is a mathematical technique that converts a complex ''d''-dimensional problem into ''d'' one-dimensional problems that can be solved in terms of known functions.  Many equations can be reduced to [[Laplace's equation]] or the [[Helmholtz equation]].  [[Laplace's equation]] is separable in 13 orthogonal coordinate systems (the 14 listed [[Orthogonal coordinates#Table of orthogonal coordinates|in the table below]] with the exception of [[Toroidal coordinates|toroidal]]), and the [[Helmholtz equation]] is separable in 11 orthogonal coordinate systems.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrthogonalCoordinateSystem.html\n| title = Orthogonal Coordinate System\n| author = [[Eric W. Weisstein]]\n| publisher = [[MathWorld]]\n| accessdate = 10 July 2008\n}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Morse and Feshbach|1953|loc=Volume 1, pp. 494-523, 655-666.}}</ref>\n\nOrthogonal coordinates never have off-diagonal terms in their [[metric tensor]].  In other words, the infinitesimal squared distance ''ds''<sup>2</sup> can always be written as a scaled sum of the squared infinitesimal coordinate displacements\n\n:<math>\nds^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^d \\left( h_k \\, dq^{k} \\right)^2\n</math>\n\nwhere ''d'' is the dimension and the scaling functions (or scale factors)\n\n:<math>\nh_{k}(\\mathbf{q})\\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ \\sqrt{g_{kk}(\\mathbf{q})} = |\\mathbf e_k|\n</math>\n\nequal the square roots of the diagonal components of the metric tensor, or the lengths of the local basis vectors <math>\\mathbf e_k</math> described below.  These scaling functions ''h''<sub>''i''</sub> are used to calculate differential operators in the new coordinates, e.g., the [[gradient]], the [[Vector Laplacian|Laplacian]], the [[divergence]] and the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]].\n\nA simple method for generating orthogonal coordinates systems in two dimensions is by a [[conformal mapping]] of a standard two-dimensional grid of [[Cartesian coordinates]] {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}}.  A [[complex number]] ''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy'' can be formed from the real coordinates ''x'' and ''y'', where ''i'' represents the [[imaginary unit]].  Any [[holomorphic function]] ''w'' = ''f''(''z'') with non-zero complex derivative will produce a [[conformal mapping]]; if the resulting complex number is written {{nowrap|1=''w'' = ''u'' + ''iv''}}, then the curves of constant ''u'' and ''v'' intersect at right angles, just as the original lines of constant ''x'' and ''y'' did.\n\nOrthogonal coordinates in three and higher dimensions can be generated from an orthogonal two-dimensional coordinate system, either by projecting it into a new dimension (''cylindrical coordinates'') or by rotating the two-dimensional system about one of its symmetry axes.  However, there are other orthogonal coordinate systems in three dimensions that cannot be obtained by projecting or rotating a two-dimensional system, such as the [[ellipsoidal coordinates]]. More general orthogonal coordinates may be obtained by starting with some necessary coordinate surfaces and considering their [[orthogonal trajectories]].\n\n==Basis vectors==\n\n===Covariant basis===\n\nIn [[Cartesian coordinates]], the [[basis vectors]] are fixed (constant). In the more general setting of [[curvilinear coordinates]], a point in space is specified by the coordinates, and at every such point there is bound a set of basis vectors, which generally are not constant: this is the essence of curvilinear coordinates in general and is a very important concept. What distinguishes orthogonal coordinates is that, though the basis vectors vary, they are always [[orthogonal]] with respect to each other. In other words,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf e_i \\cdot \\mathbf e_j = 0 \\quad \\text{if} \\quad i \\neq j</math>\n\nThese basis vectors are by definition the [[Differential geometry of curves#Tangent vector|tangent vector]]s of the curves obtained by varying one coordinate, keeping the others fixed:\n\n[[Image:OrthogonalCoordinates.png|thumb|300px|Visualization of 2D orthogonal coordinates. Curves obtained by holding all but one coordinate constant are shown, along with basis vectors. Note that the basis vectors aren't of equal length: they need not be, they only need to be orthogonal.]]\n\n:<math>\\mathbf e_i = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf r}{\\partial q^i}</math>\n\nwhere '''r''' is some point and ''q''<sup>''i''</sup> is the coordinate for which the basis vector is extracted. In other words, a curve is obtained by fixing all but one coordinate; the unfixed coordinate is varied as in a [[parametric curve]], and the derivative of the curve with respect to the parameter (the varying coordinate) is the basis vector for that coordinate.\n\nNote that the vectors are not necessarily of equal length. The useful functions known as scale factors of the coordinates are simply the lengths <math>h_i</math> of the basis vectors <math>\\hat{\\mathbf e}_i</math> (see table below). The scale factors are sometimes called Lam\u00e9 coefficients, but this terminology is best avoided since some more well known coefficients in [[linear elasticity]] carry the same name.\n\nThe [[unit vector|normalized]] basis vectors are notated with a hat and obtained by dividing by the length:\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\mathbf e}_i = \\frac{{\\mathbf e}_i}{h_i} = \\frac{{\\mathbf e}_i}{\\left|{\\mathbf e}_i\\right|}</math>\n\nA [[vector field]] may be specified by its components with respect to the basis vectors or the normalized basis vectors, and one must be sure which case is meant. Components in the normalized basis are most common in applications for clarity of the quantities (for example, one may want to deal with tangential velocity instead of tangential velocity times a scale factor); in derivations the normalized basis is less common since it is more complicated.\n\n===Contravariant basis===\nThe basis vectors shown above are [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] basis vectors (because they \"co-vary\" with vectors). In the case of orthogonal coordinates, the contravariant basis vectors are easy to find since they will be in the same direction as the covariant vectors but [[reciprocal length]] (for this reason, the two sets of basis vectors are said to be reciprocal with respect to each other):\n\n:<math>\\mathbf e^i = \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf e}_i}{h_i} = \\frac{\\mathbf e_i}{h_i^2}</math>\n\nthis follows from the fact that, by definition, <math> \\mathbf e_i \\cdot \\mathbf e^j = \\delta^j_i</math>, using the [[Kronecker delta]]. Note that:\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\mathbf e}_i = \\frac{\\mathbf e_i}{h_i} = h_i \\mathbf e^i = \\hat{\\mathbf e}^i</math>\n\nWe now face three different basis sets commonly used to describe vectors in orthogonal coordinates: the covariant basis '''e'''<sub>''i''</sub>, the contravariant basis '''e'''<sup>''i''</sup>, and the normalized basis '''\u00ea'''<sup>''i''</sup>. While a vector is an ''objective quantity'', meaning its identity is independent of any coordinate system, the components of a vector depend on what basis the vector is represented in.\n\nTo avoid confusion, the components of the vector '''x''' with respect to the '''e'''<sub>''i''</sub> basis are represented as '''x'''<sup>''i''</sup>, while the components with respect to the '''e'''<sup>''i''</sup> basis are represented as '''x'''<sub>''i''</sub>:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf x = \\sum_i x^i \\mathbf e_i = \\sum_i x_i \\mathbf e^i</math>\n\nThe position of the indices represent how the components are calculated (upper indices should not be confused with [[exponentiation]]). Note that the [[summation]] symbols \u03a3 (capital [[Sigma (letter)|Sigma]]) and the summation range, indicating summation over all basis vectors (''i'' = 1, 2, ..., ''d''), are often [[Einstein notation|omitted]]. The components are related simply by:\n\n:<math>h_i^2 x^i = x_i</math>\n\nThere is no distinguishing widespread notation in use for vector components with respect to the normalized basis; in this article we'll use subscripts for vector components and note that the components are calculated in the normalized basis.\n\n==Vector algebra==\nVector addition and negation are done component-wise just as in Cartesian coordinates with no complication. Extra considerations may be necessary for other vector operations.\n\nNote however, that all of these operations assume that two vectors in a [[vector field]] are bound to the same point (in other words, the tails of vectors coincide). Since basis vectors generally vary in orthogonal coordinates, if two vectors are added whose components are calculated at different points in space, the different basis vectors require consideration.\n\n===Dot product===\nThe [[dot product]] in [[Cartesian coordinates]] ([[Euclidean space]] with an [[orthonormal]] basis set) is simply the sum of the products of components. In orthogonal coordinates, the dot product of two vectors '''x''' and '''y''' takes this familiar form when the components of the vectors are calculated in the normalized basis:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf x \\cdot \\mathbf y = \\sum_i x_i \\hat{\\mathbf e}_i \\cdot \\sum_j y_j \\hat{\\mathbf e}_j = \\sum_i x_i y_i</math>\n\nThis is an immediate consequence of the fact that the normalized basis at some point can form a Cartesian coordinate system: the basis set is [[orthonormal]].\n\nFor components in the covariant or contravariant bases,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf x \\cdot \\mathbf y = \\sum_i h_i^2 x^i y^i = \\sum_i \\frac{x_i y_i}{h_i^2} = \\sum_i x^i y_i = \\sum_i x_i y^i</math>\n\nThis can be readily derived by writing out the vectors in component form, normalizing the basis vectors, and taking the dot product. For example, in 2D:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf x \\cdot \\mathbf y & =\n\\left(x^1 \\mathbf e_1 + x^2 \\mathbf e_2\\right) \\cdot \\left(y_1 \\mathbf e^1 + y_2 \\mathbf e^2\\right) \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\left(x^1 h_1 \\hat{ \\mathbf e}_1 + x^2 h_2 \\hat{ \\mathbf e}_2\\right) \\cdot \\left(y_1 \\frac{\\hat{ \\mathbf e}^1}{h_1} + y_2 \\frac{\\hat{ \\mathbf e}^2}{h_2}\\right) = x^1 y_1 + x ^2 y_2\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere the fact that the normalized covariant and contravariant bases are equal has been used.\n\n===Cross product===\nThe [[cross product]] in 3D Cartesian coordinates is:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf x \\times \\mathbf y =\n(x_2 y_3 - x_3 y_2) \\hat{ \\mathbf e}_1 + (x_3 y_1 - x_1 y_3) \\hat{ \\mathbf e}_2 + (x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1) \\hat{ \\mathbf e}_3</math>\n\nThe above formula then remains valid in orthogonal coordinates if the components are calculated in the normalized basis.\n\nTo construct the cross product in orthogonal coordinates with covariant or contravariant bases we again must simply normalize the basis vectors, for example:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf x \\times \\mathbf y = \\sum_i x^i \\mathbf e_i \\times \\sum_j y^j \\mathbf e_j =\n\\sum_i x^i h_i \\hat{\\mathbf e}_i \\times \\sum_j y^j h_j \\hat{\\mathbf e}_j</math>\n\nwhich, written expanded out,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf x \\times \\mathbf y =\n(x^2 y^3 - x^3 y^2) \\frac{h_2 h_3}{h_1} \\mathbf e_1 + (x^3 y^1 - x^1 y^3) \\frac{h_1 h_3}{h_2} \\mathbf e_2 + (x^1 y^2 - x^2 y^1) \\frac{h_1 h_2}{h_3} \\mathbf e_3</math>\n\nTerse notation for the cross product, which simplifies generalization to non-orthogonal coordinates and higher dimensions, is possible with the [[Levi-Civita tensor]], which will have components other than zeros and ones if the scale factors are not all equal to one.\n\n==Vector calculus==\n\n===Differentiation===\n\nLooking at an infinitesimal displacement from some point, it's apparent that\n\n:<math>d\\mathbf r = \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf r}{\\partial q^i} \\, dq^i = \\sum_i \\mathbf e_i \\, dq^i</math>\n\nBy [[Gradient#Gradient and the derivative or differential|definition]], the gradient of a function must satisfy (this definition remains true if ''\u0192'' is any [[tensor]])\n\n:<math>df = \\nabla f \\cdot d\\mathbf r \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad df = \\nabla f \\cdot \\sum_i \\mathbf e_i \\, dq^i</math>\n\nIt follows then that [[del operator]] must be:\n\n:<math>\\nabla = \\sum_i \\mathbf e^i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^i}</math>\n\nand this happens to remain true in general curvilinear coordinates. Quantities like the [[gradient]] and [[Laplacian]] follow through proper application of this operator.\n\n===Basis vector formulae===\n\nFrom d'''r''' and normalized basis vectors '''\u00ea'''<sub>''i''</sub>, the following can be constructed.<ref>Mathematical Handbook of Formulas and Tables (3rd edition), S.

A coordinate surface for a particular coordinate ''q''<sup>''k''</sup> is the curve, surface, or hypersurface on which ''q''<sup>''k''</sup> is a constant.  For example, the three-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') is an orthogonal coordinate system, since its coordinate surfaces ''x'' = constant, ''y'' = constant, and ''z'' = constant are planes that meet at right angles to one another, i.e., are perpendicular. Orthogonal coordinates are a special but extremely common case of [[curvilinear coordinates]].\n\n==Motivation==\n\n[[Image:Conformal map.svg|right|thumb|A [[conformal map]] acting on a rectangular grid. Note that the orthogonality of the curved grid is retained.]]\n\nWhile vector operations and physical laws are normally easiest to derive in [[Cartesian coordinates]], non-Cartesian orthogonal coordinates are often used instead for the solution of various problems, especially [[boundary value problem]]s, such as those arising in field theories of [[quantum mechanics]], [[fluid flow]], [[electrodynamics]], [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] physics and the [[diffusion]] of [[chemical species]] or [[heat]].\n\nThe chief advantage of non-Cartesian coordinates is that they can be chosen to match the symmetry of the problem. For example, the pressure wave due to an explosion far from the ground (or other barriers) depends on 3D space in Cartesian coordinates, however the pressure predominantly moves away from the center, so that in [[spherical coordinates]] the problem becomes very nearly one-dimensional (since the pressure wave dominantly depends only on time and the distance from the center). Another example is (slow) fluid in a straight circular pipe: in Cartesian coordinates, one has to solve a (difficult) two dimensional boundary value problem involving a partial differential equation, but in [[cylindrical coordinates]] the problem becomes one-dimensional with an [[ordinary differential equation]] instead of a [[partial differential equation]].\n\nThe reason to prefer orthogonal coordinates instead of general [[curvilinear coordinates]] is simplicity: many complications arise when coordinates are not orthogonal. For example, in orthogonal coordinates many problems may be solved by [[separation of variables]].  Separation of variables is a mathematical technique that converts a complex ''d''-dimensional problem into ''d'' one-dimensional problems that can be solved in terms of known functions.  Many equations can be reduced to [[Laplace's equation]] or the [[Helmholtz equation]].  [[Laplace's equation]] is separable in 13 orthogonal coordinate systems (the 14 listed [[Orthogonal_coordinates#Table_of_orthogonal_coordinates|in the table below]] with the exception of [[Toroidal_coordinates|toroidal]]), and the [[Helmholtz equation]] is separable in 11 orthogonal coordinate systems.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrthogonalCoordinateSystem.html\n| title = Orthogonal Coordinate System\n| author = [[Eric W.

In other words, the infinitesimal squared distance ''ds''<sup>2</sup> can always be written as a scaled sum of the squared infinitesimal coordinate displacements\n\n:<math>\nds^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^d \\left( h_k \\, dq^{k} \\right)^2\n</math>\n\nwhere ''d'' is the dimension and the scaling functions (or scale factors)\n\n:<math>\nh_{k}(\\mathbf{q})\\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ \\sqrt{g_{kk}(\\mathbf{q})} = |\\mathbf e_k|\n</math>\n\nequal the square roots of the diagonal components of the metric tensor, or the lengths of the local basis vectors <math>\\mathbf e_k</math> described below.  These scaling functions ''h''<sub>''i''</sub> are used to calculate differential operators in the new coordinates, e.g., the [[gradient]], the [[Vector Laplacian|Laplacian]], the [[divergence]] and the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]].\n\nA simple method for generating orthogonal coordinates systems in two dimensions is by a [[conformal mapping]] of a standard two-dimensional grid of [[Cartesian coordinates]] {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}}.  A [[complex number]] ''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy'' can be formed from the real coordinates ''x'' and ''y'', where ''i'' represents the [[imaginary unit]].  Any [[holomorphic function]] ''w'' = ''f''(''z'') with non-zero complex derivative will produce a [[conformal mapping]]; if the resulting complex number is written {{nowrap|1=''w'' = ''u'' + ''iv''}}, then the curves of constant ''u'' and ''v'' intersect at right angles, just as the original lines of constant ''x'' and ''y'' did.\n\nOrthogonal coordinates in three and higher dimensions can be generated from an orthogonal two-dimensional coordinate system, either by projecting it into a new dimension (''cylindrical coordinates'') or by rotating the two-dimensional system about one of its symmetry axes.  However, there are other orthogonal coordinate systems in three dimensions that cannot be obtained by projecting or rotating a two-dimensional system, such as the [[ellipsoidal coordinates]]. More general orthogonal coordinates may be obtained by starting with some necessary coordinate surfaces and considering their [[orthogonal trajectories]].\n\n==Basis vectors==\n\n===Covariant basis===\n\nIn [[Cartesian coordinates]], the [[basis vectors]] are fixed (constant). In the more general setting of [[curvilinear coordinates]], a point in space is specified by the coordinates, and at every such point there is bound a set of basis vectors, which generally are not constant: this is the essence of curvilinear coordinates in general and is a very important concept. What distinguishes orthogonal coordinates is that, though the basis vectors vary, they are always [[orthogonal]] with respect to each other. In other words,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf e_i \\cdot \\mathbf e_j = 0 \\quad \\text{if} \\quad i \\neq j</math>\n\nThese basis vectors are by definition the [[Differential geometry of curves#Tangent vector|tangent vector]]s of the curves obtained by varying one coordinate, keeping the others fixed:\n\n[[Image:OrthogonalCoordinates.png|thumb|300px|Visualization of 2D orthogonal coordinates. Curves obtained by holding all but one coordinate constant are shown, along with basis vectors. Note that the basis vectors aren't of equal length: they need not be, they only need to be orthogonal.]]\n\n:<math>\\mathbf e_i = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf r}{\\partial q^i}</math>\n\nwhere '''r''' is some point and ''q''<sup>''i''</sup> is the coordinate for which the basis vector is extracted. In other words, a curve is obtained by fixing all but one coordinate; the unfixed coordinate is varied as in a [[parametric curve]], and the derivative of the curve with respect to the parameter (the varying coordinate) is the basis vector for that coordinate.\n\nNote that the vectors are not necessarily of equal length. The useful functions known as scale factors of the coordinates are simply the lengths <math>h_i</math> of the basis vectors <math>\\hat{\\mathbf e}_i</math> (see table below). The scale factors are sometimes called Lam\u00e9 coefficients, but this terminology is best avoided since some more well known coefficients in [[linear elasticity]] carry the same name.\n\nThe [[unit vector|normalized]] basis vectors are notated with a hat and obtained by dividing by the length:\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\mathbf e}_i = \\frac{{\\mathbf e}_i}{h_i} = \\frac{{\\mathbf e}_i}{\\left|{\\mathbf e}_i\\right|}</math>\n\nA [[vector field]] may be specified by its components with respect to the basis vectors or the normalized basis vectors, and one must be sure which case is meant. Components in the normalized basis are most common in applications for clarity of the quantities (for example, one may want to deal with tangential velocity instead of tangential velocity times a scale factor); in derivations the normalized basis is less common since it is more complicated.\n\n===Contravariant basis===\nThe basis vectors shown above are [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] basis vectors (because they \"co-vary\" with vectors). In the case of orthogonal coordinates, the contravariant basis vectors are easy to find since they will be in the same direction as the covariant vectors but [[reciprocal length]] (for this reason, the two sets of basis vectors are said to be reciprocal with respect to each other):\n\n:<math>\\mathbf e^i = \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf e}_i}{h_i} = \\frac{\\mathbf e_i}{h_i^2}</math>\n\nthis follows from the fact that, by definition, <math> \\mathbf e_i \\cdot \\mathbf e^j = \\delta^j_i</math>, using the [[Kronecker delta]]. Note that:\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\mathbf e}_i = \\frac{\\mathbf e_i}{h_i} = h_i \\mathbf e^i = \\hat{\\mathbf e}^i</math>\n\nWe now face three different basis sets commonly used to describe vectors in orthogonal coordinates: the covariant basis '''e'''<sub>''i''</sub>, the contravariant basis '''e'''<sup>''i''</sup>, and the normalized basis '''\u00ea'''<sup>''i''</sup>. While a vector is an ''objective quantity'', meaning its identity is independent of any coordinate system, the components of a vector depend on what basis the vector is represented in.\n\nTo avoid confusion, the components of the vector '''x''' with respect to the '''e'''<sub>''i''</sub> basis are represented as '''x'''<sup>''i''</sup>, while the components with respect to the '''e'''<sup>''i''</sup> basis are represented as '''x'''<sub>''i''</sub>:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf x = \\sum_i x^i \\mathbf e_i = \\sum_i x_i \\mathbf e^i</math>\n\nThe position of the indices represent how the components are calculated (upper indices should not be confused with [[exponentiation]]). Note that the [[summation]] symbols \u03a3 (capital [[Sigma (letter)|Sigma]]) and the summation range, indicating summation over all basis vectors (''i'' = 1, 2, ..., ''d''), are often [[Einstein notation|omitted]]. The components are related simply by:\n\n:<math>h_i^2 x^i = x_i</math>\n\nThere is no distinguishing widespread notation in use for vector components with respect to the normalized basis; in this article we'll use subscripts for vector components and note that the components are calculated in the normalized basis.\n\n==Vector algebra==\nVector addition and negation are done component-wise just as in Cartesian coordinates with no complication. Extra considerations may be necessary for other vector operations.\n\nNote however, that all of these operations assume that two vectors in a [[vector field]] are bound to the same point (in other words, the tails of vectors coincide). Since basis vectors generally vary in orthogonal coordinates, if two vectors are added whose components are calculated at different points in space, the different basis vectors require consideration.\n\n===Dot product===\nThe [[dot product]] in [[Cartesian coordinates]] ([[Euclidean space]] with an [[orthonormal]] basis set) is simply the sum of the products of components. In orthogonal coordinates, the dot product of two vectors '''x''' and '''y''' takes this familiar form when the components of the vectors are calculated in the normalized basis:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf x \\cdot \\mathbf y = \\sum_i x_i \\hat{\\mathbf e}_i \\cdot \\sum_j y_j \\hat{\\mathbf e}_j = \\sum_i x_i y_i</math>\n\nThis is an immediate consequence of the fact that the normalized basis at some point can form a Cartesian coordinate system: the basis set is [[orthonormal]].\n\nFor components in the covariant or contravariant bases,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf x \\cdot \\mathbf y = \\sum_i h_i^2 x^i y^i = \\sum_i \\frac{x_i y_i}{h_i^2} = \\sum_i x^i y_i = \\sum_i x_i y^i</math>\n\nThis can be readily derived by writing out the vectors in component form, normalizing the basis vectors, and taking the dot product. For example, in 2D:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf x \\cdot \\mathbf y & =\n\\left(x^1 \\mathbf e_1 + x^2 \\mathbf e_2\\right) \\cdot \\left(y_1 \\mathbf e^1 + y_2 \\mathbf e^2\\right) \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\left(x^1 h_1 \\hat{ \\mathbf e}_1 + x^2 h_2 \\hat{ \\mathbf e}_2\\right) \\cdot \\left(y_1 \\frac{\\hat{ \\mathbf e}^1}{h_1} + y_2 \\frac{\\hat{ \\mathbf e}^2}{h_2}\\right) = x^1 y_1 + x ^2 y_2\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere the fact that the normalized covariant and contravariant bases are equal has been used.\n\n===Cross product===\nThe [[cross product]] in 3D Cartesian coordinates is:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf x \\times \\mathbf y =\n(x_2 y_3 - x_3 y_2) \\hat{ \\mathbf e}_1 + (x_3 y_1 - x_1 y_3) \\hat{ \\mathbf e}_2 + (x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1) \\hat{ \\mathbf e}_3</math>\n\nThe above formula then remains valid in orthogonal coordinates if the components are calculated in the normalized basis.\n\nTo construct the cross product in orthogonal coordinates with covariant or contravariant bases we again must simply normalize the basis vectors, for example:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf x \\times \\mathbf y = \\sum_i x^i \\mathbf e_i \\times \\sum_j y^j \\mathbf e_j =\n\\sum_i x^i h_i \\hat{\\mathbf e}_i \\times \\sum_j y^j h_j \\hat{\\mathbf e}_j</math>\n\nwhich, written expanded out,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf x \\times \\mathbf y =\n(x^2 y^3 - x^3 y^2) \\frac{h_2 h_3}{h_1} \\mathbf e_1 + (x^3 y^1 - x^1 y^3) \\frac{h_1 h_3}{h_2} \\mathbf e_2 + (x^1 y^2 - x^2 y^1) \\frac{h_1 h_2}{h_3} \\mathbf e_3</math>\n\nTerse notation for the cross product, which simplifies generalization to non-orthogonal coordinates and higher dimensions, is possible with the [[Levi-Civita tensor]], which will have components other than zeros and ones if the scale factors are not all equal to one.\n\n==Vector calculus==\n\n===Differentiation===\n\nLooking at an infinitesimal displacement from some point, it's apparent that\n\n:<math>d\\mathbf r = \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf r}{\\partial q^i} \\, dq^i = \\sum_i \\mathbf e_i \\, dq^i</math>\n\nBy [[Gradient#Gradient and the derivative or differential|definition]], the gradient of a function must satisfy (this definition remains true if ''\u0192'' is any [[tensor]])\n\n:<math>df = \\nabla f \\cdot d\\mathbf r \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad df = \\nabla f \\cdot \\sum_i \\mathbf e_i \\, dq^i</math>\n\nIt follows then that [[del operator]] must be:\n\n:<math>\\nabla = \\sum_i \\mathbf e^i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^i}</math>\n\nand this happens to remain true in general curvilinear coordinates. Quantities like the [[gradient]] and [[Laplacian]] follow through proper application of this operator.\n\n===Basis vector formulae===\n\nFrom d'''r''' and normalized basis vectors '''\u00ea'''<sub>''i''</sub>, the following can be constructed.<ref>Mathematical Handbook of Formulas and Tables (3rd edition), S.
