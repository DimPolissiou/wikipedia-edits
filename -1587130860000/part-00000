He played [[wide receiver]] for 14 seasons in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He holds the NFL single-season touchdown reception record (23 in 2007), the NFL single-season touchdown reception record for a rookie (17 in 1998), and is second on the NFL all-time regular season touchdown reception list with 156.  He currently works for [[ESPN]] as a studio analyst for their ''[[Sunday NFL Countdown]]'' and ''[[Monday Night Countdown]]'' programs.\n\nMoss played [[college football]] for [[Marshall University]], and twice earned [[All-America]] honors. He was drafted by the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in the first round of the [[1998 NFL Draft]], where he played for seven years before a trade in 2005 brought him to the [[Oakland Raiders]]. On April 29, 2007, Moss was traded to the [[New England Patriots]] for a fourth-round draft pick, where he set the single-season record for touchdown receptions. On October 6, 2010, Moss returned to the Vikings in a trade from the Patriots, but his second stint in Minnesota was short-lived, and was waived by the team less than a month later, being claimed by the [[Tennessee Titans]]. After sitting out the 2011 season, Moss signed a one-year contract with the [[San Francisco 49ers]] for the 2012 season then opted to retire prior to the 2013 season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2013/8/12/4614828/randy-moss-nfl-fox-analyst|title=Randy Moss is officially an NFL analyst for Fox Sports 1, as part of 'Fox Football Daily'|last=Lepore|first=Steve|date=August 12, 2013|work=[[SB Nation]]|access-date=November 26, 2016|via=}}</ref> He played in two [[Super Bowl]] games, [[Super Bowl XLII|XLII]] with the Patriots and [[Super Bowl XLVII|XLVII]] with the 49ers, both losses.\n\nOn February 3, 2018, he was selected to join the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in his first year of eligibility.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000913913/article/ray-lewis-terrell-owens-randy-moss-highlight-hof-class|title=Ray Lewis, Terrell Owens, Randy Moss lead HOF class|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nMoss was born in Charleston, West Virginia and moved to [[Rand, West Virginia]] at a young age.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bieler|first1=Des|title=What we learned from ESPN's \u201930 for 30\u2032 on Randy Moss|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2014/11/12/the-30-for-30-on-randy-moss-what-we-learned/|accessdate=March 27, 2016|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=McGarry|first1=Tim|title=Randy Moss remembers his roots with Rand University|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2012/09/16/randy-moss-and-rand-university/70000476/1|accessdate=March 27, 2016|newspaper=USA Today|date=September 17, 2012}}</ref> He attended DuPont High School, one of two schools that later consolidated into [[Riverside High School (West Virginia)|Riverside High School]], where he excelled in football, basketball, baseball, and track.

Culpepper had been the team's first round draft pick in 1999; with a pick they received from the Redskins for quarterback Brad Johnson. He had been selected largely due to his extremely strong arm, which the team believed was perfectly suited for Moss's deep routes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The decision proved correct. Culpepper was a rookie sensation, the Vikings started 7-0, and Moss was a leading MVP candidate. For the second time in three seasons, Moss punished the Dallas Cowboys in Dallas on Thanksgiving Day, including a spectacular 2nd half touchdown in which Moss caught the ball with his entire body out of bounds, aside from his toes. The play would be the feature shot in NFL commercials for years to come. Moss finished the season with a career-high 1,437 yards and league leading 15 touchdown catches. In doing so, he became the youngest and fastest player to ever catch over 3,000 yards and 45 touchdowns, earning him his 3rd consecutive trip to the Pro Bowl, and 2nd selection to the All Pro team.

He was scheduled to earn $3.5 million in 2001.

One of the strategies the Vikings first-year head coach came up with was a formula to get Moss the ball more often. Coach Tice called it the Randy Ratio. It was an effort on the coaches part to throw 40% of the passes to Moss as a way to keep him involved in the offense more than he had been in the 2001 season when he had stretches in games where he was being shut out, and partly to use more game clock by sustaining long drives to give the Vikings defense a chance to rest.<ref name=\"RandyRatio\">{{cite news | first=Dan | last=Pompei | title=If Ratio Rules, Teams Will Gather No Moss | date=August 26, 2002 | publisher=The Sporting News | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_34_226/ai_95676850/ | accessdate = November 21, 2009}}{{dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref> An assistant coach would stand on the sidelines during games and track how many times Moss had been thrown to, and then inform Tice of the percentages so that he is always aware of it. In the 2001 season, the Vikings record was 4\u20131 when Moss had 40% of the passes thrown his direction, and 1\u201310 in other games.<ref name=\"2002NFLpreview\"/>\n\nThe strategy was a response to the 'Randy Rules,' as Vikings receiver [[Chris Walsh (American football)|Chris Walsh]] called them. The Randy Rules, similar to the [[Jordan Rules]], were a defensive strategy that teams employed when facing the Vikings to try and eliminate or reduce Randy's impact on the game, and to prevent Moss from being matched up [[man-to-man defense|one-on-one]] with defenders because of his ability to burn them deep or outjump them in single coverage. Opposing teams would routinely double cover Moss with techniques such as having a [[cornerback]] attempt to [[Cornerback#Jamming the receiver|jam]] him at the line of scrimmage, having a corner defend underneath with a [[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|safety]] defending against the deep ball, having a [[zone defense]] roll to Moss' side of the field, and assigning \"spies\" to follow Moss everywhere he went.\n\nCoach Tice discussed the strategy, explaining that Moss would be running more short and intermediate routes and fewer deep patterns. In training camp, Moss worked specifically on 12 new routes that he had rarely run in his first 4 NFL seasons, such as crossing patterns over the middle of the field and hook routes.<ref name=\"RandyRatio\"/> Coach Tice said, \"When we say Randy Ratio, everybody in the league thinks, 'OK, now they're going to throw the ball down the field to Randy more and more and more.' That's so far from the truth. In fact, we'll probably throw the ball down the field to Randy this year even less.\"<ref name=\"RandyRatio\"/>\n\nThe Randy Ratio did not last very long, as Tice scrapped the idea midway through the 2002 season. Randy Moss said \"I didn't really care much about the Randy Ratio when it was brought up. I just wanted to win.\"<ref name=\"metamorphosis\">{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Moss' Metamorphosis | date=August 15, 2003 | publisher=SI.com | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2003/08/15/randy_ratio_ap/ | accessdate = November 21, 2009}}</ref> While Moss caught a career-high 106 passes, he also had a career low 7 touchdown receptions, and the Vikings struggled to a 6\u201310 record. Tice suggested after the season that it was a mistake to inform opponents about his offensive gameplan, but that it was a tool \"to motivate [Moss] and say he was the guy.\"<ref name=\"metamorphosis\"/>\n\n====2003 season====\nMoss' fortunes took a better turn on the football field during the [[2003 NFL season|2003]] regular season, where he became the second wide receiver in NFL history (behind Jerry Rice in 1995) to play more than 12 games (he played 16) while averaging over 100 yards and one touchdown per contest. He finished with 111 receptions for 1,632 yards and 17 touchdowns. All three numbers either tied or became a new personal best for Moss. Vikings finished 9-7 for the season. One of Moss's memorable highlights that year was when he lateraled to Moe Williams for a last second touchdown during a home game against Denver.\n\nIn the offseason, he attended the Vikings strength & conditioning program and added five pounds of muscle to his frame.<ref name=\"metamorphosis\"/>\n\n====2004 season====\nMoss started the season strong catching 8 touchdowns in his first 5 games of the season. However, he sustained a hamstring injury to his right leg against [[New Orleans Saints|New Orleans]] in Week 6 that hampered him for the next five weeks. He played in Week 7 against [[Tennessee Titans|Tennessee]], but had no receptions in a game for the first time in his career. He also played the following week against the Giants, but again recorded no receptions and was used mainly as a decoy. The injury eventually sidelined him for 3 straight weeks. He returned to the lineup in Week 12 with a touchdown catch against the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]].\n\nEven though he finished the season with 13 touchdowns in 13 games, he posted career lows in receptions (49) and receiving yards (767). 2004 was the first season in his career that he failed to reach the 1,000 yard mark.\n\nOn January 9, 2005, the Minnesota Vikings played division rival [[Green Bay Packers]] in an [[2004\u201305 NFL playoffs#NFC: Minnesota Vikings 31, Green Bay Packers 17|NFC wildcard playoff game]].

However, this was still not enough to enable the heavily favored Patriots to eclipse the only undefeated season with a Super Bowl win, held by the [[1972 Miami Dolphins]].

player who is a television [[sports analyst]]. He played [[wide receiver]] for 14 seasons in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He holds the NFL single-season touchdown reception record (23 in 2007), the NFL single-season touchdown reception record for a rookie (17 in 1998), and is second on the NFL all-time regular season touchdown reception list with 156.  He currently works for [[ESPN]] as a studio analyst for their ''[[Sunday NFL Countdown]]'' and ''[[Monday Night Countdown]]'' programs.\n\nMoss played [[college football]] for [[Marshall University]], and twice earned [[All-America]] honors. He was drafted by the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in the first round of the [[1998 NFL Draft]], where he played for seven years before a trade in 2005 brought him to the [[Oakland Raiders]]. On April 29, 2007, Moss was traded to the [[New England Patriots]] for a fourth-round draft pick, where he set the single-season record for touchdown receptions. On October 6, 2010, Moss returned to the Vikings in a trade from the Patriots, but his second stint in Minnesota was short-lived, and was waived by the team less than a month later, being claimed by the [[Tennessee Titans]]. After sitting out the 2011 season, Moss signed a one-year contract with the [[San Francisco 49ers]] for the 2012 season then opted to retire prior to the 2013 season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2013/8/12/4614828/randy-moss-nfl-fox-analyst|title=Randy Moss is officially an NFL analyst for Fox Sports 1, as part of 'Fox Football Daily'|last=Lepore|first=Steve|date=August 12, 2013|work=[[SB Nation]]|access-date=November 26, 2016|via=}}</ref> He played in two [[Super Bowl]] games, [[Super Bowl XLII|XLII]] with the Patriots and [[Super Bowl XLVII|XLVII]] with the 49ers, both losses.\n\nOn February 3, 2018, he was selected to join the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in his first year of eligibility.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000913913/article/ray-lewis-terrell-owens-randy-moss-highlight-hof-class|title=Ray Lewis, Terrell Owens, Randy Moss lead HOF class|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nMoss was born in Charleston, West Virginia and moved to [[Rand, West Virginia]] at a young age.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bieler|first1=Des|title=What we learned from ESPN's \u201930 for 30\u2032 on Randy Moss|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2014/11/12/the-30-for-30-on-randy-moss-what-we-learned/|accessdate=March 27, 2016|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=McGarry|first1=Tim|title=Randy Moss remembers his roots with Rand University|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2012/09/16/randy-moss-and-rand-university/70000476/1|accessdate=March 27, 2016|newspaper=USA Today|date=September 17, 2012}}</ref> He attended DuPont High School, one of two schools that later consolidated into [[Riverside High School (West Virginia)|Riverside High School]], where he excelled in football, basketball, baseball, and track.

Moss was also the leading kickoff returner in Division I-AA on the season, with 612 total yards and a 34.0 yard average.

His first touchdown was a 48-yard acrobatic grab over defensive back Floyd Young late in the first quarter, in which Moss juggled the ball 3 times before securing it for the score. He added a 31-yard touchdown reception on the Vikings first possession of the second quarter to give the Vikings a 21\u20130 lead.\n\nHis first ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game came in Week 5 against the [[Green Bay Packers]] at [[Lambeau Field]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199810050gnb.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Green Bay Packers - October 5th, 1998 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |access-date=February 15, 2018}}</ref> He had 5 receptions for 190 yards and two touchdowns, including touchdown grabs of 52 yards and 44 yards, and two other receptions of 46 yards and 41 yards.

He had 9 receptions for a Pro Bowl record 212 yards and was given the game's Most Valuable Player award.\n\n====2000 season====\nThe 2000 season featured second year quarterback [[Daunte Culpepper]] leading the team. Culpepper had been the team's first round draft pick in 1999; with a pick they received from the Redskins for quarterback Brad Johnson. He had been selected largely due to his extremely strong arm, which the team believed was perfectly suited for Moss's deep routes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The decision proved correct. Culpepper was a rookie sensation, the Vikings started 7-0, and Moss was a leading MVP candidate. For the second time in three seasons, Moss punished the Dallas Cowboys in Dallas on Thanksgiving Day, including a spectacular 2nd half touchdown in which Moss caught the ball with his entire body out of bounds, aside from his toes. The play would be the feature shot in NFL commercials for years to come. Moss finished the season with a career-high 1,437 yards and league leading 15 touchdown catches. In doing so, he became the youngest and fastest player to ever catch over 3,000 yards and 45 touchdowns, earning him his 3rd consecutive trip to the Pro Bowl, and 2nd selection to the All Pro team.

He was scheduled to earn $3.5 million in 2001.

One of the strategies the Vikings first-year head coach came up with was a formula to get Moss the ball more often. Coach Tice called it the Randy Ratio. It was an effort on the coaches part to throw 40% of the passes to Moss as a way to keep him involved in the offense more than he had been in the 2001 season when he had stretches in games where he was being shut out, and partly to use more game clock by sustaining long drives to give the Vikings defense a chance to rest.<ref name=\"RandyRatio\">{{cite news | first=Dan | last=Pompei | title=If Ratio Rules, Teams Will Gather No Moss | date=August 26, 2002 | publisher=The Sporting News | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_34_226/ai_95676850/ | accessdate = November 21, 2009}}{{dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref> An assistant coach would stand on the sidelines during games and track how many times Moss had been thrown to, and then inform Tice of the percentages so that he is always aware of it. In the 2001 season, the Vikings record was 4\u20131 when Moss had 40% of the passes thrown his direction, and 1\u201310 in other games.<ref name=\"2002NFLpreview\"/>\n\nThe strategy was a response to the 'Randy Rules,' as Vikings receiver [[Chris Walsh (American football)|Chris Walsh]] called them. The Randy Rules, similar to the [[Jordan Rules]], were a defensive strategy that teams employed when facing the Vikings to try and eliminate or reduce Randy's impact on the game, and to prevent Moss from being matched up [[man-to-man defense|one-on-one]] with defenders because of his ability to burn them deep or outjump them in single coverage. Opposing teams would routinely double cover Moss with techniques such as having a [[cornerback]] attempt to [[Cornerback#Jamming the receiver|jam]] him at the line of scrimmage, having a corner defend underneath with a [[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|safety]] defending against the deep ball, having a [[zone defense]] roll to Moss' side of the field, and assigning \"spies\" to follow Moss everywhere he went.\n\nCoach Tice discussed the strategy, explaining that Moss would be running more short and intermediate routes and fewer deep patterns. In training camp, Moss worked specifically on 12 new routes that he had rarely run in his first 4 NFL seasons, such as crossing patterns over the middle of the field and hook routes.<ref name=\"RandyRatio\"/> Coach Tice said, \"When we say Randy Ratio, everybody in the league thinks, 'OK, now they're going to throw the ball down the field to Randy more and more and more.' That's so far from the truth. In fact, we'll probably throw the ball down the field to Randy this year even less.\"<ref name=\"RandyRatio\"/>\n\nThe Randy Ratio did not last very long, as Tice scrapped the idea midway through the 2002 season. Randy Moss said \"I didn't really care much about the Randy Ratio when it was brought up. I just wanted to win.\"<ref name=\"metamorphosis\">{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Moss' Metamorphosis | date=August 15, 2003 | publisher=SI.com | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2003/08/15/randy_ratio_ap/ | accessdate = November 21, 2009}}</ref> While Moss caught a career-high 106 passes, he also had a career low 7 touchdown receptions, and the Vikings struggled to a 6\u201310 record. Tice suggested after the season that it was a mistake to inform opponents about his offensive gameplan, but that it was a tool \"to motivate [Moss] and say he was the guy.\"<ref name=\"metamorphosis\"/>\n\n====2003 season====\nMoss' fortunes took a better turn on the football field during the [[2003 NFL season|2003]] regular season, where he became the second wide receiver in NFL history (behind Jerry Rice in 1995) to play more than 12 games (he played 16) while averaging over 100 yards and one touchdown per contest. He finished with 111 receptions for 1,632 yards and 17 touchdowns. All three numbers either tied or became a new personal best for Moss. Vikings finished 9-7 for the season. One of Moss's memorable highlights that year was when he lateraled to Moe Williams for a last second touchdown during a home game against Denver.\n\nIn the offseason, he attended the Vikings strength & conditioning program and added five pounds of muscle to his frame.<ref name=\"metamorphosis\"/>\n\n====2004 season====\nMoss started the season strong catching 8 touchdowns in his first 5 games of the season. However, he sustained a hamstring injury to his right leg against [[New Orleans Saints|New Orleans]] in Week 6 that hampered him for the next five weeks. He played in Week 7 against [[Tennessee Titans|Tennessee]], but had no receptions in a game for the first time in his career. He also played the following week against the Giants, but again recorded no receptions and was used mainly as a decoy. The injury eventually sidelined him for 3 straight weeks. He returned to the lineup in Week 12 with a touchdown catch against the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]].\n\nEven though he finished the season with 13 touchdowns in 13 games, he posted career lows in receptions (49) and receiving yards (767). 2004 was the first season in his career that he failed to reach the 1,000 yard mark.\n\nOn January 9, 2005, the Minnesota Vikings played division rival [[Green Bay Packers]] in an [[2004\u201305 NFL playoffs#NFC: Minnesota Vikings 31, Green Bay Packers 17|NFC wildcard playoff game]]. Moss finished the game with 4 catches for 70 yards and two touchdowns in the 31\u201317 win.

He was drafted by the [[Los Angeles Rams]] in the second round of the [[1994 NFL Draft]] after playing [[college football]] for the [[Memphis Tigers football|University of Memphis]]. \n\nAn [[1999 All-Pro Team|All-Pro]] and four-time [[Pro Bowl]] selection, Bruce amassed 15,208 receiving yards in his career (fifth all-time). He played the first 14 years with the Rams and won a [[Super Bowl ring]] with the team in [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] over the [[Tennessee Titans]]. He also played for [[History of the San Francisco 49ers|the San Francisco 49ers]]. During his time with the Rams, he was the leading wide receiver of \u201c[[The Greatest Show on Turf]]\u201d. In 2020, Bruce, after six years of eligibility, was selected into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Early years==\nBruce was born in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]. He graduated from [[Dillard High School]] in Fort Lauderdale in 1990. As a senior for the Panthers football team, he caught 39 passes for 644 yards (16.5 yards per rec. avg.), was an All-County selection, and led his team to the 1989 Florida State 4-A Championship.\n\n==College career==\nBruce originally signed his letter of intent to play [[college football]] for [[Purdue Boilermakers football|the Purdue Boilermakers]] in 1990,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-02-15/sports/9001130889_1_todd-collins-iowa-staten-island/2 |title=College Football Letters Of Intent |date=February 15, 1990 |work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=September 23, 2016}}</ref> but his SAT scores were too low for Purdue to accept him.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-05/sports/sp-59048_1_isaac-bruce |title=Rookie Receiver Bruce Is Making a Good First Impression: Rams: With three of his 12 receptions going for touchdowns, opponents are beginning to pay more attention to him. |author=Mike Reilly |date=November 5, 1994 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=September 23, 2016}}</ref> Bruce then decided to attend [[West Los Angeles College]], then to [[Santa Monica College]] before transferring to the [[University of Memphis|Memphis State University]]. In 1992, Bruce's first year with Memphis, he had 39 receptions for 532 yards and five touchdowns. In 1993, he became the first wide receiver in program history to post a 1,000-yard receiving season. He finished the season with a school-record 74 catches for 1,054 yards and 10 touchdowns. He earned a degree from Memphis in [[physical education]], and he is the only Memphis player to be selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wreg.com/2020/02/01/isaac-bruce-becomes-the-first-tiger-player-selected-to-the-pro-football-hall-of-fame/|title=Isaac Bruce becomes the first Tiger player selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame |author=Megan Rice |date=February 1, 2020 |work=WREG Memphis News Channel 3|accessdate=February 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===College statistics===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"|\n! colspan=\"5\"| Receiving\n! colspan=\"5\"| Rushing\n|-\n!

He signed a 3-year, $1.75 million contract with the Rams on July 14, 1994. He earned the 1994 [[Los Angeles Rams awards#Carroll Rosenbloom Memorial Award|Carroll Rosenbloom Award]], given to the team rookie of the year. He was also voted Rams Rookie of the Year by Orange County Sports Association and the Southern California Sports Broadcasters Association. His first NFL reception was a 34-yard touchdown throw from [[Chris Miller (American football)|Chris Miller]] at Atlanta on September 11, 1994. After that touchdown, when Bruce made a catch, the Rams fans yelled \u201cBruuuuuuce\u201d.\n\n===St. Louis Rams===\nHe moved with the team to St. Louis in 1995. In 1995, Bruce was named the NFC's week 1 Special Teams player of the Week after blocking a punt that contributed to a Rams win. He was also the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for week 6 following a 10-catch, 191 yard, 2 TD performance. His total receiving yards for 1995 (119 catches for 1,781 yards) was second only to [[Jerry Rice]]\u2019s then record of 1,848 yards for one season, and is still the fifth most in a single season. In accomplishing this feat, Isaac Bruce surpassed former Houston Oilers WR [[Charley Hennigan]]\u2019s 34-year-old record of 1,746 set in 1961. Bruce\u2019s 119 catches also ranks 12th on the NFL\u2019s all-time single-season reception list. Bruce further broke four Rams\u2019 records, including most receiving yards, most receptions, most consecutive 100-yard receiving games (6) and most 100-yard games (9). Bruce made [[USA Today]]\u2019s All-Joe team, [[John Madden (American football)#All-Madden|All-Madden]], and All-Pro by [[Sports Illustrated]] and he was voted a first alternate to the Pro Bowl. He was also awarded the [[St Louis Rams awards#Daniel F. Reeves Memorial Award|Rams MVP]].\n\nIn 1996, Bruce led his team with 84 receptions and led the NFL with 1,338 yards. He became the first Rams receiver since Henry Ellard in 1990 and 1991 to post back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons. Against the [[Baltimore Ravens]] on October 27, 1996, he caught 11 passes for 229 yards and a touchdown. On November 30, 1996, Bruce was re-signed by the Rams to a 4-year $12.1 million contract extension.<ref>[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]], November 28, 1996</ref> In 1996 Bruce was also voted to his first Pro Bowl, after having been an alternate the season before.\n\nIn the following seasons, Bruce was hampered by hamstring injuries. In 1997, he missed the first six games due to injury and in 1998 he missed the final nine games (he also missed two other games earlier in the season). In Atlanta on November 2, 1997, Bruce had another 200-yard game, totaling 10 catches, 233 yards and recording 2 touchdowns. Prior to his injury in 1998 in a home game against [[1998 Minnesota Vikings season|the Minnesota Vikings]], Bruce had 11 catches for 192 yards and an 80-yard touchdown.\n\nIn 1999, Bruce was a First-team All-Pro and was voted to his second Pro Bowl. He caught 77 passes for 1,165 yards and 12 touchdowns as Rams had a 13\u20133 record and advanced to the Super Bowl. He also led Rams in receiving yards in the playoffs, with 317 yards on 13 catches with a team-high two touchdowns. Bruce caught [[Kurt Warner]]\u2019s 73-yard touchdown pass late in the fourth quarter of [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] to give the Rams a 23\u201316 lead, which turned out to be the game winner.\n\n[[File:Isaac Bruce 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Bruce with the Rams in 2007.]]\nPrior to the 2000 season, Bruce was re-signed by the Rams to a 7-year, $42 million contract extension.<ref>[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]], August 17, 1996</ref> In 2000 Bruce was again a Pro Bowler and caught 87 passes for 1,471 yards and 9 touchdowns. He became the first Rams receiver to earn back-to-back Pro Bowl invitations since Henry Ellard accomplished the feat for [[1988 Los Angeles Rams season|the 1988]] [[1989 Los Angeles Rams season|and 1989]] seasons. Bruce either led or was tied for the most receptions six times in 2000, led the team in receiving yards six times, and posted four 100-yard receiving games. That same year, Bruce and teammate [[Torry Holt]] became only the second WR duo from the same team to each gain over 1,400 yards in the same season (see [[Herman Moore]] and [[Brett Perriman]]).\n\nIn 2001, the Rams returned to the Super Bowl, losing to [[2001 New England Patriots season|the New England Patriots]], and Bruce made the Pro Bowl for the fourth time, becoming only the third receiver in franchise history to earn three consecutive Pro Bowl invitations ([[Elroy Hirsch]] 1951\u201353, [[Jim Phillips (American football)|Jim Phillips]] 1960\u201362). Bruce was voted offensive captain and became the franchise career leader in 100-yard receiving games (29), 1,000-yard seasons (5), and receiving touchdowns (56). He became just the second player in team history to post 500 career receptions vs. [[2001 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on October 14, 2001. He caught five passes for 56 yards against New England in [[Super Bowl XXXVI]].\n\nBruce became the Rams\u2019 all-time leader in receptions in 2002 while posting his fourth consecutive 1,000-yard receiving season. That year, he led the team with seven touchdown receptions, and ended the season with 79 receptions for 1,075 yards. On his 30th birthday, Bruce had three fumbles in a game. Luckily for Bruce, he scored a game-winning touchdown and the game is almost forgotten because of 34-34 tie between the Falcons and Steelers the same day.\n\nIn 2003, Bruce missed the 1,000 mark for the first time since 1998, finishing with 69 catches for 981 yards and 5 touchdowns, however, he became the Rams\u2019 all-time leader in receiving yards (10,461), passing his position coach [[Henry Ellard]] (9,761). That year Bruce made seven receptions for 116 yards in the NFC Divisional Playoff Game vs. Carolina on January 10, 2004, making him the only Rams player to have four career 100-yard postseason performances, breaking a tie with [[Tom Fears]].\n\nIn 2004, Bruce caught 89 passes (fifth in the NFC, eighth in the NFL) for 1,292 yards (fifth in the NFL). He started the season with four consecutive 100-yard receiving performances, the first player to accomplish this feat since Houston's Charley Hennigan in 1963. Bruce nabbed a team-high nine catches for 170 yards and one touchdown at Green Bay on November 29, 2004.\n\nWith the retirement of [[Jerry Rice]], Bruce entered 2005 as the NFL's active leader in career receiving yards; a foot injury caused him to miss 5 games, and he was passed by [[Marvin Harrison]] by the end of the season. Still, he became the 14th player in NFL history with 800 career receptions on December 11 at Minnesota.\n\nOn March 7, 2006, the Rams released Bruce rather than pay him a $1.5 million bonus;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/08/sports/football/nfl-salarycap-math-deals-full-of-funny-money.html|title=N.F.L.

He was drafted by the [[Los Angeles Rams]] in the second round of the [[1994 NFL Draft]] after playing [[college football]] for the [[Memphis Tigers football|University of Memphis]]. \n\nAn [[1999 All-Pro Team|All-Pro]] and four-time [[Pro Bowl]] selection, Bruce amassed 15,208 receiving yards in his career (fifth all-time). He played the first 14 years with the Rams and won a [[Super Bowl ring]] with the team in [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] over the [[Tennessee Titans]]. He also played for [[History of the San Francisco 49ers|the San Francisco 49ers]]. During his time with the Rams, he was the leading wide receiver of \u201c[[The Greatest Show on Turf]]\u201d. In 2020, Bruce, after six years of eligibility, was selected into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Early years==\nBruce was born in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]. He graduated from [[Dillard High School]] in Fort Lauderdale in 1990. As a senior for the Panthers football team, he caught 39 passes for 644 yards (16.5 yards per rec. avg.), was an All-County selection, and led his team to the 1989 Florida State 4-A Championship.\n\n==College career==\nBruce originally signed his letter of intent to play [[college football]] for [[Purdue Boilermakers football|the Purdue Boilermakers]] in 1990,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-02-15/sports/9001130889_1_todd-collins-iowa-staten-island/2 |title=College Football Letters Of Intent |date=February 15, 1990 |work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=September 23, 2016}}</ref> but his SAT scores were too low for Purdue to accept him.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-05/sports/sp-59048_1_isaac-bruce |title=Rookie Receiver Bruce Is Making a Good First Impression: Rams: With three of his 12 receptions going for touchdowns, opponents are beginning to pay more attention to him. |author=Mike Reilly |date=November 5, 1994 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=September 23, 2016}}</ref> Bruce then decided to attend [[West Los Angeles College]], then to [[Santa Monica College]] before transferring to the [[University of Memphis|Memphis State University]]. In 1992, Bruce's first year with Memphis, he had 39 receptions for 532 yards and five touchdowns. In 1993, he became the first wide receiver in program history to post a 1,000-yard receiving season. He finished the season with a school-record 74 catches for 1,054 yards and 10 touchdowns. He earned a degree from Memphis in [[physical education]], and he is the only Memphis player to be selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wreg.com/2020/02/01/isaac-bruce-becomes-the-first-tiger-player-selected-to-the-pro-football-hall-of-fame/|title=Isaac Bruce becomes the first Tiger player selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame |author=Megan Rice |date=February 1, 2020 |work=WREG Memphis News Channel 3|accessdate=February 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===College statistics===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"|\n! colspan=\"5\"| Receiving\n! colspan=\"5\"| Rushing\n|-\n!

He signed a 3-year, $1.75 million contract with the Rams on July 14, 1994. He earned the 1994 [[Los Angeles Rams awards#Carroll Rosenbloom Memorial Award|Carroll Rosenbloom Award]], given to the team rookie of the year. He was also voted Rams Rookie of the Year by Orange County Sports Association and the Southern California Sports Broadcasters Association. His first NFL reception was a 34-yard touchdown throw from [[Chris Miller (American football)|Chris Miller]] at Atlanta on September 11, 1994. After that touchdown, when Bruce made a catch, the Rams fans yelled \u201cBruuuuuuce\u201d.\n\n===St. Louis Rams===\nHe moved with the team to St. Louis in 1995. In 1995, Bruce was named the NFC's week 1 Special Teams player of the Week after blocking a punt that contributed to a Rams win. He was also the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for week 6 following a 10-catch, 191 yard, 2 TD performance. His total receiving yards for 1995 (119 catches for 1,781 yards) was second only to [[Jerry Rice]]\u2019s then record of 1,848 yards for one season, and is still the fifth most in a single season. In accomplishing this feat, Isaac Bruce surpassed former Houston Oilers WR [[Charley Hennigan]]\u2019s 34-year-old record of 1,746 set in 1961. Bruce\u2019s 119 catches also ranks 12th on the NFL\u2019s all-time single-season reception list. Bruce further broke four Rams\u2019 records, including most receiving yards, most receptions, most consecutive 100-yard receiving games (6) and most 100-yard games (9). Bruce made [[USA Today]]\u2019s All-Joe team, [[John Madden (American football)#All-Madden|All-Madden]], and All-Pro by [[Sports Illustrated]] and he was voted a first alternate to the Pro Bowl. He was also awarded the [[St Louis Rams awards#Daniel F. Reeves Memorial Award|Rams MVP]].\n\nIn 1996, Bruce led his team with 84 receptions and led the NFL with 1,338 yards. He became the first Rams receiver since Henry Ellard in 1990 and 1991 to post back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons. Against the [[Baltimore Ravens]] on October 27, 1996, he caught 11 passes for 229 yards and a touchdown. On November 30, 1996, Bruce was re-signed by the Rams to a 4-year $12.1 million contract extension.<ref>[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]], November 28, 1996</ref> In 1996 Bruce was also voted to his first Pro Bowl, after having been an alternate the season before.\n\nIn the following seasons, Bruce was hampered by hamstring injuries. In 1997, he missed the first six games due to injury and in 1998 he missed the final nine games (he also missed two other games earlier in the season). In Atlanta on November 2, 1997, Bruce had another 200-yard game, totaling 10 catches, 233 yards and recording 2 touchdowns. Prior to his injury in 1998 in a home game against [[1998 Minnesota Vikings season|the Minnesota Vikings]], Bruce had 11 catches for 192 yards and an 80-yard touchdown.\n\nIn 1999, Bruce was a First-team All-Pro and was voted to his second Pro Bowl. He caught 77 passes for 1,165 yards and 12 touchdowns as Rams had a 13\u20133 record and advanced to the Super Bowl. He also led Rams in receiving yards in the playoffs, with 317 yards on 13 catches with a team-high two touchdowns. Bruce caught [[Kurt Warner]]\u2019s 73-yard touchdown pass late in the fourth quarter of [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] to give the Rams a 23\u201316 lead, which turned out to be the game winner.\n\n[[File:Isaac Bruce 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Bruce with the Rams in 2007.]]\nPrior to the 2000 season, Bruce was re-signed by the Rams to a 7-year, $42 million contract extension.<ref>[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]], August 17, 1996</ref> In 2000 Bruce was again a Pro Bowler and caught 87 passes for 1,471 yards and 9 touchdowns. He became the first Rams receiver to earn back-to-back Pro Bowl invitations since Henry Ellard accomplished the feat for [[1988 Los Angeles Rams season|the 1988]] [[1989 Los Angeles Rams season|and 1989]] seasons. Bruce either led or was tied for the most receptions six times in 2000, led the team in receiving yards six times, and posted four 100-yard receiving games. That same year, Bruce and teammate [[Torry Holt]] became only the second WR duo from the same team to each gain over 1,400 yards in the same season (see [[Herman Moore]] and [[Brett Perriman]]).\n\nIn 2001, the Rams returned to the Super Bowl, losing to [[2001 New England Patriots season|the New England Patriots]], and Bruce made the Pro Bowl for the fourth time, becoming only the third receiver in franchise history to earn three consecutive Pro Bowl invitations ([[Elroy Hirsch]] 1951\u201353, [[Jim Phillips (American football)|Jim Phillips]] 1960\u201362). Bruce was voted offensive captain and became the franchise career leader in 100-yard receiving games (29), 1,000-yard seasons (5), and receiving touchdowns (56). He became just the second player in team history to post 500 career receptions vs. [[2001 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on October 14, 2001. He caught five passes for 56 yards against New England in [[Super Bowl XXXVI]].\n\nBruce became the Rams\u2019 all-time leader in receptions in 2002 while posting his fourth consecutive 1,000-yard receiving season. That year, he led the team with seven touchdown receptions, and ended the season with 79 receptions for 1,075 yards. On his 30th birthday, Bruce had three fumbles in a game. Luckily for Bruce, he scored a game-winning touchdown and the game is almost forgotten because of 34-34 tie between the Falcons and Steelers the same day.\n\nIn 2003, Bruce missed the 1,000 mark for the first time since 1998, finishing with 69 catches for 981 yards and 5 touchdowns, however, he became the Rams\u2019 all-time leader in receiving yards (10,461), passing his position coach [[Henry Ellard]] (9,761). That year Bruce made seven receptions for 116 yards in the NFC Divisional Playoff Game vs. Carolina on January 10, 2004, making him the only Rams player to have four career 100-yard postseason performances, breaking a tie with [[Tom Fears]].\n\nIn 2004, Bruce caught 89 passes (fifth in the NFC, eighth in the NFL) for 1,292 yards (fifth in the NFL). He started the season with four consecutive 100-yard receiving performances, the first player to accomplish this feat since Houston's Charley Hennigan in 1963. Bruce nabbed a team-high nine catches for 170 yards and one touchdown at Green Bay on November 29, 2004.\n\nWith the retirement of [[Jerry Rice]], Bruce entered 2005 as the NFL's active leader in career receiving yards; a foot injury caused him to miss 5 games, and he was passed by [[Marvin Harrison]] by the end of the season.

When ''X \u2297 Y'' is endowed with this topology then it is denoted by <math>X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y</math> and called the '''projective tensor product''' of ''X'' and ''Y''. \n\n== Preliminaries ==\nThroughout let ''X'',''Y'', and ''Z'' be [[topological vector space]]s and <math>L : X \\to Y</math> be a linear map. \n\n* <math>L : X \\to Y</math> is a '''topological homomorphism''' or '''homomorphism''', if it is linear, continuous, and <math>L : X \\to \\operatorname{Im} L</math> is an [[open map]], where <math>\\operatorname{Im} L</math>, the image of ''L'', has the subspace topology induced by ''Y''. \n** If ''S'' is a subspace of ''X'' then both the quotient map <math>X \\to X / S</math> and the canonical injection <math>S \\to X</math> are homomorphisms. In particular, any linear map <math>L : X \\to Y</math> can be canonically decomposed as follows: <math>X \\to X / \\operatorname{ker} L \\overset{L_0}{\\rightarrow} \\operatorname{Im} L \\to Y</math> where <math>L_0\\left( x + \\operatorname{ker} L \\right) := L (x)</math> defines a bijection. \n* The set of continuous linear maps <math>X \\to Z</math> (resp. continuous bilinear maps <math>X \\times Y \\to Z</math>) will be denoted by ''L(X, Z)'' (resp.
