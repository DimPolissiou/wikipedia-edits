(formerly '''Angel Studios, Inc.''') is an American [[video game developer]] and a studio of [[Rockstar Games]] based in [[Carlsbad, California]]. Founded by [[Colombians|Colombian]] artist and businessman Diego Angel in 1984, the company initially focused on animations and [[visual effects]] for multimedia productions, including films and [[music video]]s. Following Angel's business strategy of avoiding high-risk business sectors, the company began working in the [[video game industry]] during the 1990s. Its first video game projects were [[Ed Annunziata]]'s ''[[Ecco: The Tides of Time]]'' (1994) and ''[[Mr. Bones (video game)|Mr. Bones]]'' (1996), for which Angel Studios created [[cutscene]]s.\n\nThe company developed its own games in association with [[Nintendo]] (''[[Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr.]]'' and ''[[Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest]]'') and [[Microsoft]] (''[[Midtown Madness]]'' and ''[[Midtown Madness 2]]''), and produced a [[Porting|port]] of [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]]. Impressed with the studio's work on ''Midtown Madness'', Rockstar Games approached Angel Studios with a long-term partnership in 1999, which resulted in the creation of video game series ''[[Midnight Club]]'' and ''[[Smuggler's Run]]''.\n\nIn November 2002, Angel Studios was acquired by [[Take-Two Interactive]] (Rockstar Games' parent company) and became part of Rockstar Games as Rockstar San Diego. Since 2004, Rockstar San Diego has housed an internal [[game engine]] team that develops the [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] (RAGE), Rockstar Games' proprietary engine used in most titles developed by its studios for [[personal computer]]s and [[Video game console|consoles]]. Rockstar San Diego led development of the 2010 game ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' and its [[expansion pack]] ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'', and collaborated with other Rockstar Games studios on ''[[Max Payne 3]]'' (2012), ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018).\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Beginnings, partnerships, and ''Resident Evil 2'' port (1984\u20132000) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Diego Angel.jpg|thumb|left|Diego Angel founded Angel Studios in 1984 and served as its [[President (corporate title)|president]] until 2005.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: How\" />]] -->\nColombian artist and businessman Diego Angel founded Angel Studios in 1984 in [[Carlsbad, California]], as a [[work-for-hire]] studio that created [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Founding partners included Brad Hunt, Michael Limber, and Angel's [[brother-in-law]], of whom Limber became the company's [[chief creative officer]].<ref name=\"Playing at the Next Level\" /><ref name=\"VentureBeat: CCO\" /> Angel employed a philosophy he called the \"three P's\" (passion, patience, and perseverance), which meant that he would not accept any offer simply because it came his way;

(formerly '''Angel Studios, Inc.''') is an American [[video game developer]] and a studio of [[Rockstar Games]] based in [[Carlsbad, California]]. Founded by [[Colombians|Colombian]] artist and businessman Diego Angel in 1984, the company initially focused on animations and [[visual effects]] for multimedia productions, including films and [[music video]]s. Following Angel's business strategy of avoiding high-risk business sectors, the company began working in the [[video game industry]] during the 1990s. Its first video game projects were [[Ed Annunziata]]'s ''[[Ecco: The Tides of Time]]'' (1994) and ''[[Mr. Bones (video game)|Mr. Bones]]'' (1996), for which Angel Studios created [[cutscene]]s.\n\nThe company developed its own games in association with [[Nintendo]] (''[[Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr.]]'' and ''[[Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest]]'') and [[Microsoft]] (''[[Midtown Madness]]'' and ''[[Midtown Madness 2]]''), and produced a [[Porting|port]] of [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]]. Impressed with the studio's work on ''Midtown Madness'', Rockstar Games approached Angel Studios with a long-term partnership in 1999, which resulted in the creation of video game series ''[[Midnight Club]]'' and ''[[Smuggler's Run]]''.\n\nIn November 2002, Angel Studios was acquired by [[Take-Two Interactive]] (Rockstar Games' parent company) and became part of Rockstar Games as Rockstar San Diego. Since 2004, Rockstar San Diego has housed an internal [[game engine]] team that develops the [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] (RAGE), Rockstar Games' proprietary engine used in most titles developed by its studios for [[personal computer]]s and [[Video game console|consoles]].

There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a [[backdoor pilot]], in the form of a television film titled ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''. The programme was [[History of Doctor Who#2000s|relaunched in 2005]], and since then has been produced in-house by [[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]] in [[Cardiff]]. ''Doctor Who'' has also spawned numerous [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]], including comic books, films, novels, audio dramas, and the television series ''[[Torchwood]]'' (2006\u20132011), ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007\u20132011), ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'' (2009\u20132010), and ''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]'' (2016), and has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture.\n\nThirteen actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|concept of regeneration]] into a new [[incarnation]], a [[plot device]] in which a Time Lord \"transforms\" into a new body when the current one is too badly harmed to heal normally. Each actor's portrayal is unique, but all represent stages in the life of the same character, and together, they form a single lifetime with a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The Doctor is currently portrayed by [[Jodie Whittaker]], who took on the role after [[Peter Capaldi]]'s exit in the 2017 Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\".\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n''Doctor Who'' follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]] who goes by the name \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\". The Doctor fled Gallifrey in a stolen [[TARDIS]] (\"Time and Relative Dimension in Space\"), a [[time travel|time machine]] that travels by materialising into and dematerialising out of the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a \"chameleon circuit\" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise; due to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British [[police box]].\n\nAcross time and space, the Doctor's many incarnations often find events that pique their curiosity and try to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and minimal resources, such as the versatile [[sonic screwdriver]]. The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] to share these adventures. These companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor's fascination with planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international military task force [[UNIT]] when the Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] in case of mortal damage to the body, taking on a new appearance and personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during their travels, including the [[Dalek]]s, the [[Cybermen]], and [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], another renegade Time Lord.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Doctor Who}}\n''Doctor Who'' first appeared on [[BBC One|BBC TV]] at 17:16:20 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on Saturday, 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, due to the [[assassination of John F.

Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The [[BBC television drama|head of drama]] [[Sydney Newman]] was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) [[Donald Wilson (writer and producer)|Donald Wilson]] and staff writer [[C. E. Webber]]. Writer [[Anthony Coburn]], [[Script editor|story editor]] [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] and initial producer [[Verity Lambert]] also heavily contributed to the development of the series.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), pp. 157\u2013230 (\"Production Diary\")</ref><ref group=note>Newman is often given sole creator credit for the series. Some reference works such as ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947\u20131979'' by Vincent Terrace erroneously credit Terry Nation with creating ''Doctor Who'', because of the way his name is credited in the two Peter Cushing films.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}<br />Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1992), p. 3.</ref> as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963, Whitaker commissioned [[Terry Nation]] to write a story under the title ''The Mutants''. As originally written, the [[Dalek]]s and [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thals]] were the victims of an alien [[neutron bomb]] attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"[[bug-eyed monster]]s\". According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice&nbsp;\u2014 we only had the Dalek serial to go&nbsp;... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second ''Doctor Who'' serial&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Daleks]]'' (also known as ''The Mutants''). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.<ref>Steve Tribe, James Goss ''Dr Who: The Dalek Handbook'' [[BBC Books]] [[Random House]] 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-84990-232-8}} Pg9</ref>\n\nThe BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC 1]].

This was prompted by the poor health of the original star, [[William Hartnell]].

In ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', [[Richard Hurndall]] played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975; 34 years later [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] similarly replaced Hartnell in ''[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]''. In ''[[Time and the Rani]]'', Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. For more information, see the [[list of actors who have played the Doctor]]. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including [[Peter Cushing]] in [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|two films]].\n\nThe casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's gender (prior to the casting of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors were white prior to the casting of [[Jo Martin]] in \"[[Fugitive of the Judoon]]\") and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55).<ref>Ted B.

In 1973's ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted ''[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]'' serial. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's ''[[The Two Doctors]]'' with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"[[Time Crash]]\" alongside David Tennant. In \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor meets a previously unseen incarnation of himself, subsequently revealed to be the [[War Doctor]].<ref name=\"HurtDoctor\" /> In the following episode, \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", David Tennant's [[Tenth Doctor]] appeared alongside [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Day of the Doctor|series=Doctor Who|network=BBC|station=BBC One|location=Cardiff|date=23 November 2013|minutes=60}}</ref> Additionally, multiple incarnations of the Doctor have met in various [[Doctor Who#Audios|audio dramas]] and [[Doctor Who#Books|novels]] based on the television show. In 2017, the First Doctor (this time portrayed by [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]]) returned alongside Peter Capaldi in \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" and \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\". In 2020\u2019s \u201cFugitive of the Judoon\u201d, Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor meets Jo Martin\u2019s incarnation of the Doctor, subsequently known as the Fugitive Doctor. They met later, albeit briefly, in \u201cThe Timeless Children\u201d later that year.\n\n====Revelations about the Doctor====\n{{See also|The Doctor (Doctor Who)#Inconsistencies|l1=The Doctor: Inconsistencies}}\n\nThroughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor might not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted might have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms \"Fourth\", the First Doctor excitedly replies \"Goodness me. So there are five of me now.\" In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself \"the Eleventh\" in \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\". In the 2013 episode \"The Time of the Doctor,\" the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied \"Fall of the Eleventh\" which had been trailed throughout the series.\n\nDuring the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord.

These characters were intended to act as [[audience surrogates]], through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure.<ref name=Overview/> The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] ([[Mary Tamm]] and [[Lalla Ward]]), a [[Time Lord|Time Lady]]; [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]); and [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes&nbsp;\u2014 or loves&nbsp;\u2014 on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.\n\nSince the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role.

Their main weakness is their eyestalk;  attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to \"exterminate\" all non-Dalek beings. They even attack the [[Time Lord]]s in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show.

The original theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], with assistance from [[Dick Mills]] and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964.   The various parts were built up using [[musique concr\u00e8te]] techniques, by creating [[tape loop]]s of an individually struck piano string and individual test [[oscillation|oscillators]] and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of [[Doctor Who (season 17)|season 17]] (1979\u201380). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of [[Magnetic tape sound recording|analogue tape]] containing recordings of a single plucked string, [[white noise]], and the simple [[harmonic]] waveforms of [[Tone generator|test-tone oscillators]], intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines.

Since its 2005 return, the series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the 1970s to the 2000s.\n\nThe incidental music for the first ''Doctor Who'' adventure, ''An Unearthly Child'', was written by [[Norman Kay (composer)|Norman Kay]]. Many of the stories of the [[William Hartnell]] period were scored by electronic music pioneer [[Tristram Cary]], whose ''Doctor Who'' credits include ''The Daleks'', ''[[Marco Polo (Doctor Who)|Marco Polo]]'', ''The Daleks' Master Plan'', ''The Gunfighters'' and ''[[The Mutants]]''. Other composers in this early period included [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Carey Blyton]] and [[Geoffrey Burgon]].\n\nThe most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was [[Dudley Simpson]], who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for ''[[Blake's 7]]'', and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of ''[[The Tomorrow People]]''. Simpson's first ''Doctor Who'' score was ''[[Planet of Giants]]'' (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' (1979). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' (as a [[Music hall]] conductor).\n\nIn 1980 starting with the serial ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop. [[Paddy Kingsland]] and [[Peter Howell (musician)|Peter Howell]] contributed many scores in this period and other contributors included [[Roger Limb]], [[Malcolm Clarke (composer)|Malcolm Clarke]] and [[Jonathan Gibbs (composer)|Jonathan Gibbs]].\n\nThe Radiophonic Workshop was dropped after 1986's ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' series, and [[Keff McCulloch]] took over as the series' main composer until the end of its run, with [[Dominic Glynn]] and [[Mark Ayres]] also contributing scores.\n\nFrom the 2005 revival to the 2017 Christmas episode \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/921558/Doctor-Who-BBC-Series-11-Jodie-Whittaker-Bradley-Walsh-Exit-Composer-Writer-Murray-Gold-Dr|title=Doctor Who: Bradley Walsh WON'T work with two big stars after they confirm their exits|first=Rory|last=O'Connor|publisher=Express|date=20 February 2018|accessdate=20 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612232906/https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/921558/Doctor-Who-BBC-Series-11-Jodie-Whittaker-Bradley-Walsh-Exit-Composer-Writer-Murray-Gold-Dr|archive-date=12 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> all incidental music for the series was composed by [[Murray Gold]] and [[Ben Foster (orchestrator)|Ben Foster]], and has been performed by the [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]] from the 2005 Christmas episode \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\" onwards.

It also featured a crossover with the soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', the action taking place in the latter's [[Albert Square]] location and around [[Greenwich]]. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the [[Pulfrich effect]] requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.\n\nIn 1999, another special, ''[[Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death|Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', was made for [[Comic Relief]] and later released on VHS. An affectionate [[parody]] of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with [[cliffhanger]]s, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes). In the story, the Doctor ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) encounters both [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) and the [[Dalek]]s. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Hugh Grant]] and [[Joanna Lumley]]. The script was written by [[Steven Moffat]], later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series.<ref name=RTDgone>{{cite news|title=Doctor Who guru Davies steps down|work=BBC News|date=20 May 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7411177.stm|accessdate=20 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215163911/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7411177.stm|archive-date=15 February 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSince the return of ''Doctor Who'' in 2005, the franchise has produced two original \"mini-episodes\" to support Children in Need.

Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on [[LP record]]; ''[[Doctor Who and the Pescatons]]'' featuring the Fourth Doctor.  The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story ''[[State of Decay]]'' in 1981.

Along with the main range, adventures of the First, Second and Third Doctors have been produced in both limited cast and full cast formats, as well as audiobooks.  The 2013 series ''[[Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctor|Destiny of the Doctor]]'', produced as part of the series' 50th Anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show. Along with this, in May 2016 the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, appeared alongside Catherine Tate in a collection of three audio adventures.\n\nIn addition to these main lines, both the BBC and Big Finish have produced original audio dramas and audiobooks based on spin-off material, such as ''Torchwood'' and ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' series.\n\n===Books===\n{{See also|List of Doctor Who novelists}}\n\n''Doctor Who'' books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day.

Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by [[BBC Books]].

There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a [[backdoor pilot]], in the form of a television film titled ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''. The programme was [[History of Doctor Who#2000s|relaunched in 2005]], and since then has been produced in-house by [[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]] in [[Cardiff]]. ''Doctor Who'' has also spawned numerous [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]], including comic books, films, novels, audio dramas, and the television series ''[[Torchwood]]'' (2006\u20132011), ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007\u20132011), ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'' (2009\u20132010), and ''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]'' (2016), and has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture.\n\nThirteen actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|concept of regeneration]] into a new [[incarnation]], a [[plot device]] in which a Time Lord \"transforms\" into a new body when the current one is too badly harmed to heal normally. Each actor's portrayal is unique, but all represent stages in the life of the same character, and together, they form a single lifetime with a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The Doctor is currently portrayed by [[Jodie Whittaker]], who took on the role after [[Peter Capaldi]]'s exit in the 2017 Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\".\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n''Doctor Who'' follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]] who goes by the name \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\". The Doctor fled Gallifrey in a stolen [[TARDIS]] (\"Time and Relative Dimension in Space\"), a [[time travel|time machine]] that travels by materialising into and dematerialising out of the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a \"chameleon circuit\" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise; due to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British [[police box]].\n\nAcross time and space, the Doctor's many incarnations often find events that pique their curiosity and try to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and minimal resources, such as the versatile [[sonic screwdriver]]. The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] to share these adventures. These companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor's fascination with planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international military task force [[UNIT]] when the Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] in case of mortal damage to the body, taking on a new appearance and personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during their travels, including the [[Dalek]]s, the [[Cybermen]], and [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], another renegade Time Lord.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Doctor Who}}\n''Doctor Who'' first appeared on [[BBC One|BBC TV]] at 17:16:20 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on Saturday, 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, due to the [[assassination of John F.

Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The [[BBC television drama|head of drama]] [[Sydney Newman]] was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) [[Donald Wilson (writer and producer)|Donald Wilson]] and staff writer [[C. E. Webber]]. Writer [[Anthony Coburn]], [[Script editor|story editor]] [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] and initial producer [[Verity Lambert]] also heavily contributed to the development of the series.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), pp. 157\u2013230 (\"Production Diary\")</ref><ref group=note>Newman is often given sole creator credit for the series. Some reference works such as ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947\u20131979'' by Vincent Terrace erroneously credit Terry Nation with creating ''Doctor Who'', because of the way his name is credited in the two Peter Cushing films.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}<br />Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1992), p. 3.</ref> as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963, Whitaker commissioned [[Terry Nation]] to write a story under the title ''The Mutants''. As originally written, the [[Dalek]]s and [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thals]] were the victims of an alien [[neutron bomb]] attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"[[bug-eyed monster]]s\". According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice&nbsp;\u2014 we only had the Dalek serial to go&nbsp;... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second ''Doctor Who'' serial&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Daleks]]'' (also known as ''The Mutants''). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.<ref>Steve Tribe, James Goss ''Dr Who: The Dalek Handbook'' [[BBC Books]] [[Random House]] 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-84990-232-8}} Pg9</ref>\n\nThe BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC 1]].

This system was shortened to twelve episodes and one Christmas special following the revival's [[Doctor Who (series 8)|eighth series]], and ten episodes from the  [[Doctor Who (series 11)|eleventh series]]. Each series includes both standalone and multiple episodic stories, linked with a loose story arc that is resolved in the series finale.

The 1993 2-part story, entitled ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'', was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' and was filmed partly on the ''EastEnders'' set.

In ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', [[Richard Hurndall]] played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975; 34 years later [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] similarly replaced Hartnell in ''[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]''. In ''[[Time and the Rani]]'', Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. For more information, see the [[list of actors who have played the Doctor]]. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including [[Peter Cushing]] in [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|two films]].\n\nThe casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's gender (prior to the casting of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors were white prior to the casting of [[Jo Martin]] in \"[[Fugitive of the Judoon]]\") and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55).<ref>Ted B.

In 1973's ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted ''[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]'' serial. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's ''[[The Two Doctors]]'' with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"[[Time Crash]]\" alongside David Tennant. In \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor meets a previously unseen incarnation of himself, subsequently revealed to be the [[War Doctor]].<ref name=\"HurtDoctor\" /> In the following episode, \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", David Tennant's [[Tenth Doctor]] appeared alongside [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Day of the Doctor|series=Doctor Who|network=BBC|station=BBC One|location=Cardiff|date=23 November 2013|minutes=60}}</ref> Additionally, multiple incarnations of the Doctor have met in various [[Doctor Who#Audios|audio dramas]] and [[Doctor Who#Books|novels]] based on the television show. In 2017, the First Doctor (this time portrayed by [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]]) returned alongside Peter Capaldi in \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" and \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\". In 2020\u2019s \u201cFugitive of the Judoon\u201d, Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor meets Jo Martin\u2019s incarnation of the Doctor, subsequently known as the Fugitive Doctor. They met later, albeit briefly, in \u201cThe Timeless Children\u201d later that year.\n\n====Revelations about the Doctor====\n{{See also|The Doctor (Doctor Who)#Inconsistencies|l1=The Doctor: Inconsistencies}}\n\nThroughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor might not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted might have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms \"Fourth\", the First Doctor excitedly replies \"Goodness me. So there are five of me now.\" In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself \"the Eleventh\" in \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\". In the 2013 episode \"The Time of the Doctor,\" the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied \"Fall of the Eleventh\" which had been trailed throughout the series.\n\nDuring the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord. In the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 television film]], the Eighth Doctor describes himself as being \"half human\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|title=Doctor Who: the TV movie|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227174852/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|archive-date=27 February 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The BBC's FAQ for the programme notes that \"purists tend to disregard this\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|title=Doctor Who&nbsp;\u2014 FAQ&nbsp;\u2014 Plot and Continuity|publisher=BBC|date=28 March 2008|accessdate=30 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126134638/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|archive-date=26 January 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> instead focusing on his Gallifreyan heritage.\n\nThe programme's first serial, ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, [[Susan Foreman]]. In the 1967 serial, ''[[Tomb of the Cybermen]]'', when [[Victoria Waterfield]] doubts the Doctor can remember his family because of, \"being so ancient\", the Doctor says that he can when he really wants to\u2014\"The rest of the time they sleep in my mind\". The 2005 series reveals that the Ninth Doctor thought he was the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed; in \"[[The Empty Child]]\" (2005), Dr. Constantine states that, \"Before the war even began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither.\" The Doctor remarks in response, \"Yeah, I know the feeling.\" In \"[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]\" (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, \"No, not any more.\" In both \"[[Fear Her]]\" (2006) and \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\" (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father.\n\nIn \"[[The Wedding of River Song]]\" (2011), it is implied that the Doctor's true name is a secret that must never be revealed; this is explored further in \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), when River Song speaking his name allows the [[Great Intelligence]] to enter his tomb, and in \"The Time of the Doctor\" (2013) where speaking his true name becomes the signal by which the Time Lords would know they can safely return to the universe.\n\n===Companions===\n{{Main|Companion (Doctor Who)}}\nThe companion figure&nbsp;\u2013 generally a human&nbsp;\u2013 has been a constant feature in ''Doctor Who'' since the programme's inception in 1963.

These characters were intended to act as [[audience surrogates]], through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure.<ref name=Overview/> The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] ([[Mary Tamm]] and [[Lalla Ward]]), a [[Time Lord|Time Lady]]; [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]); and [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes&nbsp;\u2014 or loves&nbsp;\u2014 on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.\n\nSince the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role. Steven Moffat described the companion as the main character of the show, as the story begins anew with each companion and she undergoes more change than the Doctor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who-not-the-doctor|title=Steven Moffat: the companion is the main character in Doctor Who, not the Doctor|work=Radio Times|publisher=[[BBC Magazines]]|last=Jones|first=Paul|date=19 April 2012|accessdate=28 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203120410/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who-not-the-doctor|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|title='Doctor Who' returns: Steven Moffat talks new companion Clara and Jenna-Louise Coleman|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|last=Berkshire|first=Geoff|date=27 March 2013|accessdate=28 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002317/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|archivedate=3 December 2013}}</ref> The primary companions of the [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Tenth Doctor|Tenth]] Doctors were [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]), [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]), and [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) with [[Mickey Smith]] ([[Noel Clarke]]) and [[Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]) recurring as secondary companion figures.<ref name=AbsentPostcolonial>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Commonwealth Literature|doi=10.1177/0021989410366891|url=http://jcl.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/45/2/207|title=\"Sociopathetic Abscess\" or \"Yawning Chasm\"?

Their main weakness is their eyestalk;  attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad.

The original theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], with assistance from [[Dick Mills]] and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964.   The various parts were built up using [[musique concr\u00e8te]] techniques, by creating [[tape loop]]s of an individually struck piano string and individual test [[oscillation|oscillators]] and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of [[Doctor Who (season 17)|season 17]] (1979\u201380). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of [[Magnetic tape sound recording|analogue tape]] containing recordings of a single plucked string, [[white noise]], and the simple [[harmonic]] waveforms of [[Tone generator|test-tone oscillators]], intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines. On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, \"Jeez, Delia, did I write that?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/36b860f1-b3d5-4fcc-acdc-c2e95fb99176|title=Surprising Facts about BBC Theme Tunes You've Heard Hundreds of Times|first=Phil|last=Hebblethwaite|date=29 June 2016|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=12 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725043928/https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/36b860f1-b3d5-4fcc-acdc-c2e95fb99176|archive-date=25 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Although Grainer was willing to give Derbyshire the co-composer credit, it was against BBC policy at the time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pidd|first1=Helen|title=Doctor Who theme's co-creator honoured with posthumous PhD|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/20/delia-derbyshire-doctor-who-theme-co-creator-posthumous-phd|website=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=31 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228115219/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/20/delia-derbyshire-doctor-who-theme-co-creator-posthumous-phd|archive-date=28 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Ben|title=Doctor Who theme co-composer honoured with posthumous PhD|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2017-11-21/doctor-who-theme-co-composer-honoured-delia-derbyshire-honorary-phd/|website=Radio Times|publisher=Immediate Media Company Ltd|accessdate=31 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101030501/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2017-11-21/doctor-who-theme-co-composer-honoured-delia-derbyshire-honorary-phd/|archive-date=1 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA different arrangement was recorded by [[Peter Howell (musician)|Peter Howell]] for [[Doctor Who (season 18)|season 18]] (1980), which was in turn replaced by [[Dominic Glynn]]'s arrangement for the season-long serial ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' in [[Doctor Who (season 23)|season 23]] (1986).

Other composers in this early period included [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Carey Blyton]] and [[Geoffrey Burgon]].\n\nThe most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was [[Dudley Simpson]], who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for ''[[Blake's 7]]'', and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of ''[[The Tomorrow People]]''. Simpson's first ''Doctor Who'' score was ''[[Planet of Giants]]'' (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' (1979). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' (as a [[Music hall]] conductor).\n\nIn 1980 starting with the serial ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop.

Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on [[LP record]]; ''[[Doctor Who and the Pescatons]]'' featuring the Fourth Doctor.  The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story ''[[State of Decay]]'' in 1981. In 1988, during a hiatus in the television show, ''[[Slipback]]'', the first radio drama, was transmitted.\n\nSince 1999, [[Big Finish Productions]] has released several different series of Doctor Who audios on CD.  The earliest of these featured the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors, with Paul McGann's Eight Doctor joining the line in 2001.  Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor began appearing for Big Finish in 2012.  Along with the main range, adventures of the First, Second and Third Doctors have been produced in both limited cast and full cast formats, as well as audiobooks.  The 2013 series ''[[Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctor|Destiny of the Doctor]]'', produced as part of the series' 50th Anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show. Along with this, in May 2016 the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, appeared alongside Catherine Tate in a collection of three audio adventures.\n\nIn addition to these main lines, both the BBC and Big Finish have produced original audio dramas and audiobooks based on spin-off material, such as ''Torchwood'' and ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' series.\n\n===Books===\n{{See also|List of Doctor Who novelists}}\n\n''Doctor Who'' books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day.

Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by [[BBC Books]]. Numerous non-fiction books about the series, including guidebooks and critical studies, have also been published, and a dedicated ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' with newsstand circulation has been published regularly since 1979.

From his early days Nandalal began taking an interest in modelling images and later, decorating Puja pandals.\n\nIn 1898, at the age of fifteen, Nandalal moved to Calcutta for his high school studies in the Central Collegiate School. After clearing his examinations in 1902, he continued his college studies at the same institution. In June 1903 he married Sudhiradevi, the daughter of a family friend. Nanadalal wanted to study art, but he was not given permission by his family. Unable to qualify for promotion in his classes, Nandalal moved to other colleges, joining the Presidency College in 1905 to study commerce.

He had become part of an international circle of artists and writers seeking to revive classical Indian culture; a circle that already included [[Okakura Kakuz\u014d]], [[William Rothenstein]], [[Yokoyama Taikan]], [[Christiana Herringham]], [[Laurence Binyon]], [[Abanindranath Tagore]], and the seminal London Modernist sculptors [[Eric Gill]] and [[Jacob Epstein]].<ref>[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modernism-modernity/summary/v018/18.1.arrowsmith.html Rupert Richard Arrowsmith, \"The Transcultural Roots of Modernism: Imagist Poetry, Japanese Visual Culture, and the Western Museum System\"], ''[[Modernism/modernity]]'' Volume 18, Number 1, January 2011, 27\u201342. {{ISSN|1071-6068}}.</ref><ref>[http://vimeo.com/arrowsmith/cosmopolitanism-and-modernism Video of a Lecture mentioning Bose in the context of Indian influences n global modernism], ''[[London University School of Advanced Study]]'', March 2012.</ref>\n\nTo mark the 1930 occasion of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s [[History of the British salt tax in India#Mahatma Gandhi and the salt tax|arrest for protesting the British tax on salt]], Bose created a black on white linocut print of Gandhi walking with a staff. It became the iconic image for the non-violence movement.\n\nHis genius and original style were recognised by famous artists and art critics like [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] and [[O. C. Ganguli]]. These lovers of art felt that objective criticism was necessary for the development of painting and founded the Indian Society of Oriental Art.\n\nHe became principal of the Kala Bhavana (College of Arts) at Tagore's International University [[Santiniketan]] in 1922.\n\nHe was also famously asked by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] to sketch the emblems for the Government of India's awards, including the [[Bharat Ratna]] and the [[Padma Shri]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Nandalal Bose paintings on display in U.S.  |url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/03/15/stories/2008031556021400.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=15 March 2008 }}</ref> Along with his disciple [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha|Rammanohar]], Nandalal Bose took up the historic task of beautifying/decorating the original manuscript of the [[Constitution of India]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2672/ | title=The Constitution of India | accessdate=9 December 2010 | date=7 May 2009 | publisher=World Digital Library}}</ref>\n\nHe died on 16 April 1966 in Calcutta.\n\nToday, the [[National Gallery of Modern Art]] in Delhi holds 7000 of his works in its collection, including a 1930 black and white [[linocut]] of the [[Dandi March]] depicting Mahatma Gandhi, and a set of seven posters he later made at the request of Mahatma Gandhi for the 1938 [[Haripura]] Session of the [[Indian National Congress]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Bengal School of Art exhibition to open in US|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-06-24/news/28438579_1_art-exhibition-darielle-mason-bengal-school |publisher=[[The Economic Times]] |date=24 June 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==His place in Indian Art==\n\nIn his introduction for the [[Christie's]] catalogue, [[R.

Havell]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]], [[Okakura Kakuzo]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]] into a unique and unified programme for the creation of a new art movement in India. And like [[Durer]] he combined a passion bordering on devotion with an irrepressible analytical mind that compelled him to prise open different art traditions and unravel their syntactic logic, and make them accessible to a new generation of Indian artists.

After clearing his examinations in 1902, he continued his college studies at the same institution. In June 1903 he married Sudhiradevi, the daughter of a family friend. Nanadalal wanted to study art, but he was not given permission by his family. Unable to qualify for promotion in his classes, Nandalal moved to other colleges, joining the Presidency College in 1905 to study commerce.

It became the iconic image for the non-violence movement.\n\nHis genius and original style were recognised by famous artists and art critics like [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] and [[O. C. Ganguli]]. These lovers of art felt that objective criticism was necessary for the development of painting and founded the Indian Society of Oriental Art.\n\nHe became principal of the Kala Bhavana (College of Arts) at Tagore's International University [[Santiniketan]] in 1922.\n\nHe was also famously asked by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] to sketch the emblems for the Government of India's awards, including the [[Bharat Ratna]] and the [[Padma Shri]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Nandalal Bose paintings on display in U.S.  |url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/03/15/stories/2008031556021400.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=15 March 2008 }}</ref> Along with his disciple [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha|Rammanohar]], Nandalal Bose took up the historic task of beautifying/decorating the original manuscript of the [[Constitution of India]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2672/ | title=The Constitution of India | accessdate=9 December 2010 | date=7 May 2009 | publisher=World Digital Library}}</ref>\n\nHe died on 16 April 1966 in Calcutta.\n\nToday, the [[National Gallery of Modern Art]] in Delhi holds 7000 of his works in its collection, including a 1930 black and white [[linocut]] of the [[Dandi March]] depicting Mahatma Gandhi, and a set of seven posters he later made at the request of Mahatma Gandhi for the 1938 [[Haripura]] Session of the [[Indian National Congress]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Bengal School of Art exhibition to open in US|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-06-24/news/28438579_1_art-exhibition-darielle-mason-bengal-school |publisher=[[The Economic Times]] |date=24 June 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==His place in Indian Art==\n\nIn his introduction for the [[Christie's]] catalogue, [[R.

The [[pelagic zone]] includes all open ocean regions, and can be divided into further regions categorized by depth and light abundance. The [[photic zone]] includes the oceans from the surface to a depth of 200&nbsp;m; it is the region where photosynthesis can occur and is, therefore, the most [[biodiverse]]. Because plants require [[photosynthesis]], life found deeper than the photic zone must either rely on material sinking from above (see [[marine snow]]) or find another energy source. [[Hydrothermal vents]] are the primary source of energy in what is known as the [[aphotic zone]] (depths exceeding 200&nbsp;m). The pelagic part of the [[photic zone]] is known as the [[epipelagic]].\n\nThe pelagic part of the aphotic zone can be further divided into vertical regions according to temperature.\nThe [[mesopelagic]] is the uppermost region. Its lowermost boundary is at a [[thermocline]] of {{convert|12|C|F}}, which, in the [[tropics]] generally lies at {{convert|700|-|1000|m|ft|sp=us}}. Next is the [[bathypelagic]] lying between {{convert|10|and|4|C|F}}, typically between {{convert|700|-|1000|m|ft|sp=us}} and {{convert|2000|-|4000|m|ft|sp=us}}, lying along the top of the [[abyssal plain]] is the [[abyssal zone|abyssopelagic]], whose lower boundary lies at about {{convert|6000|m|ft|sp=us}}. The last zone includes the deep [[oceanic trench]], and is known as the [[hadal zone|hadalpelagic]]. This lies between {{convert|6000|-|11000|m|ft|sp=us}} and is the deepest oceanic zone.\n\nThe [[benthic]] zones are aphotic and correspond to the three deepest zones of the [[deep-sea]]. The [[bathyal zone]] covers the continental slope down to about {{convert|4000|m|ft|sp=us}}. The abyssal zone covers the abyssal plains between 4,000 and 6,000&nbsp;m. Lastly, the [[hadal]] zone corresponds to the hadalpelagic zone, which is found in oceanic trenches.\n\nThe pelagic zone can be further subdivided into two subregions: the [[neritic zone]] and the [[oceanic zone]]. The neritic zone encompasses the water mass directly above the [[continental shelves]] whereas the oceanic zone includes all the completely open water.\n\nIn contrast, the [[littoral zone]] covers the region between low and high tide and represents the transitional area between marine and terrestrial conditions. It is also known as the [[intertidal]] zone because it is the area where tide level affects the conditions of the region.\n\nIf a zone undergoes dramatic changes in temperature with depth, it contains a [[thermocline]]. The tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes. Polar waters, which receive relatively little solar energy, are not stratified by temperature and generally lack a thermocline because surface water at polar latitudes are nearly as cold as water at greater depths. Below the thermocline, water is very cold, ranging from \u22121&nbsp;\u00b0C to 3&nbsp;\u00b0C. Because this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water, the average temperature of the world ocean is 3.9&nbsp;\u00b0C. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\nIf a zone undergoes dramatic changes in salinity with depth, it contains a [[halocline]]. If a zone undergoes a strong, vertical chemistry gradient with depth, it contains a [[chemocline]].\n\nThe halocline often coincides with the thermocline, and the combination produces a pronounced pycnocline.\n\n=== Exploration ===\n[[File:Ocean gravity map.gif|right|thumb|upright=1.6|Map of large underwater features (1995, [[NOAA]])|alt=False color photo]]\n\nThe deepest point in the ocean is the [[Mariana Trench]], located in the Pacific Ocean near the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. Its maximum depth has been estimated to be {{convert|10971|m|ft|sp=us}} (plus or minus 11 meters; see the [[Mariana Trench]] article for discussion of the various estimates of the maximum depth.) The British naval vessel ''Challenger II'' surveyed the trench in 1951 and named the deepest part of the trench the \"[[Challenger Deep]]\". In 1960, the [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste]] successfully reached the bottom of the trench, manned by a crew of two men.\n\n=== Oceanic maritime currents ===\n[[File:Ocean currents 1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Oceanic surface currents (U.S. Army, 1943).]]\n[[File:M2 tidal constituent.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Amphidromic points showing the direction of [[tides]] per incrementation periods along with resonating directions of wavelength movements.]]\n\nOceanic maritime currents have different origins. Tidal currents are in phase with the [[tide]], hence are [[Quasiperiodicity|quasiperiodic]]; they may form various knots in certain places,{{clarify|date=September 2017}} most notably around [[Cape (geography)|headlands]]. Non-periodic currents have for origin the waves, wind and different densities.\n\nThe [[wind]] and [[wave]]s create surface currents (designated as \u201cdrift currents\u201d). These currents can decompose in one quasi-permanent current (which varies within the hourly scale) and one movement of [[Stokes drift]] under the effect of rapid waves movement (at the echelon of a couple of seconds).).<ref>\u00c9tude de la d\u00e9rive \u00e0 la surface sous l\u2019effet du vent, ''Observation and estimation of Lagrangian, Stokes and Eulerian currents induced by wind and waves at the sea surface'', F. Ardhuin, L. Mari\u00e9, N. Rascle, P. Forget, and A. Roland, 2009: J. Phys. Oceanogr., vol. 39, n\u00b0 11, pp. 2820\u20132838.</ref> The quasi-permanent current is accelerated by the breaking of waves, and in a lesser governing effect, by the friction of the wind on the surface.<ref>Mesure de l\u2019effet de frottement \u00e0 la surface de la mer, \"Tangential stress beneath wind-driven air-water interfaces\", M. L. Banner and W. L. Peirson, ''J. Fluid Mech.'', vol. 364, pp. 115\u2013145, 1998.</ref>\n\nThis acceleration of the current takes place in the direction of waves and dominant wind. Accordingly, when the sea depth increases, the [[Earth's rotation|rotation]] of the [[earth]] changes the direction of currents in proportion with the increase of depth, while friction lowers their speed. At a certain sea depth, the current changes direction and is seen inverted in the opposite direction with current speed becoming null: known as the [[Ekman spiral]]. The influence of these currents is mainly experienced at the mixed layer of the ocean surface, often from 400 to 800 meters of maximum depth. These currents can considerably alter, change and are dependent on the various yearly seasons. If the mixed layer is less thick (10 to 20 meters), the quasi-permanent current at the surface adopts an extreme oblique direction in relation to the direction of the wind, becoming virtually homogeneous, until the [[Thermocline]].<ref>Courants mesur\u00e9s pr\u00e8s de la surface, ''The drift current from observations made on the bouee laboratoire'', Joseph Gonella, 1971: Cahiers Oc\u00e9anographiques, vol. 23, pp. 1\u201315.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Deep sea|deep]] however, maritime currents are caused by the temperature gradients and the [[salinity]] between water density masses.\n\nIn [[littoral zone]]s, [[breaking wave]]s are so intense and the depth measurement so low, that maritime currents reach often 1 to 2 knots.\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Thermohaline Circulation 2.png|A map of the global thermohaline circulation; blue represent deep-water currents, whereas red represent surface currents|thumb|upright=0.9|left |alt=World map with colored, directed lines showing how water moves through the oceans. Cold deep water rises and warms in the central Pacific and in the Indian, whereas warm water sinks and cools near Greenland in the North Atlantic and near Antarctica in the South Atlantic.]]\n\n[[Ocean current]]s greatly affect Earth's [[climate]] by transferring heat from the tropics to the [[polar regions]]. Transferring warm or cold air and [[precipitation]] to coastal regions, winds may carry them inland. Surface heat and freshwater [[flux]]es create global [[density gradient]]s that drive the [[thermohaline circulation]] part of large-scale ocean circulation. It plays an important role in supplying heat to the polar regions, and thus in sea ice regulation. Changes in the thermohaline circulation are thought to have significant impacts on [[Earth's energy budget]]. In so far as the thermohaline circulation governs the rate at which deep waters reach the surface, it may also significantly influence atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] concentrations.\n\nFor a discussion of the possibilities of changes to the thermohaline circulation under [[global warming]], see [[shutdown of thermohaline circulation]].\n\nThe [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] encircles that continent, influencing the area's climate and connecting currents in several oceans.\n\nOne of the most dramatic forms of [[weather]] occurs over the oceans: [[tropical cyclone]]s (also called \"typhoons\" and \"hurricanes\" depending upon where the system forms).\n\n=== Biology ===\n{{further|Marine biology|Marine life}}\n\nThe ocean has a significant effect on the [[biosphere]]. Oceanic [[evaporation]], as a phase of the [[water cycle]], is the source of most rainfall, and ocean temperatures determine [[climate]] and [[wind]] patterns that affect life on land. Life within the ocean [[evolution|evolved]] 3 billion years prior to life on land. Both the depth and the distance from shore strongly influence the [[biodiversity]] of the plants and animals present in each region.<ref name=\"bcc.34\">{{cite book |title=Biology: Concepts & Connections |chapter=Chapter 34: The Biosphere: An Introduction to Earth's Diverse Environment |at=section 34.7 |date= |chapter-url=http://wps.aw.com/bc_campbell_concepts_7_oa/215/55135/14114612.cw/-/t/index.html}}</ref>\n\nAs it is thought that life evolved in the ocean, the diversity of life is immense, including:\n* [[Bacteria]] : ubiquitous single-celled [[prokaryotes]] found throughout the world\n* [[Archaea]] : [[prokaryotes]] distinct from bacteria, that inhabit many environments of the ocean, as well as many [[extremophile|extreme environments]]\n* [[Algae]] : algae is a \"catch-all\" term to include many [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]], [[protist|single-celled]] [[eukaryote]]s, such as [[green algae]], [[diatom]]s, and [[dinoflagellates]], but also multicellular algae, such as some [[red algae]] (including organisms like [[Pyropia]], which is the source of the edible [[nori]] seaweed), and [[brown algae]] (including organisms like [[kelp]]).\n* [[Plants]] : including [[seagrass|sea grasses]], or [[mangroves]]\n* [[Fungi]] : many [[marine fungi]] with diverse roles are found in oceanic environments\n* [[Animals]] : most animal [[phylum|phyla]] have species that inhabit the ocean, including many that are only found in marine environments such as [[Porifera|sponges]], [[Cnidaria]] (such as [[coral]]s and [[jellyfish]]), [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]], [[Brachiopod]]s, and [[Echinoderm]]s (such as [[sea urchin]]s and [[sea star]]s). Many other familiar animal groups primarily live in the ocean, including [[cephalopod]]s (includes [[octopus]] and [[squid]]), [[crustacean]]s (includes [[lobster]]s, [[crab]]s, and [[shrimp]]), [[fish]], [[sharks]], [[cetacean]]s (includes [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s, and [[porpoise]]s).\n\nIn addition, many land animals have adapted to living a major part of their life on the oceans. For instance, [[seabirds]] are a diverse group of birds that have adapted to a life mainly on the oceans. They feed on marine animals and spend most of their lifetime on water, many only going on land for breeding. Other birds that have adapted to oceans as their living space are [[penguin]]s, [[Gull|seagulls]] and [[Pelecaniformes|pelicans]]. Seven species of turtles, the [[sea turtle]]s, also spend most of their time in the oceans.\n\n=== Gases ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|+Characteristics of oceanic gases <ref name=\"soest.OCN623\">{{cite web |url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/courses/OCN623/Spring2012/Non_CO2_gases.pdf |title=Dissolved Gases other than Carbon Dioxide in Seawater |publisher=soest.hawaii.edu|accessdate=2014-05-05 }}</ref><ref name=\"uiuc.L23\">{{cite web |url=http://butane.chem.uiuc.edu/pshapley/GenChem1/L23/web-L23.pdf |title= Dissolved Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide|website= |publisher= chem.uiuc.edu|date= }}</ref><ref name=\"sea.water\">{{cite web |first=Floor |last=Anthoni |url=http://www.seafriends.org.nz/oceano/seawater.htm |title=Composition of seawater |publisher=Seafriends.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2014-05-05 }}</ref>\n|-\n!

The only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface [[liquids]] are the [[lakes of Titan]], although there is evidence for the existence of oceans elsewhere in the [[Solar System]]. Early in their geologic histories, [[Mars]] and [[Venus]] are theorized to have had large water oceans. The [[Mars ocean hypothesis]] suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered by water, and a [[runaway greenhouse effect]] may have boiled away the global ocean of Venus. Compounds such as [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] and [[ammonia]] dissolved in water lower its freezing point so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting [[ice]]. Unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many [[dwarf planets]] and natural satellites; notably, the ocean of the moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] is estimated to have over twice the water volume of Earth. The Solar System's [[giant planet]]s are also thought to have liquid [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] layers of yet to be confirmed compositions.

The [[pelagic zone]] includes all open ocean regions, and can be divided into further regions categorized by depth and light abundance. The [[photic zone]] includes the oceans from the surface to a depth of 200&nbsp;m; it is the region where photosynthesis can occur and is, therefore, the most [[biodiverse]]. Because plants require [[photosynthesis]], life found deeper than the photic zone must either rely on material sinking from above (see [[marine snow]]) or find another energy source. [[Hydrothermal vents]] are the primary source of energy in what is known as the [[aphotic zone]] (depths exceeding 200&nbsp;m). The pelagic part of the [[photic zone]] is known as the [[epipelagic]].\n\nThe pelagic part of the aphotic zone can be further divided into vertical regions according to temperature.\nThe [[mesopelagic]] is the uppermost region. Its lowermost boundary is at a [[thermocline]] of {{convert|12|C|F}}, which, in the [[tropics]] generally lies at {{convert|700|-|1000|m|ft|sp=us}}. Next is the [[bathypelagic]] lying between {{convert|10|and|4|C|F}}, typically between {{convert|700|-|1000|m|ft|sp=us}} and {{convert|2000|-|4000|m|ft|sp=us}}, lying along the top of the [[abyssal plain]] is the [[abyssal zone|abyssopelagic]], whose lower boundary lies at about {{convert|6000|m|ft|sp=us}}. The last zone includes the deep [[oceanic trench]], and is known as the [[hadal zone|hadalpelagic]]. This lies between {{convert|6000|-|11000|m|ft|sp=us}} and is the deepest oceanic zone.\n\nThe [[benthic]] zones are aphotic and correspond to the three deepest zones of the [[deep-sea]]. The [[bathyal zone]] covers the continental slope down to about {{convert|4000|m|ft|sp=us}}. The abyssal zone covers the abyssal plains between 4,000 and 6,000&nbsp;m. Lastly, the [[hadal]] zone corresponds to the hadalpelagic zone, which is found in oceanic trenches.\n\nThe pelagic zone can be further subdivided into two subregions: the [[neritic zone]] and the [[oceanic zone]]. The neritic zone encompasses the water mass directly above the [[continental shelves]] whereas the oceanic zone includes all the completely open water.\n\nIn contrast, the [[littoral zone]] covers the region between low and high tide and represents the transitional area between marine and terrestrial conditions. It is also known as the [[intertidal]] zone because it is the area where tide level affects the conditions of the region.\n\nIf a zone undergoes dramatic changes in temperature with depth, it contains a [[thermocline]]. The tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes. Polar waters, which receive relatively little solar energy, are not stratified by temperature and generally lack a thermocline because surface water at polar latitudes are nearly as cold as water at greater depths. Below the thermocline, water is very cold, ranging from \u22121&nbsp;\u00b0C to 3&nbsp;\u00b0C. Because this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water, the average temperature of the world ocean is 3.9&nbsp;\u00b0C. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\nIf a zone undergoes dramatic changes in salinity with depth, it contains a [[halocline]]. If a zone undergoes a strong, vertical chemistry gradient with depth, it contains a [[chemocline]].\n\nThe halocline often coincides with the thermocline, and the combination produces a pronounced pycnocline.\n\n=== Exploration ===\n[[File:Ocean gravity map.gif|right|thumb|upright=1.6|Map of large underwater features (1995, [[NOAA]])|alt=False color photo]]\n\nThe deepest point in the ocean is the [[Mariana Trench]], located in the Pacific Ocean near the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. Its maximum depth has been estimated to be {{convert|10971|m|ft|sp=us}} (plus or minus 11 meters; see the [[Mariana Trench]] article for discussion of the various estimates of the maximum depth.) The British naval vessel ''Challenger II'' surveyed the trench in 1951 and named the deepest part of the trench the \"[[Challenger Deep]]\". In 1960, the [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste]] successfully reached the bottom of the trench, manned by a crew of two men.\n\n=== Oceanic maritime currents ===\n[[File:Ocean currents 1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Oceanic surface currents (U.S. Army, 1943).]]\n[[File:M2 tidal constituent.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Amphidromic points showing the direction of [[tides]] per incrementation periods along with resonating directions of wavelength movements.]]\n\nOceanic maritime currents have different origins. Tidal currents are in phase with the [[tide]], hence are [[Quasiperiodicity|quasiperiodic]]; they may form various knots in certain places,{{clarify|date=September 2017}} most notably around [[Cape (geography)|headlands]]. Non-periodic currents have for origin the waves, wind and different densities.\n\nThe [[wind]] and [[wave]]s create surface currents (designated as \u201cdrift currents\u201d). These currents can decompose in one quasi-permanent current (which varies within the hourly scale) and one movement of [[Stokes drift]] under the effect of rapid waves movement (at the echelon of a couple of seconds).).<ref>\u00c9tude de la d\u00e9rive \u00e0 la surface sous l\u2019effet du vent, ''Observation and estimation of Lagrangian, Stokes and Eulerian currents induced by wind and waves at the sea surface'', F. Ardhuin, L. Mari\u00e9, N. Rascle, P. Forget, and A. Roland, 2009: J. Phys. Oceanogr., vol. 39, n\u00b0 11, pp. 2820\u20132838.</ref> The quasi-permanent current is accelerated by the breaking of waves, and in a lesser governing effect, by the friction of the wind on the surface.<ref>Mesure de l\u2019effet de frottement \u00e0 la surface de la mer, \"Tangential stress beneath wind-driven air-water interfaces\", M. L. Banner and W. L. Peirson, ''J. Fluid Mech.'', vol. 364, pp. 115\u2013145, 1998.</ref>\n\nThis acceleration of the current takes place in the direction of waves and dominant wind. Accordingly, when the sea depth increases, the [[Earth's rotation|rotation]] of the [[earth]] changes the direction of currents in proportion with the increase of depth, while friction lowers their speed. At a certain sea depth, the current changes direction and is seen inverted in the opposite direction with current speed becoming null: known as the [[Ekman spiral]]. The influence of these currents is mainly experienced at the mixed layer of the ocean surface, often from 400 to 800 meters of maximum depth. These currents can considerably alter, change and are dependent on the various yearly seasons. If the mixed layer is less thick (10 to 20 meters), the quasi-permanent current at the surface adopts an extreme oblique direction in relation to the direction of the wind, becoming virtually homogeneous, until the [[Thermocline]].<ref>Courants mesur\u00e9s pr\u00e8s de la surface, ''The drift current from observations made on the bouee laboratoire'', Joseph Gonella, 1971: Cahiers Oc\u00e9anographiques, vol. 23, pp. 1\u201315.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Deep sea|deep]] however, maritime currents are caused by the temperature gradients and the [[salinity]] between water density masses.\n\nIn [[littoral zone]]s, [[breaking wave]]s are so intense and the depth measurement so low, that maritime currents reach often 1 to 2 knots.\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Thermohaline Circulation 2.png|A map of the global thermohaline circulation; blue represent deep-water currents, whereas red represent surface currents|thumb|upright=0.9|left |alt=World map with colored, directed lines showing how water moves through the oceans. Cold deep water rises and warms in the central Pacific and in the Indian, whereas warm water sinks and cools near Greenland in the North Atlantic and near Antarctica in the South Atlantic.]]\n\n[[Ocean current]]s greatly affect Earth's [[climate]] by transferring heat from the tropics to the [[polar regions]]. Transferring warm or cold air and [[precipitation]] to coastal regions, winds may carry them inland. Surface heat and freshwater [[flux]]es create global [[density gradient]]s that drive the [[thermohaline circulation]] part of large-scale ocean circulation. It plays an important role in supplying heat to the polar regions, and thus in sea ice regulation. Changes in the thermohaline circulation are thought to have significant impacts on [[Earth's energy budget]]. In so far as the thermohaline circulation governs the rate at which deep waters reach the surface, it may also significantly influence atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] concentrations.\n\nFor a discussion of the possibilities of changes to the thermohaline circulation under [[global warming]], see [[shutdown of thermohaline circulation]].\n\nThe [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] encircles that continent, influencing the area's climate and connecting currents in several oceans.\n\nOne of the most dramatic forms of [[weather]] occurs over the oceans: [[tropical cyclone]]s (also called \"typhoons\" and \"hurricanes\" depending upon where the system forms).\n\n=== Biology ===\n{{further|Marine biology|Marine life}}\n\nThe ocean has a significant effect on the [[biosphere]]. Oceanic [[evaporation]], as a phase of the [[water cycle]], is the source of most rainfall, and ocean temperatures determine [[climate]] and [[wind]] patterns that affect life on land. Life within the ocean [[evolution|evolved]] 3 billion years prior to life on land. Both the depth and the distance from shore strongly influence the [[biodiversity]] of the plants and animals present in each region.<ref name=\"bcc.34\">{{cite book |title=Biology: Concepts & Connections |chapter=Chapter 34: The Biosphere: An Introduction to Earth's Diverse Environment |at=section 34.7 |date= |chapter-url=http://wps.aw.com/bc_campbell_concepts_7_oa/215/55135/14114612.cw/-/t/index.html}}</ref>\n\nAs it is thought that life evolved in the ocean, the diversity of life is immense, including:\n* [[Bacteria]] : ubiquitous single-celled [[prokaryotes]] found throughout the world\n* [[Archaea]] : [[prokaryotes]] distinct from bacteria, that inhabit many environments of the ocean, as well as many [[extremophile|extreme environments]]\n* [[Algae]] : algae is a \"catch-all\" term to include many [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]], [[protist|single-celled]] [[eukaryote]]s, such as [[green algae]], [[diatom]]s, and [[dinoflagellates]], but also multicellular algae, such as some [[red algae]] (including organisms like [[Pyropia]], which is the source of the edible [[nori]] seaweed), and [[brown algae]] (including organisms like [[kelp]]).\n* [[Plants]] : including [[seagrass|sea grasses]], or [[mangroves]]\n* [[Fungi]] : many [[marine fungi]] with diverse roles are found in oceanic environments\n* [[Animals]] : most animal [[phylum|phyla]] have species that inhabit the ocean, including many that are only found in marine environments such as [[Porifera|sponges]], [[Cnidaria]] (such as [[coral]]s and [[jellyfish]]), [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]], [[Brachiopod]]s, and [[Echinoderm]]s (such as [[sea urchin]]s and [[sea star]]s). Many other familiar animal groups primarily live in the ocean, including [[cephalopod]]s (includes [[octopus]] and [[squid]]), [[crustacean]]s (includes [[lobster]]s, [[crab]]s, and [[shrimp]]), [[fish]], [[sharks]], [[cetacean]]s (includes [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s, and [[porpoise]]s).\n\nIn addition, many land animals have adapted to living a major part of their life on the oceans. For instance, [[seabirds]] are a diverse group of birds that have adapted to a life mainly on the oceans. They feed on marine animals and spend most of their lifetime on water, many only going on land for breeding. Other birds that have adapted to oceans as their living space are [[penguin]]s, [[Gull|seagulls]] and [[Pelecaniformes|pelicans]]. Seven species of turtles, the [[sea turtle]]s, also spend most of their time in the oceans.\n\n=== Gases ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|+Characteristics of oceanic gases <ref name=\"soest.OCN623\">{{cite web |url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/courses/OCN623/Spring2012/Non_CO2_gases.pdf |title=Dissolved Gases other than Carbon Dioxide in Seawater |publisher=soest.hawaii.edu|accessdate=2014-05-05 }}</ref><ref name=\"uiuc.L23\">{{cite web |url=http://butane.chem.uiuc.edu/pshapley/GenChem1/L23/web-L23.pdf |title= Dissolved Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide|website= |publisher= chem.uiuc.edu|date= }}</ref><ref name=\"sea.water\">{{cite web |first=Floor |last=Anthoni |url=http://www.seafriends.org.nz/oceano/seawater.htm |title=Composition of seawater |publisher=Seafriends.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2014-05-05 }}</ref>\n|-\n!
