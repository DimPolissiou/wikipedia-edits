The band was named after the movie [[Deranged (1974 film)|Deranged]]\n\n==History==\nFormed in 1991, Deranged is a very peculiar band in the Swedish scene: unlike bands such as [[Grave (band)|Grave]], [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]] and [[Dismember (band)|Dismember]], Deranged does not have the Swedish sound and plays a very fast and technical deathgrind with several groove influences. Draw inspirations from [[Cannibal Corpse]], [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]], [[Morbid Angel]], [[Suffocation (band)|Suffocation]] and [[Napalm Death]], the band is better associated with U.S death metal.\n\nThe band have released the singles ''The Confessions of a Necrophile'' -title directly extracted of the movie- (1992) and ''Upon the Medical Slab'' (1994), the EP's ''The Confessions Continue'' (1993), ''Architects of Perversions'' (1994) and ''Sculpture of the Dead'' (1996) and the albums ''Rated X'' (1995), ''High on Blood'' (1998), ''III'' (2000), ''Deranged'' (2001), ''Plainfield Cemetery'' (2002), ''Obscenities in B-Flat'' (2006), ''The Redlight Murder Case'' (2008) and ''Cut, Carve, Rip, Serve'' (2011). Also, in 2001 the band did a split with [[Abscess (band)|Abscess]]\n\nThroughout the years, the band suffered several drastic changes in the line-up and in November 2007, the original members was Rikard Werm\u00e9n (drums) and Axel Johansson (guitar). In March 2008, Werm\u00e9n left the band, which disbanded in July after several problems between Axelsson and Martin Sch\u00f6nherr. The band was resurrected in the summer of 2009, with Werm\u00e9n and Sch\u00f6nherr with their original duties, but with Thomas Ahlgren (former in the bass) in the guitar because Axelsson not was there, and with Andreas Johansson in the bass. After some festival gigs across Europe and a short Russian tour, the band returned to Berno Studio in February 2011, to record the \"come-back\" album ''Cut Carve Rip Serve'', which was released via the U.S label Sevared Records.\n\nIn August 2011, Sch\u00f6nherr left the band, leaving Ahlgren to handle the vocals for a second Russian tour and the [[Rock In Solo]] festival in Indonesia. The following year, the band played in their first national show after 2007; also, the band announced the arrival of a new vocalist, Anders Johansson (ex- Vomitous).\n\n==Discography==\n* ''The Confessions of a Necrophile'' (demo, 1992)\n* ''...The Confessions Continues'' (EP. 1993)\n* ''Upon the Medical Slab'' (demo, 1994)\n* ''Architects of Perversions'' (EP, 1994)\n* ''Rated X'' (full-length, 1995)\n* ''Sculpture of the Dead'' (EP, 1996)\n* ''High on Blood'' (full-length, 1998)\n* ''III'' (full-length, 2000)\n* ''[[Abscess (band)|Abscess]]/Deranged'' (split, 2001)\n* ''Deranged'' (full-length, 2001)\n* ''Plainfield Cemetery'' (full-length, 2002)\n* ''Obscenities in B-Flat'' (full-length, 2006)\n* ''The Redlight Murder Case'' (full-length, 2008)\n* ''Cut, Carve, Rip, Sevre'' (full-length, 2011)\n* ''Morgue Orgy'' (EP, 2013)\n* ''Struck by a Murderous Siege'' (full-length, 2016)\n* ''Deeds of Ruthless'' (full-length, 2020)\n\n==Members==\n\n===Current===\n* Thomas Ahlgren (guitar)\n* Rikard Werm\u00e9n (drums)\n* Andreas Johansson (bass)\n* Anders Johansson (vocals)\n\n===Past===\n* J\u00f6rgen Byllander (bass)\n* Dan Bengtsson (bass, 1997)\n* Mikael Westerdahl (guitar, 1991\u201393)\n* Johan Axelsson (guitars, 1991-2008)\n* Calle F\u00e4ldt (bass/vocals, 2002-2007)\n* Roger Johansson (backing voice, 2001-2002)\n* Johan Anderberg (bass/guitar/vocals, 2000-2001)\n* Fredrick Sandberg (vocals, 1996\u201399)\n* Andreas Debl\u00e8n (vocals)\n* [[Per Gyllenb\u00e4ck]] (vocals, 1991\u201396)\n* Mikael Bergman (bass, 1994\u201395)\n* Martin Sch\u00f6nherr (vocals)\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Deranged/1036 Encyclopaedia Metallum enter]\n* [http://myspace.com/stabandhack Official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.iamderanged.com Former website (Archive)]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Swedish death metal musical groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1991]]\n[[Category:Musical quartets]]\n[[Category:Deathgrind musical groups]]\n[[Category:1991 establishments in Sweden]]\n[[Category:Sevared Records artists]]\n[[Category:Listenable Records artists]]\n[[Category:Regain Records artists]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox musical artist  <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians -->\n| name                = Deranged\n| image                 = \n| caption            = \n| image_size            = <!-- Only for images narrower than 220 pixels -->\n| background          = group_or_band\n| alias               = \n| origin              = [[Hj\u00e4rup]], [[Sweden]]\n| instrument          = \n| genre               = [[Death metal]], [[grindcore]]\n| occupation          = \n| years_active        = 1991\u20132008, 2009\u2013present\n| label               = [[Sevared Records]]\n| associated_acts     = \n| website                 = [http://myspace.com/stabandhack myspace.com/stabandhack]\n| current_members     = Rikard Werm\u00e9n<br />Thomas Ahlgren<br />Andreas Johansson<br />Anders Johansson\n| past_members        = Calle F\u00e4ldt<br />Roger Johansson<br />Johan Anderberg<br />Fredrick Sandberg<br />Andreas Debl\u00e8n<br />Per Gyllenb\u00e4ck<br />Mikael Bergman<br />Dan Bengsston<br /> Martin Sch\u00f6nherr\n}}\n'''Deranged''' is a Swedish death metal band formed in 1991.
