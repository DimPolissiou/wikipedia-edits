Named after Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], the architect of the [[Imperial German Navy|''Kaiserliche Marine'']] (Imperial Navy), the ship was laid down at the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven]] in November 1936 and her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was launched two and a half years later. Work was completed in February 1941, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Like her sister ship {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}}, ''Tirpitz'' was armed with a main battery of eight {{convert|38|cm|adj=on}} [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|guns]] in four twin [[Gun turret|turrets]]. After a series of wartime modifications she was 2000 tonnes heavier than ''Bismarck'', making her the heaviest battleship ever built by a European navy.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}}\n\nAfter completing [[sea trial]]s in early 1941, ''Tirpitz'' briefly served as the centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was intended to prevent a possible break-out attempt by the [[Soviet Baltic Fleet#Great Patriotic War|Soviet Baltic Fleet]]. In early 1942, the ship sailed to Norway to act as a deterrent against an Allied invasion. While stationed in Norway, ''Tirpitz'' was also intended to be used to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, and two such missions were attempted in 1942. This was the only feasible role for her, since the [[St Nazaire Raid]] had made operations against the Atlantic convoy lanes too risky. ''Tirpitz'' acted as a [[fleet in being]], forcing the British [[Royal Navy]] to retain significant naval forces in the area to contain the battleship.{{sfn|Kemp|p=153}}\n\nIn September 1943, ''Tirpitz'', along with the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}, bombarded Allied positions on [[Spitzbergen (island)|Spitzbergen]], the only time the ship used her main battery in an offensive role. Shortly thereafter, the ship was damaged in [[Operation Source|an attack by British mini-submarines]] and subsequently subjected to a series of large-scale air raids. On 12 November 1944, British [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] equipped with {{convert|12000|lb|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|\"Tallboy\" bombs]] scored two direct hits and a near miss which caused the ship to [[capsize]] rapidly. A deck fire spread to the ammunition magazine for one of the main battery turrets, which caused a large explosion. Figures for the number of men killed in the attack range from 950 to 1,204. Between 1948 and 1957, the wreck was broken up by a joint Norwegian and German salvage operation.\n\n== Design ==\n{{main|Bismarck-class battleship}}\n\nThe two {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship}}s were designed in the mid-1930s by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' as a counter to French naval expansion, specifically the two {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|1}}s France had started in 1935. Laid down after the signing of the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935, ''Tirpitz'' and her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} were nominally within the {{convert|35000|LT|adj=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington regime]] that governed battleship construction in the [[interwar period]]. The ships secretly exceeded the figure by a wide margin, though before either vessel was completed, the international treaty system had fallen apart following Japan's withdrawal in 1937, allowing signatories to invoke an \"escalator clause\" that permitted displacements as high as {{convert|45000|LT}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=203\u2013208}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz-1.jpg|thumb|left|Recognition drawing prepared by the US Navy]]\n\n''Tirpitz'' [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|42900|t|LT|lk=on}} [[Standard displacement|as built]] and {{cvt|52600|t|LT}} [[Full-load displacement|fully loaded]], with a length of {{convert|251|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|10.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{efn|According to naval historians Gerhard Koop and Klaus-Peter Schmolke, ''Tirpitz'' displaced {{convert|53,500|t|LT}} at full load in 1944.{{sfn|Koop & Schmolke|p=18}}}} Her standard crew numbered 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted men; during the war this was increased to 108 officers and 2,500 men. She was powered by three [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving a [[screw propeller]], with steam provided by twelve oil-fired Wagner superheated [[water-tube boiler]]s. Her propulsion system developed a total of {{convert|163023|PS|shp kW|lk=on|abbr=on}} and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|30.8|kn}} on speed trials.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|pp=33, 35}}\n\nShe was armed with eight [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|38&nbsp;cm SK C/34]] L/52 guns arranged in four twin [[gun turret]]s: two [[superfire|superfiring]] turrets forward\u2014Anton and Bruno\u2014and two aft\u2014Caesar and Dora.{{efn|SK stands for ''Schiffskanone'' (ship's gun), C/34 stands for ''Constructionjahr'' (Construction year) 1934, and L/52 denotes the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibres]], meaning that the gun is 52 times long as it is in internal diameter.{{sfn|Campbell|p=219}}}} Her secondary armament consisted of twelve [[15 cm SK C/28|15&nbsp;cm L/55]] guns, sixteen [[10.5&nbsp;cm FlaK 38|10.5&nbsp;cm L/65]] and sixteen [[3.7 cm SK C/30|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on}}]] L/83, and initially twelve [[2 cm FlaK 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}} C/30]] anti-aircraft guns. The number of 2&nbsp;cm guns was eventually increased to 58. After 1942, eight {{convert|53.3|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} above-water [[torpedo tube]]s were installed in two quadruple mounts, one mount on each side of the ship.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} \n\nAs built, ''Tirpitz'' was equipped with Model 23 search radars{{efn|Named FuMO for ''Funkmessortungsger\u00e4t'' (Radio direction-finding device).{{sfn|Williamson|p=42}}}} mounted on the forward, foretop, and rear rangefinders. These were later replaced with Model 27 and then Model 26 radars, which had a larger antenna array. A Model 30 radar, known as the ''[[FuG 200 Hohentwiel|Hohentwiel]]'', was mounted in 1944 in her topmast, and a Model 213 ''[[W\u00fcrzburg radar|W\u00fcrzburg]]'' fire-control radar was added on her stern {{convert|10.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} Flak rangefinders.{{sfn|Williamson|p=43}}\n\nThe ship's [[belt armour|main belt]] was {{convert|320|mm|abbr=on}} thick and was covered by a pair of upper and main armoured decks that were {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|100|to|120|mm|abbr=on}} thick, respectively.

While the ship was in Kiel, Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]]. A temporary Baltic Fleet was created to prevent the breakout of the Soviet fleet based in [[Leningrad]]. ''Tirpitz'' was briefly made the [[flagship]] of the squadron, which consisted of the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}}, the [[light cruiser]]s {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6ln||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|N\u00fcrnberg||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|Leipzig||2}}, and {{ship|German cruiser|Emden||2}}, several destroyers, and two flotillas of [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=247}} The Baltic Fleet, under the command of [[Vizeadmiral|Vice Admiral]] [[Otto Ciliax]],{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=239}} patrolled off the [[Aaland Islands]] from 23 to 26 September 1941, after which the unit was disbanded and ''Tirpitz'' resumed training.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=247\u2013248}} During the training period, ''Tirpitz'' tested her primary and secondary guns on the old [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] {{SMS|Hessen||2}},{{sfn|Sweetman|p=11}} which had been converted into a radio-controlled [[target ship]].{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=20}} The British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) continued to launch unsuccessful bombing raids on ''Tirpitz'' while she was stationed in Kiel.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=12}}\n\n=== Deployment to Norway ===\n[[File:Tirpitz camouflaged.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' camouflaged in the [[F\u00e6ttenfjord]]]]\nGrand Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], the commander of the ''Kriegsmarine'', proposed on 13 November that ''Tirpitz'' be deployed to Norway. The ship would be able to attack convoys bound for the Soviet Union, as well as act as a [[fleet in being]] to tie down British naval assets and deter an Allied invasion of Norway. Hitler, who had forbidden an Atlantic sortie after the loss of ''Bismarck'', agreed to the proposal. The ship was taken into dock for modifications for the deployment. The ship's anti-aircraft battery was strengthened, and the 10.5&nbsp;cm guns on the superstructure next to the [[Aircraft catapult#Interwar and World War II|catapult]] were moved outboard to increase their field of fire. The two quadruple 53.3&nbsp;cm torpedo tube mounts were also installed during this refit.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}} The ship's commander, ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]] (KzS\u2013Captain at Sea)'' [[Karl Topp]],{{sfn|Williamson|p=40}} pronounced the ship ready for combat operations on 10 January 1942.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=12}} The following day, ''Tirpitz'' left for Wilhelmshaven, a move designed to conceal her actual destination.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}}\n\nThe ship left Wilhelmshaven at 23:00 on 14 January and made for [[Trondheim]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}} British military intelligence, which was capable of decrypting the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] messages sent by the German navy, detected the departure of the vessel, but poor weather in Britain prevented action by the RAF.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=16}} Admiral [[John Tovey, 1st Baron Tovey|John Tovey]], the commander in chief of the British [[Home Fleet]], was not made aware of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s activities until 17 January, well after the ship had arrived in Norway.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=17}} On 16 January, British aerial reconnaissance located the ship in Trondheim.

These included steaming out of the fjord and the appearance of preparations for a sortie into the [[North Sea]].{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=24\u201325}} Later that month, the ship was reinforced by the heavy cruisers ''Admiral Scheer'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' and several destroyers. ''Prinz Eugen'' had been torpedoed by a British submarine at the entrance to the F\u00e6ttenfjord, and was temporarily out of action.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz early.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' under way, probably in 1941]]\nIn March 1942 ''Tirpitz'' and ''Admiral Scheer'', along with the destroyers {{ship|German destroyer|Z14 Friedrich Ihn||2}}, ''Z5 Paul Jakobi'', {{ship|German destroyer|Z7 Hermann Schoemann||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z25||2}} and a pair of [[torpedo boat]]s,{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} were intended to attack the homebound convoy QP&nbsp;8 and the outbound [[Convoy PQ 12]] as part of [[Operation Sportpalast|''Unternehmen Sportpalast'']] (Operation Sports Palace).{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}}{{sfn|Sweetman|p=27}} ''Admiral Scheer'',{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} with a design speed of {{convert|26|kn}},{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=60}} was too slow to operate with ''Tirpitz'' and was left in port,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} as was the destroyer ''Paul Jakobi''.

Unknown to the Germans, Admiral Tovey was providing distant support to the convoys with the battleship {{HMS|King George V|41|6}}, the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Victorious|R38|6}}, the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Berwick|65|6}}, and six destroyers. Enigma intercepts again forewarned the British of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s attack, which allowed them to reroute the convoys. Admiral Tovey attempted to pursue ''Tirpitz'' on 9&nbsp;March,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} but Admiral Otto Ciliax, the commander of the German squadron, had decided to return to port the previous evening. An air attack was launched early on the 9th; twelve [[Fairey Albacore]] torpedo bombers attacked the ship in three groups, and ''Tirpitz'' successfully evaded the torpedoes. Only three men were wounded in the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=250\u2013251}} ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s anti-aircraft gunners shot down two of the British aircraft.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=149}} After the conclusion of the attack, ''Tirpitz'' made for [[Vestfjorden (Norway)|Vestfjord]], and from there to Trondheim, arriving on the evening of 13 March.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} On 30 March, thirty-three [[Handley Page Halifax|Halifax bombers]] attacked the ship; they scored no hits, and five aircraft were shot down.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=156}} The RAF launched a pair of unsuccessful strikes in late April.

It took the Germans three months to replenish the fuel spent in the attempt to intercept the two Allied convoys. [[Convoy PQ 17]], which left Iceland on 27 June bound for the Soviet Union, was the next convoy targeted by ''Tirpitz'' and the rest of the German fleet stationed in Norway,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} during [[Operation R\u00f6sselsprung (1942)|''Unternehmen R\u00f6sselsprung'']] ([[Knight (chess)#Movement|Operation Knight's Move]]).{{sfn|Sweetman|p=54}} Escorting the convoy were the battleships ''Duke of York'' and {{USS|Washington|BB-56|6}} and the carrier ''Victorious''.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} ''Tirpitz'', {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}, and six destroyers sortied from Trondheim, while a second task force consisting of {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, ''Admiral Scheer'', and six destroyers operated out of [[Narvik]] and Bogenfjord.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=253\u2013255}} ''L\u00fctzow'' and three of the destroyers struck uncharted rocks while en route to the rendezvous and had to return to port.

By this time, the ship needed a major overhaul. Hitler had forbidden the ship to make the dangerous return to Germany, and so the overhaul was conducted in Trondheim. On 23 October, the ship left Bogenfjord and returned to F\u00e6ttenfjord outside Trondheim. The defences of the anchorage were further strengthened; additional anti-aircraft guns were installed, and double anti-torpedo nets were laid around the vessel. The repairs were conducted in limited phases, so ''Tirpitz'' would remain partially operational for the majority of the overhaul. A [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] was built around the stern to allow the replacement of the ship's rudders.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}} During the repair process, the British attempted to attack the battleship with two [[Chariot manned torpedo|Chariot]] [[human torpedo]]es, but before they could be launched, rough seas caused them to break away from the fishing vessel which was towing them.{{sfn|Bishop|pp=165\u2013172}} By 28 December, the overhaul had been completed, and ''Tirpitz'' began sea trials.

To give the ships an opportunity to work together, Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], who had replaced Raeder in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]] on 31 December 1942, ordered [[Operation Zitronella|an attack]] on [[Spitzbergen]], which housed a British weather station and refuelling base.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} Spitzbergen was defended by a garrison of 152 men from the [[Norwegian Armed Forces in exile]].{{sfn|Torkildsen|p=221}} The two battleships, escorted by ten destroyers, left port on 6&nbsp;September; in a [[Ruse of war|''ruse de guerre'']], ''Tirpitz'' flew the [[white ensign]] on the approach to the island the following day.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=76}} During the bombardment, ''Tirpitz'' fired 52 main-battery shells and 82 rounds from her 15&nbsp;cm secondaries.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=77}} This was the first and only time the ship fired her main battery at an enemy surface target.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} An assault force destroyed shore installations and captured 74 prisoners.{{sfn|Torkildsen|p=221}}{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=76\u201377}} By 11:00, the battleships had destroyed their targets and headed back to their Norwegian ports.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}}\n\n=== British attacks on ''Tirpitz'' ===\n[[File:Tirpitz altafjord 2.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' in the [[Ofotfjord]]/[[Bogen, Evenes|Bogenfjord]]]]\n{{see also|List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz}}\n\n==== Operation Source ====\n{{main|Operation Source}}\n\nThe British were determined to neutralise ''Tirpitz'' and remove the threat she posed to the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Allied arctic convoys]]. Following the repeated, ineffectual bombing attacks and the failed Chariot attack in October 1942, the British turned to the newly designed [[X-class submarine|X Craft]] [[midget submarine]]s.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} The planned attack, [[Operation Source]], included attacks on ''Tirpitz'', ''Scharnhorst'', and ''L\u00fctzow''.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=195\u2013196}} The X&nbsp;Craft were towed by large submarines to their destinations, where they could slip under anti-torpedo nets and each drop two powerful two-tonne [[naval mine|mines]] onto the sea bed under the target. Ten vessels were assigned to the operation, scheduled for 20\u201325 September 1943. Only eight of them reached [[K\u00e5fjorden (Alta)|K\u00e5fjord]] in Norway for the attack, which began early on 22 September.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} Three of the vessels, ''X5'', ''X6'', and ''X7'', successfully breached ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s defences, two of which\u2014''X6'' and ''X7''\u2014managed to lay their mines. ''X5'' was detected {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} from the nets and sunk by a combination of gunfire and depth charges.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\nThe mines caused extensive damage to the ship; the first exploded abreast of turret Caesar, and the second detonated {{convert|45|to|55|m|abbr=on}} off the port bow.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=259}} A fuel oil tank was ruptured, shell plating was torn, a large indentation was formed in the bottom of the ship, and bulkheads in the [[double bottom]] buckled. Some {{convert|1430|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the ship in fuel tanks and void spaces in the double bottom of the port side, which caused a [[List (watercraft)|list]] of one to two degrees, which was balanced by counter-flooding on the starboard side. The flooding damaged all of the turbo-generators in generator room No. 2, and all apart from one generator in generator room No.&nbsp;1 were disabled by broken steam lines or severed power cables. Turret Dora was thrown from its bearings and could not be rotated; this was particularly significant, as there were no heavy-lift cranes in Norway powerful enough to lift the turret and place it back on its bearings.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=259\u2013261}} The ship's two [[Arado Ar 196]] floatplanes were completely destroyed. Repairs were conducted by the repair ship {{ship|German repair ship|Neumark||2}}; historians [[William Garzke]] and [[Robert Dulin]] remarked that the successful repair effort was \"one of the most notable feats of naval engineering during the Second World War\".{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=262}} Repairs lasted until 2&nbsp;April 1944; full speed trials were scheduled for the following day in Altafjord.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}}\n\n==== Operation Tungsten ====\n[[File:Fleet Air Arm attack the battleship Tirpitz.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' under attack by British carrier aircraft on 3 April 1944]]\n{{main|Operation Tungsten}}\n\nThe British were aware that ''Neumark'' and the repair crews left in March, which intimated ''Tirpitz'' was nearly operational.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}} A major air strike\u2014[[Operation Tungsten]]\u2014involving the fleet carriers ''Victorious'' and {{HMS|Furious|47|2}} and the escort carriers {{HMS|Emperor|D98|2}}, {{HMS|Fencer|D64|2}}, {{HMS|Pursuer|D73|2}}, and {{HMS|Searcher|D40|2}},{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} was set for 4&nbsp;April 1944, but rescheduled a day earlier when Enigma decrypts revealed that ''Tirpitz'' was to depart at 05:29 on 3&nbsp;April for sea trials.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}} The attack consisted of 40 [[Fairey Barracuda|Barracuda]] dive-bombers carrying {{convert|1600|lb|adj=on}} armour-piercing bombs and 40 escorting fighters in two waves, scoring fifteen direct hits and two near misses.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}}{{sfn|Brown, ''Carrier Operations''|pp=25, 27}} The aircraft achieved surprise, and only one was lost in the first wave; it took twelve to fourteen minutes for all of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s anti-aircraft batteries to be fully manned. The first wave struck at 05:29, as tugs were preparing to assist the ship out of her mooring. The second wave arrived over the target an hour later, shortly after 06:30. Despite the alertness of the German anti-aircraft gunners, only one other bomber was shot down.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=265}}\n\nThe air strikes did not penetrate the main armour but nonetheless caused significant damage to the ship's superstructure and inflicted serious casualties. [[William Garzke]] and Robert Dulin report the attack killed 122 men and wounded 316 others,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=265}} while Hildebrand, R\u00f6hr, & Steinmetz report 132 fatalities and 270 wounded men, including the ship's commander, ''KzS'' Hans Meyer.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=243}} Two of the 15&nbsp;cm turrets were destroyed by bombs, and both Ar 196 floatplanes were destroyed. Several of the bomb hits caused serious fires aboard the ship. Concussive shock disabled the starboard turbine engine, and saltwater used to fight the fires reached the boilers and contaminated the feed water. Some {{convert|2000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the ship, primarily through the two holes in the side shell created by shell splinters from near misses. Water used to fight the fires also contributed to the flooding.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=265\u2013267}} D\u00f6nitz ordered the ship be repaired, regardless of the cost, despite the fact that he understood ''Tirpitz'' could no longer be used in a surface action because of insufficient fighter support. Repair work began in early May; destroyers ferried important equipment and workers from Kiel to Altafjord over the span of three days. By 2&nbsp;June, the ship was again able to steam under her own power, and by the end of the month gunnery trials were possible. During the repair process, the 15&nbsp;cm guns were modified to allow their use against aircraft, and specially-fuzed 38&nbsp;cm shells for barrage anti-aircraft fire were supplied.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=267}}\n\n==== Operations Planet, Brawn, Tiger Claw, Mascot and Goodwood ====\n[[File:German battleship Tirpitz partly covered by a smokescreen at Kaafjord A22634.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' moored in Kaafjord, visible in a British aerial reconnaissance photograph in spite of artificial smoke generated on shore]]\n{{main|Operation Mascot|Operation Goodwood (naval)}}\n\nA series of carrier strikes was planned over the next three months, but bad weather forced their cancellation. A repeat of Operation Tungsten, codenamed Operation Planet, was scheduled for 24 April. Operation Brawn, which was to have been carried out by 27 bombers and 36 fighters from ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'', was to have taken place on 15 May, and Operation Tiger Claw was intended for 28 May. ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'' were joined by {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|2}} for [[Operation Mascot]], which was to have been carried out on 17 July by 62 bombers and 30 fighters. In late August the weather improved, allowing the [[Operation Goodwood (naval)|Goodwood series of attacks]]. Operations Goodwood I and II were launched on 22 August; a carrier force consisting of the fleet carriers ''Furious'', ''Indefatigable'' and {{HMS|Formidable|67|2}} and the escort carriers {{HMS|Nabob|D77|2}} and {{HMS|Trumpeter|D09|2}} launched a total of 38 bombers and 43 escort fighters between the two raids. The attacks failed to inflict any damage on ''Tirpitz'',{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} and three of the attacking aircraft were shot down.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=267}} Goodwood III followed on 24 August, composed of aircraft from the fleet carriers only. Forty-eight bombers and 29 fighters attacked the ship and scored two hits which caused minor damage.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} One, a 1600-pound bomb, penetrated the upper and lower armour decks and came to rest in the No.&nbsp;4 switchboard room. Its fuze had been damaged and the bomb did not detonate. The second, a {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bomb, exploded causing superficial damage.

The RAF used Lancaster bombers to carry {{convert|6|ST|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy bombs]] to penetrate the ship's heavy armour.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=132\u2013139}} The first attack, [[Operation Paravane]], took place on 15 September 1944; operating from a forward base at [[Yagodnik]] in Russia, 23 Lancasters (17 each carrying one Tallboy and six each carrying twelve [[Johnny Walker (bomb)#Inventions|JW mines]]), scored a single hit on the ship's bow.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The Tallboy penetrated the ship, exited the keel, and exploded in the bottom of the fjord. {{convert|800|to|1000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the bow and caused a serious increase in [[Glossary of nautical terms#T|trim]] forward. The ship was rendered unseaworthy and was limited to {{convert|8|to|10|kn}}. Concussive shock caused severe damage to fire-control equipment. The damage persuaded the naval command to repair the ship for use only as a floating gun battery. Repair work was estimated to take nine months, but patching of the holes could be effected within a few weeks, allowing ''Tirpitz'' to be moved further south to [[Troms\u00f8]]. On 15 October, the ship made the {{convert|200|nmi|abbr=on}} trip to Troms\u00f8 under her own power, the last voyage of her career.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}}\n\nThe RAF made a second attempt on 29 October, after the ship was moored off [[H\u00e5k\u00f8ya]] Island outside Troms\u00f8. Thirty-two Lancasters attacked the ship with Tallboys during [[Operation Obviate]].{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} As on Operation Paravane, [[No. IX Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;9 Squadron]] and [[No. 617 Squadron]] carried out the attack together, which resulted in only one near miss,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} partially the result of bad weather over the target.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=193}} The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 38&nbsp;cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high-level bombers; one aircraft was damaged by ground-based anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} Following the attack, the ship's anchorage was significantly improved. A large sandbank was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from capsizing, and anti-torpedo nets were installed. ''Tirpitz'' retained a one-degree list to port from earlier damage, and this was not corrected by counter-flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible. The ship was also prepared for her role as a floating artillery platform: fuel was limited to what was necessary to power the turbo-generators, and the crew was reduced to 1,600 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=270}}\n\n==== Operation Catechism ====\n[[File:1944-11-22 RAF Sinks Tirpitz.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:10|[[Universal Newsreel]] about the attack on ''Tirpitz'']]\n{{main|Operation Catechism}}\n\n[[Operation Catechism]], the final British attack on ''Tirpitz'', took place on 12 November 1944.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The ship again used her 38&nbsp;cm guns against the bombers, which approached the battleship at 09:35; ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s main guns forced the bombers to disperse temporarily, but could not break up the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}} A force of 32 Lancasters from Nos.&nbsp;9 and 617 Squadrons dropped 29 Tallboys on the ship, with two direct hits and one near miss.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Several other bombs landed within the anti-torpedo net barrier and caused significant cratering of the seabed; this removed much of the sandbank that had been constructed to prevent the ship from capsizing. One bomb penetrated the ship's deck between turrets Anton and Bruno but failed to explode. A second hit [[amidships]] between the aircraft catapult and the funnel and caused severe damage. A very large hole was blown in the ship's side and bottom; the entire section of belt armour abreast of the bomb hit was completely destroyed. A third bomb may have struck the port side of turret Caesar.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}}\n\nThe amidships hit caused significant flooding and quickly increased the port list to between 15 and 20&nbsp;degrees. In ten minutes the list increased to 30 to 40&nbsp;degrees, and the captain issued the order to abandon ship. The list increased to 60&nbsp;degrees by 09:50; this appeared to stabilise temporarily. Eight minutes later, a large explosion rocked turret Caesar. The turret roof and part of the rotating structure were thrown {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} into the air and into a group of men swimming to shore, crushing them.

Major [[Heinrich Ehrler]], the commander of III./[[Jagdgeschwader 5]] (3rd Group of the 5th Fighter Wing), was blamed for the Luftwaffe's failure to intercept the British bombers. He was court-martialled in Oslo and threatened with the death penalty. Evidence was presented that his unit had failed to help the Kriegsmarine when requested.

Named after Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], the architect of the [[Imperial German Navy|''Kaiserliche Marine'']] (Imperial Navy), the ship was laid down at the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven]] in November 1936 and her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was launched two and a half years later. Work was completed in February 1941, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Like her sister ship {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}}, ''Tirpitz'' was armed with a main battery of eight {{convert|38|cm|adj=on}} [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|guns]] in four twin [[Gun turret|turrets]]. After a series of wartime modifications she was 2000 tonnes heavier than ''Bismarck'', making her the heaviest battleship ever built by a European navy.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}}\n\nAfter completing [[sea trial]]s in early 1941, ''Tirpitz'' briefly served as the centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was intended to prevent a possible break-out attempt by the [[Soviet Baltic Fleet#Great Patriotic War|Soviet Baltic Fleet]]. In early 1942, the ship sailed to Norway to act as a deterrent against an Allied invasion. While stationed in Norway, ''Tirpitz'' was also intended to be used to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, and two such missions were attempted in 1942. This was the only feasible role for her, since the [[St Nazaire Raid]] had made operations against the Atlantic convoy lanes too risky. ''Tirpitz'' acted as a [[fleet in being]], forcing the British [[Royal Navy]] to retain significant naval forces in the area to contain the battleship.{{sfn|Kemp|p=153}}\n\nIn September 1943, ''Tirpitz'', along with the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}, bombarded Allied positions on [[Spitzbergen (island)|Spitzbergen]], the only time the ship used her main battery in an offensive role. Shortly thereafter, the ship was damaged in [[Operation Source|an attack by British mini-submarines]] and subsequently subjected to a series of large-scale air raids. On 12 November 1944, British [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] equipped with {{convert|12000|lb|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|\"Tallboy\" bombs]] scored two direct hits and a near miss which caused the ship to [[capsize]] rapidly. A deck fire spread to the ammunition magazine for one of the main battery turrets, which caused a large explosion. Figures for the number of men killed in the attack range from 950 to 1,204. Between 1948 and 1957, the wreck was broken up by a joint Norwegian and German salvage operation.\n\n== Design ==\n{{main|Bismarck-class battleship}}\n\nThe two {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship}}s were designed in the mid-1930s by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' as a counter to French naval expansion, specifically the two {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|1}}s France had started in 1935. Laid down after the signing of the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935, ''Tirpitz'' and her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} were nominally within the {{convert|35000|LT|adj=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington regime]] that governed battleship construction in the [[interwar period]]. The ships secretly exceeded the figure by a wide margin, though before either vessel was completed, the international treaty system had fallen apart following Japan's withdrawal in 1937, allowing signatories to invoke an \"escalator clause\" that permitted displacements as high as {{convert|45000|LT}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=203\u2013208}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz-1.jpg|thumb|left|Recognition drawing prepared by the US Navy]]\n\n''Tirpitz'' [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|42900|t|LT|lk=on}} [[Standard displacement|as built]] and {{cvt|52600|t|LT}} [[Full-load displacement|fully loaded]], with a length of {{convert|251|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|10.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{efn|According to naval historians Gerhard Koop and Klaus-Peter Schmolke, ''Tirpitz'' displaced {{convert|53,500|t|LT}} at full load in 1944.{{sfn|Koop & Schmolke|p=18}}}} Her standard crew numbered 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted men; during the war this was increased to 108 officers and 2,500 men. She was powered by three [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving a [[screw propeller]], with steam provided by twelve oil-fired Wagner superheated [[water-tube boiler]]s. Her propulsion system developed a total of {{convert|163023|PS|shp kW|lk=on|abbr=on}} and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|30.8|kn}} on speed trials.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|pp=33, 35}}\n\nShe was armed with eight [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|38&nbsp;cm SK C/34]] L/52 guns arranged in four twin [[gun turret]]s: two [[superfire|superfiring]] turrets forward\u2014Anton and Bruno\u2014and two aft\u2014Caesar and Dora.{{efn|SK stands for ''Schiffskanone'' (ship's gun), C/34 stands for ''Constructionjahr'' (Construction year) 1934, and L/52 denotes the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibres]], meaning that the gun is 52 times long as it is in internal diameter.{{sfn|Campbell|p=219}}}} Her secondary armament consisted of twelve [[15 cm SK C/28|15&nbsp;cm L/55]] guns, sixteen [[10.5&nbsp;cm FlaK 38|10.5&nbsp;cm L/65]] and sixteen [[3.7 cm SK C/30|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on}}]] L/83, and initially twelve [[2 cm FlaK 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}} C/30]] anti-aircraft guns. The number of 2&nbsp;cm guns was eventually increased to 58. After 1942, eight {{convert|53.3|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} above-water [[torpedo tube]]s were installed in two quadruple mounts, one mount on each side of the ship.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} \n\nAs built, ''Tirpitz'' was equipped with Model 23 search radars{{efn|Named FuMO for ''Funkmessortungsger\u00e4t'' (Radio direction-finding device).{{sfn|Williamson|p=42}}}} mounted on the forward, foretop, and rear rangefinders. These were later replaced with Model 27 and then Model 26 radars, which had a larger antenna array. A Model 30 radar, known as the ''[[FuG 200 Hohentwiel|Hohentwiel]]'', was mounted in 1944 in her topmast, and a Model 213 ''[[W\u00fcrzburg radar|W\u00fcrzburg]]'' fire-control radar was added on her stern {{convert|10.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} Flak rangefinders.{{sfn|Williamson|p=43}}\n\nThe ship's [[belt armour|main belt]] was {{convert|320|mm|abbr=on}} thick and was covered by a pair of upper and main armoured decks that were {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|100|to|120|mm|abbr=on}} thick, respectively.

By this time, the ship needed a major overhaul. Hitler had forbidden the ship to make the dangerous return to Germany, and so the overhaul was conducted in Trondheim. On 23 October, the ship left Bogenfjord and returned to F\u00e6ttenfjord outside Trondheim. The defences of the anchorage were further strengthened; additional anti-aircraft guns were installed, and double anti-torpedo nets were laid around the vessel. The repairs were conducted in limited phases, so ''Tirpitz'' would remain partially operational for the majority of the overhaul. A [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] was built around the stern to allow the replacement of the ship's rudders.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}} During the repair process, the British attempted to attack the battleship with two [[Chariot manned torpedo|Chariot]] [[human torpedo]]es, but before they could be launched, rough seas caused them to break away from the fishing vessel which was towing them.{{sfn|Bishop|pp=165\u2013172}} By 28 December, the overhaul had been completed, and ''Tirpitz'' began sea trials.

Following the repeated, ineffectual bombing attacks and the failed Chariot attack in October 1942, the British turned to the newly designed [[X-class submarine|X Craft]] [[midget submarine]]s.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} The planned attack, [[Operation Source]], included attacks on ''Tirpitz'', ''Scharnhorst'', and ''L\u00fctzow''.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=195\u2013196}} The X&nbsp;Craft were towed by large submarines to their destinations, where they could slip under anti-torpedo nets and each drop two powerful two-tonne [[naval mine|mines]] onto the sea bed under the target. Ten vessels were assigned to the operation, scheduled for 20\u201325 September 1943. Only eight of them reached [[K\u00e5fjorden (Alta)|K\u00e5fjord]] in Norway for the attack, which began early on 22 September.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} Three of the vessels, ''X5'', ''X6'', and ''X7'', successfully breached ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s defences, two of which\u2014''X6'' and ''X7''\u2014managed to lay their mines.

The flooding damaged all of the turbo-generators in generator room No. 2, and all apart from one generator in generator room No.&nbsp;1 were disabled by broken steam lines or severed power cables. Turret Dora was thrown from its bearings and could not be rotated; this was particularly significant, as there were no heavy-lift cranes in Norway powerful enough to lift the turret and place it back on its bearings.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=259\u2013261}} The ship's two [[Arado Ar 196]] floatplanes were completely destroyed.

Repair work began in early May; destroyers ferried important equipment and workers from Kiel to Altafjord over the span of three days. By 2&nbsp;June, the ship was again able to steam under her own power, and by the end of the month gunnery trials were possible.

Thirty-two Lancasters attacked the ship with Tallboys during [[Operation Obviate]].{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} As on Operation Paravane, [[No. IX Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;9 Squadron]] and [[No. 617 Squadron]] carried out the attack together, which resulted in only one near miss,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} partially the result of bad weather over the target.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=193}} The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 38&nbsp;cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high-level bombers; one aircraft was damaged by ground-based anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} Following the attack, the ship's anchorage was significantly improved. A large sandbank was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from capsizing, and anti-torpedo nets were installed. ''Tirpitz'' retained a one-degree list to port from earlier damage, and this was not corrected by counter-flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible. The ship was also prepared for her role as a floating artillery platform: fuel was limited to what was necessary to power the turbo-generators, and the crew was reduced to 1,600 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=270}}\n\n==== Operation Catechism ====\n[[File:1944-11-22 RAF Sinks Tirpitz.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:10|[[Universal Newsreel]] about the attack on ''Tirpitz'']]\n{{main|Operation Catechism}}\n\n[[Operation Catechism]], the final British attack on ''Tirpitz'', took place on 12 November 1944.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The ship again used her 38&nbsp;cm guns against the bombers, which approached the battleship at 09:35; ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s main guns forced the bombers to disperse temporarily, but could not break up the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}} A force of 32 Lancasters from Nos.&nbsp;9 and 617 Squadrons dropped 29 Tallboys on the ship, with two direct hits and one near miss.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Several other bombs landed within the anti-torpedo net barrier and caused significant cratering of the seabed; this removed much of the sandbank that had been constructed to prevent the ship from capsizing. One bomb penetrated the ship's deck between turrets Anton and Bruno but failed to explode. A second hit [[amidships]] between the aircraft catapult and the funnel and caused severe damage. A very large hole was blown in the ship's side and bottom; the entire section of belt armour abreast of the bomb hit was completely destroyed. A third bomb may have struck the port side of turret Caesar.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}}\n\nThe amidships hit caused significant flooding and quickly increased the port list to between 15 and 20&nbsp;degrees. In ten minutes the list increased to 30 to 40&nbsp;degrees, and the captain issued the order to abandon ship. The list increased to 60&nbsp;degrees by 09:50; this appeared to stabilise temporarily. Eight minutes later, a large explosion rocked turret Caesar. The turret roof and part of the rotating structure were thrown {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} into the air and into a group of men swimming to shore, crushing them. ''Tirpitz'' rapidly rolled over and buried her superstructure in the sea floor.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=273}}\n\n[[File:Troms\u00f6, Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1942-1945 CL2830.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' capsized]]\nIn the aftermath of the attack, 82 men trapped in the upturned hull were rescued by cutting through the exposed bottom.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Figures for the death toll vary from approximately 950 to 1,204.{{efn|John Sweetman states that 1,000 out of a crew of 1,900 were killed,{{sfn|Sweetman|p=248}} while Niklas Zetterling and Michael Tamelander estimated nearly 1,000 deaths.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=327}} Siegfried Breyer and [[Erich Gr\u00f6ner]] agree on 1,204 deaths,{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}}{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} and Gordon Williamson gives the death toll at 971.{{sfn|Williamson|p=40}} William Dulin and Robert Dulin place the number of deaths at \"about 950\".{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=273}}}} Approximately 200 survivors of the sinking were transferred to the heavy cruiser ''L\u00fctzow'' in January 1945.{{sfn|Prager|p=287}}\n\nThe performance of the Luftwaffe in the defence of ''Tirpitz'' was heavily criticised after her loss. Major [[Heinrich Ehrler]], the commander of III./[[Jagdgeschwader 5]] (3rd Group of the 5th Fighter Wing), was blamed for the Luftwaffe's failure to intercept the British bombers. He was court-martialled in Oslo and threatened with the death penalty. Evidence was presented that his unit had failed to help the Kriegsmarine when requested. He was sentenced to three years in prison, but was released after a month, demoted, and reassigned to an [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262]] fighter squadron in Germany.{{sfn|Morgan & Weal|p=60}} Ehrler was exonerated by further investigations which concluded poor communication between the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe had caused the fiasco;{{sfn|Schuck|p=177}} the aircrews had not been informed that ''Tirpitz'' had been moved off H\u00e5k\u00f8ya two weeks before the attack.{{sfn|Hafsten|p=221}}\n\nThe wreck of ''Tirpitz'' remained in place until after the war, when a joint German-Norwegian company began salvage operations.

It became part of the metropolis in 1855 and the County of London in 1889. The parish became the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green in 1900. In 1965 it was abolished and became a district in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.\n\nThe economic history of Bethnal Green is characterised by a shift away from agricultural provision for the [[City of London]] to market gardening, weaving and light industry, which has now all but disappeared. The quality of the built environment had deteriorated by the turn of the 20th century and was radically altered by [[The Blitz|aerial bombardment]] in the [[Second World War]] and the subsequent social housing developments. In 1943, 173 people were killed at a single incident at [[Bethnal Green tube station|Bethnal Green Underground station]]. Bethnal Green has formed part of Greater London since 1965 and is connected to the [[London Underground]] and [[London Overground]]. In 2005 the area along with neighbouring  [[Haggerston]] suffered a terrorist attack on a [[London Buses]] [[London Buses route 26|route 26 bus]] in the [[21 July 2005 London bombings]] on [[Hackney Road]].\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe [[Topography|topographer]] [[Daniel Lysons (antiquarian)|Daniel Lysons]] suggested in the late 18th century that Bethnal was a corruption of the name Bathon-Hall which would have been the residence of a notable Bathon family who owned large areas of [[Stepney]], the [[Parish councils in England|parish]] of which Bethnal Green was once a part. \"Green\" related to an area which lay \"about half a mile beyond the suburbs\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/london-environs/vol2/pp27-38|title=The Environs of London: Volume 2, County of Middlesex|last=Lysons|first=Daniel|publisher=T Cadell and W Davies|year=1795|isbn=|location=London|pages=27\u201338|author-link=Daniel Lysons (antiquarian)}}</ref>\n\nMore recently it has been suggested that the name could be a derivation of the [[Old English Language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''Blithehale'' or ''Blythenhale'' from the 13th century. ''healh'' would have meant \"angle, nook, or corner\" and ''blithe'' would have been the word for \"happy, blithe\", or come from a personal name ''Blitha''. Over time, the name became ''Bethan Hall Green'', which, because of local pronunciation as ''Beth'n 'all Green'', would eventually change to ''Bethnal Green''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of London Place-Names (2 ed.)|last=Mills|first=A.D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780199566785|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n[[File:Parish of Bethnal Green 1848.gif|thumb|left|Parish of Bethnal Green, 1848]]\n\nIn what would become northern Bethnal Green (known as [[Cambridge Heath]]) a tract of [[common land]], which stretched to the east and west, belonged to the old [[Stepney|Stepney Manor]] to the south. The heath was used as [[pasture]] where people grazed their sheep in the 13th century, though 1275 records suggest at least one house stood there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eastlondonhistory.com/2010/11/07/cambridge-heath/|title=Cambridge Heath - eastlondonhistory.com|website=eastlondonhistory.com}}</ref>\n\nA [[Tudor period|Tudor]] ballad, the ''Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green'', tells the story of an ostensibly poor man who gave a surprisingly generous dowry for his daughter's wedding. The tale furnishes the parish of Bethnal Green's coat of arms. According to one version of the legend, found in [[Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]]'s ''[[Reliques of Ancient English Poetry]]'' published in 1765, the beggar was said to be Henry, the son of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], but Percy himself declared that this version was not genuine.<ref>[http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/blind%20beggar.htm ''Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green'' (East London History)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030011746/http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/blind%20beggar.htm |date=30 October 2007 }}</ref> [[The Blind Beggar]] public house in [[Whitechapel]] is reputed to be the site of his begging.\n\n===Growth===\nThe Green and Poor's Land is the area of open land now occupied by Bethnal Green Library, the [[V&A Museum of Childhood]] and [[St John on Bethnal Green|St John's Church]], designed by [[John Soane]]. In Stow's ''[[Survey of London]]'' (1598) the hamlet was called ''Blethenal Green''. It was one of the hamlets included in the Manor of Stepney and Hackney. Hackney later became separated. In 1678 the owners of houses surrounding the Green purchased the land to save it from being built on and in 1690 the land was conveyed to a trust under which it was to be kept open and rent from it used for the benefit of poor people living in the vicinity. From that date, the trust has administered the land and its minute books are kept in the [[London Metropolitan Archives]]. Bethnal House, or Kirby's Castle, was the principal house on the Green. One of its owners was Sir Hugh Platt (1552\u20131608), author of books on gardening and practical science. Under its next owner it was visited by [[Samuel Pepys]]. In 1727 it was leased to Matthew Wright and for almost two centuries it was an [[Sanctuary|asylum]]. Its two most distinguished inmates were [[Alexander Cruden]], compiler of the ''[[Cruden's Concordance|Concordance to the Bible]]'', and the poet [[Christopher Smart]]. Cruden recorded his experience in ''The London Citizen Grievously Injured'' (1739) and Smart's stay there is recorded by his daughter. Records of the asylum are kept in the annual reports of the Commissioner in Lunacy. Even today, the park where the library stands is known locally as \"Barmy Park\". The original mansion, the White House, was supplemented by other buildings. In 1891 the Trust lost the use of Poor's Land to the London County Council. The asylum reorganised its buildings, demolishing the historic White House and erecting a new block in 1896. This building became the present Bethnal Green Library. A history of Poor's Land and Bethnal House is included in ''The Green'', written by A.J. Robinson and D.H.B. Chesshyre.\n\nBoxing has a long association with Bethnal Green. [[Daniel Mendoza]], who was champion of England from 1792 to 1795 though born in [[Aldgate]], lived in Paradise Row on the western side of Bethnal Green for 30 years.\n\nThe north end of the Green is associated with the Natt family. During the 18th century they owned many of its houses. Netteswell House is the residence of the curator of the Bethnal Green Museum. It is almost certainly named after the village of [[Netteswell]], near [[Harlow]], whose [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] was the Reverend Anthony Natt. A few of its houses have become [[University settlement]]s. In Victoria Park Square, on the east side of the Green, No. 18 has a [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] well in its cellar.<ref>''The Green, Land assessments records'', Gascoyne's survey of 1703.</ref>\n\nThe silk-weaving trade spread eastwards from [[Spitalfields]] throughout the 18th century. This attracted many [[Huguenot]] and Irish weavers to the district. Large estates of small two-storey cottages were developed in the west of the area to house them. A downturn in the trade in 1769 led to the [[Spitalfield Riots]], and on 6 December 1769, two weavers accused of \"cutting\" were hanged in front of the Salmon and Ball [[public house]].\n\nBethnal Green Road Market on the road of the same name, founded in the 18th century, grew and grew and became more full with stalls. By 1959 stalls were choking the streets and the council attempted to relocate the market but had no success. In 1986 there had been many shop closures but the stalls were still trading. The street market is now today recognised as a major local shopping area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bgbusinessforum.org.uk/about/sample-page/|last=Bethnal Green Business Forum|title=History|date=2014|accessdate=1 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Victorian era===\n[[File:Slum children bethnal green.jpg|thumb|right|Slum children in bed, Bethnal Green, 1900\u20131910]]\n\nIn the 19th century, Bethnal Green remained characterised by its [[Market gardening|market gardens]] and by weaving. Having been an area of large houses and gardens as late as the 18th century, by about 1860 Bethnal Green was mainly full of tumbledown old buildings with many families living in each house. By the end of the century, Bethnal Green was one of the poorest slums in London. [[Jack the Ripper]] operated at the western end of Bethnal Green and in neighbouring [[Whitechapel]]. In 1900, the Old Nichol Street [[Rookery (slum)|rookery]] was demolished, and the Boundary Estate opened on the site near the boundary with Shoreditch. This was the world's first [[council housing]], and brothers [[Lew Grade]] and [[Bernard Delfont]] were brought up here.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22752 'Bethnal Green: Building and Social Conditions from 1876 to 1914', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 126\u201332] accessed: 14 November 2006.</ref> In 1909, the Bethnal Green Estate was built with money left by the philanthropist [[William Richard Sutton]] which he left for \"modern dwellings and houses for occupation by the poor of London and other towns and populous places in England\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.affinitysutton.com/about_us/our_organisation/our_history/timeline.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819025634/http://www.affinitysutton.com/about_us/our_organisation/our_history/timeline.aspx |archivedate=19 August 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.affinitysutton.com/about_us/our_organisation/our_history.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123024858/http://www.affinitysutton.com/about_us/our_organisation/our_history.aspx |archivedate=23 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bethnal green slum.jpg|thumb|Slum street in Bethnal Green, circa 1900]]\n\nThe [[Regent's Canal]] opened in 1820, for horse drawn canal barges to carry cargo from the [[River Thames]] to the [[Grand Union Canal]].

However most of the local residents were poor, especially in the streets around the railway line and the Regent's Canal, as well as on Russia Lane. It was during this time the [[Peabody Trust]] built the Bethnal Green Estate in 1910.<ref>https://www.hidden-london.com/gazetteer/cambridge-heath/amp/</ref>\n\nIn 1841, the [[Anglo-Catholic]] [[Nathaniel Woodard]], who was to become a highly influential educationalist in the later part of the 19th century, became the [[curate]] of the newly created St. Bartholomew's in Bethnal Green. He was a capable pastoral visitor and established a parochial school. In 1843, he got into trouble for preaching a [[sermon]] in which he argued that ''[[The Book of Common Prayer]]'' should have additional material to provide for [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and [[absolution]] and in which he criticised the \"inefficient and Godless clergy\" of the [[Church of England]]. After examining the text of the sermon, the [[Bishop of London]] condemned it as containing \"erroneous and dangerous notions\". As a result, the bishop sent Woodard to be a curate in [[Lower Clapton|Clapton]].\n\nGlobe Town was established from 1800 to provide for the expanding population of [[weaver (occupation)|weavers]] around Bethnal Green attracted by improving prospects in [[silk]] weaving. The population of Bethnal Green trebled between 1801 and 1831, operating 20,000 looms in their own homes. By 1824, with restrictions on importation of French silks relaxed, up to half these looms became idle and prices were driven down. With many importing [[warehouse]]s already established in the district, the abundance of cheap labour was turned to boot, furniture and clothing manufacture. Globe Town continued its expansion into the 1860s, long after the decline of the silk industry.<ref name=women>From 1801 to 1821, the population of Bethnal Green more than doubled and by 1831 it had trebled. These incomers were principally weavers.

It became part of the metropolis in 1855 and the County of London in 1889. The parish became the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green in 1900. In 1965 it was abolished and became a district in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.\n\nThe economic history of Bethnal Green is characterised by a shift away from agricultural provision for the [[City of London]] to market gardening, weaving and light industry, which has now all but disappeared. The quality of the built environment had deteriorated by the turn of the 20th century and was radically altered by [[The Blitz|aerial bombardment]] in the [[Second World War]] and the subsequent social housing developments. In 1943, 173 people were killed at a single incident at [[Bethnal Green tube station|Bethnal Green Underground station]]. Bethnal Green has formed part of Greater London since 1965 and is connected to the [[London Underground]] and [[London Overground]]. In 2005 the area along with neighbouring  [[Haggerston]] suffered a terrorist attack on a [[London Buses]] [[London Buses route 26|route 26 bus]] in the [[21 July 2005 London bombings]] on [[Hackney Road]].\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe [[Topography|topographer]] [[Daniel Lysons (antiquarian)|Daniel Lysons]] suggested in the late 18th century that Bethnal was a corruption of the name Bathon-Hall which would have been the residence of a notable Bathon family who owned large areas of [[Stepney]], the [[Parish councils in England|parish]] of which Bethnal Green was once a part. \"Green\" related to an area which lay \"about half a mile beyond the suburbs\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/london-environs/vol2/pp27-38|title=The Environs of London: Volume 2, County of Middlesex|last=Lysons|first=Daniel|publisher=T Cadell and W Davies|year=1795|isbn=|location=London|pages=27\u201338|author-link=Daniel Lysons (antiquarian)}}</ref>\n\nMore recently it has been suggested that the name could be a derivation of the [[Old English Language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''Blithehale'' or ''Blythenhale'' from the 13th century. ''healh'' would have meant \"angle, nook, or corner\" and ''blithe'' would have been the word for \"happy, blithe\", or come from a personal name ''Blitha''. Over time, the name became ''Bethan Hall Green'', which, because of local pronunciation as ''Beth'n 'all Green'', would eventually change to ''Bethnal Green''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of London Place-Names (2 ed.)|last=Mills|first=A.D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780199566785|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n[[File:Parish of Bethnal Green 1848.gif|thumb|left|Parish of Bethnal Green, 1848]]\n\nIn what would become northern Bethnal Green (known as [[Cambridge Heath]]) a tract of [[common land]], which stretched to the east and west, belonged to the old [[Stepney|Stepney Manor]] to the south. The heath was used as [[pasture]] where people grazed their sheep in the 13th century, though 1275 records suggest at least one house stood there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eastlondonhistory.com/2010/11/07/cambridge-heath/|title=Cambridge Heath - eastlondonhistory.com|website=eastlondonhistory.com}}</ref>\n\nA [[Tudor period|Tudor]] ballad, the ''Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green'', tells the story of an ostensibly poor man who gave a surprisingly generous dowry for his daughter's wedding. The tale furnishes the parish of Bethnal Green's coat of arms. According to one version of the legend, found in [[Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]]'s ''[[Reliques of Ancient English Poetry]]'' published in 1765, the beggar was said to be Henry, the son of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], but Percy himself declared that this version was not genuine.<ref>[http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/blind%20beggar.htm ''Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green'' (East London History)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030011746/http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/blind%20beggar.htm |date=30 October 2007 }}</ref> [[The Blind Beggar]] public house in [[Whitechapel]] is reputed to be the site of his begging.\n\n===Growth===\nThe Green and Poor's Land is the area of open land now occupied by Bethnal Green Library, the [[V&A Museum of Childhood]] and [[St John on Bethnal Green|St John's Church]], designed by [[John Soane]]. In Stow's ''[[Survey of London]]'' (1598) the hamlet was called ''Blethenal Green''. It was one of the hamlets included in the Manor of Stepney and Hackney. Hackney later became separated. In 1678 the owners of houses surrounding the Green purchased the land to save it from being built on and in 1690 the land was conveyed to a trust under which it was to be kept open and rent from it used for the benefit of poor people living in the vicinity. From that date, the trust has administered the land and its minute books are kept in the [[London Metropolitan Archives]]. Bethnal House, or Kirby's Castle, was the principal house on the Green. One of its owners was Sir Hugh Platt (1552\u20131608), author of books on gardening and practical science. Under its next owner it was visited by [[Samuel Pepys]]. In 1727 it was leased to Matthew Wright and for almost two centuries it was an [[Sanctuary|asylum]]. Its two most distinguished inmates were [[Alexander Cruden]], compiler of the ''[[Cruden's Concordance|Concordance to the Bible]]'', and the poet [[Christopher Smart]]. Cruden recorded his experience in ''The London Citizen Grievously Injured'' (1739) and Smart's stay there is recorded by his daughter. Records of the asylum are kept in the annual reports of the Commissioner in Lunacy. Even today, the park where the library stands is known locally as \"Barmy Park\". The original mansion, the White House, was supplemented by other buildings. In 1891 the Trust lost the use of Poor's Land to the London County Council. The asylum reorganised its buildings, demolishing the historic White House and erecting a new block in 1896. This building became the present Bethnal Green Library. A history of Poor's Land and Bethnal House is included in ''The Green'', written by A.J. Robinson and D.H.B. Chesshyre.\n\nBoxing has a long association with Bethnal Green. [[Daniel Mendoza]], who was champion of England from 1792 to 1795 though born in [[Aldgate]], lived in Paradise Row on the western side of Bethnal Green for 30 years.\n\nThe north end of the Green is associated with the Natt family. During the 18th century they owned many of its houses. Netteswell House is the residence of the curator of the Bethnal Green Museum. It is almost certainly named after the village of [[Netteswell]], near [[Harlow]], whose [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] was the Reverend Anthony Natt. A few of its houses have become [[University settlement]]s. In Victoria Park Square, on the east side of the Green, No. 18 has a [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] well in its cellar.<ref>''The Green, Land assessments records'', Gascoyne's survey of 1703.</ref>\n\nThe silk-weaving trade spread eastwards from [[Spitalfields]] throughout the 18th century. This attracted many [[Huguenot]] and Irish weavers to the district. Large estates of small two-storey cottages were developed in the west of the area to house them. A downturn in the trade in 1769 led to the [[Spitalfield Riots]], and on 6 December 1769, two weavers accused of \"cutting\" were hanged in front of the Salmon and Ball [[public house]].\n\nBethnal Green Road Market on the road of the same name, founded in the 18th century, grew and grew and became more full with stalls. By 1959 stalls were choking the streets and the council attempted to relocate the market but had no success. In 1986 there had been many shop closures but the stalls were still trading. The street market is now today recognised as a major local shopping area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bgbusinessforum.org.uk/about/sample-page/|last=Bethnal Green Business Forum|title=History|date=2014|accessdate=1 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Victorian era===\n[[File:Slum children bethnal green.jpg|thumb|right|Slum children in bed, Bethnal Green, 1900\u20131910]]\n\nIn the 19th century, Bethnal Green remained characterised by its [[Market gardening|market gardens]] and by weaving. Having been an area of large houses and gardens as late as the 18th century, by about 1860 Bethnal Green was mainly full of tumbledown old buildings with many families living in each house. By the end of the century, Bethnal Green was one of the poorest slums in London. [[Jack the Ripper]] operated at the western end of Bethnal Green and in neighbouring [[Whitechapel]]. In 1900, the Old Nichol Street [[Rookery (slum)|rookery]] was demolished, and the Boundary Estate opened on the site near the boundary with Shoreditch. This was the world's first [[council housing]], and brothers [[Lew Grade]] and [[Bernard Delfont]] were brought up here.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22752 'Bethnal Green: Building and Social Conditions from 1876 to 1914', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 126\u201332] accessed: 14 November 2006.</ref> In 1909, the Bethnal Green Estate was built with money left by the philanthropist [[William Richard Sutton]] which he left for \"modern dwellings and houses for occupation by the poor of London and other towns and populous places in England\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.affinitysutton.com/about_us/our_organisation/our_history/timeline.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819025634/http://www.affinitysutton.com/about_us/our_organisation/our_history/timeline.aspx |archivedate=19 August 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.affinitysutton.com/about_us/our_organisation/our_history.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123024858/http://www.affinitysutton.com/about_us/our_organisation/our_history.aspx |archivedate=23 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bethnal green slum.jpg|thumb|Slum street in Bethnal Green, circa 1900]]\n\nThe [[Regent's Canal]] opened in 1820, for horse drawn canal barges to carry cargo from the [[River Thames]] to the [[Grand Union Canal]].

However most of the local residents were poor, especially in the streets around the railway line and the Regent's Canal, as well as on Russia Lane. It was during this time the [[Peabody Trust]] built the Bethnal Green Estate in 1910.<ref>https://www.hidden-london.com/gazetteer/cambridge-heath/amp/</ref>\n\nIn 1841, the [[Anglo-Catholic]] [[Nathaniel Woodard]], who was to become a highly influential educationalist in the later part of the 19th century, became the [[curate]] of the newly created St. Bartholomew's in Bethnal Green. He was a capable pastoral visitor and established a parochial school. In 1843, he got into trouble for preaching a [[sermon]] in which he argued that ''[[The Book of Common Prayer]]'' should have additional material to provide for [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and [[absolution]] and in which he criticised the \"inefficient and Godless clergy\" of the [[Church of England]]. After examining the text of the sermon, the [[Bishop of London]] condemned it as containing \"erroneous and dangerous notions\". As a result, the bishop sent Woodard to be a curate in [[Lower Clapton|Clapton]].\n\nGlobe Town was established from 1800 to provide for the expanding population of [[weaver (occupation)|weavers]] around Bethnal Green attracted by improving prospects in [[silk]] weaving. The population of Bethnal Green trebled between 1801 and 1831, operating 20,000 looms in their own homes. By 1824, with restrictions on importation of French silks relaxed, up to half these looms became idle and prices were driven down. With many importing [[warehouse]]s already established in the district, the abundance of cheap labour was turned to boot, furniture and clothing manufacture. Globe Town continued its expansion into the 1860s, long after the decline of the silk industry.<ref name=women>From 1801 to 1821, the population of Bethnal Green more than doubled and by 1831 it had trebled. These incomers were principally weavers.
