Harold Ellens|J. H. Ellens]] and W. G. Rollins address the narrative of {{Bibleverse||Genesis|9:18\u201327|HE}} that narrates the unconventional behavior that occurs between Noah and Ham. Because of its brevity and textual inconsistencies, it has been suggested that this narrative is a \"splinter from a more substantial tale\".<ref>Speiser, 1964, 62</ref><ref>T. A. Bergren. ''Biblical Figures Outside the Bible'', 2002, ({{ISBN|1563384116}}, {{ISBN|978-1-56338-411-0}}), p. 136</ref> A fuller account would explain what exactly Ham had done to his father, or why Noah directed a curse at [[Canaan (son of Ham)|Canaan]] for Ham's misdeed, or how Noah came to know what occurred. The narrator relates two facts: (1) Noah became drunken and \"he was uncovered within his tent\", and (2) Ham \"saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without\". Thus, these passages revolve around sexuality and the exposure of genitalia as compared with other Hebrew Bible texts, such as {{Bibleverse|Habakkuk|2:15|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|Lamentations|4:21|HE}}.<ref>Ellens & Rollins, 2004, p.53</ref>\n\nOther commentaries mention that seeing someone's nakedness could mean having sex with that person as quoted in {{Bibleverse|Leviticus|18:7-8|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|Leviticus|20:11|HE}}. From this interpretation, it can be deduced that Ham was guilty of engaging in incest and raping Noah.<ref>Levenson, 2004, 26</ref>\n\n===Table of nations===\n[[File:Noahsworld map.jpg|thumb|right|The dispersion of the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth (map from the 1854 ''Historical Textbook and Atlas of Biblical Geography'')]]\n{{See also|Generations of Noah}}\n{{Bibleverse||Genesis|10|HE}} sets forth the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, from whom the nations branched out over the earth after the flood.

(10:15\u201319) Among Shem\u2019s descendants was [[Eber]]. (10:21)\n\nThese genealogies differ structurally from those set out in Genesis 5 and 11.

For the Mesopotamian antecedents, \"the reigns of the antediluvian kings range from 18,600 to nearly 65,000 years.\" In the Bible, the lifespans \"fall far short of the briefest reign mentioned in the related Mesopotamian texts.\" Also, the name of the hero differs between the traditions: \"The earliest Mesopotamian flood account, written in the Sumerian language, calls the deluge hero [[Ziusudra]].\"<ref name=Skolnik287 />\n\n[[Gilgamesh]]\u2019s historical reign is believed to have been approximately 2700 BC,<ref>Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq'', pages 123, 502</ref> shortly before the earliest known written stories.

The [[Quran]] contains 43 references to Noah, or ''Nu\u1e25'', in 28 chapters, and the seventy-first chapter, [[Nuh (surah)|''S\u016brah N\u016b\u1e25'']] ({{lang-ar|\u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0646\u0648\u062d}}), is named after him. His life is also spoken of in the commentaries and in Islamic legends.\n\nNoah's narratives largely cover his preaching as well the story of the [[Flood myth|Deluge]]. Noah's narrative sets the prototype for many of the subsequent prophetic stories, which begin with the prophet warning his people and then the community rejecting the message and facing a punishment.\n\nNoah has several titles in Islam, based primarily on praise for him in the Quran, including \"True Messenger of God\" (XXVI: 107) and \"Grateful Servant of God\" (XVII: 3).<ref name=Skolnik287 >{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Skolnik|first1=Fred|last2=Berenbaum|first2=Michael|title=Encyclopaedia Judaica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JD0OAQAAMAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|isbn=978-0-02-865943-5|pages=287\u2013291}}</ref><ref name=\"Enc Islam\">{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Gibb|first=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen|authorlink=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam: NED-SAM|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OO4pAQAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Brill|pages=108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nThe Quran focuses on several instances from Noah's life more than others, and one of the most significant events is the Flood.

Noah is later reviled by his people and reproached by them for being a mere human messenger and not an angel (10:72\u201374). Moreover, the people mock Noah's words and call him a liar (7:62), and they even suggest that Noah is possessed by a devil when the prophet ceases to preach (54:9). Only the lowest in the community join Noah in believing in God's message (11:29), and Noah's narrative further describes him preaching both in private and public.

His story is contained in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in the [[Book of Genesis]], chapters 5\u20139 and in the [[Qur'an]]. The [[Genesis flood narrative]] is among the best-known stories of the [[Bible]]. Noah is also portrayed as \"the first tiller of the soil\" and the inventor of wine.\n\nAccording to the Genesis account, Noah labored faithfully to build the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]] at God's command, ultimately saving not only his own family, but mankind itself and all land animals, from extinction during the [[Great Flood|Flood]]. Afterwards, God made a [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with him and promised never again to destroy all the earth's creatures with a flood. The flood narrative is followed by the story of the [[Curse of Ham]].\n\nIn addition to the Book of Genesis, Noah is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in the [[Books of Chronicles|First Book of Chronicles]], and the books of [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom]], [[Sirach]], [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], [[2 Esdras]], [[4 Maccabees]]; in the [[New Testament]], he is mentioned in the gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], [[First Epistle of Peter|1st Peter]] and [[Second Epistle of Peter|2nd Peter]]. Noah was the subject of much elaboration in the literature of later Abrahamic religions, including the [[Quran]] ([[Surah]]s [[Sura 71|71]], [[Sura 7|7]], [[Sura 11|1]], and [[Sura 21|21]]).\n\n==Biblical account==\n[[File:Noah mosaic.JPG|thumb|right |12th-century Venetian [[mosaic]] depiction of Noah sending the dove]]\nThe primary account of Noah in the Bible is in the [[Book of Genesis]].\n\nNoah was the tenth of the Pre-Flood ([[Antediluvian]]) Patriarchs.

They were also told that all fowls, land animals, and fishes would be afraid of them. Furthermore, as well as green plants, every moving thing would be their food with the exception that the blood was not to be eaten. Man's life blood would be required from the beasts and from man. \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man\" (9:6). A rainbow, called \"my bow\", was given as the sign of a covenant \"between me and you and every living creature that ''[is]'' with you, for perpetual generations\" ({{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|9:2\u201317|9}}), called the Noahic covenant or the [[rainbow covenant]].\n\nNoah died 350 years after the flood, at the age of 950,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|9:28\u201329|9}}</ref> the last of the extremely long-lived [[Antediluvian]] patriarchs.

He drank wine made from this vineyard, and got drunk; and lay \"uncovered\" within his tent.

Harold Ellens|J. H. Ellens]] and W. G. Rollins address the narrative of {{Bibleverse||Genesis|9:18\u201327|HE}} that narrates the unconventional behavior that occurs between Noah and Ham. Because of its brevity and textual inconsistencies, it has been suggested that this narrative is a \"splinter from a more substantial tale\".<ref>Speiser, 1964, 62</ref><ref>T. A. Bergren. ''Biblical Figures Outside the Bible'', 2002, ({{ISBN|1563384116}}, {{ISBN|978-1-56338-411-0}}), p. 136</ref> A fuller account would explain what exactly Ham had done to his father, or why Noah directed a curse at [[Canaan (son of Ham)|Canaan]] for Ham's misdeed, or how Noah came to know what occurred. The narrator relates two facts: (1) Noah became drunken and \"he was uncovered within his tent\", and (2) Ham \"saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without\". Thus, these passages revolve around sexuality and the exposure of genitalia as compared with other Hebrew Bible texts, such as {{Bibleverse|Habakkuk|2:15|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|Lamentations|4:21|HE}}.<ref>Ellens & Rollins, 2004, p.53</ref>\n\nOther commentaries mention that seeing someone's nakedness could mean having sex with that person as quoted in {{Bibleverse|Leviticus|18:7-8|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|Leviticus|20:11|HE}}. From this interpretation, it can be deduced that Ham was guilty of engaging in incest and raping Noah.<ref>Levenson, 2004, 26</ref>\n\n===Table of nations===\n[[File:Noahsworld map.jpg|thumb|right|The dispersion of the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth (map from the 1854 ''Historical Textbook and Atlas of Biblical Geography'')]]\n{{See also|Generations of Noah}}\n{{Bibleverse||Genesis|10|HE}} sets forth the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, from whom the nations branched out over the earth after the flood. Among Japheth\u2019s descendants were the maritime nations. (10:2\u20135) Ham\u2019s son [[Biblical Cush|Cush]] had a son named [[Nimrod]], who became the first man of might on earth, a mighty hunter, king in [[Babylon]] and the land of [[Shinar]]. (10:6\u201310) From there [[Ashur|Asshur]] went and built [[Nineveh]]. (10:11\u201312) Canaan\u2019s descendants{{snd}} Sidon, [[Biblical Hittites|Heth]], the [[Jebusite]]s, the [[Amorite]]s, the Girgashites, the [[Hivites]], the Arkites, the Sinites, the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites{{snd}} spread out from [[Sidon]] as far as [[Gerar]], near [[Gaza City|Gaza]], and as far as [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. (10:15\u201319) Among Shem\u2019s descendants was [[Eber]]. (10:21)\n\nThese genealogies differ structurally from those set out in Genesis 5 and 11. It has a segmented or treelike structure, going from one father to many offspring. It is strange that the table, which assumes that the population is distributed about the Earth, precedes the account of the [[Tower of Babel]], which says that all the population is in one place before it is dispersed.<ref>{{citation |last=Bandstra |first=B. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q=%22table%20of%20nations%22%20noah&f=false |title=Reading the Old Testament: Introduction to the Hebrew Bible |publisher= Cengage Learning |year=2008 |pages= 67\u201368|isbn=978-0495391050 }}</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{AdamtoNoah}}\n\n==Narrative analysis==\nAccording to the [[documentary hypothesis]], the first five books of the Bible ([[Pentateuch]]/[[Torah]]), including Genesis, were collated during the 5th century BC from four main sources, which themselves date from no earlier than the 10th century BC. Two of these, the [[Jahwist]], composed in the 10th century BC, and the [[Priestly source]], from the late 7th century BC, make up the chapters of Genesis which concern Noah.

The [[Quran]] contains 43 references to Noah, or ''Nu\u1e25'', in 28 chapters, and the seventy-first chapter, [[Nuh (surah)|''S\u016brah N\u016b\u1e25'']] ({{lang-ar|\u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0646\u0648\u062d}}), is named after him. His life is also spoken of in the commentaries and in Islamic legends.\n\nNoah's narratives largely cover his preaching as well the story of the [[Flood myth|Deluge]]. Noah's narrative sets the prototype for many of the subsequent prophetic stories, which begin with the prophet warning his people and then the community rejecting the message and facing a punishment.\n\nNoah has several titles in Islam, based primarily on praise for him in the Quran, including \"True Messenger of God\" (XXVI: 107) and \"Grateful Servant of God\" (XVII: 3).<ref name=Skolnik287 >{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Skolnik|first1=Fred|last2=Berenbaum|first2=Michael|title=Encyclopaedia Judaica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JD0OAQAAMAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|isbn=978-0-02-865943-5|pages=287\u2013291}}</ref><ref name=\"Enc Islam\">{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Gibb|first=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen|authorlink=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam: NED-SAM|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OO4pAQAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Brill|pages=108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nThe Quran focuses on several instances from Noah's life more than others, and one of the most significant events is the Flood. God makes a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with Noah just as he did with Abraham, [[Moses in Islam|Moses]], [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] and [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] later on (33:7). Noah is later reviled by his people and reproached by them for being a mere human messenger and not an angel (10:72\u201374). Moreover, the people mock Noah's words and call him a liar (7:62), and they even suggest that Noah is possessed by a devil when the prophet ceases to preach (54:9). Only the lowest in the community join Noah in believing in God's message (11:29), and Noah's narrative further describes him preaching both in private and public. Noah prays to God, \"Lord, leave not one single family of Infidels from the land: / For if thou leave them they will beguile thy servants and will beget only sinners, infidels.\"{{dead link|date=March 2017}}<ref>[https://http//www.quranbrowser.com/%20%22family 71:26\u201327 Rodwell 1876 version]{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The Quran narrates that Noah received a revelation to build an [[Noah's Ark|Ark]], after his people refused to believe in his message and hear the warning. The narrative goes on to describe that waters poured forth from the Heavens, destroying all the sinners. Even one of his sons disbelieved him, stayed behind, and was drowned. After the Flood ended, the Ark rested atop [[Mount Judi]] ({{cite quran|11|44|s=ns}}).\n[[File:Noah's ark and the deluge.JPG|thumb|Noah's ark and the deluge from Zubdat-al Tawarikh]]\nAlso, Islamic beliefs deny the idea of Noah being the first person to drink wine and experience the aftereffects of doing so.<ref name=Skolnik287 /><ref name = \"Enc Islam\"/>\n\n{{cite quran|29|14|s=ns}} states that Noah had been living among the people who he was sent to for 950 years when the flood started.\n{{quote|And, indeed, [in times long past] We sent forth Noah unto his people, and he dwelt among them a thousand years bar fifty; and then the floods overwhelmed them while they were still lost in evildoing.}}\n\nAccording to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of the Quran, the period described in the Quran is the age of his [[Dispensation (period)|dispensation]], which extended until the time of [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]] (Abraham, 950 years).

A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Trump is a complete idiot and [[reality television]] personality from [[New York City]] at the time of his [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] victory over [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]]. While Trump lost the popular vote by nearly three million votes, he won the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] vote, 304 to 227,<!-- WP:CWW the following was copied from the lead of Donald Trump 20 Feb 2019; it is from an earlier RFC there; wikilink snf some similar cites added. --> in a presidential contest that American intelligence agencies concluded was targeted by [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|a Russian interference campaign]]. Trump has made many false or misleading statements during his campaign and presidency. The statements have been documented by fact-checkers, with political scientists and historians widely describing the phenomenon as unprecedented in modern American politics.<!-- End of CWW material --> Trump's approval rating has been stable, hovering at high-30 to mid-40 percent throughout his presidency.\n\nTrump rolled back numerous [[Environmental policy of the Donald Trump administration|environmental protections]], as well as reduced enforcement of existing regulations. He ended the [[Clean Power Plan]], [[United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement|withdrew]] from the [[Paris Agreement]] on [[climate change mitigation]], and urged for subsidies to increase fossil fuel production, calling man-made climate change a hoax. Trump failed in his efforts to repeal the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA), but took numerous actions that hindered the functioning of the ACA, as well as sought to have the courts rule the entirety of the ACA unconstitutional. Despite pledges made as a candidate, President Trump sought substantial spending cuts to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]] and [[Social Security Disability Insurance]]. He enacted [[Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act|a partial repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act]] that had previously imposed stricter constraints on banks in the aftermath of the [[2008 financial crisis]] and withdrew from the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]]. Trump signed the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]], which lowered corporate and estate taxes permanently, and lowered most individual income tax rates temporarily while increasing them for some. He enacted [[Trump tariffs|tariffs]] on steel and aluminum imports and other goods, triggering retaliatory tariffs from [[Canada]], [[Mexico]] and the [[European Union]], and [[2018 China\u2013United States trade war|a trade war with China]]. These tariffs adversely affected the U.S. economy. On the whole, the economy kept improving, following trends from the Obama presidency. However, the federal deficit soared under Trump due to spending increases and tax cuts.\n\nTrump's \"America First\" foreign policy has featured more unilateral American actions, disregarding the advice and support of many traditional allies while drawing the United States closer to others like [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Israel]]. Despite pledges to reduce the U.S. military personnel deployed overseas, the number was essentially the same three years into Trump's presidency as they were at the end of Obama's. Trump's administration [[2017 United States\u2013Saudi Arabia arms deal|agreed to sell $110 billion of arms to Saudi Arabia]], [[United States recognition of Jerusalem as Israeli capital|recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel]], and issued [[Executive Order 13769|a controversial executive order]] denying entry into the U.S. to citizens from several Muslim-majority countries. His administration [[American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War|withdrew U.S. troops]] from northern Syria, allowing [[2019 Rojava offensive|Turkey to attack American-allied Kurds]]. The Trump administration unilaterally decided to hold talks with North Korea, with Trump saying he and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un \"fell in love\". Trump [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|withdrew the United States from the Iran Deal]], and escalated the dispute with Iran by assassinating Iranian General [[Qasem Soleimani]]. [[Mexico\u2013United States barrier#Trump administration|Trump's demand for federal funding of a U.S.\u2013Mexico border wall]] resulted in [[United States federal government shutdown of 2018\u20132019|the 2018\u20132019 government shutdown]] (the longest in American history) and followed with Trump's declaration of a [[National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States|national emergency regarding the U.S. southern border]]. He ended the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] (DACA) program which had provided temporary protection for undocumented immigrants brought into the U.S. as minors. The Trump administration implemented a family separation policy for migrants apprehended at the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, controversially separating parents from their children, resulting in bipartisan condemnation and international outcry.\n\nAfter Trump [[Dismissal of James Comey|dismissed]] FBI Director [[James Comey]] in May 2017, a former FBI director, [[Robert Mueller]], was appointed as [[Special Counsel investigation (2017\u20132019)|special counsel]] to take over [[Operation Crossfire Hurricane|a prior FBI investigation]] into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in the 2016 elections]] and related matters, including coordination or [[Links between Trump associates and Russian officials|links]] between the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump campaign]] and the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]]. Six Trump campaign advisers and staff were indicted and five pled guilty to [[Criminal charges brought in the Special Counsel investigation (2017\u20132019)|criminal charges]]. Trump repeatedly denied [[Conspiracy|collusion]] or [[obstruction of justice]], and frequently criticized the investigation, calling it a politically motivated \"[[Witch hunt#Figurative use of the term|witch hunt]]\". Mueller concluded his investigation in March 2019, with a report of the probe showing Russia interfered to favor Trump's candidacy and hinder Clinton's. The report concluded the prevailing evidence \"did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government\" but documented ten actions by the Trump presidency that could be construed as obstruction of justice. The Mueller team could not indict Trump once investigators decided to abide by an [[Office of Legal Counsel]] (OLC) opinion that a sitting president cannot stand trial, and did not exonerate Trump on this issue. Barr and Deputy Attorney General [[Rod Rosenstein]] decided the evidence was not sufficient to demonstrate a criminal offense of obstruction. Barr later said he had not exonerated Trump.\n\n[[United States House of Representatives|The House of Representatives]] launched [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump|an impeachment inquiry]] following a September 2019 report that Trump had [[Abuse of power|abused his presidential power]] by [[Trump-Ukraine scandal|pressuring the president of Ukraine]] to undertake actions which would [[Foreign interference in the 2020 United States elections|have the effect of helping Trump's 2020 re-election campaign]].

I, p. 4: At the same time the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0\". The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.</ref> To establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, investigators used the legal standard for criminal [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] rather than the popular concept of \"collusion\", because a crime of \"collusion\" is not found in criminal law or the [[United States Code]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morais |first1=Betsy |title=Collusion by any other name |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php |date=April 18, 2019 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |accessdate=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol.

A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Trump was a businessman and [[reality television]] personality from [[New York City]] at the time of his [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] victory over [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]]. While Trump lost the popular vote by nearly three million votes, he won the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] vote, 304 to 227,<!-- WP:CWW the following was copied from the lead of Donald Trump 20 Feb 2019; it is from an earlier RFC there; wikilink snf some similar cites added. --> in a presidential contest that American intelligence agencies concluded was targeted by [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|a Russian interference campaign]]. Trump has made many false or misleading statements during his campaign and presidency. The statements have been documented by fact-checkers, with political scientists and historians widely describing the phenomenon as unprecedented in modern American politics.<!-- End of CWW material --> Trump's approval rating has been stable, hovering at high-30 to mid-40 percent throughout his presidency.\n\nTrump rolled back numerous [[Environmental policy of the Donald Trump administration|environmental protections]], as well as reduced enforcement of existing regulations. He ended the [[Clean Power Plan]], [[United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement|withdrew]] from the [[Paris Agreement]] on [[climate change mitigation]], and urged for subsidies to increase fossil fuel production, calling man-made climate change a hoax. Trump failed in his efforts to repeal the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA), but took numerous actions that hindered the functioning of the ACA, as well as sought to have the courts rule the entirety of the ACA unconstitutional. Despite pledges made as a candidate, President Trump sought substantial spending cuts to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]] and [[Social Security Disability Insurance]]. He enacted [[Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act|a partial repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act]] that had previously imposed stricter constraints on banks in the aftermath of the [[2008 financial crisis]] and withdrew from the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]]. Trump signed the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]], which lowered corporate and estate taxes permanently, and lowered most individual income tax rates temporarily while increasing them for some. He enacted [[Trump tariffs|tariffs]] on steel and aluminum imports and other goods, triggering retaliatory tariffs from [[Canada]], [[Mexico]] and the [[European Union]], and [[2018 China\u2013United States trade war|a trade war with China]]. These tariffs adversely affected the U.S. economy. On the whole, the economy kept improving, following trends from the Obama presidency. However, the federal deficit soared under Trump due to spending increases and tax cuts.\n\nTrump's \"America First\" foreign policy has featured more unilateral American actions, disregarding the advice and support of many traditional allies while drawing the United States closer to others like [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Israel]]. Despite pledges to reduce the U.S. military personnel deployed overseas, the number was essentially the same three years into Trump's presidency as they were at the end of Obama's. Trump's administration [[2017 United States\u2013Saudi Arabia arms deal|agreed to sell $110 billion of arms to Saudi Arabia]], [[United States recognition of Jerusalem as Israeli capital|recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel]], and issued [[Executive Order 13769|a controversial executive order]] denying entry into the U.S. to citizens from several Muslim-majority countries. His administration [[American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War|withdrew U.S. troops]] from northern Syria, allowing [[2019 Rojava offensive|Turkey to attack American-allied Kurds]]. The Trump administration unilaterally decided to hold talks with North Korea, with Trump saying he and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un \"fell in love\". Trump [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|withdrew the United States from the Iran Deal]], and escalated the dispute with Iran by assassinating Iranian General [[Qasem Soleimani]]. [[Mexico\u2013United States barrier#Trump administration|Trump's demand for federal funding of a U.S.\u2013Mexico border wall]] resulted in [[United States federal government shutdown of 2018\u20132019|the 2018\u20132019 government shutdown]] (the longest in American history) and followed with Trump's declaration of a [[National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States|national emergency regarding the U.S. southern border]]. He ended the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] (DACA) program which had provided temporary protection for undocumented immigrants brought into the U.S. as minors. The Trump administration implemented a family separation policy for migrants apprehended at the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, controversially separating parents from their children, resulting in bipartisan condemnation and international outcry.\n\nAfter Trump [[Dismissal of James Comey|dismissed]] FBI Director [[James Comey]] in May 2017, a former FBI director, [[Robert Mueller]], was appointed as [[Special Counsel investigation (2017\u20132019)|special counsel]] to take over [[Operation Crossfire Hurricane|a prior FBI investigation]] into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in the 2016 elections]] and related matters, including coordination or [[Links between Trump associates and Russian officials|links]] between the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump campaign]] and the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]]. Six Trump campaign advisers and staff were indicted and five pled guilty to [[Criminal charges brought in the Special Counsel investigation (2017\u20132019)|criminal charges]]. Trump repeatedly denied [[Conspiracy|collusion]] or [[obstruction of justice]], and frequently criticized the investigation, calling it a politically motivated \"[[Witch hunt#Figurative use of the term|witch hunt]]\". Mueller concluded his investigation in March 2019, with a report of the probe showing Russia interfered to favor Trump's candidacy and hinder Clinton's. The report concluded the prevailing evidence \"did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government\" but documented ten actions by the Trump presidency that could be construed as obstruction of justice. The Mueller team could not indict Trump once investigators decided to abide by an [[Office of Legal Counsel]] (OLC) opinion that a sitting president cannot stand trial, and did not exonerate Trump on this issue. Barr and Deputy Attorney General [[Rod Rosenstein]] decided the evidence was not sufficient to demonstrate a criminal offense of obstruction. Barr later said he had not exonerated Trump.\n\n[[United States House of Representatives|The House of Representatives]] launched [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump|an impeachment inquiry]] following a September 2019 report that Trump had [[Abuse of power|abused his presidential power]] by [[Trump-Ukraine scandal|pressuring the president of Ukraine]] to undertake actions which would [[Foreign interference in the 2020 United States elections|have the effect of helping Trump's 2020 re-election campaign]]. Among other inducements, Trump ordered congressionally-mandated military aid for Ukraine to be withheld. Witnesses subsequently testified that he and his surrogates had been carrying out that pressure campaign for months. On December 18, 2019, Trump became the third president in American history to be [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|impeached]].

I, p. 4: At the same time the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0\". The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.</ref> To establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, investigators used the legal standard for criminal [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] rather than the popular concept of \"collusion\", because a crime of \"collusion\" is not found in criminal law or the [[United States Code]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morais |first1=Betsy |title=Collusion by any other name |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php |date=April 18, 2019 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |accessdate=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol.
