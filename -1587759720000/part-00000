A number of historians have argued convincingly that North-[[J\u00e6ren]] was an economic and military centre as far back as the 9th and 10th centuries with the consolidation of the nation at the [[Battle of Hafrsfjord]] around 872. Stavanger grew into a center of church administration and an important south-west coast [[market town]] around 1100\u20131300.<ref>''Phenomenology and the pioneer settlement on the Western Scandinavian Peninsula''  (Ingrid Fuglestvedt (2009) Lindome : Bricoleur Press) {{ISBN|978-91-85411-07-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Stavanger domkyrkje edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stavanger domkirke]], the oldest [[cathedral]] in Norway.]]\n\nStavanger fulfilled an urban role prior to its status as city (1125), from around the time the Stavanger bishopric was established in the 1120s. Bishop Reinald, who may have come from [[Winchester]], England, is said to have started construction of [[Stavanger Cathedral]] (''Stavanger domkirke'') around 1100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16076a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Ancient See of Stavanger|work=newadvent.org}}</ref> It was finished around 1125, and the city of Stavanger counts 1125 as its year of foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uarctic.org/SingleNewsArticle.aspx?m=668&amid=6229|title=UArctic Education \u2013 Student Portal|work=uarctic.org|access-date=7 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707155026/http://www.uarctic.org/SingleNewsArticle.aspx?m=668&amid=6229|archive-date=7 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWith the [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1536, Stavanger's role as a religious center declined, and the establishment of [[Kristiansand]] in the early 17th century led to the relocation of the bishopric. However, rich herring fisheries in the 19th century gave the city new life.\n\nStavanger was established as a municipality 1 January 1838 (see [[formannskapsdistrikt]]). On 1 January 1867, a small area of [[Hetland]] municipality (population: 200) was transferred to the city of Stavanger.  Again on 1 January 1879, another area of Hetland (population: 1,357) was transferred to Stavanger.  Then again on 1 January 1906, the city again annexed another area of Hetland (population: 399).  On 1 July 1923, part of Hetland (population: 3,063) was moved to the city once again.  Finally on 1 July 1953, a final portion of Hetland (population: 831) was moved to Stavanger. In the 1960s, the work of the [[Schei Committee]] pushed for many municipal mergers across Norway.  As a result of this, on 1 January 1965, the city of Stavanger (population: 51,470) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of [[Madla (municipality)|Madla]] (population: 6,025) and most of [[Hetland]] (population: 20,861).<ref>{{cite web|first=Dag|last=Jukvam|publisher=[[Statistics Norway|Statistisk sentralbyr\u00e5]]|title=Historisk oversikt over endringer i kommune \u2013 og fylkesinndelingen|year=1999|url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/90/rapp_9913/rapp_9913.pdf|language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nThe city's history is a continuous alternation between economic booms and recessions.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stavanger.kommune.no/publikum/divsvg.nsf/svgbyhistorie/$first?opendocument&referer=Byhistorie&sub=1 |title=Stavanger kommune \u2013 Byhistorie<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=24 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928093934/http://www.stavanger.kommune.no/publikum/divsvg.nsf/svgbyhistorie/$first?opendocument&referer=Byhistorie&sub=1 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> For long periods of time its most important industries have been [[shipping]], [[shipbuilding]], the fish [[canning industry]] and associated subcontractors.\n\nIn 1969, a new boom started as oil was first discovered in the North Sea.\n<ref name=\"Stavanger kommune - Byhistorie\">[http://www.stavanger.kommune.no/publikum/Divsvg.nsf/SVGbyhistorie/3952B80210417C4EC12568E30035DD1D?OpenDocument&referer=byhistorie&sub=3 Stavanger kommune \u2013 Byhistorie<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621024226/http://www.stavanger.kommune.no/publikum/Divsvg.nsf/SVGbyhistorie/3952B80210417C4EC12568E30035DD1D?OpenDocument&referer=byhistorie&sub=3 |date=21 June 2008 }}</ref>\nAfter much discussion, Stavanger was chosen to be the on-shore center for the oil industry on the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, and a period of hectic growth followed.<ref name=\"Stavanger kommune - Byhistorie\"/>\n\nOn 1 January 2020, the municipalities of [[Finn\u00f8y]], [[Rennes\u00f8y]], and Stavanger are scheduled to merge into one, large municipality called Stavanger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nye.stavanger.kommune.no/om-nye-stavanger/|title=Om nye Stavanger|language=Norwegian|accessdate=4 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===City development===\n{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}\nStavanger is one of [[Norway]]'s [[List of towns and cities in Norway|oldest cities]]. It emerged in the 12th century during a period of population growth and increasing urbanization throughout [[northern Europe]]. The [[archaeological]] and historical sources about the first city development are sparse. Therefore, there is much we do not know about the first city development. It stands out as an important area from early times, as a desirable foothold for the [[monarchy]] and the church, as both needed a strong foothold in the [[Western Norway|South West coast]] area. In North [[J\u00e6ren]], rich archaeological material suggests that the chiefs held considerable power from the early [[Iron Age]]. Stavanger had a natural harbor and was, with J\u00e6ren in the south, strategically important to the county of the East as well as to the shipping route along the western coast and the fertile [[Ryfylke]] Islands in the north.\n\nThe earliest [[Christianity|Christian]] impulses in [[Norway]] came to Stavanger region through trade connections with Continental Europe and [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Great Britain]]. This flourished during the [[Viking]] era. In the mid 10th century, traditional Norse burial customs ceased in the Stavanger area, at the same time as the first Christian [[priests]] began their work. Big stone crosses are visible memorials of this early Christian age (including the Tjora and Kvits\u00f8y). On the overland approach to Stavanger, a memorial cross of HERS and [[lendmann]] [[Erling Skjalgsson]] was erected after his fall in 1028. Erling controlled power over the South West coast, and the location of the cross indicates that he had a special connection to Stavanger. The inscription on the cross shows a priest was responsible for the inscription, and he may have performed an early service at a church on site.\n\nArchaeological investigations in the current downtown and in the crypt of the [[Stavanger Cathedral|Cathedral]] show that the great fire of 1272 probably left large parts of the city and the cathedral in ruins, including the Romanesque chancel of the cathedral. The reconstruction after the fire led to the cathedral's Western Front being replaced with a vestibule, as well as to the construction (or reconstruction) of [[St. Mary]]'s Church, Bishop's Chapel, the Gothic cathedral and the expansion of the stone cellar at [[Kongsberg]].\n\nStavanger has a long history of education in [[Western Europe]]. It was the monastery here that first saw the need to train new employees through education. The first organized teaching in the city probably took place at a Benedictine monastery in the town, either Olav's Monastery or Monastery of people from the mid-12th century.\n\nOne of the most important events in Stavanger's city history was the gift letter that King [[Magnus Erlingsson]] gave to Stavanger Bishop Eirik Ivarsson in the second half of 1100. Exactly when the king made this gift letter, and under what circumstances it happened is unknown. It may have been in 1163\u20131164, in connection with the King Magnus's coronation, but could also have been around 1181\u20131184, in connection with the support Stavanger Bishop Erik gave King Magnus at the end of the king's fight against the late [[King Sverre]].\n\nIt is undoubtedly correct to characterize Stavanger as a church city throughout the [[Middle Ages]], up to the [[Reformation]]. The Reformation, however, dealt a hard blow to the Church in specific and Stavanger in general. The cathedral, the bishop and canons of the monastery had been large landowners. Recession of the city began with the loss of people in rural areas, as a result of which the revenues of the cathedral and the bishop fell dramatically due to reduced rental income. In 1537 the bishop's and the monastery's estate and property was confiscated by the king. Kongsberg was plundered by Christoffer Trondsen in 1539, at which time St. Swithun's casket disappeared and Bishop Hoskuld Hoskuldsson may have been executed.\n\n===World War II===\n{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}\nIn a prelude to the invasion, on 8 April, the German freighter {{MS|Roda|1928|2}} (6780 grt.) anchored by Ulsnes. ''Roda'' was reportedly loaded with [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], but customs officials and police authorities became suspicious about other cargo when they observed that the ship was not riding deep in the water. The ship was boarded and was ordered to move to Riska. However, ''Roda'' did not move, and the captain of the {{HNoMS|\u00c6ger|1936|2}}, [[Niels Larsen Bruun]], decided on his own initiative to sink the ship. After sending the crew off in lifeboats, ''\u00c6ger'' used 25 shots with {{convert|10|cm|adj=on}} Bofors guns to sink ''Roda''.\n\nEarly on the morning of 9 April 1940, explosions and bomb blasts from [[Sola]]-edge and news bulletins on radio announced the German attack on [[Norway]]. [[Stavanger Airport, Sola|Sola Airport]] was the Germans' first target on North [[J\u00e6ren]]. The airport was attacked by six German Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters around 8 am. The airport had been built in 1937, and in April 1940 fortifications round the airport were not yet complete. Fortifications consisted of a concrete [[bunker]] still under construction and several open shooting positions. Armament consisted of three heavy anti-aircraft machine guns, three heavy machine guns configured for ground targets, and some light machine guns at the disposal of the approximately 80 soldiers who defended the airport. The bomber wing was transferred to Sola Airport in 1939, but the planes, a total of six Fokker and three Caproni aircraft, were old and outdated. Shortly after the attack began, however, they took off.\n\nThe German air attack increased in intensity. The [[bombardment]] lasted for about an hour before ten slow Ju 52 transport aircraft arrived over the airport. They had taken off from the airport at [[Hamburg Airport|Hamburg]] a few hours earlier. In a parachute assault, the transport planes first dropped yellow containers containing weapons and equipment, then between ten and twelve paratroopers from each plane. This was only the second ever wartime parachute assault; the first had occurred only three hours earlier, when a bridge south of [[Denmark]] was captured in the same way. At the Sola airport, the concrete bunker held out longest, but was eventually put out of action with a hand grenade. While [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[soldier]]s were badly injured in the attempted defence, there were no fatalities; in contrast; the Germans lost several. Lieutenant Thor Tang, who led the Norwegian defense of the airport, capitulated at 10:00, and the Germans immediately began landing troops, fuel and other supplies. In all, 200 to 300 transport aircraft arrived in Sola during invasion day, and by evening several hundred soldiers and large quantities of materiel had been moved from Germany to Sola.\n\nBy around 12:30 on 9 April, the first German troops advanced into Stavanger without resistance. The police station, telephone office, telegraph center, post office, port office, customs house and the gas company were the most important places, and now came under control of the Germans. The city was conquered without conflict, but the first sparks of resistance had been ignited, and several men left the city and made their way to the Norwegian troops inside [[Gjesdal]], there to join the armed struggle against the enemy.\n\n[[File:Tysk fange.png|thumb|A German [[Prisoner of war|POW]] clearing mines in Stavanger in August 1945]]\nThe Germans had placed a high priority to have a good railway connection between the air base at [[Sola]] \u2013 Stavanger district, and the rest of the [[Norway|country]]. However, it was not until 29 April 1944, that the [[S\u00f8rlandsbanen|Southern Railway]] was completed to Stavanger. In 1940, the [[Germans]] had envisioned it to be completed no later than 1 November 1941.\n\nAfter [[Hitler]]'s death in 1945, Grand Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] took over leadership of the German forces, and on 9 May 1945, gave the head of the German armed forces in Norway, General [[Franz B\u00f6hme]], orders that \"Reichskommissar\" in Norway, Josef Terboven, was deposed and that all his duties were transferred to B\u00f6hme. To B\u00f6hme, in turn, he gave the task of how the capitulation of Festung Norwegen was to be implemented. There were around 15,000 German soldiers in [[Rogaland]] in 1945, and it was there where the commander of 274 Infantry Division, General Weckman, gave the formal German surrender.\n\nBefore repatriation, the Germans were required to remain and clean up after five years of occupation. There were 180 German minefields in [[Rogaland]], with a total of 480,000 mines, all of which the German Wehrmacht were required to clear. 62 Germans were killed and 94 were injured during mine clearance in Rogaland. Mines from this period continue to be uncovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/i/G7aMq/Minefunn-pa-Hellestostranden|title=Minefunn p\u00e5 Hellest\u00f8stranden|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Oil capital===\n[[File:StatfjordA(Jarvin1982).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Petroleum|oil]] industry is the backbone of Stavanger's economy.]]\nIn 1969, a new boom started as [[Petroleum|oil]] was first discovered in the [[North Sea]].\n<ref name=\"Stavanger kommune - Byhistorie\"/>\nAfter much discussion, Stavanger was chosen to be the on-shore center for the oil industry on the [[Norway|Norwegian]] sector of the North Sea, and a period of hectic growth followed.<ref name=\"Stavanger kommune - Byhistorie\"/>\n\nIn March 1965 an agreement was signed between [[Norway]] and the [[United Kingdom]] on the sharing of the continental shelf by the median line principle. That same year a similar agreement was signed between Norway and [[Denmark]]. It was designed as a legal regime for oil exploration. The first licensing round on the Norwegian shelf was announced on 13 April 1965, and in August of that same year the government granted 22 licenses for 78 blocks for oil companies or groups of companies. The production license gave oil companies exclusive rights to exploration, drilling and production in a defined geographical area for a given period at an annual fee. [[Esso]] was the first oil company to start drilling for oil off the coast of Norway. The semi-submersible drilling vessel [[Ocean Traveler]] was towed from [[New Orleans]] to Norway, and the vessel began drilling on 19 July 1966, at block 8/3, about {{convert|180|km}} southwest of Stavanger.\n\n===Coat of arms===\n[[Hallvard Tr\u00e6tteberg]] (1898\u20131987), a leading specialist in heraldry, was commissioned to design the official [[coat of arms]] of Stavanger, a work that lasted from the end of the 1920s until approved on 11 August 1939. His design is also used as the city's arms, flag, and seal. The coat of arms is based upon a seal which dated 1591. It shows a branch of [[vine]] (''[[Vitis vinifera]]''). Which leaves and branch type that is depicted on the coat of arms has been hotly debated. The original meaning and representation of the vine remains unknown.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Coat of Arms of Norway|journal=The American-Scandinavian Review|date=June 1964}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Heraldry of the World|title=Civic heraldry of Norway \u2013 Norske Kommunev\u00e5pen|url=http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Stavanger|accessdate=4 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Origin of the name===\nThe [[Old Norse]] form of the name was ''Stafangr''. The origin of the name has been discussed for decades, and the most used interpretation is that it originally was the name of the inlet now called V\u00e5gen, which was the original site of the city, on the east shore of the bay.<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nThe first element of the name is ''stafr'' meaning 'staff' or 'branch'. This could refer to the form of the inlet, but also to the form of the mountain Valberget (''Staven'' meaning 'the staff,' is a common name of high and steep mountains in Norway). The last element is ''angr'' meaning 'inlet, bay'. Facing the [[North Sea]], Stavanger has always been economically dependent on its access to the sea.<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\n==Government==\nAll municipalities in Norway, including Stavanger, are responsible for [[primary education]] (through 10th grade), outpatient [[Health care|health services]], [[old age|senior citizen]] services, [[unemployment]] and other [[Social work|social services]], [[zoning]], [[economic development]], and municipal [[road]]s.  The municipality is governed by a [[Municipal council (Norway)|municipal council]] of elected representatives, which in turn elect a [[mayor]].\n\n===Municipal council===\nThe [[Municipal council (Norway)|municipal council]] ''(Kommunestyre)'' of Stavanger is made up of 67 representatives that are elected to four year terms.

The [[Byfjorden (Rogaland)|Byfjorden]] and [[Gandsfjorden]] run along the east side of the city. It is part of the Low-[[J\u00e6ren]], a flat area of land consisting mostly of marsh, sand, and stone aur, that ranges from Ogna River in the south to Tungenes in the north; it is the northernmost part that includes Stavanger. The majority of the municipality lies between {{convert|0|and|50|m}} in elevation. The landscape has a distinctive appearance with rocks and hills where there is no settlement or agriculture. The city of Stavanger is closely linked to the sea and water, with five lakes (including [[Breiavatnet]], [[Stora Stokkavatnet]], and [[Mosvatnet]]) and three fjords ([[Hafrsfjorden]], [[Byfjorden (Rogaland)|Byfjorden]], and [[Gandsfjorden]]); sea and water form the landscape, providing a shoreline rich with vegetation and wildlife.\n\nThe terrain is low-lying: 49% of the area is less than {{convert|20|m}} above sea level, While 7% of the land is at {{convert|60|m}}. Stavanger's highest point is the {{convert|139|m|adj=on}} tall J\u00e5tt\u00e5nuten with the {{convert|136|m|adj=on}} Ullandhaug as the second highest point.\n\nThe city has developed on both sides of a hollow that runs right through the terrain, with steep slopes up from the bottom. An extension of Boknafjorden and Byfjorden intersects the harbor into the hollow from the northwest, while Hillev\u00e5g lake intrudes from Gandsfjorden in the southeast. [[Breiavatnet]] is located between the two fjord arms.\n\nThe city includes many islands off the coast including: [[Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya, Stavanger|Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8y]], [[Bu\u00f8y]], [[Eng\u00f8y]], [[Grasholmen]], [[Helles\u00f8y, Stavanger|Helles\u00f8y]], [[Hundv\u00e5g (island)|Hundv\u00e5g]], [[Kalv\u00f8y, Stavanger|Kalv\u00f8y]], [[Lind\u00f8y]], [[S\u00f8lyst, Stavanger|S\u00f8lyst]], and [[Vass\u00f8y]].  It also includes the eastern half of the island of [[\u00c5m\u00f8y]].<ref name=\"snl\">{{cite web|url=https://snl.no/Stavanger|title=Stavanger|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=27 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Parks===\n{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Byparken Stavanger2.JPG|thumb|The city park]]\nThere are several parks and green spots in Stavanger municipality, both in the city and beyond. Central to the town is the city lake which is in turn surrounded by the city park, built as the city's first urban park in 1866\u20131868. Between the city park and the bay is located [[Kielland]] garden, which got its name because the poet [[Alexander Kielland]]'s house at the time was here. Kielland Park went through a major renovation in 2007 as part of the Millennium in Stavanger municipality. At the opposite end of the city lake there is a small park outside the station; here there is [[Emigration]], a gift from the Norwegian emigrants in the [[United States]], commemorating the men and women of [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] ancestry who built America.\n\nBjergstedparken, a park north of [[Gamle Stavanger|Old Stavanger]], is the location of Bjergsted Music Center, including [[Stavanger Concert Hall]], and its outdoor areas are often used for festivals and outdoor concerts. The Missing park, built in honor of Lars Missing, is located up the hill on the west side of the harbor, and forms the entrance from the south towards the Old Town. Canon park forms the border between Stavanger and the exit from the [[European route E39|E39]]. Northward go L\u00f8kkeveien against Bjergsted westward go Madlaveien the theater and Bergelandstunnelen, east towards E39. The park is located next to old Stavanger Hospital, which also has a large park area around the main building. Through the park runs Kannik creek, which comes to the surface at the statue of the Little Mermaid and runs into Breiavannet. Kannikkbekken runs mostly underground, in pipes, before it reaches Kannik park.\n\nOutside the city center, the park southerly in relation to the large inland lakes such as [[Mosvatnet]], [[Stora Stokkavatnet]] and Water Assen. Mosvatnet is {{convert|0.46|km2|acres}} making it the third largest in Stavanger after H\u00e5landsvatnet and Store Stokkavatn. The lake supplied the city's drinking water from 1863 to 1931, and is now by far the most used recreation area in Stavanger. The path around the lake is {{convert|3.2|km}} long, and much used by cyclist and joggers; sampling conducted in 1995 showed that an estimated 560,000 people used the walking trail around Mosvatnet. At the south end is Mosvangen Camping, Stavanger Sv\u00f8mmestadion old man and V\u00e5landskogen, and to the west is Rogaland Kunstmuseum. Stora Stokkavatnet is {{convert|2.19|km2}} \u2013 the largest in Stavanger. Right at Stora Stokkavatnet is the {{convert|0.15|km2|adj=on}} Litla Stokkavatnet. The hiking trail around the lakes is {{convert|8.2|km}} long. In the lake is a small island, Storeholmen. Store Stokkavatnet supplied Stavanger's drinking water from 1931 to 1959, and was later demoted to the reserve drinking water. In 2009 it was relegated once more, and it is now legal to swim in the water.\n\n===Climate===\nStavanger is located on a peninsula on the southwest coast of Norway. The climate is greatly influenced by the [[Gulf Stream]] which creates warmer temperatures throughout the year compared to other cities at similar latitudes. According to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Stavanger experiences an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') with five months with a mean temperature above {{convert|10|C}}. The city has also a slight continental climate influence which can create subzero lows during winter. The city is relatively wet with an annual average of {{convert|1180|mm}} of precipitation.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Stavanger Airport (Sola), Rogaland (Normals: 1961\u20131990, Extremes: 1944\u20131993)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n\n|Jan record high C = 10.0\n|Feb record high C = 10.0\n|Mar record high C = 18.2\n|Apr record high C = 25.0\n|May record high C = 26.1\n|Jun record high C = 29.7\n|Jul record high C = 31.1\n|Aug record high C = 34.0\n|Sep record high C = 25.0\n|Oct record high C = 20.0\n|Nov record high C = 13.9\n|Dec record high C = 11.3\n\n|Jan high C = 4\n|Feb high C = 4\n|Mar high C = 6\n|Apr high C = 10\n|May high C = 15\n|Jun high C = 17\n|Jul high C = 19\n|Aug high C = 19\n|Sep high C = 16\n|Oct high C = 12\n|Nov high C = 8\n|Dec high C = 5\n|year high C = 11.3\n\n|Jan mean C = 2\n|Feb mean C = 1.5\n|Mar mean C = 3.5\n|Apr mean C = 6.5\n|May mean C = 11\n|Jun mean C = 13.5\n|Jul mean C = 15.5\n|Aug mean C = 15.5\n|Sep mean C = 13\n|Oct mean C = 9.5\n|Nov mean C = 6\n|Dec mean C = 3\n|year mean C = 8.4\n\n|Jan low C = 0\n|Feb low C = -1\n|Mar low C = 1\n|Apr low C = 3\n|May low C = 7\n|Jun low C = 10\n|Jul low C = 12\n|Aug low C = 12\n|Sep low C = 10\n|Oct low C = 7\n|Nov low C = 4\n|Dec low C = 1\n|year low C = 5.5\n\n|Jan record low C = -18.9\n|Feb record low C = -17.2\n|Mar record low C = -12.0\n|Apr record low C = -7.8\n|May record low C = -2.0\n|Jun record low C = 1.0\n|Jul record low C = 4.0\n|Aug record low C = 3.0\n|Sep record low C = -1.1\n|Oct record low C = -3.9\n|Nov record low C = -16.0\n|Dec record low C = -16.1\n\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 92\n|Feb precipitation mm = 66\n|Mar precipitation mm = 75\n|Apr precipitation mm = 50\n|May precipitation mm = 68\n|Jun precipitation mm = 73\n|Jul precipitation mm = 91\n|Aug precipitation mm = 115\n|Sep precipitation mm = 156\n|Oct precipitation mm = 148\n|Nov precipitation mm = 136\n|Dec precipitation mm = 110\n\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 13.7\n|Feb precipitation days = 10.4\n|Mar precipitation days = 11.9\n|Apr precipitation days = 9.9\n|May precipitation days = 10.7\n|Jun precipitation days = 10.6\n|Jul precipitation days = 10.8\n|Aug precipitation days = 14.0\n|Sep precipitation days = 16.9\n|Oct precipitation days = 16.7\n|Nov precipitation days = 17.7\n|Dec precipitation days = 15.6\n\n|Jan humidity = 82\n|Feb humidity = 81\n|Mar humidity = 78\n|Apr humidity = 77\n|May humidity = 75\n|Jun humidity = 78\n|Jul humidity = 78\n|Aug humidity = 80\n|Sep humidity = 80\n|Oct humidity = 81\n|Nov humidity = 82\n|Dec humidity = 82\n\n|Jan sun = 48\n|Feb sun = 79\n|Mar sun = 140\n|Apr sun = 168\n|May sun = 226\n|Jun sun = 222\n|Jul sun = 197\n|Aug sun = 159\n|Sep sun = 141\n|Oct sun = 80\n|Nov sun = 45\n|Dec sun = 33\n|year sun = 1538.\n| source 1 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]]<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = https://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_014150_kt.pdf\n| title = Klimatafel von Stavanger, Prov.

In the first half of the century it was known for [[canning]], and in the 1950s there were over 50 canneries in town. The town was even called Norway \"canned capital\", and included [[Christian Bjelland I|Christian Bjelland]], who founded Chr Bjelland & Co. A/S. The last of these factories were closed down in 2002.\n\nAround 1950, over half of the working population in the city employed in [[industry]]. Structural changes in industry and the strong development of the service industry has radically changed the city's economic base, and the service industry now represents over 11 percent of employment. However, the city still has 29 percent of the county's industrial [[employment]].\n\nEngineering is now the main industry with 59 percent of manufacturing employment. This is mostly related to the offshore petroleum industry, and production of oil platforms alone account for 40 percent. Other important industries are publishing \u2013 especially high printing and the major daily newspapers in town, [[Stavanger Aftenblad|Stavanger and Rogaland Avis Aftenblad]] \u2013 and food and beverage, which includes the processing of local agricultural products from J\u00e6ren, including Gilde Vest with one of the largest slaughterhouses.\n\nEmployment by place of work and industry in 2007 to 0.6% in primary, 27.4% in secondary and tertiary industries 71.7%. Employment by place of work by sector in 2007 to 24.4% in the public sector and 75.6% in the private sector and public enterprises.\n\nIndustry has in recent years become highly decentralized. The most important of the newer industrial areas are [[Forus]] in the south, on the border of [[Sandnes]] and [[Sola]], and [[Dusavik]] (mainly petroleum-related activities) in the north, on the border of Randfontein. Significant older industrial areas are [[Hillev\u00e5g]], [[Bu\u00f8y]], the eastern districts, and in some places elsewhere along the coast. Shipbuilding and shipping has also traditionally been of great importance to the city's economic growth, and Rosenberg Shipyard, established in 1896, is located on [[Hundv\u00e5g (island)|Hundv\u00e5g]]. Today Stavanger is also among the country's most important [[Sea|maritime]] cities, coming in fourth for registered fleets after the cities of [[Oslo]], [[Bergen]] and [[\u00c5lesund]].\n\nFor the fourth consecutive year, [[Greater Stavanger|Stavanger Region]] was in 2007 ranked best business region. Telemarksforsking Bo worked with Ministry NM to rank the regions in [[Norway]] with regard to profitability, growth and new businesses.\n\n===Media===\n{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Aftenbladet.jpg|thumb|[[Stavanger Aftenblad]]]]\n\nThe city's largest daily newspaper, [[Stavanger Aftenblad]] came out with its first issue in 1893. Competitor [[Rogalands Avis]] was first published in 1899 under the name ''1ste Mai'' ('1 May'), and published daily. In 1987 an attempt was made to establish a new daily newspaper, The West Coast, but it was only released for two months and ended with a total loss of NOK 27 million.\n\nThe first newspaper published in Stavanger, \"Stavangerske Adressecontoirs Efterretninger\", was a handwritten weekly newspaper that probably came out in 1769 and 1770. This was not an ordinary newspaper, but a so-called link newspaper with the privilege of bringing out announcements, small articles and ads. The first ''printed'' newspaper in Stavanger, \"Stavanger Addresseavis\", published its first issue on Friday, 4 October 1833.\n\n[[Stavanger Avis]] was published from 1888 until 1911. Writer and local Alexander L. Kielland was editor in 1889. Stavanger Avis was also the name of the newspaper that came out from 1942 to 1945, when Stavanger Aftenblad and Stavangeren were merged by the Press Directorate.\n\nStudent newspaper ''SMiS'' (Studentmediene i Stavanger) comes out every other month.\n\nStavanger has one principal television station, TV Vest, that sends local news and reports. Additionally, Viking TV, the channel for the football team [[Viking FK]], started on 2 March 2008, and is distributed via Lyse's broadband network, reaching 120,000 viewers in 45,000 households. [[NRK]] [[Rogaland]] supplies local news broadcasts on radio and television. Local radio stations also provide local news and reports.\n\n===Agriculture and food===\n{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}\nStavanger region is often referred to as Norway's answer to the French food region of [[Lyon]].  The Culinary Institute, headquartered in [[Ullandhaug]], provided a very important focus on food in Stavanger. After the Culinary Institute went bankrupt, partly due to activities in [[Oslo]] on 4 June 2008, a new culinary organization was established by the Foundation Rogaland knowledge park and [[Rogaland]] County Council. This new institute, now also known as The Culinary Institute, maintained parts of the work of the original organization, and eventually bought back the name, logo and brand ''Culinary Institute'' from the bankruptcy estate.\n\nIn summer 2007, the region's culinary actors were awarded the title \"Norwegian Centres of Expertise in Culinology.\" The building under construction at Ullandhaug will serve as a platform and innovative arena, not only for the region's R & D environment, but also for other expertise among both industry and the public. In July 2008 the Stavanger European championship qualified for the Bocuse d' Or. In 2008, Norway was represented by Geir Skeie, who also won gold. Every year there is a \"Happy Food Festival\" in the city center. The festival originated in the network of [[Rogaland]] county so that they could impart culinary traditions of the region. By 2020, Stavanger region intends to be the region most Norwegians associate with food products and culinary experiences.\n\n===Oil industry===\n{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}\nIn recent times, the city has come to be called the \"oil capital,\" and Norway's national and largest oil company, [[Equinor]], is headquartered at [[Forus]], in Stavanger. Equinor(at the time known as Statoil) was founded as a limited company owned by the [[Government of Norway]] on 14 July 1972 by a unanimous act passed by the Norwegian parliament [[Stortinget]], to enable Norwegian participation in the oil industry on the continental shelf, to build up Norwegian competency within the petroleum industry, and to establish the foundations of a domestic petroleum industry. Establishing Equinor's headquarters in Stavanger naturally led to Stavanger becoming the center of the oil industry. [[Petoro]], a Norwegian state-owned company responsible for managing the commercial aspects of the state's direct financial interest in petroleum activities on the Norwegian continental shelf, also has its headquarters in the city. With the center of the national oil industry in Stavanger, several other international oil companies have also made their headquarters in Stavanger.\n\n[[File:Troll A Platform.jpg|thumb|The concrete base for the Troll A platform is cast in Vats, 55&nbsp;km north of Stavanger]]\n\nNPD was created in 1972 by Ullandhaug and PSA was established on 1 January 2004 and co-located with the agency, as a regulatory body.\n\n[[J\u00e5tt\u00e5v\u00e5gen]], on [[Gandsfjorden]], was from the 1970s to the 1990s a large industrial area, particularly for the construction of large concrete Condeep platforms and oil platforms for the offshore industry. Among others, the Condeep jacket for the three Gullfaks platforms and Troll A were cast here by Norwegian Contractors.\n\nOffshore Northern Seas is the second largest exhibition of its kind in the oil and gas industry. ONS takes place in Stavanger during the last week of August every other year. In 2008, there were 38,000 visitors, half of whom came from abroad.\n\n===Tourism===\nStavanger is a popular tourist destination, especially in summer. The hotels in the city have good occupancy year round due to a lot of commuters who travel to work and meetings in Stavanger. In recent years, Stavanger has also become one of the most popular ports of call for cruise ships, with the number of cruise ships increasing steadily, making Stavanger one of [[Europe]]'s fastest growing ports of call for cruise ships north of the [[Mediterranean]]. [[File:Cruise ship Stavanger Norway.jpg|thumb|P&O MV Britannia cruise ship at berth near Strandkaien, Stavanger]]\n\n==Transport==\n{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Airport===\n[[File:ENZV Aerial 2011.JPG|thumb|[[Stavanger Airport, Sola]]]]\n[[Stavanger Airport, Sola]], is located in [[Sola]], 14 minutes away from Stavanger City Center. The airport opened in 1937. In 1940 [[Stavanger Airport, Forus]], opened, but closed in 1989. In 2013 Sola airport had over 4 million passengers and was the largest airport in [[Rogaland]] county. It is also the 3rd largest airport in [[List of airports in Norway|Norway]] and 7th in the [[List of the busiest airports in the Nordic countries|Nordic]] countries. The busiest route is [[Oslo-Gardermoen]], with over 1,5 million passengers; the second most popular is [[Bergen Airport, Flesland]], with over 700,000 passengers; [[Oslo-Torp]] is the third most popular, followed by [[Trondheim Airport, V\u00e6rnes]] and [[Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik]] domestically. Internationally, the busiest routes are [[Copenhagen Airport|Copenhagen]], [[Amsterdam Airport|Amsterdam]], and [[Aberdeen Airport|Aberdeen]]. Stavanger also has connections to domestic and European destinations, including [[Heathrow Airport|London]], [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris]], [[Barcelona Airport|Barcelona]], [[Arlanda Airport|Stockholm]], [[Chopin Airport|Warsaw]]. Domestic destinations are all the way up from [[Troms\u00f8 Airport|Troms\u00f8]] down to [[Kristiansand Airport|Kristiansand]].\n\n===Railway===\n[[File:Stavanger stasjon 2013-04-28 10.34.24.jpg|thumb|[[Stavanger Station|Stavanger S]]]]\n[[Stavanger Station|Stavanger S]] opened in 1878 and is the terminus of both the [[S\u00f8rlandet Line]] and the [[J\u00e6ren Line]].\n\n[[S\u00f8rlandsbanen|The Southern Railway]] goes from [[Oslo S]] to [[Drammen Station|Drammen]], to [[Kristiansand Station|Kristiansand S]], to, finally, [[Stavanger Station|Stavanger S]]. This route, 545 kilometers (339&nbsp;mi) between Oslo and Stavanger, is scheduled over four times every day and takes around seven hours. The railway was constructed in several phases, the first section being opened in 1871 and the last not opened until 1944. While there was continual construction work from [[Oslo]] westward as far as Moi, the [[J\u00e6ren Line]], from [[Egersund]] to Stavanger in [[Western Norway]], was opened in 1878. Up to 1913 the name used on plans and for the completed sections was the Vestlandet Line (The West Country Line).\n\nThere are also local trains in [[J\u00e6ren]] with 19 stops on one line. The line opened as a 1,067&nbsp;mm (3&nbsp;ft 6 in) narrow gauge stand-alone line on 27 February 1878. The railway was extended from [[Egersund]] to [[Flekkefjord]] as the [[Flekkefjord Line]] in 1904. The [[J\u00e6ren Line]]'s only branch, the [[\u00c5lg\u00e5rd]] Line from [[Ganddal]] to [[\u00c5lg\u00e5rd]], opened in 1924. In 1944, the [[S\u00f8rlandet Line]] was extended to [[Sira, Norway|Sira]] on the [[Flekkefjord Line]], and the [[J\u00e6ren Line]] was integrated into the main railway network. Because of this, the line was converted to standard gauge.\n\n===Roads===\n[[File:Btd rv44 sandnes.png|thumb|National road 44]]\n[[European route E39]] goes through Stavanger from [[Haugesund]] and the [[Mastrafjord Tunnel]] and [[Byfjord Tunnel]], then goes south to [[Sandnes]]. Fylkesvei 44 starts from Stavanger and ends in [[Kristiansand]], via [[Sandnes]] and [[Flekkefjord]].\n\nNational road 509 runs between Stavanger, via [[Tananger]] arm [[Stavanger Airport, Sola]] Cross and [[Forus]], the [[European route E39]], and between National road 44 and [[European route E39|E39]] at [[Malmheim og Soma|Soma]] in [[Sandnes]]. The road length is 19.5&nbsp;km (+ new part).\n\nBefore 1 January 2010, the county road 509 part of the way.\n\nOn 18 December 2012, the new engine traffic road Solasplitten opened as a new thoroughfare eastward, north of [[Forus]] and the [[European route E39]].\n\nThere are two tunnel projects planned: [[Ryfast]] ([[Ryfylke Tunnel]] and [[Hundv\u00e5g Tunnel]]) and [[Rogfast]].\n\n===Sea===\n\nLocated outside Stavanger, there is a port serving ferries to [[Hirtshals]], Denmark. There have been advocates for the [[Smyril Line]] ferry between the [[Faroe Islands]] and Denmark to make a stop in Stavanger as the new port in Risavika allows this to be done while only adding one hour to the total sailing time.\n\nLocal ferries go to [[Tau, Norway|Tau]] and [[Kvits\u00f8y]], while fast passenger boats go to many villages and islands between the main routes from Stavanger to [[Haugesund]] and [[Sauda]].\n\nThere are plans to reestablish the [[Newcastle\u2013Bergen\u2013Stavanger ferry|ferry link to Newcastle]] in the United Kingdom, which was suspended in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2012/08/27/north-shields-to-norway-ferry-plan-raises-job-hopes-61634-31703489/|title=North Shields to Norway ferry plan raises job hopes|author=Adrian Pearson|date=27 August 2012|work=journallive}}</ref>\n\n===Bus===\n[[File:Sandnes 01.jpg|thumb|Bus terminal in [[Sandnes]], the neighboring city of Stavanger]]\n\nThe local bus service in Stavanger is administered by Rogaland Kollektivtrafikk (RKT) under the brand name \"[[Kolumbus]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kolumbus.no/|title=Kolumbus AS|work=kolumbus.no}}</ref> The buses are operated by Boreal Transport. RKT administers all bus routes in Rogaland County.\n\nExpress bus services are operated by [[NOR-WAY Bussekspress]] from Stavanger City Terminal to [[Kristiansand]], Bergen and Haugesund, and by [[Lavprisekspressen]] to Oslo via Kristiansand.\n\nThe city has a number of bus services and taxis.\n\n==Education==\n{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}\n[[University of Stavanger]] (UIS) is the fifth university established in Norway, on 29 October 2004, when the University of Stavanger (HiS) gained university status by decision of the Council. The university has about 9,000 students and 1,200 employees and is organized into three faculties: Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences and the Faculty of Science. The [[archaeological museum]] is also part of the university. The campus is located in [[Ullandhaug]], with most departments located there. [[John B. M\u00f8st]] was employed as a university in 2011. Marit Boyesen was selected as the principal for the period 2011 to 2015, and started her tenure as rector 1 August 2011. As rector, she is the head of the academic activities of the University of Stavanger as well as Chairman of the University Board. The University of Stavanger became a member of [[European Consortium of Innovative Universities]] (ECIU) in October 2012.\n\nThe [[VID Specialized University]] has a long history in the city. This university began as the School of Mission and Theology or Misjonsh\u00f8gskolen (MHS), being established in 1843 and accredited in 2008 as a research university. It has about 300 students from approximately 20 countries. MHS is owned by the [[Norwegian Missionary Society]]. The Centre for Intercultural Communication (SIK) is associated with the college's mission. In 2016 it became part of the VID Specialized University.\n\n[[File:J\u00e5tt\u00e5 videreg\u00e5ende skole.JPG|thumb|[[J\u00e5tt\u00e5 Upper Secondary School]]]]\n\nThe Art School in [[Rogaland]] was established in 1978, with a history back to 1957.\n\nThe Scandinavian School of Management offers college studies in Marketing and Management.

The city's most visited museum is the [[Norwegian Petroleum Museum]], opened in 1998. In its ten years of visitation records, from 1998 to 2008, almost 95,000 people visited the museum annually.\n\nThe city's oldest museum is Missjonmuseet, established in 1864, located on the ground floor of the faculty building at MHS. The museum has about 5,000 exhibits consisting of several objects of ethnographic and historical interest from the various mission fields of study.\n\n[[Stavanger Museum]], founded in 1877 and thus one of the oldest museums, includes several historic buildings and collections. Stavanger Museum consists of a total of eight buildings: Stavanger Museum Mus\u00e9gata 16, Stavanger Maritime Museum, the Norwegian Canning Museum, [[Ledaal]], Breidablikkveien museum, combined indretning, Norwegian Printing Museum and the Norwegian Children's Museum. In the main museum are now a cultural department, a zoological collection, and a library.\n\nMuseum of Archaeology in Stavanger is the largest museum in Stavanger, measured by number of employees. AmS is a state museum for the prehistoric sites in [[Rogaland]], and is part of the [[University of Stavanger]]. The museum also conducts extensive outreach activities, and has facilities fairly close to Stavanger Museum.\n\n[[File:Rogaland Kunstmuseum.jpg|thumb|Rogaland Art Museum]]\n\nRogaland Art Museum, located by a park, has paintings by Norwegian artist [[Edvard Munch]], [[Christian Krogh]], [[Eilif Peterssen]] and [[Harriet Backer]], and also has the largest collection of Lars Hertervigs work. Other artists of Rogaland represented here include [[Kitty Kielland]], Nicolai Ulfsten, [[Carl Sundt-Hansen]], [[Olaf Lange]] and [[Aage Storstein]].\n\nVestlandske School Museum (Western Norway School Museum), in Stavanger, is currently in the old 1920 Kvaleberg school building. Established in 1925, it is a museum of school history in [[Rogaland]].\n\nBy the bay lies the Norwegian Emigration Center on the west side and on the eastern side of the bay is Valbergt\u00e5rnet with his vektermuseeum. [[Norwegian Telecom Museum]] has an office in Stavanger, at L\u00f8kkeveien.\n\n===Churches===\nThe [[Church of Norway]] has two deaneries ''(prosti)'' within the municipality of Stavanger: the [[List of churches in Rogaland#Stavanger domprosti|Stavanger]] arch-[[deanery]] and the [[List of churches in Rogaland#Ytre Stavanger prosti|Ytre Stavanger]] deanery.  The two deaneries are divided up into 17 parishes ''(sokn)'', all of which are part of the [[Diocese of Stavanger]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ style=\"font-size:medium\"|'''''Churches in Stavanger'''''\n!Deanery ''(Prosti)''!!Parish ''(Sokn)''!!Church Name!!Location of the Church!!Year Built\n|-\n!rowspan=\"10\"|Stavanger<br />domprosti\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Stavanger domkirke||[[Stavanger Cathedral]]||[[Storhaug]]||1150\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Bekkefaret||[[Bekkefaret Church]]||[[Bekkefaret]]||1977\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Hundv\u00e5g||[[Hundv\u00e5g Church]]||[[Hundv\u00e5g (island)|Hundv\u00e5g]]||1983\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Kampen||[[Kampen Church (Stavanger)|Kampen Church]]||[[Eiganes og V\u00e5land]]||1957\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|St. Petri||[[St. Petri Church]]||[[Storhaug]]||1866\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|St. Johannes||[[Frue Church]]||[[Storhaug]]||1854\n|-\n|[[St. Johannes Church (Stavanger)|St. Johannes Church]]||[[Johannes, Stavanger|Johannes]]||1909\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Stokka||[[Stokka Church]]||[[Stokka, Stavanger|Stokka]]||1974\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Tjensvoll||[[Tjensvoll Church]]||[[Tjensvoll]]||1978\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Varden||[[Varden Church]]||[[Varden, Stavanger|Varden]]||1967\n|-\n!rowspan=\"9\"|Ytre<br />Stavanger<br />prosti\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Gausel||[[Gausel Church]]||[[Gausel]]||1996\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Hafrsfjord||[[Revheim Church]]||[[Kvernevik]]||1865\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Hillev\u00e5g||[[Hillev\u00e5g Church]]||[[Hillev\u00e5g]]||1961\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Hinna||[[Hinna Church]]||[[Hinna]]||1967\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Madlamark||[[Madlamark Church]]||[[Madlamark]]||1976\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Sunde||[[Sunde Church]]||[[Sunde, Stavanger|Sunde]]||1984\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Tasta||[[Tasta Church]]||[[Indre Tasta]]||1977\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Vardeneset||[[Vardeneset Church]]||[[Ytre Tasta]]||2000\n|-\n|[[Austre \u00c5m\u00f8y Chapel]]||[[Austre \u00c5m\u00f8y]]||1904\n|}\n\n===Film===\nSouth West Film Forum was established in 1992 and is an organization of film workers in [[Rogaland]]. Its goal is to increase the skills of film workers in the region and encourage more filmmaking. Film Forum Southwest has received operating support from the City of Stavanger since 1995 and from the county since 1997. Additionally, they have received grants for film workshop from the county and for other industry-stimulating measures from Stavanger municipality.\n\nStavanger has since 1997 had a grant for the support of local filmmaking. The aim has been to stimulate the local film community growth and development, and to contribute to local filmmakers so they can initiate film projects that can then apply for production funding from other government agencies. In addition, they support the already completed projects \u2013 primarily to help cinemas display locally produced film.\n\nThe feature film [[Mongoland]] became a Norwegian film success, made outside of the traditional infrastructure for [[Norwegian film]]. So far this has culminated with the establishment of the production company South West Film and [[Film Kraft Rogaland]], to ensure long-term fund allocations to filmproduksjoner. Arild \u00d8stin Ommundsen made his directorial debut with the feature film Mongoland in 2000 and has since directed and written the script for [[The Haunting (2003 film)|The Haunting]] (2003) and Monster Thursday (2005). Ommundsen helped start the new Stavanger wave that came after Mongoland premiered, and several of the actors who were instrumental have since enjoyed great success.\n\nStavanger native Stian Kristiansen, who had his acting breakthrough in the feature film \"[[Mongoland]]\", debuted as a feature film director with the film interpretation of Tore Renberg's book [[The Man Who Loved Yngve]]. The film, of the same title, had its theatrical release on 15 February 2008. The film has received top marks in [[Norwegian media]], and was watched by over 30,000 people during the premiere weekend. In 2008, Kristiansen received Stavanger's screenplay scholarship.\n\nOn 30 September 2010, the film ''[[Nokas]]'', directed by [[Erik Skjoldbj\u00e6rg]], premiered in Stavanger. The film is about the [[NOKAS robbery]] in Stavanger on 5 April 2004, and was filmed on location, using many of the locations where the factual event took place, such as the King Street counting center, in the Norway Bank building, and the Cathedral Square, by Maria Church Ruins. The family of the police officer who died during the robbery has not authorized the film.\n\n===European Capital of Culture 2008===\n\nStavanger and its region, along with [[Liverpool]], United Kingdom, was selected as a [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2008. The ''Stavanger2008'' vision is expressed through the concept \"Open Port\". This can be understood both in its English sense \u2013 \"an open harbour\" \u2013 and in its Norwegian meaning of \"an open gate\", together implying openness towards the world. The region and its people is supposed to be even more open and inclusive towards art, ideas and opportunities.\n\nStavanger was the host port of the [[Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Race]] in 1997 and 2004.\n\n===Sport and recreation===\nThe largest local [[football (soccer)|football]] club in Stavanger is [[Viking FK]], one of the most successful football clubs in Norwegian history, having won a total of 8 league titles and 5 [[Norwegian Football Cup]] titles. The club plays its home matches at [[SR-Bank Arena]], which was opened in 2004.\n\nAfter a short stint in the second-tier division, [[OBOS-ligaen]], in the 2018 season, Viking FK was once again promoted to the top-tier [[Eliteserien]], and is to date the club with the most seasons at the highest level of Norwegian football, along with Trondheim rival [[Rosenborg BK]].\n\n[[FK Vidar]], another local football club, currently plays in the Norwegian second division, the third highest level on the football league pyramid.\n\n[[Stavanger Oilers]] is the only western team in the top Norwegian [[ice hockey]] league, [[GET-ligaen]]. The [[team handball|handball]] team Stavanger H\u00e5ndball plays in the Norwegian second division.\n\nStavanger was the host of the 2009 [[beach volleyball]] SWATCH FIVB World Championships.\n\nThe [[S\u00f8rmarka Arena]] is an indoor multi-purpose ice rink used for (inter)national ice speed skating competitions.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:grey; color:black;\"|Club\n! style=\"background:grey; color:black;\"|Sport\n! style=\"background:grey; color:black;\"|Founded\n! style=\"background:grey; color:black;\"|League\n! style=\"background:grey; color:black;\"|Venue\n! style=\"background:grey; color:black;\"|Head coach\n\n|-\n|[[Viking FK]]\n|[[Association football|Football]]\n|1899\n|[[Eliteserien]]\n|[[SR-Bank Arena]]\n|[[Bjarne Berntsen]]\n|-\n|[[Stavanger Oilers]]\n|[[Ice hockey]]\n|2000\n|[[GET-ligaen]]\n|[[DNB Arena (Stavanger)|DNB Arena]]\n|[[Todd Bjorkstrand]]\n|}\n\n===Music===\nEvery May, Stavanger is host to [[MaiJazz]], the Stavanger International Jazz Festival. The International Chamber Music Festival takes place every August.\n\nStavanger is the home of the [[Stavanger Symphony Orchestra]] (SSO).  Covering another part of the musical spectrum, it is also home to gothic metal bands [[Theatre of Tragedy]], [[Tristania (band)|Tristania]], [[Sirenia (band)|Sirenia]] and the singer [[Liv Kristine]], and the black metal band [[Gehenna (band)|Gehenna]]. [[Janove Ottesen]] and [[Geir Zahl]], founding members of the alternative rockband [[Kaizers Orchestra]], both live in Stavanger as well. Other notable acts from Stavanger include [[Kvelertak]], [[Thomas Dybdahl]] & [[Sturle Dagsland]].\n\n===Community art===\nStavanger participates in the annual Nuart festival, organised for national and international artists who operate outside of the traditional art establishment. Every September, a team of internationally acclaimed street artists contribute to \"one of Europe\u2019s most dynamic and constantly evolving public art events.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.regionstavanger-ryfylke.com/whats-on/nuart-festival-2018-p2321713|title=Nuart Festival 2018 \u2013 Art in Stavanger, Stavanger|website=Region Stavanger & Ryfylke|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Tourism==\n{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}\nEspecially in the summertime, Stavanger's harbour is full of large cruiseships: in 2011 Stavanger hosted 130 cruiseships. The Port of Stavanger is a popular stop on the route to the Norwegian Fjords. The charming city center is just a small walk from the quay.\n\n===Outdoor activities===\nThere are not many outdoor activities in Stavanger itself, however, splendid opportunities are nearby in adjacent municipalities: [[Lysefjorden]] is particularly popular for hiking. Tourists typically visit places like [[Preikestolen]] (aka the Pulpit Rock), and [[Kjeragbolten]]. [[Preikestolen]] is a massive rock overhanging the fjord (604 meters below). [[Kjeragbolten]] is a rock wedged in the cliff approximately 1000 meters above the fjord. The straight fall 1000 meters down to the fjord makes [[Kjerag]] a very popular location for [[BASE jumping]].\n\nNot too far from Stavanger, alpine centers are available for skiers and snowboarders throughout the winter season.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basekjerag.com/rogaland/stavanger/svg_base.nsf/id/2CC0E47A17AB6173C1256E150002B1F9?OpenDocument%7ctitle=basekjerag.com%7cwork=basekjerag.com|title=basekjerag.com}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAlong the coast south of Stavanger there are a number of large, sandy beaches, including at Sola, within close reach from the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stavangertravel.com/welcome/beaches.cfm|title=Beaches of Rogaland in west Norway \u2013 Stavanger Travel|website=www.stavangertravel.com|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===City centre===\n[[File:Gamle Stavanger.jpg|thumb|[[Gamle Stavanger]]]]\n[[File:City map stavanger.png|thumb|left|City centre Stavanger]]\nOld Stavanger ([[Gamle Stavanger]]) is located right next to the city centre and has a collection of 18th- and 19th-century wooden structures.\n\n[[Stavanger domkirke]] (St. Swithun's cathedral) was built between 1100 and 1150 by the English bishop Reinald in [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] style, and in the late 13th century a new choir was added in [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, with a vaulted roof. The cathedral is the only Norwegian cathedral that is almost unchanged since the 14th century.\n\nThe city centre itself is small and intimate, with narrow streets and open spaces protected from car traffic. The open-air vegetable market is one of the very few in Norway where you can buy produce directly from local farmers every working day through the year. Unfortunately, the Market has been in decline of recent years, and now has very few stall holders. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Maincat|People from Stavanger}}\nPer

A number of historians have argued convincingly that North-[[J\u00e6ren]] was an economic and military centre as far back as the 9th and 10th centuries with the consolidation of the nation at the [[Battle of Hafrsfjord]] around 872. Stavanger grew into a center of church administration and an important south-west coast [[market town]] around 1100\u20131300.<ref>''Phenomenology and the pioneer settlement on the Western Scandinavian Peninsula''  (Ingrid Fuglestvedt (2009) Lindome : Bricoleur Press) {{ISBN|978-91-85411-07-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Stavanger domkyrkje edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stavanger domkirke]], the oldest [[cathedral]] in Norway.]]\n\nStavanger fulfilled an urban role prior to its status as city (1125), from around the time the Stavanger bishopric was established in the 1120s. Bishop Reinald, who may have come from [[Winchester]], England, is said to have started construction of [[Stavanger Cathedral]] (''Stavanger domkirke'') around 1100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16076a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Ancient See of Stavanger|work=newadvent.org}}</ref> It was finished around 1125, and the city of Stavanger counts 1125 as its year of foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uarctic.org/SingleNewsArticle.aspx?m=668&amid=6229|title=UArctic Education \u2013 Student Portal|work=uarctic.org|access-date=7 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707155026/http://www.uarctic.org/SingleNewsArticle.aspx?m=668&amid=6229|archive-date=7 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWith the [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1536, Stavanger's role as a religious center declined, and the establishment of [[Kristiansand]] in the early 17th century led to the relocation of the bishopric. However, rich herring fisheries in the 19th century gave the city new life.\n\nStavanger was established as a municipality 1 January 1838 (see [[formannskapsdistrikt]]). On 1 January 1867, a small area of [[Hetland]] municipality (population: 200) was transferred to the city of Stavanger.  Again on 1 January 1879, another area of Hetland (population: 1,357) was transferred to Stavanger.  Then again on 1 January 1906, the city again annexed another area of Hetland (population: 399).  On 1 July 1923, part of Hetland (population: 3,063) was moved to the city once again.  Finally on 1 July 1953, a final portion of Hetland (population: 831) was moved to Stavanger. In the 1960s, the work of the [[Schei Committee]] pushed for many municipal mergers across Norway.  As a result of this, on 1 January 1965, the city of Stavanger (population: 51,470) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of [[Madla (municipality)|Madla]] (population: 6,025) and most of [[Hetland]] (population: 20,861).<ref>{{cite web|first=Dag|last=Jukvam|publisher=[[Statistics Norway|Statistisk sentralbyr\u00e5]]|title=Historisk oversikt over endringer i kommune \u2013 og fylkesinndelingen|year=1999|url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/90/rapp_9913/rapp_9913.pdf|language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nThe city's history is a continuous alternation between economic booms and recessions.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stavanger.kommune.no/publikum/divsvg.nsf/svgbyhistorie/$first?opendocument&referer=Byhistorie&sub=1 |title=Stavanger kommune \u2013 Byhistorie<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=24 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928093934/http://www.stavanger.kommune.no/publikum/divsvg.nsf/svgbyhistorie/$first?opendocument&referer=Byhistorie&sub=1 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> For long periods of time its most important industries have been [[shipping]], [[shipbuilding]], the fish [[canning industry]] and associated subcontractors.\n\nIn 1969, a new boom started as oil was first discovered in the North Sea.\n<ref name=\"Stavanger kommune - Byhistorie\">[http://www.stavanger.kommune.no/publikum/Divsvg.nsf/SVGbyhistorie/3952B80210417C4EC12568E30035DD1D?OpenDocument&referer=byhistorie&sub=3 Stavanger kommune \u2013 Byhistorie<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621024226/http://www.stavanger.kommune.no/publikum/Divsvg.nsf/SVGbyhistorie/3952B80210417C4EC12568E30035DD1D?OpenDocument&referer=byhistorie&sub=3 |date=21 June 2008 }}</ref>\nAfter much discussion, Stavanger was chosen to be the on-shore center for the oil industry on the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, and a period of hectic growth followed.<ref name=\"Stavanger kommune - Byhistorie\"/>\n\nOn 1 January 2020, the municipalities of [[Finn\u00f8y]], [[Rennes\u00f8y]], and Stavanger are scheduled to merge into one, large municipality called Stavanger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nye.stavanger.kommune.no/om-nye-stavanger/|title=Om nye Stavanger|language=Norwegian|accessdate=4 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===City development===\n{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}\nStavanger is one of [[Norway]]'s [[List of towns and cities in Norway|oldest cities]]. It emerged in the 12th century during a period of population growth and increasing urbanization throughout [[northern Europe]]. The [[archaeological]] and historical sources about the first city development are sparse. Therefore, there is much we do not know about the first city development. It stands out as an important area from early times, as a desirable foothold for the [[monarchy]] and the church, as both needed a strong foothold in the [[Western Norway|South West coast]] area. In North [[J\u00e6ren]], rich archaeological material suggests that the chiefs held considerable power from the early [[Iron Age]]. Stavanger had a natural harbor and was, with J\u00e6ren in the south, strategically important to the county of the East as well as to the shipping route along the western coast and the fertile [[Ryfylke]] Islands in the north.\n\nThe earliest [[Christianity|Christian]] impulses in [[Norway]] came to Stavanger region through trade connections with Continental Europe and [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Great Britain]]. This flourished during the [[Viking]] era. In the mid 10th century, traditional Norse burial customs ceased in the Stavanger area, at the same time as the first Christian [[priests]] began their work. Big stone crosses are visible memorials of this early Christian age (including the Tjora and Kvits\u00f8y). On the overland approach to Stavanger, a memorial cross of HERS and [[lendmann]] [[Erling Skjalgsson]] was erected after his fall in 1028. Erling controlled power over the South West coast, and the location of the cross indicates that he had a special connection to Stavanger. The inscription on the cross shows a priest was responsible for the inscription, and he may have performed an early service at a church on site.\n\nArchaeological investigations in the current downtown and in the crypt of the [[Stavanger Cathedral|Cathedral]] show that the great fire of 1272 probably left large parts of the city and the cathedral in ruins, including the Romanesque chancel of the cathedral. The reconstruction after the fire led to the cathedral's Western Front being replaced with a vestibule, as well as to the construction (or reconstruction) of [[St. Mary]]'s Church, Bishop's Chapel, the Gothic cathedral and the expansion of the stone cellar at [[Kongsberg]].\n\nStavanger has a long history of education in [[Western Europe]]. It was the monastery here that first saw the need to train new employees through education. The first organized teaching in the city probably took place at a Benedictine monastery in the town, either Olav's Monastery or Monastery of people from the mid-12th century.\n\nOne of the most important events in Stavanger's city history was the gift letter that King [[Magnus Erlingsson]] gave to Stavanger Bishop Eirik Ivarsson in the second half of 1100. Exactly when the king made this gift letter, and under what circumstances it happened is unknown. It may have been in 1163\u20131164, in connection with the King Magnus's coronation, but could also have been around 1181\u20131184, in connection with the support Stavanger Bishop Erik gave King Magnus at the end of the king's fight against the late [[King Sverre]].\n\nIt is undoubtedly correct to characterize Stavanger as a church city throughout the [[Middle Ages]], up to the [[Reformation]]. The Reformation, however, dealt a hard blow to the Church in specific and Stavanger in general. The cathedral, the bishop and canons of the monastery had been large landowners. Recession of the city began with the loss of people in rural areas, as a result of which the revenues of the cathedral and the bishop fell dramatically due to reduced rental income. In 1537 the bishop's and the monastery's estate and property was confiscated by the king. Kongsberg was plundered by Christoffer Trondsen in 1539, at which time St. Swithun's casket disappeared and Bishop Hoskuld Hoskuldsson may have been executed.\n\n===World War II===\n{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}\nIn a prelude to the invasion, on 8 April, the German freighter {{MS|Roda|1928|2}} (6780 grt.) anchored by Ulsnes. ''Roda'' was reportedly loaded with [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], but customs officials and police authorities became suspicious about other cargo when they observed that the ship was not riding deep in the water. The ship was boarded and was ordered to move to Riska. However, ''Roda'' did not move, and the captain of the {{HNoMS|\u00c6ger|1936|2}}, [[Niels Larsen Bruun]], decided on his own initiative to sink the ship. After sending the crew off in lifeboats, ''\u00c6ger'' used 25 shots with {{convert|10|cm|adj=on}} Bofors guns to sink ''Roda''.\n\nEarly on the morning of 9 April 1940, explosions and bomb blasts from [[Sola]]-edge and news bulletins on radio announced the German attack on [[Norway]]. [[Stavanger Airport, Sola|Sola Airport]] was the Germans' first target on North [[J\u00e6ren]]. The airport was attacked by six German Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters around 8 am. The airport had been built in 1937, and in April 1940 fortifications round the airport were not yet complete. Fortifications consisted of a concrete [[bunker]] still under construction and several open shooting positions. Armament consisted of three heavy anti-aircraft machine guns, three heavy machine guns configured for ground targets, and some light machine guns at the disposal of the approximately 80 soldiers who defended the airport. The bomber wing was transferred to Sola Airport in 1939, but the planes, a total of six Fokker and three Caproni aircraft, were old and outdated. Shortly after the attack began, however, they took off.\n\nThe German air attack increased in intensity. The [[bombardment]] lasted for about an hour before ten slow Ju 52 transport aircraft arrived over the airport. They had taken off from the airport at [[Hamburg Airport|Hamburg]] a few hours earlier. In a parachute assault, the transport planes first dropped yellow containers containing weapons and equipment, then between ten and twelve paratroopers from each plane. This was only the second ever wartime parachute assault; the first had occurred only three hours earlier, when a bridge south of [[Denmark]] was captured in the same way. At the Sola airport, the concrete bunker held out longest, but was eventually put out of action with a hand grenade. While [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[soldier]]s were badly injured in the attempted defence, there were no fatalities; in contrast; the Germans lost several. Lieutenant Thor Tang, who led the Norwegian defense of the airport, capitulated at 10:00, and the Germans immediately began landing troops, fuel and other supplies. In all, 200 to 300 transport aircraft arrived in Sola during invasion day, and by evening several hundred soldiers and large quantities of materiel had been moved from Germany to Sola.\n\nBy around 12:30 on 9 April, the first German troops advanced into Stavanger without resistance. The police station, telephone office, telegraph center, post office, port office, customs house and the gas company were the most important places, and now came under control of the Germans. The city was conquered without conflict, but the first sparks of resistance had been ignited, and several men left the city and made their way to the Norwegian troops inside [[Gjesdal]], there to join the armed struggle against the enemy.\n\n[[File:Tysk fange.png|thumb|A German [[Prisoner of war|POW]] clearing mines in Stavanger in August 1945]]\nThe Germans had placed a high priority to have a good railway connection between the air base at [[Sola]] \u2013 Stavanger district, and the rest of the [[Norway|country]]. However, it was not until 29 April 1944, that the [[S\u00f8rlandsbanen|Southern Railway]] was completed to Stavanger. In 1940, the [[Germans]] had envisioned it to be completed no later than 1 November 1941.\n\nAfter [[Hitler]]'s death in 1945, Grand Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] took over leadership of the German forces, and on 9 May 1945, gave the head of the German armed forces in Norway, General [[Franz B\u00f6hme]], orders that \"Reichskommissar\" in Norway, Josef Terboven, was deposed and that all his duties were transferred to B\u00f6hme. To B\u00f6hme, in turn, he gave the task of how the capitulation of Festung Norwegen was to be implemented. There were around 15,000 German soldiers in [[Rogaland]] in 1945, and it was there where the commander of 274 Infantry Division, General Weckman, gave the formal German surrender.\n\nBefore repatriation, the Germans were required to remain and clean up after five years of occupation. There were 180 German minefields in [[Rogaland]], with a total of 480,000 mines, all of which the German Wehrmacht were required to clear. 62 Germans were killed and 94 were injured during mine clearance in Rogaland. Mines from this period continue to be uncovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/i/G7aMq/Minefunn-pa-Hellestostranden|title=Minefunn p\u00e5 Hellest\u00f8stranden|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Oil capital===\n[[File:StatfjordA(Jarvin1982).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Petroleum|oil]] industry is the backbone of Stavanger's economy.]]\nIn 1969, a new boom started as [[Petroleum|oil]] was first discovered in the [[North Sea]].\n<ref name=\"Stavanger kommune - Byhistorie\"/>\nAfter much discussion, Stavanger was chosen to be the on-shore center for the oil industry on the [[Norway|Norwegian]] sector of the North Sea, and a period of hectic growth followed.<ref name=\"Stavanger kommune - Byhistorie\"/>\n\nIn March 1965 an agreement was signed between [[Norway]] and the [[United Kingdom]] on the sharing of the continental shelf by the median line principle. That same year a similar agreement was signed between Norway and [[Denmark]]. It was designed as a legal regime for oil exploration. The first licensing round on the Norwegian shelf was announced on 13 April 1965, and in August of that same year the government granted 22 licenses for 78 blocks for oil companies or groups of companies. The production license gave oil companies exclusive rights to exploration, drilling and production in a defined geographical area for a given period at an annual fee. [[Esso]] was the first oil company to start drilling for oil off the coast of Norway. The semi-submersible drilling vessel [[Ocean Traveler]] was towed from [[New Orleans]] to Norway, and the vessel began drilling on 19 July 1966, at block 8/3, about {{convert|180|km}} southwest of Stavanger.\n\n===Coat of arms===\n[[Hallvard Tr\u00e6tteberg]] (1898\u20131987), a leading specialist in heraldry, was commissioned to design the official [[coat of arms]] of Stavanger, a work that lasted from the end of the 1920s until approved on 11 August 1939. His design is also used as the city's arms, flag, and seal. The coat of arms is based upon a seal which dated 1591. It shows a branch of [[vine]] (''[[Vitis vinifera]]''). Which leaves and branch type that is depicted on the coat of arms has been hotly debated.

This could refer to the form of the inlet, but also to the form of the mountain Valberget (''Staven'' meaning 'the staff,' is a common name of high and steep mountains in Norway). The last element is ''angr'' meaning 'inlet, bay'. Facing the [[North Sea]], Stavanger has always been economically dependent on its access to the sea.<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\n==Government==\nAll municipalities in Norway, including Stavanger, are responsible for [[primary education]] (through 10th grade), outpatient [[Health care|health services]], [[old age|senior citizen]] services, [[unemployment]] and other [[Social work|social services]], [[zoning]], [[economic development]], and municipal [[road]]s.  The municipality is governed by a [[Municipal council (Norway)|municipal council]] of elected representatives, which in turn elect a [[mayor]].\n\n===Municipal council===\nThe [[Municipal council (Norway)|municipal council]] ''(Kommunestyre)'' of Stavanger is made up of 67 representatives that are elected to four year terms.

The [[Byfjorden (Rogaland)|Byfjorden]] and [[Gandsfjorden]] run along the east side of the city. It is part of the Low-[[J\u00e6ren]], a flat area of land consisting mostly of marsh, sand, and stone aur, that ranges from Ogna River in the south to Tungenes in the north; it is the northernmost part that includes Stavanger. The majority of the municipality lies between {{convert|0|and|50|m}} in elevation. The landscape has a distinctive appearance with rocks and hills where there is no settlement or agriculture. The city of Stavanger is closely linked to the sea and water, with five lakes (including [[Breiavatnet]], [[Stora Stokkavatnet]], and [[Mosvatnet]]) and three fjords ([[Hafrsfjorden]], [[Byfjorden (Rogaland)|Byfjorden]], and [[Gandsfjorden]]); sea and water form the landscape, providing a shoreline rich with vegetation and wildlife.\n\nThe terrain is low-lying: 49% of the area is less than {{convert|20|m}} above sea level, While 7% of the land is at {{convert|60|m}}. Stavanger's highest point is the {{convert|139|m|adj=on}} tall J\u00e5tt\u00e5nuten with the {{convert|136|m|adj=on}} Ullandhaug as the second highest point.\n\nThe city has developed on both sides of a hollow that runs right through the terrain, with steep slopes up from the bottom. An extension of Boknafjorden and Byfjorden intersects the harbor into the hollow from the northwest, while Hillev\u00e5g lake intrudes from Gandsfjorden in the southeast. [[Breiavatnet]] is located between the two fjord arms.\n\nThe city includes many islands off the coast including: [[Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya, Stavanger|Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8y]], [[Bu\u00f8y]], [[Eng\u00f8y]], [[Grasholmen]], [[Helles\u00f8y, Stavanger|Helles\u00f8y]], [[Hundv\u00e5g (island)|Hundv\u00e5g]], [[Kalv\u00f8y, Stavanger|Kalv\u00f8y]], [[Lind\u00f8y]], [[S\u00f8lyst, Stavanger|S\u00f8lyst]], and [[Vass\u00f8y]].  It also includes the eastern half of the island of [[\u00c5m\u00f8y]].<ref name=\"snl\">{{cite web|url=https://snl.no/Stavanger|title=Stavanger|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=27 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Parks===\n{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Byparken Stavanger2.JPG|thumb|The city park]]\nThere are several parks and green spots in Stavanger municipality, both in the city and beyond. Central to the town is the city lake which is in turn surrounded by the city park, built as the city's first urban park in 1866\u20131868. Between the city park and the bay is located [[Kielland]] garden, which got its name because the poet [[Alexander Kielland]]'s house at the time was here. Kielland Park went through a major renovation in 2007 as part of the Millennium in Stavanger municipality. At the opposite end of the city lake there is a small park outside the station; here there is [[Emigration]], a gift from the Norwegian emigrants in the [[United States]], commemorating the men and women of [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] ancestry who built America.\n\nBjergstedparken, a park north of [[Gamle Stavanger|Old Stavanger]], is the location of Bjergsted Music Center, including [[Stavanger Concert Hall]], and its outdoor areas are often used for festivals and outdoor concerts. The Missing park, built in honor of Lars Missing, is located up the hill on the west side of the harbor, and forms the entrance from the south towards the Old Town. Canon park forms the border between Stavanger and the exit from the [[European route E39|E39]]. Northward go L\u00f8kkeveien against Bjergsted westward go Madlaveien the theater and Bergelandstunnelen, east towards E39. The park is located next to old Stavanger Hospital, which also has a large park area around the main building. Through the park runs Kannik creek, which comes to the surface at the statue of the Little Mermaid and runs into Breiavannet. Kannikkbekken runs mostly underground, in pipes, before it reaches Kannik park.\n\nOutside the city center, the park southerly in relation to the large inland lakes such as [[Mosvatnet]], [[Stora Stokkavatnet]] and Water Assen. Mosvatnet is {{convert|0.46|km2|acres}} making it the third largest in Stavanger after H\u00e5landsvatnet and Store Stokkavatn. The lake supplied the city's drinking water from 1863 to 1931, and is now by far the most used recreation area in Stavanger. The path around the lake is {{convert|3.2|km}} long, and much used by cyclist and joggers; sampling conducted in 1995 showed that an estimated 560,000 people used the walking trail around Mosvatnet. At the south end is Mosvangen Camping, Stavanger Sv\u00f8mmestadion old man and V\u00e5landskogen, and to the west is Rogaland Kunstmuseum. Stora Stokkavatnet is {{convert|2.19|km2}} \u2013 the largest in Stavanger. Right at Stora Stokkavatnet is the {{convert|0.15|km2|adj=on}} Litla Stokkavatnet. The hiking trail around the lakes is {{convert|8.2|km}} long. In the lake is a small island, Storeholmen. Store Stokkavatnet supplied Stavanger's drinking water from 1931 to 1959, and was later demoted to the reserve drinking water. In 2009 it was relegated once more, and it is now legal to swim in the water.\n\n===Climate===\nStavanger is located on a peninsula on the southwest coast of Norway. The climate is greatly influenced by the [[Gulf Stream]] which creates warmer temperatures throughout the year compared to other cities at similar latitudes. According to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Stavanger experiences an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') with five months with a mean temperature above {{convert|10|C}}. The city has also a slight continental climate influence which can create subzero lows during winter. The city is relatively wet with an annual average of {{convert|1180|mm}} of precipitation.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Stavanger Airport (Sola), Rogaland (Normals: 1961\u20131990, Extremes: 1944\u20131993)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n\n|Jan record high C = 10.0\n|Feb record high C = 10.0\n|Mar record high C = 18.2\n|Apr record high C = 25.0\n|May record high C = 26.1\n|Jun record high C = 29.7\n|Jul record high C = 31.1\n|Aug record high C = 34.0\n|Sep record high C = 25.0\n|Oct record high C = 20.0\n|Nov record high C = 13.9\n|Dec record high C = 11.3\n\n|Jan high C = 4\n|Feb high C = 4\n|Mar high C = 6\n|Apr high C = 10\n|May high C = 15\n|Jun high C = 17\n|Jul high C = 19\n|Aug high C = 19\n|Sep high C = 16\n|Oct high C = 12\n|Nov high C = 8\n|Dec high C = 5\n|year high C = 11.3\n\n|Jan mean C = 2\n|Feb mean C = 1.5\n|Mar mean C = 3.5\n|Apr mean C = 6.5\n|May mean C = 11\n|Jun mean C = 13.5\n|Jul mean C = 15.5\n|Aug mean C = 15.5\n|Sep mean C = 13\n|Oct mean C = 9.5\n|Nov mean C = 6\n|Dec mean C = 3\n|year mean C = 8.4\n\n|Jan low C = 0\n|Feb low C = -1\n|Mar low C = 1\n|Apr low C = 3\n|May low C = 7\n|Jun low C = 10\n|Jul low C = 12\n|Aug low C = 12\n|Sep low C = 10\n|Oct low C = 7\n|Nov low C = 4\n|Dec low C = 1\n|year low C = 5.5\n\n|Jan record low C = -18.9\n|Feb record low C = -17.2\n|Mar record low C = -12.0\n|Apr record low C = -7.8\n|May record low C = -2.0\n|Jun record low C = 1.0\n|Jul record low C = 4.0\n|Aug record low C = 3.0\n|Sep record low C = -1.1\n|Oct record low C = -3.9\n|Nov record low C = -16.0\n|Dec record low C = -16.1\n\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 92\n|Feb precipitation mm = 66\n|Mar precipitation mm = 75\n|Apr precipitation mm = 50\n|May precipitation mm = 68\n|Jun precipitation mm = 73\n|Jul precipitation mm = 91\n|Aug precipitation mm = 115\n|Sep precipitation mm = 156\n|Oct precipitation mm = 148\n|Nov precipitation mm = 136\n|Dec precipitation mm = 110\n\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 13.7\n|Feb precipitation days = 10.4\n|Mar precipitation days = 11.9\n|Apr precipitation days = 9.9\n|May precipitation days = 10.7\n|Jun precipitation days = 10.6\n|Jul precipitation days = 10.8\n|Aug precipitation days = 14.0\n|Sep precipitation days = 16.9\n|Oct precipitation days = 16.7\n|Nov precipitation days = 17.7\n|Dec precipitation days = 15.6\n\n|Jan humidity = 82\n|Feb humidity = 81\n|Mar humidity = 78\n|Apr humidity = 77\n|May humidity = 75\n|Jun humidity = 78\n|Jul humidity = 78\n|Aug humidity = 80\n|Sep humidity = 80\n|Oct humidity = 81\n|Nov humidity = 82\n|Dec humidity = 82\n\n|Jan sun = 48\n|Feb sun = 79\n|Mar sun = 140\n|Apr sun = 168\n|May sun = 226\n|Jun sun = 222\n|Jul sun = 197\n|Aug sun = 159\n|Sep sun = 141\n|Oct sun = 80\n|Nov sun = 45\n|Dec sun = 33\n|year sun = 1538.\n| source 1 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]]<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = https://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_014150_kt.pdf\n| title = Klimatafel von Stavanger, Prov.

In the first half of the century it was known for [[canning]], and in the 1950s there were over 50 canneries in town. The town was even called Norway \"canned capital\", and included [[Christian Bjelland I|Christian Bjelland]], who founded Chr Bjelland & Co. A/S. The last of these factories were closed down in 2002.\n\nAround 1950, over half of the working population in the city employed in [[industry]]. Structural changes in industry and the strong development of the service industry has radically changed the city's economic base, and the service industry now represents over 11 percent of employment. However, the city still has 29 percent of the county's industrial [[employment]].\n\nEngineering is now the main industry with 59 percent of manufacturing employment. This is mostly related to the offshore petroleum industry, and production of oil platforms alone account for 40 percent. Other important industries are publishing \u2013 especially high printing and the major daily newspapers in town, [[Stavanger Aftenblad|Stavanger and Rogaland Avis Aftenblad]] \u2013 and food and beverage, which includes the processing of local agricultural products from J\u00e6ren, including Gilde Vest with one of the largest slaughterhouses.\n\nEmployment by place of work and industry in 2007 to 0.6% in primary, 27.4% in secondary and tertiary industries 71.7%. Employment by place of work by sector in 2007 to 24.4% in the public sector and 75.6% in the private sector and public enterprises.\n\nIndustry has in recent years become highly decentralized. The most important of the newer industrial areas are [[Forus]] in the south, on the border of [[Sandnes]] and [[Sola]], and [[Dusavik]] (mainly petroleum-related activities) in the north, on the border of Randfontein. Significant older industrial areas are [[Hillev\u00e5g]], [[Bu\u00f8y]], the eastern districts, and in some places elsewhere along the coast. Shipbuilding and shipping has also traditionally been of great importance to the city's economic growth, and Rosenberg Shipyard, established in 1896, is located on [[Hundv\u00e5g (island)|Hundv\u00e5g]]. Today Stavanger is also among the country's most important [[Sea|maritime]] cities, coming in fourth for registered fleets after the cities of [[Oslo]], [[Bergen]] and [[\u00c5lesund]].\n\nFor the fourth consecutive year, [[Greater Stavanger|Stavanger Region]] was in 2007 ranked best business region. Telemarksforsking Bo worked with Ministry NM to rank the regions in [[Norway]] with regard to profitability, growth and new businesses.\n\n===Media===\n{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Aftenbladet.jpg|thumb|[[Stavanger Aftenblad]]]]\n\nThe city's largest daily newspaper, [[Stavanger Aftenblad]] came out with its first issue in 1893. Competitor [[Rogalands Avis]] was first published in 1899 under the name ''1ste Mai'' ('1 May'), and published daily. In 1987 an attempt was made to establish a new daily newspaper, The West Coast, but it was only released for two months and ended with a total loss of NOK 27 million.\n\nThe first newspaper published in Stavanger, \"Stavangerske Adressecontoirs Efterretninger\", was a handwritten weekly newspaper that probably came out in 1769 and 1770. This was not an ordinary newspaper, but a so-called link newspaper with the privilege of bringing out announcements, small articles and ads. The first ''printed'' newspaper in Stavanger, \"Stavanger Addresseavis\", published its first issue on Friday, 4 October 1833.\n\n[[Stavanger Avis]] was published from 1888 until 1911. Writer and local Alexander L. Kielland was editor in 1889. Stavanger Avis was also the name of the newspaper that came out from 1942 to 1945, when Stavanger Aftenblad and Stavangeren were merged by the Press Directorate.\n\nStudent newspaper ''SMiS'' (Studentmediene i Stavanger) comes out every other month.\n\nStavanger has one principal television station, TV Vest, that sends local news and reports. Additionally, Viking TV, the channel for the football team [[Viking FK]], started on 2 March 2008, and is distributed via Lyse's broadband network, reaching 120,000 viewers in 45,000 households. [[NRK]] [[Rogaland]] supplies local news broadcasts on radio and television. Local radio stations also provide local news and reports.\n\n===Agriculture and food===\n{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}\nStavanger region is often referred to as Norway's answer to the French food region of [[Lyon]].  The Culinary Institute, headquartered in [[Ullandhaug]], provided a very important focus on food in Stavanger. After the Culinary Institute went bankrupt, partly due to activities in [[Oslo]] on 4 June 2008, a new culinary organization was established by the Foundation Rogaland knowledge park and [[Rogaland]] County Council. This new institute, now also known as The Culinary Institute, maintained parts of the work of the original organization, and eventually bought back the name, logo and brand ''Culinary Institute'' from the bankruptcy estate.\n\nIn summer 2007, the region's culinary actors were awarded the title \"Norwegian Centres of Expertise in Culinology.\" The building under construction at Ullandhaug will serve as a platform and innovative arena, not only for the region's R & D environment, but also for other expertise among both industry and the public. In July 2008 the Stavanger European championship qualified for the Bocuse d' Or. In 2008, Norway was represented by Geir Skeie, who also won gold. Every year there is a \"Happy Food Festival\" in the city center. The festival originated in the network of [[Rogaland]] county so that they could impart culinary traditions of the region. By 2020, Stavanger region intends to be the region most Norwegians associate with food products and culinary experiences.\n\n===Oil industry===\n{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}\nIn recent times, the city has come to be called the \"oil capital,\" and Norway's national and largest oil company, [[Equinor]], is headquartered at [[Forus]], in Stavanger. Equinor(at the time known as Statoil) was founded as a limited company owned by the [[Government of Norway]] on 14 July 1972 by a unanimous act passed by the Norwegian parliament [[Stortinget]], to enable Norwegian participation in the oil industry on the continental shelf, to build up Norwegian competency within the petroleum industry, and to establish the foundations of a domestic petroleum industry. Establishing Equinor's headquarters in Stavanger naturally led to Stavanger becoming the center of the oil industry. [[Petoro]], a Norwegian state-owned company responsible for managing the commercial aspects of the state's direct financial interest in petroleum activities on the Norwegian continental shelf, also has its headquarters in the city. With the center of the national oil industry in Stavanger, several other international oil companies have also made their headquarters in Stavanger.\n\n[[File:Troll A Platform.jpg|thumb|The concrete base for the Troll A platform is cast in Vats, 55&nbsp;km north of Stavanger]]\n\nNPD was created in 1972 by Ullandhaug and PSA was established on 1 January 2004 and co-located with the agency, as a regulatory body.\n\n[[J\u00e5tt\u00e5v\u00e5gen]], on [[Gandsfjorden]], was from the 1970s to the 1990s a large industrial area, particularly for the construction of large concrete Condeep platforms and oil platforms for the offshore industry. Among others, the Condeep jacket for the three Gullfaks platforms and Troll A were cast here by Norwegian Contractors.\n\nOffshore Northern Seas is the second largest exhibition of its kind in the oil and gas industry. ONS takes place in Stavanger during the last week of August every other year. In 2008, there were 38,000 visitors, half of whom came from abroad.\n\n===Tourism===\nStavanger is a popular tourist destination, especially in summer. The hotels in the city have good occupancy year round due to a lot of commuters who travel to work and meetings in Stavanger. In recent years, Stavanger has also become one of the most popular ports of call for cruise ships, with the number of cruise ships increasing steadily, making Stavanger one of [[Europe]]'s fastest growing ports of call for cruise ships north of the [[Mediterranean]]. [[File:Cruise ship Stavanger Norway.jpg|thumb|P&O MV Britannia cruise ship at berth near Strandkaien, Stavanger]]\n\n==Transport==\n{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Airport===\n[[File:ENZV Aerial 2011.JPG|thumb|[[Stavanger Airport, Sola]]]]\n[[Stavanger Airport, Sola]], is located in [[Sola]], 14 minutes away from Stavanger City Center. The airport opened in 1937. In 1940 [[Stavanger Airport, Forus]], opened, but closed in 1989. In 2013 Sola airport had over 4 million passengers and was the largest airport in [[Rogaland]] county. It is also the 3rd largest airport in [[List of airports in Norway|Norway]] and 7th in the [[List of the busiest airports in the Nordic countries|Nordic]] countries. The busiest route is [[Oslo-Gardermoen]], with over 1,5 million passengers; the second most popular is [[Bergen Airport, Flesland]], with over 700,000 passengers; [[Oslo-Torp]] is the third most popular, followed by [[Trondheim Airport, V\u00e6rnes]] and [[Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik]] domestically. Internationally, the busiest routes are [[Copenhagen Airport|Copenhagen]], [[Amsterdam Airport|Amsterdam]], and [[Aberdeen Airport|Aberdeen]]. Stavanger also has connections to domestic and European destinations, including [[Heathrow Airport|London]], [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris]], [[Barcelona Airport|Barcelona]], [[Arlanda Airport|Stockholm]], [[Chopin Airport|Warsaw]]. Domestic destinations are all the way up from [[Troms\u00f8 Airport|Troms\u00f8]] down to [[Kristiansand Airport|Kristiansand]].\n\n===Railway===\n[[File:Stavanger stasjon 2013-04-28 10.34.24.jpg|thumb|[[Stavanger Station|Stavanger S]]]]\n[[Stavanger Station|Stavanger S]] opened in 1878 and is the terminus of both the [[S\u00f8rlandet Line]] and the [[J\u00e6ren Line]].\n\n[[S\u00f8rlandsbanen|The Southern Railway]] goes from [[Oslo S]] to [[Drammen Station|Drammen]], to [[Kristiansand Station|Kristiansand S]], to, finally, [[Stavanger Station|Stavanger S]]. This route, 545 kilometers (339&nbsp;mi) between Oslo and Stavanger, is scheduled over four times every day and takes around seven hours. The railway was constructed in several phases, the first section being opened in 1871 and the last not opened until 1944. While there was continual construction work from [[Oslo]] westward as far as Moi, the [[J\u00e6ren Line]], from [[Egersund]] to Stavanger in [[Western Norway]], was opened in 1878. Up to 1913 the name used on plans and for the completed sections was the Vestlandet Line (The West Country Line).\n\nThere are also local trains in [[J\u00e6ren]] with 19 stops on one line. The line opened as a 1,067&nbsp;mm (3&nbsp;ft 6 in) narrow gauge stand-alone line on 27 February 1878. The railway was extended from [[Egersund]] to [[Flekkefjord]] as the [[Flekkefjord Line]] in 1904. The [[J\u00e6ren Line]]'s only branch, the [[\u00c5lg\u00e5rd]] Line from [[Ganddal]] to [[\u00c5lg\u00e5rd]], opened in 1924. In 1944, the [[S\u00f8rlandet Line]] was extended to [[Sira, Norway|Sira]] on the [[Flekkefjord Line]], and the [[J\u00e6ren Line]] was integrated into the main railway network. Because of this, the line was converted to standard gauge.\n\n===Roads===\n[[File:Btd rv44 sandnes.png|thumb|National road 44]]\n[[European route E39]] goes through Stavanger from [[Haugesund]] and the [[Mastrafjord Tunnel]] and [[Byfjord Tunnel]], then goes south to [[Sandnes]]. Fylkesvei 44 starts from Stavanger and ends in [[Kristiansand]], via [[Sandnes]] and [[Flekkefjord]].\n\nNational road 509 runs between Stavanger, via [[Tananger]] arm [[Stavanger Airport, Sola]] Cross and [[Forus]], the [[European route E39]], and between National road 44 and [[European route E39|E39]] at [[Malmheim og Soma|Soma]] in [[Sandnes]]. The road length is 19.5&nbsp;km (+ new part).\n\nBefore 1 January 2010, the county road 509 part of the way.\n\nOn 18 December 2012, the new engine traffic road Solasplitten opened as a new thoroughfare eastward, north of [[Forus]] and the [[European route E39]].\n\nThere are two tunnel projects planned: [[Ryfast]] ([[Ryfylke Tunnel]] and [[Hundv\u00e5g Tunnel]]) and [[Rogfast]].\n\n===Sea===\n\nLocated outside Stavanger, there is a port serving ferries to [[Hirtshals]], Denmark. There have been advocates for the [[Smyril Line]] ferry between the [[Faroe Islands]] and Denmark to make a stop in Stavanger as the new port in Risavika allows this to be done while only adding one hour to the total sailing time.\n\nLocal ferries go to [[Tau, Norway|Tau]] and [[Kvits\u00f8y]], while fast passenger boats go to many villages and islands between the main routes from Stavanger to [[Haugesund]] and [[Sauda]].\n\nThere are plans to reestablish the [[Newcastle\u2013Bergen\u2013Stavanger ferry|ferry link to Newcastle]] in the United Kingdom, which was suspended in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2012/08/27/north-shields-to-norway-ferry-plan-raises-job-hopes-61634-31703489/|title=North Shields to Norway ferry plan raises job hopes|author=Adrian Pearson|date=27 August 2012|work=journallive}}</ref>\n\n===Bus===\n[[File:Sandnes 01.jpg|thumb|Bus terminal in [[Sandnes]], the neighboring city of Stavanger]]\n\nThe local bus service in Stavanger is administered by Rogaland Kollektivtrafikk (RKT) under the brand name \"[[Kolumbus]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kolumbus.no/|title=Kolumbus AS|work=kolumbus.no}}</ref> The buses are operated by Boreal Transport. RKT administers all bus routes in Rogaland County.\n\nExpress bus services are operated by [[NOR-WAY Bussekspress]] from Stavanger City Terminal to [[Kristiansand]], Bergen and Haugesund, and by [[Lavprisekspressen]] to Oslo via Kristiansand.\n\nThe city has a number of bus services and taxis.\n\n==Education==\n{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}\n[[University of Stavanger]] (UIS) is the fifth university established in Norway, on 29 October 2004, when the University of Stavanger (HiS) gained university status by decision of the Council. The university has about 9,000 students and 1,200 employees and is organized into three faculties: Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences and the Faculty of Science. The [[archaeological museum]] is also part of the university. The campus is located in [[Ullandhaug]], with most departments located there. [[John B. M\u00f8st]] was employed as a university in 2011. Marit Boyesen was selected as the principal for the period 2011 to 2015, and started her tenure as rector 1 August 2011. As rector, she is the head of the academic activities of the University of Stavanger as well as Chairman of the University Board. The University of Stavanger became a member of [[European Consortium of Innovative Universities]] (ECIU) in October 2012.\n\nThe [[VID Specialized University]] has a long history in the city. This university began as the School of Mission and Theology or Misjonsh\u00f8gskolen (MHS), being established in 1843 and accredited in 2008 as a research university. It has about 300 students from approximately 20 countries. MHS is owned by the [[Norwegian Missionary Society]]. The Centre for Intercultural Communication (SIK) is associated with the college's mission. In 2016 it became part of the VID Specialized University.\n\n[[File:J\u00e5tt\u00e5 videreg\u00e5ende skole.JPG|thumb|[[J\u00e5tt\u00e5 Upper Secondary School]]]]\n\nThe Art School in [[Rogaland]] was established in 1978, with a history back to 1957.\n\nThe Scandinavian School of Management offers college studies in Marketing and Management.

The city's most visited museum is the [[Norwegian Petroleum Museum]], opened in 1998. In its ten years of visitation records, from 1998 to 2008, almost 95,000 people visited the museum annually.\n\nThe city's oldest museum is Missjonmuseet, established in 1864, located on the ground floor of the faculty building at MHS. The museum has about 5,000 exhibits consisting of several objects of ethnographic and historical interest from the various mission fields of study.\n\n[[Stavanger Museum]], founded in 1877 and thus one of the oldest museums, includes several historic buildings and collections. Stavanger Museum consists of a total of eight buildings: Stavanger Museum Mus\u00e9gata 16, Stavanger Maritime Museum, the Norwegian Canning Museum, [[Ledaal]], Breidablikkveien museum, combined indretning, Norwegian Printing Museum and the Norwegian Children's Museum. In the main museum are now a cultural department, a zoological collection, and a library.\n\nMuseum of Archaeology in Stavanger is the largest museum in Stavanger, measured by number of employees. AmS is a state museum for the prehistoric sites in [[Rogaland]], and is part of the [[University of Stavanger]]. The museum also conducts extensive outreach activities, and has facilities fairly close to Stavanger Museum.\n\n[[File:Rogaland Kunstmuseum.jpg|thumb|Rogaland Art Museum]]\n\nRogaland Art Museum, located by a park, has paintings by Norwegian artist [[Edvard Munch]], [[Christian Krogh]], [[Eilif Peterssen]] and [[Harriet Backer]], and also has the largest collection of Lars Hertervigs work.

Its goal is to increase the skills of film workers in the region and encourage more filmmaking. Film Forum Southwest has received operating support from the City of Stavanger since 1995 and from the county since 1997. Additionally, they have received grants for film workshop from the county and for other industry-stimulating measures from Stavanger municipality.\n\nStavanger has since 1997 had a grant for the support of local filmmaking. The aim has been to stimulate the local film community growth and development, and to contribute to local filmmakers so they can initiate film projects that can then apply for production funding from other government agencies. In addition, they support the already completed projects \u2013 primarily to help cinemas display locally produced film.\n\nThe feature film [[Mongoland]] became a Norwegian film success, made outside of the traditional infrastructure for [[Norwegian film]]. So far this has culminated with the establishment of the production company South West Film and [[Film Kraft Rogaland]], to ensure long-term fund allocations to filmproduksjoner. Arild \u00d8stin Ommundsen made his directorial debut with the feature film Mongoland in 2000 and has since directed and written the script for [[The Haunting (2003 film)|The Haunting]] (2003) and Monster Thursday (2005). Ommundsen helped start the new Stavanger wave that came after Mongoland premiered, and several of the actors who were instrumental have since enjoyed great success.\n\nStavanger native Stian Kristiansen, who had his acting breakthrough in the feature film \"[[Mongoland]]\", debuted as a feature film director with the film interpretation of Tore Renberg's book [[The Man Who Loved Yngve]]. The film, of the same title, had its theatrical release on 15 February 2008. The film has received top marks in [[Norwegian media]], and was watched by over 30,000 people during the premiere weekend. In 2008, Kristiansen received Stavanger's screenplay scholarship.\n\nOn 30 September 2010, the film ''[[Nokas]]'', directed by [[Erik Skjoldbj\u00e6rg]], premiered in Stavanger. The film is about the [[NOKAS robbery]] in Stavanger on 5 April 2004, and was filmed on location, using many of the locations where the factual event took place, such as the King Street counting center, in the Norway Bank building, and the Cathedral Square, by Maria Church Ruins. The family of the police officer who died during the robbery has not authorized the film.\n\n===European Capital of Culture 2008===\n\nStavanger and its region, along with [[Liverpool]], United Kingdom, was selected as a [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2008. The ''Stavanger2008'' vision is expressed through the concept \"Open Port\". This can be understood both in its English sense \u2013 \"an open harbour\" \u2013 and in its Norwegian meaning of \"an open gate\", together implying openness towards the world. The region and its people is supposed to be even more open and inclusive towards art, ideas and opportunities.\n\nStavanger was the host port of the [[Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Race]] in 1997 and 2004.\n\n===Sport and recreation===\nThe largest local [[football (soccer)|football]] club in Stavanger is [[Viking FK]], one of the most successful football clubs in Norwegian history, having won a total of 8 league titles and 5 [[Norwegian Football Cup]] titles. The club plays its home matches at [[SR-Bank Arena]], which was opened in 2004.\n\nAfter a short stint in the second-tier division, [[OBOS-ligaen]], in the 2018 season, Viking FK was once again promoted to the top-tier [[Eliteserien]], and is to date the club with the most seasons at the highest level of Norwegian football, along with Trondheim rival [[Rosenborg BK]].\n\n[[FK Vidar]], another local football club, currently plays in the Norwegian second division, the third highest level on the football league pyramid.\n\n[[Stavanger Oilers]] is the only western team in the top Norwegian [[ice hockey]] league, [[GET-ligaen]]. The [[team handball|handball]] team Stavanger H\u00e5ndball plays in the Norwegian second division.\n\nStavanger was the host of the 2009 [[beach volleyball]] SWATCH FIVB World Championships.\n\nThe [[S\u00f8rmarka Arena]] is an indoor multi-purpose ice rink used for (inter)national ice speed skating competitions.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:grey; color:black;\"|Club\n! style=\"background:grey; color:black;\"|Sport\n! style=\"background:grey; color:black;\"|Founded\n! style=\"background:grey; color:black;\"|League\n! style=\"background:grey; color:black;\"|Venue\n! style=\"background:grey; color:black;\"|Head coach\n\n|-\n|[[Viking FK]]\n|[[Association football|Football]]\n|1899\n|[[Eliteserien]]\n|[[SR-Bank Arena]]\n|[[Bjarne Berntsen]]\n|-\n|[[Stavanger Oilers]]\n|[[Ice hockey]]\n|2000\n|[[GET-ligaen]]\n|[[DNB Arena (Stavanger)|DNB Arena]]\n|[[Todd Bjorkstrand]]\n|}\n\n===Music===\nEvery May, Stavanger is host to [[MaiJazz]], the Stavanger International Jazz Festival. The International Chamber Music Festival takes place every August.\n\nStavanger is the home of the [[Stavanger Symphony Orchestra]] (SSO).  Covering another part of the musical spectrum, it is also home to gothic metal bands [[Theatre of Tragedy]], [[Tristania (band)|Tristania]], [[Sirenia (band)|Sirenia]] and the singer [[Liv Kristine]], and the black metal band [[Gehenna (band)|Gehenna]]. [[Janove Ottesen]] and [[Geir Zahl]], founding members of the alternative rockband [[Kaizers Orchestra]], both live in Stavanger as well. Other notable acts from Stavanger include [[Kvelertak]], [[Thomas Dybdahl]] & [[Sturle Dagsland]].\n\n===Community art===\nStavanger participates in the annual Nuart festival, organised for national and international artists who operate outside of the traditional art establishment. Every September, a team of internationally acclaimed street artists contribute to \"one of Europe\u2019s most dynamic and constantly evolving public art events.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.regionstavanger-ryfylke.com/whats-on/nuart-festival-2018-p2321713|title=Nuart Festival 2018 \u2013 Art in Stavanger, Stavanger|website=Region Stavanger & Ryfylke|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Tourism==\n{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}\nEspecially in the summertime, Stavanger's harbour is full of large cruiseships: in 2011 Stavanger hosted 130 cruiseships. The Port of Stavanger is a popular stop on the route to the Norwegian Fjords. The charming city center is just a small walk from the quay.\n\n===Outdoor activities===\nThere are not many outdoor activities in Stavanger itself, however, splendid opportunities are nearby in adjacent municipalities: [[Lysefjorden]] is particularly popular for hiking. Tourists typically visit places like [[Preikestolen]] (aka the Pulpit Rock), and [[Kjeragbolten]]. [[Preikestolen]] is a massive rock overhanging the fjord (604 meters below). [[Kjeragbolten]] is a rock wedged in the cliff approximately 1000 meters above the fjord. The straight fall 1000 meters down to the fjord makes [[Kjerag]] a very popular location for [[BASE jumping]].\n\nNot too far from Stavanger, alpine centers are available for skiers and snowboarders throughout the winter season.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basekjerag.com/rogaland/stavanger/svg_base.nsf/id/2CC0E47A17AB6173C1256E150002B1F9?OpenDocument%7ctitle=basekjerag.com%7cwork=basekjerag.com|title=basekjerag.com}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAlong the coast south of Stavanger there are a number of large, sandy beaches, including at Sola, within close reach from the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stavangertravel.com/welcome/beaches.cfm|title=Beaches of Rogaland in west Norway \u2013 Stavanger Travel|website=www.stavangertravel.com|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===City centre===\n[[File:Gamle Stavanger.jpg|thumb|[[Gamle Stavanger]]]]\n[[File:City map stavanger.png|thumb|left|City centre Stavanger]]\nOld Stavanger ([[Gamle Stavanger]]) is located right next to the city centre and has a collection of 18th- and 19th-century wooden structures.\n\n[[Stavanger domkirke]] (St. Swithun's cathedral) was built between 1100 and 1150 by the English bishop Reinald in [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] style, and in the late 13th century a new choir was added in [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, with a vaulted roof. The cathedral is the only Norwegian cathedral that is almost unchanged since the 14th century.\n\nThe city centre itself is small and intimate, with narrow streets and open spaces protected from car traffic. The open-air vegetable market is one of the very few in Norway where you can buy produce directly from local farmers every working day through the year. Unfortunately, the Market has been in decline of recent years, and now has very few stall holders. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Maincat|People from Stavanger}}\nPer Hovem\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\n{{More citations needed section|dateJuly 2015|date=July 2015}}\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Norway}}\nStavanger has several [[Town twinning|sister cities]]; they are:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n* {{flagicon|UK}} [[Aberdeen]], United Kingdom<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/ACCI/web/site/Tourism/SL/tur_TownTwinning.asp|title=Twinning|publisher=Aberdeen City Council|accessdate=2 March 2008}}</ref>\n* {{flagicon|MAD}} [[Antsirabe]], Madagascar\n* {{flagicon|AZE}} [[Baku]], Azerbaijan\n* {{flagicon|DEN}} [[Esbjerg]], Denmark\n* {{flagicon|SWE}} [[Eskilstuna]], Sweden\n||\n* {{flagicon|NCA}} [[Estel\u00ed]], Nicaragua\n* {{flagicon|US}} [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], United States\n* {{flagicon|GBR}} [[Harlow]], United Kingdom\n* {{flagicon|US}} [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], United States\n* {{flagicon|FIN}} [[Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4]], Finland\n||\n* {{flagicon|BRA}} [[Maca\u00e9]], Brazil<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macae.rj.gov.br/noticias/leitura?noticia=27089  |title=Prefeito recebe comitiva da Noruega interessada em investir em Maca\u00e9 |accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref>\n* {{flagicon|ERI}} [[Massawa]], Eritrea\n* {{flagicon|AUS}} [[Melbourne]], Australia\n* {{flagicon|PLE}} [[Nablus]], Palestine\n* {{flagicon|ISL}} [[Neskaupsta\u00f0ur]], Iceland\n* {{flagicon|ISR}} [[Netanya]], Israel<ref name=\"Netanya twinnings\">{{cite web|url=http://www.netanya.muni.il/eng/?CategoryID=1779|title=Netanya \u2013 Twin Cities|accessdate=1 August 2013|work=Netanya Municipality|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201094809/http://www.netanya.muni.il/Eng/?CategoryID=1779|archivedate=1 February 2013}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage}}\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Portal|Norway}}\n* [http://ssb.no/kommunefakta/stavanger Municipal fact sheet] from [[Statistics Norway]] {{in lang|no}}\n* [http://www.stavanger.kommune.no/ Municipality web site]\n* [http://www.stavanger-guide.com/ Official city maps]\n* [http://www.stavanger-web.com/ Stavanger Web]\n* [http://www.regionstavanger.com/en/ Official web site of the region Stavanger]\n* {{Wikivoyage-inline}}\n\n{{Rogaland}}\n{{Most populous metropolitan areas in Norway}}\n{{50 most populous Nordic urban settlements}}\n{{European Capital of Culture}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Norway]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in Norway]]\n[[Category:Stavanger| ]]\n[[Category:J\u00e6ren]]\n[[Category:Port cities and towns in Norway]]\n[[Category:Port cities and towns of the North Sea]]\n[[Category:Viking Age populated places]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of Rogaland]]\n", "name_user": "Smsinden", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added notable person", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stavanger"}

Since 1664, he was the sole ruler as Duke of Legnica-Brzeg-Wo\u0142\u00f3w-O\u0142awa. He is descended from the Legnica branch of the [[Silesian Piasts]] dynasty.\n\nHe was the seventh but third surviving son of [[John Christian of Brieg|John Christian]], Duke of [[Brzeg]]-[[Legnica]]-[[Wo\u0142\u00f3w]]-[[O\u0142awa]], by his first wife Dorothea Sybille, daughter of [[John George, Elector of Brandenburg]].\n\n==Life==\nIn his early years, along with his older brothers, Christian made his [[Grand Tour]] to Europe, during which he visited the courts of Kings [[Louis XIII of France]] and [[Charles I of England]]. Upon his return to Silesia, his country was in the middle of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. In 1635 the Duke John Christian was sent to Lithuania; at that time, Christian studied in a Calvinist school. During this time, he was allowed to know, among others, King [[John Casimir of Poland]], whose wife [[Ludwika Maria Gonzaga|Louisa Maria]] was the godmother of Christian's short-lived second daughter. Also met his first cousin, Prince [[Bogus\u0142aw Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], whose mother was the sister of Christian's mother. He also knew another future Polish monarch, [[Micha\u0142 Korybut Wi\u015bniowiecki]]. Through teachings at the school in, Christian could learn and mastered the Polish language.\n\nIn 1639 Duke John Christian died and his sons inherited their lands.

In 1642 he survived the 4-week siege of Brzeg by the Swedish. In December 1645 was captured and imprisoned by the Swedish.

Upon his return to Silesia, his country was in the middle of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. In 1635 the Duke John Christian was sent to Lithuania; at that time, Christian studied in a Calvinist school. During this time, he was allowed to know, among others, King [[John Casimir of Poland]], whose wife [[Ludwika Maria Gonzaga|Louisa Maria]] was the godmother of Christian's short-lived second daughter. Also met his first cousin, Prince [[Bogus\u0142aw Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], whose mother was the sister of Christian's mother. He also knew another future Polish monarch, [[Micha\u0142 Korybut Wi\u015bniowiecki]].

One of the motivations for the research is the ability to give machines emotional intelligence, including to simulate [[empathy]]. The machine should interpret the emotional state of humans and adapt its behavior to them, giving an appropriate response to those emotions.\n\n== Areas ==\n\n===Detecting and recognizing emotional information===\nDetecting emotional information usually begins with passive [[sensors]] that capture data about the user's physical state or behavior without interpreting the input. The data gathered is analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others. For example, a video camera might capture facial expressions, body posture, and gestures, while a microphone might capture speech. Other sensors detect emotional cues by directly measuring [[physiological]] data, such as skin temperature and [[galvanic skin response|galvanic resistance]].<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Garay\n | first = Nestor\n |author2=Idoia Cearreta|author3=Juan Miguel L\u00f3pez|author4=Inmaculada Fajardo\n |date=April 2006\n | title = Assistive Technology and Affective Mediation\n | journal = [[Human Technology]]\n | volume = 2\n | issue = 1\n | pages = 55\u201383\n | url = http://www.humantechnology.jyu.fi/articles/volume2/number1/2006/humantechnology-april-2006.pdf\n | accessdate = 2008-05-12\n | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080528135729/http://www.humantechnology.jyu.fi/articles/volume2/number1/2006/humantechnology-april-2006.pdf| archivedate= 28 May 2008 | url-status= live | doi=10.17011/ht/urn.2006159}}</ref>\n\nRecognizing emotional information requires the extraction of meaningful patterns from the gathered data. This is done using machine learning techniques that process different [[Modality_(human\u2013computer_interaction)|modalities]], such as [[speech recognition]], [[natural language processing]], or [[face recognition|facial expression detection]].  The goal of most of these techniques is to produce labels that would match the labels a human perceiver would give in the same situation:  For example, if a person makes a facial expression furrowing their brow, then the computer vision system might be taught to label their face as appearing \"confused\" or as \"concentrating\" or \"slightly negative\" (as opposed to positive, which it might say if they were smiling in a happy-appearing way).  These labels may or may not correspond to what the person is actually feeling.\n\n===Emotion in machines===\nAnother area within affective computing is the design of computational devices proposed to exhibit either innate emotional capabilities or that are capable of convincingly simulating emotions. A more practical approach, based on current technological capabilities, is the simulation of emotions in conversational agents in order to enrich and facilitate interactivity between human and machine.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Heise|first=David|contribution=Enculturating agents with expressive role behavior|year=2004|title=Agent Culture: Human-Agent Interaction in a Mutlicultural World|editor1=Sabine Payr|pages=127\u2013142|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|editor2-first=Robert |editor2-last=Trappl}}</ref>\n\n[[Marvin Minsky]], one of the pioneering computer scientists in [[artificial intelligence]], relates emotions to the broader issues of machine intelligence stating in ''[[The Emotion Machine]]'' that emotion is \"not especially different from the processes that we call 'thinking.'\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/14/AR2006121401554.html|title=Mind Over Matter|last=Restak|first=Richard|date=2006-12-17|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref>\n\n== Technologies ==\nIn psychology, cognitive science, and in neuroscience, there have been two main approaches for describing how humans perceive and classify emotion: continuous or categorical. The continuous approach tends to use dimensions such as negative vs. positive, calm vs. aroused. \n\nThe categorical approach tends to use discrete classes such as happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, disgust.  Different kinds of machine learning regression and classification models can be used for having machines produce continuous or discrete labels.  Sometimes models are also built that allow combinations across the categories, e.g. a happy-surprised face or a fearful-surprised face <ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = A model of the perception of facial expressions of emotion by humans: Research overview and perspectives.|last = Aleix, and Shichuan Du|first = Martinez|date = 2012|journal = The Journal of Machine Learning Research |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1589\u20131608|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>.\n\nThe following sections consider many of the kinds of input data used for the task of [[emotion recognition]].\n\n===Emotional speech===\nVarious changes in the autonomic nervous system can indirectly alter a person's speech, and affective technologies can leverage this information to recognize emotion. For example, speech produced in a state of fear, anger, or joy becomes fast, loud, and precisely enunciated, with a higher and wider range in pitch, whereas emotions such as tiredness, boredom, or sadness tend to generate slow, low-pitched, and slurred speech.<ref>Breazeal, C. and Aryananda, L.

Instead, the series of outputs dependent on the states are visible. In the case of affect recognition, the outputs represent the sequence of speech feature vectors, which allow the deduction of states' sequences through which the model progressed. The states can consist of various intermediate steps in the expression of an emotion, and each of them has a probability distribution over the possible output vectors. The states' sequences allow us to predict the affective state which we are trying to classify, and this is one of the most commonly used techniques within the area of speech affect detection.\n\nIt is proved that having enough acoustic evidence available the emotional state of a person can be classified by a set of majority voting classifiers. The proposed set of classifiers is based on three main classifiers: kNN, C4.5 and SVM-RBF Kernel. This set achieves better performance than each basic classifier taken separately. It is compared with two other sets of classifiers: one-against-all (OAA) multiclass SVM with Hybrid kernels and the set of classifiers which consists of the following two basic classifiers: C5.0 and Neural Network. The proposed variant achieves better performance than the other two sets of classifiers.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/11200/raspoznavanie_i_prognozirovanie_dlitelnyh__emociy_v_rechi_(na_angl._yazyke).htm|title=Extended speech emotion recognition and prediction|author=S.E.

This creates one of the biggest challenges in detecting emotions based on speech, as it implicates choosing an appropriate database used to train the classifier. Most of the currently possessed data was obtained from actors and is thus a representation of archetypal emotions. Those so-called acted databases are usually based on the Basic Emotions theory (by [[Paul Ekman]]), which assumes the existence of six basic emotions (anger, fear, disgust, surprise, joy, sadness), the others simply being a mix of the former ones.<ref name=\"Ekman, P. 1969\">Ekman, P. & Friesen, W. V (1969). The repertoire of nonverbal behavior: Categories, origins, usage, and coding. Semiotica, 1, 49\u201398.</ref> Nevertheless, these still offer high audio quality and balanced classes (although often too few), which contribute to high success rates in recognizing emotions.\n\nHowever, for real life application, naturalistic data is preferred. A naturalistic database can be produced by observation and analysis of subjects in their natural context. Ultimately, such database should allow the system to recognize emotions based on their context as well as work out the goals and outcomes of the interaction. The nature of this type of data allows for authentic real life implementation, due to the fact it describes states naturally occurring during the [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI).\n\nDespite the numerous advantages which naturalistic data has over acted data, it is difficult to obtain and usually has low emotional intensity. Moreover, data obtained in a natural context has lower signal quality, due to surroundings noise and distance of the subjects from the microphone. The first attempt to produce such database was the FAU Aibo Emotion Corpus for CEICES (Combining Efforts for Improving Automatic Classification of Emotional User States), which was developed based on a realistic context of children (age 10-13) playing with Sony's Aibo robot pet.<ref name=\"Steidl-2011\">{{cite web | last = Steidl | first = Stefan | title = FAU Aibo Emotion Corpus | publisher = Pattern Recognition Lab | date = 5 March 2011 | url = http://www5.cs.fau.de/de/mitarbeiter/steidl-stefan/fau-aibo-emotion-corpus/ }}</ref><ref name=\"Scherer-2010-p243\">{{harvnb|Scherer|2010|p=243}}</ref> Likewise, producing one standard database for all emotional research would provide a method of evaluating and comparing different affect recognition systems.\n\n====Speech descriptors====\n\nThe complexity of the affect recognition process increases with the number of classes (affects) and speech descriptors used within the classifier. It is, therefore, crucial to select only the most relevant features in order to assure the ability of the model to successfully identify emotions, as well as increasing the performance, which is particularly significant to real-time detection. The range of possible choices is vast, with some studies mentioning the use of over 200 distinct features.<ref name=\"Scherer-2010-p241\"/> It is crucial to identify those that are redundant and undesirable in order to optimize the system and increase the success rate of correct emotion detection. The most common speech characteristics are categorized into the following groups.<ref name=\"Steidl-2011\"/><ref name=\"Scherer-2010-p243\"/>\n\n# Frequency characteristics\n#* Accent shape \u2013 affected by the rate of change of the fundamental frequency.\n#* Average pitch \u2013 description of how high/low the speaker speaks relative to the normal speech.\n#* Contour slope \u2013 describes the tendency of the frequency change over time, it can be rising, falling or level.\n#* Final lowering \u2013 the amount by which the frequency falls at the end of an utterance.\n#* Pitch range \u2013 measures the spread between the maximum and minimum frequency of an utterance.\n# Time-related features:\n#* Speech rate \u2013 describes the rate of words or syllables uttered over a unit of time\n#* Stress frequency \u2013 measures the rate of occurrences of pitch accented utterances\n# Voice quality parameters and energy descriptors:\n#* Breathiness \u2013 measures the aspiration noise in speech\n#* Brilliance \u2013 describes the dominance of high Or low frequencies In the speech\n#* Loudness \u2013 measures the amplitude of the speech waveform, translates to the energy of an utterance\n#* Pause Discontinuity \u2013 describes the transitions between sound and silence\n#* Pitch Discontinuity \u2013 describes the transitions of the fundamental frequency.\n\n===Facial affect detection===\nThe detection and processing of facial expression are achieved through various methods such as [[optical flow]], [[hidden Markov model]]s, [[neural network|neural network processing]] or active appearance models. More than one modalities can be combined or fused (multimodal recognition, e.g. facial expressions and speech prosody,<ref name=\"face-prosody\">{{cite conference | url = http://www.image.ece.ntua.gr/php/savepaper.php?id=447 | first1 = G. | last1 = Caridakis | first2 = L. | last2 = Malatesta | first3 = L. | last3 = Kessous | first4 = N. | last4 = Amir | first5 = A. | last5 = Raouzaiou | first6 = K. | last6 = Karpouzis | title = Modeling naturalistic affective states via facial and vocal expressions recognition | conference = International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces (ICMI'06) | location = Banff, Alberta, Canada | date = November 2\u20134, 2006 }}</ref> facial expressions and hand gestures,<ref name=\"face-gesture\">{{cite book | chapter-url = http://www.image.ece.ntua.gr/php/savepaper.php?id=334 | first1 = T. | last1 = Balomenos | first2 = A. | last2 = Raouzaiou | first3 = S. | last3 = Ioannou | first4 = A. | last4 = Drosopoulos | first5 = K. | last5 = Karpouzis | first6 = S. | last6 = Kollias | chapter = Emotion Analysis in Man-Machine Interaction Systems | editor1-first = Samy | editor1-last = Bengio | editor2-first = Herve | editor2-last = Bourlard | title = Machine Learning for Multimodal Interaction | series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] | volume = 3361| year = 2004 | pages = 318\u2013328 | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]] }}</ref> or facial expressions with speech and text for multimodal data and metadata analysis) to provide a more robust estimation of the subject's emotional state.\n\n==== Facial expression databases ====\n{{Main|Facial expression databases}}\nCreation of an emotion database is a difficult and time-consuming task. However, database creation is an essential step in the creation of a system that will recognize human emotions. Most of the publicly available emotion databases include posed facial expressions only. In posed expression databases, the participants are asked to display different basic emotional expressions, while in spontaneous expression database, the expressions are natural. Spontaneous emotion elicitation requires significant effort in the selection of proper stimuli which can lead to a rich display of intended emotions. Secondly, the process involves tagging of emotions by trained individuals manually which makes the databases highly reliable. Since perception of expressions and their intensity is subjective in nature, the annotation by experts is essential for the purpose of validation.\n\nResearchers work with three types of databases, such as a database of peak expression images only, a database of image sequences portraying an emotion from neutral to its peak, and video clips with emotional annotations. Many facial expression databases have been created and made public for expression recognition purpose. Two of the widely used databases are CK+ and JAFFE.\n\n====Emotion classification====\n{{Main|Emotion classification}}\nBy doing cross-cultural research in Papua New Guinea, on the Fore Tribesmen, at the end of the 1960s, [[Paul Ekman]] proposed the idea that facial expressions of emotion are not culturally determined, but universal. Thus, he suggested that they are biological in origin and can, therefore, be safely and correctly categorized.<ref name=\"Ekman, P. 1969\"/>\nHe therefore officially put forth six basic emotions, in 1972:<ref>{{cite conference | last = Ekman | first =  Paul | authorlink = Paul Ekman | year = 1972 | title = Universals and Cultural Differences in Facial Expression of Emotion | editor-first = J. | editor-last = Cole | conference = Nebraska Symposium on Motivation | location = Lincoln, Nebraska | publisher = University of Nebraska Press | pages = 207\u2013283 }}</ref>\n\n* [[Anger]]\n* [[Disgust]]\n* [[Fear]]\n* [[Happiness]]\n* [[Sadness]]\n* [[Surprise (emotion)|Surprise]]\n\nHowever, in the 1990s Ekman expanded his list of basic emotions, including a range of positive and negative emotions not all of which are encoded in facial muscles.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ekman |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Ekman |year=1999 |url=http://www.paulekman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Basic-Emotions.pdf |contribution=Basic Emotions |editor1-first=T |editor1-last=Dalgleish |editor2-first=M |editor2-last=Power |title=Handbook of Cognition and Emotion |place=Sussex, UK |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228085345/http://www.paulekman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Basic-Emotions.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-28 }}.</ref> The newly included emotions are:\n# [[Amusement]]\n# [[Contempt]]\n# [[Contentment]]\n# [[Embarrassment]]\n# [[Anticipation (emotion)|Excitement]]\n# [[Guilt (emotion)|Guilt]]\n# [[Pride| Pride in achievement]]\n# [[Relief]]\n# [[Contentment|Satisfaction]]\n# [[Pleasure|Sensory pleasure]]\n# [[Shame]]\n\n====Facial Action Coding System====\n{{Main|Facial Action Coding System}}\n\nA system has been conceived by psychologists in order to formally categorize the physical expression of emotions on faces. The central concept of the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, as created by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in 1978 based on earlier work by Carl-Herman Hjortsj\u00f6<ref>[http://face-and-emotion.com/dataface/facs/description.jsp \"Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and the FACS Manual\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019130324/http://face-and-emotion.com/dataface/facs/description.jsp |date=October 19, 2013 }}. A Human Face. Retrieved 21 March 2011.</ref> are action units (AU).\nThey are, basically, a contraction or a relaxation of one or more muscles. Psychologists have proposed the following classification of six basic emotions, according to their action units (\"+\" here mean \"and\"):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Emotion !! Action units\n|-\n| Happiness ||6+12\n|-\n| Sadness || 1+4+15\n|-\n| Surprise ||  1+2+5B+26\n|-\n| Fear || 1+2+4+5+20+26\n|-\n| Anger || 4+5+7+23\n|-\n| Disgust || 9+15+16\n|-\n| Contempt || R12A+R14A\n|}\n\n====Challenges in facial detection====\nAs with every computational practice, in affect detection by facial processing, some obstacles need to be surpassed, in order to fully unlock the hidden potential of the overall algorithm or method employed. In the early days of almost every kind of AI-based detection (speech recognition, face recognition, affect recognition), the accuracy of modeling and tracking has been an issue. As hardware evolves, as more data are collected and as new discoveries are made and new practices introduced, this lack of accuracy fades, leaving behind noise issues. However, methods for noise removal exist including neighborhood averaging, [[Gaussian blur|linear Gaussian smoothing]], median filtering,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/OWENS/LECT5/node3.html|title=Spatial domain methods}}</ref> or newer methods such as the Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm.<ref>Clever Algorithms.

Retrieved 21 March 2011.</ref><ref>[http://www.softcomputing.net/bfoa-chapter.pdf \"Soft Computing\"]. Soft Computing. Retrieved 18 March 2011.</ref>\n\nOther challenges include\n* The fact that posed expressions, as used by most subjects of the various studies, are not natural, and therefore algorithms trained on these may not apply to natural expressions.\n* The lack of rotational movement freedom. Affect detection works very well with frontal use, but upon rotating the head more than 20 degrees, \"there've been problems\".<ref>Williams, Mark. [http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/18796/?a=f \"Better Face-Recognition Software \u2013 Technology Review\"]. Technology Review: The Authority on the Future of Technology. Retrieved 21 March 2011.</ref>\n* Facial expressions do not always correspond to an underlying emotion that matches them (e.g. they can be posed or faked, or a person can feel emotions but maintain a \"poker face\").\n* FACS did not include dynamics, while dynamics can help disambiguate (e.g. smiles of genuine happiness tend to have different dynamics than \"try to look happy\" smiles.)\n* The FACS combinations do not correspond in a 1:1 way with the emotions that the psychologists originally proposed  (note that this lack of a 1:1 mapping also occurs in speech recognition with homophones and homonyms and many other sources of ambiguity, and may be mitigated by bringing in other channels of information).\n* Accuracy of recognition is improved by adding context; however, adding context and other modalities increases computational cost and complexity \n\n===Body gesture===\n{{Main|Gesture recognition}}\nGestures could be efficiently used as a means of detecting a particular emotional state of the user, especially when used in conjunction with speech and face recognition. Depending on the specific action, gestures could be simple reflexive responses, like lifting your shoulders when you don't know the answer to a question, or they could be complex and meaningful as when communicating with sign language. Without making use of any object or surrounding environment, we can wave our hands, clap or beckon. On the other hand, when using objects, we can point at them, move, touch or handle these. A computer should be able to recognize these, analyze the context and respond in a meaningful way, in order to be efficiently used for Human-Computer Interaction.\n\nThere are many proposed methods<ref name=\"JK\">J. K. Aggarwal, Q. Cai, Human Motion Analysis: A Review, Computer Vision and Image Understanding, Vol. 73, No. 3, 1999</ref> to detect the body gesture. Some literature differentiates 2 different approaches in gesture recognition: a 3D model based and an appearance-based.<ref name=\"Vladimir\">{{cite journal | first1 = Vladimir I. | last1 = Pavlovic | first2 = Rajeev | last2 = Sharma | first3 = Thomas S. | last3 = Huang | url = http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~vladimir/pub/pavlovic97pami.pdf | title = Visual Interpretation of Hand Gestures for Human-Computer Interaction: A Review | journal = [[IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence]] | volume = 19 | issue = 7 | pages = 677\u2013695 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1109/34.598226 }}</ref> The foremost method makes use of 3D information of key elements of the body parts in order to obtain several important parameters, like palm position or joint angles. On the other hand, appearance-based systems use images or videos to for direct interpretation. Hand gestures have been a common focus of body gesture detection methods<ref name=\"Vladimir\"/>.\n\n===Physiological monitoring===\nThis could be used to detect a user's affective state by monitoring and analyzing their physiological signs. These signs range from changes in heart rate and skin conductance to minute contractions of the facial muscles and changes in facial blood flow. This area is gaining momentum and we are now seeing real products which implement the techniques. The four main physiological signs that are usually analyzed are [[Pulse|blood volume pulse]], [[Skin conductance|galvanic skin response]], [[facial electromyography]], and facial color patterns.\n\n====Blood volume pulse====\n\n=====Overview=====\n\nA subject's blood volume pulse (BVP) can be measured by a process called photoplethysmography, which produces a graph indicating blood flow through the extremities.<ref name=\"Picard, Rosalind 1998\">Picard, Rosalind (1998). Affective Computing. MIT.</ref> The peaks of the waves indicate a cardiac cycle where the heart has pumped blood to the extremities. If the subject experiences fear or is startled, their heart usually 'jumps' and beats quickly for some time, causing the amplitude of the cardiac cycle to increase. This can clearly be seen on a photoplethysmograph when the distance between the trough and the peak of the wave has decreased. As the subject calms down, and as the body's inner core expands, allowing more blood to flow back to the extremities, the cycle will return to normal.\n\n=====Methodology=====\n\nInfra-red light is shone on the skin by special sensor hardware, and the amount of light reflected is measured. The amount of reflected and transmitted light correlates to the BVP as light is absorbed by hemoglobin which is found richly in the blood stream.\n\n=====Disadvantages=====\n\nIt can be cumbersome to ensure that the sensor shining an infra-red light and monitoring the reflected light is always pointing at the same extremity, especially seeing as subjects often stretch and readjust their position while using a computer.\nThere are other factors which can affect one's blood volume pulse. As it is a measure of blood flow through the extremities, if the subject feels hot, or particularly cold, then their body may allow more, or less, blood to flow to the extremities, all of this regardless of the subject's emotional state.\n\n[[File:Em-face-2.png|thumb|left| The corrugator supercilii muscle and zygomaticus major muscle are the 2 main muscles used for measuring the electrical activity, in facial electromyography]]\n\n====Facial electromyography====\n{{Main|Facial electromyography}}\n\nFacial electromyography is a technique used to measure the electrical activity of the facial muscles by amplifying the tiny electrical impulses that are generated by muscle fibers when they contract.<ref name=\"Larsen JT 2003\">Larsen JT, Norris CJ, Cacioppo JT, \"[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c3a5/4bfbaaade376aee951fe8578e6436be59861.pdf Effects of positive and negative affect on electromyographic activity over zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii]\", (September 2003)</ref>\nThe face expresses a great deal of emotion, however, there are two main facial muscle groups that are usually studied to detect emotion:\nThe corrugator supercilii muscle, also known as the 'frowning' muscle, draws the brow down into a frown, and therefore is the best test for negative, unpleasant emotional response.\u21b5The zygomaticus major muscle is responsible for pulling the corners of the mouth back when you smile, and therefore is the muscle used to test for a positive emotional response.\n\n[[File:Gsrplot.svg|500px|thumb|Here we can see a plot of skin resistance measured using GSR and time whilst the subject played a video game. There are several peaks that are clear in the graph, which suggests that GSR is a good method of differentiating between an aroused and a non-aroused state. For example, at the start of the game where there is usually not much exciting game play, there is a high level of resistance recorded, which suggests a low level of conductivity and therefore less arousal. This is in clear contrast with the sudden trough where the player is killed as one is usually very stressed and tense as their character is killed in the game]]\n\n====Galvanic skin response====\n{{Main|Galvanic skin response}}\n\nGalvanic skin response (GSR) is an outdated term for a more general phenomenon known as [Electrodermal Activity] or EDA.  EDA is a general phenomena whereby the skin's electrical properties change.  The skin is innervated by the [sympathetic nervous system], so measuring its resistance or conductance provides a way to quantify small changes in the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system.  As the sweat glands are activated, even before the skin feels sweaty, the level of the EDA can be captured (usually using conductance) and used to discern small changes in autonomic arousal.  The more aroused a subject is, the greater the skin conductance tends to be.<ref name=\"Picard, Rosalind 1998\"/> \n\nSkin conductance is often measured using two small [[silver-silver chloride]] electrodes placed somewhere on the skin and applying a small voltage between them. To maximize comfort and reduce irritation the electrodes can be placed on the wrist, legs, or feet, which leaves the hands fully free for daily activity.\n====Facial color====\n\n=====Overview=====\n\nThe surface of the human face is innervated with a large network of blood vessels. Blood flow variations in these vessels yield visible color changes on the face. Whether or not facial emotions activate facial muscles, variations in blood flow, blood pressure, glucose levels, and other changes occur. Also, the facial color signal is independent from that provided by facial muscle movements.<ref name=\"face\">Carlos F. Benitez-Quiroz, Ramprakash Srinivasan, Aleix M.

So, map the above vector onto the better color space and decompose into red-green and yellow-blue channels. Then use deep learning methods to find equivalent emotions.\n\n===Visual aesthetics===\nAesthetics, in the world of art and photography, refers to the principles of the nature and appreciation of beauty. Judging beauty and other aesthetic qualities is a highly subjective task. Computer scientists at Penn State treat the challenge of automatically inferring the aesthetic quality of pictures using their visual content as a machine learning problem, with a peer-rated on-line photo sharing website as a data source.<ref name=\"datta\">Ritendra Datta, Dhiraj Joshi, Jia Li and James Z.

Using affective computing technology, computers can judge the learners' affection and learning state by recognizing their facial expressions. In education, the teacher can use the analysis result to understand the student's learning and accepting ability, and then formulate reasonable teaching plans. At the same time, they can pay attention to students' inner feelings, which is helpful to students' phycological health. Especially in distance education, due to the separation of time and space, there is no emotional incentive between teachers and students for two-way communication. Without the atmosphere brought by traditional classroom learning, students are easily bored, and affect the learning effect. Applying affective computing in distance education system can effectively improve this situation.\n<ref>http://www.learntechlib.org/p/173785/</ref>\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n[[Social robot]]s, as well as a growing number of robots used in health care benefit from emotional awareness because they can better judge users' and patient's emotional states and alter their actions/programming appropriately.

One of the motivations for the research is the ability to give machines emotional intelligence, including to simulate [[empathy]]. The machine should interpret the emotional state of humans and adapt its behavior to them, giving an appropriate response to those emotions.\n\n== Areas ==\n\n===Detecting and recognizing emotional information===\nDetecting emotional information usually begins with passive [[sensors]] that capture data about the user's physical state or behavior without interpreting the input. The data gathered is analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others. For example, a video camera might capture facial expressions, body posture, and gestures, while a microphone might capture speech. Other sensors detect emotional cues by directly measuring [[physiological]] data, such as skin temperature and [[galvanic skin response|galvanic resistance]].<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Garay\n | first = Nestor\n |author2=Idoia Cearreta|author3=Juan Miguel L\u00f3pez|author4=Inmaculada Fajardo\n |date=April 2006\n | title = Assistive Technology and Affective Mediation\n | journal = [[Human Technology]]\n | volume = 2\n | issue = 1\n | pages = 55\u201383\n | url = http://www.humantechnology.jyu.fi/articles/volume2/number1/2006/humantechnology-april-2006.pdf\n | accessdate = 2008-05-12\n | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080528135729/http://www.humantechnology.jyu.fi/articles/volume2/number1/2006/humantechnology-april-2006.pdf| archivedate= 28 May 2008 | url-status= live | doi=10.17011/ht/urn.2006159}}</ref>\n\nRecognizing emotional information requires the extraction of meaningful patterns from the gathered data. This is done using machine learning techniques that process different modalities, such as [[speech recognition]], [[natural language processing]], or [[face recognition|facial expression detection]].  The goal of most of these techniques is to produce labels that would match the labels a human perceiver would give in the same situation:  For example, if a person makes a facial expression furrowing their brow, then the computer vision system might be taught to label their face as appearing \"confused\" or as \"concentrating\" or \"slightly negative\" (as opposed to positive, which it might say if they were smiling in a happy-appearing way).  These labels may or may not correspond to what the person is actually feeling.\n\n===Emotion in machines===\nAnother area within affective computing is the design of computational devices proposed to exhibit either innate emotional capabilities or that are capable of convincingly simulating emotions. A more practical approach, based on current technological capabilities, is the simulation of emotions in conversational agents in order to enrich and facilitate interactivity between human and machine.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Heise|first=David|contribution=Enculturating agents with expressive role behavior|year=2004|title=Agent Culture: Human-Agent Interaction in a Mutlicultural World|editor1=Sabine Payr|pages=127\u2013142|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|editor2-first=Robert |editor2-last=Trappl}}</ref>\n\n[[Marvin Minsky]], one of the pioneering computer scientists in [[artificial intelligence]], relates emotions to the broader issues of machine intelligence stating in ''[[The Emotion Machine]]'' that emotion is \"not especially different from the processes that we call 'thinking.'\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/14/AR2006121401554.html|title=Mind Over Matter|last=Restak|first=Richard|date=2006-12-17|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref>\n\n== Technologies ==\nIn psychology, cognitive science, and in neuroscience, there have been two main approaches for describing how humans perceive and classify emotion: continuous or categorical. The continuous approach tends to use dimensions such as negative vs. positive, calm vs. aroused. \n\nThe categorical approach tends to use discrete classes such as happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, disgust.  Different kinds of machine learning regression and classification models can be used for having machines produce continuous or discrete labels.  Sometimes models are also built that allow combinations across the categories, e.g. a happy-surprised face or a fearful-surprised face <ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = A model of the perception of facial expressions of emotion by humans: Research overview and perspectives.|last = Aleix, and Shichuan Du|first = Martinez|date = 2012|journal = The Journal of Machine Learning Research |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1589\u20131608|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>.\n\nThe following sections consider many of the kinds of input data used for the task of [[emotion recognition]].\n\n===Emotional speech===\nVarious changes in the autonomic nervous system can indirectly alter a person's speech, and affective technologies can leverage this information to recognize emotion. For example, speech produced in a state of fear, anger, or joy becomes fast, loud, and precisely enunciated, with a higher and wider range in pitch, whereas emotions such as tiredness, boredom, or sadness tend to generate slow, low-pitched, and slurred speech.<ref>Breazeal, C. and Aryananda, L.

The majority vote decides on the classification.\n* [[Gaussian mixture model|GMM]] \u2013 is a probabilistic model used for representing the existence of subpopulations within the overall population. Each sub-population is described using the mixture distribution, which allows for classification of observations into the sub-populations.<ref>[http://cnx.org/content/m13205/latest/ \"Gaussian Mixture Model\"]. Connexions \u2013 Sharing Knowledge and Building Communities. Retrieved 10 March 2011.</ref>\n* [[Support vector machine|SVM]] \u2013 is a type of (usually binary) linear classifier which decides in which of the two (or more) possible classes, each input may fall into.\n* [[Artificial neural network|ANN]] \u2013 is a mathematical model, inspired by biological neural networks, that can better grasp possible non-linearities of the feature space.\n* [[Decision tree learning|Decision tree algorithms]] \u2013 work based on following a decision tree in which leaves represent the classification outcome, and branches represent the conjunction of subsequent features that lead to the classification.\n* [[Hidden Markov model|HMMs]] \u2013 a statistical Markov model in which the states and state transitions are not directly available to observation. Instead, the series of outputs dependent on the states are visible. In the case of affect recognition, the outputs represent the sequence of speech feature vectors, which allow the deduction of states' sequences through which the model progressed. The states can consist of various intermediate steps in the expression of an emotion, and each of them has a probability distribution over the possible output vectors. The states' sequences allow us to predict the affective state which we are trying to classify, and this is one of the most commonly used techniques within the area of speech affect detection.\n\nIt is proved that having enough acoustic evidence available the emotional state of a person can be classified by a set of majority voting classifiers. The proposed set of classifiers is based on three main classifiers: kNN, C4.5 and SVM-RBF Kernel. This set achieves better performance than each basic classifier taken separately. It is compared with two other sets of classifiers: one-against-all (OAA) multiclass SVM with Hybrid kernels and the set of classifiers which consists of the following two basic classifiers: C5.0 and Neural Network. The proposed variant achieves better performance than the other two sets of classifiers.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/11200/raspoznavanie_i_prognozirovanie_dlitelnyh__emociy_v_rechi_(na_angl._yazyke).htm|title=Extended speech emotion recognition and prediction|author=S.E.

This creates one of the biggest challenges in detecting emotions based on speech, as it implicates choosing an appropriate database used to train the classifier. Most of the currently possessed data was obtained from actors and is thus a representation of archetypal emotions. Those so-called acted databases are usually based on the Basic Emotions theory (by [[Paul Ekman]]), which assumes the existence of six basic emotions (anger, fear, disgust, surprise, joy, sadness), the others simply being a mix of the former ones.<ref name=\"Ekman, P. 1969\">Ekman, P. & Friesen, W. V (1969). The repertoire of nonverbal behavior: Categories, origins, usage, and coding. Semiotica, 1, 49\u201398.</ref> Nevertheless, these still offer high audio quality and balanced classes (although often too few), which contribute to high success rates in recognizing emotions.\n\nHowever, for real life application, naturalistic data is preferred. A naturalistic database can be produced by observation and analysis of subjects in their natural context. Ultimately, such database should allow the system to recognize emotions based on their context as well as work out the goals and outcomes of the interaction. The nature of this type of data allows for authentic real life implementation, due to the fact it describes states naturally occurring during the [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI).\n\nDespite the numerous advantages which naturalistic data has over acted data, it is difficult to obtain and usually has low emotional intensity. Moreover, data obtained in a natural context has lower signal quality, due to surroundings noise and distance of the subjects from the microphone. The first attempt to produce such database was the FAU Aibo Emotion Corpus for CEICES (Combining Efforts for Improving Automatic Classification of Emotional User States), which was developed based on a realistic context of children (age 10-13) playing with Sony's Aibo robot pet.<ref name=\"Steidl-2011\">{{cite web | last = Steidl | first = Stefan | title = FAU Aibo Emotion Corpus | publisher = Pattern Recognition Lab | date = 5 March 2011 | url = http://www5.cs.fau.de/de/mitarbeiter/steidl-stefan/fau-aibo-emotion-corpus/ }}</ref><ref name=\"Scherer-2010-p243\">{{harvnb|Scherer|2010|p=243}}</ref> Likewise, producing one standard database for all emotional research would provide a method of evaluating and comparing different affect recognition systems.\n\n====Speech descriptors====\n\nThe complexity of the affect recognition process increases with the number of classes (affects) and speech descriptors used within the classifier. It is, therefore, crucial to select only the most relevant features in order to assure the ability of the model to successfully identify emotions, as well as increasing the performance, which is particularly significant to real-time detection. The range of possible choices is vast, with some studies mentioning the use of over 200 distinct features.<ref name=\"Scherer-2010-p241\"/> It is crucial to identify those that are redundant and undesirable in order to optimize the system and increase the success rate of correct emotion detection. The most common speech characteristics are categorized into the following groups.<ref name=\"Steidl-2011\"/><ref name=\"Scherer-2010-p243\"/>\n\n# Frequency characteristics\n#* Accent shape \u2013 affected by the rate of change of the fundamental frequency.\n#* Average pitch \u2013 description of how high/low the speaker speaks relative to the normal speech.\n#* Contour slope \u2013 describes the tendency of the frequency change over time, it can be rising, falling or level.\n#* Final lowering \u2013 the amount by which the frequency falls at the end of an utterance.\n#* Pitch range \u2013 measures the spread between the maximum and minimum frequency of an utterance.\n# Time-related features:\n#* Speech rate \u2013 describes the rate of words or syllables uttered over a unit of time\n#* Stress frequency \u2013 measures the rate of occurrences of pitch accented utterances\n# Voice quality parameters and energy descriptors:\n#* Breathiness \u2013 measures the aspiration noise in speech\n#* Brilliance \u2013 describes the dominance of high Or low frequencies In the speech\n#* Loudness \u2013 measures the amplitude of the speech waveform, translates to the energy of an utterance\n#* Pause Discontinuity \u2013 describes the transitions between sound and silence\n#* Pitch Discontinuity \u2013 describes the transitions of the fundamental frequency.\n\n===Facial affect detection===\nThe detection and processing of facial expression are achieved through various methods such as [[optical flow]], [[hidden Markov model]]s, [[neural network|neural network processing]] or active appearance models. More than one modalities can be combined or fused (multimodal recognition, e.g. facial expressions and speech prosody,<ref name=\"face-prosody\">{{cite conference | url = http://www.image.ece.ntua.gr/php/savepaper.php?id=447 | first1 = G. | last1 = Caridakis | first2 = L. | last2 = Malatesta | first3 = L. | last3 = Kessous | first4 = N. | last4 = Amir | first5 = A. | last5 = Raouzaiou | first6 = K. | last6 = Karpouzis | title = Modeling naturalistic affective states via facial and vocal expressions recognition | conference = International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces (ICMI'06) | location = Banff, Alberta, Canada | date = November 2\u20134, 2006 }}</ref> facial expressions and hand gestures,<ref name=\"face-gesture\">{{cite book | chapter-url = http://www.image.ece.ntua.gr/php/savepaper.php?id=334 | first1 = T. | last1 = Balomenos | first2 = A. | last2 = Raouzaiou | first3 = S. | last3 = Ioannou | first4 = A. | last4 = Drosopoulos | first5 = K. | last5 = Karpouzis | first6 = S. | last6 = Kollias | chapter = Emotion Analysis in Man-Machine Interaction Systems | editor1-first = Samy | editor1-last = Bengio | editor2-first = Herve | editor2-last = Bourlard | title = Machine Learning for Multimodal Interaction | series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] | volume = 3361| year = 2004 | pages = 318\u2013328 | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]] }}</ref> or facial expressions with speech and text for multimodal data and metadata analysis) to provide a more robust estimation of the subject's emotional state.\n\n==== Facial expression databases ====\n{{Main|Facial expression databases}}\nCreation of an emotion database is a difficult and time-consuming task. However, database creation is an essential step in the creation of a system that will recognize human emotions. Most of the publicly available emotion databases include posed facial expressions only. In posed expression databases, the participants are asked to display different basic emotional expressions, while in spontaneous expression database, the expressions are natural. Spontaneous emotion elicitation requires significant effort in the selection of proper stimuli which can lead to a rich display of intended emotions. Secondly, the process involves tagging of emotions by trained individuals manually which makes the databases highly reliable. Since perception of expressions and their intensity is subjective in nature, the annotation by experts is essential for the purpose of validation.\n\nResearchers work with three types of databases, such as a database of peak expression images only, a database of image sequences portraying an emotion from neutral to its peak, and video clips with emotional annotations. Many facial expression databases have been created and made public for expression recognition purpose. Two of the widely used databases are CK+ and JAFFE.\n\n====Emotion classification====\n{{Main|Emotion classification}}\nBy doing cross-cultural research in Papua New Guinea, on the Fore Tribesmen, at the end of the 1960s, [[Paul Ekman]] proposed the idea that facial expressions of emotion are not culturally determined, but universal. Thus, he suggested that they are biological in origin and can, therefore, be safely and correctly categorized.<ref name=\"Ekman, P. 1969\"/>\nHe therefore officially put forth six basic emotions, in 1972:<ref>{{cite conference | last = Ekman | first =  Paul | authorlink = Paul Ekman | year = 1972 | title = Universals and Cultural Differences in Facial Expression of Emotion | editor-first = J. | editor-last = Cole | conference = Nebraska Symposium on Motivation | location = Lincoln, Nebraska | publisher = University of Nebraska Press | pages = 207\u2013283 }}</ref>\n\n* [[Anger]]\n* [[Disgust]]\n* [[Fear]]\n* [[Happiness]]\n* [[Sadness]]\n* [[Surprise (emotion)|Surprise]]\n\nHowever, in the 1990s Ekman expanded his list of basic emotions, including a range of positive and negative emotions not all of which are encoded in facial muscles.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ekman |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Ekman |year=1999 |url=http://www.paulekman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Basic-Emotions.pdf |contribution=Basic Emotions |editor1-first=T |editor1-last=Dalgleish |editor2-first=M |editor2-last=Power |title=Handbook of Cognition and Emotion |place=Sussex, UK |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228085345/http://www.paulekman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Basic-Emotions.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-28 }}.</ref> The newly included emotions are:\n# [[Amusement]]\n# [[Contempt]]\n# [[Contentment]]\n# [[Embarrassment]]\n# [[Anticipation (emotion)|Excitement]]\n# [[Guilt (emotion)|Guilt]]\n# [[Pride| Pride in achievement]]\n# [[Relief]]\n# [[Contentment|Satisfaction]]\n# [[Pleasure|Sensory pleasure]]\n# [[Shame]]\n\n====Facial Action Coding System====\n{{Main|Facial Action Coding System}}\n\nA system has been conceived by psychologists in order to formally categorize the physical expression of emotions on faces. The central concept of the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, as created by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in 1978 based on earlier work by Carl-Herman Hjortsj\u00f6<ref>[http://face-and-emotion.com/dataface/facs/description.jsp \"Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and the FACS Manual\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019130324/http://face-and-emotion.com/dataface/facs/description.jsp |date=October 19, 2013 }}. A Human Face. Retrieved 21 March 2011.</ref> are action units (AU).\nThey are, basically, a contraction or a relaxation of one or more muscles. Psychologists have proposed the following classification of six basic emotions, according to their action units (\"+\" here mean \"and\"):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Emotion !! Action units\n|-\n| Happiness ||6+12\n|-\n| Sadness || 1+4+15\n|-\n| Surprise ||  1+2+5B+26\n|-\n| Fear || 1+2+4+5+20+26\n|-\n| Anger || 4+5+7+23\n|-\n| Disgust || 9+15+16\n|-\n| Contempt || R12A+R14A\n|}\n\n====Challenges in facial detection====\nAs with every computational practice, in affect detection by facial processing, some obstacles need to be surpassed, in order to fully unlock the hidden potential of the overall algorithm or method employed. In the early days of almost every kind of AI-based detection (speech recognition, face recognition, affect recognition), the accuracy of modeling and tracking has been an issue. As hardware evolves, as more data are collected and as new discoveries are made and new practices introduced, this lack of accuracy fades, leaving behind noise issues. However, methods for noise removal exist including neighborhood averaging, [[Gaussian blur|linear Gaussian smoothing]], median filtering,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/OWENS/LECT5/node3.html|title=Spatial domain methods}}</ref> or newer methods such as the Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm.<ref>Clever Algorithms.

Retrieved 21 March 2011.</ref><ref>[http://www.softcomputing.net/bfoa-chapter.pdf \"Soft Computing\"]. Soft Computing. Retrieved 18 March 2011.</ref>\n\nOther challenges include\n* The fact that posed expressions, as used by most subjects of the various studies, are not natural, and therefore algorithms trained on these may not apply to natural expressions.\n* The lack of rotational movement freedom. Affect detection works very well with frontal use, but upon rotating the head more than 20 degrees, \"there've been problems\".<ref>Williams, Mark. [http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/18796/?a=f \"Better Face-Recognition Software \u2013 Technology Review\"]. Technology Review: The Authority on the Future of Technology. Retrieved 21 March 2011.</ref>\n* Facial expressions do not always correspond to an underlying emotion that matches them (e.g. they can be posed or faked, or a person can feel emotions but maintain a \"poker face\").\n* FACS did not include dynamics, while dynamics can help disambiguate (e.g. smiles of genuine happiness tend to have different dynamics than \"try to look happy\" smiles.)\n* The FACS combinations do not correspond in a 1:1 way with the emotions that the psychologists originally proposed  (note that this lack of a 1:1 mapping also occurs in speech recognition with homophones and homonyms and many other sources of ambiguity, and may be mitigated by bringing in other channels of information).\n* Accuracy of recognition is improved by adding context; however, adding context and other modalities increases computational cost and complexity \n\n===Body gesture===\n{{Main|Gesture recognition}}\nGestures could be efficiently used as a means of detecting a particular emotional state of the user, especially when used in conjunction with speech and face recognition. Depending on the specific action, gestures could be simple reflexive responses, like lifting your shoulders when you don't know the answer to a question, or they could be complex and meaningful as when communicating with sign language. Without making use of any object or surrounding environment, we can wave our hands, clap or beckon. On the other hand, when using objects, we can point at them, move, touch or handle these. A computer should be able to recognize these, analyze the context and respond in a meaningful way, in order to be efficiently used for Human-Computer Interaction.\n\nThere are many proposed methods<ref name=\"JK\">J. K. Aggarwal, Q. Cai, Human Motion Analysis: A Review, Computer Vision and Image Understanding, Vol. 73, No. 3, 1999</ref> to detect the body gesture. Some literature differentiates 2 different approaches in gesture recognition: a 3D model based and an appearance-based.<ref name=\"Vladimir\">{{cite journal | first1 = Vladimir I. | last1 = Pavlovic | first2 = Rajeev | last2 = Sharma | first3 = Thomas S. | last3 = Huang | url = http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~vladimir/pub/pavlovic97pami.pdf | title = Visual Interpretation of Hand Gestures for Human-Computer Interaction: A Review | journal = [[IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence]] | volume = 19 | issue = 7 | pages = 677\u2013695 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1109/34.598226 }}</ref> The foremost method makes use of 3D information of key elements of the body parts in order to obtain several important parameters, like palm position or joint angles. On the other hand, appearance-based systems use images or videos to for direct interpretation. Hand gestures have been a common focus of body gesture detection methods<ref name=\"Vladimir\"/>.\n\n===Physiological monitoring===\nThis could be used to detect a user's affective state by monitoring and analyzing their physiological signs. These signs range from changes in heart rate and skin conductance to minute contractions of the facial muscles and changes in facial blood flow. This area is gaining momentum and we are now seeing real products which implement the techniques. The four main physiological signs that are usually analyzed are [[Pulse|blood volume pulse]], [[Skin conductance|galvanic skin response]], [[facial electromyography]], and facial color patterns.\n\n====Blood volume pulse====\n\n=====Overview=====\n\nA subject's blood volume pulse (BVP) can be measured by a process called photoplethysmography, which produces a graph indicating blood flow through the extremities.<ref name=\"Picard, Rosalind 1998\">Picard, Rosalind (1998). Affective Computing. MIT.</ref> The peaks of the waves indicate a cardiac cycle where the heart has pumped blood to the extremities. If the subject experiences fear or is startled, their heart usually 'jumps' and beats quickly for some time, causing the amplitude of the cardiac cycle to increase. This can clearly be seen on a photoplethysmograph when the distance between the trough and the peak of the wave has decreased. As the subject calms down, and as the body's inner core expands, allowing more blood to flow back to the extremities, the cycle will return to normal.\n\n=====Methodology=====\n\nInfra-red light is shone on the skin by special sensor hardware, and the amount of light reflected is measured. The amount of reflected and transmitted light correlates to the BVP as light is absorbed by hemoglobin which is found richly in the blood stream.\n\n=====Disadvantages=====\n\nIt can be cumbersome to ensure that the sensor shining an infra-red light and monitoring the reflected light is always pointing at the same extremity, especially seeing as subjects often stretch and readjust their position while using a computer.\nThere are other factors which can affect one's blood volume pulse. As it is a measure of blood flow through the extremities, if the subject feels hot, or particularly cold, then their body may allow more, or less, blood to flow to the extremities, all of this regardless of the subject's emotional state.\n\n[[File:Em-face-2.png|thumb|left| The corrugator supercilii muscle and zygomaticus major muscle are the 2 main muscles used for measuring the electrical activity, in facial electromyography]]\n\n====Facial electromyography====\n{{Main|Facial electromyography}}\n\nFacial electromyography is a technique used to measure the electrical activity of the facial muscles by amplifying the tiny electrical impulses that are generated by muscle fibers when they contract.<ref name=\"Larsen JT 2003\">Larsen JT, Norris CJ, Cacioppo JT, \"[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c3a5/4bfbaaade376aee951fe8578e6436be59861.pdf Effects of positive and negative affect on electromyographic activity over zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii]\", (September 2003)</ref>\nThe face expresses a great deal of emotion, however, there are two main facial muscle groups that are usually studied to detect emotion:\nThe corrugator supercilii muscle, also known as the 'frowning' muscle, draws the brow down into a frown, and therefore is the best test for negative, unpleasant emotional response.\u21b5The zygomaticus major muscle is responsible for pulling the corners of the mouth back when you smile, and therefore is the muscle used to test for a positive emotional response.\n\n[[File:Gsrplot.svg|500px|thumb|Here we can see a plot of skin resistance measured using GSR and time whilst the subject played a video game. There are several peaks that are clear in the graph, which suggests that GSR is a good method of differentiating between an aroused and a non-aroused state. For example, at the start of the game where there is usually not much exciting game play, there is a high level of resistance recorded, which suggests a low level of conductivity and therefore less arousal. This is in clear contrast with the sudden trough where the player is killed as one is usually very stressed and tense as their character is killed in the game]]\n\n====Galvanic skin response====\n{{Main|Galvanic skin response}}\n\nGalvanic skin response (GSR) is an outdated term for a more general phenomenon known as [Electrodermal Activity] or EDA.  EDA is a general phenomena whereby the skin's electrical properties change.  The skin is innervated by the [sympathetic nervous system], so measuring its resistance or conductance provides a way to quantify small changes in the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system.  As the sweat glands are activated, even before the skin feels sweaty, the level of the EDA can be captured (usually using conductance) and used to discern small changes in autonomic arousal.  The more aroused a subject is, the greater the skin conductance tends to be.<ref name=\"Picard, Rosalind 1998\"/> \n\nSkin conductance is often measured using two small [[silver-silver chloride]] electrodes placed somewhere on the skin and applying a small voltage between them. To maximize comfort and reduce irritation the electrodes can be placed on the wrist, legs, or feet, which leaves the hands fully free for daily activity.\n====Facial color====\n\n=====Overview=====\n\nThe surface of the human face is innervated with a large network of blood vessels. Blood flow variations in these vessels yield visible color changes on the face. Whether or not facial emotions activate facial muscles, variations in blood flow, blood pressure, glucose levels, and other changes occur. Also, the facial color signal is independent from that provided by facial muscle movements.<ref name=\"face\">Carlos F. Benitez-Quiroz, Ramprakash Srinivasan, Aleix M.

So, map the above vector onto the better color space and decompose into red-green and yellow-blue channels. Then use deep learning methods to find equivalent emotions.\n\n===Visual aesthetics===\nAesthetics, in the world of art and photography, refers to the principles of the nature and appreciation of beauty. Judging beauty and other aesthetic qualities is a highly subjective task. Computer scientists at Penn State treat the challenge of automatically inferring the aesthetic quality of pictures using their visual content as a machine learning problem, with a peer-rated on-line photo sharing website as a data source.<ref name=\"datta\">Ritendra Datta, Dhiraj Joshi, Jia Li and James Z.

Using affective computing technology, computers can judge the learners' affection and learning state by recognizing their facial expressions. In education, the teacher can use the analysis result to understand the student's learning and accepting ability, and then formulate reasonable teaching plans. At the same time, they can pay attention to students' inner feelings, which is helpful to students' phycological health. Especially in distance education, due to the separation of time and space, there is no emotional incentive between teachers and students for two-way communication. Without the atmosphere brought by traditional classroom learning, students are easily bored, and affect the learning effect. Applying affective computing in distance education system can effectively improve this situation.\n<ref>http://www.learntechlib.org/p/173785/</ref>\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n[[Social robot]]s, as well as a growing number of robots used in health care benefit from emotional awareness because they can better judge users' and patient's emotional states and alter their actions/programming appropriately.

The love god shoots arrows at Shiva, the yogi opens his third eye and burns Kama to ashes. This upsets both Kama's wife [[Rati]] (''Kamadevi'') and his own wife ''Parvati''. ''Rati'' performs her own meditative asceticism for forty days, upon which Shiva understands, forgives out of compassion and restores the god of love. This return of the god of love, is celebrated on the 40th day after Vasant Panchami festival as Holi.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robin Rinehart|title=Contemporary Hinduism: Ritual, Culture, and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hMPYnfS_R90C&pg=PA135 |year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-905-8|pages=135\u2013137}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Michelle Lee|title=Holi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K166DAAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Scobre|isbn=978-1-62920-572-4|pages=8\u201311}}</ref> The Kama legend and its significance to Holi has many variant forms, particularly in South India.<ref>{{cite book|author=Usha Sharma|title=Festivals In Indian Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6OYRUEAF7oC&pg=PA80 |year=2008|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-8324-113-7|pages=80\u201382}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural significance===\nThe Holi festival has a cultural significance among various Hindu traditions of the Indian subcontinent.

Ranjit Singh would celebrate Holi with others in the Bilawal gardens, where decorative tents were set up.

To many Hindus and some non-Hindus, it is a playful cultural event and an excuse to throw coloured water at friends or strangers in jest. It is also observed broadly in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Holi is celebrated at the end of winter, on the last [[full moon]] day of the Hindu luni-solar calendar month marking the spring, making the date vary with the lunar cycle.{{refn|group=note|name=holicalendars|Since ancient times, the Indian subcontinent has had several major [[Hindu calendar]]s, which places Holi and other festivals on different local months even though they mean the same date. Some Hindu calendars emphasise the solar cycle, some the lunar cycle. Further, the regional calendars feature two traditions of Amanta and Purnimanta systems, wherein the similar-sounding months refer to different parts of a lunar cycle, thus further diversifying the nomenclature. The Hindu festival of Holi falls on the first (full moon) day of ''Chaitra'' lunar month's dark fortnight in the Purnimanta system, while the same exact day for Holi is expressed in Amanta system as the lunar day of ''Phalguna Purnima''.<ref name=fuller292>{{cite book|author=Christopher John Fuller|title=The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=To6XSeBUW3oC|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-69112-04-85|pages=291\u2013293}}</ref> Both time measuring and dating systems are equivalent ways of meaning the same thing, they continue to be in use in different regions.<ref name=fuller292/><ref name=\"Reingold2008p275\">{{cite book|author1=Nachum Dershowitz|author2=Edward M.

The night before Holi, bonfires are lit in a ceremony known as Holika Dahan (burning of [[Holika]]) or Little Holi. People gather near fires, sing and dance. The next day, Holi, also known as ''Dhuli'' in Sanskrit, or ''Dhulheti'', ''Dhulandi'' or ''Dhulendi'', is celebrated.\n\nIn Northern parts of India, Children and youth spray coloured powder solutions (''gulal'') at each other, laugh and celebrate, while adults smear dry coloured powder (''abir'') on each other's faces.<ref name=ht/><ref name=ihh/> Visitors to homes are first teased with colours, then served with Holi delicacies (such as ''puranpoli'', ''dahi-bada'' and ''gujia''), desserts and drinks.<ref name=\"williamsholifood\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Andrew Smith|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DOJMAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973496-2|page=185}}</ref><ref>[http://www.holifestival.org/holi-festival.html Holi Festival] see Play of Colors (2009)</ref> After playing with colours, and cleaning up, people bathe, put on clean clothes, and visit friends and family.<ref name=wd/>\n\n{{anchor|Rangapanchami}} Like Holika Dahan, ''Kama Dahanam'' is celebrated in some parts of [[India]].

On top of the pyre is an effigy to signify [[Holika]] who tricked Prahalad into the fire. Inside homes, people stock up on pigments, food, party drinks and festive seasonal foods such as ''[[gujiya]]'', ''[[mathri]]'', ''[[malpua]]s'' and other regional delicacies.\n\n==== Bonfire ====\nOn the eve of Holi, typically at or after sunset, the pyre is lit, signifying [[Holika Dahan]]. The ritual symbolises the victory of good over evil. People gather around the fire to sing and dance.<ref name=wd/>\n\n=== Play ===\n[[File:HoliSelfie.jpg|thumb|Taking a selfie while playing Holi.]]\n\n==== Playing with colours ====\nIn North and Western India, Holi frolic and celebrations begin the morning after the Holika bonfire. There is no tradition of holding ''puja'' (prayer), and the day is for partying and pure enjoyment. Children and young people form groups armed with dry colours, coloured solution and [[water guns]] (''pichkaris''), water balloons filled with coloured water, and other creative means to colour their targets.<ref name=htor/>\n\nTraditionally, washable natural plant-derived colours such as [[turmeric]], [[neem]], [[Butea monosperma|dhak]], and [[kumkum]] were used, but water-based commercial pigments are increasingly used. All colours are used. Everyone in open areas such as streets and parks is game, but inside homes or at doorways only dry powder is used to smear each other's face. People throw colours and get their targets completely coloured up. It is like a [[water fight]], but with coloured water. People take delight in spraying coloured water on each other. By late morning, everyone looks like a canvas of colours. This is why Holi is given the name \"Festival of Colours\".\n\nGroups sing and dance, some playing drums and ''[[dholak]]''. After each stop of fun and play with colours, people offer [[gujiya]], [[mathri]], [[malpua]]s and other traditional delicacies.<ref>[http://blog.zhdk.ch/idss/files/2013/07/final-presentation-Festival-Circle.pdf Holi Festival] Rex Li Indrajeet Deshmukh and Marielle Roth, Festival Circle, IDSS 2013</ref> Cold drinks, including drinks made with marijuana,<ref name=TOIBhang /> are also part of the Holi festivity.\n\n==== Other variations ====\nIn the [[Braj]] region around [[Mathura]], in north India, the festivities may last more than a week.

Locally called Doul Jatra, associated with Satras of [[Barpeta]], Holi is celebrated over two days. On the first day, the burning of clay huts are seen in Barpeta and [[lower Assam]] which signifies the legends of Holika. On the second day of it, Holi is celebrated with colour powders. The Holi songs in chorus devoted to Lord Krishna are also sung in the regions of Barpeta.\n\n====Bihar/Jharkhand====\nHoli is known as ''Phaguwa'' in the local [[Bhojpuri]] dialect. In this region as well, the legend of Holika is prevalent. On the eve of Phalgun Poornima, people light bonfires. They put dried cow dung cakes, wood of the Araad or Redi tree and Holika tree, grains from the fresh harvest and unwanted wood leaves in the bonfire. At the time of Holika people assemble near the pyre. The eldest member of the gathering or a [[purohit]] initiates the lighting. He then smears others with colour as a mark of greeting. Next day the festival is celebrated with colours and a lot of frolic. Traditionally, people also clean their houses to mark the festival.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nHoli Milan is also observed in [[Bihar]], where family members and well-wishers visit each other's family, apply colours ([[abir|abeer]]) on each other's faces, and on feet, if elderly. Usually this takes place on the evening of Holi day after Holi with wet colours is played in the morning through the afternoon. Due to large-scale internal migration issues faced by the people, recently this tradition has slowly begun to transform, and it is common to have Holi Milan on an entirely different day either before or after the actual day of Holi.<ref>{{cite web |title=Holi Milan |url=http://www.indiacitytrip.com/festivals/Destinations-to-enjoy-Festivals-of-India/Holi/east-india.html |website=indiacitytrip.com}}</ref>\n\nChildren and youths take extreme delight in the festival. Though the festival is usually celebrated with colours, in some places people also enjoy celebrating Holi with water solutions of mud or clay. Folk songs are sung at high pitch and people dance to the sound of the [[dholak]] (a two-headed hand-drum) and the spirit of Holi.

On the evening of the first day people light the bonfire. People offer raw coconut and corn to the fire. The second day is the festival of colour or \"Dhuleti\", celebrated by sprinkling coloured water and applying colours to each other.

The girls try to stop them by throwing coloured water on them to commemorate the pranks of Krishna and the cowherd boys to steal butter and \"[[gopi]]s\" while trying to stop the girls. The boy who finally manages to break the pot is crowned the Holi King. Afterwards, the men, who are now very colourful, go out in a large procession to \"alert\" people of Krishna's possible appearance to steal butter from their homes.\n\nIn some places, there is a custom in undivided Hindu families that the woman beats her brother-in-law with a sari rolled up into a rope in a mock rage and tries to drench him with colours, and in turn, the brother-in-law brings sweets (Indian desserts) to her in the evening.<ref>[http://topnews.in/law/files/Holi_3_0.jpg topnews.in], Holi in Gujarat</ref>\n\n====Jammu and Kashmir====\nIn [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]], Holi celebrations are much in line with the general definition of Holi celebrations: a high-spirited festival to mark the beginning of the harvesting of the summer crop, with the throwing of coloured water and powder and singing and dancing.<ref>{{cite web |title=Holi celebration in Jammu and Kashmir |url=https://www.holifestival.org/holi-in-jammu-and-kashmir.html |website=holifestival.org}}</ref>\n\n====Karnataka====\nTraditionally, in rural [[Karnataka]] children collect money and wood in the weeks prior to Holi, and on \"Kamadahana\" night all the wood is put together and lit.

In the evening, the fire is lit. Every household brings a meal and dessert, in the honour of the fire god. Puran Poli is the main delicacy and children shout \"Holi re Holi puranachi poli\". Shimga celebrates the elimination of all evil. The colour celebrations here take place on the day of [[Rang Panchami]], five days after Shimga. During this festival, people are supposed to forget and forgive any rivalries and start new healthy relations with all.\n\n====Manipur====\n[[Meitei people|Manipuris]] celebrate Holi for 6 days. Here, this holiday merges with the festival of [[Yaosang]]. Traditionally, the festival commences with the burning of a thatched hut of hay and twigs. Young children go from house to house to collect money, locally known as ''nakadeng'' (or ''nakatheng''), as gifts on the first two days. The youths at night perform a group folk dance called [[Thabal chongba]] on the full moon night of Lamta ([[Phalgun]]), traditionally accompanied by folk songs and rhythmic beats of the indigenous drum, but nowadays by modern bands and [[fluorescent lamp]]s. In Krishna temples, devotees sing devotional songs, perform dances and celebrate with ''aber'' (''gulal'') wearing traditional white and yellow turbans. On the last day of the festival, large processions are taken out to the main Krishna temple near [[Imphal]] where several cultural activities are held. In recent decades, [[Yaosang]], a type of Indian sport, has become common in many places of the valley, where people of all ages come out to participate in a number of sports that are somewhat altered for the holiday.\n\n====Odisha====\n[[File:Elevation of the black stone arch.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An 1822 drawing showing elevation of a black stone arch in [[Puri]], Odisha.

The ''Mela'' is held at various [[ghats]] along the banks of the River [[Ganges|Ganga]] in Kanpur, to celebrate the Hindus and Muslims who together resisted the [[United Kingdom|British]] forces in the city in 1857.

It takes different forms such as the Baithki Holi, the Khari Holi and the Mahila Holi. In Baithki Holi and Khari Holi, people sing songs with a touch of melody, fun, and spiritualism. These songs are essentially based on classical [[raga]]s. Baithki Holi (\u092c\u0948\u0920\u0915\u0940 \u0939\u094b\u0932\u0940), also known as ''Nirvan Ki Holi'', begins from the premises of temples, where ''Holiyars'' (\u0939\u094b\u0932\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0930) sing Holi songs and people gather to participate, along with playing classical music. The songs are sung in a particular sequence depending on the time of day; for instance, at noon the songs are based on Peelu, Bhimpalasi and Sarang ragas, while evening songs are based on the ragas such as Kalyan, Shyamkalyan and Yaman. The '''Khari Holi''' (\u0916\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u0939\u094b\u0932\u0940) is mostly celebrated in the rural areas of Kumaon.

On the [[Dol Purnima]] day in the early morning, students dress up in saffron-coloured or pure white clothes and wear garlands of fragrant [[flowers]]. They sing and dance to the accompaniment of musical instruments, such as the [[ektara]], [[dubri]], and [[Veena]].

The playful throwing of natural coloured powders, called [[gulal]] has a medicinal significance: the colours are traditionally made of [[neem]], [[kumkum]], [[Turmeric|haldi]], [[bilva]], and other medicinal herbs prescribed by [[Ayurveda|\u0100yurvedic]] doctors.\n\nMany colours are obtained by mixing primary colours. Artisans produce and sell many of the colours from natural sources in dry powder form, in weeks and months preceding Holi. Some of the traditional natural plant-based sources of colours are:<ref name=\"keholi\"/><ref>[http://www.holifestival.org/holi-natural-colors.html Holi colors] Society for the Confluence of Festivals in India (2009)</ref><ref>[http://www.purcolour.com/faq/gulalholi-faq Celebration powders (Gulal/Holi)] Purcolor (2010)</ref>\n\n==== Orange and red ====\nThe flowers of [[Butea monosperma|palash]] or tesu tree, also called the flame of the forest, are typical source of bright red and deep orange colours. Powdered fragrant red [[sandalwood]], dried [[hibiscus]] flowers, [[Rubia|madder tree]], [[radish]], and [[pomegranate]] are alternate sources and shades of red. Mixing [[Calcium hydroxide|lime]] with [[turmeric]] powder creates an alternate source of orange powder, as does boiling [[saffron]] (kesar) in water.\n\n==== Green ====\n[[Mehndi|Mehendi]] and dried leaves of [[gulmohur]] tree offer a source of green colour. In some areas, the leaves of spring crops and herbs have been used as a source of green pigment.\n\n==== Yellow ====\n[[File:Holi shop.jpg|thumb|Colours for Holi on sale at a market in [[Mysore]]]]\n''Haldi'' (turmeric) powder is the typical source of yellow colour. Sometimes this is mixed with [[chickpea]] (gram) or other flour to get the right shade. [[Aegle marmelos|Bael]] fruit, [[amaltas]], species of [[chrysanthemum]]s, and species of [[Tagetes|marigold]] are alternate sources of yellow.\n\n==== Blue ====\n[[Indigofera|Indigo plant]], [[Indian Berry|Indian berries]], species of [[Vitis|grapes]], blue hibiscus, and [[jacaranda]] flowers are traditional sources of blue colour for Holi.\n\n==== Magenta and purple ====\n[[Beetroot]] is the traditional source of magenta and purple colour. Often these are directly boiled in water to prepare coloured water.\n\n==== Brown ====\nDried [[tea]] leaves offer a source of brown coloured water. Certain [[clay]]s are alternate source of brown.\n\n==== Black ====\nSpecies of grapes, fruits of [[Phyllanthus emblica|amla]] (gooseberry) and [[vegetable carbon]] (charcoal) offer gray to black colours.\n\n===Synthetic colours===\nNatural colours were used in the past to celebrate Holi safely by applying [[turmeric]], [[sandalwood]] paste, extracts of flowers and leaves. As the spring-blossoming trees that once supplied the colours used to celebrate Holi have become rarer, chemically produced industrial dyes have been used to take their place in almost all of urban India. Due to the commercial availability of attractive pigments, slowly the natural colours are replaced by synthetic colours. As a result, it has caused mild to severe symptoms of skin irritation and inflammation. Lack of control over the quality and content of these colours is a problem, as they are frequently sold by vendors who do not know their source.\n\n==Holi powder==\n\n=== Health Impact ===\nA 2007 study found that [[malachite green]], a synthetic bluish-green dye used in some colours during Holi festival, was responsible for severe eye irritation in Delhi, if eyes were not washed upon exposure. Though the study found that the pigment did not penetrate through the cornea, malachite green is of concern and needs further study.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.06.046| pmid=16904259|title = Ocular hazards of the colors used during the festival-of-colors (Holi) in India\u2014Malachite green toxicity| journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials| volume=139| issue=2| pages=204\u2013208|year = 2007|last1 = Velpandian|first1 = T.| last2=Saha| first2=K.| last3=Ravi| first3=A.K.| last4=Kumari| first4=S.S.| last5=Biswas| first5=N.R.| last6=Ghose| first6=S.}}</ref>\n\nAnother 2009 study reports that some colours produced and sold in India contain metal-based industrial dyes, causing an increase in skin problems to some people in the days following Holi. These colours are produced in India, particularly by small informal businesses, without any quality checks and are sold freely in the market. The colours are sold without labeling, and the consumer lacks information about the source of the colours, their contents, and possible toxic effects. In recent years, several nongovernmental organisations have started campaigning for safe practices related to the use of colours. Some are producing and marketing ranges of safer colours derived from natural sources such as vegetables and flowers.<ref>Ghosh, S. K., Bandyopadhyay, D., Chatterjee, G., & Saha, D.

Meanwhile, some commercial companies such as the National Botanical Research Institute have begun to market \"herbal\" dyes, though these are substantially more expensive than the dangerous alternatives. However, it may be noted that many parts of rural India have always resorted to natural colours (and other parts of festivities more than colours) due to availability.\n\nIn urban areas, some people wear nose mask and sunglasses to avoid inhaling pigments and to prevent chemical exposure to eyes.<ref>[http://www.taelon.co.uk/holi-festival/ Holi Festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503151005/http://www.taelon.co.uk/holi-festival/ |date=3 May 2015 }} What to wear?

The love god shoots arrows at Shiva, the yogi opens his third eye and burns Kama to ashes. This upsets both Kama's wife [[Rati]] (''Kamadevi'') and his own wife ''Parvati''. ''Rati'' performs her own meditative asceticism for forty days, upon which Shiva understands, forgives out of compassion and restores the god of love. This return of the god of love, is celebrated on the 40th day after Vasant Panchami festival as Holi.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robin Rinehart|title=Contemporary Hinduism: Ritual, Culture, and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hMPYnfS_R90C&pg=PA135 |year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-905-8|pages=135\u2013137}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Michelle Lee|title=Holi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K166DAAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Scobre|isbn=978-1-62920-572-4|pages=8\u201311}}</ref> The Kama legend and its significance to Holi has many variant forms, particularly in South India.<ref>{{cite book|author=Usha Sharma|title=Festivals In Indian Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6OYRUEAF7oC&pg=PA80 |year=2008|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-8324-113-7|pages=80\u201382}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural significance===\nThe Holi festival has a cultural significance among various Hindu traditions of the Indian subcontinent.

Ranjit Singh would celebrate Holi with others in the Bilawal gardens, where decorative tents were set up.

To many Hindus and some non-Hindus, it is a playful cultural event and an excuse to throw coloured water at friends or strangers in jest. It is also observed broadly in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Holi is celebrated at the end of winter, on the last [[full moon]] day of the Hindu luni-solar calendar month marking the spring, making the date vary with the lunar cycle.{{refn|group=note|name=holicalendars|Since ancient times, the Indian subcontinent has had several major [[Hindu calendar]]s, which places Holi and other festivals on different local months even though they mean the same date. Some Hindu calendars emphasise the solar cycle, some the lunar cycle. Further, the regional calendars feature two traditions of Amanta and Purnimanta systems, wherein the similar-sounding months refer to different parts of a lunar cycle, thus further diversifying the nomenclature. The Hindu festival of Holi falls on the first (full moon) day of ''Chaitra'' lunar month's dark fortnight in the Purnimanta system, while the same exact day for Holi is expressed in Amanta system as the lunar day of ''Phalguna Purnima''.<ref name=fuller292>{{cite book|author=Christopher John Fuller|title=The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=To6XSeBUW3oC|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-69112-04-85|pages=291\u2013293}}</ref> Both time measuring and dating systems are equivalent ways of meaning the same thing, they continue to be in use in different regions.<ref name=fuller292/><ref name=\"Reingold2008p275\">{{cite book|author1=Nachum Dershowitz|author2=Edward M.

On top of the pyre is an effigy to signify [[Holika]] who tricked Prahalad into the fire. Inside homes, people stock up on pigments, food, party drinks and festive seasonal foods such as ''[[gujiya]]'', ''[[mathri]]'', ''[[malpua]]s'' and other regional delicacies.\n\n==== Bonfire ====\nOn the eve of Holi, typically at or after sunset, the pyre is lit, signifying [[Holika Dahan]].

There is no tradition of holding ''puja'' (prayer), and the day is for partying and pure enjoyment. Children and young people form groups armed with dry colours, coloured solution and [[water guns]] (''pichkaris''), water balloons filled with coloured water, and other creative means to colour their targets.<ref name=htor/>\n\nTraditionally, washable natural plant-derived colours such as [[turmeric]], [[neem]], [[Butea monosperma|dhak]], and [[kumkum]] were used, but water-based commercial pigments are increasingly used. All colours are used. Everyone in open areas such as streets and parks is game, but inside homes or at doorways only dry powder is used to smear each other's face. People throw colours and get their targets completely coloured up. It is like a [[water fight]], but with coloured water. People take delight in spraying coloured water on each other. By late morning, everyone looks like a canvas of colours. This is why Holi is given the name \"Festival of Colours\".\n\nGroups sing and dance, some playing drums and ''[[dholak]]''. After each stop of fun and play with colours, people offer [[gujiya]], [[mathri]], [[malpua]]s and other traditional delicacies.<ref>[http://blog.zhdk.ch/idss/files/2013/07/final-presentation-Festival-Circle.pdf Holi Festival] Rex Li Indrajeet Deshmukh and Marielle Roth, Festival Circle, IDSS 2013</ref> Cold drinks, including drinks made with marijuana,<ref name=TOIBhang /> are also part of the Holi festivity.\n\n==== Other variations ====\nIn the [[Braj]] region around [[Mathura]], in north India, the festivities may last more than a week.

The customs and celebrations vary between regions of India.\n\nHoli is of particular significance in the Braj region, which includes locations traditionally associated with the [[Lord Krishna]]: [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], [[Vrindavan]], [[Nandgaon, Uttar Pradesh]], and [[Barsana]], which become touristic during the season of Holi.<ref name=ind/>\n\nOutside India and Nepal, Holi is observed by the minority Hindus in [[Bangladesh]] and [[Pakistan]] as well in countries with large Indian subcontinent [[diaspora]] populations such as [[Suriname]], [[Guyana]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[South Africa]], [[Malaysia]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Mauritius]], and [[Fiji]]. The Holi rituals and customs outside South Asia also vary with local adaptations.\n\n===India===\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2018}}\n\n====Assam====\nHoli, also called Phakuwa/Doul (\u09ab\u09be\u0995\u09c1\u09f1\u09be/\u09a6\u09cc\u09b2) in [[Assamese language|Assamese]], is celebrated all over [[Assam]]. Locally called Doul Jatra, associated with Satras of [[Barpeta]], Holi is celebrated over two days. On the first day, the burning of clay huts are seen in Barpeta and [[lower Assam]] which signifies the legends of Holika. On the second day of it, Holi is celebrated with colour powders. The Holi songs in chorus devoted to Lord Krishna are also sung in the regions of Barpeta.\n\n====Bihar/Jharkhand====\nHoli is known as ''Phaguwa'' in the local [[Bhojpuri]] dialect. In this region as well, the legend of Holika is prevalent. On the eve of Phalgun Poornima, people light bonfires. They put dried cow dung cakes, wood of the Araad or Redi tree and Holika tree, grains from the fresh harvest and unwanted wood leaves in the bonfire. At the time of Holika people assemble near the pyre. The eldest member of the gathering or a [[purohit]] initiates the lighting. He then smears others with colour as a mark of greeting. Next day the festival is celebrated with colours and a lot of frolic. Traditionally, people also clean their houses to mark the festival.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nHoli Milan is also observed in [[Bihar]], where family members and well-wishers visit each other's family, apply colours ([[abir|abeer]]) on each other's faces, and on feet, if elderly. Usually this takes place on the evening of Holi day after Holi with wet colours is played in the morning through the afternoon. Due to large-scale internal migration issues faced by the people, recently this tradition has slowly begun to transform, and it is common to have Holi Milan on an entirely different day either before or after the actual day of Holi.<ref>{{cite web |title=Holi Milan |url=http://www.indiacitytrip.com/festivals/Destinations-to-enjoy-Festivals-of-India/Holi/east-india.html |website=indiacitytrip.com}}</ref>\n\nChildren and youths take extreme delight in the festival. Though the festival is usually celebrated with colours, in some places people also enjoy celebrating Holi with water solutions of mud or clay. Folk songs are sung at high pitch and people dance to the sound of the [[dholak]] (a two-headed hand-drum) and the spirit of Holi. Intoxicating [[bhang]], made from [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], milk and spices, is consumed with a variety of mouth-watering delicacies, such as [[pakora]]s and [[thandai]], to enhance the mood of the festival.<ref name=HuffPostBhang>{{cite web|title=Holi 2014: Festival Of Colors Celebrates Spring (Songs, Photos)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/16/holi-2014_n_4965026.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Goa====\n{{Main|Shigmo}}\nHoli is locally called Ukkuli in [[Konkani language|Konkani]].

On the evening of the first day people light the bonfire. People offer raw coconut and corn to the fire. The second day is the festival of colour or \"Dhuleti\", celebrated by sprinkling coloured water and applying colours to each other. [[Dwarka]], a coastal city of Gujarat, celebrates Holi at the [[Dwarkadheesh temple]] and with citywide comedy and music festivities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pndwarka.com/news.html|title=You are being redirected...|website=pndwarka.com}}</ref> Falling in the Hindu month of ''Phalguna'', Holi marks the agricultural season of the [[rabi crop]].\n\nIn [[Ahmedabad]] in [[Gujarat]], in western India, a pot of buttermilk is hung high over the streets and young boys try to reach it and break it by making human pyramids. The girls try to stop them by throwing coloured water on them to commemorate the pranks of Krishna and the cowherd boys to steal butter and \"[[gopi]]s\" while trying to stop the girls. The boy who finally manages to break the pot is crowned the Holi King. Afterwards, the men, who are now very colourful, go out in a large procession to \"alert\" people of Krishna's possible appearance to steal butter from their homes.\n\nIn some places, there is a custom in undivided Hindu families that the woman beats her brother-in-law with a sari rolled up into a rope in a mock rage and tries to drench him with colours, and in turn, the brother-in-law brings sweets (Indian desserts) to her in the evening.<ref>[http://topnews.in/law/files/Holi_3_0.jpg topnews.in], Holi in Gujarat</ref>\n\n====Jammu and Kashmir====\nIn [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]], Holi celebrations are much in line with the general definition of Holi celebrations: a high-spirited festival to mark the beginning of the harvesting of the summer crop, with the throwing of coloured water and powder and singing and dancing.<ref>{{cite web |title=Holi celebration in Jammu and Kashmir |url=https://www.holifestival.org/holi-in-jammu-and-kashmir.html |website=holifestival.org}}</ref>\n\n====Karnataka====\nTraditionally, in rural [[Karnataka]] children collect money and wood in the weeks prior to Holi, and on \"Kamadahana\" night all the wood is put together and lit. The festival is celebrated for two days. People in northern parts of Karnataka prepare special food on this day.\n\nIn [[Sirsi, Karnataka|Sirsi]], Karnataka, Holi is celebrated with a unique folk dance called \"Bedara Vesha\", which is performed during the nights beginning five days before the actual festival day. The festival is celebrated every alternate year in the town, which attracts a large number of tourists from different parts of India.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/03/10/stories/2009031050660300.htm |title=Karnataka |newspaper=The Hindu |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Maharashtra====\nIn [[Maharashtra]], Holi Purnima is also celebrated as Shimga, festivities that last five to seven days. A week before the festival, youngsters go around the community, collecting firewood and money. On the day of Shimga, the firewood is heaped into a huge pile in each neighborhood. In the evening, the fire is lit. Every household brings a meal and dessert, in the honour of the fire god. Puran Poli is the main delicacy and children shout \"Holi re Holi puranachi poli\". Shimga celebrates the elimination of all evil. The colour celebrations here take place on the day of [[Rang Panchami]], five days after Shimga. During this festival, people are supposed to forget and forgive any rivalries and start new healthy relations with all.\n\n====Manipur====\n[[Meitei people|Manipuris]] celebrate Holi for 6 days. Here, this holiday merges with the festival of [[Yaosang]]. Traditionally, the festival commences with the burning of a thatched hut of hay and twigs. Young children go from house to house to collect money, locally known as ''nakadeng'' (or ''nakatheng''), as gifts on the first two days. The youths at night perform a group folk dance called [[Thabal chongba]] on the full moon night of Lamta ([[Phalgun]]), traditionally accompanied by folk songs and rhythmic beats of the indigenous drum, but nowadays by modern bands and [[fluorescent lamp]]s. In Krishna temples, devotees sing devotional songs, perform dances and celebrate with ''aber'' (''gulal'') wearing traditional white and yellow turbans. On the last day of the festival, large processions are taken out to the main Krishna temple near [[Imphal]] where several cultural activities are held. In recent decades, [[Yaosang]], a type of Indian sport, has become common in many places of the valley, where people of all ages come out to participate in a number of sports that are somewhat altered for the holiday.\n\n====Odisha====\n[[File:Elevation of the black stone arch.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An 1822 drawing showing elevation of a black stone arch in [[Puri]], Odisha.

On the last day, a grand fair called ''Ganga Mela'' or the ''Holi Mela'' is celebrated. This ''Mela'' ([[fair]]) was started by freedom fighters who fought British rule in the [[First Indian War of Independence]] in 1857 under the leadership of [[Nana Saheb]]. The ''Mela'' is held at various [[ghats]] along the banks of the River [[Ganges|Ganga]] in Kanpur, to celebrate the Hindus and Muslims who together resisted the [[United Kingdom|British]] forces in the city in 1857.

This day, called \"Holi Milan\", is considered to be the most colourful day of the year, promoting brotherhood among the people.  People visit every house and sing Holi songs and express their gratitude by applying coloured powder ([[Abir|Abeer]]).

It takes different forms such as the Baithki Holi, the Khari Holi and the Mahila Holi. In Baithki Holi and Khari Holi, people sing songs with a touch of melody, fun, and spiritualism. These songs are essentially based on classical [[raga]]s. Baithki Holi (\u092c\u0948\u0920\u0915\u0940 \u0939\u094b\u0932\u0940), also known as ''Nirvan Ki Holi'', begins from the premises of temples, where ''Holiyars'' (\u0939\u094b\u0932\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0930) sing Holi songs and people gather to participate, along with playing classical music. The songs are sung in a particular sequence depending on the time of day; for instance, at noon the songs are based on Peelu, Bhimpalasi and Sarang ragas, while evening songs are based on the ragas such as Kalyan, Shyamkalyan and Yaman. The '''Khari Holi''' (\u0916\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u0939\u094b\u0932\u0940) is mostly celebrated in the rural areas of Kumaon. The songs of the Khari Holi are sung by the people, who, sporting traditional white ''[[churidar ]]payajama'' and ''[[kurta]]'', dance in groups to the tune of ethnic musical instruments such as the ''[[dhol]]'' and ''[[hurka]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=kumaoni Holi Uttrakhand |url=https://www.euttarakhand.com/kumaon-ki-holi |website=euttarakhand.com|date=4 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn the Kumaon region, the Holika pyre, known as ''Cheer'' (\u091a\u0940\u0930), is ceremonially built in a ceremony known as ''Cheer Bandhan'' (\u091a\u0940\u0930 \u092c\u0902\u0927\u0928) fifteen days before Dulhendi. The ''Cheer'' is a bonfire with a green ''Paiya'' tree branch in the middle.

The festival is celebrated in a dignified manner by placing the icons of Krishna and [[Radha]] on a picturesquely decorated [[palanquin]] which is then taken round the main streets of the city or the village. On the [[Dol Purnima]] day in the early morning, students dress up in saffron-coloured or pure white clothes and wear garlands of fragrant [[flowers]]. They sing and dance to the accompaniment of musical instruments, such as the [[ektara]], [[dubri]], and [[Veena]]. The devotees take turns to swing them while women dance around the swing and sing devotional songs. During these activities, the men keep spraying coloured water and coloured powder, [[abir]], at them.\n\n===Nepal===\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nHolika Dahan, Kathamandu, Nepal.jpg|Preparing for Holika Dahan, Kathamandu, [[Nepal]].\nHoli in Nepal 2016.JPG|Locals celebrating Holi in [[Kathmandu]], Nepal.\nTwo women celebrating Holi.jpg|Two women celebrating Holi in Kathmandu, Nepal.\n</gallery>\nHoli, along with many other Hindu festivals, is celebrated in Nepal as a national festival.

The playful throwing of natural coloured powders, called [[gulal]] has a medicinal significance: the colours are traditionally made of [[neem]], [[kumkum]], [[Turmeric|haldi]], [[bilva]], and other medicinal herbs prescribed by [[Ayurveda|\u0100yurvedic]] doctors.\n\nMany colours are obtained by mixing primary colours. Artisans produce and sell many of the colours from natural sources in dry powder form, in weeks and months preceding Holi. Some of the traditional natural plant-based sources of colours are:<ref name=\"keholi\"/><ref>[http://www.holifestival.org/holi-natural-colors.html Holi colors] Society for the Confluence of Festivals in India (2009)</ref><ref>[http://www.purcolour.com/faq/gulalholi-faq Celebration powders (Gulal/Holi)] Purcolor (2010)</ref>\n\n==== Orange and red ====\nThe flowers of [[Butea monosperma|palash]] or tesu tree, also called the flame of the forest, are typical source of bright red and deep orange colours. Powdered fragrant red [[sandalwood]], dried [[hibiscus]] flowers, [[Rubia|madder tree]], [[radish]], and [[pomegranate]] are alternate sources and shades of red. Mixing [[Calcium hydroxide|lime]] with [[turmeric]] powder creates an alternate source of orange powder, as does boiling [[saffron]] (kesar) in water.\n\n==== Green ====\n[[Mehndi|Mehendi]] and dried leaves of [[gulmohur]] tree offer a source of green colour. In some areas, the leaves of spring crops and herbs have been used as a source of green pigment.\n\n==== Yellow ====\n[[File:Holi shop.jpg|thumb|Colours for Holi on sale at a market in [[Mysore]]]]\n''Haldi'' (turmeric) powder is the typical source of yellow colour. Sometimes this is mixed with [[chickpea]] (gram) or other flour to get the right shade. [[Aegle marmelos|Bael]] fruit, [[amaltas]], species of [[chrysanthemum]]s, and species of [[Tagetes|marigold]] are alternate sources of yellow.\n\n==== Blue ====\n[[Indigofera|Indigo plant]], [[Indian Berry|Indian berries]], species of [[Vitis|grapes]], blue hibiscus, and [[jacaranda]] flowers are traditional sources of blue colour for Holi.\n\n==== Magenta and purple ====\n[[Beetroot]] is the traditional source of magenta and purple colour. Often these are directly boiled in water to prepare coloured water.\n\n==== Brown ====\nDried [[tea]] leaves offer a source of brown coloured water. Certain [[clay]]s are alternate source of brown.\n\n==== Black ====\nSpecies of grapes, fruits of [[Phyllanthus emblica|amla]] (gooseberry) and [[vegetable carbon]] (charcoal) offer gray to black colours.\n\n===Synthetic colours===\nNatural colours were used in the past to celebrate Holi safely by applying [[turmeric]], [[sandalwood]] paste, extracts of flowers and leaves. As the spring-blossoming trees that once supplied the colours used to celebrate Holi have become rarer, chemically produced industrial dyes have been used to take their place in almost all of urban India. Due to the commercial availability of attractive pigments, slowly the natural colours are replaced by synthetic colours. As a result, it has caused mild to severe symptoms of skin irritation and inflammation. Lack of control over the quality and content of these colours is a problem, as they are frequently sold by vendors who do not know their source.\n\n==Holi powder==\n\n=== Health Impact ===\nA 2007 study found that [[malachite green]], a synthetic bluish-green dye used in some colours during Holi festival, was responsible for severe eye irritation in Delhi, if eyes were not washed upon exposure. Though the study found that the pigment did not penetrate through the cornea, malachite green is of concern and needs further study.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.06.046| pmid=16904259|title = Ocular hazards of the colors used during the festival-of-colors (Holi) in India\u2014Malachite green toxicity| journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials| volume=139| issue=2| pages=204\u2013208|year = 2007|last1 = Velpandian|first1 = T.| last2=Saha| first2=K.| last3=Ravi| first3=A.K.| last4=Kumari| first4=S.S.| last5=Biswas| first5=N.R.| last6=Ghose| first6=S.}}</ref>\n\nAnother 2009 study reports that some colours produced and sold in India contain metal-based industrial dyes, causing an increase in skin problems to some people in the days following Holi. These colours are produced in India, particularly by small informal businesses, without any quality checks and are sold freely in the market. The colours are sold without labeling, and the consumer lacks information about the source of the colours, their contents, and possible toxic effects. In recent years, several nongovernmental organisations have started campaigning for safe practices related to the use of colours. Some are producing and marketing ranges of safer colours derived from natural sources such as vegetables and flowers.<ref>Ghosh, S. K., Bandyopadhyay, D., Chatterjee, G., & Saha, D.

Meanwhile, some commercial companies such as the National Botanical Research Institute have begun to market \"herbal\" dyes, though these are substantially more expensive than the dangerous alternatives.
