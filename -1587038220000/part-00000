It depicts an expedition to the [[Amazon River]] to capture animals for their father's wildlife collection business.   Initially published by John Day in the US, the UK edition was published two years later by Jonathan Cape.\n\n==Allies==\n* '''Terry'''- The smiling Irish pilot who flies the Hunts from [[Quito]] to the [[J\u00edvaro]] village. Terry's plane is in terrible condition, and the flight almost ends in disaster on several occasions. Hal decides that ''\"Lady Luck must love this man!\"''\n* '''Chief'''- The Chief of the J\u00edvaro village is friendly towards the Hunts, and is eventually persuaded to sell them the mummified head of a warrior, for which John Hunt pays double the requested price. The Chief also organises for Napo to accompany the trio down the uncharted [[Pastaza River]].\n* '''Napo''' - The Jivaro warrior who accompanies Hal, Roger and John Hunt down the first segment of the [[Pastaza River]]. The waterfall at which he turns back is consequently dubbed Napo Falls.\n* '''Aqua''' - A young Indian whom Hal employed at [[Iquitos]], who is always willing to do more than he was asked to do. He was killed by the [[anaconda]] while bravely helping to capture it, and was buried at the foot of the tree where he gave his life.\n\n==Enemies==\n* '''\"Shark\" Sands'''- An unseen character, Sands is a rival animal collector. His nickname, \"Shark,\" was given because he used to do some sharking in the South Seas. Reputedly, he narrowly escaped a murder charge in the [[Philippines]], and has recently purchased the second-largest animal collection business, behind John Hunt's. Having little knowledge of wildlife, Hal suspects that Sands is using foul means to achieve success. It is believed that Sands started the fire that destroyed the Hunt property on Long Island, destroying his entire animal collection, forcing John Hunt to return home. Hal also suspects that Sands hired the man named Croc to sabotage their expedition. What ultimately happened to him is unknown.\n* '''Croc'''- Hal suspects that \"Croc\" was hired by the rival animal collector \"Shark\" Sands to sabotage their expedition. Hal nicknames him Croc because his teeth are ''\"snaggled and discoloured like a crocodile's.\"'' Hal first notices Croc following him in [[Quito]], and again sees him at [[Iquitos]]. When Croc's hired thugs are beheaded by Cocamas Indians, Hal decides to help him, and Croc steals their boat and deserts them, leaving them to die beside the Amazon River. By boarding a floating island of land, Hal and Roger eventually catch up with Croc, overpower him and lock him in the [[anaconda]] cage. On their arrival in Manaos, the police arrest Croc for [[robbery]] and incendiarism, and for the murder of twelve Indians.\n* '''Banco'''- A 'caboclo,' or a mixture of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], Banco is hired by Hal at [[Iquitos]] to help with capturing animals. A stubborn coward, Banco often does not do what he is told, and his foolish actions botch an attempt to capture a [[jaguar]], resulting in the magnificent animal's death. Shortly after the brave Indian Aqua is killed by an [[anaconda]], Banco convinces the other Indians to flee during the night with one of the boats.\n\n==Reception==\nDorothy Hinman, reviewing the book for ''Elementary English'' in February 1950, wrote:<blockquote>The authentic experiences presented by Willard Price in this account of a trip through the Amazon jungle in themselves would offer to an adult sufficient excitement.

The Narts were the central figures of the [[folklore]] of peoples of the North Caucasus.\n\n==Myth==\nBatraz (''\u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0437'', or ''\u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0437'') in the Ossetian [[Nart saga]]s is son of Khami(t)s (''\u0425\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0446\u0430'').{{sfn|\u041c\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1990|loc=\u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0437, \u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0437}} Khamis was married to a [[Nereid|sea-nymph]] or water-sprite, in Ossetian variants a daughter (named sometimes as Bisenon of the Bisenta clan) of the Ossetian sea-god [[Donbettyr]] and in Circassian versions the frog-like Lady Isp. Whilst at a meeting of the Narts (see [[:ru:\u041d\u044b\u0445\u0430\u0441]]) the Nart [[Syrdon]] (see [[:ru:\u0421\u044b\u0440\u0434\u043e\u043d]]) ridiculed Khamis's wife, who had taken the form of a frog which he put in his pocket. As a result, Khamis's wife left, but before going she breathed (spat?) the embryo of her son upon her husband's back, creating a type of womb-like cyst from which Batraz is later delivered, glowing hot.{{sfn|\u041c\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1990|loc=\u0425\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0446}}{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=135}}\n\nAfter being born from his father's back, still on fire, Syrdon throws Batraz into the sea, where he dwells during his childhood.{{sfn|\u041c\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1990|loc=\u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0437, \u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0437}} Batraz gained his powers by visiting the god-blacksmith [[Kurdal\u00e6gon]] (''\u041a\u0443\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0443'') \u2013 the smith heats Batraz to white heat, then using tongs, throws him into the sea. From then on Batraz's great feats begin \u2013 he lives in the sky and is able to summon lightning bolts to aid the Narts.{{sfn|\u041c\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1990|loc=\u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0437, \u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0437}} In one variant Batraz demands a huge amount of charcoal from the Narts, then with two dozen bellows the charcoal is heated, and Batraz is heated to white hot, he then jumps into the sea, and next kills many Narts.{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|pp=63-4}} In a variant of this mythic motif Batraz becomes so hot - in order to avenge his father's death at the hands of certain other Narts - that he plunges, burning, through successive floors of a tower into a cauldron placed beneath it by Syrdon, and then goes on to kill the guilty Narts in revenge.{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=60}}\n\nHis feats include wreaking vengeance on a 'crooked giant' (''\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430'') in retribution for violence against the young people of the Narts; and also upon Sainag-Aldar (\"the owner of the black mountain\", see [[:ru:\u0421\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0430\u0433-\u0410\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0440]]), the killer of his father Xamyc.{{sfn|\u041c\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1990|loc=\u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0437, \u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0437}}\n\nBatraz also appears in tales in which the Narts compete for a prize by boasting \u2013 often he is the winner in the boasting games.{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=187}}\n\nUltimately it is vengeance for his father that leads to his death - his father had a magic tooth than when shown allowed him to sleep with any woman of the Narts - his (mis-)use of this led to Xamyc being killed in an ambush by other Narts who sought revenge for this. However Batraz takes revenge, and he starts killing and persecuting other Narts in cruel ways, then he begins to blame the heavenly spirits for his father's death. Eventually god has to intervene and put Batraz to death.{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=169, 185}}\n\n===Batraz's sword===\nOne aspect of Batraz's aspect is his representation of iron. Often is the tales his physical presence itself is used as a weapon, such as him smashing through the walls of a fortress. The tales where his hot self is plunged into water have been taken as a reference to the [[quenching]] of steel to make it harder.{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=62}}\n\nIn other aspects of his myth it is his sword that creates lightning, produced when it is swung to dispel evil spirits. In one version of the legend Batraz could only die when his sword was thrown into the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=62}}\n\n===Ossetian aspects===\nMost of the stories of Batraz were collected in Ossetia.{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=58}}\n\nAccording to legend the three main sanctuaries (shrines) of Ossetia - \u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c (Rekom), \u0422\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0436\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0437 (Tarandzhelos) and \u041c\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0431\u044b\u0440\u0442\u0430 (Mikalgabirta) - were formed by the three tears wept by God upon the death of Batraz.{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=21}}\n\nAdditionally the Ossetians associated Batraz's name with thunderstorms in some local folklore.{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=58}} However, since Christianization, as a storm god he contends with the Christian figures of 'St. Wacilla' (see ''[[:ru:\u0423\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0430]]'').{{sfn|\u041c\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1990|loc=\u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0437, \u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0437}}{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=58}}\n\n==Etymology==\nRussian linguist and historian [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]] proposed that the name Batraz was borrowed into [[Ossetic]] via a [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] source, as the phonology is impossible for a native Ossetic name.

The Narts were the central figures of the [[folklore]] of peoples of the North Caucasus.\n\n==Myth==\nBatraz (''\u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0437'', or ''\u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0437'') in the Ossetian [[Nart saga]]s is son of Khami(t)s (''\u0425\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0446\u0430'').{{sfn|\u041c\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1990|loc=\u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0437, \u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0437}} Khamis was married to a [[Nereid|sea-nymph]] or water-sprite, in Ossetian variants a daughter (named sometimes as Bisenon of the Bisenta clan) of the Ossetian sea-god [[Donbettyr]] and in Circassian versions the frog-like Lady Isp. Whilst at a meeting of the Narts (see [[:ru:\u041d\u044b\u0445\u0430\u0441]]) the Nart [[Syrdon]] (see [[:ru:\u0421\u044b\u0440\u0434\u043e\u043d]]) ridiculed Khamis's wife, who had taken the form of a frog which he put in his pocket. As a result, Khamis's wife left, but before going she breathed (spat?) the embryo of her son upon her husband's back, creating a type of womb-like cyst from which Batraz is later delivered, glowing hot.{{sfn|\u041c\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1990|loc=\u0425\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0446}}{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=135}}\n\nAfter being born from his father's back, still on fire, Syrdon throws Batraz into the sea, where he dwells during his childhood.{{sfn|\u041c\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1990|loc=\u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0437, \u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0437}} Batraz gained his powers by visiting the god-blacksmith [[Kurdal\u00e6gon]] (''\u041a\u0443\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0443'') \u2013 the smith heats Batraz to white heat, then using tongs, throws him into the sea. From then on Batraz's great feats begin \u2013 he lives in the sky and is able to summon lightning bolts to aid the Narts.{{sfn|\u041c\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1990|loc=\u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0437, \u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0437}} In one variant Batraz demands a huge amount of charcoal from the Narts, then with two dozen bellows the charcoal is heated, and Batraz is heated to white hot, he then jumps into the sea, and next kills many Narts.{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|pp=63-4}} In a variant of this mythic motif Batraz becomes so hot - in order to avenge his father's death at the hands of certain other Narts - that he plunges, burning, through successive floors of a tower into a cauldron placed beneath it by Syrdon, and then goes on to kill the guilty Narts in revenge.{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=60}}\n\nHis feats include wreaking vengeance on a 'crooked giant' (''\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430'') in retribution for violence against the young people of the Narts; and also upon Sainag-Aldar (\"the owner of the black mountain\", see [[:ru:\u0421\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0430\u0433-\u0410\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0440]]), the killer of his father Xamyc.{{sfn|\u041c\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1990|loc=\u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0437, \u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0437}}\n\nBatraz also appears in tales in which the Narts compete for a prize by boasting \u2013 often he is the winner in the boasting games.{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=187}}\n\nUltimately it is vengeance for his father that leads to his death - his father had a magic tooth than when shown allowed him to sleep with any woman of the Narts - his (mis-)use of this led to Xamyc being killed in an ambush by other Narts who sought revenge for this. However Batraz takes revenge, and he starts killing and persecuting other Narts in cruel ways, then he begins to blame the heavenly spirits for his father's death. Eventually god has to intervene and put Batraz to death.{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=169, 185}}\n\n===Batraz's sword===\nOne aspect of Batraz's aspect is his representation of iron. Often is the tales his physical presence itself is used as a weapon, such as him smashing through the walls of a fortress. The tales where his hot self is plunged into water have been taken as a reference to the [[quenching]] of steel to make it harder.{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=62}}\n\nIn other aspects of his myth it is his sword that creates lightning, produced when it is swung to dispel evil spirits. In one version of the legend Batraz could only die when his sword was thrown into the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=62}}\n\n===Ossetian aspects===\nMost of the stories of Batraz were collected in Ossetia.{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=58}}\n\nAccording to legend the three main sanctuaries (shrines) of Ossetia - \u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c (Rekom), \u0422\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0436\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0437 (Tarandzhelos) and \u041c\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0431\u044b\u0440\u0442\u0430 (Mikalgabirta) - were formed by the three tears wept by God upon the death of Batraz.{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=21}}\n\nAdditionally the Ossetians associated Batraz's name with thunderstorms in some local folklore.{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=58}} However, since Christianization, as a storm god he contends with the Christian figures of 'St. Wacilla' (see ''[[:ru:\u0423\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0430]]'').{{sfn|\u041c\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1990|loc=\u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0437, \u0411\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0437}}{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1976|p=58}}\n\n==Etymology==\nRussian linguist and historian [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]] proposed that the name Batraz was borrowed into [[Ossetic]] via a [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] source, as the phonology is impossible for a native Ossetic name. Trubetsky proposed that the name was borrowed by the Kabardians from an earlier, non-Ossetic, Iranian people who once lived in the region, and reconstructs the [[Old Iranian]] form as ''*Pitari-za'', meaning \"given birth to by the father\" (a reference to the legend of Battaz's birth, in which he was born from a hump on his father Xamyc's back).<ref>{{citation| last = Trubetzkoy | first = N.

''Opera News'' was initially focused primarily on the Met, particularly providing information for listeners of the Saturday afternoon live [[Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts]]. Over the years, the magazine has broadened its scope to include the larger American and international opera scenes. Currently published monthly, ''Opera News'' offers opera related feature articles; artist interviews; production profiles; musicological pieces; music-business reportage; reviews of performances in the United States and Europe; reviews of recordings, videos, books and audio equipment; and listings of opera performances in the U.S.\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief is currently F.

It was initially intended to be a \"useful, instructive, and factual weekly newspaper of Opera in New York\".{{Cite quote|date=July 2018}} Its first issue was published on 7 December 1936 and consisted of only one folded broadsheet. Its second year of publication saw its transformation into a 17-page magazine with advertising, with its first magazine issue appearing on 15 November 1937. Beginning with the December 1940 issue, the magazine began to concentrate much of its content on the weekly [[Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts]]. The magazine at this point offered bi-weekly issues of an expanded size during the Fall, Winter, and Spring, but was on hiatus during the summers. As time went on, the magazine began to take on a more international scope of coverage; but it still maintained a strong interest in the New York opera scene and the Met in particular.\n\nIn the Fall of 1957 Frank Merkling succeeded Peltz as the second chief editor of ''Opera News'', with his first issue appearing on 14 October 1957. In 1972 the magazine became a year-round publication, adding monthly issues in the summer months while maintaining its bi-weekly schedule during the opera season. In 1974 Robert Jacobson became the magazine's third chief editor. Jacobson was succeeded by Patrick O'Connor (1988), who was succeeded in 1989 by Patrick J. Smith. In 1998, Smith was succeeded by Rudolph S. Rauch. Under the leadership of Rauch and executive editor [[Brian Kellow]], the magazine switched to a monthly publication format in September 1998. F. Paul Driscoll, the current editor in chief, was appointed in July 2003.\n\nBeginning with the June 2012 issue, the Metropolitan Opera said that ''Opera News'' would cease reviewing Met performances, following dissatisfaction among the Met leadership with the magazine's recent critiques of [[Robert Lepage]]'s production of the [[Ring Cycle]] and of the company's direction under [[Peter Gelb]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Daniel J. |last=Wakin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/22/arts/music/opera-news-will-stop-reviewing-metropolitan-opera.html |date=May 21, 2012 |title=Latest Met Aria: Bad Opera News Is No News |work=The New York Times}}</ref> However, reactions from the public led to the decision being reversed.<ref>{{Cite news |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-met-opera-news-review-20120522,0,2040627.story |first=Chris |last=Barton |date=May 22, 2012 |title=The Met reverses policy, will allow ''Opera News'' to review productions}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |work= [[National Public Radio]]|url= http://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/online-debate-operatic-intensity-met-and-its-critics|first= |last=Boise State Public Radio |date=May 24, 2012 |title=An Online Debate Of Operatic Intensity: The Met And Its Critics}}</ref>\n\n==''Opera News'' Awards==\nSince 2005 the magazine has annually bestowed five ''Opera News'' Awards for Distinguished Achievement.\n\nPast recipients of the awards have included:\n*1st \u2013 2005: [[James Conlon]], [[R\u00e9gine Crespin]], [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]], [[Susan Graham]], [[Dolora Zajick]]\n*2nd \u2013 2006: [[Ben Heppner]], [[James Levine]], [[Ren\u00e9 Pape]], [[Renata Scotto]], [[Deborah Voigt]]\n*3rd \u2013 2007: [[Stephanie Blythe]], [[Olga Borodina]], [[Thomas Hampson]], [[Leontyne Price]], [[Julius Rudel]]\n*4th \u2013 2008: [[John Adams (composer)]], [[Natalie Dessay]], [[Ren\u00e9e Fleming]], [[Marilyn Horne]], [[Sherrill Milnes]]\n*5th \u2013 2009: [[Martina Arroyo]], [[Joyce DiDonato]], [[Shirley Verrett]], [[Gerald Finley]], [[Philip Glass]]\n*6th \u2013 2010: [[Jonas Kaufmann]], [[Riccardo Muti]], [[Patricia Racette]], [[Kiri Te Kanawa]], [[Bryn Terfel]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Sixth Annual ''Opera News'' Awards to Honor Jonas Kaufmann, Riccardo Muti, Patricia Racette, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa & Bryn Terfel|url=http://www.operanews.com/operanews/templates/content.aspx?id=16734|work=Opera News|accessdate=8 February 2012|date=August 4, 2010}}</ref>\n*7th \u2013 2011: [[Karita Mattila]], [[Anja Silja]], [[Dmitri Hvorostovsky]], [[Peter Mattei]], [[Peter Sellars]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 ''Opera News'' Awards to Honor Karita Mattila, Anja Silja, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Peter Mattei and Peter Sellars|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2011/8/News/2011_Opera_News_Awards_Honorees_Announced.html|work=Opera News|accessdate=8 February 2012|date=August 11, 2011}}</ref>\n*8th \u2013 2012: [[David Daniels (countertenor)|David Daniels]], [[Simon Keenlyside]], [[Eric Owens (bass-baritone)|Eric Owens]], [[Mirella Freni]], [[Dawn Upshaw]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2012 ''Opera News'' Awards Honorees Announced|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2012/8/News/2012_Opera_News_Awards.html|work=Opera News|accessdate=2 May 2014|date=August 7, 2012}}</ref>\n*9th \u2013 2013: [[Patrice Ch\u00e9reau]], [[Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez]], [[Christa Ludwig]], [[James Morris (bass-baritone)|James Morris]], [[Nina Stemme]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Patrice Ch\u00e9reau, Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez, Christa Ludwig, James Morris and Nina Stemme to be Honored at the Ninth Annual ''Opera News'' Awards|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2013/9/News/ON_Awards.html|work=Opera News|accessdate=2 May 2014|date=September 10, 2013}}</ref>\n*10th \u2013 2014: [[Piotr Becza\u0142a]], [[Ferruccio Furlanetto]], [[Sondra Radvanovsky]], [[Samuel Ramey]], [[Teresa Stratas]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Tenth Annual ''Opera News'' Awards to Honor Piotr Beczala, Ferruccio Furlanetto, Sondra Radvanovsky, Samuel Ramey and Teresa Stratas|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2014/12/News/2015_Opera_News_Awards.html|work=Opera News|accessdate=4 May 2015|date=December 9, 2014}}</ref>\n*11th \u2013 2015: [[Joseph Calleja]], [[El\u012bna Garan\u010da]], [[Waltraud Meier]], [[Anna Netrebko]], [[Jos\u00e9 van Dam]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Joseph Calleja, El\u012bna Garan\u010da, Waltraud Meier, Anna Netrebko & Jos\u00e9 van Dam Named as 2016 ''Opera News'' Awards Recipients|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2015/12/News/Opera_News_Awards_Honorees.html|work=Opera News|accessdate=6 July 2016|date=December 10, 2015}}</ref>\n*12th \u2013 2016: [[Robert Carsen]], [[Christine Goerke]], [[Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin]], [[Matthew Polenzani]], [[Frederica von Stade]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwopera/article/12th-Annual-Opera-News-Awards-Are-Announced-20161031 | title=12th Annual ''Opera News'' Awards Are Announced!
