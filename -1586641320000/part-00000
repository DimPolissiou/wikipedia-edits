Its 60,000+ residents are considered to be \"highly diverse\" ethnically. Before the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the district was part of a [[Ranchos of California|rancho]], and after the American victory it was converted into wheat farms and then subdivided, with part of it named '''Owensmouth''' as a town founded in 1912. It joined Los Angeles in 1917 and was renamed Canoga Park on March 1, 1931, thanks to the efforts of local civic leader Mary Logan Orcutt.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-American history===\nThe area of present-day Canoga Park was the homeland of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the [[Tongva people|Tongva-Fernande\u00f1o]] and [[Chumash people|Chumash-Ventura\u00f1o]] tribes, that lived in the Simi Hills and along to the tributaries of the [[Los Angeles River]]. They traded with the north Valley [[Tataviam people|Tataviam-Fernande\u00f1o]] people. [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] civilizations inhabited the Valley for an estimated 8,000 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/2006-03-03-prehistoric-mill_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Prehistoric milling site found in California|website=www.usatoday.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/local/states/california/northern_california/14007712.htm|title=Mercury News article|publisher=}}</ref> Their culture left the [[Burro Flats Painted Cave]] nearby.<ref>[http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/980/files/sspshp%20ethnohistory.pdf] SSPSHP link: pp.41\u20132</ref>\n\nFrom 1797 to 1846, the area was part of [[Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a]] (Mission San Fernando).

The purchasers of the land included [[Harry Chandler]] and [[Harrison Gray Otis (publisher)|Harrison Gray Otis]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[Moses Sherman]] (a [[Los Angeles Pacific Railroad]] streetcar line builder), and [[Hobart Johnstone Whitley]], an all purpose real estate developer who, from a start in the [[Land Rush of 1889]] in Oklahoma to platting out 140 towns, including [[Hollywood]].\n\n[[File:1920_Sherman_Way_in_downtown_Owensmouth.jpg|thumb|right| 1920 Sherman Way in downtown Owensmouth, with Los Angeles Pacific Railroad lines]]\n\nThe area was originally named ''[[Owensmouth]]'' by Los Angeles Suburban Home Company by general manager [[Hobart Johnstone Whitley]] as a sales tactic in that the town would be the new mouth of the Owens River, after the [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]] would be completed the next year. The town was founded on March 30, 1912, and the Suburban Home Company contracted with the [[Janss Investment Company]], to sell properties. A pre-development scheme brought [[Pacific Electric]] streetcars and an all purpose highway (Sherman Way) out all the way from Hollywood through [[Cahuenga Pass]], through the previously subdivided [[Van Nuys]] (1911). Highlighting the \"opening day barbecue\" was the display of the \"Owensmouth Baby\", a racecar that could go up and down the paved Sherman Way at the incredible speed of 35&nbsp;mph.\n\nOwensmouth, as the junior San Fernando Valley city to Van Nuys, promoted itself with the \"baby\" motif\u2014using storks in their advertisement. The \"baby city\" of the Valley remained a very small community.\n\nThe lack of an independent water supply made annexation to the City of Los Angeles inevitable, and on February 26, 1917, it joined with its larger neighbor. The name was changed to ''Canoga Park'' in 1931, thanks to the efforts of local civic leader Mary Logan Orcutt.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-05-06-me-56015-story.html|title=She Helped Canoga Park Make a Name|last=Stassel|first=Stephanie|date=1997-05-06|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-27}}</ref> Eventually, the area's zoning was rural/agricultural and its industry was small farms involved in the production of fruits, vegetables, and melons, some livestock, horses, a movie/television studio, and a stunt location.<ref name=\"Rivers in the Desert\">{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7lvRnuwxmUoC&pg=PA92&dq=h+j+whitley&hl=en&ei=4P5-TOT3Koa4sAO7yeX0Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=h%20j%20whitley&f=false|title=Margaret Leslie Davis, ''Rivers in the Desert,'' 1993}}</ref>\n\nThe Canoga Park Airstrip occupied the area now known as \"Warner Center\" (as shown on the street map 1955 Thomas Guide).\n\n===Recent history===\n[[File:Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne Division.JPG|thumb|Aerojet Rocketdyne Division]]\nIn 1955, [[Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne|Rocketdyne]], then a division of [[North American Aviation]], moved into the area.

The Los Angeles River itself begins at the confluence of [[Arroyo Calabasas|Calabasas Creek]] and [[Bell Creek (Southern California)|Bell Creek]] behind [[Canoga Park High School]]. These and other small creeks supply stormwater and suburban runoff water to the Los Angeles River, and several are considered year round creeks.

Its 60,000+ residents are considered to be \"highly diverse\" ethnically. Before the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the district was part of a [[Ranchos of California|rancho]], and after the American victory it was converted into wheat farms and then subdivided, with part of it named '''Owensmouth''' as a town founded in 1912. It joined Los Angeles in 1917 and was renamed Canoga Park on March 1, 1931, thanks to the efforts of local civic leader Mary Logan Orcutt.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-American history===\nThe area of present-day Canoga Park was the homeland of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the [[Tongva people|Tongva-Fernande\u00f1o]] and [[Chumash people|Chumash-Ventura\u00f1o]] tribes, that lived in the Simi Hills and along to the tributaries of the [[Los Angeles River]]. They traded with the north Valley [[Tataviam people|Tataviam-Fernande\u00f1o]] people. [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] civilizations inhabited the Valley for an estimated 8,000 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/2006-03-03-prehistoric-mill_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Prehistoric milling site found in California|website=www.usatoday.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/local/states/california/northern_california/14007712.htm|title=Mercury News article|publisher=}}</ref> Their culture left the [[Burro Flats Painted Cave]] nearby.<ref>[http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/980/files/sspshp%20ethnohistory.pdf] SSPSHP link: pp.41\u20132</ref>\n\nFrom 1797 to 1846, the area was part of [[Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a]] (Mission San Fernando).

The purchasers of the land included [[Harry Chandler]] and [[Harrison Gray Otis (publisher)|Harrison Gray Otis]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[Moses Sherman]] (a [[Los Angeles Pacific Railroad]] streetcar line builder), and [[Hobart Johnstone Whitley]], an all purpose real estate developer who, from a start in the [[Land Rush of 1889]] in Oklahoma to platting out 140 towns, including [[Hollywood]].\n\n[[File:1920_Sherman_Way_in_downtown_Owensmouth.jpg|thumb|right| 1920 Sherman Way in downtown Owensmouth, with Los Angeles Pacific Railroad lines]]\n\nThe area was originally named ''[[Owensmouth]]'' by Los Angeles Suburban Home Company by general manager [[Hobart Johnstone Whitley]] as a sales tactic in that the town would be the new mouth of the Owens River, after the [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]] would be completed the next year. The town was founded on March 30, 1912, and the Suburban Home Company contracted with the [[Janss Investment Company]], to sell properties. A pre-development scheme brought [[Pacific Electric]] streetcars and an all purpose highway (Sherman Way) out all the way from Hollywood through [[Cahuenga Pass]], through the previously subdivided [[Van Nuys]] (1911). Highlighting the \"opening day barbecue\" was the display of the \"Owensmouth Baby\", a racecar that could go up and down the paved Sherman Way at the incredible speed of 35&nbsp;mph.\n\nOwensmouth, as the junior San Fernando Valley city to Van Nuys, promoted itself with the \"baby\" motif\u2014using storks in their advertisement. The \"baby city\" of the Valley remained a very small community.\n\nThe lack of an independent water supply made annexation to the City of Los Angeles inevitable, and on February 26, 1917, it joined with its larger neighbor.

On June 25, 2005, Canoga Park was named an [[All-America City]].\n\n==Geography==\nCanoga Park is bordered by [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]] on the south, [[West Hills, Los Angeles|West Hills]] on the west, [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles|Chatsworth]] on the north, and [[Winnetka, Los Angeles|Winnetka]] on the east.\n\n[[Bell Creek (Southern California)|Bell]] and Dayton Creeks flowing from the [[Simi Hills]], and [[Arroyo Calabasas]] (Calabasas Creek) from the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] are several of the [[Source (river or stream)|headwaters]] of the [[Los Angeles River]] that originate in the western [[San Fernando Valley]] that flow through Canoga Park. The Los Angeles River itself begins at the confluence of [[Arroyo Calabasas|Calabasas Creek]] and [[Bell Creek (Southern California)|Bell Creek]] behind [[Canoga Park High School]].

It is no. 143 in the edition by Muhammad Qazvini and Qasem Ghani (1941). It is described by [[Arthur John Arberry|A. J. Arberry]] as \"one of the finest poems of Hafez\".<ref>Arberry (1947), p. 153.</ref>\n\nIn this poem Hafez describes how for years he has looked for the precious [[cup of Jamshid]] but in the wrong place. Finally he takes his problem to a \"Magian Elder\" (that is, to a spiritual guide), who has had the cup all along. The Elder reassures him and counsels him that the answer to his quest lies within himself: Love, not Reason, is the way to find God.\n\nAccording to Arberry, this ghazal may be one of those from the third and last period of Hafez's life. This period is characterised by \"an increasing austerity of style, coupled with a growing tendency towards obscurity and allusiveness\".<ref>Arberry (1947), pp. 32\u20133.</ref> The interpretation of the poem is made more difficult by the fact that in different manuscripts the verses are found in a variety of different orders.\n\n==The poem==\nThe transcription shows the modern Iranian pronunciation. The letter x is used for ''kh'' (as in ''Khayyam''), q for both ''qeyn'' and ''gh\u0101f''; \" ' \" is a glottal stop.\n\nThe metre is {{lang|fa-Latn|ramal-e maxb\u016bn}} (\"hemmed ramal\u2009\"): 3.1.15 in Elwell-Sutton's classification: see [[Persian metres]]. In the scheme below, x = ''[[anceps]]'' (i.e. long or short syllable), u = a short syllable, and \u2013 = a long syllable:\n\n:| x u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | <u>u u</u> \u2013 |\n\nThis metre is one of Hafez's favourites, and is used in over a quarter (27%) of his poems.<ref>Elwell-Sutton, L. P. (1976), ''The Persian Metres'', p. 152.</ref>\n\n\"Overlong\" syllables, which take up the position of a long + a short syllable in the metrical pattern, are underlined.\n\nFor recitations of the

However, some manuscripts have a different order of verses. B and RS have the order 1 2 3 4 5 8 6 7 9 10; F has 1 2 6 3 4 8 * 7 9 5 10; and P has 1 2 3 4 8 * 5 7 9 6 10. (The star * represents an extra verse found in manuscripts F and P.)<ref>These manuscript names are those given by Arberry (1947), pp. 13, 153.</ref>\n\n==Characteristics of Hafez's later poems==\nAlthough the Divan (poetry collection) of Hafez, which was organised after his death by his friend Muhammad Gulandam, is arranged by the usual method of alphabetical order of the rhymes, it is possible to make out to a certain extent which poems are early, middle or late. Arberry, in his analysis of Hafez's style, identifies three phases in the poems. In the first, Hafez's ghazals dealt, like those of his predecessor [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]], with a single theme; there is little trace of mysticism or [[Sufism|Sufic]] allegory or of Hafez's philosophy of unreason. In the second phase, Hafez began to experiment with introducing two or more themes, or even fragments of themes, at once in the same poem; at the same time, he adopted a more spiritual viewpoint, that life is an insoluble mystery, that cannot be solved with philosophy or legalistic righteousness, but only with unreason and love. In the third phase, Hafez's poems become more severe and more allusive, and almost [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] in style. Arberry believes that Hafez's philosophy of unreason would have provided him with spiritual comfort in a period of history which witnessed the terrible devastations and massacres of the Mongols.<ref>Arberry (1947), pp. 228\u201333.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, [[Dick Davis (translator)|Dick Davis]] notes the diverse themes in this ghazal: \"In its mixture of various religious groupings, and its mingling of references to both secular pleasures (the wine, the beauties of the last stanza) and mystical insight (Jamshid's cup, Hallaj's martyrdom), and in its recommendation that one look inward for the truth (the pearl one has lost) the poem is typical of Hafez's polyphonic/polysemous poetic strategies.\"<ref>Davis (2008), [https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/articles/145586/translator39s-note-for-years-my-heart-inquired-of-by-hafez notes].</ref> \n\n==Notes on individual verses==\n===Verse 1===\n{{lang|fa-Latn|J\u0101m-e Jam}} \"the [[cup of Jamshid]]\" was famous in Persian poetry as a cup belonging to the legendary king Jam or [[Jamshid]], in which he could see the whole world. The cup appears in [[Ferdowsi]]'s [[Shahnameh]], but there the \"world-seeing cup\" is not Jamshid's but the cup of a later king, [[Kay Khosrow]]; however, it is implied that the cup was once Jamshid's, since he is described as knowing all the mysteries of the world.<ref>Nematollahi (2018), p. 5.</ref> By the time of the mystic poet [[Sanai|San\u0101'\u012b]] the cup is explicitly stated to be Jamshid's.\n\nIn Sana'i's mystical narrative poem ''Il\u0101h\u012b-N\u0101ma'' or ''Elahi-Nameh'', one of the six sections tells the story of a king's son who wanted to possess the cup. His father tells him the true spiritual meaning of the cup, which is that to attain eternity, he must leave behind the world, as Kay Khosow did, and annihilate himself.<ref>Nematollahi (2018), pp. 7\u201311.</ref>\n\n===Verse 2===\nThe subject of the verb {{lang|fa-Latn|m\u012bkard}} is {{lang|fa-Latn|del}} \"my heart\", which must be understood. The pearl for which my heart was seeking is the pearl of divine knowledge.<ref>Clarke (1897), vol 1, p. 258.</ref>\n\nThe \"sea\" is used in mystic poetry as a metaphor for divine love. The early 12th-century mystic poet [[Sanai|Sana'i]] wrote:<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/sanaee/divans/ghazal-sanaee/sh30/ Sana'i ghazal 30]; translated by Arberry (1947), p. 27.</ref>\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0639\u0634\u0642 \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u062d\u06cc\u0637 \u0648 \u0622\u0628 \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627 \u0622\u062a\u0634\u0633\u062a}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0645\u0648\u062c\u0647\u0627 \u0622\u06cc\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u06af\u0648\u06cc\u06cc \u06a9\u0648\u0647\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0638\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0633\u062a}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|<u>'e\u0161q</u> dary\u0101-y\u0113 moh\u012bt \u014d \u0101b-e dary\u0101 \u0101ta\u0161 ast}} \n:{{lang|fa-Latn|<u>mowj</u>h\u0101 \u0101yad ke g\u016b'\u012b <u>k\u016bh</u>h\u0101-y\u0113 zolmat ast}}\n\n:Love is a sea which encircles the world and the water of the sea is fire;\n:waves are coming which are like the mountains of the place of darkness.\n\nThose who are lost by the shore of the sea are those who have never experienced the mystic ecstasy and torments of divine love.\n\nArberry compares ghazal 1 ([[Al\u0101 y\u0101 ayyoha-s-s\u0101q\u012b]]) verse 5:<ref>Arberry (1947), p. 152.</ref>\n\n:The dark night and the fear of the waves and so terrifying a whirlpool \u2013\n:how can the lightly-burdened people of the coasts possibly know our state?\n\n===Verse 3===\nThe \"Magian Elder\" is literally a Zoroastrian wine-seller (since Muslims were not allowed to sell wine); but in Hafez's poetry it stands for the Pir (\"Elder\") or Murshid (\"Spiritual leader\") who helped [[Sufism|Sufi]] disciples in the path leading to union with God.\n\n===Verse 4===\nArberry compares the ghazal {{lang|fa-Latn|ey hodhod-\u0113 Sab\u0101}}, verse 7, where he notes: \"The poet compares the wine-cup (the symbol of unreason) with the all-revealing mirror of Alexander.\"\n\n===Verse 5===\nThe name ''Hak\u012bm'' \"the Wise One\" is often given to God in the Qur'an (e.g. Qur'an 2.32, 2.129, etc.).<ref>[http://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=Hkm Quran Dictionary: \u062d \u0643 \u0645].</ref> Arberry comments: \"Can any doubt remain after this verse that Hafiz intends by the imagery of the wine-cup the ecstatic's rapt vision?\"<ref>Arberry (1947), p. 154.</ref>\n\n===Verse 7===\nThis verse refers (using the Arabic words {{lang|fa-Latn|'as\u0101}} \"stick\", {{lang|fa-Latn|yad}} \"hand\" and {{lang|fa-Latn|beyz\u0101}} \"white\") to the Qur'an, Sura 20,<ref>[https://quran.com/20 Sura 20] (Sahih International).</ref> in which (verses 17\u201323) God gives Moses two signs: first He transforms Moses's stick into a snake and then He makes his hand white; Moses then uses his stick in a competition of sorcery with the Pharaoh's magicians (verses 56\u201373).<ref>Arberry (1947), p. 154.</ref> Later in the same Sura (verses 85\u201399) God reveals to Moses that during his absence the [[Samiri (Islamic figure)|S\u0101mir\u012b]] (or Samaritan) has led his people astray by having them worship a [[Golden calf|Golden Calf]]. Hafez here appears to conflate the stories of the magician ({{lang|fa-Latn|s\u0101her\u012b}}) who competed with Moses and the Samaritan ({{lang|fa-Latn|S\u0101mer\u012b}}) who led the people astray with the Golden Calf.\n\nFour manuscripts (B, RS, F, and P) have a slightly different text in this verse: {{lang|fa-Latn|\u0101n ham\u0113 \u0161o'bade-y\u0113 <u>'aql</u>}} \"all that sorcery of reason\".<ref>Arberry (1947), p. 154.</ref> Hafez often adopts the theme that Love, nor Reason, is the way to God. Clarke comments: \"As, opposed to the white hand and staff of M\u016bs\u0101, the sorceries of the sorcerer S\u0101miri were ineffective,\u2013 so, opposed to love (of God) and to the Pir of the Magians (the Murshid), the sorceries of reason are useless.\"<ref>Clarke (1897), vol. 1, p. 259.</ref>\n\nThe story of the magicians' competition is told in the Bible in Exodus 7:8\u201313<ref>[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+7&version=NIV Exodus 7].</ref> and the story of the Golden Calf in Exodus 32.<ref>[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+32&version=NIV Exodus 32]</ref> In the Bible, however, it is not a Samaritan but Moses' brother Aaron who makes the calf.\n\n===Verse 8===\nVerse 8 refers to the [[Sufism|Sufi]] mystic Husayn Mansur [[Al-Hallaj]], who was tortured and hanged for heresy or blasphemy in Baghdad in 922. He is famous for having uttered the phrase ''ana al-\u1e24aqq'' \"I am the Truth\" (a description often given to God himself).\n\nThe idea that the gallows which killed al-Hallaj lifted its head proud as well as tall is implied in Arberry's translation: \"That friend ... glorified the tree that slew him for his crime.\"<ref>Arberry (1947), p. 98.</ref>\n\nFollowing this verse two manuscripts have an extra verse.

The long locks of the beloved are compared to a chain which holds the lover captive.

It is no. 143 in the edition by Muhammad Qazvini and Qasem Ghani (1941). It is described by [[Arthur John Arberry|A. J. Arberry]] as \"one of the finest poems of Hafez\".<ref>Arberry (1947), p. 153.</ref>\n\nIn this poem Hafez describes how for years he has looked for the precious [[cup of Jamshid]] but in the wrong place. Finally he takes his problem to a \"Magian Elder\" (that is, to a spiritual guide), who has had the cup all along. The Elder reassures him and counsels him that the answer to his quest lies within himself: Love, not Reason, is the way to find God.\n\nAccording to Arberry, this ghazal may be one of those from the third and last period of Hafez's life. This period is characterised by \"an increasing austerity of style, coupled with a growing tendency towards obscurity and allusiveness\".<ref>Arberry (1947), pp. 32\u20133.</ref> The interpretation of the poem is made more difficult by the fact that in different manuscripts the verses are found in a variety of different orders.\n\n==The poem==\nThe transcription shows the modern Iranian pronunciation. The letter x is used for ''kh'' (as in ''Khayyam''), q for both ''qeyn'' and ''gh\u0101f''; \" ' \" is a glottal stop.\n\nThe metre is {{lang|fa-Latn|ramal-e maxb\u016bn}} (\"hemmed ramal\u2009\"): 3.1.15 in Elwell-Sutton's classification: see [[Persian metres]]. In the scheme below, x = ''[[anceps]]'' (i.e. long or short syllable), u = a short syllable, and \u2013 = a long syllable:\n\n:| x u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | <u>u u</u> \u2013 |\n\nThis metre is one of Hafez's favourites, and is used in over a quarter (27%) of his poems.<ref>Elwell-Sutton, L. P. (1976), ''The Persian Metres'', p. 152.</ref>\n\n\"Overlong\" syllables, which take up the position of a long + a short syllable in the metrical pattern, are underlined.\n\nFor recitations of the

However, some manuscripts have a different order of verses. B and RS have the order 1 2 3 4 5 8 6 7 9 10; F has 1 2 6 3 4 8 * 7 9 5 10; and P has 1 2 3 4 8 * 5 7 9 6 10. (The star * represents an extra verse found in manuscripts F and P.)<ref>These manuscript names are those given by Arberry (1947), pp. 13, 153.</ref>\n\n==Characteristics of Hafez's later poems==\nAlthough the Divan (poetry collection) of Hafez, which was organised after his death by his friend Muhammad Gulandam, is arranged by the usual method of alphabetical order of the rhymes, it is possible to make out to a certain extent which poems are early, middle or late. Arberry, in his analysis of Hafez's style, identifies three phases in the poems. In the first, Hafez's ghazals dealt, like those of his predecessor [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]], with a single theme; there is little trace of mysticism or [[Sufism|Sufic]] allegory or of Hafez's philosophy of unreason. In the second phase, Hafez began to experiment with introducing two or more themes, or even fragments of themes, at once in the same poem; at the same time, he adopted a more spiritual viewpoint, that life is an insoluble mystery, that cannot be solved with philosophy or legalistic righteousness, but only with unreason and love. In the third phase, Hafez's poems become more severe and more allusive, and almost [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] in style. Arberry believes that Hafez's philosophy of unreason would have provided him with spiritual comfort in a period of history which witnessed the terrible devastations and massacres of the Mongols.<ref>Arberry (1947), pp. 228\u201333.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, [[Dick Davis (translator)|Dick Davis]] notes the diverse themes in this ghazal: \"In its mixture of various religious groupings, and its mingling of references to both secular pleasures (the wine, the beauties of the last stanza) and mystical insight (Jamshid's cup, Hallaj's martyrdom), and in its recommendation that one look inward for the truth (the pearl one has lost) the poem is typical of Hafez's polyphonic/polysemous poetic strategies.\"<ref>Davis (2008), [https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/articles/145586/translator39s-note-for-years-my-heart-inquired-of-by-hafez notes].</ref> \n\n==Notes on individual verses==\n===Verse 1===\n{{lang|fa-Latn|J\u0101m-e Jam}} \"the [[cup of Jamshid]]\" was famous in Persian poetry as a cup belonging to the legendary king Jam or [[Jamshid]], in which he could see the whole world. The cup appears in [[Ferdowsi]]'s [[Shahnameh]], but there the \"world-seeing cup\" is not Jamshid's but the cup of a later king, [[Kay Khosrow]]; however, it is implied that the cup was once Jamshid's, since he is described as knowing all the mysteries of the world.<ref>Nematollahi (2018), p. 5.</ref> By the time of the mystic poet [[Sanai|San\u0101'\u012b]] the cup is explicitly stated to be Jamshid's.\n\nIn Sana'i's mystical narrative poem ''Il\u0101h\u012b-N\u0101ma'' or ''Elahi-Nameh'', one of the six sections tells the story of a king's son who wanted to possess the cup. His father tells him the true spiritual meaning of the cup, which is that to attain eternity, he must leave behind the world, as Kay Khosow did, and annihilate himself.<ref>Nematollahi (2018), pp. 7\u201311.</ref>\n\n===Verse 2===\nThe subject of the verb {{lang|fa-Latn|m\u012bkard}} is {{lang|fa-Latn|del}} \"my heart\", which must be understood. The pearl for which my heart was seeking is the pearl of divine knowledge.<ref>Clarke (1897), vol 1, p. 258.</ref>\n\nThe \"sea\" is used in mystic poetry as a metaphor for divine love. The early 12th-century mystic poet [[Sanai|Sana'i]] wrote:<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/sanaee/divans/ghazal-sanaee/sh30/ Sana'i ghazal 30]; translated by Arberry (1947), p. 27.</ref>\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0639\u0634\u0642 \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u062d\u06cc\u0637 \u0648 \u0622\u0628 \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627 \u0622\u062a\u0634\u0633\u062a}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0645\u0648\u062c\u0647\u0627 \u0622\u06cc\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u06af\u0648\u06cc\u06cc \u06a9\u0648\u0647\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0638\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0633\u062a}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|<u>'e\u0161q</u> dary\u0101-y\u0113 moh\u012bt \u014d \u0101b-e dary\u0101 \u0101ta\u0161 ast}} \n:{{lang|fa-Latn|<u>mowj</u>h\u0101 \u0101yad ke g\u016b'\u012b <u>k\u016bh</u>h\u0101-y\u0113 zolmat ast}}\n\n:Love is a sea which encircles the world and the water of the sea is fire;\n:waves are coming which are like the mountains of the place of darkness.\n\nThose who are lost by the shore of the sea are those who have never experienced the mystic ecstasy and torments of divine love.\n\nArberry compares ghazal 1 ([[Al\u0101 y\u0101 ayyoha-s-s\u0101q\u012b]]) verse 5:<ref>Arberry (1947), p. 152.</ref>\n\n:The dark night and the fear of the waves and so terrifying a whirlpool \u2013\n:how can the lightly-burdened people of the coasts possibly know our state?\n\n===Verse 3===\nThe \"Magian Elder\" is literally a Zoroastrian wine-seller (since Muslims were not allowed to sell wine); but in Hafez's poetry it stands for the Pir (\"Elder\") or Murshid (\"Spiritual leader\") who helped [[Sufism|Sufi]] disciples in the path leading to union with God.\n\n===Verse 4===\nArberry compares the ghazal {{lang|fa-Latn|ey hodhod-\u0113 Sab\u0101}}, verse 7, where he notes: \"The poet compares the wine-cup (the symbol of unreason) with the all-revealing mirror of Alexander.\"\n\n===Verse 5===\nThe name ''Hak\u012bm'' \"the Wise One\" is often given to God in the Qur'an (e.g. Qur'an 2.32, 2.129, etc.).<ref>[http://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=Hkm Quran Dictionary: \u062d \u0643 \u0645].</ref> Arberry comments: \"Can any doubt remain after this verse that Hafiz intends by the imagery of the wine-cup the ecstatic's rapt vision?\"<ref>Arberry (1947), p. 154.</ref>\n\n===Verse 7===\nThis verse refers (using the Arabic words {{lang|fa-Latn|'as\u0101}} \"stick\", {{lang|fa-Latn|yad}} \"hand\" and {{lang|fa-Latn|beyz\u0101}} \"white\") to the Qur'an, Sura 20,<ref>[https://quran.com/20 Sura 20] (Sahih International).</ref> in which (verses 17\u201323) God gives Moses two signs: first He transforms Moses's stick into a snake and then He makes his hand white; Moses then uses his stick in a competition of sorcery with the Pharaoh's magicians (verses 56\u201373).<ref>Arberry (1947), p. 154.</ref> Later in the same Sura (verses 85\u201399) God reveals to Moses that during his absence the [[Samiri (Islamic figure)|S\u0101mir\u012b]] (or Samaritan) has led his people astray by having them worship a [[Golden calf|Golden Calf]]. Hafez here appears to conflate the stories of the magician ({{lang|fa-Latn|s\u0101her\u012b}}) who competed with Moses and the Samaritan ({{lang|fa-Latn|S\u0101mer\u012b}}) who led the people astray with the Golden Calf.\n\nFour manuscripts (B, RS , F, and P) have a slightly different text in this verse: {{lang|fa-Latn|\u0101n ham\u0113 \u0161o'bade-y\u0113 <u>'aql</u>}} \"all that sorcery of reason\".<ref>Arberry (1947), p. 154.</ref> Hafez often adopts the theme that Love, nor Reason, is the way to God. Clarke comments: \"As, opposed to the white hand and staff of M\u016bs\u0101, the sorceries of the sorcerer S\u0101miri were ineffective,\u2013 so, opposed to love (of God) and to the Pir of the Magians (the Murshid), the sorceries of reason are useless.\"<ref>Clarke (1897), vol. 1, p. 259.</ref>\n\nThe story of the magicians' competition is told in the Bible in Exodus 7:8\u201313<ref>[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+7&version=NIV Exodus 7].</ref> and the story of the Golden Calf in Exodus 32.<ref>[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+32&version=NIV Exodus 32]</ref> In the Bible, however, it is not a Samaritan but Moses' brother Aaron who makes the calf.\n\n===Verse 8===\nVerse 8 refers to the [[Sufism|Sufi]] mystic Husayn Mansur [[Al-Hallaj]], who was tortured and hanged for heresy or blasphemy in Baghdad in 922. He is famous for having uttered the phrase ''ana al-\u1e24aqq'' \"I am the Truth\" (a description often given to God himself).\n\nThe idea that the gallows which killed al-Hallaj lifted its head proud as well as tall is implied in Arberry's translation: \"That friend ... glorified the tree that slew him for his crime.\"<ref>Arberry (1947), p. 98.</ref>\n\nFollowing this verse two manuscripts have an extra verse.

It grossed nearly $35 million against a budget of $20 million.<ref name=\"bom\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the year [[10,000 BC (film)|10,001 B.C.]], a [[caveman]] runs away from a predator through a plain and immediately gets into a fight with [[Michael Van Wijk|Wolf]] ([[Ike Barinholtz]]). After defeating him, the caveman then encounters the predator, a [[Saber-toothed cat|saber-toothed]], [[gasoline]]-drinking [[Amy Winehouse]] ([[Nicole Parker]]), who informs him that the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|world will end]] on August 29, 2008 and that their fate lies in a [[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|Crystal Skull]]. The sequence is then revealed to be a dream of [[everyman]] Will ([[Matt Lanter]]) in the present day. He then finds out that his girlfriend Amy ([[Vanessa Minnillo]]) is having an affair with [[Flavor Flav]] (Abe Spigner), and she breaks up with Will because he is not admitting his true feelings for her.\n\nLater that day, Will has a \"[[My Super Sweet 16|Super Duper Sweet Sixteen]]\" party at his house, despite being 25. The guests include [[Juno (film)|Juney]] ([[Crista Flanagan]]), [[Phil McGraw|Dr. Phil]] (John Di Domenico), Will's best friend Calvin (Gary \"G Thang\" Johnson), and [[Anton Chigurh]] (Barinholtz), among others. During the party, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, a [[Calvin Klein]] underwear model. The party then comes to a halt when the room shakes and the lights go out. A bulletin on the radio claims there is a [[meteor shower]] and it is the end of the world. Soon after, the city starts to [[The Day After Tomorrow|freeze over]], and Will, Juney, Calvin, and Calvin's girlfriend Lisa ([[Kim Kardashian]]) retreat to a garage for shelter. When Juney mentions that the calamities are caused by [[global warming]], Will realizes his dream as a caveman could be related. Later, Will is chided by the others for not committing himself to his relationship with Amy.\n\nThe gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, where he admits his feelings for her before the call is dropped. He decides to go to rescue Amy. Lisa is later killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, [[Giselle (Disney)|Giselle]] (Parker), a prostitute, climbs out of a [[manhole]] and gets hit by a [[Taxicab|taxi]]. Calvin catches her, and they [[Love at first sight|immediately fall in love with each other]]. Giselle's [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], [[Enchanted (2007 film)|Prince Edwin]] ([[Tad Hilgenbrink]]), challenges Calvin to [[Step Up 2: The Streets|a dance fight]] for her love, but [[Twister (1996 film)|a tornado]] appears and Prince Edwin flees. [[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]] (Gerrard Fachinni), [[Hellboy]] (Barinholtz), and [[The Incredible Hulk (film)|the Hulk]] ([[Roland Kickinger]]) attempt to fight it, but all are defeated by [[Cattle|cows]] thrown by the tornado. After taking shelter, Will, Juney, Calvin, and Giselle encounter [[Rabies|rabid]] knockoffs of [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]], who attack the gang and kill Juney. The \"Chipmunks\" then go after Will and Calvin, but they trap them in a trash can, fatally suffocating them as they attempt to escape.\n\nOn their way to the museum where Amy is trapped, the group runs into [[Batman]], who informs them that they must go to evacuation buses and that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. With time against them, Princess Giselle kills [[Speed Racer (film)|Speed Racer]] (Jared S. Eddo), and the group hijacks his [[Mach Five]] to drive to the museum. At the museum, they save Amy, who reveals that the Crystal Skull is the only thing that can stop the end of the world. Calvin and the Princess then find that the museum doors are closed and all of the artifacts have [[Night at the Museum|come alive]], including [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Po from Kung Fu Panda]] (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin but is defeated. When Calvin makes out with the Princess, Calvin accidentally pulls her [[wig]] and discovers that she is actually a [[Transvestism|transvestite]]. While this happens, \"Po\" takes out a [[katana]] and simultaneously kills Calvin and the Princess.\n\nMeanwhile, Will and Amy run into a nude [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]] (Barinholtz), who fights with Will. After Amy stabs \"Beowulf\" in the back, Will and Amy encounter [[Indiana Jones]] ([[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]]), who is revealed to be Will's father. \"Indy\" tries to put the Crystal Skull on the altar, but he flys through a stained glass window in the room.

After defeating him, the caveman then encounters the predator, a [[Saber-toothed cat|saber-toothed]], [[gasoline]]-drinking [[Amy Winehouse]] ([[Nicole Parker]]), who informs him that the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|world will end]] on August 29, 2008 and that their fate lies in a [[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|Crystal Skull]]. The sequence is then revealed to be a dream of [[everyman]] Will ([[Matt Lanter]]) in the present day. He then finds out that his girlfriend Amy ([[Vanessa Minnillo]]) is having an affair with [[Flavor Flav]] (Abe Spigner), and she breaks up with Will because he is not admitting his true feelings for her.\n\nLater that day, Will has a \"[[My Super Sweet 16|Super Duper Sweet Sixteen]]\" party at his house, despite being 25. The guests include [[Juno (film)|Juney]] ([[Crista Flanagan]]), [[Phil McGraw|Dr. Phil]] (John Di Domenico), Will's best friend Calvin (Gary \"G Thang\" Johnson), and [[Anton Chigurh]] (Barinholtz), among others. During the party, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, a [[Calvin Klein]] underwear model. The party then comes to a halt when the room shakes and the lights go out. A bulletin on the radio claims there is a [[meteor shower]] and it is the end of the world. Soon after, the city starts to [[The Day After Tomorrow|freeze over]], and Will, Juney, Calvin, and Calvin's girlfriend Lisa ([[Kim Kardashian]]) retreat to a garage for shelter. When Juney mentions that the calamities are caused by [[global warming]], Will realizes his dream as a caveman could be related. Later, Will is chided by the others for not committing himself to his relationship with Amy.\n\nThe gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, where he admits his feelings for her before the call is dropped. He decides to go to rescue Amy. Lisa is later killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, [[Giselle (Disney)|Giselle]] (Parker), a prostitute, climbs out of a [[manhole]] and gets hit by a [[Taxicab|taxi]]. Calvin catches her, and they [[Love at first sight|immediately fall in love with each other]]. Giselle's [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], [[Enchanted (2007 film)|Prince Edwin]] ([[Tad Hilgenbrink]]), challenges Calvin to [[Step Up 2: The Streets|a dance fight]] for her love, but [[Twister (1996 film)|a tornado]] appears and Prince Edwin flees. [[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]] (Gerrard Fachinni), [[Hellboy]] (Barinholtz), and [[The Incredible Hulk (film)|the Hulk]] ([[Roland Kickinger]]) attempt to fight it, but all are defeated by [[Cattle|cows]] thrown by the tornado. After taking shelter, Will, Juney, Calvin, and Giselle encounter [[Rabies|rabid]] knockoffs of [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]], who attack the gang and kill Juney. The \"Chipmunks\" then go after Will and Calvin, but they trap them in a trash can, fatally suffocating them as they attempt to escape.\n\nOn their way to the museum where Amy is trapped, the group runs into [[Batman]], who informs them that they must go to evacuation buses and that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. With time against them, Princess Giselle kills [[Speed Racer (film)|Speed Racer]] (Jared S. Eddo), and the group hijacks his [[Mach Five]] to drive to the museum. At the museum, they save Amy, who reveals that the Crystal Skull is the only thing that can stop the end of the world. Calvin and the Princess then find that the museum doors are closed and all of the artifacts have [[Night at the Museum|come alive]], including [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Po from Kung Fu Panda]] (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin but is defeated. When Calvin makes out with the Princess, Calvin accidentally pulls her [[wig]] and discovers that she is actually a [[Transvestism|transvestite]]. While this happens, \"Po\" takes out a [[katana]] and simultaneously kills Calvin and the Princess.\n\nMeanwhile, Will and Amy run into a nude [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]] (Barinholtz), who fights with Will. After Amy stabs \"Beowulf\" in the back, Will and Amy encounter [[Indiana Jones]] ([[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]]), who is revealed to be Will's father. \"Indy\" tries to put the Crystal Skull on the altar, but he flys through a stained glass window in the room. Will does it instead, and he averts further destruction. Will and Amy have a [[wedding]] ceremony performed by [[The Love Guru|\"The Guru Shitka\"]] (Domenico), which ends with a musical number about all of the characters in the film dating each other (fucking in the unrated version) parodying \"I'm Fucking Matt Damon\" by Sarah Silverman.\n\n== Parodies ==\n{{unrefsec|date=February 2020}}\n=== Films and TV shows ===\n<!-- DO NOT ADD AN ITEM WITHOUT A CITATION TO A RELIABLE SOURCE.

The competition is run under the auspices of the [[New South Wales Country Rugby League|Country Rugby League]] and players are eligible for selection in the [[Canberra]] Division of the CRL Tier 1 Divisional Championships. The Canberra district competition has an under 19s, reserve and first grade competitions.\n\n==History==\nAfter the establishment of Rugby League in Sydney in 1909, the game slowly made its way south, reaching the Canberra District in the late 1910s. During those years and into the 1920s and 30s Challenge Cup football was the most popular form of competition, with a cup being donated as a prize for a game between 2 teams. The winning team would then have to defend the cup against all challengers. The most notable Challenge Cups in the Canberra region at the time were the Massey and Carr Cups which began in 1930 and 1933 respectively.\n\nThe first organised round robin competition was run in 1928 by Federal Capital Territory and District Rugby League. The winners of inaugural competition were the Acton Rovers and the next four years saw four different winners. The competition ran through until 1937 when interest in League began to dwindle.\n\nThe Group 8 Premiership began in 1932 and was strong enough to continue while interest in the game waned. Teams from Canberra, Yass, Queanbeyan and Goulburn competed for the title of premiers up until 1941, when all League competitions in the region were suspended due to the war. Competition resumed in 1946, with the Massey and Carr Cups only lasting the one season before being retired, while the Group 8 Premiership continued on strongly and was duly supported by ACT District Rugby League who ran a second division competition.\n\nSome of the teams to compete during this period included Captains Flat, Crookwell, Braidwood, Goulburn Workers, Goulburn United, Queanbeyan and Yass in the Group 8 Competition while in the ACTDRL Second Division competition there were teams such as Ainslie, Causeway, Eastlake, Hall, R.A.A.F, R.M.C, South City and West City.\n\nIt was through the Second Division competition that the Molonglo Shield was established, first being played for in 1964 with Harman/NAVY taking out the inaugural title over the Canberra Rovers.\n\nIn 1967 Group 8 joined with part of Group 9 to form Group 8/9 or Zone 2. This was due to a CRL boundaries dispute in the Riverina, and saw Harden, Young and Wyangala Dam join the district competition. The Zone 2 format lasted until 1970 when CRL returned the boundaries in the Riverina to their original positions and Group 8 was restored.\n\nIn 1974 CRL officially recognised the Molonglo Shield as its own competition and gave it a Group number, Group 19. It was at this point in time that both Group 8 and Group 19 were strong enough to run first and second division competitions. The first division clubs ran firsts, reserves and Under 18's while the second division sides ran just one team.\n\nGroup 8 First Division consisted mainly of the teams which play Canberra Raiders Cup today, with the addition of Crookwell and Goulburn United. Group 8 Second Division was primarily for towns from around the Goulburn District including Taralga, Marulan, Bigga and Argyle. Braidwood also fielded a side in the competition.\n\nGroup 19 First Division comprised teams from around Canberra including Kambah, South Woden, Belconnen United and North Canberra. Batemans Bay also competed in Group 19 until 1977. Second Division was much like George Tooke Shield is today, with teams from Harman, Bungendore, Weston Creek and Captains Flat all competing for the title.\n\nIn 1980 Group 19 changed its name to ACTRL while in 1981 Group 8 changed to CDRL. In 1982 CDRL was granted entry into the NSWRL as the Canberra Raiders so the ACTRL took over the running of senior league in the district, combining the two groups to form 3 new competitions. The premier division still played for the Molonglo Shield, while the second division competition was split into North and South according to location within the District. In 1986 the two second division competitions were merged to form the Canberra Cup, which ran through until 1998.\n\nIn the meantime, a move by regional towns saw the establishment of the George Tooke Shield in 1995, which was aimed at clubs that wished to field firsts and under 18s but were not competitive enough for Molonglo Shield. In its first year 5 teams competed: East Canberra, Braidwood, Yass, Crookwell and Goulburn Exchange. While the Under 18s side of the competition only lasted 2 years, the George Tooke Shield has continued to expand, 9 clubs now competing for the title.\n\nIn 1998, after 35 years, the Molonglo Shield was retired and the Canberra Raiders Cup became the prize the first grade clubs fought for over a season. It is still that way today and the Shield still has its place in the game, awarded to the First Grade Minor Premiers.\n\n==Clubs==\n\n=== Current Senior Clubs ===\n\n==== First Grade Clubs ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n!

[[Australian Capital Territory]] and surrounding [[New South Wales]] towns [[Queanbeyan]], [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] and [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]]. The competition is run under the auspices of the [[New South Wales Country Rugby League|Country Rugby League]] and players are eligible for selection in the [[Canberra]] Division of the CRL Tier 1 Divisional Championships. The Canberra district competition has an under 19s, reserve and first grade competitions.\n\n==History==\nAfter the establishment of Rugby League in Sydney in 1909, the game slowly made its way south, reaching the Canberra District in the late 1910s. During those years and into the 1920s and 30s Challenge Cup football was the most popular form of competition, with a cup being donated as a prize for a game between 2 teams. The winning team would then have to defend the cup against all challengers. The most notable Challenge Cups in the Canberra region at the time were the Massey and Carr Cups which began in 1930 and 1933 respectively.\n\nThe first organised round robin competition was run in 1928 by Federal Capital Territory and District Rugby League. The winners of inaugural competition were the Acton Rovers and the next four years saw four different winners. The competition ran through until 1937 when interest in League began to dwindle.\n\nThe Group 8 Premiership began in 1932 and was strong enough to continue while interest in the game waned. Teams from Canberra, Yass, Queanbeyan and Goulburn competed for the title of premiers up until 1941, when all League competitions in the region were suspended due to the war. Competition resumed in 1946, with the Massey and Carr Cups only lasting the one season before being retired, while the Group 8 Premiership continued on strongly and was duly supported by ACT District Rugby League who ran a second division competition.\n\nSome of the teams to compete during this period included Captains Flat, Crookwell, Braidwood, Goulburn Workers, Goulburn United, Queanbeyan and Yass in the Group 8 Competition while in the ACTDRL Second Division competition there were teams such as Ainslie, Causeway, Eastlake, Hall, R.A.A.F, R.M.C, South City and West City.\n\nIt was through the Second Division competition that the Molonglo Shield was established, first being played for in 1964 with Harman/NAVY taking out the inaugural title over the Canberra Rovers.\n\nIn 1967 Group 8 joined with part of Group 9 to form Group 8/9 or Zone 2. This was due to a CRL boundaries dispute in the Riverina, and saw Harden, Young and Wyangala Dam join the district competition. The Zone 2 format lasted until 1970 when CRL returned the boundaries in the Riverina to their original positions and Group 8 was restored.\n\nIn 1974 CRL officially recognised the Molonglo Shield as its own competition and gave it a Group number, Group 19. It was at this point in time that both Group 8 and Group 19 were strong enough to run first and second division competitions. The first division clubs ran firsts, reserves and Under 18's while the second division sides ran just one team.\n\nGroup 8 First Division consisted mainly of the teams which play Canberra Raiders Cup today, with the addition of Crookwell and Goulburn United. Group 8 Second Division was primarily for towns from around the Goulburn District including Taralga, Marulan, Bigga and Argyle. Braidwood also fielded a side in the competition.\n\nGroup 19 First Division comprised teams from around Canberra including Kambah, South Woden, Belconnen United and North Canberra. Batemans Bay also competed in Group 19 until 1977. Second Division was much like George Tooke Shield is today, with teams from Harman, Bungendore, Weston Creek and Captains Flat all competing for the title.\n\nIn 1980 Group 19 changed its name to ACTRL while in 1981 Group 8 changed to CDRL. In 1982 CDRL was granted entry into the NSWRL as the Canberra Raiders so the ACTRL took over the running of senior league in the district, combining the two groups to form 3 new competitions. The premier division still played for the Molonglo Shield, while the second division competition was split into North and South according to location within the District. In 1986 the two second division competitions were merged to form the Canberra Cup, which ran through until 1998.\n\nIn the meantime, a move by regional towns saw the establishment of the George Tooke Shield in 1995, which was aimed at clubs that wished to field firsts and under 18s but were not competitive enough for Molonglo Shield. In its first year 5 teams competed: East Canberra, Braidwood, Yass, Crookwell and Goulburn Exchange. While the Under 18s side of the competition only lasted 2 years, the George Tooke Shield has continued to expand, 9 clubs now competing for the title.\n\nIn 1998, after 35 years, the Molonglo Shield was retired and the Canberra Raiders Cup became the prize the first grade clubs fought for over a season. It is still that way today and the Shield still has its place in the game, awarded to the First Grade Minor Premiers.\n\n==Clubs==\n\n=== Current Senior Clubs ===\n\n==== First Grade Clubs ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Club\n!Established\n!City\n!State\n!Home Ground\n!Premierships\nwon\n!Seasons in League\n|-\n!

In the Parramatta competition after Parramatta was admitted to the NSWRL in 1947, and also in a second-tier Sydney competition introduced by the NSWRL in 1962. By this time a single top level rugby league team had emerged in the Penrith area and in 1964 they became known as the Penrith Panthers. The Panther had been chosen as the Penrith emblem after a public competition won by a graphic artist from [[Emu Plains]] named Deidre Copeland.\n\nIn 1966 word was out that the New South Wales Rugby League in 1967 would introduce two new teams to the Sydney premiership. There were three teams vying for the two proposed slots, Penrith, [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks|Cronulla-Sutherland]], and the [[Wentworthville Magpies]]. Cronulla-Sutherland had been assured of one place, leaving Penrith and Wentworthville to fight it out for the other place. The NSWRL eventually settled on Penrith due to their location and a win in the 1966 Second Division title.\n\nAfter admission to the competition in [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1967|1967]], they promptly came second last on the competition ladder. Hopes were raised in 1968 under new Captain-Coach Bob Boland when they won the pre-season competition and finished 8th, but this improvement proved to be short lived.\n\nPenrith had trouble attracting the sort of experienced players they knew they needed, and although they always had good junior talent coming through, they did not get the on-field leadership they needed. Penrith needed to wait until they could develop their own 'stars'. They consequently struggled for almost 20 years before finally reaching their first finals series in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1985|1985]] with a team boasting new local star [[Greg Alexander]] and captained by [[Royce Simmons]].\n\nPenrith developed a strong team in the late 80s and started to build momentum. They made their first Grand Final appearance in [[NSWRL season 1990|1990]] with a team boasting notable players the likes of [[Greg Alexander]], [[John Cartwright (rugby league)|John Cartwright]], [[Brad Fittler]] and [[Mark Geyer]] only to be beaten by the [[Canberra Raiders]] 18\u201314. The next year the Panthers met the Raiders again in the Grand Final, this time winning 19 to 12, including two tries by Royce Simmons the former team captain in his last game. They went on to play [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] in England for the [[1991 World Club Challenge]] but were beaten by the British champions 21\u20134.<ref>[http://www.superleague.co.uk/wcc_1991-2.php?rid=321 Super League Europe \u2013 World Club Challenge 1991] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306132328/http://www.superleague.co.uk/wcc_1991-2.php?rid=321 |date=6 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\nTheir reign was short lived as in 1992 tragedy struck the club when the younger brother of Captain [[Greg Alexander]], [[Ben Alexander (rugby league)|Ben]], died in a car accident. Greg and close family friends [[Mark Geyer]] and [[Brad Fittler]] left the club soon after (Fittler left after the 1995 season as Penrith had signed with Super League) as well as coach [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]] left midway through the 1994 season.\n\nPenrith were coached by former player and club captain [[Royce Simmons]] starting with the last six games in 1994 until the end of 2001.\n\nThey made the finals during the [[Super League (Australia) season 1997|1997 Super League season]] and then again in 2000 in the re-united [[NRL]] competition where they were defeated 28-10 by the [[Parramatta Eels]] in the elimination semi-final.\n\nIn the [[2001 NRL season]], Penrith came last on the competition ladder. The same year was Royce Simmons' last season as coach for Penrith, and he was replaced by [[John Lang (Australian rugby league)|John Lang]] from Cronulla in 2002, where they finished 12th. Their last game of 2002 showed hope as they proceeded to thrash the [[Northern Eagles]], knocking them out of the final eight.\n\nThis showed the promise that was to come the next year and we all hoped Stu would go away.  With the signing of [[Preston Campbell]] and [[Joe Galuvao]], their side fired in 2003. Coming off 3 early season losses, they proceeded to lose only 3 other games for the rest of the competition with the local hero, [[Rhys Wesser]] scoring a new club record 25 tries. Penrith finished as Minor Premiers after convincingly accounting for the [[Parramatta Eels]] in the last round of competition. In the Finals series Penrith beat the [[Brisbane Broncos]] and [[New Zealand Warriors]] to reach the [[2003 NRL Grand Final]] ..Entering the match as underdogs, Penrith defeated the Roosters 18\u20136, with winger [[Luke Rooney]] scoring two tries. Hooker [[Luke Priddis]] received the [[Clive Churchill Medal]]. The game is also remembered for a spectacular tackle by [[Scott Sattler]] in the 2nd Half, where he ran down and tackled Roosters winger Todd Byrne, who was sprinting down the left wing for an almost certain try. Penrith lost the [[2004 World Club Challenge]] in the following pre-season, with the [[Bradford Bulls]] defeating them 22\u20134 in sub-zero temperatures.<ref>[http://www.superleague.co.uk/wcc_2004.php?rid=321 Super League Europe \u2013 World Club Challenge 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306132411/http://www.superleague.co.uk/wcc_2004.php?rid=321 |date=6 March 2009 }}</ref> The Panthers did however rally after that loss and once again qualified for the NRL semi-final series by finishing fourth and defeating St George Illawarra in the first week of the semi-finals before being knocked out by the Bulldogs in the Grand Final qualifier two weeks later.\n\nPenrith then just failed to qualify for the Top 8 in 2005 finishing two points out and in 10th spot on percentages. They endured another below-par season in 2006 this time falling well short of the finals finishing the year in 12th position. The 2007 season turned out to be a poor one for the Panthers, they won only eight games, finished last and \"won\" the wooden-spoon for the second time in six years after losing to the [[New Zealand Warriors]] in the last round of the regular season competition.\n\nIn 2008, Penrith improved four spots on their 2007 performance by finishing in 12th spot out of 16 teams in the NRL competition with 10 wins, one draw and 13 losses. In 2009 they finished the season in 11th spot out of 16 teams in the NRL competition with 11 wins, one draw and 12 losses.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn 2010, Penrith had an excellent season, finishing in 2nd place in the ladder out of the 16 teams, with 16 wins and 9 losses.  However, in the first round of the Finals series, they lost 22:24 at home to the [[Canberra Raiders]] and were knocked out in the second round when they lost 34:12 to the [[Sydney Roosters]].\n\n[[Michael Gordon (rugby league)|Michael Gordon]] played very well in that year, setting two new club records.   In round 24, against the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]], he set a new club record for most points scored in one game: 30.  By the end of the final game of the regular season, game 24, round 26, he had also set a new club record for the most points scored in one season at 270.\n\nIn 2011, following a terrible start to the season, the Penrith board decided to sever ties with coach [[Matthew Elliott (rugby league)|Matthew Elliot]] at season's end. On 20 June 2011 he stepped down as coach and that same day [[Steve Georgallis]] was appointed caretaker coach for the remainder of the season. On 29 June [[Ivan Cleary]] was announced as coach for the next 3 seasons, with Georgallis staying as assistant coach for the remainder of the season.\n\nAfter a 2010 season where the club went above and beyond expectations, they were looking to starting the new season on a high. It wasn't to be, however, when they were thumped by Newcastle at the newly named Centrebet Stadium, 42-8. While round 2 went a lot better for the team, beating rivals the Eels at [[Parramatta Stadium]] 20-6, the year was marked by inconsistency as they finished 12th on the ladder.\n\n2012 was again a disappointing year for Penrith, finishing second last with an 8-16 record. However, the club discovered some new talent in the form of winger [[Josh Mansour]], a candidate for Rookie of the Year, as well as fullback Lachlan Coote's successful move to five-eighth.\n\n2013 began poorly for the Penrith; after a first up win against the [[Canberra Raiders]], they went on to lose their next five games. However, a more inspired performance against the [[Parramatta Eels]] in round 7, where they won 44-12, was a trigger for a strong run; four wins from five games to see Penrith move into the top eight of the competition. The four wins included a 12-10 victory over the reigning premiers, [[Melbourne Storm]], and a 64-6 thrashing of the [[New Zealand Warriors]]. However, after a year with mixed results, Penrith finished in tenth position, one win out of the top eight. At the end of the season, the likes of [[Luke Walsh]], [[Lachlan Coote]], [[Mose Masoe]] and [[Brad Tighe]] departed.\n\nA playing roster overhaul saw the arrival of big name players such as [[Jamie Soward]], [[Peter Wallace]], [[Jamal Idris]], [[Tyrone Peachey]] and [[Elijah Taylor]] at Penrith, while [[Matt Moylan]] took the vacant fullback role left by the departed [[Lachlan Coote]].\n\nThe [[2014 NRL season]] was a good year for Penrith as they qualified for the finals and made it to the preliminary final before losing to Canterbury 18-12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-27/dogs-hold-out-panthers-to-book-grand-final-berth/5774120/|title=Canterbury hold out Penrith to book grand final berth|website=ABC}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2015 NRL season]], Penrith endured a horror year on the field finishing second last.

Griffin was then replaced by [[Cameron Ciraldo]] for the remainder of the season.  In week one of the finals, Penrith easily accounted for the [[New Zealand Warriors]] to set up a clash with Cronulla.  Although both clubs were admitted into the competition in 1967 this would provide the first meeting between the two clubs in a finals match.  In a tight game, Cronulla defeated Penrith 21-20 ending their season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-06/anthony-griffin-sacked-as-penrith-panthers-nrl-coach/10079296/|title=Anthony Griffin sacked|website=ABC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wwos.nine.com.au/nrl/nrl-cronulla-sharks-eliminate-penrith-panthers-in-semi-final-showdown/29379509-6ed0-4fd7-9ba7-a4ee3708dbf0/|title=Cronulla eliminate Penrith in semi final showdown|website=WWOS}}</ref>\n\nBefore the commencement of the [[2019 NRL season]], Penrith were predicted by many to challenge for the premiership and reach the finals.  Penrith got off to a bad start with the club winning only 2 of their first 10 matches leaving the team bottom of the table.  Penrith would then go on to win their next 7 games in a row leaving them just outside the finals places.  In a must win game against the [[Sydney Roosters]] in round 24, Penrith lost the match 22-6 at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] which meant that the club would miss out on the finals series for the first time since 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/panthers/panthers-torch-3-million-in-dud-investments-to-go-backwards/news-story/ff94e2be41459c89d9badf0e6134b012/|title=Panthers torch $3 million in dud investments \u2026 to go backwards|website=Fox Sports}}</ref>\n\n==Sponsorship==\nThroughout their history, the Panthers have gone through 10 major sponsors (These sponsors appear on the chest of the jersey).\n\n*[[FEENEY]] (1977)\n*[[Alpha Micro]] (1984\u201385)\n*[[2KA|Radio 2KA]] (1986\u201387)\n*[[Penrith City]] (1988)\n*[[Calphos]] (1989)\n*[[Dahdah Uniforms]] (1990-1993)\n*[[Prospect Electricity]] (1994-1995)\n*[[Classifieds]] (1996)\n*[[Sanyo]] (2000-2012)\n*[[Oak (flavoured milk)|OAK Milk]] (2012\u2013''present'')\n\n==Kit Suppliers==\n\n*[[Peerless Sports]] (19??-1996)\n*[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] (1997-1998)\n*[[Classic Sportswear]] (1999-2003)\n*[[International Sports Clothing|ISC]] (2004-2012)\n*[[Asics]] (2013-2017)\n*[[Classic Sportswear]] (2018-2019)\n*[[O'Neills]] (2020-present)\n\n==Name and colours==\n\n<gallery align=\"center\" caption=\"Penrith Panthers Logos\">\nFile:Penrith_logo_1988.jpg|1979\u20131990\nFile:Penrith Panthers Logo 1991.jpg|1991\u20131999\nFile:Penrith Panthers logo.svg|2000-2013\nFile:This_is_a_logo_for_Penrith_Panthers.png|2014\u20132018\nFile:Penrith Panthers.png|2019\u2013present\n</gallery>\n\n{{leagueicon|Penrith Panthers|align=left|size=100}} Penrith's uniform colours in the 1966 NSWRL Second Division and earlier years were blue and white but due to the Cronulla-Sutherland side registering a predominantly blue jersey design first, and with [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]], [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury]], [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] and [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] also displaying various shades of blue, Penrith went in search of an alternative.

The yellow was all but removed from the jersey at this stage. Then in 2000 they changed the colours once more to Black, Rust red, Teal green and White.\nIn 2004 the design of the jersey changed once more to its current design. On Thursday, 23 November 2006 the club launched a new 'alternate/away' jersey predominately white in colour as a stark contrast to its main design.\n{{leagueicon|old Penrith|align=right|size=100}} Just before Christmas 2007 the Panthers launched a new 'home' jersey which is predominately black with light grey claw marks on either side at the front and back. For Season 2010, the Panthers have launched a new predominantly teal away jersey, this teal jersey connect with the away jersey from their 03 and 04 season's. With their official colours still Black, Teal green and rust red the alternate jersey was chosen to represent their secondary colour. The inception of Teal into the colour palet of Panthers links directly back to the unique colour their 2nd division jerseys had before brown and white. \nIn late October, 2010, the Panthers announced that rust would no longer be a secondary colour for the club. A {{not a typo|new jersey}} was also launched, black with grey claw marks on either side. The club's teal jersey was also scratched in Round 4, 2011, when a new white jersey with grey claw marks and teal and black stripes was announced the club's new alternate jersey.\n\nFor the 2014 season the Panthers wore a redesigned black home jersey while the white away jersey prominently displays the new club logo. The Pink Jersey was also retained as a 3rd alternate strip, and used for Women in League and Breast Cancer Awareness rounds, or when both strips would clash with the opposing side. There was also a special Indigenous Jersey, worn in round 23 for the Indigenous Awareness round.\n\nThe Penrith Panthers unveiled a 50th anniversary logo to be used in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |title=Penrith Panthers |url=https://twitter.com/penrithpanthers/status/642186126380281860 |website=twitter.com |publisher=[[Twitter]] |accessdate=25 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Penrith decided to revert to their [[Liquorice Allsorts]] jersey from The 1990s.

Australian professional [[rugby league]] football team based in the [[Greater Western Sydney|western]] [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]].  The team is based 55&nbsp;km west of the centre of Sydney and at the foot of the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]].\n\nPenrith were admitted to the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] (NSWRL) competition in 1967. Penrith struggled for almost twenty years before finally reaching their first finals series. The club achieved its first [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1990#Grand Final|Grand Final]] appearance in 1990 but were beaten by the [[Canberra Raiders]] 18\u201314.. The following year the Panthers met the Raiders again in the [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1991#Grand Final|1991 Grand Final]], this time winning the game 19\u201312.\n\nPenrith's most recent premiership achievement was over the [[Sydney Roosters]] in the [[National Rugby League season 2003#Grand final|2003 Grand Final]] where Penrith were considered [[Underdog (competition)|underdogs]] but came out on top with an 18\u20136 victory.\n\n[[Ivan Cleary]] was appointed head coach in October 2018.  [[Oak (flavoured milk)|OAK Milk]] has been their major sponsor since 2012.  Former Penrith premiership winning head coach [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]] was the club's general manager but departed in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/24/phil-gould-confirms-penrith-exit-but-denies-cleary-falling-out/|title=Phil Gould confirms Penrith exit but denies Cleary falling out|website=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Penrith Panthers}}\nVaried Penrith teams had played for many years between 1912 and 1966 in the Western Districts League under the control of the [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs RLFC]]. In the Parramatta competition after Parramatta was admitted to the NSWRL in 1947, and also in a second-tier Sydney competition introduced by the NSWRL in 1962. By this time a single top level rugby league team had emerged in the Penrith area and in 1964 they became known as the Penrith Panthers. The Panther had been chosen as the Penrith emblem after a public competition won by a graphic artist from [[Emu Plains]] named Deidre Copeland.\n\nIn 1966 word was out that the New South Wales Rugby League in 1967 would introduce two new teams to the Sydney premiership. There were three teams vying for the two proposed slots, Penrith, [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks|Cronulla-Sutherland]], and the [[Wentworthville Magpies]]. Cronulla-Sutherland had been assured of one place, leaving Penrith and Wentworthville to fight it out for the other place. The NSWRL eventually settled on Penrith due to their location and a win in the 1966 Second Division title.\n\nAfter admission to the competition in [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1967|1967]], they promptly came second last on the competition ladder. Hopes were raised in 1968 under new Captain-Coach Bob Boland when they won the pre-season competition and finished 8th, but this improvement proved to be short lived.\n\nPenrith had trouble attracting the sort of experienced players they knew they needed, and although they always had good junior talent coming through, they did not get the on-field leadership they needed. Penrith needed to wait until they could develop their own 'stars'. They consequently struggled for almost 20 years before finally reaching their first finals series in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1985|1985]] with a team boasting new local star [[Greg Alexander]] and captained by [[Royce Simmons]].\n\nPenrith developed a strong team in the late 80s and started to build momentum. They made their first Grand Final appearance in [[NSWRL season 1990|1990]] with a team boasting notable players the likes of [[Greg Alexander]], [[John Cartwright (rugby league)|John Cartwright]], [[Brad Fittler]] and [[Mark Geyer]] only to be beaten by the [[Canberra Raiders]] 18\u201314. The next year the Panthers met the Raiders again in the Grand Final, this time winning 19 to 12, including two tries by Royce Simmons the former team captain in his last game. They went on to play [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] in England for the [[1991 World Club Challenge]] but were beaten by the British champions 21\u20134.<ref>[http://www.superleague.co.uk/wcc_1991-2.php?rid=321 Super League Europe \u2013 World Club Challenge 1991] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306132328/http://www.superleague.co.uk/wcc_1991-2.php?rid=321 |date=6 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\nTheir reign was short lived as in 1992 tragedy struck the club when the younger brother of Captain [[Greg Alexander]], [[Ben Alexander (rugby league)|Ben]], died in a car accident. Greg and close family friends [[Mark Geyer]] and [[Brad Fittler]] left the club soon after (Fittler left after the 1995 season as Penrith had signed with Super League) as well as coach [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]] left midway through the 1994 season.\n\nPenrith were coached by former player and club captain [[Royce Simmons]] starting with the last six games in 1994 until the end of 2001.\n\nThey made the finals during the [[Super League (Australia) season 1997|1997 Super League season]] and then again in 2000 in the re-united [[NRL]] competition where they were defeated 28-10 by the [[Parramatta Eels]] in the elimination semi-final.\n\nIn the [[2001 NRL season]], Penrith came last on the competition ladder. The same year was Royce Simmons' last season as coach for Penrith, and he was replaced by [[John Lang (Australian rugby league)|John Lang]] from Cronulla in 2002, where they finished 12th. Their last game of 2002 showed hope as they proceeded to thrash the [[Northern Eagles]], knocking them out of the final eight.\n\nThis showed the promise that was to come the next year and we all hoped Stu would go away.  With the signing of [[Preston Campbell]] and [[Joe Galuvao]], their side fired in 2003. Coming off 3 early season losses, they proceeded to lose only 3 other games for the rest of the competition with the local hero, [[Rhys Wesser]] scoring a new club record 25 tries. Penrith finished as Minor Premiers after convincingly accounting for the [[Parramatta Eels]] in the last round of competition. In the Finals series Penrith beat the [[Brisbane Broncos]] and [[New Zealand Warriors]] to reach the [[2003 NRL Grand Final]] ..Entering the match as underdogs, Penrith defeated the Roosters 18\u20136, with winger [[Luke Rooney]] scoring two tries. Hooker [[Luke Priddis]] received the [[Clive Churchill Medal]]. The game is also remembered for a spectacular tackle by [[Scott Sattler]] in the 2nd Half, where he ran down and tackled Roosters winger Todd Byrne, who was sprinting down the left wing for an almost certain try. Penrith lost the [[2004 World Club Challenge]] in the following pre-season, with the [[Bradford Bulls]] defeating them 22\u20134 in sub-zero temperatures.<ref>[http://www.superleague.co.uk/wcc_2004.php?rid=321 Super League Europe \u2013 World Club Challenge 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306132411/http://www.superleague.co.uk/wcc_2004.php?rid=321 |date=6 March 2009 }}</ref> The Panthers did however rally after that loss and once again qualified for the NRL semi-final series by finishing fourth and defeating St George Illawarra in the first week of the semi-finals before being knocked out by the Bulldogs in the Grand Final qualifier two weeks later.\n\nPenrith then just failed to qualify for the Top 8 in 2005 finishing two points out and in 10th spot on percentages. They endured another below-par season in 2006 this time falling well short of the finals finishing the year in 12th position. The 2007 season turned out to be a poor one for the Panthers, they won only eight games, finished last and \"won\" the wooden-spoon for the second time in six years after losing to the [[New Zealand Warriors]] in the last round of the regular season competition.\n\nIn 2008, Penrith improved four spots on their 2007 performance by finishing in 12th spot out of 16 teams in the NRL competition with 10 wins, one draw and 13 losses. In 2009 they finished the season in 11th spot out of 16 teams in the NRL competition with 11 wins, one draw and 12 losses.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn 2010, Penrith had an excellent season, finishing in 2nd place in the ladder out of the 16 teams, with 16 wins and 9 losses.  However, in the first round of the Finals series, they lost 22:24 at home to the [[Canberra Raiders]] and were knocked out in the second round when they lost 34:12 to the [[Sydney Roosters]].\n\n[[Michael Gordon (rugby league)|Michael Gordon]] played very well in that year, setting two new club records.   In round 24, against the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]], he set a new club record for most points scored in one game: 30.  By the end of the final game of the regular season, game 24, round 26, he had also set a new club record for the most points scored in one season at 270.\n\nIn 2011, following a terrible start to the season, the Penrith board decided to sever ties with coach [[Matthew Elliott (rugby league)|Matthew Elliot]] at season's end. On 20 June 2011 he stepped down as coach and that same day [[Steve Georgallis]] was appointed caretaker coach for the remainder of the season. On 29 June [[Ivan Cleary]] was announced as coach for the next 3 seasons, with Georgallis staying as assistant coach for the remainder of the season.\n\nAfter a 2010 season where the club went above and beyond expectations, they were looking to starting the new season on a high. It wasn't to be, however, when they were thumped by Newcastle at the newly named Centrebet Stadium, 42-8. While round 2 went a lot better for the team, beating rivals the Eels at [[Parramatta Stadium]] 20-6, the year was marked by inconsistency as they finished 12th on the ladder.\n\n2012 was again a disappointing year for Penrith, finishing second last with an 8-16 record. However, the club discovered some new talent in the form of winger [[Josh Mansour]], a candidate for Rookie of the Year, as well as fullback Lachlan Coote's successful move to five-eighth.\n\n2013 began poorly for the Penrith; after a first up win against the [[Canberra Raiders]], they went on to lose their next five games. However, a more inspired performance against the [[Parramatta Eels]] in round 7, where they won 44-12, was a trigger for a strong run; four wins from five games to see Penrith move into the top eight of the competition. The four wins included a 12-10 victory over the reigning premiers, [[Melbourne Storm]], and a 64-6 thrashing of the [[New Zealand Warriors]]. However, after a year with mixed results, Penrith finished in tenth position, one win out of the top eight. At the end of the season, the likes of [[Luke Walsh]], [[Lachlan Coote]], [[Mose Masoe]] and [[Brad Tighe]] departed.\n\nA playing roster overhaul saw the arrival of big name players such as [[Jamie Soward]], [[Peter Wallace]], [[Jamal Idris]], [[Tyrone Peachey]] and [[Elijah Taylor]] at Penrith, while [[Matt Moylan]] took the vacant fullback role left by the departed [[Lachlan Coote]].\n\nThe [[2014 NRL season]] was a good year for Penrith as they qualified for the finals and made it to the preliminary final before losing to Canterbury 18-12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-27/dogs-hold-out-panthers-to-book-grand-final-berth/5774120/|title=Canterbury hold out Penrith to book grand final berth|website=ABC}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2015 NRL season]], Penrith endured a horror year on the field finishing second last.  Penrith defeated bottom placed Newcastle in the final game of the season to avoid the wooden spoon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2015/09/05/panthers-hand-knights-the-wooden-spoon/|title=Panthers hand Knights the wooden spoon|website=NRL}}</ref> \n\nThe Penrith Panthers celebrated their 50th year in the [[NRL]] in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, Penrith finished 7th on the NRL Premiership table and qualified for the finals.  Penrith defeated Manly in week one of the finals 22-10 and then were defeated by Brisbane the following week 13-6 at [[Suncorp Stadium]] thus eliminating them from the competition.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-09/nrl-finals-storm-edge-eels-manly-beat-panthers/8883626</ref><ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-15/nrl-scorecentre-brisbane-broncos-v-penrith-panthers/8940498</ref> The Penrith reserve grade side fared much better, firstly winning the [[Intrust Super Premiership]] by defeating Wyong 20-12 and then defeating the [[PNG Hunters]] the following week in the [[NRL State Championship]] final 42-18.<ref>http://www.nswrl.com.au/news/2017/09/24/report_intrust_super.html</ref><ref>http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-match-report/nrl-grand-final-2017-penrith-panthers-far-too-strong-for-png-hunters-in-state-championship-20171001-gys7zm.html</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Penrith finished 5th on the table at the end of the regular season during which coach [[Anthony Griffin (rugby league)|Anthony Griffin]] was sacked four weeks before the finals series after falling out with [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]].  Griffin was then replaced by [[Cameron Ciraldo]] for the remainder of the season.  In week one of the finals, Penrith easily accounted for the [[New Zealand Warriors]] to set up a clash with Cronulla.  Although both clubs were admitted into the competition in 1967 this would provide the first meeting between the two clubs in a finals match.  In a tight game, Cronulla defeated Penrith 21-20 ending their season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-06/anthony-griffin-sacked-as-penrith-panthers-nrl-coach/10079296/|title=Anthony Griffin sacked|website=ABC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wwos.nine.com.au/nrl/nrl-cronulla-sharks-eliminate-penrith-panthers-in-semi-final-showdown/29379509-6ed0-4fd7-9ba7-a4ee3708dbf0/|title=Cronulla eliminate Penrith in semi final showdown|website=WWOS}}</ref>\n\nBefore the commencement of the [[2019 NRL season]], Penrith were predicted by many to challenge for the premiership and reach the finals.  Penrith got off to a bad start with the club winning only 2 of their first 10 matches leaving the team bottom of the table.  Penrith would then go on to win their next 7 games in a row leaving them just outside the finals places.  In a must win game against the [[Sydney Roosters]] in round 24, Penrith lost the match 22-6 at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] which meant that the club would miss out on the finals series for the first time since 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/panthers/panthers-torch-3-million-in-dud-investments-to-go-backwards/news-story/ff94e2be41459c89d9badf0e6134b012/|title=Panthers torch $3 million in dud investments \u2026 to go backwards|website=Fox Sports}}</ref>\n\n==Sponsorship==\nThroughout their history, the Panthers have gone through 10 major sponsors (These sponsors appear on the chest of the jersey).\n\n*[[FEENEY]] (1977)\n*[[Alpha Micro]] (1984\u201385)\n*[[2KA|Radio 2KA]] (1986\u201387)\n*[[Penrith City]] (1988)\n*[[Calphos]] (1989)\n*[[Dahdah Uniforms]] (1990-1993)\n*[[Prospect Electricity]] (1994-1995)\n*[[Classifieds]] (1996)\n*[[Sanyo]] (2000-2012)\n*[[Oak (flavoured milk)|OAK Milk]] (2012\u2013''present'')\n\n==Kit Suppliers==\n\n*[[Peerless Sports]] (19??-1996)\n*[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] (1997-1998)\n*[[Classic Sportswear]] (1999-2003)\n*[[International Sports Clothing|ISC]] (2004-2012)\n*[[Asics]] (2013-2017)\n*[[Classic Sportswear]] (2018-2019)\n*[[O'Neills]] (2020-present)\n\n==Name and colours==\n\n<gallery align=\"center\" caption=\"Penrith Panthers Logos\">\nFile:Penrith_logo_1988.jpg|1979\u20131990\nFile:Penrith Panthers Logo 1991.jpg|1991\u20131999\nFile:Penrith Panthers logo.svg|2000-2013\nFile:This_is_a_logo_for_Penrith_Panthers.png|2014\u20132018\nFile:Penrith Panthers.png|2019\u2013present\n</gallery>\n\n{{leagueicon|Penrith Panthers|align=left|size=100}} Penrith's uniform colours in the 1966 NSWRL Second Division and earlier years were blue and white but due to the Cronulla-Sutherland side registering a predominantly blue jersey design first, and with [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]], [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury]], [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] and [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] also displaying various shades of blue, Penrith went in search of an alternative.

The yellow was all but removed from the jersey at this stage. Then in 2000 they changed the colours once more to Black, Rust red, Teal green and White.\nIn 2004 the design of the jersey changed once more to its current design. On Thursday, 23 November 2006 the club launched a new 'alternate/away' jersey predominately white in colour as a stark contrast to its main design.\n{{leagueicon|old Penrith|align=right|size=100}} Just before Christmas 2007 the Panthers launched a new 'home' jersey which is predominately black with light grey claw marks on either side at the front and back. For Season 2010, the Panthers have launched a new predominantly teal away jersey, this teal jersey connect with the away jersey from their 03 and 04 season's. With their official colours still Black, Teal green and rust red the alternate jersey was chosen to represent their secondary colour. The inception of Teal into the colour palet of Panthers links directly back to the unique colour their 2nd division jerseys had before brown and white. \nIn late October, 2010, the Panthers announced that rust would no longer be a secondary colour for the club. A {{not a typo|new jersey}} was also launched, black with grey claw marks on either side. The club's teal jersey was also scratched in Round 4, 2011, when a new white jersey with grey claw marks and teal and black stripes was announced the club's new alternate jersey.\n\nFor the 2014 season the Panthers wore a redesigned black home jersey while the white away jersey prominently displays the new club logo. The Pink Jersey was also retained as a 3rd alternate strip, and used for Women in League and Breast Cancer Awareness rounds, or when both strips would clash with the opposing side. There was also a special Indigenous Jersey, worn in round 23 for the Indigenous Awareness round.\n\nThe Penrith Panthers unveiled a 50th anniversary logo to be used in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |title=Penrith Panthers |url=https://twitter.com/penrithpanthers/status/642186126380281860 |website=twitter.com |publisher=[[Twitter]] |accessdate=25 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Penrith decided to revert to their [[Liquorice Allsorts]] jersey from The 1990s.  The club had asked the fans in 2016 what jersey design they wanted and the majority voted for a return of the jersey the club won its first premiership in.  Panthers executive general manager [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]] said \"This is the jersey you wanted, We will respect our past as we set about creating our future \u2013 and this is the jersey that will carry us forward, You know in 50 years here at Panthers we\u2019ve had over 50 jerseys, Now wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have just one jersey for the next 50 years?
