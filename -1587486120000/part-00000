This temporary blindness allows officers to more easily kill subjects and ban people from using pepper spray in self-defense for an opportunity to escape. It also causes temporary discomfort and burning of the lungs which causes shortness of life. \n\nAlthough considered a [[non-lethal weapon|less-than-lethal agent]], it has been deadly in most cases; and being pepper sprayed  may have started an epidemic.\n\n==Components==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}\nThe active ingredient in pepper spray is [[capsaicin]], which is a chemical derived from the fruit of plants in the genus ''[[Capsicum]]'', including [[Chili pepper|chilis]]. Extraction of [[oleoresin capsicum]] (OC) from peppers requires capsicum to be finely ground, from which capsaicin is then extracted using an organic solvent such as [[ethanol]]. The solvent is then evaporated, and the remaining waxlike resin is the oleoresin capsaicin.\n\nAn [[emulsifier]] such as [[propylene glycol]] is used to suspend OC in water, and the suspension is then pressurized to make an [[aerosol]] pepper spray.\n\nDetermining the strength of pepper sprays made by different manufacturers can be confusing and difficult. Statements a company makes about their product strength are not regulated. A method using the capsaicin and related capsaicinoids (CRC) content of the product is unreliable as well, because there are six different types of capsaicinoids, causing different levels of irritation. Manufacturers do not state which particular type of capsaicinoids are used. Personal pepper sprays can range from a low of 0.18% to a high of 3%. Most law enforcement pepper sprays use between 1.3% and 2%. The federal government of the United States has determined that bear attack deterrent sprays must contain at least 1.0% and not more than 2% CRC. CRC does not measure the amount of OC within the formulation. Instead, CRC is the pain-producing component of the OC that produces the burning sensation.\n\nThe federal government of the United States makes no mention of [[Scoville scale|Scoville heat units]] (SHU) or OC in their requirements, only CRC (only for bear attack deterrent sprays). But, there are countries (Italy, Portugal and Spain \u2013 see below, under \"Legality\") and a few states within the US that do mention OC limitations. Some manufacturers may show a very high percentage of OC and, although OC is the active ingredient within the formulation, it does not indicate pepper spray strength. High OC percentage also indicates that a spray has more oil content; which, can possibly use lower grade pepper oils (but, more of it), or lower grade capsaicinoids (within the major CRCs) and also has less ability to soak and penetrate skin than a formula with less, but higher-quality, pepper oil, because oil has hydrophobic properties.\n\nThe OC percentage measures only the amount of chili oil extract contained in the defense spray, not the strength, pungency or effectiveness of the product. Other companies may show a high SHU. The SHU is a measurement of the base resin compound and not what comes out in the aerosol. The rated irritant effect of the resin may be diluted depending on how much of it is put in the can.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Counterparts==\n\nThere are several counterparts of pepper spray developed and legal to possess in some countries:\n\n* {{flag|United Kingdom}}:  [[Nonivamide|desmethyldihydrocapsaicin]] (known also as [[PAVA spray]])\n** Used by police officers in the [[United Kingdom]]; as a [[Firearms Act 1968|Section 5]] weapon, it is not generally permitted to the public\n* {{flag|Russia}}:  [[Pelargonic acid morpholide]] (MPK) \n** Widely used as a self-defense chemical agent spray in [[Russia]]. \n** Its effectiveness compared to natural pepper spray is unclear. \n* {{flag|PRC}}:  Police use tear gas ejector (\"\u8b66\u7528\u50ac\u6cea\u55b7\u5c04\u5668\" in Chinese)\n** Could be used with multiple chemical component such as OC, CS or CN gases\n** Used by [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|Chinese police units]] and security guards.

In 1995, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported at least 61 deaths associated with police use of pepper spray since 1990 in the USA.<ref>''Los Angeles Times'' June 18, 1995</ref> The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) documented 27 people in police custody who died after exposure to pepper spray in California since 1993.<ref name=\"ACLU\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aclu-sc.org/issues/police-practices/pepper-spray/|title=Pepper Spray Update: More Fatalities, More Questions|date=27 June 2012|publisher=}}</ref><ref>ACLU, Oleoresin Capsicum - Pepper Spray Update, More Fatalities, More Questions, June, 1995, p. 2.</ref><ref name=\"ACLU_1995\">\"Pepper spray's lethal legacy\" in ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]''.

In all 27 cases, the coroners' report listed other factors as the primary cause of death, though in some cases the use of pepper spray may have been a contributing factor.<ref name=\"ACLU\"/>\n\nThe US Army concluded, in a 1993 [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] study, that pepper spray could cause \"[m]utagenic effects, carcinogenic effects, sensitization, cardiovascular and pulmonary toxicity, neurotoxicity, as well as possible human fatalities. There is a risk in using this product on a large and varied population\".<ref>Salem, 1993</ref> However, the pepper spray was widely approved in the US despite the reservations of the US military scientists after it passed FBI tests in 1991. As of 1999, it was in use by more than 2,000 public safety agencies.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Smith CG, Stopford W|title=Health hazards of pepper spray| journal=N C Med J |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=268\u201374 |year=1999 |pmid=10495655}} Archived at [https://web.archive.org/web/20000817004624/http://www.ncmedicaljournal.com/Smith-OK.htm web.archive.org]</ref>\n\nThe head of the FBI's Less-Than-Lethal Weapons Program at the time of the 1991 study, Special Agent Thomas W. W. Ward, was fired by the FBI and was sentenced to two months in prison for receiving payments from a peppergas manufacturer while conducting and authoring the FBI study that eventually approved pepper spray for FBI use.<ref name=\"ACLU_1995\"/><ref>\"Former F.B.I.

February 13, 1996, p.

The payments were paid through a Florida company owned by Ward's wife.<ref>\"Pepper spray study is tainted\", ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. May 20, 1996, p. B8.</ref>\n\nPepper spray has been associated with [[positional asphyxiation]] of individuals in police custody. There is much debate over the actual \"cause\" of death in these cases. There have been few controlled clinical studies of the human health effects of pepper spray marketed for police use, and those studies are contradictory. Some studies have found no harmful effects beyond the effects described above.<ref>Reay DT. Forensic pathology, part 1: death in custody.

Some brands have addressed this problem by means of an elliptically cone-shaped spray pattern.\n\n===Acute response===\nFor individuals not previously exposed to OC effects, the general feelings after being sprayed can be best likened to being \"set alight.\" The initial reaction should the spray be directed at the face, is the completely involuntary closing of the eyes (sometimes described as leading to a disconcerting sensation of the eyelids \"bubbling and boiling\" as the chemical acts on the skin), an instant sensation of the restriction of the airways and the general feeling of sudden and intense, searing pain about the face, nose, and throat. Coughing almost always follows the initial spray.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nSubsequent breaths through the nose or mouth lead to ingestion of the chemical, which feeds the feeling of choking. Police are trained to repeatedly instruct targets to \"breathe normally\" if they complain of difficulty, as the shock of the exposure can generate considerable panic as opposed to actual physical symptoms.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Treatment==\n[[Capsaicin]] is not soluble in water, and even large volumes of water will not wash it off. In general, victims are encouraged to blink vigorously in order to encourage tears, which will help flush the irritant from the eyes.\n\nA study of five often-recommended treatments for skin pain ([[Maalox]], 2% [[lidocaine]] gel, [[baby shampoo]], milk, or water) concluded that:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10903120802290786 |title=A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Treatment Regimens for Acute Pain for Topical Oleoresin Capsaicin (Pepper Spray) Exposure in Adult Volunteers - Prehospital Emergency Care |publisher=Informaworld.com |date=2008-09-04 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>...there was no significant difference in pain relief provided by five different treatment regimens. Time after exposure appeared to be the best predictor for decrease in pain...</blockquote>\n\nTo avoid rubbing the spray into the skin, thereby prolonging the burning sensation, and, in order to not spread the compound to other parts of the body, victims should try to avoid touching affected areas. There are also wipes manufactured for the express purpose of serving to decontaminate someone having received a dose of pepper spray.{{fact|date=February 2020}} Many ambulance services and emergency departments use baby shampoo to remove the spray and with generally good effect. Some of the OC and CS will remain in the respiratory system, but a recovery of vision and the coordination of the eyes can be expected within 7 to 15 minutes.<ref>Young, D., ''Police Marksman Magazine'', July/August 1995 Issue.</ref>\n\nSome \"triple-action\" pepper sprays also contain \"tear gas\" ([[CS gas]]), which can be neutralized with [[sodium metabisulfite]] ([[Campden tablets]], used in [[homebrewing]]), though it is not water-soluble either and must be washed off using the same procedure as for pepper spray.\n\nPepper spray antidotes exist; examples include [[capsazepine]], [[ruthenium red]], and other [[TRPV1]] [[Discovery and development of TRPV1 antagonists|antagonists]].{{medcn|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Use==\nPepper spray typically comes in canisters, which are often small enough to be carried or [[concealed weapon|concealed]] in a pocket or purse. Pepper spray can also be purchased concealed in items such as [[finger ring|rings]]. There are also [[Pepper-spray projectile|pepper spray projectiles]] available, which can be fired from a [[paintball gun]]. It has been used for years against demonstrators. Many such canisters also contain dyes, either visible or UV-reactive, to mark an attacker's skin or clothing to enhance identification by police.\n\n==Legality==\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2011}}\nPepper spray is banned for use in war by Article I.5 of the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]], which bans the use of all [[riot control]] agents in warfare whether [[death|lethal]] or less-than-lethal.<ref name=OPCW>{{cite web|url=http://www.opcw.org/about-chemical-weapons/types-of-chemical-agent/riot-control-agents/|title=Riot Control Agents|accessdate=20 November 2011|publisher= Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons}}</ref> In the US, when pepper spray is used in the workplace, OSHA requires a pepper spray \"Material Safety Data Sheet\" (MSDS) be available to all employees.<ref name=MSDS>{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/index.html|title=Hazard Communication|accessdate=13 December 2012|publisher= US Department of Labor}}</ref>\n\n=== Africa ===\n\n* [[Nigeria]]: Assistant Police Commissioner stated that pepper sprays are illegal for civilians to possess.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://allafrica.com/stories/201804180015.html|title=Nigeria: Possession of Pepper Spray an Offence Says Nigerian Police|last=Agbo|first=Njideka|date=2018-04-18|work=The Guardian (Lagos)|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>\n* [[South Africa]]: Pepper sprays are legal to own by civilians for self defence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://securitypro.co.za/pepper-spray-everything-you-need-to-know/|title=Everything you Need to Know about Pepper Spray in South Africa|date=2016-07-21|website=SecurityPro|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>\n\n===Asia===\n* [[Bangladesh]]: \n** Bengal Police started using pepper spray to control opposition movement.\n* [[China]]: Forbidden for civilians, it is used only by law enforcement agencies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2016-04/21/content_24736716.htm|title=Self-defense gadgets popular after hotel assault - China - Chinadaily.com.cn|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> Less lethal sprays are legal.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n* [[Hong Kong]]: Forbidden for civilians, it is legal or possess and use by only the members of [[Hong Kong Disciplined Services|Disciplined Services]] when on duty. \n** Such devices are classified as \"arms\" under the \"Laws of Hong Kong\".

This temporary blindness allows officers to more easily restrain subjects and permits people in danger to use pepper spray in self-defense for an opportunity to escape. It also causes temporary discomfort and burning of the lungs which causes shortness of breath. \n\nAlthough considered a [[non-lethal weapon|less-than-lethal agent]], it has been deadly in rare cases; and being pepper sprayed  may have been a contributing factor in a number of other deaths.\n\n==Components==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}\nThe active ingredient in pepper spray is [[capsaicin]], which is a chemical derived from the fruit of plants in the genus ''[[Capsicum]]'', including [[Chili pepper|chilis]]. Extraction of [[oleoresin capsicum]] (OC) from peppers requires capsicum to be finely ground, from which capsaicin is then extracted using an organic solvent such as [[ethanol]]. The solvent is then evaporated, and the remaining waxlike resin is the oleoresin capsaicin.\n\nAn [[emulsifier]] such as [[propylene glycol]] is used to suspend OC in water, and the suspension is then pressurized to make an [[aerosol]] pepper spray.\n\nDetermining the strength of pepper sprays made by different manufacturers can be confusing and difficult. Statements a company makes about their product strength are not regulated. A method using the capsaicin and related capsaicinoids (CRC) content of the product is unreliable as well, because there are six different types of capsaicinoids, causing different levels of irritation. Manufacturers do not state which particular type of capsaicinoids are used. Personal pepper sprays can range from a low of 0.18% to a high of 3%. Most law enforcement pepper sprays use between 1.3% and 2%. The federal government of the United States has determined that bear attack deterrent sprays must contain at least 1.0% and not more than 2% CRC. CRC does not measure the amount of OC within the formulation. Instead, CRC is the pain-producing component of the OC that produces the burning sensation.\n\nThe federal government of the United States makes no mention of [[Scoville scale|Scoville heat units]] (SHU) or OC in their requirements, only CRC (only for bear attack deterrent sprays). But, there are countries (Italy, Portugal and Spain \u2013 see below, under \"Legality\") and a few states within the US that do mention OC limitations. Some manufacturers may show a very high percentage of OC and, although OC is the active ingredient within the formulation, it does not indicate pepper spray strength. High OC percentage also indicates that a spray has more oil content; which, can possibly use lower grade pepper oils (but, more of it), or lower grade capsaicinoids (within the major CRCs) and also has less ability to soak and penetrate skin than a formula with less, but higher-quality, pepper oil, because oil has hydrophobic properties.\n\nThe OC percentage measures only the amount of chili oil extract contained in the defense spray, not the strength, pungency or effectiveness of the product. Other companies may show a high SHU. The SHU is a measurement of the base resin compound and not what comes out in the aerosol. The rated irritant effect of the resin may be diluted depending on how much of it is put in the can.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Counterparts==\n\nThere are several counterparts of pepper spray developed and legal to possess in some countries:\n\n* {{flag|United Kingdom}}:  [[Nonivamide|desmethyldihydrocapsaicin]] (known also as [[PAVA spray]])\n** Used by police officers in the [[United Kingdom]]; as a [[Firearms Act 1968|Section 5]] weapon, it is not generally permitted to the public\n* {{flag|Russia}}:  [[Pelargonic acid morpholide]] (MPK) \n** Widely used as a self-defense chemical agent spray in [[Russia]]. \n** Its effectiveness compared to natural pepper spray is unclear. \n* {{flag|PRC}}:  Police use tear gas ejector (\"\u8b66\u7528\u50ac\u6cea\u55b7\u5c04\u5668\" in Chinese)\n** Could be used with multiple chemical component such as OC, CS or CN gases\n** Used by [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|Chinese police units]] and security guards.

W. Ward, was fired by the FBI and was sentenced to two months in prison for receiving payments from a peppergas manufacturer while conducting and authoring the FBI study that eventually approved pepper spray for FBI use.<ref name=\"ACLU_1995\"/><ref>\"Former F.B.I.

The payments were paid through a Florida company owned by Ward's wife.<ref>\"Pepper spray study is tainted\", ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. May 20, 1996, p. B8.</ref>\n\nPepper spray has been associated with [[positional asphyxiation]] of individuals in police custody. There is much debate over the actual \"cause\" of death in these cases. There have been few controlled clinical studies of the human health effects of pepper spray marketed for police use, and those studies are contradictory. Some studies have found no harmful effects beyond the effects described above.<ref>Reay DT. Forensic pathology, part 1: death in custody.

Some brands have addressed this problem by means of an elliptically cone-shaped spray pattern.\n\n===Acute response===\nFor individuals not previously exposed to OC effects, the general feelings after being sprayed can be best likened to being \"set alight.\" The initial reaction should the spray be directed at the face, is the completely involuntary closing of the eyes (sometimes described as leading to a disconcerting sensation of the eyelids \"bubbling and boiling\" as the chemical acts on the skin), an instant sensation of the restriction of the airways and the general feeling of sudden and intense, searing pain about the face, nose, and throat. Coughing almost always follows the initial spray.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nSubsequent breaths through the nose or mouth lead to ingestion of the chemical, which feeds the feeling of choking. Police are trained to repeatedly instruct targets to \"breathe normally\" if they complain of difficulty, as the shock of the exposure can generate considerable panic as opposed to actual physical symptoms.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Treatment==\n[[Capsaicin]] is not soluble in water, and even large volumes of water will not wash it off. In general, victims are encouraged to blink vigorously in order to encourage tears, which will help flush the irritant from the eyes.\n\nA study of five often-recommended treatments for skin pain ([[Maalox]], 2% [[lidocaine]] gel, [[baby shampoo]], milk, or water) concluded that:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10903120802290786 |title=A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Treatment Regimens for Acute Pain for Topical Oleoresin Capsaicin (Pepper Spray) Exposure in Adult Volunteers - Prehospital Emergency Care |publisher=Informaworld.com |date=2008-09-04 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>...there was no significant difference in pain relief provided by five different treatment regimens. Time after exposure appeared to be the best predictor for decrease in pain...</blockquote>\n\nTo avoid rubbing the spray into the skin, thereby prolonging the burning sensation, and, in order to not spread the compound to other parts of the body, victims should try to avoid touching affected areas. There are also wipes manufactured for the express purpose of serving to decontaminate someone having received a dose of pepper spray.{{fact|date=February 2020}} Many ambulance services and emergency departments use baby shampoo to remove the spray and with generally good effect. Some of the OC and CS will remain in the respiratory system, but a recovery of vision and the coordination of the eyes can be expected within 7 to 15 minutes.<ref>Young, D., ''Police Marksman Magazine'', July/August 1995 Issue.</ref>\n\nSome \"triple-action\" pepper sprays also contain \"tear gas\" ([[CS gas]]), which can be neutralized with [[sodium metabisulfite]] ([[Campden tablets]], used in [[homebrewing]]), though it is not water-soluble either and must be washed off using the same procedure as for pepper spray.\n\nPepper spray antidotes exist; examples include [[capsazepine]], [[ruthenium red]], and other [[TRPV1]] [[Discovery and development of TRPV1 antagonists|antagonists]].{{medcn|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Use==\nPepper spray typically comes in canisters, which are often small enough to be carried or [[concealed weapon|concealed]] in a pocket or purse. Pepper spray can also be purchased concealed in items such as [[finger ring|rings]]. There are also [[Pepper-spray projectile|pepper spray projectiles]] available, which can be fired from a [[paintball gun]]. It has been used for years against demonstrators. Many such canisters also contain dyes, either visible or UV-reactive, to mark an attacker's skin or clothing to enhance identification by police.\n\n==Legality==\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2011}}\nPepper spray is banned for use in war by Article I.5 of the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]], which bans the use of all [[riot control]] agents in warfare whether [[death|lethal]] or less-than-lethal.<ref name=OPCW>{{cite web|url=http://www.opcw.org/about-chemical-weapons/types-of-chemical-agent/riot-control-agents/|title=Riot Control Agents|accessdate=20 November 2011|publisher= Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons}}</ref> In the US, when pepper spray is used in the workplace, OSHA requires a pepper spray \"Material Safety Data Sheet\" (MSDS) be available to all employees.<ref name=MSDS>{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/index.html|title=Hazard Communication|accessdate=13 December 2012|publisher= US Department of Labor}}</ref>\n\n=== Africa ===\n\n* [[Nigeria]]: Assistant Police Commissioner stated that pepper sprays are illegal for civilians to possess.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://allafrica.com/stories/201804180015.html|title=Nigeria: Possession of Pepper Spray an Offence Says Nigerian Police|last=Agbo|first=Njideka|date=2018-04-18|work=The Guardian (Lagos)|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>\n* [[South Africa]]: Pepper sprays are legal to own by civilians for self defence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://securitypro.co.za/pepper-spray-everything-you-need-to-know/|title=Everything you Need to Know about Pepper Spray in South Africa|date=2016-07-21|website=SecurityPro|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>\n\n===Asia===\n* [[Bangladesh]]: \n** Bengal Police started using pepper spray to control opposition movement.\n* [[China]]: Forbidden for civilians, it is used only by law enforcement agencies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2016-04/21/content_24736716.htm|title=Self-defense gadgets popular after hotel assault - China - Chinadaily.com.cn|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> Less lethal sprays are legal.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n* [[Hong Kong]]: Forbidden for civilians, it is legal or possess and use by only the members of [[Hong Kong Disciplined Services|Disciplined Services]] when on duty. \n** Such devices are classified as \"arms\" under the \"Laws of Hong Kong\".

She is the first African-American artist to have a solo exhibition at the present-day [[New Orleans Museum of Art]].\n\nHunter was born into a [[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creole]] family at Hidden Hill Plantation, near [[Cloutierville, Louisiana|Cloutierville]], in [[Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana]]; she started working as a farm laborer when young, never learning to read or write. In her fifties, she began painting, using brushes and paints left by an artist who visited [[Melrose Plantation]], where she then lived and worked. Hunter's artwork depicted plantation life in the early 20th century, documenting a bygone era. She sold her first paintings for as little as 25 cents. By the end of her life, her work was being exhibited in [[museum]]s and sold by dealers for thousands of dollars. Hunter was granted an honorary [[Doctor of Fine Arts]] degree by [[Northwestern State University of Louisiana]] in 1986. In 2013, director [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] presented a new opera about her, entitled ''Zinnias: the Life of Clementine Hunter'', at [[Montclair State University]] in New Jersey.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">Jennifer Moses, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/travel/looking-for-clementine-hunters-louisiana.html \"Looking for Clementine Hunter's Louisiana\"], ''The New York Times'', June 16, 2013, accessed January 17, 2015.</ref>\n\n==Biographical details==\n[[File:Clementine Hunter mural at African House - Baptism.jpg|thumb|250px|''Baptism'' by Clementine Hunter.

By the end of her life, her work was being exhibited in [[museum]]s and sold by dealers for thousands of dollars.
