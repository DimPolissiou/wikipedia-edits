{"title_page": "James Isbister", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=October 2007}}\n'''James Isbister''' (November 29, 1833 \u2013 October 16, 1915) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] leader of the 19th&nbsp;century. Prominent among the [[Anglo-M\u00e9tis]] of the area, he is considered to be the founder of the city of [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan]].\n\n==Life==\nAn interpreter for the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] for many years, Isbister was talented linguistically, speaking [[English language|English]], [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]], [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Northern Athabaskan languages|Dene]] and [[Michif]].\n\nIsbister began [[farming]] in the summer of 1862 one mile east of the present day [[Federation|federal]] [[Prison|penitentiary]] at Prince Albert. The area he farmed is close to present day 17 Avenue and 14 Street West.  Isbister was probably the first man in what is now known as [[Saskatchewan]] to grow [[wheat]] on his own farm. He also worked on the John Smith Reserve (currently the [[Muskoday First Nation]]) as a farm instructor. By 1866, when Isbister moved a short distance away, several families were living in the district, which was known as [[Isbister's Settlement]].\n\nBy 1884, both settler and M\u00e9tis discontent was growing rapidly due to poor agricultural conditions and unresolved land issues in the [[Saskatchewan Valley]] region. As a community leader, Isbister was selected as one of the  four delegates (along with [[Gabriel Dumont (M\u00e9tis leader)|Gabriel Dumont]]) sent to recall [[Louis Riel]] from [[Montana]] to lead the people in seeking government action to address the situation. Local settlers' perception of government inaction culminated in the [[Northwest Rebellion]] of the following year (1885).\n\nLike most other Anglo-M\u00e9tis of the area, Isbister disassociated himself from the movement led by Riel when tensions ultimately erupted into violence. Despite this, he was denounced by the [[Conservatism in Canada|Conservative]] [[Publisher|press]] in Prince Albert.\n\nFollowing the Northwest Rebellion, Isbister was active in the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] in the Prince Albert area, and lived out his last days in that community. He is buried in the Anglican St. Mary's Cemetery just west of the Penitentiary not far from where he farmed initially.<ref>{{cite DCB |first=David |last=Smyth |title=Isbister, James |volume=14 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/isbister_james_14E.html}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Gabriel Dumont (M\u00e9tis leader)]]\n* [[James Nisbet]]\n* [[Lawrence Clarke (politician)|Lawrence Clarke]]\n* [[Thomas McKay (N.W.T. politician)]]\n* [[Louis Riel]]\n* [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan]]\n* [[North-West Rebellion]]\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n===Print===\n\n* Prince Albert: The First Century, Gary W.
