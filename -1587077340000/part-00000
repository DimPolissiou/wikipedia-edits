It is the [[county seat]] and largest city of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] in [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]]'s [[Wyoming Valley]] and hosts a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] building for the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania]]. With a population of 77,291, it is the largest city in the [[Scranton\u2013Wilkes-Barre\u2013Hazleton, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which has a population of about 570,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.com/scranton-wilkes-barre-pa-area.htm |title=Scranton, Wilkes, Barre Metro Area |publisher=Usa.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> The city is conventionally divided into 8 districts: North Scranton, Southside, Westside, the Hill Section, Central City, Minooka, East Mountain, and Green Ridge, though these areas do not have legal status.\n\nScranton is the geographic and cultural center of the [[Lackawanna River]] valley and Northeastern Pennsylvania, and the largest of the former [[anthracite coal]] mining communities in a contiguous quilt-work that also includes [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Nanticoke, Pennsylvania|Nanticoke]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], and [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania|Carbondale]]. Scranton was incorporated on February 14, 1856, as a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] in [[Luzerne County]] and as a [[city (Pennsylvania)|city]] on April 23, 1866. It became a major industrial city, a center of mining and railroads, and attracted thousands of new immigrants. It was the site of the [[Scranton General Strike]] in 1877.\n\nPeople in northern Luzerne County sought a new county in 1839 but the [[Wilkes-Barre]] area resisted losing its assets. Lackawanna County did not gain independent status until 1878. Under legislation allowing the issue to be voted by residents of the proposed territory, voters favored the new county by a proportion of 6 to 1, with Scranton residents providing the major support. The city was designated as the county seat when [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] was established in 1878, and a judicial district was authorized in July 1879.\n\nThe city's nickname \"Electric City\" began when electric lights were introduced in 1880 at the [[Dickson Manufacturing Company]]. Six years later, the United States's first [[streetcar]]s powered only by electricity began operating in the city.<ref>http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-39E</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/apps/historical-markers.html|title=Pennsylvania Historical Marker Search|website=www.phmc.state.pa.us}}</ref>{{dubious| the claim is widespread, but it simply means a single line was set up as electric.|date=May 2016}} Rev.

But while the national economy boomed after the war, demand for the region's coal declined as other forms of energy became more popular, which also harmed the rail industry. Foreseeing the decline, city leaders formulated the Scranton Plan in 1945 to diversify the local economy beyond coal, but the city's economy continued to decline. The [[Knox Mine disaster]] of 1959 essentially ended coal mining in the region. Scranton's population dropped from its peak of 143,000 in [[1930 United States Census|1930 census]] to 88,000 in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 census]]. The city's economy and population stabilized in the 1980s and 1990s. The city now has large health care and manufacturing sectors.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-industrial (1776\u20131845)===\nPresent-day Scranton and its surrounding area had been long inhabited by the native [[Lenape|Lenape tribe]], from whose language \"Lackawanna\" (or ''lac-a-wa-na,'' meaning \"stream that forks\"), is derived. In 1778, Isaac Tripp, the area's first known white settler, built his home here; it still stands in North Scranton, formerly a separate town known as Providence. More settlers from Connecticut came to the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries after the [[American Revolutionary War]], as their state claimed this area as part of their colonial charter.\n\nIn the 1840s there would have been at least 4 mentions of the office.  They gradually established mills and other small businesses in a village that became known as Slocum Hollow. People in the village during this time carried the traits and accent of their New England settlers, which were somewhat different from most of Pennsylvania. Some area settlers from Connecticut participated in what was known as the [[Pennamite Wars]], where settlers competed for control of the territory which had been included in royal colonial land grants to both states. (This claim between Connecticut and Pennsylvania was settled by negotiation with the federal government after independence.)\n\n===Arrival of industry (1846\u20131899)===\n[[File:George Inness - The Lackawanna Valley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton in 1855, as depicted by [[George Inness]]'s painting ''The Lackawanna Valley'', noting [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] ]]\n[[File:Scranton-1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton, as depicted on an 1890 panoramic map]] Though [[anthracite coal]] was being mined in Carbondale to the north and Wilkes-Barre to the south, the industries that precipitated the city's early rapid growth were [[iron]] and [[steel]]. In the 1840s, brothers Selden T. and [[George W. Scranton]], who had worked at [[Oxford Furnace]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], founded what became Lackawanna Iron & Coal, later developing as the [[Lackawanna Steel Company]]. It initially started producing iron nails, but that venture failed due to low-quality iron. The [[Erie Railroad]]'s construction in New York State was delayed by its having to acquire iron rails as imports from England. The Scrantons' firm decided to switch its focus to producing [[Rail profile|T-rails]] for the Erie; the company soon became a major producer of rails for the rapidly expanding railroads.\n\nIn 1851, the Scrantons built the [[Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (L&W) northward, with recent Irish immigrants supplying most of the labor, to meet the Erie Railroad in [[Great Bend, Pennsylvania]]. Thus they could transport manufactured rails from the Lackawanna Valley to New York and the Midwest. They also invested in coal mining operations in the city to fuel their steel operations, and to market it to businesses. In 1856, they expanded the railroad eastward as the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DL&W), in order to tap into the New York City metropolitan market. This railroad, with its hub in Scranton, was Scranton's largest employer for almost one hundred years.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Coal Company built a [[gravity railroad]] in the 1850s through the city for the purpose of transporting coal. The gravity railroad was replaced by a steam railroad built in 1886 by the Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad (later absorbed by the Erie Railroad).  The [[Delaware and Hudson]] (D&H) Canal Company, which had its own gravity railroad from Carbondale to [[Honesdale]], built a [[steam railroad]] that entered Scranton in 1863.\n\nDuring this short period of time, the city rapidly transformed from a small, agrarian-based village of people with New England roots to a multicultural, industrial-based city. From 1860 to 1900, the city's population increased more than tenfold. Most new immigrants, such as the Irish, Italians, and south Germans and Polish, were Catholic, a contrast to the majority-Protestant early settlers of colonial descent. National, ethnic, religious and class differences were wrapped into political affiliations, with many new immigrants joining the Democratic Party (and, for a time in the late 1870s, the [[Greenback Party|Greenbacker-Labor]] Party.)\n\nIn 1856, the Borough of Scranton was officially incorporated. It was incorporated as a city of 35,000 in 1866 in Luzerne County, when the surrounding boroughs of Hyde Park (now part of the city's West Side) and Providence (now part of North Scranton) were merged with Scranton. Twelve years later in 1878, the state passed a law enabling creation of new counties where a county's population surpassed 150,000, as did Luzerne's. The law appeared to enable the creation of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]], and there was considerable political agitation around the authorizing process. Scranton was designated by the state legislature as the county seat of the newly-formed county, which was also established as a separate judicial district, with state judges moving over from Luzerne County after courts were organized in October 1878. This was the last county in the state to be organized.\n\nCreation of the new county, which enabled both more local control and political patronage, helped begin the [[Scranton General Strike]] of 1877. This was in part due to the larger [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877|Great Railroad Strike]], in which railroad workers began to organize and participate in walkouts after wage cuts in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]]. The national economy had lagged since the Panic of 1873, and workers in many industries struggled with low wages and intermittent work. In Scranton, mineworkers followed the railroad men off the job, as did others. A protest of 5,000 strikers ended in violence, with a total of four men killed, and 20 to 50 injured, including the mayor. He had established a militia, but called for help from the governor and state militia. Governor [[John Hartranft]] eventually brought in federal troops to quell the strike. The workers gained nothing in wages, but began to organize more purposefully into labor unions that could wield more power.\n\nThe nation's first successful, continuously-operating electrified [[streetcar]] (trolley) system was established in the city in 1886, inspiring the nickname \"The Electric City\". In 1896, the city's various streetcar companies were consolidated into the [[Scranton Railway|Scranton Railway Company]], which ran trolleys until 1954. By 1890, three other railroads had built lines to tap into the rich supply of coal in and around the city, including the Erie Railroad, the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] and finally the [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway]] (NYO&W).\n\nAs the vast rail network spread above ground, an even larger network of railways served the rapidly expanding system of coal veins underground. Miners, who in the early years were typically Welsh and Irish, were hired as cheaply as possible by the coal barons. The workers endured low pay, long hours and unsafe working conditions. Children as young as eight or nine worked 14-hour days separating slate from coal in the [[coal breaker|breakers]]. Often, the workers were forced to use company-provided housing and purchase food and other goods from stores owned by the coal companies. With hundreds of thousands of immigrants arriving in the industrial cities, mine owners did not have to search for labor and workers struggled to keep their positions. Later miners came from Italy and eastern Europe, which people fled because of poverty and lack of jobs.\n\nBusiness was booming at the end of the 19th century. The tonnage of coal mined increased virtually every year, as did the steel manufactured by the Lackawanna Steel Company. At one point the company had the largest steel plant in the United States, and it was still the second-largest producer at the turn of the 20th century. By 1900, the city had a population of more than 100,000.\n\nIn the late 1890s, Scranton was home to a series of early [[International League]] baseball teams.\n\n===Labor history===\nGiven its industrial basis, Scranton has had a notable labor history; various coal worker unions struggled throughout the coal-mining era to improve working conditions, raise wages, and guarantee fair treatment for workers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Azzarelli, Margo L. |author2=Marnie Azzarelli|title=Labor Unrest in Scranton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sy4LDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT7|year=2016|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781625856814}}</ref>  The Panic of 1873 and other economic difficulties caused a national recession and loss of business. As the economy contracted, the railroad companies reduced wages of workers in most classes (while sometimes reserving raises for their top management). A major strike of railroad workers in August 1877, part of the [[Great Railroad Strike]], attracted workers from the steel industry and mining as well, and developed as the [[Scranton General Strike]]. Four rioters were killed during unrest during the strike, after the mayor mustered a militia. With violence suppressed by militia and federal troops, workers finally returned to their jobs, not able to gain any economic relief. [[William Walker Scranton]], from the prominent family, was then general manager of Lackawanna Iron and Coal. He later founded [[Scranton Steel Company]].\n\nThe labor issues and growth of industry in Scranton contributed to Lackawanna County being established by the state legislature in 1878, with territory taken from Luzerne County. Scranton was designated as the county seat. This strengthened its local government.\n\nThe unions failed to gain higher wages that year, but in 1878 they elected labor leader [[Terence V. Powderly]] of the [[Knights of Labor]] as mayor of Scranton. After that, he became national leader of the KoL, a predominately{{dubious|Perhaps a bare majority, although the situation may have been different in Scranton.|date=May 2016}} Catholic organization that had a peak membership of 700,000 about 1880.<ref>Vincent J. Falzone, \"Terence V. Powderly: Politician and Progressive Mayor of Scranton, 1878-1884,\" ''Pennsylvania History'' 41.3 (1974): 289-309.</ref> While the Catholic Church had prohibited membership in secret organizations since the mid-18th century, by the late 1880s with the influence of Archbishop [[James Gibbons]] of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], it supported the Knights of Labor as representing workingmen and union organizing.\n\nThe landmark [[Coal strike of 1902]], was called by anthracite miners across the region and led by the [[United Mine Workers]] under [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]]. The strike was settled by a compromise brokered by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. A statue of John Mitchell was installed in his honor on the grounds of the Lackawanna County Courthouse in Scranton, \"the site of the Coal Strike of 1902 negotiations in which President Roosevelt participated. Because of the significance of these negotiations, the statue and the Courthouse were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997. John Mitchell is buried in Cathedral Cemetery in Scranton.\"<ref>{{cite article|author=Sarah Scinto|title=Labor leader's grave restored|url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/labor-leader-s-grave-restored-1.1577236|publisher=Scranton Times-Tribune|date=October 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Growth, prosperity and consequences (1900\u20131945)===\n[[File:D.L. & W.

Most were descended from colonists and belonged to the Republican Party. The industrial workers, who tended to be later immigrants from Ireland and southern and eastern Europe, were predominately Catholic. With a flood of immigrants in the market, they suffered poor working conditions and wages.\n\nIn 1902, the dwindling local iron ore supply, labor issues, and an aging plant cost the city the industry on which it was founded. The Lackawanna Steel Company and many of its workers were moved to [[Lackawanna, New York]], developed on [[Lake Erie]] just south of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. With a port on the lake, the company could receive iron ore shipped from the [[Mesabi Range]] in Minnesota, which was being newly mined. \n[[File:The National geographic magazine (Page 377) BHL40563374 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|250px|City Hall and Soldiers Monument, ca. 1919, from ''National Geographic Magazine'']]\n\nScranton forged ahead as the capital of the anthracite coal industry. Attracting the thousands of workers needed to mine coal, the city developed new neighborhoods dominated by Italian and Eastern European immigrants, who brought their foods, cultures and religions. Many of the immigrants joined the Democratic Party. Their national churches and neighborhoods were part of the history of the city. Several [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches were founded and built during this period. A substantial Jewish community was also established, with most members coming from the Russian Empire and eastern Europe. Working conditions for miners were improved by the efforts of labor leaders such as [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]], who led the [[United Mine Workers]].\n\nThe sub-surface mining weakened whole neighborhoods, however, damaging homes, schools, and businesses when the land collapsed. In 1913 the state passed the Davis Act to establish the Bureau of Surface Support in Scranton. Because of the difficulty in dealing with the coal companies, citizens organized the [[Scranton Surface Protection Association]], chartered by the Court of Common Pleas on November 24, 1913 \"to protect the lives and property of the citizens of the City of Scranton and the streets of said city from injury, loss and damage caused by mining and mine caves.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\nIn 1915 and 1917, the city and Commonwealth sought injunctions to prevent coal companies from undermining city streets but lost their cases. North Main Avenue and Boulevard Avenue, \"both entitled to surface support, caved in as a result\" of court decisions that went against civil authorities and allowed the coal companies to continue their operations.<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\n\"The case of 'Penman v. Jones' came out differently. The Lackawanna Iron & Coal Co. had leased coal lands to the Lackawanna Iron & Steel Co., an allied interest, which passed the leases on to the Scranton Coal Co. Areas of central Scranton, the Hill Section, South Side, Pine Brook, Green Ridge and Hyde Park were affected by their mining activities. Mr. Penman was the private property owner in the case. The coal operators were defeated in this case.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\">[http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/scranton-takes-on-mining-cave-ins-1.1046286 Cheryl A.

The [[Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad]], commonly referred to as the Laurel Line, was built as an interurban passenger and freight carrier to [[Wilkes-Barre]]. Its Scranton station, offices, powerhouse and maintenance facility were built on the former grounds of the Lackawanna Steel Company, and operations started in 1903. Beginning in 1907, Scrantonians could also ride trolley cars to the northern suburbs of [[Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania|Clarks Summit]] and [[Dalton, Pennsylvania|Dalton]]. They could travel to [[Lake Winola]] and [[Montrose, Pennsylvania|Montrose]] using the [[Scranton, Montrose and Binghamton Railroad|Northern Electric]] Railroad. After the 1920s, no new trolley lines were built, but bus operations were started and expanded to meet service needs. In 1934, Scranton Railways was re-incorporated as the Scranton Transit Company, reflecting that shift in transportation modes.<ref>''The Scranton Republican,'' July 5, 1934, \"Railway Firm's New Financial Setup Revealed\", p. 1</ref>\n\nStarting in the early 1920s, the [[Scranton Button Company]] (founded in 1885 and a major maker of shellac buttons) became one of the primary makers of phonograph records. They pressed records for [[Emerson Records|Emerson]] (whom they bought in 1924), as well as [[Regal Records (1921)|Regal]], [[Cameo Records|Cameo]], [[Romeo Records|Romeo]], [[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Domino Records (1924)|Domino]], [[Conqueror Records|Conqueror]]. In July 1929, the company merged with Regal, Cameo, Banner, and the U.S. branch of [[Path\u00e9 Records|Path\u00e9]] (makers of Path\u00e9 and [[Perfect Records|Perfect]]) to become the [[American Record Corporation]]. By 1938, the Scranton company was also pressing records for [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], and [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]]. In 1946, the company was acquired by [[Capitol Records]], which continued to produce [[phonograph records]] through the end of the vinyl era.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, the city population had swelled beyond 140,000<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> due to growth in the mining and [[silk]] textile industries. World War II created a great demand for energy, which led to the highest production from [[mining]] in the area since World War I.\n\n{{Clear}}<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\">\nImage:Washington Avenue, Scranton, PA.jpg|Washington Ave. in 1907\nImage:Burning Culm Dump, Scranton, PA.jpg|Burning [[Spoil tip|culm]] dump c. 1908\nImage:Old Post Office, Scranton, PA.jpg|Old post office in 1911\n</gallery>\n\n===Post-World War II (1946\u20131984)===\nAfter World War II, coal lost favor to [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] as a heating fuel, largely because the latter types were more convenient to use. While some U.S. cities prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes and population of Scranton (and the rest of Lackawanna and [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne]] counties) began to diminish. Coal production and rail traffic declined rapidly throughout the 1950s, causing a loss of jobs.\n\nThe [[Knox Mine Disaster]] of January 1959 virtually ended the mining industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The waters of the [[Susquehanna River]] flooded the mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |title=The Citizens Voice \u2013 Knox mine disaster remains in our memory because it is a story of right and wrong |publisher=Zwire.com |accessdate=2011-08-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107061533/http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msha.gov/District/Dist_01/Reports/Knox/cover.htm |title=cover |publisher=Msha.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> The DL&W Railroad, nearly bankrupted by the drop in coal traffic and the effects of Hurricane Diane, merged in 1960 with the Erie Railroad.\nDemand for public transportation also declined as new highways were built by federal subsidies and people purchased automobiles. In 1952, the Laurel Line ceased passenger service. The Scranton Transit Company, whose trolleys had given the city its nickname, transferred all operations to buses as the 1954 holiday season approached; by the end of 1971, it ceased all operations. The city was left without any public transportation system for almost a year until the Lackawanna County government formed [[County of Lackawanna Transit System|COLTS]], which began operations in late 1972 with 1950s-era GM busses from New Jersey.\n\nScranton had been the hub of its operations until the [[Erie Lackawanna]] merger, after which it no longer served in this capacity. This was another severe blow to the local labor market. The NYO&W Railroad, which depended heavily on its Scranton branch for freight traffic, was abandoned in 1957. Mine [[subsidence]] was a spreading problem in the city as pillar supports in abandoned mines began to fail; cave-ins sometimes consumed entire blocks of homes. The area was left scarred by abandoned coal mining structures, strip mines, and massive [[culm dump]]s, some of which caught fire and burned for many years until they were extinguished through government efforts. In 1970, the Secretary of Mines for Pennsylvania suggested that so many underground voids had been left by mining underneath Scranton that it would be \"more economical\" to abandon the city than make them safe.<ref>{{cite book |title=Facts & Trivia |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |year=1998 |publisher=Siena |location=Bristol |isbn=0-75252-822-X |page=74}}</ref> In 1973, the last mine operations in Lackawanna County (which were in what is now [[McDade Park]], and another on the Scranton/[[Dickson City]] line) were closed.

Local government and much of the community at large have adopted a renewed interest in the city's buildings and history. Some historic properties have been renovated and marketed as tourist attractions. The [[Steamtown National Historic Site]] captures the area's once-prominent position in the railroad industry. The former DL&W train station was restored as the [[Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel]]. The [[Electric City Trolley Museum]] was created next to the DL&W yards that the Steamtown NHS occupies.\n\nSince the mid-1980s the [[Scranton Cultural Center]] has operated the architecturally significant Masonic Temple and Scottish Rite Cathedral, designed by [[Raymond Hood]], as the region's performing arts center. The [[Houdini Museum]] was opened in Scranton in 1990 by nationally known magician [[Dorothy Dietrich]].\n\nIn 2003, [[Hilton Hotels & Resorts]] opened the [http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/pennsylvania/hilton-scranton-and-conference-center-SCRCCHF/index.html Hilton Scranton Hotel & Conference Center] at the corner of Adams Avenue & Lackawanna Avenue in the heart of downtown Scranton.

It is the [[county seat]] and largest city of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] in [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]]'s [[Wyoming Valley]] and hosts a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] building for the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania]]. With a population of 77,291, it is the largest city in the [[Scranton\u2013Wilkes-Barre\u2013Hazleton, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which has a population of about 570,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.com/scranton-wilkes-barre-pa-area.htm |title=Scranton, Wilkes, Barre Metro Area |publisher=Usa.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> The city is conventionally divided into 8 districts: North Scranton, Southside, Westside, the Hill Section, Central City, Minooka, East Mountain, and Green Ridge, though these areas do not have legal status.\n\nScranton is the geographic and cultural center of the [[Lackawanna River]] valley and Northeastern Pennsylvania, and the largest of the former [[anthracite coal]] mining communities in a contiguous quilt-work that also includes [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Nanticoke, Pennsylvania|Nanticoke]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], and [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania|Carbondale]]. Scranton was incorporated on February 14, 1856, as a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] in [[Luzerne County]] and as a [[city (Pennsylvania)|city]] on April 23, 1866. It became a major industrial city, a center of mining and railroads, and attracted thousands of new immigrants. It was the site of the [[Scranton General Strike]] in 1877.\n\nPeople in northern Luzerne County sought a new county in 1839 but the [[Wilkes-Barre]] area resisted losing its assets. Lackawanna County did not gain independent status until 1878. Under legislation allowing the issue to be voted by residents of the proposed territory, voters favored the new county by a proportion of 6 to 1, with Scranton residents providing the major support. The city was designated as the county seat when [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] was established in 1878, and a judicial district was authorized in July 1879.\n\nThe city's nickname \"Electric City\" began when electric lights were introduced in 1880 at the [[Dickson Manufacturing Company]]. Six years later, the United States's first [[streetcar]]s powered only by electricity began operating in the city.<ref>http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-39E</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/apps/historical-markers.html|title=Pennsylvania Historical Marker Search|website=www.phmc.state.pa.us}}</ref>{{dubious| the claim is widespread, but it simply means a single line was set up as electric.|date=May 2016}} Rev.

But while the national economy boomed after the war, demand for the region's coal declined as other forms of energy became more popular, which also harmed the rail industry. Foreseeing the decline, city leaders formulated the Scranton Plan in 1945 to diversify the local economy beyond coal, but the city's economy continued to decline. The [[Knox Mine disaster]] of 1959 essentially ended coal mining in the region. Scranton's population dropped from its peak of 140,000 in [[1940 United States Census|1940 census]] to 88,000 in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 census]]. The city's economy and population stabilized in the 1980s and 1990s. The city now has large health care and manufacturing sectors.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-industrial (1776\u20131845)===\nPresent-day Scranton and its surrounding area had been long inhabited by the native [[Lenape|Lenape tribe]], from whose language \"Lackawanna\" (or ''lac-a-wa-na,'' meaning \"stream that forks\"), is derived. In 1778, Isaac Tripp, the area's first known white settler, built his home here; it still stands in North Scranton, formerly a separate town known as Providence. More settlers from Connecticut came to the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries after the [[American Revolutionary War]], as their state claimed this area as part of their colonial charter.\n\nIn the 1840s there would have been at least 4 mentions of the office.  They gradually established mills and other small businesses in a village that became known as Slocum Hollow. People in the village during this time carried the traits and accent of their New England settlers, which were somewhat different from most of Pennsylvania. Some area settlers from Connecticut participated in what was known as the [[Pennamite Wars]], where settlers competed for control of the territory which had been included in royal colonial land grants to both states. (This claim between Connecticut and Pennsylvania was settled by negotiation with the federal government after independence.)\n\n===Arrival of industry (1846\u20131899)===\n[[File:George Inness - The Lackawanna Valley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton in 1855, as depicted by [[George Inness]]'s painting ''The Lackawanna Valley'', noting [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] ]]\n[[File:Scranton-1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton, as depicted on an 1890 panoramic map]] Though [[anthracite coal]] was being mined in Carbondale to the north and Wilkes-Barre to the south, the industries that precipitated the city's early rapid growth were [[iron]] and [[steel]]. In the 1840s, brothers Selden T. and [[George W. Scranton]], who had worked at [[Oxford Furnace]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], founded what became Lackawanna Iron & Coal, later developing as the [[Lackawanna Steel Company]]. It initially started producing iron nails, but that venture failed due to low-quality iron. The [[Erie Railroad]]'s construction in New York State was delayed by its having to acquire iron rails as imports from England. The Scrantons' firm decided to switch its focus to producing [[Rail profile|T-rails]] for the Erie; the company soon became a major producer of rails for the rapidly expanding railroads.\n\nIn 1851, the Scrantons built the [[Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (L&W) northward, with recent Irish immigrants supplying most of the labor, to meet the Erie Railroad in [[Great Bend, Pennsylvania]]. Thus they could transport manufactured rails from the Lackawanna Valley to New York and the Midwest. They also invested in coal mining operations in the city to fuel their steel operations, and to market it to businesses. In 1856, they expanded the railroad eastward as the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DL&W), in order to tap into the New York City metropolitan market. This railroad, with its hub in Scranton, was Scranton's largest employer for almost one hundred years.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Coal Company built a [[gravity railroad]] in the 1850s through the city for the purpose of transporting coal. The gravity railroad was replaced by a steam railroad built in 1886 by the Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad (later absorbed by the Erie Railroad).  The [[Delaware and Hudson]] (D&H) Canal Company, which had its own gravity railroad from Carbondale to [[Honesdale]], built a [[steam railroad]] that entered Scranton in 1863.\n\nDuring this short period of time, the city rapidly transformed from a small, agrarian-based village of people with New England roots to a multicultural, industrial-based city. From 1860 to 1900, the city's population increased more than tenfold. Most new immigrants, such as the Irish, Italians, and south Germans and Polish, were Catholic, a contrast to the majority-Protestant early settlers of colonial descent. National, ethnic, religious and class differences were wrapped into political affiliations, with many new immigrants joining the Democratic Party (and, for a time in the late 1870s, the [[Greenback Party|Greenbacker-Labor]] Party.)\n\nIn 1856, the Borough of Scranton was officially incorporated. It was incorporated as a city of 35,000 in 1866 in Luzerne County, when the surrounding boroughs of Hyde Park (now part of the city's West Side) and Providence (now part of North Scranton) were merged with Scranton. Twelve years later in 1878, the state passed a law enabling creation of new counties where a county's population surpassed 150,000, as did Luzerne's. The law appeared to enable the creation of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]], and there was considerable political agitation around the authorizing process. Scranton was designated by the state legislature as the county seat of the newly-formed county, which was also established as a separate judicial district, with state judges moving over from Luzerne County after courts were organized in October 1878. This was the last county in the state to be organized.\n\nCreation of the new county, which enabled both more local control and political patronage, helped begin the [[Scranton General Strike]] of 1877. This was in part due to the larger [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877|Great Railroad Strike]], in which railroad workers began to organize and participate in walkouts after wage cuts in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]]. The national economy had lagged since the Panic of 1873, and workers in many industries struggled with low wages and intermittent work. In Scranton, mineworkers followed the railroad men off the job, as did others. A protest of 5,000 strikers ended in violence, with a total of four men killed, and 20 to 50 injured, including the mayor. He had established a militia, but called for help from the governor and state militia. Governor [[John Hartranft]] eventually brought in federal troops to quell the strike. The workers gained nothing in wages, but began to organize more purposefully into labor unions that could wield more power.\n\nThe nation's first successful, continuously-operating electrified [[streetcar]] (trolley) system was established in the city in 1886, inspiring the nickname \"The Electric City\". In 1896, the city's various streetcar companies were consolidated into the [[Scranton Railway|Scranton Railway Company]], which ran trolleys until 1954. By 1890, three other railroads had built lines to tap into the rich supply of coal in and around the city, including the Erie Railroad, the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] and finally the [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway]] (NYO&W).\n\nAs the vast rail network spread above ground, an even larger network of railways served the rapidly expanding system of coal veins underground. Miners, who in the early years were typically Welsh and Irish, were hired as cheaply as possible by the coal barons. The workers endured low pay, long hours and unsafe working conditions. Children as young as eight or nine worked 14-hour days separating slate from coal in the [[coal breaker|breakers]]. Often, the workers were forced to use company-provided housing and purchase food and other goods from stores owned by the coal companies. With hundreds of thousands of immigrants arriving in the industrial cities, mine owners did not have to search for labor and workers struggled to keep their positions. Later miners came from Italy and eastern Europe, which people fled because of poverty and lack of jobs.\n\nBusiness was booming at the end of the 19th century. The tonnage of coal mined increased virtually every year, as did the steel manufactured by the Lackawanna Steel Company. At one point the company had the largest steel plant in the United States, and it was still the second-largest producer at the turn of the 20th century. By 1900, the city had a population of more than 100,000.\n\nIn the late 1890s, Scranton was home to a series of early [[International League]] baseball teams.\n\n===Labor history===\nGiven its industrial basis, Scranton has had a notable labor history; various coal worker unions struggled throughout the coal-mining era to improve working conditions, raise wages, and guarantee fair treatment for workers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Azzarelli, Margo L. |author2=Marnie Azzarelli|title=Labor Unrest in Scranton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sy4LDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT7|year=2016|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781625856814}}</ref>  The Panic of 1873 and other economic difficulties caused a national recession and loss of business. As the economy contracted, the railroad companies reduced wages of workers in most classes (while sometimes reserving raises for their top management). A major strike of railroad workers in August 1877, part of the [[Great Railroad Strike]], attracted workers from the steel industry and mining as well, and developed as the [[Scranton General Strike]]. Four rioters were killed during unrest during the strike, after the mayor mustered a militia. With violence suppressed by militia and federal troops, workers finally returned to their jobs, not able to gain any economic relief. [[William Walker Scranton]], from the prominent family, was then general manager of Lackawanna Iron and Coal. He later founded [[Scranton Steel Company]].\n\nThe labor issues and growth of industry in Scranton contributed to Lackawanna County being established by the state legislature in 1878, with territory taken from Luzerne County. Scranton was designated as the county seat. This strengthened its local government.\n\nThe unions failed to gain higher wages that year, but in 1878 they elected labor leader [[Terence V. Powderly]] of the [[Knights of Labor]] as mayor of Scranton. After that, he became national leader of the KoL, a predominately{{dubious|Perhaps a bare majority, although the situation may have been different in Scranton.|date=May 2016}} Catholic organization that had a peak membership of 700,000 about 1880.<ref>Vincent J.

The strike was settled by a compromise brokered by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. A statue of John Mitchell was installed in his honor on the grounds of the Lackawanna County Courthouse in Scranton, \"the site of the Coal Strike of 1902 negotiations in which President Roosevelt participated. Because of the significance of these negotiations, the statue and the Courthouse were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997. John Mitchell is buried in Cathedral Cemetery in Scranton.\"<ref>{{cite article|author=Sarah Scinto|title=Labor leader's grave restored|url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/labor-leader-s-grave-restored-1.1577236|publisher=Scranton Times-Tribune|date=October 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Growth, prosperity and consequences (1900\u20131945)===\n[[File:D.L. & W.

Most were descended from colonists and belonged to the Republican Party. The industrial workers, who tended to be later immigrants from Ireland and southern and eastern Europe, were predominately Catholic. With a flood of immigrants in the market, they suffered poor working conditions and wages.\n\nIn 1902, the dwindling local iron ore supply, labor issues, and an aging plant cost the city the industry on which it was founded. The Lackawanna Steel Company and many of its workers were moved to [[Lackawanna, New York]], developed on [[Lake Erie]] just south of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. With a port on the lake, the company could receive iron ore shipped from the [[Mesabi Range]] in Minnesota, which was being newly mined. \n[[File:The National geographic magazine (Page 377) BHL40563374 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|250px|City Hall and Soldiers Monument, ca. 1919, from ''National Geographic Magazine'']]\n\nScranton forged ahead as the capital of the anthracite coal industry. Attracting the thousands of workers needed to mine coal, the city developed new neighborhoods dominated by Italian and Eastern European immigrants, who brought their foods, cultures and religions. Many of the immigrants joined the Democratic Party. Their national churches and neighborhoods were part of the history of the city. Several [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches were founded and built during this period. A substantial Jewish community was also established, with most members coming from the Russian Empire and eastern Europe. Working conditions for miners were improved by the efforts of labor leaders such as [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]], who led the [[United Mine Workers]].\n\nThe sub-surface mining weakened whole neighborhoods, however, damaging homes, schools, and businesses when the land collapsed. In 1913 the state passed the Davis Act to establish the Bureau of Surface Support in Scranton. Because of the difficulty in dealing with the coal companies, citizens organized the [[Scranton Surface Protection Association]], chartered by the Court of Common Pleas on November 24, 1913 \"to protect the lives and property of the citizens of the City of Scranton and the streets of said city from injury, loss and damage caused by mining and mine caves.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\nIn 1915 and 1917, the city and Commonwealth sought injunctions to prevent coal companies from undermining city streets but lost their cases. North Main Avenue and Boulevard Avenue, \"both entitled to surface support, caved in as a result\" of court decisions that went against civil authorities and allowed the coal companies to continue their operations.<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\n\"The case of 'Penman v. Jones' came out differently. The Lackawanna Iron & Coal Co. had leased coal lands to the Lackawanna Iron & Steel Co., an allied interest, which passed the leases on to the Scranton Coal Co. Areas of central Scranton, the Hill Section, South Side, Pine Brook, Green Ridge and Hyde Park were affected by their mining activities. Mr. Penman was the private property owner in the case. The coal operators were defeated in this case.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\">[http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/scranton-takes-on-mining-cave-ins-1.1046286 Cheryl A.

The [[Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad]], commonly referred to as the Laurel Line, was built as an interurban passenger and freight carrier to [[Wilkes-Barre]]. Its Scranton station, offices, powerhouse and maintenance facility were built on the former grounds of the Lackawanna Steel Company, and operations started in 1903. Beginning in 1907, Scrantonians could also ride trolley cars to the northern suburbs of [[Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania|Clarks Summit]] and [[Dalton, Pennsylvania|Dalton]]. They could travel to [[Lake Winola]] and [[Montrose, Pennsylvania|Montrose]] using the [[Scranton, Montrose and Binghamton Railroad|Northern Electric]] Railroad. After the 1920s, no new trolley lines were built, but bus operations were started and expanded to meet service needs. In 1934, Scranton Railways was re-incorporated as the Scranton Transit Company, reflecting that shift in transportation modes.<ref>''The Scranton Republican,'' July 5, 1934, \"Railway Firm's New Financial Setup Revealed\", p. 1</ref>\n\nStarting in the early 1920s, the [[Scranton Button Company]] (founded in 1885 and a major maker of shellac buttons) became one of the primary makers of phonograph records. They pressed records for [[Emerson Records|Emerson]] (whom they bought in 1924), as well as [[Regal Records (1921)|Regal]], [[Cameo Records|Cameo]], [[Romeo Records|Romeo]], [[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Domino Records (1924)|Domino]], [[Conqueror Records|Conqueror]]. In July 1929, the company merged with Regal, Cameo, Banner, and the U.S. branch of [[Path\u00e9 Records|Path\u00e9]] (makers of Path\u00e9 and [[Perfect Records|Perfect]]) to become the [[American Record Corporation]]. By 1938, the Scranton company was also pressing records for [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], and [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]]. In 1946, the company was acquired by [[Capitol Records]], which continued to produce [[phonograph records]] through the end of the vinyl era.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, the city population had swelled beyond 140,000<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> due to growth in the mining and [[silk]] textile industries. World War II created a great demand for energy, which led to the highest production from [[mining]] in the area since World War I.\n\n{{Clear}}<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\">\nImage:Washington Avenue, Scranton, PA.jpg|Washington Ave. in 1907\nImage:Burning Culm Dump, Scranton, PA.jpg|Burning [[Spoil tip|culm]] dump c. 1908\nImage:Old Post Office, Scranton, PA.jpg|Old post office in 1911\n</gallery>\n\n===Post-World War II (1946\u20131984)===\nAfter World War II, coal lost favor to [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] as a heating fuel, largely because the latter types were more convenient to use. While some U.S. cities prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes and population of Scranton (and the rest of Lackawanna and [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne]] counties) began to diminish. Coal production and rail traffic declined rapidly throughout the 1950s, causing a loss of jobs.\n\nThe [[Knox Mine Disaster]] of January 1959 virtually ended the mining industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The waters of the [[Susquehanna River]] flooded the mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |title=The Citizens Voice \u2013 Knox mine disaster remains in our memory because it is a story of right and wrong |publisher=Zwire.com |accessdate=2011-08-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107061533/http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msha.gov/District/Dist_01/Reports/Knox/cover.htm |title=cover |publisher=Msha.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> The DL&W Railroad, nearly bankrupted by the drop in coal traffic and the effects of Hurricane Diane, merged in 1960 with the Erie Railroad.\nDemand for public transportation also declined as new highways were built by federal subsidies and people purchased automobiles. In 1952, the Laurel Line ceased passenger service. The Scranton Transit Company, whose trolleys had given the city its nickname, transferred all operations to buses as the 1954 holiday season approached; by the end of 1971, it ceased all operations. The city was left without any public transportation system for almost a year until the Lackawanna County government formed [[County of Lackawanna Transit System|COLTS]], which began operations in late 1972 with 1950s-era GM busses from New Jersey.\n\nScranton had been the hub of its operations until the [[Erie Lackawanna]] merger, after which it no longer served in this capacity. This was another severe blow to the local labor market. The NYO&W Railroad, which depended heavily on its Scranton branch for freight traffic, was abandoned in 1957. Mine [[subsidence]] was a spreading problem in the city as pillar supports in abandoned mines began to fail; cave-ins sometimes consumed entire blocks of homes. The area was left scarred by abandoned coal mining structures, strip mines, and massive [[culm dump]]s, some of which caught fire and burned for many years until they were extinguished through government efforts. In 1970, the Secretary of Mines for Pennsylvania suggested that so many underground voids had been left by mining underneath Scranton that it would be \"more economical\" to abandon the city than make them safe.<ref>{{cite book |title=Facts & Trivia |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |year=1998 |publisher=Siena |location=Bristol |isbn=0-75252-822-X |page=74}}</ref> In 1973, the last mine operations in Lackawanna County (which were in what is now [[McDade Park]], and another on the Scranton/[[Dickson City]] line) were closed.

{"title_page": "Four fours", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=July 2019}}\n'''Four fours''' is a [[mathematical puzzle]]. The goal of four fours is to find the simplest [[mathematical expression]] for every [[Natural number|whole number]] from 0 to some maximum, using only common mathematical symbols and the digit [[4 (number)|four]] (no other digit is allowed). Most versions of four fours require that each expression have exactly four fours, but some variations require that each expression have the minimum number of fours. This game requires skill.\n\nThe first printed occurrence of the specific problem of four fours is in ''[[Knowledge: An Illustrated Magazine of Science]]'' in 1881.<ref>Pat Ballew, [https://pballew.blogspot.com/2018/12/before-there-were-four-fours-there-were.html Before there were Four-Fours, there were four threes, and several others], ''Pat'sBlog'', 30 December 2018.</ref>\n\n[[W. W. Rouse Ball]] described it in the 6th edition (1914) of his ''Mathematical Recreations and Essays''. In this book it is described as a \"traditional recreation\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ball|first1=Walter William Rouse|title=Mathematical Recreations and Essays, page 14|edition=6th|url=https://archive.org/stream/mathematicalrecr00ball#page/14/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThere are many variations of four fours; their primary difference is which mathematical symbols are allowed. Essentially all variations at least allow [[addition]] (\"+\"), [[subtraction]] (\"&minus;\"), [[multiplication]] (\"&times;\"), [[division (mathematics)|division]] (\"\u00f7\"), and [[bracket|parentheses]], as well as concatenation (e.g., \"44\" is allowed). Most also allow the [[factorial]] (\"!\"), [[exponentiation]] (e.g. \"44<sup>4</sup>\"), the decimal point (\".\") and the [[square root]] (\"\u221a\") operation. Other operations allowed by some variations include the [[reciprocal function]] (\"1/x\"), [[subfactorial]] (\"!\" before the number: !4 equals 9), overline (an infinitely repeated digit), an arbitrary root, the [[square function]] (\"sqr\"), the [[cubic function|cube function]] (\"cube\"), the [[cube root]], the [[gamma function]] (\u0393(), where \u0393(''x'') = (''x'' &minus; 1)!), and percent (\"%\"). Thus\n\n<math>4\\% = 0.04</math>\n\n<math>sqr(4) = 16</math>\n\n<math>cube(4) = 64</math>\n\n<math>\\sqrt{4} = 2</math>\n\n<math>4! = 24</math>\n\n<math>\\Gamma(4) = 6</math>\n\n<math>!4 = 9</math>\n\n<math>4' = 1/4 = 0.25</math>\n\n<math>.4 = 0.4</math>\n\n<math>.\\overline{4} = .4444... = 4/9</math>\n\netc.\n\nA common use of the overline in this problem is for this value:\n:<math>.\\overline{4} = .4444... = 4/9</math>\n\nTypically the \"[[Logarithm|log]]\" operators or the [[successor function]] are not allowed, since there is a way to trivially create any number using them. This works by noticing 3 things:\n\n1)\tyou can take square roots repeatedly without using any additional 4s\n\n2)\ta square root can also be written as the exponent (^(1/2))\n\n3)\texponents have logarithms as their inverse.\n\n:<big><math>\\underbrace{\\sqrt{\\sqrt{\\cdots\\sqrt{4}}}}_{n} = 4^{(1/2)^n}</math></big>\n\nWriting repeated square root in this form we can isolate n, which is the number of square roots!:\n\n:<big><math>4^{(1/2)^n}</math></big>\n\nwe can isolate both exponents by using log base 4\n\n:<big><math>\\log_{4}4^{(1/2)^n}</math></big>\n\nwe can think of this log base 4 as the question--\"4 to what power gives me 4 to the half power to the n power?\"\n\n:<big><math>4^x = 4^{(1/2)^n}</math></big>\n\nso we are now left with:\n\n:<math>(1/2)^n</math>\n\nand now we can do the same thing to isolate the exponent, n:\n\n:<big><math>n=\\log_{(1/2)} (1/2)^n</math></big>\n\nso, putting it all together:\n\n:<big><math>n=\\log_{(1/2)}\\log_{4} 4^{(1/2)^n}</math></big>\n\nNow, we can rewrite the base (1/2) with only 4s and the exponent (1/2) back to a square root:\n\n:<big><math>n=\\log_{\\sqrt{4}/4}\\log_{4}\\underbrace{\\sqrt{\\sqrt{\\cdots\\sqrt{4}}}}_{n}</math></big>\n\nWe've used four fours and now the number of square roots we add equals whatever number we want out!\n\nPaul Bourke credits Ben Rudiak-Gould with a different description of how four fours can be solved using natural logarithms (ln(n)) to represent any positive integer ''n'' as:\n:<math>n = -\\sqrt4\\frac{\\ln\\left[\\left(\\ln\\underbrace{\\sqrt{\\sqrt{\\cdots\\sqrt4}}}_{n}\\right) / \\ln4\\right]}{\\ln{4}}</math>\n\nAdditional variants (usually no longer called \"four fours\") replace the set of digits (\"4, 4, 4, 4\") with some other set of digits, say of the birthyear of someone. For example, a variant using \"1975\" would require each expression to use one 1, one 9, one 7, and one 5.\n\n==Solutions==\n\nHere is a set of four fours solutions for the numbers 0 through 32, using typical rules. Some alternate solutions are listed here, although there are actually many more correct solutions.

Wheeler)|website=Dwheeler.com}}</ref>  A non-standard solution is <math>4(4!+4+4')</math>, where 4' is the [[multiplicative inverse]] of 4. (i.e. <math>\\frac{1}{4}</math>) Another possible solution is <math>\\frac{((4!)!_{10})!_{127}}{(4!)!_{10}}</math>, where <math>!_{10}</math> and <math>!_{127}</math> represent the 10th and 127th [[Factorial#Multifactorials|multifactorials]] respectively, and should technically be denoted with that many exclamation marks to adhere to the rules of the problem.\n\nThe use of [[percent]] (\"%\") admits solutions for a much greater proportion of numbers; for example, 113 = ({{radic|4}} + ({{radic|4}} + 4!)%) \u00f7 ({{radic|4}})%.\n\nThe number [[157 (number)|157]] can be solved using [[gamma function|the gamma function]], one of the possible solutions is (\u0393(4)!+4 \u00f7 4) - 4!\n\n==Algorithmics of the problem==\nThis problem and its generalizations (like the five fives and the six sixes problem, both shown below) may be solved by a simple algorithm. The basic ingredients are [[hash table]]s that map rationals to strings. In these tables, the keys are the numbers being represented by some admissible combination of operators and the chosen digit ''d'', e.g. four, and the values are strings that contain the actual formula. There is one table for each number ''n'' of occurrences of ''d''. For example, when ''d=4'', the hash table for two occurrences of ''d'' would contain the key-value pair ''8'' and '''4+4''', and the one for three occurrences, the key-value pair ''2'' and '''(4+4)/4''' (strings shown in bold).\n\nThe task is then reduced to recursively computing these hash tables for increasing ''n'', starting from ''n=1'' and continuing up to e.g. ''n=4.'' The tables for ''n=1'' and ''n=2'' are special, because they contain primitive entries that are not the combination of other, smaller formulas, and hence they must be initialized properly, like so (for ''n=1'')\n\n        T[4]    := \"4\";\n        T[4/10] := \".4\";\n        T[4/9]  := \".4...\";\n\nand\n\n         T[44] := \"44\";.\n\n(for ''n=2''). Now there are two ways in which new entries may arise, either as a combination of existing ones through a binary operator, or by applying the factorial or square root operators (which does not use additional instances of ''d''). The first case is treated by iterating over all pairs of subexpressions that use a total of ''n'' instances of ''d''. For example, when ''n=4'', we would check pairs ''(a,b)'' with ''a'' containing one instance of ''d'' and ''b'' three, and with ''a'' containing two instances of ''d'' and ''b'' two as well. We would then enter ''a+b, a-b, b-a, a*b, a/b, b/a)'' into the hash table, including parenthesis, for ''n=4''. Here the sets ''A'' and ''B'' that contain ''a'' and ''b'' are calculated recursively, with ''n=1'' and ''n=2'' being the base case. [[Memoization]] is used to ensure that every hash table is only computed once.\n\nThe second case (factorials and roots) is treated with the help of an auxiliary function, which is invoked every time a value ''v'' is recorded. This function computes nested factorials and roots of ''v'' up to some maximum depth, restricted to rationals.\n\nThe last phase of the algorithm consists in iterating over the keys of the table for the desired value of ''n'' and extracting and sorting those keys that are integers. This algorithm was used to calculate the five fives and six sixes examples shown below. The more compact formula (in the sense of number of characters in the corresponding value) was chosen every time a key occurred more than once.\n\n==Excerpt from the solution to the five fives problem==\n 139 = (((5+(5/5))!/5)-5)\n 140 = (.5*(5+(5*55)))\n 141 = ((5)!+((5+(5+.5))/.5))\n 142 = ((5)!+((55/.5)/5))\n 143 = ((((5+(5/5)))!-5)/5)\n 144 = ((((55/5)-5))!/5)\n 145 = ((5*(5+(5*5)))-5)\n 146 = ((5)!+((5/5)+(5*5)))\n 147 = ((5)!+((.5*55)-.5))\n 148 = ((5)!+(.5+(.5*55)))\n 149 = (5+(((5+(5/5)))!+5))\n\n==Excerpt from the solution to the six sixes problem==\nIn the table below, the notation .6... represents the value 6/9 or 2/3 ([[recurring decimal]] 6).\n\n 241 = ((.6+((6+6)*(6+6)))/.6)\n 242 = ((6*(6+(6*6)))-(6/.6))\n 243 = (6+((6*(.6*66))-.6))\n 244 = (.6...*(6+(6*(66-6))))\n 245 = ((((6)!+((6)!+66))/6)-6)\n 246 = (66+(6*((6*6)-6)))\n 247 = (66+((6+((6)!/.6...))/6))\n 248 = (6*(6+(6*(6-(.6.../6)))))\n 249 = (.6+(6*(6+((6*6)-.6))))\n 250 = (((6*(6*6))-66)/.6)\n 251 = ((6*(6+(6*6)))-(6/6))\n\n==See also==\n*[[Krypto (game)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite web|first1=Paul | last1=Bourke|url=http://paulbourke.net/fun/4444/ \n  |title=Four Fours Problem}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://mathforum.org/ruth/four4s.puzzle.html |last1=Carver | first1=Ruth\n   |title=Four Fours Puzzle}} at MathForum.org\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.eyegate.com/showgal.php?id=7 |title= 4444 (Four Fours)}} Eyegate Gallery.\n* {{GitHub|saibaba/four4s}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.p2sis.com/educationgames/four-fours/maths-four-fours-game.html \n   |title=Online Implementation of the Four Fours Game}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Four Fours}}\n[[Category:Mathematical games]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=July 2019}}\n'''Four fours''' is a [[mathematical puzzle]]. The goal of four fours is to find the simplest [[mathematical expression]] for every [[Natural number|whole number]] from 0 to some maximum, using only common mathematical symbols and the digit [[4 (number)|four]] (no other digit is allowed). Most versions of four fours require that each expression have exactly four fours, but some variations require that each expression have the minimum number of fours. This game requires skill.\n\nThe first printed occurrence of the specific problem of four fours is in ''[[Knowledge: An Illustrated Magazine of Science]]'' in 1881.<ref>Pat Ballew, [https://pballew.blogspot.com/2018/12/before-there-were-four-fours-there-were.html Before there were Four-Fours, there were four threes, and several others], ''Pat'sBlog'', 30 December 2018.</ref>\n\n[[W. W. Rouse Ball]] described it in the 6th edition (1914) of his ''Mathematical Recreations and Essays''. In this book it is described as a \"traditional recreation\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ball|first1=Walter William Rouse|title=Mathematical Recreations and Essays, page 14|edition=6th|url=https://archive.org/stream/mathematicalrecr00ball#page/14/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThere are many variations of four fours; their primary difference is which mathematical symbols are allowed. Essentially all variations at least allow [[addition]] (\"+\"), [[subtraction]] (\"&minus;\"), [[multiplication]] (\"&times;\"), [[division (mathematics)|division]] (\"\u00f7\"), and [[bracket|parentheses]], as well as concatenation (e.g., \"44\" is allowed). Most also allow the [[factorial]] (\"!\"), [[exponentiation]] (e.g. \"44<sup>4</sup>\"), the decimal point (\".\") and the [[square root]] (\"\u221a\") operation. Other operations allowed by some variations include the [[reciprocal function]] (\"1/x\"), [[subfactorial]] (\"!\" before the number: !4 equals 9), overline (an infinitely repeated digit), an arbitrary root, the [[square function]] (\"sqr\"), the [[cubic function|cube function]] (\"cube\"), the [[cube root]], the [[gamma function]] (\u0393(), where \u0393(''x'') = (''x'' &minus; 1)!), and percent (\"%\"). Thus\n\n<math>4\\% = 0.04</math>\n\n<math>sqr(4) = 16</math>\n\n<math>cube(4) = 64</math>\n\n<math>\\sqrt{4} = 2</math>\n\n<math>4! = 24</math>\n\n<math>\\Gamma(4) = 6</math>\n\n<math>!4 = 9</math>\n\n<math>4' = 1/4 = 0.25</math>\n\n<math>.4 = 0.4</math>\n\n<math>.\\overline{4} = .4444... = 4/9</math>\n\netc.\n\nA common use of the overline in this problem is for this value:\n:<math>.\\overline{4} = .4444... = 4/9</math>\n\nTypically the \"[[Logarithm|log]]\" operators or the [[successor function]] are not allowed, since there is a way to trivially create any number using them. This works by noticing 3 things:\n\n1)\tyou can take square roots repeatedly without using any additional 4s\n\n2)\ta square root can also be written as the exponent (^(1/2))\n\n3)\texponents have logarithms as their inverse.\n\n:<big><math>\\underbrace{\\sqrt{\\sqrt{\\cdots\\sqrt{4}}}}_{n} = 4^{(1/2)^n}</math></big>\n\nWriting repeated square root in this form we can isolate n, which is the number of square roots!:\n\n:<big><math>4^{(1/2)^n}</math></big>\n\nwe can isolate both exponents by using log base 4\n\n:<big><math>\\log_{4}4^{(1/2)^n}</math></big>\n\nwe can think of this log base 4 as the question--\"4 to what power gives me 4 to the half power to the n power?\"\n\n:<big><math>4^x = 4^{(1/2)^n}</math></big>\n\nso we are now left with:\n\n:<math>(1/2)^n</math>\n\nand now we can do the same thing to isolate the exponent, n:\n\n:<big><math>n=\\log_{(1/2)} (1/2)^n</math></big>\n\nso, putting it all together:\n\n:<big><math>n=\\log_{(1/2)}\\log_{4} 4^{(1/2)^n}</math></big>\n\nNow, we can rewrite the base (1/2) with only 4s and the exponent (1/2) back to a square root:\n\n:<big><math>n=\\log_{\\sqrt{4}/4}\\log_{4}\\underbrace{\\sqrt{\\sqrt{\\cdots\\sqrt{4}}}}_{n}</math></big>\n\nWe've used four fours and now the number of square roots we add equals whatever number we want out!\n\nPaul Bourke credits Ben Rudiak-Gould with a different description of how four fours can be solved using natural logarithms (ln(n)) to represent any positive integer ''n'' as:\n:<math>n = -\\sqrt4\\frac{\\ln\\left[\\left(\\ln\\underbrace{\\sqrt{\\sqrt{\\cdots\\sqrt4}}}_{n}\\right) / \\ln4\\right]}{\\ln{4}}</math>\n\nAdditional variants (usually no longer called \"four fours\") replace the set of digits (\"4, 4, 4, 4\") with some other set of digits, say of the birthyear of someone. For example, a variant using \"1975\" would require each expression to use one 1, one 9, one 7, and one 5.\n\n==Solutions==\n\nHere is a set of four fours solutions for the numbers 0 through 32, using typical rules. Some alternate solutions are listed here, although there are actually many more correct solutions.

(i.e. <math>\\frac{1}{4}</math>) Another possible solution is <math>\\frac{((4!)!_{10})!_{127}}{(4!)!_{10}}</math>, where <math>!_{10}</math> and <math>!_{127}</math> represent the 10th and 127th [[Factorial#Multifactorials|multifactorials]] respectively, and should technically be denoted with that many exclamation marks to adhere to the rules of the problem.\n\nThe use of [[percent]] (\"%\") admits solutions for a much greater proportion of numbers; for example, 113 = ({{radic|4}} + ({{radic|4}} + 4!)%) \u00f7 ({{radic|4}})%.\n\nThe number [[157 (number)|157]] can be solved using [[gamma function|the gamma function]], one of the possible solutions is (\u0393(4)!+4 \u00f7 4) - 4!\n\n==Algorithmics of the problem==\nThis problem and its generalizations (like the five fives and the six sixes problem, both shown below) may be solved by a simple algorithm. The basic ingredients are [[hash table]]s that map rationals to strings. In these tables, the keys are the numbers being represented by some admissible combination of operators and the chosen digit ''d'', e.g. four, and the values are strings that contain the actual formula. There is one table for each number ''n'' of occurrences of ''d''. For example, when ''d=4'', the hash table for two occurrences of ''d'' would contain the key-value pair ''8'' and '''4+4''', and the one for three occurrences, the key-value pair ''2'' and '''(4+4)/4''' (strings shown in bold).\n\nThe task is then reduced to recursively computing these hash tables for increasing ''n'', starting from ''n=1'' and continuing up to e.g. ''n=4.'' The tables for ''n=1'' and ''n=2'' are special, because they contain primitive entries that are not the combination of other, smaller formulas, and hence they must be initialized properly, like so (for ''n=1'')\n\n        T[4]    := \"4\";\n        T[4/10] := \".4\";\n        T[4/9]  := \".4...\";\n\nand\n\n         T[44] := \"44\";.\n\n(for ''n=2''). Now there are two ways in which new entries may arise, either as a combination of existing ones through a binary operator, or by applying the factorial or square root operators (which does not use additional instances of ''d''). The first case is treated by iterating over all pairs of subexpressions that use a total of ''n'' instances of ''d''. For example, when ''n=4'', we would check pairs ''(a,b)'' with ''a'' containing one instance of ''d'' and ''b'' three, and with ''a'' containing two instances of ''d'' and ''b'' two as well. We would then enter ''a+b, a-b, b-a, a*b, a/b, b/a)'' into the hash table, including parenthesis, for ''n=4''. Here the sets ''A'' and ''B'' that contain ''a'' and ''b'' are calculated recursively, with ''n=1'' and ''n=2'' being the base case. [[Memoization]] is used to ensure that every hash table is only computed once.\n\nThe second case (factorials and roots) is treated with the help of an auxiliary function, which is invoked every time a value ''v'' is recorded. This function computes nested factorials and roots of ''v'' up to some maximum depth, restricted to rationals.\n\nThe last phase of the algorithm consists in iterating over the keys of the table for the desired value of ''n'' and extracting and sorting those keys that are integers. This algorithm was used to calculate the five fives and six sixes examples shown below. The more compact formula (in the sense of number of characters in the corresponding value) was chosen every time a key occurred more than once.\n\n==Excerpt from the solution to the five fives problem==\n 139 = (((5+(5/5))!/5)-5)\n 140 = (.5*(5+(5*55)))\n 141 = ((5)!+((5+(5+.5))/.5))\n 142 = ((5)!+((55/.5)/5))\n 143 = ((((5+(5/5)))!-5)/5)\n 144 = ((((55/5)-5))!/5)\n 145 = ((5*(5+(5*5)))-5)\n 146 = ((5)!+((5/5)+(5*5)))\n 147 = ((5)!+((.5*55)-.5))\n 148 = ((5)!+(.5+(.5*55)))\n 149 = (5+(((5+(5/5)))!+5))\n\n==Excerpt from the solution to the six sixes problem==\nIn the table below, the notation .6... represents the value 6/9 or 2/3 ([[recurring decimal]] 6).\n\n 241 = ((.6+((6+6)*(6+6)))/.6)\n 242 = ((6*(6+(6*6)))-(6/.6))\n 243 = (6+((6*(.6*66))-.6))\n 244 = (.6...*(6+(6*(66-6))))\n 245 = ((((6)!+((6)!+66))/6)-6)\n 246 = (66+(6*((6*6)-6)))\n 247 = (66+((6+((6)!/.6...))/6))\n 248 = (6*(6+(6*(6-(.6.../6)))))\n 249 = (.6+(6*(6+((6*6)-.6))))\n 250 = (((6*(6*6))-66)/.6)\n 251 = ((6*(6+(6*6)))-(6/6))\n\n==See also==\n*[[Krypto (game)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite web|first1=Paul | last1=Bourke|url=http://paulbourke.net/fun/4444/ \n  |title=Four Fours Problem}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://mathforum.org/ruth/four4s.puzzle.html |last1=Carver | first1=Ruth\n   |title=Four Fours Puzzle}} at MathForum.org\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.eyegate.com/showgal.php?id=7 |title= 4444 (Four Fours)}} Eyegate Gallery.\n* {{GitHub|saibaba/four4s}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.p2sis.com/educationgames/four-fours/maths-four-fours-game.html \n   |title=Online Implementation of the Four Fours Game}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Four Fours}}\n[[Category:Mathematical games]]\n", "name_user": "50.67.9.48", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eSolutions)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_fours"}

The next month, the extended range (ER) passenger version entered service with [[Qantas]], the only airline ever to order the passenger version of the 747-400ER. Qantas initially used the 747-400ER for the Melbourne to Los Angeles and Dallas to Sydney route allowing the completion of the flight with full passenger load and cargo. Prior to the 747-400ER, Qantas would complete such flights by blocking out 'E' zone of the cabin and limiting passenger numbers and cargo. The 747-400ER featured the ''Boeing Signature Interior'', which was later made available on the 747-400 (either as a retrofit on existing 747-400s or factory installation on new frames).\n\nThe 747-400ER also introduced some flight deck enhancements, including [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs), which replaced the six [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) displays found on the Boeing {{not a typo|747-400}}. LCDs later became standard on the 747-400 as well, and could be retrofitted to earlier aircraft. The three standby flight displays found on the 747-400 were also replaced by a single combined LCD, the integrated standby flight display (ISFD), which also became standard on the 747-400 in late 2003.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_21/747ER.pdf | title=Introducing the 747ER and 747 | date= January 2003 | publisher=Boeing Aero magazine}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2000s, as part of an effort to promote sustainable and alternative fuel development, as well as lower emissions, several 747-400 operators studied the use of oil extracted from the [[jatropha]] plant. [[Air New Zealand]] carried out the first commercial flight using jatropha oil for fuel; the airline's 747-400 had one engine burning a mix of 50% [[jatropha oil]] and 50% jet fuel for two hours during the flight while engineers collected data. [[Continental Airlines]] tested jatropha oil in one of its airliners on January 7, 2009.

As most 747-400s are now more than 20 years old, airlines are beginning to replace them. Airlines using the 747-400 have been retiring the model, replacing it with more fuel efficient aircraft. The main appeal of the 747-400 like its predecessors was its range rather than its capacity, and in most cases it has been replaced by wide-body twin-engine aircraft of similar range, such as the [[Boeing 777]] and [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]. The change in emphasis from hub and spoke operations to point-to-point flights has also reduced the need for jumbo jets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/boeing-747-heading-retirement/any-other-business/article/1360694|title=The Boeing 747 is heading for retirement|publisher=}}</ref> Airlines such as British Airways and Qantas that plan to maintain the same capacity on routes currently served by 747-400s ordered the [[Airbus A380]] rather than the updated [[Boeing 747-8|747-8]].\n\nFor example, Delta Air Lines reduced the number of flights it operated from the United States to [[Narita International Airport]] that were intended to transfer passengers to other destinations in Asia, switching to twin-engine widebody aircraft operating from an expanded hub at [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]].<ref>Schofield, Adriean, et al., Jumbos bow out, Aviation Week and Space Technology, September 15, 2014, pp. 21-22</ref> Total capacity was cut, but load factors improved. In April 2015, Delta announced it would accelerate the retirement of its 747-400s and replace them either with [[Airbus A330]] or [[Airbus A350 XWB|Airbus A350]] aircraft (both of which are twinjets). Delta could not keep the 747s full without deeply discounting ticket prices; the discounts and increased maintenance required of a four-engine aircraft led to a drag on profits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/042415/deltas-boeing-747s-are-flying-sunset-ba-dal-ual.aspx|title=Delta's Boeing 747s Are Flying Off Into the Sunset|publisher=Investopedia|date=April 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, economic weakness in air cargo markets has slowed demand for cargo conversions. Since the cost of replacing a 747-400 is high (an airline must purchase or lease another wide-body), some operators choose to fly the {{not a typo|747-400}} to the conclusion of its accepted useful life and then scrap it. The current parts resale value for this aircraft has been reduced to its engines. When a 26-year-old 747-400 owned by Delta flew through a violent hailstorm, the company indicated it was likely the aircraft would be scrapped. George Dimitroff, head of valuations for FlightGlobal, estimated the aircraft's value before the incident at about $8 million.

Winglets would provide minimal benefits on short-haul routes while adding extra weight and cost. The -400D may be converted to the long-range version if needed. The 747-400D can be distinguished from the otherwise similar-looking 747-300 by the extra windows on the upper deck.

The 747-400ER included the option of one or two additional {{cvt|3240|USgal|L}} body fuel tanks in the forward cargo hold, however, Qantas was the only customer that ordered the single body tank configuration, and no airplanes were delivered with dual body fuel tanks. Manufactured by [[Marshall Aerospace]], these tanks utilized metal to metal honeycomb-bonded technology to achieve a high fuel volume-to-dry weight ratio. The tanks feature a double wall, integrated venting system, and achieve fuel control via a modified Fuel System Management Card (FSMC) which optimizes fuel transfer into the Center Wing Tank (CWT) in flight along with the fuel transfer from the Horizontal Stabiliser Tank (HST). The tank is removable using tooling that interfaces with the cargo loading system. Similar technology has been used by Marshall in the development of body fuel tanks for the [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200LR]] and [[Boeing P-8A Poseidon]]. Other changes to the 747-400ER include the relocation of oxygen system components and the [[potable water]] system tanks and pumps, since the body fuel tanks prevent access to the standard locations.<ref name=\"auto\">Boeing Field Service Introduction Data 2012</ref>{{nonspecific|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe first 747-400ER was used as a test flight airplane and painted in Boeing colours, registration N747ER.

The flight test airplane was later refurbished, repainted in standard QANTAS livery, and registered as VH-OEE. Qantas was the only customer for the passenger version of the 747-400ER, chosen by the airline to allow for full loads between Melbourne and Los Angeles, particularly in the western direction.

The next month, the extended range (ER) passenger version entered service with [[Qantas]], the only airline ever to order the passenger version of the 747-400ER. Qantas initially used the 747-400ER for the Melbourne to Los Angeles and Dallas to Sydney route allowing the completion of the flight with full passenger load and cargo. Prior to the 747-400ER, Qantas would complete such flights by blocking out 'E' zone of the cabin and limiting passenger numbers and cargo. The 747-400ER featured the ''Boeing Signature Interior'', which was later made available on the 747-400 (either as a retrofit on existing 747-400s or factory installation on new frames).\n\nThe 747-400ER also introduced some flight deck enhancements, including [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs), which replaced the six [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) displays found on the Boeing {{not a typo|747-400}}. LCDs later became standard on the 747-400 as well, and could be retrofitted to earlier aircraft. The three standby flight displays found on the 747-400 were also replaced by a single combined LCD, the integrated standby flight display (ISFD), which also became standard on the 747-400 in late 2003.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_21/747ER.pdf | title=Introducing the 747ER and 747 | date= January 2003 | publisher=Boeing Aero magazine}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2000s, as part of an effort to promote sustainable and alternative fuel development, as well as lower emissions, several 747-400 operators studied the use of oil extracted from the [[jatropha]] plant. [[Air New Zealand]] carried out the first commercial flight using jatropha oil for fuel; the airline's 747-400 had one engine burning a mix of 50% [[jatropha oil]] and 50% jet fuel for two hours during the flight while engineers collected data.

As most 747-400s are now more than 20 years old, airlines are beginning to replace them. Airlines using the 747-400 have been retiring the model, replacing it with more fuel efficient aircraft. The main appeal of the 747-400 like its predecessors was its range rather than its capacity, and in most cases it has been replaced by wide-body twin-engine aircraft of similar range, such as the [[Boeing 777]] and [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]. The change in emphasis from hub and spoke operations to point-to-point flights has also reduced the need for jumbo jets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/boeing-747-heading-retirement/any-other-business/article/1360694|title=The Boeing 747 is heading for retirement|publisher=}}</ref> Airlines such as British Airways and Qantas that plan to maintain the same capacity on routes currently served by 747-400s ordered the [[Airbus A380]] rather than the updated [[Boeing 747-8|747-8]].\n\nFor example, Delta Air Lines reduced the number of flights it operated from the United States to [[Narita International Airport]] that were intended to transfer passengers to other destinations in Asia, switching to twin-engine widebody aircraft operating from an expanded hub at [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]].<ref>Schofield, Adriean, et al., Jumbos bow out, Aviation Week and Space Technology, September 15, 2014, pp. 21-22</ref> Total capacity was cut, but load factors improved. In April 2015, Delta announced it would accelerate the retirement of its 747-400s and replace them either with [[Airbus A330]] or [[Airbus A350 XWB|Airbus A350]] aircraft (both of which are twinjets). Delta could not keep the 747s full without deeply discounting ticket prices; the discounts and increased maintenance required of a four-engine aircraft led to a drag on profits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/042415/deltas-boeing-747s-are-flying-sunset-ba-dal-ual.aspx|title=Delta's Boeing 747s Are Flying Off Into the Sunset|publisher=Investopedia|date=April 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, economic weakness in air cargo markets has slowed demand for cargo conversions. Since the cost of replacing a 747-400 is high (an airline must purchase or lease another wide-body), some operators choose to fly the {{not a typo|747-400}} to the conclusion of its accepted useful life and then scrap it. The current parts resale value for this aircraft has been reduced to its engines. When a 26-year-old 747-400 owned by Delta flew through a violent hailstorm, the company indicated it was likely the aircraft would be scrapped. George Dimitroff, head of valuations for FlightGlobal, estimated the aircraft's value before the incident at about $8 million.

Major customers included [[Atlas Air]], Cargolux, [[China Airlines]], [[Korean Air]], [[Nippon Cargo Airlines]], [[Polar Air Cargo]], and [[Singapore Airlines]].\n\nThe 747-400F has a main deck nose door and a mechanized cargo handling system. The nose door swings up so that pallets or containers up to {{cvt|40|ft}} can be loaded straight in on motor-driven rollers.

The 747-400ER included the option of one or two additional {{cvt|3240|USgal|L}} body fuel tanks in the forward cargo hold, however, Qantas was the only customer that ordered the single body tank configuration, and no airplanes were delivered with dual body fuel tanks. Manufactured by [[Marshall Aerospace]], these tanks utilized metal to metal honeycomb-bonded technology to achieve a high fuel volume-to-dry weight ratio. The tanks feature a double wall, integrated venting system, and achieve fuel control via a modified Fuel System Management Card (FSMC) which optimizes fuel transfer into the Center Wing Tank (CWT) in flight along with the fuel transfer from the Horizontal Stabiliser Tank (HST). The tank is removable using tooling that interfaces with the cargo loading system. Similar technology has been used by Marshall in the development of body fuel tanks for the [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200LR]] and [[Boeing P-8A Poseidon]]. Other changes to the 747-400ER include the relocation of oxygen system components and the [[potable water]] system tanks and pumps, since the body fuel tanks prevent access to the standard locations.<ref name=\"auto\">Boeing Field Service Introduction Data 2012</ref>{{nonspecific|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe first 747-400ER was used as a test flight airplane and painted in Boeing colours, registration N747ER.
