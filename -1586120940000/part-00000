It is an important junction for both road and railroad.\n\n==History==\nThe community of ''Curtis Nova'' in 970 was donated by Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] to the monastery of St. Salvatore in [[Pavia]], becoming a castle around the year 1000.\n\nNovi was a  free [[medieval commune|commune]] until 1157, when it fell to [[Tortona]]. It was handed over the marquis of [[Montferrat]] in 1223, returning briefly to Tortona in 1232\u201364. In 1353 [[Giovanni Visconti (Archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni Visconti]] of [[Milan]] and [[Genoa]] conquered it. Novi was donated to the latter in 1392, but was occupied by the condottiero [[Facino Cane]] in 1409\u201312. In 1447, after the death of [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], the governors of the city decided to free forever from Milan, and gave it to Genoa. Around this time, a feudal lord Galeazzo [[Cavanna]] was Signore di Castel Gazzo, a fortress on the edge of the town. However, the Sforza of Milan retained its possession until the defeat of [[Ludovico il Moro]], when it passed to the French until [[Andrea Doria]] conquered the city for Genoa in 1529.\n\nNovi Ligure remained part of the Republic of Genoa until 1805, with the exception of a brief Austrian-Piedmontese occupation in 1745\u201346. In 1799 it was the site of a [[Battle of Novi (1799)|French defeat]] by an Austro-Russian army, in which the French commander [[Barth\u00e9lemy Catherine Joubert|Joubert]] was killed.\n\nNovi was annexed to the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and, after its fall, to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. In 1818 it became provincial capital and received the suffix of \"Ligure\" to mark the historical vicinity to Genoa in contrast to the annexion of the province to that of Alessandria.\n\n==Main sights==\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries Novi Ligure was a renowned resort for the rich Genoese families, as showed by the presence of numerous noble palaces in the historical center of the city, often decorated with frescoes facades. These include ''Palazzo Negroni'', ''Palazzo Durazzo'' and others. The most important palace is ''Palazzo Delle Piane'' (Delle Piane family), situated in the historic Piazza Delle Piane.\n\nThe ''Pieve of Santa Maria'', on the road for Cassano, is the most ancient religious building (12th century). It has a nave with two aisles, and apses from the original edifice. In the interior is a fresco (1474) by Manfredino Boxilio, portraying the then sovereign of Novi, Oriana di Campofregoso and saints.\n\nThe Oratory of St. Madeleine houses a massive cavalry composed of 21 wooden statues and two natural-size horses, as well as an 8-statuettes terracotta ''Complaint of Christ''. Both are from Renaissance.\n\nNovi has retained part of its walls, erected in 1447 and partly demolished in the 19th century, together with the tower of the Castle. The subterraneans can be visited in summer.\n\nThe ''Museo dei Campionissimi'' is a museum devoted to the two famous cyclists [[Costante Girardengo]] and [[Fausto Coppi]] and the bicycle history in general.\n\n==Economy==\nThe most important factory of the town is the group [[Elah-Dufour]] that produces Novi chocolate and [[Big Fruit]] candies.

It is an important junction for both road and railroad.\n\n==History==\nThe community of ''Curtis Nova'' in 970 was donated by Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] to the monastery of St. Salvatore in [[Pavia]], becoming a castle around the year 1000.\n\nNovi was a  free [[medieval commune|commune]] until 1157, when it fell to [[Tortona]]. It was handed over the marquis of [[Montferrat]] in 1223, returning briefly to Tortona in 1232\u201364. In 1353 [[Giovanni Visconti (Archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni Visconti]] of [[Milan]] and [[Genoa]] conquered it. Novi was donated to the latter in 1392, but was occupied by the condottiero [[Facino Cane]] in 1409\u201312. In 1447, after the death of [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], the governors of the city decided to free forever from Milan, and gave it to Genoa. Around this time, a feudal lord Galeazzo [[Cavanna]] was Signore di Castel Gazzo, a fortress on the edge of the town. However, the Sforza of Milan retained its possession until the defeat of [[Ludovico il Moro]], when it passed to the French until [[Andrea Doria]] conquered the city for Genoa in 1529.\n\nNovi Ligure remained part of the Republic of Genoa until 1805, with the exception of a brief Austrian-Piedmontese occupation in 1745\u201346. In 1799 it was the site of a [[Battle of Novi (1799)|French defeat]] by an Austro-Russian army, in which the French commander [[Barth\u00e9lemy Catherine Joubert|Joubert]] was killed.\n\nNovi was annexed to the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and, after its fall, to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. In 1818 it became provincial capital and received the suffix of \"Ligure\" to mark the historical vicinity to Genoa in contrast to the annexion of the province to that of Alessandria.\n\n==Main sights==\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries Novi Ligure was a renowned resort for the rich Genoese families, as showed by the presence of numerous noble palaces in the historical center of the city, often decorated with frescoes facades. These include ''Palazzo Negroni'', ''Palazzo Durazzo'' and others. The most important palace is ''Palazzo Delle Piane'' (Delle Piane family), situated in the historic Piazza Delle Piane.\n\nThe ''Pieve of Santa Maria'', on the road for Cassano, is the most ancient religious building (12th century). It has a nave with two aisles, and apses from the original edifice. In the interior is a fresco (1474) by Manfredino Boxilio, portraying the then sovereign of Novi, Oriana di Campofregoso and saints.\n\nThe Oratory of St. Madeleine houses a massive cavalry composed of 21 wooden statues and two natural-size horses, as well as an 8-statuettes terracotta ''Complaint of Christ''. Both are from Renaissance.\n\nNovi has retained part of its walls, erected in 1447 and partly demolished in the 19th century, together with the tower of the Castle. The subterraneans can be visited in summer.\n\nThe ''Museo dei Campionissimi'' is a museum devoted to the two famous cyclists [[Costante Girardengo]] and [[Fausto Coppi]] and the bicycle history in general.\n\n==Economy==\nThe most important factory of the town is the group [[Elah-Dufour]] that produces Novi chocolate and [[Big Fruit]] candies. Also in town is the famous chocolate factory Pernigotti, founded in 1860<ref>http://www.pernigotti.it/en/</ref>\n\nThe [[Garlando]] factory moved into the region in late 2002.\n\n==Notable Novesi==\n* [[Delle Piane family]]\n* [[Giorgio Jegher]] (1937-1997)\n* [[Costante Girardengo]] (1893\u20131978), ''professional cyclist''.\n\n==Sport==\nThe town\u2019s football club are:\n* [[U.S. Novese|Novese]], winner of a [[scudetto]] in the 1921-22 season\n* [[A.S.D.

A railroad was built in 1879, connecting Novato to [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma County]] and [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]].  The area around the train depot became known as ''New Town'', and forms the edge of what today is Old Town Novato.  The current depot was built in 1917, but closed in 1959, and is largely derelict. The depot consisted of two buildings: a warehouse and a station. The warehouse burned twice in the intervening years. Behind the rail station/warehouse complex was a grain and feed mill complex. The mill complex, along with the warehouse portion of the rail station, was torn down in late 2007 to make way for public parking and a Whole Foods/high-density housing development, while the derelict station is still standing.\n\nA Presbyterian church, still a landmark in Novato today, was built in 1896.  Until 2006, it housed a number of city offices, but was vacated that year due to safety concerns and condemned; the church has since been renovated. A new city center complex has been erected adjacent to the old City Hall.\n\nThe [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s had a marked effect on the area as many farmers lost their land.  After [[World War II]], Novato grew quickly with the construction of tract homes and a freeway.  As the area was unincorporated much of the growth was unplanned and uncontrolled.  Novato was finally [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a city in 1960.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofnovato.org/prcs/museum.cfm|title=Early Novato Area History|accessdate=December 6, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123040711/http://www.cityofnovato.org/prcs/museum.cfm|archivedate=November 23, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> One of the most important venues of the time (1960 to 1965) was \"Western Weekend\".

Stafford Lake to the west is a secondary water supply for Novato, with the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]] in Sonoma County to the north supplying most of the city's water.\nNovato includes ten Marin County Open Space District preserves: Mount Burdell, Rush Creek, Little Mountain, Verissimo Hills, Indian Tree, Deer Island, Indian Valley, Ignacio Valley, Loma Verde, and Pacheco Valle.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Novato6.jpg|thumb|right|280px| Doctor Insomniac's Coffee, a Historic Landmark.<ref>[http://focus.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/80000817 NATIONAL REGISTER DIGITAL ASSETS Fashion Shop and Stephen Porcella House]</ref> on Grant Avenue.]]\n[[File:Olompali State Park Burdell Barn 9 30 2012 (4).JPG|thumb|right|280px|Historic Landmark.<ref>[https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/73000409 NATIONAL REGISTER DIGITAL ASSETS Rancho Olompali]</ref> [[Rancho Olompali]] ]]\n[[File:Hamilton AFB HQ.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Historic Landmark.<ref>[https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/98001347 NATIONAL REGISTER DIGITAL ASSETS Hamilton Army Airfield]</ref> [[Hamilton Army Airfield]] ]]\n\nOfficial weather observations were taken at [[Hamilton Air Force Base]] through 1964.

A railroad was built in 1879, connecting Novato to [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma County]] and [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]].  The area around the train depot became known as ''New Town'', and forms the edge of what today is Old Town Novato.  The current depot was built in 1917, but closed in 1959, and is largely derelict. The depot consisted of two buildings: a warehouse and a station. The warehouse burned twice in the intervening years. Behind the rail station/warehouse complex was a grain and feed mill complex. The mill complex, along with the warehouse portion of the rail station, was torn down in late 2007 to make way for public parking and a Whole Foods/high-density housing development, while the derelict station is still standing.\n\nA Presbyterian church, still a landmark in Novato today, was built in 1896.  Until 2006, it housed a number of city offices, but was vacated that year due to safety concerns and condemned; the church has since been renovated. A new city center complex has been erected adjacent to the old City Hall.\n\nThe [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s had a marked effect on the area as many farmers lost their land.  After [[World War II]], Novato grew quickly with the construction of tract homes and a freeway.  As the area was unincorporated much of the growth was unplanned and uncontrolled.  Novato was finally [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a city in 1960.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofnovato.org/prcs/museum.cfm|title=Early Novato Area History|accessdate=December 6, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123040711/http://www.cityofnovato.org/prcs/museum.cfm|archivedate=November 23, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> One of the most important venues of the time (1960 to 1965) was \"Western Weekend\".
