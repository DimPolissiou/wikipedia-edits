The Alexandrine Sinodos was re-discovered in the 19th century: a [[Bohairic|Bohairic Coptic]] version was published in 1848 by Tattam, the earlier [[Sahidic|Sahidic Coptic]] version was published in 1883 by [[Paul de Lagarde]], the [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] versions in 1904 by [[George William Horner]]. The text found in the Sahidic version was named by the publishers ''Egyptian Church Order'' and corresponds to what is now usually known as ''Apostolic Tradition''.\n\nThe text was also found in the late 5th century [[Latin]] manuscript known as [[Verona Palimpsest]], where it is the third item in the collection. This version was published in 1900 by [[Edmund Hauler]], but only just over half of the Apostolic Tradition section was preserved.\n\nA much earlier Ethiopic version translated directly from the Greek around the late 5th century, was discovered in Ethiopia in 1999 in a 13th-century, or earlier, manuscript, amongst the works in a compendium of synodical materials, known as the 'Aksumite Collection'. This version survives complete, albeit that it adds selected further material (taken from the [[Didache]] and [[Didascalia]]) before the concluding chapter 43.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alessandro |last=Bausi |title='La nuova versione etiopica della Traditio Apostolica' in Buzi and Camplani eds., Christianity in Egypt: Literary production and intellectual trends |year=2012 |publisher=Institutum Patristicum Augustinianum | pages=19\u201369 }}</ref>  The text transmitted in the Aksumite Collection lacks the [[Anaphora of the Apostolic Tradition]] from Chapter 4; as this material is substantially duplicated in the Ethiopic [[Anaphora of the Apostles]], which is recorded within a compendium of liturgical prayers elsewhere in the Collection.   \n\nChapter 36<ref>cod. Ochrid 86 f. 192 of National Museum of Ochrid, and gr. 900 f. 112 of National Museum of Paris</ref> of the probable [[Koine Greek|Greek]] original text was identified in 1975<ref>M. Richard, ''Opera minora'', I, Leuven-Tournhout 1976, pages 52-53</ref> as one item in a florilegium of patristic fragments.  In 1964, the Greek text of the prayer over the oils in Chapter 5 was recognised in an eleventh or twelfth century manuscript liturgy for the anointing of the sick, preserved in the monastery of St Catherine at Mount Sinai.   \n\nThe surviving Bohairic and Arabic versions are translations of the Sahidic, which was itself translated from a Greek manuscript around the 9th century. The later Ethiopic version is a translation of a different, and more complete, medieval Arabic version; although even before the discovery of the Aksumite Collection manuscript, it was apparent that the later Ethiopic text had been corrected in places with reference to an independent witness to the Greek. For sections witnessed in both texts, the Latin and Aksumite Ethiopic versions (which are both strictly literal) translate closely similar Greek undertexts of 4th century date; while the base text Greek for the Sahidic version is substantially revised and later.  The Aksumite Ethiopic and Latin versions differ, however, in their concluding sections.  In the Latin version a concluding chapter, and part of a previous chapter on occasions for private prayer are then found repeated in a modified and expanded form in a second ending of the text; and a similar duplication is also, partly, witnessed in the Sahidic version. For the Greek text underlying the Aksumite Ethiopic version there is only one ending, which corresponds to the second conclusion of the Latin, without any preceding duplication.  Otherwise however, the Greek text underlying the Aksumite Ethiopic appears to have been marginally better than the text underlying the Latin version; but, of course, the much later date of the one surviving manuscript witness to the Aksumite Ethiopic implies a higher risk of accumulated copying errors of transmission.\n\n=== Derived Works ===\n\nThe Apostolic Tradition is amongst the earliest Church Orders to achieve widespread acceptance and circulation; and consequently many subsequent Church Orders, especially in the East, are expansions or adaptations of it.  Hence, where the text in the versions may be unclear, missing or widely variant, it is sometimes possible to discern the most likely reading of the original Greek from consideration of counterpart passages one or more of these works.  The main derived works are:\n\n* 'The [[Canons of Hippolytus]]'. An extensive reworking and adaptation of the Apostolic Tradition made in Egypt in the 4th century.  It now survives only in an Arabic version, which translates a Sahidic translation of a Greek original.\n* '[[Testamentum Domini|Testament of the Lord]]'. Probably originating in Syria in the 4th or 5th century and extant in Syriac; this is an original composition, but one which makes extensive use of the Apostolic Tradition in parts.\n* 'The Eighth Book of the [[Apostolic Constitutions]]' The Apostolic Constitutions is a compendium of reworked Church Order materials, in which the Eighth Book depends on the Apostolic Tradition.  The Eighth Book is also transmitted in an ''[[epitome]]'', or summary, of 5th century date; which has considerable independent value as a source, as the epitomator returned to the Greek text of the Apostolic Tradition itself for some of the liturgical prayers.  Consequently, there are several chapters of the Apostolic Tradition for which this epitome provides a Greek text; albeit one that is later and more heavily modified than is the source Greek text for the Latin and Aksumite Ethiopic versions.\n\n== Editions and publications ==\n\nProducing a critical edition of a work that survives in several versions, of which none are in the original language, is highly problematic.  Clearly the edition has to be a translation; but which language should be used as the common version?  And should the editor try to recover something close to the 'original' text; or rather to produce the best text for one or another of the surviving versions?\n\nThe first comprehensive critical editions were those of [[Gregory Dix]] in 1937,<ref>[[Gregory Dix]] ''The Treatise on the Apostolic Tradition of St. Hippolytus of Rome'' London 1937, reprinted with correction by Alban Press, 1995 {{ISBN|978-0-7007-0232-9}}</ref> and then in 1946 by B. Botte.<ref>B. Botte, ''La Tradition Apostolique de S. Hippolyte'', SChr 11, Paris 1946</ref>  Dix and Botte both attempted to recover an 'original' text of the 3rd century; but translated into English and French respectively.  Since then, G. Cuming prepared a student edition in English in 1976; taking the rather different approach of seeking to translate one of the versions; while Paul Bradshaw et al. have prepared a commentary in 2002 in which all versions are translated in synoptic columns, with no attempt to establish a primary text.  Indeed, Bradshaw maintains that, as 'living literature' the Apostolic Tradition cannot be regarded as ever having had a single primary text.\n\nThe more conservative approach of Dix and Botte has more recently been represented in the translation by Alistair Stewart.  For the first edition in 2001, Stewart selected eclectically for each chapter, the version that looked to have the best text; and then translated that, with correction from the others.  This approach has been criticised as implying a 'standard' text, when there was then no evidence that such a normative text had ever existed.  The discovery of the Aksumite Ethiopic version - especially in respect of its close relationship with the Latin version in those sections where both are witnessed - is claimed by Stewart as demonstrating (at least for the 4th century) that at one time a 'standard' complete text did indeed circulate, however much this may have been adjusted and reordered in later versions and derived works.  Stewart's second edition of 2015 mainly takes the Latin version as its base text; and translates the Aksumite Ethiopic for the most part for those chapters not witnessed in the Latin.\n\n== Date and place of composition ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\nThe context for the Church Order represented in the Apostolic Tradition is one where Christians face official persecution, are regularly imprisoned for their faith and occasionally face martyrdom. All Christian worship takes place within private houses. Prospective new converts are assumed to be all adults, and are to be questioned initially by a 'teacher' in private before being introduced to the Christian congregation (certain categories of trades and professions being prohibited admission); but baptism is also extended to children and infants in newcoming families. Regular worship includes not only a weekly [[eucharist]], but also a shared fellowship meal, or [[agape feast]]. Ecstatic prophecy is occasionally encountered in worship. All of these observations confirm a date in the 3rd century or earlier.\n\nThe wide range of forbidden trades specified (as for example, charioteers), confirm a place of composition in one of the two major urban centres of the Roman Empire, Rome itself, or Alexandria.  Particular provisions in the Church Order relate to local practices which identify this place as Rome; specifically that the dead are buried in catacombs sealed into shelves with tiles; and also the stipulation that, in the regular Sunday eucharist, portions of the bread consecrated by the bishop are to be broken off by deacons and carried by them to presbyters in other churches in the city, wrapped in napkins.\n\nRecent scholarship, such as that by Bradshaw<ref name=\"Bradshaw\"/> and Johnson<ref name=\"Hermeneia\" />, has called into question the degree to which the liturgical texts witnessed in the Apostolic Tradition may be taken as representing the regular forms of worship in Rome in the 3rd century.  They propose that, over the centuries, later and non-Roman liturgical forms have accumulated within an older, and substantially Roman, Church Order.\n\n== Title ==\n\nNone of the manuscript versions carry a title, and so there is no direct evidence as to how the 'Apostolic Tradition' was originally known.  The quotation of chapter 36 in the Ochrid fragment is labelled, ''Diataxis (Ordinances) of the Holy Apostles: Given through Hippolytus''; and this has been plausibly suggested as the probable title under which the whole text of the Apostolic Tradition circulated in Syria.<ref name=\"Peretto\">{{cite book|first=Elio |last=Peretto |title=Tradizione Apostolica |year=1996 |isbn=88-311-3133-8 | pages=27}}</ref> The Epitome of the eighth book of the Apostolic Constitutions refers to ''Regulations of the Holy Apostles concerning ordination through Hippolytus'', which could be an expansion on the same title.\n\nThe commonly used title; 'Apostolic Tradition' depends on identifying this work with an item on a list inscribed on a statue - once thought to be of Hippolytus - now in the Vatican Library.  Aside from the statue certainly not depicting Hippolytus (as it was originally female), there is no clear evidence for the inscribed list as being proposed to comprise Hippolytus's works.  Alistair Stewart points out that 'Apostolic Tradition' denotes a genre rather than a particular work; as all Church Orders aspire to convey Apostolic Tradition.  He also points out that the title on the statue ought properly to be read over two lines; which could then be rendered as ''On Spiritual Gifts; the Apostolic Tradition''.  This could indeed well be the title of this work, as the first sentence of the current first chapter states \"Those things then, concerning spiritual gifts which are worthy of note, we have set forth.\"  On the face of it, this would imply an earlier, lost, section, setting out how God creates spiritual gifts within individual believers, as a prelude to the surviving initial discussion of rites of appointment and ordination.\n\n==Attribution to Hippolytus==\n[[File:HippolytusStatue.JPG|upright=1.2|thumb|[[Ancient Roman|Roman]] sculpture, maybe of [[Hippolytus of Rome]], found in 1551 and used for the attribution of the Apostolic Tradition]]\nThe section of the [[Alexandrine Sinodos]], rediscovered in the 19th century, which was given the name of ''Egyptian Church Order'', was identified with the lost ''Apostolic Tradition'' presumed by [[Hippolytus of Rome]] by Edward von der Goltz in 1906<ref>Edward von der Goltz, ''Unbekannte Fragmente altchristicher Gemeindeordnungen'' in Sitzungsberichte der Preussichen Akademie der Wissenschaten'' 1906 pp 141-57</ref> and later by [[Eduard Schwartz]] in 1910<ref>Eduard Schawartz, ''Uber dei pseudoapostolischen Kinrchenordnungen'' Trubner, Strasbourg 1910</ref> and by R.H.

On one side of the seat was carved in Greek a [[paschal cycle]], which remembered the one attributed to Hyppolitus, and on the other side the titles of numerous writings, some of them by Hippolytus, and one named ''\"On the [[charismata]] - Apostolic Tradition\"''. This brought the scholars to presume the existence of a writing named Apostolic Tradition by Hippolytus. Recent research on this statue arrives at a different conclusion.\n* the name Hippolytus is present in later [[Ancient Church Orders]] clearly derived by the text of the Apostolic Tradition, the [[Canons of Hippolytus]] and [[Apostolic Constitutions#Epitome of the eighth book|The Constitutions through Hippolytus]].\n* the term ''\"Apostolic Tradition\"'' itself is found in both the first and last page of the text.\n\nThe attribution of the Apostolic Tradition to Hippolytus of Rome have been recently under heavy attack.<ref name=\"Oxford\">{{cite book|first1=Susan |last1=Ashbrook Harvey |first2=David G. |last2= Hunter |title=The Oxford handbook of early Christian studies |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-19-927156-6 |publisher=Oxford University Press | url= https://books.google.it/books?id=0-ovhYLJkRYC&lpg=PA430&pg=PA430#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=430}}</ref> Thus according to recent scholars the Apostolic Tradition is, or a work written by another priest named Hippolytus but lived probably in [[Alexandria]],<ref>J.M.

The statue was very probably carved as a copy of a famous statue of [[Themista of Lampsacus]], a woman. The list of engraved titles includes many works which are not by Hippolytus, while it lacks most of the works surely ascribable to him. This sculpture was probably placed in the ancient library of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] personifying one of the sciences and the engraved list could be the catalog of volumes kept nearby, a common use in Ancient Rome;<ref>[[Margherita Guarducci]], in ''Ricerche su Ippolito'', Volume 13 of Studia ephemeridis \"Augustinianum\", Institutum patristicum Augustinianum, Roma 1977, pag 17-30</ref>\n*the title engraved on the statue refers to also to [[charismata]], but the Apostolic Tradition does not deal with this argument;\n*the name \u201cHippolytus\u201d is found in transmission of the Church Orders only about one century and half after his death;<ref name=\"Oxford\"/>\n*the reference to Hippolytus and to a tradition coming from the Apostles in later Church Orders can be easily explained with the high level of [[pseudepigraph]]y typical of this genre;\n*the probable original title of this treatise was discovered in 1975 on a Greek fragment and it is not the one engraved in the statue's basement;<ref>J. Magne, ''Tradition apostolique sur les charismes et Diataxeis des saints Apostoles'', Paris 1975</ref>\n*the form of liturgy it describes are quite different from the other information we have about the Christian uses in ancient Rome and are by far more in line with the forms of Church life in [[Alexandria]] or in [[Syria]].\n\n==Content==\nThe Apostolic Tradition, as the other Church Orders, has the aim to offer authoritative \"apostolic\" prescriptions on matters of moral conduct, [[liturgy]] and [[Canon law|Church organization]]. It can be divided in a [[prologue]] (chapter 1) and three main sections. The chapter numbers and order are those of Botte.\n\nThe first section, chapters 2 to 14, deals with the rituals of the organization of the Church, and it follows a hierarchical order starting from the bishops up to the lower levels of the structure. The content can be so summarized:\n* chapter 1: (Prologue)\n* chapter 2: 'On bishops'\n* chapters 3: 'Prayer for the [[ordination]] of a [[bishop]]';\n* chapter 4: (the [[Eucharist]] at the consecration of the bishop. It is the well-known [[Anaphora of the Apostolic Tradition]]);\n* chapter 5: 'On the offering of oil';\n* chapter 5: (on the offering of cheese and olives);\n* chapter 7: 'On [[presbyter]]s';\n* chapter 8: 'On [[deacon]]s';\n* chapter 9: 'On [[Confessor of the Faith|confessors]]';\n* chapter 10: 'On widows';\n* chapters 11: 'On the [[reader (liturgy)|reader]]';\n* chapter 12: 'On virgins';\n* chapter 13: 'On subdeacons'\n* chapter 14: 'On a [[Spiritual gift]]'.\n\nThe second section, chapters 15 to 21, is about the [[catechumenate]] and the [[baptism]];\n* chapter 15: 'On newcomers'; the first step in the catechumenate: the questions about marriage status and whether they are slave or free;\n* chapter 16: 'On trades and professions'; the questions about occupation and moral conduct. Some works are not considered compatible with the Christian life: these works include a manager of prostitutes, the sculptor or painter of idols, actors in the theater, teacher of \"worldly knowledge\" children (unless needed as the primary occupation), and a charioteer or [[gladiator]] in the gladiator competitions. Restrictions on military action are enumerated.\n* chapter 17: 'On the time during which they will hear the word after crafts and professions'; the length of the preliminary instruction, about three years;\n* chapter 18: 'On the prayer of the catechumens';\n* chapter 19: 'On laying hands on the catechumens';the ritual at the end of the preliminary instruction;\n* chapter 20: 'Of those who will receive baptism'; the final examination and the preparation in the days before the baptism;\n* chapter 21: 'On the bestowal of holy baptism'; the detailed description of the baptismal liturgy.\n\nThe last section, chapters 22 to 43, is a compilation of rules about the community, listed without a clear order:\n* chapter 22: (about the distribution of the [[Eucharist|Communion]]);\n* chapter 23: 'On [[fasting]]';\n* chapter 24: 'On gifts to the sick'; 'That those who receive should serve with haste'; about the distribution of the Communion to sick persons;\n* chapter 25: 'On the bringing in of lights at the supper of the congregation';\n* chapter 26: 'On the occasion of eating'; description of a liturgical dinner;\n* chapter 27: 'That catechumens should not eat with the faithful'\n* chapter 28: 'That one should eat with understanding and moderation'\n* chapter 29: 'That one should eat with thanksgiving'\n* chapter 30: 'On supper for widows';\n* chapter 31: 'On the fruits which it is right to offer';\n* chapter 32: 'On the blessing of fruits'; (about the offering to the bishop of the first-fruits);\n* chapter 33: 'That nobody should touch any food at the Pascha before the proper time;\n* chapter 34: 'That it is proper for deacons to attend on the bishop';\n* chapter 35: 'On the time when it is proper to pray';\n* chapter 36: 'That it is proper to partake of the Eucharist first, before anything else is consumed';\n* chapter 37: 'That it is proper to guard the Eucharist carefully';\n* chapter 38: 'That it is improper than anything should be allowed to fall from the cup:\n* chapter 39: (everyday meetings of presbyters and deacons);\n* chapter 40: 'On the cemeteries;\n* chapter 41: 'On the time when it is proper to pray';\n* chapter 42: (about the [[Sign of the Cross]]);\n* chapter 43: (conclusion).\n\n==Influence==\nThe text of the Apostolic Tradition was part of three main ancient collections of the Church Orders, the [[Alexandrine Sinodos]], the Aksumite Collection and the [[Verona Palimpsest]]. Being included in the Alexandrine Sinodos, it was held to be authoritative in [[Asia Minor]], Syria, Egypt and [[Ethiopia]], where it was copied and re-edited.\n\nThe Apostolic Tradition was also used as basis for great part of the eighth book of the [[Apostolic Constitutions]], which had a great diffusion in antiquity. Also the ancient [[Canons of Hippolytus]], [[Testamentum Domini]] and [[Apostolic Constitutions#Epitome|Epitome of the eighth Book of the Apostolic Constitutions]] derive from it.\n\nThe text of the Apostolic Tradition, believed to be authentically a work describing the early 3rd century [[Roman liturgy]], has been widely influential on [[liturgical]] scholarship in the twentieth century and it was one of the pillars of the [[liturgical movement]]. The anaphora included in chapter four was extensively used in preparing reforms for the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and the United Methodist Liturgies found in the current [[United Methodist]] Hymnal. This anaphora is also the inspiration for the Eucharistic Prayer n. II of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Mass of Paul VI]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adoremus.org/9-11-96-FolsomEuch.html |title=From One Eucharistic Prayer to Many |author=Father Cassian Folsom, O.S.B. |year=1996 |work=Adoremus Bulletin Vol. II, Nos. 4 - 6 : September - November 1996 |accessdate=28 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100917055701/http://adoremus.org/9-11-96-FolsomEuch.html| archivedate= 17 September 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe Roman Catholic prayer of ordination of bishops, renewed after the [[Second Vatican Council]], has been re-written and based on the one included in the Apostolic Tradition.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote|Hippolytus of Rome}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708082106/http://www.bombaxo.com/hippolytus.html The Apostolic Tradition of Hippolytus of Rome]\n*[https://unito.academia.edu/AndreaNicolotti/Papers/566439/Che_cose_la_Traditio_apostolica_di_Ippolito_In_margine_ad_una_recente_pubblicazione_in_Rivista_di_Storia_del_Cristianesimo_II_1_2005_pp._219-237 Che cos'\u00e8 la Traditio Apostolica] of Andrea Nicolotti, from \u00abRivista di Storia del Cristianesimo\u00bb II/1 (2005), pp.&nbsp;219\u2013237.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:4th-century Christian texts]]\n[[Category:Ancient Church Orders]]\n[[Category:Christianity in Rome]]\n[[Category:Texts in Koine Greek]]\n[[Category:Italian manuscripts]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the third century Christian text|the deposit of faith on which some churches' dogma is based|Sacred Tradition}}\nThe '''Apostolic Tradition''' (or ''Egyptian Church Order'') is an early [[Christianity|Christian]] treatise which belongs to the [[genre]] of the [[Ancient Church Orders|Church Orders]].

The Alexandrine Sinodos was re-discovered in the 19th century: a [[Bohairic|Bohairic Coptic]] version was published in 1848 by Tattam, the earlier [[Sahidic|Sahidic Coptic]] version was published in 1883 by [[Paul de Lagarde]], the [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] versions in 1904 by [[George William Horner]]. The text found in the Sahidic version was named by the publishers ''Egyptian Church Order'' and corresponds to what is now usually known as ''Apostolic Tradition''.\n\nThe text was also found in the late 5th century [[Latin]] manuscript known as [[Verona Palimpsest]], where it is the third item in the collection. This version was published in 1900 by [[Edmund Hauler]], but only just over half of the Apostolic Tradition section was preserved.\n\nA much earlier Ethiopic version translated directly from the Greek around the late 5th century, was discovered in Ethiopia in 1999 in a 13th-century, or earlier, manuscript, amongst the works in a compendium of synodical materials, known as the 'Aksumite Collection'. This version survives complete, albeit that it adds selected further material (taken from the [[Didache]] and [[Didascalia]]) before the concluding chapter 43.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alessandro |last=Bausi |title='La nuova versione etiopica della Traditio Apostolica' in Buzi and Camplani eds., Christianity in Egypt: Literary production and intellectual trends |year=2012 |publisher=Institutum Patristicum Augustinianum | pages=19\u201369 }}</ref>  The text transmitted in the Aksumite Collection lacks the [[Anaphora of the Apostolic Tradition]] from Chapter 4; as this material is substantially duplicated in the Ethiopic [[Anaphora of the Apostles]], which is recorded within a compendium of liturgical prayers elsewhere in the Collection.   \n\nChapter 36<ref>cod. Ochrid 86 f. 192 of National Museum of Ochrid, and gr. 900 f. 112 of National Museum of Paris</ref> of the probable [[Koine Greek|Greek]] original text was identified in 1975<ref>M. Richard, ''Opera minora'', I, Leuven-Tournhout 1976, pages 52-53</ref> as one item in a florilegium of patristic fragments.  In 1964, the Greek text of the prayer over the oils in Chapter 5 was recognised in an eleventh or twelfth century manuscript liturgy for the anointing of the sick, preserved in the monastery of St Catherine at Mount Sinai.   \n\nThe surviving Bohairic and Arabic versions are translations of the Sahidic, which was itself translated from a Greek manuscript around the 9th century. The later Ethiopic version is a translation of a different, and more complete, medieval Arabic version; although even before the discovery of the Aksumite Collection manuscript, it was apparent that the later Ethiopic text had been corrected in places with reference to an independent witness to the Greek. For sections witnessed in both texts, the Latin and Aksumite Ethiopic versions (which are both strictly literal) translate closely similar Greek undertexts of 4th century date; while the base text Greek for the Sahidic version is substantially revised and later.  The Aksumite Ethiopic and Latin versions differ, however, in their concluding sections.  In the Latin version a concluding chapter, and part of a previous chapter on occasions for private prayer are then found repeated in a modified and expanded form in a second ending of the text; and a similar duplication is also, partly, witnessed in the Sahidic version. For the Greek text underlying the Aksumite Ethiopic version there is only one ending, which corresponds to the second conclusion of the Latin, without any preceding duplication.  Otherwise however, the Greek text underlying the Aksumite Ethiopic appears to have been marginally better than the text underlying the Latin version; but, of course, the much later date of the one surviving manuscript witness to the Aksumite Ethiopic implies a higher risk of accumulated copying errors of transmission.\n\n=== Derived Works ===\n\nThe Apostolic Tradition is amongst the earliest Church Orders to achieve widespread acceptance and circulation; and consequently many subsequent Church Orders, especially in the East, are expansions or adaptations of it.  Hence, where the text in the versions may be unclear, missing or widely variant, it is sometimes possible to discern the most likely reading of the original Greek from consideration of counterpart passages one or more of these works.  The main derived works are:\n\n* 'The [[Canons of Hippolytus]]'. An extensive reworking and adaptation of the Apostolic Tradition made in Egypt in the 4th century.  It now survives only in an Arabic version, which translates a Sahidic translation of a Greek original.\n* '[[Testamentum Domini|Testament of the Lord]]'. Probably originating in Syria in the 4th or 5th century and extant in Syriac; this is an original composition, but one which makes extensive use of the Apostolic Tradition in parts.\n* 'The Eighth Book of the [[Apostolic Constitutions]]' The Apostolic Constitutions is a compendium of reworked Church Order materials, in which the Eighth Book depends on the Apostolic Tradition.  The Eighth Book is also transmitted in an ''[[epitome]]'', or summary, of 5th century date; which has considerable independent value as a source, as the epitomator returned to the Greek text of the Apostolic Tradition itself for some of the liturgical prayers.  Consequently, there are several chapters of the Apostolic Tradition for which this epitome provides a Greek text; albeit one that is later and more heavily modified than is the source Greek text for the Latin and Aksumite Ethiopic versions.\n\n== Editions and publications ==\n\nProducing a critical edition of a work that survives in several versions, of which none are in the original language, is highly problematic.  Clearly the edition has to be a translation; but which language should be used as the common version?  And should the editor try to recover something close to the 'original' text; or rather to produce the best text for one or another of the surviving versions?\n\nThe first comprehensive critical editions were those of [[Gregory Dix]] in 1937,<ref>[[Gregory Dix]] ''The Treatise on the Apostolic Tradition of St. Hippolytus of Rome'' London 1937, reprinted with correction by Alban Press, 1995 {{ISBN|978-0-7007-0232-9}}</ref> and then in 1946 by B. Botte.<ref>B. Botte, ''La Tradition Apostolique de S. Hippolyte'', SChr 11, Paris 1946</ref>  Dix and Botte both attempted to recover an 'original' text of the 3rd century; but translated into English and French respectively.  Since then, G. Cuming prepared a student edition in English in 1976; taking the rather different approach of seeking to translate one of the versions; while Paul Bradshaw et al. have prepared a commentary in 2002 in which all versions are translated in synoptic columns, with no attempt to establish a primary text.  Indeed, Bradshaw maintains that, as 'living literature' the Apostolic Tradition cannot be regarded as ever having had a single primary text.\n\nThe more conservative approach of Dix and Botte has more recently been represented in the translation by Alistair Stewart.  For the first edition in 2001, Stewart selected eclectically for each chapter, the version that looked to have the best text; and then translated that, with correction from the others.  This approach has been criticised as implying a 'standard' text, when there was then no evidence that such a normative text had ever existed.  The discovery of the Aksumite Ethiopic version - especially in respect of its close relationship with the Latin version in those sections where both are witnessed - is claimed by Stewart as demonstrating (at least for the 4th century) that at one time a 'standard' complete text did indeed circulate, however much this may have been adjusted and reordered in later versions and derived works.  Stewart's second edition of 2015 mainly takes the Latin version as its base text; and translates the Aksumite Ethiopic for the most part for those chapters not witnessed in the Latin.\n\n== Date and place of composition ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\nThe context for the Church Order represented in the Apostolic Tradition is one where Christians face official persecution, are regularly imprisoned for their faith and occasionally face martyrdom. All Christian worship takes place within private houses. Prospective new converts are assumed to be all adults, and are to be questioned initially by a 'teacher' in private before being introduced to the Christian congregation (certain categories of trades and professions being prohibited admission); but baptism is also extended to children and infants in newcoming families. Regular worship includes not only a weekly [[eucharist]], but also a shared fellowship meal, or [[agape feast]]. Ecstatic prophecy is occasionally encountered in worship. All of these observations confirm a date in the 3rd century or earlier.\n\nThe wide range of forbidden trades specified (as for example, charioteers), confirm a place of composition in one of the two major urban centres of the Roman Empire, Rome itself, or Alexandria.  Particular provisions in the Church Order relate to local practices which identify this place as Rome; specifically that the dead are buried in catacombs sealed into shelves with tiles; and also the stipulation that, in the regular Sunday eucharist, portions of the bread consecrated by the bishop are to be broken off by deacons and carried by them to presbyters in other churches in the city, wrapped in napkins.\n\nRecent scholarship, such as that by Bradshaw<ref name=\"Bradshaw\"/> and Johnson<ref name=\u201cHermeneia\" />, has called into question the degree to which the liturgical texts witnessed in the Apostolic Tradition may be taken as representing the regular forms of worship in Rome in the 3rd century.  They propose that, over the centuries, later and non-Roman liturgical forms have accumulated within an older, and substantially Roman, Church Order.\n\n== Title ==\n\nNone of the manuscript versions carry a title, and so there is no direct evidence as to how the 'Apostolic Tradition' was originally known.  The quotation of chapter 36 in the Ochrid fragment is labelled, ''Diataxis (Ordinances) of the Holy Apostles: Given through Hippolytus''; and this has been plausibly suggested as the probable title under which the whole text of the Apostolic Tradition circulated in Syria.<ref name=\"Peretto\">{{cite book|first=Elio |last=Peretto |title=Tradizione Apostolica |year=1996 |isbn=88-311-3133-8 | pages=27}}</ref> The Epitome of the eighth book of the Apostolic Constitutions refers to ''Regulations of the Holy Apostles concerning ordination through Hippolytus'', which could be an expansion on the same title.\n\nThe commonly used title; 'Apostolic Tradition' depends on identifying this work with an item on a list inscribed on a statue - once thought to be of Hippolytus - now in the Vatican Library.  Aside from the statue certainly not depicting Hippolytus (as it was originally female), there is no clear evidence for the inscribed list as being proposed to comprise Hippolytus's works.  Alistair Stewart points out that 'Apostolic Tradition' denotes a genre rather than a particular work; as all Church Orders aspire to convey Apostolic Tradition.  He also points out that the title on the statue ought properly to be read over two lines; which could then be rendered as ''On Spiritual Gifts; the Apostolic Tradition''.  This could indeed well be the title of this work, as the first sentence of the current first chapter states \"Those things then, concerning spiritual gifts which are worthy of note, we have set forth.\"  On the face of it, this would imply an earlier, lost, section, setting out how God creates spiritual gifts within individual believers, as a prelude to the surviving initial discussion of rites of appointment and ordination.\n\n==Attribution to Hippolytus==\n[[File:HippolytusStatue.JPG|upright=1.2|thumb|[[Ancient Roman|Roman]] sculpture, maybe of [[Hippolytus of Rome]], found in 1551 and used for the attribution of the Apostolic Tradition]]\nThe section of the [[Alexandrine Sinodos]], rediscovered in the 19th century, which was given the name of ''Egyptian Church Order'', was identified with the lost ''Apostolic Tradition'' presumed by [[Hippolytus of Rome]] by Edward von der Goltz in 1906<ref>Edward von der Goltz, ''Unbekannte Fragmente altchristicher Gemeindeordnungen'' in Sitzungsberichte der Preussichen Akademie der Wissenschaten'' 1906 pp 141-57</ref> and later by [[Eduard Schwartz]] in 1910<ref>Eduard Schawartz, ''Uber dei pseudoapostolischen Kinrchenordnungen'' Trubner, Strasbourg 1910</ref> and by R.H.

The attribution to Hippolytus was based on following data:<ref name=\"Recontructing\">{{cite book|first=Paul F. |last=Bradshaw |title=Reconstructing early Christian worship |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-281-06094-8 |publisher=SPCK |authorlink=Paul F. Bradshaw| pages=47\u201351}}</ref>\n* in 1551 [[Pirro Ligorio]] found an [[ancient Roman]] marble statue of a seated figure near [[Campo Verano]] in [[Rome]] and moved it to the [[Vatican Library]] where it still is. On one side of the seat was carved in Greek a [[paschal cycle]], which remembered the one attributed to Hyppolitus, and on the other side the titles of numerous writings, some of them by Hippolytus, and one named ''\"On the [[charismata]] - Apostolic Tradition\"''. This brought the scholars to presume the existence of a writing named Apostolic Tradition by Hippolytus. Recent research on this statue arrives at a different conclusion.\n* the name Hippolytus is present in later [[Ancient Church Orders]] clearly derived by the text of the Apostolic Tradition, the [[Canons of Hippolytus]] and [[Apostolic Constitutions#Epitome of the eighth book|The Constitutions through Hippolytus]].\n* the term ''\"Apostolic Tradition\"'' itself is found in both the first and last page of the text.\n\nThe attribution of the Apostolic Tradition to Hippolytus of Rome have been recently under heavy attack.<ref name=\"Oxford\">{{cite book|first1=Susan |last1=Ashbrook Harvey |first2=David G. |last2= Hunter |title=The Oxford handbook of early Christian studies |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-19-927156-6 |publisher=Oxford University Press | url= https://books.google.it/books?id=0-ovhYLJkRYC&lpg=PA430&pg=PA430#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=430}}</ref> Thus according to recent scholars the Apostolic Tradition is, or a work written by another priest named Hippolytus but lived probably in [[Alexandria]],<ref>J.M. Hanssens, ''La liturgie d'Hippolyte. Ses documents, son titulaire, ses origines et son caractere'', Orientalia Christiana Analecta 155, Roma 1965</ref> or it contains material of separate sources ranging from the middle second to the fourth century.<ref name=\"Hermeneia\"/> The reasons given to support this understanding are the following:\n*the statue found in 1551 was without head, and the present bearded head was added later by Ligorio himself. The statue was very probably carved as a copy of a famous statue of [[Themista of Lampsacus]], a woman. The list of engraved titles includes many works which are not by Hippolytus, while it lacks most of the works surely ascribable to him. This sculpture was probably placed in the ancient library of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] personifying one of the sciences and the engraved list could be the catalog of volumes kept nearby, a common use in Ancient Rome;<ref>[[Margherita Guarducci]], in ''Ricerche su Ippolito'', Volume 13 of Studia ephemeridis \"Augustinianum\", Institutum patristicum Augustinianum, Roma 1977, pag 17-30</ref>\n*the title engraved on the statue refers to also to [[charismata]], but the Apostolic Tradition does not deal with this argument;\n*the name \u201cHippolytus\u201d is found in transmission of the Church Orders only about one century and half after his death;<ref name=\"Oxford\"/>\n*the reference to Hippolytus and to a tradition coming from the Apostles in later Church Orders can be easily explained with the high level of [[pseudepigraph]]y typical of this genre;\n*the probable original title of this treatise was discovered in 1975 on a Greek fragment and it is not the one engraved in the statue's basement;<ref>J. Magne, ''Tradition apostolique sur les charismes et Diataxeis des saints Apostoles'', Paris 1975</ref>\n*the form of liturgy it describes are quite different from the other information we have about the Christian uses in ancient Rome and are by far more in line with the forms of Church life in [[Alexandria]] or in [[Syria]].\n\n==Content==\nThe Apostolic Tradition, as the other Church Orders, has the aim to offer authoritative \"apostolic\" prescriptions on matters of moral conduct, [[liturgy]] and [[Canon law|Church organization]]. It can be divided in a [[prologue]] (chapter 1) and three main sections. The chapter numbers and order are those of Botte.\n\nThe first section, chapters 2 to 14, deals with the rituals of the organization of the Church, and it follows a hierarchical order starting from the bishops up to the lower levels of the structure. The content can be so summarized:\n* chapter 1: (Prologue)\n* chapter 2: 'On bishops'\n* chapters 3: 'Prayer for the [[ordination]] of a [[bishop]]';\n* chapter 4: (the [[Eucharist]] at the consecration of the bishop. It is the well-known [[Anaphora of the Apostolic Tradition]]);\n* chapter 5: 'On the offering of oil';\n* chapter 5: (on the offering of cheese and olives);\n* chapter 7: 'On [[presbyter]]s';\n* chapter 8: 'On [[deacon]]s';\n* chapter 9: 'On [[Confessor of the Faith|confessors]]';\n* chapter 10: 'On widows';\n* chapters 11: 'On the [[reader (liturgy)|reader]]';\n* chapter 12: 'On virgins';\n* chapter 13: 'On subdeacons'\n* chapter 14: 'On a [[Spiritual gift]]'.\n\nThe second section, chapters 15 to 21, is about the [[catechumenate]] and the [[baptism]];\n* chapter 15: 'On newcomers'; the first step in the catechumenate: the questions about marriage status and whether they are slave or free;\n* chapter 16: 'On trades and professions'; the questions about occupation and moral conduct. Some works are not considered compatible with the Christian life: these works include a manager of prostitutes, the sculptor or painter of idols, actors in the theater, teacher of \"worldly knowledge\" children (unless needed as the primary occupation), and a charioteer or [[gladiator]] in the gladiator competitions. Restrictions on military action are enumerated.\n* chapter 17: 'On the time during which they will hear the word after crafts and professions'; the length of the preliminary instruction, about three years;\n* chapter 18: 'On the prayer of the catechumens';\n* chapter 19: 'On laying hands on the catechumens';the ritual at the end of the preliminary instruction;\n* chapter 20: 'Of those who will receive baptism'; the final examination and the preparation in the days before the baptism;\n* chapter 21: 'On the bestowal of holy baptism'; the detailed description of the baptismal liturgy.\n\nThe last section, chapters 22 to 43, is a compilation of rules about the community, listed without a clear order:\n* chapter 22: (about the distribution of the [[Eucharist|Communion]]);\n* chapter 23: 'On [[fasting]]';\n* chapter 24: 'On gifts to the sick'; 'That those who receive should serve with haste'; about the distribution of the Communion to sick persons;\n* chapter 25: 'On the bringing in of lights at the supper of the congregation';\n* chapter 26: 'On the occasion of eating'; description of a liturgical dinner;\n* chapter 27: 'That catechumens should not eat with the faithful'\n* chapter 28: 'That one should eat with understanding and moderation'\n* chapter 29: 'That one should eat with thanksgiving'\n* chapter 30: 'On supper for widows';\n* chapter 31: 'On the fruits which it is right to offer';\n* chapter 32: 'On the blessing of fruits'; (about the offering to the bishop of the first-fruits);\n* chapter 33: 'That nobody should touch any food at the Pascha before the proper time;\n* chapter 34: 'That it is proper for deacons to attend on the bishop';\n* chapter 35: 'On the time when it is proper to pray';\n* chapter 36: 'That it is proper to partake of the Eucharist first, before anything else is consumed';\n* chapter 37: 'That it is proper to guard the Eucharist carefully';\n* chapter 38: 'That it is improper than anything should be allowed to fall from the cup:\n* chapter 39: (everyday meetings of presbyters and deacons);\n* chapter 40: 'On the cemeteries;\n* chapter 41: 'On the time when it is proper to pray';\n* chapter 42: (about the [[Sign of the Cross]]);\n* chapter 43: (conclusion).\n\n==Influence==\nThe text of the Apostolic Tradition was part of three main ancient collections of the Church Orders, the [[Alexandrine Sinodos]], the Aksumite Collection and the [[Verona Palimpsest]]. Being included in the Alexandrine Sinodos, it was held to be authoritative in [[Asia Minor]], Syria, Egypt and [[Ethiopia]], where it was copied and re-edited.\n\nThe Apostolic Tradition was also used as basis for great part of the eighth book of the [[Apostolic Constitutions]], which had a great diffusion in antiquity. Also the ancient [[Canons of Hippolytus]], [[Testamentum Domini]] and [[Apostolic Constitutions#Epitome|Epitome of the eighth Book of the Apostolic Constitutions]] derive from it.\n\nThe text of the Apostolic Tradition, believed to be authentically a work describing the early 3rd century [[Roman liturgy]], has been widely influential on [[liturgical]] scholarship in the twentieth century and it was one of the pillars of the [[liturgical movement]]. The anaphora included in chapter four was extensively used in preparing reforms for the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and the United Methodist Liturgies found in the current [[United Methodist]] Hymnal. This anaphora is also the inspiration for the Eucharistic Prayer n. II of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Mass of Paul VI]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adoremus.org/9-11-96-FolsomEuch.html |title=From One Eucharistic Prayer to Many |author=Father Cassian Folsom, O.S.B. |year=1996 |work=Adoremus Bulletin Vol. II, Nos. 4 - 6 : September - November 1996 |accessdate=28 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100917055701/http://adoremus.org/9-11-96-FolsomEuch.html| archivedate= 17 September 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe Roman Catholic prayer of ordination of bishops, renewed after the [[Second Vatican Council]], has been re-written and based on the one included in the Apostolic Tradition.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote|Hippolytus of Rome}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708082106/http://www.bombaxo.com/hippolytus.html The Apostolic Tradition of Hippolytus of Rome]\n*[https://unito.academia.edu/AndreaNicolotti/Papers/566439/Che_cose_la_Traditio_apostolica_di_Ippolito_In_margine_ad_una_recente_pubblicazione_in_Rivista_di_Storia_del_Cristianesimo_II_1_2005_pp._219-237 Che cos'\u00e8 la Traditio Apostolica] of Andrea Nicolotti, from \u00abRivista di Storia del Cristianesimo\u00bb II/1 (2005), pp.&nbsp;219\u2013237.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:4th-century Christian texts]]\n[[Category:Ancient Church Orders]]\n[[Category:Christianity in Rome]]\n[[Category:Texts in Koine Greek]]\n[[Category:Italian manuscripts]]\n", "name_user": "Kevinbasil", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_Tradition"}

It was the fifty-fourth running of the [[Canadian Grand Prix]], and the forty-eighth time the event had been included as a round of the [[Formula One World Championship]] since the inception of the series in {{F1|1950}}, and the thirty-eighth time that a World Championship round had been held at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.\n\nThe race was won by [[Lewis Hamilton]] who took pole, led every lap of the race and set the fastest lap. Joining him on the podium were [[Valtteri Bottas]] who finished second and [[Daniel Ricciardo]] who finished third. [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] dominated the weekend after a bad weekend at [[2017 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]].

Third and fourth were Bottas and Vettel, the latter had sustained slight front wing damage from contact with Verstappen heading into turn 2. [[Daniel Ricciardo]] moved into 5th when he passed [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] on the first lap. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen would eventually finish 7th after falling behind the Force Indias and struggling with brake problems in the late stages of the race. Also on the first lap, an incident occurred causing the retirement of [[Carlos Sainz Jr.|Carlos Sainz]] and [[Felipe Massa]], and a pit stop front wing change for [[Romain Grosjean]]. The [[safety car]] was brought out to allow marshals to clear the track. At the restart Vettel's damaged wing partially collapsed as he accelerated back to racing speed. He pitted on lap 5 to repair the damage and dropped to 18th (last) position. On lap 11, Verstappen's [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] lost electrical power and forced his retirement from 2nd position. As the race continued, [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Lance Stroll]] worked his way up into 9th position for what would be his first points in F1. On lap 66 [[Fernando Alonso]]'s [[McLaren]] suffered an engine failure preventing him from scoring his team's first points of the season. Hamilton finished the race 20 seconds ahead of teammate Bottas with Ricciardo in third. Sebastian Vettel overtook [[Sergio P\u00e9rez]] on the penultimate lap to finish in 4th position close behind Ricciardo, following a race-long charge from the back and an alternate two-stop strategy. Earlier P\u00e9rez had ignored requests from his team to allow his faster teammate [[Esteban Ocon]] past in order to challenge Ricciardo for the last podium place.<ref>{{Cite

Grand Prix''' (formally known as the '''Formula 1 Grand Prix du Canada 2017''')<ref name=\"formal\"/> was a [[Formula One]] [[auto racing|motor race]] that took place on 11 June 2017 at the [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.<ref name=\"formal\"/> The race was the seventh round of the [[2017 FIA Formula One World Championship]]. It was the fifty-fourth running of the [[Canadian Grand Prix]], and the forty-eighth time the event had been included as a round of the [[Formula One World Championship]] since the inception of the series in {{F1|1950}}, and the thirty-eighth time that a World Championship round had been held at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.\n\nThe race was won by [[Lewis Hamilton]] who took pole, led every lap of the race and set the fastest lap. Joining him on the podium were [[Valtteri Bottas]] who finished second and [[Daniel Ricciardo]] who finished third. [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] dominated the weekend after a bad weekend at [[2017 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]]. [[Lance Stroll]] finished 9th and became the first driver from [[Formula One drivers from Canada|Canada]] to score a point since [[Jacques Villeneuve]] in the [[2006 British Grand Prix]].\n\n==Report==\n\n===Background===\n[[Fernando Alonso]] returned to racing for [[McLaren]], after missing the previous round in [[2017 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] to participate in the [[2017 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis 500]].\n\nTyre supplier [[Pirelli]] made the soft, supersoft and ultrasoft tyres available to teams for the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/headlines/2017/5/ultrasoft-tyres-the-preferred-choice-for-canada.html/ |title= Ultrasoft tyres the preferred choice for Canada |work=Formula1.com |publisher=Formula One World Championship Limited |date=30 May 2017 |accessdate=9 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Free practice ===\n[[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]]' [[Lewis Hamilton]] went fastest in first practice, setting a time of 1.13:809.

Third and fourth were Bottas and Vettel, the latter had sustained slight front wing damage from contact with Verstappen heading into turn 2. [[Daniel Ricciardo]] moved into 5th when he passed [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] on the first lap. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen would eventually finish 7th after falling behind the Force Indias and struggling with brake problems in the late stages of the race. Also on the first lap, an incident occurred causing the retirement of [[Carlos Sainz Jr.|Carlos Sainz]] and [[Felipe Massa]], and a pit stop front wing change for [[Romain Grosjean]]. The [[safety car]] was brought out to allow marshals to clear the track. At the restart Vettel's damaged wing partially collapsed as he accelerated back to racing speed. He pitted on lap 5 to repair the damage and dropped to 18th (last) position. On lap 11, Verstappen's [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] lost electrical power and forced his retirement from 2nd position. As the race continued, [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Lance Stroll]] worked his way up into 9th position for what would be his first points in F1. On lap 66 [[Fernando Alonso]]'s [[McLaren]] suffered an engine failure preventing him from scoring his team's first points of the season. Hamilton finished the race 20 seconds ahead of teammate Bottas with Ricciardo in third. Sebastian Vettel overtook [[Sergio P\u00e9rez]] on the penultimate lap to finish in 4th position close behind Ricciardo, following a race-long charge from the back and an alternate two-stop strategy. Earlier P\u00e9rez had ignored requests from his team to allow his faster teammate [[Esteban Ocon]] past in order to challenge Ricciardo for the last podium place.<ref>{{Cite

In 1910 he was suspended from playing rugby for two years for kicking an opponent and he switched to rugby league where he joined the Ponsonby team. Savory played for Ponsonby United from 1911 to 1914 and scored 16 tries and kicked 13 goals. For Auckland he played 4 times, scoring 3 tries and kicking 11 goals all in the 1914 season. He had made a quick impression after switching codes and was selected to play for the touring New Zealand side on their visit to Australia.

He had made a quick impression after switching codes and was selected to play for the touring New Zealand side on their visit to Australia. He was then selected for the 1911\u201312 tour of the United Kingdom for the Australasian side. In 1912 he was sent off in a club match versus Newton which meant he was unable to tour with the New Zealand team to Australia.

He was the Silkmen's leading goal scorer as they finished runners-up to Rangers in the [[Northern Premier League Premier Division]], and also scored their first ever goal in the Football Conference after helping them to promotion up to non-league's top tier.\nBurr is still highly thought of at Macclesfield, where he was part of one of their most successful periods as a club. His spell went on to include two [[FA Trophy]] Final appearances. In 1990 [[Sir Alex Ferguson]] brought a [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] team to Moss Rose to celebrate Burr's testimonial year.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Management career==\n===Nuneaton Borough/Hucknall Town===\nHe began his managerial career at [[Nuneaton Town F.C.|Nuneaton Borough]], where he was originally assistant to Brendan Phillips before taking over as manager when Phillips was sacked in 2000.<ref name=\"Nationwide Conference: Burr in the frame at Nuneaton\">{{Cite news\n| first = Richard\n| last = Luscombe\n| title = Nationwide Conference: Burr in the frame at Nuneaton\n| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/4773743/Nationwide-Conference-Burr-in-the-frame-at-Nuneaton.html\n| newspaper = The Daily Telegraph\n| location = London\n| date = 16 October 2000\n| accessdate = 20 March 2014}}</ref> He left Nuneaton after their relegation from the [[Football Conference]] at the end of the 2002\u201303 season, and moved on to become manager of [[Hucknall Town]]. He achieved virtually instant success, cruising to the [[Northern Premier League Premier Division]] title in his sole season at the club in 2003/04.\n\n===Northwich Victoria===\nThe lure of management higher up the pyramid took Burr into the Conference with [[Northwich Victoria]] at that stage, and once again he made a serious impact - although this time on a different scale. Almost immediately, he was dealt a huge blow with a ten-point deduction, which threatened the Vics' survival. Against all odds, the side achieved what was considered the impossible by battling to survival on the pitch - only for 'non football' issues to heartbreakingly see them relegated once again.\n\nThat would have been enough of a hammer blow to anyone's managerial career and progress, but Burr hardly let the demotion affect him, as he swiftly led Northwich straight back to the Conference by winning the [[Conference North]] Championship. Along the way, he took his side to the Third Round of the [[FA Cup]] and a dream date with [[Premier League]] side [[Sunderland A.F.C]], and was voted Manager of the Season. The season had begun well with [[Alex Ferguson]] yet again playing a part in Burr's career by bringing a Manchester United side to Northwich to celebrate the opening of their new ground, the Victoria Stadium.\n\nAs Northwich found themselves submerged with off-field problems, Burr still managed to work wonders with Northwich in the Conference in 2006/07 - leading them to a safe, mid-table position as well as leading them to the FA Trophy semi-final, a run that was ended by Harriers who themselves went on to make [[Wembley]].\n\n===England C===\nIn November 2005, Burr was appointed Assistant Manager to [[Paul Fairclough]] as part of the [[England national football C team|England C]] managerial team. His first game resulted in a 2\u20130 victory over Belgium. Since 2006, under Fairclough's and Burr's guidance, England C have recorded 19 wins, 7 draws and have only suffered 4 defeats.\n\n===Stalybridge Celtic===\nBurr finally left troubled Vics that summer, but understandably he was not out of work for long, as he was quickly unveiled as manager of [[Stalybridge Celtic]].\n\nHis somewhat magical touch continued to rub off - Burr took his new side all the way to the [[Conference North]] play-off Final in 2008, only to be beaten by a single goal as Barrow went on to claim promotion to the [[Conference National]].\n\n===Kidderminster Harriers===\nHis appointment as [[Kidderminster Harriers]] manager on a {{frac|2|1|2}}-year contract in January 2010 saw him once again have the opportunity to have a crack at management in the Conference National. He had a magnificent start at [[Aggborough]] with a 4-1 thrashing of [[Grays Athletic]]<ref name=\"Harriers.co.uk: Kidderminster 4-1 Grays\">{{cite web\n| title = Kidderminster 4-1 Grays Athletic\n| url = http://www.harriers.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10438~50273,00.html\n| publisher = Kidderminster Harriers FC\n| accessdate = 26 January 2010}}</ref> on his home d\u00e9but. This was the first game of an 8-game unbeaten streak as his side made an unlikely bid for the play-offs and progressed to the semi-finals of the [[FA Trophy]].

Burr followed this up by stating that he was happy to stay at Kidderminster.<ref>http://www.thisisgrimsby.co.uk/sport/Burr-happy-Harriers/article-3299820-detail/article.html</ref> This was clarified when Burr and assistant Gary Whild both signed contract extensions to the end of the 2013\u201314 season.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/k/kidderminster_harriers/9434029.stm | work=BBC News | title=Burr signs new Kidderminster deal | date=23 March 2011}}</ref> The Harriers went on to finish sixth in the Conference, one place outside the play-offs,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} after slipping to defeats late in the season at home to [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/9456048.stm | work=BBC News | first=Phil | last=Maiden | title=Kidderminster 1-2 Darlington | date=19 April 2011}}</ref> and away to [[Rushden & Diamonds F.C.|Rushden & Diamonds]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/9465651.stm | work=BBC News | title=Rushden & D 2-1 Kidderminster | date=25 April 2011}}</ref> and suffering a points deduction after financial problems off the field.\n\nIn 2013, Burr received the Conference Premier Manager of the Month<ref>http://www.bluesqfootball.com/story/0,20970,13040_8529307,00.html</ref> award for February after steering his side to five straight wins in five matches. Kidderminster conceded just three goals in the month and found the net no less than 12 times. The award was Burr's second of the season having previously been named the '''Manager of the Month''' for December 2012. February's award was the culmination of a run 15 wins in 17 league games.\n\nAfter a thrilling last day of the season that saw Kiddy miss out on automatic promotion by two points the club failed to get past Wrexham in the Play-offs. Despite this Burr was named the Conference Premier Manager of the Season after recording a better away record than title-winning manager Mansfield's Paul Cox.\n\nOn 1 November 2013 it was announced that Steve had been given permission to speak with [[Forest Green Rovers]] in relation to the vacant managerial role at that club. He turned down the offer, and elected to stay at the Harriers.\n\nOn 7 January 2014 it became public knowledge that Steve Burr had been removed from his post as manager of Kidderminster Harriers. Just two days later the club announced he was to be replaced by Andy Thorn formerly manager of Coventry City.\n\n=== Chester ===\nOn 18 January 2014, Chester announced Burr as their new full-time manager until the end of the season with an option to extend the deal into the following season.<ref name=\"Steve Burr: Chester appoint ex-Kidderminster boss as manager\">{{cite news |title=Steve Burr: Chester appoint ex-Kidderminster boss as manager |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25794198 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 January 2014 |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nBurr was sacked by Chester on 7 April 2016.<ref>http://www.chesterfc.com/news/article/statement-steve-burr-3048096.aspx</ref>\n\n===Southport===\nBurr was announced as the new manager of [[Southport F.C.|Southport]] on 8 September 2016. A club statement on 30 January 2017 stated that Burr had been relieved of his duties.<ref>http://southportfc.net/statement-burr-departs-southport/</ref>\n\n===Stalybridge Celtic and Stafford Rangers===\n\nIn February 2017, Burr took over at Staybridge Celtic before moving on to Stafford Rangers 15 months later. He resigned from the post in December 2018.\n\n===Fleetwood Town - Senior Club Scout===\n\nIn July, 2019, Burr was appointed as Fleetwood's Senior Club Scout. At the time he said: \"I have followed the non-league scene for a very long time now and for me, this was the right moment for me to step into this new role. I have come up against Fleetwood Town before, and it's unbelievable where they have come from in such a short space of time.\n\n\"After speaking to Chairman Andy Pilley, CEO Steve Curwood, and a number of other staff, it helped me make my mind up. This is a fantastic club and I am looking forward to getting started.\n\nHe added: \"Everybody is looking for that next Jamie Vardy after that success story.\"<ref>https://www.fleetwoodtownfc.com/news/2019/july/burr-on-getting-the-job-at-fleetwood/</ref>\n\n=== Hereford FC - Interim Assistant Manager ===\nOn 24 January 2020, Burr was announced as the Interim Assistant Manager of [[National League North]] team [[Hereford F.C.|Hereford]] following the appointment of [[Josh Gowling]]. Gowling played under Burr at [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]].\n\n==Managerial statistics==\n{{updated|match played 26 December 2018}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Managerial record by team and tenure\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Team\n!rowspan=2|From\n!rowspan=2|To\n!colspan=5|Record\n!rowspan=2|{{abbr|Ref|Reference}}\n|-\n!{{abbr|P|Matches played}}!!{{abbr|W|Matches won}}!!{{abbr|D|Matches drawn}}!!{{abbr|L|Matches lost}}!!{{abbr|Win %|Win percentage}}\n|-\n|align=left|[[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]]\n|align=left|21 January 2010\n|align=left|7 January 2014\n{{WDL|205|96|51|58|decimals=1}}\n|<ref>{{cite news |title=Kidderminster Harriers name Steve Burr as new manager |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/k/kidderminster_harriers/8467625.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 January 2010 |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Results/matches: 2009/10 |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=1436&teamTabs=results&season_id=139 |work=Soccerbase |publisher=Centurycomm |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Managers: Steve Burr\">{{cite web |title=Managers: Steve Burr |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/managers/manager.sd?manager_id=1725 |work=Soccerbase |publisher=Centurycomm |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=left|[[Chester F.C.|Chester]]\n|align=left|18 January 2014\n|align=left|7 April 2016\n{{WDL|125|45|26|54|decimals=1}}\n|<ref name=\"Steve Burr: Chester appoint ex-Kidderminster boss as manager\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Fixtures: 2013/14 |url=http://www.chester-city.co.uk/fixtures_2013-14.asp |publisher=Unofficial Chester FC website |accessdate=18 January 2016}}<br>{{cite web |title=Fixtures: 2014/15 |url=http://www.chester-city.co.uk/fixtures_2014-15.asp |publisher=Unofficial Chester FC website |accessdate=18 January 2016}}<br>{{cite web |title=Fixtures: 2015/16 |url=http://www.chester-city.co.uk/fixtures_2015-16.asp |publisher=Unofficial Chester FC website |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=left|[[Southport F.C.|Southport]]\n|align=left|8 September 2016\n|align=left|30 January 2017\n{{WDL|27|8|6|13|decimals=1}}\n|{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n|-\n|align=left|[[Stalybridge Celtic F.C.|Stalybridge Celtic]]\n|align=left|8 February 2017\n|align=left|28 April 2018\n{{WDL|67|21|9|37|decimals=1}}\n|-\n|align=left|[[Stafford Rangers F.C.|Stafford Rangers]]\n|align=left|3 May 2018\n|align=left|''28 December 2018''\n{{WDL|27|8|6|13|decimals=1}}\n|-\n!colspan=3|Total\n{{WDLtot|450|178|97|175|decimals=1}}\n!\u2014\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{soccerbase (manager)|1725|Steve Burr}}\n\n{{Macclesfield Town F.C.

In 1990 [[Sir Alex Ferguson]] brought a [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] team to Moss Rose to celebrate Burr's testimonial year.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Management career==\n===Nuneaton Borough/Hucknall Town===\nHe began his managerial career at [[Nuneaton Town F.C.|Nuneaton Borough]], where he was originally assistant to Brendan Phillips before taking over as manager when Phillips was sacked in 2000.<ref name=\"Nationwide Conference: Burr in the frame at Nuneaton\">{{Cite news\n| first = Richard\n| last = Luscombe\n| title = Nationwide Conference: Burr in the frame at Nuneaton\n| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/4773743/Nationwide-Conference-Burr-in-the-frame-at-Nuneaton.html\n| newspaper = The Daily Telegraph\n| location = London\n| date = 16 October 2000\n| accessdate = 20 March 2014}}</ref> He left Nuneaton after their relegation from the [[Football Conference]] at the end of the 2002\u201303 season, and moved on to become manager of [[Hucknall Town]]. He achieved virtually instant success, cruising to the [[Northern Premier League Premier Division]] title in his sole season at the club in 2003/04.\n\n===Northwich Victoria===\nThe lure of management higher up the pyramid took Burr into the Conference with [[Northwich Victoria]] at that stage, and once again he made a serious impact - although this time on a different scale. Almost immediately, he was dealt a huge blow with a ten-point deduction, which threatened the Vics' survival. Against all odds, the side achieved what was considered the impossible by battling to survival on the pitch - only for 'non football' issues to heartbreakingly see them relegated once again.\n\nThat would have been enough of a hammer blow to anyone's managerial career and progress, but Burr hardly let the demotion affect him, as he swiftly led Northwich straight back to the Conference by winning the [[Conference North]] Championship. Along the way, he took his side to the Third Round of the [[FA Cup]] and a dream date with [[Premier League]] side [[Sunderland A.F.C]], and was voted Manager of the Season. The season had begun well with [[Alex Ferguson]] yet again playing a part in Burr's career by bringing a Manchester United side to Northwich to celebrate the opening of their new ground, the Victoria Stadium.\n\nAs Northwich found themselves submerged with off-field problems, Burr still managed to work wonders with Northwich in the Conference in 2006/07 - leading them to a safe, mid-table position as well as leading them to the FA Trophy semi-final, a run that was ended by Harriers who themselves went on to make [[Wembley]].\n\n===England C===\nIn November 2005, Burr was appointed Assistant Manager to [[Paul Fairclough]] as part of the [[England national football C team|England C]] managerial team. His first game resulted in a 2\u20130 victory over Belgium. Since 2006, under Fairclough's and Burr's guidance, England C have recorded 19 wins, 7 draws and have only suffered 4 defeats.\n\n===Stalybridge Celtic===\nBurr finally left troubled Vics that summer, but understandably he was not out of work for long, as he was quickly unveiled as manager of [[Stalybridge Celtic]].\n\nHis somewhat magical touch continued to rub off - Burr took his new side all the way to the [[Conference North]] play-off Final in 2008, only to be beaten by a single goal as Barrow went on to claim promotion to the [[Conference National]].\n\n===Kidderminster Harriers===\nHis appointment as [[Kidderminster Harriers]] manager on a {{frac|2|1|2}}-year contract in January 2010 saw him once again have the opportunity to have a crack at management in the Conference National. He had a magnificent start at [[Aggborough]] with a 4-1 thrashing of [[Grays Athletic]]<ref name=\"Harriers.co.uk: Kidderminster 4-1 Grays\">{{cite web\n| title = Kidderminster 4-1 Grays Athletic\n| url = http://www.harriers.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10438~50273,00.html\n| publisher = Kidderminster Harriers FC\n| accessdate = 26 January 2010}}</ref> on his home d\u00e9but.

Burr followed this up by stating that he was happy to stay at Kidderminster.<ref>http://www.thisisgrimsby.co.uk/sport/Burr-happy-Harriers/article-3299820-detail/article.html</ref> This was clarified when Burr and assistant Gary Whild both signed contract extensions to the end of the 2013\u201314 season.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/k/kidderminster_harriers/9434029.stm | work=BBC News | title=Burr signs new Kidderminster deal | date=23 March 2011}}</ref> The Harriers went on to finish sixth in the Conference, one place outside the play-offs,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} after slipping to defeats late in the season at home to [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/9456048.stm | work=BBC News | first=Phil | last=Maiden | title=Kidderminster 1-2 Darlington | date=19 April 2011}}</ref> and away to [[Rushden & Diamonds F.C.|Rushden & Diamonds]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/9465651.stm | work=BBC News | title=Rushden & D 2-1 Kidderminster | date=25 April 2011}}</ref> and suffering a points deduction after financial problems off the field.\n\nIn 2013, Burr received the Conference Premier Manager of the Month<ref>http://www.bluesqfootball.com/story/0,20970,13040_8529307,00.html</ref> award for February after steering his side to five straight wins in five matches. Kidderminster conceded just three goals in the month and found the net no less than 12 times. The award was Burr's second of the season having previously been named the '''Manager of the Month''' for December 2012. February's award was the culmination of a run 15 wins in 17 league games.\n\nAfter a thrilling last day of the season that saw Kiddy miss out on automatic promotion by two points the club failed to get past Wrexham in the Play-offs. Despite this Burr was named the Conference Premier Manager of the Season after recording a better away record than title-winning manager Mansfield's Paul Cox.\n\nOn 1 November 2013 it was announced that Steve had been given permission to speak with [[Forest Green Rovers]] in relation to the vacant managerial role at that club. He turned down the offer, and elected to stay at the Harriers.\n\nOn 7 January 2014 it became public knowledge that Steve Burr had been removed from his post as manager of Kidderminster Harriers. Just two days later the club announced he was to be replaced by Andy Thorn formerly manager of Coventry City.\n\n=== Chester ===\nOn 18 January 2014, Chester announced Burr as their new full-time manager until the end of the season with an option to extend the deal into the following season.<ref name=\"Steve Burr: Chester appoint ex-Kidderminster boss as manager\">{{cite news |title=Steve Burr: Chester appoint ex-Kidderminster boss as manager |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25794198 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 January 2014 |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nBurr was sacked by Chester on 7 April 2016.<ref>http://www.chesterfc.com/news/article/statement-steve-burr-3048096.aspx</ref>\n\n===Southport===\nBurr was announced as the new manager of [[Southport F.C.|Southport]] on 8 September 2016.

He resigned from the post in December 2018.\n\n===Fleetwood Town - Senior Club Scout===\n\nIn July, 2019, Burr was appointed as Fleetwood's Senior Club Scout. At the time he said: \"I have followed the non-league scene for a very long time now and for me, this was the right moment for me to step into this new role. I have come up against Fleetwood Town before, and it's unbelievable where they have come from in such a short space of time.\n\n\"After speaking to Chairman Andy Pilley, CEO Steve Curwood, and a number of other staff, it helped me make my mind up.

From the German-language [[Tartu Linna-t\u00fctarlastekool|Tartu Higher Girls\u2019 School]], she graduated with a home teacher diploma, which, at that time, was the only higher education available to Estonian women.

She published her first poem in the newspaper ''[[Postimees]]'' after the notable Estonian poet [[Lydia Koidula]] died in the summer of 1886.

Haava wrote to condemn injustice, violence and ethnic discrimination, and her criticism only deepened in some poetry collections, ''Ristlained'' (Crosswaves, 1910) and ''Meie p\u00e4evist'' (From Our Days, 1920). Haava's poetry became even more personal in the collections ''P\u00f5hjamaa lapsed'' (Children of the Nordic countries, 1913), ''Siiski on elu ilus'' (Still, Life is Beautiful), and ''Laulan oma eesti laulu'' (I Sing My Estonian Song, 1935).
