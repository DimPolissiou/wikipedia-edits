{"title_page": "John Richard Clark Hall", "text_new": "'''John Richard Clark Hall''' (1855 \u2013 6 August 1931) was a scholar of [[Old English]], notable for his work on ''[[Beowulf]]''. In 1894 he published a dictionary of Anglo-Saxon words,{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990|p=1443}} which he followed up with complete verse and metrical translations of the poem.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} His 1901 translation was the tenth to be published in English; a metrical translation followed in 1914,{{sfn|Hall|1914}} and in 1940 was edited by [[Charles Leslie Wrenn]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Richard Clark Hall was born in 1855,{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and was the only son of James John Hall.{{sfn|Foster|1889|p=491}} He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from the [[University of London]] in 1889,{{sfn|''The Times''|1889}} and in 1891 received a [[Master of Arts]] in English and French from the same school.{{sfn|''The Times''|1891}} By 1894, he had received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]{{sfn|Hall|1894|p=i}} On 16 May 1881, then a clerk in the [[Local Government Board]], Hall was admitted to [[Gray's Inn]].{{sfn|Foster|1889|p=491}}\n\n== Career ==\nHall published multiple editions of ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'',{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and two translations of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]''.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}\n\n=== ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' ===\nHall's dictionary of [[Old English]], subtitled ''For the Use of Students'',{{sfn|Hall|1894}} quickly became a standard upon its publication in 1894.{{sfn|Chermayeff|1962}} The work offered a significantly more complete reference than the the prevailing dictionary at the time, [[Joseph Bosworth]]'s ''[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]]''.{{sfn|Chase|1895|pp=50, 52}}{{sfn|''Journal of Education''|1895}}{{sfn|''The Journal of Education''|1894}} \"At last\", wrote ''The Guardian'', \"we have a complete Anglo-Saxon dictionary, complete form A to the very end of the alphabet.\"{{sfn|''The Guardian''|1895}} Even after Bosworth's work was revised by [[Thomas Northcote Toller]]'s in 1898, ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' continued to serve prominently as an introductory resource.{{sfn|Garnett|1898|pp=327\u2013328}} \n\nThe first edition of the dictionary attempted to ease access by ordering entries by the words as they were actually spelled in common editions of [[Old English]] texts, and critics noted that this introduced its own share of confusion.{{sfn|Chase|1895|pp=50\u201351}}{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} Hall eliminated this approach in a 1916 second edition, acknowledging that this \"was admittedly an unscientific [approach], and opened the door to a good many errors and inconsistencies\".{{sfn|Hall|1916|p=v}} Thenceforth he adopted the conventional method of using \"normalised\" entry words.{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} Hall also began indicating words found only in poetical texts and providing the source of words recorded only once, and added cross references to corresponding entries in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|New English Dictionary]]'', then underway.{{sfn|Klaeber|1918|p=154}}{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} The edition was \"markedly superior to the first edition\" according to a reviewer for ''[[Modern Philology]]'',{{sfn|Knott|1917}} and according to [[Frederick Klaeber]], \"[i]ts outward make-up is almost an ideal one.\"{{sfn|Klaeber|1918|p=153}}\n\nA third and significantly expanded edition followed in 1931;{{sfn|Hall|1931}} according to [[Francis Peabody Magoun]], it was \"to all intents and purposes [a] completely new edition\", and \"a notable monument to the memory of its author\", who died the year of publication.{{sfn|Magoun|1932|p=288}} A fourth edition\u2014a reprinting with a supplement by Herbert Dean Meritt{{sfn|Muinzer|1963|p=786}}{{sfn|Campbell|1962}}\u2014came in 1960.{{sfn|Hall|Meritt|1960}} This was itself reprinted by the [[University of Toronto Press]] starting in 1984,{{sfn|Hall|Meritt|1984}}{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and is still in print as of 2020.{{sfn|University of Toronto Press}}\n\n=== ''Beowulf'' ===\nIn 1901, after publication of the first edition of his dictionary, Hall published a literal translation of ''Beowulf''.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} It was the tenth [[English language|English]] translation of the work.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}{{refn|group=note|The eighth translation, in 1892, had also been translated by a John Hall, [[John Lesslie Hall]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}}} It was lauded at its outset for containing both a \"decidedly better\" translation than any in current use, as wrote ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'',{{sfn|The Manchester Guardian|1901}} and what [[Chauncey Brewster Tinker]] described as \"a useful compendium of Beowulf material\".{{sfn|Tinker|1902|p=379}}{{sfn|Windle|1912}} The work became \"the standard trot to ''Beowulf''\";{{sfn|Chickering Jr.|1967|p=774}} according to [[Marijane Osborn]] was \"still the 'crib of choice' in Oxford in the 1960s\".{{sfn|Osborn|1997|p=342}}\n\nHe followed this up in 1914 with another translation, this time in [[Metre (poetry)|metre]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} In 1940, after Hall's death, his prose translation was revised by [[Charles Leslie Wrenn]], and again in 1950;{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} this latter edition included a preface by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].{{sfn|Hall|1950}}\n\n== Personal life ==\nHall married Mary Ann Elizabeth Symes on 29 November 1883.{{sfn|Dorset Marriages|1883}} The two had four children, three of whom survived: Cecil Symes (born {{circa}} 1887), Irene Clark (born {{circa}} 1886), and the entomologist [[Wilfrid Hall|Wilfrid John]] (born 1892).{{sfn|England Census|1891}}{{sfn|England Census|1911}}{{sfn|''Who Was Who''|2007}}\n\nHall was a member of the [[Yorkshire Philosophical Society]], joining in 1910.{{sfn|Yorkshire Philosophical Society|1911}} He died in 1931.{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}} He had been living in [[Eastbourne]] in [[East Sussex]].{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}} His obituary labeled him a \"protestant reformer\", noted that he had formerly been on the Local Government Board in [[Whitehall]], and that he had a net [[Personal property|personalty]] of \u00a313,309 and a gross of \u00a315,762.{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}}{{sfn|''The Manchester Guardian''|1931}}\n\n== Publications ==\n=== Books ===\n*

In 1894 he published a dictionary of Anglo-Saxon words,{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990|p=1443}} which he followed up with complete verse and metrical translations of the poem.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} His 1901 translation was the tenth to be published in English; a metrical translation followed in 1914,{{sfn|Hall|1914}} and in 1940 was edited by [[Charles Leslie Wrenn]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Richard Clark Hall was born in 1855,{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and was the only son of James John Hall.{{sfn|Foster|1889|p=491}} He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from the [[University of London]] in 1889,{{sfn|''The Times''|1889}} and in 1891 received a [[Master of Arts]] in English and French from the same school.{{sfn|''The Times''|1891}} By 1894, he had received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]{{sfn|Hall|1894|p=i}} On 16 May 1881, then a clerk in the [[Local Government Board]], Hall was admitted to [[Gray's Inn]].{{sfn|Foster|1889|p=491}}\n\n== Career ==\nHall published multiple editions of ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'',{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and two translations of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]''.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}\n\n=== ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' ===\nHall's dictionary of [[Old English]], subtitled ''For the Use of Students'',{{sfn|Hall|1894}} quickly became a standard upon its publication in 1894.{{sfn|Chermayeff|1962}} The work offered a significantly more complete reference than the the prevailing dictionary at the time, [[Joseph Bosworth]]'s ''[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]]''.{{sfn|Chase|1895|pp=50, 52}}{{sfn|''Journal of Education''|1895}}{{sfn|''The Journal of Education''|1894}} \"At last\", wrote ''The Guardian'', \"we have a complete Anglo-Saxon dictionary, complete form A to the very end of the alphabet.\"{{sfn|''The Guardian''|1895}} Even after Bosworth's work was revised by [[Thomas Northcote Toller]]'s in 1898, ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' continued to serve prominently as an introductory resource.{{sfn|Garnett|1898|pp=327\u2013328}} \n\nThe first edition of the dictionary attempted to ease access by ordering entries by the words as they were actually spelled in common editions of [[Old English]] texts, and critics noted that this introduced its own share of confusion.{{sfn|Chase|1895|pp=50\u201351}}{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} Hall eliminated this approach in a 1916 second edition, acknowledging that this \"was admittedly an unscientific [approach], and opened the door to a good many errors and inconsistencies\".{{sfn|Hall|1916|p=v}} Thenceforth he adopted the conventional method of using \"normalised\" entry words.{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} Hall also began indicating words found only in poetical texts and providing the source of words recorded only once, and added cross references to corresponding entries in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|New English Dictionary]]'', then underway.{{sfn|Klaeber|1918|p=154}}{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} The edition was \"markedly superior to the first edition\" according to a reviewer for ''[[Modern Philology]]'',{{sfn|Knott|1917}} and according to [[Frederick Klaeber]], \"[i]ts outward make-up is almost an ideal one.\"{{sfn|Klaeber|1918|p=153}}\n\nA third and significantly expanded edition followed in 1931;{{sfn|Hall|1931}} according to [[Francis Peabody Magoun]], it was \"to all intents and purposes [a] completely new edition\", and \"a notable monument to the memory of its author\", who died the year of publication.{{sfn|Magoun|1932|p=288}} A fourth edition\u2014a reprinting with a supplement by Herbert Dean Meritt{{sfn|Muinzer|1963|p=786}}{{sfn|Campbell|1962}}\u2014came in 1960.{{sfn|Hall|Meritt|1960}} This was itself reprinted by the [[University of Toronto Press]] starting in 1984,{{sfn|Hall|Meritt|1984}}{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and is still in print as of 2020.{{sfn|University of Toronto Press}}\n\n=== ''Beowulf'' ===\nIn 1901, after publication of the first edition of his dictionary, Hall published a literal translation of ''Beowulf''.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} It was the tenth [[English language|English]] translation of the work.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}{{refn|group=note|The eighth translation, in 1892, had also been translated by a John Hall, [[John Lesslie Hall]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}}} It was lauded at its outset for containing both a \"decidedly better\" translation than any in current use, as wrote ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'',{{sfn|The Manchester Guardian|1901}} and what [[Chauncey Brewster Tinker]] described as \"a useful compendium of Beowulf material\".{{sfn|Tinker|1902|p=379}}{{sfn|Winder|1912}} The work became \"the standard trot to ''Beowulf''\";{{sfn|Chickering Jr.|1967|p=774}} according to [[Marijane Osborn]] was \"still the 'crib of choice' in Oxford in the 1960s\".{{sfn|Osborn|1997|p=342}}\n\nHe followed this up in 1914 with another translation, this time in [[Metre (poetry)|metre]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} In 1940, after Hall's death, his prose translation was revised by [[Charles Leslie Wrenn]], and again in 1950;{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} this latter edition included a preface by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].{{sfn|Hall|1950}}\n\n== Personal life ==\nHall married Mary Ann Elizabeth Symes on 29 November 1883.{{sfn|Dorset Marriages|1883}} The two had four children, three of whom survived: Cecil
