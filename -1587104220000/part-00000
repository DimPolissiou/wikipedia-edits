It was published by [[Shogakukan]] in their ''[[Big Comic Original]]'' magazine between 1994 and 2001, with the chapters collected and reprinted into 18 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. The story revolves around [[Kenzo Tenma]], a Japanese surgeon living in Germany whose life enters turmoil after getting himself involved with [[Johan Liebert]], one of his former patients, who is revealed to be a dangerous serial killer.\n\nUrasawa later wrote and illustrated the novel ''Another Monster'', a story detailing the events of the manga from an investigative reporter's point of view, which was published in 2002. The manga was adapted by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] into a 74-episode [[anime]] TV series, which aired on [[Nippon TV]] from April 2004 to September 2005. It was directed by [[Masayuki Kojima]], written by Tatsuhiko Urahata and featured character design by [[Kitar\u014d K\u014dsaka]]. The manga and anime were both been licensed by [[Viz Media]] for English releases in North America, and the anime was broadcast on several television channels. In 2013, [[Siren Visual]] licensed the anime for [[Australia]]. ''Monster'' has been critically acclaimed, with the manga winning several awards, and its anime adaptation called one of the best of the decade.\n\n==Plot==\n{{main|List of Monster characters}}\n\n[[Kenzo Tenma|Dr. Kenzo Tenma]] is a young Japanese [[neurosurgery|brain surgeon]], working at Eisler Memorial Hospital in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[West Germany]]. Tenma is dissatisfied with the political bias of the hospital in treating patients, and seizes the chance to change things after a massacre brings fraternal twins [[Johan Liebert|Johan]] and [[Anna Liebert]] into the hospital. Johan has a gunshot wound to his head, and Anna mutters about killing; Tenma operates on Johan instead of the mayor, who arrived later. Johan is saved, but Mayor Roedecker dies; Tenma loses his social standing. [[Director Heinemann]] and the other doctors in Tenma's way are mysteriously murdered, and both children disappear from the hospital. The police suspect Tenma, but they have no evidence and can only question him.\n\nNine years later, Tenma is Chief of Surgery at Eisler Memorial. After saving a criminal named Adolf Junkers, Junkers mutters about a \"monster.\" Tenma returns with a clock for Junkers, he finds the guard in front of Junkers' room dead and Junkers gone. Following the trail to the construction site of a half-finished building near the hospital, Tenma finds Junkers held at gunpoint. Junkers warns him against coming closer and pleads with him to run away. Tenma refuses, and the man holding the gun is revealed to be Johan Liebert. Despite Tenma's attempts to reason with him, Johan shoots Junkers. Telling Tenma he could never kill the man who saved his life, he walks off into the night, with Tenma too shocked to stop him.\n\nTenma is suspected by the police, particularly [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]] [[Inspector Lunge]], and he tries to find more information about Johan. He soon discovers that the boy's sister is living a happy life as an adopted daughter; the only traces of her terrible past are a few nightmares. Tenma finds Anna, who was subsequently named Nina by her foster parents, on her birthday; he keeps her from Johan, but is too late to stop him from murdering her foster parents. Tenma eventually learns the origins of this \"monster\": from the former [[East Germany]]'s attempt to use a secret [[orphanage]] known as \"511 Kinderheim\" to create perfect soldiers through psychological reprogramming, to the author of children's books used in a [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics]] experiment in the former [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]]. Tenma learns the scope of the atrocities committed by this \"monster\", and vows to fix the mistake he made by saving Johan's life.\n\n==Production==\nUrasawa revealed that he pitched the idea of writing a manga about the medical field around 1986, but could tell his editor was not enjoying the idea. So he jokingly proposed a story about women's judo, and that lead to his first solo work ''[[Yawara!]]'' (1986\u20131993).<ref name=\"alltheanime\">{{cite web|url = http://nekopop.com/2019/01/naoki-urasawa-interview-creator-monster-20th-century-boys-japan-house-los-angeles-2019/|title = Naoki Urasawa \u2013 Interview with creator of Monster, 20th Century Boys at JAPAN HOUSE Los Angeles (2019)|publisher = All the Anime|accessdate = 2020-02-15}}</ref> \n\nThe original idea for ''Monster'' came from the 1960s American television series ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', which had a strong impact on Urasawa when he saw it at the age of eight. In the story, a doctor is wrongfully convicted of murder, but escapes and searches for the real killer while on the run from the police.<ref name=\"alltheanime\"/> He said that his editor was adamant that the series would not do well, and tried to stop him from creating it.<ref name=\"alltheanime\"/>\n\nThe Japanese medical industry was strongly influenced by the German one, thus it seemed natural to the author to set ''Monster'' in Germany. [[Post-war]] Germany was chosen so that the [[neo-Nazi]] movement could be included in the story.<ref name=\"crunchy\">{{cite web|url = https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2019/02/06-1/interview-all-you-need-is-a-white-piece-of-paper-and-pen-a-conversation-with-monster-and-21st-century-boys-creator-naoki-urasawa|title = INTERVIEW: All You Need is a White Piece of Paper and Pen: A Conversation with Monster and 20th Century Boys Creator Naoki Urasawa |date = 2019-02-06|publisher = [[Crunchyroll]]|accessdate = 2020-02-15}}</ref> When he started ''Monster'' at the end of 1994, Urasawa was already writing ''[[Happy! (sports manga)|Happy!]]'' and continued to serialize both at the same time. When ''Happy!'' ended in 1999, he began ''[[20th Century Boys]]''. Writing both ''Monster'' and ''20th Century Boys'' at the same time caused him to be briefly hospitalized for exhaustion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Monster\u2019s Naoki Urasawa Celebrated In Career-Spanning Exhibition |url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/monsters-naoki-urasawa-celebrated-in-career-spanning-exhibition/ |publisher=[[Otaku USA]] |date= 2016-02-11 |accessdate=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n{{main|List of Monster chapters}}\nWritten and illustrated by [[Naoki Urasawa]], ''Monster'' was published in ''[[Big Comic Original]]'' from December 1994 to December 2001.

It was published by [[Shogakukan]] in their ''[[Big Comic Original]]'' magazine between 1994 and 2001, with the chapters collected and reprinted into 18 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. The story revolves around [[Kenzo Tenma]], a Japanese surgeon living in Germany whose life enters turmoil after getting himself involved with [[Johan Liebert]], one of his former patients, who is revealed to be a dangerous serial killer.\n\nUrasawa later wrote and illustrated the novel ''Another Monster'', a story detailing the events of the manga from an investigative reporter's point of view, which was published in 2002. The manga was adapted by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] into a 74-episode [[anime]] TV series, which aired on [[Nippon TV]] from April 2004 to September 2005. It was directed by [[Masayuki Kojima]], written by Tatsuhiko Urahata and featured character design by [[Kitar\u014d K\u014dsaka]]. The manga and anime were both been licensed by [[Viz Media]] for English releases in North America, and the anime was broadcast on several television channels. In 2013, [[Siren Visual]] licensed the anime for [[Australia]]. ''Monster'' has been critically acclaimed, with the manga winning several awards, and its anime adaptation called one of the best of the decade.\n\n==Plot==\n{{main|List of Monster characters}}\n\n[[Kenzo Tenma|Dr. Kenzo Tenma]] is a young Japanese [[neurosurgery|brain surgeon]], working at Eisler Memorial Hospital in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[West Germany]]. Tenma is dissatisfied with the political bias of the hospital in treating patients, and seizes the chance to change things after a massacre brings fraternal twins [[Johan Liebert|Johan]] and [[Anna Liebert]] into the hospital. Johan has a gunshot wound to his head, and Anna mutters about killing; Tenma operates on Johan instead of the mayor, who arrived later. Johan is saved, but Mayor Roedecker dies; Tenma loses his social standing. [[Director Heinemann]] and the other doctors in Tenma's way are mysteriously murdered, and both children disappear from the hospital. The police suspect Tenma, but they have no evidence and can only question him.\n\nNine years later, Tenma is Chief of Surgery at Eisler Memorial. After saving a criminal named Adolf Junkers, Junkers mutters about a \"monster.\" Tenma returns with a clock for Junkers, he finds the guard in front of Junkers' room dead and Junkers gone. Following the trail to the construction site of a half-finished building near the hospital, Tenma finds Junkers held at gunpoint. Junkers warns him against coming closer and pleads with him to run away. Tenma refuses, and the man holding the gun is revealed to be Johan Liebert. Despite Tenma's attempts to reason with him, Johan shoots Junkers. Telling Tenma he could never kill the man who saved his life, he walks off into the night, with Tenma too shocked to stop him.\n\nTenma is suspected by the police, particularly [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]] [[Inspector Lunge]], and he tries to find more information about Johan. He soon discovers that the boy's sister is living a happy life as an adopted daughter; the only traces of her terrible past are a few nightmares. Tenma finds Anna, who was subsequently named Nina by her foster parents, on her birthday; he keeps her from Johan, but is too late to stop him from murdering her foster parents. Tenma eventually learns the origins of this \"monster\": from the former [[East Germany]]'s attempt to use a secret [[orphanage]] known as \"511 Kinderheim\" to create perfect soldiers through psychological reprogramming, to the author of children's books used in a [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics]] experiment in the former [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]]. Tenma learns the scope of the atrocities committed by this \"monster\", and vows to fix the mistake he made by saving Johan's life.\n\n==Production==\nUrasawa revealed that he pitched the idea of writing a manga about the medical field around 1986, but could tell his editor was not enjoying the idea. So he jokingly proposed a story about women's judo, and that lead to his first solo work ''[[Yawara!]]'' (1986\u20131993).<ref name=\"alltheanime\">{{cite web|url = http://nekopop.com/2019/01/naoki-urasawa-interview-creator-monster-20th-century-boys-japan-house-los-angeles-2019/|title = Naoki Urasawa \u2013 Interview with creator of Monster, 20th Century Boys at JAPAN HOUSE Los Angeles (2019)|publisher = All the Anime|accessdate = 2020-02-15}}</ref> \n\nThe original idea for ''Monster'' came from the 1960s American television series ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', which had a strong impact on Urasawa when he saw it at the age of eight. In the story a doctor is wrongfully convicted of murder, but escapes and searches for the real killer while on the run from the police.<ref name=\"alltheanime\"/> He said that his editor was adamant that the series would not do well, and tried to stop him from creating it.<ref name=\"alltheanime\"/>\n\nThe Japanese medical industry was strongly influenced by the German one, thus it seemed natural to the author to set ''Monster'' in Germany. [[Post-war]] Germany was chosen so that the [[neo-Nazi]] movement could be included in the story.<ref name=\"crunchy\">{{cite web|url = https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2019/02/06-1/interview-all-you-need-is-a-white-piece-of-paper-and-pen-a-conversation-with-monster-and-21st-century-boys-creator-naoki-urasawa|title = INTERVIEW: All You Need is a White Piece of Paper and Pen: A Conversation with Monster and 20th Century Boys Creator Naoki Urasawa |date = 2019-02-06|publisher = [[Crunchyroll]]|accessdate = 2020-02-15}}</ref> When he started ''Monster'' at the end of 1994, Urasawa was already writing ''[[Happy! (sports manga)|Happy!]]'' and continued to serialize both at the same time. When ''Happy!'' ended in 1999, he began ''[[20th Century Boys]]''. Writing both ''Monster'' and ''20th Century Boys'' at the same time caused him to be briefly hospitalized for exhaustion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Monster\u2019s Naoki Urasawa Celebrated In Career-Spanning Exhibition |url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/monsters-naoki-urasawa-celebrated-in-career-spanning-exhibition/ |publisher=[[Otaku USA]] |date= 2016-02-11 |accessdate=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n{{main|List of Monster chapters}}\nWritten and illustrated by [[Naoki Urasawa]], ''Monster'' was published in ''[[Big Comic Original]]'' from December 1994 to December 2001.

For a moderated subform of flagellation, described as ''bastinado'', the soles of a person's [[barefoot|bare feet]] are used as a target for beating (see [[foot whipping]]).\n\nIn some circumstances the word \"flogging\" is used loosely to include any sort of [[corporal punishment]], including [[birching]] and [[caning]]. However, in British legal terminology, a distinction was drawn (and still is, in one or two colonial territories) between \"flogging\" (with a [[cat-o'-nine-tails]]) and \"whipping\" (formerly with a whip, but since the early 19th century with a birch). In Britain these were both abolished in 1948.\n\n==Current use as punishment==\n{{main|Judicial corporal punishment}}\nOfficially abolished in most Western countries, flogging or whipping, including [[foot whipping]] in some countries, is still a common punishment in some parts of the world, particularly in [[Application of Islamic law by country|countries using Islamic law]] and in some territories formerly under British rule. Medically supervised [[caning]] is routinely ordered by the courts as a penalty for some categories of crime in [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]], [[Caning in Brunei|Brunei]], [[Caning in Malaysia|Malaysia]], Indonesia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and elsewhere.\n\nFlogging is a form of punishment used under Islamic [[Sharia]] law. It is the prescribed punishment (''[[hudud]]'') for offences including [[fornication]], alcohol use and slander and is also widely favoured as a discretionary punishment (''[[ta'zir]]'') for many offences, such as violating gender interaction laws (''[[zina]]''). Punishment is normally carried out in public. However, some scholars maintain that this goes against the teachings of Islam.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://islamqa.info/en/ref/72338/rape |title=Ruling on the crime of rape |date=9 January 2012}}</ref>\n[[Image:Prisoners whipped.jpg|thumb|200px|Prisoners at a whipping post in a [[Delaware]] prison, circa 1907]]\n\n==Historical use as punishment ==\n[[File:Johann Moritz Rugendas in Brazil.jpg|thumb|250px|Public flogging of a slave in [[Brazil]] - work of German painter [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]] (1802\u20131858).]]\n\n===Judaism===\n{{Main|Corporal punishment (Judaism)}}\n\nAccording to the [[Torah]] (Deuteronomy 25:1-3)  and [[Rabbinic law]] lashes may be given for offenses that do not merit capital punishment, and may not exceed 40. However, in the absence of a [[Sanhedrin]], corporal punishment is not practiced in Jewish law. [[Halakha]] specifies the lashes must be given in sets of three, so the total number cannot exceed 39. Also, the person whipped is first judged whether they can withstand the punishment, if not, the number of whips is decreased. [[Halakha|Jewish law]] limited flagellation to forty strokes, and in practice delivered thirty-nine, so as to avoid any possibility of breaking this law due to a miscount.\n\n===Antiquity===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nIn [[Sparta]], young men were flogged as a test of their masculinity.\n\nIn the [[Roman Empire]], flagellation was often used as a prelude to [[crucifixion]], and in this context is sometimes referred to as '''[[Scourge|scourging]]'''. Most famously according to the gospel accounts, [[Flagellation of Christ|this occurred]] prior to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion of Jesus Christ]].\n\nWhips with small pieces of metal or bone at the tips were commonly used. Such a device could easily cause disfigurement and serious trauma, such as ripping pieces of flesh from the body or loss of an eye. In addition to causing severe pain, the victim would approach a state of [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]] due to loss of blood.\n\nThe Romans reserved this treatment for non-citizens, as stated in the ''lex Porcia'' and ''lex Sempronia'', dating from 195 and 123 BC. The poet [[Horace]] refers to the ''horribile flagellum'' (horrible whip) in his ''Satires''. Typically, the one to be punished was stripped naked and bound to a low pillar so that he could bend over it, or chained to an upright pillar so as to be stretched out. Two [[lictor]]s (some reports indicate scourgings with four or six lictors) alternated blows from the bare shoulders down the body to the soles of the feet. There was no limit to the number of blows inflicted&mdash;this was left to the lictors to decide, though they were normally not supposed to kill the victim. Nonetheless, [[Livy]], [[Suetonius]] and [[Josephus]] report cases of flagellation where victims died while still bound to the post. Flagellation was referred to as \"half death\" by some authors, as many victims died shortly thereafter. [[Cicero]] reports in ''In Verrem'', ''\"{{lang|la|pro mortuo sublatus brevi postea mortuus}}\"'' (\"taken away for a dead man, shortly thereafter he was dead\").\n\n===From Middle Ages to modern times===\n[[File:Supplice du Grand Knout.jpg|thumb|Punishment with a [[knout]]. Russia, 18th century.]]\nThe Whipping Act was passed in [[England]] in 1530. Under this legislation, [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]]s were to be taken to a nearby populated area \"and there tied to the end of a cart naked and beaten with whips throughout such market town till the body shall be bloody\".<ref>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Whipping|volume=28|pages=590\u2013591}}</ref>\n\nIn England, offenders (mostly those convicted of theft) were usually sentenced to be flogged \"at a cart's tail\" along a length of public street, usually near the scene of the crime, \"until his [or her] back be bloody\". In the late seventeenth century, however, the courts occasionally ordered that the flogging should be carried out in prison or a [[house of correction]] rather than on the streets. From the 1720s courts began explicitly to differentiate between private whipping and public whipping. Over the course of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the proportion of whippings carried out in public declined, but the number of private whippings increased. The public whipping of women was abolished in 1817 (after having been in decline since the 1770s) and that of men ended in the early 1830s, though not formally abolished until 1862. Private whipping of men in prison continued and was not abolished until 1948.<ref>[http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Punishment.jsp#corporal London lives]</ref> The 1948 abolition did not affect the ability of a prison's visiting justices (in England and Wales, but not in Scotland, except at Peterhead) to order the birch or cat for prisoners committing serious assaults on prison staff. This power was not abolished until 1967, having been last used in 1962.<ref>[https://www.corpun.com/counukj.htm]</ref>\n\nWhipping occurred during the French Revolution, though not as official punishment. On 31 May 1793, the Jacobin women seized a revolutionary leader, [[Anne Josephe Theroigne de Mericourt]], stripped her naked, and flogged her on the bare bottom in the public garden of the [[Tuileries]].  After this humiliation, she refused to wear any clothes, in memory of the outrage she had suffered.<ref>Roudinesco, Elisabeth (1992). ''Madness and Revolution: The Lives and Legends of Theroigne de Mericourt'', Verso. {{ISBN|0-86091-597-2}}. p.198</ref> She went mad and ended her days in an asylum after the public whipping.\n\nIn the [[Russian Empire]], [[knout]]s were used to flog criminals and political offenders. Sentences of a hundred lashes would usually result in death. Whipping was used as a punishment for [[Serfdom in Russia|Russian serfs]].<ref>Chapman, Tim (2001).

The scars are clearly visible because of [[keloid]] formation.]]\n\nWhipping has been used as a form of discipline on slaves. It was frequently carried out during the period of [[slavery in the United States]], by slave owners and their slaves. The power was also given to slave \"patrollers,\" mostly poor whites, who had among their powers the ability to whip any slave who violated the [[slave codes]].\n\n===Flogging as military punishment===\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, European armies administered floggings to common soldiers who committed breaches of the military code.\n\n====United States====\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]], the American Congress raised the legal limit on lashes from 39 to 100 for soldiers who were convicted by courts-martial.<ref>Martin, p 76.</ref> Generally, officers were not flogged.

This many lashes could permanently disable or kill a man. [[Charles Oman]], historian of the [[Peninsular War]], noted that the maximum sentence was inflicted \"nine or ten times by general court-martial during the whole six years of the war\" and that 1,000 lashes were administered about 50 times.<ref>Oman, p 239.</ref> Other sentences were for 900, 700, 500 and 300 lashes. One soldier was sentenced to 700 lashes for stealing a beehive.<ref>Oman, p 246.</ref> Another man was let off after only 175 of 400 lashes, but spent three weeks in the hospital.<ref>Oman, p 254.</ref> Later in the war, the more draconian punishments were abandoned and the offenders shipped to New South Wales instead, where more whippings often awaited them. (See [[Flagellation#Australian penal colonies|Australian penal colonies]] section.)

The [[King's German Legion]] (KGL), which were German units in British pay, did not flog. In one case, a British soldier on detached duty with the KGL was sentenced to be flogged, but the German commander refused to carry out the punishment. When the British 73rd Foot flogged a man in occupied France in 1814, disgusted French citizens protested against it.<ref>Rothenberg, p.179.</ref>\n\n====Singapore====\n{{Main|Caning in Singapore}}\nOne of few countries where corporal punishment is still officially used in the armed forces is [[Singapore]], where military legislation provides that errant soldiers can be sentenced by court-martial to strokes of the cane. It is also used for crimes including but not limited to rape, vandalism and molestation etc.\n\n=== Australian penal colonies ===\n[[File:FremantletPrisonWhippingPost 2005 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|[[Fremantle Prison]] whipping post.]]\n{{See also|History of Australia}}\n\nOnce common in the [[British Army]] and British [[Royal Navy]] as a means of discipline, flagellation also featured prominently in the British [[penal colony|penal colonies]] in [[early colonial Australia]]. Given that convicts in Australia were already \"imprisoned\", punishments for offenses committed there could not usually result in imprisonment and thus usually consisted of corporal punishment such as [[hard labour]] or flagellation. Unlike Roman times, British law explicitly forbade the combination of corporal and [[capital punishment]]; thus, a convict was either flogged or hanged but never both.\n\nFlagellation took place either with a single whip or, more notoriously, with the [[cat o' nine tails]]. Typically, the offender's upper half was bared and he was suspended by the wrists beneath a tripod of wooden beams (known as 'the triangle').  In many cases, the offender's feet barely touched ground, which helped to stretch the skin taut and increase the damage inflicted by the whip.  It also centered the offender's weight in his shoulders, further ensuring a painful experience.\n\nWith the prisoner thus stripped and bound, either one or two floggers administered the prescribed number of strokes, or \"lashes,\" to the victim's back. During the flogging, a doctor or other medical worker was consulted at regular intervals as to the condition of the prisoner.  In many cases, however, the physician merely observed the offender to determine whether he was conscious.  If the prisoner passed out, the physician would order a halt until the prisoner was revived, and then the whipping would continue.\n\nFemale convicts were also subject to flogging as punishment, both on the convict ships and in the penal colonies. Although they were generally given fewer lashes than males (usually limited to 40 in each flogging), there was no other difference between the manner in which males and females were flogged.\n\nFloggings of both male and female convicts were public, administered before the whole colony's company, assembled especially for the purpose.  In addition to the infliction of pain, one of the principal purposes of the flogging was to humiliate the offender in front of his mates and to demonstrate, in a forceful way, that he had been required to submit to authority.\n\nAt the conclusion of the whipping, the prisoner's lacerated back was normally rinsed with [[brine]], which served as a crude and painful disinfectant.\n\nFlogging still continued for years after independence. The last person flogged in Australia was [[William John O'Meally]] in 1958 in [[Melbourne]]'s [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]].\n\n=== Contemporary Syria ===\nIn [[Syria]] where torture of [[political dissent |Political Dissents]], [[Prisoners of War |POWs]] and [[Civilians]] is common,<ref>https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/12/16/if-dead-could-speak/mass-deaths-and-torture-syrias-detention-facilities</ref><ref>https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5135217/brutal-torture-in-syrian-prison-network-detailed-by-new-york-times-investigation-1.5135802</ref> flagellation has become one of the most common forms of [[Torture]]<ref>http://sn4hr.org/wp-content/pdf/english/Documentation_of_72_Torture_Methods_the_Syrian_Regime_Continues_to_Practice_in_Its_Detention_Centers_and_Military_Hospitals_en.pdf</ref>.

For a moderated subform of flagellation, described as ''bastinado'', the soles of a person's [[barefoot|bare feet]] are used as a target for beating (see [[foot whipping]]).\n\nIn some circumstances the word \"flogging\" is used loosely to include any sort of [[corporal punishment]], including [[birching]] and [[caning]]. However, in British legal terminology, a distinction was drawn (and still is, in one or two colonial territories) between \"flogging\" (with a [[cat-o'-nine-tails]]) and \"whipping\" (formerly with a whip, but since the early 19th century with a birch). In Britain these were both abolished in 1948.\n\n==Current use as punishment==\n{{main|Judicial corporal punishment}}\nOfficially abolished in most Western countries, flogging or whipping, including [[foot whipping]] in some countries, is still a common punishment in some parts of the world, particularly in [[Application of Islamic law by country|countries using Islamic law]] and in some territories formerly under British rule. Medically supervised [[caning]] is routinely ordered by the courts as a penalty for some categories of crime in [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]], [[Caning in Brunei|Brunei]], [[Caning in Malaysia|Malaysia]], Indonesia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and elsewhere.\n\nFlogging is a form of punishment used under Islamic [[Sharia]] law. It is the prescribed punishment (''[[hudud]]'') for offences including [[fornication]], alcohol use and slander and is also widely favoured as a discretionary punishment (''[[ta'zir]]'') for many offences, such as violating gender interaction laws (''[[zina]]''). Punishment is normally carried out in public. However, some scholars maintain that this goes against the teachings of Islam.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://islamqa.info/en/ref/72338/rape |title=Ruling on the crime of rape |date=9 January 2012}}</ref>\n[[Image:Prisoners whipped.jpg|thumb|200px|Prisoners at a whipping post in a [[Delaware]] prison, circa 1907]]\n\n==Historical use as punishment ==\n[[File:Johann Moritz Rugendas in Brazil.jpg|thumb|250px|Public flogging of a slave in [[Brazil]] - work of German painter [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]] (1802\u20131858).]]\n\n===Judaism===\n{{Main|Corporal punishment (Judaism)}}\n\nAccording to the [[Torah]] (Deuteronomy 25:1-3)  and [[Rabbinic law]] lashes may be given for offenses that do not merit capital punishment, and may not exceed 40. However, in the absence of a [[Sanhedrin]], corporal punishment is not practiced in Jewish law. [[Halakha]] specifies the lashes must be given in sets of three, so the total number cannot exceed 39. Also, the person whipped is first judged whether they can withstand the punishment, if not, the number of whips is decreased. [[Halakha|Jewish law]] limited flagellation to forty strokes, and in practice delivered thirty-nine, so as to avoid any possibility of breaking this law due to a miscount.\n\n===Antiquity===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nIn [[Sparta]], young men were flogged as a test of their masculinity.\n\nIn the [[Roman Empire]], flagellation was often used as a prelude to [[crucifixion]], and in this context is sometimes referred to as '''[[Scourge|scourging]]'''. Most famously according to the gospel accounts, [[Flagellation of Christ|this occurred]] prior to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion of Jesus Christ]].\n\nWhips with small pieces of metal or bone at the tips were commonly used. Such a device could easily cause disfigurement and serious trauma, such as ripping pieces of flesh from the body or loss of an eye. In addition to causing severe pain, the victim would approach a state of [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]] due to loss of blood.\n\nThe Romans reserved this treatment for non-citizens, as stated in the ''lex Porcia'' and ''lex Sempronia'', dating from 195 and 123 BC. The poet [[Horace]] refers to the ''horribile flagellum'' (horrible whip) in his ''Satires''. Typically, the one to be punished was stripped naked and bound to a low pillar so that he could bend over it, or chained to an upright pillar so as to be stretched out. Two [[lictor]]s (some reports indicate scourgings with four or six lictors) alternated blows from the bare shoulders down the body to the soles of the feet. There was no limit to the number of blows inflicted&mdash;this was left to the lictors to decide, though they were normally not supposed to kill the victim. Nonetheless, [[Livy]], [[Suetonius]] and [[Josephus]] report cases of flagellation where victims died while still bound to the post. Flagellation was referred to as \"half death\" by some authors, as many victims died shortly thereafter. [[Cicero]] reports in ''In Verrem'', ''\"{{lang|la|pro mortuo sublatus brevi postea mortuus}}\"'' (\"taken away for a dead man, shortly thereafter he was dead\").\n\n===From Middle Ages to modern times===\n[[File:Supplice du Grand Knout.jpg|thumb|Punishment with a [[knout]]. Russia, 18th century.]]\nThe Whipping Act was passed in [[England]] in 1530. Under this legislation, [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]]s were to be taken to a nearby populated area \"and there tied to the end of a cart naked and beaten with whips throughout such market town till the body shall be bloody\".<ref>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Whipping|volume=28|pages=590\u2013591}}</ref>\n\nIn England, offenders (mostly those convicted of theft) were usually sentenced to be flogged \"at a cart's tail\" along a length of public street, usually near the scene of the crime, \"until his [or her] back be bloody\". In the late seventeenth century, however, the courts occasionally ordered that the flogging should be carried out in prison or a [[house of correction]] rather than on the streets. From the 1720s courts began explicitly to differentiate between private whipping and public whipping. Over the course of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the proportion of whippings carried out in public declined, but the number of private whippings increased. The public whipping of women was abolished in 1817 (after having been in decline since the 1770s) and that of men ended in the early 1830s, though not formally abolished until 1862. Private whipping of men in prison continued and was not abolished until 1948.<ref>[http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Punishment.jsp#corporal London lives]</ref> The 1948 abolition did not affect the ability of a prison's visiting justices (in England and Wales, but not in Scotland, except at Peterhead) to order the birch or cat for prisoners committing serious assaults on prison staff. This power was not abolished until 1967, having been last used in 1962.<ref>[https://www.corpun.com/counukj.htm]</ref>\n\nWhipping occurred during the French Revolution, though not as official punishment.

This many lashes could permanently disable or kill a man. [[Charles Oman]], historian of the [[Peninsular War]], noted that the maximum sentence was inflicted \"nine or ten times by general court-martial during the whole six years of the war\" and that 1,000 lashes were administered about 50 times.<ref>Oman, p 239.</ref> Other sentences were for 900, 700, 500 and 300 lashes. One soldier was sentenced to 700 lashes for stealing a beehive.<ref>Oman, p 246.</ref> Another man was let off after only 175 of 400 lashes, but spent three weeks in the hospital.<ref>Oman, p 254.</ref> Later in the war, the more draconian punishments were abandoned and the offenders shipped to New South Wales instead, where more whippings often awaited them. (See [[Flagellation#Australian penal colonies|Australian penal colonies]] section.) Oman later wrote: {{quote|If anything was calculated to brutalize an army it was the wicked cruelty of the British military punishment code, which [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] to the end of his life supported. There is plenty of authority for the fact that the man who had once received his 500 lashes for a fault which was small, or which involved no moral guilt, was often turned thereby from a good soldier into a bad soldier, by losing his self-respect and having his sense of justice seared out. Good officers knew this well enough, and did their best to avoid the cat-of-nine-tails, and to try more rational means{{mdash}}more often than not with success.<ref>Oman, p.43.</ref>}}\n\nThe 3rd battalion's [[Royal Anglian Regiment]] nickname of \"The Steelbacks\" is taken from one of its former regiments, the [[48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot]] who earned the nickname for their stoicism when being flogged with the cat-o'-nine tails (\"Not a whimper under the lash\"), a routine method of administering punishment in the Army in the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\n====France====\nMeanwhile, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] the French Army stopped floggings altogether. The [[King's German Legion]] (KGL), which were German units in British pay, did not flog. In one case, a British soldier on detached duty with the KGL was sentenced to be flogged, but the German commander refused to carry out the punishment. When the British 73rd Foot flogged a man in occupied France in 1814, disgusted French citizens protested against it.<ref>Rothenberg, p.179.</ref>\n\n====Singapore====\n{{Main|Caning in Singapore}}\nOne of few countries where corporal punishment is still officially used in the armed forces is [[Singapore]], where military legislation provides that errant soldiers can be sentenced by court-martial to strokes of the cane. It is also used for crimes including but not limited to rape, vandalism and molestation etc.\n\n=== Australian penal colonies ===\n[[File:FremantletPrisonWhippingPost 2005 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|[[Fremantle Prison]] whipping post.]]\n{{See also|History of Australia}}\n\nOnce common in the [[British Army]] and British [[Royal Navy]] as a means of discipline, flagellation also featured prominently in the British [[penal colony|penal colonies]] in [[early colonial Australia]]. Given that convicts in Australia were already \"imprisoned\", punishments for offenses committed there could not usually result in imprisonment and thus usually consisted of corporal punishment such as [[hard labour]] or flagellation. Unlike Roman times, British law explicitly forbade the combination of corporal and [[capital punishment]]; thus, a convict was either flogged or hanged but never both.\n\nFlagellation took place either with a single whip or, more notoriously, with the [[cat o' nine tails]]. Typically, the offender's upper half was bared and he was suspended by the wrists beneath a tripod of wooden beams (known as 'the triangle').  In many cases, the offender's feet barely touched ground, which helped to stretch the skin taut and increase the damage inflicted by the whip.  It also centered the offender's weight in his shoulders, further ensuring a painful experience.\n\nWith the prisoner thus stripped and bound, either one or two floggers administered the prescribed number of strokes, or \"lashes,\" to the victim's back. During the flogging, a doctor or other medical worker was consulted at regular intervals as to the condition of the prisoner.  In many cases, however, the physician merely observed the offender to determine whether he was conscious.  If the prisoner passed out, the physician would order a halt until the prisoner was revived, and then the whipping would continue.\n\nFemale convicts were also subject to flogging as punishment, both on the convict ships and in the penal colonies. Although they were generally given fewer lashes than males (usually limited to 40 in each flogging), there was no other difference between the manner in which males and females were flogged.\n\nFloggings of both male and female convicts were public, administered before the whole colony's company, assembled especially for the purpose.  In addition to the infliction of pain, one of the principal purposes of the flogging was to humiliate the offender in front of his mates and to demonstrate, in a forceful way, that he had been required to submit to authority.\n\nAt the conclusion of the whipping, the prisoner's lacerated back was normally rinsed with [[brine]], which served as a crude and painful disinfectant.\n\nFlogging still continued for years after independence. The last person flogged in Australia was [[William John O'Meally]] in 1958 in [[Melbourne]]'s [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]].\n\n=== Contemporary Syria ===\nIn [[Syria]] where torture of [[Political Dissents]], [[Prisoners of War |POWs]] and [[Civilians]] is common,<ref>https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/12/16/if-dead-could-speak/mass-deaths-and-torture-syrias-detention-facilities</ref><ref>https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5135217/brutal-torture-in-syrian-prison-network-detailed-by-new-york-times-investigation-1.5135802</ref> flagellation has become one of the most common forms of [[Torture]]<ref>http://sn4hr.org/wp-content/pdf/english/Documentation_of_72_Torture_Methods_the_Syrian_Regime_Continues_to_Practice_in_Its_Detention_Centers_and_Military_Hospitals_en.pdf</ref>.

Both nations are members of the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]], [[Association of Academies of the Spanish Language]] and the [[United Nations]].\n\n==History==\n\nMexico and the Philippines share many traditions and customs, which derive from ties established over 400 years.

''Tulguhma'' meant dividing the whole army into various units, viz. the Left, the Right and the Centre. The Left and Right divisions were further subdivided into Forward and Rear divisions. Through this, a small army could be used to surround the enemy from all sides. The Centre Forward division was then provided with carts (''araba'') which were placed in rows facing the enemy and tied to each other with animal hide ropes.

It took place in north India and marked the beginning of the [[Mughal Empire]] and the end of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. This was one of the earliest battles involving [[gunpowder warfare|gunpowder firearms]] and [[field artillery]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] which were introduced by [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in this battle.{{sfn|Butalia|1998|p=16}}\n\n[[File:Vaki'at-i Baburi - The Battle of Panipat (1526) by Deo Gujarati.jpg|thumb|right|The battle of Panipat between the armies of Babur and Ibrahim Lodi (1526). Babur was invited by Daulat Khan Lodi to enter India and defeat Ibrahim Lodi.{{sfn|Chandra|2009|p=27-31}} An illustration to the Vaqi 'at-i Baburi, by Deo Gujarati, c. 1590]]\n\n== Background ==\nAfter losing [[Samarkand]] for the second time, [[Babur]] gave attention to conquer [[India]] as he reached the banks of the [[Chenab river|Chenab]] in 1519.{{sfn|Mahajan|1980|p=429}} Until 1524, his aim was to only expand his rule to [[Punjab region|Punjab]], mainly to fulfil his ancestor [[Timur]]'s legacy, since it used to be part of his empire.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=27\u201329}} At that time, parts of north India were under the rule of [[Ibrahim Lodi]] of the [[Lodi dynasty]], but the empire was crumbling and there were many defectors. He received invitations from Daulat Khan Lodi, Governor of Punjab and Ala-ud-Din, uncle of Ibrahim.{{sfn|Chaurasia|2002|p=89-90}} He sent an ambassador to Ibrahim, asking him to get punished by him and he is rightful to the throne of the country, however, the ambassador was detained at Lahore and released months later.{{sfn|Mahajan|1980|p=429}}\n\nBabur started for Lahore, Punjab, in 1524 but found that Daulat Khan Lodi had been driven out by forces sent by Ibrahim Lodi.{{sfn|Chandra|2007|p=27}} When Babur arrived at Lahore, the Lodi army marched out and was routed.{{sfn|Chandra|2007|p=27}} In response, Babur burned and punished the people of Lahore for two days, then marched to Dipalpur, placing Alam Khan, another rebel uncle of Lodi's, as governor. Alam Khan was quickly overthrown and fled to Kabul. In response, Babur supplied Alam Khan with troops who later joined up with Daulat Khan Lodi and together with about 30,000 troops, they besieged Ibrahim Lodi at Delhi.{{sfn|Chandra|2007|p=28}} He defeated them and drove Alam's army off, and Babur realised Lodi would not allow him to occupy the Punjab.{{sfn|Chandra|2007|p=28}}\n\n==Battle==\nHearing of the size of Ibrahim's army, Babur secured his right flank against the city of [[Panipat]], while digging a trench covered with tree branches to secure his left flanks. In the centre, he placed 700 carts tied together with ropes. Between every two carts, there were breastworks for his matchlock men. Babur also ensured there {{sfn|Chandra|2009|p=29}}\n\nWhen Ibrahim's army arrived, he found the approach to Babur's army too narrow to attack. While Ibrahim redeployed his forces to allow for the narrower front, Babur quickly took advantage of the situation to flank (''tulghuma'') the Lodi army.{{sfn|Chandra|2009|p=30}} Many of Ibrahim's troops were unable to get into action, and fled when the battle turned them.{{sfn|Watts|2011}p=707}} Ibrahim Lodi was killed while trying to retreat and beheaded. 20,000 Lodi soldiers were killed in the battle.{{sfn|Chandra|2009|p=30}}\n\n===Advantage of cannons in the battle===\nBabur's guns proved decisive in battle, firstly because Ibrahim lacked any field artillery, but also because the sound of the cannon frightened Ibrahim's elephants, causing them to trample his own men.{{sfn|Watts|2011|p=707}}\n\n===Tactics===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}\n[[File:Babur introduced field guns at panipat, 1526.jpg|thumb|left|Babur introduced field guns at Panipat, 1526]]\nTactics used by Babur were the ''tulguhma'' and the ''araba''. ''Tulguhma'' meant dividing the whole army into various units, viz. the Left, the Right and the Centre. The Left and Right divisions were further subdivided into Forward and Rear divisions. Through this, a small army could be used to surround the enemy from all sides. The Centre Forward division was then provided with carts (''araba'') which were placed in rows facing the enemy and tied to each other with animal hide ropes. Behind them were placed cannons protected and supported by [[mantlet]]s which could be used to easily manoeuvre the cannons. These two tactics made Babur's artillery lethal. The cannons could be fired without any fear of being hit, as they were shielded by the bullock carts held in place by hide ropes. The heavy cannons could also be easily traversed onto new targets, as they could be manoeuvred by the mantlets which were on wheels.\n\n==Aftermath==\nIbrahim Lodi died on the field of battle along with 20,000 of his troops.
