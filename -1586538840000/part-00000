His father, the Rev. [[Edwin Otway Burnham]] of [[Kentucky]], a long time [[frontiersman]] and missionary died when Burnham was only 3, leaving the family destitute. He and his mother, Rebecca (Elizabeth) Russell Burnham, originally from [[Westminster]], [[Middlesex]], [[England]], left to live with an Uncle in [[Iowa]], but his brother Fred, then 12, stayed in California to repay the family debts and to make his own way.<ref name=\"scouting\">{{cite book |last=Burnham |first=Frederick Russell |authorlink=Frederick Russell Burnham |title=Scouting on Two Continents |publisher=Doubleday, Page & company |year=1926 |location= |pages= |oclc=407686 }}</ref><ref name=\"lott1981\">{{cite book |last=Lott | first=Jack | authorlink= Jack Lott |editor-first=Craig | editor-last=Boddington |title=America \u2013 The Men and Their Guns That Made Her Great |publisher=Petersen Publishing Co. |year=1981 |pages=77\u201391 |chapter=Chapter 8.

Ill with an injured leg, his brother sent him the money to return to Los Angeles.  His leg was removed four inches below the knee.  He also suffered from [[tuberculosis]] and following the amputation he had a long convalescence.  For those two years he lived with his brother who taught him how to shoot, saddle a horse and pack animal, the art of [[scoutcraft]] and  how to ride the range, and all of this in spite of his wooden leg.  A voracious reader with an amazing memory, he enjoyed books on military strategies and tactics, and was fascinated by history, [[geology]], [[metallurgy]], and mining.  He roamed the deserts from [[Death Valley]] to lower California, living among and learning from the [[Cahuilla]] Indians of Agua Caliente (now [[Palm Springs, California]]), and teaming up at times with solitary prospectors to learn desert prospecting, pocket hunting, and the mysteries of the \"great horn spoon\" (probably the [[California Gold Rush]]).<ref name=\"chances\"/>\n\nIn 1888, during one of his desert prospecting excursions, Burnham had a shoot-out with an Indian (not Cahuilla).<ref name=\"chances\"/> He was on an old trail leading over the mountains between [[Kawia]] and [[San Jacinto, California|San Jacinto]] and less than an hour before the attack he met an Indian with whom he had a conversation in Spanish.  Burnham continued on the trail until he heard a slight report and felt something hit his right leg, and then a second report resulting in a flesh wound to his left leg.  He immediately threw himself flat on the ground and commenced cautiously eyeing the surrounding country for the enemy.  When saw a hat rising from behind a rock about 150 yards away, he drew his pistol and fired on the hat.  His enemy fled down the Los Coyotes creek, down the canyon trail Burnham had been following, with the intent to assume a new ambush.  Burnham recognized his enemy as the Indian he had met a short time earlier and he knew that this Indian was carrying a Winchester rifle and had him out-gunned.  Burnham left his pack animal, tools, provisions and blankets and quickly fled on his horse down a steep cliff away from the trail and to safety in San Jacinto.<ref name=\"sfchronicle25jun1888\">{{cite news |title= Indian Raiders: Southern California not yet exempt from them |newspaper= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |location=[[San Francisco, California]] |issn= 1932-8672 |date=June 25, 1888|page=8}}</ref>\n\nFor the next few years, Burnham studied mining and worked on and off in the California desert as mining engineer at the [[Alvord mine]], a gold mine owned and operated by the Burnham-Clapp family and their Pasadena business partners 1885\u20131891.<ref name=\"vanwyk\">{{cite book |last=van Wyke |first=Peter |title=Burnham: Chief of Scouts |publisher=Trafford Publishing|year=2003 |location=Victoria, Canada |pages=38, 168 |isbn= 1-879373-66-1}}</ref><ref name=\"latimes8sep1891\">{{cite news |title= Pasadena; Personal |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |location=[[Los Angeles, California]] |issn= 0458-3035 |date=September 8, 1891|page=7 |quote=Howard Burnham will return to the Alvord mine today.}}</ref><ref name=\"alvordmine\">{{cite web |url= http://mojavedesert.net/desert-fever/alvord.html |title=Alvord Mine |accessdate=February 1, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"familyletters\">{{cite book |last=Bradford |first=Mary E |author2=Richard H Bradford |title=An American family on the African frontier: the Burnham family letters, 1893\u20131896 |publisher=Roberts Rinehart|year=1993 |location=Niwot, Colorado |page=7 |isbn= 1-879373-66-1}}</ref> He received his professional mining certification from the Pacific Chemical Works of San Francisco, an assay company owned and operated by [[Henry Garber Hanks]], the first State Mineralogist for California.<ref name=\"miningcert\">{{cite news |title= Pacific Chemical Works mining certificate |location=[[San Francisco]] |date=July 7, 1890 |quote= certification to assay gold, silver, lead, tin, and mercury, and the determination of minerals and the use of blacopipe.}}</ref><ref name=\"stategeologists\">{{cite web |url=http://www.consrv.ca.gov/cgs/cgs_history |archive-url=https://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090430000640/http://www.consrv.ca.gov/cgs/cgs_history |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 30, 2009 |title=California Geological Survey \u2013 State Geologists |accessdate=February 1, 2010 |quote=Henry Garber Hanks State Mineralogist 1880\u20131886.

In 1914, he was incarcerated near [[Tampico, Mexico]] as a suspected spy, and was released with the help of [[William Jennings Bryan]], the U.S. Secretary of State.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Mather Howard Burnham U.S. passport application affidavit/identifying documents, U.S. consulate, Barcelona, Spain, 26 February 1915</ref> He immediately left Mexico for France and stopped in [[Barcelona, Spain]] on his way to [[Algiers, Algeria]], then a French colony that the German Intelligence had infiltrated to support of the rebels.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> He was sent on a dangerous mission to lead 28 soldiers into the desert, meet with the rebels, and persuade them to make peace with the French.  On the way, the group encountered a hostile clan, lost 20 men, exhausted all of their ammunition, and were taken prisoner. All were executed, except Burnham. A sheik elder with the clan had earlier gotten into trouble with the French in Algiers and Burnham had come to his defense, leading to the release of the man.  Burnham returned to Algiers alone and was then sent to France.<ref name=\"chances\"/> \n \nIn 1917, [[List of intelligence agencies of France|French intelligence]] then sent Burnham across enemy lines as a spy to discover if the Germans were preparing a new front through the [[Alps]]. Traveling through neutral [[Switzerland]], Burnham assumed his former identity as an American mining engineer and crossed into Germany on the plea of extreme ill-health \u2013 his tuberculosis had violently resurfaced. Burnham had spent much time before the war in German spas, and his work for the French intelligence had been classified, so the real reason for his near-death return was not suspected by the authorities. Additionally, he was traveling with large quantities of American gold coins for his treatment and gold was desperately needed in wartime Germany. Nevertheless, Burnham was both searched and closely watched throughout his stay.<ref name=\"chances\"/>\n \nWhile in Germany, Burnham applied his engineering skills to converting simple household materials in useful surveying instruments, and he used his wooden leg to conceal these tools when he traveled to places such as [[Bad Nauheim]]. Due to the high cost of his treatments, $500 a month paid in gold, Burnham was a welcome visitor at every resort in Germany.  Still, all of his correspondence was reviewed and at the insistence of German authorities he was frequently escorted by one or more nurses and a private secretary. Since he was unable to permanently record his surveys and other findings on paper, he relied on his remarkable memory.<ref name=\"chances\"/>\n \nBurnham became very ill and was allowed to return to Switzerland for his health. The French government quickly transported Burnham to [[Cannes, France]]. From his death bed, Burnham shared his secrets with other intelligence officers and the French government transported his family from England to Cannes. The data Burnham had gathered was convincing: the Germans were not opening a new front in Alps and there was no need to move allied troops away from the Western Front.  His dying words he whispered to his surgeon: \"Always have I wanted to help pay the debt my country has owed to France. Go back to the front and save the living.  I am already dead.\" He was buried in Cannes beside the tomb of [[A. Kingsley Macomber]], another American, to honor the French Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse]] whose fleet had enabled [[George Washington]] to force the surrender of [[Lord Cornwallis]] at [[Yorktown, Virginia]] in 1781.<ref name=\"chances\"/>\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Fhcbabyfred.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Frederick Russell Burnham, M.

He immediately threw himself flat on the ground and commenced cautiously eyeing the surrounding country for the enemy.  When saw a hat rising from behind a rock about 150 yards away, he drew his pistol and fired on the hat.  His enemy fled down the Los Coyotes creek, down the canyon trail Burnham had been following, with the intent to assume a new ambush.  Burnham recognized his enemy as the Indian he had met a short time earlier and he knew that this Indian was carrying a Winchester rifle and had him out-gunned.  Burnham left his pack animal, tools, provisions and blankets and quickly fled on his horse down a steep cliff away from the trail and to safety in San Jacinto.<ref name=\"sfchronicle25jun1888\">{{cite news |title= Indian Raiders: Southern California not yet exempt from them |newspaper= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |location=[[San Francisco, California]] |issn= 1932-8672 |date=June 25, 1888|page=8}}</ref>\n\nFor the next few years, Burnham studied mining and worked on and off in the California desert as mining engineer at the [[Alvord mine]], a gold mine owned and operated by the Burnham-Clapp family and their Pasadena business partners 1885\u20131891.<ref name=\"vanwyk\">{{cite book |last=van Wyke |first=Peter |title=Burnham: Chief of Scouts |publisher=Trafford Publishing|year=2003 |location=Victoria, Canada |pages=38, 168 |isbn= 1-879373-66-1}}</ref><ref name=\"latimes8sep1891\">{{cite news |title= Pasadena; Personal |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |location=[[Los Angeles, California]] |issn= 0458-3035 |date=September 8, 1891|page=7 |quote=Howard Burnham will return to the Alvord mine today.}}</ref><ref name=\"alvordmine\">{{cite web |url= http://mojavedesert.net/desert-fever/alvord.html |title=Alvord Mine |accessdate=February 1, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"familyletters\">{{cite book |last=Bradford |first=Mary E |author2=Richard H Bradford |title=An American family on the African frontier: the Burnham family letters, 1893\u20131896 |publisher=Roberts Rinehart|year=1993 |location=Niwot, Colorado |page=7 |isbn= 1-879373-66-1}}</ref> He received his professional mining certification from the Pacific Chemical Works of San Francisco, an assay company owned and operated by [[Henry Garber Hanks]], the first State Mineralogist for California.<ref name=\"miningcert\">{{cite news |title= Pacific Chemical Works mining certificate |location=[[San Francisco]] |date=July 7, 1890 |quote= certification to assay gold, silver, lead, tin, and mercury, and the determination of minerals and the use of blacopipe.}}</ref><ref name=\"stategeologists\">{{cite web |url=http://www.consrv.ca.gov/cgs/cgs_history |archive-url=https://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090430000640/http://www.consrv.ca.gov/cgs/cgs_history |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 30, 2009 |title=California Geological Survey \u2013 State Geologists |accessdate=February 1, 2010 |quote=Henry Garber Hanks State Mineralogist 1880\u20131886.

In 1914, he was incarcerated near [[Tampico, Mexico]] as a suspected spy, and was released with the help of [[William Jennings Bryan]], the U.S. Secretary of State.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Mather Howard Burnham U.S. passport application affidavit/identifying documents, U.S. consulate, Barcelona, Spain, 26 February 1915</ref> He immediately left Mexico for France and stopped in [[Barcelona, Spain]] on his way to [[Algiers, Algeria]], then a French colony that the German Intelligence had infiltrated to support of the rebels.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> He was sent on a dangerous mission to lead 28 soldiers into the desert, meet with the rebels, and persuade them to make peace with the French.  On the way, the group encountered a hostile clan, lost 20 men, exhausted all of their ammunition, and were taken prisoner. All were executed, except Burnham. A sheik elder with the clan had earlier gotten into trouble with the French in Algiers and Burnham had come to his defense, leading to the release of the man.  Burnham returned to Algiers alone and was then sent to France.<ref name=\"chances\"/> \n \nIn 1917, [[List of intelligence agencies of France|French intelligence]] then sent Burnham across enemy lines as a spy to discover if the Germans were preparing a new front through the [[Alps]]. Traveling through neutral [[Switzerland]], Burnham assumed his former identity as an American mining engineer and crossed into Germany on the plea of extreme ill-health \u2013 his tuberculosis had violently resurfaced. Burnham had spent much time before the war in German spas, and his work for the French intelligence had been classified, so the real reason for his near-death return was not suspected by the authorities. Additionally, he was traveling with large quantities of American gold coins for his treatment and gold was desperately needed in wartime Germany. Nevertheless, Burnham was both searched and closely watched throughout his stay.<ref name=\"chances\"/>\n \nWhile in Germany, Burnham applied his engineering skills to converting simple household materials in useful surveying instruments, and he used his wooden leg to conceal these tools when he traveled to places such as [[Bad Nauheim]]. Due to the high cost of his treatments, $500 a month paid in gold, Burnham was a welcome visitor at every resort in Germany.  Still, all of his correspondence was reviewed and at the insistence of German authorities he was frequently escorted by one or more nurses and a private secretary. Since he was unable to permanently record his surveys and other findings on paper, he relied on his remarkable memory.<ref name=\"chances\"/>\n \nBurnham became very ill and was allowed to return to Switzerland for his health. The French government quickly transported Burnham to [[Cannes, France]]. From his death bed, Burnham shared his secrets with other intelligence officers and the French government transported his family from England to Cannes. The data Burnham had gathered was convincing: the Germans were not opening a new front in Alps and there was no need to move allied troops away from the Western Front.  His dying words he whispered to his surgeon: \"Always have I wanted to help pay the debt my country has owed to France. Go back to the front and save the living.  I am already dead.\" He was buried in Cannes beside the tomb of [[A. Kingsley Macomber]], another American, to honor the French Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse]] whose fleet had enabled [[George Washington]] to force the surrender of [[Lord Cornwallis]] at [[Yorktown, Virginia]] in 1781.<ref name=\"chances\"/>\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Fhcbabyfred.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Frederick Russell Burnham, M.

They bring in two train experts to join the crew and plot the heist from a rented farmhouse in the [[Aylesbury Vale]], where they plan to hide out for a week until things calm down. But when the heist nets a record score of more than \u00a32.6 million (equivalent to \u00a3{{Inflation|UK|2.6|1963}} million today), Reynolds knows the police will be hot on their trail.\n |LineColor=bfe0bf\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=2\n |Title=A Copper's Tale\n |DirectedBy=[[James Strong (director)|James Strong]]\n |WrittenBy=Chris Chibnall\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2013|12|19|df=yes}}\n |Aux4=5.99\n |ShortSummary= Four days after the biggest robbery in British history to date, [[Flying Squad]] Chief Superintendent [[Tommy Butler]] is brought in to lead the investigation by the [[Henry Brooke, Baron Brooke of Cumnor |Home Secretary]]. Though the heist occurred in Buckinghamshire, Butler is convinced it was organised by London criminals, and he compiles his own dream team of detectives to hunt them down. They come up with shortlists of suspects among known criminals and [[Bruce Reynolds]] is on that list. A \u00a310,000 reward for information leads to a tip from a neighbour about the rented farmhouse, but they are soon drowning in hoax callers and fake tips.

Bees are adapted for feeding on [[nectar]] and [[pollen]], the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for [[protein]] and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for [[larva]]e. Bee pollination is important both ecologically and [[List of crop plants pollinated by bees|commercially]]. The decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees.\n\nBees range in size from tiny [[stingless bee]] species whose workers are less than {{convert|2|mm|inch|2}} long, to ''[[Megachile pluto]]'', the largest species of [[Megachilidae|leafcutter bee]], whose females can attain a length of {{convert|39|mm|inch|2}}. The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the [[Halictidae]], or sweat bees, but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies. Vertebrate predators of bees include birds such as [[bee-eater]]s; insect predators include [[beewolf|beewolves]] and [[dragonfly|dragonflies]].\n\nHuman [[beekeeping]] or apiculture has been practised for millennia, since at least the times of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Greece]]. Apart from honey and pollination, honey bees produce beeswax, [[royal jelly]] and [[propolis]]. Bees have appeared in mythology and folklore, through all phases of art and literature, from ancient times to the present day, though primarily focused in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], where beekeeping is far more common.\n\nThe analysis of 353 wild bee and hoverfly species across Britain from 1980 to 2013 found the insects have been lost from a quarter of the places they inhabited in 1980.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/26/widespread-losses-of-pollinating-insects-revealed-across-britain |title=Widespread losses of pollinating insects revealed across Britain |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Evolution ==\n[[File:Melittosphex burmensis.jpg|thumb|''[[Melittosphex burmensis]]'', a fossil bee preserved in [[amber]] from the [[Early Cretaceous]] (100 to 145 million years ago) of [[Myanmar]]]]\n\nThe ancestors of bees were [[wasp]]s in the family [[Crabronidae]], which were [[Predation|predators]] of other insects.

The adult does not provide care for the brood once the egg is laid, and usually dies after making one or more nests. The males typically emerge first and are ready for mating when the females emerge. Solitary bees are either stingless or very unlikely to sting (only in self-defense, if ever).<ref>{{cite web |title=Solitary Bees (Hymenoptera) |url=http://www.royensoc.co.uk/insect_info/what/solitary_bees.htm |publisher=Royal Entomological Society |accessdate=12 October 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702005458/http://www.royensoc.co.uk/insect_info/what/solitary_bees.htm |archivedate=2 July 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Other bees |url=http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/identification/other-bees/ |publisher=Bumblebee Conservation Trust |accessdate=12 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905113303/http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/identification/other-bees/ |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Osmia cornifrons.5.1.08.w.jpg|thumb|The [[mason bee]] ''[[Osmia cornifrons]]'' nests in a hole in dead wood.

Most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom. The males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate. The sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised; after mating, a female stores the sperm, and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid, fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs, males. Tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no [[diapause]] stage.<ref name=Roubik1992>{{cite book |author=Roubik, David W. |title=Ecology and Natural History of Tropical Bees |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljlaYMeI6noC |year=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42909-2 |page=15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617144437/https://books.google.com/books?id=ljlaYMeI6noC |archivedate=17 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The bumblebee lifecycle|url=http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/lifecycle/|publisher=Bumblebee Conservation Trust|accessdate=1 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629043439/http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/lifecycle/|archivedate=29 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Learning About Honey Bees |url=http://www.scmidstatebeekeepers.org/honeybeelifecycle.htm |publisher=The South Carolina Mid-State Beekeepers Association |accessdate=1 July 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701180422/http://www.scmidstatebeekeepers.org/honeybeelifecycle.htm |archivedate=1 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Solitary Bees |url=http://www.nationalbeeunit.com/downloadDocument.cfm?id=901 |publisher=National Bee Unit |accessdate=1 July 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701202809/http://www.nationalbeeunit.com/downloadDocument.cfm?id=901 |archivedate=1 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe egg is generally oblong, slightly curved and tapering at one end.

They have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle. There is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce a cocoon. The cocoon is semi-transparent and the pupa can be seen through it.

Most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom. The males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate. The sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised; after mating, a female stores the sperm, and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid, fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs, males.

''RCGS Resolute'', which had left Buenos Aires on 5 March,<ref name=\"chronicleherald17march\" /> had been adrift in the open sea for a day while carrying out routine maintenance on the starboard main engine before reaching her next destination, [[Willemstad]] in [[Cura\u00e7ao]]. After having questioned her intentions over radio, the Venezuelan Coast Guard vessel ordered ''RCGS Resolute'' to follow her to  [[Puerto Moreno]] on the eastern side of [[Margarita Island]]. While the master was in contact with the company's head office and [[designated person ashore]] (DPA), warning shots were fired from ''Naiguat\u00e1'' and, shortly afterwards, the Venezuelan patrol boat purposely rammed the cruise ship's starboard bow. During an apparent attempt to change the heading of ''RCGS Resolute'' towards Venezuelan territorial waters, ''Naiguat\u00e1'' came in contact with the cruise ship's [[ice class|ice-strengthened]] [[bulbous bow]], started to take water, and eventually sank. ''RCGS Resolute'', which had a crew of 32 onboard but was not carrying passengers, survived the encounter with superficial damage and remained on site for over an hour to provide assistance until being allowed to continue towards Willemstad by Joint [[Rescue Coordination Centre]] (JRCC) Cura\u00e7ao.<ref name=\"ccs_statement\">{{cite  web|url=https://www.columbia-cs.com/statement-on-rcgs-resolute-incident/|title=Statement on RCGS RESOLUTE incident|publisher=Columbia Cruise Services|date=1 April 2020|accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn a statement released by Venezuela on 31 March, ''RCGS Resolute'' was accused of committing an act of \"aggression and piracy\" by intentionally ramming and sinking ''Naiguat\u00e1'' while the patrol boat was conducting a maritime traffic control operation, as well as of acting \"cowardly and criminal\" for not participating in the search and rescue of the patrol boat's crew of 44, all of which were rescued by other Venezuelan vessels.<ref name=\"bbc3Apr2020\" /><ref name=\"bnv_statement\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mindefensa.gob.ve/mindefensa/2020/03/31/comunicado-oficial-de-la-fuerza-armada-nacional-bolivariana-5/|title=Comunicado Oficial de la Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana|language=Spanish|publisher=Ministry of Defense|date=31 March 2020|accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref> An illustration of the incident released by the Venezuelan Navy describes ''RCGS Resolute'' turning hard starboard to ram ''Naiguat\u00e1'' while the patrol boat was sailing alongside the cruise ship.

On 28 March, the vessel had stopped in the open sea to allow the crew to carry out maintenance work in the engine room. After drifting closer to the Venezuelan coast on the following day, ''RCGS Resolute'' had resumed sailing west for about 90 minutes until the ship had passed La Tortuga Island and then continued adrift to a westerly direction while the starboard main engine [[turbocharger]] was being serviced.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\nOn the night of 30 March, ''RCGS Resolute'' was contacted by the Venezuelan Coast Guard patrol boat ''Naiguat\u00e1'' at around quarter past midnight. After a brief questioning over VHF, the cruise ship was ordered to follow the Venezuelan vessel to Puerto Moreno on the basis that the Portuguese-flagged vessel was violating Venezuelan territorial waters. After consulting with the company designated person ashore (DPA), ''RCGS Resolute'' announced that the vessel would start engines and resume voyage to Cura\u00e7ao.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\nAt around 01:05 [[Time in Venezuela|local time]], ''Naiguat\u00e1'' approached ''RCGS Resolute'' from the starboard quarter and, after suddenly changing course to port, collided with the bow of the cruise ship at a relative angle of about 45 degrees between the vessels. Few minutes after the initial impact, ''RCGS Resolute''{{'}}s master ordered the port side [[controllable pitch propeller]] first to zero pitch and then to astern thrust in order to separate the two vessels. The company DPA instructed the cruise ship to remain on site and contact the local Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC). At 01:38, about half an hour after the collision, ''Naiguat\u00e1''{{'}}s [[AIS-SART]] was activated but ''RCGS Resolute'' was unable to establish contact with the sinking Venezuelan vessel over VHF and instead reached out to JRCC Cura\u00e7ao. About one hour later, the Venezuelan crew was seen preparing [[liferaft]]s for launching. At 02:43, JRCC Cura\u00e7ao relayed a statement from the Venezuelan authority responsible for the region, MRCC La Guairaa, that ''RCGS Resolute''{{'}}s assistance was no longer needed on site and instructed the cruise ship to proceed to Willemstad in order to avoid problems with the Venezuelan Navy.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\nAlthough the Portuguese authorities have not obtained statements from the Venezuelan Navy, the report discusses the possibility that the unexpected change in ''Naiguat\u00e1''{{'}}s heading just before the collision, as reported by ''RCGS Resolute'', may have been caused by a suction effect between the vessels as the faster patrol boat passed the bow of the cruise ship. Although the collision may have not been intentional ramming, the conclusion was nonetheless that the incident that led to the sinking of ''Naiguat\u00e1'' was a deliberate act initiated by the Venezuelan Navy rather than an accidental occurrence.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Hapag-Lloyd Cruises}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:RCGS Resolute}}\n[[Category:Cruise ships]]\n[[Category:1991 ships]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Rauma, Finland]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 2020]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Cruise ship}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{|{{Infobox ship begin|display title=''RCGS Resolute''}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n| Ship image = RCGS Resolute.jpg\n| Ship caption = ''RCGS Resolute'' in [[Aberdeen]] in June 2019\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n| Hide header = \n| Ship name = *''Society Adventurer'' (1991\u20131993)\n*''Hanseatic'' (1993\u20132018)\n*''RCGS Resolute'' (2018\u2013present)\n| Ship owner = * [[Discoverer Reederei]] (planned)<ref name=\"id\" />\n* Society Adventurer Shipping Company (1991\u20131993)<ref name=\"id\" />\n* Bunnys Adventure & Cruise Shipping Co Ltd (1993\u2013present)<ref name=\"seaweb\" />\n| Ship operator = * [[Hanseatic Tours]] (1993\u20131997)\n* [[Hapag-Lloyd Cruises]] (1997\u20132018)\n* [[One Ocean Expeditions]] (2018\u20132019)<ref name=\"seaweb\" />\n| Ship registry = * [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], {{BAH}} (1991\u20132018)\n* [[Madeira, Portugal|Madeira]], {{POR}} (2018\u2013present)<ref name=\"seaweb\" />\n| Ship route = \n| Ship ordered = 22 December 1989<ref name=\"dnv\" />\n| Ship builder = [[Finnish maritime cluster|Rauma Yards]] ([[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]], [[Finland]])<ref name=\"id\">{{cite|last1=Id|first1=Kalle|last2=Peter|first2=Bruce|title=Innovation and Specialisation \u2014 A History of Shipbuilding in Finland|publisher=Nautilus|year=2017|ISBN=9788790924683|page=}}</ref>\n| Ship original cost = US$75 million<ref name=\"id\" />\n| Ship yard number =306<ref name=\"dnv\" />\n| Ship laid down = 3 September 1990<ref name=\"dnv\" />\n| Ship launched = 5 January 1991<ref name=\"dnv\" />\n| Ship completed = 7 June 1991<ref name=\"dnv\" />\n| Ship christened = \n| Ship acquired = \n| Ship maiden voyage = 27 March 1993<ref name=\"fof\" />\n| Ship in service = \n| Ship out of service = \n|Ship identification=* [[Maritime call sign|Call sign]]: CQAL6\n* {{IMO Number|9000168}}\n* {{MMSI|255806208}}<ref name=\"equasis\">{{csr|register=E|id=9000168|shipname=RCGS Resolute|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n* {{ship register|DNV|G99209}}<ref name=\"dnv\">{{csr|register=DNV|id=G99209|shipname=RCGS Resolute|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n| Ship status = In service\n| Ship notes = \n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n| Hide header = \n| Header caption = <ref name=\"dnv\" /><ref name=\"Hapag\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurolloyd.com/Hapag-Lloyd/HANSEATIC.pdf|title=MS ''Hanseatic'' Ship details|publisher=Hapag-Lloyd|accessdate=28 February 2009|format=PDF}}</ref>\n| Ship type = [[Cruise ship]]\n| Ship tonnage =* {{GT|8,445}}\n* {{NetT|2,573}}\n* {{DWT|1,177}}\n| Ship displacement = 5,892{{nbsp}}tonnes<ref name=\"seaweb\" />\n| Ship length = {{convert|124.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n| Ship beam = {{convert|18.00|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n| Ship height = \n| Ship draught = \n| Ship draft = {{convert|4.9|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n| Ship depth = {{convert|7|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n| Ship decks = 6\n| Ship deck clearance = \n| Ship ramps = \n| Ship ice class = [[DNV GL]] E4\n| Ship power = 2{{nbsp}}&times;{{nbsp}}[[MaK]] 8M453C (2{{nbsp}}&times;{{nbsp}}2,940{{nbsp}}kW)<ref name=\"seaweb\">{{csr|register=SEAWEB|id=9000168|shipname=RCGS Resolute|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n| Ship propulsion = Two shafts; [[controllable pitch propeller]]s\n| Ship speed = {{convert|16|kn}}\n| Ship range= {{convert|8600|nmi}}\n| Ship capacity = 184 passengers in 88 cabins and four suites\n| Ship crew = 125\n| Ship notes = \n}}\n|}\n\n{{commonscat|IMO 9000168|RCGS Resolute}}\n\n'''''RCGS Resolute''''' is a [[star (classification)|five-star]] [[ice class|ice-strengthened]] expedition [[cruise ship]].

''RCGS Resolute'', which had left Buenos Aires on 5 March,<ref name=\"chronicleherald17march\" /> had been adrift in the open sea for a day while carrying out routine maintenance on the starboard main engine before reaching her next destination, [[Willemstad]] in [[Cura\u00e7ao]]. After having questioned her intentions over radio, the Venezuelan Coast Guard vessel ordered ''RCGS Resolute'' to follow her to  [[Puerto Moreno]] on the eastern side of [[Margarita Island]]. While the master was in contact with the company's head office and [[designated person ashore]] (DPA), warning shots were fired from ''Naiguat\u00e1'' and, shortly afterwards, the Venezuelan patrol boat purposely rammed the cruise ship's starboard bow. During an apparent attempt to change the heading of ''RCGS Resolute'' towards Venezuelan territorial waters, ''Naiguat\u00e1'' came in contact with the cruise ship's [[ice class|ice-strengthened]] [[bulbous bow]], started to take water, and eventually sank. ''RCGS Resolute'', which had a crew of 32 onboard but was not carrying passengers, survived the encounter with superficial damage and remained on site for over an hour to provide assistance until being allowed to continue towards Willemstad by Joint [[Rescue Coordination Centre]] (JRCC) Cura\u00e7ao.<ref name=\"ccs_statement\">{{cite  web|url=https://www.columbia-cs.com/statement-on-rcgs-resolute-incident/|title=Statement on RCGS RESOLUTE incident|publisher=Columbia Cruise Services|date=1 April 2020|accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn a statement released by Venezuela on 31 March, ''RCGS Resolute'' was accused of committing an act of \"aggression and piracy\" by intentionally ramming and sinking ''Naiguat\u00e1'' while the patrol boat was conducting a maritime traffic control operation, as well as of acting \"cowardly and criminal\" for not participating in the search and rescue of the patrol boat's crew of 44, all of which were rescued by other Venezuelan vessels.<ref name=\"bbc3Apr2020\" /><ref name=\"bnv_statement\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mindefensa.gob.ve/mindefensa/2020/03/31/comunicado-oficial-de-la-fuerza-armada-nacional-bolivariana-5/|title=Comunicado Oficial de la Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana|language=Spanish|publisher=Ministry of Defense|date=31 March 2020|accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref> An illustration of the incident released by the Venezuelan Navy describes ''RCGS Resolute'' turning hard starboard to ram ''Naiguat\u00e1'' while the patrol boat was sailing alongside the cruise ship.

On 28 March, the vessel had stopped in the open sea to allow the crew to carry out maintenance work in the engine room. After drifting closer to the Venezuelan coast on the following day, ''RCGS Resolute'' had resumed sailing west for about 90 minutes until the ship had passed La Tortuga Island and then continued adrift to a westerly direction while the starboard main engine [[turbocharger]] was being serviced.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\nOn the night of 30 March, ''RCGS Resolute'' was contacted by the Venezuelan Coast Guard patrol boat ''Naiguat\u00e1'' at around quarter past midnight. After a brief questioning over VHF, the cruise ship was ordered to follow the Venezuelan vessel to Puerto Moreno on the basis that the Portuguese-flagged vessel was violating Venezuelan territorial waters. After consulting with the company designated person ashore (DPA), ''RCGS Resolute'' announced that the vessel would start engines and resume voyage to Cura\u00e7ao.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\nAt around 01:05 [[Time in Venezuela|local time]], ''Naiguat\u00e1'' approached ''RCGS Resolute'' from the starboard quarter and, after suddenly changing course to port, collided with the bow of the cruise ship at a relative angle of about 45 degrees between the vessels. Few minutes after the initial impact, ''RCGS Resolute''{{'}}s master ordered the port side [[controllable pitch propeller]] first to zero pitch and then to astern thrust in order to separate the two vessels. The company DPA instructed the cruise ship to remain on site and contact the local Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC). At 01:38, about half an hour after the collision, ''Naiguat\u00e1''{{'}}s [[AIS-SART]] was activated but ''RCGS Resolute'' was unable to establish contact with the sinking Venezuelan vessel over VHF and instead reached out to JRCC Cura\u00e7ao. About one hour later, the Venezuelan crew was seen preparing [[liferaft]]s for launching. At 02:43, JRCC Cura\u00e7ao relayed a statement from the Venezuelan MRCC La Guairaa that ''RCGS Resolute''{{'}}s assistance was no longer needed on site and instructed the cruise ship to proceed to Willemstad in order to avoid problems with the Venezuelan Navy.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\nAlthough the Portuguese authorities have not obtained statements from the Venezuelan Navy, the report discusses the possibility that the unexpected change in ''Naiguat\u00e1''{{'}}s heading just before the collision, as reported by ''RCGS Resolute'', may have been caused by a suction effect between the vessels as the faster patrol boat passed the cruise ship. Although the collision may have not been intentional, the conclusion was nonetheless that the incident that led to the sinking of ''Naiguat\u00e1'' was a deliberate act initiated by the Venezuelan Navy rather than an accidental occurrence.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Hapag-Lloyd Cruises}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:RCGS Resolute}}\n[[Category:Cruise ships]]\n[[Category:1991 ships]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Rauma, Finland]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 2020]]\n", "name_user": "Tupsumato", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePortuguese investigation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCGS_Resolute"}

His older brother, [[Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France|Louis Joseph]], died in June 1789, a little over a month before the start of the [[French Revolution]]. At his brother's death he became the [[heir apparent]] to the throne and the [[Dauphin of France]], a title he held until 1791, when the new constitution accorded the heir apparent the style of Prince Royal of France.\n\nWhen his father was executed on 21 January 1793, during the middle-period of the French Revolution, he became \"[[List of French monarchs|King of France]]\" in the eyes of the royalists. However, since France was by then [[First French Republic|a republic]], and Louis XVII had been imprisoned from August 1792 until his death from illness in 1795 at the age of 10, he  never actually governed. His title stems from monarchist theory, whereby [[The king is dead, long live the king!|there is always a monarch]]; on the death of one monarch, the [[heir apparent]] or failing that the [[heir presumptive]] are immediately monarch. His title was the reason why on his death his uncle took the regnal name of [[Louis XVIII of France]] rather than Louis XVII, retaining it upon the [[Bourbon Restoration]] in 1814.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Acte de bapt\u00eame de Louis Charles.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Baptismal certificate, [[Church of Notre-Dame, Versailles|Parish of Notre-Dame]]]]\nLouis-Charles de France was born at the [[Palace of Versailles]], the second son and third child of his parents, [[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie-Antoinette]].<ref name=\":1\">{{EB1911|wstitle=Louis XVII. of France|volume=17|page=45}}</ref> He was named after his father and his mother's favourite sister [[Maria Carolina of Austria|Maria Carolina, Queen of Naples and Sicily]], who was known as Charlotte in the family, Charles being the masculine version of her name. His younger sister, [[Princess Sophie Helene Beatrice of France|Sophie]], was born a little over a year later. He became the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] on the death of his elder brother, Louis-Joseph, on 4 June 1789.\n\nAs customary in royal families, Louis-Charles was cared for by multiple people. Queen Marie Antoinette appointed governesses to look after all three of her children. Louis-Charles' original governess was [[Yolande de Polastron|Yolande de Polastron, ''duchesse de Polignac'']], who left France on the night of 16\u201317 July 1789, at the outbreak of the Revolution, at the urging of Louis XVI.<ref name=\":2\">Lever, Evelyne: ''Marie-Antoinette'', Fayard, Paris, 1991, p. 480</ref> She was replaced by the [[Louise \u00c9lisabeth de Cro\u00ff|marquise Louise \u00c9lisabeth de Tourzel]]. Additionally, the queen selected [[Agathe de Rambaud]] to be the official nurse of Louis-Charles. [[Alain Decaux]] wrote: <blockquote>\"Madame de Rambaud was officially in charge of the care of the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] from the day of his birth until [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August 1792]]; in other words, for seven years. During these seven years, she never left him, she cradled him, took care of him, dressed him, comforted him, and scolded him. Many times, more than Marie Antoinette, she was a true mother for him\".<ref>Alain Decaux, ''[[Louis XVII]] retrouv\u00e9'', 1947, p. 306.{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k73447w/f65.table|title=Gallica|publisher = BNF}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome have suggested that [[Axel von Fersen the Younger|Axel von Fersen]], who was romantically linked with Marie Antoinette, was the father of her son. The fact that Louis Charles was born exactly nine months after he returned to court was noted, but this theory was debunked by most scholars, who reject it, observing that the time of his conception corresponded perfectly in the time that Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette had spent a lot of time together. Marie Antoinette, who gained massive weight because of her pregnancies, including this one (she was described as \"very fat\" by the king of Sweden), retained her charisma with an imposing figure in her court, where she had lot of admirers, but she remained a faithful, strong-willed wife and a stern but loving mother.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=180\u2013200, 305\u2013313}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nOn 6 October 1789, the royal family was forced by a [[Women's March on Versailles|Parisian mob mostly composed of women]] to move from Versailles to the [[Tuileries Palace]] in [[Paris]], where they spent the next three years as prisoners under the daily surveillance of the national guards who did not spare any humiliation to the royal family; at that time Marie Antoinette was always surrounded by guards, even in her bedroom at night and these guards were present when the Queen was allowed to see her children.\n\nThe family lived a secluded life, and Marie Antoinette dedicated most of her time to her two children under the daily surveillance of the national guards who kept her hands behind her back and searched everybody from the Queen to the children to see if any letters were smuggled to the royal prisoner.<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=350\u2013360}}</ref> On 21 June 1791, the family tried to escape in what is known as the [[Flight to Varennes]], but the attempt failed. After the family was recognized, they were brought back to Paris. When the Tuileries Palace was stormed by an armed mob on [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August 1792]], the royal family sought refuge at the Legislative Assembly.\n\nOn 13 August, the royal family was imprisoned in the tower of the [[Temple (Paris)|Temple]]. At first, their conditions were not extremely harsh, but they were prisoners and were re-styled as \"Capets\" by the newborn Republic. On 11 December, at the beginning of his trial, Louis XVI was separated from his family.\n\n===Naming===\nAt his birth, Louis-Charles, a ''[[Fils de France]]'' (\"Son of France\"), was given the title of [[Duke of Normandy]], and, on 4 June 1789, when [[Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France]], his elder brother, died, the four-year-old became [[Dauphin of France]], title he held until [[French Constitution of 1791|September 1791]], when France became a constitutional monarchy. Under the new constitution, the heir-apparent to the throne of France, formerly \"Dauphin\", was restyled ''Prince Royal''. Louis-Charles held that title until the [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|fall of the monarchy]] on 21 September 1792. At the death of his father on 21 January 1793, royalists and foreign powers intent on restoring the monarchy held him to be the new king of France, with the title of Louis XVII. From his exile in [[Hamm]], in today's [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], his uncle, the Count of Provence and future [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], who had emigrated on 21 June 1791, appointed himself [[Regent]] for the young imprisoned king.\n\n===Prison and rumours of escape===\n\n====1793: In care of Antoine Simon====\n[[File:Louis XVI au Temple, Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise - Vizille.jpg|thumb|''Louis XVI taking care of the education of his son in the [[Temple (Paris)|Temple]]'', ([[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]]).]]\nImmediately following Louis XVI's execution, plots were hatched for the escape of the prisoners from the Temple, the chief of which were engineered by the {{ill|Fran\u00e7ois Augustin Regnier de Jarjayes|lt=Chevalier de Jarjayes|fr}}, the [[Jean, Baron de Batz|Baron de Batz]], and [[Charlotte Atkyns|Lady Atkyns]]. All came to nothing.\n\nOn 3 July, Louis-Charles was separated from his mother and put in the care of [[Antoine Simon]], a [[Shoemaking|cobbler]] who had been named his guardian by the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and tasked to transform the former young prince into a staunch republican citizen.\n\nThe tales told by royalist writers of the cruelty inflicted by Simon and his wife on the child are not proven. Louis Charles' sister, Marie Therese, wrote in her memoires about the \"monster Simon\", as did Alcide Beauchesne. Antoine Simon's wife Marie-Jeanne, in fact, took great care of the child's person. Stories survive narrating how he was encouraged to eat and drink to excess and learned the language of the gutter. The foreign secretaries of Britain and Spain also heard accounts from their spies that the boy was raped by prostitutes in order to infect him with venereal diseases to supply the Commune with manufactured \"evidence\" against the Queen.<ref name=nagel /> However, the scenes related by {{ill|Alcide de Beauchesne|fr}} of the physical martyrdom of the child are not supported by any testimony, though he was at this time seen by a great number of people.\n\nOn 6 October, [[Jean-Nicolas Pache|Pache]], [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette|Chaumette]], [[Jacques H\u00e9bert]] and others visited him and secured his signature to charges of sexual molestation against his mother and his aunt.<ref name=nagel>{{cite book|last=Nagel|first=Susan|title=Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se: the fate of Marie Antoinette's daughter|year=2009|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0-7475-9666-0|pages=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ydFDp1ZasMC }}</ref> The next day he met  with his elder sister [[Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-Charlotte]] for the last time.\n\n====1794: Illness====\nOn 19 January 1794, the Simons left the Temple, after securing a receipt for the safe transfer of their ward, who was declared to be in good health. A large part of the Temple records from that time onward disappeared under the [[Bourbon Restoration]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} making knowledge of the facts impossible. Two days after the departure of the Simons, Louis-Charles is said by the Restoration historians to have been put in a dark room which was barricaded like the cage of a wild animal. The story runs that food was passed through the bars to the boy, who survived despite the accumulated filth of his surroundings.\n\n[[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] visited Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se on 11 May, but no one, according to the legend, entered the dauphin's room for six months until [[Paul Fran\u00e7ois Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Barras]] visited the prison after the 9th Thermidor (27 July 1794). Barras's account of the visit describes the child as suffering from extreme neglect, but conveys no idea of the alleged walling in. It is nevertheless certain that during the first half of 1794 Louis-Charles was very strictly secluded; he had no special guardian, but was under the charge of guards who changed from day to day.\n\nThe boy made no complaint to Barras of any ill treatment. He was then cleaned and re-clothed. His room was cleaned, and during the day he was visited by his new attendant, [[Jean Jacques Christophe Laurent]] (1770\u20131807), a creole from [[Martinique]]. From 8 November onward, Laurent had assistance from a man named Gomin.\n\n[[File:Louis Charles of France2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Louis Charles by \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun]]\nLouis-Charles was then taken out for fresh air and walks on the roof of the Tower. From about the time of Gomin's arrival, he was inspected, not by delegates of the Commune, but by representatives of the civil committee of the 48 sections of Paris. The rare recurrence of the same inspectors would obviously facilitate fraud, if any such was intended. From the end of October onward, the child maintained an obstinate silence, explained by Laurent as a determination taken on the day he made his deposition against his mother. On 19 December 1794 he was visited by three commissioners from the Committee of Public Safety&nbsp;\u2014 [[Jean-Baptiste Harmand|J. B. Harmand de la Meuse]], [[Jean-Baptiste Charles Matthieu|J. B. C. Mathieu]] and [[Jacques Reverchon|J. Reverchon]]&nbsp;\u2014 who extracted no word from him.\n\n====1795: Death====\n[[File:Jeton sur la mort de louis XVII.jpg|thumb|Louis XVII]]\nOn 31 March 1795, [[\u00c9tienne Lasne]] was appointed to be the child's guardian in replacement of Laurent. In May 1795, the boy was seriously ill, and a doctor, [[P. J. Desault]], who had visited him seven months earlier, was summoned. However, on 1 June, Desault died suddenly, not without suspicion of poison, and it was some days before doctors [[Philippe-Jean Pelletan]] and [[Dumangin]] were called.\n\nLouis-Charles died on 8 June 1795. The next day an autopsy was conducted by Pelletan, at which it was stated that a child apparently about ten years of age, \"which the commissioners told us was the late Louis Capet's son\", had died of a [[scrofulous]] infection of long standing. \"Scrofula\" as it was previously known, is nowadays called ''[[Tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis]]'' referring to a [[lymphadenitis]] (chronic lymph node swelling or infection) of the neck ([[cervical lymph nodes]]) [[lymph node]]s associated with [[tuberculosis]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/100011836|tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nDuring the autopsy, the physician Dr. Pelletan was shocked to see the countless scars which covered the body of Louis-Charles. The scars were the result of the physical abuse the child suffered while imprisoned in the Temple.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=2734184f-8894-409d-871f-1a5c0f526fa1@sessionmgr102&vid=1&hid=102|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-12-11}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nLouis-Charles was buried on 10 June in the [[Sainte Marguerite cemetery]], but no stone was erected to mark the spot. A skull was found there in 1846 and identified as his, though later re-examination in 1893 showed it to be from a teenager and therefore unlikely to be his.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Xavier de Roche, ''Louis XVII.

Thus, the heart of Louis-Charles was not interred with the rest of the body. Dr. Pelletan stored the smuggled heart in distilled wine in order to preserve it. However, after 8 to 10 years the distilled wine had evaporated, and the heart was further kept dry.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter the Restoration in 1815, Dr. Pelletan attempted to give the heart to Louis-Charles's uncle, [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]; the latter refused because he could not bring himself to believe that was the heart of his nephew. Dr. Pelletan then donated the heart to the [[Archbishop of Paris]], [[Hyacinthe-Louis de Qu\u00e9len]].\n\nFollowing the [[July Revolution|Revolution of 1830]], and the plundering of the palace, the son of Pelletan found the relic in the remnants of the palace and placed it in the crystal urn, in which it still resides today. After his death in 1879, Eduard Dumont received the heart.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1895, the nephew of the [[Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este (1817\u20131886)|Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este]], [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Don Carlos de Bourbon]], a pretender to the throne of Spain accepted the relic from a friend of Eduart Dumont, Paul Cottin. The relic was held near [[Vienna|Vienna, Austria]] at the castle of [[Frohsdorf]]. The son of Carlos, [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid]], in 1909 inherited the heart, and gave it to his sister, [[Infanta Beatriz of Spain|Beatriz]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFinally two granddaughters of Don Carlos offered the heart to the president of the Memorial of [[Basilica of St Denis|Saint-Denis]] in Paris, Duc de Bauffremont, where he put the heart and its crystal urn in the necropolis of the Kings of France, the burial place of Louis-Charles's parents and other members of the [[Capetian dynasty|French royal family]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn December 1999, public notaries witnessed a section of the heart muscle of the aorta removed from the rest of the heart, and the transfer of the samples into a sealed envelope, and then the opening of the sealed envelope in the laboratory to be tested. Scientists using DNA samples from [[Queen Anne of Romania]], and her brother Andre de Bourbon-Parme, maternal relatives of Louis XVII, and from a strand of Marie-Antoinette's hair, thus proved the young royal's identity. Historian [[Jean Tulard]] wrote: \"This [mummified] heart is ... almost certainly that of Louis XVII.

When the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|Bourbon monarchy was restored]] in 1814, some one hundred claimants came forward. Would-be royal heirs continued to appear across Europe for decades afterward and some of their descendants still have small but loyal retinues of followers today. Popular candidates for the Lost Dauphin included [[John James Audubon]], the naturalist; [[Eleazer Williams]], a missionary from [[Wisconsin]] of [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] descent; and [[Karl Wilhelm Naundorff]], a German clockmaker. However, DNA testing conducted in 1993 proved that Naundorff was not the Dauphin.<ref>Frasier, Antonia (2001), ''Marie Antoinette: The Journey''</ref>\n\n===Naundorff===\nKarl Wilhelm Naundorff's story rested on a series of complicated intrigues. According to him, [[Paul Fran\u00e7ois Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Barras]] determined to save the dauphin in order to please [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]],{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} the future empress, having conceived the idea of using the dauphin's existence as a means of dominating the [[comte de Provence]] in the event of a restoration. The dauphin was concealed in the fourth storey of the Tower, a wooden figure being substituted for him. Laurent, to protect himself from the consequences of the substitution, replaced the wooden figure with a deaf mute, who was presently exchanged for the scrofulous child of the death certificate. The deaf mute was also concealed in the Temple. It was not the dead child, but the dauphin who left the prison in the coffin, to be retrieved by friends before it reached the cemetery.\n\nNaundorff arrived in Berlin in 1810, with papers giving the name Karl Wilhelm Naundorff. He said he was escaping persecution and settled at [[Spandau]] in 1812 as a clockmaker, marrying Johanna Einert in 1818. In 1822 he removed to [[Brandenburg an der Havel]], and in 1828 to [[Krosno Odrza\u0144skie|Crossen]], near [[Frankfurt (Oder)]]. He was imprisoned from 1825 to 1828 for coining, though apparently on insufficient evidence, and in 1833 came to push his claims in Paris, where he was recognised as the dauphin by many persons formerly connected with the court of [[Louis XVI]]. Expelled from France in 1836, the day after bringing a suit against the [[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of France|duchess of Angoul\u00eame]] for the restitution of the dauphin's private property, he lived in exile until his death at [[Delft]] on 10 August 1845, and his tomb was inscribed \"Louis XVII., roi de France et de Navarre (Charles Louis, duc de Normandie)\". The Dutch authorities who had inscribed on his death certificate the name of Charles Louis de Bourbon, duc de Normandie (Louis XVII) permitted his son to bear the name de Bourbon, and when the family appealed in 1850\u201351, and again in 1874, for the restitution of their civil rights as heirs of Louis XVI, no less an advocate than [[Jules Favre]] pled their cause.\n\n===Richemont===\n[[Baron de Richemont]]'s tale that Jeanne Simon, who was genuinely attached to him, smuggled him out in a basket, is simple and more credible, and does not necessarily invalidate the story of the subsequent operations with the deaf mute and the scrofulous patient, Laurent in that case being deceived from the beginning, but it renders them extremely unlikely.\n\nRichemont, alias ''Henri \u00c9thelbert-Louis-Hector H\u00e9bert'', was in prison in [[Milan]] for seven years and began to put forward his claims in Paris in 1828. In 1833, he was again arrested, was brought to trial in the following year and condemned to twelve years' imprisonment. He escaped after a few months and left the country, to return in 1840. He died at [[Gleiz\u00e9]] on 10 August 1853, the name of Louis Charles de France being inscribed on his tomb until the government ordered its removal.\n\n===Williams===\nAnother pretender was Reverend [[Eleazer Williams|Eleazar Williams]], a [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]-born Protestant missionary, and an advocate for land rights of Native Americans. While at the house Francis Vinton, William began shaking and trembling upon seeing a portrait of [[Antoine Simon]], a member of the [[sans-culottes]], claiming the portrait has \"haunted me, day, and night, as long as I can remember.\" Simon was rumored to have physically abused the dauphin while he was imprisoned at the Temple.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e2be8aa0-37bd-46a7-9015-7d525c9588ac@sessionmgr104&vid=1&hid=102|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Francis Vinton was convinced by Eleazar William's reaction, that Williams was Louis-Charles. Williams claims he has no recollection of how he escaped his imprisonment at the Temple, or his early years in France.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nHe was a missionary to Native Americans when the [[prince de Joinville]], son of [[Louis-Philippe]], met him, and after some conversation asked him to sign a document abdicating his rights in favour of Louis-Philippe, in return for which he, the dauphin (alias Eleazar Williams), was to receive the private inheritance which was his. This Eleazar Williams refused. Williams's story is generally regarded as false.\n\n===Burial===\n[[File:LOUIS XVII.jpg|thumb|The grave supposed to be that of Louis XVII; \u00c9glise Sainte-Marguerite, Paris]]\nLouis XVII's remains were not interred with ceremony. \"At seven o'clock the police commissary ordered the body to be taken up, and that they should proceed to the cemetery. It was the season of the longest days, and therefore the interment did not take place in secrecy and at night, as some misinformed narrators have said or written; it took place in broad daylight, and attracted a great concourse of people before the gates of the Temple palace.\" Added, \"The funeral entered the cemetery of Ste. Marguerite, not by the church, as some accounts assert, but by the old gate of the cemetery. The interment was made in the corner, on the left, at a distance of eight or nine feet from the enclosure wall, and at an equal distance from a small house, which subsequently served as a school. The grave was filled up,\u2014no mound marked its place, and not even a trace remained of the interment! Not till then did the commissaries of police and the municipality withdraw, and enter the house opposite the church to draw up the declaration of interment.\"<ref>Memoirs of the Court of Marie Antoinette by Madame Campan, 1900, pg 294</ref>\n\n==Conclusion==\nStrangely, the account of the substitution in the Temple deceived royalists and republicans alike. [[Charlotte Atkyns|Lady Atkyns]] was trying by every possible means to get the dauphin out of his prison when he may already have been in safe hands. A child was in fact delivered to her agents, but he was a deaf mute. That there was a complicated fraud on the guardians of the dauphin was considered by a succession of writers from 1850 onwards, and more recently by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Barbey]], who wisely attempts no ultimate solution. When the partisans of Richemont or Naundorff come to the post-Temple careers of their heroes, they become in most cases so uncritical as to be unconvincing.\n\nBy 1900, there were over 100 pretenders who had presented themselves to be the \"lost-dauphin\". The popularity of the false-dauphins peaked in the wake of the [[July Revolution|1830 Revolution]], and waned over the course of the century. Unlike the deaths of his parents which were a national spectacle, the dauphin's death was a matter of administrative and medical record, consequently easier to repudiate.<ref name=\":5\" /> The myth of the substitution before the death of Louis-Charles was popularized and encouraged by [[Jean-Joseph Regnault-Warin|Jean-Joseph Regnault Warin]]'s immense popular novel Le Cimeti\u00e8re de la Madeleine in 1800. Pretenders increased in regularity after the accession of [[Louis XVIII of France|King Louis XVIII]] in the [[Bourbon Restoration]]. Following the Revolution of 1830 pretender claims were treated with heightened seriousness in France because of their ability to serve as critiques of the King Louis-Philippe. The premise of a Bourbon claimant challenging the legitimacy of Louis-Phillppe's legitimacy, certainly served as the reason for the aggression of which the pretenders were pursued in the courts.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nTo his mourners and his impersonators, Louis-Charles offered the opportunity of a transformative and mythical future, beyond the problems of the present. The royalists were able to reverse the child abuse claims with which the revolution charged Marie-Antoinette during her trial, directing them at the revolution itself, for harming Louis-Charles.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 2000, [[Philippe Delorme]] arranged for [[DNA testing]] of the heart as well as bone samples from [[Karl Wilhelm Naundorff]]. Ernst Brinkmann of [[M\u00fcnster University]] and Belgian genetics professor Jean-Jacques Cassiman of [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], conducted [[mitochondrial DNA]] tests in 2000 using samples from Marie-Antoinette, her sisters [[Archduchess Maria Johanna Gabriela of Austria|Maria Johanna Gabriela]] and [[Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria|Maria Josepha]], their mother, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], and two living direct descendants in strict maternal line of Maria Theresa, [[Queen Anne of Romania]] and her brother, Prince Andr\u00e9 de Bourbon Parme. The tests proved that Naundorff was not the dauphin, and the heart was that of Louis-Charles.\n\nIn 2004, the heart of Louis XVII was transferred to the Saint-Denis basilica, the traditional burial place for France's kings and queens. At the Mass, 12-year-old Prince Amaury de Bourbon-Parme carried the heart and placed it in a niche beside the tombs of Louis-Charles' parents, Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==In fiction==\n===Novel===\n* 1884 \u2013 [[Mark Twain]], ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', {{ISBN|9780486280615}}\n* 1913 \u2013 [[Baroness Emmuska Orczy]], ''[[Eldorado (novel)|Eldorado]]'', {{ISBN|9780755111121}}\n* 1937 \u2013 [[Rafael Sabatini]], ''[[The Lost King]]'', {{ISBN|9780755115440}}\n* 1951 \u2013 [[Dennis Wheatley]], ''[[The Man Who Killed The King]]'', {{ISBN|0090031903}}\n* 1953 \u2013 [[Willa Gibbs]], ''Seed of Mischief'', {{ISBN|9780110500645}}\n* 1955 \u2013 [[Carley Dawson]], ''Dragon Run''\n* 2000 \u2013 [[Deborah Cadbury]], ''The Lost King of France: A true story of revolution, revenge, and DNA'', {{ISBN|9780312283124}}\n* 2003 \u2013 [[Fran\u00e7oise Chandernagor]], ''La Chambre'', \u00e9ditions Gallimard, {{ISBN|2070314200}}\n* 2003 \u2013 [[Am\u00e9lie de Bourbon Parme]], ''Le Sacre de Louis XVII'', \u00e9ditions Folio, {{ISBN|9782070302284}}\n* 2005 \u2013 [[Ann Dukthas]], ''En M\u00e9moire d'un prince'', \u00e9ditions 10/18, Grands D\u00e9tectives, {{ISBN|2264037903}}\n* 2007 \u2013 [[Christophe Donner]], ''Un roi sans lendemain'', \u00e9ditions Grasset, {{ISBN|2246625815}}\n* 2009 \u2013 [[Dominic Lagan]], ''Live Free or Die'', {{ISBN|0956151809}}\n* 2010 \u2013 [[Jennifer Donnelly]], ''[[Revolution (novel)|Revolution]]'', {{ISBN|9780385737647}}\n* 2011 \u2013 [[Louis Bayard]], ''The Black Tower'', {{ISBN|9782266188906}}\n* 2011 \u2013 [[Jacques Soppelsa]], ''Louis XVII, la piste argentine'', Histoires, A2C M\u00e9dias, {{ISBN|9782916831169}}\n* 2011 \u2013 [[Missouri Dalton]], ''The Grave Watchers'', {{ISBN|9781610402842}}\n\n===Cinema===\n* 1937 \u2013 ''[[Le roi sans couronne]]'' played by [[Scotty Beckett]]\n* 1938 \u2013 ''[[La Marseillaise (film)|La Marseillaise]]'' played by [[Marie-Pierre Sordet-Dant\u00e8s]]\n* 1938 \u2013 ''[[Marie Antoinette (1938 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' played by [[Scotty Beckett]]\n* 1945 \u2013 ''[[Pamela (film)|Pamela]]'' played by [[Serge Emrich]]\n* 1957 \u2013 ''[[Dangerous Exile]]'' played by [[Richard O'Sullivan]]\n* 1982 \u2013 ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel (1982 film)|The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' played by Richard Charles\n* 1989 \u2013 ''[[La R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise (film)|La R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]]'' played by [[Jane Seymour (actress)#Personal life|Sean Flynn]]\n* 1991 \u2013 ''[[Killer Tomatoes Eat France]]'' played by [[Steve Lundquist]].\n* 1995 \u2013 ''[[Jefferson in Paris]]'' played by [[Damien Groelle]]\n* 2001 \u2013 ''[[The Affair of the Necklace]]'' played by [[Thomas Dodgson-Gates]]\n* 2006 \u2013 ''[[Marie Antoinette (2006 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' played by [[Jago Betts]], [[Axel K\u00fcng]], [[Driss Hugo-Kalff]]\n\n===Music===\n* 2014 \u2013 ''[[Symphony of the Vampire]]'' by [[Kamijo (musician)|Kamijo]]\n* 2018 \u2013 ''[[Sang (Kamijo song)|Sang]]'' by [[Kamijo (musician)|Kamijo]]\n\n==Exhibition==\nFrom 29 June to 1 October 2018 the [[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise|Museum of the French Revolution]] showed an exhibition on Louis XVII.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.petit-bulletin.fr/grenoble/expositions-article-61859-Heurs+et+malheurs+de+Louis+XVII++arret+sur+images+++petit+roi++grande+histoire.html|title=Heurs et malheurs de Louis XVII, arr\u00eat sur images : petit roi, grande histoire|last=|first=|date=|website=www.petit-bulletin.fr|language=fr|trans-title=Hours and misfortunes of Louis XVII, freeze frame: little king, big story|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

His older brother, [[Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France|Louis Joseph]], died in June 1789, a little over a month before the start of the [[French Revolution]]. At his brother's death he became the [[heir apparent]] to the throne and the [[Dauphin of France]], a title he held until 1791, when the new constitution accorded the heir apparent the style of Prince Royal of France.\n\nWhen his father was executed on 21 January 1793, during the middle-period of the French Revolution, he became \"[[List of French monarchs|King of France]]\" in the eyes of the royalists. However, since France was by then [[First French Republic|a republic]], and Louis XVII had been imprisoned from August 1792 until his death from illness in 1795 at the age of 10, he  never actually governed. His title stems from monarchist theory, whereby [[The king is dead, long live the king!|there is always a monarch]]; on the death of one monarch, the [[heir apparent]] or failing that the [[heir presumptive]] are immediately monarch. His title was the reason why on his death his uncle took the regnal name of [[Louis XVIII of France]] rather than Louis XVII, retaining it upon the [[Bourbon Restoration]] in 1814.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Acte de bapt\u00eame de Louis Charles.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Baptismal certificate, [[Church of Notre-Dame, Versailles|Parish of Notre-Dame]]]]\nLouis-Charles de France was born at the [[Palace of Versailles]], the second son and third child of his parents, [[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie-Antoinette]].<ref name=\":1\">{{EB1911|wstitle=Louis XVII. of France|volume=17|page=45}}</ref> He was named after his father and his mother's favourite sister [[Maria Carolina of Austria|Maria Carolina, Queen of Naples and Sicily]], who was known as Charlotte in the family, Charles being the masculine version of her name. His younger sister, [[Princess Sophie Helene Beatrice of France|Sophie]], was born a little over a year later. He became the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] on the death of his elder brother, Louis-Joseph, on 4 June 1789.\n\nAs customary in royal families, Louis-Charles was cared for by multiple people. Queen Marie Antoinette appointed governesses to look after all three of her children. Louis-Charles' original governess was [[Yolande de Polastron|Yolande de Polastron, ''duchesse de Polignac'']], who left France on the night of 16\u201317 July 1789, at the outbreak of the Revolution, at the urging of Louis XVI.<ref name=\":2\">Lever, Evelyne: ''Marie-Antoinette'', Fayard, Paris, 1991, p. 480</ref> She was replaced by the [[Louise \u00c9lisabeth de Cro\u00ff|marquise Louise \u00c9lisabeth de Tourzel]]. Additionally, the queen selected [[Agathe de Rambaud]] to be the official nurse of Louis-Charles. [[Alain Decaux]] wrote: <blockquote>\"Madame de Rambaud was officially in charge of the care of the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] from the day of his birth until [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August 1792]]; in other words, for seven years. During these seven years, she never left him, she cradled him, took care of him, dressed him, comforted him, and scolded him. Many times, more than Marie Antoinette, she was a true mother for him\".<ref>Alain Decaux, ''[[Louis XVII]] retrouv\u00e9'', 1947, p. 306.{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k73447w/f65.table|title=Gallica|publisher = BNF}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome have suggested that [[Axel von Fersen the Younger|Axel von Fersen]], who was romantically linked with Marie Antoinette, was the father of her son. The fact that Louis Charles was born exactly nine months after he returned to court was noted, but this theory was debunked by most scholars, who reject it, observing that the time of his conception corresponded perfectly in the time that Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette had spent a lot of time together. Marie Antoinette, who gained massive weight because of her pregnancies, including this one (she was described as \"very fat\" by the king of Sweden), retained her charisma with an imposing figure in her court, where she had lot of admirers, but she remained a faithful, strong-willed wife and a stern but loving mother.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=180\u2013200, 305\u2013313}}</ref>{{citation needed|date:February 2020|date=February 2020}}\n\nOn 6 October 1789, the royal family was forced by a [[Women's March on Versailles|Parisian mob mostly composed of women]] to move from Versailles to the [[Tuileries Palace]] in [[Paris]], where they spent the next three years as prisoners under the daily surveillance of the national guards who did not spare any humiliation to the royal family; at that time Marie Antoinette was always surrounded by guards, even in her bedroom at night and these guards were present when the Queen was allowed to see her children.\n\nThe family lived a secluded life, and Marie Antoinette dedicated most of her time to her two children under the daily surveillance of the national guards who kept her hands behind her back and searched everybody from the Queen to the children to see if any letters were smuggled to the royal prisoner.<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=350\u2013360}}</ref> On 21 June 1791, the family tried to escape in what is known as the [[Flight to Varennes]], but the attempt failed. After the family was recognized, they were brought back to Paris. When the Tuileries Palace was stormed by an armed mob on [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August 1792]], the royal family sought refuge at the Legislative Assembly.\n\nOn 13 August, the royal family was imprisoned in the tower of the [[Temple (Paris)|Temple]]. At first, their conditions were not extremely harsh, but they were prisoners and were re-styled as \"Capets\" by the newborn Republic. On 11 December, at the beginning of his trial, Louis XVI was separated from his family.\n\n===Naming===\nAt his birth, Louis-Charles, a ''[[Fils de France]]'' (\"Son of France\"), was given the title of [[Duke of Normandy]], and, on 4 June 1789, when [[Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France]], his elder brother, died, the four-year-old became [[Dauphin of France]], title he held until [[French Constitution of 1791|September 1791]], when France became a constitutional monarchy. Under the new constitution, the heir-apparent to the throne of France, formerly \"Dauphin\", was restyled ''Prince Royal''. Louis-Charles held that title until the [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|fall of the monarchy]] on 21 September 1792. At the death of his father on 21 January 1793, royalists and foreign powers intent on restoring the monarchy held him to be the new king of France, with the title of Louis XVII. From his exile in [[Hamm]], in today's [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], his uncle, the Count of Provence and future [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], who had emigrated on 21 June 1791, appointed himself [[Regent]] for the young imprisoned king.\n\n===Prison and rumours of escape===\n\n====1793: In care of Antoine Simon====\n[[File:Louis XVI au Temple, Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise - Vizille.jpg|thumb|''Louis XVI taking care of the education of his son in the [[Temple (Paris)|Temple]]'', ([[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]]).]]\nImmediately following Louis XVI's execution, plots were hatched for the escape of the prisoners from the Temple, the chief of which were engineered by the {{ill|Fran\u00e7ois Augustin Regnier de Jarjayes|lt=Chevalier de Jarjayes|fr}}, the [[Jean, Baron de Batz|Baron de Batz]], and [[Charlotte Atkyns|Lady Atkyns]]. All came to nothing.\n\nOn 3 July, Louis-Charles was separated from his mother and put in the care of [[Antoine Simon]], a [[Shoemaking|cobbler]] who had been named his guardian by the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and tasked to transform the former young prince into a staunch republican citizen.\n\nThe tales told by royalist writers of the cruelty inflicted by Simon and his wife on the child are not proven. Louis Charles' sister, Marie Therese, wrote in her memoires about the \"monster Simon\", as did Alcide Beauchesne. Antoine Simon's wife Marie-Jeanne, in fact, took great care of the child's person. Stories survive narrating how he was encouraged to eat and drink to excess and learned the language of the gutter. The foreign secretaries of Britain and Spain also heard accounts from their spies that the boy was raped by prostitutes in order to infect him with venereal diseases to supply the Commune with manufactured \"evidence\" against the Queen.<ref name=nagel /> However, the scenes related by {{ill|Alcide de Beauchesne|fr}} of the physical martyrdom of the child are not supported by any testimony, though he was at this time seen by a great number of people.\n\nOn 6 October, [[Jean-Nicolas Pache|Pache]], [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette|Chaumette]], [[Jacques H\u00e9bert]] and others visited him and secured his signature to charges of sexual molestation against his mother and his aunt.<ref name=nagel>{{cite book|last=Nagel|first=Susan|title=Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se: the fate of Marie Antoinette's daughter|year=2009|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0-7475-9666-0|pages=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ydFDp1ZasMC }}</ref> The next day he met  with his elder sister [[Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-Charlotte]] for the last time.\n\n====1794: Illness====\nOn 19 January 1794, the Simons left the Temple, after securing a receipt for the safe transfer of their ward, who was declared to be in good health. A large part of the Temple records from that time onward disappeared under the [[Bourbon Restoration]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} making knowledge of the facts impossible. Two days after the departure of the Simons, Louis-Charles is said by the Restoration historians to have been put in a dark room which was barricaded like the cage of a wild animal. The story runs that food was passed through the bars to the boy, who survived despite the accumulated filth of his surroundings.\n\n[[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] visited Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se on 11 May, but no one, according to the legend, entered the dauphin's room for six months until [[Paul Fran\u00e7ois Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Barras]] visited the prison after the 9th Thermidor (27 July 1794). Barras's account of the visit describes the child as suffering from extreme neglect, but conveys no idea of the alleged walling in. It is nevertheless certain that during the first half of 1794 Louis-Charles was very strictly secluded; he had no special guardian, but was under the charge of guards who changed from day to day.\n\nThe boy made no complaint to Barras of any ill treatment. He was then cleaned and re-clothed. His room was cleaned, and during the day he was visited by his new attendant, [[Jean Jacques Christophe Laurent]] (1770\u20131807), a creole from [[Martinique]]. From 8 November onward, Laurent had assistance from a man named Gomin.\n\n[[File:Louis Charles of France2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Louis Charles by \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun]]\nLouis-Charles was then taken out for fresh air and walks on the roof of the Tower. From about the time of Gomin's arrival, he was inspected, not by delegates of the Commune, but by representatives of the civil committee of the 48 sections of Paris. The rare recurrence of the same inspectors would obviously facilitate fraud, if any such was intended. From the end of October onward, the child maintained an obstinate silence, explained by Laurent as a determination taken on the day he made his deposition against his mother. On 19 December 1794 he was visited by three commissioners from the Committee of Public Safety&nbsp;\u2014 [[Jean-Baptiste Harmand|J. B. Harmand de la Meuse]], [[Jean-Baptiste Charles Matthieu|J. B. C. Mathieu]] and [[Jacques Reverchon|J. Reverchon]]&nbsp;\u2014 who extracted no word from him.\n\n====1795: Death====\n[[File:Jeton sur la mort de louis XVII.jpg|thumb|Louis XVII]]\nOn 31 March 1795, [[\u00c9tienne Lasne]] was appointed to be the child's guardian in replacement of Laurent. In May 1795, the boy was seriously ill, and a doctor, [[P. J. Desault]], who had visited him seven months earlier, was summoned. However, on 1 June, Desault died suddenly, not without suspicion of poison, and it was some days before doctors [[Philippe-Jean Pelletan]] and [[Dumangin]] were called.\n\nLouis-Charles died on 8 June 1795. The next day an autopsy was conducted by Pelletan, at which it was stated that a child apparently about ten years of age, \"which the commissioners told us was the late Louis Capet's son\", had died of a [[scrofulous]] infection of long standing. \"Scrofula\" as it was previously known, is nowadays called ''[[Tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis]]'' referring to a [[lymphadenitis]] (chronic lymph node swelling or infection) of the neck ([[cervical lymph nodes]]) [[lymph node]]s associated with [[tuberculosis]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/100011836|tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nDuring the autopsy, the physician Dr. Pelletan was shocked to see the countless scars which covered the body of Louis-Charles.

A skull was found there in 1846 and identified as his, though later re-examination in 1893 showed it to be from a teenager and therefore unlikely to be his.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Xavier de Roche, ''Louis XVII.

Thus, the heart of Louis-Charles was not interred with the rest of the body. Dr. Pelletan stored the smuggled heart in distilled wine in order to preserve it. However, after 8 to 10 years the distilled wine had evaporated, and the heart was further kept dry.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter the Restoration in 1815, Dr. Pelletan attempted to give the heart to Louis-Charles's uncle, [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]; the latter refused because he could not bring himself to believe that was the heart of his nephew. Dr. Pelletan then donated the heart to the [[Archbishop of Paris]], [[Hyacinthe-Louis de Qu\u00e9len]].\n\nFollowing the [[July Revolution|Revolution of 1830]], and the plundering of the palace, the son of Pelletan found the relic in the remnants of the palace and placed it in the crystal urn, in which it still resides today. After his death in 1879, Eduard Dumont received the heart.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1895, the nephew of the [[Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este (1817\u20131886)|Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este]], [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Don Carlos de Bourbon]], a pretender to the throne of Spain accepted the relic from a friend of Eduart Dumont, Paul Cottin. The relic was held near [[Vienna|Vienna, Austria]] at the castle of [[Frohsdorf]]. The son of Carlos, [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid]], in 1909 inherited the heart, and gave it to his sister, [[Infanta Beatriz of Spain|Beatriz]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFinally two granddaughters of Don Carlos offered the heart to the president of the Memorial of [[Basilica of St Denis|Saint-Denis]] in Paris, Duc de Bauffremont, where he put the heart and its crystal urn in the necropolis of the Kings of France, the burial place of Louis-Charles's parents and other members of the [[Capetian dynasty|French royal family]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn December 1999, public notaries witnessed a section of the heart muscle of the aorta removed from the rest of the heart, and the transfer of the samples into a sealed envelope, and then the opening of the sealed envelope in the laboratory to be tested. Scientists using DNA samples from [[Queen Anne of Romania]], and her brother Andre de Bourbon-Parme, maternal relatives of Louis XVII, and from a strand of Marie-Antoinette's hair, thus proved the young royal's identity. Historian [[Jean Tulard]] wrote: \"This [mummified] heart is ... almost certainly that of Louis XVII.

When the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|Bourbon monarchy was restored]] in 1814, some one hundred claimants came forward. Would-be royal heirs continued to appear across Europe for decades afterward and some of their descendants still have small but loyal retinues of followers today. Popular candidates for the Lost Dauphin included [[John James Audubon]], the naturalist; [[Eleazer Williams]], a missionary from [[Wisconsin]] of [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] descent; and [[Karl Wilhelm Naundorff]], a German clockmaker. However, DNA testing conducted in 1993 proved that Naundorff was not the Dauphin.<ref>Frasier, Antonia (2001), ''Marie Antoinette: The Journey''</ref>\n\n===Naundorff===\nKarl Wilhelm Naundorff's story rested on a series of complicated intrigues. According to him, [[Paul Fran\u00e7ois Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Barras]] determined to save the dauphin in order to please [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]],{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} the future empress, having conceived the idea of using the dauphin's existence as a means of dominating the [[comte de Provence]] in the event of a restoration. The dauphin was concealed in the fourth storey of the Tower, a wooden figure being substituted for him. Laurent, to protect himself from the consequences of the substitution, replaced the wooden figure with a deaf mute, who was presently exchanged for the scrofulous child of the death certificate. The deaf mute was also concealed in the Temple. It was not the dead child, but the dauphin who left the prison in the coffin, to be retrieved by friends before it reached the cemetery.\n\nNaundorff arrived in Berlin in 1810, with papers giving the name Karl Wilhelm Naundorff. He said he was escaping persecution and settled at [[Spandau]] in 1812 as a clockmaker, marrying Johanna Einert in 1818. In 1822 he removed to [[Brandenburg an der Havel]], and in 1828 to [[Krosno Odrza\u0144skie|Crossen]], near [[Frankfurt (Oder)]]. He was imprisoned from 1825 to 1828 for coining, though apparently on insufficient evidence, and in 1833 came to push his claims in Paris, where he was recognised as the dauphin by many persons formerly connected with the court of [[Louis XVI]]. Expelled from France in 1836, the day after bringing a suit against the [[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of France|duchess of Angoul\u00eame]] for the restitution of the dauphin's private property, he lived in exile until his death at [[Delft]] on 10 August 1845, and his tomb was inscribed \"Louis XVII., roi de France et de Navarre (Charles Louis, duc de Normandie)\". The Dutch authorities who had inscribed on his death certificate the name of Charles Louis de Bourbon, duc de Normandie (Louis XVII) permitted his son to bear the name de Bourbon, and when the family appealed in 1850\u201351, and again in 1874, for the restitution of their civil rights as heirs of Louis XVI, no less an advocate than [[Jules Favre]] pled their cause.\n\n===Richemont===\n[[Baron de Richemont]]'s tale that Jeanne Simon, who was genuinely attached to him, smuggled him out in a basket, is simple and more credible, and does not necessarily invalidate the story of the subsequent operations with the deaf mute and the scrofulous patient, Laurent in that case being deceived from the beginning, but it renders them extremely unlikely.\n\nRichemont, alias ''Henri \u00c9thelbert-Louis-Hector H\u00e9bert'', was in prison in [[Milan]] for seven years and began to put forward his claims in Paris in 1828. In 1833, he was again arrested, was brought to trial in the following year and condemned to twelve years' imprisonment. He escaped after a few months and left the country, to return in 1840. He died at [[Gleiz\u00e9]] on 10 August 1853, the name of Louis Charles de France being inscribed on his tomb until the government ordered its removal.\n\n===Williams===\nAnother pretender was Reverend [[Eleazer Williams|Eleazar Williams]], a [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]-born Protestant missionary, and an advocate for land rights of Native Americans. While at the house Francis Vinton, William began shaking and trembling upon seeing a portrait of [[Antoine Simon]], a member of the [[sans-culottes]], claiming the portrait has \"haunted me, day, and night, as long as I can remember.\" Simon was rumored to have physically abused the dauphin while he was imprisoned at the Temple.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e2be8aa0-37bd-46a7-9015-7d525c9588ac@sessionmgr104&vid=1&hid=102|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Francis Vinton was convinced by Eleazar William's reaction, that Williams was Louis-Charles. Williams claims he has no recollection of how he escaped his imprisonment at the Temple, or his early years in France.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nHe was a missionary to Native Americans when the [[prince de Joinville]], son of [[Louis-Philippe]], met him, and after some conversation asked him to sign a document abdicating his rights in favour of Louis-Philippe, in return for which he, the dauphin (alias Eleazar Williams), was to receive the private inheritance which was his. This Eleazar Williams refused. Williams's story is generally regarded as false.\n\n===Burial===\n[[File:LOUIS XVII.jpg|thumb|The grave supposed to be that of Louis XVII; \u00c9glise Sainte-Marguerite, Paris]]\nLouis XVII's remains were not interred with ceremony. \"At seven o'clock the police commissary ordered the body to be taken up, and that they should proceed to the cemetery. It was the season of the longest days, and therefore the interment did not take place in secrecy and at night, as some misinformed narrators have said or written; it took place in broad daylight, and attracted a great concourse of people before the gates of the Temple palace.\" Added, \"The funeral entered the cemetery of Ste. Marguerite, not by the church, as some accounts assert, but by the old gate of the cemetery. The interment was made in the corner, on the left, at a distance of eight or nine feet from the enclosure wall, and at an equal distance from a small house, which subsequently served as a school. The grave was filled up,\u2014no mound marked its place, and not even a trace remained of the interment! Not till then did the commissaries of police and the municipality withdraw, and enter the house opposite the church to draw up the declaration of interment.\"<ref>Memoirs of the Court of Marie Antoinette by Madame Campan, 1900, pg 294</ref>\n\n==Conclusion==\nStrangely, the account of the substitution in the Temple deceived royalists and republicans alike. [[Charlotte Atkyns|Lady Atkyns]] was trying by every possible means to get the dauphin out of his prison when he may already have been in safe hands. A child was in fact delivered to her agents, but he was a deaf mute. That there was a complicated fraud on the guardians of the dauphin was considered by a succession of writers from 1850 onwards, and more recently by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Barbey]], who wisely attempts no ultimate solution. When the partisans of Richemont or Naundorff come to the post-Temple careers of their heroes, they become in most cases so uncritical as to be unconvincing.\n\nBy 1900, there were over 100 pretenders who had presented themselves to be the \"lost-dauphin\". The popularity of the false-dauphins peaked in the wake of the [[July Revolution|1830 Revolution]], and waned over the course of the century. Unlike the deaths of his parents which were a national spectacle, the dauphin's death was a matter of administrative and medical record, consequently easier to repudiate.<ref name=\":5\" /> The myth of the substition before the death of Louis-Charles was popularized and encouraged by [[Jean-Joseph Regnault-Warin|Jean-Joseph Regnault Warin]]'s immense popular novel Le Cimeti\u00e8re de la Madeleine in 1800. Pretenders increased in regularity after the accession of [[Louis XVIII of France|King Louis XVIII]] in the [[Bourbon Restoration]]. Following the Revolution of 1830 pretender claims were treated with heightened seriousness in France because of their ability to serve as critiques of the King Louis-Philippe. The premise of a Bourbon claimant challenging the legitimacy of Louis-Phillppe's legitimacy, certainly served as the reason for the aggression of which the pretenders were pursued in the courts.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nTo his mourners and his impersonators, Louis-Charles offered the opportunity of a transformative and mythical future, beyond the problems of the present. The royalists were able to reverse the child abuse claims with which the revolution charged Marie-Antoinette during her trial, directing them at the revolution itself, for harming Louis-Charles.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 2000, [[Philippe Delorme]] arranged for [[DNA testing]] of the heart as well as bone samples from [[Karl Wilhelm Naundorff]]. Ernst Brinkmann of [[M\u00fcnster University]] and Belgian genetics professor Jean-Jacques Cassiman of [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], conducted [[mitochondrial DNA]] tests in 2000 using samples from Marie-Antoinette, her sisters [[Archduchess Maria Johanna Gabriela of Austria|Maria Johanna Gabriela]] and [[Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria|Maria Josepha]], their mother, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], and two living direct descendants in strict maternal line of Maria Theresa, [[Queen Anne of Romania]] and her brother, Prince Andr\u00e9 de Bourbon Parme. The tests proved that Naundorff was not the dauphin, and the heart was that of Louis-Charles.\n\nIn 2004, the heart of Louis XVII was transferred to the Saint-Denis basilica, the traditional burial place for France's kings and queens. At the Mass, 12-year-old Prince Amaury de Bourbon-Parme carried the heart and placed it in a niche beside the tombs of Louis-Charles' parents, Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==In fiction==\n===Novel===\n* 1884 \u2013 [[Mark Twain]], ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', {{ISBN|9780486280615}}\n* 1913 \u2013 [[Baroness Emmuska Orczy]], ''[[Eldorado (novel)|Eldorado]]'', {{ISBN|9780755111121}}\n* 1937 \u2013 [[Rafael Sabatini]], ''[[The Lost King]]'', {{ISBN|9780755115440}}\n* 1951 \u2013 [[Dennis Wheatley]], ''[[The Man Who Killed The King]]'', {{ISBN|0090031903}}\n* 1953 \u2013 [[Willa Gibbs]], ''Seed of Mischief'', {{ISBN|9780110500645}}\n* 1955 \u2013 [[Carley Dawson]], ''Dragon Run''\n* 2000 \u2013 [[Deborah Cadbury]], ''The Lost King of France: A true story of revolution, revenge, and DNA'', {{ISBN|9780312283124}}\n* 2003 \u2013 [[Fran\u00e7oise Chandernagor]], ''La Chambre'', \u00e9ditions Gallimard, {{ISBN|2070314200}}\n* 2003 \u2013 [[Am\u00e9lie de Bourbon Parme]], ''Le Sacre de Louis XVII'', \u00e9ditions Folio, {{ISBN|9782070302284}}\n* 2005 \u2013 [[Ann Dukthas]], ''En M\u00e9moire d'un prince'', \u00e9ditions 10/18, Grands D\u00e9tectives, {{ISBN|2264037903}}\n* 2007 \u2013 [[Christophe Donner]], ''Un roi sans lendemain'', \u00e9ditions Grasset, {{ISBN|2246625815}}\n* 2009 \u2013 [[Dominic Lagan]], ''Live Free or Die'', {{ISBN|0956151809}}\n* 2010 \u2013 [[Jennifer Donnelly]], ''[[Revolution (novel)|Revolution]]'', {{ISBN|9780385737647}}\n* 2011 \u2013 [[Louis Bayard]], ''The Black Tower'', {{ISBN|9782266188906}}\n* 2011 \u2013 [[Jacques Soppelsa]], ''Louis XVII, la piste argentine'', Histoires, A2C M\u00e9dias, {{ISBN|9782916831169}}\n* 2011 \u2013 [[Missouri Dalton]], ''The Grave Watchers'', {{ISBN|9781610402842}}\n\n===Cinema===\n* 1937 \u2013 ''[[Le roi sans couronne]]'' played by [[Scotty Beckett]]\n* 1938 \u2013 ''[[La Marseillaise (film)|La Marseillaise]]'' played by [[Marie-Pierre Sordet-Dant\u00e8s]]\n* 1938 \u2013 ''[[Marie Antoinette (1938 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' played by [[Scotty Beckett]]\n* 1945 \u2013 ''[[Pamela (film)|Pamela]]'' played by [[Serge Emrich]]\n* 1957 \u2013 ''[[Dangerous Exile]]'' played by [[Richard O'Sullivan]]\n* 1982 \u2013 ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel (1982 film)|The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' played by Richard Charles\n* 1989 \u2013 ''[[La R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise (film)|La R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]]'' played by [[Jane Seymour (actress)#Personal life|Sean Flynn]]\n* 1991 \u2013 ''[[Killer Tomatoes Eat France]]'' played by [[Steve Lundquist]].\n* 1995 \u2013 ''[[Jefferson in Paris]]'' played by [[Damien Groelle]]\n* 2001 \u2013 ''[[The Affair of the Necklace]]'' played by [[Thomas Dodgson-Gates]]\n* 2006 \u2013 ''[[Marie Antoinette (2006 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' played by [[Jago Betts]], [[Axel K\u00fcng]], [[Driss Hugo-Kalff]]\n\n===Music===\n* 2014 \u2013 ''[[Symphony of the Vampire]]'' by [[Kamijo (musician)|Kamijo]]\n* 2018 \u2013 ''[[Sang (Kamijo song)|Sang]]'' by [[Kamijo (musician)|Kamijo]]\n\n==Exhibition==\nFrom 29 June to 1 October 2018 the [[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise|Museum of the French Revolution]] showed an exhibition on Louis XVII.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.petit-bulletin.fr/grenoble/expositions-article-61859-Heurs+et+malheurs+de+Louis+XVII++arret+sur+images+++petit+roi++grande+histoire.html|title=Heurs et malheurs de Louis XVII, arr\u00eat sur images : petit roi, grande histoire|last=|first=|date=|website=www.petit-bulletin.fr|language=fr|trans-title=Hours and misfortunes of Louis XVII, freeze frame: little king, big story|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

They released five studio albums, made over twenty music videos, and became phenomenally successful across Eastern Europe, before Bard disbanded the group in 1996. Army of Lovers have later earned a widespread iconic status in the gay culture, often referred to as a perfect example of the postmodern take on the ideals of [[camp (style)|camp]]. Bard said, \u201cI'm gay. I always fall back on camp or gay as a frame of reference. Then camp doesn't always have to be gay and gay doesn't always have to be camp.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Bard also worked on the production & composition of Swedish girlgroup [[Midi, Maxi & Efti]].\n\nFollowing the demise of Army of Lovers, Bard founded [[Vacuum (band)|Vacuum]], a symphonic [[synthpop]] project featuring Bard, [[Marina Schiptjenko]] (formerly of synthpop group Page), and newcomer [[Mattias Lindblom]]. Their debut single ''I Breathe'' was one of the fastest selling singles in [[Sweden]] in 1997 and also topped the singles chart in Italy. Further releases did not do as well, except in Russia and [[Ukraine]], and Bard left after only two albums. He reformed Army of Lovers briefly in 2000 for a handful of new tracks and a greatest hits collection, and later co-wrote and co-produced the first two [[Alcazar (band)|Alcazar]] albums.\n\nIn 2005, Bard launched a new music project called [[Bodies Without Organs|BWO]] (short for Bodies Without Organs), together with Marina Schiptjenko and new vocalist [[Martin Rolinski]]. Their debut album ''Prototype'' generated seven top 20 hit singles in Scandinavia and across Eastern Europe and reached platinum status. A second album ''Halcyon Days'', was released in April 2006, which shipped gold and generated four additional hit singles. 2007 saw the release of a third album, ''Fabricator'', followed by a 2008 compilation album and the 2009 release of a fourth studio album, ''Big Science''.\n\nIn April 2010, Bard announced that he was working with co-producer [[Henrik Wikstr\u00f6m]] on a new project called [[Gravitonas]], signed to [[Universal Music]] worldwide. The project, described as electro-rock, and fronted by Bard himself and vocalist [[Andreas \u00d6hrn]], released a first digital EP in May 2010 and had its first charts hits in Sweden and Russia in the autumn of 2010. Since they refuse to release physical records tied to traditional promotional media campaigns and instead strictly release their music through streaming and downloads and in EP rather than album format, Gravitonas have been dubbed \"The World's First [[Spotify]] Band\" by bloggers and the music press. Bard's public friendship with Spotify founder [[Daniel Ek]] has played into this narrative. In addition to several No. 1 hit records across the European continent, Gravitonas have also achieved a considerable following as dance act in the U.S., with three hit records to date in the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Top 50 Club Play Chart.\n\nBesides the groups mentioned above, Alexander Bard has also worked as a songwriter and producer for several Swedish artists, in the 1980s mainly with [[Ola H\u00e5kansson]] and [[Tim Norell]], in the early 1990s with [[Anders Wollbeck]] and [[Per Adebratt]]\u2014especially on the early 1990s [[Columbia Records]]\u2014signed African cult act [[Midi Maxi & Efti]]\u2014and more recently mainly with [[Anders Hansson (songwriter)|Anders Hansson]] and Henrik Wikstr\u00f6m.\n\nBard was a co-founder of [[Stockholm Records]] and runs several internet and music-related businesses. In August 2011, Bard joined the jury of the Swedish version of the [[Idol (Sweden)|Idol TV show]], sharing the stage with [[Celine Dion]]'s record producer [[Anders Bagge]], quickly being referred to as ''The Scandinavian Simon Cowell'' due to his famously and characteristically harsh and straightforward commenting of the contestants.\n\n[[Army of Lovers]] reunited in 2013, releasing a new compilation album titled ''Big Battle of Egos'' featuring four brand new tracks including lead single and video ''Signed on My Tattoo'', a duet with [[Gravitonas]].

They released five studio albums, made over twenty music videos, and became phenomenally successful across Eastern Europe, before Bard disbanded the group in 1996. Army of Lovers have later earned a widespread iconic status in the gay culture, often referred to as a perfect example of the postmodern take on the ideals of [[camp (style)|camp]]. Bard said, \u201cI'm gay. I always fall back on camp or gay as a frame of reference. Then camp doesn't always have to be gay and gay doesn't always have to be camp.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Bard also worked on the production & composition of Swedish girlgroup [[Midi, Maxi & Efti]].\n\nFollowing the demise of Army of Lovers, Bard founded [[Vacuum (band)|Vacuum]], a symphonic [[synthpop]] project featuring Bard, [[Marina Schiptjenko]] (formerly of synthpop group Page), and newcomer [[Mattias Lindblom]]. Their debut single ''I Breathe'' was one of the fastest selling singles in [[Sweden]] in 1997 and also topped the singles chart in Italy. Further releases did not do as well, except in Russia and [[Ukraine]], and Bard left after only two albums. He reformed Army of Lovers briefly in 2000 for a handful of new tracks and a greatest hits collection, and later co-wrote and co-produced the first two [[Alcazar (band)|Alcazar]] albums.\n\nIn 2005, Bard launched a new music project called [[Bodies Without Organs|BWO]] (short for Bodies Without Organs), together with Marina Schiptjenko and new vocalist [[Martin Rolinski]]. Their debut album ''Prototype'' generated seven top 20 hit singles in Scandinavia and across Eastern Europe and reached platinum status. A second album ''Halcyon Days'', was released in April 2006, which shipped gold and generated four additional hit singles. 2007 saw the release of a third album, ''Fabricator'', followed by a 2008 compilation album and the 2009 release of a fourth studio album, ''Big Science''.\n\nIn April 2010, Bard announced that he was working with co-producer [[Henrik Wikstr\u00f6m]] on a new project called [[Gravitonas]], signed to [[Universal Music]] worldwide. The project, described as electro-rock, and fronted by Bard himself and vocalist [[Andreas \u00d6hrn]], released a first digital EP in May 2010 and had its first charts hits in Sweden and Russia in the autumn of 2010. Since they refuse to release physical records tied to traditional promotional media campaigns and instead strictly release their music through streaming and downloads and in EP rather than album format, Gravitonas have been dubbed \"The World's First [[Spotify]] Band\" by bloggers and the music press. Bard's public friendship with Spotify founder [[Daniel Ek]] has played into this narrative. In addition to several No. 1 hit records across the European continent, Gravitonas have also achieved a considerable following as dance act in the U.S., with three hit records to date in the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Top 50 Club Play Chart.\n\nBesides the groups mentioned above, Alexander Bard has also worked as a songwriter and producer for several Swedish artists, in the 1980s mainly with [[Ola H\u00e5kansson]] and [[Tim Norell]], in the early 1990s with [[Anders Wollbeck]] and [[Per Adebratt]]\u2014especially on the early 1990s [[Columbia Records]]\u2014signed African cult act [[Midi Maxi & Efti]]\u2014and more recently mainly with [[Anders Hansson (songwriter)|Anders Hansson]] and Henrik Wikstr\u00f6m.\n\nBard was a co-founder of [[Stockholm Records]] and runs several internet and music-related businesses.

This happened about 323 million years ago, at the onset of the [[Permo-Carboniferous Glaciation]].{{sfn|Stanley|1999}}\n\nThe Carboniferous was a time of active [[orogeny|mountain-building]] as the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] came together. The southern [[continent]]s remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America\u2013Europe ([[Laurussia]]) along the present line of eastern North America. This continental collision resulted in the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian orogeny]] in Europe, and the [[Alleghenian orogeny]] in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] southwestward as the [[Ouachita Mountains]].{{sfn|Stanley|1999}} In the same time frame, much of present eastern [[Eurasian plate]] welded itself to Europe along the line of the [[Ural Mountains]]. Most of the [[Mesozoic]] supercontinent of Pangea was now assembled, although North China (which would collide in the Latest Carboniferous), and [[South China (continent)|South China]] continents were still separated from [[Laurasia]]. The Late Carboniferous Pangaea was shaped like an \"O.\"\n\nThere were two major oceans in the Carboniferous\u2014[[Panthalassa]] and [[Paleo-Tethys]], which was inside the \"O\" in the Carboniferous Pangaea. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed - [[Rheic Ocean]] (closed by the assembly of [[South America|South]] and [[North America]]), the small, shallow [[Ural Ocean]] (which was closed by the collision of [[Baltica]] and Siberia continents, creating the [[Ural Mountains]]) and [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]] (closed by [[North China (continent)|North China]] collision with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]]/[[Kazakhstania]]).\n\n==Climate==\nAverage global temperatures in the Early Carboniferous Period were high: approximately 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F). However, cooling during the Middle Carboniferous reduced average global temperatures to about 12&nbsp;\u00b0C (54&nbsp;\u00b0F). Lack of growth rings of fossilized trees suggest a lack of seasons of a tropical climate. Glaciations in [[Gondwana]], triggered by Gondwana's southward movement, continued into the [[Permian]] and because of the lack of clear markers and breaks, the deposits of this glacial period are often referred to as [[Permo-Carboniferous]] in age.\n\nThe cooling and drying of the climate led to the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] (CRC) during the late Carboniferous. Tropical rainforests fragmented and then were eventually devastated by climate change.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse\"/>\n\n==Rocks and coal==\n[[File:MississippianMarbleUT.JPG|thumb|right|Lower Carboniferous marble in Big Cottonwood Canyon, [[Wasatch Mountains]], [[Utah]].]]\nCarboniferous rocks in Europe and eastern North America largely consist of a repeated sequence of [[limestone]], [[sandstone]], [[shale]] and [[coal]] beds.{{sfn|Stanley|1999|p=426}} In North America, the early Carboniferous is largely marine limestone, which accounts for the division of the Carboniferous into two periods in North American schemes. The Carboniferous coal beds provided much of the fuel for power generation during the [[Industrial Revolution]] and are still of great economic importance.\n\nThe large coal deposits of the Carboniferous may owe their existence primarily to two factors. The first of these is the appearance of [[wood]] tissue and [[bark (botany)|bark]]-bearing trees. The [[evolution]] of the wood fiber [[lignin]] and the bark-sealing, waxy substance [[suberin]] variously opposed decay organisms so effectively that dead materials accumulated long enough to fossilise on a large scale. The second factor was the lower sea levels that occurred during the Carboniferous as compared to the preceding [[Devonian]] period. This promoted the development of extensive lowland [[swamp]]s and [[forest]]s in North America and Europe. Based on a genetic analysis of mushroom fungi, it was proposed that large quantities of [[wood]] were buried during this period because animals and decomposing [[bacteria]] and fungi had not yet [[Evolution|evolved]] enzymes that could effectively digest the resistant phenolic lignin polymers and waxy suberin polymers. They suggest that fungi that could break those substances down effectively only became dominant towards the end of the period, making subsequent coal formation much rarer.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Floudas|first1=D.|last2=Binder|first2=M.|last3=Riley|first3=R.|last4=Barry|first4=K.|last5=Blanchette|first5=R.

They had bark to wood ratios of 8 to 1, and even as high as 20 to 1. This compares to modern values less than 1 to 4. This bark, which must have been used as support as well as protection, probably had 38% to 58% lignin. Lignin is insoluble, too large to pass through cell walls, too heterogeneous for specific enzymes, and toxic, so that few organisms other than [[Basidiomycetes]] fungi can degrade it. To oxidize it requires an atmosphere of greater than 5% oxygen, or compounds such as peroxides. It can linger in soil for thousands of years and its toxic breakdown products inhibit decay of other substances.{{sfn|Robinson |1990 |p=608}} One possible reason for its high percentages in plants at that time was to provide protection from insects in a world containing very effective insect herbivores (but nothing remotely as effective as modern plant eating insects) and probably many fewer protective toxins produced naturally by plants than exist today. As a result, undegraded carbon built up, resulting in the extensive burial of biologically fixed [[carbon]], leading to an increase in [[oxygen]] levels in the atmosphere; estimates place the peak oxygen content as high as 35%, as compared to 21% today.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:16907261&ctrlInfo=Round20:Mode20b:DocG:Result&ao=|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103013012/http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:16907261&ctrlInfo=Round20:Mode20b:DocG:Result&ao=|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 January 2013|title=Ancient Animals Got a Rise out of Oxygen|date=13 May 1995|website=highbeam.com|accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref> This oxygen level may have increased [[wildfire]] activity.

More diverse geology existed elsewhere, of course. Marine life is especially rich in [[crinoids]] and other [[echinodermata|echinoderms]]. [[Brachiopoda|Brachiopods]] were abundant. [[Trilobite]]s became quite uncommon. On land, large and diverse [[plant]] populations existed. Land [[vertebrata|vertebrates]] included large amphibians.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Marine invertebrates===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nIn the oceans the [[marine invertebrate]] groups are the [[Foraminifera]], [[Anthozoa|corals]], [[Bryozoa]], [[Ostracoda]], [[brachiopod]]s, [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]], [[hederellid|hederelloids]], [[microconchids]] and [[echinoderm]]s (especially [[crinoid]]s). For the first time foraminifera take a prominent part in the marine faunas. The large spindle-shaped genus ''Fusulina'' and its relatives were abundant in what is now Russia, China, Japan, North America; other important genera include ''Valvulina'', ''Endothyra'', ''Archaediscus'', and ''Saccammina'' (the latter common in Britain and Belgium). Some Carboniferous genera are still [[Extant taxon|extant]].\n\nThe microscopic shells of [[radiolaria]]ns are found in [[chert]]s of this age in the [[Culm Measures|Culm]] of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], and in Russia, Germany and elsewhere. [[Porifera|Sponges]] are known from [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s and anchor ropes, and include various forms such as the Calcispongea ''Cotyliscus'' and ''Girtycoelia'', the [[demosponge]] ''Chaetetes'', and the genus of unusual colonial [[Hyalospongea|glass sponges]] ''[[Titusvillia]]''.\n\nBoth [[reef]]-building and solitary corals diversify and flourish; these include both [[Rugosa|rugose]] (for example, ''[[Caninia (genus)|Caninia]]'', ''Corwenia'', ''Neozaphrentis''), heterocorals, and [[Tabulata|tabulate]] (for example, ''Chladochonus'', ''Michelinia'') forms. [[Conularids]] were well represented by ''Conularia''\n\n[[Bryozoa]] are abundant in some regions; the fenestellids including ''Fenestella'', ''Polypora'', and ''[[Archimedes (bryozoan)|Archimedes]]'', so named because it is in the shape of an [[Archimedean screw]]. [[Brachiopod]]s are also abundant; they include [[Productida|productids]], some of which (for example, ''[[Gigantoproductus]]'') reached very large (for brachiopods) size and had very thick shells, while others like ''[[Chonetes]]'' were more conservative in form. [[Athyridida|Athyridids]], [[Spiriferida|spiriferids]], [[Rhynchonellida|rhynchonellids]], and [[Terebratulida|terebratulids]] are also very common. Inarticulate forms include ''[[Discina (brachiopod)|Discina]]'' and ''[[Crania (genus)|Crania]]''. Some species and genera had a very wide distribution with only minor variations.\n\n[[Annelid]]s such as ''Serpulites'' are common fossils in some horizons. Among the mollusca, the [[bivalve]]s continue to increase in numbers and importance. Typical genera include ''[[Aviculopecten]]'', ''[[Posidonomya]]'', ''[[Nucula]]'', ''[[Carbonicola]]'', ''Edmondia'', and ''Modiola''. [[Gastropod]]s are also numerous, including the genera ''Murchisonia'', ''[[Euomphalus]]'', ''Naticopsis''. [[Nautiloid]] [[cephalopod]]s are represented by tightly coiled [[Nautilida|nautilids]], with straight-shelled and curved-shelled forms becoming increasingly rare. [[Goniatite]] [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]] are common.\n\n[[Trilobite]]s are rarer than in previous periods, on a steady trend towards extinction, represented only by the proetid group. [[Ostracod]]a, a class of [[crustacean]]s, were abundant as representatives of the [[meiobenthos]]; genera included ''Amphissites'', ''Bairdia'', ''Beyrichiopsis'', ''Cavellina'', ''Coryellina'', ''Cribroconcha'', ''Hollinella'', ''Kirkbya'', ''Knoxiella'', and ''Libumella''.\n\nAmongst the [[echinoderm]]s, the [[crinoid]]s were the most numerous. Dense submarine thickets of long-stemmed crinoids appear to have flourished in shallow seas, and their remains were consolidated into thick beds of rock. Prominent genera include ''Cyathocrinus'', ''Woodocrinus'', and ''Actinocrinus''. Echinoids such as ''[[Archaeocidaris]]'' and ''Palaeechinus'' were also present. The [[blastoid]]s, which included the Pentreinitidae and Codasteridae and superficially resembled crinoids in the possession of long stalks attached to the seabed, attain their maximum development at this time.\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nImage:Aviculopecten subcardiformis01.JPG|''Aviculopecten subcardiformis''; a [[bivalve]] from the [[Logan Formation]] (Lower Carboniferous) of [[Wooster, Ohio]] (external mold).\nImage:LoganFauna011312.jpg|Bivalves (''Aviculopecten'') and brachiopods (''Syringothyris'') in the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) in Wooster, Ohio.\nImage:Syringothyris01.JPG|''Syringothyris'' sp.; a spiriferid [[brachiopod]] from the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) of Wooster, Ohio (internal mold).\nImage:Palaeophycus01.JPG|''Palaeophycus'' ichnosp.; a [[trace fossil]] from the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) of Wooster, Ohio.\nImage:PlatyceratidMississippian.JPG|[[Crinoid]] calyx from the Lower Carboniferous of Ohio with a conical [[Platyceratidae|platyceratid]] gastropod (''Palaeocapulus acutirostre'') attached.\nImage:Conulariid03.jpg|Conulariid from the Lower Carboniferous of Indiana.\nImage:Syringoporid.jpg|Tabulate coral (a syringoporid); Boone Limestone (Lower Carboniferous) near Hiwasse, Arkansas.\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n===Freshwater and lagoonal invertebrates===\nFreshwater Carboniferous invertebrates include various [[bivalve]] [[mollusc]]s that lived in brackish or fresh water, such as ''[[Anthraconaia]]'', ''[[Naiadites]]'', and ''[[Carbonicola]]''; diverse [[crustacean]]s such as ''[[Candona]]'', ''[[Carbonita (genus)|Carbonita]]'', ''[[Darwinula]]'', ''[[Estheria (crustacean)|Estheria]]'', ''[[Acanthocaris]]'', ''[[Dithyrocaris]]'', and ''[[Anthrapalaemon]]''.\n\n[[File:Megarachne BW.jpg|thumb|The upper Carboniferous giant spider-like eurypterid ''[[Megarachne]]'' grew to legspans of {{convert|50|cm|0|abbr=on}}.]]\nThe [[eurypterid]]s were also diverse, and are represented by such genera as ''[[Adelophthalmus]]'', ''[[Megarachne]]'' (originally misinterpreted as a giant spider, hence its name) and the specialised very large ''[[Hibbertopterus]]''. Many of these were amphibious.\n\nFrequently a temporary return of marine conditions resulted in marine or brackish water genera such as ''[[Lingula (genus)|Lingula]]'', [[Orbiculoidea]], and ''[[Productus]]'' being found in the thin beds known as marine bands.\n\n===Terrestrial invertebrates===\nFossil remains of air-breathing [[insect]]s,{{sfn|Garwood|Sutton|2010}} [[myriapod]]s and [[arachnid]]s{{sfn| Garwood |Dunlop |Sutton |2009}} are known from the late Carboniferous, but so far not from the early Carboniferous.{{sfn| Garwood |Edgecombe |2011}} The first true [[priapulid]]s appeared during this period. Their diversity when they do appear, however, shows that these arthropods were both well developed and numerous. Their large size can be attributed to the moistness of the environment (mostly swampy fern forests) and the fact that the oxygen concentration in the Earth's atmosphere in the Carboniferous was much higher than today.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Can Oxygen Set Thermal Limits in an Insect and Drive Gigantism? |last1=Verberk |first1=Wilco C.E.P. |last2=Bilton |first2=David T. |date=July 27, 2011 |journal=PLOS One |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages = e22610|df= |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022610|pmid = 21818347|pmc=3144910 |bibcode=2011PLoSO...622610V }}</ref> This required less effort for respiration and allowed [[Arthropoda|arthropods]] to grow larger with the up to {{convert|2.6|m|ft|sp=us|adj=mid|-long}} millipede-like ''[[Arthropleura]]'' being the largest-known land invertebrate of all time.

These included some, like ''[[Psammodus]]'', with crushing pavement-like teeth adapted for grinding the shells of brachiopods, crustaceans, and other marine organisms. Other sharks had piercing teeth, such as the [[Symmoriida]]; some, the [[petalodont]]s, had peculiar cycloid cutting teeth. Most of the sharks were marine, but the [[Xenacanthida]] invaded fresh waters of the coal swamps. Among the [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], the [[Palaeonisciformes]] found in coastal waters also appear to have migrated to rivers. [[Sarcopterygii|Sarcopterygia]]n fish were also prominent, and one group, the [[Rhizodont]]s, reached very large size.\n\nMost species of Carboniferous marine fish have been described largely from teeth, fin spines and dermal ossicles, with smaller freshwater fish preserved whole.\n\nFreshwater fish were abundant, and include the genera ''[[Ctenodus]]'', ''[[Uronemus]]'', ''[[Acanthodes]]'', ''[[Cheirodus]]'', and ''[[Gyracanthus]]''.\n\n[[Shark]]s (especially the ''Stethacanthids'') underwent a major [[evolutionary radiation]] during the Carboniferous.<ref name=goldsharks/> It is believed that this evolutionary radiation occurred because the decline of the [[Placodermi|placoderms]] at the end of the Devonian period caused many [[Niche (ecology)|environmental niches]] to become unoccupied and allowed new organisms to evolve and fill these niches.<ref name=goldsharks/> As a result of the evolutionary radiation Carboniferous sharks assumed a wide variety of bizarre shapes including ''[[Stethacanthus]]'' which possessed a flat brush-like dorsal fin with a patch of [[Dermal denticle|denticles]] on its top.<ref name=goldsharks/> ''[[Stethacanthus]]''{{'s}} unusual fin may have been used in mating rituals.<ref name=goldsharks>{{cite web |url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/evolution/golden_age.htm |title=A Golden Age of Sharks |accessdate=2008-06-23 |website=Biology of Sharks and Rays {{!}} ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research |first=R.

These had long bodies, a head covered with bony plates and generally weak or undeveloped limbs. The largest were over 2 meters long. They were accompanied by an assemblage of smaller amphibians included under the [[Lepospondyli]], often only about {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} long. Some Carboniferous amphibians were aquatic and lived in rivers (''[[Loxomma]]'', ''[[Eogyrinus]]'', ''[[Proterogyrinus]]''); others may have been semi-aquatic (''[[Ophiderpeton]]'', ''[[Amphibamus]]'', ''[[Hyloplesion]]'') or terrestrial (''[[Dendrerpeton]]'', ''[[Tuditanus]]'', ''[[Anthracosaurus]]'').\n\nThe [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] slowed the evolution of amphibians who could not survive as well in the cooler, drier conditions. Reptiles, however, prospered due to specific key adaptations.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse\"/> One of the greatest evolutionary innovations of the Carboniferous was the [[amniote]] egg, which allowed the laying of eggs in a dry environment, allowing for the further exploitation of the land by certain [[tetrapod]]s. These included the earliest [[Sauropsida|sauropsid]] reptiles (''[[Hylonomus]]''), and the earliest known [[synapsid]] (''[[Archaeothyris]]''). These small lizard-like animals quickly gave rise to many descendants, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s.\n\nReptiles underwent a major evolutionary radiation in response to the drier climate that preceded the rainforest collapse.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse\"/><ref name=Kazlev>{{cite web |first=M.

This happened about 323 million years ago, at the onset of the [[Permo-Carboniferous Glaciation]].{{sfn|Stanley|1999}}\n\nThe Carboniferous was a time of active [[orogeny|mountain-building]] as the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] came together. The southern [[continent]]s remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America\u2013Europe ([[Laurussia]]) along the present line of eastern North America. This continental collision resulted in the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian orogeny]] in Europe, and the [[Alleghenian orogeny]] in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] southwestward as the [[Ouachita Mountains]].{{sfn|Stanley|1999}} In the same time frame, much of present eastern [[Eurasian plate]] welded itself to Europe along the line of the [[Ural Mountains]]. Most of the [[Mesozoic]] supercontinent of Pangea was now assembled, although North China (which would collide in the Latest Carboniferous), and [[South China (continent)|South China]] continents were still separated from [[Laurasia]]. The Late Carboniferous Pangaea was shaped like an \"O.\"\n\nThere were two major oceans in the Carboniferous\u2014[[Panthalassa]] and [[Paleo-Tethys]], which was inside the \"O\" in the Carboniferous Pangaea. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed - [[Rheic Ocean]] (closed by the assembly of [[South America|South]] and [[North America]]), the small, shallow [[Ural Ocean]] (which was closed by the collision of [[Baltica]] and Siberia continents, creating the [[Ural Mountains]]) and [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]] (closed by [[North China (continent)|North China]] collision with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]]/[[Kazakhstania]]).\n\n==Climate==\nAverage global temperatures in the Early Carboniferous Period were high: approximately 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F). However, cooling during the Middle Carboniferous reduced average global temperatures to about 12&nbsp;\u00b0C (54&nbsp;\u00b0F). Lack of growth rings of fossilized trees suggest a lack of seasons of a tropical climate. Glaciations in [[Gondwana]], triggered by Gondwana's southward movement, continued into the [[Permian]] and because of the lack of clear markers and breaks, the deposits of this glacial period are often referred to as [[Permo-Carboniferous]] in age.\n\nThe cooling and drying of the climate led to the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] (CRC) during the late Carboniferous. Tropical rainforests fragmented and then were eventually devastated by climate change.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse\"/>\n\n==Rocks and coal==\n[[File:MississippianMarbleUT.JPG|thumb|right|Lower Carboniferous marble in Big Cottonwood Canyon, [[Wasatch Mountains]], [[Utah]].]]\nCarboniferous rocks in Europe and eastern North America largely consist of a repeated sequence of [[limestone]], [[sandstone]], [[shale]] and [[coal]] beds.{{sfn|Stanley|1999|p=426}} In North America, the early Carboniferous is largely marine limestone, which accounts for the division of the Carboniferous into two periods in North American schemes. The Carboniferous coal beds provided much of the fuel for power generation during the [[Industrial Revolution]] and are still of great economic importance.\n\nThe large coal deposits of the Carboniferous may owe their existence primarily to two factors. The first of these is the appearance of [[wood]] tissue and [[bark (botany)|bark]]-bearing trees. The [[evolution]] of the wood fiber [[lignin]] and the bark-sealing, waxy substance [[suberin]] variously opposed decay organisms so effectively that dead materials accumulated long enough to fossilise on a large scale. The second factor was the lower sea levels that occurred during the Carboniferous as compared to the preceding [[Devonian]] period. This promoted the development of extensive lowland [[swamp]]s and [[forest]]s in North America and Europe. Based on a genetic analysis of mushroom fungi, it was proposed that large quantities of [[wood]] were buried during this period because animals and decomposing [[bacteria]] and fungi had not yet [[Evolution|evolved]] enzymes that could effectively digest the resistant phenolic lignin polymers and waxy suberin polymers. They suggest that fungi that could break those substances down effectively only became dominant towards the end of the period, making subsequent coal formation much rarer.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Floudas|first1=D.|last2=Binder|first2=M.|last3=Riley|first3=R.|last4=Barry|first4=K.|last5=Blanchette|first5=R.

They had bark to wood ratios of 8 to 1, and even as high as 20 to 1. This compares to modern values less than 1 to 4. This bark, which must have been used as support as well as protection, probably had 38% to 58% lignin. Lignin is insoluble, too large to pass through cell walls, too heterogeneous for specific enzymes, and toxic, so that few organisms other than [[Basidiomycetes]] fungi can degrade it. To oxidize it requires an atmosphere of greater than 5% oxygen, or compounds such as peroxides. It can linger in soil for thousands of years and its toxic breakdown products inhibit decay of other substances.{{sfn|Robinson |1990 |p=608}} One possible reason for its high percentages in plants at that time was to provide protection from insects in a world containing very effective insect herbivores (but nothing remotely as effective as modern plant eating insects) and probably many fewer protective toxins produced naturally by plants than exist today. As a result, undegraded carbon built up, resulting in the extensive burial of biologically fixed [[carbon]], leading to an increase in [[oxygen]] levels in the atmosphere; estimates place the peak oxygen content as high as 35%, as compared to 21% today.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:16907261&ctrlInfo=Round20:Mode20b:DocG:Result&ao=|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103013012/http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:16907261&ctrlInfo=Round20:Mode20b:DocG:Result&ao=|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 January 2013|title=Ancient Animals Got a Rise out of Oxygen|date=13 May 1995|website=highbeam.com|accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref> This oxygen level may have increased [[wildfire]] activity.

Unlike present-day trees, their [[secondary growth]] took place in the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]], which also provided stability, instead of the [[xylem]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-muenster.de/GeoPalaeontologie/Palaeo/Palbot/ewald1.htm |title=A History of Palaeozoic Forests - Part 2 The Carboniferous coal swamp forests |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920012606/http://www.uni-muenster.de/GeoPalaeontologie/Palaeo/Palbot/ewald1.htm |website=Forschungsstelle f\u00fcr Pal\u00e4obotanik |publisher=Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster |archive-date=2012-09-20 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Cladoxylopsida|Cladoxylopsids]] were large trees, that were ancestors of ferns, first arising in the Carboniferous.<ref>{{cite web |first=C.

Probably many species were [[epiphytic]]. Fossil ferns and \"seed ferns\" include ''[[Pecopteris]]'', ''[[Cyclopteris]]'', ''[[Neuropteris]]'', ''[[Alethopteris]]'', and ''[[Sphenopteris]]''; ''[[Megaphyton]]'' and ''[[Caulopteris]]'' were tree ferns.\n\nThe Equisetales included the common giant form ''[[Calamites]]'', with a trunk diameter of 30 to {{convert|60|cm|0|abbr=on}} and a height of up to {{convert|20|m|0|abbr=on}}. ''[[Sphenophyllum]]'' was a slender climbing plant with whorls of leaves, which was probably related both to the calamites and the lycopods.\n\n''[[Cordaites]]'', a tall plant (6 to over 30 meters) with strap-like leaves, was related to the cycads and conifers; the [[catkin]]-like reproductive organs, which bore ovules/seeds, is called ''[[Cardiocarpus]]''. These plants were thought to live in swamps. True coniferous trees (''[[Walchia]]'', of the order Voltziales) appear later in the Carboniferous, and preferred higher drier ground.\n\n===Marine invertebrates===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nIn the oceans the [[marine invertebrate]] groups are the [[Foraminifera]], [[Anthozoa|corals]], [[Bryozoa]], [[Ostracoda]], [[brachiopod]]s, [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]], [[hederellid|hederelloids]], [[microconchids]] and [[echinoderm]]s (especially [[crinoid]]s). For the first time foraminifera take a prominent part in the marine faunas. The large spindle-shaped genus ''Fusulina'' and its relatives were abundant in what is now Russia, China, Japan, North America; other important genera include ''Valvulina'', ''Endothyra'', ''Archaediscus'', and ''Saccammina'' (the latter common in Britain and Belgium). Some Carboniferous genera are still [[Extant taxon|extant]].\n\nThe microscopic shells of [[radiolaria]]ns are found in [[chert]]s of this age in the [[Culm Measures|Culm]] of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], and in Russia, Germany and elsewhere. [[Porifera|Sponges]] are known from [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s and anchor ropes, and include various forms such as the Calcispongea ''Cotyliscus'' and ''Girtycoelia'', the [[demosponge]] ''Chaetetes'', and the genus of unusual colonial [[Hyalospongea|glass sponges]] ''[[Titusvillia]]''.\n\nBoth [[reef]]-building and solitary corals diversify and flourish; these include both [[Rugosa|rugose]] (for example, ''[[Caninia (genus)|Caninia]]'', ''Corwenia'', ''Neozaphrentis''), heterocorals, and [[Tabulata|tabulate]] (for example, ''Chladochonus'', ''Michelinia'') forms. [[Conularids]] were well represented by ''Conularia''\n\n[[Bryozoa]] are abundant in some regions; the fenestellids including ''Fenestella'', ''Polypora'', and ''[[Archimedes (bryozoan)|Archimedes]]'', so named because it is in the shape of an [[Archimedean screw]]. [[Brachiopod]]s are also abundant; they include [[Productida|productids]], some of which (for example, ''[[Gigantoproductus]]'') reached very large (for brachiopods) size and had very thick shells, while others like ''[[Chonetes]]'' were more conservative in form. [[Athyridida|Athyridids]], [[Spiriferida|spiriferids]], [[Rhynchonellida|rhynchonellids]], and [[Terebratulida|terebratulids]] are also very common. Inarticulate forms include ''[[Discina (brachiopod)|Discina]]'' and ''[[Crania (genus)|Crania]]''. Some species and genera had a very wide distribution with only minor variations.\n\n[[Annelid]]s such as ''Serpulites'' are common fossils in some horizons. Among the mollusca, the [[bivalve]]s continue to increase in numbers and importance. Typical genera include ''[[Aviculopecten]]'', ''[[Posidonomya]]'', ''[[Nucula]]'', ''[[Carbonicola]]'', ''Edmondia'', and ''Modiola''. [[Gastropod]]s are also numerous, including the genera ''Murchisonia'', ''[[Euomphalus]]'', ''Naticopsis''. [[Nautiloid]] [[cephalopod]]s are represented by tightly coiled [[Nautilida|nautilids]], with straight-shelled and curved-shelled forms becoming increasingly rare. [[Goniatite]] [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]] are common.\n\n[[Trilobite]]s are rarer than in previous periods, on a steady trend towards extinction, represented only by the proetid group. [[Ostracod]]a, a class of [[crustacean]]s, were abundant as representatives of the [[meiobenthos]]; genera included ''Amphissites'', ''Bairdia'', ''Beyrichiopsis'', ''Cavellina'', ''Coryellina'', ''Cribroconcha'', ''Hollinella'', ''Kirkbya'', ''Knoxiella'', and ''Libumella''.\n\nAmongst the [[echinoderm]]s, the [[crinoid]]s were the most numerous. Dense submarine thickets of long-stemmed crinoids appear to have flourished in shallow seas, and their remains were consolidated into thick beds of rock. Prominent genera include ''Cyathocrinus'', ''Woodocrinus'', and ''Actinocrinus''. Echinoids such as ''[[Archaeocidaris]]'' and ''Palaeechinus'' were also present. The [[blastoid]]s, which included the Pentreinitidae and Codasteridae and superficially resembled crinoids in the possession of long stalks attached to the seabed, attain their maximum development at this time.\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nImage:Aviculopecten subcardiformis01.JPG|''Aviculopecten subcardiformis''; a [[bivalve]] from the [[Logan Formation]] (Lower Carboniferous) of [[Wooster, Ohio]] (external mold).\nImage:LoganFauna011312.jpg|Bivalves (''Aviculopecten'') and brachiopods (''Syringothyris'') in the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) in Wooster, Ohio.\nImage:Syringothyris01.JPG|''Syringothyris'' sp.; a spiriferid [[brachiopod]] from the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) of Wooster, Ohio (internal mold).\nImage:Palaeophycus01.JPG|''Palaeophycus'' ichnosp.; a [[trace fossil]] from the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) of Wooster, Ohio.\nImage:PlatyceratidMississippian.JPG|[[Crinoid]] calyx from the Lower Carboniferous of Ohio with a conical [[Platyceratidae|platyceratid]] gastropod (''Palaeocapulus acutirostre'') attached.\nImage:Conulariid03.jpg|Conulariid from the Lower Carboniferous of Indiana.\nImage:Syringoporid.jpg|Tabulate coral (a syringoporid); Boone Limestone (Lower Carboniferous) near Hiwasse, Arkansas.\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n===Freshwater and lagoonal invertebrates===\nFreshwater Carboniferous invertebrates include various [[bivalve]] [[mollusc]]s that lived in brackish or fresh water, such as ''[[Anthraconaia]]'', ''[[Naiadites]]'', and ''[[Carbonicola]]''; diverse [[crustacean]]s such as ''[[Candona]]'', ''[[Carbonita (genus)|Carbonita]]'', ''[[Darwinula]]'', ''[[Estheria (crustacean)|Estheria]]'', ''[[Acanthocaris]]'', ''[[Dithyrocaris]]'', and ''[[Anthrapalaemon]]''.\n\n[[File:Megarachne BW.jpg|thumb|The upper Carboniferous giant spider-like eurypterid ''[[Megarachne]]'' grew to legspans of {{convert|50|cm|0|abbr=on}}.]]\nThe [[eurypterid]]s were also diverse, and are represented by such genera as ''[[Adelophthalmus]]'', ''[[Megarachne]]'' (originally misinterpreted as a giant spider, hence its name) and the specialised very large ''[[Hibbertopterus]]''. Many of these were amphibious.\n\nFrequently a temporary return of marine conditions resulted in marine or brackish water genera such as ''[[Lingula (genus)|Lingula]]'', [[Orbiculoidea]], and ''[[Productus]]'' being found in the thin beds known as marine bands.\n\n===Terrestrial invertebrates===\nFossil remains of air-breathing [[insect]]s,{{sfn|Garwood|Sutton|2010}} [[myriapod]]s and [[arachnid]]s{{sfn| Garwood |Dunlop |Sutton |2009}} are known from the late Carboniferous, but so far not from the early Carboniferous.{{sfn| Garwood |Edgecombe |2011}} The first true [[priapulid]]s appeared during this period. Their diversity when they do appear, however, shows that these arthropods were both well developed and numerous. Their large size can be attributed to the moistness of the environment (mostly swampy fern forests) and the fact that the oxygen concentration in the Earth's atmosphere in the Carboniferous was much higher than today.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Can Oxygen Set Thermal Limits in an Insect and Drive Gigantism? |last1=Verberk |first1=Wilco C.E.P. |last2=Bilton |first2=David T. |date=July 27, 2011 |journal=PLOS One |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages = e22610|df= |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022610|pmid = 21818347|pmc=3144910 |bibcode=2011PLoSO...622610V }}</ref> This required less effort for respiration and allowed [[Arthropoda|arthropods]] to grow larger with the up to {{convert|2.6|m|ft|sp=us|adj=mid|-long}} millipede-like ''[[Arthropleura]]'' being the largest-known land invertebrate of all time.

Some British coalfields have yielded good specimens: ''[[Archaeoptitus]]'', from the Derbyshire coalfield, had a spread of wing extending to more than {{convert|35|cm|0|abbr=on}}; some specimens (''[[Brodia]]'') still exhibit traces of brilliant wing colors.

These included some, like ''[[Psammodus]]'', with crushing pavement-like teeth adapted for grinding the shells of brachiopods, crustaceans, and other marine organisms. Other sharks had piercing teeth, such as the [[Symmoriida]]; some, the [[petalodont]]s, had peculiar cycloid cutting teeth. Most of the sharks were marine, but the [[Xenacanthida]] invaded fresh waters of the coal swamps. Among the [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], the [[Palaeonisciformes]] found in coastal waters also appear to have migrated to rivers. [[Sarcopterygii|Sarcopterygia]]n fish were also prominent, and one group, the [[Rhizodont]]s, reached very large size.\n\nMost species of Carboniferous marine fish have been described largely from teeth, fin spines and dermal ossicles, with smaller freshwater fish preserved whole.\n\nFreshwater fish were abundant, and include the genera ''[[Ctenodus]]'', ''[[Uronemus]]'', ''[[Acanthodes]]'', ''[[Cheirodus]]'', and ''[[Gyracanthus]]''.\n\n[[Shark]]s (especially the ''Stethacanthids'') underwent a major [[evolutionary radiation]] during the Carboniferous.<ref name=goldsharks/> It is believed that this evolutionary radiation occurred because the decline of the [[Placodermi|placoderms]] at the end of the Devonian period caused many [[Niche (ecology)|environmental niches]] to become unoccupied and allowed new organisms to evolve and fill these niches.<ref name=goldsharks/> As a result of the evolutionary radiation Carboniferous sharks assumed a wide variety of bizarre shapes including ''[[Stethacanthus]]'' which possessed a flat brush-like dorsal fin with a patch of [[Dermal denticle|denticles]] on its top.<ref name=goldsharks/> ''[[Stethacanthus]]''{{'s}} unusual fin may have been used in mating rituals.<ref name=goldsharks>{{cite web |url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/evolution/golden_age.htm |title=A Golden Age of Sharks |accessdate=2008-06-23 |website=Biology of Sharks and Rays {{!}} ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research |first=R.

These had long bodies, a head covered with bony plates and generally weak or undeveloped limbs. The largest were over 2 meters long. They were accompanied by an assemblage of smaller amphibians included under the [[Lepospondyli]], often only about {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} long. Some Carboniferous amphibians were aquatic and lived in rivers (''[[Loxomma]]'', ''[[Eogyrinus]]'', ''[[Proterogyrinus]]''); others may have been semi-aquatic (''[[Ophiderpeton]]'', ''[[Amphibamus]]'', ''[[Hyloplesion]]'') or terrestrial (''[[Dendrerpeton]]'', ''[[Tuditanus]]'', ''[[Anthracosaurus]]'').\n\nThe [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] slowed the evolution of amphibians who could not survive as well in the cooler, drier conditions. Reptiles, however, prospered due to specific key adaptations.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse\"/> One of the greatest evolutionary innovations of the Carboniferous was the [[amniote]] egg, which allowed the laying of eggs in a dry environment, allowing for the further exploitation of the land by certain [[tetrapod]]s. These included the earliest [[Sauropsida|sauropsid]] reptiles (''[[Hylonomus]]''), and the earliest known [[synapsid]] (''[[Archaeothyris]]''). These small lizard-like animals quickly gave rise to many descendants, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s.\n\nReptiles underwent a major evolutionary radiation in response to the drier climate that preceded the rainforest collapse.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse\"/><ref name=Kazlev>{{cite web |first=M.

His grandfather was a poor scholar from [[County Tyrone]] and made his way down to Tara to take part in the [[1798 Rising]].<ref name=mc>http://www.meathchronicle.ie/news/1916centenary/articles/2016/05/06/4119365-the-1916-series-kilskyre-remembers-brian-ohiggins/</ref> He was educated at the Kilskyre National School for ten years from 1886 before becoming a draper's apprentice at nearby Clonmellon. He was also in this period he began to contribute articles for local newspapers and publish poetry in the [[Meath Chronicle]]. He moved to Dublin in 1901 as a teenager to work as a barman and during his time there he joined the O'Growney Branch of the [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] and Saint Finians Hurling Club.<ref name=nhs>http://www.navanhistory.ie/index.php?page=brian-o-higgins</ref> His health declined in 1903 and he returned to live in his native Meath. It was during his recuperation at home that he co-founded the local hurling club, whose grounds were later named in his memory (P\u00e1irc U\u00ed hUig\u00edn).\n\nO'Higgins was present at the first annual convention of the National Council of Sinn F\u00e9in on 28 November 1905, and wrote its first party anthem entitled 'Sinn F\u00e9in Amh\u00e1in'. The song was sung at all gatherings of the organisation for a number of years.\n\nAfter attending an Irish-language summer college at Ballingeary, Co. Cork, O'Higgins received a language teacher's certificate in 1906 and began work as a m\u00fainteoir taistil (travelling teacher) for the Gaelic League. During this time he founded Col\u00e1iste U\u00ed Chomhraidhe, an Irish language college in Carrigaholt, [[County Clare]].<ref>http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/songs/cmc/a_stor_mo_chroi_oconway.htm</ref> He became a good friend of [[Patrick Pearse|P\u00e1draig Pearse]], after they first met in 1906.\n\nBrian na Banban first published his poetry in book form in 1907 as The Voice of Banba: Songs and Recitations for Young Ireland. Some of O'Higgins' work is anodyne and sentimental stuff, as per his Christmas Stories and Sketches (1917), Hearts of Gold (1918) and Songs of the Sacred Heart (1921). These works were commended by the [[Bishop of Killaloe]], the Sinn F\u00e9in-supporting Michael Fogarty, as being 'full of simple and profound religious feeling'.\n\nO'Higgins' poem \"[[:wikisource:Who is Ireland's Enemy?|Who is Ireland's Enemy?]]\", was first published in September 1914 in  ''[[Irish Freedom]]'', in an edition entitled ''Germany Is Not Ireland's Enemy''; it became popular during the [[1918 Irish conscription crisis]]. According to Christopher M. Kennedy,  the poem was \"perhaps the most blatant example of using past wrongs committed by England to keep the old hatreds alive\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Genesis of the Rising, 1912\u20131916: A Transformation of Nationalist Opinion|last=Kennedy|first=Christopher M.|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=1433105004|ref=harv|p=99}}</ref>\n\n==Republican activity==\n\nO'Higgins was a founding member of the [[Irish Volunteers]] in 1913, which organised to work for Irish independence. On Easter Monday of 1916 he was in a group of Volunteers who were held at 41 Parnell Square as reserves, on account of their age, health or physical condition.

His grandfather was a poor scholar from [[County Tyrone]] and made his way down to Tara to take part in the [[1798 Rising]].<ref name=mc>http://www.meathchronicle.ie/news/1916centenary/articles/2016/05/06/4119365-the-1916-series-kilskyre-remembers-brian-ohiggins/</ref> He was educated at the Kilskyre National School for ten years from 1886 before becoming a draper's apprentice at nearby Clonmellon. He was also in this period he began to contribute articles for local newspapers and publish poetry in the [[Meath Chronicle]]. He moved to Dublin in 1901 as a teenager to work as a barman and during his time there he joined the O'Growney Branch of the [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] and Saint Finians Hurling Club.<ref name=nhs>http://www.navanhistory.ie/index.php?page=brian-o-higgins</ref> His health declined in 1903 and he returned to live in his native Meath. It was during his recuperation at home that he co-founded the local hurling club, whose grounds were later named in his memory (P\u00e1irc U\u00ed hUig\u00edn).\n\nO'Higgins was present at the first annual convention of the National Council of Sinn F\u00e9in on 28 November 1905, and wrote its first party anthem entitled 'Sinn F\u00e9in Amh\u00e1in'. The song was sung at all gatherings of the organisation for a number of years.\n\nAfter attending an Irish-language summer college at Ballingeary, Co. Cork, O'Higgins received a language teacher's certificate in 1906 and began work as a m\u00fainteoir taistil (travelling teacher) for the Gaelic League. During this time he founded Col\u00e1iste U\u00ed Chomhraidhe, an Irish language college in Carrigaholt, [[County Clare]].<ref>http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/songs/cmc/a_stor_mo_chroi_oconway.htm</ref> He became a good friend of [[Patrick Pearse|P\u00e1draig Pearse]], after they first met in 1906.\n\nBrian na Banban first published his poetry in book form in 1907 as The Voice of Banba: Songs and Recitations for Young Ireland. Some of O'Higgins' work is anodyne and sentimental stuff, as per his Christmas Stories and Sketches (1917), Hearts of Gold (1918) and Songs of the Sacred Heart (1921). These works were commended by the [[Bishop of Killaloe]], the Sinn F\u00e9in-supporting Michael Fogarty, as being 'full of simple and profound religious feeling'.\n\nO'Higgins' poem \"[[:wikisource:Who is Ireland's Enemy?|Who is Ireland's Enemy?]]\", was first published in September 1914 in  ''[[Irish Freedom]]'', in an edition entitled ''Germany Is Not Ireland's Enemy''; it became popular during the [[1918 Irish conscription crisis]]. According to Christopher M. Kennedy,  the poem was \"perhaps the most blatant example of using past wrongs committed by England to keep the old hatreds alive\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Genesis of the Rising, 1912\u20131916: A Transformation of Nationalist Opinion|last=Kennedy|first=Christopher M.|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=1433105004|ref=harv|p=99}}</ref>\n\n==Republican activity==\n\nO'Higgins was a founding member of the [[Irish Volunteers]] in 1913, which organised to work for Irish independence.

The band played [[Noise music|noise]]/[[Grindcore|grind]], and sometimes touching on themes of gender [[Pornogrind]] gradually evolved into more serious [[Goregrind]]. At this time Luk\u00e1\u0161 \"Stezi\" Stejskal - bass joined the band but later came out and in 2000 David \"Sabon\" Snehota - under it replaced. In 2001 Stezi returned and the band recorded their first album \"Preparation of Patients for the Examination\" which was edited by Khaaranus Production. In 2002 the band recorded their MD ''\"Daddy's Steak\"'' and split 7 \"EP with the German band Ulcerrhoea. Then Stezi definitely left the band. In 2006 Carnal Diafragma recorded her second album ''\"Space Symphony Around U\"'' which was edited by Lecter Music Agency and soon became known worldwide mainly thanks to video ''\"Teletrambus\"''. Then Kame\u0148 left the band for personal problems and was replaced by Ond\u0159ej \"Prune\" Pode\u0161va. In 2009 David and Pode left the band and their replacements were Libor \"Porky\" Philipp - drums with brother David Martin \"Sabon\" Snehota - bass. The band recorded their third album ''\"Planet of Children's Heads\"'', Martin left the band and returned David. In 2015 Milan left the band and Kino (BBYB, ex-Cerebral Turbulency) joined the band. That year split CD with Mexican band Fecalizer was released and in February 2017 fourth album called \"Grind Restaurant pana Septika\" was released by Czech label Bizarre Leprous Prod.

The band played [[Noise music|noise]]/[[Grindcore|grind]], and sometimes touching on themes of gender [[Pornogrind]] gradually evolved into more serious [[Goregrind]]. At this time Luk\u00e1\u0161 \"Stezi\" Stejskal - bass joined the band but later came out and in 2000 David \"Sabon\" Snehota - under it replaced. In 2001 Stezi returned and the band recorded their first album \"Preparation of Patients for the Examination\" which was edited by Khaaranus Production. In 2002 the band recorded their MD ''\"Daddy's Steak\"'' and split 7 \"EP with the German band Ulcerrhoea. Then Stezi definitely left the band. In 2006 Carnal Diafragma recorded her second album ''\"Space Symphony Around U\"'' which was edited by Lecter Music Agency and soon became known worldwide mainly thanks to video ''\"Teletrambus\"''. Then Kame\u0148 left the band for personal problems and was replaced by Ond\u0159ej \"Prune\" Pode\u0161va. In 2009 David and Pode left the band and their replacements were Libor \"Porky\" Philipp - drums with brother David Martin \"Sabon\" Snehota - bass. The band recorded their third album ''\"Planet of Children's Heads\"'', Martin left the band and returned David. In 2015 Milan left the band and Kino (BBYB, ex-Cerebral Turbulency) joined the band. That year split CD with Mexican band Fecalizer was released and in February 2017 fourth album called \"Grind Restaurant pana Septika\" was released by Czech label Bizarre Leprous Prod. In June 2017 Libor left the band and Lukas Jelinek (Felisha, ex-Spasm) became a new drummer. Carnal Diafragma has participated in many compilations and split CDs and tapes with various bands.

Its style merges [[Punk rock|punk]], [[soul music|soul]], [[klezmer]] and [[jazz]], while its [[Musical collective|collective]] membership features [[horn section|horns]], [[piano]] and guitar and has a membership of about 40 players, of whom only about seven to ten active members usually perform at a time. The group is led by singer Jack Terricloth, who has been the only constant during the group's history. Terricloth is known for his pointed commentary during shows; his monologues have touched on politics and his transformation from the \"old school\".\n\nIts lyrics often concern historical or biographical subjects, such as [[Weimar Republic|Weimar-era]] [[Germany]], [[Peter Lorre]], [[Jeffrey Lee Pierce]] of [[The Gun Club]], [[Paul Robeson]], [[Leni Riefenstahl]], [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Philip K. Dick]], and [[Jonathan Fire*Eater]].\n\n=={{anchor|Currently active members|Alumni}}Hallowmas==\nThe World/Inferno Friendship Society's annual [[Halloween]] show, Hallowmas, is its most-anticipated performance of the year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} The event is known for its elaborate planning and surprises. Past Hallowmases have included a burning effigy of Mr. Terricloth constructed and set alight by a large, caustic cat; an [[Anti-Social Music|ethereal string quartet]] performing throughout the evening in the rear of the hall; circus performances and [[fire breathing]] by the Odd Child Uprising troupe and a cadaverous marching band materializing on stage for the finale, \"Pumpkin Time\". The song (performed only at Hallowmas shows) includes street rallies, and references [[The Great Pumpkin]] from the ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip.\n\nWhile the band has had over 40 members come and go, Terricloth has maintained that they have always been more of a gang than an actual band. Many members continue to collaborate with the group, but do not join them on tour. {{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Members==\n===Current Members===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name !!

Its style merges [[Punk rock|punk]], [[soul music|soul]], [[klezmer]] and [[jazz]], while its [[Musical collective|collective]] membership features [[horn section|horns]], [[piano]] and guitar and has a membership of about 40 players, of whom only about seven to ten active members usually perform at a time. The group is led by singer Jack Terricloth, who has been the only constant during the group's history. Terricloth is known for his pointed commentary during shows; his monologues have touched on politics and his transformation from the \"old school\".\n\nIts lyrics often concern historical or biographical subjects, such as [[Weimar Republic|Weimar-era]] [[Germany]], [[Peter Lorre]], [[Jeffrey Lee Pierce]] of [[The Gun Club]], [[Paul Robeson]], [[Leni Riefenstahl]], [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Philip K. Dick]], and [[Jonathan Fire*Eater]].\n\n=={{anchor|Currently active members|Alumni}}Hallowmas==\nThe World/Inferno Friendship Society's annual [[Halloween]] show, Hallowmas, is its most-anticipated performance of the year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} The event is known for its elaborate planning and surprises. Past Hallowmases have included a burning effigy of Mr. Terricloth constructed and set alight by a large, caustic cat; an [[Anti-Social Music|ethereal string quartet]] performing throughout the evening in the rear of the hall; circus performances and [[fire breathing]] by the Odd Child Uprising troupe and a cadaverous marching band materializing on stage for the finale, \"Pumpkin Time\". The song (performed only at Hallowmas shows) includes street rallies, and references [[The Great Pumpkin]] from the ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip.\n\nWhile the band has had over 40 members come and go, Terricloth has maintained that they have always been more of a gang than an actual band. Many members continue to collaborate with the group, but do not join them on tour. {{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Members==\n===Current Members===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name !!

It is the [[county seat]] and largest city of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] in [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]]'s [[Wyoming Valley]] and hosts a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] building for the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania]]. With a population of 77,291, it is the largest city in the [[Scranton\u2013Wilkes-Barre\u2013Hazleton, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which has a population of about 570,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.com/scranton-wilkes-barre-pa-area.htm |title=Scranton, Wilkes, Barre Metro Area |publisher=Usa.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> The city is conventionally divided into 8 districts: North Scranton, Southside, Westside, the Hill Section, Central City, Minooka, East Mountain, and Green Ridge, though these areas do not have legal status.\n\nScranton is the geographic and cultural center of the [[Lackawanna River]] valley and Northeastern Pennsylvania, and the largest of the former [[anthracite coal]] mining communities in a contiguous quilt-work that also includes [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Nanticoke, Pennsylvania|Nanticoke]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], and [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania|Carbondale]]. Scranton was incorporated on February 14, 1856, as a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] in [[Luzerne County]] and as a [[city (Pennsylvania)|city]] on April 23, 1866. It became a major industrial city, a center of mining and railroads, and attracted thousands of new immigrants. It was the site of the [[Scranton General Strike]] in 1877.\n\nPeople in northern Luzerne County sought a new county in 1839 but the [[Wilkes-Barre]] area resisted losing its assets. Lackawanna County did not gain independent status until 1878. Under legislation allowing the issue to be voted by residents of the proposed territory, voters favored the new county by a proportion of 6 to 1, with Scranton residents providing the major support. The city was designated as the county seat when [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] was established in 1878, and a judicial district was authorized in July 1879.\n\nThe city's nickname \"Electric City\" began when electric lights were introduced in 1880 at the [[Dickson Manufacturing Company]]. Six years later, the United States's first [[streetcar]]s powered only by electricity began operating in the city.<ref>http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-39E</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/apps/historical-markers.html|title=Pennsylvania Historical Marker Search|website=www.phmc.state.pa.us}}</ref>{{dubious| the claim is widespread, but it simply means a single line was set up as electric.|date=May 2016}} Rev.

But while the national economy boomed after the war, demand for the region's coal declined as other forms of energy became more popular, which also harmed the rail industry. Foreseeing the decline, city leaders formulated the Scranton Plan in 1945 to diversify the local economy beyond coal, but the city's economy continued to decline. The [[Knox Mine disaster]] of 1959 essentially ended coal mining in the region. Scranton's population dropped from its peak of 140,000 in [[1940 United States Census|1940 census]] to 88,000 in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 census]]. The city's economy and population stabilized in the 1980s and 1990s. The city now has large health care and manufacturing sectors.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-industrial (1776\u20131845)===\nPresent-day Scranton and its surrounding area had been long inhabited by the native [[Lenape|Lenape tribe]], from whose language \"Lackawanna\" (or ''lac-a-wa-na,'' meaning \"stream that forks\"), is derived. In 1778, Isaac Tripp, the area's first known white settler, built his home here; it still stands in North Scranton, formerly a separate town known as Providence. More settlers from Connecticut came to the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries after the [[American Revolutionary War]], as their state claimed this area as part of their colonial charter.\n\nIn the 1840s there would have been at least 4 mentions of the office.  They gradually established mills and other small businesses in a village that became known as Slocum Hollow. People in the village during this time carried the traits and accent of their New England settlers, which were somewhat different from most of Pennsylvania. Some area settlers from Connecticut participated in what was known as the [[Pennamite Wars]], where settlers competed for control of the territory which had been included in royal colonial land grants to both states. (This claim between Connecticut and Pennsylvania was settled by negotiation with the federal government after independence.)\n\n===Arrival of industry (1846\u20131899)===\n[[File:George Inness - The Lackawanna Valley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton in 1855, as depicted by [[George Inness]]'s painting ''The Lackawanna Valley'', noting [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] ]]\n[[File:Scranton-1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton, as depicted on an 1890 panoramic map]] Though [[anthracite coal]] was being mined in Carbondale to the north and Wilkes-Barre to the south, the industries that precipitated the city's early rapid growth were [[iron]] and [[steel]]. In the 1840s, brothers Selden T. and [[George W. Scranton]], who had worked at [[Oxford Furnace]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], founded what became Lackawanna Iron & Coal, later developing as the [[Lackawanna Steel Company]]. It initially started producing iron nails, but that venture failed due to low-quality iron. The [[Erie Railroad]]'s construction in New York State was delayed by its having to acquire iron rails as imports from England. The Scrantons' firm decided to switch its focus to producing [[Rail profile|T-rails]] for the Erie; the company soon became a major producer of rails for the rapidly expanding railroads.\n\nIn 1851, the Scrantons built the [[Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (L&W) northward, with recent Irish immigrants supplying most of the labor, to meet the Erie Railroad in [[Great Bend, Pennsylvania]]. Thus they could transport manufactured rails from the Lackawanna Valley to New York and the Midwest. They also invested in coal mining operations in the city to fuel their steel operations, and to market it to businesses. In 1856, they expanded the railroad eastward as the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DL&W), in order to tap into the New York City metropolitan market. This railroad, with its hub in Scranton, was Scranton's largest employer for almost one hundred years.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Coal Company built a [[gravity railroad]] in the 1850s through the city for the purpose of transporting coal. The gravity railroad was replaced by a steam railroad built in 1886 by the Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad (later absorbed by the Erie Railroad).  The [[Delaware and Hudson]] (D&H) Canal Company, which had its own gravity railroad from Carbondale to [[Honesdale]], built a [[steam railroad]] that entered Scranton in 1863.\n\nDuring this short period of time, the city rapidly transformed from a small, agrarian-based village of people with New England roots to a multicultural, industrial-based city. From 1860 to 1900, the city's population increased more than tenfold. Most new immigrants, such as the Irish, Italians, and south Germans and Polish, were Catholic, a contrast to the majority-Protestant early settlers of colonial descent. National, ethnic, religious and class differences were wrapped into political affiliations, with many new immigrants joining the Democratic Party (and, for a time in the late 1870s, the [[Greenback Party|Greenbacker-Labor]] Party.)\n\nIn 1856, the Borough of Scranton was officially incorporated. It was incorporated as a city of 35,000 in 1866 in Luzerne County, when the surrounding boroughs of Hyde Park (now part of the city's West Side) and Providence (now part of North Scranton) were merged with Scranton. Twelve years later in 1878, the state passed a law enabling creation of new counties where a county's population surpassed 150,000, as did Luzerne's. The law appeared to enable the creation of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]], and there was considerable political agitation around the authorizing process. Scranton was designated by the state legislature as the county seat of the newly-formed county, which was also established as a separate judicial district, with state judges moving over from Luzerne County after courts were organized in October 1878. This was the last county in the state to be organized.\n\nCreation of the new county, which enabled both more local control and political patronage, helped begin the [[Scranton General Strike]] of 1877. This was in part due to the larger [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877|Great Railroad Strike]], in which railroad workers began to organize and participate in walkouts after wage cuts in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]]. The national economy had lagged since the Panic of 1873, and workers in many industries struggled with low wages and intermittent work. In Scranton, mineworkers followed the railroad men off the job, as did others. A protest of 5,000 strikers ended in violence, with a total of four men killed, and 20 to 50 injured, including the mayor. He had established a militia, but called for help from the governor and state militia. Governor [[John Hartranft]] eventually brought in federal troops to quell the strike. The workers gained nothing in wages, but began to organize more purposefully into labor unions that could wield more power.\n\nThe nation's first successful, continuously-operating electrified [[streetcar]] (trolley) system was established in the city in 1886, inspiring the nickname \"The Electric City\". In 1896, the city's various streetcar companies were consolidated into the [[Scranton Railway|Scranton Railway Company]], which ran trolleys until 1954. By 1890, three other railroads had built lines to tap into the rich supply of coal in and around the city, including the Erie Railroad, the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] and finally the [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway]] (NYO&W).\n\nAs the vast rail network spread above ground, an even larger network of railways served the rapidly expanding system of coal veins underground. Miners, who in the early years were typically Welsh and Irish, were hired as cheaply as possible by the coal barons. The workers endured low pay, long hours and unsafe working conditions. Children as young as eight or nine worked 14-hour days separating slate from coal in the [[coal breaker|breakers]]. Often, the workers were forced to use company-provided housing and purchase food and other goods from stores owned by the coal companies. With hundreds of thousands of immigrants arriving in the industrial cities, mine owners did not have to search for labor and workers struggled to keep their positions. Later miners came from Italy and eastern Europe, which people fled because of poverty and lack of jobs.\n\nBusiness was booming at the end of the 19th century. The tonnage of coal mined increased virtually every year, as did the steel manufactured by the Lackawanna Steel Company. At one point the company had the largest steel plant in the United States, and it was still the second-largest producer at the turn of the 20th century. By 1900, the city had a population of more than 100,000.\n\nIn the late 1890s, Scranton was home to a series of early [[International League]] baseball teams.\n\n===Labor history===\nGiven its industrial basis, Scranton has had a notable labor history; various coal worker unions struggled throughout the coal-mining era to improve working conditions, raise wages, and guarantee fair treatment for workers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Azzarelli, Margo L. |author2=Marnie Azzarelli|title=Labor Unrest in Scranton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sy4LDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT7|year=2016|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781625856814}}</ref>  The Panic of 1873 and other economic difficulties caused a national recession and loss of business. As the economy contracted, the railroad companies reduced wages of workers in most classes (while sometimes reserving raises for their top management). A major strike of railroad workers in August 1877, part of the [[Great Railroad Strike]], attracted workers from the steel industry and mining as well, and developed as the [[Scranton General Strike]]. Four rioters were killed during unrest during the strike, after the mayor mustered a militia. With violence suppressed by militia and federal troops, workers finally returned to their jobs, not able to gain any economic relief. [[William Walker Scranton]], from the prominent family, was then general manager of Lackawanna Iron and Coal. He later founded [[Scranton Steel Company]].\n\nThe labor issues and growth of industry in Scranton contributed to Lackawanna County being established by the state legislature in 1878, with territory taken from Luzerne County. Scranton was designated as the county seat. This strengthened its local government.\n\nThe unions failed to gain higher wages that year, but in 1878 they elected labor leader [[Terence V. Powderly]] of the [[Knights of Labor]] as mayor of Scranton. After that, he became national leader of the KoL, a predominately{{dubious|Perhaps a bare majority, although the situation may have been different in Scranton.|date=May 2016}} Catholic organization that had a peak membership of 700,000 about 1880.<ref>Vincent J. Falzone, \"Terence V. Powderly: Politician and Progressive Mayor of Scranton, 1878-1884,\" ''Pennsylvania History'' 41.3 (1974): 289-309.</ref> While the Catholic Church had prohibited membership in secret organizations since the mid-18th century, by the late 1880s with the influence of Archbishop [[James Gibbons]] of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], it supported the Knights of Labor as representing workingmen and union organizing.\n\nThe landmark [[Coal strike of 1902]], was called by anthracite miners across the region and led by the [[United Mine Workers]] under [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]]. The strike was settled by a compromise brokered by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. A statue of John Mitchell was installed in his honor on the grounds of the Lackawanna County Courthouse in Scranton, \"the site of the Coal Strike of 1902 negotiations in which President Roosevelt participated. Because of the significance of these negotiations, the statue and the Courthouse were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997. John Mitchell is buried in Cathedral Cemetery in Scranton.\"<ref>{{cite article|author=Sarah Scinto|title=Labor leader's grave restored|url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/labor-leader-s-grave-restored-1.1577236|publisher=Scranton Times-Tribune|date=October 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Growth, prosperity and consequences (1900\u20131945)===\n[[File:D.L. & W.

Most were descended from colonists and belonged to the Republican Party. The industrial workers, who tended to be later immigrants from Ireland and southern and eastern Europe, were predominately Catholic. With a flood of immigrants in the market, they suffered poor working conditions and wages.\n\nIn 1902, the dwindling local iron ore supply, labor issues, and an aging plant cost the city the industry on which it was founded. The Lackawanna Steel Company and many of its workers were moved to [[Lackawanna, New York]], developed on [[Lake Erie]] just south of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. With a port on the lake, the company could receive iron ore shipped from the [[Mesabi Range]] in Minnesota, which was being newly mined. \n[[File:The National geographic magazine (Page 377) BHL40563374 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|250px|City Hall and Soldiers Monument, ca. 1919, from ''National Geographic Magazine'']]\n\nScranton forged ahead as the capital of the anthracite coal industry. Attracting the thousands of workers needed to mine coal, the city developed new neighborhoods dominated by Italian and Eastern European immigrants, who brought their foods, cultures and religions. Many of the immigrants joined the Democratic Party. Their national churches and neighborhoods were part of the history of the city. Several [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches were founded and built during this period. A substantial Jewish community was also established, with most members coming from the Russian Empire and eastern Europe. Working conditions for miners were improved by the efforts of labor leaders such as [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]], who led the [[United Mine Workers]].\n\nThe sub-surface mining weakened whole neighborhoods, however, damaging homes, schools, and businesses when the land collapsed. In 1913 the state passed the Davis Act to establish the Bureau of Surface Support in Scranton. Because of the difficulty in dealing with the coal companies, citizens organized the [[Scranton Surface Protection Association]], chartered by the Court of Common Pleas on November 24, 1913 \"to protect the lives and property of the citizens of the City of Scranton and the streets of said city from injury, loss and damage caused by mining and mine caves.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\nIn 1915 and 1917, the city and Commonwealth sought injunctions to prevent coal companies from undermining city streets but lost their cases. North Main Avenue and Boulevard Avenue, \"both entitled to surface support, caved in as a result\" of court decisions that went against civil authorities and allowed the coal companies to continue their operations.<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\n\"The case of 'Penman v. Jones' came out differently. The Lackawanna Iron & Coal Co. had leased coal lands to the Lackawanna Iron & Steel Co., an allied interest, which passed the leases on to the Scranton Coal Co. Areas of central Scranton, the Hill Section, South Side, Pine Brook, Green Ridge and Hyde Park were affected by their mining activities. Mr. Penman was the private property owner in the case. The coal operators were defeated in this case.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\">[http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/scranton-takes-on-mining-cave-ins-1.1046286 Cheryl A.

The [[Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad]], commonly referred to as the Laurel Line, was built as an interurban passenger and freight carrier to [[Wilkes-Barre]]. Its Scranton station, offices, powerhouse and maintenance facility were built on the former grounds of the Lackawanna Steel Company, and operations started in 1903. Beginning in 1907, Scrantonians could also ride trolley cars to the northern suburbs of [[Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania|Clarks Summit]] and [[Dalton, Pennsylvania|Dalton]]. They could travel to [[Lake Winola]] and [[Montrose, Pennsylvania|Montrose]] using the [[Scranton, Montrose and Binghamton Railroad|Northern Electric]] Railroad. After the 1920s, no new trolley lines were built, but bus operations were started and expanded to meet service needs. In 1934, Scranton Railways was re-incorporated as the Scranton Transit Company, reflecting that shift in transportation modes.<ref>''The Scranton Republican,'' July 5, 1934, \"Railway Firm's New Financial Setup Revealed\", p. 1</ref>\n\nStarting in the early 1920s, the [[Scranton Button Company]] (founded in 1885 and a major maker of shellac buttons) became one of the primary makers of phonograph records. They pressed records for [[Emerson Records|Emerson]] (whom they bought in 1924), as well as [[Regal Records (1921)|Regal]], [[Cameo Records|Cameo]], [[Romeo Records|Romeo]], [[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Domino Records (1924)|Domino]], [[Conqueror Records|Conqueror]]. In July 1929, the company merged with Regal, Cameo, Banner, and the U.S. branch of [[Path\u00e9 Records|Path\u00e9]] (makers of Path\u00e9 and [[Perfect Records|Perfect]]) to become the [[American Record Corporation]]. By 1938, the Scranton company was also pressing records for [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], and [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]]. In 1946, the company was acquired by [[Capitol Records]], which continued to produce [[phonograph records]] through the end of the vinyl era.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, the city population had swelled beyond 140,000<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> due to growth in the mining and [[silk]] textile industries. World War II created a great demand for energy, which led to the highest production from [[mining]] in the area since World War I.\n\n{{Clear}}<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\">\nImage:Washington Avenue, Scranton, PA.jpg|Washington Ave. in 1907\nImage:Burning Culm Dump, Scranton, PA.jpg|Burning [[Spoil tip|culm]] dump c. 1908\nImage:Old Post Office, Scranton, PA.jpg|Old post office in 1911\n</gallery>\n\n===Post-World War II (1946\u20131984)===\nAfter World War II, coal lost favor to [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] as a heating fuel, largely because the latter types were more convenient to use. While some U.S. cities prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes and population of Scranton (and the rest of Lackawanna and [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne]] counties) began to diminish. Coal production and rail traffic declined rapidly throughout the 1950s, causing a loss of jobs.\n\nThe [[Knox Mine Disaster]] of January 1959 virtually ended the mining industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The waters of the [[Susquehanna River]] flooded the mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |title=The Citizens Voice \u2013 Knox mine disaster remains in our memory because it is a story of right and wrong |publisher=Zwire.com |accessdate=2011-08-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107061533/http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msha.gov/District/Dist_01/Reports/Knox/cover.htm |title=cover |publisher=Msha.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> The DL&W Railroad, nearly bankrupted by the drop in coal traffic and the effects of Hurricane Diane, merged in 1960 with the Erie Railroad.\nDemand for public transportation also declined as new highways were built by federal subsidies and people purchased automobiles. In 1952, the Laurel Line ceased passenger service. The Scranton Transit Company, whose trolleys had given the city its nickname, transferred all operations to buses as the 1954 holiday season approached; by the end of 1971, it ceased all operations. The city was left without any public transportation system for almost a year until the Lackawanna County government formed [[County of Lackawanna Transit System|COLTS]], which began operations in late 1972 with 1950s-era GM busses from New Jersey.\n\nScranton had been the hub of its operations until the [[Erie Lackawanna]] merger, after which it no longer served in this capacity. This was another severe blow to the local labor market. The NYO&W Railroad, which depended heavily on its Scranton branch for freight traffic, was abandoned in 1957. Mine [[subsidence]] was a spreading problem in the city as pillar supports in abandoned mines began to fail; cave-ins sometimes consumed entire blocks of homes. The area was left scarred by abandoned coal mining structures, strip mines, and massive [[culm dump]]s, some of which caught fire and burned for many years until they were extinguished through government efforts. In 1970, the Secretary of Mines for Pennsylvania suggested that so many underground voids had been left by mining underneath Scranton that it would be \"more economical\" to abandon the city than make them safe.<ref>{{cite book |title=Facts & Trivia |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |year=1998 |publisher=Siena |location=Bristol |isbn=0-75252-822-X |page=74}}</ref> In 1973, the last mine operations in Lackawanna County (which were in what is now [[McDade Park]], and another on the Scranton/[[Dickson City]] line) were closed.

Local government and much of the community at large have adopted a renewed interest in the city's buildings and history. Some historic properties have been renovated and marketed as tourist attractions. The [[Steamtown National Historic Site]] captures the area's once-prominent position in the railroad industry. The former DL&W train station was restored as the [[Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel]]. The [[Electric City Trolley Museum]] was created next to the DL&W yards that the Steamtown NHS occupies.\n\nSince the mid-1980s the [[Scranton Cultural Center]] has operated the architecturally significant Masonic Temple and Scottish Rite Cathedral, designed by [[Raymond Hood]], as the region's performing arts center. The [[Houdini Museum]] was opened in Scranton in 1990 by nationally known magician [[Dorothy Dietrich]].\n\nIn 2003, [[Hilton Hotels & Resorts]] opened the [http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/pennsylvania/hilton-scranton-and-conference-center-SCRCCHF/index.html Hilton Scranton Hotel & Conference Center] at the corner of Adams Avenue & Lackawanna Avenue in the heart of downtown Scranton.

It is the [[county seat]] and largest city of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] in [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]]'s [[Wyoming Valley]] and hosts a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] building for the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania]]. With a population of 77,291, it is the largest city in the [[Scranton\u2013Wilkes-Barre\u2013Hazleton, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which has a population of about 570,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.com/scranton-wilkes-barre-pa-area.htm |title=Scranton, Wilkes, Barre Metro Area |publisher=Usa.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> The city is conventionally divided into 8 districts: North Scranton, Southside, Westside, the Hill Section, Central City, Minooka, East Mountain, and Green Ridge, though these areas do not have legal status.\n\nScranton is the geographic and cultural center of the [[Lackawanna River]] valley and Northeastern Pennsylvania, and the largest of the former [[anthracite coal]] mining communities in a contiguous quilt-work that also includes [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Nanticoke, Pennsylvania|Nanticoke]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], and [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania|Carbondale]]. Scranton was incorporated on February 14, 1856, as a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] in [[Luzerne County]] and as a [[city (Pennsylvania)|city]] on April 23, 1866. It became a major industrial city, a center of mining and railroads, and attracted thousands of new immigrants. It was the site of the [[Scranton General Strike]] in 1877.\n\nPeople in northern Luzerne County sought a new county in 1839 but the [[Wilkes-Barre]] area resisted losing its assets. Lackawanna County did not gain independent status until 1878. Under legislation allowing the issue to be voted by residents of the proposed territory, voters favored the new county by a proportion of 6 to 1, with Scranton residents providing the major support. The city was designated as the county seat when [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] was established in 1878, and a judicial district was authorized in July 1879.\n\nThe city's nickname \"Electric City\" began when electric lights were introduced in 1880 at the [[Dickson Manufacturing Company]]. Six years later, the United States's first [[streetcar]]s powered only by electricity began operating in the city.<ref>http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-39E</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/apps/historical-markers.html|title=Pennsylvania Historical Marker Search|website=www.phmc.state.pa.us}}</ref>{{dubious| the claim is widespread, but it simply means a single line was set up as electric.|date=May 2016}} Rev.

But while the national economy boomed after the war, demand for the region's coal declined as other forms of energy became more popular, which also harmed the rail industry. Foreseeing the decline, city leaders formulated the Scranton Plan in 1945 to diversify the local economy beyond coal, but the city's economy continued to decline. The [[Knox Mine disaster]] of 1959 essentially ended coal mining in the region. Scranton's population dropped from its peak of 140,000 in [[1940 United States Census|1940 census]] to 88,000 in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 census]]. The city's economy and population stabilized in the 1980s and 1990s. The city now has large health care and manufacturing sectors.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-industrial (1776\u20131845)===\nPresent-day Scranton and its surrounding area had been long inhabited by the native [[Lenape|Lenape tribe]], from whose language \"Lackawanna\" (or ''lac-a-wa-na,'' meaning \"stream that forks\"), is derived. In 1778, Isaac Tripp, the area's first known white settler, built his home here; it still stands in North Scranton, formerly a separate town known as Providence. More settlers from Connecticut came to the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries after the [[American Revolutionary War]], as their state claimed this area as part of their colonial charter.\n\nIn the 1840s there would have been at least 4 mentions of the office.  They gradually established mills and other small businesses in a village that became known as Slocum Hollow. People in the village during this time carried the traits and accent of their New England settlers, which were somewhat different from most of Pennsylvania. Some area settlers from Connecticut participated in what was known as the [[Pennamite Wars]], where settlers competed for control of the territory which had been included in royal colonial land grants to both states. (This claim between Connecticut and Pennsylvania was settled by negotiation with the federal government after independence.)\n\n===Arrival of industry (1846\u20131899)===\n[[File:George Inness - The Lackawanna Valley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton in 1855, as depicted by [[George Inness]]'s painting ''The Lackawanna Valley'', noting [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] ]]\n[[File:Scranton-1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton, as depicted on an 1890 panoramic map]] Though [[anthracite coal]] was being mined in Carbondale to the north and Wilkes-Barre to the south, the industries that precipitated the city's early rapid growth were [[iron]] and [[steel]]. In the 1840s, brothers Selden T. and [[George W. Scranton]], who had worked at [[Oxford Furnace]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], founded what became Lackawanna Iron & Coal, later developing as the [[Lackawanna Steel Company]]. It initially started producing iron nails, but that venture failed due to low-quality iron. The [[Erie Railroad]]'s construction in New York State was delayed by its having to acquire iron rails as imports from England. The Scrantons' firm decided to switch its focus to producing [[Rail profile|T-rails]] for the Erie; the company soon became a major producer of rails for the rapidly expanding railroads.\n\nIn 1851, the Scrantons built the [[Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (L&W) northward, with recent Irish immigrants supplying most of the labor, to meet the Erie Railroad in [[Great Bend, Pennsylvania]]. Thus they could transport manufactured rails from the Lackawanna Valley to New York and the Midwest. They also invested in coal mining operations in the city to fuel their steel operations, and to market it to businesses. In 1856, they expanded the railroad eastward as the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DL&W), in order to tap into the New York City metropolitan market. This railroad, with its hub in Scranton, was Scranton's largest employer for almost one hundred years.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Coal Company built a [[gravity railroad]] in the 1850s through the city for the purpose of transporting coal. The gravity railroad was replaced by a steam railroad built in 1886 by the Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad (later absorbed by the Erie Railroad).  The [[Delaware and Hudson]] (D&H) Canal Company, which had its own gravity railroad from Carbondale to [[Honesdale]], built a [[steam railroad]] that entered Scranton in 1863.\n\nDuring this short period of time, the city rapidly transformed from a small, agrarian-based village of people with New England roots to a multicultural, industrial-based city. From 1860 to 1900, the city's population increased more than tenfold. Most new immigrants, such as the Irish, Italians, and south Germans and Polish, were Catholic, a contrast to the majority-Protestant early settlers of colonial descent. National, ethnic, religious and class differences were wrapped into political affiliations, with many new immigrants joining the Democratic Party (and, for a time in the late 1870s, the [[Greenback Party|Greenbacker-Labor]] Party.)\n\nIn 1856, the Borough of Scranton was officially incorporated. It was incorporated as a city of 35,000 in 1866 in Luzerne County, when the surrounding boroughs of Hyde Park (now part of the city's West Side) and Providence (now part of North Scranton) were merged with Scranton. Twelve years later in 1878, the state passed a law enabling creation of new counties where a county's population surpassed 150,000, as did Luzerne's. The law appeared to enable the creation of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]], and there was considerable political agitation around the authorizing process. Scranton was designated by the state legislature as the county seat of the newly-formed county, which was also established as a separate judicial district, with state judges moving over from Luzerne County after courts were organized in October 1878. This was the last county in the state to be organized.\n\nCreation of the new county, which enabled both more local control and political patronage, helped begin the [[Scranton General Strike]] of 1877. This was in part due to the larger [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877|Great Railroad Strike]], in which railroad workers began to organize and participate in walkouts after wage cuts in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]]. The national economy had lagged since the Panic of 1873, and workers in many industries struggled with low wages and intermittent work. In Scranton, mineworkers followed the railroad men off the job, as did others. A protest of 5,000 strikers ended in violence, with a total of four men killed, and 20 to 50 injured, including the mayor. He had established a militia, but called for help from the governor and state militia. Governor [[John Hartranft]] eventually brought in federal troops to quell the strike. The workers gained nothing in wages, but began to organize more purposefully into labor unions that could wield more power.\n\nThe nation's first successful, continuously-operating electrified [[streetcar]] (trolley) system was established in the city in 1886, inspiring the nickname \"The Electric City\". In 1896, the city's various streetcar companies were consolidated into the [[Scranton Railway|Scranton Railway Company]], which ran trolleys until 1954. By 1890, three other railroads had built lines to tap into the rich supply of coal in and around the city, including the Erie Railroad, the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] and finally the [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway]] (NYO&W).\n\nAs the vast rail network spread above ground, an even larger network of railways served the rapidly expanding system of coal veins underground. Miners, who in the early years were typically Welsh and Irish, were hired as cheaply as possible by the coal barons. The workers endured low pay, long hours and unsafe working conditions. Children as young as eight or nine worked 14-hour days separating slate from coal in the [[coal breaker|breakers]]. Often, the workers were forced to use company-provided housing and purchase food and other goods from stores owned by the coal companies. With hundreds of thousands of immigrants arriving in the industrial cities, mine owners did not have to search for labor and workers struggled to keep their positions. Later miners came from Italy and eastern Europe, which people fled because of poverty and lack of jobs.\n\nBusiness was booming at the end of the 19th century. The tonnage of coal mined increased virtually every year, as did the steel manufactured by the Lackawanna Steel Company. At one point the company had the largest steel plant in the United States, and it was still the second-largest producer at the turn of the 20th century. By 1900, the city had a population of more than 100,000.\n\nIn the late 1890s, Scranton was home to a series of early [[International League]] baseball teams.\n\n===Labor history===\nGiven its industrial basis, Scranton has had a notable labor history; various coal worker unions struggled throughout the coal-mining era to improve working conditions, raise wages, and guarantee fair treatment for workers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Azzarelli, Margo L. |author2=Marnie Azzarelli|title=Labor Unrest in Scranton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sy4LDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT7|year=2016|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781625856814}}</ref>  The Panic of 1873 and other economic difficulties caused a national recession and loss of business. As the economy contracted, the railroad companies reduced wages of workers in most classes (while sometimes reserving raises for their top management). A major strike of railroad workers in August 1877, part of the [[Great Railroad Strike]], attracted workers from the steel industry and mining as well, and developed as the [[Scranton General Strike]]. Four rioters were killed during unrest during the strike, after the mayor mustered a militia. With violence suppressed by militia and federal troops, workers finally returned to their jobs, not able to gain any economic relief. [[William Walker Scranton]], from the prominent family, was then general manager of Lackawanna Iron and Coal. He later founded [[Scranton Steel Company]].\n\nThe labor issues and growth of industry in Scranton contributed to Lackawanna County being established by the state legislature in 1878, with territory taken from Luzerne County. Scranton was designated as the county seat. This strengthened its local government.\n\nThe unions failed to gain higher wages that year, but in 1878 they elected labor leader [[Terence V. Powderly]] of the [[Knights of Labor]] as mayor of Scranton. After that, he became national leader of the KoL, a predominately{{dubious|Perhaps a bare majority, although the situation may have been different in Scranton.|date=May 2016}} Catholic organization that had a peak membership of 700,000 about 1880.<ref>Vincent J.

The strike was settled by a compromise brokered by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. A statue of John Mitchell was installed in his honor on the grounds of the Lackawanna County Courthouse in Scranton, \"the site of the Coal Strike of 1902 negotiations in which President Roosevelt participated. Because of the significance of these negotiations, the statue and the Courthouse were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997. John Mitchell is buried in Cathedral Cemetery in Scranton.\"<ref>{{cite article|author=Sarah Scinto|title=Labor leader's grave restored|url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/labor-leader-s-grave-restored-1.1577236|publisher=Scranton Times-Tribune|date=October 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Growth, prosperity and consequences (1900\u20131945)===\n[[File:D.L. & W.

Most were descended from colonists and belonged to the Republican Party. The industrial workers, who tended to be later immigrants from Ireland and southern and eastern Europe, were predominately Catholic. With a flood of immigrants in the market, they suffered poor working conditions and wages.\n\nIn 1902, the dwindling local iron ore supply, labor issues, and an aging plant cost the city the industry on which it was founded. The Lackawanna Steel Company and many of its workers were moved to [[Lackawanna, New York]], developed on [[Lake Erie]] just south of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. With a port on the lake, the company could receive iron ore shipped from the [[Mesabi Range]] in Minnesota, which was being newly mined. \n[[File:The National geographic magazine (Page 377) BHL40563374 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|250px|City Hall and Soldiers Monument, ca. 1919, from ''National Geographic Magazine'']]\n\nScranton forged ahead as the capital of the anthracite coal industry. Attracting the thousands of workers needed to mine coal, the city developed new neighborhoods dominated by Italian and Eastern European immigrants, who brought their foods, cultures and religions. Many of the immigrants joined the Democratic Party. Their national churches and neighborhoods were part of the history of the city. Several [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches were founded and built during this period. A substantial Jewish community was also established, with most members coming from the Russian Empire and eastern Europe. Working conditions for miners were improved by the efforts of labor leaders such as [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]], who led the [[United Mine Workers]].\n\nThe sub-surface mining weakened whole neighborhoods, however, damaging homes, schools, and businesses when the land collapsed. In 1913 the state passed the Davis Act to establish the Bureau of Surface Support in Scranton. Because of the difficulty in dealing with the coal companies, citizens organized the [[Scranton Surface Protection Association]], chartered by the Court of Common Pleas on November 24, 1913 \"to protect the lives and property of the citizens of the City of Scranton and the streets of said city from injury, loss and damage caused by mining and mine caves.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\nIn 1915 and 1917, the city and Commonwealth sought injunctions to prevent coal companies from undermining city streets but lost their cases. North Main Avenue and Boulevard Avenue, \"both entitled to surface support, caved in as a result\" of court decisions that went against civil authorities and allowed the coal companies to continue their operations.<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\n\"The case of 'Penman v. Jones' came out differently. The Lackawanna Iron & Coal Co. had leased coal lands to the Lackawanna Iron & Steel Co., an allied interest, which passed the leases on to the Scranton Coal Co. Areas of central Scranton, the Hill Section, South Side, Pine Brook, Green Ridge and Hyde Park were affected by their mining activities. Mr. Penman was the private property owner in the case. The coal operators were defeated in this case.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\">[http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/scranton-takes-on-mining-cave-ins-1.1046286 Cheryl A.

The [[Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad]], commonly referred to as the Laurel Line, was built as an interurban passenger and freight carrier to [[Wilkes-Barre]]. Its Scranton station, offices, powerhouse and maintenance facility were built on the former grounds of the Lackawanna Steel Company, and operations started in 1903. Beginning in 1907, Scrantonians could also ride trolley cars to the northern suburbs of [[Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania|Clarks Summit]] and [[Dalton, Pennsylvania|Dalton]]. They could travel to [[Lake Winola]] and [[Montrose, Pennsylvania|Montrose]] using the [[Scranton, Montrose and Binghamton Railroad|Northern Electric]] Railroad. After the 1920s, no new trolley lines were built, but bus operations were started and expanded to meet service needs. In 1934, Scranton Railways was re-incorporated as the Scranton Transit Company, reflecting that shift in transportation modes.<ref>''The Scranton Republican,'' July 5, 1934, \"Railway Firm's New Financial Setup Revealed\", p. 1</ref>\n\nStarting in the early 1920s, the [[Scranton Button Company]] (founded in 1885 and a major maker of shellac buttons) became one of the primary makers of phonograph records. They pressed records for [[Emerson Records|Emerson]] (whom they bought in 1924), as well as [[Regal Records (1921)|Regal]], [[Cameo Records|Cameo]], [[Romeo Records|Romeo]], [[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Domino Records (1924)|Domino]], [[Conqueror Records|Conqueror]]. In July 1929, the company merged with Regal, Cameo, Banner, and the U.S. branch of [[Path\u00e9 Records|Path\u00e9]] (makers of Path\u00e9 and [[Perfect Records|Perfect]]) to become the [[American Record Corporation]]. By 1938, the Scranton company was also pressing records for [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], and [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]]. In 1946, the company was acquired by [[Capitol Records]], which continued to produce [[phonograph records]] through the end of the vinyl era.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, the city population had swelled beyond 140,000<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> due to growth in the mining and [[silk]] textile industries. World War II created a great demand for energy, which led to the highest production from [[mining]] in the area since World War I.\n\n{{Clear}}<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\">\nImage:Washington Avenue, Scranton, PA.jpg|Washington Ave. in 1907\nImage:Burning Culm Dump, Scranton, PA.jpg|Burning [[Spoil tip|culm]] dump c. 1908\nImage:Old Post Office, Scranton, PA.jpg|Old post office in 1911\n</gallery>\n\n===Post-World War II (1946\u20131984)===\nAfter World War II, coal lost favor to [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] as a heating fuel, largely because the latter types were more convenient to use. While some U.S. cities prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes and population of Scranton (and the rest of Lackawanna and [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne]] counties) began to diminish. Coal production and rail traffic declined rapidly throughout the 1950s, causing a loss of jobs.\n\nThe [[Knox Mine Disaster]] of January 1959 virtually ended the mining industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The waters of the [[Susquehanna River]] flooded the mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |title=The Citizens Voice \u2013 Knox mine disaster remains in our memory because it is a story of right and wrong |publisher=Zwire.com |accessdate=2011-08-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107061533/http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msha.gov/District/Dist_01/Reports/Knox/cover.htm |title=cover |publisher=Msha.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> The DL&W Railroad, nearly bankrupted by the drop in coal traffic and the effects of Hurricane Diane, merged in 1960 with the Erie Railroad.\nDemand for public transportation also declined as new highways were built by federal subsidies and people purchased automobiles. In 1952, the Laurel Line ceased passenger service. The Scranton Transit Company, whose trolleys had given the city its nickname, transferred all operations to buses as the 1954 holiday season approached; by the end of 1971, it ceased all operations. The city was left without any public transportation system for almost a year until the Lackawanna County government formed [[County of Lackawanna Transit System|COLTS]], which began operations in late 1972 with 1950s-era GM busses from New Jersey.\n\nScranton had been the hub of its operations until the [[Erie Lackawanna]] merger, after which it no longer served in this capacity. This was another severe blow to the local labor market. The NYO&W Railroad, which depended heavily on its Scranton branch for freight traffic, was abandoned in 1957. Mine [[subsidence]] was a spreading problem in the city as pillar supports in abandoned mines began to fail; cave-ins sometimes consumed entire blocks of homes. The area was left scarred by abandoned coal mining structures, strip mines, and massive [[culm dump]]s, some of which caught fire and burned for many years until they were extinguished through government efforts. In 1970, the Secretary of Mines for Pennsylvania suggested that so many underground voids had been left by mining underneath Scranton that it would be \"more economical\" to abandon the city than make them safe.<ref>{{cite book |title=Facts & Trivia |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |year=1998 |publisher=Siena |location=Bristol |isbn=0-75252-822-X |page=74}}</ref> In 1973, the last mine operations in Lackawanna County (which were in what is now [[McDade Park]], and another on the Scranton/[[Dickson City]] line) were closed.
