The Turco-Mongols blockaded the harbour and attacked the fortifications with stone-throwing [[siege engines]], while the defenders, numbering only about 200 [[knight]]s, countered with arrows and incendiary projectiles. After two weeks of strong resistance against a far superior adversary, the [[Enceinte|outer wall]] was destroyed by [[Mining (military)|mining]] and breached. Some of the garrison managed to escape by sea, but the inhabitants and the city itself were destroyed.\n\nThe main sources for the siege are the Persian historians [[Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi]] and [[Mirkhwand]] and the Arab [[Ahmad ibn Arabshah]], who wrote in the service of Timur's successors. For the Knights of Rhodes, the official history of [[Giacomo Bosio]], written early in the seventeenth century, is an important source. From the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] (Turkish) perspective, there is [[Ne\u015fri]] and the ''K\u00fcnh\u00fc'l-a\u1e2bb\u0101r'' of [[Mustafa \u00c2l\u00ee]]. For the Byzantines, there are [[Doukas (historian)|Doukas]] and [[Laonikos Chalkokondyles]]; for the Genoese, [[Agostino Giustiniani]].\n\n==Preparations==\nSmyrna had been captured by [[Smyrniote crusades|a crusade in 1344]] and became a Papal city. The Turks continued to control the inland acropolis, however, but the sea-castle allowed the crusaders to control the harbour. From 1374, the Knights of Rhodes were in charge of its defences.{{sfn|Nicolle|2007|p=8}} In 1400, Timur launched a war against the Ottoman Empire that culminated in his victory at the [[Battle of Ankara]] on 20 July 1402.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|p=41}}\n\nIn the aftermath of Ankara, the outpost of the [[Maona di Chio e di Focea|Genoese ''Maona'']] at [[Yenifo\u00e7a|New Phocaea]] sent a certain Galeazzo as an ambassador to Timur's camp to seek terms. He remained there three days, returning to New Phocaea with an agreement on 22 September.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|pp=88\u201390}} A knight, Brother Dominic de Alamania,{{efn|On 17 February 1402, the grand master appointed Dominic commander for life of Rogera (an unidentified place) and [[Foinikas, Cyprus|Finica]] on Cyprus. These commanderies had an annual revenue totaling 1,000 florins. In exchange, Dominic gave the order 11,200 florins and was permitted thereafter to remit only 500 florins per year from Rogera and Finica.{{sfn|Delaville Le Roulx|1913|pp=284\u201386}}}} was then sent to the island of [[Chios]], also belonging to the Genoese ''Maona'', in order to persuade the local leaders not to ally with Timur.{{sfn|Luttrell|1975|p=308}}{{sfn|Knobler|1995|pp=347\u201348}}\n\nWhile Timur's forces ravaged the Anatolian countryside, targeting Turkish settlements, the Knights of Rhodes prepared the defence of Smyrna. In 1398, under the direction of Brother Guillaume de Munte, a deep ditch had been dug across the promontory to separate the castle from the mainland. In 1402, the garrison of Smyrna numbered 200 knights under the command of the castellan [[\u00cd\u00f1igo de Alfaro]].{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|pp=88\u201390}}{{sfn|Luttrell|1975|p=308}}{{sfn|Nicolle|2007|p=50}} The garrison's pay was raised to 100 [[Florin (Italian coin)|florins]] per knight per year. To cover the increased costs of defence of Smyrna, the central convent authorised an extraordinary subvention of 20,000 florins from the priories.{{efn|3,200 from Saint-Gilles; 3,000 from France; 2,500 from Amposta; 2,500 from England; 2,000 from Auvergne; 2,000 from Catalonia; 1,500 from Castile and Le\u00f3n; 1,200 from Aquitaine; 1,000 from Germany and Bohemia; 800 from Champagne; and 800 from Toulouse.}}{{sfn|Delaville Le Roulx|1913|pp=284\u201386}}\n\nDefensive preparations in the summer of 1402 were overseen by Admiral Buffilo Panizzatti,{{efn|Sometimes spelled Panizati or Panizato. He was the prior of [[Barletta]] from 4 March 1395.

The Turco-Mongols blockaded the harbour and attacked the fortifications with stone-throwing [[siege engines]], while the defenders, numbering only about 200 [[knight]]s, countered with arrows and incendiary projectiles. After two weeks of strong resistance against a far superior adversary, the [[Enceinte|outer wall]] was destroyed by [[Mining (military)|mining]] and breached. Some of the garrison managed to escape by sea, but the inhabitants and the city itself were destroyed.\n\nThe main sources for the siege are the Persian historians [[Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi]] and [[Mirkhwand]] and the Arab [[Ahmad ibn Arabshah]], who wrote in the service of Timur's successors. For the Knights of Rhodes, the official history of [[Giacomo Bosio]], written early in the seventeenth century, is an important source.

For the Byzantines, there are [[Doukas (historian)|Doukas]] and [[Laonikos Chalkokondyles]]; for the Genoese, [[Agostino Giustiniani]].\n\n==Preparations==\nSmyrna had been captured by [[Smyrniote crusades|a crusade in 1344]] and became a Papal city. The Turks continued to control the inland acropolis, however, but the sea-castle allowed the crusaders to control the harbour. From 1374, the Knights of Rhodes were in charge of its defences.{{sfn|Nicolle|2007|p=8}} In 1400, Timur launched a war against the Ottoman Empire that culminated in his victory at the [[Battle of Ankara]] on 20 July 1402.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|p=41}}\n\nIn the aftermath of Ankara, the outpost of the [[Maona di Chio e di Focea|Genoese ''Maona'']] at [[Yenifo\u00e7a|New Phocaea]] sent a certain Galeazzo as an ambassador to Timur's camp to seek terms.

Salvini handed the shocked Lipinski the Stradivarius: \"...as a gift from me, and, simultaneously, as a commemoration of Tartini.\"<ref>Articles in ''The Violin Times'' 1895 and 1896, reported by Krzysztof Rottermund \"Stradivari, Guarneri and Amati: a history of Karol Lipi\u0144ski's violins\" in Maya Trochimczyk, ed.

After Anschuetz moved to the [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] area, the violin was stored in a local bank vault.  Upon Anschuetz' death in February 2008,  ownership of the violin passed to an anonymous family member, who lent the ''Lipinski'' to [[Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra]] [[concertmaster]] [[Frank Almond]].<ref name=\"jso20080906\">{{cite news | author=Tom Strini | title=Encore for a Stradivarius | date=2008-09-06 | url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=791756 | work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel | accessdate=2008-09-06 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910050332/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=791756 | archivedate=2008-09-10 }}</ref>\n\n===2014 theft===\nOn January 27, 2014, a Monday, at around 10:20 pm (22:20 [[Central Time Zone|CST]]), Almond was assaulted with a [[Taser]], and the violin, including two bows, was stolen during an armed robbery in a parking lot in the rear of [[Wisconsin Lutheran College]] on West Wisconsin Avenue.

He was most noted for his time as Brigadier of the North Belfast [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA). After falling from grace, Simpson spent a number of years outside Northern Ireland. He returned to [[Belfast]] in 2014 in a move related to an ongoing [[loyalist feud]].\n\n==Early years==\nSimpson, a native of the [[Tiger's Bay]] area of north Belfast, joined the UDA in the early 1970s, claiming later that he did so as he felt that \"there was no one to defend our streets from [[Irish republicanism|republicans]] in the [[New Lodge, Belfast|New Lodge]] [a neighbouring Catholic district]\".<ref>Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, ''UDA \u2013 Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror'' Penguin Ireland, 2004, p. 346</ref> \n\nHe would go on to assume command of the North Belfast brigade, making him one of the six Inner Council members that led the UDA.

Greer was killed by the North Belfast UVF on Mountcollyer Street on 28 October whilst two days later the Tiger's Bay UDA retaliated by killing Herbert Rice, a 63-year-old [[Progressive Unionist Party]] (PUP) activist who had been in the UVF in the late 1960s.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, ''UDA'', p. 334</ref> \n\n[[Tommy English (loyalist)|Tommy English]], an [[Ulster Democratic Party]] (UDP) spokesman and veteran street-fighter, was killed by the UVF that same night in [[Newtownabbey]], and before long John Gregg's [[UDA South East Antrim Brigade]] joined the growing feud.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, ''UDA'', p. 335</ref>\n\nBy the early years of the 21st century, Simpson's control in north Belfast had become nominal as the brigade had witnessed an influx of young members who were attracted by Adair's militancy.

Simpson believed that Catholics were attempting to encroach on Protestant territory, largely due to the overcrowding on the New Lodge and the presence of many empty houses in Tiger's Bay. [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]'s North Belfast spokesman, [[Gerry Kelly]], had called on the [[Northern Ireland Housing Executive]] to move the [[peace lines]] to build new housing for Catholics, a statement Simpson regarded as provocative.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, ''UDA'', p. 345</ref> \n\nOne of his last acts as brigadier was part of the [[Holy Cross dispute]] in which loyalists began to picket a Catholic primary school in [[Ardoyne]].

In response to the claims, Simpson issued a statement claiming that if this treatment continued then the police and their families would be targeted by the North Belfast UDA.
