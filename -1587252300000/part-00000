The town is situated on the main road connecting [[Belgrade]] and [[U\u017eice]] in Serbia with [[Gora\u017ede]] and [[Sarajevo]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a vital link for the U\u017eice Corps of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) with the [[Uzamnica camp]] as well as other strategic locations implicated in the conflict.<ref name=\"ICTY: Milan Luki\u0107 and Sredoje Luki\u0107 judgement\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/milan_lukic_sredoje_lukic/tjug/en/090720_j.pdf|title=ICTY: Milan Luki\u0107 and Sredoje Luki\u0107 judgement}}</ref><ref name=\"ICTY: Mitar Vasiljevi\u0107 judgement\"/>\n\nOn 6 April 1992, JNA artillery bombarded the town, in particular Bosniak-inhabited neighbourhoods and nearby villages.

The town is situated on the main road connecting [[Belgrade]] and [[U\u017eice]] in Serbia with [[Gora\u017ede]] and [[Sarajevo]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a vital link for the U\u017eice Corps of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) with the [[Uzamnica camp]] as well as other strategic locations implicated in the conflict.<ref name=\"ICTY: Milan Luki\u0107 and Sredoje Luki\u0107 judgement\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/milan_lukic_sredoje_lukic/tjug/en/090720_j.pdf|title=ICTY: Milan Luki\u0107 and Sredoje Luki\u0107 judgement}}</ref><ref name=\"ICTY: Mitar Vasiljevi\u0107 judgement\"/>\n\nOn 6 April 1992, JNA artillery bombarded the town, in particular Bosniak-inhabited neighbourhoods and nearby villages.

Water was released from the dam causing flooding to some houses and streets.<ref name=\"ICTY: Mitar Vasiljevi\u0107 judgement\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/vasiljevic/tjug/en/vas021129.pdf|title=ICTY: Mitar Vasiljevi\u0107 judgement}}</ref> Eventually on 12 April, JNA commandos seized the dam. The next day the JNA's U\u017eice Corps took control of Vi\u0161egrad, positioning tanks and heavy artillery around the town. The population that had fled the town during the crisis returned and the climate in the town remained relatively calm and stable during the later part of April and the first two weeks of May.<ref name=\"ICTY: Mitar Vasiljevi\u0107 judgement\"/>  On 19 May 1992 the U\u017eice Corps officially withdrew from the town and local Serb leaders established control over Vi\u0161egrad and all municipal government offices. Soon after, local Serbs, police and paramilitaries began [[Vi\u0161egrad massacres|one of the most notorious campaigns]] of ethnic cleansing in the conflict.<ref name=\"ICTY: Mitar Vasiljevi\u0107 judgement\"/>\n\nThere was widespread looting and destruction of houses, and terrorizing of Bosniak civilians, with instances of rape, with a large number of Bosniaks killed in the town, with many bodies were dumped in the River Drina. Men were detained at the [[Uzamnica camp|barracks at Uzamnica]], the [[Vilina Vlas]] Hotel and other sites in the area. Vilina Vlas also served as a \"[[brothel]]\", in which Bosniak women and girls (some not yet 14 years old), were brought to by police officers and paramilitary members ([[White Eagles (paramilitary)|White Eagles]] and [[Serb Volunteer Guard|Arkan's Tigers]]).<ref name=ess>{{cite conference |title=Annex VIII - Prison camps; Under the Direction of: M.

It began on March 13, 1986, and ended with the [[1986 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on March 31 in [[Dallas, Texas]]. A total of 63 games were played.\n\n[[1985\u201386 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|Louisville]], coached by [[Denny Crum]], won the national title with a 72\u201369 victory in the final game over [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]], coached by [[Mike Krzyzewski]]. [[Pervis Ellison]] of [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] was named the tournament's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]].  Louisville became the first team from outside a power conference to win the championship since the expansion to 64 teams, and remains one of only two teams to do so (the other team was UNLV in 1990).\n\nThe 1986 NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Tournament was the first tournament to use a [[shot clock]] limiting the amount of time for any one offensive possession by a team prior to taking a shot at the basket.  Beginning with the 1986 tournament, the [[shot clock]] was set at 45 seconds, which it would remain until being shortened to 35 seconds beginning in the [[1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], and further shortened to 30 seconds (the same as NCAA women's basketball) starting with the [[2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]]. The 1986 tournament was also the last to not feature the [[Three-point field goal|three-point shot]].\n\n[[1985\u201386 LSU Tigers basketball team|LSU]]'s 1985\u201386 team is tied for the lowest-seeded team (#11) to ever make the [[Final Four]] with the [[2005\u201306 George Mason Patriots men's basketball team|2005\u201306 George Mason Patriots]], the [[2010\u201311 VCU Rams men's basketball team|2010\u201311 VCU Rams]], and the [[2017-18 Loyola Ramblers men's basketball team|2017\u201318 Loyola-Chicago Ramblers]]. As of 2018, they are the only team in tournament history to beat the top 3 seeds from their region. LSU began its run to the Final Four by winning two games on its home court, the [[Pete Maravich Assembly Center|LSU Assembly Center]], leading to a change two years later which prohibited teams from playing NCAA tournament games on a court which they have played four or more games in the regular season. [[Cleveland State University]] became the first #14 seed to reach the Sweet Sixteen, losing to their fellow underdog, Navy, by a single point. This was also the first year in which two #14 seeds reached the second round in the same year, as [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock|Arkansas-Little Rock]] beat #3-seed Notre Dame; however, they lost their second-round game in overtime.  Both feats have only occurred one other time. [[University of Tennessee at Chattanooga|Chattanooga]] reached the Sweet Sixteen as a 14-seed in 1997, and [[Old Dominion University|Old Dominion]] and [[Weber State University|Weber State]] both reached the second round as 14-seeds in 1995.\n\nEvery regional final featured a #1 or #2 seed playing a team seeded #6 or lower. The lone #1 seed to not reach the Elite Eight, St. John's (West), was knocked out in the second round by #8 Auburn, which lost to #2 Louisville in the regional final.\n\nIt can be argued that these upsets by the 14-seeds launched the NCAA Tournament's reputation for having unknown teams surprise well-known basketball powers, and both happened on the same day. Indiana's stunning loss would be part of the climax in the best-selling book [[A Season On The Brink]].\n\nAnother story of the tournament was when [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] reached the Elite 8 thanks to stunning performances by [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]]. This tournament had no Pac 10 teams advance beyond the round of 64.

While the city itself has not hosted another Final Four, the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex would host again in 2014 at [[AT&T Stadium]]. Three of the four venues used for regional sites, and all four host cities, were Final Four host cities; only The Summit did not host a Final Four (all Final Fours in Houston have been at either the [[Astrodome]] or [[NRG Stadium]]). This also marked the first time that domed stadiums were used in the opening rounds, with Syracuse's Carrier Dome and the Metrodome in Minneapolis hosting games. The Metrodome and the Long Beach Arena were the only new venues this year. While the city of Long Beach itself had not hosted games before, it is part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area which has hosted multiple times. Since 1986, every tournament has included at least one domed stadium, something that had only happened five times beforehand (1971 and 1981\u201384). LSU's Assembly Center, renamed for NCAA career scoring leader and LSU legend [[Pete Maravich]] in 1988, hosted for the third and final time, having previously hosted the Mideast regional semifinals and finals in 1976 and the Mideast regional quarterfinals in 1977.\n\n==Teams==\n{| class=wikitable\n!

It began on March 13, 1986, and ended with the [[1986 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on March 31 in [[Dallas, Texas]]. A total of 63 games were played.\n\n[[1985\u201386 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|Louisville]], coached by [[Denny Crum]], won the national title with a 72\u201369 victory in the final game over [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]], coached by [[Mike Krzyzewski]]. [[Pervis Ellison]] of [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] was named the tournament's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]].  Louisville became the first team from outside a power conference to win the championship since the expansion to 64 teams, and remains one of only two teams to do so (the other team was UNLV in 1990).\n\nThe 1986 NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Tournament was the first tournament to use a [[shot clock]] limiting the amount of time for any one offensive possession by a team prior to taking a shot at the basket.  Beginning with the 1986 tournament, the [[shot clock]] was set at 45 seconds, which it would remain until being shortened to 35 seconds beginning in the [[1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], and further shortened to 30 seconds (the same as NCAA women's basketball) starting with the [[2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]]. The 1986 tournament was also the last to not feature the [[Three-point field goal|three-point shot]].\n\n[[1985\u201386 LSU Tigers basketball team|LSU]]'s 1985\u201386 team is tied for the lowest-seeded team (#11) to ever make the [[Final Four]] with the [[2005\u201306 George Mason Patriots men's basketball team|2005\u201306 George Mason Patriots]], the [[2010\u201311 VCU Rams men's basketball team|2010\u201311 VCU Rams]], and the [[2017-18 Loyola Ramblers men's basketball team|2017-18 Loyola-Chicago Ramblers]]. As of 2018, they are the only team in tournament history to beat the top 3 seeds from their region. LSU began its run to the Final Four by winning two games on its home court, the [[Pete Maravich Assembly Center|LSU Assembly Center]], leading to a change two years later which prohibited teams from playing NCAA tournament games on a court which they have played four or more games in the regular season. [[Cleveland State University]] became the first #14 seed to reach the Sweet Sixteen, losing to their fellow underdog, Navy, by a single point. This was also the first year in which two #14 seeds reached the second round in the same year, as [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock|Arkansas-Little Rock]] beat #3-seed Notre Dame; however, they lost their second-round game in overtime.  Both feats have only occurred one other time. [[University of Tennessee at Chattanooga|Chattanooga]] reached the Sweet Sixteen as a 14-seed in 1997, and [[Old Dominion University|Old Dominion]] and [[Weber State University|Weber State]] both reached the second round as 14-seeds in 1995.\n\nEvery regional final featured a #1 or #2 seed playing a team seeded #6 or lower. The lone #1 seed to not reach the Elite Eight, St. John's (West), was knocked out in the second round by #8 Auburn, which lost to #2 Louisville in the regional final.\n\nIt can be argued that these upsets by the 14-seeds launched the NCAA Tournament's reputation for having unknown teams surprise well-known basketball powers, and both happened on the same day. Indiana's stunning loss would be part of the climax in the best-selling book [[A Season On The Brink]].\n\nAnother story of the tournament was when [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] reached the Elite 8 thanks to stunning performances by [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]]. This tournament had no Pac 10 teams advance beyond the round of 64. This did not occur again until 2018.\n\n==Locations==\n\n{{Location map+|USA|width=450|float=right|caption=1986 first and second rounds|places= \n{{Location map~|USA|mark=green pog.svg|lat_deg=30.458283|lon_deg=-91.140320|position=right|background=#FFFFFF|label=Baton Rouge|link=Pete Maravich Assembly Center|LSU Assembly Center}}\n{{Location map~|USA|mark=green pog.svg|lat_deg=39.758948|lon_deg=-84.191607|position=bottom|background=#FFFFFF|label=Dayton|link=University of Dayton Arena}}\n{{Location map~|USA|mark=green pog.svg|lat_deg=35.227087|lon_deg=-80.843127|position=bottom|background=#FFFFFF|label=Charlotte|link=Bojangles' Coliseum|Charlotte Coliseum}}\n{{Location map~|USA|mark=green pog.svg|lat_deg=43.048122|lon_deg=-76.147424|position=top|background=#FFFFFF|label=Syracuse|link=Carrier Dome}}\n{{Location map~|USA|mark=green pog.svg|lat_deg=36.072635|lon_deg=-79.791975|position=right|background=#FFFFFF|label=Greensboro|link=Greensboro Coliseum}}\n{{Location map~|USA|mark=green pog.svg|lat_deg=44.976154|lon_deg=-93.267431|position=left|background=#FFFFFF|label=Minneapolis|link=Hubert H.

While the city itself has not hosted another Final Four, the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex would host again in 2014 at [[AT&T Stadium]]. Three of the four venues used for regional sites, and all four host cities, were Final Four host cities; only The Summit did not host a Final Four (all Final Fours in Houston have been at either the [[Astrodome]] or [[NRG Stadium]]). This also marked the first time that domed stadiums were used in the opening rounds, with Syracuse's Carrier Dome and the Metrodome in Minneapolis hosting games. The Metrodome and the Long Beach Arena were the only new venues this year. While the city of Long Beach itself had not hosted games before, it is part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area which has hosted multiple times. Since 1986, every tournament has included at least one domed stadium, something that had only happened five times beforehand (1971 and 1981-84). LSU's Assembly Center, renamed for NCAA career scoring leader and LSU legend [[Pete Maravich]] in 1988, hosted for the third and final time, having previously hosted the Mideast regional semifinals and finals in 1976 and the Mideast regional quarterfinals in 1977.\n\n==Teams==\n{| class=wikitable\n!
