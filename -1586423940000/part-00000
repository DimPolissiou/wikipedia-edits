The first phase comprises abstract [[Modernist literature|modernist]] works influenced by writers such as [[Franz Kafka]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]] and [[James Joyce]]. These works examine the capacity of [[language]] to depict [[reality]]; they include the experimental novels ''The Visit'' (''Bes\u00f8get'', 1963) and ''Additions'' (''Tilf\u00f8jelser'', 1967), the \"unnovel\" ''Pictures of Lust'' (''Lystbilleder'', 1964), and the collection of short stories ''Eight Times Orphan'' (''Otte gange orphan'', 1965).\n\nMadsen would later define these novels as \"anti-art\". The change to the next phase of his work was, according to him, a shift from \"anti-art\" to \"anti-anti-art\", which accepted the result of the first phase: \"that reality can not be described\", but that one may attempt to build a meaningful literature from a [[Relativism|relativistic]] stance. The project was now to show how \"lower\" genres (such as [[crime fiction]], [[Romance novel|romantic fiction]] and [[science fiction]]) could be a mosaic of equal truths that make up reality. This change is also a change from modernist literature to [[postmodern literature]].\n\nThe third phase of Madsen's work comprises some novels that are less abstract and more realistic than his earlier works, but are still highly imaginative. At the same time, Madsen started working on a \"macro\"-text in which characters are used repeatedly in different novels, main characters becoming minor characters and vice versa. All of these novels take places in the [[city]] of [[Aarhus]] in Denmark. Through a complex net of bizarre stories, Madsen creates an alternative Aarhus in which everything is possible and extreme philosophical positions are explored. Madsen's late literature is quite unique but can perhaps best be likened to the [[magical realism]] of [[Latin America]].\n\nA recurring trait in his books is that the [[Fictional character|characters]] face some sort of extreme situation which enables a philosophical theme to emerge.\n\nPerhaps Madsen's most famous work is ''Vice and Virtue in the Middle Time'' (''Tugt og utugt i mellemtiden'', 1976) which has been translated into English. In this novel, a man from a very distant future takes on the experiment of writing a novel of the age called Middle Time, which is the western world in the 1970s. This creates an amusing philosophical position, in which everything we take for granted is questioned in the light of a totally different perspective on life. The main [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] is a rewriting of [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]]'s ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', but there are references to many classic novels.\n\n==Bibliography==\nMadsen's books, and some of his plays, have been translated in to a wide array of languages, from Czech and Greek to Latvian, French and Japanese.
