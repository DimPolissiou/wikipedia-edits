The lack of game changing twists was also lauded by fans due to the season having a \"back to basics\" feel to it. \n\n===Controversy and criticism===\n''Big Brother 10'' came under fire from critics such as the [[Parents Television Council]] for airing the word \"fucking\" during the Tuesday, August 5 episode of the show.

Cited in DeLio (1985). p.xii</ref>  This piece is an example of a style of music  called, by Xenakis, [[symbolic music]] \u2013 a style of music which makes use of [[set theory]], [[abstract algebra]], and [[mathematical logic]] in order to create and analyze [[musical composition]]s.  Along with symbolic music, Xenakis  is known for  his development of [[stochastic music]].\n\nDuring his lifetime, Xenakis was a vocal critic of [[Contemporary classical music|modern western music]], since the development of [[polyphony]] for its diminished set of outside-time structures, especially when compared to [[Folk music|folk]] and the [[Byzantine music|Byzantine]] musical traditions.  This perceived incompleteness of western music was the main impetus for the development of symbolic music and for composing Nomos Alpha, his most well known example.\n\n''Nomos Alpha'' consists of 24 sections divided into two layers.  The first layer consists of every section not divisible by four, while the second layer consists of every fourth section.<ref>DeLio, Thomas. \"Iannis Xenakis' ''Nomos Alpha'': The Dialectics of Structure and Materials\", ''Journal of Music Theory'', Vol. 24, No. 1 (Spring, 1980), pp. 63\u201395; Published by: Duke University Press on behalf of the Yale University Department of Music.

The elements of the set are [[permutations]] and the [[binary operator]] is [[Function composition|composition]].\n\n==Layer 2==\nLayer 2 of ''Nomos Alpha''\u2014in contrast to Layer 1\u2014is not determined by [[group theory]], but is instead, a \"continuous motion of registral evolution\".<ref>DeLio.  op. cit.  83</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*DeLio, Thomas, ed.

Japanese company [[Akai]] took over the instrument from Steiner and released several models (with his design help). The current top models, EWI4000S and EWI5000, contain a built-in digital synthesizer and don't require an external box. Akai also offers the EWI USB, a lower-priced model 4-octave that connects directly to a [[macOS|Mac]] or Windows computer and uses software for control.\n\nEWIs use the [[Boehm system|Boehm fingering system]] used by most woodwind instruments, or they can be played with a simpler fingering system very similar to a recorder. The instrument feels somewhat like a [[soprano saxophone]] or clarinet, except that its keys are activated by touch rather than being depressed (i.e. the player's fingers don't rest on the keys).\n\nModern EWIs can be switched to [[flute]], [[oboe]], and [[saxophone]] fingering modes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patchmanmusic.com/ewiusb |title=Akai EWI USB EWI-USB MIDI Wind Controller at Patchman Music |publisher=Patchmanmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref> The EWI4000s and EWI USB also have a special EVI (acronym for '''Electronic Valve Instrument''') fingering mode that allows brass players to play the EWI.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patchmanmusic.com/akaiEWI4000sEVIFingering.html |title=Akai EWI-4000s and EWI-USB EVI Fingering Mode |publisher=Patchmanmusic.com |date=2010-05-20 |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref> Like a straight soprano saxophone or clarinet, the EWI is straight with a slight inward bend a few inches below the mouthpiece, and it is held in front of the body with a neck strap.  As of 2017, current models are the EWI4000s, EWI5000, and EWI USB.\n\nThe EWI has a silicone [[Mouthpiece (woodwind)|mouthpiece]] with sensors for air pressure (sending MIDI Breath Control by default) and bite pressure (which sends [[vibrato]], more specifically a quick pitch up-down \"blip\" by default). Because the EWI [[Key (instrument)|keys]] do not move (instead, they sense when fingers are touching them by [[body capacitance]], much like an elevator button works), the instrument is very agile. It also requires substantially less breath control than an acoustic instrument; breath sensitivity is one of the parameters that can be adjusted to the player's preference.\n\nUnlike acoustic wind instruments, the fingering is identical in every [[octave]]. The current octave is determined by putting your left thumb between any two of the eight rollers. Touching a plate next to the rollers sends [[portamento]] by default. There are also pitchbend up and down plates, operated by the right thumb.\n\nEWI models can control external synthesizers or other MIDI instruments, either simultaneously or instead of the synthesizers that come with the instrument. Earlier EWIs require the external box unit, while the EWI4000S and EWI5000 have built-in [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] outputs. The EWI USB has only a USB connector. Any EWI can play software synthesizers running on a computer.
