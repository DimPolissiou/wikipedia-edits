The search leads Bond to the [[Bahamas]], where he encounters [[Emilio Largo]], the card-playing, eye patch-wearing SPECTRE Number Two. Backed by [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent [[Felix Leiter]] and Largo's mistress, [[Domino Vitali|Domino Derval]], Bond's search culminates in an underwater battle with Largo's henchmen.

In 1983, [[Warner Bros.]] released a second film adaptation of the novel under the title ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', with McClory as executive producer.\n\n==Plot==\nJames Bond attends the funeral of Colonel Jacques Bouvar, a [[SPECTRE]] operative connected with the previous murders of two MI6 agents.<ref name = \"Bouvar\">The name is often misspelled: it is spelled '''Bouvar''' on Thunderball Ultimate Edition DVD Region 2. See Disc One, English subtitles for the film, and Disc Two under \"007 Mission Control / Villains / Jacques Bouvar\"</ref> Bouvar is alive and disguised as his own widow, but Bond identifies him. Pursuing Bouvar to his ch\u00e2teau, Bond fights and kills him, escaping with use of a [[jetpack]] and his [[Aston Martin DB5]].\n\nAt a SPECTRE meeting in Paris, chaired by the enigmatic [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld|Number One]], [[Emilio Largo]] (SPECTRE operative Number Two) introduces the group's latest project: hijacking two [[Nuclear weapons|atomic bomb]]s and holding [[NATO]] for ransom. The plot begins at Shrublands sanatorium, located close to a NATO air base. Coincidentally, James Bond is at Shrublands to improve his health. There, he notices that fellow patient Count Lippe has a [[Tong (organization)|Tong]] tattoo. Bond searches Lippe's room, and is seen leaving by the man in the adjoining room, whose head is covered in bandages. Lippe tries to murder Bond with a [[traction (orthopedics)|spinal traction]] machine, but Bond is saved by his physiotherapist, Patricia Fearing.\n\nLippe and Angelo Palazzi, the bandaged man, are part of SPECTRE's plot. Angelo's face has been [[plastic surgery|surgically altered]] to match [[French Air Force]] pilot Fran\u00e7ois Derval, who is also staying at Shrublands. Derval is slated to fly on a training mission aboard an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Avro Vulcan]] strategic jet bomber loaded with two atomic bombs. Angelo kills Derval, collects $100,000 from SPECTRE Agent Fiona Volpe, then demands an extra $150,000 for the job. Fiona seemingly acquiesces. The next morning, Angelo takes Derval's place on the flight. Angelo gasses the rest of the crew, then flies the Vulcan to the [[Bahamas]], landing it in shallow water near Largo's ship, the ''[[Disco Volante (ship)|Disco Volante]]''. SPECTRE [[Scuba diving|scuba divers]], commanded by Largo, retrieve the atomic bombs. Angelo, trapped by his seat strapping, is left to drown by Largo for reneging on his original deal with SPECTRE.\n\nMeanwhile, Bond has uncovered Derval's corpse at the clinic. On the way to London, Lippe attacks Bond, but a masked motorcyclist kills Lippe with a rocket-propelled grenade and zooms off. Abandoning the motorcycle and unmasking, the rider is revealed to be Fiona, acting on Blofeld's orders to eliminate Lippe for hiring the greedy Angelo.\n\nAt an MI6 conference in London, all of the 00 agents are informed that SPECTRE demands \u00a3100 million from NATO in exchange for returning the bombs, and threatens to destroy a major city in the [[United States]] or the [[United Kingdom]] if the ransom is not paid within seven days. Bond recognises the briefing photograph of Derval as the corpse at Shrublands. He asks M to send him to [[Nassau, Bahamas]], to contact Derval's sister, [[Domino Vitali|Domino]].\n\nWhile snorkeling, Bond meets Domino. Later, at a casino, he encounters Largo and Domino, who is his mistress. Bond enters a game against Largo and wins, and subsequently takes Domino to a dance. Bond and Largo recognise each other as adversaries and begin a tense cat-and-mouse game while still pretending ignorance of each other's true nature. Bond meets [[Felix Leiter]] and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], and is issued various gadgets, including an underwater infrared camera, a distress beacon, underwater breathing apparatus, a flare gun, and a [[Geiger counter]]. Diving under the ''Disco Volante'', Bond fails to find the atomic bombs, but detects an underwater hatch; Bond narrowly escapes Largo's henchmen. The next day, Bond visits Largo at his estate, Palmyra. Bond's partner, Paula Caplan, is taken to Palmyra and then commits suicide with a cyanide pill rather than give any information.\n\nBond is kidnapped by Volpe, but escapes through a [[Junkanoo]] celebration to the Kiss Kiss club, where Volpe is accidentally shot and killed by her own bodyguard. Bond and Felix search for the Vulcan, finding it underwater and inside a camouflaged cargo net. Bond tells Domino that Largo killed her brother and asks her for help in finding the bombs, giving her the Geiger counter. As she searches for the bombs on the ship, she is caught and tortured by Largo.\n\nMeanwhile, Bond disguises himself as one of Largo's henchmen, and uncovers Largo's plan to destroy [[Miami Beach]]. Bond is discovered and trapped by Largo, but rescued by Leiter in a [[United States Coast Guard]] helicopter, allowing him to alert the authorities of Largo's plan. [[U.S. Navy]] [[frogmen]] parachute into the area from a [[US Air Force]] transport aircraft, with Bond joining them, and after an underwater battle, Largo's divers surrender. Largo escapes to the ''Disco Volante'', which has one of the bombs on board. As it begins to leave, Bond gets on an underwater fin, and [[Royal Navy]] and U.S. Coast Guard vessels pursue the ''Disco Volante''. Largo has the ship start creating a smoke cloud, and when the Royal Navy and U.S. vessels start to close in, he has the rear of the ship jettisoned, revealing the front to be a [[hydrofoil]], which escapes at high speed. Bond climbs into the ship's bridge, where he battles Largo and two crewmen while controlling the ship as it weaves erratically among rocks and reefs. Meanwhile, Largo's hired nuclear physicist Kutze frees Domino. Largo is just about to shoot Bond when Domino shoots and kills Largo with a harpoon gun. Bond, Domino, and Kutze jump overboard before the ship runs aground and explodes. A [[Fulton surface-to-air recovery system|sky hook]]-equipped CIA [[B-17]] aircraft then rescues Bond and Domino.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]]: An MI6 agent assigned to retrieve two stolen nuclear weapons\n<!-- title cards -->\n* [[Claudine Auger]] as Domino (voice dubbed by [[Nikki van der Zyl]]):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkivanderzyl.co.uk/bond/|title=Film Industry Tricks OR How to fool most of the people most of the time!|publisher=Official Nikki van der Zyl website|author=George A.

Eventually, former [[Miss France]] [[Claudine Auger]] was cast, and the script was rewritten to make her character French rather than Italian, although her lines were dubbed in the final cut by [[Nikki van der Zyl]], who had voiced several previous Bond girls. Nevertheless, director Young cast her once again in his next film, ''[[Triple Cross (1966 film)|Triple Cross]]'' (1966).

Filming then moved to the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Anet]], near [[Dreux]], France, for the fight in precredit sequence. Much of the film was shot in the Bahamas; ''Thunderball'' is widely known for its extensive underwater action scenes which are played out through much of the latter half of the film.

The most difficult sequences to film were the underwater action scenes; the first to be shot underwater was at a depth of 50 feet to shoot the scene where SPECTRE divers remove the atomic bombs from the sunken Vulcan bomber. [[Peter Lamont]] had previously visited a Royal Air Force bomber station carrying a concealed camera which he used to get close-up shots of secret missiles (those appearing in the film were not actually present).<ref name=\"making of\" /> Most of the underwater scenes had to be done at lower tides due to the sharks on the Bahamian coast.<ref>{{cite AV media  |title = Commentary 1: Thunderball Ultimate Edition, Region 2 }}</ref>\n\nAfter he read the script, Connery realised the risk of the sequence with the sharks in Largo's pool and insisted that production designer [[Ken Adam]] build a [[Plexiglas]] partition inside the pool. The barrier was not a fixed structure, so when one of the sharks managed to pass through it, Connery fled the pool, seconds away from attack.<ref name=\"ttp\"/> Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'',\n\n<blockquote>We had to use special effects, but unlike special effects today, they were real. The jet pack we used in ''Thunderball'' was real - it was invented for the United States Army. Bloody dangerous, and it only lasted a couple of minutes. The ejector seat in the Aston Martin was real and Emilio Largo's boat, the ''Disco Volante'', was real. You had power boats at that time, but there were no good-sized yachts that were able to travel at 40 to 50 knots, so it was quite a problem. But by combining a hydrofoil, which we bought in Puerto Rico for $10,000, and a catamaran, it at least looked like a big yacht. We combined the two hulls with a one-inch slip bolt and when they split it worked like a dream. We used lots of sharks for this movie. I'd rented a villa in the Bahamas with a saltwater pool which we filled with sharks and used for underwater filming. The smell was horrendous. This was where Sean Connery came close to being bitten. We had a plexiglass corridor to protect him, but I didn't have quite enough plexiglass and one of the sharks got through.

[[Voit]] provided much of the underwater gear in exchange for [[product placement]] and film [[tie-in]] merchandise. Lamar Boren, an underwater photographer, was hired to shoot all of the sequences. [[United States Air Force]] Lieutenant Colonel [[Charles Russhon]], who had already established Eon productions' rapports with the local authorities in Turkey for ''From Russia with Love'' (1963) and at [[Fort Knox]] for ''Goldfinger'' (1964), supplied the experimental rocket fuel used to destroy the ''Disco Volante''.

The search leads Bond to the [[Bahamas]], where he encounters [[Emilio Largo]], the card-playing, eye patch-wearing SPECTRE Number Two. Backed by [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent [[Felix Leiter]] and Largo's mistress, [[Domino Vitali|Domino Derval]], Bond's search culminates in an underwater battle with Largo's henchmen.

In 1983, [[Warner Bros.]] released a second film adaptation of the novel under the title ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', with McClory as executive producer.\n\n==Plot==\nJames Bond attends the funeral of Colonel Jacques Bouvar, a [[SPECTRE]] operative connected with the previous murders of two MI6 agents.<ref name = \"Bouvar\">The name is often misspelled: it is spelled '''Bouvar''' on Thunderball Ultimate Edition DVD Region 2. See Disc One, English subtitles for the film, and Disc Two under \"007 Mission Control / Villains / Jacques Bouvar\"</ref> Bouvar is alive and disguised as his own widow, but Bond identifies him. Pursuing Bouvar to his ch\u00e2teau, Bond fights and kills him, escaping with use of a [[jetpack]] and his [[Aston Martin DB5]].\n\nAt a SPECTRE meeting in Paris, chaired by the enigmatic [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld|Number One]], [[Emilio Largo]] (SPECTRE operative Number Two) introduces the group's latest project: hijacking two [[Nuclear weapons|atomic bomb]]s and holding [[NATO]] for ransom. The plot begins at Shrublands sanatorium, located close to a NATO air base. Coincidentally, James Bond is at Shrublands to improve his health. There, he notices that fellow patient Count Lippe has a [[Tong (organization)|Tong]] tattoo. Bond searches Lippe's room, and is seen leaving by the man in the adjoining room, whose head is covered in bandages. Lippe tries to murder Bond with a [[traction (orthopedics)|spinal traction]] machine, but Bond is saved by his physiotherapist, Patricia Fearing.\n\nLippe and Angelo Palazzi, the bandaged man, are part of SPECTRE's plot. Angelo's face has been [[plastic surgery|surgically altered]] to match [[French Air Force]] pilot Fran\u00e7ois Derval, who is also staying at Shrublands. Derval is slated to fly on a training mission aboard an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Avro Vulcan]] strategic jet bomber loaded with two atomic bombs. Angelo kills Derval, collects $100,000 from SPECTRE Agent Fiona Volpe, then demands an extra $150,000 for the job. Fiona seemingly acquiesces. The next morning, Angelo takes Derval's place on the flight. Angelo gasses the rest of the crew, then flies the Vulcan to the [[Bahamas]], landing it in shallow water near Largo's ship, the ''[[Disco Volante (ship)|Disco Volante]]''. SPECTRE [[Scuba diving|scuba divers]], commanded by Largo, retrieve the atomic bombs. Angelo, trapped by his seat strapping, is left to drown by Largo for reneging on his original deal with SPECTRE.\n\nMeanwhile, Bond has uncovered Derval's corpse at the clinic. On the way to London, Lippe attacks Bond, but a masked motorcyclist kills Lippe with a rocket-propelled grenade and zooms off. Abandoning the motorcycle and unmasking, the rider is revealed to be Fiona, acting on Blofeld's orders to eliminate Lippe for hiring the greedy Angelo.\n\nAt an MI6 conference in London, all of the 00 agents are informed that SPECTRE demands \u00a3100 million from NATO in exchange for returning the bombs, and threatens to destroy a major city in the [[United States]] or the [[United Kingdom]] if the ransom is not paid within seven days. Bond recognises the briefing photograph of Derval as the corpse at Shrublands. He asks M to send him to [[Nassau, Bahamas]], to contact Derval's sister, [[Domino Vitali|Domino]].\n\nWhile snorkeling, Bond meets Domino. Later, at a casino, he encounters Largo and Domino, who is his mistress. Bond enters a game against Largo and wins, and subsequently takes Domino to a dance. Bond and Largo recognise each other as adversaries and begin a tense cat-and-mouse game while still pretending ignorance of each other's true nature. Bond meets [[Felix Leiter]] and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], and is issued various gadgets, including an underwater infrared camera, a distress beacon, underwater breathing apparatus, a flare gun, and a [[Geiger counter]]. Diving under the ''Disco Volante'', Bond fails to find the atomic bombs, but detects an underwater hatch; Bond narrowly escapes Largo's henchmen. The next day, Bond visits Largo at his estate, Palmyra. Bond's partner, Paula Caplan, is taken to Palmyra and then commits suicide with a cyanide pill rather than give any information.\n\nBond is kidnapped by Volpe, but escapes through a [[Junkanoo]] celebration to the Kiss Kiss club, where Volpe is accidentally shot and killed by her own bodyguard. Bond and Felix search for the Vulcan, finding it underwater and inside a camouflaged cargo net. Bond tells Domino that Largo killed her brother and asks her for help in finding the bombs, giving her the Geiger counter. As she searches for the bombs on the ship, she is caught and tortured by Largo.\n\nMeanwhile, Bond disguises himself as one of Largo's henchmen, and uncovers Largo's plan to destroy [[Miami Beach]]. Bond is discovered and trapped by Largo, but rescued by Leiter in a [[United States Coast Guard]] helicopter, allowing him to alert the authorities of Largo's plan. [[U.S. Navy]] [[frogmen]] parachute into the area from a [[US Air Force]] transport aircraft, with Bond joining them, and after an underwater battle, Largo's divers surrender. Largo escapes to the ''Disco Volante'', which has one of the bombs on board. As it begins to leave, Bond gets on an underwater fin, and [[Royal Navy]] and U.S. Coast Guard vessels pursue the ''Disco Volante''. Largo has the ship start creating a smoke cloud, and when the Royal Navy and U.S. vessels start to close in, he has the rear of the ship jettisoned, revealing the front to be a [[hydrofoil]], which escapes at high speed. Bond climbs into the ship's bridge, where he battles Largo and two crewmen while controlling the ship as it weaves erratically among rocks and reefs. Meanwhile, Largo's hired nuclear physicist Kutze frees Domino. Largo is just about to shoot Bond when Domino shoots and kills Largo with a harpoon gun. Bond, Domino, and Kutze jump overboard before the ship runs aground and explodes. A [[Fulton surface-to-air recovery system|sky hook]]-equipped CIA [[B-17]] aircraft then rescues Bond and Domino.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]]: An MI6 agent assigned to retrieve two stolen nuclear weapons\n<!-- title cards -->\n* [[Claudine Auger]] as Domino (voice dubbed by [[Nikki van der Zyl]]):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkivanderzyl.co.uk/bond/|title=Film Industry Tricks OR How to fool most of the people most of the time!|publisher=Official Nikki van der Zyl website|author=George A.

[[Peter Lamont]] had previously visited a Royal Air Force bomber station carrying a concealed camera which he used to get close-up shots of secret missiles (those appearing in the film were not actually present).<ref name=\"making of\" /> Most of the underwater scenes had to be done at lower tides due to the sharks on the Bahamian coast.<ref>{{cite AV media  |title = Commentary 1: Thunderball Ultimate Edition, Region 2 }}</ref>\n\nAfter he read the script, Connery realised the risk of the sequence with the sharks in Largo's pool and insisted that production designer [[Ken Adam]] build a [[Plexiglas]] partition inside the pool. The barrier was not a fixed structure, so when one of the sharks managed to pass through it, Connery fled the pool, seconds away from attack.<ref name=\"ttp\"/> Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'',\n\n<blockquote>We had to use special effects, but unlike special effects today, they were real. The jet pack we used in ''Thunderball'' was real - it was invented for the United States Army. Bloody dangerous, and it only lasted a couple of minutes. The ejector seat in the Aston Martin was real and Emilio Largo's boat, the ''Disco Volante'', was real. You had power boats at that time, but there were no good-sized yachts that were able to travel at 40 to 50 knots, so it was quite a problem. But by combining a hydrofoil, which we bought in Puerto Rico for $10,000, and a catamaran, it at least looked like a big yacht. We combined the two hulls with a one-inch slip bolt and when they split it worked like a dream. We used lots of sharks for this movie. I'd rented a villa in the Bahamas with a saltwater pool which we filled with sharks and used for underwater filming. The smell was horrendous. This was where Sean Connery came close to being bitten. We had a plexiglass corridor to protect him, but I didn't have quite enough plexiglass and one of the sharks got through. He never got out of a pool faster in his life - he was walking on water.<ref>{{cite news |last= Dee |first= Johnny |title= Licensed to drill |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/sep/17/culture.features |date= 17 September 2005 |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location= London |accessdate= 10 March 2016 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160310085950/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/sep/17/culture.features |archivedate= 10 March 2016 |df= dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen special-effects coordinator [[John Stears]] provided a supposedly dead shark to be towed around the pool, the shark, which was still alive, revived at one point.

He was responsible for the staging of the cave sequence and the battle scenes beneath the ''Disco Volante'' and called in his specialist team of divers who posed as those engaged in the onslaught. [[Voit]] provided much of the underwater gear in exchange for [[product placement]] and film [[tie-in]] merchandise. Lamar Boren, an underwater photographer, was hired to shoot all of the sequences. [[United States Air Force]] Lieutenant Colonel [[Charles Russhon]], who had already established Eon productions' rapports with the local authorities in Turkey for ''From Russia with Love'' (1963) and at [[Fort Knox]] for ''Goldfinger'' (1964), supplied the experimental rocket fuel used to destroy the ''Disco Volante''.

Connery refused to speak to journalists and photographers who followed him in Nassau, stating his frustration with the harassment that came with the role; \"I find that fame tends to turn one from an actor and a human being into a piece of merchandise, a public institution.

At ''Thunderball'''s release, there was confusion as to whether a [[rebreather]] such as the one that appears in the film existed; most Bond gadgets, while implausible, often are based upon real technology. In the real world, a rebreather could not be so small, as it has no room for the [[breathing bag]], while the alternative [[Open-circuit scuba|open-circuit]] scuba releases exhalation bubbles, which the film device does not.

As ''Thunderball'' was the first James Bond film shot in [[Panavision]], Binder had to reshoot the iconic gun barrel scene which permitted him to not only incorporate pinhole photographic techniques to shoot inside a genuine gun barrel, but also made Connery appearing in the sequence for the first time a reality, as stunt man [[Bob Simmons (stunt man)|Bob Simmons]] had doubled for him in the three previous films.
