The firm had previously constructed the [[Students' Society of McGill University|University Centre]] on campus, and is known for having designed many important buildings in Montreal, such as [[Place Bonaventure]] (1964-1967) and [[Place Ville-Marie]] (1958-1964).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/building/place-ville-marie/2036|title=Place Ville Marie|publisher=The Skyscraper Center|accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> \n[[File:Queen Elizabeth Theatre Vancouver View of Lobby.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the [[Queen Elizabeth Theatre]], designed by [[Arcop]] in 1959, looks strikingly similar to the interior of the Leacock Building.]]\nThe area chosen for the new building was the site of the McGill Observatory and half of the [[The Presbyterian College, Montreal|Presbyterian College]], which today is Morrice Hall, which houses the [[McGill University Institute of Islamic Studies]] and [[Islamic Studies Library]]. Originally, the Leacock Building was intended to have two towers, but the second tower was never built, for it was deemed unnecessary and would have required the demolition of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] Morrice Hall.<ref name=History />\n\n==Layout==\nThe Leacock Building is ten storeys tall, and currently houses parts of the Departments of Humanities, Social Sciences and Islamic Studies at McGill. The first three floors contain twenty-four lecture rooms ranging from 30 seats to 200 in capacity. The first floor also contains the largest lecture hall at McGill, called Leacock-132, which can seat up to 650 students at once.<ref name=Virtual /> The large auditorium has no windows in order to provide fewer distractions, and is half underground with its seats sloping in the same direction as the natural hillside. The lecture halls were specifically designed to be on the lower floors so that they would be easily accessible to students, and would also lower the amount of traffic to the upper floors, which contain 125 offices served by elevators. While the lower floors are quite open in plan, the upper floors follow a traditional race-track layout.\n\nDue to Leacock's unique position of being banked into the hillside, it can be accessed from three different levels, either from the first floor at street level facing [[Redpath Museum]], the second floor terrace to the south, facing Morrice Hall, or the third floor terrace to the west from [[McTavish Street]].<ref name=Map /> It can also be entered directly from the Arts Building from the east through a two-storey glass-walled corridor.<ref name=Virtual />\n\n==Architecture==\nLeacock is a [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] structure comprising [[precast concrete|precast]] load-bearing concrete panels on the exterior, each containing a sealed window.<ref name=History /> Three different moldings are used for the panels, with the one containing the largest opening used for the central [[bay windows]] on the north and south facades, the next largest on either side of those bay openings, and the smallest on the east and west facades. Concrete pillars with hexagonal horizontal sections support the structure above the first two storeys, which unlike the upper floors contain walls made almost entirely of glass. These walls allow a great deal of natural light into the lower floors where students gather to attend lectures. One of the core ideas of [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalism]] was to produce a rich individual user experience while creating a sense of equality and spatial democracy. The use of precast concrete panels containing sealed windows was the manifestation of these ideas, as their repetitiveness and identicality erase any kind of spatial hierarchy.

He achieved notability in the London gay scene during the 1980s with his drag queen character '''Lily Savage''', with which he went mainstream in the 1990s. He subsequently dropped the character and in the 2000s became the presenter of a range of television and radio shows, most notably ''[[The Paul O'Grady Show]]''.\n\n<!--Early life and career as Lily Savage-->\nBorn to a working-class Irish family in [[Tranmere, Merseyside|Tranmere, Cheshire]], O'Grady moved to London in the late 1970s, initially working as a peripatetic care officer for [[Camden London Borough Council|Camden Council]]. It was here in 1978 that he developed his drag act, basing the character of Lily Savage upon traits found amongst female relatives. Touring northern England as part of drag mime duo, the Playgirls, he eventually went solo as a stand-up comedian. Performing as Savage for eight years at a South London gay pub, the [[Royal Vauxhall Tavern]] (RVT), he gained a popular following among the city's gay community and used his character to speak out for [[LGBT rights]]. After being nominated for a 1992 [[Edinburgh Comedy Awards|Perrier Award]], he attracted mainstream attention and made various television, radio, and theatrical appearances. As Savage, he presented morning chat show ''[[The Big Breakfast]]'' (1995\u201396), game show ''[[Blankety Blank]]'' (1997\u20132002), and comedy series ''[[Lily Live!]]'' (2000\u201301), earning various awards and becoming a well known public figure.\n\n<!--Later life and chat show dominance-->\nSeeking to diversify his career away from Savage, O'Grady starred in BBC sitcom ''[[Eyes Down]]'' (2003\u201304) and presented two travel documentaries for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. In 2004, he began presenting ITV's daytime chat show ''The Paul O'Grady Show'', which proved a hit with audiences. After the network refused to transfer creative control of the series to O'Grady's production company, [[Olga TV]], in 2006 he defected to rival [[Channel 4]], where the show was rebranded as ''The New Paul O'Grady Show'' and ran until 2009. O'Grady subsequently presented a late night ITV show, ''[[Paul O'Grady Live]]'' (2010\u201311) as well as ''[[Paul O'Grady: For the Love of Dogs]]'' (2012\u2013present) and ''[[Paul O'Grady's Animal Orphans]]'' (2014\u20132016), while presenting [[BBC Radio 2]]'s ''[[Paul O'Grady on the Wireless]]'' and publishing a four-volume autobiography.\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nO'Grady has received a variety of awards, among them honorary degrees and an [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in the [[2008 Birthday Honours]] for services to entertainment.\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood: 1955\u20131971===\nO'Grady was born Paul James Grady at 7:30&nbsp;am on 14 June 1955 at St. Catherine's Hospital in [[Tranmere, Merseyside|Tranmere, Cheshire]] (now in [[Merseyside]]).{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2008|1p=1|2a1=O'Grady|2y=2008|2p=5}} His father, Patrick \"Paddy\" Grady (died 1973),<ref name=\"monster\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/ogradys-monster-1578781.html |title=O'Grady's monster |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=22 October 1995 |accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref> was Irish and had grown up on a farm in Ballincurry, [[County Roscommon]], before moving to England in 1936 in search of work and settling down in the working-class area of [[Birkenhead|Birkenhead, Cheshire]], of which Tranmere is a suburb.

He achieved notability in the London gay scene during the 1980s with his drag queen character '''Lily Savage''', with which he went mainstream in the 1990s. He subsequently dropped the character and in the 2000s became the presenter of a range of television and radio shows, most notably ''[[The Paul O'Grady Show]]''.\n\n<!--Early life and career as Lily Savage-->\nBorn to a working-class Irish family in [[Tranmere, Merseyside|Tranmere, Cheshire]], O'Grady moved to London in the late 1970s, initially working as a peripatetic care officer for [[Camden London Borough Council|Camden Council]]. It was here in 1978 that he developed his drag act, basing the character of Lily Savage upon traits found amongst female relatives. Touring northern England as part of drag mime duo, the Playgirls, he eventually went solo as a stand-up comedian. Performing as Savage for eight years at a South London gay pub, the [[Royal Vauxhall Tavern]] (RVT), he gained a popular following among the city's gay community and used his character to speak out for [[LGBT rights]]. After being nominated for a 1992 [[Edinburgh Comedy Awards|Perrier Award]], he attracted mainstream attention and made various television, radio, and theatrical appearances. As Savage, he presented morning chat show ''[[The Big Breakfast]]'' (1995\u201396), game show ''[[Blankety Blank]]'' (1997\u20132002), and comedy series ''[[Lily Live!]]'' (2000\u201301), earning various awards and becoming a well known public figure.\n\n<!--Later life and chat show dominance-->\nSeeking to diversify his career away from Savage, O'Grady starred in BBC sitcom ''[[Eyes Down]]'' (2003\u201304) and presented two travel documentaries for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. In 2004, he began presenting ITV's daytime chat show ''The Paul O'Grady Show'', which proved a hit with audiences. After the network refused to transfer creative control of the series to O'Grady's production company, [[Olga TV]], in 2006 he defected to rival [[Channel 4]], where the show was rebranded as ''The New Paul O'Grady Show'' and ran until 2009. O'Grady subsequently presented a late night ITV show, ''[[Paul O'Grady Live]]'' (2010\u201311) as well as ''[[Paul O'Grady: For the Love of Dogs]]'' (2012\u2013present) and ''[[Paul O'Grady's Animal Orphans]]'' (2014\u20132016), while presenting [[BBC Radio 2]]'s ''[[Paul O'Grady on the Wireless]]'' and publishing a four-volume autobiography.\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nO'Grady has received a variety of awards, among them honorary degrees and an [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in the [[2008 Birthday Honours]] for services to entertainment.\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood: 1955\u20131971===\nO'Grady was born Paul James Grady at 7:30&nbsp;am on 14 June 1955 at St. Catherine's Hospital in [[Tranmere, Merseyside|Tranmere, Cheshire]] (now in [[Merseyside]]).{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2008|1p=1|2a1=O'Grady|2y=2008|2p=5}} His father, Patrick \"Paddy\" Grady (died 1973),<ref name=\"monster\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/ogradys-monster-1578781.html |title=O'Grady's monster |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=22 October 1995 |accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref> was Irish and had grown up on a farm in Ballincurry, [[County Roscommon]], before moving to England in 1936 in search of work and settling down in the working-class area of [[Birkenhead|Birkenhead, Cheshire]], of which Tranmere is a suburb.
