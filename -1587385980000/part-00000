After an impressive season with a record breaking Consett side he was signed for nearby giants [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] where he made 25 appearances.\n\nNoble signed for [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] from Newcastle United in January 1968 for \u00a38,000 and made his debut as a substitute in a 3\u20130 win over [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] at the beginning of February.\n\nIn the following season he scored 16 league goals and was the club's top scorer, but his main contribution was to the successful [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] campaign. He played in every match en route to the [[Football League Cup Final 1969|Final]]. Noble scored four goals, including the extra time winner in the semi-final replay versus [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].<ref name=\"beat\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thisisstfc.co.uk/club_heroes69_Story.asp?NewsID=3 |title=How we beat the Gunners |accessdate=2007-01-15 |publisher=[[Swindon Advertiser]] |year=1999 |work=Heroes of 69 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619060351/http://www.thisisstfc.co.uk/club_heroes69_Story.asp?NewsID=3 |archivedate=19 June 2006 }}</ref> He only discovered five years later that he had suffered a broken shoulder blade in that game.<ref name=\"where\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thisisstfc.co.uk/club_heroes69_Story.asp?NewsID=6 |title=Town heroes 30 years on |accessdate=2007-01-15 |publisher=Swindon Advertiser |year=1999 |work=Heroes of 69 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619060428/http://www.thisisstfc.co.uk/club_heroes69_Story.asp?NewsID=6 |archivedate=19 June 2006 }}</ref>\nIn the final Swindon beat First Division giants Arsenal 3\u20131 in a great giant killing feat.\n\nHe was the club's top scorer again in 1969/1970 with 12 goals and once more in 1971/1972, with 14. He also scored in both the 1969 [[Anglo-Italian League Cup]] Final and the [[1970 Anglo-Italian Cup]] Final where he lined up against Roma and [[Fabio Capello]]. (The Italian later stated that the experience of playing and losing to Swindon led to his enduring respect for the English game and the beginning of a long term ambition to manage the English national side). Noble left Swindon at the end of the 1972/1973 season, when Burnley paid \u00a335,000 for his services.\n\nBurnley originally played him in the fullback position<ref name=\"where\"/> before eventually moving him up into midfield, and he became their top scorer for three of the following four seasons. He also became the team's penalty taker.<ref name=\"where\"/> Noble was a favourite with the Turf Moor supporters with his commitment, drive and goal scoring. Noble scored 63 goals in 243 appearances and was club captain for much of his seven-year stay at the club.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 1980, he moved to Blackpool where he continued a partnership with another ex-Burnley player, [[Paul Fletcher (footballer)|Paul Fletcher]].

After an impressive season with a record breaking Consett side he was signed for nearby giants [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] where he made 25 appearances.\n\nNoble signed for [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] from Newcastle United in January 1968 for \u00a38,000 and made his debut as a substitute in a 3\u20130 win over [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] at the beginning of February.\n\nIn the following season he scored 16 league goals and was the club's top scorer, but his main contribution was to the successful [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] campaign. He played in every match en route to the [[Football League Cup Final 1969|Final]]. Noble scored four goals, including the extra time winner in the semi-final replay versus [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].<ref name=\"beat\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thisisstfc.co.uk/club_heroes69_Story.asp?NewsID=3 |title=How we beat the Gunners |accessdate=2007-01-15 |publisher=[[Swindon Advertiser]] |year=1999 |work=Heroes of 69 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619060351/http://www.thisisstfc.co.uk/club_heroes69_Story.asp?NewsID=3 |archivedate=19 June 2006 }}</ref> He only discovered five years later that he had suffered a broken shoulder blade in that game.<ref name=\"where\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thisisstfc.co.uk/club_heroes69_Story.asp?NewsID=6 |title=Town heroes 30 years on |accessdate=2007-01-15 |publisher=Swindon Advertiser |year=1999 |work=Heroes of 69 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619060428/http://www.thisisstfc.co.uk/club_heroes69_Story.asp?NewsID=6 |archivedate=19 June 2006 }}</ref>\nIn the final Swindon beat First Division giants Arsenal 3\u20131 in a great giant killing feat.\n\nHe was the club's top scorer again in 1969/1970 with 12 goals and once more in 1971/1972, with 14. He also scored in both the 1969 [[Anglo-Italian League Cup]] Final and the [[1970 Anglo-Italian Cup]] Final where he lined up against Roma and [[Fabio Capello]]. (The Italian later stated that the experience of playing and losing to Swindon led to his enduring respect for the English game and the beginning of a long term ambition to manage the English national side). Noble left Swindon at the end of the 1972/1973 season, when Burnley paid \u00a335,000 for his services.\n\nBurnley originally played him in the fullback position<ref name=\"where\"/> before eventually moving him up into midfield, and he became their top scorer for three of the following four seasons. He also became the team's penalty taker.<ref name=\"where\"/> Noble was a favourite with the Turf Moor supporters with his commitment, drive and goal scoring. Noble scored 63 goals in 243 appearances and was club captain for much of his seven-year stay at the club.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 1980, he moved to Blackpool where he continued a partnership with another ex-Burnley player, [[Paul Fletcher (footballer)|Paul Fletcher]].

Having learned his lesson from the previous Senate race, Johnson held back on announcing his vote tallies and with the help of some friendly political machines eked out an 87-vote victory for which he was dubbed \"Landslide Lyndon.\"|website=US Senate|accessdate=5 October 2019}}</ref> produced the fraudulent votes needed for Johnson to have a numerical majority, in effect stealing the election. After years of desultory opposition to Democrats during the post-Reconstruction years of the [[Solid South]], Republicans vigorously contested the race by nominating businessman and party activist [[Homa J. Porter|Jack Porter]], who waged an aggressive campaign.  Johnson won his first term in the Senate, but by a closer margin than usual for Texas Democrats.\n\n==Background==\nLike other Southern states in the period between Reconstruction and the 1960s, Texas was a one party state, with the white population solidly voting Democratic as a legacy of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.596</ref> Disputes within the Texas Democratic Party were far more important than disputes between Democrats and Republicans. Starting with the 1944 election, the Democratic Party had been split between the Texas Loyalists who supported the administrations of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman and the [[Texas Regulars]] who were opposed.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\"/> Though the Texas Regulars had officially disbanded after the 1944 election, the split remained. Stevenson, a former governor of Texas had supported the Texas Regulars in 1944, and in 1948 flirted with supporting the [[Dixiecrat]] candidacy of South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.597</ref> Johnson by contrast was a member of the Texas Loyalist faction.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\"/> The acrimonious split in the Texas Democrats ensured an unusually bitter primary battle between Johnson and Stevenson.<ref>Baum & Haily 1994 p.596-597</ref>\n\nThe area around the Rio Grande valley was popularly known in Texas as \"the Valley\"; in a political sense the Valley also included several counties to the north.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181</ref> The majority of the people in the Valley were Chicanos (Mexican Americans), and the Valley was often described as feeling more like Mexico than the United States as Spanish was more widely spoken than English, the culture was predominantly Mexican and the majority of the houses were built in the same style as those found just across the border in Mexico.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181-182</ref> The Valley had the lowest literacy rate in the entire United States with the majority of its people being unable to read and write in Spanish, let alone English.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\">Caro 1990 p. 182</ref> The dominant element in the Valley were Anglos (white Texans- in Texas, the term '{{linktext|Anglo}}' did not necessarily imply English ancestry).<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Anglos tended to be ranch owners, and the majority of the Mexican Americans continued the custom originating in Mexico of accepting leadership from a ''patr\u00f3n'' (\"patron\") or ''jefe'' (\"boss\").<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Valley was characterized by a feudal political culture where the Mexican American tenant farmers and ranch workers were like serfs, and the \"bosses\" were like feudal barons.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> In Texas, to vote required paying a [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll tax]]. It was common for the wealthy ''patr\u00f3nes'' to pay the tax for the Mexican Americans, then order them to vote for the candidate the bosses supported.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The most noteworthy aspect of the Valley's political culture was extensive corruption and voting fraud.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 182-183</ref> To back up their rule, the ''jefes'' often appointed their ''pistoleros'' (gunmen) as deputy sheriffs who ensured that farmers and workers voted the \"right\" way by handing out ballots that had already been marked, which they would then place in the ballot boxes.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/>\n\nThe most powerful of the Valley's bosses was [[George Berham Parr|George Parr]], whom the press called \"the Duke of Duval\".<ref>Caro 1990 p. 184-186</ref> Locally, Parr was known to the Anglos as \"George B\" and to the Chicanos as ''Tacuacha'' (\"sly possum\").<ref>Caro 1990 p. 186</ref>  Parr owned much of the land and many of the businesses in the Valley; for instance, the only company allowed to sell beer in Duval county was owned by Parr.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 185-187</ref> Besides Duval county, Parr's influence extended to Jim Wells, Zapata, Webb, La Salle and Starr counties.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\">Caro 1990 p. 187</ref> One of Parr's  ''pistoleros'' was Luis Salas, known as ''Indio'' (Indian-a reference to his Tepehu\u00e1n descent and dark complexion), a man from Durango, Mexico who fled to the United States after killing a man in a bar brawl.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> Salas, a burly 6'1 man known for his great physical strength, ferocious temper and love of violence was in charge of elections in Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> As Parr was the first Anglo to treat Salas with respect and paid him well for his services, Salas was extremely loyal.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 188\">Caro 1990 p. 188</ref>\n\nParr was also a friend of Johnson's, as Frank B. Lloyd, the District Attorney (DA) in Alice, Texas recalled: \"George and Lyndon were very close. He [Johnson] didn't make public spectacles [of trips to Alice] like some of the politicians did. But there was the telephone\".<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\">Caro 1990 p. 191</ref> When Johnson first ran for the Senate in the [[United States Senate special election in Texas, 1941|1941]], he paid a large sum of money to Parr to obtain the Valley vote.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\">Caro 1990 p. 189</ref> Parr had supported Stevenson during his runs for Governor, but in 1944, the two had a falling out.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> The commander of a training base for the Army Air Force in Laredo complained to Stevenson that half of his men had been infected with venereal diseases after visiting brothels run by Parr, and asked that the governor appoint an honest district attorney who would crack down on prostitution.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> Over the objections of Parr, who wanted a family friend of one of his cronies appointed as DA, Stevenson appointed a DA who implemented a crackdown on prostitution; Parr never forgave Stevenson.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 190</ref> As a congressman Johnson had long lobbied for a presidential pardon for Parr, who had been convicted of tax evasion in 1932.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> In February 1946, the newly appointed [[United States Attorney General]], Texan [[Tom C. Clark]], recommended a pardon to President Truman, who granted it on 20 February.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> Parr believed Johnson's lobbying had ensured his pardon, which cemented their friendship.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/>\n\nIn Texas, the general rule was \"The lead in the runoff always wins\".<ref name=\"Caro p.309\">Caro p.309</ref> In Texas Democratic primaries, major candidates would \"hold out\", delaying reporting their final tallies so they could add additional votes if needed.<ref>Caro p.310</ref> This practice favored the side that initially led the runoff, because it was difficult for the other side to plausibly add enough votes to win without sparking accusations of fraud.<ref name=\"Caro p.309\"/> One of the few exceptions to the rule was the 1941 special election for U.S. Senate.

After years of desultory opposition to Democrats during the post-Reconstruction years of the [[Solid South]], Republicans vigorously contested the race by nominating businessman and party activist [[Homa J. Porter|Jack Porter]], who waged an aggressive campaign.  Johnson won his first term in the Senate, but by a closer margin than usual for Texas Democrats.\n\n==Background==\nLike other Southern states in the period between Reconstruction and the 1960s, Texas was a one party state, with the white population solidly voting Democratic as a legacy of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.596</ref> Disputes within the Texas Democratic Party were far more important than disputes between Democrats and Republicans. Starting with the 1944 election, the Democratic Party had been split between the Texas Loyalists who supported the administrations of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman and the [[Texas Regulars]] who were opposed.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\"/> Though the Texas Regulars had officially disbanded after the 1944 election, the split remained. Stevenson, a former governor of Texas had supported the Texas Regulars in 1944, and in 1948 flirted with supporting the [[Dixiecrat]] candidacy of South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.597</ref> Johnson by contrast was a member of the Texas Loyalist faction.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\"/> The acrimonious split in the Texas Democrats ensured an unusually bitter primary battle between Johnson and Stevenson.<ref>Baum & Haily 1994 p.596-597</ref>\n\nThe area around the Rio Grande valley was popularly known in Texas as \"the Valley\"; in a political sense the Valley also included several counties to the north.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181</ref> The majority of the people in the Valley were Chicanos (Mexican Americans), and the Valley was often described as feeling more like Mexico than the United States as Spanish was more widely spoken than English, the culture was predominantly Mexican and the majority of the houses were built in the same style as those found just across the border in Mexico.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181-182</ref> The Valley had the lowest literacy rate in the entire United States with the majority of its people being unable to read and write in Spanish, let alone English.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\">Caro 1990 p. 182</ref> The dominant element in the Valley were Anglos (white Texans- in Texas, the term '{{linktext|Anglo}}' did not necessarily imply English ancestry).<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Anglos tended to be ranch owners, and the majority of the Mexican Americans continued the custom originating in Mexico of accepting leadership from a ''patr\u00f3n'' (\"patron\") or ''jefe'' (\"boss\").<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Valley was characterized by a feudal political culture where the Mexican American tenant farmers and ranch workers were like serfs, and the \"bosses\" were like feudal barons.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> In Texas, to vote required paying a [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll tax]]. It was common for the wealthy ''patr\u00f3nes'' to pay the tax for the Mexican Americans, then order them to vote for the candidate the bosses supported.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The most noteworthy aspect of the Valley's political culture was extensive corruption and voting fraud.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 182-183</ref> To back up their rule, the ''jefes'' often appointed their ''pistoleros'' (gunmen) as deputy sheriffs who ensured that farmers and workers voted the \"right\" way by handing out ballots that had already been marked, which they would then place in the ballot boxes.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/>\n\nThe most powerful of the Valley's bosses was [[George Berham Parr|George Parr]], whom the press called \"the Duke of Duval\".<ref>Caro 1990 p. 184-186</ref> Locally, Parr was known to the Anglos as \"George B\" and to the Chicanos as ''Tacuacha'' (\"sly possum\").<ref>Caro 1990 p. 186</ref>  Parr owned much of the land and many of the businesses in the Valley; for instance, the only company allowed to sell beer in Duval county was owned by Parr.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 185-187</ref> Besides Duval county, Parr's influence extended to Jim Wells, Zapata, Webb, La Salle and Starr counties.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\">Caro 1990 p. 187</ref> One of Parr's  ''pistoleros'' was Luis Salas, known as ''Indio'' (Indian-a reference to his Tepehu\u00e1n descent and dark complexion), a man from Durango, Mexico who fled to the United States after killing a man in a bar brawl.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> Salas, a burly 6'1 man known for his great physical strength, ferocious temper and love of violence was in charge of elections in Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> As Parr was the first Anglo to treat Salas with respect and paid him well for his services, Salas was extremely loyal.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 188\">Caro 1990 p. 188</ref>\n\nParr was also a friend of Johnson's, as Frank B. Lloyd, the District Attorney (DA) in Alice, Texas recalled: \"George and Lyndon were very close. He [Johnson] didn't make public spectacles [of trips to Alice] like some of the politicians did. But there was the telephone\".<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\">Caro 1990 p. 191</ref> When Johnson first ran for the Senate in the [[United States Senate special election in Texas, 1941|1941]], he paid a large sum of money to Parr to obtain the Valley vote.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\">Caro 1990 p. 189</ref> Parr had supported Stevenson during his runs for Governor, but in 1944, the two had a falling out.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> The commander of a training base for the Army Air Force in Laredo complained to Stevenson that half of his men had been infected with venereal diseases after visiting brothels run by Parr, and asked that the governor appoint an honest district attorney who would crack down on prostitution.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> Over the objections of Parr, who wanted a family friend of one of his cronies appointed as DA, Stevenson appointed a DA who implemented a crackdown on prostitution; Parr never forgave Stevenson.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 190</ref> As a congressman Johnson had long lobbied for a presidential pardon for Parr, who had been convicted of tax evasion in 1932.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> In February 1946, the newly appointed [[United States Attorney General]], Texan [[Tom C. Clark]], recommended a pardon to President Truman, who granted it on 20 February.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> Parr believed Johnson's lobbying had ensured his pardon, which cemented their friendship.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/>\n\nIn Texas, the general rule was \"The lead in the runoff always wins\".<ref name=\"Caro p.309\">Caro p.309</ref> In Texas Democratic primaries, major candidates would \"hold out\", delaying reporting their final tallies so they could add additional votes if needed.<ref>Caro p.310</ref> This practice favored the side that initially led the runoff, because it was difficult for the other side to plausibly add enough votes to win without sparking accusations of fraud.<ref name=\"Caro p.309\"/> One of the few exceptions to the rule was the 1941 special election for U.S. Senate.

Recruit training lasts 80 days for members of the [[Australian Regular Army]] and 35 days for members of the [[Australian Army Reserve]]. In basic training recruits are taught drill, weapons and workplace safety, basic equipment maintenance, marksmanship, fieldcraft, radio use and defensive/offensive operations.\n\n===Regional Force Surveillance Units===\nTraining for recruits in the [[Regional Force Surveillance Unit]]s usually differs greatly from training in the rest of the Army. For instance, [[NORFORCE]] recruits attend a 2-week course at the Kangaroo Flats. Recruits from areas covered by the RFSUs often come from indigenous cultures radically different from that of the general Australian population, and as such many regular standards and methods of training are not as applicable in their case.\n\n===Royal Military College Duntroon===\nRecruit Training for officers in the Australian Army (known as ICT - Initial Cadet Training) takes place at [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] (RMC). The ICT is conducted for approximately seven weeks after which staff cadets continue military instruction in skills such as weapons training, military history, leadership, strategic studies and other such skills at section, platoon and company levels. Trainees at RMC hold the rank of Staff Cadet and, if successful in completing the course are commissioned as Lieutenants (pronounced Left-tenant). The overall full-time officer training course at RMC is 18 months long.\n\n== Canada ==\n[[File:RMC Sandhurst 2009.JPG|thumb|[[Royal Military College of Canada]] cadets compete in the prestigious Sandhurst Competition.]]\nCentralized recruit training in the Canadian Army did not exist until 1940, and until the creation of Basic Training Centres across Canada, recruit training had been done by individual units or depots.\n\nThe [[Canadian Army]], [[Royal Canadian Navy]], and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] were [[unification of the Canadian Forces|unified into one service]], the [[Canadian Forces]] in 1968. The Canadian Forces Training System, a unified system for all the services, was devised and remains in place today.\n\nMost non-commissioned CF recruits in the Regular Force (full-time) participate in the 10-week [[Basic Military Qualification]] (BMQ) at [[Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School]] at [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]], [[Quebec]]. Regular Force officers complete their 15-week [[Basic Military Officer Qualification]] (BMOQ) at CFLRS as well, before moving on to Second Language Training or their occupational training.\n\nAfter basic training, personnel are trained in the specialty of their \"environment\". Members of the Royal Canadian Navy undergo a five-week sea environment training course; with members of the Canadian Army undergo a 20-day Soldier Qualification course, while officers go through a 12-week Common Army Phase (now renamed to Basic Military Officer Qualification-Land); while members from the Royal Canadian Air Force move on directly to their trade training.\n\nReservists, particularly the Army Reserve, may conduct basic and trades training part-time, generally alternating weekends with their own units. Due to increased integration of the Regular and Reserve Force, many reservists attend courses hosted by the Regular Force. Members of the Army Reserves complete an 8-week BMQ/SQ combined course (Basic Military Qualification and Soldier Qualification) during the summer. Formerly the Naval and Air Reserve jointly conduct BMQ for its recruits at the Naval Reserve Training Division [[Borden, Ontario]] equivalent to Regular Force BMQ, at [[Canadian Forces Base Borden]]. Now the Naval Reserve conducts the Basic Military Naval Qualification in CFB Valcartier by the Canadian Forces Fleet School Qu\u00e9bec (a combination of recruit training and naval environmental training which leads to savings in the training). Navy trains its personnel in [[seamanship]], [[firefighting]], damage control and other skills after BMQ, in the Naval Environmental Training Program (NETP) in either [[Esquimalt, British Columbia]] or [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]].\n\nThe [[Royal Military College of Canada]] is the military academy of the Canadian Forces, and is a degree-granting university. The [[Royal Military College Saint-Jean]] is a Canadian military academy located on the site of [[Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)]],\n\n== China ==\n{{Main|Military education and training in China}}\n\n==Denmark==\nThe [[Danish Army]] conducts the HBU (H\u00e6rens Basisuddannelse, Army Basic Training course) at 8 bases around the country. The course lasts four months, and has its focus on training skills used in connection with the Danish total defence, and on recruiting for the army's international missions, and for the NCO-schools. The recruits are technically conscripts, but during recession years, many young men and woman have volunteered for HBU.\n\n==Finland==\nTraining lasts 5.5 to 11.5 months total. All Finnish conscripts undergo two months of basic training (''peruskoulutuskausi''), which is essentially the same for all servicemen. It includes assault rifle ([[Rk 62|RK-62]]/[[Rk 95 Tp|RK-95]]) marksman training, few other basic weapon training, battle training, short field medic training and camping skills. At the end of this training, all men are promoted to their first military rank. After this, specialized training is given depending on the person (5,5\u201311,5 months). The NCO trainees go to AUK (NCO school) and become corporals or sergeants, from which some are selected to [[Reserve Officer School|RUK (Reserve officer school)]] and become second lieutenants. The officer and NCO training always lasts a total of 11,5 months.\n\n==France==\nIn the French army, the \"Formation G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Initiale\" (FGI) is a 12 weeks course which occurs in a Centre de Formation Initiale des Militaires du Rang (CFIM). There are 10 CFIM in the country. Prior to this course, new recruits are joining the regiment they are going to serve during 3 to 5 years for reception week where they get issued gear, complete administrative documents and a final medical exam before starting training => in France any enlisted soldier signs not only for a MOS but also a unit to serve.\n\nAfter completing the 12 week FGI course, recruits are receiving the AFFIM certificate (say BCT graduation) and are considered as private 2nd class. After one week of leave, they go back to their regiment for the Formation de Sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 Initiale (FSI) => MOS training.\n\nAfter FGI+FSI, they can start training with their platoon for external deployment. Usually, Private 1st class rank is earned after 6 to 12 month of time in service.\n\nFor some units (mountain troops - airborne), there is also during first year a Formation d'Adaptation (FA)  for basic mountain training (2 \u00d7 2 weeks) or parachute school (3 weeks)\n\nContent of FGI is the following one:\n\nDrills,\nFirst aid and chemical warfare,\nPT and obstacle course,\nFirst weapon qualification (FAMAS, pistol and grenade), \nSignals,\nBasic field and infantry training (even if not MOS11B later on),\nPresentation of French army, soldiers duties and reports.\n\n==Germany==\nThe Allgemeine Grundausbildung (AGA) (i.e. ''general basic training'') of the [[Bundeswehr]] covers the first three months of military service.\n\nThe contents of the \"Allgemeine Grundausbildung\" includes\n\n* Formal training (ranks, flags, orders and other fundamentals)\n* Weapon Drill and Basic Combat training for all soldiers (Rifle, Pistol and machine gun drills are mandatory for every soldier)\n* Theoretical Courses about Democracy and legal regulations\n* Sports: the Basic Fitness Test (BFT) and the German Sports Badge (DSA)\n* Guard duty training (ATB SichSdt)\n* First Aid\n\nA notable peculiarity of German basic training is rooted in German military tradition that prefers initiative to obedience. Rather than \"breaking\" the personality of new recruits through intimidation and aggression, German basic training generally tries to \"mold\" a recruit's personality in the hope of producing soldiers with stronger personalities and more own initiative.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Greece==\nWhile until 2000 the Greek Army was mainly conscript based, since then a large Professional Enslisted institution has been adopted, which combined with the reduction of conscript service will produce an approximate 1:1 ratio between conscript and professional enlisted. While initially training of the two institutions was shared, it has since then diverged, and conscript training has been reduced in length while professional enlisted training has been increased.\n\nProfessional Enlisted, signing 7-year contracts, are called once per year. They go through a 14-week initial training, which is broken into a 6-week basic training period which ends with the oathing ceremony, and an 8-week combat course. After that period they proceed to specialty training which can last from 4 to 42 weeks.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.army.gr/default.php?pname=ekpsi_emth_epop_dekp&la=1|title=\u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u03a3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd - \u0395\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 \u0395\u039c\u0398-\u0395\u03a0\u039f\u03a0|website=www.army.gr|access-date=2016-10-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628072348/http://www.army.gr/default.php?pname=ekpsi_emth_epop_dekp&la=1|archive-date=2015-06-28|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nConscripted enlisted, serving a 9-month obligation, are called 6 times per year. They report to various recruit camps spread over the country. The first week is the reception week, followed by a 3-week basic soldier training course, which ends with the oathing ceremony. Depending on their awarded specialty the conscript recruits are then transferred to specialty training camps or to operational units. In the operational units the recruits go through a 3-week 'advanced' recruit training course, followed occasionally (depending on whether they have already received specialty training or not), by a 2 to 6 week specialty training course, conducted by the unit.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==India==\n{{Main|Military academies in India}}\nThe Indian military services have established numerous and distinguished academies and staff colleges across India for the purpose of training professional soldiers in new generation military sciences, warfare command and strategy, and associated technologies.\n\n==Israel==\n{{Main|Tironut}}\nThe recruit training of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (called '''''tironut''''' in Hebrew) varies depending on the unit: virtually every unusual unit completes a different training course. Recruits are certified as riflemen after the completion of the training, while most non-combat units train in all-army bases for the certification of Rifleman 02. Individuals who want to become officers must apply to be trained at a facility in the Negev desert called \"Bahad One\" (abbreviation of \"Basis Hadracha\", Instruction Base).\n\n==Pakistan==\n{{Main|Pakistan Military Academy}}\nThe Pakistan Military Academy (or '''PMA''') is a [[Military Academy]] of the [[Pakistan Army]]. It is located at [[Kakul]] in [[Abbottabad]] in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. The Pakistan Military Academy is analogous to [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]], [[West Point]] or [[Tironut]] and undertakes training of the prospective officers of Pakistan Army. The academy has four training battalions and sixteen companies.

This is followed by secularized training at '' Advanced & Specialized Trade Training School''.\n\n== Sweden ==\nSince conscription ended in [[Sweden]] in 2010 (reintroduced in 2017), all recruits who seek employment within the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] have to go through ''Grundl\u00e4ggande Milit\u00e4r Utbildning'' (GMU) (Basic Military Training) for three months.\n\nSince conscription was reintroduced in 2017, all recruits who seek employment in the Swedish Armed Forces have to go through ''Grundutbildning'' (GU) (Basic Training), which consists of two parts; ''Grundl\u00e4ggande Milit\u00e4r Utbildning''  (GMU) (Basic Military Training) that lasts for 3 months and aims to provide every recruit with the same foundation for continued military service, and ''Befattningsutbildning'' (Specialization Education) for between 1\u201311 months depending on specialization.\n\nThere is also a shorter volunteer training program for people who seek service within the [[Home Guard (Sweden)|Home Guard]] called GU-F. GU-F training takes only 14 days, but following a completed GU-F, a guardsman may go through additional training in order to specialize within the Home Guard.\n\nBasic training as part of GU as well as GU-F usually takes place at any of the [[Swedish Army]] training units.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jobb.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/vagen-in/grundutbildning/|title=Grundutbildning|last=F\u00f6rsvarsmakten|website=F\u00f6rsvarsmakten|language=sv-SE|access-date=2016-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011154520/http://jobb.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/vagen-in/grundutbildning/|archive-date=2016-10-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Switzerland ==\n[[Switzerland]] has mandatory military service ({{lang-de|Milit\u00e4rdienst}}; {{lang-fr|service militaire}}; {{lang-it|servizio militare}}) in the [[Military of Switzerland|Swiss Army]] for all able-bodied male [[Swiss citizen|citizens]], who are [[conscription|conscripted]] when they reach the [[age of majority]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Conscrits et recrues |url=http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/rekrut.html |language=French |publisher=[[Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports]] |accessdate=10 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502061315/http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/rekrut.html |archive-date=2 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> though women may volunteer for any position.<ref name=\":20\">{{cite web |title=Femmes dans l'arm\u00e9e |url=http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/fda.html |language=French |publisher=Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports |accessdate=10 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502010612/http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/fda.html |archive-date=2 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Conscripts make up the majority of the manpower in the [[Swiss Armed Forces]].<ref name=\"basics\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/en/home/schweizerarmee/organisation.parsys.68630.downloadList.58401.DownloadFile.tmp/02armeegrundgliederung20090401en.pdf|title=The basic organisation of the Swiss Armed Forces|publisher=Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200504/http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/en/home/schweizerarmee/organisation.parsys.68630.downloadList.58401.DownloadFile.tmp/02armeegrundgliederung20090401en.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2016|url-status=dead|accessdate=12 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 19, all male Swiss nationals must attend the two-day recruitment process in one of the six recruitment centres spread across Switzerland ([[Aarau]], [[Payerne]], [[Sumiswald]], [[Monte Ceneri]], [[R\u00fcti, Z\u00fcrich|R\u00fcti]], [[Mels]]). At the end of those two-days, if fit for service, recruits are assigned to a position in the [[Swiss Armed Forces]].\n\nA few months later, recruits start an 18-week (23-week for special forces) boot camp ({{lang-de|Rekrutenschulen}}; {{lang-fr|\u00e9cole de recrues}}; {{lang-it|scuola reclute}}) during which they are allowed to go home on week-ends. There are two boot camp start per year : January (Winter) and June (Summer). During the recruitment process, recruits can choose whether they would like to serve during summer or winter.\n\nIn the first seven weeks of boot camp, recruits receive \"General Basic Instruction\" ({{lang-de|Allgemeine Grundausbildung}}; {{lang-fr|Instruction de base g\u00e9n\u00e9rale}}; {{lang-it|Istruzione di base generale}}). During this period, recruits are instructed by their [[sergeants]] to [[military tactics]], the use of [[weaponry]] (including [[Stgw 90|SIG SG 550]]) and other equipment, [[marksmanship]], self-defense skills, buddy- and self- aid, [[CBRN defense]], basic survival skills, etc. Recruits are also educated to military life, including how to speak to their superiors, how to clean their weapons and combat shoes, how to clean the barracks, etc. During this period, recruits practice sport on a daily basis, including [[foot drill]], running, team sports, push-ups, etc. And a few kilometers march (up to 50&nbsp;km) some weeks.\n\nThe second phase of six weeks is devoted to ''function-specific basic instructions'' ({{lang-de|Funktionsgrundausbildung}}; {{lang-fr| Instruction de base sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 la fonction}}; {{lang-it|Istruzione di base alla funzione}}), where recruits learn skills specific to their job.\n\nIn the third phase, called \"instruction in formation\" ({{lang-de|Verbandsausbildung}}; {{lang-fr|Instruction en formation}}; {{lang-it| Istruzione di reparto}}), [[Battlegroup (army)|battlegroups]] and [[battalion]]s are formed.<ref>{{cite web |title=D\u00e9roulement de l'\u00e9cole |url=http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/rekrut/rs/schulablauf.html |language=French |publisher=Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports |accessdate=10 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508153626/http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/rekrut/rs/schulablauf.html |archive-date=8 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==United Kingdom==\n{{See also|Selection and Training in the British Army}}British armed forces recruits train in two phases. Phase One is initial recruit training lasting approximately three months, bringing all recruits to a similar standard of basic military ability. Phase Two consists of courses of varying duration to prepare recruits for their assigned role. Infantry training is an exception, combining Phase One and Phase Two in a course lasting six months.\n\nThe [[British Army]], [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Marines]] and [[Royal Air Force]] manage their own Phase One and Phase Two training establishments.\n\nThe first six weeks of training are the most demanding. Recruits are not permitted to leave the military estate or end their contract with the armed forces during this time.\n\n==United States==\nIn the United States, recruit training in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] is called [[United States Army Basic Training|Basic Combat Training]] (BCT); U.S. Army Combat Arms MOS (11 Series, 19 series, 13 series, 12 series) undergo One Station Unit Training (OSUT) which involves BCT, Advanced Individual Training and Specialized Training (such as Bradley, or Mortar School, or Gunnery) all in one. In the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] it is called [[Basic Military Training]] (BMT). In the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], [[U.S. Marine Corps]] and [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] it is called \"Recruit Training\" (commonly known as Boot Camp).\n\nSome services present a badge or other award to denote completion of recruit training. The Army typically issues the [[Army Service Ribbon]] (issued after completion of Advanced Individual Training), and the Air Force presents the [[Air Force Training Ribbon]] and the [[Airman's coin|Airman's Coin]]. The Marine Corps issue the [[Eagle, Globe, and Anchor]] once initial training is complete to signify that the recruits are now Marines. The Navy replaces the \"RECRUIT\" ball cap the recruits have worn throughout training with the \"NAVY\" ball cap upon successful completion of \"Battle Stations\". The United States Coast Guard's recruit training graduates place a Coast Guard Medallion on their ball cap.\n\nFor honor graduates of basic training, the Air Force, Coast Guard, and Navy present a [[Basic Training Honor Graduate Ribbon]]. The Navy and Marine Corps often meritoriously advance the top graduates of each division one pay-grade (up to a maximum of E-3).\n{{clear}}\n\n===U.S. Army===\n[[File:Drill-push.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army recruits being instructed]]\n{{Main|United States Army Basic Training}}\n\nIn the [[United States Army]], recruits are sent to Basic Combat Training in a location designated according to the military [[Military Occupational Specialty]], or MOS, which is selected upon enlistment.\n\nInitial Entry Training (IET) is divided into two parts, which commonly take place at two different locations, depending on the chosen MOS:\n*Basic Combat Training, or BCT, is a ten-week training cycle. This period does not include \"Reception Week\" during which recruits are being slotted to their training companies (troops for cavalry).\n*Advanced Individual Training, or AIT, is where new soldiers receive specific training in their chosen MOS. The length of AIT training varies depending on the MOS and can last anywhere from four weeks to nearly one year.\n*Several MOSs (mainly combat arms) combine both basic training and AIT in a single combined course called One Station Unit Training (OSUT), which can last up to 22 weeks. The attitude and environment remain the same throughout the entire training cycle, including drill instructors.  Essentially, OSUT is an extended version of Basic Training, especially for Infantry OSUT, which remains on the same basic soldiering tasks for the entire cycle, although in greater detail. Infantry OSUT is conducted at the [[United States Army Infantry School]] at Fort Benning, and lasts up to 22 weeks as of 2019.\nThe U.S. Army has four sites for BCT:\n*[[Fort Benning]] in [[Columbus, Georgia]]\n*[[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]]\n*[[Fort Leonard Wood (military base)|Fort Leonard Wood]] in [[St. Robert, Missouri]]\n*[[Fort Sill]] in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]]\n\nDuring Basic Combat Training, Army recruits learn a variety of basic combat skills including: Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM), land navigation, patrolling, securing and defending a position, drill and ceremony, fireteam formations and assaults, communications and use of AN/PRC-119 radio, combat lifesaving skills, 9-line medevac, reporting intelligence, hand grenades, Claymore mines, M203/M320 grenade launcher, M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW), M240B machine gun, M2 .50 caliber machine gun, MK-19, and AT-4 anti-tank weapon. Training also includes combat conditioning by running an obstacle course, the Confidence Course, conducting marches of varying distances up to 12 miles, physical training, and Modern Army Combatives Program (MACP), a martial arts program based on the combination of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Wrestling, Judo, Muay Thai, Boxing, and a number of others.<ref>[[Combatives#Modern Army Combatives]]</ref> Recruits are trained to adopt the Army \"Warrior Ethos\", and to memorize and live by the [[Soldier's Creed]].\n\nBCT is divided into three phases. During Phase I, (also known as \"Red Phase\") recruits are subject to \"Total Control,\" meaning their every action is monitored and constantly corrected by drill sergeants. The first week of training is commonly referred to as \"Hell Week,\" due to the intense period of adjustment required on the part of the new recruits. Marches are common throughout basic training. Recruits are sent to the \"gas chamber\" during Phase I, as part of training for defensive chemical warfare. They are also introduced to their standard-issue weapon, the [[M16A2 rifle]], the [[M16A4]] rifle, or [[M4 carbine]].\n\nIn Phase II (also known as \"White Phase\") soldiers begin actually firing weapons, starting with the rifle or carbine ([[M4A1]]). Other weapons the recruit becomes familiarized with include various grenades (such as the M67 fragmentation grenade) and grenade launchers (such as the M203). Recruits are then familiarized with the [[bayonet]], anti-tank/armor weaponry and other heavy weapons. The course also includes an obstacle course which the soldiers are expected to negotiate in a certain amount of time. Additionally, Phase II includes continual, intense PT, along with drill and ceremony training. At the conclusion of Phase II, Soldiers are to demonstrate proficiency with the various weaponry with which they trained.\n\nPhase III or \"Blue Phase,\" is the culmination and the most challenging of all the training phases. A final PT test is administered during the first week. Recruits who fail are frequently retested, often up until the morning of their cycle's graduation. If they do not pass, then they are recycled to another platoon that is in an earlier phase of the training cycle until they meet the fitness standards. The final PT Test is the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT). Usually, a Soldier needs to score at least 60 points in each APFT category (pushups, sit-ups, and 2 mile run) to pass, but in Basic Combat Training, only 50 points are required; the Soldier will nevertheless take another APFT with a 60-point requirement at AIT. During Blue Phase, the recruits move on to such longer and more intensive \"bivouac\" and FTX ([[Field Training Exercise]]s) as nighttime combat operations. Drill sergeants will make much of this an adversarial process by working against the recruits in many of the night operations and trying to foil plans, etc.\n\nUpon completion of Basic Combat Training, a recruit is now a soldier, and has developed skills to operate in a combat environment, as a basic rifleman and to perform his or her MOS-specific duties under fire.\n{{clear}}\n\n===U.S. Marine Corps===\n{{Main|United States Marine Corps Recruit Training}}\n[[File:Marine-drill-instructor.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Marine Corps Drill Instructor works with enlistees, or individuals who have not left yet for recruit training.

Phase one mainly consists of learning recruit life protocol, physical training, [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program|MCMAP]] training, academic classes, initial drill, a series inspection, and the confidence course. West coast recruits also do swim qualification during this phase. Phase two is completely in the field at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]] for west coast recruits, with the first two weeks being spent on marksmanship training and qualification with the M16A4 service rifle, and the last week in the field learning skills such as fireteam formations, land navigation, and hikes. For east coast recruits, phase two is swim qualification, rifle qualification, and Team Week, a week of maintenance duties for the island as a show of how to perform base support tasks while still keeping military bearing and attention to detail. Phase three brings the San Diego recruits back to the recruit depot where they finish up with final drill, final inspection, more PT and confidence courses, and graduation. During third phase, west coast recruits also go back into the field one last time to do the Crucible event. Parris Island recruits finish with field training, final drill and inspection, the Crucible, and graduation. Note that recruits going to either depot receive exactly the same training, if in a different order. An important part of this process is training recruits to adopt and live by the motto, \"Every Marine a rifleman\".<ref>{{citation_needed|date=December 2016}}</ref>\n\nUpon completion, recruits proceed to receive further training at the [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|School of Infantry (SOI)]].

Instead of having Drill Sergeants or Drill Instructors like other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, the U.S. Navy has RDCs (Recruit Division Commanders) that are assigned to each division. Training lasts approximately eight weeks (although some recruits will spend as many as nine weeks in training due to the somewhat complicated processing cycle). Days are counted by a system that lists the week and day that they are on, for example, 7-3 for week 7 day 3. The first approximate week is counted P-1, P-2, etc. which denotes that it is a processing day and does not count as part of their 8-week training period. Recruits are instructed on military drill, basic seamanship, basic shipboard damage control, firefighting, familiarization with the [[M9 pistol]] and [[Mossberg 500]] shotgun (the Navy no longer gives instruction on the [[M16 rifle|M16]] in boot camp), pass the confidence chamber (tear-gas-filled chamber), PT, and the basic essentials on Navy life. Recruits also attend many classes throughout boot camp on subjects such as Equal Opportunity, Sexual Assault Victim Intervention, [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], recognition of naval aircraft and vessels, and more. In order for recruits to pass boot camp, they are physically and mentally tested on a 12-hour exercise called Battle Stations which consists of 12 different scenarios involving firefighting, first-aid knowledge, survival at sea, mass casualties, shipboard flood control, bomb detection, and many other skills that they have been learning in the previous 7 weeks. After completion of boot camp, freshly minted Sailors are sent either to various \"A\" Schools located across the United States\u2014where they begin training to receive their [[List of United States Navy ratings|ratings]] (jobs)\u2014or to apprenticeship training, where they then enter the fleet without a designation.\n\nThe Navy formerly operated Recruit Training Centers in San Diego, California; Orlando, Florida; Meridian, Mississippi; and [[United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge|Port Deposit (Bainbridge), Maryland]]. From 1942 to 1946\u2014during and immediately following World War II\u2014the Navy had two additional training sites: Naval Training Station (USNTS) Sampson (renamed [[Sampson Air Force Base]] in 1950), near Seneca Lake, New York, where over 400,000 recruits were trained, and [[Farragut Naval Training Station]] in Bayview, Idaho.\n\n===U.S. Air Force===\n[[File:Air Force Military Training Instructor.jpg|thumb|upright|A formation of USAF airmen]]\n{{Main|United States Air Force Basic Military Training}}\nThe U.S. Air Force's Basic Military Training (BMT) is eight and a half weeks long, as they do not count the first week (\"Week 0\"). BMT is 63 calendar days long. It is conducted at [[Lackland Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. Formerly, trainees were referred to as \"Airman\" from day one of BMT. This has been changed; now, personnel are referred to as Trainees until the Airman's Coin Ceremony in the eighth week of training, when they receive their Airman's Coin.  Trainees receive military instruction (including the Air Force core values, flight and individual drill, and living area inspections), academic classes (covering topics such as Air Force history, dress and appearance, military customs and courtesies, ethics, security, and alcohol/drug abuse prevention and treatment), and field training (including protection against biological and chemical attack, basic marksmanship on the [[M4 carbine]] as well as self-aid buddy care).  Following BMT, Airmen go to a technical school (or 'tech school') where they learn the specifics of their [[Air Force Specialty Code]] (AFSC), which is equivalent to the MOS ([[Military Occupational Specialty]]) in the Army and Marines, the Navy's NEC (Naval Enlisted Classification) code, or the Coast Guard's ratings.\n\nAll non-prior-service enlistees are required to complete BMT, including those enlisting in the [[Air National Guard]] and [[Air Force Reserve Command]]. Reserve component enlistees receive the same training as their active-duty counterparts. Credit can be given on a case-by-case basis for enlistees with college credit, Eagle Scouts and service in the [[Civil Air Patrol]] qualify for promotion to E-2 ([[Airman]]) or E-3 ([[Airman First Class]]) upon graduation from BMT. The stripes are not worn until graduation, though trainees are paid at the higher pay grade.\n\nLackland AFB has been associated with BMT for almost the Air Force's entire history. From 1950 to 1956, 300,000 airmen received BMT at [[Sampson Air Force Base]] in New York.  In 1951, [[Parks Air Force Base]] in [[Dublin, California]] became a BMT center, with training beginning in March 1952. BMT at Parks AFB ceased later in the decade and the installation was transferred to the US Army in 1959. For a brief time between 1966 and 1968, the Air Force operated a second BMT at [[Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport#Amarillo Air Force Base (1951-68)|Amarillo Air Force Base]] in [[Amarillo, Texas]].\n\nUnlike the Army and Navy, but like the Marine Corps (throughout boot camp) and Coast Guard (during the first section of boot camp), trainees are required to refer to all Airmen, enlisted and NCO's as well as commissioned and warrant officers, as \"sir\" or \"ma'am\". Trainees are required to preface speaking to Military Training Instructors with their reporting statement: \"Sir/Ma'am, Trainee (the recruit's surname) reports as ordered\".\n\nAn additional 2 weeks of BMT was added to the program on November 1, 2008, extending the duration of BMT from six and a half weeks to eight and a half weeks. BMT has been tailored to incorporate some of the additional warfighting skills to coincide with increased Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) rotations and more frequent support of its sister services during those rotations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123016059|title=BMT extended, NCOs to learn new languages|date=17 July 2012|accessdate=1 January 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717031836/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123016059|archivedate=17 July 2012}}</ref> In 2015 BMT was shortened once again to seven and a half weeks. Trainees still stay at Lackland for eight and half weeks, however, the eighth week following graduation they are moved to a more relaxed environment under a program called Airman's Week, which is designed to transition trainees to technical training.\n{{clear}}\n\n===U.S. Coast Guard===\n[[File:USCG Basic Training.jpg|thumb|A Coast Guard Company Commander instructs a recruit during basic training.]]\nRecruit training for the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] is held at [[United States Coast Guard Training Center Cape May|Coast Guard Training Center Cape May]] in [[Cape May, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forcecom.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/FORCECOM-UNITS/TraCen-Cape-May/Training/applicants/|title=USCG Recruit Training|accessdate=22 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526231653/http://www.forcecom.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/FORCECOM-UNITS/TraCen-Cape-May/Training/applicants/|archive-date=26 May 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Coast Guard base on Government Island (now known as [[Coast Guard Island]]) [[Alameda, California]] was also used as a second major recruit training center until it was closed in 1982.

The U.S. Coast Guard is unique among the armed services in that it fires the [[SIG Sauer P229|SIG Sauer P229R]] pistol as well as the [[M16 rifle]] during the training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/features/0,15240,96246,00.html|title=Military Life|last=Military.com|accessdate=1 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106114450/http://www.military.com/features/0,15240,96246,00.html|archive-date=6 November 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Coast Guard is a part of the [[Department of Homeland Security]], rather than the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], it is by law and tradition a branch of the [[United States Armed Forces]]. As with all military personnel, Coast Guardsmen are subject to the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ). Due to the Coast Guard's unique mission set \u2013 including [[CONUS]] and [[CONUS#CONUS/OCONUS|OCONUS]] defense operations, search and rescue and maritime law enforcement \u2013 there are added requirements to maintain high physical fitness standards and military bearing. Due to its unusual, diverse and difficult mission, the U.S. Coast Guard is the most selective in recruiting and training standards. As an example, the [[United States Coast Guard Academy|Coast Guard Academy]] is the only service academy that uses competitive admissions for prospective officer candidates rather than congressional appointment.\n\nDuring their time at Cape May, recruits are subjected to the usual \"boot camp\" atmosphere of direct instruction and intense motivation. Recruits must adhere to strict rules such as hygiene and uniform regulations and obey all lawful orders. The recruits are designated as Seaman Recruits (SR; E-1). Unique to the Coast Guard among the armed services, recruits successfully completing basic recruit training are advanced to the rank of Seaman Apprentice/Fireman Apprentice (SA/FA; E-2) or Seaman/Fireman (SN/FN; E-3) upon graduation\u2014the difference generally based on level of higher education the graduate possesses. Coast Guard drill instructors are called \"company commanders\" and hold a rank ranging from Petty Officer 2nd Class (E-5) up to Senior Chief Petty Officer (E-8). Coast Guard companies have approximately two or three company commanders and anywhere from 20 to over 100 recruits.\n\nAfter completing boot camp, recruits can select their rating and then attend an \"A\" school. Few graduates go straight to \"A\" school; most spend up to a year in the fleet as \"non-rates\". \"A\" school is a long-term technical school providing specific instruction about a rating. The \"A\" schools last two to six months and usually occur at [[Training Center Yorktown|TRACEN Yorktown]], [[Yorktown, Virginia]] or [[Training Center Petaluma|TRACEN Petaluma]], [[Petaluma, California]]. Aviation related ratings train at the Aviation Technical Training Center at [[Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City]], [[North Carolina]]. Some ratings have an available on-the-job apprenticeship training option known as \"striking\" instead of attending an \"A\" school.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Military education and training]]\n*[[Milling (military training exercise)|Milling]] - military training exercise\n*[[Military Academy]]\n*[[Officer Candidate School]]\n*[[Resocialization]]\n*[[Psychological conditioning]]\n*[[Military recruitment]]\n*[[Military service]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* USAREC (2003).

According to [[Finnish Army]] regulations,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} for example, foot drill is essential for the [[esprit de corps]] and cohesion, accustoms recruits to instinctive obedience, enables large units to be marched and moved in an orderly manner, and creates the basis for action in the battlefield.\n\n=== Stress and punishment ===\nThe training process applies [[stressor]]s continuously.

Some nations operate both volunteer and conscription systems simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/louder-than-words-1|title=Louder than words: An agenda for action to end state use of child soldiers|website=Child Soldiers International|language=en|access-date=2017-12-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206214053/https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/louder-than-words-1|archive-date=2017-12-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nRecruit training differs according to [[military branch]]:\n* [[Army]] and [[Marine Corps]] recruits are normally trained in basic [[marksmanship]] with individually assigned [[weapon]]s, field maintenance of weapons, [[physical fitness]] training, [[first aid]], and basic survival techniques.\n* [[Navy]] and [[Coast Guard]] training usually focuses on water survival training, physical fitness, basic seamanship, and such skills as shipboard [[firefighting]], basic [[engineering]], and signals.\n* [[Air force]] training usually includes physical fitness training, military and classroom instructions, and field training in basic marksmanship and first aid.\nThe training further differs according to military role:\n\nRecruits for [[close combat]] roles (e.g. [[infantry]] are trained to fight at [[Close quarters combat|close quarters]], including with a [[bayonet]]; training for these positions is normally more vigorous and aggressive than that for other roles (e.g. [[Military logistics|logistics]]).\n\n== Australia ==\n{{Main|Australian Army Recruit Training}}\nMost of the recruit training in the [[Australian Army]] is currently held at [[Army Recruit Training Centre]] (ARTC) at [[Kapooka]], near [[Wagga Wagga]] in [[New South Wales]]. Recruit training lasts 80 days for members of the [[Australian Regular Army]] and 35 days for members of the [[Australian Army Reserve]]. In basic training recruits are taught drill, weapons and workplace safety, basic equipment maintenance, marksmanship, fieldcraft, radio use and defensive/offensive operations.\n\n===Regional Force Surveillance Units===\nTraining for recruits in the [[Regional Force Surveillance Unit]]s usually differs greatly from training in the rest of the Army. For instance, [[NORFORCE]] recruits attend a 2-week course at the Kangaroo Flats. Recruits from areas covered by the RFSUs often come from indigenous cultures radically different from that of the general Australian population, and as such many regular standards and methods of training are not as applicable in their case.\n\n===Royal Military College Duntroon===\nRecruit Training for officers in the Australian Army (known as ICT - Initial Cadet Training) takes place at [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] (RMC). The ICT is conducted for approximately seven weeks after which staff cadets continue military instruction in skills such as weapons training, military history, leadership, strategic studies and other such skills at section, platoon and company levels. Trainees at RMC hold the rank of Staff Cadet and, if successful in completing the course are commissioned as Lieutenants (pronounced Left-tenant). The overall full-time officer training course at RMC is 18 months long.\n\n== Canada ==\n[[File:RMC Sandhurst 2009.JPG|thumb|[[Royal Military College of Canada]] cadets compete in the prestigious Sandhurst Competition.]]\nCentralized recruit training in the Canadian Army did not exist until 1940, and until the creation of Basic Training Centres across Canada, recruit training had been done by individual units or depots.\n\nThe [[Canadian Army]], [[Royal Canadian Navy]], and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] were [[unification of the Canadian Forces|unified into one service]], the [[Canadian Forces]] in 1968. The Canadian Forces Training System, a unified system for all the services, was devised and remains in place today.\n\nMost non-commissioned CF recruits in the Regular Force (full-time) participate in the 10-week [[Basic Military Qualification]] (BMQ) at [[Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School]] at [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]], [[Quebec]]. Regular Force officers complete their 15-week [[Basic Military Officer Qualification]] (BMOQ) at CFLRS as well, before moving on to Second Language Training or their occupational training.\n\nAfter basic training, personnel are trained in the specialty of their \"environment\". Members of the Royal Canadian Navy undergo a five-week sea environment training course; with members of the Canadian Army undergo a 20-day Soldier Qualification course, while officers go through a 12-week Common Army Phase (now renamed to Basic Military Officer Qualification-Land); while members from the Royal Canadian Air Force move on directly to their trade training.\n\nReservists, particularly the Army Reserve, may conduct basic and trades training part-time, generally alternating weekends with their own units. Due to increased integration of the Regular and Reserve Force, many reservists attend courses hosted by the Regular Force. Members of the Army Reserves complete an 8-week BMQ/SQ combined course (Basic Military Qualification and Soldier Qualification) during the summer. Formerly the Naval and Air Reserve jointly conduct BMQ for its recruits at the Naval Reserve Training Division [[Borden, Ontario]] equivalent to Regular Force BMQ, at [[Canadian Forces Base Borden]]. Now the Naval Reserve conducts the Basic Military Naval Qualification in CFB Valcartier by the Canadian Forces Fleet School Qu\u00e9bec (a combination of recruit training and naval environmental training which leads to savings in the training). Navy trains its personnel in [[seamanship]], [[firefighting]], damage control and other skills after BMQ, in the Naval Environmental Training Program (NETP) in either [[Esquimalt, British Columbia]] or [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]].\n\nThe [[Royal Military College of Canada]] is the military academy of the Canadian Forces, and is a degree-granting university. The [[Royal Military College Saint-Jean]] is a Canadian military academy located on the site of [[Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)]],\n\n== China ==\n{{Main|Military education and training in China}}\n\n==Denmark==\nThe [[Danish Army]] conducts the HBU (H\u00e6rens Basisuddannelse, Army Basic Training course) at 8 bases around the country. The course lasts four months, and has its focus on training skills used in connection with the Danish total defence, and on recruiting for the army's international missions, and for the NCO-schools. The recruits are technically conscripts, but during recession years, many young men and woman have volunteered for HBU.\n\n==Finland==\nTraining lasts 5.5 to 11.5 months total. All Finnish conscripts undergo two months of basic training (''peruskoulutuskausi''), which is essentially the same for all servicemen. It includes assault rifle ([[Rk 62|RK-62]]/[[Rk 95 Tp|RK-95]]) marksman training, few other basic weapon training, battle training, short field medic training and camping skills. At the end of this training, all men are promoted to their first military rank. After this, specialized training is given depending on the person (5,5\u201311,5 months). The NCO trainees go to AUK (NCO school) and become corporals or sergeants, from which some are selected to [[Reserve Officer School|RUK (Reserve officer school)]] and become second lieutenants. The officer and NCO training always lasts a total of 11,5 months.\n\n==France==\nIn the French army, the \"Formation G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Initiale\" (FGI) is a 12 weeks course which occurs in a Centre de Formation Initiale des Militaires du Rang (CFIM). There are 10 CFIM in the country. Prior to this course, new recruits are joining the regiment they are going to serve during 3 to 5 years for reception week where they get issued gear, complete administrative documents and a final medical exam before starting training => in France any enlisted soldier signs not only for a MOS but also a unit to serve.\n\nAfter completing the 12 week FGI course, recruits are receiving the AFFIM certificate (say BCT graduation) and are considered as private 2nd class. After one week of leave, they go back to their regiment for the Formation de Sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 Initiale (FSI) => MOS training.\n\nAfter FGI+FSI, they can start training with their platoon for external deployment. Usually, Private 1st class rank is earned after 6 to 12 month of time in service.\n\nFor some units (mountain troops - airborne), there is also during first year a Formation d'Adaptation (FA)  for basic mountain training (2 \u00d7 2 weeks) or parachute school (3 weeks)\n\nContent of FGI is the following one:\n\nDrills,\nFirst aid and chemical warfare,\nPT and obstacle course,\nFirst weapon qualification (FAMAS, pistol and grenade), \nSignals,\nBasic field and infantry training (even if not MOS11B later on),\nPresentation of French army, soldiers duties and reports.\n\n==Germany==\nThe Allgemeine Grundausbildung (AGA) (i.e. ''general basic training'') of the [[Bundeswehr]] covers the first three months of military service.\n\nThe contents of the \"Allgemeine Grundausbildung\" includes\n\n* Formal training (ranks, flags, orders and other fundamentals)\n* Weapon Drill and Basic Combat training for all soldiers (Rifle, Pistol and machine gun drills are mandatory for every soldier)\n* Theoretical Courses about Democracy and legal regulations\n* Sports: the Basic Fitness Test (BFT) and the German Sports Badge (DSA)\n* Guard duty training (ATB SichSdt)\n* First Aid\n\nA notable peculiarity of German basic training is rooted in German military tradition that prefers initiative to obedience. Rather than \"breaking\" the personality of new recruits through intimidation and aggression, German basic training generally tries to \"mold\" a recruit's personality in the hope of producing soldiers with stronger personalities and more own initiative.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Greece==\nWhile until 2000 the Greek Army was mainly conscript based, since then a large Professional Enslisted institution has been adopted, which combined with the reduction of conscript service will produce an approximate 1:1 ratio between conscript and professional enlisted. While initially training of the two institutions was shared, it has since then diverged, and conscript training has been reduced in length while professional enlisted training has been increased.\n\nProfessional Enlisted, signing 7-year contracts, are called once per year. They go through a 14-week initial training, which is broken into a 6-week basic training period which ends with the oathing ceremony, and an 8-week combat course. After that period they proceed to specialty training which can last from 4 to 42 weeks.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.army.gr/default.php?pname=ekpsi_emth_epop_dekp&la=1|title=\u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u03a3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd - \u0395\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 \u0395\u039c\u0398-\u0395\u03a0\u039f\u03a0|website=www.army.gr|access-date=2016-10-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628072348/http://www.army.gr/default.php?pname=ekpsi_emth_epop_dekp&la=1|archive-date=2015-06-28|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nConscripted enlisted, serving a 9-month obligation, are called 6 times per year. They report to various recruit camps spread over the country. The first week is the reception week, followed by a 3-week basic soldier training course, which ends with the oathing ceremony. Depending on their awarded specialty the conscript recruits are then transferred to specialty training camps or to operational units. In the operational units the recruits go through a 3-week 'advanced' recruit training course, followed occasionally (depending on whether they have already received specialty training or not), by a 2 to 6 week specialty training course, conducted by the unit.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==India==\n{{Main|Military academies in India}}\nThe Indian military services have established numerous and distinguished academies and staff colleges across India for the purpose of training professional soldiers in new generation military sciences, warfare command and strategy, and associated technologies.\n\n==Israel==\n{{Main|Tironut}}\nThe recruit training of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (called '''''tironut''''' in Hebrew) varies depending on the unit: virtually every unusual unit completes a different training course. Recruits are certified as riflemen after the completion of the training, while most non-combat units train in all-army bases for the certification of Rifleman 02. Individuals who want to become officers must apply to be trained at a facility in the Negev desert called \"Bahad One\" (abbreviation of \"Basis Hadracha\", Instruction Base).\n\n==Pakistan==\n{{Main|Pakistan Military Academy}}\nThe Pakistan Military Academy (or '''PMA''') is a [[Military Academy]] of the [[Pakistan Army]]. It is located at [[Kakul]] in [[Abbottabad]] in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. The Pakistan Military Academy is analogous to [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]], [[West Point]] or [[Tironut]] and undertakes training of the prospective officers of Pakistan Army. The academy has four training battalions and sixteen companies. A Cadet is trained and passed out as an officer of the Pakistan Army in 2 years.\n\nEnlisted Men undertake training at the Regimental Center of their chosen regiment.\n\n== Russia ==\n{{Main|Military academies in Russia}}\n\n==Singapore==\n{{update|section|date=July 2011}}\n{{Main|National Service in Singapore}}\nNational Service (NS) in Singapore is compulsory for all able-bodied male citizens and second generation permanent residents who have reached the age of 18.

Following basic training specialized training would be carried out at Regimental Training Centres.\n\nBasic training for new recruits of the [[Sri Lanka Navy]] which is approximately six months are conducted at  ''Advanced Naval Training Center'', SLNS 'Nipuna'; ''Naval Artificer Training Institute'', SLNS 'Thakshila', Welisara; and at Naval Recruit Training Centres at several shore establishments . This basic training will be followed by ''on-the-job'' training on-board fleet units and at shore establishments. Combat Training School at SLNS 'Pandukabaya' conducts combat training for [[Sri Lanka Navy#Naval Patrolmen|Naval Patrolmen]].\n\nBasic training for airmen of the [[Sri Lanka Air Force]] is handled by the Training Wing of the [[SLAF Diyatalawa]]. This is followed by secularized training at '' Advanced & Specialized Trade Training School''.\n\n== Sweden ==\nSince conscription ended in [[Sweden]] in 2010 (reintroduced in 2017), all recruits who seek employment within the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] have to go through ''Grundl\u00e4ggande Milit\u00e4r Utbildning'' (GMU) (Basic Military Training) for three months.\n\nSince conscription was reintroduced in 2017, all recruits who seek employment in the Swedish Armed Forces have to go through ''Grundutbildning'' (GU) (Basic Training), which consists of two parts; ''Grundl\u00e4ggande Milit\u00e4r Utbildning''  (GMU) (Basic Military Training) that lasts for 3 months and aims to provide every recruit with the same foundation for continued military service, and ''Befattningsutbildning'' (Specialization Education) for between 1\u201311 months depending on specialization.\n\nThere is also a shorter volunteer training program for people who seek service within the [[Home Guard (Sweden)|Home Guard]] called GU-F. GU-F training takes only 14 days, but following a completed GU-F, a guardsman may go through additional training in order to specialize within the Home Guard.\n\nBasic training as part of GU as well as GU-F usually takes place at any of the [[Swedish Army]] training units.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jobb.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/vagen-in/grundutbildning/|title=Grundutbildning|last=F\u00f6rsvarsmakten|website=F\u00f6rsvarsmakten|language=sv-SE|access-date=2016-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011154520/http://jobb.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/vagen-in/grundutbildning/|archive-date=2016-10-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Switzerland ==\n[[Switzerland]] has mandatory military service ({{lang-de|Milit\u00e4rdienst}}; {{lang-fr|service militaire}}; {{lang-it|servizio militare}}) in the [[Military of Switzerland|Swiss Army]] for all able-bodied male [[Swiss citizen|citizens]], who are [[conscription|conscripted]] when they reach the [[age of majority]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Conscrits et recrues |url=http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/rekrut.html |language=French |publisher=[[Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports]] |accessdate=10 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502061315/http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/rekrut.html |archive-date=2 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> though women may volunteer for any position.<ref name=\":20\">{{cite web |title=Femmes dans l'arm\u00e9e |url=http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/fda.html |language=French |publisher=Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports |accessdate=10 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502010612/http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/fda.html |archive-date=2 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Conscripts make up the majority of the manpower in the [[Swiss Armed Forces]].<ref name=\"basics\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/en/home/schweizerarmee/organisation.parsys.68630.downloadList.58401.DownloadFile.tmp/02armeegrundgliederung20090401en.pdf|title=The basic organisation of the Swiss Armed Forces|publisher=Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200504/http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/en/home/schweizerarmee/organisation.parsys.68630.downloadList.58401.DownloadFile.tmp/02armeegrundgliederung20090401en.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2016|url-status=dead|accessdate=12 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 19, all male Swiss nationals must attend the two-day recruitment process in one of the six recruitment centres spread across Switzerland ([[Aarau]], [[Payerne]], [[Sumiswald]], [[Monte Ceneri]], [[R\u00fcti, Z\u00fcrich|R\u00fcti]], [[Mels]]). At the end of those two-days, if fit for service, recruits are assigned to a position in the [[Swiss Armed Forces]].\n\nA few months later, recruits start an 18-week (23-week for special forces) boot camp ({{lang-de|Rekrutenschulen}}; {{lang-fr|\u00e9cole de recure}}; {{lang-it|scuola reclute}}) during which they are allowed to go home on week-ends. There are two boot camp start per year : January (Winter) and June (Summer). During the recruitment process, recruits can choose whether they would like to serve during summer or winter.\n\nIn the first seven weeks of boot camp, recruits receive \"General Basic Instruction\" ({{lang-de|Allgemeine Grundausbildung}}; {{lang-fr|Instruction de base g\u00e9n\u00e9rale}}; {{lang-it|Istruzione di base generale}}). During this period, recruits are instructed by their [[sergeants]] to [[military tactics]], the use of [[weaponry]] (including [[Stgw 90|SIG SG 550]]) and other equipment, [[marksmanship]], self-defense skills, buddy- and self- aid, [[CBRN defense]], basic survival skills, etc. Recruits are also educated to military life, including how to speak to their superiors, how to clean their weapons and combat shoes, how to clean the barracks, etc. During this period, recruits practice sport on a daily basis, including [[foot drill]], running, team sports, push-ups, etc. And a few kilometers march (up to 50&nbsp;km) some weeks.\n\nThe second phase of six weeks is devoted to ''function-specific basic instructions'' ({{lang-de|Funktionsgrundausbildung}}; {{lang-fr| Instruction de base sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 la fonction}}; {{lang-it|Istruzione di base alla funzione}}), where recruits learn skills specific to their job.\n\nIn the third phase, called \"instruction in formation\" ({{lang-de|Verbandsausbildung}}; {{lang-fr|Instruction en formation}}; {{lang-it| Istruzione di reparto}}), [[Battlegroup (army)|battlegroups]] and [[battalion]]s are formed.<ref>{{cite web |title=D\u00e9roulement de l'\u00e9cole |url=http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/rekrut/rs/schulablauf.html |language=French |publisher=Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports |accessdate=10 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508153626/http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/rekrut/rs/schulablauf.html |archive-date=8 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==United Kingdom==\n{{See also|Selection and Training in the British Army}}British armed forces recruits train in two phases. Phase One is initial recruit training lasting approximately three months, bringing all recruits to a similar standard of basic military ability. Phase Two consists of courses of varying duration to prepare recruits for their assigned role. Infantry training is an exception, combining Phase One and Phase Two in a course lasting six months.\n\nThe [[British Army]], [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Marines]] and [[Royal Air Force]] manage their own Phase One and Phase Two training establishments.\n\nThe first six weeks of training are the most demanding. Recruits are not permitted to leave the military estate or end their contract with the armed forces during this time.\n\n==United States==\nIn the United States, recruit training in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] is called [[United States Army Basic Training|Basic Combat Training]] (BCT); U.S. Army Combat Arms MOS (11 Series, 19 series, 13 series, 12 series) undergo One Station Unit Training (OSUT) which involves BCT, Advanced Individual Training and Specialized Training (such as Bradley, or Mortar School, or Gunnery) all in one. In the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] it is called [[Basic Military Training]] (BMT). In the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], [[U.S. Marine Corps]] and [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] it is called \"Recruit Training\" (commonly known as Boot Camp).\n\nSome services present a badge or other award to denote completion of recruit training. The Army typically issues the [[Army Service Ribbon]] (issued after completion of Advanced Individual Training), and the Air Force presents the [[Air Force Training Ribbon]] and the [[Airman's coin|Airman's Coin]]. The Marine Corps issue the [[Eagle, Globe, and Anchor]] once initial training is complete to signify that the recruits are now Marines. The Navy replaces the \"RECRUIT\" ball cap the recruits have worn throughout training with the \"NAVY\" ball cap upon successful completion of \"Battle Stations\". The United States Coast Guard's recruit training graduates place a Coast Guard Medallion on their ball cap.\n\nFor honor graduates of basic training, the Air Force, Coast Guard, and Navy present a [[Basic Training Honor Graduate Ribbon]]. The Navy and Marine Corps often meritoriously advance the top graduates of each division one pay-grade (up to a maximum of E-3).\n{{clear}}\n\n===U.S. Army===\n[[File:Drill-push.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army recruits being instructed]]\n{{Main|United States Army Basic Training}}\n\nIn the [[United States Army]], recruits are sent to Basic Combat Training in a location designated according to the military [[Military Occupational Specialty]], or MOS, which is selected upon enlistment.\n\nInitial Entry Training (IET) is divided into two parts, which commonly take place at two different locations, depending on the chosen MOS:\n*Basic Combat Training, or BCT, is a ten-week training cycle. This period does not include \"Reception Week\" during which recruits are being slotted to their training companies (troops for cavalry).\n*Advanced Individual Training, or AIT, is where new soldiers receive specific training in their chosen MOS. The length of AIT training varies depending on the MOS and can last anywhere from four weeks to nearly one year.\n*Several MOSs (mainly combat arms) combine both basic training and AIT in a single combined course called One Station Unit Training (OSUT), which can last up to 22 weeks. The attitude and environment remain the same throughout the entire training cycle, including drill instructors.  Essentially, OSUT is an extended version of Basic Training, especially for Infantry OSUT, which remains on the same basic soldiering tasks for the entire cycle, although in greater detail. Infantry OSUT is conducted at the [[United States Army Infantry School]] at Fort Benning, and lasts up to 22 weeks as of 2019.\nThe U.S. Army has four sites for BCT:\n*[[Fort Benning]] in [[Columbus, Georgia]]\n*[[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]]\n*[[Fort Leonard Wood (military base)|Fort Leonard Wood]] in [[St. Robert, Missouri]]\n*[[Fort Sill]] in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]]\n\nDuring Basic Combat Training, Army recruits learn a variety of basic combat skills including: Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM), land navigation, patrolling, securing and defending a position, drill and ceremony, fireteam formations and assaults, communications and use of AN/PRC-119 radio, combat lifesaving skills, 9-line medevac, reporting intelligence, hand grenades, Claymore mines, M203/M320 grenade launcher, M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW), M240B machine gun, M2 .50 caliber machine gun, MK-19, and AT-4 anti-tank weapon. Training also includes combat conditioning by running an obstacle course, the Confidence Course, conducting marches of varying distances up to 12 miles, physical training, and Modern Army Combatives Program (MACP), a martial arts program based on the combination of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Wrestling, Judo, Muay Thai, Boxing, and a number of others.<ref>[[Combatives#Modern Army Combatives]]</ref> Recruits are trained to adopt the Army \"Warrior Ethos\", and to memorize and live by the [[Soldier's Creed]].\n\nBCT is divided into three phases. During Phase I, (also known as \"Red Phase\") recruits are subject to \"Total Control,\" meaning their every action is monitored and constantly corrected by drill sergeants. The first week of training is commonly referred to as \"Hell Week,\" due to the intense period of adjustment required on the part of the new recruits. Marches are common throughout basic training. Recruits are sent to the \"gas chamber\" during Phase I, as part of training for defensive chemical warfare. They are also introduced to their standard-issue weapon, the [[M16A2 rifle]], the [[M16A4]] rifle, or [[M4 carbine]].\n\nIn Phase II (also known as \"White Phase\") soldiers begin actually firing weapons, starting with the rifle or carbine ([[M4A1]]). Other weapons the recruit becomes familiarized with include various grenades (such as the M67 fragmentation grenade) and grenade launchers (such as the M203). Recruits are then familiarized with the [[bayonet]], anti-tank/armor weaponry and other heavy weapons. The course also includes an obstacle course which the soldiers are expected to negotiate in a certain amount of time. Additionally, Phase II includes continual, intense PT, along with drill and ceremony training. At the conclusion of Phase II, Soldiers are to demonstrate proficiency with the various weaponry with which they trained.\n\nPhase III or \"Blue Phase,\" is the culmination and the most challenging of all the training phases. A final PT test is administered during the first week. Recruits who fail are frequently retested, often up until the morning of their cycle's graduation. If they do not pass, then they are recycled to another platoon that is in an earlier phase of the training cycle until they meet the fitness standards. The final PT Test is the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT). Usually, a Soldier needs to score at least 60 points in each APFT category (pushups, sit-ups, and 2 mile run) to pass, but in Basic Combat Training, only 50 points are required; the Soldier will nevertheless take another APFT with a 60-point requirement at AIT. During Blue Phase, the recruits move on to such longer and more intensive \"bivouac\" and FTX ([[Field Training Exercise]]s) as nighttime combat operations. Drill sergeants will make much of this an adversarial process by working against the recruits in many of the night operations and trying to foil plans, etc.\n\nUpon completion of Basic Combat Training, a recruit is now a soldier, and has developed skills to operate in a combat environment, as a basic rifleman and to perform his or her MOS-specific duties under fire.\n{{clear}}\n\n===U.S. Marine Corps===\n{{Main|United States Marine Corps Recruit Training}}\n[[File:Marine-drill-instructor.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Marine Corps Drill Instructor works with enlistees, or individuals who have not left yet for recruit training.

All female enlisted Marines go to Parris Island. Men go to either, depending on whether they were recruited east or west of the [[Mississippi River]].  Marine Corps boot camp is the longest basic training, excluding Army OSUT, in-processing & out-processing is included unlike the other branches as the other branches do not contain this in their Basic Training duration length.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://nation.time.com/2011/06/02/the-few-the-proud-the-broken/|title=The Few, the Proud, the Broken|journal=Time|first=Mark|last=Thompson|accessdate=1 January 2017|via=nation.time.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161214041258/http://nation.time.com/2011/06/02/the-few-the-proud-the-broken/|archive-date=14 December 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Formerly, recruits were referred to as either \"(the) Private(s)\" or \"(the) recruit(s)\" from day one of Recruit Training. Since the 1990s, they are referred to as \"(the) recruit(s)\" alone until they earn the title of Marine.\n\nMarine Corps Recruit Training (MCRT) is a 13-week program that is divided up into three four-week phases and further broken down into individual training days.<ref name=\"mcrt-1\">\n{{cite web\n | url =http://www.marines.com/becoming-a-marine/recruit-training\n | title =Recruit Training\n | website =Marines\n | access-date =2016-12-19\n | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20161219185749/http://www.marines.com/becoming-a-marine/recruit-training/\n | archive-date =2016-12-19\n | url-status =live\n }}\n</ref> While there are 69 individual training days, recruits also go through pre- and post-training processing where recruits are afforded relatively little freedom. Phase one mainly consists of learning recruit life protocol, physical training, [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program|MCMAP]] training, academic classes, initial drill, a series inspection, and the confidence course. West coast recruits also do swim qualification during this phase. Phase two is completely in the field at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]] for west coast recruits, with the first two weeks being spent on marksmanship training and qualification with the M16A4 service rifle, and the last week in the field learning skills such as fireteam formations, land navigation, and hikes. For east coast recruits, phase two is swim qualification, rifle qualification, and Team Week, a week of maintenance duties for the island as a show of how to perform base support tasks while still keeping military bearing and attention to detail. Phase three brings the San Diego recruits back to the recruit depot where they finish up with final drill, final inspection, more PT and confidence courses, and graduation. During third phase, west coast recruits also go back into the field one last time to do the Crucible event. Parris Island recruits finish with field training, final drill and inspection, the Crucible, and graduation. Note that recruits going to either depot receive exactly the same training, if in a different order. An important part of this process is training recruits to adopt and live by the motto, \"Every Marine a rifleman\".<ref>{{citation_needed|date=December 2016}}</ref>\n\nUpon completion, recruits proceed to receive further training at the [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|School of Infantry (SOI)]].

Training also includes combat conditioning by running an obstacle course, conducting marches, physical training, and Marine Corps Martial Arts Program. Upon completion of Marine Combat Training, the Marine is to have gained the knowledge and ability to operate in a combat environment as a basic rifleman and to perform his or her primary duties under fire.<ref>[[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry]]</ref> (The main contrast with Army recruit training is that nearly identical training is integrated into Basic Combat Training, so there is no follow-on school.) Upon completion, Marines proceed to their MOS-specific school.\n\nIn Infantry Training Battalion (ITB), [[infantry]] [[List of United States Marine Corps MOS|MOS]] (03XX) Marines receive 59 days of training in infantry skills, including advanced marksmanship, combat patrolling, land navigation, and a wide array of other infantry skills. Upon completion of ITB, newly qualified Marine infantrymen proceed to their assigned units.\n\n===U.S. Navy===\n[[File:Instructional Training exercises at RTC Great Lakes.jpg|thumb|In March 2002, a U.S. Navy Recruit Division Commander conducts \"Instructional Training\" to correct substandard performance during boot camp.]]\n{{Main|Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes, Illinois}}\nThe [[United States Navy]] currently operates boot camp at Recruit Training Command Great Lakes, located at [[Naval Station Great Lakes]], near [[North Chicago, Illinois]]. Instead of having Drill Sergeants or Drill Instructors like other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, the U.S. Navy has RDCs (Recruit Division Commanders) that are assigned to each division. Training lasts approximately eight weeks (although some recruits will spend as many as nine weeks in training due to the somewhat complicated processing cycle). Days are counted by a system that lists the week and day that they are on, for example, 7-3 for week 7 day 3. The first approximate week is counted P-1, P-2, etc. which denotes that it is a processing day and does not count as part of their 8-week training period. Recruits are instructed on military drill, basic seamanship, basic shipboard damage control, firefighting, familiarization with the [[M9 pistol]] and [[Mossberg 500]] shotgun (the Navy no longer gives instruction on the [[M16 rifle|M16]] in boot camp), pass the confidence chamber (tear-gas-filled chamber), PT, and the basic essentials on Navy life. Recruits also attend many classes throughout boot camp on subjects such as Equal Opportunity, Sexual Assault Victim Intervention, [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], recognition of naval aircraft and vessels, and more. In order for recruits to pass boot camp, they are physically and mentally tested on a 12-hour exercise called Battle Stations which consists of 12 different scenarios involving firefighting, first-aid knowledge, survival at sea, mass casualties, shipboard flood control, bomb detection, and many other skills that they have been learning in the previous 7 weeks. After completion of boot camp, freshly minted Sailors are sent either to various \"A\" Schools located across the United States\u2014where they begin training to receive their [[List of United States Navy ratings|ratings]] (jobs)\u2014or to apprenticeship training, where they then enter the fleet without a designation.\n\nThe Navy formerly operated Recruit Training Centers in San Diego, California; Orlando, Florida; Meridian, Mississippi; and [[United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge|Port Deposit (Bainbridge), Maryland]]. From 1942 to 1946\u2014during and immediately following World War II\u2014the Navy had two additional training sites: Naval Training Station (USNTS) Sampson (renamed [[Sampson Air Force Base]] in 1950), near Seneca Lake, New York, where over 400,000 recruits were trained, and [[Farragut Naval Training Station]] in Bayview, Idaho.\n\n===U.S. Air Force===\n[[File:Air Force Military Training Instructor.jpg|thumb|upright|A formation of USAF airmen]]\n{{Main|United States Air Force Basic Military Training}}\nThe U.S. Air Force's Basic Military Training (BMT) is eight and a half weeks long, as they do not count the first week (\"Week 0\"). BMT is 63 calendar days long. It is conducted at [[Lackland Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. Formerly, trainees were referred to as \"Airman\" from day one of BMT. This has been changed; now, personnel are referred to as Trainees until the Airman's Coin Ceremony in the eighth week of training, when they receive their Airman's Coin.  Trainees receive military instruction (including the Air Force core values, flight and individual drill, and living area inspections), academic classes (covering topics such as Air Force history, dress and appearance, military customs and courtesies, ethics, security, and alcohol/drug abuse prevention and treatment), and field training (including protection against biological and chemical attack, basic marksmanship on the [[M4 carbine]] as well as self-aid buddy care).  Following BMT, Airmen go to a technical school (or 'tech school') where they learn the specifics of their [[Air Force Specialty Code]] (AFSC), which is equivalent to the MOS ([[Military Occupational Specialty]]) in the Army and Marines, the Navy's NEC (Naval Enlisted Classification) code, or the Coast Guard's ratings.\n\nAll non-prior-service enlistees are required to complete BMT, including those enlisting in the [[Air National Guard]] and [[Air Force Reserve Command]]. Reserve component enlistees receive the same training as their active-duty counterparts. Credit can be given on a case-by-case basis for enlistees with college credit, Eagle Scouts and service in the [[Civil Air Patrol]] qualify for promotion to E-2 ([[Airman]]) or E-3 ([[Airman First Class]]) upon graduation from BMT. The stripes are not worn until graduation, though trainees are paid at the higher pay grade.\n\nLackland AFB has been associated with BMT for almost the Air Force's entire history. From 1950 to 1956, 300,000 airmen received BMT at [[Sampson Air Force Base]] in New York.  In 1951, [[Parks Air Force Base]] in [[Dublin, California]] became a BMT center, with training beginning in March 1952. BMT at Parks AFB ceased later in the decade and the installation was transferred to the US Army in 1959. For a brief time between 1966 and 1968, the Air Force operated a second BMT at [[Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport#Amarillo Air Force Base (1951-68)|Amarillo Air Force Base]] in [[Amarillo, Texas]].\n\nUnlike the Army and Navy, but like the Marine Corps (throughout boot camp) and Coast Guard (during the first section of boot camp), trainees are required to refer to all Airmen, enlisted and NCO's as well as commissioned and warrant officers, as \"sir\" or \"ma'am\". Trainees are required to preface speaking to Military Training Instructors with their reporting statement: \"Sir/Ma'am, Trainee (the recruit's surname) reports as ordered\".\n\nAn additional 2 weeks of BMT was added to the program on November 1, 2008, extending the duration of BMT from six and a half weeks to eight and a half weeks. BMT has been tailored to incorporate some of the additional warfighting skills to coincide with increased Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) rotations and more frequent support of its sister services during those rotations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123016059|title=BMT extended, NCOs to learn new languages|date=17 July 2012|accessdate=1 January 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717031836/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123016059|archivedate=17 July 2012}}</ref> In 2015 BMT was shortened once again to seven and a half weeks. Trainees still stay at Lackland for eight and half weeks, however, the eighth week following graduation they are moved to a more relaxed environment under a program called Airman's Week, which is designed to transition trainees to technical training.\n{{clear}}\n\n===U.S. Coast Guard===\n[[File:USCG Basic Training.jpg|thumb|A Coast Guard Company Commander instructs a recruit during basic training.]]\nRecruit training for the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] is held at [[United States Coast Guard Training Center Cape May|Coast Guard Training Center Cape May]] in [[Cape May, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forcecom.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/FORCECOM-UNITS/TraCen-Cape-May/Training/applicants/|title=USCG Recruit Training|accessdate=22 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526231653/http://www.forcecom.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/FORCECOM-UNITS/TraCen-Cape-May/Training/applicants/|archive-date=26 May 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Coast Guard base on Government Island (now known as [[Coast Guard Island]]) [[Alameda, California]] was also used as a second major recruit training center until it was closed in 1982. The official standard recruit training cycle lasts eight weeks. A limited number of recruits may face reversion to earlier weeks of training should they exhibit egregious deficiencies in attitude and/or aptitude.\n  \nAs an alternate for those recruits possessing prior military service or civilian job skills, Coast Guard recruit basic training offers an abbreviated route to completion of basic training with the Direct Entry Petty Officer Training program (DEPOT) \"The goal of the Direct Entry Petty Officer Training Course is to produce petty officers who on the basis of their civilian professions, prior military experience, or a combination of both\" are otherwise duly qualified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forcecom.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/FORCECOM-UNITS/TraCen-Cape-May/Training/Depot/|title=DEPOT|accessdate=22 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711191210/http://www.forcecom.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/FORCECOM-UNITS/TraCen-Cape-May/Training/Depot/|archive-date=11 July 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCoast Guard boot camp covers basic seamanship, drill, military bearing and firefighting. The U.S. Coast Guard is unique among the armed services in that it fires the [[SIG Sauer P229|SIG Sauer P229R]] pistol as well as the [[M16 rifle]] during the training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/features/0,15240,96246,00.html|title=Military Life|last=Military.com|accessdate=1 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106114450/http://www.military.com/features/0,15240,96246,00.html|archive-date=6 November 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Coast Guard is a part of the [[Department of Homeland Security]], rather than the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], it is by law and tradition a branch of the [[United States Armed Forces]]. As with all military personnel, Coast Guardsmen are subject to the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ). Due to the Coast Guard's unique mission set \u2013 including [[CONUS]] and [[CONUS#CONUS/OCONUS|OCONUS]] defense operations, search and rescue and maritime law enforcement \u2013 there are added requirements to maintain high physical fitness standards and military bearing. Due to its unusual, diverse and difficult mission, the U.S. Coast Guard is the most selective in recruiting and training standards. As an example, the [[United States Coast Guard Academy|Coast Guard Academy]] is the only service academy that uses competitive admissions for prospective officer candidates rather than congressional appointment.\n\nDuring their time at Cape May, recruits are subjected to the usual \"boot camp\" atmosphere of direct instruction and intense motivation. Recruits must adhere to strict rules such as hygiene and uniform regulations and obey all lawful orders. The recruits are designated as Seaman Recruits (SR; E-1). Unique to the Coast Guard among the armed services, recruits successfully completing basic recruit training are advanced to the rank of Seaman Apprentice/Fireman Apprentice (SA/FA; E-2) or Seaman/Fireman (SN/FN; E-3) upon graduation\u2014the difference generally based on level of higher education the graduate possesses. Coast Guard drill instructors are called \"company commanders\" and hold a rank ranging from Petty Officer 2nd Class (E-5) up to Senior Chief Petty Officer (E-8). Coast Guard companies have approximately two or three company commanders and anywhere from 20 to over 100 recruits.\n\nAfter completing boot camp, recruits can select their rating and then attend an \"A\" school. Few graduates go straight to \"A\" school; most spend up to a year in the fleet as \"non-rates\". \"A\" school is a long-term technical school providing specific instruction about a rating. The \"A\" schools last two to six months and usually occur at [[Training Center Yorktown|TRACEN Yorktown]], [[Yorktown, Virginia]] or [[Training Center Petaluma|TRACEN Petaluma]], [[Petaluma, California]]. Aviation related ratings train at the Aviation Technical Training Center at [[Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City]], [[North Carolina]]. Some ratings have an available on-the-job apprenticeship training option known as \"striking\" instead of attending an \"A\" school.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Military education and training]]\n*[[Milling (military training exercise)|Milling]] - military training exercise\n*[[Military Academy]]\n*[[Officer Candidate School]]\n*[[Resocialization]]\n*[[Psychological conditioning]]\n*[[Military recruitment]]\n*[[Military service]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* USAREC (2003).
