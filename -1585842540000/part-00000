ScanSoft was a [[Xerox]] spin-off that was bought in 1999 by [[Visioneer]], a hardware and software scanner company, which adopted ScanSoft as the new merged company name. The original ScanSoft had its roots in [[Raymond Kurzweil#Mid-life|Kurzweil Computer Products]].\n\n==History==\nIn September 2005, ScanSoft Inc. acquired and merged with Nuance Communications, and the resulting company adopted the Nuance name. For a decade prior to that, the two companies competed in the commercial large-scale speech application business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== ScanSoft origins ===\nIn 1974, [[Raymond Kurzweil]] founded the '''Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc.''' to develop the first omni-font optical character-recognition system{{snd}}a computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font.<ref name=\"Kurzweil\">[http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/speechsynthesis/ss_kurz.htm \"Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc.\"] ''Smithsonian Speech Synthesis History Project (SSSHP) 1986\u20132002''</ref> In 1980, Kurzweil sold his company to Xerox.<ref name=\"Kurzweil\"/>  The company became known as Xerox Imaging Systems (XIS), and later ScanSoft.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn March 1992, a new company called [[Visioneer|Visioneer, Inc.]] was founded to develop scanner hardware and software products, such as a sheetfed scanner called PaperMax<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/941128/archive_013727_3.htm |title= Neat Gadgets to Drool Over |date=November 20, 1994 |first1=Mary Kathleen |last1=Flynn |first2=Leonard |last2=Wiener |publisher=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013202908/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/941128/archive_013727_3.htm |archivedate=2012-10-13}}</ref> and the document management software [[PaperPort]]. Visioneer eventually sold its hardware division to Primax Electronics, Ltd. in January 1999.  Two months later, in March, Visioneer acquired ScanSoft from Xerox to form a new public company with ScanSoft as the new company-wide name.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nPrior to 2001, ScanSoft focused primarily on desktop imaging software such as TextBridge,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100104201733/http://www.nuance.com/textbridge TextBridge Pro 11]</ref> PaperPort and [[OmniPage]]. Beginning with the December 2001 acquisition of [[Lernout & Hauspie]], the company moved into the speech recognition business and began to compete with Nuance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== Nuance history prior to the 2005 merger with ScanSoft ===\nNuance was founded in 1994 as a spin-off of [[SRI International]]'s Speech Technology and Research (STAR) Laboratory to commercialize the speaker-independent speech recognition technology developed for the US government at SRI. Based in [[Menlo Park, California]], Nuance deployed their first commercial large-scale speech application in 1996. Their initial route to market was through call center automation. Call centers had just centralized the branch-office telephone handling function throughout many large companies. The highest cost of running call centers is the cost of staff. Early projects were completely developed by Nuance to prove the commercial practicality and benefits.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nEarly Nuance applications ran on Windows NT-based and Solaris operating systems, and commonly relied on [[Eicon|Dialogic]] boards for the telephony hardware.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn 1994, Nuance was spun off from SRI's STAR Lab. Two years later, Nuance deployed its first commercial speech application. On 13 April 2000, Nuance filed an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) on the NASDAQ under the symbol NUAN. On 15 November 2000, Nuance acquired SpeechFront voice instant messaging company for $10.5 million in cash and stock.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n<!--* ''(Description/chronology of Nuance's actual speech product offerings needed!)''-->\n\nIn simple terms, the technology produced allowed a computer to determine what a speaker was saying within a specific and limited vocabulary of phrases. Its key advantage over technologies such as [[ViaVoice]] was that the system did not need training for the specific speaker. This permitted the use of the system, so-called speaker-independent natural-language [[speech recognition]] (abbreviated as SI-NLSR or just NLSR), for call automation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe limited vocabulary was typically a few thousand different variations of phrases. In complex systems this could be in the low millions. At the time, these systems were pushing the limits of computer processing power in commodity [[Intel]] [[x86]] servers until the early 2000s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nDuring the late 1990s and into the 2000s, Nuance competed against other NLSR vendors including [[Dragon Systems|Dragon]], [[Philips]] SpeechPearl, [[SpeechWorks]] and other smaller players which were typically geographically focused, such as [[Vocalis plc|Vocalis]] in the UK which used proprietary PCI cards with DSPs on board to improve the efficiency and density of the system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nEach speech-recognition engine provider had to determine how to convert written text into sounds. Determining how written text is spoken is a hugely challenging task in itself. Languages are \"modeled\", samples of real spoken language is recorded and analyzed to create a language model. The higher the quality the language model the better the experience of the user, especially in complex interactions. Different language models were required for different dialects such as Flemish, which is a variant of [[Dutch language|Dutch]], or [[Swiss Germa]]n, a dialect of [[High German]]. Different models were also created for different qualities of the telephone connection. Europe's [[Philips]] had by far the largest language coverage, which included [[Flemish]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nLater, Nuance sold licenses (training and consulting) to their technology to third parties, including independent software vendors and [[interactive voice response]] (IVR) vendors who would build applications on top of an IVR platform. SpeechWorks, on the other hand, would typically deliver the application with the technology or with a group of key delivery partners. The technology was integrated into most of the leading IVR products from Avaya, Nortel Periphonics, Envox, Syntellect and many others. The requirements of telephony reliability meant many of these solutions ran on various versions of UNIX.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nNuance 7 was launched in the late 1990s and was an efficient network-distributed NLSR speech recognition solution; it ran on Unix and Windows.  Nuance 8 added [[Language model|Statistical Language Modeling]], an adaption of technologies used in technologies, such as ViaVoice to improve the range of phrases that the system could recognize at the expense of greater implementation cost and complexity. Nuance 8.x series also introduced the W3C vocabulary definition language GrXML in addition to and eventual replacement of Nuance's proprietary and very concise Grammar Specification Language, GSL.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nNuance 8.5 was the last point release before the takeover by ScanSoft. These systems were significantly different from the technology used in consumer speech recognition products such as [[ViaVoice]], which is now also a Nuance product.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nWhile Nuance marketed their technology at call-center exhibitions, they rarely delivered solutions directly. Instead, Nuance relied on telecommunications partners, such as Nortel Periphonics, Avaya and Syntellect. Nuance realized that designing and developing speech-based solutions requires a different skill set and to that of traditional [[DTMF]] solutions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nFor a couple of years prior to the takeover by ScanSoft, Nuance started selling products directly, including their call-routing product (\"Call Steering\"), which determined the \"skill group\" required for the call based on responses to reasonably open questions asked of the caller.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nNuance 9.0 is the first release (excluding service packs) of the recognizer product since the acquisition and is an amalgam of the technologies acquired from various companies including Philips Speech Pearl, Speechworks, Nuance Recognizer and others.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==== Partnership with the Siri and Apple Inc. ====\n[[Siri]] is an application that combines speech recognition with advanced natural-language processing. The artificial intelligence, which required both advances in the underlying algorithms and leaps in processing power both on mobile devices and the servers that share the workload, allows software to understand words and their intentions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wildstrom|first=Steve|title=Nuance Exec on iPhone 4s, Siri, and the Future of Speech|url=http://techpinions.com/nuance-exec-on-iphone-4s-siri-and-the-future-of-speech/3307|publisher=TechPinions|accessdate=10 October 2011 |quote=[Vladimir Sejnoha] declined to discuss Nuance's role in the iPhone 4S}}</ref>\n\n==== Telephony application process ====\n* User invokes the telephony application for call automation\n* Application loads the phrases for the application and prompts the user to ask a question, opening a stream from the telephony input to the speech recognition software.\n* User speaks and this is streamed to the recognizer.\n* Recognizer returns a number of potential results with probability for each one that it is correct.\n\n==== Recognizer process ====\n* Determines the start of speech input\n* uses audio techniques to remove background noise\n* slices the audio into small sections (10 to 100 ms in length)\n* determines the sound in each slice\n* matches the combination of sounds for the spoken phrase with the possible sound combinations provided by the possible phrases{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Topology ===\nA typical Nuance recognizer configuration required four or five applications to be started, often monitored by a sixth application.\n*NLM: Nuance License Manager: kept a watch on the number of concurrent speech calls in use.\n*Nrecclient: recognition client: it is the interface between the IVR speech path and the speech recognizing software, the recserver.

The resource manager directs which resources it thinks are least utilized.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Acquisitions===\nPrior to the 2005 merger, ScanSoft acquired other companies to expand its business.  Unlike ScanSoft, Nuance did not actively acquire companies prior to their merger other than the notable acquisition of Rhetorical Systems in November 2004 for $6.7m.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/nuance-acquires-rhetorical-systems--785480f1|title=Nuance Communications acquires Rhetorical Systems|website=Crunchbase}}</ref> After the merger, the company continued to grow through acquisition.\n\n====ScanSoft acquisitions prior to the merger====\n* March 2000 \u2013 Caere Corp., of [[Los Gatos, California]] \u2013 $145 million.

ScanSoft was a [[Xerox]] spin-off that was bought in 1999 by [[Visioneer]], a hardware and software scanner company, which adopted ScanSoft as the new merged company name. The original ScanSoft had its roots in [[Raymond Kurzweil#Mid-life|Kurzweil Computer Products]].\n\n==History==\nIn September 2005, ScanSoft Inc. acquired and merged with Nuance Communications, and the resulting company adopted the Nuance name. For a decade prior to that, the two companies competed in the commercial large-scale speech application business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== ScanSoft origins ===\nIn 1974, [[Raymond Kurzweil]] founded the '''Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc.''' to develop the first omni-font optical character-recognition system{{snd}}a computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font.<ref name=\"Kurzweil\">[http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/speechsynthesis/ss_kurz.htm \"Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc.\"] ''Smithsonian Speech Synthesis History Project (SSSHP) 1986\u20132002''</ref> In 1980, Kurzweil sold his company to Xerox.<ref name=\"Kurzweil\"/>  The company became known as Xerox Imaging Systems (XIS), and later ScanSoft.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn March 1992, a new company called [[Visioneer|Visioneer, Inc.]] was founded to develop scanner hardware and software products, such as a sheetfed scanner called PaperMax<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/941128/archive_013727_3.htm |title= Neat Gadgets to Drool Over |date=November 20, 1994 |first1=Mary Kathleen |last1=Flynn |first2=Leonard |last2=Wiener |publisher=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013202908/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/941128/archive_013727_3.htm |archivedate=2012-10-13}}</ref> and the document management software [[PaperPort]]. Visioneer eventually sold its hardware division to Primax Electronics, Ltd. in January 1999.  Two months later, in March, Visioneer acquired ScanSoft from Xerox to form a new public company with ScanSoft as the new company-wide name.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nPrior to 2001, ScanSoft focused primarily on desktop imaging software such as TextBridge,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100104201733/http://www.nuance.com/textbridge TextBridge Pro 11]</ref> PaperPort and [[OmniPage]]. Beginning with the December 2001 acquisition of [[Lernout & Hauspie]], the company moved into the speech recognition business and began to compete with Nuance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== Nuance history prior to the 2005 merger with ScanSoft ===\nNuance was founded in 1994 as a spin-off of [[SRI International]]'s Speech Technology and Research (STAR) Laboratory to commercialize the speaker-independent speech recognition technology developed for the US government at SRI. Based in [[Menlo Park, California]], Nuance deployed their first commercial large-scale speech application in 1996. Their initial route to market was through call center automation. Call centers had just centralized the branch-office telephone handling function throughout many large companies. The highest cost of running call centers is the cost of staff. Early projects were completely developed by Nuance to prove the commercial practicality and benefits.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nEarly Nuance applications ran on Windows NT-based and Solaris operating systems, and commonly relied on [[Eicon|Dialogic]] boards for the telephony hardware.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn 1994, Nuance was spun off from SRI's STAR Lab. Two years later, Nuance deployed its first commercial speech application. On 13 April 2000, Nuance filed an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) on the NASDAQ under the symbol NUAN. On 15 November 2000, Nuance acquired SpeechFront voice instant messaging company for $10.5 million in cash and stock.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n<!--* ''(Description/chronology of Nuance's actual speech product offerings needed!)''-->\n\nIn simple terms, the technology produced allowed a computer to determine what a speaker was saying within a specific and limited vocabulary of phrases. Its key advantage over technologies such as [[ViaVoice]] was that the system did not need training for the specific speaker. This permitted the use of the system, so-called speaker-independent natural-language [[speech recognition]] (abbreviated as SI-NLSR or just NLSR), for call automation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe limited vocabulary was typically a few thousand different variations of phrases. In complex systems this could be in the low millions. At the time, these systems were pushing the limits of computer processing power in commodity [[Intel]] [[x86]] servers until the early 2000s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nDuring the late 1990s and into the 2000s, Nuance competed against other NLSR vendors including [[Dragon Systems|Dragon]], [[Philips]] SpeechPearl, [[SpeechWorks]] and other smaller players which were typically geographically focused, such as [[Vocalis plc|Vocalis]] in the UK which used proprietary PCI cards with DSPs on board to improve the efficiency and density of the system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nEach speech-recognition engine provider had to determine how to convert written text into sounds. Determining how written text is spoken is a hugely challenging task in itself. Languages are \"modeled\", samples of real spoken language is recorded and analyzed to create a language model. The higher the quality the language model the better the experience of the user, especially in complex interactions. Different language models were required for different dialects such as Flemish, which is a variant of [[Dutch language|Dutch]], or [[Swiss Germa]]n, a dialect of [[High German]]. Different models were also created for different qualities of the telephone connection. Europe's [[Philips]] had by far the largest language coverage, which included [[Flemish]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nLater, Nuance sold licenses (training and consulting) to their technology to third parties, including independent software vendors and [[interactive voice response]] (IVR) vendors who would build applications on top of an IVR platform. SpeechWorks, on the other hand, would typically deliver the application with the technology or with a group of key delivery partners. The technology was integrated into most of the leading IVR products from Avaya, Nortel Periphonics, Envox, Syntellect and many others. The requirements of telephony reliability meant many of these solutions ran on various versions of UNIX.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nNuance 7 was launched in the late 1990s and was an efficient network-distributed NLSR speech recognition solution; it ran on Unix and Windows.  Nuance 8 added [[Language model|Statistical Language Modeling]], an adaption of technologies used in technologies, such as ViaVoice to improve the range of phrases that the system could recognize at the expense of greater implementation cost and complexity. Nuance 8.x series also introduced the W3C vocabulary definition language GrXML in addition to and eventual replacement of Nuance's proprietary and very concise Grammar Specification Language, GSL.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nNuance 8.5 was the last point release before the takeover by ScanSoft. These systems were significantly different from the technology used in consumer speech recognition products such as [[ViaVoice]], which is now also a Nuance product.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nWhile Nuance marketed their technology at call-center exhibitions, they rarely delivered solutions directly. Instead, Nuance relied on telecommunications partners, such as Nortel Periphonics, Avaya and Syntellect. Nuance realized that designing and developing speech-based solutions requires a different skill set and to that of traditional [[DTMF]] solutions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nFor a couple of years prior to the takeover by ScanSoft, Nuance started selling products directly, including their call-routing product (\"Call Steering\"), which determined the \"skill group\" required for the call based on responses to reasonably open questions asked of the caller.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nNuance 9.0 is the first release (excluding service packs) of the recognizer product since the acquisition and is an amalgam of the technologies acquired from various companies including Philips Speech Pearl, Speechworks, Nuance Recognizer and others.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==== Partnership with the Siri and Apple Inc. ====\n[[Siri]] is an application that combines speech recognition with advanced natural-language processing. The artificial intelligence, which required both advances in the underlying algorithms and leaps in processing power both on mobile devices and the servers that share the workload, allows software to understand words and their intentions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wildstrom|first=Steve|title=Nuance Exec on iPhone 4s, Siri, and the Future of Speech|url=http://techpinions.com/nuance-exec-on-iphone-4s-siri-and-the-future-of-speech/3307|publisher=TechPinions|accessdate=10 October 2011 |quote=[Vladimir Sejnoha] declined to discuss Nuance's role in the iPhone 4S}}</ref>\n\n==== Telephony application process ====\n* User invokes the telephony application for call automation\n* Application loads the phrases for the application and prompts the user to ask a question, opening a stream from the telephony input to the speech recognition software.\n* User speaks and this is streamed to the recognizer.\n* Recognizer returns a number of potential results with probability for each one that it is correct.\n\n==== Recognizer process ====\n* Determines the start of speech input\n* uses audio techniques to remove background noise\n* slices the audio into small sections (10 to 100 ms in length)\n* determines the sound in each slice\n* matches the combination of sounds for the spoken phrase with the possible sound combinations provided by the possible phrases{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Topology ===\nA typical Nuance recognizer configuration required four or five applications to be started, often monitored by a sixth application.\n*NLM: Nuance License Manager: kept a watch on the number of concurrent speech calls in use.\n*Nrecclient: recognition client: it is the interface between the IVR speech path and the speech recognizing software, the recserver.

The resource manager directs which resources it thinks are least utilized.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Acquisitions===\nPrior to the 2005 merger, ScanSoft acquired other companies to expand its business.  Unlike ScanSoft, Nuance did not actively acquire companies prior to their merger other than the notable acquisition of Rhetorical Systems in November 2004 for $6.7m.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/nuance-acquires-rhetorical-systems--785480f1|title=Nuance Communications acquires Rhetorical Systems|website=Crunchbase}}</ref> After the merger, the company continued to grow through acquisition.\n\n====ScanSoft acquisitions prior to the merger====\n* March 2000 \u2013 Caere Corp., of [[Los Gatos, California]] \u2013 $145 million.

The plot follows two theatre critics named Moon and Birdboot who are watching a ludicrous setup of a country house [[murder mystery]], in the style of a [[whodunit]]. By chance, they become involved in the action causing a series of events that parallel the play they are watching.\n\nThe play was written between 1961 and 1962, drawing on Stoppard's experiences as a [[Bristol]] theatre critic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hodgson|first=Terry|title=The plays of Tom Stoppard: for stage, radio, TV and film|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=1-84046-241-8}}</ref> It was initially named ''The Stand-ins'' and later, ''The Critics''. It is a [[parody]] of the stereotypical parlor mystery in the style of [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[The Mousetrap]]'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Anthony|title=The theatre of Tom Stoppard|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> as well as of the critics watching the play, with their personal desires and obsessions interwoven into their bombastic and pompous reviews. The title is a direct reference to the ending of ''The Mousetrap'', a play well known for guarding the secrecy of its [[twist ending]], although the producers of Agatha Christie's play could not publicly object without drawing even more attention to the fact.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n''The Real Inspector Hound'', much like Stoppard's earlier play ''[[Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', examines the ideas of [[destiny|fate]] and free will, as well as exploring the themes of the '[[play within a play]]'.\n\nStoppard's play is an example of [[absurdism]] as well as [[farce]], [[parody]], and satire.\n\n==Setting: Place and time==\n\nWhile the story is set in a theatre, the play within the play is set in Muldoon Manor, a lavish manor surrounded by \"desolate marshes\" and \"treacherous swamps\" and paradoxically also located near a cliff. It is a direct parody of Agatha Christie\u2019s \"closed\" settings in which no one can enter or leave, so the characters know that the murderer must be one of them.\n\nThe manor itself is described as having French windows and a large settee. The play is set, as spoken by Mrs Drudge, in the \"drawing room of Lady Muldoon\u2019s country residence one morning in early spring.\"\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Critics===\n\n'''Moon''' \u2013 a second-string theatre critic, called to the production to review it in the absence of Higgs, another critic. Moon's jealousy of Higgs' superior reputation seems to make him question his own purpose, with Moon's ultimate thoughts being of Higgs' death.\n\n'''Birdboot''' \u2013 a theatre critic and a womaniser, who catapults young actresses to stardom by delivering dazzling reviews in return, we assume, for sexual favours.  While married to Myrtle, he is having an affair with the actress who plays Felicity in the play within the play.\n\n'''Higgs''' \u2013 the senior critic, Moon is his stand-in.\n\n'''Puckeridge''' \u2013 the third-string theatre critic, or Moon's stand-in.  In early versions of the play, this character was called \"McCafferty\".\n\n===Play-within-a-play characters===\n\n'''Mrs Drudge''' \u2013 The maid, or char, of Muldoon Manor. One of Stoppard's primary vehicles for emphasising the satirical character of the story. Her [[cockney accent]] adds to the humour of Stoppard's play.\n\n'''Simon Gascoyne''' \u2013 New to the neighbourhood, Simon has had affairs with both Felicity and Cynthia. He takes an instant dislike to Magnus, as they are both in love with Cynthia. Later in the play, Birdboot assumes the role of Simon Gascoyne, and vice versa.\n\n'''Felicity Cunningham''' \u2013 A beautiful, innocent, young friend of Cynthia's who has had an affair with Simon and Birdboot. She is seemingly sweet and charming, but soon seeks ruthless revenge.\n\n'''Cynthia Muldoon''' \u2013 Apparent widow of Lord Albert Muldoon who disappeared ten years ago. She claims to be very upset about her husband's disappearance, but the audience is led to think otherwise. Sophisticated and beautiful. She has had an affair with Simon.\n\n'''Major Magnus Muldoon''' \u2013 Lord Albert Muldoon's crippled half-brother who just arrived from Canada. Has a desire for his late brother's widow, Cynthia. Takes an instant dislike to Simon, as they are both in love with Cynthia.\n\n'''Inspector Hound''' \u2013 Appears from outside the house in the middle of the play to investigate an alleged phone call. Moon assumes this role near the end of the play, and vice versa.\n\n==Detailed summary==\n''The Real Inspector Hound'' opens with two theatre critics, Moon and Birdboot. Since Moon's superior, Higgs, is unavailable, Moon is called upon to review the production. The other critic, Birdboot, seems to have an interest in the young actress playing Felicity Cunningham. Birdboot states that he is a \"respectable married man\", yet Moon's comments direct the audience to doubt this statement.\n\nThe play within the play is set in \"Lady Muldoon's country residence one morning in early spring\" and opens with a body lying on an otherwise empty stage. The help, Mrs. Drudge, gravitates to the radio, oblivious to the corpse, and turns it on just in time for an overly expository police message explaining that police are searching for an escaped madman in the swamps surrounding the manor. Simon, a mysterious young man new in the neighbourhood, enters the house, and it is revealed that he has dumped Felicity Cunningham for her friend Cynthia Muldoon, lady of the house. In the audience, Birdboot has mentally done the same. Major Magnus Muldoon, Cynthia's brother-in-law, is also in love with Cynthia. Eventually Inspector Hound from the police force arrives on the scene, apparently searching for the madman, and the company finally notices the body. The company splits up to look for a man of suspicion, when Simon is left alone on stage with the body, he bends over it and seems to recognise the victim, at which point he is shot by an unknown assailant.\n\nDuring the play the two theatre critics discuss things they may write about this typical whodunit, but they are often sidetracked by their soliloquies, Moon's concerning his professional jealousy of Higgs and Birdboot's concerning his newly found \"love\", the actress playing Cynthia. As they talk, the telephone on stage begins to ring incessantly until Birdboot cannot stand it any more. He walks up on stage to answer it only to discover that Birdboot's wife, Myrtle, is on the line. Birdboot speaks to her and as he hangs up, the play suddenly starts again and he gets trapped in it, mistaken for Simon, leading to his inevitable demise as he executes the role to its end, just after recognising the dead body onstage as Higgs, the first string critic who was unavailable that night. Moon ascends the stage to unravel Birdboot's death, taking on the role of Inspector Hound. Major Magnus accuses Moon of being the madman, since he is not the real Inspector Hound, and he tries to run but Magnus shoots him. As Moon lies dying on the floor, Magnus reveals himself to not only be the real Inspector Hound but also Cynthia's lost husband, Albert, who had disappeared ten years earlier.

The plot follows two theatre critics named Moon and Birdboot who are watching a ludicrous setup of a country house [[murder mystery]], in the style of a [[whodunit]]. By chance, they become involved in the action causing a series of events that parallel the play they are watching.\n\nThe play was written between 1961 and 1962, drawing on Stoppard's experiences as a [[Bristol]] theatre critic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hodgson|first=Terry|title=The plays of Tom Stoppard: for stage, radio, TV and film|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=1-84046-241-8}}</ref> It was initially named ''The Stand-ins'' and later, ''The Critics''. It is a [[parody]] of the stereotypical parlor mystery in the style of [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[The Mousetrap]]'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Anthony|title=The theatre of Tom Stoppard|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> as well as of the critics watching the play, with their personal desires and obsessions interwoven into their bombastic and pompous reviews. The title is a direct reference to the ending of ''The Mousetrap'', a play well known for guarding the secrecy of its [[twist ending]], although the producers of Agatha Christie's play could not publicly object without drawing even more attention to the fact.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n''The Real Inspector Hound'', much like Stoppard's earlier play ''[[Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', examines the ideas of [[destiny|fate]] and free will, as well as exploring the themes of the '[[play within a play]]'.\n\nStoppard's play is an example of [[absurdism]] as well as [[farce]], [[parody]], and satire.\n\n==Setting: Place and time==\n\nWhile the story is set in a theatre, the play within the play is set in Muldoon Manor, a lavish manor surrounded by \"desolate marshes\" and \"treacherous swamps\" and paradoxically also located near a cliff. It is a direct parody of Agatha Christie\u2019s \"closed\" settings in which no one can enter or leave, so the characters know that the murderer must be one of them.\n\nThe manor itself is described as having French windows and a large settee. The play is set, as spoken by Mrs Drudge, in the \"drawing room of Lady Muldoon\u2019s country residence one morning in early spring.\"\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Critics===\n\n'''Moon''' \u2013 a second-string theatre critic, called to the production to review it in the absence of Higgs, another critic. Moon's jealousy of Higgs' superior reputation seems to make him question his own purpose, with Moon's ultimate thoughts being of Higgs' death.\n\n'''Birdboot''' \u2013 a theatre critic and a womaniser, who catapults young actresses to stardom by delivering dazzling reviews in return, we assume, for sexual favours.  While married to Myrtle, he is having an affair with the actress who plays Felicity in the play within the play.\n\n'''Higgs''' \u2013 the senior critic, Moon is his stand-in.\n\n'''Puckeridge''' \u2013 the third-string theatre critic, or Moon's stand-in.  In early versions of the play, this character was called \"McCafferty\".\n\n===Play-within-a-play characters===\n\n'''Mrs Drudge''' \u2013 The maid, or char, of Muldoon Manor. One of Stoppard's primary vehicles for emphasising the satirical character of the story. Her [[cockney accent]] adds to the humour of Stoppard's play.\n\n'''Simon Gascoyne''' \u2013 New to the neighbourhood, Simon has had affairs with both Felicity and Cynthia. He takes an instant dislike to Magnus, as they are both in love with Cynthia. Later in the play, Birdboot assumes the role of Simon Gascoyne, and vice versa.\n\n'''Felicity Cunningham''' \u2013 A beautiful, innocent, young friend of Cynthia's who has had an affair with Simon and Birdboot. She is seemingly sweet and charming, but soon seeks ruthless revenge.\n\n'''Cynthia Muldoon''' \u2013 Apparent widow of Lord Albert Muldoon who disappeared ten years ago. She claims to be very upset about her husband's disappearance, but the audience is led to think otherwise. Sophisticated and beautiful. She has had an affair with Simon.\n\n'''Major Magnus Muldoon''' \u2013 Lord Albert Muldoon's crippled half-brother who just arrived from Canada. Has a desire for his late brother's widow, Cynthia. Takes an instant dislike to Simon, as they are both in love with Cynthia.\n\n'''Inspector Hound''' \u2013 Appears from outside the house in the middle of the play to investigate an alleged phone call. Moon assumes this role near the end of the play, and vice versa.\n\n==Detailed summary==\n''The Real Inspector Hound'' opens with two theatre critics, Moon and Birdboot. Since Moon's superior, Higgs, is unavailable, Moon is called upon to review the production. The other critic, Birdboot, seems to have an interest in the young actress playing Felicity Cunningham. Birdboot states that he is a \"respectable married man\", yet Moon's comments direct the audience to doubt this statement.\n\nThe play within the play is set in \"Lady Muldoon's country residence one morning in early spring\" and opens with a body lying on an otherwise empty stage. The help, Mrs. Drudge, gravitates to the radio, oblivious to the corpse, and turns it on just in time for an overly expository police message explaining that police are searching for an escaped madman in the swamps surrounding the manor. Simon, a mysterious young man new in the neighbourhood, enters the house, and it is revealed that he has dumped Felicity Cunningham for her friend Cynthia Muldoon, lady of the house. In the audience, Birdboot has mentally done the same. Major Magnus Muldoon, Cynthia's brother-in-law, is also in love with Cynthia. Eventually Inspector Hound from the police force arrives on the scene, apparently searching for the madman, and the company finally notices the body. The company splits up to look for a man of suspicion, when Simon is left alone on stage with the body, he bends over it and seems to recognise the victim, at which point he is shot by an unknown assailant.\n\nDuring the play the two theatre critics discuss things they may write about this typical whodunit, but they are often sidetracked by their soliloquies, Moon's concerning his professional jealousy of Higgs and Birdboot's concerning his newly found \"love\", the actress playing Cynthia. As they talk, the telephone on stage begins to ring incessantly until Moon cannot stand it any more. He walks up on stage to answer it only to discover that Birdboot's wife, Myrtle, is on the line. Birdboot speaks to her and as he hangs up, the play suddenly starts again and he gets trapped in it, mistaken for Simon, leading to his inevitable demise as he executes the role to its end, just after recognising the dead body onstage as Higgs, the first string critic who was unavailable that night. Moon ascends the stage to unravel Birdboot's death, taking on the role of Inspector Hound. Major Magnus accuses Moon of being the madman, since he is not the real Inspector Hound, and he tries to run but Magnus shoots him. As Moon lies dying on the floor, Magnus reveals himself to not only be the real Inspector Hound but also Cynthia's lost husband, Albert, who had disappeared ten years earlier. Moon, however, also recognises him as third-string critic Puckeridge, who will now become the first-string as both Higgs and Moon are out of the way.\n\n==Premiere==\n\nThe first performance of ''The Real Inspector Hound'' took place at the [[Criterion Theatre]] in London on 17 June 1968 with the cast as follows:\n\n*Moon \u2013 [[Richard Briers]]\n*Birdboot \u2013 [[Ronnie Barker]]\n*Mrs. Drudge \u2013 [[Josephine Tewson]]\n*Simon Gascoyne \u2013 [[Robin Ellis]]\n*Felicity Cunningham \u2013 [[Patricia Shakesby]]\n*Cynthia Muldoon \u2013 [[Caroline Blakiston]]\n*Major Magnus Muldoon \u2013 [[Antony Webb]]\n*Inspector Hound \u2013 [[Hugh Walters (actor)|Hugh Walters]]\n\nThe play was directed by [[Robert Chetwyn]], while the design was completed by [[Hutchinson Stott]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External references==\n*Booth, Alison, Hunter, J P., and Mays, Kelly J, eds.

This gas is called a ''[[quark\u2013gluon plasma]]'' (QGP), since the quark-interaction charge ([[color charge]]) is mobile and quarks and gluons move around. This is possible because at a high temperature the early universe is in a different [[vacuum decay|vacuum state]], in which normal matter cannot exist but quarks and gluons can, they are [[deconfinement|deconfined]] (able to exist independently as separate unbound particles). In order to recreate this [[deconfinement|deconfined]] [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]] in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum [[energy density]]. Scientists achieve this using [[Relativistic nuclear collisions|particle collisions]] at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma which can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10<sup>-22</sup> s. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called [[hadronization]]. This is so since practically all QGP components flow out at relativistic speed. In this way, it is possible to study conditions akin to those in the early Universe at the age of 10\u201340 microseconds. \n\n[[QCD matter#Laboratory experiments|Discovery]] of this new QGP [[state of matter]] has been announced both at [[CERN]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abbott|first=Alison|year=2000|title=CERN claims first experimental creation of quark\u2013gluon plasma|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/35001196|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=403|issue=6770|pages=581\u2013581|doi=10.1038/35001196|issn=0028-0836|via=}}</ref> and at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (BNL).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacak|first=Barbara|last2=Steinberg|first2=Peter|year=2010|title=Creating the perfect liquid in heavy-ion collisions|url=http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3431330|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=63|issue=5|pages=39\u201343|doi=10.1063/1.3431330|issn=0031-9228|via=}}</ref> At this time comprehensive experimental evidence about its properties is being assembled.

Therefore, any strange quarks or antiquarks observed in experiments have been \"freshly\" made from the kinetic energy of colliding nuclei. Conveniently, the [[mass]] of strange quarks and antiquarks is equivalent to the temperature or energy at which protons, neutrons and other [[hadron]]s dissolve into quarks. This means that the abundance of strange quarks is sensitive to the conditions, structure and dynamics of the deconfined matter phase, and if their number is large it can be assumed that deconfinement conditions were reached. An even stronger signature of strangeness enhancement is the highly enhanced production of [[#Strangeness (and charm) hadronization|strange antibaryons]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|date=|year=2015|orig-year=1980|title=Extreme states of nuclear matter - 1980: From: \u201cWorkshop on Future Relativistic Heavy Ion Experiments\u201d held 7-10 October 1980 at: GSI, Darmstadt, Germany|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1140/epja/i2015-15115-y|journal=The European Physical Journal A|language=en|volume=51|issue=9|pages=115|doi=10.1140/epja/i2015-15115-y|issn=1434-6001|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|date=|year=2015|orig-year=1983|title=Strangeness and phase changes in hot hadronic matter - 1983: From: \u201cSixth High Energy Heavy Ion Study\u201d held 28 June - 1 July 1983 at: LBNL, Berkeley, CA, USA|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1140/epja/i2015-15116-x|journal=The European Physical Journal A|language=en|volume=51|issue=9|pages=116|doi=10.1140/epja/i2015-15116-x|issn=1434-6001|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Equilibrium of strangeness in quark-gluon plasma ==\n\nOne cannot assume that under all conditions the yield of strange quarks is in thermal equilibrium.

This makes it relatively easy to detect strange particles through the tracks left by their decay products. Consider as example the decay of a negatively charged [[Xi baryon]] (green in figure, dss), into a negative [[pion]] ({{Subatomic particle|Up antiquark}}d) and a neutral [[Lambda baryon]] (uds). Subsequently, the Lambda decays into a proton and another negative pion. In general this is the signature of the decay of a Xi. Although the negative [[Omega baryon]] (sss) has a similar final state decay topology, it can be clearly distinguished from the Xi because its decay products are different.\n\nMeasurement of abundant formation of Xi (uss/dss), Omega (sss) and especially their antiparticles is an important cornerstone of the claim that quark\u2013gluon plasma has been formed.<ref name=\":2\" /> This abundant formation is often presented in comparison with the scaled expectation from normal proton-proton collisions; however, such a comparison is not a necessary step in view of the large absolute yields which defy conventional model expectations.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=P.

This near energy independence of the enhancement also agrees with the quark\u2013gluon plasma approach regarding the mechanism of production of these particles and confirms that a quark\u2013gluon plasma is created over a wide range of collision energies, very probably once a minimal energy threshold is exceeded.\n\n==Horn in K-to-pi ratio and the onset of deconfinement==\n{{See also|Onset of deconfinement}}\n[[File:NA61-NA49_horn.png|thumb||280px|The ratio of mean multiplicities of positively charged [[kaon]]s and [[pion]]s as a function of collision energy in collisions of two [[lead]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and [[proton]]\u2013proton interactions]]\nOne of most interesting questions is if there is a threshold in reaction energy and/or volume size which needs to be exceeded in order to form a domain in which quarks can move freely.

Among these, heavy mesons composed of strange quarks and a heavy quark, such as [[Bottomness|bottom]] ({{Subatomic particle|Strange B|link=yes}}) or [[Charm quark|charm]] ({{Subatomic particle|Strange D|link=yes}}), are of particular interest.  The coincident high yield of charm and strangeness present at LHC will lead to copious production of {{Subatomic particle|Strange D}}.  Other heavy flavor particles, some which have not even been discovered at this time are also likely to appear.

In order to recreate this [[deconfinement|deconfined]] [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]] in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum [[energy density]]. Scientists achieve this using [[Relativistic nuclear collisions|particle collisions]] at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma which can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10<sup>-22</sup> s. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called [[hadronization]]. This is so since practically all QGP components flow out at relativistic speed.

This makes it relatively easy to detect strange particles through the tracks left by their decay products. Consider as example the decay of a negatively charged [[Xi baryon]] (green in figure, dss), into a negative [[pion]] ({{Subatomic particle|Up antiquark}}d) and a neutral [[Lambda baryon]] (uds). Subsequently, the Lambda decays into a proton and another negative pion. In general this is the signature of the decay of a Xi. Although the negative [[Omega baryon]] (sss) has a similar final state decay topology, it can be clearly distinguished from the Xi because its decay products are different.\n\nMeasurement of abundant formation of Xi (uss/dss), Omega (sss) and especially their antiparticles is an important cornerstone of the claim that quark\u2013gluon plasma has been formed.<ref name=\":2\" /> This abundant formation is often presented in comparison with the scaled expectation from normal proton-proton collisions; however, such a comparison is not a necessary step in view of the large absolute yields which defy conventional model expectations.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=P.

This near energy independence of the enhancement also agrees with the quark\u2013gluon plasma approach regarding the mechanism of production of these particles and confirms that a quark\u2013gluon plasma is created over a wide range of collision energies, very probably once a minimal energy threshold is exceeded.\n\n==Horn in K-to-pi ratio and the onset of deconfinement==\n{{See also|Onset of deconfinement}}\n[[File:NA61-NA49_horn.png|thumb||280px|The ratio of mean multiplicities of positively charged [[kaon]]s and [[pion]]s as a function of collision energy in collisions of two [[lead]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and [[proton]]\u2013proton interactions]]\nOne of most interesting questions is if there is a threshold in reaction energy and/or volume size which needs to be exceeded in order to form a domain in which quarks can move freely.

As the fireball of matter expands and breaks apart, this, in turn, provides a very high abundance of strange hadrons.  Among these, heavy mesons composed of strange quarks and a heavy quark, such as [[Bottomness|bottom]] ({{Subatomic particle|Strange B|link=yes}}) or [[Charm quark|charm]] ({{Subatomic particle|Strange D|link=yes}}), are of particular interest.  The coincident high yield of charm and strangeness present at LHC will lead to copious production of {{Subatomic particle|Strange D}}.  Other heavy flavor particles, some which have not even been discovered at this time are also likely to appear.  In that way, the Strangeness has turned today more generally into the Quark Flavor signature of quark\u2013gluon plasma.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=I. Kuznetsova\n |author2=J.

The work in this field today focuses on the theoretical interpretation of the overall particle production data and the derivation of the resulting properties of the bulk of quark\u2013gluon plasma at the time of breakup. The global description of all produced particles can be attempted based on the picture of hadronizing hot drop of quark\u2013gluon plasma or, alternatively, on the picture of confined and equilibrated hadron matter. In both cases one describes the data within the statistical thermal production model, but considerable differences in detail differentiate the nature of the source of these particles. The experimental groups working in the field also like to develop their own analysis models and the outside observer sees many different analysis results. For this reason the presentation of the experimental results was made above without a comparison of data to model, so that the results following the pattern predicted can speak for themselves. There are as many as 10 different particles species which follow the pattern predicted for the QGP as function of reaction energy, reaction centrality, and strangeness content. At yet higher LHC energies saturation of strangeness yield and binding to heavy flavor open new experimental opportunities.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quark\u2013gluon plasma]]\n* [[Quark matter]]\n* [[Hadronization]]\n* [[Strangelet]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{physics-footer}}\n{{Phase of matter}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Strangeness Production}}\n[[Category:Strangeness production| ]]\n[[Category:Strange quark|Production]]\n[[Category:Particle physics]]\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Quantum chromodynamics]]\n[[Category:Plasma physics]]\n[[Category:Phases of matter]]\n[[Category:Exotic matter]]\n", "name_user": "Bibliophilen", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangeness_production"}
