Although recent models have shared this chassis with other vehicles produced by Nissan (most notably the European [[Nissan 180SX#RS13U|200SX]] and North American [[Nissan 240SX|240SX]] in the S13 and S14 generations, and [[Nissan 180SX|180SX]] in the Japanese market), the name ''Silvia'' is interchangeable with the chassis codes. The Nissan Silvia's main competitors worldwide were the [[Honda Prelude]], [[Mazda MX-6]], [[Toyota Celica]], [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]], [[Isuzu Impulse]], [[Subaru Impreza]] and [[Honda Integra]].\n\nThe \"Silvia\" name is a variation of the word \"[[Typical warbler|sylvia]]\", which is a scientific [[genus]] term assigned to a class of birds, possibly a reference to the [[Nissan Bluebird|Bluebird]] which was in production at the time the Silvia was introduced.\n\n== CSP311 ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Nissan Silvia CSP311.jpg\n| caption = Nissan Silvia (CSP311)\n| name = Nissan Silvia (CSP311)\n| assembly = [[Hiratsuka, Kanagawa]] ([[Nissan Shatai]] Plant)\n| aka = Datsun 1600 Coupe<ref>Australian Motor Manual's 1967 Road Test Annual, page 40</ref>\n| production = {{unbulleted list|1965\u20131968|554 produced<ref>[http://www.earlydatsun.com/nissancsp311.html ''1965 Nissan Silvia CSP311'', www.earlydatsun.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524103330/http://www.earlydatsun.com/nissancsp311.html |date=2017-05-24 }} Retrieved on 15 February 2015</ref>}}\n| engine = 1.6&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan H engine#H16(R16|R]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n| length = {{convert|3985|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1508|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1275|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| platform = [[Datsun Sports#SP311|Datsun CSP311 platform]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[coupe]]\n| weight = {{convert|977|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2280|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| related = [[Datsun Sports#SP311/SPL311|Datsun Fairlady SP311]]\n}}\nThe Nissan Silvia CSP311 made its public debut at the [[Tokyo Motor Show#1964|Tokyo Motor Show]] in September 1964 as the \"Datsun Coupe 1500\". The introductory model was a hand-built coupe based on the [[Datsun Sports|Fairlady]] convertible, styled with input from Count [[Albrecht Goertz]]. Its appearance is similar to the [[Lancia Fulvia#Coup\u00e9|Lancia Fulvia coupe]]. The CSP311 was powered by the 96&nbsp;hp 1.6&nbsp;L [[Nissan H engine#R|Nissan R series engine]]. The engine was equipped with twin [[SU carburetor]]s. Production ceased in 1968 after a mere 554 were made (mainly in 1965), each one of them unique with body panels crafted by hand. Most of the vehicles remained in [[Japan]]; however, 49 examples were exported to [[Australia]] and another 10 went to other countries.\n\nThe low production numbers and tedious method of construction assured that each car was unique and valuable; this is reflected by the car's purchase price of almost twice as much as the next model in the manufacturer's lineup at the time. After production ceased in 1968, the ''Silvia'' nameplate would not grace another Nissan vehicle until 1974. Its marketing approach was similar to the [[Isuzu 117 Coup\u00e9]]. In Japan, it was sold at [[Nissan Bluebird Store]] locations, and was marketed with the \"Nissan\" name instead of the more widely used \"Datsun\" brand name.\n{{Clear}}\n{{anchor|S10}}\n\n== S10 ==\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Nissan New Silvia.jpg\n| name = Nissan Silvia (S10)\n| production = 1975\u20131979\n|assembly=[[Nissan#Manufacturing locations|Zama Plant]], [[Zama, Kanagawa]], Japan\n| engine = {{unbulleted list|1.8&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan L engine#L18|L18]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] (Japan)|2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan L engine#L20B|L20B]]'' I4 (US)}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|3-speed ''[[Jatco 3N71 transmission|3N71]]'' [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]|5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]}}\n| length = {{convert|4135|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1300|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| platform= [[Nissan S platform]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[fastback]]\n| weight = {{convert|990|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2340|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| aka = {{unbulleted list|Datsun 200SX (US)|Datsun 180SX}}\n| related = [[Nissan Sunny]]\n}}\nThe S10 was the first mass-produced Silvia built on the all-new [[Nissan S platform|S platform]], intended as Nissan's compact, rear-wheel-drive, sporty car [[Automobile platform|platform]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nissan Silvia|journal=Automotive Engineering International|year=1999|volume=107|page=23|publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers}}</ref> Japanese versions were exclusive to Nissan Japanese dealerships called ''[[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan Prince Store]]'' along with the larger [[Nissan Skyline#C110|C110 Skyline]].\n\nThe S10 featured less \"traditional\" lines than similar offerings from rivals [[Toyota Celica|Toyota]] and [[Mazda Capella|Mazda]] sharing a common appearance with the larger Skyline. In Japan it was fitted with a 1.8 L [[Nissan L engine|L18]] [[Straight-4|inline-4 engine]], which it shared with the [[Nissan Bluebird|Datsun 610/Bluebird 180B]]. The Japanese version featured [[Nissan NAPS]] emission control technology at its introduction.

This model in North America was affixed with the mandated {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} bumpers and badged as the Datsun 200SX. The S10 Silvia and Datsun 200SX were based on the [[Nissan Sunny#B210 (1973\u20131977)|Datsun Sunny Coupe]]. Its success in both markets was limited, most buyers opting for the Celica over what was considered the more mundane S-Chassis. The car had the same drivetrain as the popular [[Datsun 510|510]], but with [[leaf spring]]s fitted at the rear, rather than the 510's [[independent suspension]].\n\n[[File:Nissan New Silvia2.jpg|left|thumb|Rear view]]\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== S110 ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Nissan Silvia (S110)\n| image = Silvia2000ZSE-X 04.jpg\n| caption = Nissan Silvia 2000 ZSE-X Coup\u00e9 (Japan)\n| aka = {{unbulleted list|Nissan Gazelle|Nissan 240RS (rally car)|Datsun 200SX (United States & Canada)|Datsun 180SX|Datsun Silvia<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/32109282@N00/16501605688 1981 Datsun Silvia brochure cover (France), www.flickr.com] Retrieved on 19 march 2015</ref>|Datsun Sakura (Mexico)}}\n| production = 1979\u20131983\n| assembly=[[Kanda, Fukuoka]] ([[Nissan Shatai]] Plant)\n| body_style = {{unbulleted list|2-door [[coup\u00e9]]|3-door [[hatchback]]}}\n| platform= [[Nissan S platform]]\n| related = [[Nissan Stanza]]\n| engine = {{unbulleted list|1770&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L18|L18]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] | 1770&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan Z engine#Z18|Z18/S/E]]'' I4 | 1770&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan Z engine#Z18ET|Z18ET]]'' [[Turbocharger|turbo]] I4 | 1952&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L20B|L20B]]'' I4 | 1952&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan Z engine#Z20|Z20/Z20E]]'' I4|1990&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan FJ engine#FJ20E|FJ20E]]'' [[DOHC]] I4|2188&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan Z engine#Z22E|Z22E]]'' I4|2340&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan FJ engine#FJ24|FJ24]]'' DOHC I4 (240RS)}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|3-speed automatic|5-speed manual}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1680|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1310|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1105|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\n[[File:1983 Nissan 200SX (S110), front right White.jpg|thumb|left|Datsun Silvia 180SX Hatchback (Europe)]]\n[[File:Silvia2000ZSE-X 06.jpg|thumb|left|Rear of pre-facelift Silvia 2000 ZSE-X coup\u00e9 (Japan)]]\n\nThis iteration of the Silvia (sold in [[United States]] and [[Canada]] as the '''Datsun 200SX''' and in [[Mexico]] as the '''Datsun Sakura''', [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]] for [[cherry blossom]]), available as a 2-door hardtop coupe and a new bodystyle 3-door hatchback. The Japanese market version of the hatchback was called the '''Gazelle''' and was exclusive to ''[[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan Bluebird Store]]'' locations sold alongside the [[Nissan Z-car#Second generation (S130)|Fairlady Z]], while the coupe bodystyle Silvia remained exclusive to ''Nissan Prince Store'' locations alongside the [[Nissan Skyline#C210|Skyline]]. Its sharp-edged styling was shared with the new [[Nissan Leopard]] sedan and coup\u00e9, also exclusive to ''Nissan Bluebird Store''.\n\nThis generation Silvia was uniquely progressive in that it was originally intended to feature a [[Wankel engine|rotary engine]], designed and built by Nissan. The resulting unit was fairly unreliable, and forestalled production. Coincidentally, this Silvia shares its chassis code with the [[Mazda Cosmo#Series CD (1975\u20131981)|Mazda Cosmo]], the first Japanese production car to feature a rotary engine. The chassis was shared with the B310 [[Nissan Sunny]] and the larger A10 [[Nissan Violet]] platform.\n\nThe car was redesigned shortly before it was released and the stillborn Wankel power plant was replaced by a line of [[Dual ignition|twin-plug]] conventional piston engines from the new [[Nissan Z engine|Z-series range]]. These included the Z20 and the [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] and later the [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] Z18ET, although the latter of the two was only available to the Japanese domestic market and after the mid-life facelift.

It was sold in two configurations\u2014a coupe (often called a \"notchback\" due to the side profile view of its rear window section) and a hatchback version.\n\nA number of different engines were equipped in the S12 chassis, depending on production year and more specifically on the geographic market. These engines borrowed from previous designs, or in some cases, inspired future engine platforms (with the exception of the FJ series, which was designed solely with Rally competition in mind). For instance, the CA series initially borrowed design cues from the NAP-Z series. The CA18DET's DOHC head design was similar to that utilized in the later \"RB\" engine series, the [[inline-six engine]] that powered the [[Nissan Skyline]]s. Certain trims had the S12 equipped with an optional [[V6]] engine also shared by the [[Nissan Z-car#Third generation (Z31)|300ZX (Z31)]] of the same vintage; this engine would be augmented with dual cam heads for the Z32.\n\n=== Japan ===\n[[File:Nissan-SilviaS12.jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Silvia RS-X Turbo (S12) in Japan]]\nAs with the S110, the S12 chassis in Japan was badged as both a Silvia and a Gazelle. The S12 Silvia in Japan was available in a hatchback as a basic model only, or as a coup\u00e9 (notchback) in base, RS, and RS-X trims and exclusive to ''[[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan Prince Store]]'' Japanese dealerships as a junior companion to the Nissan Skyline. The S12 Gazelle was strictly a hatchback, available in regular, RS and RS-X variants and exclusive to ''Nissan Bluebird Store locations'' as a junior companion to the Fairlady ZX. The RS was equipped with the 2.0L DOHC \"FJ\" engine [[Nissan FJ engine|(FJ20E)]], while the RS-X was equipped with the same engine in a turbocharged version [[Nissan FJ engine|(FJ20ET)]]. In 1987 Nissan discontinued the FJ Series engine in the S12 and replaced it with the CA18DET (with dual cams and a bigger turbocharger\u2014the [[Nissan CA engine|CA18DET]]. Japanese spec Gazelle models came with many options like voice command, fog lights and options for a variety of different motors (FJ20E, FJ20ET, CA18DE, CA18E, CA18DET.). The RS-X model also came with different factory alloy wheels. When the S13 Silvia was introduced in 1988 in Japan, the Gazelle nameplate was replaced with the [[Nissan 180SX]] as a junior companion to the 300ZX, although in Australia there would not be a replacement until the introduction of the Silvia-based [[Nissan 200SX]] in 1995.\n\n=== North America ===\n[[File:Nissan 200SX (2650508834).jpg|thumb|left|Nissan 200SX XE coupe with new rear lamps in Canada]]\nThe S12 Silvia brand in North America was badged as a \"200SX\". For fear that the North American market would not be as profitable as other markets throughout; without any major innovations, Nissan Executives only scheduled the manufacturing of 5k of each trim package/engine options in the final 2 years before the halt of US production, which was in 1988. The S12 \"XE\" was strictly a coupe or a \"notchback\", and was only available with a 2.0L SOHC, non-turbo engine and made available with either a 5 speed manual or 4 speed automatic gearbox. [[Nissan CA engine|(CA20E)]] The hatchback received both the 2.0L SOHC engine, and a 1.8L SOHC Turbo (non-intercooled) engine [[Nissan CA engine|(CA18ET)]]. For 1987 in the United States, Nissan discontinued the Turbo model and created the \"SE\" model which had a 3.0L SOHC [[V6 engine]] [[Nissan VG engine|(VG30E)]], generating {{convert|160|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|174|lbf.ft|abbr=on}} of torque. This was the same engine offered in the non-turbo 300ZX for that generation. For 1988 the \"SE\" model received a {{convert|5|hp|abbr=on}} gain from using the later \"W\" series revisions of the [[Nissan VG engine|VG30E]] with a total output of {{convert|165|hp|abbr=on}} while torque remained the same at {{convert|174|lbf.ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n=== Europe ===\n[[File:Silvia S12 (2).JPG|thumb|left|Nissan Silvia Hatchback in Europe]]\nThe S12 chassis in Europe was badged as a \"Silvia\", with notable exception of Sweden where it was sold as a \"180ZX\". \"ZX\" is traditionally associated with the Nissan [[Nissan Z-car|Z]] platform, this situation came about to avoid giving the car the same name as the [[Queen Silvia of Sweden|Queen of Sweden]]. The ZX name was used because Nissan's Swedish importer decided to stop carrying the 300ZX when the naturally aspirated version was discontinued for Europe; the Silvia acted as a partial replacement for the Z-car.<ref name=\"TV24.87\">{{cite journal | ref = tv24.39 | title = Nya motorer fr\u00e5n Nissan | trans-title = New engines from Nissan | language = Swedish | journal = [[Teknikens V\u00e4rld]] | publisher = Specialtidningsf\u00f6rlaget AB | location = Stockholm, Sweden | page = 20 | date = 1987-11-11 | issue = 24 | volume = 39 | first = Bj\u00f6rn | last = Svallner }}</ref>\n\nThe European S12 was available only in the hatchback configuration, few were equipped with a rally package that included a rally foot brace for the navigator, headlamp guards, headlamp dust cleaners, with the same 1.8L SOHC Turbo [[Nissan CA engine|(CA18ET)]] used in North America, and in some areas the 2.0L DOHC \"FJ\" engine [[Nissan FJ engine|(FJ20E)]]. The \"FJ\" engine series was originally designed for the 240RS rally race car as a 2.4L carburated system (FJ24), and was underbored to 2.0L.

Bumpers featured matte-finish raised surfaces, and sides featured half-inch rubstripping. Cars featured a honeycomb radiator grille, and long corner lights. The RS-X trim in Japan and Europe received a hood bulge accent to accommodate the oversized dimensions of the FJ20E/ET engine, and featured a faux front vent with monogram (either FJ20, DOHC, or TURBO); In North America, the 1984 Turbo came with a \"TURBO\" monogrammed hood bulge accent, although all subsequent North American Mark I hoods were flat regardless of trim. In some markets, the 1984 and 85 could be had with a foam rubber deck spoiler. In 1986 the foam rubber deck spoiler was changed for a fiberglass version with an integrated third brake light. Some hatchbacks and all Turbo models came with ground effects, as did the RS-X coupes These had\u009d a combination of plastic mudflaps (monogrammed as either \"NISSAN\", or \"SILVIA\" in applicable markets) and accommodating foam rubber sideskirts, as well as a foam rubber lower deflection lip. 1984 year foam rubber sideskirts featured the \"NISSAN\" monogram.\n\n==== Mark II ====\n[[File:Nissan 200SX XE (4737127343).jpg|thumb|Nissan 200SX XE hatchback with new rear lamps]]\nIn 1986, the bumpers were updated, and the matte finished surfaces were eliminated for a more uniform surface. Rubstripping was increased to 2-inch height w/ scribe detailing. The honeycomb radiator grille was replaced with a slatted version that spanned the entire front end (previous was shorter), and cornerlights were shortened. The \"SE\" model and the Turbo (Canada, Europe) came with new fiberglass ground effects and mudflaps, painted in the color of the car, and a new and more pronounced lower deflection lip in the front. All Mark II S12's received a new reverse-cowl hood bulge design to accommodate clearance for the 3.0L V6.

Based on a Mark I chassis, it was powered by the [[Nissan FJ engine|FJ20E]] (with a few known to be sold with the [[Nissan CA engine|CA18ET]]), and featured molded-in fiberglass wide body fenders and quarter sections and special edition wheels.\n\nThe widebody exterior grabs design cues from popular European rally car platforms of the time (e.g. Audi Quattro, BMW M3 Sport Evolution, Renault 5 Turbo 2, etc.), although Nissan's choice of the [[Nissan FJ engine|FJ20E]] over the [[Nissan FJ engine|FJ20ET]] suggests this was more of a \"rally inspired\" car rather than a serious performance trim. The Silvia Grand Prix holds the distinction as the rarest incarnation of the S12, and is generally considered something of a collector's item. The Mark II revision of the S12 chassis marked the end of the Silvia Grand Prix.\n\n=== Motorsports ===\n\n[[File:Nissan Slivia 200SX (RVS12) front-left.jpg|thumb|right|Nissan Silvia 200SX 1988 [[Safari Rally]] runner-up car]]\nThe elimination of [[Group B#Group B|Group B]] from the [[World Rally Championship]] signified the end of Nissan's FJ24-powered [[Nissan Silvia#Nissan 240RS|240RS]]. The FJ20ET-powered Silvia RS-X of 1986 would have been Nissan's first choice, however there was an insufficient number of that exact trim sold in Japan to meet the WRC's [[Homologation (motorsport)|Homologation]] requirements (minimum 5000 units). Nissan had to quickly find a car to replace the [[Nissan Silvia#Nissan 240RS|240RS]].\n\nThe North American 1987 200SX SE V6 was chosen and competed in 1986-89 as a 200SX. Nissan's creation and choice of this car ensured they could sell 5000 cars required for WRC [[Homologation (motorsport)|Homologation]]. The S12 \"SE\" trim's V6 held the only real appeal to the North American market, allowing Nissan to sell right at 5000 cars to a single specification. The V6 was a very unusual choice as the WRC was dominated by 4-cylinder 2.0 L turbocharged engines, although for similar reasons Toyota entered WRC with the 6-cylinder Supra at the same time. The 200SX achieved a first place in the [http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=result&rallyid=199 1988 Ivory coast rally] and second place for two years running in the very challenging [http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=result&rallyid=192 Safari Rally 1988] and [http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=result&rallyid=179 Safari Rally 1989].\n\n[[Mark Skaife]] won the [[1987 Australian 2.0 Litre Touring Car Championship]] driving a Nissan Gazelle entered by the Nissan Motor Company.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== S13 ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Nissan Silvia (S13)\n| image = Nissan 13 silvia.jpg\n| production = 1989&ndash;1994\n| body_style = 2-door [[coupe]]<br />2-door [[convertible]]<br />2-door [[Fastback]]\n| engine = {{unbulleted list | 1.8&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan CA engine#CA18DE|CA18DE]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] | 1.8&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan CA engine#CA18DET|CA18DET]]'' [[Turbocharger|turbo]] I4 | 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[SR20DE]]'' I4 | 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan SR engine#SR20DET|SR20DET]]'' turbo I4 }}\n| length = 4521 mm (178 in)\n| width = 1689 mm (66.5 in)\n| assembly = [[Kanda, Fukuoka]] ([[Nissan Shatai]] Plant)\n| height = 1290 mm (50.8 in)\n| wheelbase = 2474 mm (97.4 in)\n| weight = {{convert|1180|-|1224|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| transmission = 4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n| platform = [[Nissan S platform]]\n| related = [[Nissan 180SX]]<br />Nissan [[Nissan 180SX#RS13U|200SX]] ([[Europe]])<br />[[Nissan 240SX]] ([[North America]])<br />[[Sileighty]]\n}}\nThe S13 Silvia, introduced in mid-1988 the 1990 model year, was immensely popular in Japan. At its introduction in 1989, it won the [[Car of the Year Japan]] Award. The Silvia was no longer exported, however; rebadged [[Nissan 180SX|180SX]] were instead sold in most markets. European versions of this car were still known as [[Nissan 180SX#RS13U|200SX]]. In North America, the S13 (180SX front, all three different bodystyles) was known as the [[Nissan 240SX|240SX]]. In North America, the Nissan 200SX nameplate was on hiatus but would return on a [[Nissan Lucino|2-door coupe version]] of the B14 [[Nissan Sunny#B14 (1995\u20131999)|Nissan Sunny/Sentra]] (1995\u201399). Following industry trends, the S13 Silvia switched to relampable fixed headlights. Projector optics were offered as an option.\n\nIn Japan, Nissan renamed the Gazelle as the [[Nissan 180SX]], which was exported primarily under the name [[Nissan 240SX]]. The 180SX served as the junior companion to the Fairlady ZX at ''[[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan Bluebird Store]]'' Japanese dealerships. As before, the Silvia was exclusive to Japanese dealerships called ''Nissan Prince Store'' next to the Skyline.\n\nThe S13 Silvia coupe was made from 1988 to 1994, overlapping with the S14 Silvia introduced in 1993. The Nissan Silvia used fixed headlights; whereas, the 180SX, simply a hatchback version of the Silvia, introduced at the same time used pop-up headlights. The hatchback version, called the 180SX, replaced the Gazelle name in Japan and remained in production until 1998.\n\nThe S13 was one of the first uses of Nissan's multi-link rear suspension, the technology of which was previewed in concept cars in previous years, such as the [[Nissan MID4]]. It also offered a four-wheel steering system for the first time, known as [[HICAS]]-II. In 1990, HICAS-II was updated and renamed SuperHICAS. The S13 also saw the introduction of a viscous-type [[limited slip differential]] for some models.\n\nS13 Silvias were initially powered by the [[Nissan CA engine#CA18DE|CA18DE]] and [[Nissan CA engine#CA18DET|CA18DET]] engines carried over from the end of S12 production, with an [[intercooler]] added to the CA18DET for a slight increase in stability and power. In mid-1990, (for the 1991 model year) the [[SR20DE]] and [[Nissan SR engine#SR20DET|SR20DET]] engines debuted, offering improvements across the board in power and torque due to increased displacement and a more efficient turbocharger than was offered on the previous cars. One of the other simple changes that were made between the [[Nissan CA engine|CA]] generation and the [[Nissan SR engine|SR]] generation was the switch to a single colour paint job, instead of the two-tone colour sets that were previously offered. On top of this, the SR motor later debuted another variant of the platform known simply as the \"blacktop\". Identifiable by its black and silver rocker-cover (as opposed to the traditional red/silver cover), it featured a number of minor changes, resulting in a little performance gain. It is vastly different from the more powerful \"notch top\" used in the S14 and S15 variants.\n\nIn the U.S. the S13 was replaced after the 1994 model year by the new S14 design but lived on until 1998 in Japan with a major facelift, the 180SX Aero (Type X). This was the \"Kouki\" generation, while the previous (or 'middle') generation was referred to as \"Chuki\". The Kouki featured newly design tail lights a redesigned aero body kit and outfitted with an airbag. In 1998, the S13 Silvia was resurrected, in part. A variant was produced by [[Kid's Heart]] for Nissan called the [[Sileighty]], which featured the [[Nissan 180SX|180SX]] body with the front end from the Silvia. The Sileighty style was originally created by Japanese enthusiasts for their own 180SX's, and is still a common modification for the 180SX and [[Nissan 240SX|240SX]] fastback. The [[Sileighty]] also made an appearance in a Japanese [[anime]] and [[manga]] series known as ''[[Initial D]]''. The series (based around the Japanese motorsports of [[Touge]] and [[Drifting (motorsport)|drifting]]) featured the [[Sileighty]] in one of the last battles of the ''First Stage'' (or first season in the anime).\n\nThe creation of the [[Sileighty]] then followed by another version of the Silvia known as the Onevia. Based on the chassis of the S13, the front end of the Silvia would be removed and replaced with the front end of a [[Nissan 180SX|180SX]]. The Onevia was never retailed as a complete car in Japan (though it was in North America: the coupe version of the 240SX was essentially a left-hand drive version of the Silvia with the 180SX/240SX nose).\n\nThere was also a retro-styled car (\u00e1 la the [[Zimmer (automobile)|Zimmer Golden Spirit]]) which used the S13 Silvia's centre portion, engine, and underpinnings. It is called the [[Mitsuoka Le-Seyde]] and was built in a very limited series in 1990.\n\nThe car has also been popular with multiple diecast manufacturers like HotWheels, which have released several iterations of it over the years.[https://lamleygroup.com/2017/07/28/the-lamley-daily-2015-hot-wheels-nissan-180sx-type-x/] \n\n=== Convertible ===\nA Silvia [[convertible (car)|convertible]] was briefly offered soon after the start of production and sold in limited numbers. Demand, at the time, was low perhaps due to high cost (3.25 million [[Yen]] in 1988), heavier curb weight, and chassis flex. The Silvia convertibles were a conversion done by [[:ja:%E3%82%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%86%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A3%E3%83%91%E3%83%B3|Autech Japan, Inc.]]<ref>http://www.autech.com/history/sv/silvia_convertible_1988.html</ref> and the production was entrusted to [[:ja:%E9%AB%98%E7%94%B0%E5%B7%A5%E6%A5%AD|Takada Kogyo]] with a manufacture date of July 1988. A total of 603 Autech convertibles were produced in the following color codes: TH1 - velvet blue (430), 5G7 - green two-tone lime (50), 5H6 - warm two-tone white (70),  AH3 - cranberry red (40), and DH0 dark green (10). The other 3 were made to order for Nissan and the color is unknown. They came equipped with K series trim including the turbocharged CA18det engine. All of the 600 publicly available cars were sold with 4-speed automatic transmission.\n\nIt was unrelated to the [[Nissan_240SX#Convertible|240SX convertible]] offered in North America, which was a local conversion by [[American Specialty Cars|ASC]].\n\n[[File:S13 SILVIA CONVERTIBLE.JPG|thumb|left|One of the rare Silvia Convertibles]]\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Trim level designation ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe S13 Silvia was the first [[Nissan S platform|S-series]] car to use the ''J's'', ''Q's'', and ''K's'' designations for the different [[trim package]]s. These names are references to the face cards of English [[playing cards]].\n\nThe J's was the base model. The Q's model offered a slightly more refined experience and received electric options and an available [[Limited slip differential|LSD]]. The K's grade received the turbocharged [[Nissan CA engine#CA18DET|CA18DET]] or [[Nissan SR engine#SR20DET|SR20DET]] (depending on the year of manufacture) in addition to the options offered on the Q's.\n\nOn top of the K's and Q's models, the Club and Diamond Selection packages came with specific options bundled together. For example, all K's Club Selections came with [[Headlamp#Projector (poly-ellipsoidal) lamps|projector headlamps]], a rear spoiler, and 15\" aluminum wheels while all Q's models came out with automatic climate control.\n\nThe Silvia A's \"Almighty\" was introduced in late 1992. Trim wise, the Almighty slotted between the J's and Q's, offering options not available on J's, but not including all the standard features of the Q's. The only available engine/transmission was the naturally aspirated [[SR20DE]] coupled with the four-speed automatic or a five-speed manual.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== S14 ==\n{{about|section=yes|this vehicle's Japanese model|information on the North American model|Nissan 240SX#Second Generation / S14 (1994\u20131998)}}{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Nissan Silvia (S14)\n| image=Nissan 200SX (9639982223).jpg\n| caption=Nissan 200SX (S14)\n| production={{unbulleted list|1993&ndash;1998|1994&ndash;1998 (US)}}\n| assembly=[[Kanda, Fukuoka]] ([[Nissan Shatai]] Plant)\n| transmission={{unbulleted list|4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]|5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]}}\n| aka = {{unbulleted list|Nissan 200SX|[[Nissan 240SX#Second generation / S14 (1995\u20131998)|Nissan 240SX]] (North America)}}\n| engine={{unbulleted list|2.0&nbsp;L ''[[SR20DE]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]|2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan SR engine#SR20DET|SR20DET]]'' I4 turbo|2.4&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan KA engine#KA24DE|KA24DE]]'' I4}}\n| length=4498 mm (177.0 in)\n| width=1727 mm (68.0 in)\n| body_style=2-door [[coupe]]\n| height=1288 mm (50.7 in)\n| wheelbase=2525 mm (99.4 in)\n| platform= [[Nissan S platform]]\n| weight=1253&nbsp;kg (2762&nbsp;lb)\n}}\n\n[[File:Nissan 200SX Sportline Front.JPG|thumb|left|Nissan 200SX facelift model in Europe]]\nThe S14 Silvia debuted in Japan towards the end of 1993. It was lower and wider than the S13. New rounded styling contributed to the illusion of a greater increase in size than actually occurred. [[Wheelbase]] and track were both increased, leading to slightly improved handling. Unlike [[export]] markets, where sales of the S14 chassis variants faltered, the Silvia remained popular in Japan. However, the width dimension exceeded 1700 mm, which pushed this generation out of the [[Vehicle size class#Japan|compact class]] tax bracket, which also made Japanese buyers liable for higher [[Road tax#Japan|road taxes]]. The fastback and convertible bodystyles was discontinued internationally, leaving only the coupe in production.\n[[File:S14.jpg|left|thumb|Nissan Silvia facelift model (aka S14a) in Japan]]\nTrim level designations were similar to the S13, however the Club Selection package was dropped. \"Aero\" variants of the Q's and K's were offered that featured large rear [[Spoiler (automotive)|wings]] and mild [[ground effect in cars|ground effects]].\n\nThe S14 Silvia K's received a new version of the SR20DET, with a slight bump in power due to the implementation of Nissan's [[variable cam timing]] system known as [[N-VCT]], on the intake cam, and a larger T28 [[turbocharger]].\n\n[[File:Nissan Silvia K's SE (S14) left.JPG|thumb|left|Nissan Silvia K's in Japan]]\nThere was a mild styling update to the S14 during 1996, which added aggressive-looking projector headlamps and tinted taillights to all models. Fascias and other exterior trim pieces were also revised. The turbocharger now used a more efficient [[ball bearing]] center section. This updated version is also known as the ''kouki'' (\u5f8c\u671f, literally \"later period\") S14, or by enthusiasts as the S14A. It was sold as the second generation [[240SX]] in North America from 1995 to 1998, equipped with the non-turbo [[Nissan KA engine#KA24DE|KA24DE]] engine. The final model year of S14 production in all markets was 1999, called the Touring Model, which had a better engine block, pistons, and better acceleration in lower gears.\n\n=== 270R ===\n\nThe 270R was a limited edition vehicle developed by Nissan Motorsports. The vehicle was built on the S14 chassis but had many enhancements over the Silvia. Only 50 270Rs were ever built and they were only produced in 1994. The '270' is in reference to the horsepower of the unique car as opposed to the displacement of the engine (as other vehicles, including the 240sx, were previously named upon). The 270R featured a vented hood with a front-mounted intercooler, Nismo 'Edge' Aero kit, heavy duty clutch, 2-way limited slip differential, NISMO logo front and rear seats among other upgrades. All the 270s were painted black with 'Nismo 270R' badging above the rear wheels and a product numbered plaque in the glove compartment.\n\n=== Autech Version K's MF-T ===\n\nTuning company [[Autech]], has a tuned adaption of the CS14 King's variant. This includes Aero style [[Head-up display|HUD]] with white displays and gauges for oil pressure, boost, and voltage in the centre console, along with a [[Momo (company)|MOMO]] steering wheel and leather gear knob. The interior trim is also revised.\n\nHandling improvements include multi-link suspension, firmer shocks and springs, front strut brace, and a rear sway bar. A large [[Ferrari F40|F40]] style rear spoiler and aero bodykit with Autech indicators are also fitted. An \"Autech Version K's MF-T\" badge and sticker can be found on the boot.\n\nAn [[IHI Corporation|IHI]] [[ball bearing]] turbo (VN14) was fitted in favour of the [[Garrett Advancing Motion|Garrett]] T28 for slightly quicker response and flow. Larger 480 cc injectors found in the later S15 Spec R's were also fitted as well as a thicker 80&nbsp;mm intercooler also found in S15's. To help expel exhaust, a higher flowing Fujitsubo Giken (FGK) exhaust was fitted.\n\nThe engine is an Autech-tuned [[Nissan SR20DET|SR20DET]] that produces 182[[Watt#Kilowatt|kW]] (245[[Horsepower|hp]]/250[[Horsepower#Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung 70020 (DIN 70020)|PS]]).\n\nAccording to the Autech website, the vehicle is still available at a cost of \u00a52.99 million [[Japanese yen|yen]] (around 27,000 US dollars).{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n== S15 ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image =Nissan S15 200SX.jpg\n| caption = Nissan Silvia 200SX (S15) in New Zealand\n| name = Nissan Silvia (S15)\n| production = January 1999\u20132002\n| assembly=[[Kanda, Fukuoka]] ([[Nissan Shatai]] Plant)\n| engine = {{unbulleted list|2.0&nbsp;L ''[[SR20DE]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]|2.0&nbsp;L [[Nissan SR engine#SR20DET|SR20DET]] I4 turbo}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|5-speed manual|6-speed manual|4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]}}\n| platform= [[Nissan S platform]]\n| layout=[[FR layout]]\n| body_style = {{unbulleted list|2-door [[coupe]]|2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2525|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4445|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1695|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1285|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1200|-|1450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| aka = {{unbulleted list|Nissan 200SX (AUS/NZ)}}\n}}\n\nJapan saw a new version of the Silvia: The S-15 in 1999, now boasting {{cvt|250|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,400 rpm and {{cvt|28|kgm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 4,800 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] from its [[Nissan SR20DET|SR20DET]] [[Inline-four engine]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=27291|website=carfolio.com|title=1999 Nissan Silvia spec-R S15 GF-S15 |date=February 28, 2013|accessdate=July 25, 2018}}</ref> thanks to a [[ball bearing]] [[turbocharger]] upgrade, as well as improved [[engine management system]].

The body dimensions were reduced from the previous generation so that it would comply with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|compact class]], which had an effect on sales of the previous model.\n\n[[File:Nissan Silvia spec S (S15) rear.JPG|thumb|left|Nissan Silvia spec-S in Japan]]\nThe S15 Silvia model lineup was initially simplified to just the '''Spec-S''' and '''Spec-R''', both models offering an \"Aero\" variant with a large rear [[Spoiler (automotive)|wing]] and side skirts/valances.\n\nThis generation of the Silvia was only sold in Japan, Australia and New Zealand but was available as a [[Grey import vehicle|grey import]] in most other countries. In Australia and New Zealand the car was sold as the Nissan 200SX.\n\nWithin the Australian domestic market (AUDM), the S15 sold in 2 trim levels as noted above; Spec-S and Spec-R - however both models featured the SR20DET motor, albeit slightly detuned from the [[Japanese domestic market|JDM]] spec cars. Nissan S15s were never officially sold with the [[naturally aspirated]] SR20DE engine in Australia or New Zealand. These two models were available at Nissan showrooms until the Nissan 200SX GT was introduced in 2002, the last year of production for the S15. Main differences here were namely the wheels being finished in a silver shadow chrome, chrome interior door handles, chrome gear selector surround, \"sports\" metal pedal set and an updated larger rear wing.\n\nAs of August 2002, Nissan stopped producing the [[Nissan S platform|S platform]] with the S15-series Nissan Silvia being the final variant. Production of the Silvia ended amidst Nissan's efforts to reduce its myriad of platforms. The S15 Silvia was therefore the last car to hold the Silvia badge. Nissan's worldwide sports car platform is now the [[Nissan FM platform|FM platform]], which underpins the current [[Nissan Fairlady Z|Fairlady Z]] (the [[Nissan 350Z|350/370Z]] outside Japan), as well as the 2001\u2013present [[Nissan Skyline]] (the [[Infiniti G35|Infiniti G35/37]] in North America).\n\n=== Variants ===\n\n==== Spec-R ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:1999 Nissan Silvia S15 Spec R.jpg|thumb|left|1999 Nissan Silvia Spec-R]]\n\nThe Spec-R differed from previous Silvia models by featuring a 6-speed manual gearbox as well as a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Spec-R also included extensive chassis and suspension strengthening via the use of larger [[anti-roll bars]] and [[strut]] bracing. The S15 featured the same 4-piston front [[brake caliper]]s that were found in the Z32 300ZX but included a larger [[brake booster]].\n\nOne of the biggest changes to the S15 model of the Silvia fitted with the 6-speed [[manual transmission]] built by [[Aisin Seiki]] was the implementation of a helical [[limited-slip differential]]. The result was a safer, more track suited drive; in some contrast to its [[Drifting (motorsport)|drifting]] heritage and subsequent media attention. All other versions of the Silvia (S14, S15 Spec S JDM) came with the viscous limited slip differential.\n\nAs with many Nissans, HICAS (High Capacity Active Steering) four-wheel steering was available as an option.\n\n==== Spec-S ====\n\nThe Spec-S featured a 5-speed [[manual transmission]] (in addition to a 4-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] available on both the Spec-S and the Spec-R). It lacked the additional chassis support of the Spec-R; featured 4-piston front brake caliper and a slightly smaller brake booster. The Spec-S came only with an open differential. Australian-delivered Spec-S models featured the same helical differential, chassis bracing and 6 speed manual transmission as the Australian market Spec-R models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlyrepairmanuals.com/nissan/ |title=Nissan Factory Service Manual - Free Nissan FSM |publisher=Guapro Media |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}</ref>\n\nThe S15 line was later expanded to include various luxury and upgrade option packages for both the Spec-S and Spec-R. [[Autech]], a specialty car developer, also offered several tuned versions of the S15; one with body and interior trim modeled after the [[Ferrari 456]], called the style-A, available in both Spec-S and Spec-R based trims; and a second tuned version was based on the Spec-S trim level with the engine output increased to {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} through the use of increased [[compression ratio|compression]], more aggressive [[camshaft]]s, and free-breathing intake and exhaust tracts, along with ECU tuning and upgrades to the chassis and suspension. This version also included the 6-speed transmission and other upgrades normally found only in the Spec-R.\n\n====Silvia Varietta====\n[[File:Nissan Silvia Varietta 002.JPG|thumb|Nissan Silvia Varietta in Japan]]\nIn Japan, Nissan offered a [[retractable hardtop]] variant of the Silvia, called the '''Varietta'''. The Varietta was built by [[Autech]] and was based on the Spec-S model, featuring the same naturally aspirated engine, with a choice of the 5-speed manual transmission or the 4-speed automatic transmission. This is a rare type of Nissan Silvia which is uncommon in most places as only 1143 cars were produced.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Motorsports ==\n\n[[File:MikiS15.jpg|right|thumbnail|200px | S15 Silvia of {{D1|2004}} [[D1 Grand Prix|D1GP]] champion [[Ryuji Miki]]]]\nThe S-chassis is a popular [[Drifting (motorsport)|drift car]], especially the S13 through S15 vehicles. This is due to the extreme versatility and huge aftermarket for the S-chassis, many professional racecars have been built just by off the shelf suspension and engine components. The car has enjoyed success in the sport, having won 7 D1 Grand Prix championships with 5 different drivers driving the S15 (Nobuteru Taniguchi:2001; Ryuji Miki:2004; Yasuyuki Kazama:2005; Masato Kawabata:2007; Youichi Imamura:2009, 2010, 2011. Odi Bakchis, a pro-level drifter from USA that started drifting in 2011, has an S14 that races in Formula Drift, finishing third in the Formula Drift USA Championship. He has multiple event wins and has placed in the Top 5 overall in Formula Drift for the past 4 years. In 2018 Formula Drift driver James Deane campaigned and won the PRO championship in the Worthouse Drift Team S15.<ref>{{cite web |last= Terrell |first= Joe |title= Ultimate Nissan Silvia S15 Guide |url= https://www.drifted.com/nissan-silvia-s15/ |publisher= Drifted |accessdate= August 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn Europe, the S13 has also been very popular with pro-level drifters, especially in countries like the United Kingdom, Poland, France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Russia and Ukraine. While some have opted to use the SR20DET engine from Nissan, most drivers have swapped in a larger RB25DET unit, or even the Toyota Supra derived 2JZ, like Pawel Trela from Poland. [http://japtalk.com/2011/09/pawel-trelas-nissan-200sx-s13/]\n\nSilvias have been raced successfully in the All-Japan Grand Touring Car Championship (now [[Super GT]]) and its predecessors. Both the S14 and S15 generations of the Silvia won the GT300 class championship in 1997 and 2001 respectively. In the late Eighties, when [[Group B]] was banned, S110 and S12 Silvias also saw limited success in [[rallying]], mainly on endurance rallies. During the S13's production, there was a one-make series in Japan. The S13s were also successful in racing in the IMSA GTU class during the 1990s.\n\nThe Silvia S15 of Under Suzuki has dominated the Tsukuba circuit lap time record for some time. After it defeated the [[HKS (company)|HKS]] CT230R [[LanEvo]] for the record in 2012, Under Suzuki's S15 has been resetting Tsukuba's lap time record. The latest lap record is currently timed at 50.366s, even faster than an official [[JGTC]] race car ARTA [[Honda NSX|NSX]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.farmofminds.com/tsukuba-circuit-lap-time-record-51-127/ |title=Tsukuba Circuit lap time record: 51.127! |website=Farmofminds.com |date=2014-12-26 |accessdate=2017-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtimeattack.com/index.php/under-suzuki-resets-tsukuba-lap-record/ |title=Under Suzuki resets Tsukuba lap record \u2013 again! \u2013 World Time Attack Challenge |website=Worldtimeattack.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.speedhunters.com/2012/12/uncharted-territory-under-suzuki-52-sec-lap/ |title=Uncharted Territory: Under Suzuki's 52-sec Lap |website=Speedhunters.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-16}}</ref><ref>http://www.speedhunters.com/2017/12/time-attacked-is-it-all-over/</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Nissan Silvia}}\n*[http://www.s15oc.com S15oc.com - '''Official S15 Owners Club''' - Forums, Guides, Technical Support, Events, Classified Adverts and more]\n*[http://S12Silvia.com S12Silvia.com] - Blog, Forum, and Tech for the International S12 Community\n*[http://www.200SX.gr 200SX.gr] Hellas 200sx Club\n*[http://www.sxoc.com/vbb SXOC] UK 200sx owners club\n*[http://history.nissan.co.jp/SILVIA/S15/0201/index.html Nissan Silvia S15]\u2014Archive of Nissan's official site for the S15 Silvia. {{in lang|ja}}\n*[http://club-s12.org Club-S12.org - International Nissan Silvia/Gazelle/200SX S12 Site] - International Nissan S12 Chassis specific site.\n*[http://www.nissansilvia.com Nissan Silvia]\u2014Australian Nissan Silvia Club.\n*[http://www.silviawa.com SilviaWA] - Nissan Silvia Car Club of Western Australia\n*[http://www.zilvia.net Zilvia] - S chassis and Z chassis owners\n*[https://www.drifted.com/nissan-silvia-s15/ Ultimate Nissan Silvia S15 Guide] - S15 model information, specifications, motorsport history and common performance upgrades\n*[http://autospeed.com/cms/A_111229/article.html History of the Silvia] Autospeed Magazine (note: some technical inaccuracies and minor nomenclature errors)\n*[http://www11.atwiki.jp/papercraft/pages/38.html Paper scale model of the Nissan Silvia.] To download, print and build yourself.\n*http://gtr-registry.com/en-s15-silvia-200sx.php#S15ColoursBreakdown\n{{Modern European Nissan vehicles}}\n{{Nissan}}\n{{North American Datsun vehicles}}\n\n[[Category:Nissan vehicles|Silvia]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Vehicles with four-wheel steering]]\n[[Category:Rally cars]]\n[[Category:Sports cars]]\n[[Category:Sport compact cars]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Hardtop convertibles]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1964]]\n[[Category:Group B cars]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=July 2018}}{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Nissan Silvia S15 001.JPG\n| caption = '''Nissan Silvia''' (S15) in Japan\n| class = [[Sports car]]\n| production = 1964\u20131968<br />1974\u20132002\n| assembly = \n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| weight = {{convert|1250|kg}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2525|mm|ftin}}\n}}\n\nThe {{nihongo|'''Nissan Silvia'''|Japanese: \u65e5\u7523\u30fb\u30b7\u30eb\u30d3\u30a2|Nissan Shirubia}} is the name given to the company's long-running line of [[sport coupe]]s based on the [[Nissan S platform]]. Although recent models have shared this chassis with other vehicles produced by Nissan (most notably the European [[Nissan 180SX#RS13U|200SX]] and North American [[Nissan 240SX|240SX]] in the S13 and S14 generations, and [[Nissan 180SX|180SX]] in the Japanese market), the name ''Silvia'' is interchangeable with the chassis codes. The Nissan Silvia's main competitors worldwide were the [[Honda Prelude]], [[Mazda MX-6]], [[Toyota Celica]], [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]], [[Isuzu Impulse]], [[Subaru Impreza]] and [[Honda Integra]].\n\nThe \"Silvia\" name is a variation of the word \"[[Typical warbler|sylvia]]\", which is a scientific [[genus]] term assigned to a class of birds, possibly a reference to the [[Nissan Bluebird|Bluebird]] which was in production at the time the Silvia was introduced.\n\n== CSP311 ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Nissan Silvia CSP311.jpg\n| caption = Nissan Silvia (CSP311)\n| name = Nissan Silvia (CSP311)\n| assembly = [[Hiratsuka, Kanagawa]] ([[Nissan Shatai]] Plant)\n| aka = Datsun 1600 Coupe<ref>Australian Motor Manual's 1967 Road Test Annual, page 40</ref>\n| production = {{unbulleted list|1965\u20131968|554 produced<ref>[http://www.earlydatsun.com/nissancsp311.html ''1965 Nissan Silvia CSP311'', www.earlydatsun.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524103330/http://www.earlydatsun.com/nissancsp311.html |date=2017-05-24 }} Retrieved on 15 February 2015</ref>}}\n| engine = 1.6&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan H engine#H16(R16|R]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n| length = {{convert|3985|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1508|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1275|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| platform = [[Datsun Sports#SP311|Datsun CSP311 platform]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[coupe]]\n| weight = {{convert|977|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2280|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| related = [[Datsun Sports#SP311/SPL311|Datsun Fairlady SP311]]\n}}\nThe Nissan Silvia CSP311 made its public debut at the [[Tokyo Motor Show#1964|Tokyo Motor Show]] in September 1964 as the \"Datsun Coupe 1500\". The introductory model was a hand-built coupe based on the [[Datsun Sports|Fairlady]] convertible, styled with input from Count [[Albrecht Goertz]]. Its appearance is similar to the [[Lancia Fulvia#Coup\u00e9|Lancia Fulvia coupe]]. The CSP311 was powered by the 96&nbsp;hp 1.6&nbsp;L [[Nissan H engine#R|Nissan R series engine]]. The engine was equipped with twin [[SU carburetor]]s. Production ceased in 1968 after a mere 554 were made (mainly in 1965), each one of them unique with body panels crafted by hand. Most of the vehicles remained in [[Japan]]; however, 49 examples were exported to [[Australia]] and another 10 went to other countries.\n\nThe low production numbers and tedious method of construction assured that each car was unique and valuable; this is reflected by the car's purchase price of almost twice as much as the next model in the manufacturer's lineup at the time. After production ceased in 1968, the ''Silvia'' nameplate would not grace another Nissan vehicle until 1974. Its marketing approach was similar to the [[Isuzu 117 Coup\u00e9]]. In Japan, it was sold at [[Nissan Bluebird Store]] locations, and was marketed with the \"Nissan\" name instead of the more widely used \"Datsun\" brand name.\n{{Clear}}\n{{anchor|S10}}\n\n== S10 ==\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Nissan New Silvia.jpg\n| name = Nissan Silvia (S10)\n| production = 1975\u20131979\n|assembly=[[Nissan#Manufacturing locations|Zama Plant]], [[Zama, Kanagawa]], Japan\n| engine = {{unbulleted list|1.8&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan L engine#L18|L18]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] (Japan)|2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan L engine#L20B|L20B]]'' I4 (US)}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|3-speed ''[[Jatco 3N71 transmission|3N71]]'' [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]|5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]}}\n| length = {{convert|4135|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1300|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| platform= [[Nissan S platform]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[fastback]]\n| weight = {{convert|990|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2340|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| aka = {{unbulleted list|Datsun 200SX (US)|Datsun 180SX}}\n| related = [[Nissan Sunny]]\n}}\nThe S10 was the first mass-produced Silvia built on the all-new [[Nissan S platform|S platform]], intended as Nissan's compact, rear-wheel-drive, sporty car [[Automobile platform|platform]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nissan Silvia|journal=Automotive Engineering International|year=1999|volume=107|page=23|publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers}}</ref> Japanese versions were exclusive to Nissan Japanese dealerships called ''[[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan Prince Store]]'' along with the larger [[Nissan Skyline#C110|C110 Skyline]].\n\nThe S10 featured less \"traditional\" lines than similar offerings from rivals [[Toyota Celica|Toyota]] and [[Mazda Capella|Mazda]] sharing a common appearance with the larger Skyline. In Japan it was fitted with a 1.8 L [[Nissan L engine|L18]] [[Straight-4|inline-4 engine]], which it shared with the [[Nissan Bluebird|Datsun 610/Bluebird 180B]]. The Japanese version featured [[Nissan NAPS]] emission control technology at its introduction. In the North American market a version incorporating the larger-displacement 2.0 L [[Nissan L engine|L20B]] was offered as the 200B of the same series Bluebird and Skyline. This model in North America was affixed with the mandated {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} bumpers and badged as the Datsun 200SX. The S10 Silvia and Datsun 200SX were based on the [[Nissan Sunny#B210 (1973\u20131977)|Datsun Sunny Coupe]]. Its success in both markets was limited, most buyers opting for the Celica over what was considered the more mundane S-Chassis. The car had the same drivetrain as the popular [[Datsun 510|510]], but with [[leaf spring]]s fitted at the rear, rather than the 510's [[independent suspension]].\n\n[[File:Nissan New Silvia2.jpg|left|thumb|Rear view]]\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== S110 ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Nissan Silvia (S110)\n| image = Silvia2000ZSE-X 04.jpg\n| caption = Nissan Silvia 2000 ZSE-X Coup\u00e9 (Japan)\n| aka = {{unbulleted list|Nissan Gazelle|Nissan 240RS (rally car)|Datsun 200SX (United States & Canada)|Datsun 180SX|Datsun Silvia<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/32109282@N00/16501605688 1981 Datsun Silvia brochure cover (France), www.flickr.com] Retrieved on 19 march 2015</ref>|Datsun Sakura (Mexico)}}\n| production = 1979\u20131983\n| assembly=[[Kanda, Fukuoka]] ([[Nissan Shatai]] Plant)\n| body_style = {{unbulleted list|2-door [[coup\u00e9]]|3-door [[hatchback]]}}\n| platform= [[Nissan S platform]]\n| related = [[Nissan Stanza]]\n| engine = {{unbulleted list|1770&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L18|L18]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] | 1770&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan Z engine#Z18|Z18/S/E]]'' I4 | 1770&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan Z engine#Z18ET|Z18ET]]'' [[Turbocharger|turbo]] I4 | 1952&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L20B|L20B]]'' I4 | 1952&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan Z engine#Z20|Z20/Z20E]]'' I4|1990&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan FJ engine#FJ20E|FJ20E]]'' [[DOHC]] I4|2188&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan Z engine#Z22E|Z22E]]'' I4|2340&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan FJ engine#FJ24|FJ24]]'' DOHC I4 (240RS)}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|3-speed automatic|5-speed manual}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1680|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1310|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1105|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\n[[File:1983 Nissan 200SX (S110), front right White.jpg|thumb|left|Datsun Silvia 180SX Hatchback (Europe)]]\n[[File:Silvia2000ZSE-X 06.jpg|thumb|left|Rear of pre-facelift Silvia 2000 ZSE-X coup\u00e9 (Japan)]]\n\nThis iteration of the Silvia (sold in [[United States]] and [[Canada]] as the '''Datsun 200SX''' and in [[Mexico]] as the '''Datsun Sakura''', [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]] for [[cherry blossom]]), available as a 2-door hardtop coupe and a new bodystyle 3-door hatchback. The Japanese market version of the hatchback was called the '''Gazelle''' and was exclusive to ''[[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan Bluebird Store]]'' locations sold alongside the [[Nissan Z-car#Second generation (S130)|Fairlady Z]], while the coupe bodystyle Silvia remained exclusive to ''Nissan Prince Store'' locations alongside the [[Nissan Skyline#C210|Skyline]]. Its sharp-edged styling was shared with the new [[Nissan Leopard]] sedan and coup\u00e9, also exclusive to ''Nissan Bluebird Store''.\n\nThis generation Silvia was uniquely progressive in that it was originally intended to feature a [[Wankel engine|rotary engine]], designed and built by Nissan. The resulting unit was fairly unreliable, and forestalled production. Coincidentally, this Silvia shares its chassis code with the [[Mazda Cosmo#Series CD (1975\u20131981)|Mazda Cosmo]], the first Japanese production car to feature a rotary engine. The chassis was shared with the B310 [[Nissan Sunny]] and the larger A10 [[Nissan Violet]] platform.\n\nThe car was redesigned shortly before it was released and the stillborn Wankel power plant was replaced by a line of [[Dual ignition|twin-plug]] conventional piston engines from the new [[Nissan Z engine|Z-series range]]. These included the Z20 and the [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] and later the [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] Z18ET, although the latter of the two was only available to the Japanese domestic market and after the mid-life facelift.

These engines borrowed from previous designs, or in some cases, inspired future engine platforms (with the exception of the FJ series, which was designed solely with Rally competition in mind). For instance, the CA series initially borrowed design cues from the NAP-Z series. The CA18DET's DOHC head design was similar to that utilized in the later \"RB\" engine series, the [[inline-six engine]] that powered the [[Nissan Skyline]]s.

The S12 Gazelle was strictly a hatchback, available in regular, RS and RS-X variants and exclusive to ''Nissan Bluebird Store locations'' as a junior companion to the Fairlady ZX. The RS was equipped with the 2.0L DOHC \"FJ\" engine [[Nissan FJ engine|(FJ20E)]], while the RS-X was equipped with the same engine in a turbocharged version [[Nissan FJ engine|(FJ20ET)]]. In 1987 Nissan discontinued the FJ Series engine in the S12 and replaced it with the CA18DET (with dual cams and a bigger turbocharger\u2014the [[Nissan CA engine|CA18DET]]. Japanese spec Gazelle models came with many options like voice command, fog lights and options for a variety of different motors (FJ20E, FJ20ET, CA18DE, CA18E, CA18DET.). The RS-X model also came with different factory alloy wheels. When the S13 Silvia was introduced in 1988 in Japan, the Gazelle nameplate was replaced with the [[Nissan 180SX]] as a junior companion to the 300ZX, although in Australia there would not be a replacement until the introduction of the Silvia-based [[Nissan 200SX]] in 1995.\n\n=== North America ===\n[[File:Nissan 200SX (2650508834).jpg|thumb|left|Nissan 200SX XE coupe with new rear lamps in Canada]]\nThe S12 Silvia brand in North America was badged as a \"200SX\". For fear that the North American market would not be as profitable as other markets throughout; without any major innovations, Nissan Executives only scheduled the manufacturing of 5k of each trim package/engine options in the final 2 years before the halt of US production, which was in 1988. The S12 \"XE\" was strictly a coupe or a \"notchback\", and was only available with a 2.0L SOHC, non-turbo engine and made available with either a 5 speed manual or 4 speed automatic gearbox. [[Nissan CA engine|(CA20E)]] The hatchback received both the 2.0L SOHC engine, and a 1.8L SOHC Turbo (non-intercooled) engine [[Nissan CA engine|(CA18ET)]]. For 1987 in the United States, Nissan discontinued the Turbo model and created the \"SE\" model which had a 3.0L SOHC [[V6 engine]] [[Nissan VG engine|(VG30E)]], generating {{convert|160|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|174|lbf.ft|abbr=on}} of torque. This was the same engine offered in the non-turbo 300ZX for that generation. For 1988 the \"SE\" model received a {{convert|5|hp|abbr=on}} gain from using the later \"W\" series revisions of the [[Nissan VG engine|VG30E]] with a total output of {{convert|165|hp|abbr=on}} while torque remained the same at {{convert|174|lbf.ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n=== Europe ===\n[[File:Silvia S12 (2).JPG|thumb|left|Nissan Silvia Hatchback in Europe]]\nThe S12 chassis in Europe was badged as a \"Silvia\", with notable exception of Sweden where it was sold as a \"180ZX\". \"ZX\" is traditionally associated with the Nissan [[Nissan Z-car|Z]] platform, this situation came about to avoid giving the car the same name as the [[Queen Silvia of Sweden|Queen of Sweden]]. The ZX name was used because Nissan's Swedish importer decided to stop carrying the 300ZX when the naturally aspirated version was discontinued for Europe; the Silvia acted as a partial replacement for the Z-car.<ref name=\"TV24.87\">{{cite journal | ref = tv24.39 | title = Nya motorer fr\u00e5n Nissan | trans-title = New engines from Nissan | language = Swedish | journal = [[Teknikens V\u00e4rld]] | publisher = Specialtidningsf\u00f6rlaget AB | location = Stockholm, Sweden | page = 20 | date = 1987-11-11 | issue = 24 | volume = 39 | first = Bj\u00f6rn | last = Svallner }}</ref>\n\nThe European S12 was available only in the hatchback configuration, few were equipped with a rally package that included a rally foot brace for the navigator, headlamp guards, headlamp dust cleaners, with the same 1.8L SOHC Turbo [[Nissan CA engine|(CA18ET)]] used in North America, and in some areas the 2.0L DOHC \"FJ\" engine [[Nissan FJ engine|(FJ20E)]]. The \"FJ\" engine series was originally designed for the 240RS rally race car as a 2.4L carburated system (FJ24), and was underbored to 2.0L. The FJ20 also saw use in the \"DR30\" Nissan Skyline chassis, in both turbocharged and naturally aspirated versions.

Below lists the description of both.\n\n==== Mark I ====\n[[File:1985 Nissan Gazelle (S12) GL hatchback (2008-11-10).jpg|thumb|left|1984\u20131986 Nissan Gazelle GL hatchback (Australia)]]\nThe first trim of the S12 chassis. Bumpers featured matte-finish raised surfaces, and sides featured half-inch rubstripping. Cars featured a honeycomb radiator grille, and long corner lights. The RS-X trim in Japan and Europe received a hood bulge accent to accommodate the oversized dimensions of the FJ20E/ET engine, and featured a faux front vent with monogram (either FJ20, DOHC, or TURBO); In North America, the 1984 Turbo came with a \"TURBO\" monogrammed hood bulge accent, although all subsequent North American Mark I hoods were flat regardless of trim. In some markets, the 1984 and 85 could be had with a foam rubber deck spoiler. In 1986 the foam rubber deck spoiler was changed for a fiberglass version with an integrated third brake light. Some hatchbacks and all Turbo models came with ground effects, as did the RS-X coupes These had\u009d a combination of plastic mudflaps (monogrammed as either \"NISSAN\", or \"SILVIA\" in applicable markets) and accommodating foam rubber sideskirts, as well as a foam rubber lower deflection lip. 1984 year foam rubber sideskirts featured the \"NISSAN\" monogram.\n\n==== Mark II ====\n[[File:Nissan 200SX XE (4737127343).jpg|thumb|Nissan 200SX XE hatchback with new rear lamps]]\nIn 1986, the bumpers were updated, and the matte finished surfaces were eliminated for a more uniform surface. Rubstripping was increased to 2-inch height w/ scribe detailing. The honeycomb radiator grille was replaced with a slatted version that spanned the entire front end (previous was shorter), and cornerlights were shortened. The \"SE\" model and the Turbo (Canada, Europe) came with new fiberglass ground effects and mudflaps, painted in the color of the car, and a new and more pronounced lower deflection lip in the front. All Mark II S12's received a new reverse-cowl hood bulge design to accommodate clearance for the 3.0L V6. Optional rear mudflap accents were available.\n\n=== Drivetrain rear-wheel-drive ===\n\n==== Engine ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! Engine\n! Variance\n!

Based on a Mark I chassis, it was powered by the [[Nissan FJ engine|FJ20E]] (with a few known to be sold with the [[Nissan CA engine|CA18ET]]), and featured molded-in fiberglass wide body fenders and quarter sections and special edition wheels.\n\nThe widebody exterior grabs design cues from popular European rally car platforms of the time (e.g. Audi Quattro, BMW M3 Sport Evolution, Renault 5 Turbo 2, etc.), although Nissan's choice of the [[Nissan FJ engine|FJ20E]] over the [[Nissan FJ engine|FJ20ET]] suggests this was more of a \"rally inspired\" car rather than a serious performance trim. The Silvia Grand Prix holds the distinction as the rarest incarnation of the S12, and is generally considered something of a collector's item. The Mark II revision of the S12 chassis marked the end of the Silvia Grand Prix.\n\n=== Motorsports ===\n\n[[File:Nissan Slivia 200SX (RVS12) front-left.jpg|thumb|right|Nissan Silvia 200SX 1988 [[Safari Rally]] runner-up car]]\nThe elimination of [[Group B#Group B|Group B]] from the [[World Rally Championship]] signified the end of Nissan's FJ24-powered [[Nissan Silvia#Nissan 240RS|240RS]]. The FJ20ET-powered Silvia RS-X of 1986 would have been Nissan's first choice, however there was an insufficient number of that exact trim sold in Japan to meet the WRC's [[Homologation (motorsport)|Homologation]] requirements (minimum 5000 units). Nissan had to quickly find a car to replace the [[Nissan Silvia#Nissan 240RS|240RS]].\n\nThe North American 1987 200SX SE V6 was chosen and competed in 1986-89 as a 200SX. Nissan's creation and choice of this car ensured they could sell 5000 cars required for WRC [[Homologation (motorsport)|Homologation]]. The S12 \"SE\" trim's V6 held the only real appeal to the North American market, allowing Nissan to sell right at 5000 cars to a single specification. The V6 was a very unusual choice as the WRC was dominated by 4-cylinder 2.0 L turbocharged engines, although for similar reasons Toyota entered WRC with the 6-cylinder Supra at the same time. The 200SX achieved a first place in the [http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=result&rallyid=199 1988 Ivory coast rally] and second place for two years running in the very challenging [http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=result&rallyid=192 Safari Rally 1988] and [http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=result&rallyid=179 Safari Rally 1989].\n\n[[Mark Skaife]] won the [[1987 Australian 2.0 Litre Touring Car Championship]] driving a Nissan Gazelle entered by the Nissan Motor Company.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== S13 ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Nissan Silvia (S13)\n| image = Nissan 13 silvia.jpg\n| production = 1989&ndash;1994\n| body_style = 2-door [[coupe]]<br />2-door [[convertible]]<br />2-door [[Fastback]]\n| engine = {{unbulleted list | 1.8&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan CA engine#CA18DE|CA18DE]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] | 1.8&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan CA engine#CA18DET|CA18DET]]'' [[Turbocharger|turbo]] I4 | 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[SR20DE]]'' I4 | 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan SR engine#SR20DET|SR20DET]]'' turbo I4 }}\n| length = 4521 mm (178 in)\n| width = 1689 mm (66.5 in)\n| assembly = [[Kanda, Fukuoka]] ([[Nissan Shatai]] Plant)\n| height = 1290 mm (50.8 in)\n| wheelbase = 2474 mm (97.4 in)\n| weight = {{convert|1180|-|1224|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| transmission = 4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n| platform = [[Nissan S platform]]\n| related = [[Nissan 180SX]]<br />Nissan [[Nissan 180SX#RS13U|200SX]] ([[Europe]])<br />[[Nissan 240SX]] ([[North America]])<br />[[Sileighty]]\n}}\nThe S13 Silvia, introduced in mid-1988 the 1990 model year, was immensely popular in Japan. At its introduction in 1989, it won the [[Car of the Year Japan]] Award. The Silvia was no longer exported, however; rebadged [[Nissan 180SX|180SX]] were instead sold in most markets. European versions of this car were still known as [[Nissan 180SX#RS13U|200SX]]. In North America, the S13 (180SX front, all three different bodystyles) was known as the [[Nissan 240SX|240SX]]. In North America, the Nissan 200SX nameplate was on hiatus but would return on a [[Nissan Lucino|2-door coupe version]] of the B14 [[Nissan Sunny#B14 (1995\u20131999)|Nissan Sunny/Sentra]] (1995\u201399). Following industry trends, the S13 Silvia switched to relampable fixed headlights. Projector optics were offered as an option.\n\nIn Japan, Nissan renamed the Gazelle as the [[Nissan 180SX]], which was exported primarily under the name [[Nissan 240SX]]. The 180SX served as the junior companion to the Fairlady ZX at ''[[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan Bluebird Store]]'' Japanese dealerships. As before, the Silvia was exclusive to Japanese dealerships called ''Nissan Prince Store'' next to the Skyline.\n\nThe S13 Silvia coupe was made from 1988 to 1994, overlapping with the S14 Silvia introduced in 1993. The Nissan Silvia used fixed headlights; whereas, the 180SX, simply a hatchback version of the Silvia, introduced at the same time used pop-up headlights. The hatchback version, called the 180SX, replaced the Gazelle name in Japan and remained in production until 1998.\n\nThe S13 was one of the first uses of Nissan's multi-link rear suspension, the technology of which was previewed in concept cars in previous years, such as the [[Nissan MID4]]. It also offered a four-wheel steering system for the first time, known as [[HICAS]]-II. In 1990, HICAS-II was updated and renamed SuperHICAS. The S13 also saw the introduction of a viscous-type [[limited slip differential]] for some models.\n\nS13 Silvias were initially powered by the [[Nissan CA engine#CA18DE|CA18DE]] and [[Nissan CA engine#CA18DET|CA18DET]] engines carried over from the end of S12 production, with an [[intercooler]] added to the CA18DET for a slight increase in stability and power. In mid-1990, (for the 1991 model year) the [[SR20DE]] and [[Nissan SR engine#SR20DET|SR20DET]] engines debuted, offering improvements across the board in power and torque due to increased displacement and a more efficient turbocharger than was offered on the previous cars. One of the other simple changes that were made between the [[Nissan CA engine|CA]] generation and the [[Nissan SR engine|SR]] generation was the switch to a single colour paint job, instead of the two-tone colour sets that were previously offered. On top of this, the SR motor later debuted another variant of the platform known simply as the \"blacktop\". Identifiable by its black and silver rocker-cover (as opposed to the traditional red/silver cover), it featured a number of minor changes, resulting in a little performance gain. It is vastly different from the more powerful \"notch top\" used in the S14 and S15 variants.\n\nIn the U.S. the S13 was replaced after the 1994 model year by the new S14 design but lived on until 1998 in Japan with a major facelift, the 180SX Aero (Type X). This was the \"Kouki\" generation, while the previous (or 'middle') generation was referred to as \"Chuki\". The Kouki featured newly design tail lights a redesigned aero body kit and outfitted with an airbag. In 1998, the S13 Silvia was resurrected, in part. A variant was produced by [[Kid's Heart]] for Nissan called the [[Sileighty]], which featured the [[Nissan 180SX|180SX]] body with the front end from the Silvia. The Sileighty style was originally created by Japanese enthusiasts for their own 180SX's, and is still a common modification for the 180SX and [[Nissan 240SX|240SX]] fastback. The [[Sileighty]] also made an appearance in a Japanese [[anime]] and [[manga]] series known as ''[[Initial D]]''. The series (based around the Japanese motorsports of [[Touge]] and [[Drifting (motorsport)|drifting]]) featured the [[Sileighty]] in one of the last battles of the ''First Stage'' (or first season in the anime).\n\nThe creation of the [[Sileighty]] then followed by another version of the Silvia known as the Onevia. Based on the chassis of the S13, the front end of the Silvia would be removed and replaced with the front end of a [[Nissan 180SX|180SX]]. The Onevia was never retailed as a complete car in Japan (though it was in North America: the coupe version of the 240SX was essentially a left-hand drive version of the Silvia with the 180SX/240SX nose).\n\nThere was also a retro-styled car (\u00e1 la the [[Zimmer (automobile)|Zimmer Golden Spirit]]) which used the S13 Silvia's centre portion, engine, and underpinnings. It is called the [[Mitsuoka Le-Seyde]] and was built in a very limited series in 1990.\n\nThe car has also been popular with multiple diecast manufacturers like HotWheels, which have released several iterations of it over the years.[https://lamleygroup.com/2017/07/28/the-lamley-daily-2015-hot-wheels-nissan-180sx-type-x/] \n\n=== Convertible ===\nA Silvia [[convertible (car)|convertible]] was briefly offered soon after the start of production and sold in limited numbers. Demand, at the time, was low perhaps due to high cost (3.25 million [[Yen]] in 1988), heavier curb weight, and chassis flex. The Silvia convertibles were a conversion done by [[:ja:%E3%82%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%86%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A3%E3%83%91%E3%83%B3|Autech Japan, Inc.]]<ref>http://www.autech.com/history/sv/silvia_convertible_1988.html</ref> and the production was entrusted to [[:ja:%E9%AB%98%E7%94%B0%E5%B7%A5%E6%A5%AD|Takada Kogyo]] with a manufacture date of July 1988. A total of 603 Autech convertibles were produced in the following color codes: TH1 - velvet blue (430), 5G7 - green two-tone lime (50), 5H6 - warm two-tone white (70),  AH3 - cranberry red (40), and DH0 dark green (10). The other 3 were made to order for Nissan and the color is unknown. They came equipped with K series trim including the turbocharged CA18det engine. All of the 600 publicly available cars were sold with 4-speed automatic transmission.\n\nIt was unrelated to the [[Nissan_240SX#Convertible|240SX convertible]] offered in North America, which was a local conversion by [[American Specialty Cars|ASC]].\n\n[[File:S13 SILVIA CONVERTIBLE.JPG|thumb|left|One of the rare Silvia Convertibles]]\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Trim level designation ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe S13 Silvia was the first [[Nissan S platform|S-series]] car to use the ''J's'', ''Q's'', and ''K's'' designations for the different [[trim package]]s. These names are references to the face cards of English [[playing cards]].\n\nThe J's was the base model. The Q's model offered a slightly more refined experience and received electric options and an available [[Limited slip differential|LSD]]. The K's grade received the turbocharged [[Nissan CA engine#CA18DET|CA18DET]] or [[Nissan SR engine#SR20DET|SR20DET]] (depending on the year of manufacture) in addition to the options offered on the Q's.\n\nOn top of the K's and Q's models, the Club and Diamond Selection packages came with specific options bundled together. For example, all K's Club Selections came with [[Headlamp#Projector (poly-ellipsoidal) lamps|projector headlamps]], a rear spoiler, and 15\" aluminum wheels while all Q's models came out with automatic climate control.\n\nThe Silvia A's \"Almighty\" was introduced in late 1992. Trim wise, the Almighty slotted between the J's and Q's, offering options not available on J's, but not including all the standard features of the Q's. The only available engine/transmission was the naturally aspirated [[SR20DE]] coupled with the four-speed automatic or a five-speed manual.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== S14 ==\n{{about|section=yes|this vehicle's Japanese model|information on the North American model|Nissan 240SX#Second Generation / S14 (1994\u20131998)}}{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Nissan Silvia (S14)\n| image=Nissan 200SX (9639982223).jpg\n| caption=Nissan 200SX (S14)\n| production={{unbulleted list|1993&ndash;1998|1994&ndash;1998 (US)}}\n| assembly=[[Kanda, Fukuoka]] ([[Nissan Shatai]] Plant)\n| transmission={{unbulleted list|4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]|5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]}}\n| aka = {{unbulleted list|Nissan 200SX|[[Nissan 240SX#Second generation / S14 (1995\u20131998)|Nissan 240SX]] (North America)}}\n| engine={{unbulleted list|2.0&nbsp;L ''[[SR20DE]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]|2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan SR engine#SR20DET|SR20DET]]'' I4 turbo|2.4&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan KA engine#KA24DE|KA24DE]]'' I4}}\n| length=4498 mm (177.0 in)\n| width=1727 mm (68.0 in)\n| body_style=2-door [[coupe]]\n| height=1288 mm (50.7 in)\n| wheelbase=2525 mm (99.4 in)\n| platform= [[Nissan S platform]]\n| weight=1253&nbsp;kg (2762&nbsp;lb)\n}}\n\n[[File:Nissan 200SX Sportline Front.JPG|thumb|left|Nissan 200SX facelift model in Europe]]\nThe S14 Silvia debuted in Japan towards the end of 1993. It was lower and wider than the S13. New rounded styling contributed to the illusion of a greater increase in size than actually occurred. [[Wheelbase]] and track were both increased, leading to slightly improved handling. Unlike [[export]] markets, where sales of the S14 chassis variants faltered, the Silvia remained popular in Japan. However, the width dimension exceeded 1700 mm, which pushed this generation out of the [[Vehicle size class#Japan|compact class]] tax bracket, which also made Japanese buyers liable for higher [[Road tax#Japan|road taxes]]. The fastback and convertible bodystyles was discontinued internationally, leaving only the coupe in production.\n[[File:S14.jpg|left|thumb|Nissan Silvia facelift model (aka S14a) in Japan]]\nTrim level designations were similar to the S13, however the Club Selection package was dropped. \"Aero\" variants of the Q's and K's were offered that featured large rear [[Spoiler (automotive)|wings]] and mild [[ground effect in cars|ground effects]].\n\nThe S14 Silvia K's received a new version of the SR20DET, with a slight bump in power due to the implementation of Nissan's [[variable cam timing]] system known as [[N-VCT]], on the intake cam, and a larger T28 [[turbocharger]].\n\n[[File:Nissan Silvia K's SE (S14) left.JPG|thumb|left|Nissan Silvia K's in Japan]]\nThere was a mild styling update to the S14 during 1996, which added aggressive-looking projector headlamps and tinted taillights to all models. Fascias and other exterior trim pieces were also revised. The turbocharger now used a more efficient [[ball bearing]] center section. This updated version is also known as the ''kouki'' (\u5f8c\u671f, literally \"later period\") S14, or by enthusiasts as the S14A. It was sold as the second generation [[240SX]] in North America from 1995 to 1998, equipped with the non-turbo [[Nissan KA engine#KA24DE|KA24DE]] engine. The final model year of S14 production in all markets was 1999, called the Touring Model, which had a better engine block, pistons, and better acceleration in lower gears.\n\n=== 270R ===\n\nThe 270R was a limited edition vehicle developed by Nissan Motorsports. The vehicle was built on the S14 chassis but had many enhancements over the Silvia. Only 50 270Rs were ever built and they were only produced in 1994. The '270' is in reference to the horsepower of the unique car as opposed to the displacement of the engine (as other vehicles, including the 240sx, were previously named upon). The 270R featured a vented hood with a front-mounted intercooler, Nismo 'Edge' Aero kit, heavy duty clutch, 2-way limited slip differential, NISMO logo front and rear seats among other upgrades. All the 270s were painted black with 'Nismo 270R' badging above the rear wheels and a product numbered plaque in the glove compartment.\n\n=== Autech Version K's MF-T ===\n\nTuning company [[Autech]], has a tuned adaption of the CS14 King's variant. This includes Aero style [[Head-up display|HUD]] with white displays and gauges for oil pressure, boost, and voltage in the centre console, along with a [[Momo (company)|MOMO]] steering wheel and leather gear knob. The interior trim is also revised.\n\nHandling improvements include multi-link suspension, firmer shocks and springs, front strut brace, and a rear sway bar. A large [[Ferrari F40|F40]] style rear spoiler and aero bodykit with Autech indicators are also fitted. An \"Autech Version K's MF-T\" badge and sticker can be found on the boot.\n\nAn [[IHI Corporation|IHI]] [[ball bearing]] turbo (VN14) was fitted in favour of the [[Garrett Advancing Motion|Garrett]] T28 for slightly quicker response and flow. Larger 480 cc injectors found in the later S15 Spec R's were also fitted as well as a thicker 80&nbsp;mm intercooler also found in S15's. To help expel exhaust, a higher flowing Fujitsubo Giken (FGK) exhaust was fitted.\n\nThe engine is an Autech-tuned [[Nissan SR20DET|SR20DET]] that produces 182[[Watt#Kilowatt|kW]] (245[[Horsepower|hp]]/250[[Horsepower#Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung 70020 (DIN 70020)|PS]]).\n\nAccording to the Autech website, the vehicle is still available at a cost of \u00a52.99 million [[Japanese yen|yen]] (around 27,000 US dollars).{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n== S15 ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image =Nissan S15 200SX.jpg\n| caption = Nissan Silvia 200SX (S15) in New Zealand\n| name = Nissan Silvia (S15)\n| production = January 1999\u20132002\n| assembly=[[Kanda, Fukuoka]] ([[Nissan Shatai]] Plant)\n| engine = {{unbulleted list|2.0&nbsp;L ''[[SR20DE]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]|2.0&nbsp;L [[Nissan SR engine#SR20DET|SR20DET]] I4 turbo}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|5-speed manual|6-speed manual|4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]}}\n| platform= [[Nissan S platform]]\n| layout=[[FR layout]]\n| body_style = {{unbulleted list|2-door [[coupe]]|2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2525|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4445|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1695|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1285|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1200|-|1450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| aka = {{unbulleted list|Nissan 200SX (AUS/NZ)}}\n}}\n\nJapan saw a new version of the Silvia: The S-15 in 1999, now boasting {{cvt|250|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,400 rpm and {{cvt|28|kgm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 4,800 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] from its [[Nissan SR20DET|SR20DET]] [[Inline-four engine]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=27291|website=carfolio.com|title=1999 Nissan Silvia spec-R S15 GF-S15 |date=February 28, 2013|accessdate=July 25, 2018}}</ref> thanks to a [[ball bearing]] [[turbocharger]] upgrade, as well as improved [[engine management system]].

The body dimensions were reduced from the previous generation so that it would comply with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|compact class]], which had an effect on sales of the previous model.\n\n[[File:Nissan Silvia spec S (S15) rear.JPG|thumb|left|Nissan Silvia spec-S in Japan]]\nThe S15 Silvia model lineup was initially simplified to just the '''Spec-S''' and '''Spec-R''', both models offering an \"Aero\" variant with a large rear [[Spoiler (automotive)|wing]] and side skirts/valances.\n\nThis generation of the Silvia was only sold in Japan, Australia and New Zealand but was available as a [[Grey import vehicle|grey import]] in most other countries. In Australia and New Zealand the car was sold as the Nissan 200SX.\n\nWithin the Australian domestic market (AUDM), the S15 sold in 2 trim levels as noted above; Spec-S and Spec-R - however both models featured the SR20DET motor, albeit slightly detuned from the [[Japanese domestic market|JDM]] spec cars. Nissan S15s were never officially sold with the [[naturally aspirated]] SR20DE engine in Australia or New Zealand. These two models were available at Nissan showrooms until the Nissan 200SX GT was introduced in 2002, the last year of production for the S15. Main differences here were namely the wheels being finished in a silver shadow chrome, chrome interior door handles, chrome gear selector surround, \"sports\" metal pedal set and an updated larger rear wing.\n\nAs of August 2002, Nissan stopped producing the [[Nissan S platform|S platform]] with the S15-series Nissan Silvia being the final variant. Production of the Silvia ended amidst Nissan's efforts to reduce its myriad of platforms. The S15 Silvia was therefore the last car to hold the Silvia badge. Nissan's worldwide sports car platform is now the [[Nissan FM platform|FM platform]], which underpins the current [[Nissan Fairlady Z|Fairlady Z]] (the [[Nissan 350Z|350/370Z]] outside Japan), as well as the 2001\u2013present [[Nissan Skyline]] (the [[Infiniti G35|Infiniti G35/37]] in North America).\n\n=== Variants ===\n\n==== Spec-R ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:1999 Nissan Silvia S15 Spec R.jpg|thumb|left|1999 Nissan Silvia Spec-R]]\n\nThe Spec-R differed from previous Silvia models by featuring a 6-speed manual gearbox as well as a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Spec-R also included extensive chassis and suspension strengthening via the use of larger [[anti-roll bars]] and [[strut]] bracing. The S15 featured the same 4-piston front [[brake caliper]]s that were found in the Z32 300ZX but included a larger [[brake booster]].\n\nOne of the biggest changes to the S15 model of the Silvia fitted with the 6-speed [[manual transmission]] built by [[Aisin Seiki]] was the implementation of a helical [[limited-slip differential]]. The result was a safer, more track suited drive; in some contrast to its [[Drifting (motorsport)|drifting]] heritage and subsequent media attention. All other versions of the Silvia (S14, S15 Spec S JDM) came with the viscous limited slip differential.\n\nAs with many Nissans, HICAS (High Capacity Active Steering) four-wheel steering was available as an option.\n\n==== Spec-S ====\n\nThe Spec-S featured a 5-speed [[manual transmission]] (in addition to a 4-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] available on both the Spec-S and the Spec-R). It lacked the additional chassis support of the Spec-R; featured 4-piston front brake caliper and a slightly smaller brake booster. The Spec-S came only with an open differential. Australian-delivered Spec-S models featured the same helical differential, chassis bracing and 6 speed manual transmission as the Australian market Spec-R models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlyrepairmanuals.com/nissan/ |title=Nissan Factory Service Manual - Free Nissan FSM |publisher=Guapro Media |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}</ref>\n\nThe S15 line was later expanded to include various luxury and upgrade option packages for both the Spec-S and Spec-R. [[Autech]], a specialty car developer, also offered several tuned versions of the S15; one with body and interior trim modeled after the [[Ferrari 456]], called the style-A, available in both Spec-S and Spec-R based trims; and a second tuned version was based on the Spec-S trim level with the engine output increased to {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} through the use of increased [[compression ratio|compression]], more aggressive [[camshaft]]s, and free-breathing intake and exhaust tracts, along with ECU tuning and upgrades to the chassis and suspension. This version also included the 6-speed transmission and other upgrades normally found only in the Spec-R.\n\n====Silvia Varietta====\n[[File:Nissan Silvia Varietta 002.JPG|thumb|Nissan Silvia Varietta in Japan]]\nIn Japan, Nissan offered a [[retractable hardtop]] variant of the Silvia, called the '''Varietta'''. The Varietta was built by [[Autech]] and was based on the Spec-S model, featuring the same naturally aspirated engine, with a choice of the 5-speed manual transmission or the 4-speed automatic transmission. This is a rare type of Nissan Silvia which is uncommon in most places as only 1143 car were produced.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Motorsports ==\n\n[[File:MikiS15.jpg|right|thumbnail|200px | S15 Silvia of {{D1|2004}} [[D1 Grand Prix|D1GP]] champion [[Ryuji Miki]]]]\nThe S-chassis is a popular [[Drifting (motorsport)|drift car]], especially the S13 through S15 vehicles. This is due to the extreme versatility and huge aftermarket for the S-chassis, many professional racecars have been built just by off the shelf suspension and engine components. The car has enjoyed success in the sport, having won 7 D1 Grand Prix championships with 5 different drivers driving the S15 (Nobuteru Taniguchi:2001; Ryuji Miki:2004; Yasuyuki Kazama:2005; Masato Kawabata:2007; Youichi Imamura:2009, 2010, 2011. Odi Bakchis, a pro-level drifter from USA that started drifting in 2011, has an S14 that races in Formula Drift, finishing third in the Formula Drift USA Championship. He has multiple event wins and has placed in the Top 5 overall in Formula Drift for the past 4 years. In 2018 Formula Drift driver James Deane campaigned and won the PRO championship in the Worthouse Drift Team S15.<ref>{{cite web |last= Terrell |first= Joe |title= Ultimate Nissan Silvia S15 Guide |url= https://www.drifted.com/nissan-silvia-s15/ |publisher= Drifted |accessdate= August 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn Europe, the S13 has also been very popular with pro-level drifters, especially in countries like the United Kingdom, Poland, France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Russia and Ukraine. While some have opted to use the SR20DET engine from Nissan, most drivers have swapped in a larger RB25DET unit, or even the Toyota Supra derived 2JZ, like Pawel Trela from Poland. [http://japtalk.com/2011/09/pawel-trelas-nissan-200sx-s13/]\n\nSilvias have been raced successfully in the All-Japan Grand Touring Car Championship (now [[Super GT]]) and its predecessors. Both the S14 and S15 generations of the Silvia won the GT300 class championship in 1997 and 2001 respectively. In the late Eighties, when [[Group B]] was banned, S110 and S12 Silvias also saw limited success in [[rallying]], mainly on endurance rallies. During the S13's production, there was a one-make series in Japan. The S13s were also successful in racing in the IMSA GTU class during the 1990s.\n\nThe Silvia S15 of Under Suzuki has dominated the Tsukuba circuit lap time record for some time. After it defeated the [[HKS (company)|HKS]] CT230R [[LanEvo]] for the record in 2012, Under Suzuki's S15 has been resetting Tsukuba's lap time record. The latest lap record is currently timed at 50.366s, even faster than an official [[JGTC]] race car ARTA [[Honda NSX|NSX]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.farmofminds.com/tsukuba-circuit-lap-time-record-51-127/ |title=Tsukuba Circuit lap time record: 51.127! |website=Farmofminds.com |date=2014-12-26 |accessdate=2017-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtimeattack.com/index.php/under-suzuki-resets-tsukuba-lap-record/ |title=Under Suzuki resets Tsukuba lap record \u2013 again! \u2013 World Time Attack Challenge |website=Worldtimeattack.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.speedhunters.com/2012/12/uncharted-territory-under-suzuki-52-sec-lap/ |title=Uncharted Territory: Under Suzuki's 52-sec Lap |website=Speedhunters.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-16}}</ref><ref>http://www.speedhunters.com/2017/12/time-attacked-is-it-all-over/</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Nissan Silvia}}\n*[http://www.s15oc.com S15oc.com - '''Official S15 Owners Club''' - Forums, Guides, Technical Support, Events, Classified Adverts and more]\n*[http://S12Silvia.com S12Silvia.com] - Blog, Forum, and Tech for the International S12 Community\n*[http://www.200SX.gr 200SX.gr] Hellas 200sx Club\n*[http://www.sxoc.com/vbb SXOC] UK 200sx owners club\n*[http://history.nissan.co.jp/SILVIA/S15/0201/index.html Nissan Silvia S15]\u2014Archive of Nissan's official site for the S15 Silvia. {{in lang|ja}}\n*[http://club-s12.org Club-S12.org - International Nissan Silvia/Gazelle/200SX S12 Site] - International Nissan S12 Chassis specific site.\n*[http://www.nissansilvia.com Nissan Silvia]\u2014Australian Nissan Silvia Club.\n*[http://www.silviawa.com SilviaWA] - Nissan Silvia Car Club of Western Australia\n*[http://www.zilvia.net Zilvia] - S chassis and Z chassis owners\n*[https://www.drifted.com/nissan-silvia-s15/ Ultimate Nissan Silvia S15 Guide] - S15 model information, specifications, motorsport history and common performance upgrades\n*[http://autospeed.com/cms/A_111229/article.html History of the Silvia] Autospeed Magazine (note: some technical inaccuracies and minor nomenclature errors)\n*[http://www11.atwiki.jp/papercraft/pages/38.html Paper scale model of the Nissan Silvia.] To download, print and build yourself.\n*http://gtr-registry.com/en-s15-silvia-200sx.php#S15ColoursBreakdown\n{{Modern European Nissan vehicles}}\n{{Nissan}}\n{{North American Datsun vehicles}}\n\n[[Category:Nissan vehicles|Silvia]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Vehicles with four-wheel steering]]\n[[Category:Rally cars]]\n[[Category:Sports cars]]\n[[Category:Sport compact cars]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Hardtop convertibles]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1964]]\n[[Category:Group B cars]]\n", "name_user": "StayGoId", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Silvia"}

Also [[Algeciras]].\n\n==History==\n===Launch===\n'''Al Jazeera Satellite Channel''', now known as AJA, was launched on 1 November 1996 following the closure of the [[BBC]]'s [[Arabic language]] television station, a joint venture with [[Orbit Communications Company]]. The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to suppress information, including a graphic report on executions and prominent dissident views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allied-media.com/aljazeera/jazeera_history.html |title=AL JAZEERA TV: The History of the Controversial Middle East News Station Arabic News Satellite Channel History of the Controversial Station |publisher=Allied-media |accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[List of emirs of Qatar|Emir of Qatar]], [[Sheikh]] [[Hamad bin Khalifa]], provided a loan of [[Qatari riyal|QAR]] 500 million ([[US$]]137&nbsp;million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book ''Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West''. Shares were held by private investors as well as the [[Qatar]] government.\n\n[[File:Al jazeera arabic.jpg|thumb|Al Jazeera Arabic Building]]\nAl Jazeera's first day on the air was 1 November 1996. It offered 6 hours of programming per day; this increased to 12 hours of programming by the end of 1997. It was broadcast to the immediate neighborhood as a terrestrial signal, and on cable. Al Jazeera is also available through satellites (which was also free to users in the Arab world), although Qatar, and many other Arab countries barred private individuals from having satellite dishes until 2001.\n\nAt the time of the Al Jazeera Media Network launch [[Arabsat]] was the only satellite broadcasting to the Middle East, and for the first year could only offer Al Jazeera a weak [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponder that needed a large satellite dish for reception. A more powerful [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] transponder became available as a peace-offering after its user, [[Canal France International]], accidentally beamed 30 minutes of pornography into ultraconservative Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201141941/www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&n=france-seeks-to-soothe-arab-anger-over-porn-film-1997-07-23|title=France seeks to soothe Arab anger over porn film|date=|newspaper=Hurriyet|accessdate=17 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAl Jazeera was not the first such broadcaster in the Middle East; a number had appeared since the Arabsat satellite, a Saudi Arabia-based venture of 21 Arab governments, took orbit in 1985. The unfolding of [[Operation Desert Storm]] on [[CNN International]] underscored the power of live television in current events. While other local broadcasters in the region would assiduously avoid material embarrassing to their home governments (Qatar had its own official TV station as well), Al Jazeera was pitched as an impartial news source and platform for discussing issues relating to the Arab world.\n\nIn presenting \"The opinion and the other opinion\" (the station's motto), it did not take long for Al Jazeera to shock local viewers by presenting Israelis speaking [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] on Arab television for the first time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Lively and far-ranging talk shows, particularly a popular, confrontational one called ''The Opposite Direction'', were a constant source of controversy regarding issues of morality and religion. This prompted a torrent of criticism from the conservative voices among the region's press. It also led to official complaints and censures from neighboring governments. Some jammed Al Jazeera's terrestrial broadcast or expelled its correspondents. In 1999, the Algerian government reportedly cut power to several major cities in order to censor one broadcast. There were also commercial repercussions: Saudi Arabia reportedly pressured advertisers to avoid the channel, to great effect.\n\nAl Jazeera was the only international news network to have correspondents in Iraq during the [[Operation Desert Fox]] bombing campaign in 1998. In a precursor of a pattern to follow, its exclusive video clips were highly prized by [[Western culture|Western]] media.\n\n===Around the clock===\n1 January 1999 was Al Jazeera's first day of 24-hour broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/11/2008410115625813175.html |title=A decade of growth |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees. The agency had bureaux at a dozen sites as far away as EU and Russia. Its annual budget was estimated at about $25&nbsp;million at the time.\n\nHowever controversial, Al Jazeera was rapidly becoming one of the most influential news agencies in the whole region. Eager for news beyond the official versions of events, Arabs became dedicated viewers. A 2000 estimate pegged nightly viewership at 35 million, ranking Al Jazeera first in the Arab world, over the Saudi Arabia-sponsored [[Middle East Broadcasting Centre]] (MBC) and London's [[Arab News Network]] (ANN). There were about 70 satellite or terrestrial channels being broadcast to the Middle East, most of them in Arabic. Al Jazeera launched a free Arabic-language web site in January 2001. In addition, the TV feed was soon available in the United Kingdom for the first time via [[British Sky Broadcasting]].\n\n===War in Afghanistan===\nAl Jazeera came to the attention of many in the West during the hunt for [[Osama bin Laden]] and the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan after the [[11 September attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]] on the United States. It aired videos it received from Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, deeming new footage of the world's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy. Some criticized the network for giving a voice to terrorists.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joel Campagna |url=http://cpj.org/reports/2001/10/aljazeera-oct01.php |title=Between Two Worlds |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Bryson |url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |title=Analysis: Is Rumsfeld's Criticism of Al-Jazeera Justified? |publisher=Newsmax |date=30 October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127185534/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |archivedate=27 January 2013}}</ref> Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C., bureau chief, Hafez al-Mirazi, compared the situation to that of the [[Unabomber]]'s messages in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joe Eskenazi |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/20801/al-jazeera-not-all-bin-laden-all-the-time-d-c-bureau-chief-says/ |title=Al-Jazeera not 'all bin Laden, all the time,' D.C. bureau chief says |publisher=Jweekly |date=17 October 2003 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> The network said it had been given the tapes because it had a large Arab audience.<ref>{{cite news |author=Fouad Ajami |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/18/magazine/18ALJAZEERA.html?pagewanted=all |title=What the Muslim World Is Watching |newspaper=The New York Times |date=18 November 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany other TV networks were eager to acquire the same footage.

It also took in fees for sharing its news feed with other networks. It had an estimated 45 million viewers around the world. Al Jazeera soon had to contend with a new rival, [[Al Arabiya]], an offshoot of the [[Middle East Broadcasting Center]], which was set up in nearby Dubai with Saudi financial backing.<ref>{{cite news |author=Peter Feuilherade |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2780985.stm |title=Al-Jazeera competitor launches |newspaper=BBC News |date=20 February 2003 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===2003 Iraq War===\nBefore and during the United States-led invasion of Iraq, where Al Jazeera had a presence since 1997, the network's facilities and footage were again highly sought by international networks. The channel and its web site also were seeing unprecedented attention from viewers looking for alternatives to embedded reporting and military press conferences.\n\nAl Jazeera moved its sports coverage to a new, separate channel on 1 November 2003, allowing for more news and public affairs programming on the original channel.

Prior to the arrival of Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to watch TV channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of [[freedom of speech]] on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states on the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about Syria's relationship with Lebanon, and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera Media Network of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program ''El-Itidjah el-Mouakass'' (\"The Opposite Direction\"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country) to prevent the program from being seen.<ref name=\"boot\">{{cite web |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |title=Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel that is Challenging the We |accessdate=25 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115033945/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |archivedate=15 January 2008}} TV programme feat.

However, it was not until late 2001 that Al Jazeera achieved worldwide recognition, when it broadcast video statements by [[al-Qaeda]] leaders.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2460705.stm |title=Al Jazeera and Bin Laden |newspaper=BBC News |date=14 November 2002 |accessdate=12 April 2012 |first=Kathryn |last=Westcott}}</ref>\n\nSome observers have argued that Al Jazeera Media Network has formidable authority as an opinion-maker. Noah Bonsey and Jeb Koogler, for example, writing in the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', argue that the way in which the station covers any future Israeli-Palestinian peace deal could well determine whether or not that deal is actually accepted by the Palestinian public.<ref>[http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/does_the_path_to_middle_east_p.php CJR.org], Does the Path to Middle East Peace Stop in Doha?</ref>\n\n<blockquote><p>The channel's tremendous popularity has also, for better or worse, made it a shaper of public opinion. Its coverage often determines what becomes a story and what does not, as well as how Arab viewers think about issues. Whether in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, or Syria, the stories highlighted and the criticisms aired by guests on Al Jazeera's news programs have often significantly affected the course of events in the region.</p>\n\n<p>In Palestine, the station's influence is particularly strong. Recent polling indicates that in the West Bank and Gaza, Al Jazeera is the primary news source for an astounding 53.4 percent of Palestinian viewers. The second and third most watched channels, Palestine TV and Al Arabiya, poll a distant 12.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The result of Al Jazeera's market dominance is that it has itself become a mover and shaker in Palestinian politics, helping to craft public perceptions and influence the debate. This has obvious implications for the peace process: how Al Jazeera covers the deliberations and the outcome of any negotiated agreement with Israel will fundamentally shape how it is viewed\u2014and, more importantly, whether it is accepted\u2014by the Palestinian public.</p></blockquote>\n\nAl Jazeera's broad availability in the Arab world \"operat[ing] with less constraint than almost any other Arab outlet, and remain[ing] the most popular channel in the region\", has been perceived as playing a part in the [[Arab Spring]], including the [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolutions]].

Also [[Algeciras]].\n\n==History==\n===Launch===\n'''Al Jazeera Satellite Channel''', now known as AJA, was launched on 1 November 1996 following the closure of the [[BBC]]'s [[Arabic language]] television station, a joint venture with [[Orbit Communications Company]]. The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to suppress information, including a graphic report on executions and prominent dissident views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allied-media.com/aljazeera/jazeera_history.html |title=AL JAZEERA TV: The History of the Controversial Middle East News Station Arabic News Satellite Channel History of the Controversial Station |publisher=Allied-media |accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[List of emirs of Qatar|Emir of Qatar]], [[Sheikh]] [[Hamad bin Khalifa]], provided a loan of [[Qatari riyal|QAR]] 500 million ([[US$]]137&nbsp;million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book ''Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West''. Shares were held by private investors as well as the [[Qatar]] government.\n\n[[File:Al jazeera arabic.jpg|thumb|Al Jazeera Arabic Building]]\nAl Jazeera's first day on the air was 1 November 1996. It offered 6 hours of programming per day; this increased to 12 hours of programming by the end of 1997. It was broadcast to the immediate neighborhood as a terrestrial signal, and on cable. Al Jazeera is also available through satellites (which was also free to users in the Arab world), although Qatar, and many other Arab countries barred private individuals from having satellite dishes until 2001.\n\nAt the time of the Al Jazeera Media Network launch [[Arabsat]] was the only satellite broadcasting to the Middle East, and for the first year could only offer Al Jazeera a weak [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponder that needed a large satellite dish for reception. A more powerful [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] transponder became available as a peace-offering after its user, [[Canal France International]], accidentally beamed 30 minutes of pornography into ultraconservative Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201141941/www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&n=france-seeks-to-soothe-arab-anger-over-porn-film-1997-07-23|title=France seeks to soothe Arab anger over porn film|date=|newspaper=Hurriyet|accessdate=17 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAl Jazeera was not the first such broadcaster in the Middle East; a number had appeared since the Arabsat satellite, a Saudi Arabia-based venture of 21 Arab governments, took orbit in 1985. The unfolding of [[Operation Desert Storm]] on [[CNN International]] underscored the power of live television in current events. While other local broadcasters in the region would assiduously avoid material embarrassing to their home governments (Qatar had its own official TV station as well), Al Jazeera was pitched as an impartial news source and platform for discussing issues relating to the Arab world.\n\nIn presenting \"The opinion and the other opinion\" (the station's motto), it did not take long for Al Jazeera to shock local viewers by presenting Israelis speaking [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] on Arab television for the first time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Lively and far-ranging talk shows, particularly a popular, confrontational one called ''The Opposite Direction'', were a constant source of controversy regarding issues of morality and religion. This prompted a torrent of criticism from the conservative voices among the region's press. It also led to official complaints and censures from neighboring governments. Some jammed Al Jazeera's terrestrial broadcast or expelled its correspondents. In 1999, the Algerian government reportedly cut power to several major cities in order to censor one broadcast. There were also commercial repercussions: Saudi Arabia reportedly pressured advertisers to avoid the channel, to great effect.\n\nAl Jazeera was the only international news network to have correspondents in Iraq during the [[Operation Desert Fox]] bombing campaign in 1998. In a precursor of a pattern to follow, its exclusive video clips were highly prized by [[Western culture|Western]] media.\n\n===Around the clock===\n1 January 1999 was Al Jazeera's first day of 24-hour broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/11/2008410115625813175.html |title=A decade of growth |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees, and the agency had bureaux at a dozen sites as far as EU and Russia. Its annual budget was estimated at about $25&nbsp;million at the time.\n\nHowever controversial, Al Jazeera was rapidly becoming one of the most influential news agencies in the whole region. Eager for news beyond the official versions of events, Arabs became dedicated viewers. A 2000 estimate pegged nightly viewership at 35 million, ranking Al Jazeera first in the Arab world, over the Saudi Arabia-sponsored [[Middle East Broadcasting Centre]] (MBC) and London's [[Arab News Network]] (ANN). There were about 70 satellite or terrestrial channels being broadcast to the Middle East, most of them in Arabic. Al Jazeera launched a free Arabic-language web site in January 2001. In addition, the TV feed was soon available in the United Kingdom for the first time via [[British Sky Broadcasting]].\n\n===War in Afghanistan===\nAl Jazeera came to the attention of many in the West during the hunt for [[Osama bin Laden]] and the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan after the [[11 September attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]] on the United States. It aired videos it received from Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, deeming new footage of the world's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy. Some criticized the network for giving a voice to terrorists.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joel Campagna |url=http://cpj.org/reports/2001/10/aljazeera-oct01.php |title=Between Two Worlds |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Bryson |url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |title=Analysis: Is Rumsfeld's Criticism of Al-Jazeera Justified? |publisher=Newsmax |date=30 October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127185534/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |archivedate=27 January 2013}}</ref> Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C., bureau chief, Hafez al-Mirazi, compared the situation to that of the [[Unabomber]]'s messages in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joe Eskenazi |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/20801/al-jazeera-not-all-bin-laden-all-the-time-d-c-bureau-chief-says/ |title=Al-Jazeera not 'all bin Laden, all the time,' D.C. bureau chief says |publisher=Jweekly |date=17 October 2003 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> The network said it had been given the tapes because it had a large Arab audience.<ref>{{cite news |author=Fouad Ajami |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/18/magazine/18ALJAZEERA.html?pagewanted=all |title=What the Muslim World Is Watching |newspaper=The New York Times |date=18 November 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany other TV networks were eager to acquire the same footage.

It also took in fees for sharing its news feed with other networks. It had an estimated 45 million viewers around the world. Al Jazeera soon had to contend with a new rival, [[Al Arabiya]], an offshoot of the [[Middle East Broadcasting Center]], which was set up in nearby Dubai with Saudi financial backing.<ref>{{cite news |author=Peter Feuilherade |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2780985.stm |title=Al-Jazeera competitor launches |newspaper=BBC News |date=20 February 2003 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===2003 Iraq War===\nBefore and during the United States-led invasion of Iraq, where Al Jazeera had a presence since 1997, the network's facilities and footage were again highly sought by international networks. The channel and its web site also were seeing unprecedented attention from viewers looking for alternatives to embedded reporting and military press conferences.\n\nAl Jazeera moved its sports coverage to a new, separate channel on 1 November 2003, allowing for more news and public affairs programming on the original channel.

Prior to the arrival of Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to watch TV channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of [[freedom of speech]] on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states on the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about Syria's relationship with Lebanon, and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera Media Network of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program ''El-Itidjah el-Mouakass'' (\"The Opposite Direction\"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country) to prevent the program from being seen.<ref name=\"boot\">{{cite web |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |title=Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel that is Challenging the We |accessdate=25 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115033945/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |archivedate=15 January 2008}} TV programme feat.

However, it was not until late 2001 that Al Jazeera achieved worldwide recognition, when it broadcast video statements by [[al-Qaeda]] leaders.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2460705.stm |title=Al Jazeera and Bin Laden |newspaper=BBC News |date=14 November 2002 |accessdate=12 April 2012 |first=Kathryn |last=Westcott}}</ref>\n\nSome observers have argued that Al Jazeera Media Network has formidable authority as an opinion-maker. Noah Bonsey and Jeb Koogler, for example, writing in the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', argue that the way in which the station covers any future Israeli-Palestinian peace deal could well determine whether or not that deal is actually accepted by the Palestinian public.<ref>[http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/does_the_path_to_middle_east_p.php CJR.org], Does the Path to Middle East Peace Stop in Doha?</ref>\n\n<blockquote><p>The channel's tremendous popularity has also, for better or worse, made it a shaper of public opinion. Its coverage often determines what becomes a story and what does not, as well as how Arab viewers think about issues. Whether in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, or Syria, the stories highlighted and the criticisms aired by guests on Al Jazeera's news programs have often significantly affected the course of events in the region.</p>\n\n<p>In Palestine, the station's influence is particularly strong. Recent polling indicates that in the West Bank and Gaza, Al Jazeera is the primary news source for an astounding 53.4 percent of Palestinian viewers. The second and third most watched channels, Palestine TV and Al Arabiya, poll a distant 12.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The result of Al Jazeera's market dominance is that it has itself become a mover and shaker in Palestinian politics, helping to craft public perceptions and influence the debate. This has obvious implications for the peace process: how Al Jazeera covers the deliberations and the outcome of any negotiated agreement with Israel will fundamentally shape how it is viewed\u2014and, more importantly, whether it is accepted\u2014by the Palestinian public.</p></blockquote>\n\nAl Jazeera's broad availability in the Arab world \"operat[ing] with less constraint than almost any other Arab outlet, and remain[ing] the most popular channel in the region\", has been perceived as playing a part in the [[Arab Spring]], including the [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolutions]].
