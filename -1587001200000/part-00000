It follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest by his father King [[Dasharatha]], on request of his step-mother [[Kaikeyi]]. His travels across forests in India with his wife [[Sita]] and brother [[Lakshmana]], the kidnapping of his wife by [[Ravana]], the great king of [[Lanka]], resulting in a war with him, and Ram's eventual return to [[Ayodhya]] to be crowned king. This is the culmination point of the epic. It is the most sacred book, and is read by millions of people every year. \n\nThere have been many attempts to unravel the epic's historical growth and compositional layers; various recent scholars' estimates for the earliest stage of the text range from the 7th to 4th centuries BCE, with later stages extending up to the 3rd century CE.<ref name=\"Brockington1998\">{{cite book|author=J.

It consists of nearly 24,000 [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] (mostly set in the [[Shloka]]/[[Anustubh]] meter), divided into six Kands (Adi (Bala) Kand, Ayodhya Kand, Aranya Kand, Kishkindha Kand, Sundara Kand, Lanka Kand) and about 500 sargas (chapters). Uttar kand which is also read today in ramayan is a part of kakbhusundi garud samvad and is not a part of original valkimi ramayan <ref>https://valmikiramayan.net/</ref>. In [[Hindu]] tradition, it is considered to be the ''Adi-kavya'' (first poem). It depicts the duties of relationships, portraying ideal characters like the ideal father, the ideal servant, the ideal brother, the ideal husband and the ideal king. ''Ramayana'' was an important influence on later [[Sanskrit]] poetry and Hindu life and culture. Like ''Mahabharata'', ''Ramayana'' presents the teachings of ancient Hindu sages in narrative [[allegory]], interspersing philosophical and ethical elements. The characters [[Rama]], [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]], [[Hanuman]],  and [[Ravana]] are all fundamental to the cultural consciousness of the [[South Asian]] nations of [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], and the [[South-East Asian]] countries of [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]].\n\nThere are many [[Versions of Ramayana|versions of ''Ramayana'']] in Indian languages, besides Buddhist, Sikh, and [[Rama in Jainism|Jain]] adaptations. There are also [[Cambodia]]n, [[Indonesia]]n, [[Philippines|Filipino]], [[Thailand|Thai]], [[Laos|Lao]], [[Myanmar|Burmese]], and [[Malaysia]]n versions of the tale.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe name ''Ramayana'' means \"Rama\" + \"Aayana\" , where as Rama is name of Lord or God and Aayana means Path or Way. The literal meaning of the name is \"the journey of R\u0101ma\" or \"the career of R\u0101ma\" or in other words path or way taken or chosen by Rama during the human life cycle form at earth, during [[Hindu units of time|Treta Yuga]] [[Hindu units of time|(869000 years ago)]] in Jambudweep(Java Plum)/Aryavart/India.<ref>Robert Goldman and Sally Sutherland Goldman, 'R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a', in ''Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', ed. by Knut A.

The text survives in several thousand partial and complete manuscripts, the oldest of which is a [[palm-leaf manuscript]] found in Nepal and dated to the 11th century CE.

Textual scholar [[Robert P. Goldman]] differentiates two major regional revisions: the northern (n) and the southern (s). Scholar [[Romesh Chunder Dutt]] writes that \"the ''Ramayana'', like the ''Mahabharata'', is a growth of centuries, but the main story is more distinctly the creation of one mind.\"\n\nThere has been discussion as to whether the first and the last volumes (Bala Kand and Uttara Kand) of Valmiki's ''Ramayana'' were composed by the original author.

However, the general cultural background of the ''Ramayana'' is one of the post-[[urbanization]] periods of the eastern part of north [[India]], while the ''Mahabharata'' reflects the Kuru areas west of this, from the [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] to the late [[Vedas|Vedic]] period.\n\nBy tradition, the text belongs to the [[Treta Yuga]], second of the four eons ([[Yuga]]) of [[Hindu]] chronology. [[Rama]] is said to have been born in the [[Hindu units of time|Treta Yuga (869000 years ago)]] to king [[Dasharatha]] in the [[Ikshvaku dynasty]].\n\nThe names of the characters (Rama, Sita, Dasharatha, [[Janaka]], [[Vashista]], [[Vishwamitra]]) are all known only in the late [[Vedic]] literature.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} For instance, a king named Janaka appears in a lengthy dialogue in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad '']] with no reference to Rama or the ''Ramayana''.<ref>''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad ''4:1:1; trans.

According to the modern [[academic]] view, [[Vishnu]], who, according to [[Bala Kanda]], was incarnated as [[Rama]], first came into prominence with the epics themselves and further, during the puranic period of the later 1st millennium CE. Also, in the epic Mahabharata, there is a version of the ''Ramayana'' known as ''Ramopakhyana''. This version is depicted as a narration to [[Yudhishthira]].\n\nBooks two to six form the oldest portion of the epic, while the first and last books (Bala Kand and Uttara Kand, respectively) are later additions: style differences and narrative contradictions between these two volumes and the rest of the epic have led scholars since Hermann Jacobi to the present toward this consensus.<ref>Ajay K.

Once, Kaikeyi saved Dasaratha in a war and as a reward, she got the privilege from Dasaratha to fulfil two of her wishes at any time of her lifetime. She made use of the opportunity and forced Dasharatha to make their son Bharata crown prince and send Rama into exile for 14 years. Dasharatha dies heartbroken after Rama goes into exile.\n* '''[[Rama]]''' is the main character of the tale. Portrayed as the seventh avatar of god [[Vishnu]], he is the eldest and favourite son of [[Dasharatha]], the king of Ayodhya and his Chief Queen, [[Kausalya]]. He is portrayed as the epitome of virtue. Dasharatha is forced by Kaikeyi to command Rama to relinquish his right to the throne for fourteen years and go into exile. Rama kills the evil demon Ravana, who abducted his wife Sita, and later returns to Ayodhya to form an ideal state.\n[[File:Rama and monkey chiefs.jpg|thumb|right|Rama and the monkey chiefs]]\n* '''[[Sita]]''' (Vaidehi) is another of the tale's protagonists.She was the blood of sages who sacrificed their lives to develop the powerful force to get rid of earth from demons. This blood was collected in a pot and was buried in Earth, so She is called the daughter of Mother Earth, adopted by King Janaka, and Rama's beloved wife. Rama went to [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] and got a chance to marry her by breaking the Shiv Dhanush (bow) while trying to tie a knot to it in a competition organized by King Janaka of [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]]. The competition was to find the most suitable husband for Sita and many princes from different states competed to win her. Sita is the avatara of goddess [[Lakshmi]], the consort of Vishnu. Sita is portrayed as the epitome of female purity and virtue. She follows her husband into exile and is abducted by the Lanka's king Ravana. She is imprisoned on the island of [[Lanka]], until Rama rescues her by defeating Ravana. Later, she gives birth to twin boys [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]].\n* '''[[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]]''' is the son of Dasharatha and Queen Kaikeyi. when he learns that his mother Kaikeyi has forced Rama into exile and caused Dasharatha to die brokenhearted, he storms out of the palace and goes in search of Rama in the forest. When Rama refuses to return from his exile to assume the throne, Bharata obtains Ram's sandals and places them on the throne as a gesture that Rama is the true king. Bharata then rules Ayodhya as the regent of Rama for the next fourteen years, staying outside the city of Ayodhya. He was married to [[Mandavi]].\n* '''[[Lakshmana]]''' (Saumitra) is a younger brother of Rama, who chose to go into exile with him. He is the son of King Dasharatha and Queen Sumitra and twin of Shatrughna. Lakshmana is portrayed as an avatar of [[Shesha]], the [[n\u0101ga]] associated with the god Vishnu. He spends his time protecting Sita and Rama, during which time he fights the demoness [[Shurpanakha]]. He is forced to leave Sita, who was deceived by the demon [[Maricha]] into believing that Rama was in trouble. Sita is abducted by Ravana upon his leaving her. He was married to Sita's younger sister [[Urmila]].\n* '''[[Shatrughna]]''' (Shatrughna means Ripudaman: Killer of enemies) is a son of Dasharatha and his third wife Queen Sumitra.

He is believed to live until our modern world.\n* '''[[Sugriva]]''', a vanara king who helped Rama regain Sita from Ravana. He had an agreement with Rama through which Vali \u2013 Sugriva's brother and king of Kishkindha \u2013 would be killed by Rama in exchange for Sugriva's help in finding Sita.

He was son of [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] and Tara and nephew of [[Sugriva]]. Angada and Tara are instrumental in reconciling [[Rama]] and his brother, [[Lakshmana]], with [[Sugriva]] after Sugriva fails to fulfill his promise to help Rama find and rescue his wife. Together they are able to convince Sugriva to honour his pledge to Rama instead of spending his time carousing and drinking.\n\n;Riksha\n* '''[[Jambavan]]/Jamvanta''' is known as Riksharaj (King of the Rikshas).

Dasharatha was the King of Ayodhya. He had three wives: Kaushalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra. He was childless for a long time and anxious to have an heir, so he performs a fire sacrifice known as ''Putra-kameshti Yajna''. As a consequence, Rama was first born to Kaushalya, Bharata was born to Kaikeyi, Lakshmana and Shatrughna were born to Sumitra. These sons are endowed, to various degrees, with the essence of the Supreme Trinity Entity [[Vishnu]]; Vishnu had opted to be born into mortality to combat the demon [[Ravana]], who was oppressing the gods, and who could only be destroyed by a mortal. The boys were reared as the princes of the realm, receiving instructions from the scriptures and in warfare from Vashistha. When Rama was 16 years old, sage Vishwamitra comes to the court of Dasharatha in search of help against demons who were disturbing sacrificial rites. He chooses Rama, who is followed by Lakshmana, his constant companion throughout the story. Rama and Lakshmana receive instructions and supernatural weapons from Vishwamitra and proceed to destroy the demons: [[Tataka]] and many more.\n\n[[Janaka]] was the King of [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]]. One day, a female child was found in the field by the King in the deep furrow dug by his plough. Overwhelmed with joy, the King regarded the child as a \"miraculous gift of God\". The child was named Sita, the Sanskrit word for furrow. Sita grew up to be a girl of unparalleled beauty and charm. The King had decided that who ever could lift and wield the heavy bow, presented to his ancestors by [[Shiva]], could marry Sita. Sage Vishwamitra takes Rama and Lakshmana to Mithila to show the bow. Then Rama desires to lift it and goes on to wield the bow and when he draws the string, it broke.<ref>{{cite book|title=CANTO LXVII.: THE BREAKING OF THE BOW.|publisher=sacredtexts.com|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rama/ry067.htm|accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref> Marriages were arranged between the sons of Dasharatha and daughters of Janaka.

On the eve of the great event, Kaikeyi \u2013 her jealousy aroused by [[Manthara]], a wicked maidservant \u2013 claims two boons that Dasharatha had long ago granted her. Kaikeyi demands Rama to be exiled into the wilderness for fourteen years, while the succession passes to her son Bharata. The heartbroken king, constrained by his rigid devotion to his given word, accedes to Kaikeyi's demands. Rama accepts his father's reluctant decree with absolute submission and calm self-control which characterises him throughout the story. He is joined by Sita and Lakshmana. When he asks Sita not to follow him, she says, \"the forest where you dwell is Ayodhya for me and Ayodhya without you is a veritable hell for me.\" After Ram's departure, King Dasharatha, unable to bear the grief, passes away. Meanwhile, Bharata who was on a visit to his maternal uncle, learns about the events in Ayodhya. Bharata refuses to profit from his mother's wicked scheming and visits Rama in the forest. He requests Rama to return and rule. But Rama, determined to carry out his father's orders to the letter, refuses to return before the period of exile.\n[[File:Rama leaving for fourteen years of exile from Ayodhya.jpg|thumb|800px|center|<center>Rama leaving for fourteen years of exile from Ayodhya.</center>]]\n\n===''Aranya Kanda''===\n\n{{Main|Aranya Kanda}}\n\n[[File:Ravi Varma-Ravana Sita Jathayu.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ravana]] fights [[Jatayu]] as he carries off the kidnapped Sita.

At the [[Panchavati]] forest they are visited by a [[rakshasi]] named [[Shurpanakha]], sister of Ravana. She tries to seduce the brothers and, after failing, attempts to kill Sita. Lakshmana stops her by cutting off her nose and ears. Hearing of this, her brothers [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]] and Dushan organise an attack against the princes. Rama defeats Khara and his raskshasas.\n\nWhen the news of these events reach Ravana, he resolves to destroy Rama by capturing Sita with the aid of the ''rakshasa'' [[Maricha]]. Maricha, assuming the form of a golden deer, captivates Sita's attention. Entranced by the beauty of the deer, Sita pleads with Rama to capture it. Rama, aware that this is the ploy of the demons, cannot dissuade Sita from her desire and chases the deer into the forest, leaving Sita under Lakshmana's guard. After some time, Sita hears Rama calling out to her; afraid for his life, she insists that Lakshmana rush to his aid. Lakshmana tries to assure her that Rama cannot be hurt that easily and that it is best if he continues to follow Ram's orders to protect her. On the verge of hysterics, Sita insists that it is not she but Rama who needs Lakshman's help. He obeys her wish but stipulates that she is not to leave the cottage or entertain any stranger. He draws a chalk outline, the [[Lakshmana rekha|Lakshmana rekha]], around the cottage and casts a spell on it that prevents anyone from entering the boundary but allows people to exit. With the coast finally clear, Ravana appears in the guise of an ascetic requesting Sita's hospitality. Unaware of her guest's plan, Sita is tricked into leaving the rekha and is then forcibly carried away by Ravana.<ref>Rajarajan, R.K.K.

At Lanka, Sita is kept under the guard of ''rakshasis''. Ravana asks Sita to marry him, but she refuses, being eternally devoted to Rama. Meanwhile, Rama and Lakshmana learn about Sita's abduction from Jatayu and immediately set out to save her. During their search, they meet [[Kabandha]] and the ascetic [[Shabari]], who direct them towards Sugriva and Hanuman.\n\n===''Kishkindha Kanda''===\n\n[[File:Stone bas relief at Banteay Srei in Cambodia.jpg|thumb|A stone bas-[[relief]] at Banteay Srei in [[Cambodia]] depicts the combat between [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] and [[Sugriva]] (middle). To the right, Rama fires his bow. To the left, Vali lies dying.]]\n\n''Kishkindha Kanda'' is set in the [[ape]] (''Vanara'') citadel [[Kishkindha]]. Rama and Lakshmana meet Hanuman, the biggest devotee of Rama, greatest of ape heroes and an adherent of [[Sugriva]], the banished pretender to the throne of Kishkindha. Rama befriends Sugriva and helps him by killing his elder brother [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] thus regaining the kingdom of Kishkindha, in exchange for helping Rama to recover Sita. However Sugriva soon forgets his promise and spends his time in enjoying his powers. The clever former ape queen [[Tara (Ramayana)|Tara]] (wife of Vali) calmly intervenes to prevent an enraged Lakshmana from destroying the ape citadel. She then eloquently convinces Sugriva to honour his pledge. Sugriva then sends search parties to the four corners of the earth, only to return without success from north, east and west. The southern search party under the leadership of [[Angada]] and Hanuman learns from a vulture named [[Sampati]] (elder brother of Jatayu), that Sita was taken to Lanka.\n\n===''Sundara Kanda''===\n\n{{Main|Sundara Kanda}}\n[[File:Sita at ashokavana.jpg|thumb|right|Ravana is meeting Sita at Ashokavana. Hanuman is seen on the tree.]]\n\n''Sundara Kand'' forms the heart of Valmiki's Ramyana and consists of a detailed, vivid account of [[Hanuman]]'s adventures. After learning about Sita, Hanuman [[shapeshifting|assumes]] a gargantuan form and makes a colossal leap across the sea to Lanka. On the way he meets with many challenges like facing a Gandharva kanya who comes in the form of a demon to test his abilities. He encounters a mountain named Mainakudu who offers Hanuman assistance and offers him rest. Hanuman refuses because there is little time remaining to complete the search for Sita.\n\nAfter entering into Lanka, he finds a demon, Lankini, who protects all of Lanka. Hanuman fights with her and subjugates her in order to get into Lanka. In the process Lankini, who had an earlier vision/warning from the gods that the end of Lanka nears if someone defeats Lankini. Here, Hanuman explores the demons' kingdom and spies on Ravana. He locates Sita in Ashoka grove, where she is being wooed and threatened by Ravana and his rakshasis to marry Ravana. Hanuman reassures Sita, giving Ram's signet ring as a sign of good faith. He offers to carry Sita back to Ram; however, she refuses and says that it is not the dharma, stating that Ramyana will not have significance if Hanuman carries her to Rama \u2013 \"When Rama is not there Ravana carried Sita forcibly and when Ravana was not there, Hanuman carried Sita back to Ram\". She says that Rama himself must come and avenge the insult of her abduction.\n\nHanuman then wreaks havoc in Lanka by destroying trees and buildings and killing Ravana's warriors. He allows himself to be captured and delivered to Ravana. He gives a bold lecture to Ravana to release Sita. He is condemned and his tail is set on fire, but he escapes his bonds and leaping from roof to roof, sets fire to Ravana's citadel and makes the giant leap back from the island. The joyous search party returns to Kishkindha with the news.\n\n===''Yuddha Kanda''===\n\n[[File:Battle at Lanka, Ramayana, Udaipur, 1649-53.jpg|thumb|The ''Battle at Lanka, Ramyana'' by [[Sahibdin]].

Having received Hanuman's report on Sita, Rama and Lakshmana proceed with their allies towards the shore of the southern sea. There they are joined by Ravana's renegade brother [[Vibhishana]]. The apes named [[Nala]] and [[Nila (Ramayana)|Nila]] construct a floating bridge (known as [[Adam's Bridge|Rama Setu]])<ref>Rajarajan, R.K.K.

The princes and their army cross over to Lanka. A lengthy war ensues. During a battle, Ravana's son [[Indrajit]] hurls a powerful weapon at Lakshmana, who is badly wounded. So Hanuman assumes a gigantic form and flies from Lanka to the Himalayas. Upon reaching Mount Sumeru, Hanuman was unable to identify the herb that could cure Lakshmana and so decided to bring the entire mountain back to Lanka. Eventually, the war ends when Rama kills Ravana. Rama then installs Vibhishana on the throne of Lanka.\n\nOn meeting Sita, Rama asks her to undergo an Agni Pariksha (test of fire) to prove her chastity, as he wants to get rid of the rumors surrounding her purity. When Sita plunges into the sacrificial fire, [[Agni]], lord of fire raises Sita, unharmed, to the throne, attesting to her innocence. The episode of ''Agni Pariksha'' varies in the versions of Ramayana by Valmiki and [[Tulsidas]]. In [[Tulsidas]]'s [[Ramacharitamanas]], Sita was under the protection of Agni (see [[Maya Sita|Maya Sita]]) so it was necessary to bring her out before reuniting with Rama.\n\n=== ''Uttara Kanda'' ===\nUttara Kanda is considered to be the last book of Ramayana. It is a book of kakbhusundi-garud samvad. This book was added by tulsidas as tulsidas listened the ramayan from kakbhusundi and garud .It depicts Ram's reign of [[Ayodhya (Ramayana)|Ayodhya]], birth of [[Lava (Ramayana)|Luv]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kush]], the [[Ashvamedha]] [[yajna]] and last days of Rama. At the expiration of his term of exile, Rama returns to Ayodhya with Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman, where the coronation is performed. On being asked to prove his devotion to Rama, Hanuman tears his chest open and to everyone's surprise, there is an image of Rama and Sita inside his chest. Rama rules Ayodhya and the reign is called 'Ram-rajya' (a place where the common folk are happy, fulfilled and satisfied). Uttar Kand is not a part of the original Valmiki Ramayan. The writing style varies greatly from the first six books and has inconsistency in the events with the previous books.\n\n=== ''Luv kush Kanda'' ===\nThis is a kanda which was not written in original valmiki ramayan and nor by tulsidas.<ref>https://valmikiramayan.net/</ref>\nThis is totally an chapter added afterwards and no authentication of this chapter is seen in original ramayana of tulsidas and valmiki. \nIn this Chapter as time passes in reign of rama, spies start getting rumours that people are questioning Sita's purity as she stayed in the home of another man for a year without her husband. The common folk start gossiping about Sita and question Ram's decision to make her Queen. Rama is extremely distraught on hearing the news, but finally tells Lakshmana that \"Purity of the Queen of Ayodhya has to be above any gossip and rumour. Take Sita to a forest outside Ayodhya and leave her there. Also tell her not to identify herself as the Queen of Ayodhya as that would be an insult to our forefathers\". Lakshmana reluctantly drops Sita in a forest for another exile.\n\nSita finds refuge in Sage [[Valmiki]]'s ashRama, where she gives birth to twin boys, Luv and Kush. [[Shambuka]], a [[shudra]] ascetic, is slain by Rama for attempting to perform penance. This act of Shambuka is perceived by Rama as an act in violation of [[dharma]] as he believes that the bad [[karma]], resulting from this act, caused the death of a [[Brahmin]]'s son in his kingdom.<ref>Government of Maharashtra, ''Nasik District Gazeteer: History - Ancient Period'' {{cite web |url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/nasik/005%20History/001%20AncientPeriod.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107163101/http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/nasik/005%20History/001%20AncientPeriod.htm |archivedate=7 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }} (text credited to Mahamahopadhyaya Dr. V.

Luv and Kusha capture the horse (sign of the yajna) and defeat the whole army of Ayodhya which come to protect the horse. Later on, both the brothers defeat [[Lakshmana]], Bharat, Shatrughan and other warriors and take Hanuman as prisoner. Finally Rama himself arrives and defeats the 2 mighty brothers. Valmiki updates Sita about this development and advises both the brothers to go to Ayodhya and tell the story of Sita's sacrifice to the common folks. Both brothers arrive at Ayodhya but face many difficulties while convincing the people. Hanuman helps both the brothers in this task . At one point of time, Valmiki brings Sita forward. Seeing Sita, Rama realises that Luv and Kush are his own sons. Again complicit Nagarsen (One of the primaries who instigated the hatred towards Sita) challenged Sita's character and asked her to prove her purity. Sita is overflown with emotions and decides to go back to the mother earth from where she emerged. She prays to [[Bh\u016bmi|Bhoomidevi]] (Goddess of Earth), the ground breaks into half and closes after Sita vanishes into it. Rama rules Ayodhya for many years and finally takes samadhi into River [[Sarayu]] along with his 3 brothers and leaves the world. He goes back to [[Vaikuntha|Vaikunth]] in his [[Vishnu]] form.\n\n==Versions==\n\n{{see also|Versions of Ramayana}}\n\n[[File:Wat phra keaw ramayana fresco.jpg|thumb|right|The epic story of ''Ramyana'' was adopted by several cultures across Asia.

[[Prambanan]] Trimurti temple near [[Yogyakarta]], [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]\n\nAs in many oral epics, multiple versions of the ''Ramayana'' survive. In particular, the ''Ramayana'' related in north India differs in important respects from that preserved in south India and the rest of southeast Asia. There is an extensive tradition of oral storytelling based on ''Ramayana'' in [[Indonesia]], [[Cambodia]], [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Maldives]].\n\n===India===\nThere are diverse regional versions of the ''Ramayana'' written by various authors in India. Some of them differ significantly from each other. During the 12th century, [[Kambar (poet)|Kamban]] wrote [[Ramavataram]], known popularly as [[Kambaramayanam]] in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], but references to [[Ramayana in Tamil literature|Ramayana story appear in Tamil literature]] as early as 300 BC. A [[Telugu language|Telugu]] version, [[Ranganatha Ramayanam]], was written by [[Gona Budda Reddy]] in the 14th century. The earliest translation to a regional Indo-Aryan language is the early 14th century [[Saptakanda Ramayana]] in [[Assamese language|Assamese]] by [[Madhava Kandali]]. Valmiki's ''Ramayana'' inspired [[Sri Ramacharit Manas]] by [[Tulsidas]] in 1576, an epic [[Awadhi]] (a dialect of Hindi) version with a slant more grounded in a different realm of Hindu literature, that of [[bhakti]]; it is an acknowledged masterpiece of India, popularly known as ''Tulsi-krita Ramayana''. [[Gujarat]]i poet Premanand wrote a version of the ''Ramayana'' in the 17th century. Other versions include [[Krittivasi Ramayan]], a [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version by [[Krittibas Ojha]] in the 15th century; [[Vilanka Ramayana]] by 15th century poet [[Sarala Dasa]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC|publisher=Infobase Publishing|date=1 January 2006|isbn=9780816075645|first=Constance|last=Jones|first2=James D.|last2=Ryan}}</ref> and ''[[Dandi Ramayana]]'' (also known as ''[[Jagamohana Ramayana]]'') by 16th century poet Balarama Dasa, both in [[Odia language|Odia]]; a Torave Ramayana in [[Kannada]] by 16th-century poet Narahari; [[Adhyathmaramayanam]], a [[Malayalam]] version by [[Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan]] in the 16th century; in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] by Sridhara in the 18th century; in [[Maithili language|Maithili]] by Chanda Jha in the 19th century; and in the 20th century, Rashtrakavi [[Kuvempu]]'s [[Sri Ramayana Darshanam]] in [[Kannada]].\n\nThere is a sub-plot to the ''Ramayana'', prevalent in some parts of India, relating the adventures of [[Ahiravan]] and Mahi Ravana, evil brother of Ravana, which enhances the role of Hanuman in the story. Hanuman rescues Rama and Lakshmana after they are kidnapped by the Ahi-Mahi Ravana at the behest of Ravana and held prisoner in a cave, to be sacrificed to the goddess [[Kali]]. [[Adbhuta Ramayana]] is a version that is obscure but also attributed to [[Valmiki]] \u2013 intended as a supplementary to the original [[Valmiki Ramayana]]. In this variant of the narrative, Sita is accorded far more prominence, such as elaboration of the events surrounding her birth \u2013 in this case to [[Ravana]]'s wife, [[Mandodari]] as well as her conquest of Ravana's older brother in the [[Mahakali]] form.\n\n====Early references in Tamil literature====\n{{main|Ramayana in Tamil literature}}\nEven before [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]] wrote the [[Ramavataram]] in Tamil in the 12th century AD, there are many ancient references to the story of Ramayana, implying that the story was familiar in the Tamil lands even before the Common Era.

Rama (called R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita in this version) was the son of Kaushalya, first wife of Dasharatha. Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a (Lakkha\u1e47a) was a sibling of Rama and son of Sumitra, the second wife of Dasharatha.  Sita was the wife of Rama. To protect his children from his wife Kaikeyi, who wished to promote her son Bharata, Dasharatha sent the three to a hermitage in the Himalayas for a twelve-year exile. After nine years, Dasharatha died and Lakkha\u1e47a and Sita returned; R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita, in deference to his father's wishes, remained in exile for a further two years. This version does not include the abduction of S\u012bt\u0101.There is no Ravan in this version i.e. no Ram-ravan war.\n\nIn the explanatory commentary on J\u0101taka, R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita is said to have been a previous incarnation of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and Sita an incarnation of [[Yasodhar\u0101]].\n\nBut, [[Ravana]] appears in other Buddhist literature, the [[Lankavatara Sutra]].\n\n====Jain version====\n\n{{main|Rama in Jainism|Salakapurusa}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n[[Jain]] versions of the ''Ramayana'' can be found in the various [[Jain agama (disambiguation)|Jain agama]]s like Ravisena's [[Padma Purana|Padmapurana]] (story of Padmaja and [[Rama]], Padmaja being the name of [[Sita]]), [[Hemacandra]]'s [[Salakapurusa|Trisastisalakapurusa charitra]] (hagiography of 63 illustrious persons), Sanghadasa's ''Vasudevahindi'' and ''Uttarapurana'' by Gunabhadara. According to [[Jain cosmology]], every [[Kalachakra (Jainism)|half time cycle]] has nine sets of [[Balarama]], [[Vasudeva]] and prativasudeva. Rama, [[Lakshmana]] and [[Ravana]] are the eighth [[Balarama|baladeva]], [[vasudeva]] and [[prativasudeva]] respectively. [[Padmanabh Jaini]] notes that, unlike in the Hindu Puranas, the names Baladeva and Vasudeva are not restricted to [[Balarama]] and [[Krishna]] in Jain Puranas. Instead they serve as names of two distinct classes of mighty brothers, who appear nine times in each half time cycle and jointly rule half the earth as half-[[chakravartin]]s. Jaini traces the origin of this list of brothers to the ''jinacharitra'' (lives of jinas) by [[Acharya Bhadrabahu]] (3d\u20134th century BCE).\n\nIn the Jain epic of ''Ramayana'', it is not Rama who kills Ravana as told in the Hindu version. Perhaps this is because Rama, a liberated Jain Soul in his last life, is unwilling to kill.<ref name=\"A.K\">{{cite book|last1=Ramanujan|first1=A.K|title=The Collected Essays of A.K. Ramanujan|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi|page=145|edition=4. impr.|url=http://www.trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/three-hundred-Ramayanas-A-K-Ramanujan.pdf}}</ref> Instead, it is Lakshmana who kills Ravana.<ref name=\"A.K\"/> In the end, Rama, who led an upright life, renounces his kingdom, becomes a [[Jain monasticism|Jain monk]] and attains [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]]. On the other hand, Lakshmana and Ravana go to [[Naraka (Jainism)|Hell]]. However, it is predicted that ultimately they both will be reborn as upright persons and attain liberation in their future births. According to [[Jain texts]], Ravana will be the future [[Tirthankara]] (omniscient teacher) of Jainism.\n\nThe Jain versions have some variations from Valmiki's ''Ramayana''. Dasharatha, the king of Saketa had four queens: Aparajita, Sumitra, Suprabha and Kaikeyi. These four queens had four sons. Aparajita's son was Padma and he became known by the name of Rama. Sumitra's son was Narayana: he came to be known by another name, lakshmana. Kaikeyi's son was Bharata and Suprabha's son was Shatrughna. Furthermore, not much was thought of Ram's fidelity to Sita. According to the Jain version, Rama had four chief queens: Maithili, Prabhavati, Ratinibha, and Sridama. Furthermore, Sita takes renunciation as a Jain ascetic after Rama abandons her and is reborn in heaven. Rama, after lakshman's death, also renounces his kingdom and becomes a Jain monk. Ultimately, he attains [[Kevala Jnana]] omniscience and finally liberation. Rama predicts that Ravana and Lakshmana, who were in the [[Naraka (Jainism)|fourth hell]], will attain liberation in their future births. Accordingly, Ravana is the future tirthankara of the next half ascending time cycle and Sita will be his [[Ganadhara]].\n\n====Sikh version====\n\nIn [[Guru Granth Sahib]], there is a description of two types of ''Ramayana''. One is a spiritual ''Ramayana'' which is the actual subject of Guru Granth Sahib, in which Ravana is ego, Sita is ''budhi'' (intellect), Rama is inner soul and Laxman is ''mann'' (attention, mind). Guru Granth Sahib also believes in the existence of [[Dashavatara]] who were kings of their times which tried their best to restore order to the world. King Rama (Ramchandra) was one of those who is not covered in Guru Granth Sahib. Guru Granth Sahib states:\n:\u0a39\u0a41\u0a15\u0a2e\u0a3f \u0a09\u0a2a\u0a3e\u0a0f \u0a26\u0a38 \u0a05\u0a09\u0a24\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a3e\u0965\n:\u0939\u0941\u0915\u092e\u093f \u0909\u092a\u093e\u090f \u0926\u0938 \u0905\u0909\u0924\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0965\n:By [[hukam]] (supreme command), he created his ten incarnations\nThis version of the ''Ramayana'' was written by [[Guru Gobind Singh]], which is part of [[Dasam Granth]].\n\nHe also said that the almighty, invisible, all prevailing God created great numbers of Indras, Moons and Suns, Deities, Demons and sages, and also numerous saints and Brahmanas (enlightened people). But they too were caught in the noose of death (Kaal) ([[transmigration of the soul]]). This is similar to the explanation in [[Bhagavad Gita]] which is part of the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.<ref>[https://www.bhagavad-gita.us/bhagavad-gita-11-32/ Bhagavad Gita 11.32]</ref>\n\n===Nepal===\n\nBesides being the site of discovery of the oldest surviving manuscript of the ''Ramayana'', Nepal gave rise to two regional variants in mid 19th \u2013 early 20th century. One, written by [[Bhanubhakta Acharya]], is considered the first epic of [[Nepali language]], while the other, written by [[Siddhidas Mahaju]] in [[Nepal Bhasa]] was a foundational influence in the [[Nepal Bhasa renaissance]].\n\n[[Bhanubhakta Ramayana|Ramayana]] written by [[Bhanubhakta Acharya]] is one of the most popular verses in Nepal. The popularization of the ''Ramayana'' and its tale, originally written in [[Sanskrit Language]] was greatly enhanced by the work of Bhanubhakta. Mainly because of his writing of Nepali Ramayana, Bhanubhakta is also called ''Aadi Kavi'' or ''The Pioneering Poet''.\n\n===Southeast Asian===\n\n====Cambodia====\n\n[[File:Sita Ravana Cambodia.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cambodian classical dancers as Sita and Ravana, the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh (c. 1920s)]]\nThe Cambodian version of the ''Ramayana'', [[Reamker]] ({{lang-km|\u179a\u17b6\u1798\u1780\u17c1\u179a\u17d2\u178a\u17b7\u17cd}} - ''Glory of Ram''), is the most famous story of Khmer literature since the [[Kingdom of Funan]] era.

It follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest by his father King [[Dasharatha]], on request of his step-mother [[Kaikeyi]]. His travels across forests in India with his wife [[Sita]] and brother [[Lakshmana]], the kidnapping of his wife by [[Ravana]], the great king of [[Lanka]], resulting in a war with him, and Ram's eventual return to [[Ayodhya]] to be crowned king. This is the culmination point of the epic. It is the most sacred book, and is read by millions of people every year. \n\nThere have been many attempts to unravel the epic's historical growth and compositional layers; various recent scholars' estimates for the earliest stage of the text range from the 7th to 4th centuries BCE, with later stages extending up to the 3rd century CE.<ref name=\"Brockington1998\">{{cite book|author=J.

It consists of nearly 24,000 [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] (mostly set in the [[Shloka]]/[[Anustubh]] meter), divided into six Kands (Adi (Bala) Kand, Ayodhya Kand, Aranya Kand, Kishkindha Kand, Sundara Kand, Lanka Kand) and about 500 sargas (chapters). Uttar kand which is also read today in ramayan is a part of kakbhusundi garud samvad and is not a part of original valkimi ramayan <ref>https://valmikiramayan.net/</ref>. In [[Hindu]] tradition, it is considered to be the ''Adi-kavya'' (first poem). It depicts the duties of relationships, portraying ideal characters like the ideal father, the ideal servant, the ideal brother, the ideal husband and the ideal king. ''Ramayana'' was an important influence on later [[Sanskrit]] poetry and Hindu life and culture. Like ''Mahabharata'', ''Ramayana'' presents the teachings of ancient Hindu sages in narrative [[allegory]], interspersing philosophical and ethical elements. The characters [[Rama]], [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]], [[Hanuman]],  and [[Ravana]] are all fundamental to the cultural consciousness of the [[South Asian]] nations of [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], and the [[South-East Asian]] countries of [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]].\n\nThere are many [[Versions of Ramayana|versions of ''Ramayana'']] in Indian languages, besides Buddhist, Sikh, and [[Rama in Jainism|Jain]] adaptations. There are also [[Cambodia]]n, [[Indonesia]]n, [[Philippines|Filipino]], [[Thailand|Thai]], [[Laos|Lao]], [[Myanmar|Burmese]], and [[Malaysia]]n versions of the tale.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe name ''Ramayana'' means \"Rama\" + \"Aayana\" , where as Rama is name of Lord or God and Aayana means Path or Way. The literal meaning of the name is \"the journey of R\u0101ma\" or \"the career of R\u0101ma\" or in other words path or way taken or chosen by Rama during the human life cycle form at earth, during [[Hindu units of time|Treta Yuga]] [[Hindu units of time|(869000 years ago)]] in Jambudweep(Java Plum)/Aryavart/India.<ref>Robert Goldman and Sally Sutherland Goldman, 'R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a', in ''Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', ed. by Knut A.

The definition of ''itih\u0101sa'' is a narrative of past events (''pur\u0101v\u1e5btta'') which includes teachings on [[Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha|the goals of human life]].

The text survives in several thousand partial and complete manuscripts, the oldest of which is a [[palm-leaf manuscript]] found in Nepal and dated to the 11th century CE. A Times of India report dated 18 December 2015 informs about the discovery of a 6th-century manuscript of the ''Ramayana'' at the Asiatic Society library, [[Kolkata]].<ref name=\"Dasa Griba Rakshash Charitram Vadha\">{{cite news|last1=Mukherjee Pandey|first1=Jhimli|title=6th-century Ramayana found in Kolkata, stuns scholars|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/6th-century-Ramayana-found-in-Kolkata-stuns-scholars/articleshow/50227724.cms|accessdate=20 December 2015|agency=TNN|newspaper=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|date=18 Dec 2015 <!-- 09.08AM IST --> }}</ref> The ''Ramayana'' text has several regional renderings, recensions and sub recensions. Textual scholar [[Robert P. Goldman]] differentiates two major regional revisions: the northern (n) and the southern (s). Scholar [[Romesh Chunder Dutt]] writes that \"the ''Ramayana'', like the ''Mahabharata'', is a growth of centuries, but the main story is more distinctly the creation of one mind.\"\n\nThere has been discussion as to whether the first and the last volumes (Bala Kand and Uttara Kand) of Valmiki's ''Ramayana'' were composed by the original author. Most Hindus still believe they are integral parts of the book, in spite of some style differences and narrative contradictions between these two volumes and the rest of the book.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nRetellings include [[Kambar (poet)|Kamban]]'s ''[[Ramavataram]]'' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] (c. 11th\u201312th century), [[Gona Budda Reddy]]'s ''Ramayanam'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] (c. 13th century), [[Madhava Kandali]]'s [[Saptakanda Ramayana]] in [[Assamese language|Assamese]] (c. 14th century), [[Krittibas Ojha]]'s [[Krittivasi Ramayan]] (also known as ''Shri Ram Panchali'') in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] (c. 15th century), [[Sarala Das]]' [[Vilanka Ramayana]] (c. 15th century)<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=The History of Medieval Vaishnavism in Orissa|author=Mukherjee, P.|date=1981|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=9788120602298|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7LFzfbhmJcMC&pg=PA74|page=74|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|title=Living Thoughts of the Ramayana|date=2002|publisher=Jaico Publishing House|isbn=9788179920022|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BMyxwk5g3NEC&pg=PT7|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"google3\">{{cite book|title=A Critical Inventory of R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a Studies in the World: Foreign languages|author1=Krishnamoorthy, K.|author2=Mukhopadhyay, S.|author3=Sahitya Akademi|date=1991|publisher=Sahitya Akademi in collaboration with Union Academique Internationale, Bruxelles|isbn=9788172015077|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NgeTtWkD0VkC&pg=PR27|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"google4\">{{cite book|title=R\u0101makath\u0101 and Other Essays|author1=Bulcke, C.|author2=Pras\u0101da, D.|date=2010|publisher=Vani Prakashan|isbn=9789350001073|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cvE4wF-cfX0C&pg=PA116|page=116|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref> and Balarama Dasa's ''Dandi Ramayana'' (also known as the ''Jagamohan Ramayana'') (c. 16th century) both in [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Sant (religion)|sant]] [[Eknath]]'s [[Bhavarth Ramayan]] (c. 16th century) in [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Tulsidas]]' [[Ramcharitamanas]] (c. 16th century) in [[Awadhi]] (which is an eastern form of [[Hindi]]) and [[Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan]]'s [[Adhyathmaramayanam]] in [[Malayalam]].\n\n==Period==\n\n[[File:Avatars.jpg|thumb|Rama (left third from top) depicted in the [[Dashavatara]], the ten avatars of [[Vishnu]]. Painting from [[Jaipur]], now at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]]]\n\nIn terms of narrative time, the action of the ''Ramayana'' predates the ''[[Mahabharata]]''. However, the general cultural background of the ''Ramayana'' is one of the post-[[urbanization]] periods of the eastern part of north [[India]], while the ''Mahabharata'' reflects the Kuru areas west of this, from the [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] to the late [[Vedas|Vedic]] period.\n\nBy tradition, the text belongs to the [[Treta Yuga]], second of the four eons ([[Yuga]]) of [[Hindu]] chronology. [[Rama]] is said to have been born in the [[Hindu units of time|Treta Yuga (869000 years ago)]] to king [[Dasharatha]] in the [[Ikshvaku dynasty]].\n\nThe names of the characters (Rama, Sita, Dasharatha, [[Janaka]], [[Vashista]], [[Vishwamitra]]) are all known only in the late [[Vedic]] literature.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} For instance, a king named Janaka appears in a lengthy dialogue in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad '']] with no reference to Rama or the ''Ramayana''.<ref>''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad ''4:1:1; trans.

According to the modern [[academic]] view, [[Vishnu]], who, according to [[Bala Kanda]], was incarnated as [[Rama]], first came into prominence with the epics themselves and further, during the puranic period of the later 1st millennium CE. Also, in the epic Mahabharata, there is a version of the ''Ramayana'' known as ''Ramopakhyana''. This version is depicted as a narration to [[Yudhishthira]].\n\nBooks two to six form the oldest portion of the epic, while the first and last books (Bala Kand and Uttara Kand, respectively) are later additions: style differences and narrative contradictions between these two volumes and the rest of the epic have led scholars since Hermann Jacobi to the present toward this consensus.<ref>Ajay K.

He has three queens, [[Kausalya]], [[Kaikeyi]] and [[Sumitra]], and four sons: [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]], and twins [[Lakshmana]], Shatrughna and Rama. Once, Kaikeyi saved Dasaratha in a war and as a reward, she got the privilege from Dasaratha to fulfil two of her wishes at any time of her lifetime. She made use of the opportunity and forced Dasharatha to make their son Bharata crown prince and send Rama into exile for 14 years. Dasharatha dies heartbroken after Rama goes into exile.\n* '''[[Rama]]''' is the main character of the tale. Portrayed as the seventh avatar of god [[Vishnu]], he is the eldest and favourite son of [[Dasharatha]], the king of Ayodhya and his Chief Queen, [[Kausalya]]. He is portrayed as the epitome of virtue. Dasharatha is forced by Kaikeyi to command Rama to relinquish his right to the throne for fourteen years and go into exile. Rama kills the evil demon Ravana, who abducted his wife Sita, and later returns to Ayodhya to form an ideal state.\n[[File:Rama and monkey chiefs.jpg|thumb|right|Rama and the monkey chiefs]]\n* '''[[Sita]]''' (Vaidehi) is another of the tale's protagonists.She was the blood of sages who sacrificed their lives to develop the powerful force to get rid of earth from demons. This blood was collected in a pot and was buried in Earth, so She is called the daughter of Mother Earth, adopted by King Janaka, and Rama's beloved wife. Rama went to [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] and got a chance to marry her by breaking the Shiv Dhanush (bow) while trying to tie a knot to it in a competition organized by King Janaka of [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]]. The competition was to find the most suitable husband for Sita and many princes from different states competed to win her. Sita is the avatara of goddess [[Lakshmi]], the consort of Vishnu. Sita is portrayed as the epitome of female purity and virtue. She follows her husband into exile and is abducted by the Lanka's king Ravana. She is imprisoned on the island of [[Lanka]], until Rama rescues her by defeating Ravana. Later, she gives birth to twin boys [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]].\n* '''[[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]]''' is the son of Dasharatha and Queen Kaikeyi. when he learns that his mother Kaikeyi has forced Rama into exile and caused Dasharatha to die brokenhearted, he storms out of the palace and goes in search of Rama in the forest. When Rama refuses to return from his exile to assume the throne, Bharata obtains Ram's sandals and places them on the throne as a gesture that Rama is the true king. Bharata then rules Ayodhya as the regent of Rama for the next fourteen years, staying outside the city of Ayodhya. He was married to [[Mandavi]].\n* '''[[Lakshmana]]''' (Saumitra) is a younger brother of Rama, who chose to go into exile with him. He is the son of King Dasharatha and Queen Sumitra and twin of Shatrughna. Lakshmana is portrayed as an avatar of [[Shesha]], the [[n\u0101ga]] associated with the god Vishnu. He spends his time protecting Sita and Rama, during which time he fights the demoness [[Shurpanakha]]. He is forced to leave Sita, who was deceived by the demon [[Maricha]] into believing that Rama was in trouble. Sita is abducted by Ravana upon his leaving her. He was married to Sita's younger sister [[Urmila]].\n* '''[[Shatrughna]]''' (Shatrughna means Ripudaman: Killer of enemies) is a son of Dasharatha and his third wife Queen Sumitra. He is the youngest brother of Rama and also the twin brother of Lakshmana.

He is born as son of Kesari, a Vanara king in Sumeru region and his wife [[A\u00f1jan\u0101]]. He plays an important part in locating Sita and in the ensuing battle. He is believed to live until our modern world.\n* '''[[Sugriva]]''', a vanara king who helped Rama regain Sita from Ravana. He had an agreement with Rama through which Vali \u2013 Sugriva's brother and king of Kishkindha \u2013 would be killed by Rama in exchange for Sugriva's help in finding Sita. Sugriva ultimately ascends the throne of Kishkindha after the slaying of Vali and fulfills his promise by putting the Vanara forces at Ram's disposal. He was married to [[Rum\u0101]].\n* '''[[Angada]]''' is a vanara and the son of Bali (vanar king of Kishkindha before Sugriva) who helped Rama find his wife Sita and fight her abductor, [[Ravana]], in Ramyana. He was son of [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] and Tara and nephew of [[Sugriva]]. Angada and Tara are instrumental in reconciling [[Rama]] and his brother, [[Lakshmana]], with [[Sugriva]] after Sugriva fails to fulfill his promise to help Rama find and rescue his wife. Together they are able to convince Sugriva to honour his pledge to Rama instead of spending his time carousing and drinking.\n\n;Riksha\n* '''[[Jambavan]]/Jamvanta''' is known as Riksharaj (King of the Rikshas). Rikshas are bears. In the epic Ramayana, Jambavantha helped Rama find his wife Sita and fight her abductor, Ravana.

A demi-god who has the form of a [[vulture]] that tries to rescue Sita from Ravana. Jatayu fought valiantly with Ravana, but as Jatayu was very old, Ravana soon got the better of him.

Rama and Sita, Lakshmana and Urmila, Bharata and Mandavi and Shatrughna with Shrutakirti.]]\n\nThis \"Sarga\" (section) details the stories of Rama's childhood and events related the time-frame. Dasharatha was the King of Ayodhya. He had three wives: Kaushalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra. He was childless for a long time and anxious to have an heir, so he performs a fire sacrifice known as ''Putra-kameshti Yajna''. As a consequence, Rama was first born to Kaushalya, Bharata was born to Kaikeyi, Lakshmana and Shatrughna were born to Sumitra. These sons are endowed, to various degrees, with the essence of the Supreme Trinity Entity [[Vishnu]]; Vishnu had opted to be born into mortality to combat the demon [[Ravana]], who was oppressing the gods, and who could only be destroyed by a mortal. The boys were reared as the princes of the realm, receiving instructions from the scriptures and in warfare from Vashistha. When Rama was 16 years old, sage Vishwamitra comes to the court of Dasharatha in search of help against demons who were disturbing sacrificial rites. He chooses Rama, who is followed by Lakshmana, his constant companion throughout the story. Rama and Lakshmana receive instructions and supernatural weapons from Vishwamitra and proceed to destroy the demons: [[Tataka]] and many more.\n\n[[Janaka]] was the King of [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]]. One day, a female child was found in the field by the King in the deep furrow dug by his plough. Overwhelmed with joy, the King regarded the child as a \"miraculous gift of God\". The child was named Sita, the Sanskrit word for furrow. Sita grew up to be a girl of unparalleled beauty and charm. The King had decided that who ever could lift and wield the heavy bow, presented to his ancestors by [[Shiva]], could marry Sita. Sage Vishwamitra takes Rama and Lakshmana to Mithila to show the bow. Then Rama desires to lift it and goes on to wield the bow and when he draws the string, it broke.<ref>{{cite book|title=CANTO LXVII.: THE BREAKING OF THE BOW.|publisher=sacredtexts.com|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rama/ry067.htm|accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref> Marriages were arranged between the sons of Dasharatha and daughters of Janaka. Rama gets married to Sita, [[Lakshmana]] to [[Urmila]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] to [[Mandavi]] and [[Shatrughna]] to [[Shrutakirti]]. The weddings were celebrated with great festivity in [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] and the marriage party returns to Ayodhya.\n\n===''Ayodhya Kanda''===\n[[File:Ayodhya Nagri.jpg|thumb|285px|Gold carving depiction of the legendary [[Ayodhya]] at the [[Ajmer Jain temple]].]]\nAfter Rama and Sita have been married for twelve years, an elderly Dasharatha expresses his desire to crown Rama, to which the Kosala assembly and his subjects express their support. On the eve of the great event, Kaikeyi \u2013 her jealousy aroused by [[Manthara]], a wicked maidservant \u2013 claims two boons that Dasharatha had long ago granted her. Kaikeyi demands Rama to be exiled into the wilderness for fourteen years, while the succession passes to her son Bharata. The heartbroken king, constrained by his rigid devotion to his given word, accedes to Kaikeyi's demands. Rama accepts his father's reluctant decree with absolute submission and calm self-control which characterises him throughout the story. He is joined by Sita and Lakshmana. When he asks Sita not to follow him, she says, \"the forest where you dwell is Ayodhya for me and Ayodhya without you is a veritable hell for me.\" After Ram's departure, King Dasharatha, unable to bear the grief, passes away. Meanwhile, Bharata who was on a visit to his maternal uncle, learns about the events in Ayodhya. Bharata refuses to profit from his mother's wicked scheming and visits Rama in the forest. He requests Rama to return and rule. But Rama, determined to carry out his father's orders to the letter, refuses to return before the period of exile.\n[[File:Rama leaving for fourteen years of exile from Ayodhya.jpg|thumb|800px|center|<center>Rama leaving for fourteen years of exile from Ayodhya.</center>]]\n\n===''Aranya Kanda''===\n\n{{Main|Aranya Kanda}}\n\n[[File:Ravi Varma-Ravana Sita Jathayu.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ravana]] fights [[Jatayu]] as he carries off the kidnapped Sita. Painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]]]\n\nAfter thirteen years of exile, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana journey southward along the banks of river [[Godavari]], where they build cottages and live off the land. At the [[Panchavati]] forest they are visited by a [[rakshasi]] named [[Shurpanakha]], sister of Ravana. She tries to seduce the brothers and, after failing, attempts to kill Sita. Lakshmana stops her by cutting off her nose and ears. Hearing of this, her brothers [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]] and Dushan organise an attack against the princes. Rama defeats Khara and his raskshasas.\n\nWhen the news of these events reach Ravana, he resolves to destroy Rama by capturing Sita with the aid of the ''rakshasa'' [[Maricha]]. Maricha, assuming the form of a golden deer, captivates Sita's attention. Entranced by the beauty of the deer, Sita pleads with Rama to capture it. Rama, aware that this is the ploy of the demons, cannot dissuade Sita from her desire and chases the deer into the forest, leaving Sita under Lakshmana's guard. After some time, Sita hears Rama calling out to her; afraid for his life, she insists that Lakshmana rush to his aid. Lakshmana tries to assure her that Rama cannot be hurt that easily and that it is best if he continues to follow Ram's orders to protect her. On the verge of hysterics, Sita insists that it is not she but Rama who needs Lakshman's help. He obeys her wish but stipulates that she is not to leave the cottage or entertain any stranger. He draws a chalk outline, the [[Lakshmana rekha|Lakshmana rekha]], around the cottage and casts a spell on it that prevents anyone from entering the boundary but allows people to exit. With the coast finally clear, Ravana appears in the guise of an ascetic requesting Sita's hospitality. Unaware of her guest's plan, Sita is tricked into leaving the rekha and is then forcibly carried away by Ravana.<ref>Rajarajan, R.K.K.

At Lanka, Sita is kept under the guard of ''rakshasis''. Ravana asks Sita to marry him, but she refuses, being eternally devoted to Rama. Meanwhile, Rama and Lakshmana learn about Sita's abduction from Jatayu and immediately set out to save her. During their search, they meet [[Kabandha]] and the ascetic [[Shabari]], who direct them towards Sugriva and Hanuman.\n\n===''Kishkindha Kanda''===\n\n[[File:Stone bas relief at Banteay Srei in Cambodia.jpg|thumb|A stone bas-[[relief]] at Banteay Srei in [[Cambodia]] depicts the combat between [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] and [[Sugriva]] (middle).

Rama and Lakshmana meet Hanuman, the biggest devotee of Rama, greatest of ape heroes and an adherent of [[Sugriva]], the banished pretender to the throne of Kishkindha. Rama befriends Sugriva and helps him by killing his elder brother [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] thus regaining the kingdom of Kishkindha, in exchange for helping Rama to recover Sita. However Sugriva soon forgets his promise and spends his time in enjoying his powers. The clever former ape queen [[Tara (Ramayana)|Tara]] (wife of Vali) calmly intervenes to prevent an enraged Lakshmana from destroying the ape citadel. She then eloquently convinces Sugriva to honour his pledge. Sugriva then sends search parties to the four corners of the earth, only to return without success from north, east and west. The southern search party under the leadership of [[Angada]] and Hanuman learns from a vulture named [[Sampati]] (elder brother of Jatayu), that Sita was taken to Lanka.\n\n===''Sundara Kanda''===\n\n{{Main|Sundara Kanda}}\n[[File:Sita at ashokavana.jpg|thumb|right|Ravana is meeting Sita at Ashokavana. Hanuman is seen on the tree.]]\n\n''Sundara Kand'' forms the heart of Valmiki's Ramyana and consists of a detailed, vivid account of [[Hanuman]]'s adventures. After learning about Sita, Hanuman [[shapeshifting|assumes]] a gargantuan form and makes a colossal leap across the sea to Lanka. On the way he meets with many challenges like facing a Gandharva kanya who comes in the form of a demon to test his abilities. He encounters a mountain named Mainakudu who offers Hanuman assistance and offers him rest. Hanuman refuses because there is little time remaining to complete the search for Sita.\n\nAfter entering into Lanka, he finds a demon, Lankini, who protects all of Lanka. Hanuman fights with her and subjugates her in order to get into Lanka. In the process Lankini, who had an earlier vision/warning from the gods that the end of Lanka nears if someone defeats Lankini. Here, Hanuman explores the demons' kingdom and spies on Ravana. He locates Sita in Ashoka grove, where she is being wooed and threatened by Ravana and his rakshasis to marry Ravana. Hanuman reassures Sita, giving Ram's signet ring as a sign of good faith. He offers to carry Sita back to Ram; however, she refuses and says that it is not the dharma, stating that Ramyana will not have significance if Hanuman carries her to Rama \u2013 \"When Rama is not there Ravana carried Sita forcibly and when Ravana was not there, Hanuman carried Sita back to Ram\". She says that Rama himself must come and avenge the insult of her abduction.\n\nHanuman then wreaks havoc in Lanka by destroying trees and buildings and killing Ravana's warriors. He allows himself to be captured and delivered to Ravana. He gives a bold lecture to Ravana to release Sita. He is condemned and his tail is set on fire, but he escapes his bonds and leaping from roof to roof, sets fire to Ravana's citadel and makes the giant leap back from the island. The joyous search party returns to Kishkindha with the news.\n\n===''Yuddha Kanda''===\n\n[[File:Battle at Lanka, Ramayana, Udaipur, 1649-53.jpg|thumb|The ''Battle at Lanka, Ramyana'' by [[Sahibdin]].

Having received Hanuman's report on Sita, Rama and Lakshmana proceed with their allies towards the shore of the southern sea. There they are joined by Ravana's renegade brother [[Vibhishana]]. The apes named [[Nala]] and [[Nila (Ramayana)|Nila]] construct a floating bridge (known as [[Adam's Bridge|Rama Setu]])<ref>Rajarajan, R.K.K.

The princes and their army cross over to Lanka. A lengthy war ensues. During a battle, Ravana's son [[Indrajit]] hurls a powerful weapon at Lakshmana, who is badly wounded. So Hanuman assumes a gigantic form and flies from Lanka to the Himalayas. Upon reaching Mount Sumeru, Hanuman was unable to identify the herb that could cure Lakshmana and so decided to bring the entire mountain back to Lanka. Eventually, the war ends when Rama kills Ravana. Rama then installs Vibhishana on the throne of Lanka.\n\nOn meeting Sita, Rama asks her to undergo an Agni Pariksha (test of fire) to prove her chastity, as he wants to get rid of the rumors surrounding her purity. When Sita plunges into the sacrificial fire, [[Agni]], lord of fire raises Sita, unharmed, to the throne, attesting to her innocence. The episode of ''Agni Pariksha'' varies in the versions of Ramayana by Valmiki and [[Tulsidas]]. In [[Tulsidas]]'s [[Ramacharitamanas]], Sita was under the protection of Agni (see [[Maya Sita|Maya Sita]]) so it was necessary to bring her out before reuniting with Rama.\n\n=== ''Uttara Kanda'' ===\nUttara Kanda is the last book of Ramayana. It is a book of kakbhusundi-garud samvad. This book was added by tulsidas as tulsidas listened the ramayan from kakbhusundi and garud .It depicts Ram's reign of [[Ayodhya (Ramayana)|Ayodhya]], birth of [[Lava (Ramayana)|Luv]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kush]], the [[Ashvamedha]] [[yajna]] and last days of Rama. At the expiration of his term of exile, Rama returns to Ayodhya with Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman, where the coronation is performed. On being asked to prove his devotion to Rama, Hanuman tears his chest open and to everyone's surprise, there is an image of Rama and Sita inside his chest. Rama rules Ayodhya and the reign is called 'Ram-rajya' (a place where the common folk are happy, fulfilled and satisfied).\n\n=== ''Luv kush Kanda'' ===\nThis is a kanda which was not written in original valmiki ramayan and nor by tulsidas.<ref>https://valmikiramayan.net/</ref>\nThis is totally an chapter added afterwards and no authentication of this chapter is seen in original ramayana of tulsidas and valmiki. \nIn this Chapter as time passes in reign of rama, spies start getting rumours that people are questioning Sita's purity as she stayed in the home of another man for a year without her husband. The common folk start gossiping about Sita and question Ram's decision to make her Queen. Rama is extremely distraught on hearing the news, but finally tells Lakshmana that \"Purity of the Queen of Ayodhya has to be above any gossip and rumour. Take Sita to a forest outside Ayodhya and leave her there. Also tell her not to identify herself as the Queen of Ayodhya as that would be an insult to our forefathers\". Lakshmana reluctantly drops Sita in a forest for another exile.\n\nSita finds refuge in Sage [[Valmiki]]'s ashRama, where she gives birth to twin boys, Luv and Kush. [[Shambuka]], a [[shudra]] ascetic, is slain by Rama for attempting to perform penance. This act of Shambuka is perceived by Rama as an act in violation of [[dharma]] as he believes that the bad [[karma]], resulting from this act, caused the death of a [[Brahmin]]'s son in his kingdom.<ref>Government of Maharashtra, ''Nasik District Gazeteer: History - Ancient Period'' {{cite web |url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/nasik/005%20History/001%20AncientPeriod.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107163101/http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/nasik/005%20History/001%20AncientPeriod.htm |archivedate=7 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }} (text credited to Mahamahopadhyaya Dr. V.

Luv and Kusha capture the horse (sign of the yajna) and defeat the whole army of Ayodhya which come to protect the horse. Later on, both the brothers defeat [[Lakshmana]], Bharat, Shatrughan and other warriors and take Hanuman as prisoner. Finally Rama himself arrives and defeats the 2 mighty brothers. Valmiki updates Sita about this development and advises both the brothers to go to Ayodhya and tell the story of Sita's sacrifice to the common folks. Both brothers arrive at Ayodhya but face many difficulties while convincing the people. Hanuman helps both the brothers in this task . At one point of time, Valmiki brings Sita forward. Seeing Sita, Rama realises that Luv and Kush are his own sons. Again complicit Nagarsen (One of the primaries who instigated the hatred towards Sita) challenged Sita's character and asked her to prove her purity. Sita is overflown with emotions and decides to go back to the mother earth from where she emerged. She prays to [[Bh\u016bmi|Bhoomidevi]] (Goddess of Earth), the ground breaks into half and closes after Sita vanishes into it. Rama rules Ayodhya for many years and finally takes samadhi into River [[Sarayu]] along with his 3 brothers and leaves the world. He goes back to [[Vaikuntha|Vaikunth]] in his [[Vishnu]] form.\n\n==Versions==\n\n{{see also|Versions of Ramayana}}\n\n[[File:Wat phra keaw ramayana fresco.jpg|thumb|right|The epic story of ''Ramyana'' was adopted by several cultures across Asia.

[[Prambanan]] Trimurti temple near [[Yogyakarta]], [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]\n\nAs in many oral epics, multiple versions of the ''Ramayana'' survive. In particular, the ''Ramayana'' related in north India differs in important respects from that preserved in south India and the rest of southeast Asia. There is an extensive tradition of oral storytelling based on ''Ramayana'' in [[Indonesia]], [[Cambodia]], [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Maldives]].\n\n===India===\nThere are diverse regional versions of the ''Ramayana'' written by various authors in India. Some of them differ significantly from each other. During the 12th century, [[Kambar (poet)|Kamban]] wrote [[Ramavataram]], known popularly as [[Kambaramayanam]] in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], but references to [[Ramayana in Tamil literature|Ramayana story appear in Tamil literature]] as early as 300 BC. A [[Telugu language|Telugu]] version, [[Ranganatha Ramayanam]], was written by [[Gona Budda Reddy]] in the 14th century. The earliest translation to a regional Indo-Aryan language is the early 14th century [[Saptakanda Ramayana]] in [[Assamese language|Assamese]] by [[Madhava Kandali]]. Valmiki's ''Ramayana'' inspired [[Sri Ramacharit Manas]] by [[Tulsidas]] in 1576, an epic [[Awadhi]] (a dialect of Hindi) version with a slant more grounded in a different realm of Hindu literature, that of [[bhakti]]; it is an acknowledged masterpiece of India, popularly known as ''Tulsi-krita Ramayana''. [[Gujarat]]i poet Premanand wrote a version of the ''Ramayana'' in the 17th century. Other versions include [[Krittivasi Ramayan]], a [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version by [[Krittibas Ojha]] in the 15th century; [[Vilanka Ramayana]] by 15th century poet [[Sarala Dasa]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC|publisher=Infobase Publishing|date=1 January 2006|isbn=9780816075645|first=Constance|last=Jones|first2=James D.|last2=Ryan}}</ref> and ''[[Dandi Ramayana]]'' (also known as ''[[Jagamohana Ramayana]]'') by 16th century poet Balarama Dasa, both in [[Odia language|Odia]]; a Torave Ramayana in [[Kannada]] by 16th-century poet Narahari; [[Adhyathmaramayanam]], a [[Malayalam]] version by [[Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan]] in the 16th century; in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] by Sridhara in the 18th century; in [[Maithili language|Maithili]] by Chanda Jha in the 19th century; and in the 20th century, Rashtrakavi [[Kuvempu]]'s [[Sri Ramayana Darshanam]] in [[Kannada]].\n\nThere is a sub-plot to the ''Ramayana'', prevalent in some parts of India, relating the adventures of [[Ahiravan]] and Mahi Ravana, evil brother of Ravana, which enhances the role of Hanuman in the story. Hanuman rescues Rama and Lakshmana after they are kidnapped by the Ahi-Mahi Ravana at the behest of Ravana and held prisoner in a cave, to be sacrificed to the goddess [[Kali]]. [[Adbhuta Ramayana]] is a version that is obscure but also attributed to [[Valmiki]] \u2013 intended as a supplementary to the original [[Valmiki Ramayana]]. In this variant of the narrative, Sita is accorded far more prominence, such as elaboration of the events surrounding her birth \u2013 in this case to [[Ravana]]'s wife, [[Mandodari]] as well as her conquest of Ravana's older brother in the [[Mahakali]] form.\n\n====Early references in Tamil literature====\n{{main|Ramayana in Tamil literature}}\nEven before [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]] wrote the [[Ramavataram]] in Tamil in the 12th century AD, there are many ancient references to the story of Ramayana, implying that the story was familiar in the Tamil lands even before the Common Era.

Rama (called R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita in this version) was the son of Kaushalya, first wife of Dasharatha. Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a (Lakkha\u1e47a) was a sibling of Rama and son of Sumitra, the second wife of Dasharatha.  Sita was the wife of Rama. To protect his children from his wife Kaikeyi, who wished to promote her son Bharata, Dasharatha sent the three to a hermitage in the Himalayas for a twelve-year exile. After nine years, Dasharatha died and Lakkha\u1e47a and Sita returned; R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita, in deference to his father's wishes, remained in exile for a further two years. This version does not include the abduction of S\u012bt\u0101.There is no Ravan in this version i.e. no Ram-ravan war.\n\nIn the explanatory commentary on J\u0101taka, R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita is said to have been a previous incarnation of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and Sita an incarnation of [[Yasodhar\u0101]].\n\nBut, [[Ravana]] appears in other Buddhist literature, the [[Lankavatara Sutra]].\n\n====Jain version====\n\n{{main|Rama in Jainism|Salakapurusa}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n[[Jain]] versions of the ''Ramayana'' can be found in the various [[Jain agama (disambiguation)|Jain agama]]s like Ravisena's [[Padma Purana|Padmapurana]] (story of Padmaja and [[Rama]], Padmaja being the name of [[Sita]]), [[Hemacandra]]'s [[Salakapurusa|Trisastisalakapurusa charitra]] (hagiography of 63 illustrious persons), Sanghadasa's ''Vasudevahindi'' and ''Uttarapurana'' by Gunabhadara.

Rama, [[Lakshmana]] and [[Ravana]] are the eighth [[Balarama|baladeva]], [[vasudeva]] and [[prativasudeva]] respectively. [[Padmanabh Jaini]] notes that, unlike in the Hindu Puranas, the names Baladeva and Vasudeva are not restricted to [[Balarama]] and [[Krishna]] in Jain Puranas. Instead they serve as names of two distinct classes of mighty brothers, who appear nine times in each half time cycle and jointly rule half the earth as half-[[chakravartin]]s. Jaini traces the origin of this list of brothers to the ''jinacharitra'' (lives of jinas) by [[Acharya Bhadrabahu]] (3d\u20134th century BCE).\n\nIn the Jain epic of ''Ramayana'', it is not Rama who kills Ravana as told in the Hindu version. Perhaps this is because Rama, a liberated Jain Soul in his last life, is unwilling to kill.<ref name=\"A.K\">{{cite book|last1=Ramanujan|first1=A.K|title=The Collected Essays of A.K. Ramanujan|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi|page=145|edition=4. impr.|url=http://www.trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/three-hundred-Ramayanas-A-K-Ramanujan.pdf}}</ref> Instead, it is Lakshmana who kills Ravana.<ref name=\"A.K\"/> In the end, Rama, who led an upright life, renounces his kingdom, becomes a [[Jain monasticism|Jain monk]] and attains [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]]. On the other hand, Lakshmana and Ravana go to [[Naraka (Jainism)|Hell]]. However, it is predicted that ultimately they both will be reborn as upright persons and attain liberation in their future births. According to [[Jain texts]], Ravana will be the future [[Tirthankara]] (omniscient teacher) of Jainism.\n\nThe Jain versions have some variations from Valmiki's ''Ramayana''. Dasharatha, the king of Saketa had four queens: Aparajita, Sumitra, Suprabha and Kaikeyi. These four queens had four sons. Aparajita's son was Padma and he became known by the name of Rama. Sumitra's son was Narayana: he came to be known by another name, lakshmana. Kaikeyi's son was Bharata and Suprabha's son was Shatrughna. Furthermore, not much was thought of Ram's fidelity to Sita. According to the Jain version, Rama had four chief queens: Maithili, Prabhavati, Ratinibha, and Sridama. Furthermore, Sita takes renunciation as a Jain ascetic after Rama abandons her and is reborn in heaven. Rama, after lakshman's death, also renounces his kingdom and becomes a Jain monk. Ultimately, he attains [[Kevala Jnana]] omniscience and finally liberation. Rama predicts that Ravana and Lakshmana, who were in the [[Naraka (Jainism)|fourth hell]], will attain liberation in their future births. Accordingly, Ravana is the future tirthankara of the next half ascending time cycle and Sita will be his [[Ganadhara]].\n\n====Sikh version====\n\nIn [[Guru Granth Sahib]], there is a description of two types of ''Ramayana''. One is a spiritual ''Ramayana'' which is the actual subject of Guru Granth Sahib, in which Ravana is ego, Sita is ''budhi'' (intellect), Rama is inner soul and Laxman is ''mann'' (attention, mind). Guru Granth Sahib also believes in the existence of [[Dashavatara]] who were kings of their times which tried their best to restore order to the world. King Rama (Ramchandra) was one of those who is not covered in Guru Granth Sahib. Guru Granth Sahib states:\n:\u0a39\u0a41\u0a15\u0a2e\u0a3f \u0a09\u0a2a\u0a3e\u0a0f \u0a26\u0a38 \u0a05\u0a09\u0a24\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a3e\u0965\n:\u0939\u0941\u0915\u092e\u093f \u0909\u092a\u093e\u090f \u0926\u0938 \u0905\u0909\u0924\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0965\n:By [[hukam]] (supreme command), he created his ten incarnations\nThis version of the ''Ramayana'' was written by [[Guru Gobind Singh]], which is part of [[Dasam Granth]].\n\nHe also said that the almighty, invisible, all prevailing God created great numbers of Indras, Moons and Suns, Deities, Demons and sages, and also numerous saints and Brahmanas (enlightened people). But they too were caught in the noose of death (Kaal) ([[transmigration of the soul]]). This is similar to the explanation in [[Bhagavad Gita]] which is part of the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.<ref>[https://www.bhagavad-gita.us/bhagavad-gita-11-32/ Bhagavad Gita 11.32]</ref>\n\n===Nepal===\n\nBesides being the site of discovery of the oldest surviving manuscript of the ''Ramayana'', Nepal gave rise to two regional variants in mid 19th \u2013 early 20th century. One, written by [[Bhanubhakta Acharya]], is considered the first epic of [[Nepali language]], while the other, written by [[Siddhidas Mahaju]] in [[Nepal Bhasa]] was a foundational influence in the [[Nepal Bhasa renaissance]].\n\n[[Bhanubhakta Ramayana|Ramayana]] written by [[Bhanubhakta Acharya]] is one of the most popular verses in Nepal. The popularization of the ''Ramayana'' and its tale, originally written in [[Sanskrit Language]] was greatly enhanced by the work of Bhanubhakta. Mainly because of his writing of Nepali Ramayana, Bhanubhakta is also called ''Aadi Kavi'' or ''The Pioneering Poet''.\n\n===Southeast Asian===\n\n====Cambodia====\n\n[[File:Sita Ravana Cambodia.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cambodian classical dancers as Sita and Ravana, the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh (c. 1920s)]]\nThe Cambodian version of the ''Ramayana'', [[Reamker]] ({{lang-km|\u179a\u17b6\u1798\u1780\u17c1\u179a\u17d2\u178a\u17b7\u17cd}} - ''Glory of Ram''), is the most famous story of Khmer literature since the [[Kingdom of Funan]] era.

Since 1969, Pratt has made several contributions to foundational areas such as [[search algorithm]]s, [[sorting algorithm]]s, and [[primality testing]]. More recently, his research has focused on formal modeling of [[concurrency (computer science)|concurrent systems]] and [[Chu space]]s. A pattern of applying models from diverse areas of mathematics such as [[geometry]], [[linear algebra]], [[abstract algebra]], and especially [[mathematical logic]] to computer science pervades his work.\n\n== Career ==\nRaised in Australia and educated at [[Knox Grammar School]], where he was [[Dux#Education|dux]] in 1961, Pratt attended [[Sydney University]], where he completed his masters thesis in 1970, related to what is now known as [[natural language processing]]. He then went to the United States, where he completed a Ph.D. thesis at Stanford University in only 20 months under the supervision of advisor [[Donald Knuth]]. His thesis focused on analysis of the [[Shellsort]] sorting algorithm and [[sorting network]]s.<ref>Vaughan Ronald Pratt: ''Shellsort and Sorting Networks''. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York & London, 1979, {{ISBN|0-8240-4406-1}}</ref>\n\nPratt was an assistant professor at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] (1972 to 1976) and then associate professor (1976 to 1982). In 1974, working in collaboration with Knuth and [[James H. Morris|Morris]], Pratt completed and formalized work he had begun in 1970 as a graduate student at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]; the coauthored result was the [[Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithm|Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt pattern matching algorithm]]. In 1976, he developed the system of [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]], a [[modal logic]] of structured behavior.\n\nHe went on sabbatical from MIT to [[Stanford University|Stanford]] (1980 to 1981), and was appointed a full professor at Stanford in 1981.\n\nPratt directed the [[SUN workstation]] project at Stanford from 1980 to 1982. He contributed in various ways to the founding and early operation of [[Sun Microsystems]], acting in the role of consultant for its first year, then, taking a leave of absence from Stanford for the next two years, becoming director of research, and finally resuming his role as a consultant to Sun and returning to Stanford in 1985.\n\nHe also designed the [[Sun Microsystems]] logo, which features [[:Image:Sun Microsystems logo.svg|four interleaved copies of the word \"sun\"]]; it is an [[ambigram]].\n\nPratt became professor emeritus at Stanford in 2000.\n\n== Major contributions ==\nA number of well-known algorithms bear Pratt's name. [[Pratt certificate]]s, short proofs of the primality of a number, demonstrated in a practical way that primality can be efficiently verified, placing the [[primality test]]ing problem in the complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]] and providing the first strong evidence that the problem is not [[co-NP-complete]].<ref>Vaughan Pratt.

In 1976, he wrote an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] AI Lab working paper about [[CGOL]], an alternative syntax for [[MACLISP]] that he had designed and implemented based on his paradigm for top down operator precedence parsing.<ref>Pratt, V.R., Top Down Operator Precedence.

[[Douglas Crockford]] also used it as the underlying parser for [[JSLint]].<ref>https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint/blob/40e3f73127b56f24a12e5cb091a86d9a24130926/fulljslint.js jslint source code line 2224</ref>  Pratt also implemented a [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]]-based text editor named \"DOC\", which was later renamed to \"ZED\".<ref>Eric Fischer.

Since 1969, Pratt has made several contributions to foundational areas such as [[search algorithm]]s, [[sorting algorithm]]s, and [[primality testing]]. More recently, his research has focused on formal modeling of [[concurrency (computer science)|concurrent systems]] and [[Chu space]]s. A pattern of applying models from diverse areas of mathematics such as [[geometry]], [[linear algebra]], [[abstract algebra]], and especially [[mathematical logic]] to computer science pervades his work.\n\n== Career ==\nRaised in Australia and educated at [[Knox Grammar School]], where he was [[Dux#Education|dux]] in 1961, Pratt attended [[Sydney University]], where he completed his masters thesis in 1970, related to what is now known as [[natural language processing]]. He then went to the United States, where he completed a Ph.D. thesis at Stanford University in only 20 months under the supervision of advisor [[Donald Knuth]]. His thesis focused on analysis of the [[Shellsort]] sorting algorithm and [[sorting network]]s.<ref>Vaughan Ronald Pratt: ''Shellsort and Sorting Networks''. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York & London, 1979, {{ISBN|0-8240-4406-1}}</ref>\n\nPratt was an assistant professor at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] (1972 to 1976) and then associate professor (1976 to 1982). In 1974, working in collaboration with Knuth and [[James H. Morris|Morris]], Pratt completed and formalized work he had begun in 1970 as a graduate student at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]; the coauthored result was the [[Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithm|Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt pattern matching algorithm]]. In 1976, he developed the system of [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]], a [[modal logic]] of structured behavior.\n\nHe went on sabbatical from MIT to [[Stanford University|Stanford]] (1980 to 1981), and was appointed a full professor at Stanford in 1981.\n\nPratt directed the [[SUN workstation]] project at Stanford from 1980 to 1982. He contributed in various ways to the founding and early operation of [[Sun Microsystems]], acting in the role of consultant for its first year, then, taking a leave of absence from Stanford for the next two years, becoming director of research, and finally resuming his role as a consultant to Sun and returning to Stanford in 1985.\n\nHe also designed the [[:Image:Sun Microsystems logo.svg|Sun logo]], which features four interleaved copies of the word \"sun\"; it is an [[ambigram]].\n\nPratt became professor emeritus at Stanford in 2000.\n\n== Major contributions ==\nA number of well-known algorithms bear Pratt's name. [[Pratt certificate]]s, short proofs of the primality of a number, demonstrated in a practical way that primality can be efficiently verified, placing the [[primality test]]ing problem in the complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]] and providing the first strong evidence that the problem is not [[co-NP-complete]].<ref>Vaughan Pratt.

The third installment in the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' franchise]], the game concludes the [[story arc]] begun in 2001's ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' and continued in 2004's ''[[Halo 2]]''. ''Halo 3''{{'}}s story centers on the interstellar war between twenty-sixth century humanity, a collection of alien races known as the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]], and the alien parasite [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]]. The player assumes the role of the [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]], a cybernetically enhanced supersoldier, as he battles the Covenant and the Flood. The game features vehicles, weapons, and gameplay elements not present in previous titles of the series, as well as the addition of saved gameplay films, file sharing, and the Forge map editor\u2014a utility which allows the player to perform modifications to multiplayer levels.\n\nBungie began developing ''Halo 3'' shortly after ''Halo 2'' shipped. The game was officially announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2006, and its release was preceded by a multiplayer beta open to select players who purchased the Xbox 360 game ''[[Crackdown]]''. Microsoft spent $40{{nbsp}}million on marketing the game, in an effort to sell more game consoles and broaden the appeal of the game beyond the established ''Halo'' fanbase. Marketing included cross-promotions and an [[alternate reality game]]. The game was released in September 2007.\n\n''Halo 3'' grossed US$170{{nbsp}}million in its first day of release, and $300{{nbsp}}million its first week. More than one million people played ''Halo 3'' on [[Xbox Live]] in the first twenty hours. To date, ''Halo 3'' has sold in excess of 14.5 million copies. The game was also the [[2007 in video gaming#United States|best-selling video game of 2007 in the U.S.]] Overall, the game was very well received by critics, with the Forge and [[multiplayer]] offerings singled out as strong features; however, some reviewers criticized single-player aspects, especially the plot and campaign layout. ''Halo 3'' is frequently listed [[List of video games considered the best|as one of the greatest video games of all time]]. A prequel to the game, ''[[Halo 3: ODST]]'', was released worldwide in September 2009. A sequel, ''[[Halo 4]]'', released in November 2012, was developed by new studio [[343 Industries]]. ''Halo 3'' was re-released as part of ''[[Halo: The Master Chief Collection]]'' for the [[Xbox One]] in November 2014.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Halo3-gameplay.png|thumb|left|[[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] aims his assault rifle at a group of Covenant Grunts. A piece of activated equipment, called the bubble shield, is shown.]]\n''Halo 3'' is a [[shooter game]] where players primarily experience gameplay from a first-person perspective. Much of the gameplay takes place on foot, but also includes segments focused on [[vehicle|vehicular]] combat. The balance of weapons and objects in the game was adjusted to better adhere to the \"Golden Triangle of ''Halo''\": these are weapons, grenades, and melee attacks, which are available to a player in most situations. Players may [[dual wield|dual-wield]] some weapons, forgoing the use of grenades and melee attacks in favor of the combined firepower of two weapons. Many weapons available in previous installments of the series return with minor cosmetic and power alterations. Unlike previous installments, the player's secondary weapon is visible on their player model, holstered or slung across the player's back.<ref>{{cite journal |date=December 2006 |title=Cover Story: Halo 3 |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |volume=1 |issue=210 |pages=86\u2013103}}</ref>\n\n''Halo 3'' introduces support weapons, which are cumbersome two-handed weapons that slow the player but offer greatly increased firepower in return.<ref name=\"ignburning\">{{cite web |url = http://uk.ign.com/articles/2007/08/10/halo-3-burn-baby-burn |title = Burn, Baby!

One race in the Covenant, the Elites, learn the truth about the rings, and join forces with humanity in order to stop the installation's firing. Though they are successful, the unexpected shutdown triggers a fail-safe protocol, priming all the rings for firing from one location, referred to as the [[Halo Array#Installation 00|Ark]]. Still oblivious to the true nature of the rings, the Covenant High Prophet of Truth and the remaining loyalist Covenant proceed to head to Earth, where they believe the Ark is buried.\n\n''Halo 3''{{'}}s protagonist is Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, an enhanced supersoldier known as a \"[[Spartan-II|Spartan]]\". Master Chief fights alongside the Arbiter, a disgraced Covenant Elite commander.

The Chief and company return to a UNSC outpost where Keyes and [[Characters of Halo#Terrance Hood|Lord Hood]] plan a final effort to stop the Covenant leader, the High Prophet of Truth, from activating a Forerunner artifact the Covenant have excavated. The Chief clears anti-air Covenant defenses so Hood can lead the last of Earth's ships against the Prophet, but Truth activates the buried artifact, creating a [[slipspace]] portal which he and his followers enter. A Flood-infested ship crash-lands nearby; Elite forces arrive and vitrify the Flood-infected areas of Earth, stopping the threat. Following a message Cortana left aboard the Flood ship, the Chief, Arbiter, Elites, Johnson, Keyes and their troops follow Truth through the portal. Joining them is 343 Guilty Spark, who aids the Chief as he has no function to fulfill after the destruction of his ringworld.\n\nTraveling through the portal, the humans and Elites discover an immense artificial structure known as the Ark, far beyond the edges of the Milky Way galaxy. Here, Truth can remotely activate all the Halos. The Flood arrive aboard ''High Charity'' in full force, beginning to infest the installation. Truth captures Johnson, as he needs a human to use Forerunner technology. Keyes is killed attempting a rescue, and Johnson is forced to activate the rings. Gravemind forges a truce with the Chief and Arbiter to stop Truth and defeat the remainder of his army, rescuing Johnson and halting the installations' activation. After the Arbiter kills Truth, Gravemind turns on the Chief and Arbiter.\n\nThe Chief, Arbiter and Guilty Spark discover that the Ark is constructing another Halo to replace the one that the Chief previously destroyed. The Chief decides to activate this Halo; the ringworld would eliminate the Flood infestation on the Ark while sparing the galaxy at large from destruction. To activate the ring, the Chief rescues Cortana, who has the Activation Index of the destroyed Halo, from ''High Charity'' and destroys the city. Arriving on the new Halo, Cortana warns that Gravemind is trying to rebuild itself on the ring. The Chief, Arbiter, and Johnson travel to Halo's control room to activate the ring. Guilty Spark explains that because the ring is not yet complete, a premature activation will destroy it and the Ark. When Johnson ignores his warning, Guilty Spark fatally wounds him to protect \"his\" ring. Although the Chief destroys Guilty Spark, Johnson soon dies of his injuries. Chief activates the ring, and escapes the ring's self-destruction on the UNSC frigate ''Forward Unto Dawn''. However, the force of Halo's blast causes the slipspace portal to collapse, resulting in only the front half of ''Forward Unto Dawn'', carrying the Arbiter, making it back to Earth.\n\nA memorial service is held on Earth for the fallen heroes of the Human-Covenant war, during which the Arbiter and Lord Hood briefly exchange words regarding the fallen Master Chief. After the memorial service, the Arbiter and his Elite brethren depart for their home planet. Meanwhile, the rear half of the ''Forward Unto Dawn'' drifts in unknown space. Cortana drops a distress beacon, but acknowledges it may be many years before they are rescued. As the Master Chief enters [[cryonics|cryonic sleep]], Cortana confides to him that she will miss him, but he comforts her by telling her \"wake me when you need me.\" If the game is completed at the Legendary difficulty level, the scene continues to show the piece of ''Forward Unto Dawn'' drifting towards an unknown planet, setting up the events of ''[[Halo 4]]''.\n\n== Development ==\n''Halo 2'' was a critical and commercial success, but its development had taken a toll on Bungie. The game's development was fraught and rushed, resulting in the final act of the game's campaign being cut.<ref name=\"vice-untoldhistoryhalo\"/> Bungie was openly critical of the game's shortcomings,<ref name=\"1up-does bungie hate halo 2\">{{cite web|author=Smith, Luke|authorlink=Luke Smith (writer)|date=January 26, 2007|url=http://www.1up.com/news/bungie-hates-halo2|title=Does Bungie Hate Halo 2?|website=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=February 9, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019142721/http://www.1up.com/news/bungie-hates-halo2|archivedate=October 19, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and viewed a third ''Halo'' game as a chance to \"make right\" to fans for ''Halo 2''{{'}}s problems, as well as the final ''Halo'' game the studio would make before moving onto other projects.<ref name=\"vice-untoldhistoryhalo\">{{cite web|author=Haske, Steven|date=May 30, 2017|url=https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/xwqjg3/the-complete-untold-history-of-halo-an-oral-history|title=The Complete, Untold History of Halo|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|publisher=Vice Media|url-status=live|accessdate=March 27, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315011247/https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/xwqjg3/the-complete-untold-history-of-halo-an-oral-history|archivedate=March 15, 2018}}</ref> Lingering dissatisfaction with Bungie's acquisition by Microsoft in 2000 and a desire for more favorable profit-sharing on ''Halo 3'' led to an agreement where Bungie would become an independent studio after shipping a set number of new ''Halo'' games.\n\nAfter ''Halo 2'' shipped, Bungie cofounder [[Jason Jones (programmer)|Jason Jones]] went on sabbatical, leaving the ''Halo 3'' team with little direction or leadership; different staff members wrestled over who would take on creative positions for the new game, and no clear creative direction was decided upon. Story writer [[Joseph Staten]] took a vacation after coming into conflict with other staff members, meaning there was no clear person who was responsible for the game's story for a portion of development. The story was drafted by a committee, then presented to senior Bungie members. Composer Martin O'Donnell recalled he did not feel the draft would work, as it left out previous characters and plot threads. Having recently seen the film ''Serenity'', he insisted that characters should die to increase the stakes. Staten returned to do edits after the plot had been established.<ref name=\"vice-untoldhistoryhalo\"/>\n\n''Halo 2'' had popularized online multiplayer matchmaking and social features like player parties and voice chat. The Xbox 360 integrated many similar features into Xbox Live, but changed the underlying system. Designer Max Hoberman recalled that instead of creating new features, he spent a year fixing broken features to get back to parity with ''Halo 2''.<ref name=\"vice-untoldhistoryhalo\"/>\n\nCompared to the harried pace of ''Halo 2''{{'}}s development which necessitated painful cuts to ship the game on time, Bungie staffers recalled ''Halo 3''{{'}}s development as much more smooth, with more time to add features like Forge mode.<ref name=\"vice-untoldhistoryhalo\"/>\n\nBungie remained quiet as to what their new project was, leaving comments in their weekly update alluding to a \"new project\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://halo.bungie.net/news/content.aspx?type=topnews&link=updatemay05 |title=Bungie Weekly Update: 05/05/06 |author=O'Connor, Frank |date=May 5, 2006 |accessdate=August 24, 2011 |publisher=Bungie}}</ref> The game was officially announced with a [[Real-time computing|real-time]] [[Cutscene|cinematic]] [[film trailer|trailer]] at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2006.<ref name=\"announcement\">{{cite web |url = http://halo.bungie.net/news/content.aspx?type=topnews&link=Halo3Announcement |title = Halo 3 Announced |accessdate =August 24, 2011 |author = Achronos, Tom |date = May 9, 2006 |publisher =Bungie}}</ref>\n\nIn comparison with ''Halo 2''{{'}}s tight-lipped development, Bungie was more transparent about the process for ''Halo 3''.<ref name=\"vice-untoldhistoryhalo\">{{cite web|author=Haske, Steven|date=May 30, 2017|url=https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/xwqjg3/the-complete-untold-history-of-halo-an-oral-history|title=The Complete, Untold History of Halo|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|publisher=Vice Media|url-status=live|accessdate=March 27, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315011247/https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/xwqjg3/the-complete-untold-history-of-halo-an-oral-history|archivedate=March 15, 2018}}</ref> Bungie kept the public informed on game development via weekly updates on their web site.

The third installment in the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' franchise]], the game concludes the [[story arc]] begun in 2001's ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' and continued in 2004's ''[[Halo 2]]''. ''Halo 3''{{'}}s story centers on the interstellar war between twenty-sixth century humanity, a collection of alien races known as the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]], and the alien parasite [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]]. The player assumes the role of the [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]], a cybernetically enhanced supersoldier, as he battles the Covenant and the Flood. The game features vehicles, weapons, and gameplay elements not present in previous titles of the series, as well as the addition of saved gameplay films, file sharing, and the Forge map editor\u2014a utility which allows the player to perform modifications to multiplayer levels.\n\nBungie began developing ''Halo 3'' shortly after ''Halo 2'' shipped. The game was officially announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2006, and its release was preceded by a multiplayer beta open to select players who purchased the Xbox 360 game ''[[Crackdown]]''. Microsoft spent $40{{nbsp}}million on marketing the game, in an effort to sell more game consoles and broaden the appeal of the game beyond the established ''Halo'' fanbase. Marketing included cross-promotions and an [[alternate reality game]]. The game was released in September 2007.\n\n''Halo 3'' grossed US$170{{nbsp}}million in its first day of release, and $300{{nbsp}}million its first week. More than one million people played ''Halo 3'' on [[Xbox Live]] in the first twenty hours. To date, ''Halo 3'' has sold in excess of 14.5 million copies. The game was also the [[2007 in video gaming#United States|best-selling video game of 2007 in the U.S.]] Overall, the game was very well received by critics, with the Forge and [[multiplayer]] offerings singled out as strong features; however, some reviewers criticized single-player aspects, especially the plot and campaign layout. ''Halo 3'' is frequently listed [[List of video games considered the best|as one of the greatest video games of all time]]. A prequel to the game, ''[[Halo 3: ODST]]'', was released worldwide in September 2009. A sequel, ''[[Halo 4]]'', released in November 2012, was developed by new studio [[343 Industries]]. ''Halo 3'' was re-released as part of ''[[Halo: The Master Chief Collection]]'' for the [[Xbox One]] in November 2014.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Halo3-gameplay.png|thumb|left|[[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] aims his assault rifle at a group of Covenant Grunts.

Much of the gameplay takes place on foot, but also includes segments focused on [[vehicle|vehicular]] combat. The balance of weapons and objects in the game was adjusted to better adhere to the \"Golden Triangle of ''Halo''\": these are weapons, grenades, and melee attacks, which are available to a player in most situations. Players may [[dual wield|dual-wield]] some weapons, forgoing the use of grenades and melee attacks in favor of the combined firepower of two weapons. Many weapons available in previous installments of the series return with minor cosmetic and power alterations.

Humanity is at war with an genocidal alliance of alien races known as the [[Factions of Halo#Covenant|Covenant]]. After years of conflict, a Covenant fleet discovers Earth during ''[[Halo 2]]''.<ref name=\"manual\">{{cite book | year=2007 | editor=Bungie| title=Halo 3 Instruction Manual | publisher=[[Microsoft Game Studios]]}}</ref> \"[[Halo (megastructure)|Halos]]\" are massive ringworlds, ranging from thousands to tens of thousands of kilometers in diameter, scattered across the galaxy. These rings were constructed thousands of years ago by a race known as the [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunners]] as weapons of last resort against the parasitic alien species known as the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]]. When activated, the Halos would destroy all [[sentience|sentient]] life in the galaxy, depriving the Flood of its food. The Forerunners disappeared after they activated the rings. In ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', whilst fleeing the Covenant, the UNSC ship ''Pillar of Autumn'' stumbled upon one of these ringworlds, [[Halo Array#Installation 04|Installation 04]]. Against the wishes of the ring's artificial intelligence (AI) caretaker, [[Characters of Halo#343 Guilty Spark|343 Guilty Spark]], the human supersoldier [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] destroyed the ring to stop the threat from Halo and the Flood. The Covenant, unaware of the destructive nature of the rings, attempt to fire another ring, [[Halo Array#Installation 05|Installation 05]], during ''Halo 2'' in order to fulfill their religious prophecy. One race in the Covenant, the Elites, learn the truth about the rings, and join forces with humanity in order to stop the installation's firing. Though they are successful, the unexpected shutdown triggers a fail-safe protocol, priming all the rings for firing from one location, referred to as the [[Halo Array#Installation 00|Ark]]. Still oblivious to the true nature of the rings, the Covenant High Prophet of Truth and the remaining loyalist Covenant proceed to head to Earth, where they believe the Ark is buried.\n\n''Halo 3''{{'}}s protagonist is Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, an enhanced supersoldier known as a \"[[Spartan-II|Spartan]]\". Master Chief fights alongside the Arbiter, a disgraced Covenant Elite commander. Two other Elite characters, N'tho 'Sraom and Usze 'Taham, appear as the third and fourth players in cooperative play.<ref name=\"soundofsack\" /> Supporting characters from previous games return, including human soldiers [[Avery J. Johnson|Avery Johnson]] and [[Miranda Keyes]].<ref name=\"manual\" /> Also playing a role in the story is the Flood leader known as the \"[[Gravemind]]\".

The Chief and company return to a UNSC outpost where Keyes and [[Characters of Halo#Terrance Hood|Lord Hood]] plan a final effort to stop the Covenant leader, the High Prophet of Truth, from activating a Forerunner artifact the Covenant have excavated. The Chief clears anti-air Covenant defenses so Hood can lead the last of Earth's ships against the Prophet, but Truth activates the buried artifact, creating a [[slipspace]] portal which he and his followers enter. A Flood-infested ship crash-lands nearby; Elite forces arrive and vitrify the Flood-infected areas of Earth, stopping the threat. Following a message Cortana left aboard the Flood ship, the Chief, Arbiter, Elites, Johnson, Keyes and their troops follow Truth through the portal. Joining them is 343 Guilty Spark, who aids the Chief as he has no function to fulfill after the destruction of his ringworld.\n\nTraveling through the portal, the humans and Elites discover an immense artificial structure known as the Ark, far beyond the edges of the Milky Way galaxy. Here, Truth can remotely activate all the Halos. The Flood arrive aboard ''High Charity'' in full force, beginning to infest the installation. Truth captures Johnson, as he needs a human to use Forerunner technology. Keyes is killed attempting a rescue, and Johnson is forced to activate the rings. Gravemind forges a truce with the Chief and Arbiter to stop Truth and defeat the remainder of his army, rescuing Johnson and halting the installations' activation. After the Arbiter kills Truth, Gravemind turns on the Chief and Arbiter.\n\nThe Chief, Arbiter and Guilty Spark discover that the Ark is constructing another Halo to replace the one that the Chief previously destroyed. The Chief decides to activate this Halo; the ringworld would eliminate the Flood infestation on the Ark while sparing the galaxy at large from destruction. To activate the ring, the Chief rescues Cortana, who has the Activation Index of the destroyed Halo, from ''High Charity'' and destroys the city. Arriving on the new Halo, Cortana warns that Gravemind is trying to rebuild itself on the ring. The Chief, Arbiter, and Johnson travel to Halo's control room to activate the ring. Guilty Spark explains that because the ring is not yet complete, a premature activation will destroy it and the Ark. When Johnson ignores his warning, Guilty Spark fatally wounds him to protect \"his\" ring. Although the Chief destroys Guilty Spark, Johnson soon dies of his injuries. Chief activates the ring, and escapes the ring's self-destruction on the UNSC frigate ''Forward Unto Dawn''. However, the force of Halo's blast causes the slipspace portal to collapse, resulting in only the front half of ''Forward Unto Dawn'', carrying the Arbiter, making it back to Earth.\n\nA memorial service is held on Earth for the fallen heroes of the Human-Covenant war, during which the Arbiter and Lord Hood briefly exchange words regarding the fallen Master Chief. After the memorial service, the Arbiter and his Elite brethren depart for their home planet. Meanwhile, the rear half of the ''Forward Unto Dawn'' drifts in unknown space. Cortana drops a distress beacon, but acknowledges it may be many years before they are rescued. As the Master Chief enters [[cryonics|cryonic sleep]], Cortana confides to him that she will miss him, but he comforts her by telling her \"wake me when you need me.\" If the game is completed at the Legendary difficulty level, the scene continues to show the piece of ''Forward Unto Dawn'' drifting towards an unknown planet, setting up the events of ''[[Halo 4]]''.\n\n== Development ==\n''Halo 2'' was a critical and commercial success, but its development had taken a toll on Bungie.

Story writer [[Joseph Staten]] took a vacation after coming into conflict with other staff members, meaning there was no clear person who was responsible for the game's story for a portion of development. The story was drafted by a committee, then presented to senior Bungie members. Composer Martin O'Donnell recalled he did not feel the draft would work, as it left out previous characters and plot threads. Having recently seen the film ''Serenity'', he insisted that characters should die to increase the stakes. Staten returned to do edits after the plot had been established.<ref name=\"vice-untoldhistoryhalo\"/>\n\n''Halo 2'' had popularized online multiplayer matchmaking and social features like player parties and voice chat. The Xbox 360 integrated many similar features into Xbox Live, but changed the underlying system.

{"title_page": "Damsel of Cyprus", "text_new": "The '''Damsel of Cyprus''' (born c. 1177), possibly named '''Beatrice''' or '''Maria''',{{sfn|Parks|2010|pp=286\u2013289}} was the daughter of [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]], emperor of [[Byzantine Cyprus|Cyprus]], and an [[Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian]] princess. She was her father's sole heiress. Her given name is not known with certainty and she is known by convention as the \"Damsel of Cyprus\".\n\nShe was a hostage in the [[Principality of Antioch]] from 1182 until at least 1184. She was captured in 1191 during a brief war between her father and King [[Richard I of England]]. She remained an English prisoner, although treated well, until 1194. During her captivity she travelled throughout the Holy Land, Italy and France. After her release, she remained in France. In 1199 or 1200, she married Count [[Raymond VI of Toulouse]], becoming his fourth wife. They divorced by late 1202 or early 1203, when she married [[Thierry of Flanders (flourished 1197\u20131207)|Thierry of Flanders]], who attempted to claim Cyprus on her behalf. After this failed venture, the couple went to Armenia. Her fate thereafter is unknown.\n\n==Name==\nThe Damsel of Cyprus is specified in contemporary chronicles and documents as \"Isaac's daughter\" (''filia Isaaci''){{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=157}} or the \"daughter of the emperor [of Cyprus]\" (''filia imperatoris [Cypri]'',{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=158}} ''fille de l'Empereor de Chypre'').{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=171}} The chronicles that record her second marriage do not name her husband, either, although his identity can be deduced from the information given.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\nWipertus Rudt de Collenberg suggests that Isaac's daughter may be the ''domicella'' (damsel) Beatrice who is listed first among the female beneficiaries of the will of [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan of England]], queen of Sicily and third wife of Raymond of Toulouse, in 1199. She received the large sum of 200 [[Mark (currency)|marks]], while the other ladies received 140 marks (Alice), 100 (Helysabeth), 60 (Philippa) and 15 (Malekakxa). She and Alice also inherited two coffers at Verdun and their contents. The title ''domicella'' (diminutive of lady) implies an unmarried girl of noble birth. The name Beatrice would have been appropriate for Isaac's daughter, since both of her maternal great-grandparents bore the name, [[Beatrice of Saone]] and the daughter of Count [[Hugh I, Count of Rethel|Hugh of Rethel]], as well as her great-great-grandmother, the daughter of [[Constantine I, Prince of Armenia|Constantine I of Armenia]].{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=174\u2013175}}\n\nGeorge Jeffery calls her Maria, without explanation. Annette Parks uses Beatrice, provisionally.{{sfn|Parks|2010|pp=286\u2013289}}\n\n==Childhood==\nThe Damsel was born probably in 1177 or 1178. She had a brother, name also unknown. Her parents were probably married in 1175 or 1176.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|loc=Tableaux g\u00e9n\u00e9alogiques I and II}} Her father, who was born between 1155 and 1160, had recently been appointed governor of [[Cilicia]] (between 1173 and 1175). Her mother, whose name is also unknown, was the daughter of Prince [[Thoros II of Armenia]] and Isabella, daughter of Count [[Joscelin II of Edessa]]. The Damsel was thus related to the ruling families of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] and Armenia as well as one of the leading families of crusader [[Outremer]].{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=130}}\n\nAfter fighting broke out between Byzantium and Armenia, Isaac was captured.

He gave his children as hostages to Bohemond in order to obtain his release to raise his ransom. When the final payment of 30,000 [[bezant]]s was stolen by pirates, he refused to re-raise it and the Damsel and her brother thus remained hostages at the court of the prince of Antioch for another two years, when they were released for reasons of state.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=133\u2013134}} This was probably around 1184,{{sfn|Parks|2010|pp=286\u2013289}} but [[Roger of Howden]] places it around the time of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|fall of Jerusalem]] in 1187.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=133\u2013134}}\n\nThe death of her brother between 1187 and 1191, left the Damsel the sole heir of her father.

He threatened [[Berengaria of Navarre|Berengaria]], the fianc\u00e9e of King [[Richard I of England]], and Richard promptly landed troops and took [[Limassol]] while Isaac retreated after some skirmishes. On 16 May, the two met and Richard demanded that Isaac pay an indemnity, put a mixed force of cavalry and infantry at his disposal and hand over his daughter and his new wife as hostages. In return, Richard would [[enfeoff]] him with Cyprus. Isaac refused these terms and retreated north. On 21 May, Richard attacked the [[Kyrenia Castle|castle of Kyrenia]], having learned that Isaac's daughter was there. The Damsel, who was only about fourteen years old, came out of the castle, fell at Richard's feet \"out of fear\" and surrendered both herself and the fortress. Richard took her hand and helped her to her feet.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=148\u2013151}}\n\nAccording to the ''[[Itinerarium Regis Ricardi|Itinerarium regis Ricardi]]'', on learning of his daughter's capture Isaac despaired \"because he loved her dearly\".{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=148\u2013151}} Roger of Howden is even stronger, writing \"he loved [her] more than any other creature\".{{sfn|Parks|2010|pp=286\u2013289}} He surrendered on 22 May.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=148\u2013151}} There is no basis for the claim by [[H.

The ''[[Chronica anonymi Laudunensis canonici]]'' also describes her as handsome (''speciosa''). [[Ralph de Diceto]] even thought it necessary to condemn those who accused Richard of an attraction to his captive. According to the ''Itinerarium'', Richard had her put \"in custody, lest she be carried off\" (''in custodiam ne forte raperetur''), which implies physical confinement.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=156}} The ''[[Ernoul|Chronique d'Ernoul]]'' and the ''[[Eracles|Histoire d'Eracles]]'' claim that she was imprisoned in [[Margat]] with her father, but Ralph says that she was \"retained in honorable custody in the royal chamber with the two queens\"<!-- (''cum duabus reginis in thalamo regis honorifice custodiam retinuit'')-->, Richard's queen, Berengaria, and his sister Joan, dowager queen of Sicily.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=157}} The poet [[Ambroise]], commenting on her capture, also says she was sent to the queen not for safekeeping but for her education:\n<poem>\n:And his young daughter a most fair\n:And lovely maid of beauty rare\n:Had sent her to the queen that she\n:Might well be taught and fittingly.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=156}}\n</poem>\nThe chronicles of the Third Crusade note the continued presence of \"Isaac's daughter\" with the two queens. The three spent Christmas 1191 at [[Toron]] and afterwards visited [[Jerusalem]]. They embarked to return to Europe on 29 September 1192. They went first to Sicily, where the second wife of Isaac had also returned. There they learned that Richard had been imprisoned by Duke [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria|Leopold V of Austria]]. Escorted by [[Stephen de Turnham]], they went on to Rome, where they were present on 9 April 1193.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=157}}\n\nRoger of Howden records that Pope [[Celestine III]] honorably received the emperor of Cyprus's daughter. They remained in Rome until June. They left under the escort of Cardnial [[Melior (cardinal)|Melior]] and went by way of [[Pisa]] and [[Genoa]] to [[Marseille]], where they were met by King [[Alfonso II of Aragon]], whose brother [[Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Provence|Raymond Berengar]] was the count of Provence. Alfonso escorted them through Provence to the [[County of Toulouse]], where they were escorted by Raymond of Saint-Gilles, the future Count [[Raymond VI of Toulouse|Raymond VI]], who would later marry both Joan and the Damsel. They arrived in [[Poitiers]] in Richard's [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] towards the end of 1193.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=158}}\n\n==Release==\nOn 14 February 1193 at [[W\u00fcrzburg]], Leopold of Austria signed a treaty with [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]]. By its terms, Leopold would hand Richard over to Henry, who would hold him prisoner until Isaac and his daughter were released. Leopold and Isaac were second cousins. On 28 March, Richard was handed over and the treaty came into force. On 26 June, Richard signed an agreement with Henry that incorporated the treaty of W\u00fcrzburg in its entirety. The Damsel was to be handed over to Leopold as guardian at the same time as Richard's niece, [[Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany|Eleanor of Brittany]], who was betrothed to Leopold's son [[Frederick I, Duke of Austria (Babenberg)|Frederick]]. The negotiations also envisioned the future marriage of the Damsel to Frederick's younger brother, [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria|Leopold VI]], her third cousin. Richard was released on 2 February 1194, presumably a date corresponding in some way to the liberation of Isaac.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=159\u2013162}}\n\nIn 1194, the Damsel was joined by Eleanor of Brittany at the court of Berengaria and Joan, which travelled between [[Chinon]] and [[Rouen]]. An entry in the [[pipe rolls]] of the [[Exchequer of Normandy]] for 11 September 1194 records a payment of 168 pounds and 12 shillings to \"the daughter of the Count of Brittany and the daughter of the Emperor of Cyprus and their [joint] household\".

When the latter learned of the death of Leopold on 31 December, he turned the party around on his own initiative and returned to Normandy. The duke's sons had no interest in pursuing the marriages their father had envisioned for them and they died with him. The party arrived back in Normandy in the spring of 1196.

She died on 24 September 1199, having spent the last part of her marriage in northern France. The ''Histoire d'Eracles'' seems to suppose that the Damsel remained a prisoner down to 1199, which perception may be owed to her continued residence with Joan. After the death of Joan, she became Raymond's fourth wife, probably in 1199 or 1200. The editorial remark in the ''[[Recueil des historiens des croisades]]'' that she was a mere concubine is without foundation. The marriage is recorded in the ''Eracles'' and by [[Pierre de Vaux-Cernay]], who mistakenly dates it to 1193\u20131196.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=166\u2013167}} The marriage was over by 1203 (probably by October 1202<!--when Raymond was in the Holy Land?-->) and Raymond married a fifth time in January 1204.

She was her father's sole heiress. Her given name is not known with certainty and she is known by convention as the \"Damsel of Cyprus\".\n\nShe was a hostage in the [[Principality of Antioch]] from 1182 until at least 1184. She was captured in 1191 during a brief war between her father and King [[Richard I of England]]. She remained an English prisoner, although treated well, until 1194. During her captivity she travelled throughout the Holy Land, Italy and France. After her release, she remained in France. In 1199 or 1200, she married Count [[Raymond VI of Toulouse]], becoming his fourth wife. They divorced by late 1202 or early 1203, when she married [[Thierry of Flanders (flourished 1197\u20131207)|Thierry of Flanders]], who attempted to claim Cyprus on her behalf.

She received the large sum of 200 [[Mark (currency)|marks]], while the other ladies received 140 marks (Alice), 100 (Helysabeth), 60 (Philippa) and 15 (Malekakxa). She and Alice also inherited two coffers at Verdun and their contents. The title ''domicella'' (diminutive of lady) implies an unmarried girl of noble birth. The name Beatrice would have been appropriate for Isaac's daughter, since both of her maternal great-grandparents bore the name, [[Beatrice of Saone]] and the daughter of Count [[Hugh I, Count of Rethel|Hugh of Rethel]], as well as her great-great-grandmother, the daughter of [[Constantine I, Prince of Armenia|Constantine I of Armenia]].{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=174\u2013175}}\n\nGeorge Jeffery calls her Maria, without explanation.

Traditional [[Han Chinese|Han]] customs have spread throughout [[East Asian cultural sphere|East Asia]] to varying degrees, with some regions sharing a few aspects of formal dining, which has ranged from guest seating to paying the bill.\n\n==Table and place settings==\n[[File:HK Sai Ying Pun \u540d\u661f\u6d77\u9bae\u9152\u5bb6 Star Seafood Restaurant round table March-2012 Ip4.jpg|thumb|right|Typical place settings before a meal is served]]\nIn most traditional Chinese dining, dishes are shared [[Communal bowl|communally]]. Although both square and rectangular tables are used for small groups of people, round tables are preferred for large groups, particularly in restaurants, in order to permit easy sharing. [[Lazy Susan]] turntables are a common feature at the center of larger tables, to facilitate passing of serving dishes. \n\nA basic [[place setting]] consists of a small teacup; a large plate with a small, empty rice bowl; a set of chopsticks, usually on the right of the plate; and a soup spoon. Additions may include a chopstick rest or holder, a large water or wine glass, and a smaller glass for ''[[baijiu]]''. Occasionally a small shallow dish is left for each diner, to hold a small amount of a condiment or sauce.\n\nAt homes and low-end restaurants, napkins may consist of [[Tissue paper|paper tissues]] or occasionally must be provided by the diner. High restaurants often provide cloth napkins similar to Western dining as part of the place settings.\n\nUnlike some Western restaurants, powdered salt, pepper, or sugar are rarely provided at the table. Sometimes bottles of soy sauce, vinegar, hot sauce, or other condiments are available.[[Black vinegar]] is popular in the north of China as a dipping sauce, particularly for dumplings.<ref>{{Citation|title=Black vinegar|date=2020-04-14|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_vinegar&oldid=950867267|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Formal seating order ===\nThere is a specific [[Seating plan|seating order]] to every [[formal dinner]], based on seniority and organizational hierarchy. The [[seat of honor]], reserved for the host or the oldest person, is usually the position in the center facing east or facing the entrance to the room. Guests with higher status then sit in close proximity to the seat of honor, while those with lower positions sit further away. The least pretigious seat is generally the one nearest to the kitchen entrance or service door.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internations.org/hong-kong-expats/guide/15908-culture-shopping-recreation/dining-in-hong-kong-etiquette-15914|title=Dining in Hong Kong: Etiquette|website=www.internations.org}}</ref>\n\n==Sequencing of a meal==\nWide variations exist throughout China, but the vast majority of full-course dinners are very similar in terms of timing and dishes.\n\n===Beverages===\n[[File:Chinese teapot.JPG|thumb|right|An 18th century Chinese porcelain hand painted blue and white teapot]]\nHot tea is almost always provided, either in advance of the diners being seated or immediately afterward. It can be consumed at leisure throughout the meal. Hot or cold water is sometimes served, but tea is the default beverage. A verbal \"thank you\" ({{zh|s=\u8c22\u8c22|p=xiexie|labels=no}}) may be offered to the server pouring a refill or, if in the middle of a conversation where it would be rude to interrupt the speaker, the table may be [[Chinese tea culture#Finger tapping|tapped twice with two bent fingers]] instead.\n\n===Appetizers===\nAppetizers are the first items presented. Two or more small dishes are brought to the table, holding boiled unsalted peanuts, salted roasted peanuts, crispy fried noodles, or similar dishes. These may be consumed while ordering the main courses, or while waiting for other dishes to arrive.\n\n===Soup===\nA hot soup may be served as one of the dishes, usually near the beginning of the meal. For small meals, especially at home, it may replace the diners' beverage entirely.\n\n===Main courses===\n{{see also|Dim sum}}\nUnlike Western-style meals, there are usually multiple main dishes which are sampled by all the diners; usually there is one communally-shared dish ordered per person seated at a table. A celebratory event such as a graduation or wedding often features over ten dishes, often an odd number for good luck.\n \nWhite steamed rice is provided in small bowls and food is often placed over it, flavoring it with their sauces. The rice is consumed little by little along with the other dishes and not separately, unless the diner remains hungry after the last dish has been removed.\n\n===Final course===\nNear the end of the meal, a starchy, filling dish such as noodles, [[jiaozi|Chinese dumplings]], or ''[[baozi]]'' is sometimes served, to ensure that guests are fully satiated. In extremely formal settings, only a small amount of this final dish is taken by the diners, to avoid implying that the host was not sufficiently generous in planning the meal.\n\n===Dessert===\nInformal meals may not have a dessert course at all, or offer sweet foods that are particular favorites of the diners. Fresh fruit (often slices of citrus) or fresh or canned pineapple are often offered in restaurants.\n\nOther common desserts are [[tapioca]] or [[rice pudding]], or a hot or cold soup flavored with [[red bean soup|sweet red beans]]. Ice cream may be offered, often flavored with [[ginger]], [[Red bean ice|sweet red beans]], or a delicate tea.\n\n[[Fortune cookie]]s are rarely offered by authentic Chinese restaurants, even in North America where they were invented. They are considered a lightweight amusement, suitable for informal gatherings of close friends and family. Fancier restaurants may offer mints or occasionally chocolates as breath fresheners.\n\n==Manners and customs ==\nEating is a dominant aspect of [[Chinese culture]], and eating out is one of the most common ways to honor guests, socialize, and deepen friendships.<ref name=\"Dob\">Dobsons, Richard.

Although many [[Mao Zedong|Maoist]] programs tried to curtail traditional social practices, today table etiquette is again taken as an indication of educational status and good upbringing. For example, a child misusing their chopsticks at a formal dinner might embarrass their family, who are responsible for teaching the child.<ref name=\"Dob\"/><ref name=\"Cha\"/>\n\n===Personal behavior===\n{{See also|Eating utensil etiquette}}\nSince [[chopsticks]] (and [[spoon]]s) are used in place of [[fork]]s and [[knives]], [[Chinese cuisine]] tends to serve dishes in bite-size pieces or employ cooking techniques that render dishes such as fish or ''[[hong shao rou]]'' soft enough to be picked apart easily.<ref name=\"Inn\">Inness, Sherrie. \"Home Cooking .\" Kitchen Culture in America: Popular Representations of Food, Gender, and Race (2001): 14.

One should not spear food with chopsticks although people sometimes do it if the food is too slippery. Chopsticks are not to be used to point at people, pick teeth, bang the bowls, move the bowls, nor to be chewed on or waved around. They should be held so that the ends are even, and never separated in any way (such as holding one in each hand). \n\nWhen not in use, chopsticks should be left on chopstick rests when provided, or placed across the bowl or plate. They should never be left sticking upright out of food, evoking images of incense or \"joss\" sticks used ceremoniously at funerals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture-4-travel.com/chopstick-etiquette.html|title=Chinese Chopstick Etiquette|work=Culture-4-Travel.com}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, a diner is supposed to hold the chopsticks in the right hand and with the left hand either hold down the bowl on the table or pick it up so that it is near the mouth, or at least put the left hand on the table; eating with the chopsticks in the left hand or steadily with only one hand on the table is perceived as unproper table manners.{{Why?|reason=Why is this perceived as rude behaviour? The fact that this way to handle food is traditionally claimed and perceived to be rude does not mean the perception is correct. There is no concrete evidence that this perception is correct, and that both hands should be used when eating is in fact no rule or law; perception is a more correct word.|date=February 2020}}{{Fix|text=reliable source??}}{{dubious|date=January 2020}} However, that perception has started to fade away in modern time.{{when?|date=March 2020}}{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} It is, however, never considered rude to lift a rice bowl with one hand to scoop rice into the mouth using chopsticks in the other hand.\n\nCondiments, such as [[soy sauce]], [[duck sauce]], or [[sesame oil]], are sometimes served in small shallow dishes to allow pieces of food to be dipped as desired. They may not be routinely provided at high-quality restaurants; the assumption is that perfectly-prepared food needs no condiments, and the quality of the food can be best appreciated as prepared by the master chef.\n\nIt is considered virtuous for diners to not leave any bit of wasted food on their plates or bowls. If significant amounts of untouched food are left over in the serving dishes after a meal, it is often considered a compliment to the chef to request that it be packaged for takeout, to be enjoyed later at home.\n\n===Inviting guests===\nAlthough individual households may have their own house rules, the Chinese traditions used to welcome guests are largely the same throughout the country.<ref name=\"Mor\">Morse, Edward.

Accessed 21 Jan 2010.</ref>\n\nCommunal eating is very common in China, encompassing informal meals among close friends and family, as well as more formal meals and banquets to celebrate special occasions. In addition to providing opportunities for socializing, shared meals allow the diners to sample a wider range of dishes than if they were ordering individually.\n\n===Communal eating===\n[[File:Spoon and chopsticks.jpg|thumb|upright|Serving chopsticks (''gongkuai'') on the far right, personal chopsticks (''putongkuai'' or ''sikuai'') in the middle, and a spoon. Serving chopsticks are usually more ornate and longer than the personal ones.]]\nThere appears to be no Chinese word for communal eating and using one's personal chopsticks in the serving dish. However, at some formal meals, there may be pairs of communal serving chopsticks ({{lang|zh|\u516c\u7b77}}, ''gongkuai''). These are sets of chopsticks specifically for shared dishes only. Often, these will be distinct from the ''putongkuai'' ({{lang|zh|\u666e\u901a\u7b77}}, regular chopsticks) or ''sikuai'' ({{lang|zh|\u79c1\u7b77}}, personal chopsticks) in that they will be longer and more ornate. There will sometimes be one set of communal chopsticks per dish or one set per course. The ratio varies.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jt6u8RZw51cC&pg=PA109&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false 9][https://books.google.com/books?id=0TV8ebayzNUC&pg=PA26&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false 10][https://books.google.com/books?id=npxUXbUg6uUC&pg=PA164&dq=chopstick+manners&hl=en#v=onepage&q=chopsticks&f=false 11]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=32uyAAAAIAAJ&q=chopstick+etiquette&dq=chopstick+etiquette&hl=en 12]</ref> If there are no ''gongkuai'' set on the table, it is never rude to request that they be provided; others will just think that you are a stickler for formality and good manners.\n\nIt is also considered extremely rude to dig for a choice food morsel on the serving plate instead of picking up the piece that is closest to the diner, thus demonstrating fairness and sharing with others. The shunned practice is sometimes called \"digging one's grave\". Likewise, it is impolite to hoard or take most of a dish until it has been offered to everyone and the other diners have had a chance to sample it. For this reason, it is common to take a smaller amount from the dishes on the first round, and to keep the other diners in mind when taking a larger second helping.\n\nThe last piece of food on a communal dish is never served to oneself without asking for permission. When offered the last bit of food, it may sometimes be considered rude to refuse the offer.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}{{dubious|date=February 2020}} \n\n===Lazy Susan (turntable)===\n[[File:Lazy Susan.jpg|thumb|A Lazy Susan in use]]\nA [[Lazy Susan]] turntable is a large circular rotating platform placed at the center of a table, and used to easily share a large number of dishes among the diners. A Lazy Susan can be made from many materials, but most often they are constructed of glass, wood, or plastic.\n\nIt is typical for all the dishes for each course to be brought out together and placed around the perimeter of the Lazy Susan. It the turntable is large, a decorative centerpiece may occupy the center, since any food placed there would be out of reach of a seated diner. Alternatively, shared table condiments such as soy sauce, hot sauce, vinegar, or sesame oil may be located at the center.\n\nIf the dishes come out one at a time or if there is some special delicacy, they are typically served to the guest of honor first and then rotated clockwise around the table. The host will often wait to serve himself last. Dishes should typically not be removed from the Lazy Susan and placed on the table: at most, one should hold the dish aloft while serving and then return it to its place on the tray. One should try to avoid moving the Lazy Susan even slightly when someone is in the act of transferring food from the dishes to their plate or bowl. \n\n===Alcohol===\nWater and other non-alcoholic beverages may be consumed at any time. However, in formal settings, alcohol should only be consumed during [[toast (honor)|toasts]]. A modest toast may be followed by a single sip of wine or swallow of beer, but a ''baijiu'' toast is often ended with ''Ganbei!'' ({{lang|zh|\u5e72\u676f}}), an exhortation to drain the glass. Ideally, glasses are refilled immediately following a toast in preparation for the next.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn informal settings, individuals may order their preferred drinks. Carbonated beverages or beer are often ordered, although many diners may be satisfied with tea or hot water.\n\n==Bill (check)==\nThe bill for the meal (often call the \"check\") is presented at the end of the meal, after all the food and drinks have been served. In most restaurants in Chinese countries, there is no [[gratuity|tip]] expected unless it is explicitly posted. Usually if there is a tip required, it will already be added to the bill. However, in Chinese restaurants in North America tips are usually expected, as is customary in other restaurants of the region.\n\nIt is a common sight for families to dispute over who pays the bill, as the person paying thereby demonstrates generosity, sincerity, and dominance. If somebody organizes a meal and invites the guests, that person is usually accorded the honor of paying for the event.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Customs and etiquette in Japanese dining]]\n*[[Chinese culture|Culture of China]]\n*[[Chinese cuisine]]\n*[[Etiquette in Asia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n<!--\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jt6u8RZw51cC&pg=PA109&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false Ref. 8]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jt6u8RZw51cC&pg=PA109&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false Ref. 9]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=0TV8ebayzNUC&pg=PA26&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false Ref. 10]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=npxUXbUg6uUC&pg=PA164&dq=chopstick+manners&hl=en#v=onepage&q=chopsticks&f=false Ref. 11 page 164]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=32uyAAAAIAAJ&q=chopstick+etiquette&dq=chopstick+etiquette&hl=en Ref. 12 page 69-71]\n-->\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/business/global/28iht-busnav28.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss In China, Social Evenings Are Considered Part of the Business Routine]\n* [https://ac.els-cdn.com/S2352618115000657/1-s2.0-S2352618115000657-main.pdf?_tid=698dab50-0114-4938-a7f6-58bddca2b29a&acdnat=1528346775_0fcf187161655a2b6fe6aeb18defa85f Food, eating behavior, and culture in Chinese society]\n* [http://confuciusmag.com/chinese-dining-etiquette Chinese dining etiquette]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chinese Table Manner}}\n[[Category:Etiquette by region|Chinese dining]]\n[[Category:Dining etiquette]]\n[[Category:Chinese cuisine]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=May 2013}}\n{{howto|date=April 2013}}\n}}\n\n{{Cuisine of China}}\n\n'''Customs and etiquette in Chinese dining''' are the traditional behaviors observed while eating in [[Greater China]].

One should not spear food with chopsticks although people sometimes do it if the food is too slippery. Chopsticks are not to be used to point at people, pick teeth, bang the bowls, move the bowls, nor to be chewed on or waved around. They should be held so that the ends are even, and never separated in any way (such as holding one in each hand). \n\nWhen not in use, chopsticks should be left on chopstick rests when provided, or placed across the bowl or plate. They should never be left sticking upright out of food, evoking images of incense or \"joss\" sticks used ceremoniously at funerals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture-4-travel.com/chopstick-etiquette.html|title=Chinese Chopstick Etiquette|work=Culture-4-Travel.com}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, a diner is supposed to hold the chopsticks in the right hand and with the left hand either hold down the bowl on the table or pick it up so that it is near the mouth, or at least put the left hand on the table; eating with the chopsticks in the left hand or steadily with only one hand on the table is perceived as unproper table manners.{{Why?|reason=Why is this perceived as rude behaviour? The fact that this way to handle food is traditionally claimed and perceived to be rude does not mean the perception is correct. There is no concrete evidence that this perception is correct, and that both hands should be used when eating is in fact no rule or law; perception is a more correct word.|date=February 2020}}{{Fix|text=reliable source??}}{{dubious|date=January 2020}} However, that perception has started to fade away in modern time.{{when?|date=March 2020}}{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} It is, however, never considered rude to lift a rice bowl with one hand to scoop rice into the mouth using chopsticks in the other hand.\n\nCondiments, such as [[soy sauce]], [[duck sauce]], or [[sesame oil]], are sometimes served in small shallow dishes to allow pieces of food to be dipped as desired. They may not be routinely provided at high-quality restaurants; the assumption is that perfectly-prepared food needs no condiments, and the quality of the food can be best appreciated as prepared by the master chef.\n\nIt is considered virtuous for diners to not leave any bit of wasted food on their plates or bowls. If significant amounts of untouched food are left over in the serving dishes after a meal, it is often considered a compliment to the chef to request that it be packaged for takeout, to be enjoyed later at home.\n\n===Inviting guests===\nAlthough individual households may have their own house rules, the Chinese traditions used to welcome guests are largely the same throughout the country.<ref name=\"Mor\">Morse, Edward.

In addition to providing opportunities for socializing, shared meals allow the diners to sample a wider range of dishes than if they were ordering individually.\n\n===Communal eating===\n[[File:Spoon and chopsticks.jpg|thumb|upright|Serving chopsticks (''gongkuai'') on the far right, personal chopsticks (''putongkuai'' or ''sikuai'') in the middle, and a spoon. Serving chopsticks are usually more ornate and longer than the personal ones.]]\nThere appears to be no Chinese word for communal eating and using one's personal chopsticks in the serving dish. However, at some formal meals, there may be pairs of communal serving chopsticks ({{lang|zh|\u516c\u7b77}}, ''gongkuai''). These are sets of chopsticks specifically for shared dishes only. Often, these will be distinct from the ''putongkuai'' ({{lang|zh|\u666e\u901a\u7b77}}, regular chopsticks) or ''sikuai'' ({{lang|zh|\u79c1\u7b77}}, personal chopsticks) in that they will be longer and more ornate. There will sometimes be one set of communal chopsticks per dish or one set per course. The ratio varies.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jt6u8RZw51cC&pg=PA109&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false 9][https://books.google.com/books?id=0TV8ebayzNUC&pg=PA26&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false 10][https://books.google.com/books?id=npxUXbUg6uUC&pg=PA164&dq=chopstick+manners&hl=en#v=onepage&q=chopsticks&f=false 11]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=32uyAAAAIAAJ&q=chopstick+etiquette&dq=chopstick+etiquette&hl=en 12]</ref> If there are no ''gongkuai'' set on the table, it is never rude to request that they be provided; others will just think that you are a stickler for formality and good manners.\n\nIt is also considered extremely rude to dig for a choice food morsel on the serving plate instead of picking up the piece that is closest to the diner, thus demonstrating fairness and sharing with others. The shunned practice is sometimes called \"digging one's grave\". Likewise, it is impolite to hoard or take most of a dish until it has been offered to everyone and the other diners have had a chance to sample it. For this reason, it is common to take a smaller amount from the dishes on the first round, and to keep the other diners in mind when taking a larger second helping.\n\nThe last piece of food on a communal dish is never served to oneself without asking for permission. When offered the last bit of food, it may sometimes be considered rude to refuse the offer.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}{{dubious|date=February 2020}} \n\n===Lazy Susan (turntable)===\n[[File:Lazy Susan.jpg|thumb|A Lazy Susan in use]]\nA [[Lazy Susan]] turntable is a large circular rotating platform placed at the center of a table, and used to easily share a large number of dishes among the diners. A Lazy Susan can be made from many materials, but most often they are constructed of glass, wood, or plastic.\n\nIt is typical for all the dishes for each course to be brought out together and placed around the perimeter of the Lazy Susan. It the turntable is large, a decorative centerpiece may occupy the center, since any food placed there would be out of reach of a seated diner. Alternatively, shared table condiments such as soy sauce, hot sauce, vinegar, or sesame oil may be located at the center.\n\nIf the dishes come out one at a time or if there is some special delicacy, they are typically served to the guest of honor first and then rotated clockwise around the table. The host will often wait to serve himself last. Dishes should typically not be removed from the Lazy Susan and placed on the table: at most, one should hold the dish aloft while serving and then return it to its place on the tray. One should try to avoid moving the Lazy Susan even slightly when someone is in the act of transferring food from the dishes to their plate or bowl. \n\n===Alcohol===\nWater and other non-alcoholic beverages may be consumed at any time. However, in formal settings, alcohol should only be consumed during [[toast (honor)|toasts]]. A modest toast may be followed by a single sip of wine or swallow of beer, but a ''baijiu'' toast is often ended with ''Ganbei!'' ({{lang|zh|\u5e72\u676f}}), an exhortation to drain the glass. Ideally, glasses are refilled immediately following a toast in preparation for the next.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn informal settings, individuals may order their preferred drinks. Carbonated beverages or beer are often ordered, although many diners may be satisfied with tea or hot water.\n\n==Bill (check)==\nThe bill for the meal (often call the \"check\") is presented at the end of the meal, after all the food and drinks have been served. In most restaurants in Chinese countries, there is no [[gratuity|tip]] expected unless it is explicitly posted. Usually if there is a tip required, it will already be added to the bill. However, in Chinese restaurants in North America tips are usually expected, as is customary in other restaurants of the region.\n\nIt is a common sight for families to dispute over who pays the bill, as the person paying thereby demonstrates generosity, sincerity, and dominance. If somebody organizes a meal and invites the guests, that person is usually accorded the honor of paying for the event.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Customs and etiquette in Japanese dining]]\n*[[Chinese culture|Culture of China]]\n*[[Chinese cuisine]]\n*[[Etiquette in Asia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n<!--\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jt6u8RZw51cC&pg=PA109&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false Ref. 8]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jt6u8RZw51cC&pg=PA109&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false Ref. 9]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=0TV8ebayzNUC&pg=PA26&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false Ref. 10]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=npxUXbUg6uUC&pg=PA164&dq=chopstick+manners&hl=en#v=onepage&q=chopsticks&f=false Ref. 11 page 164]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=32uyAAAAIAAJ&q=chopstick+etiquette&dq=chopstick+etiquette&hl=en Ref. 12 page 69-71]\n-->\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/business/global/28iht-busnav28.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss In China, Social Evenings Are Considered Part of the Business Routine]\n* [https://ac.els-cdn.com/S2352618115000657/1-s2.0-S2352618115000657-main.pdf?_tid=698dab50-0114-4938-a7f6-58bddca2b29a&acdnat=1528346775_0fcf187161655a2b6fe6aeb18defa85f Food, eating behavior, and culture in Chinese society]\n* [http://confuciusmag.com/chinese-dining-etiquette Chinese dining etiquette]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chinese Table Manner}}\n[[Category:Etiquette by region|Chinese dining]]\n[[Category:Dining etiquette]]\n[[Category:Chinese cuisine]]\n", "name_user": "Punkpumpking", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTable and place settings:adding some information about the preferred usage of vinegar and soy sauce in Chinese dishes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_and_etiquette_in_Chinese_dining"}
