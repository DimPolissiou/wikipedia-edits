''[[Alyssa]]'', the 20th most popular in 2010, may sound like a variant, but it is historically of different origin, from the flower [[alyssum]].\n\nLike Adelaide, Alice's [[name day]] is [[16 December]], for [[Adelaide of Italy]].\n\n== People ==\n\n=== Royalty ===\n* [[Alice of Antioch]]\n* [[Alice of Cyprus]]\n* [[Alice Heine]], Princess consort of Monaco, wife of Albert I of Monaco\n* [[Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone]]; longest-lived Princess of The Blood Royal of the United Kingdom\n* [[Princess Alice of Battenberg]]\n* [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]], Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine; third child and second daughter of [[Queen Victoria]]\n\n=== Authors and poets ===\n* [[Alice Adams (writer)|Alice Adams]], American author\n* [[Alice Albinia]], author\n*[[Alice Birch]], British playwright and screenwriter\n* [[Alice Cary]], poet\n* [[Alice Turner Curtis]] (1860-1958), American writer\n* [[Alice Williams Brotherton]] (1848-1930), American writer\n* [[Alice May Douglas]] (1865\u20131943), American poet, author, editor\n* [[Alice Flowerdew]] (1759\u20131830), English teacher, hymnwriter, religious poet\n* [[Alice Fulton]], poet and author\n* [[Alice Greenwood]] (1862\u20131935), British historian, teacher and writer\n* [[Alice Hoffman]], author of ''[[Practical Magic]]''\n* [[Alice Emma Ives]], American dramatist, journalist\n* [[Alice Eleanor Jones]], American science fiction writer and journalist\n* [[Alice MacDonell]], Scottish poet\n* [[Alice Marriott (historian)|Alice Marriott]] (born 1910), American historian\n* [[Alice Moore McComas]] (1850\u20131919), American author, editor, lecturer, reformer\n* [[Alice McDermott]], author\n* [[Alice Duer Miller]], author and poet\n* [[Alice Munro]], Canadian author\n* [[Alice Rivaz]], Swiss author\n* [[Alice Sebold]], author of ''[[The Lovely Bones]]''\n* Alice Sheldon, better known by her pen name [[James Tiptree Jr.]]\n* [[Alice Spigelman]], Hungarian-born Australian clinical psychologist, writer and human rights advocate\n* [[Alice Tawhai]], pen name of a New Zealand fiction writer\n* [[Alice Thompson]], Scottish novelist\n* [[Alice Bellvadore Sams Turner]] (1859\u20131915), American physician, writer\n* [[Alice Voinescu]], Romanian writer\n* [[Alice Walker]], author\n* [[Alice Robinson Boise Wood]] (1846-1919), American classicist and poet\n\n=== Musicians ===\n* [[Alice (Italian singer)|Alice (Visconti, born Carla Bissi)]], Italian singer-songwriter\n* [[Song Joohee|Alice (born Song Joo-hee)]], South Korean singer, a member of [[Hello Venus]]\n* [[Alice Babs]], Swedish singer and actress\n* [[Alice Caymmi]], Brazilian singer\n* [[Alice Coltrane]], jazz pianist\n* [[Alice Cooper]], male rock musician (see also ''[[The Alice Cooper Show]]'' and ''[[Alice Cooper Goes to Hell]]'')\n* [[Alice Coote]], British opera singer\n* [[Alice Deejay]], Dutch dance music artist\n* [[Alice in Chains]], American metal band\n* [[Alice Glass]], vocalist in electronic duo [[Crystal Castles (band)|Crystal Castles]]\n* [[Alice Nutter (musician)]], a member of the British music band [[Chumbawamba]]\n* [[Alice Prin]], singer and actress\n* [[Alice Mary Smith]], English composer\n* [[Alice Spooner]], keyboardist in English [[grime (music)|Grime]]/[[New Rave]] band [[Hadouken!]]\n* [[Alice Thompson (musician)|Alice Thompson]], pianist and composer\n\n=== Actresses and filmmakers ===\n* [[Alice Barrett]], actress\n* [[Alice Bellagamba]], Italian actress and dancer\n* [[Alice Brady]], American actress\n* [[Alice Calhoun]], American silent film actress\n* [[Alice Coc\u00e9a]], French actress\n* [[Alice Connor]], British actress\n* [[Alice Davenport]], American actress\n* [[Alice Day]], American actress\n* [[Alice Dovey]], American stage actress\n* [[Alice Evans]], British-American actress\n* [[Alice Eve]], English actress\n* [[Alice Faye]], actress and singer\n* [[Alice Gale]], American actress\n* [[Alice Greczyn]], American actress\n* [[Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9]], French filmmaker\n* [[Alice Hollister]], American actress\n* [[Alice Howell]], American actress\n* [[Alice Joyce]], American silent film actress\n* [[Alice Krige]], South African actress\n* [[Alice Lake]], American actress\n* [[Alice Lowe]], actress\n* [[Ali MacGraw]], actress; birth name is Elizabeth Alice\n* [[Alice Mann]], American actress\n* [[Alice Marriott (actress)|Alice Marriott]] (1824-1900), English actress\n* [[Alice Moran]], Canadian actress\n* [[Alice Pearce]], actress\n* [[Alice Ripley]], American actress\n* [[Alice Robitaille]], Canadian actress\n* [[Alice B.

The victory in the battle consolidated the new Mughal dynasty in India.<ref>An Advanced History of India, Dr K.K.Datta, p. 429.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nUntil 1524, [[Babur]]s aim was to only expand his rule to [[Punjab region|Punjab]], mainly to fulfill the legacy of his ancestor Timur, since it used to be part of his empire.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=27\u201329}} Major parts of north India were under the rule of [[Ibrahim Lodi]] of the [[Lodi dynasty]], but the empire was crumbling and there were many defectors. He received invitations from Daulat Khan Lodi, Governor of [[Punjab]] and Ala-ud-Din, uncle of Ibrahim to invade the Delhi Sultanate. The Rajput ruler [[Rana Sanga]] upon knowing of Baburs invasion had also sent an ambassador to Babur at Kabul, offering to join in Babur's attack on Sultan [[Ibrahim Lodi]]. Sanga had offered to attack [[Agra]] while Babur would be attacking [[Delhi]]. [[Ibrahim Lodi]] was defeated in the [[First Battle of Panipat]], Babur completely destroyed the Lodi army in the battle and killed the Sultan, while losing a few hundred in the conflict.<ref name=\"RSCHMI\">{{cite book|last=Chaurasia|first=Radhey Shyam|title=History of medieval India : from 1000 A.D. to 1707 A.D.|year=2002|publisher=Atlantic Publ.|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-269-0123-3|pages=89\u201390|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8XnaL7zPXPUC&lpg=PA89&dq=babur%20receiving%20invitations%20from%20Daulat%20Khan%20Lodi&pg=PA89#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> However, while Babur did attack Lodi and took over Delhi and Agra, Sanga made no move, apparently having changed his mind. Babur had resented this backsliding; in his autobiography, Babur accuses Rana Sanga of breach of the agreement. Historian [[Satish Chandra (historian)|Satish Chandra]] speculates that Sanga may have imagined a long, drawn-struggle taking place between Babur and Lodi, following which he would be able to take control of the regions he coveted. Alternatively, writes Chandra, Sanga may have thought that in the event of a Mughal victory, Babur would withdraw from [[Delhi]] and [[Agra]], like [[Timur]], once he had seized the treasures of these cities. Once he realized that Babur intended to stay on in India, Sanga proceeded to build a grand coalition that would either force Babur out of India or confine him to Afghanistan. In early 1527 Babur started receiving reports of Sanga's advance towards Agra.{{sfn|Chandra|2006|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n==Initial skirmishes==\nAfter the [[First Battle of Panipat]], Babur had recognized that his primary threat came from two allied quarters: Rana Sanga and the Afghans ruling eastern India at the time. In a council that Babur called, it was decided that the Afghans represented the bigger threat, and consequently [[Humayun]] was sent at the head of an army to fight the Afghans in the east. However, upon hearing of Rana Sanga's advancement on Agra, Humayun was hastily recalled. Military detachments were then sent by Babur to conquer Dholpur, Gwaliar and Bayana, strong forts forming the outer boundaries of Agra. The commanders of Dholpur and Gwalior surrendered their forts to Babur, accepting his generous terms. However, Nizam Khan, the commander of Bayana, opened negotiations with both Babur and Afghans. The force sent by Babur to Bayana was defeated and dispersed by Rana Sanga.{{sfn|Chandra|2006|p=33}}\n\nErskine has described the battle between the Turks and the Rajputs at Bayana in the following words:\n\n\"They had some sharp encounters with the Rajputs, in which they had been severely handled and taught to respect their new enemy. A party from the garrison had some days before incautiously advanced too far from the fort, when the Rajputs fell upon them and drove them in. All the troops engaged in this affair united in bestowing unbounded praise on the gallantry and prowess of the enemy. Indeed the Jaghtai Turks had found that they had now to contend with a foe more formidable than the Afghans or any of the natives of India to whom they had yet been opposed. The Rajputs, energetic, chivalrous, fond of battle and bloodshed, animated by strong national spirit and led on by a hero, were ready to meet, face to face, the boldest veterans of the camp and were at all times prepared to lay down their lives for their honour.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/maharanasangahin00sardrich/page/130/mode/1up The Hindupat, the Last Great Leader of the Rajput Race. 1918. Reprint. London pg130 & 131]</ref>\n\n==Rajput-Afghan alliance against Babur==\nRana Sanga had succeeded in building a formidable military alliance against Babur. He was joined by virtually all the leading Rajput kings from Rajasthan, including those from Harauti, Jalor, Sirohi, Dungarpur and Dhundhar. [[Ganga Rathore of Marwar|Rao Ganga]] of Marwar did not join personally but sent a contingent on his behalf led by his son Maldev Rathore. Rao Medini Rai of Chanderi in Malwa also joined the alliance. Further, Mahmud Lodi, the younger son of Sikandar Lodi, whom the Afghans had proclaimed their new sultan also joined the alliance with a force of 10,000 Afghans with him. Khanzada Hasan Khan Mewati, the ruler of Mewat, also joined the alliance with a force of 12,000. Babur denounced the Afghans who joined the alliance against him as ''kafirs'' and ''murtads'' (those who had apostatized from Islam). Chandra also argues that the alliance weaved together by Sanga represented a Rajput-Afghan alliance with the proclaimed mission of expelling Babur and restoring the Lodi empire.{{sfn|Chandra|2006|p=34}}\n\n==Babur rallies his troops==\nAccording to Babur, Rana Sanga's army consisted of 200,000 soldiers. However, according to Alexander Kinloch, this is an exaggeration as the Rajput army did not exceed 40,000 men during the campaign in Gujarat.<ref>8 Chaturkula Charitra, p. 25</ref> Even if this figure is exaggerated, Chandra comments that it is indisputable that Sanga's army greatly outnumbered Babur's forces.{{sfn|Chandra|2006}} The greater numbers and reported courage of the Rajputs served to instil fear in Babur's army. An astrologer added to the general unease by his foolish predictions. To raise the flagging morale of his soldiers, Babur gave a religious colour to the battle against Hindus. Babur proceeded to renounce future consumption of wine, broke his drinking cups, poured out all the stores of liquor on the ground and promulgated a pledge of total abstinence.{{sfn|Chandra|2006|p=34}} In his autobiography, Babur writes that: {{quote|It was a really good plan, and it had a favourable propagandistic effect on friend and foe.<ref name=\"baburnama\">{{cite book |title=The Baburnama: Memoirs of Babur, Prince and Emperor |publisher=Modern Library |isbn=0-375-76137-3 |year=2002 |author=Babur, Emperor of Hindustan |others=translated, edited and annotated by W. M. Thackston |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/babarinizam00babu }}</ref>}}\n\n==The battle==\nThe Battle of Khanwa took place at Khanwa, near [[Fatehpur Sikri|Fatehpur-Sikri]], on 16 March 1527. Before the battle, Babur had carefully inspected the site. Like in Panipat, he strengthened his front by procuring carts that were fastened by iron chains (not leather straps, as at Panipat) in the Ottoman fashion. These were used for providing shelter to horses and for storing artillery. Gaps between the carts were used for horsemen to charge at the opponent at an opportune time. To lengthen the line, ropes made of rawhide were placed over wheeled wooden tripods. Behind the tripods, matchlock men were placed who could fire and, if required, advance. The flanks were given protection by digging ditches. In addition to the regular force, small contingents were kept apart on the left flank and in front for the ''tulghuma'' (flanking) tactic. Thus, a strong offensive-defensive formation had been prepared by Babur. Rana Sanga, fighting in a traditional way, attacked the Mughal army's flanks. He was prevented from breaking through by reinforcements dispatched by Babur. Once the advance of the Rajputs and their Afghan allies had been contained, Babur's flanking tactic came into play. The carts and matchlock men were ordered to advance, hemming in the Rajputs and their allies. At about this time [[Silhadi]] of Raisen deserted the Ranas army and went over to [[Babur]]'s. Despite putting up a gallant fight, Rana Sanga and his allies suffered a disastrous defeat. Following his victory, Babur ordered a tower of enemy skulls to be erected, a practice formulated by [[Timur]] against his adversaries, irrespective of their religious beliefs. According to Chandra, the objective of constructing a tower of skulls was not just to record a great victory, but also to terrorize opponents. Earlier, the same tactic had been used by Babur against the Afghans of Bajaur.{{sfn|Chandra|2006}}{{page needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Battle of Khanwa demonstrated that Rajput bravery was not enough to counter Babur's superior generalship and organizational skills. Babur himself commented: {{Quote|Swordsmen though some Hindustanis maybe, most of them are ignorant and unskilled in military move and stand, in soldierly counsel and procedure.}}{{sfn|Chandra|2006|p=35}}\n\nRana Sanga managed to evade capture and escape to Chittor, but the grand alliance he had built collapsed. Quoting [[L. F. Rushbrook Williams|Rushbrook Williams]], Chandra writes: {{Quote|The powerful confederacy which depended so largely for its unity upon the strength and reputation of Mewar, was shattered by a single defeat and ceased henceforth to be a dominant factor in the politics of Hindustan.}}{{sfn|Chandra|2006}}\n\nOn 30 January 1528 Rana Sanga died in Chittor, apparently poisoned by his own chiefs, who held his plans of renewing the fight with Babur to be suicidal.{{sfn|Chandra|2006}}\n\nIt is suggested that had it not been for the cannon of Babur, Rana Sanga might have achieved victory.

It was fought between the invading forces of the first [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Babur]] and the [[Rajput|Rajput forces]] led by [[Rana Sanga]] of [[Mewar]], after the [[Battle of Panipat (1526)|Battle of Panipat]]. The victory in the battle consolidated the new Mughal dynasty in India.<ref>An Advanced History of India, Dr K.K.Datta, p. 429.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nUntil 1524, [[Babur]]s aim was to only expand his rule to [[Punjab region|Punjab]], mainly to fulfill the legacy of his ancestor Timur, since it used to be part of his empire.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=27\u201329}} Major parts of north India were under the rule of [[Ibrahim Lodi]] of the [[Lodi dynasty]], but the empire was crumbling and there were many defectors. He received invitations from Daulat Khan Lodi, Governor of [[Punjab]] and Ala-ud-Din, uncle of Ibrahim to invade the Delhi Sultanate. The Rajput ruler [[Rana Sanga]] upon knowing of Baburs invasion had also sent an ambassador to Babur at Kabul, offering to join in Babur's attack on Sultan [[Ibrahim Lodi]]. Sanga had offered to attack [[Agra]] while Babur would be attacking [[Delhi]]. [[Ibrahim Lodi]] was defeated in the [[First Battle of Panipat]], Babur completely destroyed the Lodi army in the battle and killed the Sultan, while losing a few hundred in the conflict.<ref name=\"RSCHMI\">{{cite book|last=Chaurasia|first=Radhey Shyam|title=History of medieval India : from 1000 A.D. to 1707 A.D.|year=2002|publisher=Atlantic Publ.|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-269-0123-3|pages=89\u201390|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8XnaL7zPXPUC&lpg=PA89&dq=babur%20receiving%20invitations%20from%20Daulat%20Khan%20Lodi&pg=PA89#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> However, while Babur did attack Lodi and took over Delhi and Agra, Sanga made no move, apparently having changed his mind. Babur had resented this backsliding; in his autobiography, Babur accuses Rana Sanga of breach of the agreement. Historian [[Satish Chandra (historian)|Satish Chandra]] speculates that Sanga may have imagined a long, drawn-struggle taking place between Babur and Lodi, following which he would be able to take control of the regions he coveted. Alternatively, writes Chandra, Sanga may have thought that in the event of a Mughal victory, Babur would withdraw from [[Delhi]] and [[Agra]], like [[Timur]], once he had seized the treasures of these cities. Once he realized that Babur intended to stay on in India, Sanga proceeded to build a grand coalition that would either force Babur out of India or confine him to Afghanistan. In early 1527 Babur started receiving reports of Sanga's advance towards Agra.{{sfn|Chandra|2006|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n==Initial skirmishes==\nAfter the [[First Battle of Panipat]], Babur had recognized that his primary threat came from two allied quarters: Rana Sanga and the Afghans ruling eastern India at the time. In a council that Babur called, it was decided that the Afghans represented the bigger threat, and consequently [[Humayun]] was sent at the head of an army to fight the Afghans in the east. However, upon hearing of Rana Sanga's advancement on Agra, Humayun was hastily recalled. Military detachments were then sent by Babur to conquer Dholpur, Gwaliar and Bayana, strong forts forming the outer boundaries of Agra. The commanders of Dholpur and Gwalior surrendered their forts to Babur, accepting his generous terms. However, Nizam Khan, the commander of Bayana, opened negotiations with both Babur and Afghans. The force sent by Babur to Bayana was defeated and dispersed by Rana Sanga.{{sfn|Chandra|2006|p=33}}\n\n==Rajput-Afghan alliance against Babur==\nRana Sanga had succeeded in building a formidable military alliance against Babur. He was joined by virtually all the leading Rajput kings from Rajasthan, including those from Harauti, Jalor, Sirohi, Dungarpur and Dhundhar. [[Ganga Rathore of Marwar|Rao Ganga]] of Marwar did not join personally but sent a contingent on his behalf led by his son Maldev Rathore. Rao Medini Rai of Chanderi in Malwa also joined the alliance. Further, Mahmud Lodi, the younger son of Sikandar Lodi, whom the Afghans had proclaimed their new sultan also joined the alliance with a force of 10,000 Afghans with him. Khanzada Hasan Khan Mewati, the ruler of Mewat, also joined the alliance with a force of 12,000. Babur denounced the Afghans who joined the alliance against him as ''kafirs'' and ''murtads'' (those who had apostatized from Islam). Chandra also argues that the alliance weaved together by Sanga represented a Rajput-Afghan alliance with the proclaimed mission of expelling Babur and restoring the Lodi empire.{{sfn|Chandra|2006|p=34}}\n\n==Babur rallies his troops==\nAccording to Babur, Rana Sanga's army consisted of 200,000 soldiers. However, according to Alexander Kinloch, this is an exaggeration as the Rajput army did not exceed 40,000 men during the campaign in Gujarat.<ref>8 Chaturkula Charitra, p. 25</ref> Even if this figure is exaggerated, Chandra comments that it is indisputable that Sanga's army greatly outnumbered Babur's forces.{{sfn|Chandra|2006}} The greater numbers and reported courage of the Rajputs served to instil fear in Babur's army. An astrologer added to the general unease by his foolish predictions. To raise the flagging morale of his soldiers, Babur gave a religious colour to the battle against Hindus. Babur proceeded to renounce future consumption of wine, broke his drinking cups, poured out all the stores of liquor on the ground and promulgated a pledge of total abstinence.{{sfn|Chandra|2006|p=34}} In his autobiography, Babur writes that: {{quote|It was a really good plan, and it had a favourable propagandistic effect on friend and foe.<ref name=\"baburnama\">{{cite book |title=The Baburnama: Memoirs of Babur, Prince and Emperor |publisher=Modern Library |isbn=0-375-76137-3 |year=2002 |author=Babur, Emperor of Hindustan |others=translated, edited and annotated by W. M. Thackston |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/babarinizam00babu }}</ref>}}\n\n==The battle==\nThe Battle of Khanwa took place at Khanwa, near [[Fatehpur Sikri|Fatehpur-Sikri]], on 16 March 1527. Before the battle, Babur had carefully inspected the site. Like in Panipat, he strengthened his front by procuring carts that were fastened by iron chains (not leather straps, as at Panipat) in the Ottoman fashion. These were used for providing shelter to horses and for storing artillery. Gaps between the carts were used for horsemen to charge at the opponent at an opportune time. To lengthen the line, ropes made of rawhide were placed over wheeled wooden tripods. Behind the tripods, matchlock men were placed who could fire and, if required, advance. The flanks were given protection by digging ditches. In addition to the regular force, small contingents were kept apart on the left flank and in front for the ''tulghuma'' (flanking) tactic. Thus, a strong offensive-defensive formation had been prepared by Babur. Rana Sanga, fighting in a traditional way, attacked the Mughal army's flanks. He was prevented from breaking through by reinforcements dispatched by Babur. Once the advance of the Rajputs and their Afghan allies had been contained, Babur's flanking tactic came into play. The carts and matchlock men were ordered to advance, hemming in the Rajputs and their allies. At about this time [[Silhadi]] of Raisen deserted the Ranas army and went over to [[Babur]]'s. Despite putting up a gallant fight, Rana Sanga and his allies suffered a disastrous defeat. Following his victory, Babur ordered a tower of enemy skulls to be erected, a practice formulated by [[Timur]] against his adversaries, irrespective of their religious beliefs. According to Chandra, the objective of constructing a tower of skulls was not just to record a great victory, but also to terrorize opponents. Earlier, the same tactic had been used by Babur against the Afghans of Bajaur.{{sfn|Chandra|2006}}{{page needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Battle of Khanwa demonstrated that Rajput bravery was not enough to counter Babur's superior generalship and organizational skills. Babur himself commented: {{Quote|Swordsmen though some Hindustanis maybe, most of them are ignorant and unskilled in military move and stand, in soldierly counsel and procedure.}}{{sfn|Chandra|2006|p=35}}\n\nRana Sanga managed to evade capture and escape to Chittor, but the grand alliance he had built collapsed. Quoting [[L. F. Rushbrook Williams|Rushbrook Williams]], Chandra writes: {{Quote|The powerful confederacy which depended so largely for its unity upon the strength and reputation of Mewar, was shattered by a single defeat and ceased henceforth to be a dominant factor in the politics of Hindustan.}}{{sfn|Chandra|2006}}\n\nOn 30 January 1528 Rana Sanga died in Chittor, apparently poisoned by his own chiefs, who held his plans of renewing the fight with Babur to be suicidal.{{sfn|Chandra|2006}}\n\nIt is suggested that had it not been for the cannon of Babur, Rana Sanga might have achieved victory.

Vyaghra Deo, brother of the ruler of Gujrat, is said to have made his way into northern India about the middle of the thirteenth century and obtained the fort of Marpha, 18 miles north-east of [[Kalinjar Fort|Kalinjar]]. of [[Bandhavgarh Fort|Bandhavgarh]] (now in the [[tehsil]] of the same name in [[Umaria district]]), which, until its conquest in 1562 by [[Akbar the Great]], was the Baghel capital. In 1298, general prince [[Ulugh Khan]], acting under order of his brother Sultan [[Alauddin Khalji]], drove the last Baghel ruler of Gujrat out of his country. This is believed to have caused a considerable migration of the Baghels to Bandhavgarh.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nFrom then until the 15th century, the Baghels of Bandhavgarh were engaged in extending their possessions and so they escaped the attention of the Delhi Sultans. In 1498\u201399, Sikandar Lodi failed in his attempt to take the fort of Bandhavgarh.\n\nThe Baghel King Ramchandra (1555\u201392) was a contemporary of [[padshah]] (emperor) [[Akbar the Great]]. [[Tansen]], the great musician, was in the court of Ramchandra and from there Akbar summoned him to his Mughal court. After the death of Birdhabra, Ramchandra's son [[Vikramaditya]] acceded to the [[Rajput]] throne of [[Bandhogarh State|Bandhogarh]] as a minor Raja, giving rise to civic disturbances. Akbar's generals intervened, capturing and dismantling the Bandhogarh fort in 1562. From then, the town of [[Rewa, Madhya Pradesh|Rewa]], along with the Sultanate of [[Malwa]] were became a part of the Great Mughal Empire.\n\nFollowing the [[Treaty of Bassein (1802)|Treaty of Bassein]] (1802), the British made overtures of alliance to the ruler of [[Rewari district|Rewa]], but the latter rejected them. In 1812, during the time of Raja Jaisingh (1809\u201335), a body of [[Pindaris]] raided Mirzapur from Rewa territory. As a result, Jaisingh was called upon to accede to a treaty, in which he acknowledged the protection of the British Government, and agreed to refer all disputes with neighboring chiefs to their arbitration and to allow British troops to march through, or be cantoned within, his territories.\n\nDuring the mutiny of 1857, Maharaja Raghuraj Singh helped the British in quelling the uprisings in the neighboring [[Mandla]] and [[Jabalpur]] district, and in [[Nagod]] which is now a part of Satna district. For his part the king was rewarded by restoration of the [[Sohagpur]] ([[Shahdol]]) and [[Amarkantak]] [[parganas]], which had been seized by the [[Maratha]]s in the beginning of the century.\nRewa was entitled as a Maharaja\"His Highness\" and salute of 17 guns.\n\n===Princely states ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n\n==== Baroundha state====\nBaroundha state belongs to \"Raghuvanshi\" \"clan\"of [[Rajput]]s the most prestigious clan amongst Rajputs according to Hindu literature(Ramayan).

From 1788 to 1790 Maihar State was occupied by Banda. The state became a princely state of British India in the early 19th century, and was administered as part of Bundelkhand Agency in the Central India Agency. In 1871 the eastern states of Bundelkhand Agency, including Maihar, were separated to form the new Bagelkhand Agency in Central India. In 1933 Maihar, along with ten other states in western Bagelkhand, were transferred back to the Bundelkhand Agency.\n\nThe state suffered severely from famine in 1896\u20131897. Maihar became a station on the East Indian Railway (now the West Central Railway) line between Satna and Jabalpur, 156 kilometres (97&nbsp;mi) north of Jabalpur. Extensive ruins of shrines and other buildings surround the town. As of 1940 it had a population of 79,558 and an area of 412 square miles. In 1948 Maihar was merged into India.\n\n====Kothi state====\n{{See also|Kothi, Satna}}\n[[Kothi State]] was a princely state of the British Raj. It belonged to the Bagelkhand Agency of Central India. Its capital was at Kothi, in modern Satna district of Madhya Pradesh. It was a relatively small Sanad state of about 438 km2 with a population of 19,112 inhabitants in 1901. The state's territory divided neighbouring Sohawal State in two parts.<ref name=\"IGI1\">[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V23_076.gif Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 23, p. 70.]</ref> Kothi State was founded at an uncertain date by a [[Rajput]] ruler who expelled the former Bharr ruler of the area.\n\nTowards the beginning of the nineteenth century, and in much the same manner as neighboring Sohawal, Kothi became a British protectorate initially subordinate to Panna State. However, a separate sanad was granted to Rais Lal Duniyapati Singh in 1810. The last ruler of Kothi signed the instrument of accession to the Indian Union on 1 January 1950.\n\n====Sohawal state====\n[[Sohawal State]] was a princely state of the Bagelkhand Agency of the British Raj. It was a relatively small [[sanad (deed)|sanad]] state of about 552 km2 with a population of 32,216 inhabitants in 1901. Its capital was at Sohawal, a small town \u20142,108 inhabitants in 1901\u2014 located in modern Satna district of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe state was divided in two sections, separated by territory belonging to [[Kothi State]] and, on its northern side, it formed a small enclave within neighbouring [[Panna State]].\n\nSohawal State was founded in the mid sixteenth century by a ruler named Fateh Singh. It had originally been much larger, but lost significant territory within the first centuries of its existence.\n\nSohawal became a British [[protectorate]], initially subordinate to Panna State, but a separate sanad was granted to Rais Aman Singh in 1809. During the 1830 - 1833 interregnum, Sohawal came under direct British administration.[2] The last ruler of Sohawal signed the instrument of accession to the Indian Union on 1 January 1950.\n\n* [[Chaube Jagirs]] (five feudatory estates).\n\n===Modern history===\n\nThe Satna District is part of the region of [[Bagelkhand]], a large part of which was ruled by the state of [[Rewa (princely state)|Rewa]]. A small part of Satna was ruled by feudatory chiefs, holding their states under the [[British Raj]]. Satna's name comes from the Satna River (or Sutna) which originates at Sarang Ashram (Sutikshna Ashram), situated near Sarangpur village in the Panna district. Previously, Sutna was the name of the railway station, the town being Raghurajnagar, but gradually the name of the station became associated with the city that is now Satna.\n\nDuring the [[Ramayana|Ramayana Era]], Lord [[Rama]] stayed in the region of Chitrakoot, half of which is in the outskirts of Satna, the other in Uttar Pradesh.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nOnce a British headquarters, the [[Baghelkhand Agency]] was established in Satna in 1872 (and abolished in 1931).

Vyaghra Deo, brother of the ruler of Gujrat, is said to have made his way into northern India about the middle of the thirteenth century and obtained the fort of Marpha, 18 miles north-east of [[Kalinjar Fort|Kalinjar]]. of [[Bandhavgarh Fort|Bandhavgarh]] (now in the [[tehsil]] of the same name in [[Umaria district]]), which, until its conquest in 1562 by [[Akbar the Great]], was the Baghel capital. In 1298, general prince [[Ulugh Khan]], acting under order of his brother Sultan [[Alauddin Khalji]], drove the last Baghel ruler of Gujrat out of his country. This is believed to have caused a considerable migration of the Baghels to Bandhavgarh.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nFrom then until the 15th century, the Baghels of Bandhavgarh were engaged in extending their possessions and so they escaped the attention of the Delhi Sultans.

In 1812, during the time of Raja Jaisingh (1809\u201335), a body of [[Pindaris]] raided Mirzapur from Rewa territory. As a result, Jaisingh was called upon to accede to a treaty, in which he acknowledged the protection of the British Government, and agreed to refer all disputes with neighboring chiefs to their arbitration and to allow British troops to march through, or be cantoned within, his territories.\n\nDuring the mutiny of 1857, Maharaja Raghuraj Singh helped the British in quelling the uprisings in the neighboring [[Mandla]] and [[Jabalpur]] district, and in [[Nagod]] which is now a part of Satna district.

In 1809, however, a separate sanad was granted to Lal Sheshraj Singh confirming him in his possessions.\n\nFor his loyalty during the 1857 mutiny, Chief Raghvendra Singh was rewarded by the British who granted him eleven villages, which had formerly belonged to the confiscated state of Bijeraghogarh.\n\n[[Nagod]] [[tribal chief|chief]]s had the title of Raja and received a 9 [[gun salute]].\n\n====Maihar state====\n{{See also|Maihar}}\n[[Maihar State]] was a [[princely state]] in India during the British Raj. The state had an area of 1,050 square kilometres (407 sq mi), and a population of 63,702 in 1901. The state, which included the Tons River, consists mainly of alluvial soil covering sandstone, and is fertile except in the hilly district of the south. A large area was forested, and lumber provided a small export trade.\n\nThe state was founded in 1778 by [[Rajput]] of the [[Kachwaha]] clan, who were granted land by the ruler of the nearby state of Orchha. From 1788 to 1790 Maihar State was occupied by Banda. The state became a princely state of British India in the early 19th century, and was administered as part of Bundelkhand Agency in the Central India Agency. In 1871 the eastern states of Bundelkhand Agency, including Maihar, were separated to form the new Bagelkhand Agency in Central India. In 1933 Maihar, along with ten other states in western Bagelkhand, were transferred back to the Bundelkhand Agency.\n\nThe state suffered severely from famine in 1896\u20131897. Maihar became a station on the East Indian Railway (now the West Central Railway) line between Satna and Jabalpur, 156 kilometres (97&nbsp;mi) north of Jabalpur.

However, a separate sanad was granted to Rais Lal Duniyapati Singh in 1810. The last ruler of Kothi signed the instrument of accession to the Indian Union on 1 January 1950.\n\n====Sohawal state====\n[[Sohawal State]] was a princely state of the Bagelkhand Agency of the British Raj. It was a relatively small [[sanad (deed)|sanad]] state of about 552 km2 with a population of 32,216 inhabitants in 1901. Its capital was at Sohawal, a small town \u20142,108 inhabitants in 1901\u2014 located in modern Satna district of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe state was divided in two sections, separated by territory belonging to [[Kothi State]] and, on its northern side, it formed a small enclave within neighbouring [[Panna State]].\n\nSohawal State was founded in the mid sixteenth century by a ruler named Fateh Singh. It had originally been much larger, but lost significant territory within the first centuries of its existence.\n\nSohawal became a British [[protectorate]], initially subordinate to Panna State, but a separate sanad was granted to Rais Aman Singh in 1809. During the 1830 - 1833 interregnum, Sohawal came under direct British administration.[2] The last ruler of Sohawal signed the instrument of accession to the Indian Union on 1 January 1950.\n\n* [[Chaube Jagirs]] (five feudatory estates).\n\n===Modern history===\n\nThe Satna District is part of the region of [[Bagelkhand]], a large part of which was ruled by the state of [[Rewa (princely state)|Rewa]]. A small part of Satna was ruled by feudatory chiefs, holding their states under the [[British Raj]]. Satna's name comes from the Satna River (or Sutna) which originates at Sarang Ashram (Sutikshna Ashram), situated near Sarangpur village in the Panna district.

On August 12, 2016, TDOT announced that it would begin re-signing the route on August 14 and that work would be complete later in the year.\n\n==Route description==\nI-840 begins at an interchange in [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]] near Dickson. It initially runs southeast through a predominantly hilly terrain, and crosses briefly into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later. The route remains in Hickman County for less than {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}, before crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], and reaching an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 100|State Route 100]] (SR 100) about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. I-840 continues through a predominantly rural area, characterized by rolling hills with moderate grades, and reaches [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]] at an interchange near the community of [[Leiper's Fork, Tennessee|Leiper's Fork]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-840 crosses the [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] and turns east. I-840 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 31]] (US 31) about {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, and about {{convert|2|mi|km}} beyond this point is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|US 431]] Less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, I-840 comes to an interchange with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]] south of Franklin in an interchange that resembles a [[cloverstack interchange]], containing two loop ramps and two underpass ramps that cross I-840 combined together. The route continues through a hilly terrain with several steep grades, and comes to an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31 Alternate (Tennessee)|US 31 Alternate]] and [[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee \u2013 Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41 Alternate]] about {{convert|11|mi|km}} later near the community of [[Triune, Tennessee|Triune]]. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later I-840 crosses [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]] at the top of a large hill, and begins a steep downgrade, with the westbound lanes utilizing a [[truck climbing lane]] over a short distance and crossing into [[Rutherford County, Tennessee|Rutherford County]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-840 comes to an interchange with I-24 northwest of [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]]. This interchange is almost a complete [[cloverleaf interchange|cloverleaf]], containing three loop ramps and one [[overpass|flyover]]. The route then turns northeast, passing through a relatively flat region, and interchanges with [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]] and [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]] in a cloverstack interchange about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later, I-840 crosses into [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]] about {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond this point. The route then turns slightly northeast, and about {{convert|3.8|mi|km}} later reaches its eastern terminus with I-40 west of Lebanon.<ref name=google>{{google maps |url = https://www.google.com/maps/place/I-840,+Tennessee/@36.0861572,-86.596612,66351m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x88647b9afed8536b:0x963e9004ea8fed0f!8m2!3d36.0895955!4d-86.427016 |title = I-840 |access-date = December 18, 2017 |link = no }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Infobox road small\n|state=TN\n|type=SR\n|route=840\n|location=[[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]\u2013[[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]\n|formed=1991\n|deleted=2016\n|length_mi=77.28\n|length_ref=<ref name=\"840hold\"/>\n}}\n\nIn 1975 the Tennessee Highway System Plan issued by TDOT for the next four years first identified the need for an outer beltway around Nashville within the next 20 years.<ref name=FWHA>{{cite book |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation |year = 1995 |volume = Vol. 2 |title = Proposed Route 840 North from Interstate 65 to Interstate 40 West of Nashville in Robertson, Cheatham, Dickson, and Montgomery Counties, Tennessee |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qrM1AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |location = Nashville |publisher = Tennessee Department of Transportation |page =  |id = FHWA-TN-ESI-9501-D |access-date = December 18, 2017 |via = Google Books }}</ref> The I-840 project was initiated in 1986 with the passage of the Better Roads Program in the [[Tennessee General Assembly]].

legislature in 1993.<ref name=\"840hold\"/> Environmental studies began in 1994 and a [[draft environmental impact statement|draft]] [[environmental impact statement]] (DEIS) was released in 1995.<ref name=FWHA/> Many residents in the predominantly rural and agricultural areas where the route was to pass were initially opposed.<ref name=FWHA/> Plans were later abandoned and the General Assembly ordered TDOT to discontinue further studies and planning of that highway because of state budget problems. An entire circular loop would possibly be about {{convert|178|mi|km}} long, ranging from {{convert|86|to|116|mi|km}}. Other important objections against additional extensions of the I-840 highway include the hilly nature of the terrain north of Nashville (the [[Highland Rim]]), which would require huge and costly amounts of excavation, soil relocation, and bridge construction. In October 2003, TDOT placed the northern loop plan on indefinite hold, citing a lack of documented transportation needs and lack of participation from local politicians.<ref name=\"840hold\">{{cite press release |author = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]] |date = October 31, 2003 |url = http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/news/2003/ut_projects/10-31-2003sr840n.pdf |title = TDOT Announces Decision on State Route 840 North |publisher = Tennessee Department of Transportation |format = PDF |access-date = July 17, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071127233215/http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/news/2003/ut_projects/10-31-2003sr840n.pdf |archive-date = November 27, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Redesignation===\n[[File:Interstate 840.jpg|thumb|right|Same section of I-40 in 2017, showing signage for I-840.]]\nIn 2015, TDOT submitted a request to [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|AASHTO]] to redesignate SR&nbsp;840 as I-840.

On August 12, 2016, TDOT announced that it would begin re-signing the route on August 14 and that work would be complete later in the year.\n\n==Route description==\nI-840 begins at an interchange in [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]] near Dickson. It initially runs southeast through a predominantly hilly terrain, and crosses briefly into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later. The route remains in Hickman County for less than {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}, before crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], and reaching an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 100|State Route 100]] (SR 100) about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. I-840 continues through a predominantly rural area, characterized by rolling hills with moderate grades, and reaches [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]] at an interchange near the community of [[Leiper's Fork, Tennessee|Leiper's Fork]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-840 crosses the [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] and turns east. I-840 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 31]] (US 31) about {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, and about {{convert|2|mi|km}} beyond this point is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|US 431]] Less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, I-840 comes to an interchange with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]] south of Franklin in an interchange that resembles a [[cloverstack interchange]], containing two loop ramps and two underpass ramps that cross I-840 combined together. The route continues through a hilly terrain with several steep grades, and comes to an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31 Alternate (Tennessee)|US 31 Alternate]] and [[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee \u2013 Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41 Alternate]] about {{convert|11|mi|km}} later near the community of [[Triune, Tennessee|Triune]]. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later I-840 crosses [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]] at the top of a large hill, and begins a steep downgrade, with the westbound lanes utilizing a [[truck climbing lane]] over a short distance and crossing into [[Rutherford County, Tennessee|Rutherford County]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-840 comes to an interchange with I-24 northwest of [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]]. This interchange is almost a complete [[cloverleaf interchange|cloverleaf]], containing three loop ramps and one [[overpass|flyover]]. The route then turns northeast, passing through a relatively flat region, and interchanges with [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]] and [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]] in a cloverstack interchange about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later, I-840 crosses into [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]] about {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond this point. The route then turns slightly northeast, and about {{convert|3.8|mi|km}} later reaches its eastern terminus with I-40 west of Lebanon.<ref name=google>{{google maps |url = https://www.google.com/maps/place/I-840,+Tennessee/@36.0861572,-86.596612,66351m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x88647b9afed8536b:0x963e9004ea8fed0f!8m2!3d36.0895955!4d-86.427016 |title = I-840 |access-date = December 18, 2017 |link = no }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Infobox road small\n|state=TN\n|type=SR\n|route=840\n|location=[[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]\u2013[[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]\n|formed=1991\n|deleted=2016\n|length_mi=77.28\n|length_ref=<ref name=\"840hold\"/>\n}}\n\nIn 1975 the Tennessee Highway System Plan issued by TDOT for the next four years first identified the need for an outer beltway around Nashville within the next 20 years.<ref name=FWHA>{{cite book |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation |year = 1995 |volume = Vol. 2 |title = Proposed Route 840 North from Interstate 65 to Interstate 40 West of Nashville in Robertson, Cheatham, Dickson, and Montgomery Counties, Tennessee |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qrM1AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |location = Nashville |publisher = Tennessee Department of Transportation |page =  |id = FHWA-TN-ESI-9501-D |access-date = December 18, 2017 |via = Google Books }}</ref> The I-840 project was initiated in 1986 with the passage of the Better Roads Program in the [[Tennessee General Assembly]].

legislature in 1993.<ref name=\"840hold\"/> Environmental studies began in 1994 and a [[draft environmental impact statement|draft]] [[environmental impact statement]] (DEIS) was released in 1995.<ref name=FWHA/> Many residents in the predominantly rural and agricultural areas where the route was to pass were initially opposed.<ref name=FWHA/> Plans were later abandoned and the General Assembly ordered TDOT to discontinue further studies and planning of that highway because of state budget problems. An entire circular loop would possibly be about {{convert|178|mi|km}} long, ranging from {{convert|86|to|116|mi|km}}. Other important objections against additional extensions of the I-840 highway include the hilly nature of the terrain north of Nashville (the [[Highland Rim]]), which would require huge and costly amounts of excavation, soil relocation, and bridge construction. In October 2003, TDOT placed the northern loop plan on indefinite hold, citing a lack of documented transportation needs and lack of participation from local politicians.<ref name=\"840hold\">{{cite press release |author = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]] |date = October 31, 2003 |url = http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/news/2003/ut_projects/10-31-2003sr840n.pdf |title = TDOT Announces Decision on State Route 840 North |publisher = Tennessee Department of Transportation |format = PDF |access-date = July 17, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071127233215/http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/news/2003/ut_projects/10-31-2003sr840n.pdf |archive-date = November 27, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Redesignation===\n[[File:Interstate 840.jpg|thumb|right|Same section of I-40 in 2017, showing signage for I-840.]]\nIn 2015, TDOT submitted a request to [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|AASHTO]] to redesignate SR&nbsp;840 as I-840.
