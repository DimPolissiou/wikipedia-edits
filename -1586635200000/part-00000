The club plays in the [[Frauen-Bundesliga]], the top tier of German women's football.\n\n==History==\nThe origin of Bayer Leverkusen women's football section lies at the [[SV Bergisch Gladbach 09|SSG 09 Bergisch Gladbach]], which in the 1970s and 1980s was the dominating club in German women's football. In that period Bergisch Gladbach won the national [[List of German women's football champions|women's football championship]] nine times which today is still the record. They also won the [[Frauen DFB Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] three times. After the inception of the [[Frauen-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] in 1990 their performance declined through the 1990s, eventually leading to relegation.\n\nIn 1996 the women's team moved from SSG 09 Bergisch Gladbach to [[TuS K\u00f6ln rrh.]]. At K\u00f6ln the team played mostly second-tier football with a few seasons in the third tier in between. Their greatest success was a semi-final appearance in the [[2007\u201308 DFB-Pokal (women)|2007\u201308 cup]]. However the team was not able to find sponsors, that would help to realize the team's ambitions of playing Bundesliga football again. Contemporaneously Bayer Leverkusen pronounced their interest to establish a women's football section of their own. On 25 June 2008 the women's football department of TuS K\u00f6ln rrh. disbanded to join Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nIn their first season at Bayer Leverkusen the team finished 7th in the south group of the [[2. Frauen-Bundesliga|2. Bundesliga]]. The [[2009\u201310 2. Frauen-Bundesliga|following season]] Leverkusen became champions of the 2. Bundesliga and would thus play in the Bundesliga in the [[2010\u201311 Frauen-Bundesliga|2010\u201311 season]]. In its debut season the team finished 8th.\n\nThe [[2011\u201312 Frauen-Bundesliga|following season]] the team finished 11th in the table, yet wasn't relegated as [[Hamburger SV (women)|Hamburger SV]] announced its disestablishment of the women's section. Since the [[2012\u201313 Frauen-Bundesliga|2012\u201313 season]], Leverkusen had been coached by [[Thomas Obliers]], until his resignation in 2017. Leverkusen were relegated back to the 2.

Suddenly, a loud bang is heard from the parking lot, which turns out to be a bomb set off in Matt Royston's car. As the students are distracted by the noise, gunshots are fired. When Patrick, the only detective on the Sterling police force, arrives at Sterling High, he searches the school to seek out the gunman, who is alleged to be a student. After passing several dead and wounded victims, Patrick traps and arrests the shooter, Peter Houghton, in the locker room, where he finds two students, Josie Cormier and Matt Royston, lying on the floor surrounded in blood. While Matt is dead, having been the only victim shot twice, Josie is not seriously injured, but only shocked: she cannot remember what happened.\n\nThe shooting kills ten people (nine students and one teacher) and wounds many other people.\n\nThroughout the book, time flashes back and forth between events before and after the shooting. In the past, the reader learns that Peter and Josie were once close friends. Peter was frequently the target of severe bullying at school, and Josie often stuck up for him. The friends slowly drifted apart as they got older: Josie joined the popular crowd in order to protect her own interests, seeing her relationship to Peter as embarrassing. The story pictures Peter as an outcast at home as well; Peter believes his older brother Joey is favored by their parents. Joey is a popular straight-A student and athlete, but feels it necessary to ridicule Peter to protect his reputation, even fabricating a story that Peter was adopted. When Joey is killed in a car accident in 2006, Lacy and Lewis Houghton are too upset to pay attention to their remaining son, causing a bigger rift between Peter and his parents.\n\nIn their sophomore year, Josie begins dating Matt, a popular jock who leads his friends Drew Girard and John Eberhard in bullying Peter. Matt often calls Peter \"homo\" and \"fag,\" leading Peter to question his sexual orientation. The bullying intensifies once Matt begins dating Josie, in his possessive efforts to keep her away from other boys. On one occasion, Peter approaches Josie after school to try talking to her. Matt beats him up, leaving Peter humiliated in front of the school.\n\nThe flashbacks also reveal several subplots: the difficult relationship between Josie and her single mother Alex, Alex's dilemma of being a judge and a mother, Peter's escape from bullying into the world of video games, Josie's fear of falling out of the popular crowd and her suicide back-up plan when she does, Matt's abusive behavior toward Josie, Josie's pregnancy and subsequent miscarriage, as well as Lewis Houghton's hunting lessons with his son Peter.\n\nOne month before the shooting, Peter realizes that he has feelings for Josie, and sends her an email expressing his love. Courtney Ignatio reads this email before Josie and has Drew forward it to the entire school. Courtney then convinces Peter that Josie likes him. Peter asks Josie to join him later during lunch, only to suffer public humiliation as Matt pulls down Peter's pants and exposes his genitals to a cafeteria full of students. Peter's psychotic break is triggered on the morning of the shooting when he turns on his computer and accidentally opens the email he wrote to Josie.\n\nAfter the shooting, Peter is sent to jail while the trial proceeds. The [[Probable cause#Probable cause hearings|probable cause hearing]] is waived as Peter admits to killing ten people and wounding nineteen others. Jordan, Peter's defense attorney, uses [[battered person syndrome]] caused by severe bullying and abuse as a basis to convince the jury that Peter\u2019s actions were justified as a result of his suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Jordan argues that he was in a dissociative state at the time of the shooting. In the final stage of the trial, Josie reveals that she was the one who shot Matt the first time in the stomach after grabbing a gun that fell out of Peter's bag. She admits later that she did this on account of the abusive behavior that she had endured while in a relationship with him. Peter later fired the fatal second shot; a blow to the head. Peter promised her he wouldn't tell anyone what she had done, and he kept this promise, happy to have Josie as his friend again.\n\nPeter is convicted of eight counts of first-degree murder and two counts of [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees of murder in the United States|second-degree murder]] and is sentenced to life in prison. A month afterward, Peter commits suicide by stuffing a sock into his throat.\n\nAt the end of the book, one year from the date of the massacre, Josie has received a five-year sentence  for accessory  of manslaughter  and is regularly visited in jail by her mother. Throughout the book, Josie never told the whole story, instead repeating, \"I can't remember.\" When Josie admits to shooting Matt, Peter's sentence is reduced. Alex and Patrick, who are expecting their first child, walk the halls of the high school. Sterling High has been extensively remodeled after the shooting. The cafeteria, the gym and locker room where the massacre took place have been replaced by a large glass atrium with a memorial to the dead in the center, a row of ten white chairs bolted to the floor. A plaque declares the building \"A Safe Harbor.\"\n\n==Characters==\n*'''Peter Houghton:''' The [[protagonist]]. An odd kid, who has been mercilessly bullied for most of his life.

Suddenly, a loud bang is heard from the parking lot, which turns out to be a bomb set off in Matt Royston's car. As the students are distracted by the noise, gunshots are fired. When Patrick, the only detective on the Sterling police force, arrives at Sterling High, he searches the school to seek out the gunman, who is alleged to be a student. After passing several dead and wounded victims, Patrick traps and arrests the shooter, Peter Houghton, in the locker room, where he finds two students, Josie Cormier and Matt Royston, lying on the floor surrounded in blood. While Matt is dead, having been the only victim shot twice, Josie is not seriously injured, but only shocked: she cannot remember what happened.\n\nThe shooting kills ten people (nine students and one teacher) and wounds many other people.\n\nThroughout the book, time flashes back and forth between events before and after the shooting. In the past, the reader learns that Peter and Josie were once close friends. Peter was frequently the target of severe bullying at school, and Josie often stuck up for him. The friends slowly drifted apart as they got older: Josie joined the popular crowd in order to protect her own interests, seeing her relationship to Peter as embarrassing. The story pictures Peter as an outcast at home as well; Peter believes his older brother Joey is favored by their parents. Joey is a popular straight-A student and athlete, but feels it necessary to ridicule Peter to protect his reputation, even fabricating a story that Peter was adopted. When Joey is killed in a car accident in 2006, Lacy and Lewis Houghton are too upset to pay attention to their remaining son, causing a bigger rift between Peter and his parents.\n\nIn their sophomore year, Josie begins dating Matt, a popular jock who leads his friends Drew Girard and John Eberhard in bullying Peter. Matt often calls Peter \"homo\" and \"fag,\" leading Peter to question his sexual orientation. The bullying intensifies once Matt begins dating Josie, in his possessive efforts to keep her away from other boys. On one occasion, Peter approaches Josie after school to try talking to her. Matt beats him up, leaving Peter humiliated in front of the school.\n\nThe flashbacks also reveal several subplots: the difficult relationship between Josie and her single mother Alex, Alex's dilemma of being a judge and a mother, Peter's escape from bullying into the world of video games, Josie's fear of falling out of the popular crowd and her suicide back-up plan when she does, Matt's abusive behavior toward Josie, Josie's pregnancy and subsequent miscarriage, as well as Lewis Houghton's hunting lessons with his son Peter.\n\nOne month before the shooting, Peter realizes that he has feelings for Josie, and sends her an email expressing his love. Courtney Ignatio reads this email before Josie and has Drew forward it to the entire school. Courtney then convinces Peter that Josie likes him. Peter asks Josie to join him later during lunch, only to suffer public humiliation as Matt pulls down Peter's pants and exposes his genitals to a cafeteria full of students. Peter's psychotic break is triggered on the morning of the shooting when he turns on his computer and accidentally opens the email he wrote to Josie.\n\nAfter the shooting, Peter is sent to jail while the trial proceeds. The [[Probable cause#Probable cause hearings|probable cause hearing]] is waived as Peter admits to killing ten people and wounding nineteen others. Jordan, Peter's defense attorney, uses [[battered person syndrome]] caused by severe bullying and abuse as a basis to convince the jury that Peter\u2019s actions were justified as a result of his suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Jordan argues that he was in a dissociative state at the time of the shooting. In the final stage of the trial, Josie reveals that she was the one who shot Matt the first time in the stomach after grabbing a gun that fell out of Peter's bag. She admits later that she did this on account of the abusive behavior that she had endured while in a relationship with him. Peter later fired the fatal second shot; a blow to the head. Peter promised her he wouldn't tell anyone what she had done, and he kept this promise, happy to have Josie as his friend again.\n\nPeter is convicted of eight counts of first-degree murder and two counts of [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees of murder in the United States|second-degree murder]] and is sentenced to life in prison. A month afterward, Peter commits suicide by stuffing a sock into his throat.\n\nAt the end of the book, one year from the date of the massacre, Josie has received a five-year sentence  for accessory  of manslaughter  and is regularly visited in jail by her mother. Throughout the book, Josie never told the whole story, instead repeating, \"I can't remember.\" When Josie admits to shooting Matt, Peter's sentence is reduced. Alex and Patrick, who are expecting their first child, walk the halls of the high school. Sterling High has been extensively remodeled after the shooting. The cafeteria, the gym and locker room where the massacre took place have been replaced by a large glass atrium with a memorial to the dead in the center, a row of ten white chairs bolted to the floor. A plaque declares the building \"A Safe Harbor.\"\n\n==Characters==\n*'''Peter Houghton:''' The [[protagonist]]. An odd kid, who has been mercilessly bullied for most of his life.

During their stay the HouseGuests share their thoughts on events and other houseguests inside a private room referred to as the Diary Room.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nickiswift.com/108051/untold-truth-big-brother/ |title=The untold truth of Big Brother |last=Bianco |first=Julia |website=NickiSwift.com |language=en-US |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref> Each week, the HouseGuests compete in several competitions in order to win power and safety inside the house. At the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in the Head of Household (abbreviated as \"HoH\") competition. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. Then six HouseGuests are selected to compete in the Power of Veto (abbreviated as \"PoV\") competition: the reigning HoH and the nominees are guaranteed to play with the remaining slots being given to other HouseGuests selected by random draw. The winner of the PoV competition wins the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated HouseGuests or leave them as is. If the veto winner uses this power, the HoH must immediately nominate another HouseGuest for eviction. The PoV winner is also immune from being named as the replacement nominee. \n\nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests must vote to evict one of the nominees, with the exception of the nominees and the Head of Household. This compulsory vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. In the event of a tie the Head of Household will cast the tie-breaking vote in front of all the HouseGuests in the living room. The nominee with the most votes is evicted from the house. The last nine evicted HouseGuests, referred to as the Jury, are sequestered in a separate house following their eviction and ultimately decide the winner of the season. The Jury are not allowed  to watch the show except for competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests. They are not shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations. The viewing public is able to award an additional prize of $25,000 to their favorite HouseGuest of the season. All evicted HouseGuests are eligible to win this award except for those who either voluntary leave or forcibly removed for rule-breaking.\n\n== HouseGuests ==\n{{main|List of Big Brother 21 (American season) houseguests}} {{see also|List of Big Brother (American TV series) houseguests}}\n[[File:Big_Brother_21_Cast_Photo.jpg|thumb|500px|right|<center>'''The cast of the twenty-first season of ''Big Brother'''''</center><hr />'''Top:''' Jackson, Jessica, Cliff, Sam, and Nick<hr />'''Middle:''' Holly, Kemi, Ovi, Isabella, Nicole, Kathryn, Christie, and Tommy<hr />'''Bottom:'''Jack, Analyse, and David]]\n\nOn June 10, 2019, CBS reported that the cast would be revealed on June 17, 2019 on ''Big Brother'' live feeds to viewers with a [[CBS All Access]] subscription.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/official-heres-season-21-cast-220000959.html|title=It's Official: Here's When the Season 21 Cast of Big Brother Will Be Revealed|last=Jean-Philippe|first=McKenzie|date=June 10, 2019|accessdate=June 10, 2019|work=[[Yahoo!

He was tasked with \"banishing\" four HouseGuests, who would compete to stay in the house. Michie chose to banish Cliff, David, Jessica and Kemi. David lost the competition. As he was immune, Michie was ineligible to compete in the first Head of Household Competition.\n* {{note|2|Note 2}}: {{Color box|#87CEFA|border=darkgray}} On Day 15, ''Camp Comeback'' was introduced. David returned to the house from sequester and the next three evicted HouseGuests (Ovi, Kemi and Cliff) remained in the house after getting voted out of the game. After Cliff's eviction, the Comeback HouseGuests competed to re-enter the game. Cliff won the competition, while David, Ovi and Kemi were all evicted.\n* {{note|3|Note 3}}: {{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} Week 7 featured the ''America's Field Trip'' competition. Analyse, Christie and Michie were voted by America to compete. As the winner of the competition, Michie was immune for the week. For finishing last, Christie was nominated as a third nominee (denoted in '''bold'''). Christie's nomination did not require a replacement if the veto was used to save her.\n* {{note|4|Note 4}}: Week 9 was ''Prank Week'' and featured the ''America's Prankster'' power. America voted for Nick to be ''America's Prankster'' and took half of Holly's Head of Household power by anonymously nominating one HouseGuest at the Nomination Ceremony (denoted in '''bold''') and naming a replacement nominee if the Power of Veto is used on his nominee. Nick was not given immunity with his power and could be nominated by Holly.\n* {{note|5|Note 5}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following Jessica's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games\u2014including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n* {{note|6|Note 6}}: During the finale, the Jury members voted for which finalist should win Big Brother.\n</small>\n\n== Reception ==\n''Big Brother 21'' was criticized negatively by critics and fans due to the HouseGuests' discriminatory tendencies.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dehnart |first1=Andy |title=Big Brother 21 racism and awfulness: an update |url=https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2019/07/big-brother-21-racism-update-bb21/ |website=realityblurred.com |publisher=Reality Blurred |accessdate=25 October 2019 |date=25 July 2019}}</ref> Professor of African American studies and the UCLA Dean of Social Sciences, Darnell Hunt, stated, \"Race is the central axis of social relationships.

The HouseGuests are sequestered in the ''Big Brother House'' with no contact with the outside world. During their stay the HouseGuests share their thoughts on events and other houseguests inside a private room referred to as the Diary Room.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nickiswift.com/108051/untold-truth-big-brother/ |title=The untold truth of Big Brother |last=Bianco |first=Julia |website=NickiSwift.com |language=en-US |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref> Each week, the HouseGuests compete in several competitions in order to win power and safety inside the house. At the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in the Head of Household (abbreviated as \"HoH\") competition. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. Then six HouseGuests are selected to compete in the Power of Veto (abbreviated as \"PoV\") competition: the reigning HoH and the nominees are guaranteed to play with the remaining slots being given to other HouseGuests selected by random draw. The winner of the PoV competition wins the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated HouseGuests or leave them as is. If the veto winner uses this power, the HoH must immediately nominate another HouseGuest for eviction. The PoV winner is also immune from being named as the replacement nominee. \n\nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests must vote to evict one of the nominees, with the exception of the nominees and the Head of Household. This compulsory vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. In the event of a tie the Head of Household will cast the tie-breaking vote in front of all the HouseGuests in the living room. The nominee with the most votes is evicted from the house. The last nine evicted HouseGuests, referred to as the Jury, are sequestered in a separate house following their eviction and ultimately decide the winner of the season. The Jury are not allowed  to watch the show except for competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests. They are not shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations. The viewing public is able to award an additional prize of $25,000 to their favorite HouseGuest of the season. All evicted HouseGuests are eligible to win this award except for those who either voluntary leave or forcibly removed for rule-breaking.\n\n== HouseGuests ==\n{{main|List of Big Brother 21 (American season) houseguests}} {{see also|List of Big Brother (American TV series) houseguests}}\n[[File:Big_Brother_21_Cast_Photo.jpg|thumb|500px|right|<center>'''The cast of the twenty-first season of ''Big Brother'''''</center><hr />'''Top:''' Jackson, Jessica, Cliff, Sam, and Nick<hr />'''Middle:''' Holly, Kemi, Ovi, Isabella, Nicole, Kathryn, Christie, and Tommy<hr />'''Bottom:'''Jack, Analyse, and David]]\n\nOn June 10, 2019, CBS reported that the cast would be revealed on June 17, 2019 on ''Big Brother'' live feeds to viewers with a [[CBS All Access]] subscription.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/official-heres-season-21-cast-220000959.html|title=It's Official: Here's When the Season 21 Cast of Big Brother Will Be Revealed|last=Jean-Philippe|first=McKenzie|date=June 10, 2019|accessdate=June 10, 2019|work=[[Yahoo!

As the HouseGuests began to settle in to the House, Julie informed them that they would vote for a Camp Director, who would be safe from the first eviction and have unprecedented power in the game. Some HouseGuests campaigned for Camp Director while others did not wish to have the role. In the backyard, each HouseGuest voted for who they thought should be the Camp Cirector. Michie won with ten votes. Julie then informed Michie that he would be forced to banish four people from the game. The four banished people would then compete against each other head-to-head with three of the four re-entering the game while the fourth would remain banished and be out of the game.\n| LineColor       = #D770D2\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 21 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 708\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = {{anchor|2}}Episode 2\n| Aux1            = Days 1\u20132\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|6|26|df=y}}\n| Aux4            = 1.1/6<ref name=\"21.02\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/wednesday-final-ratings-june-26-2019/|title=Democratic Debate adjusts up, \u2018The Amazing Race\u2019 adjusts down: Wednesday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Kate|date=June 27, 2019|accessdate=June 27, 2019|work=TV by the Numbers}}</ref>\n| Viewers         = 4.52<ref name=\"21.02\" />\n| ShortSummary    = Michie begins planning on who he should banish from the ''Big Brother'' house.

The first HouseGuest to correctly identify all three items will win. Cliff, Isabella, Kathryn, Nicole and Ovi competed in the first week. At the end of the third round, Ovi correctly identified all three smells and won the competition. The power Ovi received allows Ovi to make the current HoH rename their nominees for the week in the middle of the night once all others are asleep.

The winner of the first part immediately advances to the third part, while the other two HouseGuests move on to compete in part two. In the final part, the winner of part one faces the winner of part two. The winner of the final part becomes the final HoH of the season.\n**'''Part 1: (\"Raiders of the BB Relics\")''' HouseGuests had to complete an obstacle course and then complete a 3-dimensional puzzle. After they completed the puzzle, they had to transfer twenty-five coins, one at a time, to the start of the course. Chen-Moonves gave the pre-jury a time to talk about different [[#Controversies and criticisms|controversies]] that happened in the House and gave the other HouseGuests a time to say what they wanted to say.

Once they found the number, they had to climb up a wall and place it with the picture. The HouseGuest to correctly fill the wall in the least amount of time won. Holly won with a time of 10:38; therefore, Nicole was automatically nominated.\n**'''Part 3: (\"The Jury is Out\")''' Holly and Michie had to watch a series of videos featuring jury members. The jury members made three statements about their time in the ''Big Brother'' House. Then, Holly and Michie had to guess which one was false. If they correctly guessed it, they got a point. The HouseGuest to get the most questions correct won the final part. Michie won with 8 points, automatically nominating Holly alongside Nicole.\nOn Day 99, by Michie's sole vote, Nicole was evicted from the House and became the ninth and final jury member. The jury, then joined by Nicole, questioned Michie and Holly as to why they should win.

The HouseGuests were told that the Camp Director would receive Immunity for the first week but would have to put the games of other HouseGuests in jeopardy. Michie was elected as Camp Director. He was tasked with \"banishing\" four HouseGuests, who would compete to stay in the house. Michie chose to banish Cliff, David, Jessica and Kemi. David lost the competition. As he was immune, Michie was ineligible to compete in the first Head of Household Competition.\n* {{note|2|Note 2}}: {{Color box|#87CEFA|border=darkgray}} On Day 15, ''Camp Comeback'' was introduced. David returned to the house from sequester and the next three evicted HouseGuests (Ovi, Kemi and Cliff) remained in the house after getting voted out of the game.

Christie's nomination did not require a replacement if the veto was used to save her.\n* {{note|4|Note 4}}: Week 9 was ''Prank Week'' and featured the ''America's Prankster'' power. America voted for Nick to be ''America's Prankster'' and took half of Holly's Head of Household power by anonymously nominating one HouseGuest at the Nomination Ceremony (denoted in '''bold''') and naming a replacement nominee if the Power of Veto is used on his nominee. Nick was not given immunity with his power and could be nominated by Holly.\n* {{note|5|Note 5}}: This week was a double eviction week.

It is generally accepted that ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' originated from other, more primitive organisms of the same genus ''[[Mycobacterium]]''. In 2014, results of a new DNA study of a tuberculosis genome reconstructed from remains in southern Peru suggest that human tuberculosis is less than 6,000 years old. Even if researchers theorise that humans first acquired it in Africa about 5,000 years ago,<ref name=\"nyt\"/> there is evidence that the first tuberculosis infection happened about 9,000 years ago.<ref name=\"Hershkovitz e3426\">{{Cite journal|title = Detection and Molecular Characterization of 9000-Year-Old Mycobacterium tuberculosis from a Neolithic Settlement in the Eastern Mediterranean|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2008-10-15|pmc = 2565837|pmid = 18923677|pages = e3426|volume = 3|issue = 10|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0003426|first = Israel|last = Hershkovitz|first2 = Helen D.|last2 = Donoghue|first3 = David E.|last3 = Minnikin|first4 = Gurdyal S.|last4 = Besra|first5 = Oona Y-C.|last5 = Lee|first6 = Angela M.|last6 = Gernaey|first7 = Ehud|last7 = Galili|first8 = Vered|last8 = Eshed|first9 = Charles L.|last9 = Greenblatt|bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.3426H}}</ref> It spread to other humans along trade routes. It also spread to domesticated animals in Africa, such as goats and cows. Seals and sea lions that bred on African beaches are believed to have acquired the disease and carried it across the Atlantic to South America. Hunters would have been the first humans to contract the disease there.<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\n==Origins==\nScientific work investigating the evolutionary origins of the ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' complex has concluded that the most recent common ancestor of the complex was a human-specific [[pathogen]], which underwent a [[population bottleneck]]. Analysis of mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units has allowed dating of the bottleneck to approximately 40,000 years ago, which corresponds to the period subsequent to the expansion of ''Homo sapiens sapiens'' out of Africa. This analysis of mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units also dated the ''Mycobacterium bovis'' lineage as dispersing approximately 6,000 years ago, which may be linked to animal domestication and early farming.<ref name=\"wirth\">{{cite journal |author1=Wirth T. |author2=Hildebrand F. | year = 2008 | title = Origin, spread and demography of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex | url = | journal = PLoS Pathog | volume = 4 | issue = 9| page = e1000160 | doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000160 | pmid=18802459 | pmc=2528947|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nHuman bones from the Neolithic show presence of the bacteria.

Scientists were able to recreate the genome of the bacteria from remains of 1,000-year-old skeletons in southern Peru. In dating the DNA, they found it was less than 6,000 years old. They also found it related most closely to a tuberculosis strain in seals, and have theorized that these animals were the mode of transmission from Africa to South America.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> The team from University of T\u00fcbingen believe that humans acquired the disease in Africa about 5,000 years ago.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> Their domesticated animals, such as goats and cows, contracted it from them. Seals acquired it when coming up on African beaches for breeding, and carried it across the Atlantic. In addition, TB spread via humans on the trade routes of the Old World. Other researchers have argued there is other evidence that suggests the tuberculosis bacteria is older than 6,000 years.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> This TB strain found in Peru is different from that prevalent today in the Americas, which is more closely related to a later Eurasian strain likely brought by European colonists.<ref name=\"NPR\">\"Sea Lions And Seals Likely Spread Tuberculosis To Ancient Peruvians\", National Public Radio, Aug 21, 2014 [https://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/08/21/341930621/sea-lions-and-seals-swam-tuberculosis-to-ancient-peruvians]</ref> However, this result is criticised by other experts from the field,<ref name=\"nyt\" /> for instance because there is evidence of the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 9000 year old skeletal remains.<ref name=\"Hershkovitz e3426\"/>\n\nAlthough relatively little is known about its frequency before the 19th century, its incidence is thought to have peaked between the end of the 18th century and the end of the 19th century. Over time, the various cultures of the world gave the illness different names: ''phthisis'' (Greek), ''consumptione'' (Latin), ''yaksma'' (India), and ''chaky oncay'' (Incan), each of which make reference to the \"drying\" or \"consuming\" effect of the illness, [[cachexia]].\n\nIn the 19th century, TB's high mortality rate among young and middle-aged adults and the surge of [[Romanticism]], which stressed feeling over reason, caused many to refer to the disease as the \"romantic disease\".\n\n==Tuberculosis in early civilization==\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | headerimage = [[File:Nofretete Neues Museum.jpg|210px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5grLXRuCQ1M Michael Carson ''Persistence of the White Plague, TB''], [[University of California, Irvine|UCI Open]], 50 minutes | accessdate =May 14, 2017 }}\nIn 2008, evidence for tuberculosis infection was discovered in human remains from the Neolithic era dating from 9,000 years ago, in [[Atlit Yam]], a settlement in the eastern Mediterranean.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Hershkovitz I. |author2=Donoghue H.

It is also caused by overworking one's mind and exhausting one's energy, injuring one's ''ch'i'' and loosening one's sperm\u2014all of which happen to common folk. When the original vitality is being [gradually] exhausted, the evil aura begins to be transmitted through the affected vital ''ch'i'' [of the sick body]. ... The aspects of the illness vary, and the causes of contamination are different. Rooms and food are capable of gradual contamination, and the clothes worn by the indisposed are twined easily with the infectious ''ch'i'' and these two become inseparable. ... The symptoms of the disease: When it begins, the sufferer coughs and pants; he spits blood [pulmonary hemorrhage]; he is emaciated and skinny; cold and fever affect him intermittently, and his dreams are morbid. This is the evidence that this person is suffering from the disease which is also known as ''wu-ch'uan'' \u5c4b\u50b3 [contagious disease contracted from a sick-room]. ... The disease may be contracted by a healthy person who happens to have slept in the same bed with the patient, or worn his clothes. After the death of the sufferer, the clothes, curtains, bed or couch, vessels and utensils used by him are known to have been contaminated by and saturated with the polluted ''ch'i'' in which the noxious ''ku'' \u8831 [parasites or germs] take their abode. Stingy people wish to keep them for further use, and the poorer families cannot afford to get rid of them and buy everything anew.

The Nine Worms generically meant \"bodily parasites; intestinal worms\" and were associated with the ''sanshi'' \u4e09\u5c38 \"[[Three Corpses]]\" or ''sanchong'' \u4e09\u87f2 \"Three Worms\", which were believed to be biospiritual parasites that live in the human body and seek to hasten their host's death. \nDaoist medical texts give different lists and descriptions of the Nine Worms. The ''Boji fang'' \u535a\u6fdf\u65b9 \"Prescriptions for Universal Dispensation\", collected by Wang Gun\u738b\u889e (fl. 1041), calls the supposed TB pathogen ''laochong'' \u7646\u87f2 \"tuberculosis worms\".<ref>Liu 1971: 200.</ref>\n\nThis ''Duanchu shizhai pin'' chapter (23/7b-8b) explains that the present Nine Worms does not refer to the intestinal ''weichong'' \u80c3\u87f2 \"stomach worms\", ''huichong'' \u86d4\u87f2 \"coiling worm; [[roundworm]]\", or ''cun baichong'' \u5bf8\u767d\u87f2 \"inch-long white worm; [[nematode]]\", and says the supposed six TB worms are \"six kinds\" of parasites, but the next chapter (24/20a-21b) says they are \"six stages/generations\" of reproduction.<ref>Liu 1971: 290.</ref> Daoist priests allegedly cured tuberculosis through drugs, acupuncture, and burning ''[[fulu]]'' \"supernatural talismans/charms\". Burning magic talismans would cause the TB patient to cough, which was considered an effective treatment.  \n<blockquote>To cure the disease, it is necessary to produce a spout of smoke by burning off thirty-six charms, and instruct the patient to inhale and to swallow up its fumes, whether he likes it or not. By the time all charms are used up, the smoke should also be dispersed. It may be difficult for the patient to bear the odour of the smoke at first, but once he gets used to such a smell, it does not really matter. Whenever the patient feels that there is phlegm in his throat, he is advised to cough and spit it out. If the patient is greatly affected by the symptoms, it will be good if his spittle is thick and if he can spit it out. When the patient is less affected by the wicked ''ch'i'', he does not have much phlegm to eject, but if he is deeply affected, he tends to vomit and to expectorate heavily until everything is cleared up, and then his illness is cured. When the wicked element is rooted out, it does not need to be fumigated any more [with charms].<ref>tr. Liu 1971: 289.</ref></blockquote>\nIn addition, Daoist healers would burn talismans in order to fumigate the clothes and belongings of the deceased, and would warn the family of the tuberculosis victim's family to throw away everything into a ''changliu shui'' \u9577\u6d41\u6c34 \"everflowing stream\".

Sickly individuals could petition the court for a royal touch and the touch would be performed at the King's earliest convenience. At times, the [[King of France]] would touch afflicted subjects during his royal walkabout. The rapid spread of tuberculosis across France and England, however, necessitated a more formal and efficient touching process.

Public-health physicians and politicians typically blamed both the poor themselves and their ramshackle tenement houses (conventillos) for the spread of the dreaded disease.  People ignored public-health campaigns to limit the spread of contagious diseases, such as the prohibition of spitting on the streets, the strict guidelines to care for infants and young children, and quarantines that separated families from ill loved ones.<ref>Diego Armus, ''The Ailing City: Health, Tuberculosis, and Culture in Buenos Aires, 1870\u20131950'' (2011)</ref>\n\n===Scientific advances===\nThough removed from the cultural movement, the scientific understanding advanced considerably. By the end of the 19th century, several major breakthroughs gave hope that a cause and cure might be found.\n\nOne of the most important physicians dedicated to the study of phthisiology was [[Ren\u00e9 Laennec]], who died from the disease at the age of 45, after contracting tuberculosis while studying contagious patients and infected bodies.<ref>Daniel 2000:60</ref> Laennec invented the [[stethoscope]]<ref name=\"Dan45\"/> which he used to corroborate his auscultatory findings and prove the correspondence between the pulmonary lesions found on the lungs of autopsied tuberculosis patients and the respiratory symptoms seen in living patients. His most important work was ''Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019Auscultation M\u00e9diate'' which detailed his discoveries on the utility of pulmonary auscultation in diagnosing tuberculosis. This book was promptly translated into English by [[John Forbes (physician)|John Forbes]] in 1821; it represents the beginning of the modern scientific understanding of tuberculosis.<ref name=\"Dan1864\"/> Laennec was named professional chair of [[H\u00f4pital Necker]] in September 1816 and today he is considered the greatest French clinician.<ref>Daniel 2000:44</ref><ref>Ackerknecht 1982:151</ref>\n\nLaennec's work put him in contact with the vanguard of the French medical establishment, including [[Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis]]. Louis would go on to use statistical methods to evaluate the different aspects of the disease's progression, the efficacy of various therapies and individuals' susceptibility, publishing an article in the ''Annales d'hygi\u00e8ne publique'' entitled \"Note on the Relative Frequency of Phthisis in the Two Sexes\".<ref>Barnes 1995:39</ref> Another good friend and co-worker of Laennec, [[Gaspard Laurent Bayle]], published an article in 1810 entitled ''Recherches sur la Pthisie Pulmonaire'', in which he divided pthisis into six types: tubercular phthisis, glandular phthisis, ulcerous phthisis, phthisis with melanosis, calculous phthisis, and cancerous phthisis. He based his findings on more than 900 autopsies.<ref name=\"Madkour 2004:20\"/><ref>Porter 2006:154</ref>\n\nIn 1869, [[Jean Antoine Villemin]] demonstrated that the disease was indeed contagious, conducting an experiment in which tuberculous matter from human cadavers was injected into laboratory rabbits, which then became infected.<ref>Barnes 1995:41</ref>\n\nOn 24 March 1882, Robert Koch revealed the disease was caused by an infectious agent.<ref name=\"Dan1864\"/> In 1895, [[Wilhelm Roentgen]] discovered the X-ray, which allowed physicians to diagnose and track the progression of the disease,<ref>Shorter 1991:88</ref> and although an effective medical treatment would not come for another fifty years, the incidence and mortality of tuberculosis began to decline.<ref>Aufderheide 1998:130</ref>\n\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n|colspan=\"4\"|19th-century tuberculosis mortality rate for New York and New Orleans<ref>Daniel 2004:159</ref>\n|\n|\n|----\n|\n|\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-bottom:1px solid black;\" align=\"center\"|Deaths/Year/1000 people\n|----\n|style=\"border-bottom:1px solid black;\"|Year\n|style=\"border-bottom:1px solid black;\"|Population\n|style=\"border-bottom:1px solid black;\"|Whites\n|style=\"border-bottom:1px solid black;\"|Blacks\n|----\n|1821\n|New York City\n|5.3\n|9.6\n|----\n|1830\n|New York City\n|4.4\n|12.0\n|----\n|1844\n|New York City\n|3.6\n|8.2\n|----\n|1849\n|New Orleans\n|4.9\n|5.2\n|----\n|1855\n|New York City\n|3.1\n|12.0\n|----\n|1860\n|New York City\n|2.4\n|6.7\n|----\n|1865\n|New York City\n|2.8\n|6.7\n|----\n|1880\n|New Orleans\n|3.3\n|6.0\n|----\n|1890\n|New Orleans\n|2.5\n|5.9\n|----\n|}\n\n===Robert Koch===\n[[File:RobertKoch cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Robert Koch]], a [[Prussian]] physician, discovered the cause of tuberculosis.]]\nVillemin's experiments had confirmed the contagious nature of the disease and had forced the medical community to accept that tuberculosis was indeed an infectious disease, transmitted by some etiological agent of unknown origin. In 1882, Prussian physician [[Robert Koch]] utilized a new staining method and applied it to the sputum of tuberculosis patients, revealing for the first time the causal agent of the disease: ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'', or Koch's bacillus.<ref>Brock ''Robert Koch'' 1999:120</ref>\n\nWhen he began his investigation, Koch knew of the work of Villemin and others who had continued his experiments like Julius Conheim and Carl Salmosen. He also had access to the \"pthisis ward\" at the Berlin Charit\u00e9 Hospital.<ref>Brock ''Robert Koch'' 1999:118</ref> Before he confronted the problem of tuberculosis, he worked with the disease caused by anthrax and had discovered the causal agent to be ''Bacillus anthracis''. During this investigation he became friends with Ferdinand Cohn, the director of the Institute of Vegetable Physiology. Together they worked to develop methods of culturing tissue samples. 18 August 1881, while staining tuberculous material with [[methylene blue]], he noticed oblong structures, though he was not able to ascertain whether it was just a result of the coloring. To improve the contrast, he decide to add [[Bismarck brown Y|Bismarck Brown]], after which the oblong structures were rendered bright and transparent. He improved the technique by varying the concentration of alkali in the staining solution until the ideal viewing conditions for the bacilli was achieved.\n\nAfter numerous attempts he was able to incubate the bacteria in [[coagulated blood serum]] at 37 degrees Celsius. He then inoculated laboratory rabbits with the bacteria and observed that they died while exhibiting symptoms of tuberculosis, proving that the bacillus, which he named ''tuberculosis bacillus'', was in fact the cause of tuberculosis.<ref name=\"Ati\">Koch 1882</ref>\n\nHe made his result public at the [[Physiological Society of Berlin]] on 24 March 1882, in a famous lecture entitled ''\u00dcber Tuberculose'', which was published three weeks later. Since 1882, 24 March has been known as [[World Tuberculosis Day]].<ref>Yancey 2007:1982</ref>\n\nOn 20 April 1882, Koch presented an article entitled ''Die \u00c4tiologie der Tuberculose'' in which he demonstrated that ''Mycobacterium'' was the single cause of tuberculosis in all of its forms.<ref name=\"Ati\"/>\n\nIn 1890 Koch developed tuberculin, a purified protein derivative of the bacteria.<ref>Magner 2002:273</ref> It proved to be an ineffective means of immunization but in 1908, [[Charles Mantoux]] found it was an effective intradermic test for diagnosing tuberculosis.<ref>Madkour 2004:49</ref>\n\n{{quote|If the importance of a disease for mankind is measured from the number of fatalities which are due to it, then tuberculosis must be considered much more important than those most feared infectious diseases, plague, cholera, and the like.

In this paper, he proposed a dietary, rest, and medical care program for a hospital he planned to found in [[Maney]].<ref>Bodington 1840</ref> Attacks from numerous medical experts, especially articles in ''The Lancet'', disheartened Bodington and he turned to plans for housing the insane.<ref>Dubos 1987:177</ref>\n\nAround the same time in the United States, in late October and early November 1842, Dr. [[John Croghan]], the owner of [[Mammoth Cave]], brought 15 tuberculosis sufferers into the cave in the hope of curing the disease with the constant temperature and purity of the cave air.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2004/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/02/26/mammoth.cave.ap/index.html Kentucky: Mammoth Cave long on history.] ''[[CNN]]''. 27 February 2004.

H. P. Anderson}}\n\nBy late January, early February 1843, two patients were dead and the rest had left. Departing patients died anywhere from three days to three weeks after resurfacing; John Croghan died of tuberculosis at his [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] residence in 1849.<ref>Billings, Hillman, and Regen 1957:14</ref>\n\n[[Hermann Brehmer]], a German physician, was convinced that tuberculosis arose from the difficulty of the heart to correctly irrigate the lungs. He therefore proposed that regions well above sea level, where the atmospheric pressure was less, would help the heart function more effectively. With the encouragement of explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and his teacher [[Johann Lukas Sch\u00f6nlein|J. L. Sch\u00f6nlein]], the first anti-tuberculosis sanatorium was established in 1854, 650 meters above sea level, at G\u00f6rbersdorf.<ref>Dubos 1987:175\u2013176</ref> Three years later he published his findings in a paper ''Die chronische Lungenschwindsucht und Tuberkulose der Lunge: Ihre Ursache und ihre Heilung''.\n\nBrehmer and one of his patients, [[Peter Dettweiler]], became proponents for the sanatorium movement, and by 1877, sanatoriums began to spread beyond Germany and throughout Europe. Dr. [[Edward Livingston Trudeau]] subsequently founded the [[Adirondack Cottage Sanitorium]] in [[Saranac Lake, New York]] in 1884. One of Trudeau's early patients was author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]; his fame helped establish Saranac Lake as a center for the treatment of tuberculosis. In 1894, after a fire destroyed Trudeau's small home laboratory, he organized the Saranac Laboratory for the Study of Tuberculosis; renamed the [[Trudeau Institute]], the laboratory continues to study infectious diseases.<ref>Donaldson, Alfred L., ''A History of the Adirondacks'', Century Co., New York 1921 (reprinted by Purple Mountain Press, Fleischmanns, NY, 1992), pp. 243\u2013265</ref>\n\nPeter Dettweiler went on to found his own sanatorium at [[Falkenstein, K\u00f6nigstein im Taunus|Falkenstein]] in 1877 and in 1886 published findings claiming that 132 of his 1022 patients had been completely cured after staying at his institution.<ref>Graham 1893:266</ref> Eventually, sanatoriums began to appear near large cities and at low altitudes, like the [[Sharon Sanatorium]] in 1890 near Boston.<ref name=\"Shr47\">Shryock 1977:47</ref>\n\nSanatoriums were not the only treatment facilities. Specialized tuberculosis clinics began to develop in major metropolitan areas. Sir Robert Philip established the [[Royal Victoria Dispensary for Consumption]] in [[Edinburgh]] in 1887. [[dispensary|Dispensaries]] acted as special sanatoriums for early tuberculosis cases and were opened to lower income individuals. The use of dispensaries to treat middle and lower-class individuals in major metropolitan areas and the coordination between various levels of health services programs like hospitals, sanatoriums, and tuberculosis colonies became known as the \"Edinburgh Anti-tuberculosis Scheme\".<ref>\"The Edinburgh Scheme\" 1914:117</ref>\n\n==Twentieth century==\n\n===Containment===\n[[File:Map of the City of Washington Showing Location of Fatal Cases of Consumption.jpg|thumb|A map of deaths from tuberculosis in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1900\u20131901.]]\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, tuberculosis was one of the UK's most urgent health problems. A royal commission was set up in 1901, The Royal Commission Appointed to Inquire into the Relations of Human and Animal Tuberculosis. Its remit was to find out whether tuberculosis in animals and humans was the same disease, and whether animals and humans could infect each other. By 1919, the Commission had evolved into the UK's Medical Research Council.\n\nIn 1902, the International Conference on Tuberculosis convened in Berlin. Among various other acts, the conference proposed the [[Cross of Lorraine]] be the international symbol of the fight against tuberculosis. National campaigns spread across Europe and the United States to tamp down on the continued prevalence of tuberculosis.\n\nAfter the establishment in the 1880s that the disease was contagious, TB was made a [[notifiable disease]] in Britain; there were campaigns to stop spitting in public places, and the infected poor were pressured to enter sanatoria that resembled prisons; the sanatoria for the middle and upper classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention.<ref name =sanatoria>McCarthy 2001:413-7</ref> Whatever the purported benefits of the fresh air and labor in the sanatoria, even under the best conditions, 50% of those who entered were dead within five years (1916).<ref name=sanatoria/>\n\nThe promotion of [[Christmas Seals]] began in Denmark during 1904 as a way to raise money for tuberculosis programs. It expanded to the United States and Canada in 1907\u20131908 to help the [[National Tuberculosis Association]] (later called the [[American Lung Association]]).\n\nIn the United States, concern about the spread of tuberculosis played a role in the movement to prohibit public spitting except into [[spittoon]]s.\n\n===Vaccines===\nThe first genuine success in immunizing against tuberculosis was developed from attenuated bovine-strain tuberculosis by [[Albert Calmette]] and [[Camille Gu\u00e9rin]] in 1906. It was called \"BCG\" (''[[Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin|Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin]]''). The BCG vaccine was first used on humans in 1921 in France,<ref>Bonah 2005:696\u2013721</ref> but it was not until after World War II that BCG received widespread acceptance in Great Britain, and Germany.<ref>Comstock 1994:528-40</ref> In the early days of the British [[National Health Service]] X-ray examination for TB increased dramatically but rates of vaccination were initially very low. In 1953 it was agreed that secondary school pupils should be vaccinated, but by the end of 1954 only 250,000 people had been vaccinated. By 1956 this had risen to 600,000, about half being school children.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Webster|first1=Charles|title=The Health Services Since the War|date=1988|publisher=HMSO|location=London|isbn=978-0116309426|page=323}}</ref>\n\nIn Italy for some decades the Italian competitor of the French tubercular vaccine [[BCG vaccine]].was the [[Salvioli's diffusing vaccine]]  (acronym 'VDS from its Italian name {{lang|it| Vaccino Diffondente Salvioli}})  used from 1948 until 1976. It was prepared by professor Gaetano Salvioli (1894\u20131982) of the [[University of Bologna]].\n\n===Treatments===\n[[File:Tuberculosis in the USA 1861-2014.png|alt= Tuberculosis mortality in the USA from 1861 to 2014.|thumb|Tuberculosis mortality in the USA from 1861 to 2014.]]\n\nAs the century progressed, some surgical interventions, including the [[pneumothorax]] or [[plombage]] technique\u2014collapsing an infected lung to \"rest\" it and allow the lesions to heal\u2014were used to treat tuberculosis.<ref>Wolfart 1990:506\u201311</ref> Pneumothorax was not a new technique by any means. In 1696, [[Giorgio Baglivi]] reported a general improvement in tuberculosis sufferers after they received sword wounds to the chest. [[F.H. Ramadge]] induced the first successful therapeutic pneumothorax in 1834, and reported subsequently the patient was cured. It was in the 20th century, however, that scientists sought to rigorously investigate the effectiveness of such procedures. In 1939, the ''[[British Journal of Tuberculosis]]'' published a study by [[Oli Hjaltested]] and [[Kjeld T\u00f6rning]] on 191 patients undergoing the procedure between 1925 and 1931; in 1951, Roger Mitchell published several articles on the therapeutic outcomes of 557 patients treated between 1930 and 1939 at [[Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium|Trudeau Sanatorium]] in [[Saranac Lake, New York|Saranac Lake]].<ref>Daniel 2006:1866</ref> The search for a medicinal cure, however, continued in earnest.\n\nDuring the [[Nazi occupation of Poland]], [[SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]] [[Wilhelm Koppe]] organized the execution of more than 30,000 Polish patients suffering from tuberculosis \u2013 little knowing or caring that a cure was nearly at hand.\n\nIn 1944 [[Albert Schatz (scientist)|Albert Schatz]], [[Elizabeth Bugie]], and [[Selman Waksman]] isolated [[streptomycin]] produced by a bacterial strain ''[[Streptomyces griseus]].''

Analysis of mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units has allowed dating of the bottleneck to approximately 40,000 years ago, which corresponds to the period subsequent to the expansion of ''Homo sapiens sapiens'' out of Africa. This analysis of mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units also dated the ''Mycobacterium bovis'' lineage as dispersing approximately 6,000 years ago, which may be linked to animal domestication and early farming.<ref name=\"wirth\">{{cite journal |author1=Wirth T. |author2=Hildebrand F. | year = 2008 | title = Origin, spread and demography of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex | url = | journal = PLoS Pathog | volume = 4 | issue = 9| page = e1000160 | doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000160 | pmid=18802459 | pmc=2528947|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nHuman bones from the Neolithic show presence of the bacteria.

Scientists were able to recreate the genome of the bacteria from remains of 1,000-year-old skeletons in southern Peru. In dating the DNA, they found it was less than 6,000 years old. They also found it related most closely to a tuberculosis strain in seals, and have theorized that these animals were the mode of transmission from Africa to South America.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> The team from University of T\u00fcbingen believe that humans acquired the disease in Africa about 5,000 years ago.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> Their domesticated animals, such as goats and cows, contracted it from them. Seals acquired it when coming up on African beaches for breeding, and carried it across the Atlantic. In addition, TB spread via humans on the trade routes of the Old World. Other researchers have argued there is other evidence that suggests the tuberculosis bacteria is older than 6,000 years.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> This TB strain found in Peru is different from that prevalent today in the Americas, which is more closely related to a later Eurasian strain likely brought by European colonists.<ref name=\"NPR\">\"Sea Lions And Seals Likely Spread Tuberculosis To Ancient Peruvians\", National Public Radio, Aug 21, 2014 [https://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/08/21/341930621/sea-lions-and-seals-swam-tuberculosis-to-ancient-peruvians]</ref> However, this result is criticised by other experts from the field,<ref name=\"nyt\" /> for instance because there is evidence of the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 9000 year old skeletal remains.<ref name=\"Hershkovitz e3426\"/>\n\nAlthough relatively little is known about its frequency before the 19th century, its incidence is thought to have peaked between the end of the 18th century and the end of the 19th century.

Liu 1971: 287.</ref> was caused by a specific parasite or pathogen, centuries earlier than their contemporaries in other countries. The ''Duanchu shizhai pin'' \u65b7\u9664\u5c38\u7635\u54c1 \"On the Extermination of the Corpse Disease\" is the 23rd chapter in Daoist collection ''Wushang xuanyuan santian Yutang dafa'' \u7121\u4e0a\u7384\u5143\u4e09\u5929\u7389\u5802\u5927\u6cd5 \"Great Rites of the Jade Hall of the Three Heavens of the Supreme Mysterious Origins\" (''[[Daozang]]'' number 103). The text has a preface dated 1126, written by the Song dynasty [[Zhengyi Dao]] master Lu Shizhong \u8def\u6642\u4e2d, who founded the Yutang dafa \u7389\u5802\u5927\u6cd5 tradition, but internal evidence reveals that the text could not have been written before 1158.<ref>Liu 1971: 287\u20138.</ref>\n<blockquote>The disaster of the contagious disease, which changes a living being into a corpse, is caused by the infectious [nature] of the nine [kinds of] parasites (''ch'ung'' \u87f2). It is also caused by overworking one's mind and exhausting one's energy, injuring one's ''ch'i'' and loosening one's sperm\u2014all of which happen to common folk. When the original vitality is being [gradually] exhausted, the evil aura begins to be transmitted through the affected vital ''ch'i'' [of the sick body]. ... The aspects of the illness vary, and the causes of contamination are different. Rooms and food are capable of gradual contamination, and the clothes worn by the indisposed are twined easily with the infectious ''ch'i'' and these two become inseparable. ... The symptoms of the disease: When it begins, the sufferer coughs and pants; he spits blood [pulmonary hemorrhage]; he is emaciated and skinny; cold and fever affect him intermittently, and his dreams are morbid. This is the evidence that this person is suffering from the disease which is also known as ''wu-ch'uan'' \u5c4b\u50b3 [contagious disease contracted from a sick-room]. ... The disease may be contracted by a healthy person who happens to have slept in the same bed with the patient, or worn his clothes. After the death of the sufferer, the clothes, curtains, bed or couch, vessels and utensils used by him are known to have been contaminated by and saturated with the polluted ''ch'i'' in which the noxious ''ku'' \u8831 [parasites or germs] take their abode. Stingy people wish to keep them for further use, and the poorer families cannot afford to get rid of them and buy everything anew. Isn't this lamentable, since it creates the cause of the great misfortune yet to come!<ref>23/1a-b, tr. Liu 1971: 288.</ref></blockquote>\nThis passage refers to the cause of TB in ancient medical terminology of ''jiuchong'' \u4e5d\u87f2 \"Nine Worms\" and ''[[Gu (poison)|gu]]'' \u8831 \"supernatural agents causing disease\", and ''[[qi]]''.  The Nine Worms generically meant \"bodily parasites; intestinal worms\" and were associated with the ''sanshi'' \u4e09\u5c38 \"[[Three Corpses]]\" or ''sanchong'' \u4e09\u87f2 \"Three Worms\", which were believed to be biospiritual parasites that live in the human body and seek to hasten their host's death. \nDaoist medical texts give different lists and descriptions of the Nine Worms. The ''Boji fang'' \u535a\u6fdf\u65b9 \"Prescriptions for Universal Dispensation\", collected by Wang Gun\u738b\u889e (fl. 1041), calls the supposed TB pathogen ''laochong'' \u7646\u87f2 \"tuberculosis worms\".<ref>Liu 1971: 200.</ref>\n\nThis ''Duanchu shizhai pin'' chapter (23/7b-8b) explains that the present Nine Worms does not refer to the intestinal ''weichong'' \u80c3\u87f2 \"stomach worms\", ''huichong'' \u86d4\u87f2 \"coiling worm; [[roundworm]]\", or ''cun baichong'' \u5bf8\u767d\u87f2 \"inch-long white worm; [[nematode]]\", and says the supposed six TB worms are \"six kinds\" of parasites, but the next chapter (24/20a-21b) says they are \"six stages/generations\" of reproduction.<ref>Liu 1971: 290.</ref> Daoist priests allegedly cured tuberculosis through drugs, acupuncture, and burning ''[[fulu]]'' \"supernatural talismans/charms\". Burning magic talismans would cause the TB patient to cough, which was considered an effective treatment.  \n<blockquote>To cure the disease, it is necessary to produce a spout of smoke by burning off thirty-six charms, and instruct the patient to inhale and to swallow up its fumes, whether he likes it or not. By the time all charms are used up, the smoke should also be dispersed. It may be difficult for the patient to bear the odour of the smoke at first, but once he gets used to such a smell, it does not really matter. Whenever the patient feels that there is phlegm in his throat, he is advised to cough and spit it out. If the patient is greatly affected by the symptoms, it will be good if his spittle is thick and if he can spit it out. When the patient is less affected by the wicked ''ch'i'', he does not have much phlegm to eject, but if he is deeply affected, he tends to vomit and to expectorate heavily until everything is cleared up, and then his illness is cured. When the wicked element is rooted out, it does not need to be fumigated any more [with charms].<ref>tr. Liu 1971: 289.</ref></blockquote>\nIn addition, Daoist healers would burn talismans in order to fumigate the clothes and belongings of the deceased, and would warn the family of the tuberculosis victim's family to throw away everything into a ''changliu shui'' \u9577\u6d41\u6c34 \"everflowing stream\".

A document from the 12th century recorded an explanation of the cause of illness. The pagans said that tuberculosis was produced when a dog-shaped demon occupied the person's body and started to eat his lungs. When the possessed person coughed, then the demon was barking, and getting close to his objective, which was to kill the victim.<ref>Radloff: \"Bussgebete\" stb. 874. 1 jegyzet.</ref>\n\n===Royal touch===\n[[File:Henri IV touche les escrouelles.jpg|thumb|Henry IV of France touching numerous sickly individuals during the ceremony of the \"royal touch\". The original caption reads: ''Des mirabili strumas sanandi vi solis Galliae regibus christianissimis divinitus concessa liber unus''.]]\n{{main|Royal touch}}\nWith the spread of Christianity, monarchs were seen as religious figures with magical or curative powers. It was believed that [[royal touch]], the touch of the [[sovereign]] of England or France, could cure diseases due to the [[divine right of kings|divine right of sovereigns]].<ref name=\"Mau87\">Maulitz and Maulitz 1973:87</ref> King [[Henry IV of France]] usually performed the rite once a week, after taking communion.<ref name=\"Dang231\">Dang 2001:231</ref> So common was this practice of royal healing in France, that [[scrofula]] became known as the \"''mal du roi''\" or the \"King's Evil\".\n\nInitially, the touching ceremony was an informal process. Sickly individuals could petition the court for a royal touch and the touch would be performed at the King's earliest convenience. At times, the [[King of France]] would touch afflicted subjects during his royal walkabout. The rapid spread of tuberculosis across France and England, however, necessitated a more formal and efficient touching process. By the time of [[Louis XIV of France]], placards indicating the days and times the King would be available for royal touches were posted regularly; sums of money were doled out as charitable support.<ref name=\"Dang231\"/><ref name=\"Auf129\">Aufderheide 1998:129</ref> In England, the process was extremely formal and efficient. As late as 1633, the [[Book of Common Prayer]] of the [[Anglican Church]] contained a Royal Touch ceremony.<ref>{{cite news | last = Mitchinson | first = John |author2=Molly Oldfield | title = QI: Quite Interesting facts about Kings | work = Telegraph.co.uk | date = 9 January 2009 | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/qi/4176490/QI-Quite-interesting-facts-about-Kings.html | accessdate = 23 December 2009}}</ref> The [[monarch]] (king or queen), sitting upon a canopied throne, touched the afflicted individual, and presented that individual with a [[coin]] \u2013 usually an [[Angel (coin)|Angel]], a gold coin the value of which varied from about 6 [[shillings]] to about 10 shillings \u2013 by pressing it against the afflicted's neck.<ref name=\"Dang231\"/>\n\nAlthough the ceremony was of no medical value, members of the royal courts often propagandized that those receiving the royal touch were miraculously healed. [[Andr\u00e9 du Laurens]], the senior physician of Henry IV, publicized findings that at least half of those that received the royal touch were cured within a few days.<ref>Gosman 2004:140</ref> The royal touch remained popular into the 18th century. Parish registers from [[Oxfordshire]], England include not only records of baptisms, marriages, and deaths, but also records of those eligible for the royal touch.<ref name=\"Mau87\"/>\n\n===Contagion===\n[[Girolamo Fracastoro]] became the first person to propose, in his work ''De contagione'', that phthisis was transmitted by an invisible ''virus''. Among his assertions were that the ''virus'' could survive between ''two or three years'' on the clothes of those suffering from the disease and that it was usually transmitted through direct contact or the discharged fluids of the infected, what he called ''fomes''. He noted that phthisis could be contracted without either direct contact or fomes, but was unsure of the process by which the disease propagated across distances.<ref>Brock ''Milestones'' 1999:72</ref>\n\n===Paracelsus's tartaric process===\n[[Paracelsus]] advanced the belief that tuberculosis was caused by a failure of an internal organ to accomplish its alchemical duties. When this occurred in the lungs, stony precipitates would develop causing tuberculosis in what he called the ''tartaric'' process.<ref>Debus 2001:13</ref>\n\n==Seventeenth and eighteenth centuries==\n[[Franciscus Sylvius]] began differentiating between the various forms of tuberculosis (pulmonary, ganglion). He was the first person to recognize that the skin ulcers caused by scrofula resembled tubercles seen in phthisis,<ref name=\"anc549\">Ancell 1852:549</ref> noting that \"phthisis is the scrofula of the lung\" in his book ''Opera Medica'', published posthumously in 1679. Around the same time, [[Thomas Willis]] concluded that all diseases of the chest must ultimately lead to consumption.<ref>Waksman 1964:34</ref> Willis did not know the exact cause of the disease but he blamed it on sugar<ref>Macinnis 2002:165</ref> or an acidity of the blood.<ref name=\"anc549\"/> [[Richard Morton (physician)|Richard Morton]] published ''Phthisiologia, seu exercitationes de Phthisi tribus libris comprehensae'' in 1689, in which he emphasized the tubercle as the true cause of the disease. So common was the disease at the time that Morton is quoted as saying \"I cannot sufficiently admire that anyone, at least after he comes to the flower of his youth, can [sic] dye without a touch of consumption.\"<ref>Otis 1920:28</ref>\n\nIn 1720, [[Benjamin Marten]] proposed in ''A New Theory of Consumptions more Especially of Phthisis or Consumption of the Lungs'' that the cause of tuberculosis was some type of ''animalcula''\u2014microscopic living beings that are able to survive in a new body (similar to the ones described by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] in 1695).<ref>Daniel 2000:8</ref> The theory was roundly rejected and it took another 162 years before Robert Koch demonstrated it to be true.\n\nIn 1768, [[Robert Whytt]] gave the first clinical description of tuberculosis meningitis<ref>Whytt 1768:46</ref> and in 1779, [[Percivall Pott]], an English surgeon, described the vertebral lesions that carry his name.<ref name=\"Auf129\"/> In 1761, [[Leopold Auenbrugger]], an Austrian physician, developed the percussion method of diagnosing tuberculosis,<ref name=\"Dan45\">Daniel 2000:45</ref> a method rediscovered some years later in 1797 by [[Jean-Nicolas Corvisart]] of France. After finding it useful, Corvisart made it readily available to the academic community by translating it into French.<ref>Dubos 1987:79</ref>\n\n[[William Stark (physician)|William Stark]] proposed that ordinary lung tubercles could eventually evolve into ulcers and cavities, believing that the different forms of tuberculosis were simply different manifestations of the same disease. Unfortunately, Stark died at the age of thirty (while studying [[scurvy]]) and his observations were discounted.<ref>Dubos 1987:83</ref> In his ''Systematik de speziellen Pathologie und Therapie'', [[Johann Lukas Sch\u00f6nlein|J.

The consumption deaths in the village of Holycross in [[Shropshire]] between 1750 and 1759 were one in six (1:6); ten years later, 1:3. In the metropolis of London, 1:7 died from consumption at the dawn of the 18th century, by 1750 that proportion grew to 1:5.25 and surged to 1:4.2 by around the start of the 19th century.<ref>Chalke 1959:93</ref> The [[Industrial Revolution]] coupled with poverty and squalor created the optimal environment for the propagation of the disease.\n\n==Nineteenth century==\n\n===A romantic disease===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85&nbsp;%%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25&nbsp;%%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"Chopin coughs with infinite grace.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" | \u2014[[George Sand]] in a letter to Madame d'Agoult\n|}\n\n[[File:Anton Pavlovich Chekhov.jpg|left|thumb|150px|The [[Russians|Russian]] writer [[Anton Chekhov]], who died of tuberculosis  in 1904]]\n\nIt was during this century that tuberculosis was dubbed the White Plague,<ref name=\"Madkour 2004:20\">Madkour 2004:20</ref> ''mal de vivre'', and ''mal du si\u00e8cle''. It was seen as a \"romantic disease\". Suffering from tuberculosis was thought to bestow upon the sufferer heightened sensitivity. The slow progress of the disease allowed for a \"good death\" as sufferers could arrange their affairs.<ref>Bourdelais 2006:15</ref> The disease began to represent spiritual purity and temporal wealth, leading many young, upper-class women to purposefully pale their skin to achieve the consumptive appearance. British poet [[Lord Byron]] wrote, \"I should like to die from consumption\", helping to popularize the disease as the disease of artists.<ref>Yancey 2007:18</ref> [[George Sand]] doted on her phthisic lover, [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]], calling him her \"poor melancholy angel\".<ref name=\"Dan1864\">Daniel 2006:1864</ref>\n\nIn France, at least five novels were published expressing the ideals of tuberculosis: Dumas's ''[[La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias]]'', Murger's ''[[Sc\u00e8nes de la vie de Boh\u00e8me]]'', Hugo's ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'', the [[Goncourt brothers]]' ''Madame Gervaisais'' and ''Germinie Lacerteux'', and Rostand's ''[[L'Aiglon]]''. The portrayals by Dumas and Murger in turn inspired operatic depictions of consumption in Verdi's ''[[La traviata]]'' and Puccini's ''[[La boh\u00e8me]]''.  Even after medical knowledge of the disease had accumulated, the redemptive-spiritual perspective of the disease has remained popular<ref>Barnes 1995:51</ref> (as seen in the 2001 film [[Moulin Rouge!|''Moulin Rouge'']] based in part on ''La traviata'' and the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|musical adaptations]] of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'').\n\nIn large cities the poor had high rates of tuberculosis.  Public-health physicians and politicians typically blamed both the poor themselves and their ramshackle tenement houses (conventillos) for the spread of the dreaded disease.  People ignored public-health campaigns to limit the spread of contagious diseases, such as the prohibition of spitting on the streets, the strict guidelines to care for infants and young children, and quarantines that separated families from ill loved ones.<ref>Diego Armus, ''The Ailing City: Health, Tuberculosis, and Culture in Buenos Aires, 1870\u20131950'' (2011)</ref>\n\n===Scientific advances===\nThough removed from the cultural movement, the scientific understanding advanced considerably. By the end of the 19th century, several major breakthroughs gave hope that a cause and cure might be found.\n\nOne of the most important physicians dedicated to the study of phthisiology was [[Ren\u00e9 Laennec]], who died from the disease at the age of 45, after contracting tuberculosis while studying contagious patients and infected bodies.<ref>Daniel 2000:60</ref> Laennec invented the [[stethoscope]]<ref name=\"Dan45\"/> which he used to corroborate his auscultatory findings and prove the correspondence between the pulmonary lesions found on the lungs of autopsied tuberculosis patients and the respiratory symptoms seen in living patients. His most important work was ''Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019Auscultation M\u00e9diate'' which detailed his discoveries on the utility of pulmonary auscultation in diagnosing tuberculosis.

In 1882, Prussian physician [[Robert Koch]] utilized a new staining method and applied it to the sputum of tuberculosis patients, revealing for the first time the causal agent of the disease: ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'', or Koch's bacillus.<ref>Brock ''Robert Koch'' 1999:120</ref>\n\nWhen he began his investigation, Koch knew of the work of Villemin and others who had continued his experiments like Julius Conheim and Carl Salmosen. He also had access to the \"pthisis ward\" at the Berlin Charit\u00e9 Hospital.<ref>Brock ''Robert Koch'' 1999:118</ref> Before he confronted the problem of tuberculosis, he worked with the disease caused by anthrax and had discovered the causal agent to be ''Bacillus anthracis''. During this investigation he became friends with Ferdinand Cohn, the director of the Institute of Vegetable Physiology. Together they worked to develop methods of culturing tissue samples. 18 August 1881, while staining tuberculous material with [[methylene blue]], he noticed oblong structures, though he was not able to ascertain whether it was just a result of the coloring. To improve the contrast, he decide to add [[Bismarck brown Y|Bismarck Brown]], after which the oblong structures were rendered bright and transparent. He improved the technique by varying the concentration of alkali in the staining solution until the ideal viewing conditions for the bacilli was achieved.\n\nAfter numerous attempts he was able to incubate the bacteria in [[coagulated blood serum]] at 37 degrees Celsius. He then inoculated laboratory rabbits with the bacteria and observed that they died while exhibiting symptoms of tuberculosis, proving that the bacillus, which he named ''tuberculosis bacillus'', was in fact the cause of tuberculosis.<ref name=\"Ati\">Koch 1882</ref>\n\nHe made his result public at the [[Physiological Society of Berlin]] on 24 March 1882, in a famous lecture entitled ''\u00dcber Tuberculose'', which was published three weeks later. Since 1882, 24 March has been known as [[World Tuberculosis Day]].<ref>Yancey 2007:1982</ref>\n\nOn 20 April 1882, Koch presented an article entitled ''Die \u00c4tiologie der Tuberculose'' in which he demonstrated that ''Mycobacterium'' was the single cause of tuberculosis in all of its forms.<ref name=\"Ati\"/>\n\nIn 1890 Koch developed tuberculin, a purified protein derivative of the bacteria.<ref>Magner 2002:273</ref> It proved to be an ineffective means of immunization but in 1908, [[Charles Mantoux]] found it was an effective intradermic test for diagnosing tuberculosis.<ref>Madkour 2004:49</ref>\n\n{{quote|If the importance of a disease for mankind is measured from the number of fatalities which are due to it, then tuberculosis must be considered much more important than those most feared infectious diseases, plague, cholera, and the like.

In this paper, he proposed a dietary, rest, and medical care program for a hospital he planned to found in [[Maney]].<ref>Bodington 1840</ref> Attacks from numerous medical experts, especially articles in ''The Lancet'', disheartened Bodington and he turned to plans for housing the insane.<ref>Dubos 1987:177</ref>\n\nAround the same time in the United States, in late October and early November 1842, Dr. [[John Croghan]], the owner of [[Mammoth Cave]], brought 15 tuberculosis sufferers into the cave in the hope of curing the disease with the constant temperature and purity of the cave air.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2004/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/02/26/mammoth.cave.ap/index.html Kentucky: Mammoth Cave long on history.] ''[[CNN]]''. 27 February 2004.

H. P. Anderson}}\n\nBy late January, early February 1843, two patients were dead and the rest had left. Departing patients died anywhere from three days to three weeks after resurfacing; John Croghan died of tuberculosis at his [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] residence in 1849.<ref>Billings, Hillman, and Regen 1957:14</ref>\n\n[[Hermann Brehmer]], a German physician, was convinced that tuberculosis arose from the difficulty of the heart to correctly irrigate the lungs. He therefore proposed that regions well above sea level, where the atmospheric pressure was less, would help the heart function more effectively. With the encouragement of explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and his teacher [[Johann Lukas Sch\u00f6nlein|J. L. Sch\u00f6nlein]], the first anti-tuberculosis sanatorium was established in 1854, 650 meters above sea level, at G\u00f6rbersdorf.<ref>Dubos 1987:175\u2013176</ref> Three years later he published his findings in a paper ''Die chronische Lungenschwindsucht und Tuberkulose der Lunge: Ihre Ursache und ihre Heilung''.\n\nBrehmer and one of his patients, [[Peter Dettweiler]], became proponents for the sanatorium movement, and by 1877, sanatoriums began to spread beyond Germany and throughout Europe. Dr. [[Edward Livingston Trudeau]] subsequently founded the [[Adirondack Cottage Sanitorium]] in [[Saranac Lake, New York]] in 1884. One of Trudeau's early patients was author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]; his fame helped establish Saranac Lake as a center for the treatment of tuberculosis. In 1894, after a fire destroyed Trudeau's small home laboratory, he organized the Saranac Laboratory for the Study of Tuberculosis; renamed the [[Trudeau Institute]], the laboratory continues to study infectious diseases.<ref>Donaldson, Alfred L., ''A History of the Adirondacks'', Century Co., New York 1921 (reprinted by Purple Mountain Press, Fleischmanns, NY, 1992), pp. 243\u2013265</ref>\n\nPeter Dettweiler went on to found his own sanatorium at [[Falkenstein, K\u00f6nigstein im Taunus|Falkenstein]] in 1877 and in 1886 published findings claiming that 132 of his 1022 patients had been completely cured after staying at his institution.<ref>Graham 1893:266</ref> Eventually, sanatoriums began to appear near large cities and at low altitudes, like the [[Sharon Sanatorium]] in 1890 near Boston.<ref name=\"Shr47\">Shryock 1977:47</ref>\n\nSanatoriums were not the only treatment facilities. Specialized tuberculosis clinics began to develop in major metropolitan areas. Sir Robert Philip established the [[Royal Victoria Dispensary for Consumption]] in [[Edinburgh]] in 1887. [[dispensary|Dispensaries]] acted as special sanatoriums for early tuberculosis cases and were opened to lower income individuals. The use of dispensaries to treat middle and lower-class individuals in major metropolitan areas and the coordination between various levels of health services programs like hospitals, sanatoriums, and tuberculosis colonies became known as the \"Edinburgh Anti-tuberculosis Scheme\".<ref>\"The Edinburgh Scheme\" 1914:117</ref>\n\n==Twentieth century==\n\n===Containment===\n[[File:Map of the City of Washington Showing Location of Fatal Cases of Consumption.jpg|thumb|A map of deaths from tuberculosis in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1900\u20131901.]]\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, tuberculosis was one of the UK's most urgent health problems. A royal commission was set up in 1901, The Royal Commission Appointed to Inquire into the Relations of Human and Animal Tuberculosis. Its remit was to find out whether tuberculosis in animals and humans was the same disease, and whether animals and humans could infect each other. By 1919, the Commission had evolved into the UK's Medical Research Council.\n\nIn 1902, the International Conference on Tuberculosis convened in Berlin. Among various other acts, the conference proposed the [[Cross of Lorraine]] be the international symbol of the fight against tuberculosis. National campaigns spread across Europe and the United States to tamp down on the continued prevalence of tuberculosis.\n\nAfter the establishment in the 1880s that the disease was contagious, TB was made a [[notifiable disease]] in Britain; there were campaigns to stop spitting in public places, and the infected poor were pressured to enter sanatoria that resembled prisons; the sanatoria for the middle and upper classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention.<ref name =sanatoria>McCarthy 2001:413-7</ref> Whatever the purported benefits of the fresh air and labor in the sanatoria, even under the best conditions, 50% of those who entered were dead within five years (1916).<ref name=sanatoria/>\n\nThe promotion of [[Christmas Seals]] began in Denmark during 1904 as a way to raise money for tuberculosis programs. It expanded to the United States and Canada in 1907\u20131908 to help the [[National Tuberculosis Association]] (later called the [[American Lung Association]]).\n\nIn the United States, concern about the spread of tuberculosis played a role in the movement to prohibit public spitting except into [[spittoon]]s.\n\n===Vaccines===\nThe first genuine success in immunizing against tuberculosis was developed from attenuated bovine-strain tuberculosis by [[Albert Calmette]] and [[Camille Gu\u00e9rin]] in 1906. It was called \"BCG\" (''[[Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin|Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin]]''). The BCG vaccine was first used on humans in 1921 in France,<ref>Bonah 2005:696\u2013721</ref> but it was not until after World War II that BCG received widespread acceptance in Great Britain, and Germany.<ref>Comstock 1994:528-40</ref> In the early days of the British [[National Health Service]] X-ray examination for TB increased dramatically but rates of vaccination were initially very low. In 1953 it was agreed that secondary school pupils should be vaccinated, but by the end of 1954 only 250,000 people had been vaccinated. By 1956 this had risen to 600,000, about half being school children.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Webster|first1=Charles|title=The Health Services Since the War|date=1988|publisher=HMSO|location=London|isbn=978-0116309426|page=323}}</ref>\n\nIn Italy for some decades the Italian competitor of the French tubercular vaccine [[BCG vaccine]].was the [[Salvioli's diffusing vaccine]]  (acronym 'VDS from its Italian name {{lang|it| Vaccino Diffondente Salvioli}})  used from 1948 until 1976. It was prepared by professor Gaetano Salvioli (1894\u20131982) of the [[University of Bologna]].\n\n===Treatments===\n[[File:Tuberculosis in the USA 1861-2014.png|alt= Tuberculosis mortality in the USA from 1861 to 2014.|thumb|Tuberculosis mortality in the USA from 1861 to 2014.]]\n\nAs the century progressed, some surgical interventions, including the [[pneumothorax]] or [[plombage]] technique\u2014collapsing an infected lung to \"rest\" it and allow the lesions to heal\u2014were used to treat tuberculosis.<ref>Wolfart 1990:506\u201311</ref> Pneumothorax was not a new technique by any means. In 1696, [[Giorgio Baglivi]] reported a general improvement in tuberculosis sufferers after they received sword wounds to the chest. [[F.H. Ramadge]] induced the first successful therapeutic pneumothorax in 1834, and reported subsequently the patient was cured. It was in the 20th century, however, that scientists sought to rigorously investigate the effectiveness of such procedures. In 1939, the ''[[British Journal of Tuberculosis]]'' published a study by [[Oli Hjaltested]] and [[Kjeld T\u00f6rning]] on 191 patients undergoing the procedure between 1925 and 1931; in 1951, Roger Mitchell published several articles on the therapeutic outcomes of 557 patients treated between 1930 and 1939 at [[Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium|Trudeau Sanatorium]] in [[Saranac Lake, New York|Saranac Lake]].<ref>Daniel 2006:1866</ref> The search for a medicinal cure, however, continued in earnest.\n\nDuring the [[Nazi occupation of Poland]], [[SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]] [[Wilhelm Koppe]] organized the execution of more than 30,000 Polish patients suffering from tuberculosis \u2013 little knowing or caring that a cure was nearly at hand.\n\nIn 1944 [[Albert Schatz (scientist)|Albert Schatz]], [[Elizabeth Bugie]], and [[Selman Waksman]] isolated [[streptomycin]] produced by a bacterial strain ''[[Streptomyces griseus]].'' Streptomycin was the first effective antibiotic against ''M. tuberculosis''.<ref name=\"Daniel1868\">Daniel 2006:1868</ref> This discovery is generally considered the beginning of the modern era of tuberculosis, although the true revolution began some years later, in 1952, with the development of [[isoniazid]], the first oral mycobactericidal drug.<ref name=\"Daniel1868\"/> The advent of [[rifampin]] in the 1970s hastened recovery times, and significantly reduced the number of tuberculosis cases until the 1980s.\n\nThe British epidemiologist [[Thomas McKeown (physician)|Thomas McKeown]] had shown that ''<nowiki/>'treatment by streptomycin reduced the number of deaths since it was introduced (1948\u201371) by 51 per cent...'<nowiki/>''.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/publications/role-medicine-dream-mirage-or-nemesis|title=The Role of Medicine: Dream, Mirage or Nemesis?

The free-to-play game adopted a \"season\"-driven release schedule, each season lasting 10 weeks, during which a new set of cosmetic items and emotes were offered.

In the late 2010s, loot boxes faced scrutiny from several government-related groups, believing they encouraged [[gambling]], particularly for young players. Battle passes were then seen as a preferable option to loot boxes, as players would be able to see all the rewards they could earn, even if they needed to spend a great deal of time completing all the tiers, assuring players continued to play the game. Further, by offering the means for players to buy into completing tiers, publishers could also see additional revenue.<ref name=\"pcgamer july2018\" />\n\nCoupled with the success of ''Fortnite''{{'s}} battle pass approach and exhaustion over loot box controversies, other publishers started to evaluate battle pass use, with gaming journalists theorizing that games which formerly relied on loot boxes or worked [[games as a service|as a service]] could begin to offer battle passes as a replacement.<ref name=\"pcgamer july2018\" /><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2018/5/21/17376178/fortnite-season-4-battle-pass-skins-loot-boxes | title = What Fortnite\u2019s Battle Pass gets right | first =Clayton | last = Ashley | date = May 21, 2018 | accessdate = June 19, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Video game monetization}}\n\n[[Category:Business models]]\n[[Category:Video game terminology]]\n[[Category:Video game distribution]]\n[[Category:Words coined in the 2010s]]\n[[Category:Video games containing battle passes| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{for2|the American Revolutionary War site in New York|[[Battle Pass]]|the Battle Pass Scenic Byway|[[Wyoming Highway 70]]}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Battle pass fortnite.png|thumb|right|An example of a Battle pass screen from the game ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', showing its two-tier, multi-level reward system.]]\nIn the video game industry, a '''battle pass''' is a type of [[video game monetization|monetization approach]] that provides additional content for a game usually through a tiered system, rewarding the player with in-game items by playing the game and completing specific challenges.

Its runaway success on a scale rarely seen before drew great interest towards its monetization methods.  The free-to-play game adopted a \"season\"-driven release schedule, each season lasting 10 weeks, during which a new set of cosmetic items and emotes were offered. The newly coined \"Battle Pass\" was added starting in its second season, during a time when the game was seeing a large growth in its player base and has been used by the game since.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2017/12/15/fortnite-battle-royale-gets-dota-2-style-battle-pass-loads-of-new-items/ | title = Fortnite Battle Royale gets Dota 2-style Battle Pass, loads of new items | first = Sherif | last = Saed | date = December 15, 2017 | accessdate = July 14, 2018 | work = [[VG247]] }}</ref> Battle passes are purchased through an in-game currency called V-bucks, which either must be purchased with real-world funds via microtransactions, or earned via ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]''. Analyst [[Michael Pachter]] estimated that on the first day of the third season, in February 2018, Epic sold more than five million battle passes, generating over {{USD|50 million}} in revenue in a single day.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-05-25-fortnite-sold-5-million-battle-passes-on-the-first-day-of-season-3 | title = Fortnite sold 5 million battle passes on the first day of Season 3 | first = Rebekah | last =Valentine | date =May 25, 2018 | accessdate = July 6, 2018 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref> With expansion of ''Fortnite'' to mobile devices in March 2018, revenue estimates from the game were in the hundreds of millions of dollars per month in the following months, primarily from battle pass sales.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/fortnite-made-almost-300-million-in-april-shows-no-signs-of-slowing-down/ | title = Fortnite tallied almost $300 million in April, with no signs of slowing down | first=  Jason | last = Parker | date = May 24, 2018 | accessdate = July 6, 2018 | work = [[CNet]] }}</ref>\n\nAt the same time as ''Fortnite'' was becoming a success, the [[video game industry]] had been dealing with the issue of [[loot box]]es, another monetization scheme where players spend funds to open boxes containing a random assortment of in-game items. In the late 2010s, loot boxes faced scrutiny from several government-related groups, believing they encouraged [[gambling]], particularly for young players. Battle passes were then seen as a preferable option to loot boxes, as players would be able to see all the rewards they could earn, even if they needed to spend a great deal of time completing all the tiers, assuring players continued to play the game. Further, by offering the means for players to buy into completing tiers, publishers could also see additional revenue.<ref name=\"pcgamer july2018\" />\n\nCoupled with the success of ''Fortnite''{{'s}} battle pass approach and exhaustion over loot box controversies, other publishers started to evaluate battle pass use, with gaming journalists theorizing that games which formerly relied on loot boxes or worked [[games as a service|as a service]] could begin to offer battle passes as a replacement.<ref name=\"pcgamer july2018\" /><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2018/5/21/17376178/fortnite-season-4-battle-pass-skins-loot-boxes | title = What Fortnite\u2019s Battle Pass gets right | first =Clayton | last = Ashley | date = May 21, 2018 | accessdate = June 19, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Video game monetization}}\n\n[[Category:Business models]]\n[[Category:Video game terminology]]\n[[Category:Video game distribution]]\n[[Category:Words coined in the 2010s]]\n[[Category:Video games containing battle passes| ]]\n", "name_user": "Nihiltres", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Simplified hatnote syntax", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_pass"}
