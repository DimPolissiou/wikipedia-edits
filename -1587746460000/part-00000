While many [[video game]]s have used scantily clad images or characters to sell or enhance games, some go further, using [[Human sexual activity|sex acts]] or [[nudity]] as a [[motivation|character motivation]] (that is, the reason for a character's behaviors and actions), in-game reward, or simply as a gameplay element. These games originate worldwide, on most [[computing platform|platforms]] and can be of any [[video game genre]]. While releases in Europe and North America have been sporadic and often unlicensed, Japan has seen the emergence of a pornographic video game subgenre\u2014[[eroge]], first appearing on the [[PC-8800 series|NEC PC-88]] computer platform in the 1980s. In the 1990s [[NEC]] (on the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] series and [[PC-FX]]) and [[Sega]] (on [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]]) were the only companies who officially allowed sexual content on their consoles in Japan, but eroge was more prevalent on the [[PC-9800 series|NEC PC-98]] and [[FM Towns]] computer platforms.\n\n==History==\n===1980s===\nOne of the earliest video games (if not the first) to feature sexual themes was the 1981 [[text adventure|text-based]] ''[[Softporn Adventure]]'', published by [[On-Line Systems]] for the [[Apple II]]. Despite heavy piracy the game still sold 25,000 copies, roughly equivalent to 25% of the number of Apple II's sold at the time. In a 1981 article in ''[[Time Magazine]]'', On-Line reported that they were making a version of the game for straight women, though this never materialized.<ref>[http://www.ugo.com/games/softporn-adventure-best-game-ever Softporn Adventure Is the Best Sex Crazed Text Adventure Ever - UGO.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201004424/http://www.ugo.com/games/softporn-adventure-best-game-ever |date=2012-02-01 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, Japan's [[Koei]], founded by husband-and-wife team [[Yoichi Erikawa|Yoichi]] and [[Keiko Erikawa]] (and later known for [[strategy video game]]s), released the first erotic computer game with sexually explicit graphics, ''[[Night Life (video game)|Night Life]]'',<ref name=Retro>[http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/JPNcomputers/Japanesecomputers3.htm Retro Japanese Computers: Gaming's Final Frontier], Hardcore Gaming 101, reprinted from ''[[Retro Gamer]]'', Issue 67, 2009</ref> an early [[graphic adventure game]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Matthew T.|date=December 2005|title=The Impact of Telepresence on Cultural Transmission through Bishoujo Games|journal=PsychNology Journal|volume=3|issue=3|pages=292\u2013311|url=http://www.psychnology.org/File/PNJ3(3)/PSYCHNOLOGY_JOURNAL_3_3_JONES.pdf|issn=1720-7525}}</ref> for the [[PC-8800 series|NEC PC-8801]].

The games were [[List of video games notable for negative reception|noted for their negative reception]], particularly ''Custer's Revenge'' for its depiction of (what was perceived as) [[George Armstrong Custer|General Custer]] raping a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] woman. Despite the increased sales (due to one of the first instances of [[video game controversy]]), Mystique went out of business after only releasing these three games. A company named [[Playaround]] began distributing these games packaged in 2-in-1 \"double-ender\" cartridges. These games also included re-worked versions with female protagonists, ''Philly Flasher'' (''Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em''), ''Bachelorette Party'' (''Bachelor Party''), and ''General Retreat'' (''Custer's Revenge''). The re-released version of ''Custer's Revenge'' was titled ''Westward Ho!'', and featured slight modifications, such as the Native American woman beckoning to indicate that she welcomed Custer's advances. They released four new titles, ''Burning Desire/Jungle Fever'' and ''Cathouse Blues/Gigolo''. 1983 saw the release of another Atari 2600 game, ''[[X-Man (video game)|X-Man]]''. ''X-man'' features the player as a nude man working through a maze toward a pink door in the center, past antagonistic crabs, teeth and scissors. Players that reached the pink door were rewarded with a controllable [[Sex in film|sex scene]].\n\nLike with Koei, several other now-famous Japanese companies such as [[Enix]], [[Square (video game company)|Square]] and [[Nihon Falcom]] also released erotic adult games for the [[PC-8800 series|PC-8801]] computer in the early 1980s before they became mainstream. Early eroge usually had simplistic stories and extreme sexual content, such as [[rape]] and types [[Yuri (genre)|Yuri]], hentai, and [[Lolicon]]. These factors often led to widespread condemnation from the Japanese media.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In some of the early erotic games, the erotic content is meaningfully integrated into a thoughtful and mature storyline, though others often used it as simply an excuse for pornography.<ref name=Retro/> Erotic games made the PC-8801 popular, but customers quickly tired of paying 8800 yen ($85) for such simple games. Soon, new genres were invented. ASCII's ''Chaos Angels,'' a [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] eroge, inspired titles such as ''[[Dragon Knight (video game series)|Dragon Knight]]'' by Elf and ''[[Rance (series)|Rance]]'' by [[AliceSoft]].\n\nIn 1983, a company called Entertainment Enterprises, Ltd., released an arcade game called ''Swinging Singles'' which was mostly meant for [[Bar (establishment)|bars]], [[Sex shop|adult stores]] and [[sex club]]s. The game requires the player to drive through the city maze gathering dots like [[Pac-Man]] before reaching a [[brothel]] where the player is required to fight off a [[Sexually transmitted infection|venereal disease]] and collect keys to unlock sex scenes.

Examples include ''[[Red Light Center]], [[Singles: Flirt Up Your Life]]'' and ''[[Playboy: The Mansion]]''. While it is not explicitly intended for purely adult-oriented entertainment, the virtual world of ''[[Second Life]]'', which is made up almost entirely of player-made content, has an array of very exotic adult entertainment including nudity and full-on sexual activities.\n\nAdult games may take the form of [[copyright infringement|bootleg]]s, circumventing mainstream publishers who may have policies against such games. [[Patch (computing)|Patch]]es or [[Hacker|hacks]] to mainstream non-adult games may add sexual and pornographic themes, mostly for [[humor]], especially when sexuality was never intended in the original game. Examples include the ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' video games, the ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' [[Hot Coffee mod]], ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' and \n''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'', (which both have multiple such mods), ''[[Half-Life 2]]'''s FakeFactory Cinematic Mod and [[read-only memory|ROM]] hacks for console [[emulator]]s.\n\nThe Internet has allowed adult games to receive wider availability and recognition, including amateur games in Flash or Java. It has also allowed amateurs to create and distribute adult text adventure games, known as \"Adult Interactive Fiction\" or AIF.<ref name=Apophis/>\n\nModern consumer [[virtual reality headset]]s, such as the [[Oculus Rift]] and [[HTC Vive]], allow users to engage in [[virtual sex]] through simulated environments. An example is ''[[VR Kanojo]]''.\n\n===2010s===\n[[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s 2016 game ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' has inspired a notable amount of fan-made porn. Short porn videos featuring official characters have been animated via [[Source Filmmaker]] and are popular on porn sites such as [[Pornhub]] and [[YouPorn]]. Despite its popularity, Blizzard has issued [[cease-and-desist]] orders to some of the creators. \n\nMany [[fanservice]] video games with sexual content have some brief nudity. The \"M\" rated series ''[[Senran Kagura]]'' has some nudity in both gameplay and cutscenes but genitals aren't displayed. Fanservice games rated \"T\" such as ''[[Hyperdimension Neptunia]]'' offer similar content but less than what ''Senran Kagura'' has. Howerver, since 2018, Sony has now issued new regulations for [[PlayStation 4]] games with both fanservice and sexual content. For the localized release of ''[[Senran Kagura Burst Re:Newal]]'', \"Intimacy Mode\", a mode where the player can play with the characters' bodies was removed, but by comparison, this mode is still available in the series' previous titles ''[[Senran Kagura: Estival Versus]]'' and ''[[Senran Kagura: Peach Beach Splash]]''.

While many [[video game]]s have used scantily clad images or characters to sell or enhance games, some go further, using [[Human sexual activity|sex acts]] or [[nudity]] as a [[motivation|character motivation]] (that is, the reason for a character's behaviors and actions), in-game reward, or simply as a gameplay element. These games originate worldwide, on most [[computing platform|platforms]] and can be of any [[video game genre]]. While releases in Europe and North America have been sporadic and often unlicensed, Japan has seen the emergence of a pornographic video game subgenre\u2014[[eroge]], first appearing on the [[PC-8800 series|NEC PC-88]] computer platform in the 1980s. In the 1990s [[NEC]] (on the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] series and [[PC-FX]]) and [[Sega]] (on [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]]) were the only companies who officially allowed sexual content on their consoles in Japan, but eroge was more prevalent on the [[PC-9800 series|NEC PC-98]] and [[FM Towns]] computer platforms.\n\n==History==\n===1980s===\nOne of the earliest video games (if not the first) to feature sexual themes was the 1981 [[text adventure|text-based]] ''[[Softporn Adventure]]'', published by [[On-Line Systems]] for the [[Apple II]]. Despite heavy piracy the game still sold 25,000 copies, roughly equivalent to 25% of the number of Apple II's sold at the time. In a 1981 article in ''[[Time Magazine]]'', On-Line reported that they were making a version of the game for straight women, though this never materialized.<ref>[http://www.ugo.com/games/softporn-adventure-best-game-ever Softporn Adventure Is the Best Sex Crazed Text Adventure Ever - UGO.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201004424/http://www.ugo.com/games/softporn-adventure-best-game-ever |date=2012-02-01 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, Japan's [[Koei]], founded by husband-and-wife team [[Yoichi Erikawa|Yoichi]] and [[Keiko Erikawa]] (and later known for [[strategy video game]]s), released the first erotic computer game with sexually explicit graphics, ''[[Night Life (video game)|Night Life]]'',<ref name=Retro>[http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/JPNcomputers/Japanesecomputers3.htm Retro Japanese Computers: Gaming's Final Frontier], Hardcore Gaming 101, reprinted from ''[[Retro Gamer]]'', Issue 67, 2009</ref> an early [[graphic adventure game]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Matthew T.|date=December 2005|title=The Impact of Telepresence on Cultural Transmission through Bishoujo Games|journal=PsychNology Journal|volume=3|issue=3|pages=292\u2013311|url=http://www.psychnology.org/File/PNJ3(3)/PSYCHNOLOGY_JOURNAL_3_3_JONES.pdf|issn=1720-7525}}</ref> for the [[PC-8800 series|NEC PC-8801]].

The games were [[List of video games notable for negative reception|noted for their negative reception]], particularly ''Custer's Revenge'' for its depiction of (what was perceived as) [[George Armstrong Custer|General Custer]] raping a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] woman. Despite the increased sales (due to one of the first instances of [[video game controversy]]), Mystique went out of business after only releasing these three games. A company named [[Playaround]] began distributing these games packaged in 2-in-1 \"double-ender\" cartridges. These games also included re-worked versions with female protagonists, ''Philly Flasher'' (''Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em''), ''Bachelorette Party'' (''Bachelor Party''), and ''General Retreat'' (''Custer's Revenge''). The re-released version of ''Custer's Revenge'' was titled ''Westward Ho!'', and featured slight modifications, such as the Native American woman beckoning to indicate that she welcomed Custer's advances. They released four new titles, ''Burning Desire/Jungle Fever'' and ''Cathouse Blues/Gigolo''. 1983 saw the release of another Atari 2600 game, ''[[X-Man (video game)|X-Man]]''. ''X-man'' features the player as a nude man working through a maze toward a pink door in the center, past antagonistic crabs, teeth and scissors. Players that reached the pink door were rewarded with a controllable [[Sex in film|sex scene]].\n\nLike with Koei, several other now-famous Japanese companies such as [[Enix]], [[Square (video game company)|Square]] and [[Nihon Falcom]] also released erotic adult games for the [[PC-8800 series|PC-8801]] computer in the early 1980s before they became mainstream. Early eroge usually had simplistic stories and extreme sexual content, such as [[rape]] and types [[Yuri (genre)|Yuri]], hentai, and [[Lolicon]]. These factors often led to widespread condemnation from the Japanese media.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In some of the early erotic games, the erotic content is meaningfully integrated into a thoughtful and mature storyline, though others often used it as simply an excuse for pornography.<ref name=Retro/> Erotic games made the PC-8801 popular, but customers quickly tired of paying 8800 yen ($85) for such simple games. Soon, new genres were invented. ASCII's ''Chaos Angels,'' a [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] eroge, inspired titles such as ''[[Dragon Knight (video game series)|Dragon Knight]]'' by Elf and ''[[Rance (series)|Rance]]'' by [[AliceSoft]].\n\nIn 1983, a company called Entertainment Enterprises, Ltd., released an arcade game called ''Swinging Singles'' which was mostly meant for [[Bar (establishment)|bars]], [[Sex shop|adult stores]] and [[sex club]]s. The game requires the player to drive through the city maze gathering dots like [[Pac-Man]] before reaching a [[brothel]] where the player is required to fight off a [[Sexually transmitted infection|venereal disease]] and collect keys to unlock sex scenes. Once the scenes are unlocked the top door is open where the player can go and engage in a controllable sex scene, letting the player have intercourse with a woman until the player reaches [[orgasm]] and the game is over.\n\nAlso released in 1983 was ''Strip Poker: A Sizzling Game of Chance'' for the Commodore 64 and other 8-bit platforms which was created by Artworx Software.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamefaqs.com/c64/934689-strip-poker-a-sizzling-game-of-chance/data|title=Strip Poker: A Sizzling Game of Chance Release Information for Commodore 64 - GameFAQs|website=www.gamefaqs.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, [[Martech]] released a Strip Poker game featuring digitized pictures of [[Samantha Fox]], on the Spectrum, C64 and Amstrad.

Nudity was subsequently featured in the game's sequels, ''[[God of War II]]'' (2007), ''[[God of War: Chains of Olympus]]'' (2008), ''[[God of War III]]'' (2010), ''[[God of War: Ghost of Sparta]]'' (2010), and ''[[God of War: Ascension]]'' (2013), which were also based on Greek mythology.\n\nSex scenes and nudity have also appeared in [[Quantic Dream]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit (2005 video game)|Fahrenheit]]'' (aka Indigo Prophecy) and ''[[Heavy Rain]]'', released for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 respectively.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=David |title=10 Most cringeworthy video game sex scenes |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/10-most-cringeworthy-video-game-sex-scenes/ |website=Gamesraider |accessdate=1 June 2018 |language=EN-US |date=13 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nA new generation of adult social games has emerged that bring multiple users together in sexual environments. Examples include ''[[Red Light Center]], [[Singles: Flirt Up Your Life]]'' and ''[[Playboy: The Mansion]]''. While it is not explicitly intended for purely adult-oriented entertainment, the virtual world of ''[[Second Life]]'', which is made up almost entirely of player-made content, has an array of very exotic adult entertainment including nudity and full-on sexual activities.\n\nAdult games may take the form of [[copyright infringement|bootleg]]s, circumventing mainstream publishers who may have policies against such games. [[Patch (computing)|Patch]]es or [[Hacker|hacks]] to mainstream non-adult games may add sexual and pornographic themes, mostly for [[humor]], especially when sexuality was never intended in the original game. Examples include the ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' video games, the ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' [[Hot Coffee mod]], ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' and \n''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'', (which both have multiple such mods), ''[[Half-Life 2]]'''s FakeFactory Cinematic Mod and [[read-only memory|ROM]] hacks for console [[emulator]]s.\n\nThe Internet has allowed adult games to receive wider availability and recognition, including amateur games in Flash or Java. It has also allowed amateurs to create and distribute adult text adventure games, known as \"Adult Interactive Fiction\" or AIF.<ref name=Apophis/>\n\nModern consumer [[virtual reality headset]]s, such as the [[Oculus Rift]] and [[HTC Vive]], allow users to engage in [[virtual sex]] through simulated environments. An example is ''[[VR Kanojo]]''.\n\n===2010s===\n[[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s 2016 game ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' has inspired a notable amount of fan-made porn. Short porn videos featuring official characters have been animated via [[Source Filmmaker]] and are popular on porn sites such as [[Pornhub]] and [[YouPorn]]. Despite its popularity, Blizzard has issued [[cease-and-desist]] orders to some of the creators. \n\nMany [[fanservice]] video games with sexual content have some brief nudity. The \"M\" rated series ''[[Senran Kagura]]'' has some nudity in both gameplay and cutscenes but genitals aren't displayed. Fanservice games rated \"T\" such as ''[[Hyperdimension Neptunia]]'' offer similar content but less than what ''Senran Kagura'' has. Howerver, since 2018, Sony has now issued new regulations for [[PlayStation 4]] games with both fanservice and sexual content. For the localized release of ''[[Senran Kagura Burst Re:Newal]]'', \"Intimacy Mode\", a mode where the player can play with the characters' bodies was removed, but by comparison, this mode is still available in the series' previous titles ''[[Senran Kagura: Estival Versus]]'' and ''[[Senran Kagura: Peach Beach Splash]]''. The PC release of ''Burst Re:Newal'' was not changed.<ref>[http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2018/10/sony_seemingly_censors_controversial_senran_kagura_mode \"Sony seemingly censors controversial Senran Kagura mode\"]</ref> Many other recent PS4 games with sexual content are facing the same problem from Sony, including ''[[Date a Live|Date a Live: Rio Reincarnation]]'' and the ''[[Nekopara]]'' series. This controversy had become a problem for the development of ''[[Senran Kagura 7even]]'', in which publishers [[Marvelous (company)|Marvelous]] are now reconsidering the game.<ref>[http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/02/senran_kagura_7even_impossible_to_release_after_sony_censorship_row \"Senran Kagura 7even impossible to release after Sony censorship row\"]</ref> [[Idea Factory International]] posted on [[Twitter]] that they have no plans for a PS4 Western release of ''[[Mary Skelter 2]]'' most likely due to this controversy.\n\n[[Indie games]] have expanded the reach of adult games, and [[Steam (service)|Steam]] now allows adult games onto its storefront.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/24/20708786/koikatsu-party-steam-sex-game-patch-valve-sales|title=One of Steam\u2019s top-selling titles last month was an intense sex game|last=Hernandez|first=Patricia|date=2019-07-24|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> [[Patreon]] provides direct funding to adult developers, allowing games like ''[[Hardcoded (video games)|Hardcoded]]'' to appeal to niche markets that previously would not have been created.<ref name=\"byte\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fanbyte.com/features/hardcoded-has-the-trans-representation-we-need-in-adult-games/|title=Hardcoded Has the Trans Representation We Need in Adult Games|author=Valens, Ana|date=2019-06-03|website=Fanbyte|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\n==Lists of related games==\n*[[List of erotic video games]]\n*[[List of Japanese erotic video games]]\n*[[List of AO-rated video games]] (the [[ESRB]]'s \"Adults Only\" rating)\n*[[List of controversial video games]]\n*[[List of banned video games]]\n*[[BL game|List of Boy's Love video games]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Overwatch and pornography]]\n*[[Portrayal of women in video games]]\n*[[Cybersex]]\n*[[Eroge]]\n*[[Hentai]]\n*[[Virtual sex]]\n*[[Uncanny valley]]\n*[[Criticism of Second Life]]\n*[[Gender representation in video games]]\n*[[List of erotic video games]]\n*[[BDSM in culture and media]]\n*[[Sexism in video gaming]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Apophis\">\n{{cite web\n | last = Apophis\n | first = MMOcast\n | authorlink =\n | title = Venus Rising \u2013 The Adult MMO from Foxysoft entered the Alpha Phase\n | website = \n | publisher = Apophis\n | date = April 11, 2014\n | url = http://www.mmocast.com/venus-rising-adult-mmo-entered-alpha-phase/\n | format =\n | doi =\n | accessdate = April 11, 2014}}\n</ref>\n}}\n\n{{Video game controversy}}\n{{VideoGameGenre}}\n{{Sex}}\n\n[[Category:Pornographic works| Video games]]\n[[Category:Video game types]]\n[[Category:Erotic video games| ]]\n[[Category:Sex industry]]\n", "name_user": "Nomader", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e2010s:Fixed minor grammar error", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_nudity_in_video_games"}
