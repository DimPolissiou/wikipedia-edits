In Italy, the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] regime led by [[Benito Mussolini]] made use of propaganda, including pageantry and fiery speeches, to inspire the nation and lead the populace to war.\n\nThe [[Nazi Party]] in the years leading up to and during [[Adolf Hitler]]'s leadership of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] also used propaganda to gain widespread support for Nazi policies and later, to maintain power. Both Hitler and [[Joseph Goebbels]], the head of the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] were skillful masters of propaganda.\n\nThe Nazi Party's manipulation of all forms of media from newspaper, books and films became omnipresent and extended beyond Germany. Filmmaker [[Leni Riefenstahl]] created two epic propaganda films, ''[[Victory of Faith|Der Sieg des Glaubens]]'' or ''Victory of Faith'' (1933) and  ''[[Triumph of the Will|Triumph des Willens]]''  or ''Triumph of the Will'' (1935)  that depicted the fervent Nazi multitudes in the 1930s [[Nuremberg Rally|Nuremberg Rallies]].\n\nDespite [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s passionate address in his 1941 State of the Union, articulating the [[Four Freedoms]]: [[Freedom of speech]], [[Freedom of worship]], [[Freedom from want]] and [[Freedom from fear]], a homegrown [[German American Bund]] was formed, espousing Nazi values. By the time they entered the global conflict, Americans rejected the politics of fear and hate.\n\nThrough the efforts of information bureaus and traditional media sources such as newspapers, radio and newsreel films, the Allies have attempted to counter the Axis propaganda. The universal principles of [[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|liberty, equality and fraternity]] along with the four freedoms have become the basis of the fight in which the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] nations are engaged. The war on information and propaganda fronts, and the hopes for the future are also founded on cooperation and common purpose of all the democracies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Benito Mussolini]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Adolf Hitler]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Joseph Goebbels]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Rudolf Hess]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Fritz Julius Kuhn]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Franklin D.

In Italy, the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] regime led by [[Benito Mussolini]] made use of propaganda, including pageantry and fiery speeches, to inspire the nation and lead the populace to war.\n\nThe [[Nazi Party]] in the years leading up to and during [[Adolf Hitler]]'s leadership of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] also used propaganda to gain widespread support for Nazi policies and later, to maintain power. Both Hitler and [[Joseph Goebbels]], the head of the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] were skillful masters of propaganda.\n\nThe Nazi Party's manipulation of all forms of media from newspaper, books and films became omnipresent and extended beyond Germany. Filmmaker [[Leni Riefenstahl]] created two epic propaganda films, ''[[Victory of Faith|Der Sieg des Glaubens]]'' or ''Victory of Faith'' (1933) and  ''[[Triumph of the Will|Triumph des Willens]]''  or ''Triumph of the Will'' (1935)  that depicted the fervent Nazi multitudes in the 1930s [[Nuremberg Rally|Nuremberg Rallies]].\n\nDespite [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s passionate address in his 1941 State of the Union, articulating the [[Four Freedoms]]: [[Freedom of speech]], [[Freedom of worship]], [[Freedom from want]] and [[Freedom from fear]], a homegrown [[German American Bund]] was formed, espousing Nazi values. By the time they entered the global conflict, Americans rejected the politics of fear and hate.\n\nThrough the efforts of information bureaus and traditional media sources such as newspapers, radio and newsreel films, the Allies have attempted to counter the Axis propaganda. The universal principles of [[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|liberty, equality and fraternity]] along with the four freedoms have become the basis of the fight in which the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] nations are engaged. The war on information and propaganda fronts, and the hopes for the future are also founded on cooperation and common purpose of all the democracies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Benito Mussolini]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Adolf Hitler]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Joseph Goebbels]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Rudolf Hess]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Fritz Julius Kuhn]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Franklin D.

The significance of the discussion trailers' impact on the political culture of the day is most clearly manifest in their encouragement of debates involving contentions that themselves had major political and ideological connotations.

Each film was shown over a six-month period as part of the shorts or newsreel segments in approximately 800 theatres across Canada. The NFB had an arrangement with [[Famous Players theatres]] to ensure that Canadians from coast-to-coast could see them, with further distribution by [[Columbia Pictures]].<ref name=\"Ellis\">Ellis and McLane  2005, p. 122.</ref> Bookings for the ''Canada Carries On'' films continued in Famous Players theatres and other cinemas throughout Canada. Some films were also sold to individual theatres periodically. Columbia Pictures continued to distribute the series, with France Films handling its French counterpart, ''En Avant Canada'', in Quebec and New Brunswick.<ref name=\"Ohayon\">Ohayon, Albert.[http://blog.nfb.ca/blog/2014/05/14/canada-carries-on-postwar-years/ \"\u201cCanada Carries On\u201d and the postwar years: the National Film Board in transition.\"] ''National Film Board of Canada'', May 14, 2014.

They were also made available to film libraries operated by university and provincial authorities. A total of 199 films were produced before the series was canceled in 1959.<ref name=\"Ohayon\"/>\n\nIn his book, ''Filming Politics: Communism and the Portrayal of the Working Class at the National Film Board of Canada, 1939-46.'', historian Malek Khouri analyzed the role of the NFB documentaries including ''The Voice of Action''. Khouri noted: \"The use of media as an interactive discussion tool to deal with issues of social and economic development is also dealt with in a film about the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) ... The significance of the discussion trailers' impact on the political culture of the day is most clearly manifest in their encouragement of debates involving contentions that themselves had major political and ideological connotations. Firstly, these trailers pointed out the prospect of opening media outlets to political debates. In essence, they proposed that public space should also become a space for political action.\"<ref>Khouri 2007, p. 157.</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Bennett, Linda Greene.
