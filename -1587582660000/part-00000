Native American leader, [[Tantamous]] lived in the [[Nobscot Hill]] area of Framingham prior to [[King Philip's War]] in 1676. In 1660, [[Thomas Danforth]], an official of the Bay Colony, formerly of [[Framlingham|Framlingham, Suffolk]], received a grant of land at \"Danforth's Farms\" and began to accumulate over {{convert|15000|acre|km2|-2}}. He strenuously resisted petitions for incorporation of the town, which was officially incorporated in 1700, following his death the previous year. Why the \"L\" was dropped from the new town's name is not known. The first church was organized in 1701, the first teacher was hired in 1706, and the first permanent schoolhouse was built in 1716.\n\nOn February 22, 1775, the British general [[Thomas Gage]] sent two officers and an enlisted man out of Boston to survey the route to [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. In Framingham, those spies stopped at Buckminster's Tavern. They watched the town militia muster outside the building, impressed with the men's numbers but not their discipline. Though \"the whole company\" came into the tavern after their drill, the officers remained undetected and continued on their mission the next day.<ref>''General Gage's Instructions'', Boston: John Gill, 1779.</ref> Gage did not order a march along that route, instead ordering troops to [[Concord, Massachusetts]], on April 18\u201319. Framingham sent two militia companies totaling about 130 men into the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] that followed; one of those men was wounded.<ref>Samuel Adams Drake, ''History of Middlesex County, Massachusetts'' (Boston: Estes & Lauriat, 1880), vol. 1, p. 443</ref>\n\nIn the years before the [[American Civil War]], Framingham was an annual gathering-spot for members of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement. Each [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] from 1854 to 1865, the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society held a rally in a picnic area called Harmony Grove near what is now downtown Framingham. At the 1854 rally, [[William Lloyd Garrison]] burned copies of the [[Fugitive Slave Law]] of 1850, judicial decisions enforcing it, and the [[United States Constitution]]. Other prominent abolitionists present that day included [[William Cooper Nell]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Wendell Phillips]], [[Lucy Stone]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.masshist.org/objects/2005july.cfm |title=Massachusetts Historical Society: Object Archive |website=Masshist.org |date=1909-09-10 |accessdate=2017-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229221730/http://www.masshist.org/objects/2005july.cfm |archive-date=2010-12-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[post-World War II baby boom]], Framingham, like many other suburban areas, experienced a large increase in population and housing. Much of the housing constructed during that time consisted of [[split-level house|split-level]] and ranch-style houses.\n\nFramingham is known for the [[Framingham Heart Study]], as well as for the Dennison Manufacturing Company, which was founded in 1844 as a jewelry and watch box manufacturing company by [[Aaron Lufkin Dennison]], who became the pioneer of the [[American System of Watch Manufacturing]] at the nearby [[Waltham Watch Company]]. His brother Eliphalet Whorf Dennison developed the company into a sizable industrial complex which merged in 1990 into [[Avery Dennison]], with headquarters in [[Pasadena, California]], and active corporate offices in the town.\n\nIn 2000, Framingham celebrated its [[Tercentennial]]. Framingham soon rose to become the largest town in Massachusetts, commonly referred to by the people of Framingham as \"The largest town in the country.\" Framingham had attempted to become a city on three prior occasions 1993, 1997, and 2013, all of which were rejected by the people of Framingham.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patch.com/massachusetts/framingham/new-englands-largest-town-wants-become-city-0|title=New England's Largest Town Wants to Become a City|date=March 28, 2016|website=Framingham, MA Patch|accessdate=November 27, 2019}}</ref> However, on January 1, 2018,  Framingham became a city and [[Yvonne M.

Native American leader, [[Tantamous]] lived in the [[Nobscot Hill]] area of Framingham prior to [[King Philip's War]] in 1676. In 1660, [[Thomas Danforth]], an official of the Bay Colony, formerly of [[Framlingham|Framlingham, Suffolk]], received a grant of land at \"Danforth's Farms\" and began to accumulate over {{convert|15000|acre|km2|-2}}. He strenuously resisted petitions for incorporation of the town, which was officially incorporated in 1700, following his death the previous year. Why the \"L\" was dropped from the new town's name is not known. The first church was organized in 1701, the first teacher was hired in 1706, and the first permanent schoolhouse was built in 1716.\n\nOn February 22, 1775, the British general [[Thomas Gage]] sent two officers and an enlisted man out of Boston to survey the route to [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. In Framingham, those spies stopped at Buckminster's Tavern. They watched the town militia muster outside the building, impressed with the men's numbers but not their discipline. Though \"the whole company\" came into the tavern after their drill, the officers remained undetected and continued on their mission the next day.<ref>''General Gage's Instructions'', Boston: John Gill, 1779.</ref> Gage did not order a march along that route, instead ordering troops to [[Concord, Massachusetts]], on April 18\u201319. Framingham sent two militia companies totaling about 130 men into the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] that followed; one of those men was wounded.<ref>Samuel Adams Drake, ''History of Middlesex County, Massachusetts'' (Boston: Estes & Lauriat, 1880), vol. 1, p. 443</ref>\n\nIn the years before the [[American Civil War]], Framingham was an annual gathering-spot for members of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement. Each [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] from 1854 to 1865, the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society held a rally in a picnic area called Harmony Grove near what is now downtown Framingham. At the 1854 rally, [[William Lloyd Garrison]] burned copies of the [[Fugitive Slave Law]] of 1850, judicial decisions enforcing it, and the [[United States Constitution]]. Other prominent abolitionists present that day included [[William Cooper Nell]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Wendell Phillips]], [[Lucy Stone]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.masshist.org/objects/2005july.cfm |title=Massachusetts Historical Society: Object Archive |website=Masshist.org |date=1909-09-10 |accessdate=2017-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229221730/http://www.masshist.org/objects/2005july.cfm |archive-date=2010-12-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[post-World War II baby boom]], Framingham, like many other suburban areas, experienced a large increase in population and housing. Much of the housing constructed during that time consisted of [[split-level house|split-level]] and ranch-style houses.\n\nFramingham is known for the [[Framingham Heart Study]], as well as for the Dennison Manufacturing Company, which was founded in 1844 as a jewelry and watch box manufacturing company by [[Aaron Lufkin Dennison]], who became the pioneer of the [[American System of Watch Manufacturing]] at the nearby [[Waltham Watch Company]]. His brother Eliphalet Whorf Dennison developed the company into a sizable industrial complex which merged in 1990 into [[Avery Dennison]], with headquarters in [[Pasadena, California]], and active corporate offices in the town.\n\nIn 2000, Framingham celebrated its [[Tercentennial]]. Framingham soon rose to become the largest town in Massachusetts, commonly referred to by the people of Framingham as \"The largest town in the country.\" Framingham had attempted to become a city on three prior occasions 1993, 1997, and 2013, all of which were rejected by the people of Framingham.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patch.com/massachusetts/framingham/new-englands-largest-town-wants-become-city-0|title=New England's Largest Town Wants to Become a City|date=March 28, 2016|website=Framingham, MA Patch|accessdate=November 27, 2019}}</ref> However, on January 1, 2018,  Framingham became a city and [[Yvonne M.

Lake Pontchartrain borders the southeast side of the parish.\n\nThe name ''Tangipahoa'' comes from an [[Acolapissa]] word meaning \"ear of [[Maize|corn]]\" or \"those who gather corn.\" The parish was organized in 1869 during Reconstruction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tangipahoa Parish|url=http://ccet.louisiana.edu/tourism/parishes/Florida_Parishes/tangipahoa.html|publisher=Center for Cultural and Eco-Tourism|accessdate=September 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTangipahoa Parish comprises the Hammond, LA [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which is also included in the [[New Orleans-Metairie-Hammond, LA-MS CSA|New Orleans-Metairie-Hammond, LA-MS Combined Statistical Area]]. It is one of what are called the [[Florida Parishes]], at one time part of [[West Florida]].\n\n==History==\nTangipahoa Parish was created by Louisiana Act 85 on March 6th 1869, during the [[Reconstruction era]]. The parish was assembled from territories taken from [[Livingston Parish, Louisiana|Livingston Parish]], [[St. Helena Parish, Louisiana|St. Helena Parish]], [[St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana|St. Tammany Parish]], and [[Washington Parish, Louisiana|Washington Parish]]. It was named after the [[Tangipahoa River]] and the historic [[Tangipahoa]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people of this area. Tangipahoa is the youngest parish in the ''[[Florida Parishes]]'' region of southern Louisiana.\n\nParts of this area had already been developed for sugar cane plantations when the parish was organized, but yeomen farmers occupied areas in the piney woods and resisted planters' dominance. African Americans comprised about one-quarter of the population overall in the Florida Parishes before the war.<ref name=\"pfeifer\"/>\n\nThe region developed rapidly during and after Reconstruction. There were conflicts in Tangipahoa Parish among interests related to construction of railroads, exploitation of timber, yeoman farmers in the piney woods keeping truck farms, and the beginning of manufacturing. Sugar cane depended on the labor of large gangs of enslaved African Americans before the Civil War. After the war and emancipation, some freedmen stayed to work on the plantations as laborers. Others moved to New Orleans and other cities, seeking different work. This area had rapid development and a high rate of immigrants and migrants from other areas of the country. The eastern Florida Parishes had the most mob violence and highest rate of lynchings in southern Louisiana.<ref name=\"pfeifer\"/>\n\nEspecially after Reconstruction, whites routinely terrorized black communities with mob violence and lynching to prevent freedmen from organizing and gaining political and economic dominance. Piney woods whites resisted the planters' efforts to restore their power, but imposed their own brutal violence on freedmen. Tangipahoa Parish was made more volatile by a \"pronounced in-migration\" of northerners (from the Midwest) and [[Sicily|Sicilian]] immigrants, coupled with \"industrial development along the [[Illinois Central Railroad]], and crippling political factionalism.\" <ref name=\"pfeifer\"/> Laborers of different ethnic groups were pit against one in the struggle for new jobs and power and without the threat of retribution whites often used lynchings and mob violence to terrorize black workers; piney woods whites and migrants operated outside the legal system.\n\nDuring the period of 1877-1950; a total of 24 blacks were [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] by whites in the parish as a means of racial terrorism and intimidation. This was the sixth highest total of any parish in Louisiana<ref>[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf ''Lynching in America, Third Edition: Supplement by County''], p. 6, Equal Justice Initiative, Mobile, AL, 2017</ref> and the highest number of any parish in southern Louisiana.<ref name=\"pfeifer\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=zAGwb3G6soMC&dq=Lynchings+in+Tensas+Parish&q=Tangipahoa+parish#v=snippet&q=Tangipahoa%20parish&f=false Michael James Pfeifer, ''Rough Justice:  Lynching and American Society, 1874-1947''], University of Illinois Press, 2004, pp. 83-84</ref> Twenty-two of these murders took place from 1879-1919, a time of heightened violence in the state. Unlike some other parishes, Tangipahoa did not have a high rate of legal executions of blacks; the whites operated outside the justice system altogether.<ref name=\"pfeifer\"/> Among those lynched and hanged by a mob was Emma Hooper, a black woman who had shot and wounded a constable.<ref>Pfeifer (2004), ''Rough Justice'', p. 198, Footnote #104</ref>\n\nIn 1898 the Louisiana state legislature [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised blacks]] by raising barriers to voter registration, excluding them from politics for decades, until after passage of federal civil rights legislation. In the first half of the 20th century, many African Americans left Tangipahoa Parish to escape the violence and oppression of [[Jim Crow]], moving to industrial cities in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. During World War II, they moved to the West Coast, where the buildup of the defense industry opened up new jobs. In the 21st century, they constitute a minority in the parish.\n\nTimber, agriculture and industry are still important to the parish. It suffered flooding in 1932 and in the early 1980s. In 2016, Tangipahoa was one of many parishes declared a [[Federal government of the United States|Federal]] [[disaster area]] due to [[2016 Louisiana floods|historic flooding]] from rainfall and storms in both March and August.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the parish has a total area of {{convert|823|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|791|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|32|sqmi}} (3.9%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 2, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928155956/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|archivedate=September 28, 2013}}</ref> [[Lake Pontchartrain]] lies on the southeast side of the parish.\n\nMost of the parish south of [[Ponchatoula, Louisiana|Ponchatoula]] consists of [[Holocene]] coastal swamp and marsh\u2014gray-to-black clays of high organic content and thick peat beds underlying freshwater marsh and swamp.<ref>{{cite web | author=McCulloh, R.

It is one of what are called the [[Florida Parishes]], at one time part of [[West Florida]].\n\n==History==\nTangipahoa Parish was created by Louisiana Act 85 on March 6th 1869, during the [[Reconstruction era]]. The parish was assembled from territories taken from [[Livingston Parish, Louisiana|Livingston Parish]], [[St. Helena Parish, Louisiana|St. Helena Parish]], [[St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana|St. Tammany Parish]], and [[Washington Parish, Louisiana|Washington Parish]]. It was named after the [[Tangipahoa River]] and the historic [[Tangipahoa]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people of this area. Tangipahoa is the youngest parish in the ''[[Florida Parishes]]'' region of southern Louisiana.\n\nParts of this area had already been developed for sugar cane plantations when the parish was organized, but yeomen farmers occupied areas in the piney woods and resisted planters' dominance. African Americans comprised about one-quarter of the population overall in the Florida Parishes before the war.<ref name=\"pfeifer\"/>\n\nThe region developed rapidly during and after Reconstruction. There were conflicts in Tangipahoa Parish among interests related to construction of railroads, exploitation of timber, yeoman farmers in the piney woods keeping truck farms, and the beginning of manufacturing. Sugar cane depended on the labor of large gangs of enslaved African Americans before the Civil War. After the war and emancipation, some freedmen stayed to work on the plantations as laborers. Others moved to New Orleans and other cities, seeking different work. This area had rapid development and a high rate of immigrants and migrants from other areas of the country. The eastern Florida Parishes had the most mob violence and highest rate of lynchings in southern Louisiana.<ref name=\"pfeifer\"/>\n\nEspecially after Reconstruction, whites routinely terrorized black communities with mob violence and lynching to prevent freedmen from organizing and gaining political and economic dominance. Piney woods whites resisted the planters' efforts to restore their power, but imposed their own brutal violence on freedmen. Tangipahoa Parish was made more volatile by a \"pronounced in-migration\" of northerners (from the Midwest) and [[Sicily|Sicilian]] immigrants, coupled with \"industrial development along the [[Illinois Central Railroad]], and crippling political factionalism.\" <ref name=\"pfeifer\"/> Laborers of different ethnic groups were pit against one in the struggle for new jobs and power and without the threat of retribution whites often used lynchings and mob violence to terrorize black workers; piney woods whites and migrants operated outside the legal system.\n\nDuring the period of 1877-1950; a total of 24 blacks were [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] by whites in the parish as a means of racial terrorism and intimidation. This was the sixth highest total of any parish in Louisiana<ref>[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf ''Lynching in America, Third Edition: Supplement by County''], p. 6, Equal Justice Initiative, Mobile, AL, 2017</ref> and the highest number of any parish in southern Louisiana.<ref name=\"pfeifer\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=zAGwb3G6soMC&dq=Lynchings+in+Tensas+Parish&q=Tangipahoa+parish#v=snippet&q=Tangipahoa%20parish&f=false Michael James Pfeifer, ''Rough Justice:  Lynching and American Society, 1874-1947''], University of Illinois Press, 2004, pp. 83-84</ref> Twenty-two of these murders took place from 1879-1919, a time of heightened violence in the state. Unlike some other parishes, Tangipahoa did not have a high rate of legal executions of blacks; the whites operated outside the justice system altogether.<ref name=\"pfeifer\"/> Among those lynched and hanged by a mob was Emma Hooper, a black woman who had shot and wounded a constable.<ref>Pfeifer (2004), ''Rough Justice'', p. 198, Footnote #104</ref>\n\nIn 1898 the Louisiana state legislature [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised blacks]] by raising barriers to voter registration, excluding them from politics for decades, until after passage of federal civil rights legislation. In the first half of the 20th century, many African Americans left Tangipahoa Parish to escape the violence and oppression of [[Jim Crow]], moving to industrial cities in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. During World War II, they moved to the West Coast, where the buildup of the defense industry opened up new jobs. In the 21st century, they constitute a minority in the parish.\n\nTimber, agriculture and industry are still important to the parish. It suffered flooding in 1932 and in the early 1980s. In 2016, Tangipahoa was one of many parishes declared a [[Federal government of the United States|Federal]] [[disaster area]] due to [[2016 Louisiana floods|historic flooding]] from rainfall and storms in both March and August.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the parish has a total area of {{convert|823|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|791|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|32|sqmi}} (3.9%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 2, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928155956/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|archivedate=September 28, 2013}}</ref> [[Lake Pontchartrain]] lies on the southeast side of the parish.\n\nMost of the parish south of [[Ponchatoula, Louisiana|Ponchatoula]] consists of [[Holocene]] coastal swamp and marsh\u2014gray-to-black clays of high organic content and thick peat beds underlying freshwater marsh and swamp.<ref>{{cite web | author=McCulloh, R.

Pulver''' Sr. (1955 \u2014 April 21, 2020) was an author and poet, much of whose work falls within the [[horror fiction]], [[noir fiction]] / [[hardboiled]], and [[dark fantasy]] genres. He lived in Germany.\n\n== Work as author ==\nPulver started his publishing career in the early 1990s with a number of short stories published in various American [[small press]] magazines, foremost among them [[Robert M. Price]]'s ''Crypt of [[Cthulhu]]''. His tales cover subjects ranging from [[Robert Wiene]]'s ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' to [[H.P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]] and [[Robert W. Chambers]]' \"[[King in Yellow]].\"\n\nPulver's professional debut came with the publication of his [[Lovecraftian]] novel, \"[[Nightmare's Disciple]]\".\n\nIn addition to various American [[small press]] magazines ([[Hippocampus Press]], [[Lovecraft eZine]], [[Nemonymous]], etc.). Pulver's work has been featured in numerous [[anthologies]] in the US, UK, France, and Japan. Some of these [[anthologies]] include: \"Black Wings: New Tales of Lovecraftian Horror\", \"The Tindalos Mythos\", \"Spawn of the Green Abyss\", \"The Book of Eibon\", [[Lin Carter]]'s \"Anton Zarnak: Supernatural Sleuth\", and \"Rehearsals For Oblivion\".\n\nNearly two dozen short works of his have been translated into French and Japanese.\n\n== Work as editor ==\nPulver has also been the editor of [[Midnight Shambler]] and Tales of Lovecraftian Horror. He was also the co-editor for [[Crypt of Cthulhu]], published by Mythos Books LLC working alongside [[Robert M. Price]], [[Michael Cisco]] and David Wynn.\n\nHe has also edited collections by [[Ann K. Schwader]] (The Worms Remember, Hive Press) and John B. Ford (Dark Shadows on the Moon, Hive Press).\n\nIn 2012 Pulver edited ''A Season in Carcosa'' (an anthology of new tales based on [[Robert W. Chambers]]' \"[[The King in Yellow]]\" tales) for Miskatonic River Press. A year later he edited the award-winning anthology ''The Grimscribe's Puppets'' (a tribute anthology to [[Thomas Ligotti]] for the same publisher).\n\nMr. Pulver was guest editor for the [[Lovecraft eZine]] ''[[The King in Yellow]]'' special issue, which was published in April 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lovecraftzine.com/magazine/issues/2014-2/issue-30-april-2014/ |title=Introduction to Issue #30 |date=April 5, 2014 |website=lovecraftzine.com |accessdate=June 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n''Cassilda's Song'' ([[Chaosium]]), an anthology based on [[Robert W. Chambers]]'s [[King in Yellow]] with new tales, written by female writers. The anthology has been released in 2015 in electronic format and will be available in print in the first quarter of 2016.\n\nFor the [[Necronomicon Providence]] Mr. Pulver edited a Round Robin for the Lovecraft Arts & Sciences Council, that included stories, artwork and accounts by participants of the [[Necronomicon Providence]] in 2013 and 2015.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017 several anthologies that have been edited by Joseph S. Pulver will be published. Amongst them are ''The Madness of Dr. Caligari'' ([[Fedogan & Bremer]], 2016), ''Darker Companions'' - a tribute to [[Ramsey Campbell]], co-edited with Scott David Aniolowski ([[PS Publishing]], 2016), ''Born under a Bad Sign'' and ''The Leaves of a Necronomicon'' ([[Chaosium]] in 2016/2017).\n\nMr. Pulver has curated the release of the [[Michael Cisco]] novella ''Knife Dance'' for Dim Shores.

The league originated in 1956 as the '''Metro Junior \"B\" Hockey League''', which lasted until 1991, when it changed its designation from Junior B to Junior A. It remained a Jr. A league from 1991 until 1998 when it was absorbed by the [[Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League]].\n\n==History==\nThe teams that formed the Metropolitan league played in the ''Big Six Junior B'' league in 1950 until 1953, when a new, nine-member OHA Jr.B league was formed.  The league officially took on the Metropolitan Toronto junior hockey league name in 1956.  For some time, was a part of the [[Ontario Hockey Association]] and the [[Canadian Junior A Hockey League]].  As the name suggests, the league originally consisted of Junior B teams in the Toronto area.  However, over time, with the defection of teams to the Junior A league, the Metro league accepted teams from wider regions.  The league featured many future [[NHL]] stars, including [[Brad Park]] ([[Toronto Westclairs]]), [[Wayne Gretzky]] ([[Toronto Nationals (1970\u20131980)|Toronto Nationals]]), [[Eric Lindros]] ([[St. Michael's Buzzers]]), [[Dale Hawerchuk]] ([[Durham Fury|Oshawa Legionaires]]), [[Ken Dryden]] ([[Etobicoke Indians]]), and [[Curtis Joseph]] ([[Mississauga Chargers|King City Dukes]]).\n\nDuring the early years, the \"Junior B\" league was essentially the minor league feeder for the \"Junior A\" Ontario Hockey Association.   Almost all of the Metro players eventually moved on to play in the OHA.  Following the NCAA's 1980 rule change that deemed any OHL players to be professionals, amateur leagues such as the Junior B leagues grew. The Metro league became a key feeder to college hockey programs during the 1980s and 1990s, producing more than 200 future NCAA players.\n\n===The early Junior B years ===\nThe early years featured Toronto-based teams such as the St.Mike's Buzzers, Dixie Beehives, Toronto Lakeshore Bruins, Toronto Marlies/Weston Dukes, Unionville Jets, Aurora Tigers, Whitby Dunlops, Leaside Rangers, Brampton 7Ups and the Woodbridge Dodgers. For the most part, the teams served as farm teams at the Junior B level for the Junior A OHA teams.  The 1964\u201365 season starred a 17-year-old [[Ken Dryden]] in net for the [[Etobicoke Indians]].  With Dryden in net, the Indians won the Metro league title and made it all the way to the [[Sutherland Cup]] final where they lost 4-games-to-2 to the [[Kitchener Dutchmen|Kitchener Greenshirts]].   Ken Dryden moved on to become one of the most famous [[NHL]] [[goaltender]]s of all-time. He played in the [[1972 Summit Series]], won the 1971 [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as playoff MVP a season before he was officially a [[rookie]] (which he won the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] in 1972 as Rookie of the Year), he won six [[Stanley Cup]]s, and is a [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]er.\n\n===Exodus 1972 ===\nIn 1972 the Metro B league was reshaped substantially when six members left to join the new Ontario Provincial Junior A league.  Metro members [[Ajax Merchants|Ajax Steelers]], [[Aurora Tigers]], [[Dixie Beehives]], [[Royal York Royals|Downsview Bees]], [[North York Rangers]], and the [[North York Rangers|Richmond Hill Rams]] left.  A year later the [[Markham Waxers]] also left.  To make up for the losses, the Metro league took in new members [[Belleville Bobcats]] and the [[Peterborough Stars|Peterborough Lions]] from the folded [[Eastern Ontario Junior B Hockey League (OHA)|Eastern Ontario Junior B Hockey League]], and expanded with the [[Durham Fury|Oshawa Legionaires]], [[Bramalea Blues]], [[Pickering Panthers]], and [[Toronto Jr. Canadiens|Wexford Warriors]].  The [[Etobicoke Selects]], [[Toronto Red Wings]], and [[Markham Waxers]] joined in 1973.  The [[Kingston Voyageurs]] entered the league in 1974.\n\nIn 1974, the Metro Champion [[Bramalea Blues]] defeated the [[Owen Sound Greys]] 4-games-to-3 to reach the [[Sutherland Cup]] All-Ontario Final.  Upon reaching the final, the Blues defeated the [[Hamilton Red Wings Jr. A|Hamilton Red Wings]] of the [[Golden Horseshoe Junior B Hockey League|Niagara & District Junior B Hockey League]] in Game 1, only to have a brawl involving the teams, officials, and fans breakout to the point that police were called to break up the incident.  Due to the brawl, the Blues withdrew from the final and became the only team in [[Ontario Hockey Association]] history to forfeit the [[Sutherland Cup]].\n\nThe 1975 season marked the first junior appearance by a 14-year-old \"underage\" [[Wayne Gretzky]] for the [[Toronto Nationals (1970\u20131980)|Toronto Nationals]].  In September, [[Walter Gretzky]] had Wayne moved to the City of [[Vaughan, Ontario|Vaughan]] to play midget hockey for the Toronto Young Nats instead of playing in his hometown of [[Brantford, Ontario]].  In October, the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]]  declared Gretzky and 15-year-old Brian Rorabek ineligible because they had established residency too late.  Gretzky sued in the Canadian Courts and lost [https://web.archive.org/web/20070608230940/http://www.southcoastal.com/history/gretzky.htm].  Because Gretzky could remain in Toronto to play junior (rather than midget hockey), Gretzky tried out for the Junior B team, and made the team.  In 28 games, Gretzky scored 27 goals and 33 assists to win Metro Rookie of the Year honours.  The next year the team moved to [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]] and became the Seneca Nationals.  Gretzky scored 36 goals and 36 assists in 32 games, and then 40 goals and 35 assists in 23 playoff games to lead his team to a Metro Junior \"B\" Championship.  Sadly, the team came up short of a [[Sutherland Cup]] victory, as the Nationals were stopped dead in the 1977 All-Ontario Semi-final by the [[Stratford Cullitons]] of the [[Midwestern Junior B Hockey League|Wellington-Waterloo Junior B Hockey League]].\n\nThe Henry Carr Crusaders, a team sponsored by the Toronto highschool, joined the Junior \"B\" ranks in 1980.  They won league titles in 1983, 1984, and 1987.  Their best season came in 1983, where they went undefeated during the regular season, won the Metro, and then went on to win the [[Sutherland Cup]] as All-Ontario Junior \"B\" Champions.  That team featured future [[NHL]]ers [[Bob Essensa]], [[Paul Cavallini]] and [[Victor Posa]] and NHL draft picks Rob Bryden and Allister Brown.  In 1991, Henry Carr Highschool dropped its sponsorship of the team, and as of 2006 were known as the [[Toronto Thunderbirds]].\n\nDuring the 1986\u201387, a strange occurrence happened with the team that is now known as the [[Mississauga Chargers]].  Then known as the King City Dukes and in their third season in [[King, Ontario|King]] since moving from [[Weston, Toronto|Weston]], the team moved mid-season to [[North York, Ontario|North York]] and renamed itself the North York Civics.  The oddity here is that teams rarely do a complete locational move in the middle of a season.  The next year they became the Richmond Hill Dukes and skipped around the [[Greater Toronto Area]] for the better part of the next decade trying to find a home.\n\nDuring the 1988\u201389 season Kingston's Scott Martin won his second consecutive scoring title and League MVP award.  His season totals of 62 goals and 114 points in a mere 42 games came closest to topping the league records set by NHLers [[Patrick Flatley]] during the 1980\u201381 season (137 points for Henry Carr), and [[Paul Gardner (ice hockey)|Paul Gardner]] during the 1973\u201374 season (77 goals and 132 points for St.Mike's).\n\n===1990 departure from CJAHL and move to Junior A===\nThe league was classified by the OHA as a Junior B league, until a falling-out in June 1990, when the Ontario Hockey Federation was formed, comprising the OHA, the Ontario major junior league, three minor hockey groups and women's hockey. The OHA was given jurisdiction over junior hockey below major junior excluding junior A in the north.  Junior teams in Toronto were not members of the OHA and therefore not members of the CAHA.  As a result, in 1990 the Metro league declared itself to be an independent junior league.  A year later, during the summer of 1991, the league declared itself to be a Junior A league, and hired a full-time commissioner, Don Linthwaite.\n\nThe Metro League's move brought into motion changes that ultimately led to the creation of the Ontario Provincial Junior Hockey League.  After the Metro league declared itself to be a Junior A league, the Central Junior B league followed, declaring itself a Junior A league after the 1992\u201393 season.  Through November 19\u201321, 1993, the new junior A leagues joined with teams from the other Canadian provincial junior A leagues, and formed the Canadian Junior A Hockey League.\n\n===Exodus 1995 ===\nIn 1995, crisis struck the Metro Junior A Hockey League.  In the midst of perceived corruption by the league, five teams walked out on the Metro.  Four of these teams, the [[Bramalea Blues]], [[Kingston Voyageurs]], [[Mississauga Chargers]], and [[St. Michael's Buzzers]], fled to join the [[Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League]].  The [[Mimico Monarchs|Richmond Hill Riot]] folded.  This marked the beginning of the end for the Metro.  The Metro Junior Hockey League chose to play outside the CJAHL and CHA in 1995\u201396.\n\nHockey history was made on February 21, 1997 when [http://www.lcshockey.com/issues/LCS65.txt Ryan Venturelli] of the [[Muskoka Bears]] became the first goaltender in hockey history to score two goals (both empty net) in a hockey game against the [[Durham Huskies Jr. A|Durham Huskies]].\n\nDespite extensive expansion, the league was not able to retain its past glory and was swallowed whole by the OPJHL in 1998.  The Metro league folded, with most of its teams being taken in by the OPJHL, as well as many of its players. So far the most successful of these teams seem to be the [[Aurora Tigers]], who after winning the OPJHL and Dudley Hewitt Cup in 2004, they took home the [[Royal Bank Cup 2004]] as [[CJAHL]] National Champions as well.  The league produced numerous stars, both in the [[NHL]] and as a feeder for [[NCAA]] college hockey, having produced 350 NCAA Division I scholarship athletes from 1980 to 1998.\n\n==Teams ==\n{|

was a junior level [[ice hockey]] league based out of [[Southern Ontario]]. The league originated in 1956 as the '''Metro Junior \"B\" Hockey League''', which lasted until 1991, when it changed its designation from Junior B to Junior A. It remained a Jr. A league from 1991 until 1998 when it was absorbed by the [[Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League]].\n\n==History==\nThe teams that formed the Metropolitan league played in the ''Big Six Junior B'' league in 1950 until 1953, when a new, nine-member OHA Jr.B league was formed.  The league officially took on the Metropolitan Toronto junior hockey league name in 1956.  For some time, was a part of the [[Ontario Hockey Association]] and the [[Canadian Junior A Hockey League]].  As the name suggests, the league originally consisted of Junior B teams in the Toronto area.  However, over time, with the defection of teams to the Junior A league, the Metro league accepted teams from wider regions.  The league featured many future [[NHL]] stars, including [[Brad Park]] ([[Toronto Westclairs]]), [[Wayne Gretzky]] ([[Toronto Nationals (1970\u20131980)|Toronto Nationals]]), [[Eric Lindros]] ([[St. Michael's Buzzers]]), [[Dale Hawerchuk]] ([[Durham Fury|Oshawa Legionaires]]), [[Ken Dryden]] ([[Etobicoke Indians]]), and [[Curtis Joseph]] ([[Mississauga Chargers|King City Dukes]]).\n\nDuring the early years, the \"Junior B\" league was essentially the minor league feeder for the \"Junior A\" Ontario Hockey Association.   Almost all of the Metro players eventually moved on to play in the OHA.  Following the NCAA's 1980 rule change that deemed any OHL players to be professionals, amateur leagues such as the Junior B leagues grew. The Metro league became a key feeder to college hockey programs during the 1980s and 1990s, producing more than 200 future NCAA players.\n\n===The early Junior B years ===\nThe early years featured Toronto-based teams such as the St.Mike's Buzzers, Dixie Beehives, Toronto Lakeshore Bruins, Toronto Marlies/Weston Dukes, Unionville Jets, Aurora Tigers, Whitby Dunlops, Leaside Rangers, Brampton 7Ups and the Woodbridge Dodgers. For the most part, the teams served as farm teams at the Junior B level for the Junior A OHA teams.  The 1964-65 season starred a 17-year-old [[Ken Dryden]] in net for the [[Etobicoke Indians]].  With Dryden in net, the Indians won the Metro league title and made it all the way to the [[Sutherland Cup]] final where they lost 4-games-to-2 to the [[Kitchener Dutchmen|Kitchener Greenshirts]].   Ken Dryden moved on to become one of the most famous [[NHL]] [[goaltender]]s of all-time. He played in the [[1972 Summit Series]], won the 1971 [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as playoff MVP a season before he was officially a [[rookie]] (which he won the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] in 1972 as Rookie of the Year), he won six [[Stanley Cup]]s, and is a [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]er.\n\n===Exodus 1972 ===\nIn 1972 the Metro B league was reshaped substantially when six members left to join the new Ontario Provincial Junior A league.  Metro members [[Ajax Merchants|Ajax Steelers]], [[Aurora Tigers]], [[Dixie Beehives]], [[Royal York Royals|Downsview Bees]], [[North York Rangers]], and the [[North York Rangers|Richmond Hill Rams]] left.  A year later the [[Markham Waxers]] also left.  To make up for the losses, the Metro league took in new members [[Belleville Bobcats]] and the [[Peterborough Stars|Peterborough Lions]] from the folded [[Eastern Ontario Junior B Hockey League (OHA)|Eastern Ontario Junior B Hockey League]], and expanded with the [[Durham Fury|Oshawa Legionaires]], [[Bramalea Blues]], [[Pickering Panthers]], and [[Toronto Jr. Canadiens|Wexford Warriors]].  The [[Etobicoke Selects]], [[Toronto Red Wings]], and [[Markham Waxers]] joined in 1973.  The [[Kingston Voyageurs]] entered the league in 1974.\n\nIn 1974, the Metro Champion [[Bramalea Blues]] defeated the [[Owen Sound Greys]] 4-games-to-3 to reach the [[Sutherland Cup]] All-Ontario Final.  Upon reaching the final, the Blues defeated the [[Hamilton Red Wings Jr. A|Hamilton Red Wings]] of the [[Golden Horseshoe Junior B Hockey League|Niagara & District Junior B Hockey League]] in Game 1, only to have a brawl involving the teams, officials, and fans breakout to the point that police were called to break up the incident.  Due to the brawl, the Blues withdrew from the final and became the only team in [[Ontario Hockey Association]] history to forfeit the [[Sutherland Cup]].\n\nThe 1975 season marked the first junior appearance by a 14-year-old \"underage\" [[Wayne Gretzky]] for the [[Toronto Nationals (1970\u20131980)|Toronto Nationals]].  In September, [[Walter Gretzky]] had Wayne moved to the City of [[Vaughan, Ontario|Vaughan]] to play midget hockey for the Toronto Young Nats instead of playing in his hometown of [[Brantford, Ontario]].  In October, the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]]  declared Gretzky and 15-year-old Brian Rorabek ineligible because they had established residency too late.  Gretzky sued in the Canadian Courts and lost [https://web.archive.org/web/20070608230940/http://www.southcoastal.com/history/gretzky.htm].  Because Gretzky could remain in Toronto to play junior (rather than midget hockey), Gretzky tried out for the Junior B team, and made the team.  In 28 games, Gretzky scored 27 goals and 33 assists to win Metro Rookie of the Year honours.  The next year the team moved to [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]] and became the Seneca Nationals.  Gretzky scored 36 goals and 36 assists in 32 games, and then 40 goals and 35 assists in 23 playoff games to lead his team to a Metro Junior \"B\" Championship.  Sadly, the team came up short of a [[Sutherland Cup]] victory, as the Nationals were stopped dead in the 1977 All-Ontario Semi-final by the [[Stratford Cullitons]] of the [[Midwestern Junior B Hockey League|Wellington-Waterloo Junior B Hockey League]].\n\nThe Henry Carr Crusaders, a team sponsored by the Toronto highschool, joined the Junior \"B\" ranks in 1980.  They won league titles in 1983, 1984, and 1987.  Their best season came in 1983, where they went undefeated during the regular season, won the Metro, and then went on to win the [[Sutherland Cup]] as All-Ontario Junior \"B\" Champions.  That team featured future [[NHL]]ers [[Bob Essensa]], [[Paul Cavallini]] and [[Victor Posa]] and NHL draft picks Rob Bryden and Allister Brown.  In 1991, Henry Carr Highschool dropped its sponsorship of the team, and as of 2006 were known as the [[Toronto Thunderbirds]].\n\nDuring the 1986-87, a strange occurrence happened with the team that is now known as the [[Mississauga Chargers]].  Then known as the King City Dukes and in their third season in [[King, Ontario|King]] since moving from [[Weston, Toronto|Weston]], the team moved mid-season to [[North York, Ontario|North York]] and renamed itself the North York Civics.  The oddity here is that teams rarely do a complete locational move in the middle of a season.  The next year they became the Richmond Hill Dukes and skipped around the [[Greater Toronto Area]] for the better part of the next decade trying to find a home.\n\nDuring the 1988-89 season Kingston's Scott Martin won his second consecutive scoring title and League MVP award.  His season totals of 62 goals and 114 points in a mere 42 games came closest to topping the league records set by NHLers [[Patrick Flatley]] during the 1980-81 season (137 points for Henry Carr), and [[Paul Gardner (ice hockey)|Paul Gardner]] during the 1973-74 season (77 goals and 132 points for St.Mike's).\n\n===1990 departure from CJAHL and move to Junior A===\nThe league was classified by the OHA as a Junior B league, until a falling-out in June 1990, when the Ontario Hockey Federation was formed, comprising the OHA, the Ontario major junior league, three minor hockey groups and women's hockey. The OHA was given jurisdiction over junior hockey below major junior excluding junior A in the north.  Junior teams in Toronto were not members of the OHA and therefore not members of the CAHA.  As a result, in 1990 the Metro league declared itself to be an independent junior league.  A year later, during the summer of 1991, the league declared itself to be a Junior A league, and hired a full-time commissioner, Don Linthwaite.\n\nThe Metro League's move brought into motion changes that ultimately led to the creation of the Ontario Provincial Junior Hockey League.  After the Metro league declared itself to be a Junior A league, the Central Junior B league followed, declaring itself a Junior A league after the 1992-93 season.  Through November 19\u201321, 1993, the new junior A leagues joined with teams from the other Canadian provincial junior A leagues, and formed the Canadian Junior A Hockey League.\n\n===Exodus 1995 ===\nIn 1995, crisis struck the Metro Junior A Hockey League.  In the midst of perceived corruption by the league, five teams walked out on the Metro.  Four of these teams, the [[Bramalea Blues]], [[Kingston Voyageurs]], [[Mississauga Chargers]], and [[St. Michael's Buzzers]], fled to join the [[Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League]].  The [[Mimico Monarchs|Richmond Hill Riot]] folded.  This marked the beginning of the end for the Metro.  The Metro Junior Hockey League chose to play outside the CJAHL and CHA in 1995-96.\n\nHockey history was made on February 21, 1997 when [http://www.lcshockey.com/issues/LCS65.txt Ryan Venturelli] of the [[Muskoka Bears]] became the first goaltender in hockey history to score two goals (both empty net) in a hockey game against the [[Durham Huskies Jr. A|Durham Huskies]].\n\nDespite extensive expansion, the league was not able to retain its past glory and was swallowed whole by the OPJHL in 1998.  The Metro league folded, with most of its teams being taken in by the OPJHL, as well as many of its players. So far the most successful of these teams seem to be the [[Aurora Tigers]], who after winning the OPJHL and Dudley Hewitt Cup in 2004, they took home the [[Royal Bank Cup 2004]] as [[CJAHL]] National Champions as well.  The league produced numerous stars, both in the [[NHL]] and as a feeder for [[NCAA]] college hockey, having produced 350 NCAA Division I scholarship athletes from 1980 to 1998.\n\n==Teams ==\n{|

The report establishes that legal challenges exist for authority of the Grameen Bank to have acted as guarantor and to have forwarded credit to independent private enterprises during Dr. Yunus's tenure. The report raised specific questions relating to a) establishment and financing of GrameenPhone, a for-profit telecommunications entity initially established as a trust for the Grameen Bank borrowers together with Norwegian government owned multinational Telenor by Dr Yunus, and b) simultaneous management and operational financing of private enterprises established by Dr Yunus applying resources of the Grameen Bank.  The commission also examined the legal status of the Grameen Bank and concluded that it was de jure public i.e. government entity, of which incompetent oversight by the state and (potentially unwitting) misrepresentation by Dr. Yunus in past resulted in the popular perception of the private ownership.  The commission report refers to obstruction of commission investigations by current Grameen Bank management, representatives of Telenor, the Government of Bangladesh, and by partisans of Dr. Yunus.  Full implications of the report are thus far not closely examined in either state-controlled elements of Bangladeshi media, or by pro-Yunus press releases, where these implicate Dr Yunus as at least accessory to corruption at the nexus of the Bangladeshi public-commercial establishment, in collusion with other parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mof.gov.bd/en/budget/gb/Grameen_Bank_Interim_Report.pdf|title=Interim report of the Grameen Bank Commission|publisher=Ministry of Finance of the Government of Bangladesh|accessdate=2 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303124442/http://www.mof.gov.bd/en/budget/gb/Grameen_Bank_Interim_Report.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Criticism of ideas===\n{{see also|Impact of microcredit}}\nMicrofinance has been criticised in the foreign media.

The report establishes that legal challenges exist for authority of the Grameen Bank to have acted as guarantor and to have forwarded credit to independent private enterprises during Dr. Yunus's tenure. The report raised specific questions relating to a) establishment and financing of GrameenPhone, a for-profit telecommunications entity initially established as a trust for the Grameen Bank borrowers together with Norwegian government owned multinational Telenor by Dr Yunus, and b) simultaneous management and operational financing of private enterprises established by Dr Yunus applying resources of the Grameen Bank.  The commission also examined the legal status of the Grameen Bank and concluded that it was de jure public i.e. government entity, of which incompetent oversight by the state and (potentially unwitting) misrepresentation by Dr. Yunus in past resulted in the popular perception of the private ownership.  The commission report refers to obstruction of commission investigations by current Grameen Bank management, representatives of Telenor, the Government of Bangladesh, and by partisans of Dr. Yunus.  Full implications of the report are thus far not closely examined in either state-controlled elements of Bangladeshi media, or by pro-Yunus press releases, where these implicate Dr Yunus as at least accessory to corruption at the nexus of the Bangladeshi public-commercial establishment, in collusion with other parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mof.gov.bd/en/budget/gb/Grameen_Bank_Interim_Report.pdf|title=Interim report of the Grameen Bank Commission|publisher=Ministry of Finance of the Government of Bangladesh|accessdate=2 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303124442/http://www.mof.gov.bd/en/budget/gb/Grameen_Bank_Interim_Report.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Criticism of ideas===\n{{see also|Impact of microcredit}}\nMicrofinance has been criticised in the foreign media.

They reflect both popular perceptions of Soviet behavior and the predominant national security values of the Reagan era. They also perpetuate myths about the American past and reinforce the symbols, images, historical lessons that have dominated Cold War discourse.<ref>Walter L.

Historian Walter Hixson has argued that Clancy's novels, especially ''The Hunt for Red October'' and ''Red Storm Rising,'' were:\n:popular representations of Reagan-era Cold War values. They reflect both popular perceptions of Soviet behavior and the predominant national security values of the Reagan era.
