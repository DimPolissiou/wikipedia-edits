Entering service between 2006 and 2010, they replaced all [[R38 (New York City Subway car)|R38]], [[R40 (New York City Subway car)|R40/A]], and [[New York City Transit Authority|NYCT]]-operated [[R44 (New York City Subway car)|R44]] cars, and most [[R32 (New York City Subway car)|R32]] and [[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42]] cars. The R160s are very similar to the [[R143 (New York City Subway car)|R143]]<nowiki/>s, but the two-car types cannot run together in the same train. The biggest difference between them is the [[New Technology Train#FIND%20displays|FIND (Flexible Information and Notice Display)]] system on the R160s in place of static [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] maps on the R143s.\n\nIn total, 1,662 cars comprise the R160 class, and are split into two versions: the [[Alstom]]-built '''R160A''' and the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company|Kawasaki]]-built '''R160B'''. 372 out of the 1002 R160A cars are arranged in four-car sets, known as '''R160A-1''' cars, with the remaining 630 cars in five-car sets, known as '''R160A-2''' cars. All R160B cars are in five-car sets; however, two propulsion types were used. Cars with Alstom Onix propulsion found on all R160As are known as '''R160B-1''' cars, and cars with [[Siemens]] SITRAC propulsion are known as '''R160B-2''' cars.\n\nKawasaki had little to no problems in delivering the R160B cars, which entered service on August 17, 2006. Alstom was behind the delivery schedule early on for the R160As, which first ran on October 17, 2006. The [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] exercised \u201coptions\u201d for both contracts, and by June 2010, all R160 cars were in service. Numerous experimental features were added to the R160s through the 2010s. 68 R160A cars were fitted with [[communications-based train control]] (CBTC) equipment installed for service on the [[BMT Canarsie Line|Canarsie Line]] ([[L (New York City Subway service)|L]] train), and the majority of the remaining fleet is planned to have CBTC equipment installed for service on the [[IND Queens Boulevard Line|Queens Boulevard Line]] ([[E (New York City Subway service)|E]], [[F (New York City Subway service)|F]], [[M (New York City Subway service)|M]] and [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] trains).\n\n==Description==\n{{stack|float=right|\n[[File:R160 End Route Display.JPG|thumb|alt=Front route display on an R160 in service on the W line|Front route display on an R160 in service on the '''W''' train]]\n[[File:R160 FIND System 2.jpg|thumb|alt=The R160 FIND system on a Coney Island-bound F train|The R160 FIND system on a Coney Island-bound '''F''' train]]\n}}\nThere are two versions of the R160: the '''R160A''' (built by Alstom, numbered 8313-8712, 9233-9802, & 9943-9974) and '''R160B''' (built by Kawasaki, numbered 8713-9232 & 9803-9942).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/compliance/pdf/supplemental-info.pdf|title=Supplementary Information for \u00a71269(d) 2012 \u2013 2017|last=|first=|date=2012|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|page=30|access-date=October 28, 2017}}</ref> The two-car types are nearly identical to each other, and differ only in a few ways; they are interoperable and can be interchanged with each other.\n\nThe R160 cars are configured in either four-car sets or five-car sets. 372 R160A cars (8313-8652 & 9943-9974) are configured as four-car sets. All of the four-car sets are maintained at [[East New York Yard]] for the [[BMT Eastern Division]] ({{NYCS|J}}/{{NYCS|Z}}, {{NYCS|L}}, and {{NYCS|M}}). The remaining 630 R160A cars and all R160Bs are configured as five-car sets for use on other B Division services. Some are maintained at [[Jamaica Yard]], typically operating on the {{NYCS|E}} and {{NYCS|F}}, and the rest are maintained at the [[Coney Island Yard]], typically operating on the {{NYCS|N}}, {{NYCS|Q}}, and {{NYCS|W}}.\n\nThe R160A base order was part of a $961,687,121 contract funded in part by a grant from the [[Federal Transit Administration]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.info/press-release/mta-headquarters/mta-nyc-transit-awards-new-car-contract|title=MTA - Press Release - MTA Headquarters - MTA NYC Transit Awards New Car Contract|work=mta.info}}</ref> The primary base order of the R160 class consisted of 660 cars, 400 R160As to be built by [[Alstom]], and the remaining 260 R160Bs to be built by Kawasaki. The contract included options for further orders, which, if exercised, would have brought the total business with NYCT to about US$2.4 billion, for 1,700 subway cars, and Kawasaki would have manufactured 40% (680 cars) of the 1,700 cars. The R160 fleet was purchased at an average cost of $2.0 million [[United States Dollars|USD]] per car.<ref>http://web.mta.info/mta/budget/pdf/2008-2013%20Capital%20Plan.pdf, p24</ref>\n\n==Features==\n[[File:NYC N train cockpit.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Driver's cab of an R160 train]]\nThe R160s are very similar to the [[R143 (New York City Subway car)|R143]]s; however, the two car types can not be interchanged with each other.<ref name=\"NYTimes-NYCSPromiseInfo-Nov2005\">{{cite news |last=Chan |first=Sewell |authorlink=Sewell Chan|title=New Subway Cars Promise All Kinds of Information |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 30, 2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/30/nyregion/30car.html |accessdate=October 27, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geniustransitchallenge.ny.gov/sites/default/files/resources/page-4/technical-specification-car-equipment.11.pdf|title=Specifications for Furnishing and Delivering Passenger Cars for the New York City Transit System|last=|first=|date=July 2017|website=geniustransitchallenge.ny.gov|page=R160 1-2|access-date=August 6, 2017}}</ref> The R160s are also visually very similar to the [[R179 (New York City Subway car)|R179s]], but the two car types are not interoperable with each other due to electrical incompatibilities between them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/160523_1030_Transit.pdf|title=Transit & Bus Committee Meeting May 2016|date=May 2016|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=September 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe R160s are equipped with regenerative braking, which allows the cars to capture the braking energy as trains enter a station and transfer it to trains on nearby tracks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/sustainability/pdf/SustRptFinal.pdf|title=Greening Mass Transit & Metro Regions: The Final Report of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Sustainability and the MTA|last=|first=|date=2009|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|page=22|access-date=October 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOne of the major changes and highlights of the new cars is the addition of an electronic [[New Technology Train#FIND displays|\"FIND\" (Flexible Information and Notice Display) system]], which includes an LCD screen displaying the route, route information, and advertisements, and a tri-color (red, yellow, green) [[LED]] strip map which displays the next ten stations, plus five consecutive \"further stops\" to riders. There are three of these in every car. The display updates the stations at every stop, also giving the number of stops to each station listed.

Entering service between 2006 and 2010, they replaced all [[R38 (New York City Subway car)|R38]], [[R40 (New York City Subway car)|R40/A]], and [[New York City Transit Authority|NYCT]]-operated [[R44 (New York City Subway car)|R44]] cars, and most [[R32 (New York City Subway car)|R32]] and [[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42]] cars. The R160s are very similar to the [[R143 (New York City Subway car)|R143]]<nowiki/>s, but the two-car types cannot run together in the same train. The biggest difference between them is the [[New Technology Train#FIND%20displays|FIND (Flexible Information and Notice Display)]] system on the R160s in place of static [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] maps on the R143s.\n\nIn total, 1,662 cars comprise the R160 class, and are split into two versions: the [[Alstom]]-built '''R160A''' and the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company|Kawasaki]]-built '''R160B'''. 372 out of the 1002 R160A cars are arranged in four-car sets, known as '''R160A-1''' cars, with the remaining 630 cars in five-car sets, known as '''R160A-2''' cars. All R160B cars are in five-car sets; however, two propulsion types were used. Cars with Alstom Onix propulsion found on all R160As are known as '''R160B-1''' cars, and cars with [[Siemens]] SITRAC propulsion are known as '''R160B-2''' cars.\n\nKawasaki had little to no problems in delivering the R160B cars, which entered service on August 17, 2006. Alstom was behind the delivery schedule early on for the R160As, which first ran on October 17, 2006. The [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] exercised \u201coptions\u201d for both contracts, and by June 2010, all R160 cars were in service.
